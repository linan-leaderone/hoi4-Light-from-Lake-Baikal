 UKR_pwr_struggle.1.desc:0 ""Chairman Melnyk? Chairman Melnyk? I have your morning tea. Melnyk?"\n\nWith his left foot, Melnyk's secretary pushed open his superior's office door, expecting to hear a weak greeting from the Chairman. Instead, Melnyk was silent, his torso slumped onto his desk, his skin made pale and sallow by rigor mortis or by office lights. The secretary put down the teaset and checked his pulse. Nothing.\n\nThe secretary bowed his head for a moment. Perhaps in better days, his first thought would have been on memorials and decorum, Melnyk would have liked. But there was no time for such niceties. Quietly, as if not to disturb him, the secretary pushed Melnyk's heavy frame aside and reached for his telephone. A few people would need to be called - Melnyk's wife, his few lasting friends, Leibbrandt. First, however, came succession.\n\n~~~\n\n"...yes? Yes? I understand. My condolences to Pan Melnyk. He was a great leader for the Ukrainian people, despite our differences."\n\nPavlo Shandruk expected he would have a great reaction to the news. Melnyk was a fellow veteran of the Sich, a freedom fighter for Ukrainian, a long-time acquaintance. But all Shandruk could think of was their meetings together - Melnyk pointing at a map, relaying German instructions, telling the old general which villages needed to burn.\n\nInstead, Shandruk chose to focus on politics. "Before you consult anyone else about this matter, I am going to give you a list of names. Inform them of the news, discreetly, and tell them to message me at their earliest convenience. We are going to have a meeting of the Ukrainian National Council in the following week, and we must stand as a united front to choose a successor. As for the Reichskommissar...""

 UKR_pwr_struggle.2.desc:0 "Kozhevnikov's voice was crackled and warped, but his words were clear. The UNC had discovered that Andriy Melnyk had died in the night. Georg Leibbrandt, from his manor in the south, was already arranging papers and giving notes. Kozhevnikov was Leibbrandt's most loyal protege, one of the few Ukrainians who he knew he could trust implicitly. He clearly needed to be the successor.\n\nYet doing so meant propelling a fairly controversial man into the top slot. Yes, the Ukrainians were intelligent in their own way, but they also had consistently proven in need of guidance during times of crisis. After all, it was their own radical and warped kind who attempted revolution. Their psychology was one of loyalty, of leadership, and it only took a small number of disgruntled and motivated leaders to pull them in every direction. The moment divisions appeared, the Security Council would have an excuse to step in and create a crisis.\n\nA party line was needed. If Kozhevnikov was to be the next Chairman, he could have no opposition.\n\nLeibbrandt put down the phone and called for his secretary. Still buried in his notes, he barked out an order to the man. "Call Sushko, Shandruk, Shtul, even Stsiborskyi. Any UNC member who might try to take the role. Tell them all that, for reasons of national unity in this time of mourning, they are to stand down and support the candidacy of Herr Kozhevnikov. Don't let them argue, give the order and move on.""

 UKR_pwr_struggle.3.desc:0 "The air brought tidings of change, yet Artem felt nothing really different. Of course, his work in the grand scheme of things was minimal at best; on his dutiful page, he wrote the letters and missives to be sent, from the higher-ups, towards the officers and bureaucrats through Ukraine. It was a dull job to be sure, but it afforded him a thoroughly peculiar point of view of the minds that ruled over the Reichskommissariat. His fingers dutifully clack at the letters, checking the missives he read to make sure the message is sent along properly.\n\nYet, something in him feels the ever-present sense of...boredom? Disappointment? Even with the turmoil of changes, with the growing tensions, a climate he could feel every day he walked back to his office, he still turned to this table, to write the same messages in an almost robotic motion; as if nothing was wrong.\n\nIt's in this growing haze of monotony, that perhaps a simple spark lit in his head. And he only really needs to look upward, to the picture hanging in his dull, beige office to remember why the UNC is acting through the motions. It used to show the portrait of Melnyk, but from one day to another, perhaps in the cleaning of the offices, it was swiftly replaced before anyone could even grieve.\n\nFor it's not the temperate expression of the deceased Andriy Melnyk that gazes at the offices, but of Leibbrandt, berating him for wasting time looking at the portrait.\n\nWithout lifting a single word, without even a public appearance, just with a casual swap of a portrait, it was like the whole party had their leash pulled...and they could do nothing for the moment, lest the turmoil that rages outside consumes them whole."

 UKR_pwr_struggle.4.desc:0 "It's perhaps baffling how context can change how one perceives their surroundings, and Shandruk would know that better than most men. After all, a battlefield can have many meanings, and all it takes is a single moment, a single shot, a single bombshell, to radically change a victory to a crushing, costly loss. And in the halls of the Kiew's political elite, the most dangerous game is being played, not initially with guns, but certainly ending with one if they aren't careful.\n\nThe lock is checked, double-checked, triple-checked. A red telephone is set on the counter, ready to be ringed if this meeting goes south and an evacuation is necessary. The windows are covered, the lamps dimmer, and Shandruk's personal gun is in his lap. Tapping his fingers, nails overgrown and unkempt, he stares at his fellow UNC-S members, their faces barely betraying the anxiety and nervousness. In the end, recruits didn't change, be them wearing uniforms or suits, the fear of death and reprisal is always a haunting mirage when one seeks to change something.\n\n"...what you're suggesting is outrageous at best, and treasonous at worst. In any ideal circumstance, I would have you shot."\n\n"Sir, if you...forgive me speaking, but as it stands, we're liable to end up purged by Leibbrandt anyway. Any slight to his 'vision' is something to get rid of, and it's not a matter of if..."\n\nThe young man stares at his face, his eyes glancing over at the closed windows for a moment, leaving the old veteran to ponder: what else is that man worried about, besides his own skin.\n\n"...but when? Bräutigam is our best bet, sir. You know that."\n\nA silence stretches in the office before Shandruk clicks his tongue and goes to the phone, dialing a long repeated number. It's ludicrous, suicidal even, but he's right. Bräutigam has shown strength in this chaotic mess, and people like him and his party would be nothing but stains for Georg to wipe away in his vision of a perfect Ukraine."

Albeit it's not what's in here, but what's missing from here."\n\nSushko raises his brow as Stsiborskyi scoffs, reaching into his pocket for a wallet of cigarettes. He thought Stsiborskyi would offer him one, but he simply lit one with a single match before tossing it out the window. Sushko raised one eyebrow, willing Stsiborskyi to speak, which simply lead to an awkward silence as the aides removed more traces that Melnyk ever existed. Soon enough, aides shooed the two out of the office, their steps bordering on automatic until Stisborskyi's firm hand held Sushko's shoulder in place, in the middle of the staircase leading to the second floor.\n\n"Please don't tell me you're going to go ahead with Leibbrandt."\n\n"Of course not. That man is a bootlicker of the highest caliber. But do you have any suggestions? Because I'm not willing to be in tomorrow's obituary."\n\n"We just need an ally. Someone who can be our public face. How about Bräutigam?"\n\n"He's a failed candidate at this point - if he'd even work with us."\n\n"And obviously not Koch, the man's a bloody vegetable."\n\nIt was a small blessing that their surroundings were deathly silent as both men spoke of treason. Yet, as both politicians' mental lists ran down, one particular name remains, to their growing distaste and horror.\n\nOtto Ohlendorf. Someone with enough power, and enough ambition to champion their cause. They'd help launder his reputation, and he could protect them. It made them ill to the core.\n\nAnd yet no one else fit. They had to tie their destiny, to that farce. Hands shaking and with grim acceptance on both of their faces, they share a quiet nod and climb upstairs, acting as naturally as they could..."

Readjusting to his new circumstances, Ohlendorf laid back in his chair, and reflected on what could only be his latest course of action.\n\nWith the collaborators apparently firmly within Leibbrandt's pockets, he'd been locked out of a potential family of assets. Of course, collaborators rarely made good political allies, and a German with a club was just as strong as a Ukrainian, if more trustworthy. As lamenting what could have been certainly had been no more than a distracted man's waste of time, Ohlendorf began dialing Weinmann.\n\n"It's final, then? We've lost the UNC?" The perspiration over the line was tangible, though Ohlendorf could not find it in himself to partake in the stress.\n\n"That's correct, Weinmann. We can survive without them, but Leibbrandt cannot. All this means is that we have failed to deny a power player his power. So it goes."\n\n"'So it goes?' What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"\n\n"It means there's no point in stressing out over anything. Keep working at the other parties. We only have so long to seize control of this wreck of an administration, and if we want to have any chance of fixing it, we need to focus on what we can afford. Case in point. This little charade is starting to hit its crescendo, and I need my men prepared for when this timebomb goes off. How have preparations progressed?"\n\nA sigh echoed over the telephone lines. "It has progressed as expected, and no better. At this rate, to expect improvement beyond expected numbers would be madness.""

Shandruk's hand dripped with sweat as it grasped the phone.\n\n"Then I can depend on your support, if you can depend on mine, Shandruk?"\n\n"Yes, sir." Shandruk could hear the thin smile split Ohlendorf's mouth. Looking back to the rest of the UNC's more prominent members, he let out a sigh, placed the phone on the receiver, and his head in his hands.\n\n"How has it come to this?"\n\n"Do not let the situation deceive you, Pavlo. You know Leibbrandt isn't keen on what's best for us, Ukraine. Otherwise, he'd have done more for us. Don't lament this. We should celebrate it!" The room remained silent. Seconds passed, and the collab slunk into his chair. Lifting his head out from his hands, Shandruk looked around those who surrounded him. He could feel it now; Ohlendorf dialing Weinmann, telling him of the great victory he'd managed to strike down Leibbrandt. Good lord, what would become of the UNC? He could already feel his teeth being pulled out as the dreariness hung heavier over the room. Siding with Ohlendorf was nothing but a temporary measure- a stopgap solution to Leibbrandt's move with Kozhevnikov. Perhaps they would receive a better deal today, but what of tomorrow?\n\nThe phone rang again. Shandruk reached out for the phone and placed it next to his ear. "Hello?""

Storming the UNC would be a simple operation- with more loyalists. Given the circumstances, we will need to utilize some of our more radical members, but that is a risk we are more than willing to take." Ideological instability always seemed to be the greatest risk to operations like these. This could be like an ideological bomb if people like Nosske found out about it, not to mention what would happen when a hundred SS-men locked themselves in a building with Ukrainian Nationalists.\n\n"Then we strike during the debates? Take them hostage? Leibbrandt will see this as nothing but a blank check for murder, and this is his best chance to cash in. You'll burn at the stake." Ohlendorf's face hardly shifted as his warning echoed through Weinmann's head, even as a slim grin formed around Weinmann's ears.\n\n"I assure you that these... soldiers may be motivated more through the Black Sun than the Hooked Cross, though they are more than prepared to keep the UNC under our grasp." Weinmann's grin widened to a smile, still barely perceivable. The silence in the room returned, and for hardly a moment, Ohlendorf imagined hat he was alone with his work once more. That the shelf and desk of paperwork, the barren walls, the firm oak door were his only accomplices. Another moment more, and he could return to that world.\n\n"Then you will succeed in stalling this catastrophe, is that right?"\n\nWeinmann snickered.\n\n"Herr Oberst-Gruppenführer?""

Outside, they marched along dirt roads in columns, children in their arms, quiet against the deafening noise of loudspeakers and roaring trucks. Other men watched in uniform, guns drawn. They forced the families out of the city, into the freshly harvested fields just outside. Some lived. Some died. None returned.\n\nThe other men, the men in uniform, stayed in Zbarazh. They stayed to rummage, running through the city's innards in search of anything the Reich might value. Some, little men with notebooks, marked down everything of "cultural import."\n\nAnd as the other men left, they began a great fire, one which roared greater and greater until all was embers and dust and nothing."

"Why did they put you in here?"\n\n"The scum put me in here for the crime of wanting to be free." He returned to wistfully stare at the mud-covered floor. "I still long for that day, but I don't know if it will ever come."\n\n"There's always a romantic." The questioner offered up a lone mirthless chuckle to a silent audience. "What about you? You've got scars."\n\n"I was in a village occupied by those damn communists. When the Germans returned, they said I was 'infected with Judeo-Bolshevik teachings' and that 'work would set me free'." He returned the interrogator a quizzical look. "But you, why did they put you here? To rat on us?"\n\n"They said I talked too much-" His answer was interrupted by the halting of an engine, followed by the stomping of jackboots.

Even as they try to garner favor, all Ukrainians look at that cold, grey concrete with nothing but emotions ranging from disdain to barely contained contempt, even the men who work within it; unmotivated, weak-willed men trading their dignity for a few extra crumbs.\n\nYet, on that fateful morning, as bureaucrats and workers were to punch their cards, they found themselves unable to against a mass of black uniforms met alongside a tide of grey, a ten-meter no-man zone laid in between as police and military stared off, hands gripping their weapons as if waiting for the other to other to drop their gaze for even a moment before striking a killing blow.\n\nShandruk's car had barely parked on the sidewalk before an officer greeted him with a curt salute. "Shandruk, sir."\n\nShandruk saluted back, asking him to stand down, with the officer complying as he adjusted his hat."The SS have barricaded off the UNC headquarters.

Protests were outside, with officers and bureaucrats screaming a barely comprehensible mumble of words to a stoic, unfeeling Battalion standing across them, with expressions of barely held contempt.\n\nThose raised lips, cold gazes, a superiority that boiled his blood. He saw the writing on the wall, a contempt that almost begged the crowd to turn violent with a shower of rapid-spitting lead. Shandruk slammed his car's door with more strength than necessary, both to calm himself and to alert the crowd of his presence. They turned to him with a varying array of expressions, ranging from relief to barely restrained anger; the battalion didn't even give his presence the time of day.\n\nTake long, self-assured steps.

"To the council before me, I bring you the warning signs of a weak nation. We saw it in Kiel, in the dying days of an Empire. We saw it in Germania, around the tomb of the Reich's greatest hero. Now, we see it in Kiew, as soldiers strike the pillars of government. This cannot be tolerated. The UNC requires justice - nay, the nation requires justice for the events that have occurred over these last few days. We must see that Weinmann - the seditious minister who cast these orders - be investigated for his crimes. And we must know-" Leibbrandt turned to look at Ohlendorf -"who might have joined in his treachery."\n\nEvery opposing faction waited for someone to stand up, to speak out against what Leibbrandt had said. Many reformists and hardliners refused to clap, staring off into the distance or talking amongst themselves. Yet none, even Ohlendorf and Bräutigam, dared stand. For behind them, they could hear the bulk of the audience clapping, see them stare vacantly at the mouth of their leader. Behind them sat exiles, enraptured by the words of their leader, filled with a near-cultish dedication to his vision.\n\nAnd they could see what that council might do to anyone who asked it to question its leader."

For a council member as junior as Hans to speak at a meeting was unorthodox. For him to interrupt a member of the trio was unheard of.\n\nFrom the back of the room, Erwin Weinmann clapped with a bemused smile. Enraged, Hallstein turned to the SS commander. "Don't you dare consider yourself above this! Your actions are no more loyal than our supposed leader. You are a coward - and justice should come to you as well as him!" Hallstein turned to the Council as a whole. "I say that both of these men should be investigated for treason!"\n\nThe day did not end with Hallstein's outburst. Far from it - the debate continued long into the evening, with vile remarks flung across the room from all sides. But slowly, the council agreed that an investigation of both men might be necessary. The exiles saw it as a net gain. The hardliners saw it as a roadblock to be pushed past. Only the reformist walked away truly victorious - and with a new hero in their midst."

The council was waiting to hear an SS man speak - Erwin Weinmann would be the first to deliver.\n\n"Leibbrandt cannot be trusted. He has failed the Reich, content to sit with the pigs instead of throwing them back to the sty. When even his puppets would not follow him, he broke the procedures of this council to force them to his side. We must investigate him for his every malfeasance, and prepare for his necessary removal."\n\nThe crowd cheered at this, almost mechanically, drowning out the pitiful boos from the exiles and reformists. Bräutigam, horrified, stood to oppose him. "And yet your actions are justified?"\n\n"Yes," Weinmann responded bluntly. "I have done no wrongdoing. My actions merely prevented Leibbrandt from forcing through . And besides, I am battling against vile liberalism at every corner - like you, Bräutigam."\n\nThe council erupted at this statement. But slowly, in the hours of fighting that followed, the hardliner voices only grew louder and stronger, while exiles and liberals were crushed by the pressure.

"Heerema is out of the office," she said, but she wouldn't elaborate. The secretary, first in a happy chirp and later in a frustrated mutter, claimed he was unavailable, and would not be returning that day, that week or that month.\n\nFinally, out of options, Bräutigam pleaded to at least know why.

If only he'd pick up.\n\nFinally, an answer - the businessman gave a dull hello. Heerema sounded flippant, even a little bored, but he was here. Good enough.\n\nNo time for pleasantries - the minister wasted no time explaining his plan. Heerema simply needed to get himself and his fellow industrialists to publish a letter, claiming the actions of both Leibbrandt and Ohlendorf were criminal and thus both should resign their posts. It wouldn't convince either, of course - both men were too self-interested to consider resignation - but it would get the Security Council to consider alternative candidates for the job.\n\nBräutigam waited, hearing only the crackle of the receiver.

Every once in a while, Kozhevnikov would allow himself to sneak a look at the bastard's corner of the hall, and every time he did it he could feel them growing more uncomfortable in their seats - some even seemed invested in what the men on stage had to say. Taking another glance, Kozhevnikov noticed Ohlendorf stared back with what could be best described as murderous intent, the man's squint portraying enough anger to bake the whole stage in front of him. Kozhevnikov did his best to ignore it as the final testimony came to a close, though could not ignore the fact that he was having knives stared at him.\n\n"With that, we call for recess to allow for deliberation on the part of the jury. Court is dismissed."\n\nEven then, as the typical chatter within the crowds began to rise up as per usual, Kozhevnikov could detect the tone around him; Ohlendorf was practically a hanged man as it stood, and Weinmann was nothing more than a foregone conclusion.

Ohlendorf had grown restless in his seat, everyone could see, and Ohlendorf knew that everyone knew, and so on. Sitting in his padded seat, Ohlendorf had grown nearly mad with desperation for the testimonies to end; constant criticism without a chance of defense seemed to have that sort of effect on him, not that he would let anyone know it. Criticism of his actions he could take, but criticism of his ideals from men that would agree with him any other day was what infuriated Ohlendorf. It seemed, however, that things were mercifully coming to an end, as the last testimony was due for presentation.\n\nAs the man sat down, his testimony began exactly as all the others had, but Ohlendorf immediately felt himself nearly thrown out of his seat, and everyone in the room with half an eye on Ohlendorf didn't know why, but only for the shortest of moments. Looking into the man on the stage's eyes, hearing his voice, how exactly they enunciated some words over others, it was clear; this man hated Liebbrandt just as much as he did Weinmann.

What Ohlendorf would do to their UNC they did not know, which stood as the foundation of their alliance, though Ohlendorf felt little remorse for acting in the Reich -and its people's- best interests.\n\nAs the rest of the crowds in the hall had silently grown impatient with the lack of testimonials -and paired with the growing smug look on Ohlendorf's face which seemed only worse as he seemed to earnestly be trying to tone it down- Bräutigam walked onto the stage with the sort of uneasy gait that could be expected of a man caught without a script in a time he so desperately needs one.\n\n"Gentlemen, it is with great disdain that I am to report that the UNC has denied testifying outright."\n\nInstantaneously, the hall erupted into outrage and anger, and almost all of it directed at Ohlendorf's corner of the hall."

When the German trucks had pulled into the village, she'd immediately gone and hid under her bed like she'd practiced so many times before. Yet now here she was, hands held out as the German soldier handed her a slice of bread. She knew the war was over, her mother had told her. But hadn't it been the Germans who had stopped her from eating? That was what Mama had said.\n\nOne of the soldiers pulled out a box to stand on, and began to address the growing crowd. His words, of course, meant little to young Oksana, a foreign tongue she had not yet come to learn. As his message ended, she pulled on her mother's arm, "Mama, what did the man say?"\n\n"Nothing important darling." How could Anastasia tell her daughter? That her boogeymen had suddenly turned on their heels and decided to play nice? The soldiers stood there acting like samaritans, as if they hadn't been murderers just a few days before. The mother and daughter quickly set off for home with their food, eager to get away from the disturbing atmosphere.\n\nAnd as they arrived home, food in tow, the hunger of the last few months lingered. The empty seat to Oksana's right, the memories of her brother's skeleton-looking body, flashed through her mind."

 UKR_Leib_Bureaucracy_Descs:0 "As Ohlendorf stood to make what everyone knew would be his last argument, there was a collectively held breath as he began. If there was a time for Ohlendorf to make his case, his last chance for power and to deny Leibbrandt his rightful place, it would be now. Leibbrandt himself waited patiently, wondering what card Ohlendorf would play.\n\nHis hand was revealed, and it was weak.\n\nOhlendorf attempted to make the argument to the Council for Leibbrandt's removal, arguing that he had betrayed and weakened the nation - but Leibbrandt saw his words rang hollow before the Council, and Ohlendorf seemed to know it. His words held a tinge of exhaustion; one from a tired man who had nothing left. He knew the connections Leibbrandt had made, and that his appeal was the last act of a desperate man.\n\nWhen he returned to his place, the Council broke for a few minutes, before reconvening to hold the vote. One by one, the votes were counted, and a small smile grew on Leibbrandt's face. When the vote finished, the speaker rose to read the verdict. "This Council finds the charges of Georg Leibbrandt groundless. Conversely, we consider the charges against Erwin Weinmann sufficient, and he shall be immediately removed from his position."\n\nWell, that was it.\n\nLeibbrandt allowed a small exhale of relief to escape, pleased and proud of what had been achieved. The Rosenberg supporters had come through for him, all as he had planned. Every single connection forged, and deal struck, had allowed this moment to come to fruition. Once more, he had demonstrated his ability to lead the nation was unchallenged.\n\nOne more obstacle removed before Ukraine was fully his, and all who stood in his way were cowed - or removed."
 
 UKR_Leib_Collabs_Descs:0 "The weight of the day's vote bore heavy on everyone's mind, the power plays of the previous months coming to an ugly head. Both Leibbrandt and Ohlendorf knew the council still held little sympathy for either of them, and now was their last and only chance to secure their positions. All that stood between each of them and their immediate goals was the vote of a few councilmen, and they set out to achieve just that.\n\nOhlendorf finished making his appeals to the council, yet the unforgiving stares he was met with told him all he needed to know. He had tried and failed to convince them his actions had been solely for the "stability of Ukraine", protecting her from certain "decadent snakes" in her leadership. As Leibbrandt picked himself up to make his speech, he knew he had not yet won however - he still had a speech to make.\n\n"Gentlemen, we have all heard the ramblings of the madman who would see this council turned into a puppet of the SS. It is clear that the only correct course of action is to excise this rot from the government - we must do no less than immediately relieve Obergruppenführer Weinmann of his post, and try him for treason against the state." At this certain murmurs broke out within the council, shifting eyes and allegiances as Leibbrandt's speech continued. "When dealing with a cancer such as this, we must be swift and merciless with our actions, lest it overtake us all. An example must be made, before an example is made of us." Leibbrandt paused, gauging the councilmen's reactions. "I trust you will all make the right decision".\n\nWhat felt like an eternity passed, before the final vote was called for. And yet the councils' mind had perhaps already been made, knowing fully well Leibbrandt's power base was growing and not wanting to back the wrong horse. "All in favour of the dismissal of Obergruppenführer Weinmann, for treason against the Greater German Reich?"."
 
 UKR_Leib_Neither_Descs:0 "Leibbrandt shuffled in his seat nervously, his foot tapping against the cold, hard floor. The council chambers seemed much larger today, the ceiling stretching further out of reach. The importance of today was unquestionable - the vote would be held on Weinmann's dismissal on grounds of treason, deciding whether all his work up till now had been for naught. Statements had been made, discussion had been held, and now came the dreadful waiting.\n\nAs the council deliberated more and more, one thing became clear - no one was happy with Leibbrandt. And yet, what better choice did they have? Convicting him would only lead to more chaos, more divisiveness, more suffering. What Ukraine needed now was a strong leader, but Leibbrandt was not that. However, he had already entrenched himself much too far into the state to be removed, forcing the council's hand. Removing him at this late stage was no longer an option.\n\nAfter an eternity, the vote finally came. Reluctantly, the men one by one threw their support behind Leibbrandt, convicting Weinmann in the process. Barely maintaining his composure, Leibbrandt shot up out of his chair in celebration - and a tinge of . Despite it all, he was still hanging on to power by a thread, leaving Ohlendorf pouting in the corner at his defeat."

He had watched the council deliberate for hours, immune to exhaustion as he smirked in satisfaction at the heaps of evidence that were revealed to the public eye. Leibbrandt and Weinmann would not escape justice, and he would happily relish in their inevitable demise. They were relics of a barbaric, unenlightened legacy, one that Bräutigam would unravel at the earliest opportunity. He scanned the room of weary bureaucrats and councilmen before making his final strike.\n\n"Gentlemen, it has become painstakingly clear that the status quo has failed us. Our leaders have squandered our great nation's glory in favor of their own petty pursuits, regardless of how it spits on our legacy," Bräutigam opened carefully. Alienating his allies would be a surefire way to clutch defeat from the jaws of victory. "The squabbles of old will not end unless decisive action is taken to remedy ourselves of slovenly rot and decay. It is not the German way to hang onto the past, but to seize the future and mold it to our liking!" Bräutigam hung onto every word, and the tired crowd became reinvigorated by his fiery words. Those enraged by his conduct were drowned out by cheers of support.\n\n"I promise to chart a new course for the Reichskommisariat, one that will establish stability, one that will cleanse the administration of corruption, one that will guarantee prosperity for a hundred years!" Sweat dripped from his face, but he was too euphoric to notice. Ukraine would be under his stewardship, and only a simple vote stood between him and greatness."
 
 UKR_Braut_Industry_Descs:0 "If anything was plentiful in the council besides barbed words and tense suspicion, it was money. Cash flowed like rivers behind the scenes as bribes were paid out behind the scenes to tip the scales in Bräutigam's favor. The industrialists were the source of this fountain of wealth, with Heerema taking the largest stake in the entire operation, and one could only wonder what favors they would extract from the boyish bureaucrat for aiding him in the stunt.\n\nBräutigam himself did not morally approve of the plan. His skin crawled as he engaged in the very acts he deplored, but no other option could guarantee his success. Money was only a temporary inspiration, something that would keep the councilmen in line for the present until they demanded more, or worse, turned to Bräutigam's enemies for a better payout. He was convinced it was all for the greater good.\n\nDeliberations came to an end, and the vote for Leibbrandt and Weinmann's verdict began. It was a quick affair as Bräutigam watched the scores of men in his pocket cast their votes. The outcome was all but preordained: Leibbrandt and Weinmann were found guilty and were to be removed from their positions."
 
 UKR_Braut_Neither_Descs:0 "Rarely ever did Bräutigam's ambitions go according to plan, but even he could not foresee the train wreck that lay before him. Hours of debate did not dislodge the council from its state of cutthroat gridlock, with factionalism triumphing decisively over rationality, leaving Bräutigam with a throbbing migraine that worsened with every passing minute. Victory was a fleeting possibility, one he would have to fight tooth and nail to achieve. The young lawyer shambled to the podium, preparing one last defiant speech for the rowdy crowd that lay before him.\n\n"Gentlemen, I urge you to listen to reason before this council degenerates into a den of mongrels reduced to their baser instincts," Bräutigam said with a strained tone. "While not all of our disagreements can be addressed today, there is one that must be resolved before we are all consigned to oblivion." Bräutigam's irritated tone echoed across the hall, where it was met with grumbles and jeers, but he continued unabated. "The mismanagement of our military has left it suspicious and disloyal of the administration. Should nothing change, then civil war is inevitable, and everything we've done here is for naught." The opposition to Bräutigam's speech coalesced into a discordant string of insults, and he rushed to finish his speech.\n\n"It is the rational, and correct, choice to maintain unity. To do otherwise is to allow all of our efforts to be erased because of pure spite," Bräutigam swiftly left the podium and returned to his seat. He could only hope that the verdict would be in his favor. After a long, suspenseful voting period, Bräutigam got what he wanted.

UKR_Ohlen_Bureaucracy_Descs:0 "To watch over these crowds of people, all clamoring and hollering over one another, Ohlendorf felt a pang of a reminder of exactly where he was- he was a politician, nothing more, nothing less. Looking to the mass of bureaucrats and representatives, as he spoke on and on, Ohlendorf found solace in a growing crowd within the crowd, silently looking to him, quietly listening to what he had to say. Those staying silent with vitriol pouring from their mouths as soon as given the chance made themselves clear, sharing the rat-faces of those partisans Ohlendorf had the misfortune of meeting. Those that quietly observed Ohlendorf, however, brought him back to his days of teaching economics with his old friend, Jens Jessen. Better times, perhaps.\n\n"...Even now, the übermensch has hardly held onto power as it stands. Leibbrandt's administrative capabilities have proven themselves again-" Ohlendorf slammed his fist into the practical altar to prove his point "-and again. We have seen this so-called 'Reichskommissar' turn this colony from a proud achievement of the Reich- my achievement, into a blustering, rotting, corpse that only the true Aryan could save!"\n\nThe crowds erupted into chaos, some jeering at him, others cheering. Stepping down from the podium, watching Bräutigam step up, Ohlendorf noticed the buzzing emotions around him- and not a moment too soon, either. "All those in favor of convicting Liebbrandt of the aforementioned crimes, raise your hand."\n\nLooking around himself, Ohlendorf felt as though he was at Nuremberg once more. It seemed as though the entire hall had its hand raised, save for some collections of pencil-necked Jews-in-sheep's-clothing. Ohlendorf smiled. He knew he'd had the rats beaten."

UKR_Ohlen_Military_Descs:0 "It was time to bring this charade to an end. This was not precisely the way that Ohlendorf had wanted this to happen, but he was not one to risk uncertainties when the stakes were this high. When the bureaucracy wavered, the military would not. As the Council took their seats, they froze in place.\n\nMarching boots sounded through the halls like drums as dozens of SS soldiers entered the Council chambers, paying no attention to the slack-jawed faces of the Councilors as they took positions throughout the chambers. They said nothing. Everyone knew to whom they answered.\n\n"What is this madness?" Leibbrandt demanded in an almost shrill voice. He turned to the Wehrmacht officer who was in attendance. "Remove these men from the chambers immediately!"\n\nThe officer instead looked towards Ohlendorf, who nodded once. "This is a safety measure, sir," the officer said. "I assure you, the Council will be protected until the end of the session."\n\nThe soldiers shut the door to the chambers, and stood before it. Leibbrandt's face grew paler, and Bräutigam had stiffened in his chair. Both men then understood that there was only one man in control now - and it was Otto Ohlendorf. "Now," he said, as the SS loomed ominously over the seated Councilors. "We can begin."\n\nHe ensured that there was no wasted time. This was not a debate, but a trial - one that would result in the needed conviction. The fate of Leibbrandt was sealed before a single vote was counted - and when they were, the result was unanimous.\n\n"This Council finds Georg Leibbrandt guilty on all charges," the speaker read out in a trembling voice. "He is to be immediately expelled. Officers, please escort Mr. Leibbrandt out of the chamber.""

Yet the events of the day truly and utterly were beyond him. As he watched the Security Council vote, that thought endlessly ringed in his head - this all made no sense at all.\n\nIn his mind, getting the Security Council to take his side was a matter of convincing the bureaucracy, or getting the security forces to put together enough of a united front in their testimony that contradicting them would seem improper. Yet he had failed at both. Ohlendorf had both failed to find allies within the police, the agency which he quite literally operated, and within the bureaucracy in which he was the only moderate figure.\n\nThere was no other possibility - the Security Council appeared to simply be taking the collaborators at their word. That very thought was sickening. That this entire group could have gone along with the words of a race which had betrayed their nation just a year before... it truly seemed to betray their every principle.\n\nTo Ohlendorf, it all lined up with concerns he had been having for years. How had Leibbrandt even managed to get this far? How had Bräutigam, a liberal who barely hid his allegiances, manage to con his way into relevance? How had the partisans managed to last until the sixties, why had Herr Koch been denied the promotion he so clearly deserved?

Upon his confirmation, Kozhevnikov's first decree was to send a few men in for a deep cleaning - and to toss out whatever effects proved unnecessary.\n\nThe first thing to go was Koch's portrait. The second was Melnyk's.\n\nNow, Kozhevnikov got to watch as his own portrait was placed upon his new desk. Leibbrandt had come along, as usual - it seemed this wonderful moment would be tainted by one of Leibbrandt's sermons. Something about these recent years had brought that side of the Reichskommissar to the forefront: half Aryan evangelist, half life counselor.\n\nLeibbrandt leaned over to him with something like a fatherly smile. "I am so excited to see you in this position, Kozhevnikov. I have worked so tirelessly to achieve this - to create a local Ukrainian government which understands the ways that Ukraine should be. And you - I dare say you have the kind of intelligence and dedication to rival Germany's finest thinkers."\n\n"I only wish to tell you this. Ukraine requires leadership, strong leadership. In the time of the Russians, the Tsar and his governors provided this; now, I will assist you in creating that world. Learn from me. As Chairman of the UNC, you have a responsibility to your Reich, your Reichskommissar, and your nation. I know you will not fail them."\n\nLeibbrandt put his hand on Kozhhevnikov's shoulder.

Sevriuk quickly let Leibbrandt into his home, already fully dressed and with a relaxed smile.\n\nAs Sevriuk walked Leibbrandt into his living room, he began a spiel. "Georg, my friend, it is good to see you once more - in your proper uniform, no less. From all of us in the UNC - we simply cannot thank you enough. You're what Kyiv needs - a German with a Ukrainian heart. And as for myself, all ideological divides aside, I hope you know I'll take whatever work you'll throw at me."\n\nLeibbrandt turned away to examine the apartment. "I wouldn't worry, Sevriuk - I'm here to provide good news to a trusted ally. You'll have a nicer place than this soon, I'm sure." he said idly, his eyes focused on Sevriuk's bookshelf.\n\n"I'd hope so!" Sevriuk said, leaning towards the Reichskommissar. "Men like myself enjoy a life of plenty. We need it - it sustains us, certainly. And I've had many years now to watch my fortunes... wither. I hope that with you, times will change."\n\nLeibbrandt did not turn from the bookshelf, but responded dryly:"

Today, he would speak as mechanically as ever, but his tone mattered little. In front of the Council, a captive audience, Leibbrandt would get whatever reactions he desired.\n\nHe began his opening speech in his usual fixed monotone. "Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the successes we have seen in the last months. A mountain of new information tells a story of a region, once near total collapse, quickly returning to the status of the Reich's breadbasket. The RKU has territorial control and food insecurity for loyal citizens of the RKU is falling rapidly."\n\nThe council began a loud, empty applause. Leibbrandt continued, spewing a glut of other well-chosen statistics, each followed by the same brief and forced reverie.\n\n"Now, for today's primary topic. The council before us was created as an irregular emergency provision, created without the order of the Führer. It thus falls to the Reichskommissar to decide its fate. The reality is simple: this emergency has seen signs of ending in every conceivable category, as I have shown you all today. As such, there is no longer a need for this body."\n\nThe council grew silent as each member reconciled with what their Reichskommissar had said. Then, a few of Leibbrandt's cronies began to clap, and then more. Gradually, the calculus began in each member's mind. Leibbrandt had won. There was no use in withholding applause now."

Hundreds of thousand were given hope.\n\nThat hope, however, withered quickly as our Reich started to face serious economic quagmires, leading to numerous families of Germans in our sphere of influence becoming dependent on the aid from Germannia or salaries for state employees.\n\nIf we wish to get our economy and nation back on foot and see them in all of their might, the current situation with the Volksdeutsche must change. As the history has proven, the social stability of the countries depend on how strong their middle class is, which consists of white-collar workers, owners of businesses, etc. They are the main drivers of the economic growth, and will ensure a stable socio-political climate in the country during even the times of worst struggles, as the Reich suffered after the death of our great Führer, Adolf Hitler.\n\nI believe that our vast territories in the East, with various natural resources, are the perfect base for the creation of the new middle class which consists of Volksdeutsche, leading to a drastic improvement of lives of our compatriots, as well as a boost to our economy. This is the direction we, as a nation, should be taking, and the one which shall lead Germany to times of even greater prosperity and power."

He was certainly an SS man, a fact which he was proud of and which granted him to his current position, but administration would mean using his other side - the part of his work that had been left ignored for so long.\n\nPicking up the phone, thoughts raced through his mind. It was the opportunity of a lifetime, and he was determined not to waste it as Koch had before him. He began dialing a number - Ohlendorf needed inspiration and support if he was going to work with the precision he required.\n\n"Hello Sicher -er- Reichskommissar Ohlendorf. What a pleasant surprise!"\n\n"The pleasure is all mine, Professor Jessen. You and I have much to discuss. The colony before me is a mess, a product of every mistake of the Reich, of the snakes in the late Führer's ear. This grand construction for the German people treats them as barely better than the Untermenschen! It is a travesty." He paused his impromptu speech to breathe, "We need a new class for the Aryan people, one below that of the party but well above that of the Slavs."\n\n"On that we are in agreement my old friend.

The official reasonings were always the same - lack of finances (which was, indeed, in place), lack of need, and so on. The real reason also stayed the same: Ohlendorf simply considered all these men useless. Weren't they the people who led the Breadbasket of the Reich and Hitler's one of the most prized conquests to the biggest bandit uprising it has seen since the West Russian War? Honestly, how did they even stay in the NSDAP?\n\nAfter Ohlendorf was over, he dialed the Reich Chamber of Economics, one of the most important financial institutions in Germany, where Otto once held a high office. The conversation was nothing but fruitful - RCE agreed to sending their men to replace some of the fired ones, especially in the Food and Agriculture Main Department.\n\nIt didn't seem as much, but with this, truly grand opportunities were opening up for Ohlendorf.

I had always imagined him as a contemporary, and often even a superior, but seeing him in this frail state made reality so clear. He appeared as an artifact of the past - broken.\n\nI saw his body largely out of obligation and curiosity, but in the moment, I could not refrain from judgment. In the privacy of these notes, I will be honest - I never felt any personal attachment to the man. He was, at best, slightly above mediocrity. He was never going to be equipped for the complexities of permanent administration. He was a man of action, of suppression, but he offered little in the way of a positive vision. He offered this land a whip, and nothing more.\n\nKoch's status was unfortunate, but it was also convenient. His passing would surely leave a gap in the Reichskommissariat, one which would make my own temporary role undeniably permanent. In many ways, he is the last reasonable candidate who could be placed ahead of myself. Yet in that bed, forced to rely on the mercy of nurses and caretakers, he hardly appears to be able to compete.\n\nI didn't take too much time in the same room with the former Reichskommissar - no purpose in waiting. I left him, leaving his weak body at the mercy of fate.""

UKR_epilogue.8.t:0 "A Dawn Over Decay"
UKR_epilogue.8.desc:0 "The sun rose over a broken city adorned with agony, hardship, and now, recent reconstruction. Its bright light managed to illuminate even the darkest corners of Kyiv. Yet, the vacant Reichskommissar's office rested as it did each night, only this time, it would not be burdened by its previous owner and his stolen knowledge. Today, its dormancy was interrupted by the hustle of boxes and feet.\n\nIts new owner, Hans-Otto Bräutigam, heaved an exceptionally heavy case of documents onto the desk before collapsing in the matching leather chair. He received news just after midnight that the office had been vacated and cleaned, and the business of reform could not wait past morning's start.\n\nAnd so the only topic on Bräutigam's mind as he had raced to the office was that Ukraine's suffering could not wait any longer to be alleviated. He pulled out a choice few documents he had drafted - recommendations and proposals on the Ukrainisation of the economy and guidelines for reconstruction - falling onto the desk.\n\nWithin hours, they would begin to be drafted into official documents, slowly but surely transforming from words into action. The industrial roars of machinery clearing rubble testified to his already quick progress, making room for an urban factory that would eventually house a new Ukrainian business.\n\nBräutigam knew that was just the beginning, the start of a more autonomous land. It would all be accomplished by his hand alone, for the good of the Ukrainian people."

UKR_epilogue.9.desc:0 ""We have a chance here, everyone."\n\nThe NOC's offices were still a little run-down, but Pieter Schelte Heerema had done his best to prepare their largest conference room for a meeting with his fellow corporate leaders - van Tonningen, Elias, Haighton. This was no ordinary meeting, no ordinary discussion. This was a grand gesture, a victory lap, meant to drum up confidence in his leadership and explain his perspective all at once. This dingy, once-great office was soon going to change history.\n\n"Hans-Otto Bräutigam, the new Reichskommissar, is favorable to our company's interests in a way that no prior administration ever has been. He is looking to rebuild, and he is looking to invest in us if that is what it takes. That means that at a moment where every economic institution is at its weakest, we will have an influx of cash. And I say we spend it."\n\n"If we take this money and buy up the companies who have been hit harder, we can built a new kind of economic empire. Should we play our cards right, we have the chance to build a conglomerate here, one which could rival Volkswagen, maybe even Krupp.""

UKR_epilogue.10.t:0 "The Ukrainian"
UKR_epilogue.10.desc:0 "Pavlo Shandruk was not an arrogant man, but his new office certainly held a kind of nostalgic opulence, filled with objects from governments long passed. As Oleg Shtul and Oleksander Sevriuk entered, they could see banners from the republic, photos of its membership together, and books of prose and poetry from Shevchenko to Nosenko. In one room, Shandruk had already assembled his nation.\n\nShandruk asked the two men to sit, and began. "I am grateful to be taking the role of Chairman from my esteemed friend, Herr Andriy Atanasovich Melnyk. He was a good man, one who served his country well even when doing so meant making unpopular decisions. He has brought us to this point."\n\nOleg Shtul and Oleksander Sevriuk both nodded, each focused in their own way. Shtul was respectful, poised, and leaned forward, taking in every word. Sevriuk was openly smiling, happy at the thought of what this new Chairman might offer him.\n\n"Yet I will not simply follow his path. The situation has changed - a new man heads the Reichskommissariat, and he is willing to allow us more freedoms than Koch or even Leibbrandt ever would. For one, I will end that infernal Horst-Wessel anthem immediately. This institution is meant to unite all anti-communist Ukrainians, and our goal - whether we say it or not - is to create an autonomous nation with the rights and dignities of any nation.""

UKR_epilogue.11.t:0 "Parting Shots"
UKR_epilogue.11.desc:0 "Night shadowed over Kyiv hospital, a skeleton crew was left to carry out routine procedures and to be on standby under the cover of lamplight, emergency power being relegated to the most critical functions. Thus, when Bräutigam made a surprise visit to see Koch, he was enthusiastically greeted by the most senior doctor available before he escorted him to the comatose once-Reichskommissar.\n\nKoch was surrounded by top-of-the-line German medical apparatuses keeping him alive, all under the watch for a bright fluorescent light left on for him. The doctor stood guard at the door while the new Reichskommissar entered to ostensibly mourn his predecessor, truthfully, his motives were less in the tradition of Christian forgiveness as he pulled up a chair to view him.\n\nThe brute lay there frozen in a coma - all the pain he inflicted upon the Ukrainian people had given him this, his retirement in the land he most hated. Koch's future would not involve him luxuriating in East Prussia - it would involve him rotting away as time marches on. Bräutigam leaned over Koch as if to whisper a final revelation.\n\n"This is it for you, this is what you deserve."\n\nThe present called to Bräutigam to say goodbye to the past behind and continue to the future. He gathered himself and walked out, leaving Koch and everything he represented to history. But he had one final request to make to the doctor before he left:"
