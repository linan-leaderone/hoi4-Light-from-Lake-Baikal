POLITICS_BOBODZHAN_GAFUROV_DESC: "Few are as loyal to socialism as Bobodzhan Gafurov. A well-known hardliner, he remained committed to communism even after the collapse of the Soviet Union and served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan. Initially a historian, he quickly rose to become the party's leader. Although Tajikistan broke away from the Soviet Union after it was ravaged by German forces, he still controlled another communist regime and sought to regain power.\n\nEven though the Western Russian Revolutionary Front and the Kazakh Red Army collapsed during the Western Russian War and its aftermath, Gafurov remained loyal to the revolutionary cause and maintained close ties with neighboring Kyzylorda. He knows that he is not well-versed in politics and may not be the best person to lead the country through this turbulent period, but he refuses to hand over his power to anyone else. This is not because he desires dictatorship, but because of his principles and beliefs: Gafurov has not found anyone within the country whom he considers worthy of passing on the burning torch of socialism, and thus he continues to hold onto power.\n\nNevertheless, the General Secretary's control is gradually weakening day by day. The members of the Politburo, the small governing body of the regime, are increasingly less loyal to their leader. Meanwhile, dissidents preparing to take control and overthrow this evidently failing system are gaining momentum. Gafurov's rule may soon come to an end."

POLITICS_BURINISO_BERDIEVA_DESC: "Born in 1927 in Panjakent, Buriniso Berdieva is a young female politician whose world was soon shattered by the upheavals of the 20th century. Many in her generation could easily be considered lost; in the devastation of World War II and the subsequent conflicts, many Tajiks felt they were entirely lost in the era they were born into. However, Buriniso rose above the turmoil.\n\nShe stayed in Tajikistan instead of fleeing to Kyrgyzstan or southern Afghanistan. The first Tajik-language periodical, 'Knowledge and Civilization,' was written by her publishing house. This was not only a way for ordinary Tajiks to stay up to date with the rapidly changing times, but it also provided another common point to unite the Tajik people. Therefore, it is not surprising that she is regarded as the mother of this young nation in some respects.\n\nWith the completion of the democratic revolution, Buriniso faced difficulties; despite the conservative tendencies of the people, she found herself elected as the head of state of Tajikistan. Her task was simple yet grand: to build the nation and its civic spirit, to revive Tajik culture, and to ensure the nation's inviolability during this time. The road ahead for Buriniso will not be easy, but the road ahead for Tajikistan has never been easy; now, she will bravely face the challenge, as will her people."

TAJ_flooded_streets_desc: "To describe Tajikistan as exhausted would be an understatement. The people are worn out, and doubt fills the streets. With both socialism and the war against the Afghans ending in similar failures, the government has suffered a great loss of trust.\n\nAnger and discontent have flooded the streets like a river. The regime is doing everything it can to stop the tide of anger, but it is becoming increasingly clear that there will be consequences; it's only a matter of what kind and when."
TAJ_fading_economy: "Fading Economy"
TAJ_fading_economy_desc: "Looking around the globe, Tajikistan has only two trading partners. Nestled deep in the heart of Eurasia, Tajikistan is remote and isolated, and with the embargoes from Iran and Afghanistan, only Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan remain as trading partners.\n\nThey know our desperation, and they have negotiated accordingly. Tajikistan is ravaged by famine, and its economy is worsening by the day, withering like a vine without water. Something must be done, but the options are few."

 POLITICS_MAWLAWI_HINDUSTONI_DESC: "'Hindustoni' - or Hindustani, an ephithet given to Muhammadjon Rustamov, who left Central Asia during the Bolshevik revolution to continue his studies of Islam first in Afghanistan and then in India (sometimes referred to as Hindustan). Such an education has but redoubled his determined faith and resolve to maintain the old ways in his home country, as they have been for decades prior.\n\nIf the titanic catastrophe that has befallen the people of Tajikistan is indicative of anything, it is only the side-effects of their previous trial's completion. Decades of godless communism and oppression were the test for true believers, and those who have remained steadfast and firm can now carve a truly Islamic state from the ashes of that which was always damned to collapse. Islam was never the movement of radicals or extremists - it was and is the faith of those quiet, determined men who can withstand persecution from all quarters and come out as faithful as ever.\n\nNow, Hindustoni stands as the guarantor of the Islamic State of Tajikistan - a moderate, conservative, traditionalist nation founded on those ideals that have served the Tajik people so well in the past. Getting caught in the heady winds of revolution or radicalism is a recipe for disaster - and so he will defend the nation against those winds until the fruits of slow, steady, and steadfast labour reveal themselves."
 POLITICS_NUSRATULLO_ABDULKHAKOV_DESC: "The Tajik people have been betrayed more times than anyone can count. First the Russians came dressed in gaudy Imperial robes, and squeezed the nation for all it was worth. Then, they came in the clothes of peasants, proclaiming the unity of the working classes and the triumph of the proletariat - but in the end their goals remained the same as before.\n\nBut when they fell, destroyed by the Germans in their hubris and frailty, it was the Tajik nations' brothers in blood - enslaved under the Afghan Kingdom - who came knocking once more for the riches of the land. The communists who knew how to lick the boots of Moscow's elites faltered and failed abysmally at serving the people in those dire times - how could they do anything but, having only ever served an alien master - and finally, the people have spoken. They will have naught to do with foreign masters or foreign ideologies.\n\nThey have chosen to raise as their leader Nusratullo Abdulkhakov - a true man of Tajikstan, who will unite under their banner all the Tajik people scattered as they are across the lands. Finally, for the first time this century, the people are ruled by one of their own, and the time is ripe for the nation to take its rightful place in Central Asia."
