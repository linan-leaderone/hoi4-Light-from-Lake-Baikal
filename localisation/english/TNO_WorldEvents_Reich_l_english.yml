 WORLD_REICH.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Reich's Last Conquest"
 WORLD_REICH.1.desc: "On the 19th of January, 1962, Eberhard Köllner became the first man to ever land on the Moon. While the space race has been a struggle between the Reich, Japan and the USA, and while the Americans had managed to put the first man in space, the Führer was proud to announce that the German landing firmly plants the Reich as the victor in the competition.\n\nA grand ceremony is planned in Germania to present Köllner and his fellow astronauts with the Iron Cross, and a week of celebration has been declared across the Reich.\n\nWhile terse congratulations have been sent from America and Japan, President Nixon has vowed that the United States would be the first to create a permanent mission on the Moon, and Japan shortly thereafter announced it would be the first to land on Mars."
 WORLD_REICH.1.a: "Has the Space Race been won?"

 WORLD_REICH.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Assassin Strikes at Hitler!"
 WORLD_REICH.2.desc: "News from Germany is sporadic at best. Information smuggled out of Germania reports that shortly after celebrations over the Moon landing settled, military units and several platoons worth of bodyguard units filled the streets and immediately put the city under martial law. Apparently, an assassin, which the Germans claim belonged to the Japanese Tokumusoukan, attempted to kill the Führer, but was stopped in his attempt by one of Hitler's personal bodyguards.\n\nAlready, reports of various other assassinations have surfaced. In the streets, the various military units nearly came to blows, as several units ordered each other to stand down and the chain of command fell apart. Suddenly, the Reich seems much weaker. Can the Germans maintain their New World Order when they can hardly handle themselves?"
 WORLD_REICH.2.a: "A house divided..."
 WORLD_REICH.2.b: "Oh no."
 WORLD_REICH.2.c: "What is this the meaning of this insolent accusation?"

 WORLD_REICH.3.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Hitler Names Bormann His Successor"
 WORLD_REICH.3.desc: "Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Tokumusoukan agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognize the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Martin Bormann.\n\nConsidered the most likely choice, the decision has been welcomed by the moderate and conservative elements of Germany, although the liberals and some elements of the military have expressed concern. With Bormann's commitment to staying the course of Nazism with only minor reform, Albert Speer, Hermann Göring and Reinhard Heydrich have criticised the choice as being certain to drive the Reich into an early grave."
 WORLD_REICH.3.a: "More of the same it would seem."

 WORLD_REICH.4.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Hitler Names Göring His Successor"
 WORLD_REICH.4.desc: "Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Tokumusoukan agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognize the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Hermann Göring.\n\nOne of the Führer's oldest allies and beloved uncle of the nation, Göring enjoys extensive support from the Nazi old guard and the Wehrmacht, a relationship which has caused many to reject the decision. Albert Speer, Martin Bormann and Reinhard Heydrich have all criticized the nomination, vowing to never allow the Reich to fall into the hands of a glory lusting warmonger."
 WORLD_REICH.4.a: "Is war on the horizon?"

 WORLD_REICH.5.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Hitler Names Speer His Successor"
 WORLD_REICH.5.desc: "Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Tokumusoukan agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognize the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Albert Speer.\n\nA highly controversial choice, Speer enjoys the support from the left-leaning members of the Reichstag and the liberal movement in Germany due to his advocacy of extensive economic and political reform. The decision has upset the more conservative elements within the Reich however, with Martin Bormann, Hermann Göring and Reinhard Heydrich each denouncing the choice."
 WORLD_REICH.5.a: "A new dawn for the Reich."

 WORLD_REICH.6.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Hitler Names Heydrich His Successor"
 WORLD_REICH.6.desc: "Following the recent attempt on the German Führer's life by a suspected Tokumusoukan agent, the pressure upon the Führer to name an official successor, and for the Reichstag to formally recognize the choice, has been steadily building. After almost a week of debate and speculation, Adolf Hitler today appeared on live television from the Reichstag and announced to the Reich that his successor would be Reinhard Heydrich.\n\nShock and outrage immediately consumed the Reichstag, with a quarter of the votes going against the nomination, and another quarter abstaining, the first non unanimous vote in its history. While some hail this as an end to hostilities between Germany and the SS, only few are so forgiving, with most viewing Heydrich as little more than a puppet of Burgundy as riots erupt across Germany in response."
 WORLD_REICH.6.a: "All is well under the Black Sun."
 WORLD_REICH.6.b: "My God."

 WORLD_REICH.7.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Adolf Hitler Has Died"
 WORLD_REICH.7.desc: "Tragedy has consumed Germany as the news spread first throughout the Reich and then the world. Adolf Hitler, Führer of Germany and victor of the Second World War, has died. Whilst the Führer's declining health had been speculated about for some time, the news has nevertheless left Germany in a state of complete shock. The Reichstag has announced that three months of mourning shall be held, and that the Führer shall be buried beside his late wife, Eva Hitler, with dignitaries from around the world invited to the funeral.\n\nWhile Germany mourns, internationally many are celebrating the death of the man held responsible for three decades of suffering throughout the world. Yet many international commentators fear what may now become of Germany, the Third Reich having already been embattled in a bitter power struggle over the rightful successor to the Führership."
 WORLD_REICH.7.a: "A day to remember..."

 WORLD_REICH.8.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The German Civil War"
 WORLD_REICH.8.desc: "In the wake of Adolf Hitler's death, the Reich has erupted into chaos. Despite the Führer's appointment of a legal successor, powerful factions within the Reich have taken up arms against one another with the interest of leading the nation in their vision. The nation is torn with entire garrisons ignoring orders from Germania and flocking to the successor of their choice. Though the gravity of the situation is not yet known, it is estimated that the Reich is either facing or already experiencing total collapse of central authority.\n\nThough not much is known about the fate of the Reich's eastern administrations, the sudden cessation of contact between Germania and her possessions has created speculation on if those regions too will find their fate. What is known for sure, however, is that the collapse of Europe's titan has thrown the continent asunder."
 WORLD_REICH.8.a: "The end of the Reich, surely."

 WORLD_REICH.9.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Hans Speidel Assumes Control of Germania"
 WORLD_REICH.9.desc: "With Germany having collapsed into civil war across the country, even at this early state of the conflict the toll both in terms of lives and destruction is rapidly becoming apparent. Yet it appears as though not everyone within the Reich is interested in taking part in this destructive war. In light of the collapse of the emergency council, Field Marshal Hans Speidel, best known for foiling the attempted SS coup during the West Russian War, today marched into Germania.\n\nOn the steps of the Reichstag, with respected war hero Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beside him, Speidel declared his neutrality in the conflict. The city of Germania will now be garrisoned by the forces of Speidel, Rommel and other generals loyal to their cause of neutrality, with a stern warning of an unshakable resistance should any side in the civil war attempt to attack the city."
 WORLD_REICH.9.a: "The hero we needed."
 WORLD_REICH.9.b: "More trouble in Germany."

 WORLD_REICH.10.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Karl Dönitz Seizes Crimea"
 WORLD_REICH.10.desc: "Chaotic news is spreading out of the Black Sea amid news of a marine-led coup having been launched against the local civilian administration by respected German war hero Karl Dönitz earlier this week. Serving as commander of the major Reich naval base on Crimea, Dönitz announced via radio that following the disgraceful and illegal seizure of the Reichstag by Hans Speidel, he had no choice but to renounce the authority of Germania.\n\nShock then erupted across the Reich, and the world, as Dönitz then openly declared for Martin Bormann. Immensely liked by the Kriegsmarine, many captains have since declared their support for Dönitz's actions and have vowed to join him at Crimea to ensure that the Kriegsmarine remains out of the hands of those who would utterly destroy the Reich."
 WORLD_REICH.10.a: "Troubling."

 WORLD_REICH.11.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Anti-Heydrich Pact Forms"
 WORLD_REICH.11.desc: "The German Civil War has taken many twists and turns, but this may be the strangest of them all. Earlier today, multiple contenders to the Führership have announced a temporary ceasefire between them in order to focus on what they have deemed "the largest threat to the Reich today" - Reinhard Heydrich and his SS.\n\nHeydrich and the SS, backed only by Heinrich Himmler, have made surprising gains in recent months despite their poor starting position and lack of political power or popular appeal. It appears that this has spooked the other contenders, whose forces now gather to put an end to Heydrich's armies. With Heydrich being a proud follower of both Himmler and his 'Burgundian system', it must be a relief to Germans everywhere that their leaders can at least agree on one thing - mutual hatred of the SS and what it stands for."
 WORLD_REICH.11.a: "Himmler's madness will not spread to our soil!"
 WORLD_REICH.11.b: "Let them come."
 WORLD_REICH.11.c: "Heydrich will handle this with ease."
 WORLD_REICH.11.d: "It could always be worse."

 WORLD_REICH.12.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Bormann Wins the German Civil War"
 WORLD_REICH.12.desc: "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Martin Bormann emerging as the victor. Having enjoyed extensive support during the civil war, many expected Bormann's victory to be the most likely outcome of this terrible conflict. Standing before the Volkshalle today, the new Führer promised the German people a swift return to the former glory of the Reich, promising limited reform to ensure such a conflict never need occur again.\n\nWith the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy, a weary populace and much of Europe still consumed by chaos however, the true future of the Reich remains uncertain. Yet with the great politician leading them, many remain hopeful that Bormann truly will be able to return stability to the Reich."
 WORLD_REICH.12.a: "Peace returns to Germany."

 WORLD_REICH.13.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Speer Wins the German Civil War"
 WORLD_REICH.13.desc: "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Albert Speer emerging as the victor. Once thought to have had too little support both from the military and the wider population to pose any real threat in the war, Speer today spoke before the Volkshalle as Germany's new Führer to vow a new era for the Reich.\n\nWhilst Speer has promised to make true on the economic and political reforms his supporters now expect to come, few suspect the next few months to be easy for the new Führer. Even should Speer be able to win over the German people and begin to heal the crippled nation, much of Europe remains consumed by a chaos many view Speer unfit to resolve. Yet with the country in ruins, many are thankful to at least have the Reich's great architect now in charge of rebuilding the nation."
 WORLD_REICH.13.a: "Peace returns to Germany."

 WORLD_REICH.14.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Göring Wins the German Civil War"
 WORLD_REICH.14.desc: "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Hermann Göring emerging as the victor. With much of the Heer and the Luftwaffe siding with Göring during the war proving to have been crucial to his success, the new Führer personally thanked the Wehrmacht during a speech at the Volkshalle today.\n\nWith Göring publicly advocating militaristic policies before the war, many now fear how deep the influence of the military may grow, and how long it may be before Germany finds itself in a new war. Yet with the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy and a weary populace however, the true future of the Reich remains uncertain. Whilst many may fear for the future however, many are now simply glad Göring's military might has brought peace today."
 WORLD_REICH.14.a: "Peace returns to Germany."

 WORLD_REICH.15.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Heydrich Wins the German Civil War"
 WORLD_REICH.15.desc: "The German Civil War, the most devastating and bloody conflict to ever consume Germany, has finally ended with Reinhard Heydrich emerging as the victor. Widely disliked by the German populace, it has been the might of the SS which has won Heydrich the day. Speaking before the Volkshalle, the new Führer denounced the decadence which had corrupted Germany, and vowed to remove all hints of degeneracy from the Reich.\n\nWhilst Heinrich Himmler has offered his warmest congratulations to Heydrich, the international response has been largely muted with deep concern for the future of Germany. With the nation in ruins, a collapsed economy, a weary populace and a Europe still consumed by chaos, many now fear what the rule of the secretive fanatical organization will have in store for the future of the Reich."
 WORLD_REICH.15.a: "Peace returns to Germany."

 WORLD_REICH.16.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Germany Restores Control Over Central Europe"
 WORLD_REICH.16.desc: "The Reichsprotektorat of Bohemia and Moravia, together with the Netherlands and Denmark, were the territories where Germanization proved the most successful. When Germany fractured, these territories entered a state of political upheaval, but in the end lands this close to the beating heart of the Reich couldn't be allowed to become a potential threat.\n\nAs such, it was no surprise when the new government in Germania decided to quickly move in and seize back such important provinces, especially the Netherlands with their trade ports, and Bohemia with its industrial core.\n\nWith friendly governments in Copenhagen and Amsterdam, and the total annexation of the Reichsprotektorat, the new Führer has secured control over Central Europe."
 WORLD_REICH.16.a: "Long live the Reich!"
 WORLD_REICH.16.b: "It seems the old lion can still roar."
 WORLD_REICH.16.c: "It was to be expected."

 WORLD_REICH.17.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]German Hegemony Returns"
 WORLD_REICH.17.desc: "At the beginning of the great civil war that ripped the Reich apart, many of the Reichskommissariats in the east broke free from Germania, due either to internal revolt or to the fact that the Reichskommissar was loyal to one of the defeated opponents to the new Führer.\n\nAfter the Bürgerkrieg ended, the weakened German nation was too devastated to even consider foreign expansion, and for a time it seemed that the swastika would never return to the bloodied fields of Eastern Europe.\n\nToday, however, marks a new beginning for the Reich. After a series of both military campaigns and diplomatic efforts, most of the former Reichskommissariats have returned to the fold of the reborn Reich. As the world looks in both awe and worry, one thing is certain: German hegemony has returned."
 WORLD_REICH.17.a: "Lebensraum is ours once more!"
 WORLD_REICH.17.b: "The swastika will fall, it's only a matter of time."
 WORLD_REICH.17.c: "It seems the Reich has returned to the world stage..."

 WORLD_REICH.18.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Germany Increases Presence in Indian Ocean"
 WORLD_REICH.18.desc: "As the Das Reich newspaper proudly informed their readers, the German Kriegsmarine recently conducted a series of large-scale exercises out of Mauritius and Réunion, previously a part of French Madagascar that was transferred to Germany following the insurgency there. After losing many of its belongings in Africa as the result of numerous military conflicts in the region, Germany has made a comeback in the nearby Indian Ocean, projecting its power against the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nThe Japanese representatives on the diplomatic arena took no hesitation to denounce the "act of the German aggression". Although Japan has not yet acted in retaliation, the incident is seen as a part of a tendency of deteriorating relationships between the two superpowers, exacerbated by the actions of Führer Martin Bormann."
 WORLD_REICH.18.a: "Wir lagen vor Madagaskar..."
 WORLD_REICH.18.b: "A disgraceful act!"
 WORLD_REICH.18.c: "How worse it can get?"

 WORLD_REICH.19.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]German Missile Deployment in Mauritius and Réunion"
 WORLD_REICH.19.desc_BOR: "Anxiety gripped the international public and the militaries of the world have been put on alert as the news arrived from the Indian Ocean. According to the American and Japanese reports, the German Reich constructed missile launch facilities on the islands of Mauritius and Réunion, thereby placing its nuclear warheads in a hotly contested area.\n\nHailed as a great strategical victory in Germania, the act drew stern condemnation from the Empire of Japan whose diplomats unequivocally warned about the possibility of a reciprocal action. The outcome of the German militarisation of the Indian Ocean remains uncertain, but it can be safely said that the incident led to an increase in tension comparable to the beginning of the Aleutians Crisis."

According to the American and Japanese reports, the German Reich constructed missile launch facilities on the islands of Mauritius and Réunion, thereby placing its nuclear warheads in a hotly contested area.\n\nHailed as a great strategical victory in Germania, the act drew stern condemnation from the superpowers whose diplomats unequivocally warned about the possibility of a retaliatory action. The outcome of the German militarisation of the Indian Ocean remains uncertain, but it can be safely said that the incident led to a record increase of tension since the diplomatic talks led by German foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt."
 WORLD_REICH.19.a: "A victory to remember!"
 WORLD_REICH.19.b: "This won't go unpunished!"
 WORLD_REICH.19.c: "The world hangs in the balance once again."

 WORLD_REICH.110.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Disappearance of Albert Speer"
 WORLD_REICH.110.desc: "Albert Speer has vanished. The former German Reichsminister-turned-Nazi exile has spent the last few years living in America after seeking political asylum. While many Nazis who fled the aftermath of the German Civil War sought to change their identity, Albert Speer instead published a book under his own name and conducted several high-profile interviews to increase its sales figures.\n\nAs of the early hours of the morning, Albert Speer has gone missing, and the American police are coordinating to conduct a nationwide manhunt. In a public statement, Germany's Foreign Minister Walther Hewel wished the Americans luck in their investigation and demanded that Speer be extradited to the Reich in the event of his discovery."
 WORLD_REICH.110.a: "Where is Speer?"

 WORLD_REICH.111.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Assassination of Albert Speer"
 WORLD_REICH.111.desc: "Albert Speer is dead. The former German Reichsminister-turned-Nazi exile had spent the last few years in America after seeking political asylum. While many Nazis who fled the aftermath of the German Civil War sought to change their identity, Albert Speer instead published a book under his own name and conducted several high-profile interviews to increase its sales figures.\n\nAt 11am in broad daylight, Speer was shot six times by a single gunman who allegedly shouted "Heil Bormann!" before leaping into the back of a nearby vehicle, which swiftly raced away. Speer was dead by the time the ambulance arrived. Germany's Foreign Minister Walther Hewel has refused to confirm or deny the involvement of Germany's Ordnungspolizei, instead labelling Speer a "treacherous dog who deserved his fate". The President of the United States has signalled his fury.\n"
 WORLD_REICH.111.a: "An insult to America."

 WORLD_REICH.112.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Eurasian Détente"
 WORLD_REICH.112.desc: "Surprising news has come out of both Tokyo and Germania today, via a joint declaration of friendship between the Superpowers announced this morning. Even during the Second World War, ties between the nations were already fraught and after the Atomic Bombing of Pearl Habor, the nations of the Tripartite Pact formally ended their alliance. With the onset of the Cold War, the former allies became rivals for influence and power all over the planet.\n\nNow it seems that rivalry has become just a short, unpleasant episode in German-Japanese relations, which are seeing a high not seen since the 1930s. As world leaders both within the German and Japanese Empires and without congratulate the thaw as a crucial step to ensuring global peace, international experts have noticed that Washington has been unusually quiet in their reaction to the news."
 WORLD_REICH.112.a: "To our brothers in Japan!"
 WORLD_REICH.112.b: "Long live Germany!"
 WORLD_REICH.112.c: "Let them come."
 WORLD_REICH.112.d: "Maybe peace is possible."
 
 WORLD_REICH.120.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Second Night of the Long Knives"
 WORLD_REICH.120.desc: "The black web of conspiracy ensnaring all elements of the Reich has been lit aflame by orders of the Führer Martin Bormann.\n\nReinhard Gehlen's Ordnungspolizei has been mobilized and tasked with crushing all dissent within the Reich. Conglomerates, Christian institutions, disloyal Heer factions and scheming Party bureaucrats alike are being cracked down upon in the largest political, social and cultural purge in recent German history.\n\nThe bullets will fire, the ropes will snap taut, and Bormann's throne shall grow larger still."
 WORLD_REICH.120.a: "Always one death away from utopia."
 
 WORLD_REICH.121.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The June of Deceit"
 WORLD_REICH.121.desc: "The black web of conspiracy ensnaring all elements of the Reich has torn the Führer Martin Bormann from his throne of power.\n\nDisloyalty within the Heer, the conglomerates and even the Party itself has come to a bloody head as an armed coup launches to overthrow Bormann and his allies.\n\nThe mastermind of the coup, Chief of the Party Chancellery Baldur von Schirach, looks poised to become the new Führer of the Großgermanisches Reich. The Germans have entered a new age."
 WORLD_REICH.121.a: "The wax wings have melted."

 WORLD_REICH.122.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Reichsminister Hewel Murdered"
 WORLD_REICH.122.desc: "Reports have been flooding out of Cologne, in the industrial heart of the German Reich, where just hours ago it was reported that Reichsminister Hewel, the German minister of foreign affairs, was found dead alongside his wife Blanda inside of a warehouse in a small town outside of the city. Mr. and Mrs. Hewel were reported missing two weeks prior to their discovery, after their home in an upscale Cologne neighborhood had been broken into.\n\nA terrorist group known as the Red Army Faction has taken responsibility for the killings, citing suppression and tyrannical action by Führer Bormann's administration as their justification. This turn of events has thrown the German Reich into turmoil, with weeks of violent protests across the Reich having been put down just days before the kidnapping of the minister and his wife."
 WORLD_REICH.122.a: "The German eagle falls ill once again."

 WORLD_REICH.200.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Königsberg Treaty Signed"
 WORLD_REICH.200.desc: "To wide international surprise, a diplomatic treaty between the Greater Germanic Reich and Republic of Poland has today been signed in Königsberg by Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt and Polish representative Stanisław Wachowiak. Included in it are the official recognition of the Polish as a people by Germany and a plan for repatriation of Polish slaves within the near future. In turn, Poland is to be administrated by a provisional government pending further negotiation and reintegrated into the Einheitspakt.\n\nHailed as a diplomatic miracle by many, large controversy nonetheless plagues the treaty as it does not address the status of the annexed territories of Poland and has been met with strong disapproval by reactionary NSDAP members and several Polish leaders. Large protests, both for and against the treaty, took place in both nations simultaneously."
 WORLD_REICH.200.a: "A second miracle on the Vistula?"
 WORLD_REICH.200.b: "Um Gottes willen, Schmidt, what have you done?!"
 
 WORLD_REICH.201.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Poland Usurped by the Wehrmacht"
 WORLD_REICH.201.desc: "To middling international reactions, the Republic of Poland has today surrendered to the Wehrmacht of the Greater Germanic Reich. Negotiated by Feldmarschalls Henning von Tresckow and Hans Speidel with the Polish government, the Reich excerted ever increasing pressure unto the rump state while promising to it freedom and prosperity, albeit under the German boot.\n\nAlthough international hopes for a German regime on a clearly liberalizing course have been dampened by this, it is nonetheless notable that this transition of power occured with no major violence or repercussions against the Polish people. While there is significant protest in Poland and the Polish diaspora, the solution appears to be stable. Depending on the next actions, Poland may just have a future."
 WORLD_REICH.201.a: "Perhaps not yet lost."
 
 WORLD_REICH.202.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Poland Falls to Germany"
 WORLD_REICH.202.desc: "To international shock, the Republic of Poland has been violently put down by the Wehrmacht of the Greater Germanic Reich, allegedly under order of Führer Albert Speer himself. Apparently a response to prior negotiations failing, the move is widely regarded as a censure in Albert Speer's self-image as the liberal reformer of the Reich. While the Wehrmacht has quickly moved to restore order and install an occupation regime actively trying to avoid further conflict, the situation in Poland has not been this agitated since the German Civil War.\n\nIt remains to be seen what Poland's fate is."
 WORLD_REICH.202.a: "The Führer is a liar!"
 
 WORLD_REICH.206.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]A Lighter Hand in the East"
 WORLD_REICH.206.desc: "After reasserting hegemony over the lands formerly belonging to the eastern Reichskommissariats, most expected the Reich to simply restore the old system, but it seems they were mistaken. In a move that left all astonished, the lands were reorganized into independent nations, led by formally free governments.\n\nWhile most agree that these new states are mostly comprised of collaborators, no one can deny that this is an important change. The Führer has immediately signed several treaties with the newly-established countries, which will surely benefit Germany.\n\nWith this new system, which most consider to be heavily influenced by the reformist wing of the party, German hegemony over Eastern Europe appears far more stable than under the old one."
 WORLD_REICH.206.a: "A sensible choice for a sensible government."
 WORLD_REICH.206.b: "An unexpected development, but a welcome one."
 WORLD_REICH.206.c: "It seems they have learnt their lesson..."
 
 WORLD_REICH.207.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]A Tight Grip in the East"
 WORLD_REICH.207.desc: "After reasserting its hegemony over the lands formerly belonging to the eastern Reichskommissariats, the Reich has decided to reorganize them into Reichslander, autonomous regions under strict surveillance from Germania. A native Reichsstatthalter, aided by a government mostly of their choosing, shall oversee a civilian administration, in order to ensure a tight grip over the territory, but a better administration compared to the excesses perpetrated by some of the old Reichskommissars.\n\nWhile this will probably mitigate the worst effects of German domination, most observers agree that it will do little to quench the burning hate the natives feel for their overlords, and they believe that an increased wave of partisan attacks is to be expected at the first sign of weakness from the government."
 WORLD_REICH.207.a: "Our rule is stronger than ever!"
 WORLD_REICH.207.b: "This new order, just like the last, is doomed to collapse..."
 WORLD_REICH.207.c: "Take the old system, use a new name: voila!"

 WORLD_REICH.208.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]'Sondergericht' in Germany"
 WORLD_REICH.208.desc: "In a bid to cleanse the NSDAP of disloyal members, Albert Speer, Führer of the German Reich, had begun the 'sondergericht', a special trial which saw several members of the party accused of a variegated list of crimes, from abuse of power to accepting bribes and even treason.\n\nAs a result of this, several democratic countries have protested against what had appeared to be a purge in disguise, but this didn't deter the government in Germania. After several months, Speer has achieved a double result: not only has he tightened his grip on the party, but the German people are also much more supportive of his regime.\n\nWith the public opinion once more in his favor, the Führer can now concentrate on more important matters."
 WORLD_REICH.208.a: "Those traitors got what they deserved!"
 WORLD_REICH.208.b: "A leopard can't change its spots..."
 WORLD_REICH.208.c: "A purge: how typical!"
 
 WORLD_REICH.209.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]NetzRAM Is Online"
 WORLD_REICH.209.desc: "After several years of preparations, repairs, tweaks and improvements, finally NetzRAM is online and fully operative. This new and incredibly advanced system, linking together all computers in the most important research facilities and government bureaus all throughout the Reich, allows for incredibly fast transmission of any sort of data, from text to images, dramatically improving coordination between the various institutions.\n\nWhile NetzRAM's main purpose is to help scientific research and increase bureaucratic efficiency, few doubt that the Führer will experiment with its use in the fields of military and espionage. After that, who knows, perhaps the system can be expanded and adapted for civilian use? Still, one thing is certain: with this achievement, the Reich has finally entered the future."
 WORLD_REICH.209.a: "The future is now!"
 WORLD_REICH.209.b: "Do we have a new rival for technological supremacy?"
 WORLD_REICH.209.c: "Incredible!"

 WORLD_REICH.210.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Students Riot in Nuremberg"
 WORLD_REICH.210.desc: "For the second time in recent memory, Germany's streets are alive with student protests. In the city of Nuremberg, the streets have erupted into chaos and violence in the wake of the shooting of famed Marxist revolutionary, Rudi Dutschke, by the Orpo.\n\nDutschke was a Marxist activist in what can be said to be the most anti-Marxist nation in all of history. For many, his death was seen as inevitable, if not a long time coming. What was not expected, however, was the general reaction to the killing.

Thousands have already been laid off and several businesses appear on the road to insolvency.\n\nEconomists were quick to note that the Reich's dependency on oil massively increased due to vast industrialization efforts under the Zollverein, particularly in Eastern Europe.\n\nFührer Speer has yet to publically react to this crisis.

Dmytro Klyachkivsky dismissed these rumors, declaring on the radio, "Ukraine is free of the malicious influences of the vile German, Russian, and Pole! Those who still serve the exploiters can reunite with them in death! Slava Ukraini, Heroiam Slava!" Only time will tell if the newborn Ukrainian State will rise above the flames or be buried in the ash.\n"

 # Germany goes nuclear (literally)

 WORLD_REICH.1599.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Germany Destroys Kiew"
 WORLD_REICH.1599.desc: "In a development sparking horror and outrage worldwide, Germany today used a nuclear weapon against the city of Kiew, killing or injuring hundreds of thousands. The decision to deploy overwhelming force against a city which Germany considers its sovereign territory reportedly emerged after the German military proved incapable of stopping a rebellion within the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Faced with a threat to German dominance and fears that instability could spread, the Führer took "extreme measures."\n\nWhile no statement from Germania is forthcoming, reaction elsewhere has been swift. OFN member-states issued a joint statement condemning "this act of unprecedented barbarism." An appalled spokesman of the Empire of Japan expressed outrage and informed press that the Empire would be re-evaluating its limited relations with Germany. Protests have roiled several European cities.\n"

 WORLD_REICH.1600.desc: "The German Reich's largest European territorial gain during the Second World War, the sudden disappearance of Reichskommissar Sigfried Kasche has now seemingly brought an end to Reichskommissariat Moskowien overnight. Following emergency talks between the German administration and Russian representatives in Moskau, an agreement to peacefully divide the territory has reportedly now been reached.\n\nThe latest development in the collapse of the German Reich, Moskowien had been one of the most troubled German territories since its inception, yet emerged as a beacon for reformists within the Reich for its experiments with native collaboration efforts following the West Russian War. Now, with the man behind the unifying efforts between the German and Russian populace gone, it appears the experiment has failed."

 WORLD_REICH.1800.desc: "As if the past several weeks could not get any more maddening, an even stranger turn of events has emerged in the Caucasus. Josias, hereditary prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont and the reclusive Reichskommissar of Kaukasien, has formally announced his already de facto severance of ties from the Greater Germanic Reich, in a rare public announcement transmitted through the Turkish consulate in Baku. Even more bizarrely was the fact that the man went as far as to proclaim a 'Kingdom of Kaukasia', crowning himself as King Josias I.\n\nThis message would have been dismissed as incredulous or an elaborate hoax, were it not accompanied by photographs of the coronation ceremony and an official regnal portrait of the new King. The world may have gone mad, but there is one thing everyone knows for certain..."
 WORLD_REICH.1800.a: "This man is the maddest of them all."
 WORLD_REICH.1800.b: "This man is an island of sanity."

 WORLD_REICH.2200.desc: "With the German Reich quickly becoming evermore consumed by chaos and warfare, the Nazi collapse has today claimed its next victim. Speaking before the Storting this morning, Norwegian Minister-President Gulbrand Lunde announced that his newly empowered government had been informed of the immediate resignation of Reichskommissar Josef Terboven and the dissolution of the Norwegian garrison, effectively marking the end of the German occupation of Norway.\n\nYet whilst many across the Reich attempt to escape from the warzones, it has been reported Terboven has instead flown back into Germany, along with a steady stream of Norwegian soldiers returning home to fight for their preferred side. Whilst the details behind these developments are largely unknown, one thing is for certain; Norway is now a free nation once again."

 WORLD_REICH.2201.desc: "Revolution has struck the Greater German Reich! As warfare grips Europe in its deadly embrace, Norway has experienced a drastic shift in leadership following a coup by Milorg.\n\nFor over two decades, this resistance movement has violently opposed the administration of Reichskommissariat Norwegen. To the forces of democracy, they are freedom fighters; to the supporters of national socialism, they are militant terrorists. What is indisputable is that this organization overran the city of Oslo, ousted the collaborationist rulers and established a new provisional government. Under the leadership and guidance of Knut Møyen, Norway has embarked upon the grand goal of transitioning to a functioning democracy once again."

 WORLD_REICH.2300.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Tremors Detected in Burgundian Soil"
 WORLD_REICH.2300.desc: "The Swiss Seismological Service has issued a press release with worrying news. Last night, their HQ in Zürich noted a seismological event somewhere in the Burgundian Jura that lasted four seconds and reached 4.6 on the Richter scale. Due to the lack of aftershocks, they concluded that this is "not natural activity, but likely a man-made incident." Several Swiss radiologists have also reported a spike in airborne radiation equivalent to a mild nuclear meltdown... or an atomic airblast.\n\nGovernments worldwide have arrived at one conclusion: the Burgundians have successfully tested a nuclear device, twice as strong as the one dropped on Pearl Harbor in 1945. With the shadow state remaining tight-lipped as ever, the news will likely never be confirmed. Still, it seems that [GetYear] will be remembered as a dark point in history: the year Burgundy ascended to the ranks of the nuclear powers."

 WORLD_REICH.2301.desc: "As the situation within Europe rapidly develops as the German sphere free falls into total collapse, many have wondered what if any move the secretive 'black state' would make. With recently leaked footage from Germany showing SS convoys moving into Burgundy, a border that has become one of the most militarized on Earth overnight, many observers declared this to be evidence that Heinrich Himmler had withdrawn support of Reinhard Heydrich's claim for the Führership.\n\nYet the true reasoning has now revealed itself. While the international community is still scrambling to make sense of the chaos, Burgundian tanks are now rolling into Paris and the French military, severely weakened by German sanctions, have either been forced into full retreat or had entire divisions destroyed wherever they dare make their stands."

 ## Burgundy Collapse
 WORLD_REICH.2302.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Collapse of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund"
 WORLD_REICH.2302.desc: "Information from Burgundy has historically been scarce, but news revealed by dissidents and refugees have revealed that the infamously secretive nation led by Heinrich Himmler is on the verge of collapse. According to them, Himmler is fighting his native SS Legions, along with the French Resistance.\n\nNations and observers around the world are closely watching as the situation develops. The United States has stated they are monitoring the situation, emergency meetings have been held, and the Pentagon has put soldiers on alert. Germany has not released an official statement, but eyewitnesses report similar meetings taking place, and troops being moved towards the German-Burgundian border. While the situation remains fluid, international experts believe that it is not a question of if there will be intervention - but who will do so first."
 WORLD_REICH.2302.a: "The end of the Shadow State approaches."
 WORLD_REICH.2302.b: "It all comes tumbling down."

 WORLD_REICH.2303.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The German Invasion of Burgundy"
 WORLD_REICH.2303.desc: "With troops and military equipment steadily increasing along the German-Burgundy border, and escalatory statements from German officials, many experts speculated that German intervention in the ongoing Burgundian collapse was certain. These beliefs were confirmed as German troops officially entered the collapsed Ordensstaat early in the morning, citing the need to secure their western border.\n\nBoth SS Legions as well as Himmler's forces have been targeted, confirming a suspected German objective of fully pacifying the region and eliminating the final SS stronghold in Europe. German officials have promised a swift victory, and while indications are that Himmler has attempted to reposition in a last attempt to hold out, most expect that the former Ordensstaat's days are numbered."
 WORLD_REICH.2303.a: "The black sun has set."

 WORLD_REICH.2304.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]German Control Established Over Burgundy"
 WORLD_REICH.2304.desc: "In the streets of Nord-Paris, German convoys and tanks, together with French soldiers march before a cheering crowd. Before a gathering of thousands, the Führer has declared the liberation of Burgundy from the tyranny of Himmler and the SS Legions, and praised the support of the French forces that played a crucial role in the liberation. Across the former Ordensstaat, French and German soldiers are welcomed as heroes as nation-wide celebrations take place.\n\nGermany and France have slowly begun releasing information concerning the conditions many were living in, which show widespread poverty, and the abuses of the SS without restrictions. While many of the newly liberated are grateful for the German intervention, the escaped dissidents have expressed their concern that one abusive master has been replaced with another. Only the future will determine if that fear will come to pass.\n"
 WORLD_REICH.2304.a: "Clouds hang over Burgundy."

 WORLD_REICH.2305.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The United States Intervenes in Burgundy"
 WORLD_REICH.2305.desc: "Hours after Germany announced their intention to intervene in the rapidly collapsing Ordensstaat, the United States, together with France have announced that they will also be deploying soldiers into the former Ordensstaat in support of the planned French reclamation.\n\nFrench soldiers have already begun limited incursions into the state as the United States war machine roars into force. Many Frenchmen are hopeful that they will be able to reclaim their lands, and do so before the Germans push deep into the country.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this intervention will allow the tide against the Masters of Europe to be changed, but both American and French officials appear willing to take the chance - even if some fear the intervention raises the risk of igniting a Third World War."
 WORLD_REICH.2305.a: "The French reclamation has come."

 WORLD_REICH.2306.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Paris Agreement"
 WORLD_REICH.2306.desc: "Many people across the world breathe a sigh of relief as Germany and the United States announced that they have reached an agreement regarding the territory of the former Ordensstaat. Both sides have agreed to demilitarize the borders, withdraw their forces to their respective nations, allow the French to establish control over their former lands.\n\nObservers have confirmed that soldiers and military equipment are rapidly departing Burgundy, and humanitarian aid from the Organization of Free Nations is pouring in, as each member nation has pledged support in helping rebuilding the nation. As the French begin the difficult task to healing from the trauma Himmler inflicted, the rest of the world relaxes, knowing that a crisis in Western Europe has been averted."

 WORLD_REICH.2307.desc: "Fears of war have been raised across the world as both German and American governments have denounced each other, and each angrily departed the negotiations surrounding the former Ordensstaat. Both nations have stated that they would not be departing Burgundy, and soldiers on both sides have been placed on high alert. Emergency meetings have also been called in Washington and Germania, though neither nation has commented on their nature.\n\nWhile neither side has committed to direct conflict, more men and equipment have been observed moving to supply each side. Leaked messages sent to the Pakt and OFN by their respective leaders warn of a "potential escalation" in coming days. With neither Germany or the United States willing to negotiate further, many fear that the crisis will only deepen in the coming - and risk dragging the world into another world war.\n"
 WORLD_REICH.2307.a: "Midnight draws closer."

 WORLD_REICH.2308.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]France Demands Territorial Restoration"
 WORLD_REICH.2308.desc: "As tanks roll through the streets of Nord-Paris, Germany has announced that it has secured control over the former Ordensstaat Burgund, and successfully eliminated Heinrich Himmler, the rebellious SS Legions, and the nascent French Resistance. They have declared the day one of liberation, and stated their intent to rebuild and restore the territory.\n\nThe French State, which did not intervene during the conflict, has also officially demanded that Germany "immediately return rightful French territory", though it was unclear what leverage they have to enforce this. There has so far been no response from Germany, though some sources have indicated that German and French negotiators have made contact. It remains unknown how these discussions will proceed."
 WORLD_REICH.2308.a: "The German price will be high."

 WORLD_REICH.2309.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Germany Returns French Territories"
 WORLD_REICH.2309.desc: "Celebrations have broken out across the French State, and the former Ordensstaat as France announced that Germany has agreed to return all rightful French lands to their possession. The French government has planned to hold a nation-wide celebration from Paris, as well as promising to fully restore, rebuild, and heal what was destroyed under Himmler's reign.\n\nIn a less-covered announcement, Germany also released a statement confirming that France would officially rejoin the Einheitspakt, which many are speculating was the price Germany demanded for returning French lands.\n\nWhile the newfound alignment between France and Germany has come as a surprise to some experts, few in France appear to care about the geopolitical implications. Their nation has been restored, and for that, they celebrate.\n"
 WORLD_REICH.2309.a: "Vive la France!"

 WORLD_REICH.2310.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Germany Refuses French Territorial Restoration"
 WORLD_REICH.2310.desc: "Tensions between the French State and Germany reached a new high, as Germany unequivocally stated that they would not be returning the former French lands to their previous owners. France has responded by condemning Germany harshly, and revealing that Germany attempted to pressure them into rejoining the Einheitspakt in exchange for their rightful lands.\n\nWhile the OFN has formally condemned the decision, Germany has moved forward in establishing a "temporary restoration government" intended to formalize the stablilization and rebuilding of the region.\n\nFew see a viable path for France to regain their territory without German cooperation, and most experts agree that this decision by Germany has all but ensured that the tensions between the two nations remain permanently high.\n"
 WORLD_REICH.2310.a: "An injustice perpetuated."

 WORLD_REICH.2311.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Burgundian Standoff"
 WORLD_REICH.2311.desc: "While the armies of Heinrich Himmler and those of the SS Legions have been crushed under the combined might of Germany, the United States, and France, the situation remains highly tense in Burgundy. While nominal control has been established over the former Ordensstaat by the armies of both sides, both German and American armies remain on high alert for any sign of aggression from the other.\n\nBoth Germany and the United States have publicly signaled rhetorical deescalation, though observers have noted that both sides remain poised and entrenched along established demarcation lines, in preparation for an escalation. German and American diplomats have been seen moving to Burgundy, and both nations are engaging each other at all diplomatic levels. While all are hoping the situation will stabilize, tensions continue to rise - and fears of a renewed war between the two superpowers with it.\n"
 WORLD_REICH.2311.a: "It's up to the diplomats now."
 
 WORLD_REICH.2312.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Germany Maintains Influence Over French Lands"
 WORLD_REICH.2312.desc: "While predicted by many experts following the conquest of Burgundy by Germany, there remained many who were shocked by the German announcement that they were in the process of establishing governments in the former French and Belgium lands - without the input of the French State.\n\nMany believe that this is due to the French State's alliance with Italy, and has caused an expected uproar among the French, who accuse Germany of not even attempting outreach. Italy, along with her allies, has also condemned the German decision, though few expect substantial actions.\n\nNow, many watch closely, and wonder if the new states will be able to sustain themselves, or if a new era of resistance will be born in the war-torn and weary nation."
 WORLD_REICH.2312.a: "The clock starts over."

 WORLD_REICH.2313.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Establishment of the French Pakt Commission"
 WORLD_REICH.2313.desc: "The world responded with a mixture of trepidation and relief when news of the collapse of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund was confirmed, with Germany mobilizing afterwards to invade the remains of Heinrich Himmler's collapsed state. With order restored, Germany has proclaimed victory over Himmler, and declared that the reign of terror perpetuated by the Reichsführer-SS has ended.\n\nWith the French State in chaos following its collapse after the failed invasion of Brittany, Germany has established the French Pakt Commission, administered by Adolf Heusinger. While the OFN and Italy have expressed concern at the development, with no legitimate French state to protest, the world can only watch - and hope that the new German administration is kinder than the last."
