    MEX_econ_project_name_1_2: "Punta Colonet Port"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_1_2: "If we wish to build up trade along the Pacific region, we will need another port to increase our inflow of goods. We will build the Puerto Punta Colonet, a port just south of Tijuana, in order to divert trade from the overly congested ports of California and Tijuana. Our hope is that this port will eventually replace Tijuana as the major port of the area, so we may make Tijuana itself more attractive for tourism—particularly from the Americans."
    MEX_econ_project_name_1_3: "Cerro Prieto Geothermal Plant"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_1_3: "This project had already begun many years ago in 1958, but work has slowed recently as our efforts have turned elsewhere. Now, it is perhaps time to rectify this oversight and refocus our efforts on building the geothermal energy plant Cerro Prieto in Mexicali. This plant will take many years to complete, but upon completion it will be the second largest of its kind in the world, and will show the world the marvel of Mexican engineering in our ability to produce such massive quantities of power."

    MEX_econ_project_name_2_1: "CDMX Metro"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_1: "Mexico City has been congested by traffic for far too long. We shall build a new subway—the Mexico City Metro—to alleviate this congestion, and provide an affordable public transportation alternative for the residents of our capital. This will help our city grow, and present the ever-modernizing image of Mexico to the world. First we must lay the groundwork, with many expansions to follow in the future."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_2: "CDMX Drainage System"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_2: "Mexico City is in desperate need of an updated drainage system. We shall build a state of the art deep drainage system which will help manage the massive needs of our ever-growing capital city. This project will have to be taken in segments, given the scale of such a massive infrastructural undertaking. This will only be the beginning of the rejuvenation of our capital city"
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_102: "Tasqueña-Tacuba Line"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_102: "The urban fabric of Mexico City remains disconnected – dysfunctional public transport and massive congestion line the city center, preventing the timely commutes from the residential lines to the business district containing many of the industry professionals that call the city home. With this line running from the metro center to the business district, the boost to the city's professional population and economy is clear."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_103: "Nonoalco Tlatelolco"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_103: "As the economy of Mexico grows ever larger, so does its urban population. Seeking higher-paying jobs and more opportunities than afforded in the countryside, hundreds of thousands flock towards the nations' capital every year. Buckling under pressure, this public housing project will relieve the growing housing problem in the wider metropolitan area."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_104: "Azteca Stadium"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_104: "As the Mexican eagle spreads her wings across the world stage, she must proportionally flex her muscle back home to support the effort in tandem. Boasting a capacity of up to 100,000, the Estadio Azteca will be the largest association football stadium on the planet upon its completion. A venue to support the masses of Mexico City, it will surely be a landmark for decades to come."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_105: "Torre Insignia"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_105: "When you can no longer build outwards, the only option is up. A much-needed component of the burgeoning Tlatelolco Complex, this broadcasting center will tower over the surrounding neighborhoods downtown, its spire rivaled only by that of the Torre Latinoamericana – it would be the second tallest building in Mexico should it be completed."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_106: "INNN"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_106: "What use are the advancements gained in the "Mexican Miracle" if her people cannot make use of them? A cutting edge medical facility representing the latest practices in neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry, this institute would allow thousands of Mexicans to receive the advanced surgeries and treatments befitting that of a new, modern Mexico, propelling our medical sector to new heights."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_201: "Paseo de la Reforma"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_201: "The famous boulevard running through western Mexico City, designed at the behest of Emperor Maximillian and renamed in honor of the pivotal set of laws passed during the second republic, is in dire need of remodeling. In the age of the automobile, such a narrow avenue must be expanded to accommodate for the influx of sightseers, commuters, and tourists hoping to see some of Mexico's most historic monuments."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_202: "Federal Highway 150D"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_202: "Federal Highway 150D is one nearing completion already, but it requires some additional construction until it can be fully finished. Stretching from Veracruz to Mexico City, it'll be one of our most vital highways connecting the country together."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_203: "Anillo Periférico"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_203: "In comparison, the Anillo Periferico Expansion is minor when faced against other developments at current. But that does not mean this project is worthless, this is important to better connect Mexico City together and improve the infrastructure of the area."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_204: "Tlalpan Causeway"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_204: "Another relatively small project on the docket, the Calzada de Tlalpan Expansion is minor in its impact on the nation as a whole. Yet, it is also necessary in order to help bolster the Infrastructure of Mexico City."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_205: "IPN Zacatenco"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_205: "The Instituto Politécnico Nacional, one of the largest public universities in the country, has just acquired over 250 hectares of land in downtown Mexico city. This potential "Zacatenco" campus –nicknamed the "Adolfo Lopez Mateos" campus– is slated to host the School of Electrical Engineering, as well as the School of Engineering and Architecture upon its completion, bolstering the tertiary education apparatus in Mexico City."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_206: "Museum of Anthropology"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_206: "Though the age of towering golden pyramids of Tenochtitlan has long passed, the Mesoamerican impact on Mexican culture can be seen to this day. With this monumental museum to be constructed in the Chapultepec park downtown, tourists and curious members of the public alike will be made more aware of their roots among mesoamerican society, along with the best our Anthropologists have to offer."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_207: "Museum of Modern Art"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_207: "As the Mexican Revolution and the PRI carry the country into the modern age in matters of the economy and state, so too must it bring our arts and culture into the 20th century. With this museum, Mexico shall bring the ever-expanding contemporary art scene into the limelight of the public."
    MEX_econ_project_name_2_208: "Chapultepec Forest"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_2_208: "Modern city design necessitates green space, for the human desire to interact with our natural words transcends living space. As one of the largest Metropolises in the Americas, Mexico City is no exception. Much needed trees, plants, park space, and waterways will be incorporated in the Chapultepec area downtown, bringing the park up to the likes of others in New York and Sao Pãolo."

   # Central North
    MEX_econ_project_name_3_101: "León Stadium"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_3_101: "The large city of León, Guanajuato, is one of the largest in Mexico currently lacking a large football stadium, a problem that many residents wish to be resolved. With a potential capacity of 30,000, this stadium would serve not only León, but much of central Mexico, with the potential for larger, televised games as well."
    MEX_econ_project_name_3_201: "Museum of Insurgency"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_3_201: "Detailing Miguel Hidalgo's struggle in the fight for Mexican Independence, this museum would allow residents of Aguascalientes to learn more about the origins of the Mexican state, as well as the role their state played in the insurgency, and would surely be home to many school trips and tourist stops in the city."

    MEX_econ_project_desc_4_101: "As the 20th century progresses onwards, the space age has gone from fantasy to reality – and though Mexico may not have rockets in orbit, it must take advantage of it no less. This satellite communications array in the small city of Tulancingo will mark one of the first investments into space telecommunication infrastructure, allowing for wireless communications for years to come."
    MEX_econ_project_name_4_102: "Coatzacaltos Bridge"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_4_102: "This partially complete, massive bridge over the Coatzacoalcos serves the rapidly expanding petrochemical industry across the river from the city sharing its name. The first in the area, upon completion it will include a massive drawbridge to facilitate shipping in the river, a long term investment that will provide a massive boost to the local economy for decades to come."
    MEX_econ_project_name_4_103: "Palace of the State of Mexico"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_4_103: "In recent years, the city of Toluca has seen rapid growth resulting from its proximity to Mexico City, and the resulting strain on the state's governing apparatus is beginning to rear ugly effects. This massive government complex in the city center will replace the existing state capitol complex in the city, and will serve as the new hub of governance in the State of Mexico."
    MEX_econ_project_name_4_104: "Cuauhtémoc Stadium"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_4_104: "It is undeniable the effect football has had on the nation, the sport grows more popular every day and with it the proposal of another stadium. In the capital of Puebla, one of the biggest stadiums in the nation is slated to be constructed with it only being overshadowed by the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. On the approval of the President, it will begin construction."

    MEX_econ_project_desc_5_1: "The Dam of Friendship, as its name suggests, is a dam built of collaboration between us and our neighbor up north. The amounts necessary in order to begin work or even complete the dam will be astonishing, and will require a full-scale coordinated effort with America to see through its completion."
    MEX_econ_project_name_5_101: "Monterrey International Airport"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_5_101: "Monterrey seems to be entering the stage of explosive growth, with this airport it will certainly cement the new era of prosperity inbound for the city. It will be one of the major airports of the nation, interconnecting not only our nation but opening up foreign flights into the city. Big things will be coming to Monterrey once this project is completed."
    MEX_econ_project_name_5_102: "Vicente Guerrero Dam"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_5_102: "In Tamaulipas, the Vicente Guerrero Dam proposal is certainly ambitious due to its size. However, besides being located close to the execution area of Agustin De Itubirde, there is nothing else remarkable about the project."
    MEX_econ_project_name_5_201: "Las Bocas Dam"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_5_201: "While the La Boca dam may be a small dam compared to other projects being considered, its role is more than just to provide power. Its other important role is to create more jobs in the surrounding area, ensuring the developing region becomes even more prosperous."

    MEX_econ_project_desc_6_201: "The recent airport crisis has shown the dire state of our aviation field, now we must seek to rectify it. With the construction of this new airport, we will not only prevent a disaster like seen before, but give us more room to breathe. More room to allow the people of Mexico to travel further beyond."
    MEX_econ_project_name_6_202: "El Granero Dam"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_6_202: "Another proposal on the docket is to construct a Medium-sized Dam in the state of Chihuahua. Aside from that, there's nothing else notable about the project."
    MEX_econ_project_name_6_203: "Plutarco Elías Calles Dam"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_6_203: "The farmers of the Yaqui River Valley in Sonora provide a vital good to Mexico's rapidly growing population in the form of wheat. To ensure production doesn't fall behind, the Plutarco Elias Calles Dam shall be built on the river, bolstering the lifeblood of farmers – the irrigation network, and providing electricity to the locals."
    MEX_econ_project_name_6_204: "Sonora Arena"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_6_204: "Though the hold association football has on Mexican sports fans remains unwavering, the government has a vested interest in supporting the nation's other athletic pastimes as well. Located in downtown Hermosillo, this proposed indoor arena boasting a unique, patterned exterior shall play host to sports such as volleyball, boxing, and lucha libre wrestling."
    MEX_econ_project_name_6_205: "Francisco Zarpa Dam"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_6_205: "Located on the Nazas River in the Durango State, the construction of the dam will allow us to control the flow of the river, assist us in preventing flooding, and provide us with various economic privileges."

    MEX_econ_project_desc_7_101: "The monumental task of bridging the socio-economic divide between the southern reaches of Mexico and her more wealthy center requires equally monumental engineering. The proposed Belisario Domínguez Dam, estimated to provide around 900 megawatts of electricity to nearby areas should it be built, requires massive construction efforts nestled in remote mountain terrain, though the rewards would be just as impactful."
    MEX_econ_project_name_7_102: "Manuel Moreno Torres Dam"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_7_102: "The march to electrify the rural south continues in Chiapas with the proposed Manuel Moreno Torres Dam. Located further upstream the Grijalva River in the mountainous interior, the over 800-foot tall embankment dam would not only grant electricity to tens of thousands nearby, but also grant Mexico the title of North America's tallest dam."
    MEX_econ_project_name_7_103: "Malpaso Dam"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_7_103: "The benefits of infrastructure sometimes spreads far beyond its original purpose, and with the Malpaso dam nearing completion deep in the beautiful rainforests along the Grijalva river, the project and surrounding infrastructure will no doubt boost the the natural tourism of the region – in addition to powering hundreds of villages and towns. All that remains is construction of the dam structure itself."
    MEX_econ_project_name_7_104: "Villahermosa Olympic Stadium"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_7_104: "The light of the Mexican Miracle reaches far and wide, beyond the cities and towns of its wealthiest provinces, but to each and every state. In the historically poorer southern state of Tabasco, Governor Madrazo has embarked on a large infrastructure campaign in Villahermosa, bringing sought-after recreation to the masses, including this Multi-Purpose Stadium that will play host to 12,000 spectators upon its completion."

    MEX_econ_project_desc_8_101: "The rugged river valleys of the Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerreros' interior are difficult enough to live in, let alone construct a desperately needed hydroelectric dam in. Using a clever design at a junction of the Balsas River, this 500 foot embankment dam is expected to reach an output of over a thousands megawatts upon its completion, additionally reducing flood risk in the region."
    MEX_econ_project_name_8_102: "Acapulco International Airport"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_8_102: "Seen as a place where Hollywood stars sunbathe and millionaires resort, Acapulco has developed a reputation as the largest resort city in Mexico. Its infrastructure, however, is barely up to the task. This airport, part of a plan to completely overhaul the city's infrastructure, will be one of the largest and most state-of-the-art in Mexico, and would play host to hundreds of thousands of tourists spending and bolstering the local economy."
    MEX_econ_project_name_8_103: "Central Market"
    MEX_econ_project_desc_8_103: "To the average tourist, the city of Acapulco is but a backdrop to the luxury resorts and hotels located along the breezy shores of the pacific. With this central market catered to foreigners, the average tourist can stop at the city center and buy merchandise and food, bringing a piece of Mexico home with them and allowing locals to make a profit off the industry too, not just the hotel owners."

    MEX_econ_project_desc_8_104: "Oil seepages have long been found amidst the salt domes of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico, but greater finds eluded geologists and oilmen alike. Recent discoveries, however, suggest that the reserves there could rival Mexico's greatest fields.\n\nThe commercial potential of the Isthmus region may have been robbed by the Panama Canal, but none save PEMEX can secure the riches that lie below its earth."

    MEX_econ_project_desc_10_1: "Cancún is the ideal location in Mexico for a tourist destination. If unconvinced by rigorous computational analysis, a brief visit to its sun, surf, and sand will assuage any doubt. Yet sadly its beaches are now too barren and isolated to realize their glorious potential. And so we must plan - leveraging every peso, dollar, yen, and lira of capital, every civic engineer's ambition and every hotelier's dream. For that is the only way we can build paradise on earth."

    MEX_econ_project_desc_10_2: "Federal Highway 307 is to run from Cancún in the Yucatán's northeast to Chetumal on our southern border. From the Caribbean coast to the wild jungles of the interior, the highway will offer an unforgettable drive to the legions of tourists soon to descend on the Peninsula.

    MEX_econ_project_desc_303: "PEMEX, our state-owned oil firm, is among Cardenas's most valuable legacies for our nation. But we cannot rest on his laurels, PEMEX must be expanded.

    MEX_econ_project_desc_306: "Mexico's forests have sustained nearby peasantry for generations, providing game and charcoal. Yet, with well-directed investments, those forests can do far more. By improving rural infrastructure, trucks can take wood to our ever-hungry sawmills and furniture manufacturers. Improved planning and more vigorous enforcement of environmental regulations will also ensure that our forests remain a joy and source of prosperity for generations to come."

  MEX_mega_planbaja.1.desc: "Enrique stepped back into the streets of Ensenada, greeted only by a forlorn horn a block over. The echo in his mind was louder, stating again and again that final phrase from the law office, "... but we have a certain reputation, Señor Ruiz. One your past organizing could harm." He had heard that phrase, from different mouths and with different words, since he had graduated. Heard it in his own voice as he lay down to sleep.\n\nEnrique kept putting one foot in front of the other. A gaggle of drunken American tourists stood laughing below a bar sign in English. Younger than him, with dollars in their pockets, beer on their breath, and not a care in their head. They ignored the suited Mexican brushing past.\n\nReturned braceros with callused hands and worn bodies. Aged fishermen, tattered clothes streaked with grime. Polished black shoes racing down cracked pavement.\n\nThey, and Enrique, came to a halt in front of a familiar bus stop. No PAN organizer had taken his former post there. Just tired faces, dispatched from Ensenada to ride over pot-holed roads, to take orders from a gringo half their age, to return home covered in machine grease and sweat.\n\nTo have no future."

He was currently on a direct flight from Mexicali back to the Federal District. Carefully placed in the empty seat next to his was a briefcase that contained the fruits of weeks of nightmarish bureaucratic labor. It had been torturous work arranging an economic development strategy for Baja California and Baja California Sur. Every person the PRI bureaucrat spoke to agreed that the region had tremendous potential, but excruciatingly, every person had their own vision of how that potential was going to be fulfilled: The big cities scraped to be the center point; Baja California Sur is fighting for its fair share despite its insignificant population; American, Japanese, and Mexican industrialists jockeying for the best contracts; norteños wanting all the federal money but none of the strings.\n\nThe debates and politicking might have been bearable if all the involved parties could fit into one room. However, the Undersecretary had spent the last couple of weeks on a journey to the westernmost extremes of Mexico. He traveled on terrible roads to tiny towns and small farms, meeting the people who would be most impacted by his policy decisions. It was a grueling journey, but miraculously, he had done it. He had crafted a perfectly acceptable plan that everybody could sign, filled with manageable compromises and minimal loopholes. This was the defining moment of his career, a testament to the PRI's commitment to carrying forward the legacy of the Revolution for Baja and all of Mexico.\n\n"Care for a drink, Sir?" An Air Stewardess interrupted his idle musing.\n\n"Don't mind if I do." The harried man replied, plucking a glass of cheap sparkling wine from the woman's outstretched hands.

It had been torturous work arranging an economic development strategy for Baja California and Baja California Sur. Every person the PRI bureaucrat spoke to agreed that the region had tremendous potential, but excruciatingly, every person had their own vision of how that potential was going to be fulfilled: The big cities scraped to be the center point; Baja California Sur fought for a piece despite its insignificance; Foreign and domestic industrialists jockeying for the best contracts; norteños wanting all the federal money but none of the responsibility.\n\nThe debates and politicking had been unbearable. The Undersecretary had been shuffled from conference room to meeting room as he was berated by interest groups, businessmen, and petty politicians. Every interest group had to be bought off individually with massive promises and pages of text. Their demands weighed on the plan and on his wrist. The resulting briefcase and document, if one could call it anything beyond a ream of waste, containing the so-called 'plan' was so heavy that he sprained his wrist.\n\n"Care for a drink, Sir?" An Air Stewardess smiled through the dark atmosphere.\n\n"No, I really mustn't," the harried man replied, waving away the woman. He sighed and glanced at the stuffed briefcase.

An exponentially-expanding payroll. Contracts for subcontractors, contracts for steamrollers. Requests for concrete mixers, warehouse space, rail cars on the ever-lengthening trains racing into Mexicali. Bids for the immense roadwork about to begin under the Baja Plan.\n\nA cup of coffee was set down firmly beside his typewriter. Enrique's tired eyes turned from the blurring page in front of him to Señor Iglesias, head of the company. Beneath Iglesias' graying mustache was a small smile. "Most everyone has gone home.

Perhaps soon you'll rival my haul."\n\nEnrique's muscles were straining but he managed to give a quick glance and grin to his boss before returning his attention to the line. Iglesias lowered his own pole and watched Enrique's bobber spin and weave. It was perhaps a minute before Iglesias spoke again, "But you're to be congratulated on many things recently; I hear Cecilia is expecting. And I daresay that the Transpeninsular Highway contract you secured is one of the finest moments in company history." He breathed in, letting the sea air fill his lungs. "Connecting Los Cabos to the world is no small feat."\n\nEnrique had now pulled the tuna to the water alongside the boat, where it thrashed relentlessly. Iglesias repeated, "No small feat. We'll be putting the final touches on the Baja Plan, son. A photo opportunity like none other, and a chance to cement ourselves as the premier construction firm in Baja before every governor, mayor, legislator and bureaucrat they fly in from Mexico City. There's just one problem."\n\nEnrique's tuna was suspended in air now, gasping. Its black eye reflected Iglesias' stern gaze. "I'll be retiring shortly after the ceremony. My successor would have to carry on the legacy we built." The fish now straddled the side of the boat, as a blanched Enrique turned to face the CEO. "The candidate I had in mind has the brains and moxy. But he still needs to learn how things get done in Baja." Iglesias opened a withered fist to reveal a small campaign button with green, white, and red stripes. And the letters P. R. I.\n\nWith one swift, final pull, Enrique had the tuna in place.

  # Punta Colonet
  MEX_mega_puntacolonet.1.t: "Pictures Speak Louder"
  MEX_mega_puntacolonet.1.desc: ""And these are a few pictures of the site in Tijuana-" Secretary Flores presented the photograph of a grand airport, which, while probably not as big as more major destinations in the country, still hosted the ability to accommodate a large influx of passengers. It was well maintained, shiny, modern. It had to be, the scars of the airport crisis still bearing on Ordaz's mind as he peered toward the next in the lineup.\n\nAs one would drive from the airport into the city, the stillness and clinical nature of the facility they left behind would blow away as the life of the city made its grand debut. In particular, the photographs placed an emphasis on the cinemas, and the next topic of the images were in the background; the beaches. Sand so white it popped out to Ordaz, it was like microscopic pearls stretching for kilometers. In the background, he could barely make out the sign saying the distance to San Diego.\n\n"Of course-" Secretary Campos Salas interrupted his hyperfixation on the picture, "-perfection does not exist in this world, unfortunately." The next ones afterwards were much less appetizing, rusty ships, with one just shipwrecked, sideways, on the beach. Old cranes, some barely able to support their own weight that he could tell through the photos, the warehousing for the port nearby becoming derelict and decayed.\n\n"Secretary Salas, Secretary Flores, I authorize the construction of a new port, at the nearby city of Punta Colonet. The opportunity Tijuana presents, not only in tourism but commercially as well, will be a massive boon for Mexico.-"

In specifics, the Punta Colonet plan was leaked, spurring a rapid frenzy of investment to try to buy their way into an opportunitythat will pay off massively.\n\nFormer President Alemán is at the forefront of a consortium for the construction of hotels and other entertainment venues in the downtown area of the city. Shifting the focus just a bit farther to the west, industrialists were snapping up land near the shiny new port faster than screaming '¡Lotería!' once they got their final card needed.\n\nNaturally, those who were slower have been clamoring to get their chance in the project, these being the Californian and Japanese businesspeople, and have been relentless in their persistence. The money they offer, though, is always a great incentive."

One of the officers went to inspect a crate, only to fail at reading the caution warning; Japanese.\n\nAs time went on, and a translator was brought on site, the scene became apparent; products from all over the Sphere were present in this facility. More than likely, they were to be smuggled into the land up north, and that brought joy to the agent. The Yanquis, and through them his bosses, would be happy at the discovery made today.\n\nHowever, it brought the notion that more warehouses around Punta Colonet were sprouting up, just like these, to the forefront of his mind."

Of course, none of them were able to compete with the best of the best; the very hotel he was staying in.\n\nThe tourists speak for themselves, the hotel pack-full, the bustle of families having their get-away, those who came by themselves to relax, or the few who came with scandalous intentions. Butchered Spanish uttered from the mouths of the northerners as they repaid their transgressions with cold hard cash. English held the most sway among the visitors, but there were some distinct Japanese being spoken in the hallways as well, though not nearly as much as the former.\n\nThe Californian wine glimmered into the sunlight, sloshing up, down, around the glass as it responded to the twirls of his own doing. With all of this said, it did get Alemán thinking of the man who made it possible, Ordaz. He would dare to venture that Ordaz might have been the President that Mexico truly needed..."

The honks of cargo ships and trucks reached a higher level of noise and appreciation compared to the jubilations and cheers from the gathered audience.\n\nBoth the US and Japanese diplomats who gathered for the opening smiled for the possibilities the port could bring. Though their smiles were on different sides of the crowd, having been separated for the sake of not wanting to start an international incident in this glorious ceremony. The cameras blinded Ordaz as he forced himself to not blink at each time a flash engulfed his eyes.\n\nIt was not only Ordaz the cameras captured, but also the state's governor, Raúl, his broad grin flanked by Flores and Campos Salas's own grins.

The Cocopah aunt rocked in her chair, looking through the window and at the storied valley, twisting from one direction to another, but always providing a clear view in the middle. She remembers waiting for that part of the year when the sun fell right in the middle and- ah. She glanced back to her nephew waiting for her to begin, his small puppy on the floor a few feet away from him.\n\n"Long ago, in an age long past our own, a boy- who was very naughty, and was with his loyal dog, prodded, and wounded a monster. The monster gave chase throughout the valley- Come here." She gestured for the nephew to stand up, and with the same hand pointed towards the landscape. "The whole valley. Nearly catching and eating the boy and his dog. At last, once the boy was out of breath, he finally arrived at the house of his aunt. She handed him her earring; which turned into a stone, and he-" The aunt cocked back her hand, before releasing the energy and swinging her arm forward. "-threw the rock with all his strength at the beast!"\n\n"And then?" Her nephew piped up, the night sky seemed to shine through his eyes and hit back at her with his grin.\n\n"Then.. once it hit the monster, it thrashed around in agony! It fell, and created, the hole in the Volcano, over there-" The storyteller pointed towards Cerro Prieto, inactive though it was, still standing. "-and in doing so, boiled itself in the lava that spewed out." Her nephew continued to gaze out at the window, his eyes darting to find remnants of the clash.\n\nThere weren't any claw marks or anything else that could be from the monster. All he spotted were trucks making their way towards the volcano, like they were chasing the beast long gone."

  MEX_mega_cerroprieto.2.desc: "Conclusions:\n\nSurveying the surroundings of the Cerro Prieto volcano in Baja California as part of the Cerro Prieto Geothermal Project presented a number of challenges for our team. The unique geology of the area presented a challenge for our efforts to conduct lithology studies by drilling holes. Our equipment was insufficient to carry out the survey work meant for us to undertake due to the granite and hard shale in the ground.\n\nDrilling into volcanic rocks is a difficult undertaking. Our drill bits were not sufficient to bore through the dacitic rock that surrounds the base of the mountain. The bits would oftentimes wear out before making significant progress. It was apparent to us we would need a new drill bit type to continue our surveying work. Despite researching options, no drill bit available in the area fit our needs.\n\nReaching out to the University of Sonora, our group from the Autonomous University of Baja California collaborated on designing a drill bit for surveying in hard formations. The drill bit we developed is designed to start the well in hard formations where bedrock is higher than the distance that is necessary to begin a well to SGM standards. It is equipped with industrial diamonds to bore through hard rock when the initial silt is drilled through. Once the initial hole is bored, further excavation can be undertaken safely with traditional hard formation drills.\n\nThis drill bit has substantially made our surveying work easier and has allowed us to drill into the hard shale layers near Cerro Prieto and the fault line. On top of proven practical use, it has also been determined to be a patentable design and our group has sought one to protect our intellectual property."

  MEX_mega_cerroprieto.3.desc: "For Eduardo Gutiérrez his company had found the bottom of the barrel in terms of accommodation in Mexicali. The two star hotel lacked air conditioning, which made tonight especially insufferable, standing in the lobby with two heavy bags he hauled from the taxi. The receptionist, a hairy, sweaty man in a Salton Sea tourist T-shirt returned with the room; one bed, one bath, two month stay, top floor. It was a good thing he made a reservation early, mentioned the receptionist who took the payment and lazily walked back to his cigar and magazine of a scantily clad woman being rescued from Japanese paratroopers.\n\nAs Eduardo tried to lift his bags up the stairs in the sweltering heat, he wondered how full this place could possibly be. Obviously his company skimped out and found the cheapest possible place to bunk their engineers while they made millions off this contract. But when he finally got to his floor, he found his boss in the hallway, staying two rooms down. He couldn't believe how lucky Eduardo was; he thought the hotel had been all but bought out by the scientists from the consulting firms.\n\nIndeed, Mexicali was completely full. Hotels and hostels were crammed with white and blue collar workers from all over Mexico, somehow displacing the tourists from California. Housing had been bought out by companies who needed places for their workers to stay in the city. Rental units were completely full of people on short term leases. Lots were full of trailers for those who didn't want to wait in the massive line.\n\nThis wouldn't last forever. Already more land was being cleared as cheap bunkhouses popped up on the outskirts of the city. Once the brick walls and metal roofs went up, the iron frame bunks were moved in. When the walls of the living area were covered with beds, in came the electrical appliances for the kitchen. The communal stove, sink, coffee pot, and refrigerators. Another company- owned home for the working class successfully furnished.\n\nBut this wasn't only for the construction workers, who were expected to leave when the project was finished. This was for who would come after them. Now full of power from the same force that built the mountains around it, Mexicali would no longer be a farming town on the border of the United States. Factories would spring up here like they did in Tijuana, Juárez, and Matamoros. In its own way, this expansion was Mexicali being molded by the fires of the earth into a new maquiladora city."

Next, the Confederation of Mexican Workers... The Autonomous University of Baja California..."\n\nWhen reality set in for what the audience attended, a ceremony with no doubt a long speech, it became harder and harder to listen to the same voice. Droopier, the eyes slowly came closer to- "The power of the Revolution is what truly drove this project!" Another explosion of noise came from the stage, shaking the audience awake.

He turned away from the valley and towards where the Volcano lay after however many years it was since the monster shaped it.\n\nThe power plant complex that laid next to Cerro Prieto shining like the brilliant stars up above, but a specific shine. The best he could describe it was the star that arced across the sky, the one he had only seen once, and the one that his aunt said he probably made up. That rarity made it feel like it was one in a million, like the volcano, which seemed to have basically come alive again.\n\nHe stared up into the night, into the faint band of stars and fell silent, closing his eyes in thanks to the boy long ago who slew the monster. He opened them back up, and there stood his dog, moving towards him, coming to curl in his lap."

The grand opening of the Melchor Ocampo port in Michoacán was fast approaching. Diplomats had decided that Mateos, because of his vital role in organizing the port's creation, should host a pre-opening celebration for the business representatives that would flood the port with more than seawater. Japanese zaibatsus, American CEOs, and Mexican industrialists gathered in loose groups in the new warehouse. Mateos looked over at the crowd. The local team had done an excellent job with the decorations and refreshments, but if the men in their fancy suits agreed with him, they didn't show it. Even his joke only produced a small number of smiles.\n\n"I, of course, jest." Mateos continued, "I assure you that this port will be self-evident in its worth. The profits you and Mexico will see will be great." It was only then that Mateos saw smiles twist onto the concrete faces of his audience. "I must thank you all. First, to my Japanese and American friends. Foreign investment is a vital part of Mexican national development." Mateos received a series of nearly identical smug nods. "Gentlemen." Mateos gestured out to open warehouse doors and onto the port beyond. "This port and city may be beautiful pieces of engineering, but it is only the beginning. Importing the latest industrial tools and machinery will expand Mexico's manufacturing sector. We shall give as much as we receive with this great portal." Mateos couldn't help but bring a grandeur to his speech that went wholly unappreciated by the hard men around him. "Mexico's natural bounty will foster much growth for our partners abroad. Thus, the cycle will continue growing each step, and it all began here."\n\nMateos stepped down from his stage and entered the crowd. He would shake hands and schmooze the foreigners and countrymen, never favoring one group over another.

How could you feed a machine with punchcards and come up with the recipe to the soda everyone on earth would love? Could a computer come back with an agreed upon list of the best songs of all time? Would it be possible to run a complex equation and get back the toothpaste 10/10 dentists could agree on?\n\nThoughts like these were doubtlessly in the minds of those who watched the white collar workers of the Alameda Square headquarters of the Bank of Mexico insert dozens of punch cards for a computer to digest. Their attempted task would be to decide on something no less insane on the surface - to decide upon the perfect location for a tourist city that would be constructed.\n\nIn truth, there could be no perfect city for tourists to enjoy. Research into the preferences and habits of the Japanese and American tourists had a wide variation in terms of cost and desires to make an entirely pleasing experience impossible. But it certainly was not going to be the overcrowded traditional favorite of Acapulco. And this city would be as good as it could get. Hotel occupancy data collected from around the globe, weather and climate patterns, personal flights over possible locations, the bankers had been diligent in their research and criteria.\n\nWith hundreds of millions on the line, the computer started whittling down the cities. All twenty-five options were considered and ranked. Automatically a top site was rejected - the shark attack rate had sunk it. And another was eliminated. This continued until five sites in semi-virgin land were left. But there was no contest for the one that was the ultimate favorite. An unpopulated tongue of white sand in Quintana Roo. Warm water and clear year round weather. And lagoons that kept the beasts of the jungle at bay.\n\nThe young accountant Emmanuel Alonso read the results, and applause filled the room.

A small dirt road had been erected, connecting the temporary airstrip with Puerto Juárez, a nearby fishing village and its military installation.\n\nDespite the rate at which construction has commenced, it was hard for Gaspar to imagine that this island - now a mass of mangrove trees, deep marshes and jungle could ever possibly become the tropical paradise as outlined in the Master Development Plan. The incredibly audacious plan entailed grand hotels, shopping centers, a massive golf course, a residential district for the workers, and even an international airport. To Gaspar, this seemed an impossible task.\n\nTucking the copy of the plan into his briefcase, Gaspar noticed his charter plane finally arriving.

His bulldozer toppled over another mangrove, its snake-like tendrils for roots shot up into the air as the tree collapsed. The sight made Julián jump for a moment before regaining his composure. Working the stick-shift, Julián reversed the machine back. At first, his reversal was successful, until the marsh glued itself to the treads, causing the engine to stall.\n\n"God damn it." He muttered to himself in annoyance. He hated working in this marsh almost as much as he hated snakes. "I'm sure the jungle team is taking it easy. All they have to do is line up electrical poles in predetermined spots." Julián grunted, rubbing the back of his neck. "Maybe I'll put in a transfer request."\n\nHe paused for a moment, realizing that a transfer request could potentially land him on the sewer team, laying pipe down in the swamp for one hundred kilometers. Julián exhaled harshly, before returning to reality and examining the trapped bulldozer.\n\nAfter confirming that none of the mangrove roots were snakes, he hopped from his seat, and called out to two of his colleagues idling nearby. They quickly rushed to Julián's aid, and began pushing the bulldozer slowly out of the marsh. The task is quite difficult, the men straining their muscles as far as they could to move the metal beast, but eventually the machine is freed from its mucky confines. Picking himself back up, Julián hopped into the cab, and began working again, wondering how they could ever dig this channel from the Nichupté Lagoon all the way to the sea."

Swerving down the road, Julián makes it to his destination, prepared to begin his day.\n\nDue to the fact that Cancún is an unknown area in terms of investment, hoteliers are naturally more risk-averse to trusting their money into such new territory. To promote investment, the government has introduced low-interest financing in the area, something the fresh-faced accountant Emmanuel Alonso must negotiate. Looking through his papers, detailed reports, and note-cards, Emmanuel takes a deep breath, in preparation to face off with a room full of stuffy business moguls.\n\nWith the mangrove trees and muck removed, Cancún's beaches are left a pristine white. Despite his earlier doubts, Gaspar Muñoz has remained on the project, and the results speak for themselves.

Soft guitar music wafted from a patio.\n\nAn American, a young blonde woman in a white bikini, watched as her friends waded into the darkening waters of the Caribbean Sea. When she was satisfied that they had forgotten about her, she turned her attention to a group of Japanese tourists.\n\nIn the center, sprawled on a blanket, was a tanned young man with thin lips and a long nose. His short black hair was artfully quaffed to one side, and an unbuttoned terrycloth shirt hung over his muscular chest. She had seen him the night before. He danced the bolero gracefully, and never stumbled. He had many partners, but took none with him at the end of the night.\n\nThe American woman took a breath, and marched over the hot sand in his direction. Standing before the group, she offered her hand and asked him to dance. The other tourists murmured, and stifled giggles. They couldn't hide their shock when he stood and took her hand in his. His other hand, broad and veiny, rested on the soft skin of her waist. She looked into his eyes, deep pools of glowing amber in the evening sun.\n\n"Mariela?" The waitress tore her eyes from the young tourists. "Those Canadians are still waiting on their drinks." Her boss flashed her an exhausted smile."

  MEX_mega_metro.1.t: "The Road to Chapultepec"
  MEX_mega_metro.1.desc: "Afternoon smog lay, thick as a blanket, over Mexico City, but María Álvarez could see this morning well enough. She could see Crispín, leaving the movie theater, Irela under his arm. She could see herself drop the basket of groceries, stride up to the traitors. She could see Crispín's face turn red, Irela avert her eyes. As she shouted, she could see his hand become a fist and then punch her. Right on the street.\n\nEven through the grime of the bus window María could see. Now all she wanted was for Crispín to go away. For Camila and her father, waiting at home to make such a scene, to go away.\n\nThere was only one place she wanted to be, to see. Chapultepec Park. An island of green in a city of gray. A place where she and Rodrigo had run wild, stealing from the tourists to buy sweets and whatever suited them. Back in better days.\n\nBut those days had been before Crispín, before Rodrigo left to join the dumb army, before there were so many people in the city and so many cars on the roads that the buses just sat. They didn't drive her to Chapultepec. They didn't drive her anywhere."
  MEX_mega_metro.1.a: "They didn't let her escape."

A system for the Federal District.\n\nAcross the Pacific, Alfonso Corona del Rosal stood underneath a canopy, feeling every rattle of the construction equipment clearing the path for the Montreal Metro. The pit stretching before him was a far cry from the architectural marvels the city's mayor, Jean Drapeau, had been showing him in the plans.

Not far at all.\n\nAn understated cacophony reigned three weeks later, as whispers, coughs and the shuffling of papers pervaded a Mexico City conference room following a speech by del Rosal. Federal District employees hastily skimmed their notes, looking to reinforce their general after his compact recommendation to use Montreal's Metro as a model for Mexico City's. The ICA engineers scrambled to build upon Quintana's points in Tokyo's favor, with a young man winning a nod after he stressed earthquake resiliency. Then a slender veteran, seated toward the back, suggested Buenos Aires as an alternative.

An opportunity for Latin American solidarity, he called it.\n\nWith that, the floodgates opened.

  MEX_mega_metro.30.t: "Forced March"
  MEX_mega_metro.30.desc: "The thought of closing Chapultepec Avenue for a publicity stunt would cause any Regent to break down in sweat. They would hear the horns of furious commuters blare across Colonia Juárez, the foreign jabber of American and Japanese tourists denied their trip to the Zona Rosa or Chapultepec Park, the ring of cash registers falling silent....\n\nAll General Alfonso Corona del Rosal heard was the click of a stopwatch. The bead of sweat wending its way down his bald forehead could credit the blazing sun for its existence, not fear. The grinning head of the Federal District grabbed hold of the microphone, voice blaring out over the cheering crowd.\n\n"Capitalinos! I will keep my remarks brief. You are not here to suffer in the heat, but to celebrate yet another monumental victory for the Revolution. Many here saw the Revolution fought with bullets, as I did. But today, its chief weapon is this."\n\nDel Rosal held up his shovel, then planted it firmly on the ground to his left. He silenced the ensuing applause with a curt cough into the microphone, "The Metro will be built by many Mexicans, and will serve many Mexicans more. Behind them all is the unwavering determination of our party to offer them, to offer you, a better way of life. With this first shovel of earth, I declare to you that not a moment will be wasted in bringing you this Metro. We will not rest until the last shovel takes its place."\n\nDel Rosal flung a hearty scoop over his shoulder. At the signal, the chorus of jackhammers began, overwhelming even the cheers and drums of the CNOP and CTM."

  MEX_mega_metro.31.desc: "Ernesto P. Uruchurtu held, between meaty fingers, a testament to his ambition in eggshell white cardstock and flowing script. A low growl rose in his throat as the Sonoran forced his eyes to review it once again.\n\n"For his tireless efforts in securing the timely funding and planning of the Mexico City Metro, Secretary of Communications and Transportation Ernesto P. Uruchurtu is cordially invited to a ceremony celebrating the initiation of construction. His -"\n\nFist crushed the card. Oh yes, Uruchurtu's work had made the Metro possible. If it hadn't been for the hours he'd poured in at this desk, reviewing, cajoling, berating, the infrastructure project would have been the over-time, over-budget menace to the Federal District that he had long assured the public it would be.\n\nAnd now faux-Regent Ordaz was laying a trap for him, rubbing Uruchurtu's face in the success of the project that he had long opposed. Looking to humiliate him before the capitalinos and above all to break the bonds the Iron Regent had forged with the Federal District's transportation unions. But to not appear would be to plaster Ordaz's hideous face in the history books as the transformer of the District, the Moses that parted the sea of gridlocked cars.\n\nUruchurtu unfurled the card, just to see the hell his presidential ambitions would summon him to. "-presence is requested at the intersection of Chapultepec Avenue and Bucareli Street next Thursday at 4:00 P.M." The norteño lay the card down on his desk, smoothed back his hair, and decided:"

  MEX_mega_metro.32.desc: "The last television camera had departed from the intersection of Chapultepec Avenue and Bucareli Street; the last reporter remained only out of a desire to avoid his mother-in-law for another hour. Where hundreds of CNOP and CTM members had cheered and thundered, only detritus remained.\n\nAlfonso Corona del Rosal's boot crunched a placard underfoot. It had been a decent piece of work, the word 'METRO' emblazoned in green, white and red. But the sign held del Rosal's eyes only for a moment before they lifted to the gaggle of legislators, businessmen, and other notables waiting for him, four limousines parked by their side.\n\n"Quite the speeches, General. You and Secretary Sierra had the crowd ecstatic for the Metro's imminent construction, and I'm certain that citizens across the country are now experiencing that same energy," half-shouted television executive Azcárraga Vidaurreta over the peal of jackhammers.\n\nDel Rosal paused for a moment, then boomed, "It wouldn't have been possible without your support, caballeros. The ceremony, or the Metro." Frankly, he thought, it would have been easier. Not having to satisfy the swarm of plump leeches that came to guzzle at Line 1. The one man he couldn't have done this without, del Rosal gave a quick glance backward, was jabbering with ICA engineers next to a half empty stage. Probably another spiel about retaining walls and the underground lake.\n\nHe gestured toward the limos, "Let's get moving to Delmonico's. We have reservations, a great deal to celebrate,"
  MEX_mega_metro.32.a: ""and Licenciado Sierra has other business to attend to.""
  MEX_mega_metro.4.t: "The Skirt of Snakes"
  MEX_mega_metro.4.desc: "Benito Leoz wrangled the head of his spade, letting it sink deep in the mushy earth to then resurface with a big scoop of dirt, quickly flung over his shoulder. The track that would one day make up the length and breadth of Line 1 had slowly begun to take form over the past few weeks of relentless digging, morning to night. Benito felt a rumble in his stomach and remembered that the team was due to break for lunch in about ten minutes. He was famished, but nothing beans and a nice cold sip of water couldn't fix.\n\nHe felt something tingle his arm. A finger? Draught of wind—no, surely not underground— naturally he turned— the head of a snake. Its two beady eyes. Was that a hiss he heard? He was going to die. He was going to die. Benito's knees trembled and gave in, making him fall backwards with a terrible, guttural cry.\n\nIt was only when doubled over the dirt on his back that Benito—as the moment of death passed—realised that the snake's head was not made of real, organic scales, but in fact of ornately carved stone, one limb of a much larger piece that was semi-obscured by it being half sunk in the dirt. Coatlicue, he realised. Mother of the Deities. His co-workers had run over as soon as they heard the commotion, mixtures of what-the-hells and are-you-alrights for Benito that quickly grew silent once they too realised the presence of the ancient artefact. "I think it's an Aztec piece," Benito murmured, eyes transfixed.\n\n"Well, dig it out, Beni!" someone said, to which he shook his head, not averting his gaze.\n\n"No, no, we need to wait... An archaeologist, something..." Live or not, Benito did not want to be the one to upset Coatlicue in rest. Not because he was no professional—it was just some stupid statue, surely— but because snakes were horrid creatures, and he had almost pissed himself in fear once already. His workmates needn't know that."

  MEX_mega_metro.5.desc: "María Álvarez did not consider herself pretty. Short and chubby, she refused on principle to follow her sister Camila's lewd ways and doll herself up with make-up. But María Álvarez did consider herself lucky. Ruperto, one of Crispín's old friends, had offered to meet her at Chapultepec Park after work. He must have made good money in construction because he had bought her a ticket there on the new Metro.\n\nSo María found herself on the hurtling steel tube that only a day before the President and Regent had rode, dreaming about never seeing Crispín again. Her plain cotton dress, the nicest of the three she owned, paled next to the fine materials surrounding her. But no grinning middle-class housewife out for a ride on the city's new toy could outshine María and her smile. As station after station went by, María could feel herself getting farther from the arguments, the insults, the beatings that Crispín gave her, the shame on Papá's face, the snarl on Camila's lips. A life with spending money in her pocket for clothes or to ride this train when she wished. Ha, perhaps she'd return on occasion, just to parade in front of Crispín arm-in-arm with Ruperto.\n\nMaría practically bounded up the Metro stairs, emerging into the sunlight of a new world. But it was Crispín waiting in the station's entrance, not Ruperto. Crispín with her favorite box of sweets and flowers. Crispín with a soft hand that took hers, leading her to the privacy of a tree's shade. Crispín with a sad smile and lips that mouthed, "Don't worry about Ruperto, he was only helping out. Come back to me, María. This time will be different."\n\nLips that would kiss her until her ears went red and she pulled him with her, deeper into Chapultepec Park."

MEX_debt_crisis.1.desc: "Your Excellency,\n\nAs a recently-formed state and a territory, Baja California and Baja California Sur lack the institutional history that supports access to domestic and international finance. Accordingly, our two recent bond offerings have seen minimal uptake, and we will be unable to roll over our current infrastructure debt using existing resources. We humbly request federal assistance to bridge the gap.\n\nWe wish to assure you that such debts were incurred only through necessity. The lands we govern are sparsely populated and mountainous, greatly increasing the cost of providing the public services that are owed to every Mexican citizen.\n\nDespite these challenges, our long-term prospects remain bright. Baja California and Baja California Sur have unparalleled access to both Japanese and American markets, and have substantial mineral reserves suitable for export. We have seen remarkable commercial and population growth in recent years, and, with Your Excellency's support in this critical time, anticipate ongoing expansion over the coming decade."
MEX_debt_crisis.2.desc: "Your Excellency,\n\nI am writing to you today to remind you of your obligations to Mexico. Our great nation is not a series of lines on a map but a society of people. Our role as leaders is to support the people, not the lines. It would be best if you opened up new streams of monetary support. I am disheartened to state it in such direct words, but your irresponsibility has forced my hand. Mexico City, the heart of our nation, not only serves as our capital but also boasts the largest population and economy. Despite this, your recent policies and budgets have failed to prioritize its people, thereby jeopardizing our nation's economic stability.\n\nWe may be one district, but we are Mexico's crown jewel. Your efforts to expand infrastructure nationwide have done nothing but impoverish the people and enrich the ground. Our meager budget is insufficient to fund the necessary projects befitting a great city or maintaining public services. As rural residents from other states flood into our district, they strain our resources without contributing economically due to their poor education. If the upcoming Olympics will be anything other than disastrous, the District needs support now.\n\nI know my role. Do you know yours?"
MEX_debt_crisis.3.desc: "Your Excellency,\n\nI must stress the urgency of the financial situation in the State of Guanajuato. Our state is grappling with unprecedented challenges that demand immediate federal funding. Over the past few years, we have been implementing an innovative economic program, Plan Guanajuato, aimed at catapulting our economy into the future. However, we are currently facing significant financial constraints, with our yearly expenditure consistently exceeding the allocated budget by a staggering 400%.\n\nOnce complete, our success can be copied by many other states. However, due to our cutting-edge policies, we require support from outside our standard revenue streams if the nation wishes to share in our innovations. Additionally, I am happy to announce that our most recent projections show that Celaya is experiencing marked growth. I recently spoke to one Alejandro from that city. A former agricultural laborer who was nearly forced into homelessness before he found rewarding work in one of our new factories. He told me he dreams of working hard so his whole family can work in the city.\n\nYour Excellency, you wouldn't let Alejandro's dream die, would you? "
MEX_debt_crisis.4.desc: "Your Excellency,\n\nWe hope that you read our words with patience and wisdom. As the governors of the great states of Veracruz, Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Hidalgo, we face many different challenges and have different strengths. Yet we jointly are asking you for additional funding. We alone cannot stand against these new challenges. In Veracruz, the ports have suffered from the closing of European markets under a cloak of tyranny, and the people have been hurt because of it. In Puebla, social instability has hurt business leaders' confidence and increased the burden of security further on the state. These problems may seem like distant drops, but from up high, they combine to create an incoming storm.\n\nWhile Tlaxcala and Hidalgo may seem distant from the storm, we know from our collective years of political experience that such economic shocks always spread to their neighbors, and when they spread to us, they will then spread to the whole country. Your Excellency, we know that you are bold enough as the protector of Mexico to construct a stalwart wall of support so that this economic wave may crash and settle. We believe that you are intelligent enough to know that only a combination of domestic stimulus and further regional interconnection will allow the gulf to get back on its feet.\n\nWith utmost humility, we, the Governors, await your decision, fully aware of the weight of responsibility that rests upon your shoulders."
MEX_debt_crisis.5.desc: "Your Excellency,\n\nWe write to you not only as the governors of Nuevo León and Coahuila but as friends and allies. It is with trust in your administration and recognition of our faults that we ask you for further federal funding. We acknowledge that we have been under no insubstantial budgetary strain recently, but the additional investment will be worth it. For these United Mexican States, there is beauty and growth in every corner that can often go unseen from the heights of the capital. We invite you, Your Excellency, to visit our states and see for yourself the tremendous progress that we have made. Despite capital shortcomings, our work is truly grand, and not a single peso has been wasted.\n\nIn Coahuila, we have united in our push to improve our society's foundations. Across the state, new infrastructure crosses all walks of life, improving the lives and economies of our citizens. Additionally, education investment will raise our society's mental foundations, guaranteeing a more fantastic future. Even our farmers benefit from these projects. Our fields grow so beautifully that I may even take up the task when my job is done.\n\nIn Nuevo León, we have witnessed unprecedented industrial growth in Monterrey and along the Texan border. We are eager to continue this expansion with an influx of support during this critical growth period. However, all these triumphs could be at risk without the crucial federal backing we are seeking."
MEX_debt_crisis.6.desc: "Your Excellency,\n\nChihuahua stands at a crossroads. We have pursued Plan Chihuahua, an ambitious economic development strategy supported by our nation's leading experts, with every resource available. The Plan's goal of an industrialized, modern Chihuahua able to provide for its citizens lies within view, but just out of reach. Our debt burden, strained by heavy up-front costs, has not yet been relieved by our accelerated growth.\n\nWhile my administration is collaborating closely with local banking leaders, such as the Ibarra family, I have determined that federal support will be necessary if we are to proceed.\n\nIn the spirit of foresight and fair treatment, I request that this support be dispatched in the form of grants to all northwestern states, not solely Chihuahua. Our neighbors and partners are similarly reporting ever-higher fiscal burdens, and an inability to support their economic development and public welfare commitments.\n\nYour Excellency, the future of our region rests in your hands."
MEX_debt_crisis.7.desc: "Chiapas has always been a firmly agricultural state and, as such, has always been one that critically depended on harvests to provide for the people. We are afraid to say that this year's harvests have been poor and have placed our state budget and, thus, our citizens in jeopardy.\n\nOur administration has prided itself on the cautious and careful use of funds. Still, our region's dependency on our crops has left us with no other choice. Without your direct intervention, we cannot guarantee that the state will not continue to slide into ill fortune or destitution. I urge you to consider our people's future."
MEX_debt_crisis.8.desc: "We are writing to you urgently for the sake of the Revolution and the Party itself. Our regions in the Southwest, Michoacán and Guerrero, have been under great strain since counter-revolutionaries levied recent (and unfounded) corruption allegations against the local PRI elements, resulting in numerous withdrawals from investors.\n\nOur states are in dire need of wealth, and without your financial aid, we cannot continue any major projects in the region. Without these efforts, from road construction to tourism attraction, the states will remain isolated from the rest of Mexico and the world.\n\nWith your permission, we pledge to uphold the highest standards of transparency and accountability in the use of these funds. We will ensure that every peso is used to meet our citizen's needs, and we will provide regular, detailed reports on the progress and impact of our projects."
MEX_debt_crisis.9.desc: "Your Excellency,\n\nRecent economic difficulties have laid bare the tenuous financial situation of Jalisco. That is why I must request from you an immediate influx of funding so that we can pay down bonds that are coming due. This is but a temporary setback and the money will be put to good use. When the original bonds were created Jalisco was trending upwards. Following the wisdom of your administration and previous administrations we doubled down on our success and invested in our future. However, as you know such processes are long roads with many bumps. That is why it is such a blessing to have federal protection meaning that said bumps will not end our journey.\n\nWe will pay you back in kind with an improved economy and revenue generating industries. Our shortfall is merely a setback that some investors have taken as a possible pattern. Their confidence is temporarily shaken by news of delays on some of our many projects. But I assure you that their actions are nothing but capitalist overreaction. Projects like our new gas pipelines and our electrification campaign are progressing within acceptable parameters. In fact, I plan to personally intervene in the construction process to get all problems cleared up. Soon the state will be more productive and attractive than ever! We just need that little boost."
MEX_debt_crisis.10.desc: "We, the governors of Yucatán, Campeche, and the Quintana Roo territory, are writing this letter to beseech aid for our states' industrialization. We have found ourselves in a most frustrating situation: our relative remoteness has repeatedly drawn away the needed capital and resulted in banks withholding investments and loans from us when needed. However, in our efforts to mitigate this distance through infrastructure projects, we have been unfairly subjected to the doubt and wrath of financial markets.\n\nThis has left us in a quagmire, and the only way we can move forward is with your help, lest we remain forever trapped in this tragic spiral."
