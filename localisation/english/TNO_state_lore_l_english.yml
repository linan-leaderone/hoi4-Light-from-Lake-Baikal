 # Notes
 
 # [GetSLName] is a scripted loc used to get custom names, for example, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macaw's name is called "The Three Pearls" instead of the usual state name it's parented in, located in TNO_state_lore_misc_scripted_localisation.txt
 
 # INITIALS are preferably airport codes: for example LAX as Los Angeles, but not when it doesn't make sense, i.e. OPO as Porto. I chose to use POR in that case.

 state_lore_initials.1: "GER"
 state_lore_name.1: "Germania"
 state_lore_desc.1: "Welthauptstadt-Germania may look like the shining fruit of the Führer's labor, but its roots run deep, as does the rot infecting it.\n\nHundreds of meters below Speer's elegantly designed promenades and Hitler's megalomaniacal symbols of his will, great concrete and steel superstructures groan under the weight of the Welthauptstadt, while pumps run round the clock to keep the swamps of Old Berlin from swallowing the Führer's vision.\n\nThe tremendous, and classified, cost of reshaping Berlin far exceeded even the plunder of a dozen nations, and outside the whispering grand halls of the city centre, the Berliners of old still live like before Germania's rise, or in cheap apartment blocks for the unemployed masses."

 state_lore_initials.2: "TYO"
 state_lore_name.2: "Tōkyō"
 state_lore_desc.2: "Beneath the facade of the mighty "eastern capital" of the Empire of Japan, behind the curtains of the Imperial Palace and its bustling wards, and under the blanket of the city's lively aura lies great sorrow and corruption.\n\nIn military headquarters, IJA Generals and IJN Admirals constantly try their earnest to foil the plans of the other as they scheme their own, and those willing to cooperate plan the next operation to put down freedom fighters somewhere in the Sphere.\n\nIn the halls of the national diet, politicians bicker of their own 'correct' way of running the nation and the Empire, seemingly without end. Not to mention the corruption that runs deep within the veins of every politician, the one that replaces their will to shape a better future for Japan with their want of money.\n\nPerhaps, it is best to keep these facts out of mind and enjoy the great sights of this bastion of Japanese glory."

 state_lore_initials.3: "YOK"
 state_lore_name.3: "Yokohama"
 state_lore_desc.3: "There exists few twin cities around the world, most cities differ in one way or another with their neighboring cities, but such is not the case with Yokohama and Tōkyō.\n\nAt face value, these two cities can be seen as carbon copies of each other. Tōkyō and Yokohama are the largest and second largest cities respectively in terms of population size, they are both economically vital to the Japanese Empire, and they are both large port cities with hundreds of ships dropping anchor there each day.\n\nThe city's prominence as a port city can be traced back from near the end of the Edo period, and it is where Commodore Perry first landed and forced in the modern age.\n\nToday, along with civilian ships, Yokohama is a major naval base for IJN fleets, enforcing the will of the Empire around the home islands as well as a base of operations for naval movements across the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Pacific Ocean."

 state_lore_initials.4: "LAX"
 state_lore_name.4: "Los Angeles"
 state_lore_desc.4: "The largest city on the west coast. The third largest city in the country. The home of America's, and arguably the world's, entertainment industry.\n\nThe story of Los Angeles is full of controversy, but no one can say it isn't interesting. Originally a small coastal town, LA began to grow rapidly towards the end of the nineteenth century, continuing unabated through World War 2 and even the 1950s following the Japanese seizure of the port.\n\nAs the home of Hollywood, LA has earned a reputation as a land of glitz and glamor, though the diverse and often impoverished neighborhoods of the growing city are on the front lines of America's civil rights movement."

 state_lore_name.5: "[Statelore_Get_Losangeles_name]"
 state_lore_name.5_USA: "Port of Los Angeles"
 state_lore_name.5_JAP: "Rafuko (Port of Los Angeles)"
 state_lore_desc.5: "At the height of World War 2, the port of Los Angeles employed almost 100,000 Americans. These days only a small fraction of that number turn up for work every day, and a different flag flies over the warships that fill the harbor.\n\nAs one of the two Japanese concessions bordering the American mainland, the port of LA is a constant hotspot of world tension. Japanese and US soldiers watch each other from behind checkpoints, and both the sailors of the IJN and the residents of LA hope their uncomfortable proximity never escalates to hostility.\n\nWhile some demand the United States take action and reclaim it, their pleas fall deaf, §Rfor now.§! §YPerhaps one day, a President bold enough may take back the ports, or possibly even more.§!"

 state_lore_initials.6: "SFO"
 state_lore_name.6: "San Francisco"
 state_lore_desc.6: "Following the gold rush of 1848 San Francisco became the largest city on the west coast of North America. Though it has since been surpassed in size by the likes of Los Angeles and San Diego, it retains its importance as a center of American finance and cultural development.\n\nThe rolling hills and rail-lined streets of San Francisco have long been a home to America's more eccentric elements and the budding counterculture, most recently manifesting as the beat movement of the 1950s, though many suspect this is only a hint of what is soon to come for the city by the bay."

 state_lore_name.7_USA: "Port of San Francisco"
 state_lore_name.7_JAP: "Kuwako (Port of San Francisco)"
 state_lore_desc.7: "Much like its European namesake, the Paris of the West is a city divided. Though most of the city remains in the USA, the port facilities have been held by Japan since 1945. One of the farthest flung territories of the Japanese Empire, the port of San Francisco is a major asset to the sphere.\n\nThe tiny sliver of Japanese territory, along with its southern counterpart in Los Angeles, are constant sources of tension between two of the world's superpowers, but as long as the Japanese retain their ability to immediately threaten the entire west coast, they're happy to pay that price.\n\nWhile some demand the United States take action and reclaim it, their pleas fall deaf, §Rfor now.§! §YPerhaps one day, a President bold enough may take back the ports, or possibly even more.§!"

 state_lore_initials.8: "NYC"
 state_lore_name.8: "New York City"
 state_lore_desc.8: "The very definition of a city that never sleeps, New York City is the fruit of the labor of generations of hardworking individuals, with an astounding amount of commerce passing through it each and every day.\n\nFirst settled by the Dutch in 1624 as New Amsterdam, it changed hands over the centuries and now stands as a proud bastion of American freedoms, exemplified by the Statue of Liberty in its harbor. Countless different cultures have taken root in the city, long a relative safe haven for oppressed peoples from all over the world from tyranny in their distant homelands.\n\nEqually attractive as the open mindedness of the city, however, are its open markets, being one of the premier centers of international business and finance as well as the greatest display of American economic might. There's always something to do in New York for any person willing to pay the right price."

 state_lore_initials.9: "D.C."
 state_lore_name.9: "Washington D.C."
 state_lore_desc.9: "To describe Washington, D.C. as just a city would be entirely inappropriate. D.C. is more than a collection of buildings or roads, it is more than the amalgamation of human will, forced together into an urban sprawl that defines D.C.\n\nNo, what defines the District of Columbia best is the building on the hill- the home of freedom and security, in a world where such a commodity is hard to come by. Such freedom is not fought over for the denizens of this city, but fought with, in the halls of Congress, where issues of undeniable importance are fought over and where the future of the nation as a whole is decided.\n\nWith the stirring winds of democracy blowing strong, and the future uncertain as ever, these freedoms of democracy are more than something to ensure freedom, but something to hold on to in these turbulent times. May they protect us forevermore."

 state_lore_initials.10: "ROM"
 state_lore_name.10: "Rome"
 state_lore_desc.10: "Rome, the Eternal City, stands as the jewel of the Mediterranean and the capital of the Italian Empire. Founded millennia ago by Romulus on the banks of the Tiber, few cities- if any- can claim such an expansive history. Indeed, there's not an inch of the city that isn't rich with the legacy of the Roman Empire, the pride of Italian history.\n\nDespite the invasions, plagues, and misfortunes that have fallen on the city before, Rome has always emerged from the rubble, ready to rebuild- and, in doing so, has cemented its place as the center of Italy. It is here where the King, the Pope, and the Duce stay, and it is here that the Italian government sits, along with artists, culinary geniuses, and romantics from across the world.\n\nMake no mistake- Rome has survived thousands of years before, and- barring the apocalypse- it will survive thousands of years more."

 state_lore_initials.11: "MAD"
 state_lore_name.11: "Madrid"
 state_lore_desc.11: "Previously devastated by over two years under siege during the Spanish Civil War, Madrid has recovered to become the largest and wealthiest city in Iberia.\n\nThe unique and varied designs of Madrid's "Gran Vía" is admired by architects and artists the world over. Most of the country's brightest minds attend university here, nearly all Iberian films are produced here, and most of Iberia's largest companies are headquartered here.\n\nAs Iberians increasingly choose to leave the countryside for the city, tens of thousands move to Madrid every year, this rapid expansion has made Madrid into one of the single largest cities in Europe--and there are no signs that this growth is slowing down."

 state_lore_initials.12: "HAM"
 state_lore_name.12: "Hamburg"
 state_lore_desc.12: "At the mouth of the Elbe lies the Hanseatic City of Hamburg, the third largest city in Germany behind only Vienna and Germania itself. The birthplace of the Hanseatic league, since medieval times Hamburg has been the preeminent naval port connecting Germany to the rest of the world. In the post-war order, her stature only becomes more significant.\n\nBut little is stable in Hamburg. A hotbed of liberal agitation since the 19th century, Hamburg now finds itself torn between the reformists, the conservatives, and behind closed doors, even anti-fascist revolutionaries.\n\nBut for the subversives captured by the Gestapo, a horrible fate lies just a few miles upstream. There sits Neuengamme, the largest concentration camp in Germany proper, a symbol of Nazi tyranny in the eyes of nearly the entire world."

 state_lore_initials.13: "FRA"
 state_lore_name.13: "Frankfurt am Main"
 state_lore_desc.13: "Lying directly in the center of Central Europe's most densely populated and economically productive region, Frankfurt am Main is in many senses an enormous monument to German industry. Every year, thousands of the best minds and most talented workers in all the Reich make Frankfurt their home.\n\nBefore Hitler's rise to power, thousands of the best minds and most talented workers in all Europe would seek to make Frankfurt their home. Once the home of Germany's largest Jewish community, widely regarded as the birthplace of German liberalism, and recognized as a center of the European labor movement, Frankfurt has now stagnated for decades, as skill and ingenuity are abandoned for the convenience of slave labor.\n\nNevertheless, Frankfurt remains one of Germany's largest cities, and serves as the main railway junction between the Rhineland and the rest of the country."

 state_lore_initials.14: "MUC"
 state_lore_name.14: "München"
 state_lore_desc.14: "München, also known as Munich in English, has played a pivotal role in German history for centuries. It served as the capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria, hosting thinkers and creators from Max Planck to Richard Wagner. But it took on a far greater significance in the last half-century: the cradle of the Nazi Party.\n\nFollowing the German defeat in the First World War, München was a chaotic place, as two competing revolutionary socialist governments clashed with the Freikorps in the streets. It was in this environment where a small group of nationalist ideologues and disgruntled veterans coalesced to form the German Workers' Party.\n\nOne of its members, an Austrian-born veteran named Adolf Hitler, would climb the ranks and become its leader, transforming it into the National Socialist German Workers' Party. It was in the beer halls of München that Hitler built his first power base, and launched his failed putsch in 1923. It was where the Nazi Party established their national headquarters. And it was where Hitler convinced the British and French to cede him Czechoslovakia to secure a peace he had no intent of keeping. München remains a bastion of Nazism today, and he who is most influential in it has the key to the Nazi heartland."

 state_lore_initials.15: "BIO"
 state_lore_name.15: "Bilbao"
 state_lore_desc.15: "Sitting beside Iberia's most fertile estuary, atop a mountain of iron ore, Bilbao was always destined to become one of the great industrial cities of Iberia. But Bilbao is also the cultural capital of the Basque people, who have lived in Iberia for centuries and likely millennia, longer than the Latins.\n\nGradually stripped of their autonomy, and their traditional culture challenged by Spaniard encroachment, much of the city's youth views 'Iberian unity' as a polite euphemism for repression. Bilbao will no doubt be the site of many political battles in coming years."

 state_lore_initials.16: "BCN"
 state_lore_name.16: "Barcelona"
 state_lore_desc.16: "The head and heart of Catalonia was the first of Iberia's cities to fully industrialize, but recent decades have brought immense hardship to the people of Iberia's largest Mediterranean city.\n\nFor two and a half years during the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona was the capital of an abortive anarchist revolution. In a city further destabilized by repressive policies targeting the Catalan people, and further jeopardized by economic stagnation, the memory of that revolution lives on.\n\nBarcelona has suffered from steady economic decline in recent decades. Should the situation fail to improve, already widespread anti-government and separatist sentiments may become overwhelming."

 state_lore_initials.17: "POR"
 state_lore_name.17: "Porto"
 state_lore_desc.17: "Portugal's second largest city was the birthplace of the medieval Portuguese Kingdom, as well as the 1926 revolution which began Salazar's rise to power.\n\nThough the exceptionally fast growth of Lisbon has reduced the relative importance of Porto it remains the largest manufacturing hub in the whole country. The population of Porto is somewhat more conservative than the rest of Portugal, and support for Iberian Unity is much higher than in Lisbon."

 state_lore_initials.18: "LIS"
 state_lore_name.18: "Lisboa"
 state_lore_desc.18: "Once the Shining Jewel of all the World's Desire, Lisboa, forged by Ulysses has suffered much over the years. Yet, the 20th century has pumped fresh blood into the aging collosus. Thanks to the extermination of their Atlantic rivals by Hitler's craven ambition, Lisboa reemerged as the most paramount port city in Western Europe, serving as a beacon for commerce and migration to any Eastward Travellers from the Americas. With the entry to the Tejo guarded by Christ on one side and the New Colossus on the other, Lisboa is without question the city that bears the ripest fruit from the so-called "Iberian Project".\n\nDespite this untold prosperity, its citizens do not find themselves wholly supportive of the regime that governs them. Torn between the mays of Charybdis - Caetano's Reformist influence on the city from his position of Dean of the University of Lisbon - and the many heads of Scylla - Borges' Conservative compadres in the City Council - the ideals of Liberalism and Socialism call Lisboa home. From the dock workers to the university students, the city would become a beacon for Reformist thought, at least outside its government. Despite itself, Lisboa still stands tall as a bastion of concord in the barbarity that is Europe in the 20th century, even if some inside it would prefer for it not to be the case. However, as for what the future holds? Only Christ understands. And he is content to watch over the city in stony silence."

 state_lore_initials.19: "SVL"
 state_lore_name.19: "Sevilla"
 state_lore_desc.19: "The heart of the old Spanish empire, Sevilla was one of the largest, wealthiest, and most magnificent cities in early-modern Europe. These days, it finds itself being overtaken by other cities, playing second fiddle to Rome, Hamburg, and even Lisbon in terms of trade and economic activity, with its fortunes being further hampered by heavy flooding and unusually heavy rain that has even once led to the city being marked as a disaster zone.\n\nHowever, with a growing industrial sector and its population appearing to be on the rise more and more each year, Sevilla seems ready to take its place as one of the most prosperous cities of Iberia soon. Concerning to some and inspirational to others, Sevilla is also one of Iberia's most prominent centers of underground liberal political organization in the country, with rumors of a thriving hotbed of illegal trade unionism operating within the city."

 state_lore_initials.21: "BES"
 state_lore_name.21: "Brest"
 state_lore_desc.21: "France has been a thalassocratic power for much of its history, owning most notably to its numerous overseas possessions, but also to its large coast bordering the Atlantic Ocean: Brest, standing at the westernmost point of the Breton peninsula, is one of France's proudest outposts, and sternly glares at the sea, its numerous lighthouses having lit the paths of many a lost sailor.\n\nHowever, whispers abound in Breizh, as the Quiberon peninsula has recently gone silent. Rumors of disgruntled nationalists finally deciding to act are growing louder and louder, and soon darkness may manage to do what the ocean never could: engulf Brest, and Brittany as a whole, once and for all."

 state_lore_desc.22: "Gallic tribes founded Poitiers years before Caesar's arrival, and Poitiers has played host to French victories during the Battle of Tours and French defeats during the Hundred Years War.\n\nThe city has been a university town, a hotbed of religious conflict, and a garrison town all within several centuries. Nowadays, Poitiers finds itself in an interesting position, halfway between Paris and Bordeaux. The central-western town of France is once again a strategic location for the three divided powers seeking to rule their fraction of Western Europe."

 state_lore_initials.23: "BOD"
 state_lore_name.23: "Bordeaux"
 state_lore_desc.23: "The Moon's Harbor, as it is often called, is one of France's biggest and populous cities, and one that was left relatively unscathed by the multiple turmoils France had to endure. Renowned the world over for its tasteful wine, with its historical monuments being a source of pride, Bordeaux truly stands today as one of the country's most important cities.\n\nBordeaux being mostly spared from hardship came from no miracle, however. Mayor Adrien Marquet's enthusiastic collaboration, along with the founding of pro-PPF college Sciences Po Bordeaux in the late 40s, ensured that the city would be viewed as a bastion of the Révolution Nationale, free from the corrupting influences of reformism and bolshevism. How much more can the Harbor last, however, before the flood gates forcibly open?"

 state_lore_initials.24: "MRS"
 state_lore_name.24: "Marseille"
 state_lore_desc.24: "Founded in 600 BCE as one of the oldest cities in Europe, Marseille has stood tall from its ancient Greek origins to its contemporary French authority.\n\nDevastating civil wars, barbarians, sieges, plagues, revolutions, and world wars have all conspired to destroy the ancient city, and World War II nearly cast the city into the inescapable fire, but its people have survived and thrived throughout.\n\nThe city saw Rouget de Lisle write the French national anthem, La Marseillaise. The old city stands today as one of the largest cities in France; may God preserve Marseille for many more centuries."

 state_lore_initials.25: "PAR"
 state_lore_name.25: "Paris"
 state_lore_desc.25: "Ask a Parisian about Paris in 1901, and he might have described it to you as the center of his country. Ask a Parisian about Paris in 1919, and he might have told you of it as the center of the world. Ask a Parisian about Paris today, and you will get a canvas of broken dreams and lost glory, a twinge of sadness in his eyes, for the years have not been kind to the Ville-Lumière.\n\nOnce a capital of all things cultured, Paris today stands as a shadow of its former self. The Haussmannian buildings frown at the daily sight of German soldiers, as Parisians try their best to live their lives in spite of all the hardships they have to endure. And yet, they live on, for better or for worse; for there is no alternative but to give in to despair, as the denizens of France know all too well."

 state_lore_initials.26: "N-PR"

 state_lore_desc.26: "Ever since the SS's attempt at seizing the Reich and their banishment as far west from Germania as possible, the City of Light has remained half shrouded in darkness - divided both naturally by the Seine and unnaturally by the harsh stones and barbed wire of the Paris Wall.\n\nHimmler's regime has crushed with an iron heel all that Parisians held dear in the parts of the city it controls, replacing them with brutalist monuments to Germanic culture and endless sprawls of guard-towers and searchlights glaring into every building and home in the city.\n\nWith every passing moment, the damage becomes more and more comprehensive - with the birth of every child christened in German rather than French, it becomes more irreversible. If there is one place in Europe that embodies the endless nightmare of the New Order, it is Nord-Paris."

The citizens of this city look upon the des Puys mountains and can't help but feel safe at the sight of them- volcanic or not they are far less dangerous than the outside powers that threaten the national sovereignty of their nation.\n\nAs people from across France and Europe travel to Clermont-Ferrant to study in the universities, they witness both culture and history. From the baroque Cathedrals to romantic art across the city, onlookers witness that France still is a nation of beauty and tradition."

 state_lore_desc.28: "The prized capital of Switzerland rests on a plateau north of the Alps, where it represents one of the oldest surviving confederacies in the world. The city demonstrates an interesting blend of some French and mostly German culture, having been a previous territory of the Holy Roman Empire and Revolutionary France.\n\nToday, the Swiss capital rejoices in its isolated independence. The city hosted socialist Internationals during World War I and saw frequent mediation and espionage between the Allied and Axis powers during World War II. Despite the heavy German influence felt in Bern, Swiss forces are always fiercely committed to maintaining everlasting independence in this time of global turmoil."

And yet, the city is not without its low points being a territory of Spain, France, and currently under Nazi German influence.\n\nDespite this, Amsterdam is slowly making a return to its glory days and reinforcing itself as a major trade city in western Europe."

It's a boogeyman for kids and adults alike, something like an asteroid falling towards France or a nuclear war wiping out humanity, the screaming of sirens as a bad storm hits, the idea of their borders coming any closer terrifies any man, woman, or child.\n\nAll of this doom and gloom there is a dichotomy for the heirs of the ancient Roman settlement of Divio. As the Church goers of this beautiful city go to mass, they pray to Saint Benignus and ask that the Burgundian storm never comes, and that they can continue to live their lives in peace."

It sits at the junction of the Rhône and Saône rivers. Its center reflects 2,000 years of history from the Roman Amphithéâtre des Trois Gaules, and shows its history with medieval and Renaissance architecture in Vieux. The great city of Lyon lays on the core clay of France and is a reminder of the greatness that the nation still has.\n\nWith a population center that helps fuel the nation's strength as well as civilian industry, should fate be kind again to France it can be utilized to make the nation great once more."

Nearly thousand years and many rulers later - the city was controlled by the Burgundians, Spanish, the Austrians, the French, and an independent Belgian kingdom - Brussels is once again under the thumb of Germans ruling from Burgundy. The Nazis made Brussels the capital of a Belgian Reichskommissariat when they invaded, and it remained in place for over a decade. After the West Russian War, the territory was handed over to Heinrich Himmler, for him to reshape into the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. Despite the disdain of the city's citizens, as well as the Flemish and Walloon SS divisions, Himmler is hellbent on restoring mythical German greatness to the city and all others under his rule."

 state_lore_desc.33: "Unlike many other cities in Ireland, Dublin was not founded by the Irish, or even the English. It was established by Viking raiders in the 10th century, and became the first Norman foothold on the island in 1171. It spent the following 750 years as the center of English, and later British, rule in Ireland, until Irish independence was achieved in 1921.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland selected the city as their capital, the greatest gem in the Emerald Isle's crown. Forty years after that, it is now the capital of an (ostensibly) united island, home to a government up to its neck in sectarian problems."

 state_lore_desc.34: "Although it has been inhabited since the Neolithic era, Belfast was a village of little note until a flood of trade and immigrants in the 17th century. It grew even further in the 19th century and became the heart of Irish industry, though its swelling population led to rising tensions between Catholic and Protestant residents. However, it was still a town dominated by pro-British Unionists, and became the capital of British North Ireland following the south's independence.\n\nThat all changed in the 1940s, when the Germans swept into Britain and the Republic took over the whole island. Belfast now sits on edge, capital of an autonomous zone whose people feel very strongly about their current political status, to say the least."

Elsewhere, you may find members of the British Free Corps, unchecked as they are, beating someone in a back alley, or perhaps on a bold day, the town square, within an inch of their life, for no reason at all.\n\nBut it is in the spirit, the essence, the soul, of this town, that the change is most notable. There is no more Sunday market, no more do children leave school with a steady pace and a trip to the shop. Much like the Cornish language before it, the city grows catatonic. No longer do the people look out and wave a cheery hello to a passing soldier, they can only shutter their windows in grim dread.

In those days, new trades and sciences attracted immigration, and the greatest architectural masterpieces—such as the Subway, Mitchell Library, Kelvingrove Park, and Milngavie Water Treatment Plants—had their beginning.\n\nThis was not to last. Recession in the 1910s followed by the Great Depression in the 20s and 30s led to a rise of radical socialism, the §R"Red Clydeside"§! movement. The city's recovery by the outbreak of World War II was disrupted first by Luftwaffe bombing and then the imposition of the collaborationist régime in London.\n\nIn what is best called an unofficial modern-day ghetto, Glasgow is now a city where the only thing sent from the South, from London, is increasing numbers of police. The Clydebank Blitz did little harm, but the British government's deliberate choice not to support Glasgow has done much more to push the city into decline. With tensions in Britain threatening to boil over yet again, §RClydeside may yet arise again—Red in tooth, maw, and claw.§!"

It felt like that for a century and a half after that, too - the Industrial Revolution and all its innovation, the Underground, the tea shops and new landmarks, and the fact that London was the financial centre of the world and of an Empire on which the Sun never set.\n\nThe Blitz came, and the people of London suffered terribly; more than thirty-thousand were slain, large tracts of housing were ruined, people fled in droves to the countryside and beyond. Had that been all that happened, London would have bounced back - but the Hitlerites had more in store for the prime city of Britain.\n\nThe capital of the United Kingdom fell to Germany after a long and bloody siege by Wehrmacht forces. Fighting in the outer boroughs had an intensity not seen since that of the Eastern Front. The city centre, however, was largely spared after Germany accepted its surrender. But the scars of the war still remain. There are many nights when the bars, which even in the Thirties were once full of Whitehall careerists and other assorted merrymakers, fall silent, and the scent and sounds of a city in decay slowly begin to overwhelm the senses."

Beginning as fortifications constructed by the Romans at Portchester, the settlement expanded under Henry II and his successors to become the greatest naval base in England, and a critical staging point for any invasion of the continent. Home to the world's first drydock and the world's first mass production line, the industrial revolution would see it transformed into the greatest fortress city in all the world, fielding a fleet no power on earth could match.\n\nHubris is a grievous sin though, and one Britain, and Portsmouth would pay dearly for. Crushed underfoot by the Germans and shackled to their new order, the Royal Navy found itself shrunk to a fraction of its size. German troops now bark harsh commands in Portsmouth's streets, ever vigilant for even the slightest hint of defiance. Sailors setting foot in port are greeted not by their families, but by German inspectors demanding to check for resistance gun smuggling.\n\nFormerly the conqueror and now the vanquished, Portsmouth has learned the meaning of a harsh proverb its ships inflicted on so much of the world: Vae Victis."

Tragically, Norwich's resistance would end just as Boudica's had, in fire.\n\nBombed more extensively than almost any city in all of Britain, Norwich's medieval architecture was torn to shreds by the wrath of the Luftwaffe. Taking advantage of a pre-existing redevelopment plan, much of the city was rebuilt into vast complexes by the new government in London, with Norwich's century old architecture torn down without sentiment.\n\nThis new and expanded housing has had an unexpected consequence for the government in London. With so many towns abandoned and rotting by England's decay, Norwich has become something of a site of pilgrimage for those discontent with the iron hand England has found itself under."

When invaders came to Britain's shores, Birmingham's motor and manufacturing industries rose to the challenge again, producing tanks and guns to stop the Hun's onslaught.\n\nIt would not prove to be enough. Birmingham's factories were leveled by the Luftwaffe, its streets stomped through by the jackboots of the Heer. The city's flame of industry burns for a new master now, scorching its workers under ever-growing shifts and the demand from the Reich for more cars, more equipment, ever more. Once crushed by the Germans, the city's factories have been rebuilt to serve them instead, under the guiding hand of Daimler-Benz and Reichswerke.\n\nThe greedy fingers of Germany have grasped Birmingham's industry tightly, but they may still find themselves burned by a steep lesson; a fire is easily lit, but can just as easily burn §Rout of control§!."

Manchester as a city has been beaten down and reforged to serve the whims of Frankfurt and Germania, with its workers living in slums while IG Farben and Siemens reap record profits. Ill fated risings such as that of '56 brought nothing but swift and vicious retaliation from the German garrison, and a gradual, drudging return to the gloom that permeated every inch of the city. Manchester's spirit has been broken, its task to labour for the Germans until they drop accepted at last.\n\nOr so the garrison believes.

Home to more than a third of the ethnically Russian population in the country, and its isolated location complicating efforts to assimilate its residents, Murmansk is a simmering hotbed of Russian nationalism.

Built upon the ruins of the former Aztec imperial capital Tenochtitlan and the drained lakebed it sat upon, the city, founded in 1524, subsequently became the political, administrative, and financial center of the Spanish empires' North American holdings.\n\nBeing the largest city in Mexico by a longshot, it naturally became the eponymous capital of the newly-independent nation in 1824, receiving its "federal district" status shortly thereafter in 1837. A century later in 1928, General Obregón, seeking to quell the near-constant coups and insurrections targeting CDMX, effectively placed the local government under federal control, stripping the city of its representation – a state of affairs which continues to this day to the ire of many.\n\nA center of progressive ideals and the source of much of Mexican culture, the rapidly growing city is the definitive central hub of Mexico, with a population over four times that of the next largest; it is a titan that often overshadows the rest of the nation with its influence, both material and not. Within the city's government buildings, administrators and deputies constantly debate new policy and chafe under the corrupt political machine. Meanwhile, within the iconic checkerboarded blocks and city slums, markets thrive and activists gather to protest.\n\nWhatever the future of Mexico brings, it will most likely be decided in this sacred capital."

Named after the Good Friday on which it was founded by Hernán Cortéz in 1519, the fledgling port became the gateway to Europe from New Spain, attracting immigrants to the colonies and playing host to a wealthy "Treasure Fleet" merchant class that, at times, surpassed that of Mexico City. It was only fitting, then, that this city would be the site of the Treaty of Cordóba, marking the independence of Mexico from Spain.\n\nConquering powers would return here multiple times, however: It would be here where Maximillian I would first step foot on Mexican soil, and it would be here where the United States invaded and occupied a major Mexican city for 7 months during the revolution – a sore point in the history of the two's relationship.\n\nThough the trade with the old world has dried up since the Second World War, its mercantile legacy remains in the form of its cosmopolitan blend of Spanish, Indigenous, and Afro-Caribbean culture.

Yet as the murky tides of time flow, foam, and clash, eventually it would be neither of those currents under which the pearl would find itself interred.\n\nInstead, when the dust of the Second Sino-Japanese War settled, it found itself, as the rest of Asia did, at the mercy of the New Order. It was to be reforged from the ground up, decreed the new Japanese masters, into a brand new hub of technological might, a brand new capital of a brand new state, in which possibilities shall branch and blossom until only infinity remains. The city today known as Kōshu gleams not with the vigor of life, but with incandescent bulbs - their light, fluttering and seeping through the billboards, the overcrowded housing blocks, and the noxious smog that have come to define its skyline.\n\nIn the few parts of the city that could be considered healthier to live in, Japanese contractors, foremen, and business professionals cluster together, trying to block out the view of the rest of the city; it matters to few - if any - of them how many of the Chinese majority lost their limbs today.

When Peter the Great established it, he called it Sankt-Pieter-Burch, then he had it renamed to Saint Petersburg. In 1914, it was renamed Petrograd; in 1924 it was renamed Leningrad after the death of Lenin. After the conquest, it returned to the German translation of its original name.\n\nThe old city - a fusion of Western European and Russian inspirations - was utterly razed after the war and rebuilt in the Nazi fashion. As in the case of Moskau, countless workers and ordinary people in the city centre were forced to the suburbs. But since many of those involved in the rebuilding were allowed to remain after its completion, the segregation and mobility restrictions are less strict.

In 1917, Tsaritsyn fell under Soviet control, but the Whites fought hard to regain control over it for three years. Five years after the Whites were defeated, the city was named Stalingrad for Iosef Stalin, who played a key role in the battle; it was known by this name until Field Marshal Paulus conquered the city during the Second World War.\n\nNowadays, Paulusburg is the second centre of the Moskowien administration after Moskau. Half of it was razed and rebuilt completely to suit German aims. Countless Russians were expelled to the hinterlands or forced to work themselves to the bone in factories, leaving Paulusburg as the city most dominated by the Germans in all of Moskowien."

Suddenly, from the monotonous sandy plain of the Atacama, rises pillars of glass and steel. This is Antofagasta, a city that men have fought and died for.\n\nAntofagasta in its modern role serves as the center of the sizable Chilean mining industry, and it has always been a desired jewel of the Andean nations. Originally a Bolivian nitrate mining settlement, the nascent "La Chimba" was the center of a massive Chilean immigration wave in the mid-to-late 1800s.\n\nA lucrative mining town with a large ethnic minority on an international border was, unsurprisingly, a center of conflict. Growing tension between Chile and Bolivia over territorial disputes and a Bolivian tax on Chilean nitrate mining companies would culminate in the 4 year long War of the Pacific. Chile, despite the odds, defeated the combined Bolivian and Peruvian armies over the course of the war, ultimately gaining the resource-rich Bolivian coastline, including the city of Antofagasta.\n\nNow, Antofagasta is the center of one of the world's largest nitrate and copper mining operations, and modern innovations in the field of electrochemistry mean that the mining companies have begun to tap into the region's large lithium reserves. Antofagasta, it would seem, is a city on the rise, and a worthy holder of the title of "La Perla del Norte"-- The Pearl of the North."

Though disrupted and perturbed by the changes in the geopolitical order, the vast Chilean maritime industry continues to churn, bringing dwindling income to the city, but endless nets of fish.\n\nValparaíso itself languishes in the way that only a port city past its golden era can. Many of the city's famed funiculars no longer run; its labyrinthian cobblestone streets are no longer safe to wander. Without any major investment or attention, the city has slid into grime and alienation. With grime and alienation come extremism, and Valparaíso thus serves as the center of the Chilean socialist movement: the dockworker's union is known to be one of the most volatile and ideologically driven in the nation, leading many strikes and demonstrations.\n\nAmidst the red banners and aging shipyards, ships marked with the white torch of the OFN dock at the city's port daily. To liberal-minded Chileans, this showcases the collaborative relationship between Chile and the United States, and is evidence of strong foreign investment. To Chileans dissatisfied with the status-quo, it is undue American exploitation of Chile's natural bounty. Valparaíso may have lost its luster as a jewel, but it is still a vital center of the Chilean economy and culture; even the most cynical citizen of Valpo still has dreams of a gleaming city."

In particular, the 1939 and 1960 earthquakes were some of the most powerful ever recorded, and both brought the city to lows it had not felt in centuries. The other side of the claret motif, however, is that pumping blood necessitates a heart-- Concepción prospers despite it all. It has never failed to rebuild itself, unflinching in the face of rending earth or fiery war.\n\nFollowing the Arauco War, Concepción quickly realigned itself from a military city to a cultural one, and its meteoric economic rise has made Concepción the undeniable beating heart of southern Chile.

President Manuel Bulnes of Chile, attempting to reassert Chilean claims, established Fort Bulnes in 1843. The Chileans arrived a single day before the French, who themselves were narrowly ahead of the British. Had they arrived any later, the city may have been named Sandy Point or Point de Sable instead of Punta Arenas.\n\nFort Bulnes, over time, outgrew the rocky outcropping on which it was established, and in 1848, it was reestablished on the banks of the nearby river Las Minas as the part-penal colony, part-civilian settlement Punta Arenas. The city's location on the undisputed center of Atlantic-Pacific trade as well as the discovery of gold contributed to the city's massive growth in the late 1800s, and while the opening of the Panama Canal caused the city to fall from its mercantile apoapsis and stagnate, it is still a city of key strategic and cultural importance.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese were able to recognize Changsha's strategic importance as the crossroads of southern China. Changsha came under near-constant assault, having 4 campaigns launched against it by the Imperial Japanese Army, eventually capturing the city in 1944. The city was left devastated.

With Japanese boots in Chengdu by 1947, they found themselves in a city of rubble.\n\nWhile the city's large population and the plentiful resources of the Sichuan Basin resulted in a speedy recovery for Chengdu, being more than 800 miles away from Nanjing meant that when Japanese forces left China and the RGOC took over occupation, resistance cells activated en-masse.

With a history dating back at least 3,000 years, Chongqing has often been at the center of Chinese politics, with many governments having the city as their head. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chiang's Kuomintang was one such government. Being the head of operations for the Chinese and American armies in China and South East Asia, Chongqing faced heavy bombing by the Japanese. While much of the population was able to take refuge in air-raid shelters, the city's industry was hit hard by Japanese attacks, and when Japanese troops finally occupied the city during the waning stages of the war, there wasn't much left.\n\nOf course, Chongqing's population wasn't content with a ruined city. Chongqing's position in the Sichuan basin gave it ample resources to rebuild, and together with its large population, Chongqing was able to rebuild faster than most Chinese cities. Of course, to end here would be telling only half of the story.\n\nFar away from Nanjing and the central government, Sichuan has often been difficult for the RGOC to control. Communist guerrillas, Kuomintang hold-outs, and unhappy peasants are in near-constant uprising and make Chongqing's wealth much harder for the central government to exploit. Unlike in other provinces, such as Shanxi, Nanjing is much more unwilling to give the riches of Sichuan to a power-hungry warlord. This arrangement means that while Chongqing is a city full of wealth and industry, it goes unused and unavailable.

That was until 1919 and the advent of the 21 demands, seeing Japan cement its hold over German operations in Shandong, including the vital Jiaoji railway that connected Jinan to the sea. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Jinan was targeted early on in the war due to its strategic importance.\n\nIn late 1937, the Japanese crossed the Yellow River and began marching towards the city. Chinese troops abandoned Jinan and were ordered to burn down government buildings, as well as the Japanese consulate. The ensuing power vacuum led to Jinan descending into chaos. Japanese forces arrived in the city less than a week later, quelling the chaos and beginning their harsh occupation. Jinan, being developed by both German and Japanese investors in years past, had large industries that the Japanese took full advantage of for their war effort.\n\nAfter the Japanese war economy began to demobilize and move out of the area, failings of the new central government began to arise.

After the capture of Taiyuan in late 1937, the Japanese exploited Taiyuan to its fullest extent. Taiyuan was able to supply the IJA well in its campaigns to root out the Communist base areas in Northern China. Taiyuan saw little growth during this time, as resources and material were shipped out of the mountains of Shanxi and into the war machine of Japan. Due to its manufacturing importance, Taiyuan was going to be an important city for the new central government to control.\n\nUnfortunately for the RGOC, the situation on the ground was becoming less and less favorable for the central government. Unable to control the outer reaches of China, the new government allied with Yan Xishan, granting him de facto control of the province. With Yan now dead, Fu Zuoyi ruled as his successor and proved to be much more conservative than Yan.

In the modern day, Wuhan is one of the only cities in China not plagued with uprising or instability. Wuhan remains one of the most important cities for the Chinese government to hold onto."

 state_lore_desc.132: "Xuzhou is an incredibly large city of Jiangsu province, and as such, has been a priority for any aspiring warlord or invading army. In the Xinhai Revolution, Xuzhou was thrown into the thick of fighting with Zhang Xun's army capturing the city soon after the revolution, making it his base of operations. When the Northern Expedition reached Jiangsu, the Kuomintang government fought back and forth with local warlords and Beiyang splitters. Eventually coming under the control of the KMT in late 1927, Xuzhou was looking to be an important city for the government to occupy if they wanted to stay in control of the lands around the Yellow River.\n\nIn 1938, with the Second Sino-Japanese War in full swing, the Japanese army descended on Xuzhou, sending panic through Chinese high command. The defense of Xuzhou was rushed, and while they showed early success in nearby battles, the situation was determined unwinnable and orders for a general retreat were given. Chinese forces breached the dykes holding back the Yellow River to cover their retreat, and the consequential 1938 Yellow River Flood destroyed much of Xuzhou and other nearby settlements.\n\nMore than 20 years after the horrific flood that flattened the city, Xuzhou is once more a jewel of the North China Plain, but to call the wounds of the Second Sino-Japanese War healed would be inaccurate. Struggling under the flatlining of the RGOC's economy, Xuzhou has found it difficult to rebuild above and beyond its pre-war economy."

All the same, it has gracefully adapted to Chilean rule, and serves as the capital of the Arica y Parinacota Region.\n\nBeing the closest port to the landlocked nation of Bolivia, the city also serves as a free port, allowing tariff free goods to flow in and out of the city. Such efforts have blossomed Arica into an undisputed regional center of industry and commerce, and allowed Chile's northern sentinel to keep careful watch over the red sands of the Atacama."

Only a few short years ago did the mountains collapse and the rivers overflow; only a few short years ago did untold numbers of fathers and mothers and daughters and sons drown in the mud. The Valdivia of 1960 was brutal and total in its destruction, and yet Valdivia stands firm. Rebuilding is a long (and perhaps never complete) process, but the swarms of proverbial ants have already built back up the hill.\n\nThe city has often been called the best defended city in the New World due to the extensive series of forts built by the Spanish during the colonial era, and it is perhaps this sense of physical resilience that gives the people of Valdivia their mental resilience.

Despite the nearby (and fairly active) Calbuco volcano, Puerto Montt remains fairly popular as a tourist destination, a fact that the recently-completed El Tepual Airport will only compound.\n\nThe capital of both the Llanquihue Province and the larger Los Lagos Region, Puerto Montt is often called the gateway to Chilean Patagonia (as well as being one of the sole transport links to the Chiloé Archipelago) which only serves to bolster its growing reputation as the de-facto center of Southern Chile.

To say it has historically been a place of poverty would not be telling a complete picture-- the term "poverty" simply does not cut it for the Iquique of yore.\n\nIt was no less than Charles Darwin who described it as a town "very much in want of everyday necessities, such as water and firewood", and it was no less than 2,000 striking saltpetre miners and their families who were massacred in 1907 as part of the Santa María School massacre. This is not to be unfair to modern Iquique; a wave of European immigration in the early 20th century as well as the city being declared one of Chile's two free ports led to immense development of the city. As it stands now, Iquique is a proud city that has overcome its tumultuous history in the noble manor of many of the old saltpetre towns of Northern Chile.\n\nThe Zofri (Zona Franca of Iquique, the free port) is one of the largest in South America; the city hosts museums and universities; there is even rumors of the formation of a professional football club; all the same, despite the idyllic modern Iquique, the brutal and deprived history of the city will never be forgotten.

Even then, however, the independent spirit of the people of Coquimbo could not be so easily put down-- the natural harbor benefits not just royal treasure fleets, but armadas of pirates and privateers. Between the natural coves, the bottomless gold mines, and the cultural inclination towards "laissez-faire" leadership, Coquimbo was a true den of men-of-marque; even in the modern age, the Coquimbo Unido football club is nicknamed "Los Piratas."\n\nThe city is by no means a cultural or economic center of Chile, but the people are fierce and happy and free, and the beaches are white and sandy."

The city has a long history stretching back to 1550, and by the War of Independence the city was the largest port in New Spain. The city had become a diverse community of Africans, Chinese, and Filipinos working alongside Spanish settlers, but during the course of the war a brutal siege saw the destruction of the port. The city languished for the next century and a half as it rode the ups and downs of 19th century Mexico.\n\nThe Revolution came and went, and Acapulco remained a relatively poor city. Its situation would finally change in the 1940s with the arrival of Miguel Alemán. As President, Alemán saw both the city's historical importance alongside its location along the coast as an opportunity for investment. With a surge of capital flowing into the city, Acapulco saw itself reclaim much of its colonial glory. With the building of an international airport in 1954, the city has ballooned in population and economic strength as American and Japanese tourists flock to see what has quickly become one of Mexico's greatest cities.

Founded in 1563 as a town meant for mining silver, the city instead grew around the large iron deposits of Cerro de Mercado. The mining bonanza led to the construction of many colonial-era mansions in the city's center.\n\nDuring the War of Independence, many leaders were executed in Durango on July 17th, 1812. Durango joined the Mexican Revolution in 1911, but its capture and burning by insurgents in 1913 plunged the city into a decades-long depression.

It has been the unwilling host to Miguel Hidalgo when he faced execution. It served as the de facto capital of Nueva Vizcaya, the first province of New Spain to be settled. Even the name "Chihuahua" is ancient, far older than the Spanish conquest; it comes from the Nahuatl language, and it fittingly means "between two waters." This moment in the city's history, the image of a desert Sodom meant only for the desperate and the foolish, this is only a momentary embarrassment.\n\nThe historical city of bankers and businessmen from the era of Porfirio Díaz will return, and with increasing American business opportunities just north of the border (and a few manufacturing plants just south of it), it is sure to return faster than anyone expected."

Historically, the region has been referred to as "El Gran Tunal", or "The Great Prickly Pear" due to the force with which the native people resisted the Spanish tide, and while the city is far from the days of conquistador and missionary, the people of SLP still hold their heads high with pride in their city.

Following the assassination of Francisco Madero in 1913, Venustiano Carranza began his Constitutionalist Movement in Hermosillo, which led to the city being dubbed as "the revolutionary capital of the country." Hermosillo remains economically isolated from the rest of Mexico and the world at large, but its proximity to the Pacific and the American border has led to increasing interest from American and Japanese investors, who'll hopefully bring the city into the modern era."

In many ways, the city is still reeling from penalties placed on Haiti by the powers of Europe since the revolution, and by the American occupation during the First World War. Despite all of this, Port-au-Prince will remain a home and hearth for the people of Haiti, forevermore."

It rises past the bronze statue of Juan Godoy, the man who discovered Copiapó's deepest silver mine. It rises past the Catedral de Copiapó, where an old priest aches with quiet divinity. It rises past the verdant farmlands, past the water of the Copiapó river. If you rode the steam up and up and up into the empty blue sky, you would see a thin strip of life nestled between the harsh bluffs of the Atacama. The metal beast screams, and begins to churn forward. The Copiapó-Caldera Railway - the first railway in all of South America - is open, and Copiapó will never be the same.\n\nA rich mining town, Copiapó is the ideal north Chilean city. It is a center of industry, culture, and government. Its silver and copper veins are deep and plentiful. It is centered on an Indian cemetery (with some remains being no younger than 10,000 years old). The people are happy, kind, and collaborative, and the city is flourishing under a local commerce boom. Originally settled as San Francisco de la Selva de Copiapó (or, Saint Francis of the Jungle of Copiapó), it has always been an oasis in the desert. It has always been the soul of Atacama."

Talca is the cradle of Chilean nationalism, founded once in 1692 and refounded in 1742, and perhaps founded a third time in 1818 as Bernardo O'Higgins penned the official declaration of Chilean independence from Spain while safe in the Mediterranean bosom of the Chilean Central Valley.\n\nThe Talquino people have a saying: "Talca, Paris and London". They are proud of their past, but satisfied in their present and secure in their future too. The city is known for its wine and wheat, but the nascent manufacturing economy is growing at a rapid pace, and the city is certain to burst from its banks and enter the halls of greatness. In time, "Talca, Paris, and London" shall grow from an ironic in-joke to a sincere statement of pride. At least, that is what the most starry-eyed Talquinos say."

In their folklore, it represents a sincere hope for peace and reason to prevail over the planet. Now, it appears that the city has a twin.\n\nBuenos Aires - or "Good Airs" - was founded on the 11th of June, 1580 by Juan de Garay. Buenos Aires, even then, was the lighthouse that guided so many to its white, sandy shores. Raided, destroyed, burnt or blockaded; the city has gone through every trial and every tribulation. Yet here it remains. For there is one crucial fact that dominates the long, triumphant reign of the Queen of South America.\n\nIn every corner, the city proudly displays its colours. Germans, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Spaniards - of course - and even Italians, who make up the biggest chunk of immigrants in the city, all have laid down their roots in the fair city. While Argentina's fate may flow and ebb along with the frothing tides of destiny, people of all shapes and sizes gather under the Fair Winds. Why?

The Central Produce Market, once the largest warehouse in the world, served as the country's central agricultural market, but its sharp decline over the past decade has made its closure inevitable.

Following the rise of the Peronist movement and the implementation of Perón's welfare politics, the city experienced a massive tourism boom.

Perfectly patterned roads cut through the city's blocks, and thousands of trees line the urban streets as great green shields from the sky.\n\nLa Plata is a major cultural and tourist center in Argentina, home to dozens of art centers, theaters, museums, libraries, and cinemas.

Rosario's railways and port are a key intermediary between Santa Fe and Buenos Aires.\n\nThe city boasts its own sizable chemical industry and trade board, with its production only outmatched by Buenos Aires.

Home to the Yaghan people, for most of history, Ushuaia served as any other spot in the bottom end of the Southern Cone, as a place where natives lived and died. Faced with bracing winters, and humid summers, Ushuaia is not an easy place to live in. Yet, it has transformed into something else.\n\nSomething much stranger, and more powerful than the former fishing village ever expected. Ushuaia has been turned into a chess piece, in a long and very intricate game against Chile. Argentina and Chile both demand and require the coveted title of "most Southern city in the world". While at first this may just seem like a vanity project, this "competition" has real, tangible consequences. The winner would have control over the entire Strait of Magellan, and all the trade that goes around it. While the Strait has been made mostly redundant due to the Panama Canal, much intercontinental trade - and naval ships - still pass through the region.

However, few realize that Hanoi is one of the biggest powder kegs in all eastern Asia.\n\nDuring the Japanese invasion of French Indochina, Hanoi became the birthplace of the Viet Minh movement, and from its countryside they started an insurgency that lasted years and saw the city almost conquered from Japanese forces.

Dubbed the pearl of the orient, its unique architecture and colonial history blended together to form a picturesque landscape that not many others could replicate.\n\nIf one were to pass through the city and take a gaze to their surroundings, concrete American tenements lay side to side with ancient Spanish forts and villas, forming a mosaic that molded the city into a window to the past with a touch of modernity bringing it to perfection.\n\nSeen on top of these sights are reminders of the last war, but one would have to squint their eyes to find them. Layered upon the destruction that the war brought are influences of the Japanese occupation. Highrises, temples, and starburst flags can be seen dotted about the city.

Under French Indochina, Saigon began its rapid development from small harbor to a large town for the colonial administration.\n\nThe urbanization process continued even after France left Indochina, as Japan tried to turn the city into a shining example of Pan-Asianism. However, Saigon is still a city full of contradictions: its slums are home to prostitutes, drug addicts, beggars, and orphans; while in the old city center, with its grand French colonial buildings and rational boulevards, corrupt officials and Japanese with money make deals.

Bearing the indelible heritage of its many overlords and occupants - architectural, cultural, and in demographics - Delhi as a whole is a microcosm of the mighty diversity that the Republic of India seeks its strength and legitimacy from.

As such, even after the nation's sudden independence and the ignoble ends of those feudal realms, the city forms the core of the new Republic's policies in the South and remains hotly contested between establishment Congress stalwarts and the growing 'Dravidian' movement, between Telugu and Tamil linguistic movements, and even hosting a significant Forward Bloc subparty.\n\nEven outside the political realm, Madras is one of the most rapidly industrialising cities in the south, with several significant architectural and development projects planned in and around it.

And yet, though the former Nizam may have been possibly the richest man in the world, his subjects languished under a feudal system that was downright mediaeval - a state of affairs that lasted unchanged till the sudden, ignoble end of the Raj herself. Suddenly free from obligation to an imperial overlord, the Nizam attempted to seize his independence and march Hyderabad onto the world stage as a nation of its own - until the Indian National Army marched to his borders, and he realised that obligations were not all he had lost - there was no longer any British Army to protect him from his own subjects.\n\nNow, Hyderabad exists as the grand capital of a nonexistent kingdom, the administrative centre of a state melding several linguistic minorities that seek to join states of their own majority or separate entirely, and a major centre of both Communist and (underground) Forward Bloc support within the Republic of India.

The area around Chicago was an important portage used by Native Americans for thousands of years for travel and trade, which in turn attracted settlers from the East coast and Louisiana. The city of Chicago went from having a population of 200 at the time of its founding to 110,000 in the span of a few decades. But in 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed much of the city, and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose a new metropolis, with modern constructions of steel and concrete, like the world's first steel-framed skyscraper.\n\nCurrently, Chicago is the foremost industrial and economic center in the Great Lakes, from its mills come out the steel used for tanks and planes for the US Armed Forces, but also for the cars and buildings used by the American people. This in turn requires large numbers of people to be employed as workforce, which is why Chicago is also one of the most prominent destinations for immigrants in the country.

The city is also one of the busiest ports in the northern Atlantic, which became the arrival point of many Irish immigrants looking for a better life on America's shores, in one of the first waves of migration that have shaped American society.\n\nThe Boston of today is a liberal bastion in America, owing to its large presence of college students enrolled in Harvard, and to the multicultural composition of the city inhabitants.

While Kennedy Sr is a controversial figure, he has kept alive the flame of liberalism in America, and his children, John F. and Robert F., are doing the same for the country.

This made it an important logistic hub during the Civil War, until general Sherman burnt the entire city down during his March to the Sea. But like the Phoenix reborn from its ashes, the people of Atlanta rebuilt the city during the Reconstruction, and the population skyrocketed as a consequence.\n\nToday Atlanta is a vibrant city with a large economy, hosting the headquarters of companies such as Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines, but beneath the façade lie simmering racial issues, with over 40 percent of the city population black and living under Jim Crow. Despite this, the black community of Atlanta has always strived to carve its own place in the city, by starting their own businesses; teaching in their own colleges; and campaigning against segregation. One black man in particular stands out in the fight for civil rights, Martin Luther King Jr, an Atlanta native who has brought the issues that black Americans face on a nationwide scale. Atlanta is in many ways a mirror of the South, a place of genuine Southern hospitality afflicted by racism, but it is also the only place where real change feels possible, and all its black citizens hope that one day they can claim the city as their own."

Following the discovery at Spindletop, thousands flocked to the area to dig deep and dig greedily for the elusive Black Gold inside the Red Sands of the Gulf.

The drop in global trade, the protectionism of the Hoover administration, and violent labor strife put the hammer on the city's once-bustling maritime traffic. The city's slow recovery was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War, bringing with it both government contracts and renewed prosperity, even as it shattered its nascent Japanese community.\n\nOnce a boomtown for logging and timber, Seattle now thrives beneath the mushrooming of jet-age industry and plentiful government contracts. A fact distinctly exemplified by the newly built Space Needle, an unmistakable sight in the city's skyline. The city's docks, however, remain barren. Once a hotbed of labor strife, isolation from East Asian markets has left Seattle's harbors as shadows of their pre-Depression selves."

A thriving center of American industry, a standing monument to American ingenuity, and a very American city of contrasts.\n\nOnce a French fur trading post, Detroit's location has seen it through wars and westward expansion. But the founding of the Ford Motor Company would change the city forever. From its perch between the Great Lakes, Detroit became the beating heart of the American automotive industry. Its towering factories and newfound assembly lines producing cars for the world over.\n\nBattered by the Depression, revived by the Second World War as the crux of America's "Arsenal of Democracy," the post-war years have not been kind to Detroit. Fluctuating demand and mass layoffs have provided the foundation for a robust labor movement, while racial tensions between black residents and white migrants have pushed the city to the forefront of the civil rights campaign.\n\nDespite it all, America's Motor City perseveres, producing vehicles for consumers across the Free World.

Its Austrian and Slavic souls coexisted for centuries before Ljubljana became part of Yugoslavia following WWI. During WWII, the city fell under Italy: now known as 'Lubiana', the city suffered horrendously under the fascist yoke, at one point being de facto turned into a massive concentration camp to curtail Slovene resistance. Since then, the situation has somewhat stabilized, while aggressive attempts have been made to refashion Lubiana into an Italian city, with extensive urbanization projects aimed at swelling the numbers of the Italian community and suppressing the Slovene nationality. Yet, the ancient and proud city, in the shade of its castle, has not yet bowed down, and under the ashes of past sorrow, embers of resistance still burn..."

 state_lore_desc.193: "Nestled away on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dammam's history and significance are far from being as rich or glorious as its counterparts on the Kingdom's western coast. Originally nothing more than a tiny settlement comprising an ancient fortress surrounded by a row of impromptu housing, the city would remain as such until the arrival of the fleeing al-Dawasir tribe from the isle of Bahrain. Yet it would only be with the arrival of the Arab-American Oil Company, almost two decades later, that the meagre locality would grow to become one of the Saudi Kingdom's most significant industrial cities as their discovery of petroleum reserves within the city's vicinity brought to it much needed attention from both the government and investors alike. Workers from across Arabia flood into the city, clouds of smoke rise into the city's sky, and streams of oil flow from beneath the ground as the chimes of industry continue to sound within the streets of the bustling city. While Dammam may grow and prosper into one of the Saudi state's most pristine metropolises, its lifeline has also proven to be its main curse, as the often-disgruntled workers of the Oil Industry continue to sow discord within the young city's foundations."

Sydney is a metropolitan, cosmopolitan dream afloat on Botany Bay and bristling with gun barrels, all aimed at Japan. It hosts Australia's most diverse population in multitudinous communities of expatriate Britons, French and Dutch citizens, refugee Jews and Soviets, and the small number of Indian and Chinese people who navigated the White Australia policy to escape Japan's tyranny in Asia. Sydney's Indigenous Australians, having endured the harsh yellow sun for thousands of years, suffering the weight of iron collars, stolen generations, and other policies of genocide, persist and will persist yet. They watch, as they have done for so long, over Botany Bay. They watch, as it seems they will for quite some time, over a city united in fear of the Pacific's vast horizon."

 state_lore_desc.195: "Tucked away deep in the Sierra Madre Mountain Range, the city of Zacatecas was founded in 1564 as one of the preeminent mining colonies of Spanish Empire, earning it the name "con rostro de cantera rosa y corazón de plata" or "with a face of pink stone and a heart of silver", referencing the deposits of pink sandstone and silver ore its mines and quarries were most famous for. Heavily valued by Spain for its mineral wealth as well as its strategic position, the city was also so thoroughly admired by King Philip II that it was granted the titles of "muy leal" and "muy noble", or very good and very noble respectively.\n\nWith the onset of the War for Mexican Independence, the people of Zacatecas proved themselves among the best and bravest of Mexico's patriotic revolutionaries, joining with Hidalgo's insurrection just days after the mythic Cry of Dolores, where it would succeed in fighting off the Spanish for a decade, eventually winning its independence from Spain along with Mexico, becoming the capital of the new and free State of Zacatecas in 1823.\n\nDuring the era of the 19th century, Zacatecas would become a growing center for the arts as part of a series of rapid modernization under the dictatorship of the Porfiriato, one that would be interrupted by the Mexican Revolution, where the city would become the site of the legendary, day-long battle where Pancho Villa's rebels triumphed over the army of Victoriano Huerta, considered by many to be one of the greatest and bloodiest battles of the revolution.\n\nIn the later half of the 20th century, the city has fallen on rough times; Mexican Revolution caused enough damage to the city to trigger a demographic freefall and atrophy, with parts of the city appearing almost abandoned. This lack of development crippled the economy of the city and lead to decades recession and decline, both made worse with the depletion of the cities silver deposits and little in the form of international investment.\n\nNot all is bleak in Zacatecas, however; the lack of development in the city allowed for it to retain a much older and more traditionally Mexican visual appearance and aesthetic, which has since allowed for the city to transition its economy towards tourism and commerce, with slow but moderate success."

Originally the crossing between the state of Missouri and the unorganized territory, with the signing of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, the city found itself in political limbo between the Free-Staters and Border Ruffians during the Bleeding Kansas period and into the Civil War as pro-Union and pro-Confederate paramilitaries clashed.\n\nPost-war, the city was at a literal crossroads. Being home to the Missouri River railroad bridge and Union Station, the city saw rapid economic growth from the New York-Kansas City-New Orleans rail line, with cultural exports from both cities pouring from the railway line.\n\nWith the end of WW2 and the creation of the Interstate Highway System, Kansas City has once again found itself at a crossroads, and with a unique opportunity. At the intersection of I-70 and I-35, its influence spans nearly the entire latitude and longitude of the contiguous United States, and with the continued expansion of both it and the old rail system, the city is poised to be one of the most important in America in the following century."

Chosen by Queen Victoria as the capital of the province of Canada because of its central and easily defended location, Ottawa has become one of the country's largest cities. The capital has also become home to numerous exiles from England, most notably the exiled Queen Elizabeth II and former prime minister Winston Churchill. Ottawa has recently undergone major development to alter its industrial aesthetic to something more modern and pleasing to the eye.

Montréal is the greatest economic hub in Canada, only rivaled by Toronto further inland, which has been steadily closing the gap. Montréal is more than just an economic hub; it is also the heart of French culture in Canada. Hundreds of Catholic churches inhabit the city, where English and French traditions combine into a unique cultural identity, one they will ardently defend until the end of time.

Calgary started as a fort built in 1876 until the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883. Calgary became like many towns that made up the American Wild West, with a dysfunctional local government and a slow economy. Despite the poor start, the city quickly grew into an economic and cultural center. The Calgary Stampede is an annual rodeo that's among the largest in the world. The discovery of oil has made it the center of the city's economy, which has also become the focus of Alberta's disputes with the government. The free spirit of Calgary represents the growing rift between Ontario and the west, and its citizens wonder if they'll ever be seen truly equally."

Incorporated as a city in 1886, Vancouver's connection to the Canadian Pacific Railroad that same year made it Canada's preeminent port of the West Coast. This opened the city to international trade and the city grew in wealth and size because of this trade.\n\nBut the end of the Second World War and the division of the world between fascist regimes and democracies signaled a decline for Vancouver. When the United States led the OFN to embargo the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the 50's, Pacific trade dried up and now every year fewer and fewer ships pass through the Port of Vancouver. It would take a drastic change in policy to improve this sorry state of affairs."

Despite the economic downturn caused by the loss of World War 2 and the Nixon Shock, Toronto has still rapidly grown as both migrants, immigrants, and refugees are drawn to the city's allure of prosperity. Toronto excels in finance, industry, and technology. Its cultural centers showcase art from dozens of countries. Its sports teams rival the Americans in spirit.

Halifax was founded in 1749, and the creation of the city immediately started a war with the Mi'kmaq peoples. In 1917, Halifax saw one of the greatest disasters in Canadian history when the French munitions ship SS Mont-Blanc detonated after colliding with another vessel. The blast caused 11,000 casualties. Aid from Boston forever tied the two cities together as a symbol of unity between the States and Canada. Halifax since then has continued to be a major harbor, host to large fishing operations as well as the core of the Canadian ship-building industry. Halifax remembers the shameful losses and mistakes of the past and hopes to never see them repeated."

American and Confederate flags flutter from the windows of old, three-story mansions. Women in mink coats chat outside Neiman Marcus, clutching pamphlets from the John Birch Society between their jeweled fingers. Just off Main Street, past the Romanesque court house, Dallas's pristine brick and concrete give way to clusters of falling-down shacks with no running water, their foundations sinking into the floodplain. On a cracked and staple-pricked telephone pole in the Fort Worth Stockyards hangs a poster reading, "SAVE YOUR RACE. JOIN THE AMERICAN NATIONAL VANGUARD."\n\nNot all are infatuated with these ideas of course. There are many Americans across the Metroplex opposed to the likes of Ted Dealey, whose ultra-conservative paper castigates Nixon and Kennedy as allies of socialism, communism, and the pope. There are many who march in opposition of the completely segregated school system, even as the powerful Baptist preacher W. A. Criswell snarls about the threat of the NAACP and CPUSA. Still, it is difficult to escape the atmosphere of white rage consuming this one-time headquarters of the KKK. Soon, the radicals here might do more than just talk. Someone might take matters into their own hands."

The population has dropped by almost one hundred thousand, and the already strong racial disparities have grown wider.\n\nHowever, one would have to be a fool to write the Mound City off. Home to the prestigious colleges that are Washington University and Saint Louis University, St. Louis is a hub of education in the Great Plains. Its long history has left its mark, monuments and commemorations galore hail the stories of great pioneers and the old French traders who first founded the city.

What was once a tiny farming community has exponentially exploded with the arrival of the railroads, the dams, the military bases, and the technology industry.\n\nMade possible through the wonders of air conditioning and the automobile, Phoenix represents the new American city of the 20th century. A center of modern skyscrapers and office buildings, surrounded by endless fields of developed housing, where each family can have a lawn and a carport. And every major American baseball team comes here to take advantage of the good pre-season weather and do some spring training.\n\nBut Phoenix is more than the picturesque representation of modern life in the land of the free. The ancestral lands of the tribes that populated the area are being dug up, the African American population redlined beyond the golf course, and the increasing quantities of auto traffic become bigger and bigger headaches. Indeed, Phoenix is the present of America, but it remains to be seen if that's good or bad."

Its neon lights and vibrant nightlife illuminate the otherwise empty expanse of southern Nevada. With an economic base founded on tourism and gambling, the city welcomes visitors and newcomers in skyrocketing numbers. The city's boom, and lax laws, have also drawn the attention of organized crime figures eager to cash in and whose influence pervades the city.

From there, it winds downstream, picking up width and speed until it turns into the force of God that defines the lands around it. It's during this early stage that the Old Man River cuts through the Twin Cities - Minneapolis and Saint Paul.\n\nMinneapolis began as land on a military base. Saint Paul was a collection of small villages. Saint Paul is the last city in the East, they say, and Minneapolis is the first city in the West. Minneapolis styles itself with urban renewal and modern architecture while Saint Paul maintains a classic Victorian style. The cities may be split physically by the river and their many differences, but their inexorable ties to one another have grown and flourished, developing a rich history and culture forged by freezing temperatures. Together they share the 7-time champion Golden Gophers, the newly founded Vikings, and the aptly named Twins, as well as economic prosperity and a strong hold over state politics.\n\nEven in the Minnesota cold, the heated rivalry between the two cities has defined their histories to the point of competitive cathedral building, architectural blacklisting, and even the kidnapping of census takers to prevent one city from being deemed larger than the other. Yet today, the internal troubles of each city is the focus of much concern. Both cities contend with unofficial segregation and deep roots of discrimination, despite their liberal tendencies. Both cities struggle with declining populations and labor disputes. Both cities pour effort into distinguishing themselves among the manufacturing metropolises of the Midwest who so often command the attention of America.\n\nStill, through the blizzards and tornadoes, the strikes and the riots, the decline of industry and the tensions of the Cold War, Minneapolis-Saint Paul endures and innovates. Each night, the people can look up to the sky, pick out the brightness of the North Star, and know that no matter what the future has in store, the Twin Cities will be ready to challenge whatever comes."

 state_lore_desc.208: "In the days of the pioneers and the Oregon Trail, families from the East traveled into the great frontier of the American west, unsure of what lay ahead of them. For many, their last place of rest and preparation before the venture was in a blooming town on the Missouri River. This is the city of Omaha, Nebraska, the Gateway to the West.\n\nOmaha is the second-largest city on the Great Plains today, home to over 300,000 people and swiftly rising. The imposing brick silhouettes of Jobbers Canyon form the heart of the burgeoning meatpacking and agricultural industry which dominates the local economy, while the golden fields of the Big O's surroundings are filled with wheat, corn, and other grains. Just a few miles south is the University of Nebraska, the largest college in the state and home to a resurgent Cornhuskers football team. When the sun sets on the prairie, you can count on the theaters and venues of the city's North Side to spill jazz and blues into the streets, the rich music developed by the sizeable Black population which calls Omaha their home.\n\nBut just as anvil clouds on the horizon signal incoming thunderstorms, so too does trouble creep towards the city. Rumors of railroad and meatpacking industry restructures threaten a massive wave of layoffs among the impoverished North Side, predominantly targeting Black laborers. While Nebraska has no segregation nor slaver history on the books, the city is governed unofficially by an everpresent policy of redlining and secret covenants keeping the communities apart, only recently even being challenged. Wealth disparity between White and Black citizens is among the highest in the nation. Tensions, always present and always bubbling, threaten to explode as the Civil Rights movement steams on - and, if the Red Summer of 1919 bears any relevance to today, an explosion means riots, lynchings, bloodshed, and death.\n\nOmaha teeters on the precipice of the future - economically as precarious as Detroit or Toledo, racially as fragile as Birmingham or Montgomery. Its fate relies as much upon itself as it does on the nation around it. What way America falls may decide whether Omaha has summer days or tornado season ahead."

Get closer and you can hear the saxophones and organs of jazz and soul sweep in alongside the drums and bass. Once you see the L&C Tower and the sound becomes overpowering, you know you've made it. This is Music City, where the dreams of country's most talented artists come to make their name.\n\nNashville finds its beginnings as a fort built during the Revolutionary War. Its strategic position on the Cumberland River instantly made it a quickly growing investment, both for military and economic purposes, and the city exploded in popularity as more Americans moved over the Appalachians. The Civil War mostly passed the city by, save for the early occupation by Federal forces and the Battle of Nashville in 1864, and that relative intactness allowed the city to prosper in the Reconstruction era and beyond. Healthcare, music, and universities such as Vanderbilt, Belmont, Tennessee State, and others have all become vital to the city's economy and culture, leading to the nickname "The Athens of the South".\n\nThe Athens of the South, however, is plagued by its original sin of slavery. Segregation and discrimination is buried deeply into Nashville's roots. The city itself was founded with slaves to work the streets. The Civil War ended the direct ownership of Black Americans, but Reconstruction brought no racial progress. The Daughters of the Confederacy made their home first in Nashville, and the first incarnation of the Klan found the city as one of its earliest hotbeds. The gruesome lynching of Ephraim Gizzard was only the beginning of the long, arduous, and brutal fight for equality in the city.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement has not left Nashville alone. Recent years have seen some steps forwards in the move towards equality, but the systems of segregation remain in place both officially and unofficially. Tensions smolder under the neon exterior of the clubs and the studios. Still, the people of the city have a lot to look ahead to. The healthcare industry is booming, outside companies are making their new home in the city, and the road for music's best keep leading to Tennessee. At the end of the day, as long as the guitars keep playing and the organs keep sounding their notes, Music City remains hopeful for a brighter future ahead."

 state_lore_desc.210: "In 1847, 14,000 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, under constant threat both legal and extrajudicial from the Protestant and Catholic majorities of America, made the decision to head west to seek land where they would not be persecuted. In the February cold, they left Nauvoo and trekked into the great unknown, slogging through mud and forced to drag themselves through mountains. It took until July 1847 for the first set of Mormon eyes to fall upon the Salt Lake Valley and the massive body of water beside it, nestled in the heart of the Great Basin - but when Brigham Young saw the view, he knew he had found their new home.\n\nAmerica caught up with the pioneers within the next 3 years, but the Mormons have never left. Through food shortages, harsh weather, armed conflicts, and disease, they staked their claim to their new lands tenaciously. In today's America, Salt Lake City is unique in its status as the largest majority-Mormon city in the country, the headquarters of the LDS church and the site of the gigantic Salt Lake Temple. Religion shows itself in the culture, the universities, the politics, and the people of the region. Few, if any, other cities in America can claim such united worship.\n\nTo focus on nothing more than Mormonism when talking about the Crossroads of the West, however, is to dismiss the culture of almost 200,000 Americans. The beauty of the mountain ranges which make up the edge of the valley is unparalleled, not to mention the strong skiing and hiking scene that comes with them. Beneath their snow-capped exterior, too, are arteries of silver and ore which have made up the bedrock of the region since the 1850's. The city itself, connected by its massive blocks and six-lane streets, has theaters, parks, and a small but vibrant music scene. Finally, of course, there's the eponymous Great Salt Lake, the habitat for millions of birds and scene of trails and tourism.\n\nSalt Lake City has its problems, of course. Growth is stagnating, the city is expected to begin declining in population, and the Church's influence can be as much a hindrance as it can be a help. Yet, despite all this, perhaps Brigham Young's words when he first saw the new home for his Church still apply.\n\n"This is the right place," he said. "Drive on.""

A reason for its growth to the third busiest port in China by the mid-1930s, as well as a major distribution hub for the southeast, was its relative peace; yet, as it stood at the brunt of Japanese artillery fire in 1939, it became anything but.\n\nThe Santō of today retains its function as a major transportation nexus, only this time under watchful eyes and suffocating grips, its spoils reserved for the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the Sphere alone."

 state_lore_desc.219: "Addis Abeba, administrative capital of Ethiopia and, through it, of the entire Italian East Africa, has a relatively short history for the millenary tradition of the Horn of Africa. Founded at the end of the XIX century by Menelik, Emperor of Ethiopia, as the first proper imperial capital, the city grew rapidly with the influx of trade and immigrants from the poorer regions of the burgeoning Empire: the construction of the first railway in an independent African nation further accelerated its development, which only continued under Italian occupation, if for an entirely different purpose.\n\nAs the largest city in the newly-expanded Italian colonial domain, Addis Abeba, soon christened as the "Flower of the Empire" from its colonial coat of arms, was immediately chosen as the seat of the Viceroy, and a large portion of the city was soon demolished to make space for the designs of its new owners. Wide avenues, majestic triumphal arches and modern Italian-style quarters impress an indelible mark upon the city, while the nobility and middle class of the defeated enemy were pushed into ever-expanding slums: there, Italian Blackshirts and native African Policemen make sure that any challenge to the Italian order is quelled with prejudice.\n\nWith half a million inhabitants, a large industrial sector, and a labyrinthine bureaucracy, Addis Abeba is the largest city in the Horn of Africa. As such, different rules apply than the rest of the colony: with the impossibility to control the entirety of such a sprawling urban center, the racial order is enforced with way less zeal, and it is not uncommon to see poor Italian colonists live and work side by side with locals, a coexistence unseen in other parts of Italian Africa and which has led to the formation of what many call a unique underground culture."

 state_lore_desc.220: "The largest city, and administrative capital of Somalia, Mogadiscio has a long and proud history, being known from the Middle Ages as an important trade node, and "the city of the hundred Mosques." Sold by the local rulers to Italian traders, it soon became the epicenter of the Italian colonial expansion in Somalia: slowly but steadily, the city expanded as more and more colonists found a new life outside of the mainland, until they outnumbered the natives, and started pushing them towards the outskirts in large slums, rebuilding the city center in the image of a typical Italian town.\n\nWhile less developed than Addis Abeba or Asmara, Mogadiscio is still an important urban center, with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants and several industries - especially in the textile and fruit sectors - marking its progress from a mere trade and agricultural town into a modern industrial city. As Italy's main port into the Indian Ocean, Mogadiscio also boasts a large and modern port: every day, dozens of cargo ships dock here to load Somalia's fruits and textiles, exporting them towards Italy or other countries."

 state_lore_desc.221: "An ancient city dating back to the Middle Ages when it was known as "Arbaete Asmara", or "the Union of the Four" to celebrate its foundation by four local clans, Asmara was among the first Italian colonies. Growing exponentially ever since the end of the XIX century from the influx of Italian colonists, the city has been almost entirely rebuilt by Italian architects: everything, from the gubernatorial palace to the large roads, reflect the influence of Italian - and later, fascist - style, so much that it is commonly nicknamed "the African Rome."\n\nAfter the conquest of Ethiopia, Asmara grew even more as trade routes to and from Addis Abeba passed through the port of Massaua. Boasting a population of almost two hundred thousands, almost two thirds of which Italian, the regional capital of Eritrea is also the second most industrialized city in Italian East Africa after Addis Abeba itself, with several subsidiaries of Italian industries such as FIAT and Ansaldo, as well as an important recruitment center: the Ascari are, in fact, the main pillar upon which the colonial garrison relies upon, and their veterans often receive land and pensions which elevate them far above their brethren.\n\nUnder the shiny façade of a bustling city, however, lies the ugly truth of colonial occupation. Far from the beautiful parks and modern service buildings of the city center, Asmara's outskirts are occupied by slums where tens of thousands of natives live in extremely poor conditions, while unofficial, but deeply entrenched, bureaucratic practices make sure that few, if any native can have a chance to increase their status if not by enlisting in the Ascari: this situation is not only known, but to some extent encouraged by the government in Rome, as the Italianization of the province proceeds."

The French, a caged beast barely restrained enough to be held in Western Europe and the German civilisation. A patchwork of duchies, electorates and Emperors all jostling for their own private slice of influence inside the asthmatic colossus of the Holy Roman Emperor. On the frontlines of this war, sits Köln. France, under the brutality of the Wehrmacht, has been subjugated so brutally and efficiently that the War has been won.\n\nThe frontlines have evaporated and the struggle ceases. But what is left in the ashes? Köln, even before the Reich's total victory in Europe, provided the crucial step that Hitler needed to take control of Germany. It was in the city of Köln that Hitler met with von Papen to foster a secret alliance to bring down von Schleicher's government.\n\nTo that, Hitler owes his thanks to the city."

Situated on the banks of the Neckar, its prime location in Southern Germany and its historic status as the capital of the Kingdom of Württemberg made it a nexus for transport and manufacturing - a reputation cemented as the city became the birthplace of the Volkswagen Beetle and its military derivative, the Kübelwagen, as well as several of Germany's late-war super-heavy tank designs. While some of its industrial capacity has since decamped to Wolfsburg and other cities, Stuttgart remains home to instantly recognizable German industrial brands such as Porsche and Daimler-Benz - and to the thousands of laborers, free or otherwise, required to run their colossal factories."

That time is gone, never to return. What Suleiman, what Frederick and what Napoleon could not do, one of their own countrymen has done. They have stripped Austria of its sovereignty and its pride and absorbed it in its entirety.\n\nThe Anschluss of 1938 made sure that Austria would become one with its brother nation, but it was the totality of German victory in Europe that ensured that no state could ever rise from the fractured Gaus and Wehrkreis that litter the former nation.

Its Senate overrun by the NSDAP in 1933, the city would begin to infringe upon the rights of its Polish and Jewish inhabitants, and would ultimately be annexed by Germany in the first days of the Second World War.\n\nWith its return affirmed by the passage of decades, the city now stands as a staunchly German city, built around shipbuilding and trade.

Millions have been worked to death by the conglomerates all around Breslau, and yet the residents cannot and will not bat an eye.\n\nBreslau, a city known for its long, storied history and multicultural heritage, has been utterly subsumed by the monolith of National Socialism.

Even its name comes from a German general, Karl Litzmann, who occupied the region a half-century prior.\n\nBut the facade is thin. Signs of the hundreds of thousands of Poles who lay dead or deported remain etched in the walls, too numerous to ever plaster over completely. Their prayers and accusations remain, preserved and unanswered.\n\nA small number of Poles remain in Litzmannstadt, a class of servants to be abused.

Just as it served then, and just as it served during the days of the Great Elector, under the Reich, Königsberg serves as the fulcrum that separates Eastern Europe from the Reich's Imperial heartland.\n\nAdorned with statues and monuments to Hitler's savage subjugation of Eastern Europe, there seldom lies a street that does not hold Hitler's visage.

Nowhere is this more prominent than in Tunja, the capital of the Colombian Revolutionary Union and the bastion of Gaitán's ideals in Colombia.\n\nThe URC is dedicated to keeping Gaitán's dream alive, declaring avowed support for Gaitán's left-wing activism, fairness and charitability, and his open friendliness towards the United States of America. Naturally, this last tenet has drawn the attention of the OFN, and the URC has received significant support from the aforementioned faction in the form of weapons shipments, olive-green Green Berets, and suit-clad agents in Tunja's government buildings.\n\nShould La Violencia ever resume, the URC has a leg up in terms of a close, friendly superpower, but should the people's reverence for Gaitán and his dream disappear, Tunja's future will be a dark one indeed."

The feeling of hope and optimism that once filled the streets has been replaced with a quiet sense of dread and unease, feelings that permeate through the air of Tunja, darkening the clouds of the future.\n\nDespite the URC and Gaitán's legacy seemingly being some of the many sad casualties of La Violencia, they still live, broken and battered as they may be. They live on, deep in the recesses of Tunja and its citizens, quietly awaiting the day where the people can charge forward again for a Colombia that stands free and proud, although that day may not come for a long, long time."

What was once a bright, republican city has become a hive of reactionarism from which the tendrils of Colombian fascism emanate.\n\nCali, under its near-permanent curfew, has become home to flagrant thugs and reactionary brutes. Blackshirts terrorize dissenting families on one street, oligarchs drown themselves in a sea of opulence on another, all while Colombia's most extreme Catholics damn their Jewish enemies to Hell in Cali's Archdiocese just one street over, all causing bloodshed to get the jobs done.\n\nBy becoming the den of hated bands of outlaws, fascists, and mercenaries, and its Afro-Colombian population chased out by terror and persecution, Cali's legacy has been forever tainted, and it is unclear whether the city will recover from eleven years of harsh fascist rule."

Eleven years of fascist rule will not go away overnight, and Cali's exhausted people already anticipate the heightened military presence in the city in the name of anti-fascism while damaged buildings and infrastructure go ignored, and Blackshirts and oligarch militias begin to mobilize for insurgency.\n\nAlthough Cali may be free from its sordid past, it remains unknown whether they will ever truly be free from the legacy of Avedaño and his jack-booted thugs."

After the massive success of German National Socialism during and after the Second World War, the German Reich has spent a lot of time influencing Germans outside of their borders to accept their ways of thought; in Colombia's tapping into longstanding racism among the criollo aristocracy and convincing them of their true Aryan nature. This has led to rising tensions underneath the surface, as the German Bund and their Colombian allies express increasing disloyalty to the Republic of Colombia.\n\nLurking in the shadows of Barranquilla and the Atlántico department, the Second Patriotic Army watches and waits in silence, like a snake, waiting for the perfect opportunity to reveal themselves to the world and bring Colombia under the influence of National Socialism."

However, a new faction has appeared out of the chaos, one that was anticipated by Colombia's current factions: the Second Patriotic Army.\n\nRising from the city of Barranquilla, long the home of German influence in Colombia, the Second Patriotic Army seeks to fulfill the xenophobic dreams of the criollo aristocracy. The SPA fights in the name of National Socialism and Ario-Criollonism, using Barranquilla's Kolumbiendeutscher Volksbund as a springboard to bring all of Colombia under National Socialism.\n\nAlready, German arms and mercenaries have flooded into the city, cementing its status as a German bastion in the New World. It remains to be seen whether Barranquilla and the SPA turn all of Colombia into a National Socialist stronghold or collapse under the pressure of the Colombian Civil War."

After a hard-fought struggle in the suburbs and the streets, Colombia's Nazi stronghold has been reduced to a smoking ruin, the Kolumbiendeutscher Volksbund's grasp on the city excised once and for all. The Bund is dead, and the German population in Barranquilla has been severely reduced by La Violencia.\n\nIt is unknown what the new Colombian regime has in store for Barranquilla and the Second Patriotic Army remnants that still resist there in the name of an Aryan utopia. Maybe the city will be restored to its Pre-War richness and influence. Maybe Barranquilla will stay a second-rate city, the scars of the civil war never truly going away.\n\nIf there is one thing that is certain for Barranquilla, it's that Germany's hold over the city is dead, but the legacy of the Kolumbiendeutscher Volksbund will be exploited by Colombian national socialists for decades to come."

Even then, it was a forgotten outpost at the edge of the world, left to its own devices by its supposed overlords, its Danish locals suppressing the Inuit culture and leaving them in abject poverty. So it went for centuries until global gales turned the isolated glacier into a North Atlantic bastion between Europe and America. Without warning, Uncle Sam swept in to occupy Greenland, bringing thousands of soldiers which fanned into bases and outposts to propagate the next era of occupation - and, with their own concerns at the forefront of their minds, Nuuk remained as ignored as it had ever been.\n\nNuuk today is underfunded, overlooked, and beaten down. While the bases which dot the hills around it play host to looked-after American soldiers, its own concerns are resolutely set aside by its new, infinitely more powerful overlord, who considers the city as nothing more than a minor pawn in a greater geopolitical game. For now, the people of Nuuk and Greenland as a whole accept the miserable status quo, but this surely cannot hold forever."

Add onto that with the migration of tens of thousands of Brazilian immigrants moving in, and you have a recipe for one of South America's most resentful regions - and there are certainly more than enough of those on the continent.\n\nAs the war came to a conclusion and the authority of both France's fell into flux, Brazil saw its opportunity to step in. Backed by an American nation which saw it as a convenient solution to a potential problem, the Brazilian Army marched across the border and seized the colony. Since then, French Guiana - and Cayenne - have lasted in an odd limbo, slowly but surely spiraling further and further into Brazil's sphere while more and more immigrants bring the region closer to their home and more Brasília money funnels into the area's development. Cayenne has certainly benefited from the influx of people and jobs, but when paired with the slow fading of the region's autonomy and culture, the trade-off seems a lot more sour than it first appeared.\n\nIt's not clear what the future holds for French Guiana and Cayenne. The city itself has come far from once being a penal colony. Its narrow streets and sidewalks are vibrant with culture and life, and its people enjoy a steadily improving quality of life.

Yet the status quo is poison for the ruling exiles, too - for they know who they are, where their homeland is, where they are in relation to that, and just how hopeless the whole situation seems to be. The strain has not been kind on their aging figures.\n\nParamaribo, for its part, has become the unwitting and unwilling host to this drama. There's certainly an irony to its settlement, being a colonial project planted right on top of an old native village. Since its 17th century origins, it has grown into a diverse hub of different communities - Maroons, Indians, Creole, Javanese, natives, and the Dutch themselves. In modern times, the city sees a healthy democratic environment emerging, with competitive races for Parliament and a foreign-backed economy which keeps things running smoothly in the Paris of Suriname.\n\nBeing economically tied to the whims of the Americans may not be the most preferable option, and being a shadow version of the Netherlands isn't what anyone here envisioned, but when confronted with the other choices, the present seems downright pleasant.

Soon, it also became a colonial lynchpin in the struggle between imperial powers, eventually trading hands from Spain to Britain. With that came a new wave of colonists - Indians from the then-Raj, settling and mixing in with the European, African, and indigenous population that had already settled there.\n\nModern times dawn upon a Trinidad that holds itself as one of the most diverse places in the world, with the capital city of one of the most diverse countries in the world. The West Indies Federation is charitably described as eclectic, realistically described as dysfunctional, and rumored by many to be on the verge of collapse. A perhaps ill-advised union between the old colonial islands of the Caribbean has created a gridlocked, argumentative, and disunited country that seems to exist only so far as people acknowledge it. Port of Spain has its own local problems too, of course - Williams' dominance may be fairly won, but his seeming reluctance to address racial issues has left many dissatisfied, and the weakness of the Union invites foreign interference from all players of the Cold War.

The American occupation was brief, but its legacy has tied the nation into the OFN and into America's economic hold on the nation. The British are gone, but their money and their businessmen remain. Despite the ocean between themselves and Europe, the concerns of the Cold War can't help but drag themselves through Guyanan concerns, a specter looming over their ambitions. Finally, over the border looms the Venezuelans, arrogant enough to claim nearly half the country for themselves and powerful enough to see it through should America ever cut loose from the country.\n\nAnd yet... Georgetown itself sees peace, or at least an uneasy form of it. The wide boulevards and canals host witness to economic growth, and the streets are lush with vibrant plantlife while citizens go on with their lives. The legislature may be sharply divided, the country may be balanced on knife's edge, but the city itself seems frozen in a bubble of tranquility. Time will tell if it ever pops."

Nestled at the gateway to the eastern plains, it is a solitary outpost in the vast expanse of the Orinoco basin. While its precise founding remains shrouded in mystery, historical records indicate that Villavicencio was officially established as a municipality by the provincial assembly of Bogotá in 1840, solidifying its status as a republican city, since in colonial times it was marked just as a hub for Jesuit missions, connecting surrounding estates and facilitating the transportation of agricultural goods to larger towns.\n\nSituated to the east of the majestic Andean range and propelled by a thriving petrochemical industry, Villavicencio found itself shielded from the grotesque scenes that unfolded during La Violencia. The devastating conflict that raged to the west and north, sparing the city from the brunt of the war. Nonetheless, it became a rallying point for revolutionary leaders like Guadalupe Salcedo and Isauro Yosa, who marshaled their loyalists from the city and its environs."

Three words, three hearts.\n\nThis is what has come to define the port city of Dundee, Scotland, and what continues to keep it alive, even as Britain cries under the Jackboot. Whilst in another time the jute mills would have been silenced by foreign competition, they continue to creak and whimper indefinitely, feeding its cheap rope and textiles to the military power that starved its people twenty years ago. Whilst the city's publishing houses once brought truth to the people of a once great country, they now only bring the spiels manufactured in Germania for the benefit of none but Downing Street or the Pakt. It is a city that bitterly tastes defeat.\n\nHowever, it is said that hope still exists here. The people of Dundee have never been known to give up without a fight. If you were to find yourself in some particular back alley, you may even stumble upon a domestic printing of the Washington Post; if you were to find yourself in a more peculiar place, you may find what replaced the jam in Dundee - the blood of garrison troops. Dundee may have three black hearts now, but its soul still fights, and when the time comes, it may be able to bring joy to its people once more."

After the March 1st Movement in 1919 failed, the resistance shifted their focus abroad. Jiandao, meaning "Middle Island", became a key site for the Korean independence movement in Northeastern China because of its sizable Korean population. The massacre in 1920 did not deprive the Korean people of their spirit. Since 1930, backed by the Chinese Communists, local Koreans staged several armed revolts and faced brutal repression from the Fengtian Army and the Japanese. The survivors, however, moved northward into the heartland of Dongbei and continued their struggle.\n\nThe establishment of Manchukuo resulted in waves of Korean immigrants, and the Japanese moved in to quell the resistance. For decades, the Gando Special Force, a Korean-majority unit of the Manchurian Imperial Army, had been crushing their own people with ruthless force, but their bloodshed still lingers in the city's memory."

But opium occupied a large fraction of its fertile soil, and its grain output was always insufficient.\n\nUnder the coercion or deception of Manchukuo, more farmers abandoned food cultivation and switched to opium. The arable land was seized for opium production, while the food crops were relegated to the barren slopes. This caused the collapse of the agricultural economy, the displacement of the farmers, and widespread famine.\n\nUlaankhad is now a realm of opium fields, a haven for opium addicts.

The Anshan Iron Works was established in 1919, and subsequently reorganized into the Shōwa Steel Works. For "industrial use", Mantetsu annexed extensive territories of land, expanding the neighborhoods and ultimately forming the city of Anshan as it stands today.\n\nFollowing the inception of Mangyō, the Shōwa Steel Works fell under its dominion, a grip that endures to the present day.

On April 26, 1942, a gas and coal dust explosion erupted. The Japanese authorities sealed off the mine shafts and cut off the air supply, condemning over 1,500 miners to a slow and agonizing death: They only cared about rescuing one life - a privileged Japanese supervisor.\n\nBut the story went untold.

Much like Qiqihar, which once dominated the north but snatched by the Russians who built Harbin, Jilin once controlled the south, but Xinjing, built by the Japanese, topped it. The foreign powers have shaped and shattered the destiny of Manchuria, and the people within shall resign to its fate.\n\nAmidst these shifts, Jilin remains a testament of a city born from the confluence of rivers and shaped by the tides of history.

The Germans wanted their new Eastern rail hub to be at least superficially homelike if they could not yet live out an agrarian existence in the Heimat's countryside. So, the Jews of Brest-Litowsk were shipped off to Sobibor. Or they were walked onto the killing fields at Bronna Gora by SS men and Ukrainian Hiwis.

The Reichskommissariat needs tractors, trucks, rollers, subsoilers, swathers, and combine harvesters to trim and renew the wan yellow flatness. Charkow machines are in almost every farm in the Reichskommissariat, but most of the harvest is sent west to Germany. In Rostow, rake-thin Ukrainians work and eat day-to-day. Time blurs. Bones ache.

Far from the prosperous sprawling suburbs of the outer edges of American cities, the city is dotted with thousands of illegal homes built in shanty towns and slums which stretch through much of the city.

One of the first cities to be taken in the War of Independence, it became the capital of Texas and Coahuila until the loss of Texas to the United States. It lost more of its splendor following the American occupation, but saw a rebound during the 1880s as it underwent rapid industrialization.\n\nOne of the first cities to join the Carrancistas during the Revolution, it eventually saw occupation by the military junta that forced many to flee for the United States, once more sending the city into a decline.

 state_lore_name.353: "Ciudad Obregón"
 state_lore_desc.353: "Ciudad Obregón, a relatively new city located in the southern reaches of Sonora, was officially established in 1906. It was established as part of the Sonoran railway moving south that connected the United States with the rest of Mexico. As the city grew with the years passing by it was one of the first captured by the Revolution, by the army of Obregón and Carranza no less.\n\nIts economy boomed with the automobile industry in the 1920's, and it was renamed to honor General Álvaro Obregón. From what started as being a glorified train stop, it now possesses the title of the second largest city in the state of Sonora. Despite the desert terrain Ciudad Obregón finds itself in, it has continued to grow massively, with its proximity to a valley making it a hub of countless agricultural experiments. With the many experiments occurring, it has been said a 'Green Revolution' is happening in the area."

 state_lore_name.354: "Celaya"
 state_lore_desc.354: "Up among the mountains of the state of Guanajuato sits the city of Celaya. The head of the Celaya municipality, Celaya was established in 1570 by Spanish settlers. It has long played an important role in Mexican history given its strategic location in the Bajio. Sieged during the independence war, it later was attacked by the French during their invasion of Mexico, and still further by Porfirio Díaz during his coup in 1876. It even saw one of the bloodiest battles of the Revolution, as in 1915 the armies of Pancho Villa and Álvaro Obregón clashed in a horrific bloodletting.\n\nIn the aftermath, Celaya was left a wasteland with little hope to recover. And yet, as it always has, it grew from the conflicts of its past to embrace the promises of the future. By the 1960s, the city has bounced back as its recovery has turned into an economic boom. Coupled with its strong infrastructure and commerce given its placement in the Bajio, it is becoming colloquially known as the "Golden Gate of the Bajio", only further enhancing its growing prosperity."

 state_lore_name.355: "Aguascalientes"
 state_lore_desc.355: "In the sweeping valleys of Aguascalientes lies the city of Aguascalientes, capital of the state of the very same name. The name translates to "Hot Waters", deriving from the location of the city itself: within the valleys lie an abundance of hot springs dotting the mountains of the Bajio. Founded in 1575 by a group of Spanish adventurers, its original purpose was to protect the roads connecting the massive mines of central Mexico. Over the ensuing centuries, the city grew from its original purpose as its population swelled. Under the Porfiriato, it saw an industrial boom. Yet its place in history was cemented in 1914 by the Convention of Aguascalientes, which sought to unite the revolutionaries of Mexico under one banner.\n\nToday, Aguascalientes continues much as it had before, with the economy rolling smoothly along as it benefits from its enviable position within the prosperous Bajio and its centrality. Only time will tell if Aguascalientes' history will continue to be a ceaseless march of progress, or if its history shall take a sharp turn."

 state_lore_name.356: "Tepic"
 state_lore_desc.356: "The city of Tepic lies on the western edge of Mexico, overlooking the Pacific Ocean to the west. Surrounded by hills and lush jungles, it was formed in 1531 by a group of Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés. Over the ensuing decades, its name shifted as the identity of Mexico grew, and the city became the capital of the province of New Galicia. With its medium altitude and its location near the coast, it became intertwined with the trade networks connecting the Philippines, Guadalajara, and Mexico City. Over the following centuries the city continued to swell in population, yet it saw a decline in the 19th century as other cities rose in prominence.\n\nAlthough a shadow of what it once was, Tepic remains the capital of the state of Nayarit. Its industrialization efforts in the first half of the 20th century saw its population explode. With its position still of great importance to the Mexican economy and its trade networks, the future of Tepic looks bright as it is poised to become a central link in Mexico's growing trade in the Pacific."

 state_lore_desc.357: "İzmir, naval and trade capital of the region, has a long and storied history dating back to its first settlement approximately nine thousand years ago. The pearl of the Aegean Sea, it was also the place where the Greeks were thrown to the sea at the end of Atatürk's Grand Campaign.\n\nThe gulf that surrounds İzmir is host to many ports, a heritage from antiquity when the then-Smyrna was the gate of Asia Minor whereby Romans, Greeks, and countless other peoples entered to trade, invade, and settle. Today, on the other hand, İzmir looks to the future: having embraced the reforms promulgated by Atatürk in their fullness, it is a shining beacon of Turkish laicism and Kemalist reformism."

 state_lore_desc.358: "The city that once played host to the Seleucids, to Mevlânâ Celâleddîn-i Rûmî, and to Nasreddin Hoca is today the breadbasket of the Turkish nation as the wide plains of what was once known as Iconium soak up the benefits of Atatürk's extensive rural revitalisation programs.\n\nYet Konya has not modernised as completely as Atatürk and his heirs might have wanted. Due to the influence of the Mevlânâ, his heirs, and countless other clergy that called Konya their home over the centuries, Islam has deep roots in Konya. As a result, the values of the Turkish revolution have a hard time penetrating the many conservative towns and villages that surround Konya."

 state_lore_desc.359: "Once upon a time, Bursa was one of the first capitals of what became the Sublime Ottoman State. In those days, Bursa was known as Green Bursa, for the verdance of its landscape and the many parks and green spaces that popped up throughout the city.\n\nBut today if Karagöz and Hacivat peered around their hometown they would recognise less and less of it. The fume and ash of industrial growth is slowly killing the old natural beauty of the city, renaming it the Detroit of Turkey; at the same time, however, that same acrid smoke comes from factories that produce the stuff that makes Turkey and its citizens prosperous. As Turkey industrializes, it is likely that Bursa will become greyer as its people become wealthier."

Since antiquity, Hitties, Greeks, Romans, Armenians, and more have all passed through the region, but the question of whether Adana is ever to reach its full potential lies in the hands of the Turks that live in it today."

Its situation at a given time is also one of the most prominent indicators of the way the modern Turkish state interacts with ethnic minorities within its borders.\n\nBeing a Kurdish-majority urban center, and as a result the headquarters of the Fourth Inspectorate-General, it felt the first direct effects of Turkification as that Inspectorate-General did its work. New rail lines, roads, economic investment, and construction of schools, hospitals, and other services at a scale unheard of in Diyarbakır's history were joined by laws attempting to erase the local culture in favour of national unity—and a heavy military presence to enforce those laws."
