  BOL_Armando_Alba_Zambrana: "Armando Alba Zambrana"
  POLITICS_ARMANDO_ALBA_ZAMBRANA: "The constant humiliations suffered by Bolivia since its independence have not deterred the old traditional oligarchic rulers of the country from hanging on to power at the cost of their own dignity. Thrice (1938, 1946, and 1952)  have they lost, and thrice have they regained it by a mixture of manipulation and force. So discredited has their Liberalism become in their process, that it is forced to call itself socialism. This spectacle, whose comical characteristics are overshadowed by the tragedy it has engulfed the country in: The abdication of sovereignty, economic vassalage, aggravation of racial resentments, exacerbation of privileges, and finally, the disintegration of order.\n\nSuch a horror show requires actors to continue running, with the man now occupying the limelight presidente de turno Armando Alba Zambrana. By all accounts a decent man and a good historian, who reportedly has some higher sensibility to the question of Bolivia's periodically excluded indegenous population, his virtues nevertheless come to be too little too late. His government, put in place at the accord of Argentina, Brazil, the United States and Chile after Colonel Villaroel's second overthrow, through qualified elections, is completely deprived of popular support. Its inability to deal with the ever more infuriating Paraguayan presence in the Orient, and the meager support it has received in exchange for its slavish adherence to the OFN, has won it the antipathy of officers, even of those it reinstated, alongside the already angry predisposition of those adhering to either military socialism or the deposed MNR."

BOL_patchwork_country: "Patchwork Country"
BOL_patchwork_country_desc: "Since its inception, Bolivia has been an artificial country consisting of groups and ethnicities at constant odds with one another, unable to come together even when faced with an external enemy. Thus the process of forming a cohesive national identity has been ineffective and lackluster, meaning that the decline of this nation since Independence was inescapable.\n\nThe groups that were once at least nominally unified against the Spaniards and the foreigners are now resolute and fanatical in their hatred for one another and those who govern them, and the notion of national unity today barely hangs by a thread. The levers of power are held not by the people nor by the politicians; quite the contrary, they are held by oligarchical mining tycoons and sectarian military officers plotting behind closed doors."
BOL_century_of_humiliation: "Century of Humiliation"
BOL_century_of_humiliation_desc: "We have suffered humiliation after humiliation since our Independence. All of our neighbours have constantly backstabbed us and made us lesser in their eyes and those of the world for their own gain.\n\nMost recently, of course, besides the humiliation of the Paraguayan occupation of the East, we were turned into a pawn in the game between the Argentines, the Brazilians, and the Chileans after they agreed to install a government friendly to their interests."
BOL_boiling_point: "Boiling Point"
BOL_boiling_point_desc: "We know what is coming; we see it as clearly as we see the mountains and rivers of our land. Seeing it is even easier when it's happened so many times already.\n\nThe government is very obviously in crisis. The military garrisons and command structures are so plagued by conflict and plotting that they make cuartelazos look peaceful. Heated news articles and debates fill up the routine of every day and grow worse as days move forward. Paralyzing strikes make worker militias in Brazil and Argentina seem peaceful.\n\nBolivia is once more on the edge of a political boiling point. Unless there is a constructive intervention, this nation will once more fall into another bout of chaos, revolutions, revolving-door governments, and, most likely, another series of coups."
