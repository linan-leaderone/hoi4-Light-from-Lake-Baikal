STC_Carmelo_Ortiz_Taborga: "Carmelo Ortíz Taborga"
POLITICS_CARMELO_ORTIZ_TABORGA: "The reignition of the Chaco War by President Busch, a calamitous event for most of Bolivia, was almost providential for a peculiar group of Orientals, centered around the figure of Carmelo Ortíz Taborga.\n\nThese men and women, collectively known as the "Separatists," spent much of the Chaco War in Asunción, fighting an intellectual war of words with their "Integrationist" pairs. Both groups are highly racialist and dismissive of the ability of the western highland population - even of its white minority - to rule for itself. Their primary disagreement lies on whether this means the eastern sectors of the country, namely Santa Cruz, and its own white population, ought to "take charge" of the country, or leave it altogether. With the Paraguayan triumphal entry into the department's namesake city, the separatist faction received a major material and propagandistic boost, as well as control of the occupied zone's civil administration.\n\nTheir leader, a former merchant and telegraph operator, was the first to jump the ship to Paraguay for help in the cause of independence, and his legitimacy with the Santa Cruz elite has only increased with each failed Bolivian attempt to retake the city. Nevertheless, the population of the region, across both sides of the latest armistice line, remain highly divided on the matter. Moreover, the government that rules the civil administration in occupied Santa Cruz is itself composed of a big-tent coalition of Ortíz Taborga's early supporters, members of the briefly extant Oriental Socialist Party, and a new generation of chiefs orbiting around the "apolitical" pro-Santa Cruz Committee. While these contain the aggregate sum of political opinion in the region, many in the latter two groups are not fully convinced of independence, which ultimately has as its guarantor only the military fortunes of Paraguay."

STC_oriental_racist_party: "The Oriental Racist Party"
STC_oriental_racist_party_desc: "Both of the dominant strains of political thought in Santa Cruz (Unionism and Separatism) rest on the assumption of the Racial superiority of Santa Cruz relative to the inferior, 'colla', west.\n\nWhether this takes the form of exalting both a hispanic-white purity, or a guarani-mestizo warrior ancestry - which it has sometimes been done simultaneously - the perception is that there exists an "Oriental Racist Party," as the Western newspapers refer to it, determined to turn Santa Cruz into the bane of all of Bolivia."
STC_pozo_cano_ghost: "Pozo Cano's Ghost"
STC_pozo_cano_ghost_desc: "Since 1938, the top priority and aim of Paraguayan foreign policy has been to achieve Oriental independence, as a prelude to Santa Cruz's eventual annexation.\n\nRaúl del Pozo Cano and Benjamín Velilla proved a crucial pair in this endeavor, and their former office at the Paraguayan consulate in Santa Cruz continues to be the source of much separatist propaganda, which, when combined with Paraguayan military prowess, has had a substantial effect in swaying the minds of the indecisive amongst the Oriental population."
STC_masonic_shadow_war: "The Two-Lodge System"
STC_masonic_shadow_war_desc: "Conspiracy theories around the Freemasons and their lodges have been a recurring trend in the Western world ever since they first came to prominence. Oftentimes, such conspiracies are wrapped in a dressing of anti-semitism - most prominently, of course, in the German Reich, where Hitler's decrying of the Masons as a Jewish puppet organization directly led to the state-organized mass murder of its members. Rumors of "Masonic plots" have become a boogeyman of leaders from all sides of the political spectrum who need a convenient scapegoat for their nation's woes, regardless of veracity or consequences.\n\nIt is some sort of cruel irony that the only part of the world where this conspiratorial thinking holds any truth is one where its two lodges have long ago splintered away from Masonry altogether.\n\nThe "Caballeros del Oriente" and the "Toborochi", once one and the same until the Toborochi split from the Caballeros, are engaged in a brutal shadow war which engulfs Cruzeño politics. The leadership are all members. The wealthy are all members. The generals are all members. The powerful are all members. If you want to go anywhere in Santa Cruz's society, you will swear yourself to a lodge, or you will find yourself rooted right to where you started."
STC_rapid_growth: "The Oriental Miracle"
STC_rapid_growth_desc: "As recently as two decades—or even one decade—ago, Santa Cruz was a backwater, the Bolivian definition of the middle of nowhere. But just as it did for the Arabs, the black gold called oil destroyed that old hellhole forevermore. Today, Cruzeños of a more learned bent half-jokingly refer to their hometown as the 'Pearl of the Orient'.\n\nThe discovery of massive oil deposits resulted in rapid industrial expansion and universal economic growth. That led to a population boom, which fed the breakneck urbanization of the former backwater and construction of seemingly unparalleled infrastructure projects to ensure Santa Cruz kept moving.\n\n§GLet there be no mistake: Santa Cruz is seeing its best days.§!"
