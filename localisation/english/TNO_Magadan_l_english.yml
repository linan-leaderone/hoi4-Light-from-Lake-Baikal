  ## Bios ##
  # Leaders
  POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_DESC: "In so many ways, Mikhail Alexeevich Matkovsky displays a form of Russian fascism that contrasts itself against Rodzaevsky's formulation. Where Rodzaevsky is dogmatic, he is pragmatic. Where Rodzaevsky is a skilled, fiery orator, he is the negotiator, using his tact and political acumen to sway political enemies to his side. Where Rodzaevsky praised the anti-Semitic initiatives from the Blackshirts, Matkovsky despised their thuggery. For a brief moment, their goals aligned. The results of their cooperation saw the membership RFP rise and peak, as more and more Russian émigrés saw the appeal of fascism.\n\nThen the Great Patriotic War erupted. With the Germans waging a conflict of extermination upon Russia, the differences between these two simmered. Despite Hitler's destructive, genocidal intent, Rodzaevsky sought his support, dreaming of a Russia free from Bolshevism at last. Matkovsky had no such illusions. Germany's war against the Soviet Union, and therefore against Russia, lay bare their racial hatred for Russians. No matter what appeal the RFP could garner, the Nazis did not factor any independent Russia into their plans. However, true to Matkovsky's tact, he and his clique remained silent and bided their time, growing their power in the intervening years.\n\nWhen the time came, they seized the city of Magadan from Rodzaevsky, driving the loyalists out and officially splitting the party. Now in charge of his own domain, Matkovsky seeks to save Russia from her ruin. The means to this end lay across the ocean, past the Japanese: America. However, even for an experienced negotiator such as Matkovsky, convincing any foreign power is a difficult task; yet, he will not let mere doubt stop him."
  POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_70S_DESC: "The hum of the gramophone, the clatter of silverware against plates, the gleam of rooms bedecked in gold and silver - all the riches of the world, within Mikhail Alexeevich Matkovsky's grasp. Yet, he felt it all ebb away, the pangs of pain below his ribs like seizures that recalled Harbin. Before the face of death, every man lives in poverty; the Vozhd of Russia was not an exception. The scent of wine and lure morphine seemed to deaden his episodes. However, when morning comes, the Vozhd stands before his doom: a slow, painful death, dealt with by dice belonging to jesters of fate and chance.\n\nThe chemotherapy, medicines, pills, tablets, all he tried, to no avail. His American friends, who had rescued him from the jaws of defeat time and again, could only upraise their shoulders in a shrug. Matkovsky was old. Only now, at the apex of his power, he entered the nadir of his existence. No amount of political connections, schemes, and purges could cure him. Woe was he! If only he could tear out his liver and be done with it - but no. Matkovsky's lot was to live, and live he shall.\n\nWhen one's death is beyond doubt, all that remains is not what glitters, hums, or clatters, but the quiet preponderance of one's legacy. So Matkovsky looks to the west, across the barbed wires that demarked Russian and German territory. Here will be where he shall sear his name unto the annals of history. Through war or peace, the Vozhd no longer cared. The method is secondary; the ends justify the means - for, after all, the end is near and nigh."
  POLITICS_NIKOLAY_PETLIN_DESC: "Unlike the other senior figures in the Russian Fascist Party, Nikolay Nikolayevich Petlin was a native of Harbin, not an émigré. At first, this difference only seemed to be at surface level. Working as a playwright, composer, and writer in Harbin, Petlin joined the Russian Fascist Party and was noted for his talents as a political organizer. Soon, he became the leader of the Fascist youth organization, before finally landing himself a spot in Konstantin Rodzaevsky's Russian Fascist Supreme Council, a timid man surrounded by the personalities of Matkovsky and Rodzaevsky.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded Russia, Petlin condemned Rodzaevsky's support of the Nazis' invasion, resigning in protest. From then on, he drifted to Matkovsky's wing of the RFP, serving as his personal secretary - an arrangement that survived until Matkovsky's act to separate his wing of the party from Rodzaevsky. Petlin found himself rising again, and the former Vozhd of the Russians appointed him as his deputy when the schism occurred. Under Petlin, the RFP pursued an agenda of courting the United States by promising reform, a promise that Matkovsky had subverted again and again.\n\nPetlin was there when the Russian Fascist Party became the Russian National Labor Party. He was there when they conquered Siberia, and paraded through the cities of Irkutsk and Yakutsk. He was there for Matkovsky's resignation and arrest over the crimes of the Dalstroy. This time, Petlin swears, he will be there when democracy returns to Russia, under the leadership of the émigrés. His destiny shall be the redemption of Harbin."
  POLITICS_MITCHELL_WERBELL_DESC: "The story of an American soldier of fortune seizing a Siberian city with nothing but his wits and superior firepower seems like a lurid tale too ridiculous for even the pulpiest dime-store novel. But sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.\n\nMitchell Livingston WerBell III was the son of a Russian émigré, born and raised in America. A brief stint in the OSS, the precursor to the CIA, was his springboard into the murky and deadly world of mercenary warfare. His unsavory missions spanned the globe from Cuba to Kamchatka, yet he still maintained his contacts with some of America's industrial elite and his father's old comrades. One in particular was Anastasy Vonsiatsky, the increasingly elderly Russo-American fascist. When Mikhail Matkovsky's regime in Magadan hoped to use Vonsiatsky as the gateway to American aid, WerBell saw an opportunity. What followed was as bold as it was suicidally insane, but he succeeded beyond all odds.\n\nThrough a mix of diplomacy, favors called in from old friends, and a few well-placed military raids, WerBell has successfully seized power in Magadan and declared the city to be the capital of the Republic of West Alaska. He hopes to achieve the reverse of what Matkovsky hoped with Vonsiatsky, serving as a conduit for a steady flow of American money and arms into his fledgling Siberian empire. However, WerBell's neighbors want nothing more than to drive him into the sea, and this may prove to be something far greater than he can handle..."
  POLITICS_MITCHELL_WERBELL_70S_DESC: "Against all odds, Mitchell Livingston WerBell III has succeeded. Thanks to luck, skill, and an abundance of American aid, the United States of Russia is now one of the largest nations on the planet. To state that the world is shocked would be an understatement. Analysts are still struggling to figure out how his government hasn't already collapsed from the sheer ridiculousness of its existence, all while the man himself sits upon a veritable mountain of money, laughing all the way.\n\nSomeone like WerBell, though, never truly rests. Constantly jumping between managing internal affairs, foreign connections, and personal matters, the mercenary is clearly not content with merely unifying Russia. His commitment to the army without borders is unwavering, but so is his support for bringing American-style democracy to Russia. It remains to be seen how these contradictions will be addressed, but some are beginning to hope WerBell, for all his flaws, might actually bring something good to the exhausted Russian people.\n\nDecried as an American asset by many, WerBell finds himself with both Japan and Germany wary of - if not outright hostile to - his regime. Though he certainly loves his home country, WerBell is not nearly as leashed as some fear or would like him to be. He is a man with an army and a vision, and the world awaits his next move with bated breath."
  MILITARY_ROGER_FAULQUES_DESC: "§LKnown worldwide within the mercenary community as the 'Man of a Thousand Lives', Roger Faulques is a man who has fought in near-countless wars - and accumulated almost as many near-life threatening injuries besides.\n\nA former member of French special forces formations, Faulques abandoned what he knew and saw as a power in rapid decline, deciding instead to leverage the skills he had developed in the pursuit of his own fortune and glory. Finding opportunities aplenty in Africa and elsewhere, he soon became known as a skilled and brutal fighter, willing to advance into enemy fire in order to seize victory.\n\nWhen WerBell declared the formation of his state, many were confident it was only a matter of time until Faulques arrived, chasing ever more fame and glory, and this has now come to pass. He is sure to bring tremendous skill and status to the nascent republic, even as many question whether he, in time, intends to replace his new commander in a similar fashion to that before.§!"

  # Ministers
  MAG_Vladimir_Kibardin_hog_desc: "§YHead of Government\nCorporatism§!\n--------------\n§LSecretary of the RFP centered in Magadan, Vladimir Vladimirovich Kibardin has been a loyal follower of the Vozhd since the beginning. From exile in Harbin, the crossing of the Amur River, then solitude in the Port of Magadan, Kibardin has stayed by Matkovsky's side through every trial and tribulation Russia and the communists had to offer. However, if Matkovsky is the pragmatist of the RFP, Kibardin would be the dogmatist, his struggles only furthering his devotion to the ideology of fascism. To Kibardin, orthodox fascism is the only hope for Russia; meaning no evolution or devolution in the case of Rodzaevsky could change that.\n\nHowever, Kibardin's worship of orthodox principles could mean he is more loyal to the ideology of fascism than the Vozhd himself. One day, Kibardin might have to choose: His Vozhd, or his ideology?§!"
  MAG_Nikolay_Petlin_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nPaternalism§!\n--------------\n§LNikolay Nikolayevich Petlin was born a Harbin native and has been a prominent member of the RFP for decades. Joining Matkovsky's wing after the split of the RFP, Petlin has found himself with a growing disillusionment with fascism, first with Rodzaevsky, and now in Magadan. Every day Petlin leaves his office, he sees his fellow Russians living in fear of the whims of the government and the one tyrant who has total control of their lives. Fascism isn't working, any form of it, and Petlin was only beginning to see the entire truth of the matter.\n\nHowever, with his job as the Chief Foreign Diplomat for the party, Petlin believes he has discovered a new path for Russia, the American path. For the most part up until now, contact with America has been sparse. However, Petlin plans to change that, and maybe one day the American model could come to Russia, reforming the fascist state into something freer, something every Russian could live in without having to fear for their lives or the lives of their families. Petlin's past sins continue to gnaw at him every night, and if making Russia into a better place is the only way for redemption, then he would have to try.§!"
  MAG_Igor_Kovalchuk_Koval_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nCivilian Dictatorship§!\n--------------\n§LWith Petlin having been arrested and the Laborists securing their power, a new replacement for the office of Chief Foreign Diplomat had been necessary. That job has been given to one Igor Konstantinovich Kovalchuk-Koval, a more minor diplomat up until now. Having been in the shadow of his predecessor for quite some time, Kovalchuk-Koval is ready to show his face to the world, that face depending on how Matkovsky wants him to appear, anyway.\n\nKnowing his position, Kovalchuk-Koval is much more willing to toe the line than Petlin, not like that is a problem for him. Still, diplomats from across the world will find a stark change in the Far East's diplomatic stance, the Americans especially. It is Kovalchuk-Koval's job to make sure the weapon shipments continue to arrive, and the Vozhd is watching his chief diplomat much closer this time. Kovalchuk-Koval now knows there is always a replacement waiting right behind him.§!"
  MAG_Vladimir_Goltsov_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Economy\nCorporatism§!\n--------------\n§LFleeing to Harbin as a youth following his mothers' arrest by the Soviet Union, Vladimir Efimovich Goltsov is as anti-communist as one can be. His firm hatred and beliefs led him to abandon his studies at the Chemical Mining Institute in 1937 to join the Russian Fascist Party. Initially and admirer of Rodzaevsky, he joined Matkovsky's wing instead during the split of the RFP, seeing Rodzaevsky as too much of a Germanophile.\n\nNow a firm follower of Matkovsky, Goltsov is preparing Magadan for the crusade to purify and save Russia. Using his past knowledge from his studies as well as his experiences as a railroad worker, Goltsov now works with the Vozhd closely to develop Magadan into a fulfilling base to carry out their operations to reconquer Russia. However, Goltsov's plans to transform an empty port into a thriving industrial and military hub remains to be seen.§!"

 MAG_fascist_splitters: "Fascist Splitters"
 MAG_fascist_splitters_desc: "Long ago, the Russian Fascist Party was a united organization, free from the civil strife that plagues everything in Russia. However, this unity did not last long. The doctrinal differences that divided its two heads, Konstantin Rodzaevsky and Mikhail Matkovsky, had simmered for years, perhaps for decades. It finally came into a head when Matkovsky seized the port town of Magadan for his own use. He promises a free Russia, an unshackled Russia, a Russia liberated from the chains of suffering and poverty. Only time will tell if his promise holds."
 MAG_gateway_into_russia: "Gateway Into Russia"
 MAG_gateway_into_russia_desc: "Beyond mere circumstance, the Vozhd had a specific intent when he chose Magadan to launch our struggle. The shores of this icy Pacific port bring many blessings. Smugglers from Kamchatka and Alaska alike carry great boons to be processed in the city every day. The Vozhd's government grows from the hub's riches, and in turn so does our legitimacy."

 MAG_fascist_renewal_desc: "Having reformed our regime to match our reality while not letting go of our ambitions, as well as having gained support from overseas, it seems that Matkovsky's gambles have paid off.

How we go about this is the subject of heated debate within the party, however.\n\n§nMikhail Matkovsky§! advocates for improving trade links with the OFN. However, he insists on exercising a healthy amount of protectionism while doing so by limiting direct foreign investments to a handful of economic districts arounds Magadan with the intent of preserving a majority of our economy as an All-Russian one. Thus he intends to protect Russian labor and culture deeper in Siberia.\n\n§gNikolay Petlin§!, for his part, is advocating for more far-reaching ties with the US that would allow American corporations to invest and operate as far as Irkutsk and beyond as we continue to liberate more of Russia from the petty warlords in the west. While this would give us greater access to American money, expertise and resources, it's controversial with the party's right-wing. We must choose wisely, as our economic doctrine going forward will have far-reaching implications for the future of the Russian nation."

 MAG_DEC_MAT_connect_magadan_with_the_south_desc: "While we may hold one of the most important pieces of strategic infrastructure in Russia, we might as well be landlocked if we can't move anything to or from the city itself. The stretch of the M56 that's supposed to connect Magadan is a dark chapter in our nation's history as this §WRoad of Bones§! marks another chapter of Bolshevik brutality against our people, one made all the worse from the fact that those who died in its construction died to build something that the permafrost made barely functional at the time, and which has largely eroded during the anarchy. We'll correct the errors of the past by repairing the damages done to the road in the recent conflict and use a professional labor force this time."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_magadan_amur_highway: "The Magadan-Amur Highway"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_magadan_amur_highway_desc: "With our former colleagues in Harbin defeated, we must sadly face the ramifications of the fact that those we once saw as allies were not great stewards of the regions they reigned over. Those that stuck it out with the delusional §WRodzaevsky§! to the very end were like lions led by a paranoid donkey, the state has been driven into disrepair and ruin by their leader's delusions. To the west, Chita bears the scars of a Tsar that didn't want to rule, and the decrepit White Army officers that were incapable of ruling. It's hard to say which is worse of the two, but the worst damage to our economy is the fact that the region's roads are left in ruins. The M58 highway that connects Amur to Chita will be restored to working condition, and it'll be done by the people that neglected it in the first place."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_make_reds_build_baikal_highway: "Make the Reds Rebuild the Baikal Highway"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_make_reds_build_baikal_highway_desc: "Some of the largest cities in Siberia still bear the scars of the Soviet rule, having been the regime's command center after it allowed Russia to fall to the Axis in the Second World War. The neglect and incompetence both Yagoda's reign of terror and the upstart rebels that sought to replace him showed has left the entire M55 road network in disrepair. Just as the Reds have put countless Russians to hard labor for their own nefarious end, we'll return the favor and make them rebuild a piece of what they ruined."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_magadan_mexican_trade_agreement: "The Magadan-Mexican Trade Agreement"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_magadan_mexican_trade_agreement_desc: "With our better-than-average ties to the Americas, we are in a position to approach developing nations on the continent for trade deals. As one of our most urgent requirements is food while we have minerals in abundance, we will approach Mexico. We will trade processed ore vital to their production economy at a fair rate. In exchange, we'll get food as well as fertilizers and other products to help us with our own agricultural development."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_golden_opportunities_in_amur: "Golden Opportunities in Amur"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_golden_opportunities_in_amur_desc: "For all his ranting and raving, our old friend Rodzaevsky often resembled a classical caricature of a Jew more than the people he hated: a scheming bastard that put a jackboot to the throat of the Russian people while sitting atop a mountain of gold, yet the bandit didn't even do anything with it. As such, the mines of Amur are both boundless in their potential, and utterly underdeveloped. We'll remedy this by having one of the state's most trusted construction companies take on the task of developing the bountiful gold mines of Amur. In short order, we'll make sure that the gold he didn't know what to do with will benefit the Russian nation and her people."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_magadans_port_facilities: "Expand Magadan's Port Facilities"

 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_magadans_port_facilities_desc: "Trade is the lifeblood of our nation, and it's this lifeblood that will allow us to rise above the petty bandit kings in the west. It was our access to foreign food, technology and weapons that allowed us to get back on our feet and reclaim this portion of the Motherland for our people. The §gVozhd§! believes that if we are to move westwards, we must expand Magadan and cultivate our trade ties with the world. With the healthy oversight of the state and its loyal corporations, we'll turn the power of capital into a mighty weapon that'll slay the beasts that have harmed our great nation."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_pmcs_in_magadan: "PMCs in Magadan"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_pmcs_in_magadan_desc: "To call our last experiment with mercenaries a dud would be an understatement. However, the failure was with the hired gun, not the concept itself. With our strengthened status, military power and financial clout we can afford to shop around for more reliable applicants. On top of giving us a small but steady stream of manpower, their superior expertise will give us permanent access to elite ex-officers from various OFN-aligned nations that will train our soldiers, NCOs and officers in modern, Western combat tactics. While controversial given the WerBell incident, every faction seems to find something to like with this setup. The §Jpragmatic Laborists§! see it as a good way to modernize our military, the §MReformists§! support the notion of improving our ties with the West, and the handful of old §WRFP hardliners§! that are still with us are just happy that non-Russians will sent out in front of the enemy machine guns once the war for unification begins anew."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_upgrade_the_irkutsk_hps: "Upgrade the Irkutsk HPS"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_upgrade_the_irkutsk_hps_desc: "While Irkutsk's hydroelectric power station is a marvel of Russian engineering in its own right, our Department of Energy estimates that it will not be able to provide enough to fuel all of our long-term economic plans. Indeed, it has hardly had any proper maintenance work at all during the anarchy due to a lack of spare parts and experienced engineers. If we face the need for energy rations now, then all of Eastern Siberia will go dark the day we try to fully industrialize. By purchasing spare parts from America and bringing in Western-educated engineers to train up a new generation of Russian power plant workers, we'll finally be able to bring the plant back to its full potential."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_stimulate_the_industrial_complex: "Stimulate the Industrial Corporations"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_stimulate_the_industrial_complex_desc: "With our improved access to the outside world comes the obvious benefits of having easier access to industrial equipment. While our landlocked rivals in the west struggle to get their hands on modern machinery as they're surrounded by uncooperative rogue states, our access to the sea changes the situation entirely. With the recent expansion of Magadan's facilities, we're in a good position to import the kind of machinery we need to revitalize our industrial economy with a focus on export products made in Russia, by Russians, using Russian equipment and resources."

 MAG_DEC_MAT_south_american_trade_mission_desc: "As our economy grows, so does our reach and ability to trade with other developing nations. As our primary friend is America, our most realistic option is to turn to nations such as Brazil to improve our financial situation. We'll trade our minerals for a variety of necessities that we cannot produce on our own here in Russia, ranging from coffee and other luxuries to rubber and strategic resources needed in our heavy industries."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_the_siberian_minning_economy: "The Siberian Mining Economy"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_the_siberian_minning_economy_desc: "Beneath the surface of Siberia lies vast, untapped riches.

 MAG_DEC_MAT_free_trade_port_of_magadan_desc: "In the end, it will be the §MReformists§! under §gNikolay Nikolayevich Petlin§! that will decide the economic future of Russia. Instead of looking inward and to our past, we'll look forward and abroad. The American model of free trade has turned their nation into the wealthiest on earth and has greatly enriched their people. Thus, it stands to reason that every true Russian patriot would want to follow that model as well. For what could possibly be a greater break from the destitution of Bolshevism and Tsarist serfdom than a free market capitalist system? And indeed, what could be a greater expression of love for the Russian nation and people than to want them to one day have the highest standard of living on the planet? As such, the port of Magadan shall be expanded once more, and this time turned into a large-scale trade port, one that will allow us to reap the benefits of global free trade."

 MAG_DEC_MAT_all_russian_trade_port_of_magadan_desc: "In the end, it is the §MLaborist§! followers of our beloved §nVozhd Mikhail Alekseevich Matkovsky§! who have won the day. Russia's power does not lie in money, nor can we rely on a foreign system to strengthen us. Our strength lies in our people and our national ethos. While we will trade and seek out good relations with the OFN nations, we will treat them like one would treat a good neighbor and friend rather than something to idolize and emulate. We'll use protectionist policies to protect Russian labor and culture at home and preserve Russian ownership of our corporations and strategic resources, but we'll do so while having the wealth generated by mutually beneficial trade agreements between us strengthen both our nation as well as those that are friendly to Russia and her national interests. As such, the port of Magadan shall be expanded once more, and this time it will become a proper trade port in the service of Russia's national interests."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_corporate_military_investment_program: "Corporate-Military Investment Program"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_corporate_military_investment_program_desc: "A way of safeguarding our national military and economic interests is to expand the role of the corporations in the defense sector.

 MAG_DEC_MAT_establish_foreign_investment_incentives: "Establish Foreign Investment Incentives"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_establish_foreign_investment_incentives_desc: "While we will exercise a healthy dose of protectionism to safeguard our national interests, autarky and isolationism were never our goals. Based on the earlier works of our Finance Department, we'll set up a program for limited foreign investments into our port cities and set up a series sensible restriction to make sure that the companies that operate there do so within the framework of Russian laws, hire Russian workers and as far as is possible use resources produced in Russia for any production that happens on our soil. Thus we'll meet them halfway: they get a diligent labor force and a lucrative investment climate, we maintain our pledges to the Russian people, and both parties will be richer from it."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_the_energy_sector: "Expand the Energy Sector"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_the_energy_sector_desc: "It's imperative for the continued growth of the Russian nation's economy that we incentivize corporate investments into the energy sector.

The great expanses of Siberia need to be tamed once more, and leading the charge shall be our corporations. By rapidly integrating the economy of Central Siberia into our Siberian National Republic and their newly liberated peoples into our nation, we'll be one step closer to reclaiming all of Russia."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_coastal_privitization_program: "Coastal Privatization Program"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_coastal_privitization_program_desc: "While the long-term plan is a broader adoption of the American model for our nation, we'll start slowly by allowing for western corporations to move into our coastal provinces. A looser regulatory framework as well as tax incentives will be set up to attract them to come here. While this exercise will mark a sharp turn away from the policies of Matkovsky and will thus likely see some growing pains while our nation adjusts itself to this new, westernized economic model, one oblast at a time."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_an_economic_fortress_against_manchuria: "An Economic Fortress Against Manchuria"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_an_economic_fortress_against_manchuria_desc: "Our rivals in the south not only occupy our lands, but they also pose an economic threat to us. In order to weaken them and mark a clear line in the sand that their influence ends at the border, we'll utilize tax incentives to allow western industrial companies to set up right along the border with Manchuria as a permanent reminder of Russian and American economic might to the Manchu and their Japanese overlords."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_american_investments_into_irkutsk_hps: "American Investments Into Irkutsk HPS"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_american_investments_into_irkutsk_hps_desc: "With our improved access to American scientists and engineers we're in a good position to make the deal to temporarily bring in western exports to restore the Irkutsk HPS into a more long-term deal. We'll allow American companies to invest into the dam and in exchange for a portion of the running profits, we'll gain permanent access to American-educated experts that will make sure that the power station becomes as powerful as the Hoover Dam itself."

 MAG_DEC_MAT_global_free_trade_port_of_magadan_desc: "From humble beginnings, Magadan has grown from a local port into a busy trade port with a global reach. With investments from American companies soaring and new opportunities rising in the recently liberated west, we must set out to expand the port of Magadan once more and turn it into an international container port. One day, this Russian port will rank among one of the busiest in the world, and its expansion will facilitate the growth of Central Siberia as well."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_great_siberian_highway_project: "The Great Siberian Highway Project"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_great_siberian_highway_project_desc: "The M53 was a planned highway project meant to link Irkutsk with Novosibirsk. Fallen on the wayside due to the outbreak of the Second World War and with its finished sections tarnished by the neglect of the many petty warlords that occupied the areas of land where stretches of this road still existed, it's truly in a sorry state. Our economists believe that with the right investments, we could turn the old vision into reality and link every major city of Central Siberia all the way to our coastal capital. A massive boon to our economy at times of peace, and an equally great benefit to our logistics when the time comes to reclaim the final stretches of Russia from the clutches of the bandit kings in the west."

With Russian arms rapidly becoming some of the finest in the world we need to build upon the industries of Novosibirsk, Kemerovo and Krasnoyarsk and establish ourselves as the aspiring military-industrial power of Eurasia.

 MAG_the_true_heir_of_harbin: "The True Heir of Harbin"
 MAG_the_true_heir_of_harbin_desc: "The Russian Fascist Party, as it was known in Harbin, is now gone. Long displeased with Rodzaevsky's policies and rhetoric, Matkovsky and his wing of the party has taken control of Magadan and are now molding it to suit their purposes. No longer shall the party struggle in the mud, while the whole of Russia suffers. No more thuggery, no more rhetorics of hatred; Mother Russia calls us to her fold, to rescue her from ruin.\n\nBefore Matkovsky can do his duty for his motherland, however, he must rule alone, without constraint and free of disloyalty. While he trusts his wing of the party, he must crush dissent among the ranks. All those suspected of loyalty to Rodzaevsky shall find themselves purged. With his political hold over Magadan secure, Matkovsky shall do his sacred duty, one that he has steeled himself to do ever since the heady days of Harbin: under his guidance, Russia shall stand again, sole, strong, unrivaled."

 MAG_building_the_wastes: "Building the Wastes"
 MAG_building_the_wastes_desc: "News of horror drifts from the west. German terror bombings, bandit raids, and wars fought by Russians against Russians: on the edges of far eastern Russia, Magadan is remote and sheltered from the troubles that plague the rest of the Motherland. Due to its distance, however, Magadan is not much. Located in the sparsest region of Russia, both in population and resources, there is not much here that is of use for the eventual liberation and reunion of Russia.\n\nMatkovsky will change that. The officials of his party shall travel the streets and outskirts of Magadan, for workers willing to join him in his crusade. They will build roads and telegram poles, small workshops, and manufactories. When the day of liberation dawns upon the dark body of Russia, laid to rest by failures of the Reds and the crimes of the Germans, they shall find themselves richly rewarded by their duty and dedication, for Matkovsky shall let no faith in him go to waste."

 MAG_siberian_factories: "Siberian Factories"
 MAG_siberian_factories_desc: "Magadan, as has been noted before, is remote and isolated from the rest of Russia. In the port town of Magadan itself, the industry that exists is small and not particularly tailored to the production of war materiel. Fortunately, in the Far East, this lack of industry persists everywhere, as the industrial center of Vladivostok, developed in the time of the Reds, is now lost to the Japanese and Manchurians. To put it briefly, all who we fight in the East are on a level playing ground.\n\nNo opportunity passes Matkovsky by, however. From the wastes of Siberia, he shall craft factories, with the express intent of waging war, not small-time conflicts between children. The party shall arm and train the soldiers of Magadan as soldiers, not bandits possessing a higher ideal. Additionally, no citizen sheltering under the wings of the party shall know poverty or lack; let this be an example, a vision of Russia to come."

 MAG_siberian_farms: "Siberian Farms"
 MAG_siberian_farms_desc: "As a famous Chinese strategist once said, "an army marches not on its feet, but its stomach." The port town of Magadan has always relied on outside imports during the time of the accursed Union and Empire to sustain its need for food. Deprived of connections to other regions of the Motherland, most of its inhabitants have turned to coastal fishing to make do in the meantime. A secret wish spreads in their hearts, born out of hunger: for a Russia to save them.\n\nThe party, and Matkovsky with it, shall heed their call. The officials will gather volunteers and conscripts to work in the fields of Siberia. The Far East is not fertile, but an effort from an honest Russian will be all it takes to create a miracle. We do not need our storehouses to be filled with food overflowing, just enough to survive the harsh climate of Siberia and feed our people. When Russia rises again, all these will be forgotten, like ashes in the wind."

 MAG_try_something_else: "Try Something Else"
 MAG_try_something_else_desc: "With the founding of the Siberian factories and farms, the party in Magadan has established itself as a force capable of action and reform. Unfortunately, these acts have only had limited success so far; as hard as it is for Matkovsky and his political clique, to admit it, time will only tell as to the efficacy of these efforts; for now, we can only wait. In the meantime, there is the matter of the armed forces of the party. Though capable and relatively well-armed, our men are not suited for or used to fighting in the far north.\n\nIt's time to try something else. Matkovsky, a soldier himself in an age long past, shall observe as his generals and officers forge from the soldiers a new army of hardened and experienced men capable of fighting in the tumultuous weather of Siberia. Drills will be a regular occurrence, whether in harsh or clear conditions. Every soldier of Magadan shall be the spearhead of Matkovsky's crusade."

 MAG_acquire_advisors: "Acquire Advisors"
 MAG_acquire_advisors_desc: "The lands of Siberia have a long history. From even before the time of the Empire's rapid expansion eastwards in past centuries, various peoples have dwelled here, enduring the harsh weather and making a living from it. The troops of Magadan have much to learn from them, and their advice on surviving in the wild could mean the difference between life and death in the unrelenting conditions of the Far East.\n\nTo acquire these advisors, some troops, along with local interpreters, will travel north to the lands surrounding Kamchatka. There we will establish contacts with the natives, in hopes of using their millennia of experience to aid the development of our own theory of warfare. We shall mold our soldiers into survivors, into victors! No longer shall they survive in the Siberian wilds by the skin of their teeth: from now on, they shall live with neither doubt nor concern given to the gods of the far eastern lands."

 MAG_radical_techniques: "Radical Techniques"
 MAG_radical_techniques_desc: "The Far East is a wild, wild land. Sparsely inhabited even during the Union and Empire, without the civilization to sustain the Russian expansion east, life has become challenging and unrelenting. In the forests and tundras of Siberia, war does not assume the character it has further west. With no significant infrastructure to speak of, warfare in the north has been reduced to skirmishes between the little powers that battle for control of the Far East. To come out on top in Siberia would mean abandoning the general precepts of war as it is taught in Europe.\n\nFor the sake of our cause, we must leave behind everything we know. After all, the methods of war change to fit the ages. Our soldiers will receive a radical new training regime, based on the lessons we have learned from the Siberian natives. Soon the forests and tundras of Siberia will be like the plains and fields of Western Russia to us, with no obstacle to stop us from attacking the enemy, whether it be Rodzaevsky, the Tsarists, or even the Reds."

 MAG_preliminary_arming: "Preliminary Arming"
 MAG_preliminary_arming_desc: "The time has come for the Siberian factories we built to bear fruit. With enough workers to staff their floors and sufficient machinery, they can begin to operate as intended. From the streets of Magadan, these factories' chimneys can be seen churning out smoke, a hint of the things they create within. Rifles, uniforms, bullets, even artillery guns and shells lurk inside of them. The party has triumphed again in the most desperate of situations, and Matkovsky is pleased.\n\nIt is time to arm the militant wing of the party. With adequate equipment, our soldiers will stand to fight the Reds, the Tsarists, or Rodzaevsky with much greater strength, even if it is a mistake to underestimate them so early. This advantage will afford us the opportunity we need to unify the Far East, as Matkovsky gears up for a crusade to liberate the motherland from the clutches of suffering and disunity."

 MAG_winterized_gear: "Winterized Gear"
 MAG_winterized_gear_desc: "Among all the ways that the Far East can be inhospitable, the most prominent is its low temperature. To move in the cold Siberian winter is hard, to fight in it is even harder. Worse, the gear that our soldiers currently use often decays or is otherwise useless in the harsh weather. We must find a solution as the winter conditions are a near-constant concern for the troops. Moreover, acquiring more durable equipment for the Siberian winter would give our soldiers another crucial advantage against our enemies.\n\nMatkovsky will order all military equipment to be winterized. As most of our equipment is not ready to be used in low temperatures, this will be a lengthy and involved process. However, this is a struggle we must endure. The eventual liberation of Russia will take everything we have, and this small inconvenience is nothing compared to that challenge; someday, when Matkovsky rules Russia, all of this will prove its worth."

 MAG_sitting_out_the_winter: "Sitting Out the Winter"
 MAG_sitting_out_the_winter_desc: "We have done all that we can. The factories and farms stand, their produce finding their way to the soldier and citizen alike. Native advisors have trained our men into hardened soldiers capable of surviving the inhospitable Far Eastern climate while maintaining combat effectiveness. The winterization order is complete; the equipment churned out by our manufactories are now capable of performing in low temperatures. We are ready to act, but winter is coming.\n\nThere is not much we can do against the forces of nature. We must sit the winter out, and station the soldiers to perform maintenance on the telegram poles and roads. Patrols will still happen, to ensure that Matkovsky's domain will remain free of crime and banditry, but no combat exercises will take place. All units will operate as usual, adjusting for weather. When it ends, there is an enormous task that awaits us all, and Matkovsky shall stand ready at the helm."

 MAG_desperate_times: "Desperate Times"
 MAG_desperate_times_desc: "After all that we have done, it has come to this. Our food supplies are running out, our winterized equipment barely works in the winter winds, and our farms and factories are non-functional. The winter might have come and gone, but it has left its mark on our efforts to stabilize the realm and gain traction amid the harsh Siberian conditions. Perhaps it is time to look outward, using Matkovsky's plans to reach out to foreign powers and émigrés to support his cause in Russia.\n\nWe have three options that we can go through. The Tsar, residing in Chita, is our unwilling enemy at best, but perhaps we can convince his clique to accept a ceasefire. The Americans, under their President Nixon, may be inclined to support us provided we make them promises of reform. Finally, the Russian émigrés, the most prominent of whom is the influential fascist Anastasy Vonsiatsky, might be persuaded to through their resources behind our cause. Regardless of whom we convince to support us, one thing is clear: the party will not survive alone."

 MAG_the_tsar: "The Tsar"
 MAG_the_tsar_desc: "Just barely separated from our territory by the vile forces of Rodzaevsky, Chita has more in common with us than most other warlord states. An evolution of the diverse émigré movements and organizations that appeared in Harbin, the regime has based itself not on fascism, but Tsarism. The group of White generals behind Chita's foundation approached Michael Andreevich, a descendant of the Romanovs yet one with little legitimacy as a contender for the throne, and took a part of Yagoda's empire as it collapsed.\n\nWe share a lot in common both in our ideologies and our enemies, and Mikhail seems eager to cooperate and forge a closer relationship for now. It might be difficult due to the lack of an overland connection, but that will not stop us from making contact with our new friends in Chita."

 MAG_smuggling_routes: "Smuggling Routes"
 MAG_smuggling_routes_desc: "The biggest problem with reaching a mutually beneficial relationship with Tsar Mikhail's state has been finding an answer to the question of how we reach them, but we have developed a solution.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that here in the Far East the settlements and the links between them are few and far between. This means that if we are careful and closely examine our pathways and schedules, it is actually possible to create a route or even several of them that will be able to connect us to Chita through secret means. These routes, guarded by our best men, will allow for a flow of weapons and resources that goes both ways, and even the transport of emissaries between our states. If we can smuggle anything we want to and from Chita, that is a good first step in overcoming geography and establishing diplomatic relations."

 MAG_put_aside_our_differences: "Put Aside Our Differences"
 MAG_put_aside_our_differences_desc: "We and the royalists of Chita have much in common, yet we have many disagreements as well. We share a common background, but while they trace their roots to the old ways of the Tsar's empire, our ideology stems from a new and fresh movement, that of Russian fascism. Of course, it is the faith of the old Russian generals and politicians in the power of a monarch that separates us, but that does not make reconciliation impossible in this dire environment.\n\nTo face the common enemy that is Rodzaevsky's Fascist Party, we will make a move showing our friendship and respect for Chita, by proposing a pact of cooperation and non-aggression with them. If they accept, then we may even have a chance to strike at Amur with more safety."

 MAG_divide_and_conquer: "Divide and Conquer"
 MAG_divide_and_conquer_desc: "Since the day we split from the RFP hardliners, Rodzaevsky's forces in Amur have been the biggest threat to our survival. No other frontier is as heavily guarded as our southern one, and it is not uncommon for the situation there to escalate into raids and skirmishes by the border garrisons. Now that we have found allies in Chita, we can make a show of force to demonstrate our power and test our capabilities as well.\n\nWe will find the perfect moment to strike, and when we do a raid larger than any other we've launched will begin. The Tsarists shall help distract Rodzaevsky's army in the east, and we will hopefully improve our position in the freezing lands of Eastern Siberia."

 MAG_the_president: "The President"
 MAG_the_president_desc: "To find our greatest possible supporter, we must look across the vast Pacific Ocean, and set our eyes on the superpower of the Western Hemisphere; the United States of America. They are one of the three most powerful nations in the world, and possess almost unparalleled industrial and military might. Matkovsky has set his eyes on getting at least a small fraction of that might to support his quest to reclaim Russia.\n\nPresident Nixon is the nation's current leader, and so far he has not shown much willingness to involve America in Russian affairs, something we need to change. There are two requirements to gain American support: the first is to prove our regime can be a useful and reliable asset - the second is to show that we are different from the fascists they hate. Achieving both will be crucial if we want overseas aid to arrive."

 MAG_the_siberian_bill_of_rights: "The Siberian Bill of Rights"
 MAG_the_siberian_bill_of_rights_desc: "A big obstacle preventing us from receiving support from across the Pacific is our ideology, as the American government is under the impression that we are an oppressive and totalitarian regime like the ones they are struggling to fight against. To portray ourselves in a positive light, perhaps it is time to begin making reforms, or at least appear to be making them, and a good start is a guarantee on the rights of our citizens.\n\nA formal document will be drafted and signed by Mikhail Matkovsky, guaranteeing basic rights such as equal treatment, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly to all people, ethnic Russians or not. Regardless of whether we follow this law to the letter, it will be a sign that we are eager to reform and we are not the same as the German Nazis, something the USA definitely cares about."

 MAG_promise_to_reform: "Promise to Reform"
 MAG_promise_to_reform_desc: "Now that we have stated our intent to ensure freedom for our own citizens, it is time to appeal to the United States directly, instead of beating around the bush. In an address made by our Vozhd in front of the citizens of Magadan and directed at the White House, he will state that the regime, even though it was born out of the RFP, is open to reform and it will not fight it, but embrace it instead.\n\nThe hope is that this great call for reform will reach the ears of the congressmen and even the President himself, and it will finally change their minds regarding the issue of Russia and how to best approach it."

 MAG_operation_intrude: "Operation Intrude"
 MAG_operation_intrude_desc: "The port of Magadan is one of the biggest Russian naval facilities still not occupied by foreign enemies. When the weather permits it, ships, Russian or not, regularly make stops for numerous reasons. However, the port also has one more use; to become a receiver of American equipment and supplies. Thus, our leader Matkovsky has devised a plan to make an offer the USA will not refuse.\n\nMagadan is quite close to the Japanese Home Islands, that are just across the Okhotsk Sea, and a radar station here would give our future allies the opportunity to spy on their sworn enemies from a closer distance. Perhaps this will make them understand the benefits we can offer, and they will decide to help us."

 MAG_the_vozhd: "The Vozhd"
 MAG_the_vozhd_desc: "Anastasy Andreyevich Vonsiatsky, or as he prefers to be known, the Vozhd of the Russias, is the leader of the fascist émigrés in America. Once a close partner of the Russian Fascist Party, Rodzaevsky's pro-German rhetoric drove him away. Leading his own political organization of White Russian émigrés, the RFO, he has garnered significant support from Russian refugees currently residing in the United States.\n\nNow that we have split from Rodzaevsky, perhaps Vonsiatsky would reconsider his support for the Russian Fascist Party. Having the backing of the foreign-based RFO would give us a source of income untouched by the bandit raids of Rodzaevsky or others. Along with this new stream of income, there are rumors that he knows one of the most dangerous men in America: a former OSS operative named Mitchell WerBell III. If there is a chance the Vozhd can put us in touch with him, we must reach out immediately."

 MAG_welcoming_werbell: "Welcoming WerBell"
 MAG_welcoming_werbell_desc: "The son of a Tsarist officer in the White Armies, Mitchell WerBell III became an OSS operative during the Great Patriotic War. Among the theatres he served in were then-British Burma and former French Indochina. After the war ended decisively in Japan's favor, he returned to America to work a mundane job, before deciding that combat was his calling. Since then, he has served in many conflicts the world over, earning him the fearsome nickname "the Wizard of Whispering Death."\n\nMatkovsky has decided that it would be in the party's interest to welcome this character of a man into our ranks. Along with him will come his entourage: a collection of mercenaries who have fought across the world and are now looking to fulfill any need for "wetwork". We will welcome him and his crew to the port town of Magadan. Once there, they will have their work cut out for them; they shall find that there is wetwork to do to their heart's content."

 MAG_old_money: "Old Money"
 MAG_old_money_desc: "The Russian Fascist Organization, Vonsiatsky's fascist political group, is home to some of the wealthiest donors within the Russian émigré community. Now that we have his backing, it is time to turn the funds they have provided to a higher cause than parties and gatherings in a land that will never be their home. The sons and daughters of Russia in America shall no longer find their money squandered by party functionaries for frivolous things: now, they support a real movement.\n\nThe RFO shall channel their money from America and across the Bering Strait, in the form of hard currency or even equipment, whether it be war- or industry-related. These funds and supplies will help us immensely in the coming conflict against the splitters and the Reds. Soon, we shall prepare for these estranged siblings of ours to return to a Russia they have known since their childhoods: a strong, capable Russia, one without an equal in this world."

 MAG_integrate_the_mercs: "Integrate the Mercs"
 MAG_integrate_the_mercs_desc: "The mercenaries that WerBell brought in are leagues ahead of our current soldiers. How could they not be? After fighting in wars the world over, they are perhaps the most elite force in the Far East, surpassing even the Red Army remnants that the Reds have. They have proven themselves to be a capable asset to Matkovsky so far, and although their loyalty is only as strong as their pay, they may well be worth the money.\n\nHowever, due to their independent nature, these mercenaries have been functioning outside the command structure, only taking orders from their commanders, and are generally uncooperative except for direct orders from Matkovsky himself. This practice must end. We will integrate the mercenaries into the rank-and-file; having better skills does not mean that one is exempt from subordination to a superior. Cooperation with a mercenary like WerBell might be distasteful for some Russians, but the day that Russia can stand on its own is still in the distance."

 MAG_our_secured_position: "Our Secured Position"
 MAG_our_secured_position_desc: "The Tsarists in Chita have agreed to a temporary truce, and they are even willing to cooperate in a limited capacity. The Americans have been appeased by our promises to reform, together with the Bill of Rights promulgated in Magadan and sent to American agencies. From overseas, the support of émigrés has become ours, as Vonsiatsky has deigned to join us in the crusade to liberate our sacred homeland. Our position is firm, secure; it is now time to solidify these advantages as Matkovsky's ideas take root in the Far East.\n\nBefore the party in Magadan proceeds to its holy task, perhaps it is time to stop and let the results of these treaties simmer for a while. Let the funds overseas flow into the coffers of the party, with American support ensuring steady gains. The limited cooperation with the Tsarists in Chita will continue, as we raid Rodzaevsky's followers from both sides. Soon, Matkovsky will use all that he has gained for his next step: a Siberian army."

 MAG_the_siberian_army: "The Siberian Army"
 MAG_the_siberian_army_desc: "The agreements that we have secured with the foreign powers, mercenaries, and the Tsarists have bought us valuable time and given us room to breathe. Now, the party can turn its eye towards the chief means of its holy task: the army. While the party is no pacifistic organization, its militant wing so far only consists of trainees and militia drawn up from the streets and outskirts of Magadan, given guns that are either crude or non-functional. If the push west is to happen, we need to reform them into a proper professional army.\n\nWe have several options for how we can approach this. The first is to adhere to a doctrine suited for a local force; after all, Russians know how to best fight on Russian soil. The second is to request American advisors, whose experience in the proxy wars of the world could win Russia as well. Last is the option of adopting WerBell's techniques in assembling our forces: his expertise will not disappoint us. Whichever we choose, the grand task continues."

 MAG_a_local_force: "A Local Force"
 MAG_a_local_force_desc: "A long time ago, during the civil war and the reviled Revolution, Matkovsky was once an officer cadet in the White Army, before the news of defeat drove him south to Manchuria. Most of our current military staff are from a similar background: White Army officers driven out of their motherland, seeking shelter in a foreign country while planning for their return in the meantime. They are adamant that only Russian tactics and strategy can win in Russian soil, a view that Matkovsky personally shares but has yet to endorse.\n\nIf we choose to adopt this path, we will not request any more American support outside of war material, and we will rebuff WerBell, who is only looking out for his own mercenaries. Russians know Russia best, after all, and the tactics of Russians, both Red and White, shall unite to lift the Motherland from her knees. Our duty is heavy and divine; a cross that only Russians can bear."

 MAG_white_army_tactics: "White Army Tactics"
 MAG_white_army_tactics_desc: "In the almost-forgotten past, faintly remembered even by Matkovsky himself, Russia was divided into two factions: the Whites and the Reds. The Whites fought for the preservation of the divinely-ordained order of Russia, while the Reds fought for the establishment of a workers' utopia. Though the Whites found themselves defeated by the Reds, their tactics and strategy allowed them to continue fighting longer they otherwise could have. Adopting their doctrine, particularly as it pertains to the Far East, is an excellent idea.\n\nOur officers will study the underpinnings and principles of the old White Army, applying them to training our own armed forces. Though reminiscent of tactics used in the First World War, soon the conditions and harshness of Siberia will hammer a coherent doctrine out of it. The men of the old order shall look upon us from the heavens: we shall not disappoint them today, nor any time soon."

 MAG_legacy_of_the_union: "Legacy of the Union"
 MAG_legacy_of_the_union_desc: "The Reds are our enemies; there is no question about that. Their military doctrine, however, is a subject of great interest to our officers. It was they who won over the Whites in the Civil War. It was they who held the Germans at bay, even as they pushed to the A-A line. If the stories from the west are correct, it was they who drove the Germans back, reclaiming much of the sacred soil of the motherland. Endorsing their ideals and studying their tactics are two different things: a difference our officers are keen to keep in their minds.\n\nOur officers shall scour the records in the town of Magadan, and piece together a coherent doctrine from whatever we can salvage. The Red's combination of force concentration and industrial might will serve us well, from the Far East to the western ends of Russia. Perhaps, given time, we can finish the job the Reds have failed to accomplish: the Germans shall not dally on Russian soil for long."

Without relying on the help of the outsiders, Matkovsky and his party have crafted a military force capable of fighting in the cold and bitterness of Siberian weather. The splitters in Chita and Amur, along with the Reds in Buryatia and Irkutsk, will learn to fear us now.\n\nIt is now time to take this army against them. The party shall arm them, and our officer corps shall staff them. We now control the most dangerous force in the Far East, and no one can stop us. Centuries from now, men and women shall sing of the great heroes of the Far Eastern territories: the soldiers who served and studied in the Siberian school, whose steady march freed Russia and took her to the world stage."

 MAG_a_foreign_force: "A Foreign Force"
 MAG_a_foreign_force_desc: "Some errors lay deep in the way Russia has heretofore conducted war. During the First World War, Russian armies were routed on the Eastern Front, planting the seeds for the revolution to come. In the second, the Reds could not hold a candle to the forces of the Germans, driven back by the Nazis to the A-A line. The tales that drift from the western ends of the Motherland tell of a revolutionary front, which came close to repelling the German invaders and toppling the Reichskommissariats but was defeated at the last moment by disunity within its ranks.\n\nIt is time to look outwards regarding the matter of warfare, and what better place to look to than our partners beyond the Bering Strait, the Americans? With our close partnership, we can study their ways of war, and perhaps one day learn their key to fighting and triumphing in conflicts all across the globe. Though it is not clear yet, their doctrine of overwhelming firepower and relentless force shall perhaps see Russia through its darkest times."

She has defended liberty the world over, and her sons have fought in conflicts from the First to the Second World War, from their Civil War to proxy conflicts around the world. Their experience and diverse perspectives, accumulated over decades of warfare might be just what we need to gain a breakthrough in the Far East. The promises that we made, as well as close ties we have forged with their government, will allow us to acquire valuable instruction in their ways of war.\n\nWe shall submit a request to the American representative in Magadan asking for advisors. Once they arrive, they will have their work cut out for them. They shall train our troops in the American doctrine of superior firepower and overwhelming force until our army can equal theirs in its skillful application of tactics and strategy. Their aid will be essential in our noble undertaking, providing our officers not only the way to fight but also to triumph."

Do the same to a German, and they would respond with a burst from their machine gun. Fire at an American, and he would call down an artillery strike on your position while he radioed for air support. With the support of their vast military industry, powered by competition and an enormous labor force, they make for a fearsome enemy to fight in the field.\n\nAlthough we do not have the infrastructure to sustain the number of attacks demanded by the American doctrine, with a steady supply of artillery shells and guns crossing the Strait, we can mimic them to a degree. Against the rag-tag opposition in the Far East, mere mimicry is enough. However, once the Far East is ours in its entirety, perhaps we can implement the American plans and doctrines to their fullest degree."

Without any significant infrastructure, conflicts in the forests and tundra are slow. Warfare is meandering and sluggish. Even the largest of armies can barely maintain a coherent front line, much less any disheveled force that could be mustered out of Magadan, Chita, Rodzaevsk, or Irkutsk. The Americans, with their trucks and quickly-built roads, may hold the answer to this problem.\n\nTheir solution? Maneuver warfare. Rather than a continuous confrontation with the enemy, the American instructors have introduced us to a novel way of confronting the enemy: to go faster than them, past the gaps of their formations, exploiting any holes in their lines. Once behind the frontlines, our units can wreak havoc and isolate groups of the enemy, cutting them off from reinforcement. Though we cannot fully embrace this method of war yet, we can benefit from laying the foundations for it now."

He desires an army of soldiers without borders, coming from all around the world to fight for the most prominent cause of freedom this side of Siberia: Matkovsky. Although flattered, Matkovsky has reservations about his idea.\n\nIf we choose to go down this path, we will invite every mercenary we can with the liquid money from our benefactors in America. The Party will permit its current formations to exist in their current form and fill or extend them with mercenaries as they become available. Perhaps the most radical path of army reform, the decision to continue on this path is not to be taken lightly. While it is necessary for our undertaking, many in the party itself doubt WerBell's good intentions."

Matkovsky believes that WerBell will live up to the trust that has been placed in him, and the army of soldiers without borders will become the deadliest force in the Far East in short order.\n\nIn the meantime, WerBell will be pulling out all the stops to ensure that the Far East is the prime place for a mercenary to find himself in. From all the corners of the globe, troops will continue to arrive, pledging to fight in the name of Matkovsky, the champion of freedom and democracy in Russia.

The issue now is not one of numbers, but of how to equip these professional soldiers. Though the Siberian factories are doing all that they can, a deficit of weapons and supplies remains. Luckily, WerBell has a plan.\n\nMitchell WerBell is a man who knows the underworld, and it recognizes him. By pulling a few favors and greasing a few palms, the legendary mercenary can rectify the weapon shortage with ease, he claims. If Matkovsky agrees to it, he promises to fill the armories of Magadan with not only an astounding quantity of weapons but also with state of the art ones, not the cheap local productions. Moreover, he vows to Matkovsky that he will lead his army to unite Russia come hell or high water. A vow that we must be careful to hold him to."

Though his motives are still a mystery, he doesn't appear to be a threat - yet. However, the shortage remains, and though it isn't as severe as before, it might be wise to keep a cache of arms for a rainy day - and it rains in Siberia, most of the time if it is not snowing.\n\nLike a magician pulling one trick after another out of his hat, WerBell has another solution to offer to Matkovsky regarding the shortage. He knows the smuggling routes in the Bering Strait, safe from the watch of the Soviet remnant navy currently stationed in Kamchatka. From the south, he also knows the ways in Japanese Manchuria, hidden from the sight of the Imperial Japanese Army. These routes, he reckons, will be sufficient to end the arms shortage currently plaguing us. We have little choice than to listen to him."

The party shall be one again, after all these years.\n\nMatkovsky and his officers will order all personnel to stand by and prepare for the operation against Amur, effective immediately. Our victory is assured, so long as everything that we have planned goes our way. The only wild card on the table is WerBell, the mercenary that Vonsiatsky brought with him. Hopefully, we have kept him on a tight enough leash that he does not do anything that would interfere with our plans, but some among our ranks note his rising power and doubt that our current measures are enough. Nevertheless, the operation must go forward."

Rodzaevsky is lucky; had the betrayal not occurred, we would have crushed him then and there. However, another opportunity to crush him once and for all will come along soon enough. Now, Matkovsky and the party must turn their attention to the matter of internal security.\n\nThe main bulk of the mercenary army has fled the field, breaking down into squads of individual soldiers as they stagger into the wastes of Siberia, while others have surrendered. The militant wing of the party shall hunt down the scattered units of mercenaries, giving them a choice: to serve under Matkovsky or die.

A little shaken by the assassination attempt, we will give the army some breathing space to compose themselves.\n\nThe soldiers shall return to their barracks for a brief period. All the vehicles gained from American supply will not go to the operation unfueled and unready. Everyone, from the officer to the private, shall inspect their equipment.

With but a command from Matkovsky, the operation will be underway. We expect the conflict to be short, with the victor determined after a few weeks; the moment for words is over: now might alone will decide which wing of the party shall triumph.\n\nIn a few days, Matkovsky shall personally sign the order to advance, and hand in the reins of conducting the war to his subordinates. Our troops shall break the uneasy and informal border between us and Rodzaevsky. Artillery fire shall precede them, as they shatter the pathetic armed militia Rodzaevsky dares to call an army.

After all, although they may be misguided, these men once followed the same ideals as Matkovsky, and in leaving Harbin, they have proved to be determined to return to and restore the Motherland.\n\nMatkovsky shall be lenient with them. He shall coat his hand in velvet, while he hands pardons and punishment from his high seat in Magadan. Those who prove themselves to be worthy of mercy, he shall spare, and let them redeem themselves on the field. Those rabid devotees of Rodzaevsky, he shall exile to the wilderness of Siberia, or put them to death for crimes committed during Rodzaevsky's reign.

The days of the split are behind us, as all the members of the party agree to join Matkovsky in his holy crusade: the liberation of Russia from ruin and suffering.\n\nHowever, in the Far East, there are still enemies that lurk in the background. The Reds in Irkutsk and Buryatia have settled their own schism and are preparing to retake their former territories.

Left with little choice, Mitchell WerBell has launched his coup in the middle of preparations of war against another Russian fascist, based in Amur: Konstantin Rodzaevsky. Scattering Matkovsky's army, WerBell has now come into possession of the port town of Magadan. Unfortunately, Matkovsky has escaped.\n\nIt might not be much, but Magadan has a harbor large enough to accommodate any soldiers of fortune that heeded WerBell's call. Though small in number, the mercenaries will roam and patrol the borders of Magadan, hunting down soldiers who swore their loyalty to Matkovsky. We will present to our prisoners two choices: fight for WerBell, or die. Hell, maybe in the long and deep search into the country, we might even find Matkovsky himself. After he's dead, we will consider that debt settled."

However, with thousands of men begging for transport to other parts of the world, we can cut them a deal of a lifetime.\n\nWe will go to war against Amur. This Konstantin might have been partying in his offices, rejoicing in the fact that Matkovsky is seemingly gone forever, and the mercenaries will ship out in order. Well, he's in for a surprise. We will cross our informal border and destroy them. It's nothing personal, Mr. Rodzaevsky; in our defense, we are not after you, but the stuff you keep in your vaults.

Without Amur and its mineral deposits, paying for the mercenaries on an unappealing export of fish and bread is impossible: we need to find a way out, and Rodzaevsky has something that we all want.\n\nIt is time to tighten our grip on the Far East. Rodzaevsky cannot be allowed to stand at all. His army of bandits and fascist amateurs shall stand no chance against a modern and experienced army armed with the best gear in the whole known earth.

Maybe this land will provide an answer to our troubles after all.\n\nFirst things, first, however. In our naive belief that we will escape this godforsaken land with gains made from Rodzaevsky and Matkovsky's "heirlooms," we have not bothered to construct any form of civilian governance over the area. Now that we are booked for a much lengthier stay in Siberia than we thought, it is a prime time to establish order over Magadan and Amur.

Instead, the mercenaries he led won the Siberian civil war with a panache befitting his long and storied career.\n\nThe dust has settled. We still have enough concerns about pay, equipment, and morale, but for now, we are secure. To our west lies the land of the Tsarists, strange folk who want the emperor back in charge of Russia. Then there are the Reds, with their little scuffle over, the outcome as opaque as it has ever been. From the north, our caravans there hear of the Father and his exploits.

We've had little use for them due to our narrower definitions of degeneracy from those in Amur.\n\nThis is a far cry from when the party operated out of Harbin, where they were active, trained and disciplined. They now wallow away as drunkards and thugs on the tavern's floor with little purpose. They must be set straight, forged into spears that will pierce the heart of our enemies. They will serve as the vanguard in our great crusade to reunify the nation - and we cannot afford them to be weak."

Brash displays of machismo and strength from some Blackshirts in the streets and bars of Magadan have helped entice recruits from the city to join the party, yet we have made little effort towards reaching those in rural Siberia.\n\nThis changes now. We desperately need more men to lead the national revolution and thus, we will make service compulsory. This will see men with a diverse array of experiences fighting for the nation, whether they be hunter, farmer or even a measly clerk. The Amur wing of the party breathes down our neck, and we need as many patriots as possible to triumph over them, to reunify the party - and the rest of Russia."

With the great Port of Magadan under our control, we are the only Russian statelet to which the Americans can reliably send aid. Mercenaries from across the world also pour into the port, hired with piles of cold hard cash to please their mysterious benefactors.\n\nWe must keep this aid flowing to keep an edge over the other Russian contenders. To do so, the port must be maintained and expanded. This will certainly pay off quickly, hastening the flow of aid to Magadan and potentially furtherly enticing the Americans."

He disavowed Rodzaevsky, and his nazi rhetoric yet was charged by the Americans for working with German interests. We overlook this as Vonsiatsky is married to the heiress of a fortune. Her father had investments and connections within the American railway, allowing Vonsiatsky to funnel funds to the party. Appeasing him would further the flow.\n\nAlternatively, we could look for other avenues of support outside of a single man. The monarchists of Chita have tried to appeal to emigre communities, a strategy that may prove fruitful. Though this would require us appeal to them, our link with Rodzaevsky will be seen as unfavorable to many. We must appear more moderate and as the best candidate to free Russia if we wish to receive support from those not fascist ideologues."

He understands the dangers accompanied by this position, noting the thuggish use both Rodzaevsky and the Italians had of their blackshirts. The brutish nature of these groups dampened public support for the Russian Fascist Party and must be contained. Still, Matkovsky sees the greater value that these groups provide to the Party and nation. They are an arm of the Party that can reach beyond the bureaucracy, granting control and authority over the affairs of the state and day-to-day life. Petlin says otherwise, but what does he know? Moderation in the face of the oncoming conflict will only lead to the triumph of degeneracy."

It is an old idea inspired by the Republicans that briefly held power in 1917 and the many other nations tarnished by the German Reich. An independent decision-making collective that is untainted by the finagling of ignorant politicians is certainly appealing. However, by allowing the military out of sight, the Party concedes, however indirectly, the absolute grip it has on civic and political life. In other matters, Matkovsky's opposition would have put an end to any debate. On this occasion, he leaves it up for his War Council to decide."

A society where the sweat on a man's brow earns him his place within it - and is not influenced by a rigid racial hierarchy or incompetent emperors. Workers need not organize, collectively bargain, or embrace the socialist ideals that corrupted the nation.

The Party does not have an economic plan, only one of survival.\n\nThe War Council must change this. They will provide the groundwork for rapid production and industrialization, ensuring that guns, uniforms, and the myriad of equipment necessary for the conduct of war flow steadily from factories in Magadan and overseas into the hands of our soldiers.

It is a matter of practicality: we are the easiest to reach and a Matkovsky-led Russia would be friendly to American interests. These interests in question are, naturally, corporate.

With American guns, advisors, and war machines, we will earn back every kopek. Besides, this venture was never about money. The riches will flow later, for now, we must focus on reclaiming our lost lands overrun by Nazis, Tsarists, and communists.\n\nToday, we feel the pinch.

The Party will trumpet the benefits of economic independence for all to hear. It will be difficult and we will not lie to our people, but they will come around to our way of thinking soon enough.

Blood, as they say, is thicker than water, and there is the essential Russian characteristic common between all of these.

Russians are slaughtering Russians, and the loyal minorities run amok without guidance. We must remind the people of what this country stood for, what it will become once again.\n\nIt is not enough that we convince our own people of our shared cause, but we must also remind all of Russia.

Not only was it draining government funds, but it was also determined to be of negligible utility, as most in Magadan at the time didn't even own radios.\n\nTimes have changed now, and Magadan is more prosperous than it once was. More people have radios and the government has more money. It could be beneficial for us to restart the radio service, this time more strictly under government control."

This council will advise and weigh in on government policy, helping us steer our policy in such a direction that will benefit the economy overalls. The members of these groups will be elected from coalitions of companies and corporations that work in any particular industry.\n\nFor example, the mining industry will have its own representative, as will manufacturing and communications.

Not only is most of it decades old, leftover from the former Soviet Union and its industrial projects, but they're practically falling apart after so many years of use. Not only that, but our old and inefficient equipment is making our products more expensive and less competitive.\n\nIf we want to revitalize Russia's manufacturing sector and make our exports more attractive, we are going to need to bring our equipment up to the standards of the rest of the world.

Even then, after a long day's work and a short night's rest, they get the bare minimum a company is willing to shell out for their pay, sometimes not more than a few cents on the dollar an hour.\n\nIt's an angering thing, working so hard for so little, and the lower class seems to agree. If we're not careful, they may even fall under the influence of some charismatic populist or communist offering salvation in their ideologies. If we want to prevent that from happening and improve the stability of our nation, we should work towards improving the laborer's lot in life, starting with his pay."

 MAG_free_enterprise_desc: "During the warlord period of the Far East, Magadan's trade policy was made rather restrictive and limited. This wasn't so much for the protection of our industry so much as it was for national security. Agents and other malcontents were finding it rather easy to slip back and forth across the border with minimal interference when acting under the guise of businessmen and traders. When word got around about how simple it was to move people and goods across the border, the people were demanded action. The party agreed and put forth a series of restrictive trade laws and border regulations.\n\nHowever, times are different now, and if we want to loose the full power of capitalism and the free market on the economy, we are going to have to repeal those laws."

Not only were they roughly jerked around as hostile nations traded blows over their land, but they also witnessed helplessly as the bombings, fighting, and raids saw their farms destroyed. Under our government, this will be no more.\n\nThe peasantry of the nation will be subsidized for their troubles, in order to aid them in repairing their homes and livelihoods. This subsidization program will include funding for new agricultural equipment and methods, which will hopefully allow them to outproduce previous records by leaps and bounds."

Originally built by the USSR during its mad run of construction projects before the collapse, the university was to have several schools, among which there a School of Mining, School of Law, School of Economics, School of Construction and Ecology, and several more.

The plan made significant progress in the short time it was being developed before Bukharin was removed from power, and continues to be the foundation of the Siberian economy even today.\n\nWe should seek to emulate such success. The plans were no secret in the Soviet Union, given the vast amount of resources and manpower it demanded. Factory managers and administrators all over the former union still have knowledge of this plan, and our administration has even found some documents and schematics that have been kept hidden away for all these years. We can turn these plans and schematics into Siberian Plan of our own. A Far Eastern Plan, perhaps."

To that end, the Industrial Recovery Act will invest several millions of dollars into improving old factories and building new ones with the goal of incentivizing foreign corporations to set down roots in the Siberian National Republic.\n\nIf we can provide all the construction materials, raw materials, and transportation infrastructure to make starting a factory here cheap and easy, investors will come and invest."

Our Homestead Act will seek to alleviate this by incentivizing our people to abandon the cities and make out there in the wild free lands of the north. Not only will we be offering free government land, but we will additionally further support farmers and homesteaders by offering government supply surpluses for their use at heightened discounts, mostly in the way of construction materials. Should all go well, we will see a further utilization of previously unproductive land sparking a population boom."

Mining companies in our lands extract hundreds of thousands of tons of gold, nickel, coal, iron, and chromium every year, and we expect that we could extract several times more than that with the right investment of capital and manpower.\n\nNot only would such additional resources production vastly benefit our economy, but our military industry would prosper as well. There are a variety of rare and valuable minerals that we find ourselves in constant need of when producing weapons or similar military equipment, and trading internationally for such resources can be a great national security risk, one we will hopefully avoid by increasing resource production domestically."

 MAG_the_national_republican_armed_forces_desc: "The armed wing of the former Russian Fascist Party served their nation well in the past, marching from victory to victory all across the Far East. That being said, it has become increasingly clear that this force of armed thugs and vagabonds simply won't do if we are to continue the campaign to reclaim Russia. While we have no shortage of eager fighting men, the Siberian National Republic still has no official organized military to speak of.\n\nLet us remedy this before it is too late. The green light has been given for the formation of our young republic's official ground forces: the National Republican Army. The NRA is envisioned as a well-equipped and professional modern force, capable of facing any kind of potential battlefield scenario. Building such a force will take effort, but any price is worth paying for an army worthy to serve in Russia's name."
 
 MAG_tactical_refinement: "Tactical Refinement"
 MAG_tactical_refinement_desc: "The current unit tactics of the Siberian National Republic's armed forces are mostly unchanged from the days of the Russian Fascist Party. While they worked well enough and allowed for our total control over the Far Eastern regions, perhaps it would be wise to move on to a more intelligent tactic than just running and shouting at the enemy with guns blazing.\n\nPast battles have proved that, while this approach is quite heroic in theory, in practice it usually results in more casualties than necessary. The newly established high command of the NRA suggests a shift towards more conventional squad tactics to minimize casualties while simultaneously improving our units' performance on the field."
 
 MAG_new_training_methods: "New Training Methods"
 MAG_new_training_methods_desc: "Currently, our soldiers would be charitably described as an undisciplined gang of thugs. Given the minimum level of training necessary and pushed out into the field without installing any real sense of professionalism, much of the army consists of rabid dogs prone to committing wholly preventable acts of collateral damage while, at the same time, being likely to turn tail at the first sign of danger.\n\nRigorous training regimens will be the key to turning this lawless rabble into a proper fighting force. The United States, a close partner of our regime, has one of the finest militaries on the planet at their disposal. Their troops' level of discipline is second-to-none, and we can only dream of building an army of the same kind of quality. The first step on that long road lies in overhauling the methods used to turn young men into soldiers, and we shall look to the American system for inspiration."

 MAG_stock_the_armories_desc: "The only thing just as important as manpower is the guns they use. The plans for the establishment of the National Republican Army call for a massive increase of the total size of the armed forces, and right now our weapons production facilities are woefully inadequate to meet the potential demands.\n\nWe'll just have to make do with what we have. Our fledgeling armaments industry shall work round the clock to fill the armaments with high quality, modern weapons for our new recruits to use. If we can find ways to streamline the methods of weapons production, there will be no hesitation implementing them in the assembly lines. There must be a fully-loaded rifle in the hands of every soldier!"

How are the troops of the republic supposed to go into battle without skilled leaders to guide them? Our current pool of "officers" won't exactly be easy to work with- most of them are glorified gang bosses with cliques of loyal button men surrounding them like sycophantic flies.\n\nProfessional officers will be made of those who aren't too heavily consumed by the abyss of corruption, and promising new recruits will supplement those who are. Talented officers form the bedrock of a professional army, and encouraging strong leadership in the military would go great lengths in ensuring that the NRA becomes more than just a rag-tag band of brigands."

The wars were brutal and inhumane beyond reason, but our brave boys pulled through and claimed victory even when the situation appeared hopeless.\n\nTruly this is one for the history books, a fine ray of hope in this dark chapter of Russian history! The struggle is not yet over, however, and our heroes will need all the help they can get when the time comes to bring all of Russia together again. The forces who oppose us are stronger than ever, and it will take all the strength we have to bring them to their knees.\n\nBrave men of the East, we hereby call upon you to join our cause!

The armaments production centers in particular would be of great help to the cause, but upon further inspection it is obvious that they have seen much better days. Torn apart in the midst of the Bolshevik mutinies and further damaged during our invasion of the region, they will need some serious attention to bring them back online.\n\nOn top of the renovations, a comprehensive expansion of the facilities is planned. The capabilities of the Buryatia Military Complex will far surpass what it was able to achieve during the Bolshevik era. It will become the nucleus of the National Republic's military industry, tirelessly churning out vast quantities of war materiel for the army."

 MAG_study_foreign_designs_desc: "The state of the National Republican Army's equipment is, frankly, completely unacceptable. Bolt-action rifles and submachine guns might have been at the forefront of military ingenuity half a century ago, but they are simply too ancient by the standards of today. The fact is we need better guns, and lots of them. Ideally, standardized with all the modern bells and whistles would serve our purposes perfectly, but how to decide upon designs?\n\nThrough our ties with the United States, we could examine those of which are currently in use with the US military. From fully-automatic assault rifles firing intermediate cartridges to man-portable tank killers, the American arsenal is formidable indeed. We shall send experts from our R&D department on a field trip to the US with the aim of studying their weapons and finding ways to adapt them for our own forces."
 
 MAG_projekt_zmey: "Projekt Zmey"
 MAG_projekt_zmey_desc: "The National Republican Army currently has no mechanized element to speak of. Even motorized equipment is a rare sight amongst the troops, and most have to make do with horses or specialized sleds. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, mechanized forces have become the standard. In the process of modernizing, mechanization is simply non-negotiable. We need IFVs, and we need tanks.\n\nThe R&D department has begun an initiative fancifully called "Project Zmey": a research project tasked with developing modern fighting vehicles for the armed forces. Among the highest priorities are armored personnel carriers and main battle tanks, the bread and butter of any proper modern military. Our brave troops screaming across the battlefield in mobile carriers armed to the teeth with cannons and missiles is quite the spectacular image, and with a little effort it can become reality as well."

 MAG_reorganize_the_branches_desc: "The organization of the National Republican Army is coming along well, and is rapidly becoming the modern force that was optimistically envisioned several months ago. That being said, the NRA cannot possibly hope to achieve everything at once. An air force to support our ground troops is badly needed, and it is imperative that we begin to assemble a separate military branch to serve in this regard.\n\nTo make matters worse, we have no actual fleet to guard the critical port of Magadan. The ships we do have could hardly be considered military vessels- being more intended for fishing than conducting war on the high seas. Before we can begin efforts to construct a fleet worthy of a newly revitalized Russia, a separate naval arm must be created."
 
 MAG_the_national_republican_navy: "The National Republican Navy"
 MAG_the_national_republican_navy_desc: "Despite our stronghold of Magadan being the most vital port in Russia still under the control of Russians, our republic still has no real navy to speak of. We have a few ships capable of undertaking military duties in the port of Magadan, but they are unorganized and not entirely ready to be sent out to sea. This changes today.\n\nThe National Republican Navy will be established to stand guard over Russia's waters, and the few existing ships of Magadan will be reorganized into proper fleets commanded by the few capable admirals we have at our disposal. To accomplish the further expansion of the new navy, the port of Magadan must be expanded far beyond its previous capabilities. Although it will never match the facilities of former Vladivostok, Magadan could perhaps become the next best thing."

 MAG_salvage_the_fleet_desc: "When the Vozhd's forces captured the naval bases of Kamchatka, they had expected to find formidable Red Navy war vessels in near-pristine condition. What they found instead were retrofitted scrap heaps and rusty old tubs that could hardly be described as sea-worthy! Now we have a "fleet" of useless scrap heaps sitting in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky accomplishing nothing else besides being a major eyesore. Surely we could find a use for them?\n\nOur trade fleet needs ships, and some of these old vessels could serve that purpose handily. All they would need is some salvage work, and we could potentially get them sailing again. As for the glorified rust buckets that could not be useful to us in any possible scenario, we could always just sell them or break them down for scrap. One man's trash is another's treasure, after all."

 MAG_the_national_republican_air_force_desc: "It is the foolish man who assumes that wars are only fought and won on the ground! Our new military is badly exposed without a strong air force to support them, and it is this fact that has led to the formation of the National Republican Air Force. Like their ground-based counterpart, the NRAF is envisioned as a fully modernized air force, equipped with some of the finest aircraft in the world.\n\nThese dreams are still a ways off due to our present scenario, but the foundation of a proper air component to the military is a good first step. The R&D department is already hard at work examining the latest foreign designs to adapt in some form for our new air fleet, and the results are promising indeed. Time to claim the skies for Russia!"

 MAG_expand_the_airfields_desc: "The National Republican Air Force grows by the day, but lacks proper air bases to conduct missions from. We could just build new air fields, but that would take far too much effort that would be better spent elsewhere. Besides, what use would building an ad-hoc landing strip in the middle of nowhere be when we have perfectly good facilities available for use right now?\n\nThere are several air bases previously controlled by the Tsarists and Bolsheviks that have gone unused since our conquest of the region. As such, these airfields are to be repaired and expanded to house an even greater capacity of aircraft than before. With time, they will become the nerve centers of the NRAF, the proverbial springboard from which all of their missions into the West will be launched."

Many of these sharp military minds now serve in our military, and have suggested the construction of a new military academy for the purpose of training the NRA's next line of officers. The existing high command has been quite receptive to this idea, and a suitable venue in Chita has already been decided upon to be renovated into what will become the Chita Military Academy.\n\nThis is where eager young recruits will be shaped into proper commissioned officers, worthy of commanding our troops and leading them to victory. With a healthy supply of new officers graduating from the academy, the soldiers of the National Republic can rest assured that only the finest military minds shall guide them into the fray. We can accept nothing less for the valiant army that is expected to make Russia whole again!"

The establishment of the National Republican Army has exceeded our wildest expectations, and a fully modernized, professional military now awaits our command. No doubt, our neighbors to the west will grow rather nervous once they catch sight of our newly reorganized forces!\n\nPerhaps it is time to put our theories into practice. The National Republican Army stands ready, the National Republican Navy has their eyes to the sea, and the National Republican Air Force is prepared to unleash hell from above. At last, we can finally claim to be ready to continue the reunification of Russia.

[MAG.GetLeader] has requested that shipments of our older, less-necessary weapons and ammunition be covertly smuggled into Manchuria for these groups with the hope that they will turn around their gradual, seemingly inevitable slide into defeat against the Japanese."
 
 MAG_the_world_beckons: "The World Beckons"
 MAG_the_world_beckons_desc: "With our promises made to the diaspora, the trade deals we've forged across the international community, and our adaptation of a staunch anti-Japanese stance in world politics, it seems that for the first time in a long time, the world's eyes rest upon Russia; and not just any Russia - ours.\n\nThe National Republic has come a long way from the desperate existence that we were eking out mere years ago - we have destroyed our old rivals, vanquished the remnants of the Soviet Union, not to mention besting the crazed cultists and their enigmatic leader. Now that we have established ourselves both domestically and internationally, the world beckons to the National Republic - and we will not hesitate to step forth."

 MAG_a_new_dawn_for_the_republic: "A New Dawn for the Republic"
 MAG_a_new_dawn_for_the_republic_desc: "After no small amount of bloodshed, political intrigue, and economic struggles, we've finally managed to unify almost all of Siberia. From our humble beginnings in the freezing port of Magadan to the present, it seems as if it was forever ago that we were barely clinging on to our lives.\n\nHowever, much work still has to be done. While we're still planning on pushing westwards to reunify the entirety of Russia, there is also much to deal with domestically. The former Vozhd, tyrant and dictator, Mikhail Matkovsky once promised sweeping reform to placate the people and to create the illusion of cooperation to attract the investment of the Americans. However, his words were ingenuine and his promises false. Now that he has been removed from power, we can focus on real and meaningful reform."
 
 MAG_depoliticize_the_armed_forces: "Depoliticize the Armed Forces"
 MAG_depoliticize_the_armed_forces_desc: "Despite all best efforts, we've witnessed the rise of corruption and cronyism within our armed forces, even from the earliest days following the trumping of the bandit king Rodzaevsky and the Tsarists of Chita. Plenty of officers maintain political ties, especially worrying are the ones who find themselves close with the Laborist wing of our party - those who would support the tyrant Matkovsky.\n\nThis cannot and will not stand. Our administration has worked too hard to marginalize Matkovsky's supporters and too much has been risked to allow a simmering of military support to boil over into a coup. We must investigate those who have ties with the Laborists - or any political wing. We should remove the worst, marginalize the others, and by doing so ensure that the military works for the government, and not the other way around."
 
 MAG_cooperative_federalism: "Cooperative Federalism"
 MAG_cooperative_federalism_desc: "From the top to the bottom of our administrations, from the governmental halls in our major cities to the most basic of village administrative centers, there needs to be cooperation. After all, all individuals, and by extension, all governments, have a shared set of issues that need to be dealt with.\n\nThus, we should begin implementing a system, based on an American model, of cooperative federalism. That is, all federal, state, and local governments should work together, cooperatively and collectively, in order to solve problems shared among them. This policy is aimed at preventing the respective levels of government from dealing with problems separately - instead promoting an atmosphere of collaboration and trust between the highest government officials and the people that they represent."
 
 MAG_bond_the_eagles: "Bond the Eagles"
 MAG_bond_the_eagles_desc: "The eagle has long been emblematic of the United States of America - but it also represents the Russian people. The eagle is chief among birds, the king of the skies. It is a noble beast, filled with endurance, resilience, and power. The American people are represented by the eagle, but so too should the Russians be.\n\nBy extension, the two eagles of the world should not go alone into the darkness that is the international community. With our meaningful, real reform, surely the Americans will see now a valuable ally in our administration, now, and in the future. We should reach out to them once again and continue to tie ourselves to them - the future of Russia is with the Organization of Free Nations."
 
 MAG_the_shadow_of_the_vozhd: "The Shadow of the Vozhd"
 MAG_the_shadow_of_the_vozhd_desc: "Mikhail Matkovsky was many things. He may have been a tyrant, and he may have been a dictator, but he was certainly no idiot, nor was he a raving loon. Matkovsky was tactful, smart, and politically skilled. He spent his time working hard to create and preserve a nucleus of support - one that still, regrettably, exists despite his removal from power.\n\nThe shadow of the Vozhd still hangs over our administration, and his supporters, hiding in said shadow, prevent us from achieving what needs to be done. They need to be rooted out, exposed for who they are. The Laborists need to be rendered defenseless and slighted - those brave enough to do so are even claiming that the former dictator was falsely imprisoned! These individuals are dangerous, and must be treated with the same degree of severity as the Vozhd himself."
 
 MAG_disband_dalstroy: "Disband Dalstroy"
 MAG_disband_dalstroy_desc: "Dalstroy, in name a work-for-pay construction program, and in effect a highly efficient series of forced labor camps, is one of the perhaps most damaging effects of Matkovsky's legacy. The massive complexes that have, admittedly, granted us many economic boons, have also long acted as a symbol of oppression for the Russian people regardless of creed or political affiliation.\n\nNo more.\n\nDalstroy shall be disbanded, its officials prosecuted to the full extent of our new laws, and the people trapped within the programs freed to work where they please, returning to families and hometowns. No longer will innocents be forced to work terrible conditions for almost nothing in return."
 
 MAG_caging_the_corporations: "Caging the Corporations"
 MAG_caging_the_corporations_desc: "One of the ways that the Vozhd hedged his political power in the nation was by making deals with a number of corporations, Russian or otherwise. These corporations contributed generously to his own personal funds, which he used to buy off opponents, intimidate those who wouldn't be bought, and ensure that his grip on power would never loosen. In return, these corporations would be granted preferential treatment in a quid pro quo scenario.\n\nThese corporations have, of course, become accustomed to this sort of a deal, and now that we're in power, are in what is essentially open revolt due to our refusal to honor the prior deal. Despite their lingering influence in our administration, we need to work to eliminate their legacy in politics so that we can ensure that the government serves neither the military nor the private sector, but instead the Russian public."
 
 MAG_the_redemption_of_harbin: "The Redemption of Harbin"
 MAG_the_redemption_of_harbin_desc: "The city of Harbin, in the heart of Manchuria, is a city of many things. Paramount among them, unfortunately, is the legacy of the Russian Fascist Party, created by the ridiculous character that was once Konstantin Rodzaevsky. Because of the origin of the party there, many in the international scene, let alone in Russia, know it as the center of what was once the organization that systematically terrorized those that it believed to be its ideological opponents.\n\nBut Harbin is so much more than that. A center of Russian émigré culture, a home to many, including our dear leader. A place where cultural roads crossed with one another. Harbin should not be remembered solely as the birthplace of the Russian Fascist Party. We must ensure that the memory of where we had our humble beginnings is known as a positive, not a negative one."
 
 MAG_siberian_spring: "Siberian Spring"
 MAG_siberian_spring_desc: "Since our conquest of Central Siberia, we've held a tenuous grasp on the territories at best. However, it's imperative that we make sure that we integrate them, extending our administration westwards, and ensure that we have a concrete grip on our new lands. This way, we'll make more in tax revenue, have a larger pool of manpower to draw recruits from, and have a greater well of industry to ensure that the weapons of war that we need to win the unification of Russia will be readily available to our brave soldiers.\n\nTo do this, there are a number of things that we can do. However, paramount among them is the assurance of rights and liberty for all Russians within our borders, and the education of those Russians on the importance of liberty and freedom and the benefits that those concepts, and by extension our administration, bring them."
 
 MAG_the_assembly_of_novosibirsk: "The Assembly of Novosibirsk"
 MAG_the_assembly_of_novosibirsk_desc: "With our new territories comes a vast amount of new people - chief among them many politicians that once held sway in other warlord states. Some of these politicians could theoretically be rehabilitated and used to help administer Central Siberia. Others could even be welcomed into our party. After all, who would be better than they as experts on Central Siberian politics?\n\nWe should hold a conference in Novosibirsk, by far the most populous city in the region, to discuss with ourselves and these new politicians about the political integration of the area as well as to help integrate and normalize those who could be welcomed into our party."
 
 MAG_a_new_course: "A New Course"
 MAG_a_new_course_desc: "We have taken many influences from the Americans in recent years, so why not take one more? No one in our party would argue that our administration needs to depart from the track that the tyrant Matkovsky had put it on. However, there has been a great deal of speculation on what course we could take.\n\nOur leader, Nikolay Petlin, has put forward a proposal that has already received a fair amount of traction: a series of programs and public works projects, financial reform, and regional rebuilding that would all be funded by the government, akin to what some American politicians believe would be best for their own nation. This would ensure that the government would be able to create a responsible economy and one that would recover from the strains of what has essentially been anarchy until now."
 
 MAG_promote_democratic_ideals: "Promote Democratic Ideals"
 MAG_promote_democratic_ideals_desc: "One of the main struggles that we faced in the Far East we now face in Central Siberia. Simply put, the Russian people are, for the most part, completely and entirely unfamiliar with how democracy works. Thus, our administration needs to focus a significant amount of time on the promotion of the ideals that we espouse.\n\nDemocracy, liberty, and freedom for all Russians - that is what we envision - and that is what the populace must be led to believe in, to hope in. For if the people can get behind our message, there will be nothing stopping us from establishing a truly free, democratic Russian nation."
 
 MAG_reform_the_courts: "Reform the Courts"
 MAG_reform_the_courts_desc: "To say that the justice system under the tyrant Matkovsky was a farce would be too kind. It was more than a farce - a poorly written, hyperbolic work of fiction authored by an uneducated youth would provide a better framework for justice than the kangaroo courts the former Vozhd held. Justice was not objective - it was served and dispensed virtually directly from Matkovsky himself via parrot judges and puppet juries, who manipulated outcomes and rid the Vozhd of his opponents.\n\nThis has long been one of the darkest stains on the legacy of our party and has until this point held up our development of the future. We must ensure that a comprehensive reform of our justice system takes place to root out those that have done Matkovsky's bidding - the corrupt, the ideological, and the cowardly; these are the people who have no business judging whether the Russian citizen is guilty or not."
 
 MAG_drafting_a_constitution: "Drafting a Constitution"
 MAG_drafting_a_constitution_desc: "Despite the creation of the Siberian Bill of Rights years ago, the former administration under Mikhail Matkovsky continued to put off writing a constitution for the Russian people. Claiming that the people weren't ready for a document as progressive as a constitution, it was an obvious cover for Matkovsky's true intentions: tyranny and oppression, the submission of the people to his will and his will alone.\n\nThis was not acceptable when the former Vozhd was doing it then, and now that he is gone, it is certainly not acceptable now. It's time for a constitution. In fact, it's well past the time for a constitution. But now we have a chance to right Matkovsky's wrongs. We must draft one now that will form the foundation of our republic in the years to come."
 
 MAG_towards_freedom_and_unity: "Towards Freedom and Unity!"
 MAG_towards_freedom_and_unity_desc: "We've done lots to further the cause of democracy and freedom within the territory that we control. We've reformed the dark stains left by the legacy of the so-called "Vozhd", Matkovsky, ensuring that there is fair justice, a fair economy, and a fair constitution that will ensure the rights of the people and of democracy in the decades to come. We have worked to depoliticize the army, destroy the legacy of Matkovsky, and clean the heritage of our origins.\n\nMuch work still needs to be done. But we can, if just for a moment, take a rest, and admire what we've accomplished. We are on the road to establishing a free and democratic country - Russia will be liberated."

 MAG_the_vozhd_marches_on_desc: "Siberia has finally been unified under the banner of Vozhd Mikhail Matkovsky. No more skulking in frozen wastes as lapdogs for the Japanese, no more petty squabbling amongst exiles for who bears the title of Kolchak's heir.\n\nWhile we had to remove some undesirable elements along the way it is all for the best of causes, the unity of the Motherland. The Russian National Labor Party stands united in their loyalty to the Vozhd."

 MAG_altering_the_siberian_bill: "Altering the Siberian Bill"
 MAG_altering_the_siberian_bill_desc: "Nikolay Petlin was a troublemaker of a sort that could not be tolerated in this cruel world, a reformist full of ideas but with no common sense. Naturally he had to be eliminated, but that is not to say he must be wiped from memory. Many of his plans had the seed of a good idea within them, one that must be cultivated by a more experienced statesman to bear fruit.\n\nThe Siberian Bill was one of Petlin's better ideas, a new foundation for a great and powerful Russia to be built on. A few alterations to the bill and it will become a powerful statement, both to our own citizens and to observers from across the Pacific."

 MAG_immediate_universal_suffrage: "Immediate Universal Suffrage"
 MAG_immediate_universal_suffrage_desc: "Russia must catch up with the nations of the West if it is to hope for their aid. The right to vote is something not seen here since the Novgorod Republic, and then only to the nobles.\n\nThe people will be truly grateful when we grant universal suffrage not only to men but to women as well, and it will most certainly put our name in the papers over in America as a true ally of democracy."

 MAG_state_department_of_moral_decency: "State Department of Moral Decency"
 MAG_state_department_of_moral_decency_desc: "Ideas are a dangerous thing, and they must be controlled if Russia is not to fall into darkness once again. The Bolsheviks tore up Russian morals at the roots, permitting decadence, destroying the traditional family structure and even encouraging deviance.\n\nThe State Department of Moral Decency will ensure that all publications uphold the standards of the Russian people, not to mention including only appropriate political views. It would be an awful shame for anyone to be led astray."

 MAG_a_peace_preservation_law: "A Peace Preservation Law"
 MAG_a_peace_preservation_law_desc: "Whilst our state moves forwards in leaps and bounds, we must not let ourselves become dizzy with success. The right vote in the wrong place could be disastrous to our newly formed state, so we must ensure that the votes go to the right men.\n\nThe Peace Preservation Law will give us the state the right to veto candidates from the electoral register for the purposes of national safety. The Russian National Labor Party firmly believes in the system of one man, one vote. You get one vote, and one man to vote for."

 MAG_qualify_votes_and_districts: "Qualify Votes and Districts"
 MAG_qualify_votes_and_districts_desc: "The Far East is a vast place, so the issue of voting districts is a serious one. These districts are a powerful tool to assert control over this sparsely populated land.\n\nNon-Russian elements like the Sakha, Buryats and Mongols have been a thorn in our side for a while and will no doubt take the chance to cause a fuss when elections reach them. To this end, we must adjust the districts to ensure they remain a minority in these areas."

 MAG_the_ideological_quagmire: "The Ideological Quagmire"
 MAG_the_ideological_quagmire_desc: "Central Siberia is a mess. Communist warlords, anarchist armies and mad kings have ruled the region for decades, resulting in a political situation that can generously be described as insane.\n\nIn order to return the region to normalcy we will send out agents of the State Intelligence Agency to better determine how the ideological situation of the area has stabilised. Once we know what the people truly believe we can correct it, or at least isolate them that their ideas do not truly take hold."

 MAG_the_consciousness_of_law: "The Consciousness of Law"
 MAG_the_consciousness_of_law_desc: "Sometimes, parents must keep things from their children. Does the parent then allow the child to run rampant, throwing a tantrum and causing trouble? Of course not. It is for this same reason that we must keep things from our people, and we must not allow them to kick up a fuss about it. The right to speak your mind is not a right, but a precious gift, one that we must only be used with our blessing.\n\nKeeping protestors off the street is for their own good, and preventing them from saying hurtful things is just good parenting."

 MAG_integration_of_the_sibplan: "Integration of the Siberian Plan"
 MAG_integration_of_the_sibplan_desc: "While Bukharin's Soviet Union was a disaster for both Russia and the world, there is a silver lining to every cloud. His neglect towards Russia as a whole is balanced by his Siberian Plan, a comprehensive redevelopment of Siberian industry and an upgrade to the Trans-Siberian Railway, connecting the vast underdeveloped land like never before.\n\nWhilst we have completed our own infrastructure projects we have only recently pushed far west enough to truly integrate ourselves with this network."

 MAG_politically_conscious_politically_convenient: "Politically Conscious, Politically Convenient"
 MAG_politically_conscious_politically_convenient_desc: "Our efforts to perfect democracy have evidently paid off. The voting turnout has been impressively high in almost every district, with areas of low voting corresponding closely to areas with large non-Russian populations. The Russian National Labor Party has obtained an overwhelming majority in every district, due largely to there being no other available candidates.\n\nVozhd Mikhail Matkovsky has praised the Russian people for their newfound appreciation of democracy, and graciously accepted the mandate they have given him to continue his tenure as leader."

 MAG_no_partisanship_no_problem: "No Partisanship, No Problem"
 MAG_no_partisanship_no_problem_desc: "The Siberian National Republic has become a peaceful place with the institution of rational democracy. With no opposition to disturb the peace, there is no means for troublemakers to spread their destructive tendencies.\n\nThe sole means to electoral success is through the Russian National Labor Party, ensuring that anyone desiring votes must have their political views moderated by its cooling influence or find themselves struck from the ballot."

 MAG_keeping_up_appearances: "Keeping Up Appearances"
 MAG_keeping_up_appearances_desc: "Maintaining cordial relations with the Organization of Free Nations has been one of the central parts of our strategy. Whilst once we were but one of many warlords begging for their attention, now we hold dominance over one of the largest countries on the planet, and we cannot be ignored.\n\nThat we may one day be recognised as the sole legitimate Russian government, we must dedicate funds to establishing embassies in the nations of the OFN. The Americans will find it impossible not to give us their vote of confidence considering the other powers in Russia."

 MAG_a_reliable_partner: "A Reliable Partner"
 MAG_a_reliable_partner_desc: "Sure, the Siberian National Republic has its quirks, but it is in a deeply unique position. Certainly, there is less freedom of speech here than in America, but what country can't say that? Indeed, ethnic minorities may have a less than desirable position, but that is true of the USA as well. And yes, the Vozhd may be closer to a dictator than to a President, but he is a benevolent dictator, a true Cincinnatus.\n\nWe may be flawed, but above all we are reliable. We desire nothing more than to be a true good neighbour, and will go to any lengths to prove that to our American brothers."

 MAG_with_us_or_against_us: "With Us or Against Us"
 MAG_with_us_or_against_us_desc: "While we want nothing more to be a good neighbour and to establish a good working relationship with our allies, we will not be pushed around. We aren't some petty warlord state anymore, but a true nation, with vast resources, a mighty army, and national pride. While we may work with foreigners we certainly do not rely on them, and we are more than willing to walk away from the negotiating table if we are being fleeced - so they'd better learn to work with us."

 MAG_sensible_concessions: "Sensible Concessions"
 MAG_sensible_concessions_desc: "The OFN always have their demands for some minor thing or another, and whilst it may be against our immediate interests at home it behooves us to succumb to their pushes every once in a while. There is no sense letting them dictate the pace of our reforms entirely however - this is why we have a list.\n\nIndeed a portion of our time is spent searching for reforms we don't particularly care about that we can throw at the OFN as a paper shield. If we make enough small changes they won't bother to demand any big ones, and we can appear to be the progressive New Russia.\n\nAll for a good cause."

 MAG_protecting_corporate_interests: "Protecting Corporate Interests"
 MAG_protecting_corporate_interests_desc: "Business is the lifeblood of the state, and we must do all we can to ensure business goes smoothly. The vast lands of Siberia and the Far East are painfully underexploited due to their vast size and small population, so we must do all we can to smooth the path towards profit. The easier it is to do business here the more businessmen we will attract, and the more businesses that become embedded here the further we ingratiate ourselves with the OFN.\n\nTo attract business we must ensure that the rights of the people do not come before their own interests."

 MAG_an_army_to_be_proud_of: "An Army to Be Proud Of"
 MAG_an_army_to_be_proud_of_desc: "Our army has come far. Once we were little more than gangsters enforcing our will onto the streets of Harbin, then paramilitary thugs doing the same in Magadan. We have had to adapt to survive, first innovating in the small unit tactics that allowed us to take towns and villages, then being forced to develop our own division level strategies when conflict arose with Rodzaevsky's dogs.\n\nUnity in the East was only the beginning though, for when we marched west we had to adapt to full-scale war on a massive front. In but a single decade we have developed an army almost on par with that of the West.\n\nAll it takes is a bit of polishing before we are ready for the final reclamation."

 MAG_the_struggle_for_the_national_russia: "The Struggle for the National Russia"
 MAG_the_struggle_for_the_national_russia_desc: "The way has been long and hard, but after all this time the Vozhd has solidified his grip on the National Republic. From a dream in the slums of Harbin to a reality of one of the largest nations on Earth, we are only a step away from the total reunification of Russia, from undoing the last twenty years of humiliation.\n\nAll that remains is to prepare ourselves for the final struggle."

 MAG.1.t: "The Last of the True"
 MAG.1.desc: "Matkovsky steadied his glasses against his nose, peering down at a piece of paper with rows and rows of names written all over it. A list of Rodzaevsky's suspected loyalists. He looked up to discover a room packed to the brim with books from his White Army days, old decaying American newspapers, and in the far corner, shrouded in the dark, an old gramophone gathering rust and dust. The sight of the thing brought a smirk to Matkovsky's face: the old Harbin building, the dances and the parties, and above all of it, the electric swastika, promising another future for the Russians stranded there.\n\nThe doorbell rang, shaking Matkovsky from his reverie. Two gruff men, dressed in the party uniform, entered. In his small and messy room, they stood out as an oddity, almost barbaric even. Their feet thumped loudly on the wooden floors as they attempted clumsy salutes. One lean, with breezes of blonde hair peeking beneath the party cap. The other stocky, with the bulge of his stomach plain to the eye.\n\nAfter a few moments of awkward silence, Matkovsky stared at them, before finally saying, "Well?" With trembling voices, they gave him the names of the people they had purged today. Matkovsky gave them a generous smile. "Thank you. You may go." When he heard the door knob latch itself closed, he turned back to his list. Sergei A., Bruno B., Nikolas C. He crossed them out, dabbing the names in thick black ink, snuffing them out forever from the history of the Russian Fascist Party. Balancing his glass of whiskey in his hands, Matkovsky looked at his reflection against the murky liquid before taking a sip.\n\nThe hours went by. The doorbell rang, and the men came and did their salutes, telling him of the names disappearing from the list. Sometimes, when the wind was right, he could hear the crack of rifle fire, somewhere deep in the woods. It was nighttime by the time he finished the list. He gently pushed the men out, thanking them for a job well done. After they left, he bolted the door behind them. Turning to his gramophone, he decided that he would dance to the memories of Harbin. He turned it on and let the good times roll."
 MAG.1.a: "The Vozhd has a lot of work to do."
 
 MAG.2.t: "Magadan Free Radio - Broadcast 1"
 MAG.2.desc: "The broadcast started wrong. Before the talk show began, the Magadan Free Radio played a sequence of songs plagued by crackling audio. The inexperienced crews of the MFR, fascists unused to any other work than thuggery, had mixed the sound with too much bass and mistakenly placed the treble dial.\n\nThe audio cuts. A thump. Two thumps. "Is this thing on?" a coarse voice said, his lips smacking too close against the microphone, "Oh, it is!"\n\nAnother voice, a smooth baritone, said from a far corner of the room "We're live, what the hell are you saying?" Trembling on the table, as the voice closed in. Three taps on the table. "Follow the script." An awkward pause. "Did you forget to disconnect the microphone? Did you?" A sigh. "This is such a fucking disaster." An electric discharge sounded as the mic was unplugged. The badly mastered songs continued, rattling the first broadcast of the MFR.\n\nThe audio cuts out, again. The coarse voice returned, still a little too close to the mic, "Hello, fellow Russians in the Far East. Welcome to the very first broadcast of Magadan Free Radio." Lip-smacking. "My name is Sergei, I'm the host of the radio tonight, alongside with my friend, Vasi..." Sergei's voice trailed off. A few moments later, he shouted into the mic, likely blowing out a few eardrums, "Vasily!"\n\nVasily took his seat, audibly. With a little sigh, he began, "Yes, with my friend Sergei here, we shall accompany you through many, many cold Siberian nights in the future." An affected cheer. "For now, we'd like to thank Mr. Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the RFP, for sponsoring this program." An awkward silence, as the clocks ticked in the background. "For now, let's proceed with the music."\n\nJust before the audio turned on again, the smooth baritone said, "What the fuck is wrong with yo-""
 MAG.2.a: "What a way to make a first impression."
 
 MAG.3.t: "The Pretender"
 MAG.3.desc: ""To the Honorable Claimant to the Throne of Russia," the letter read so far, "we have come to beseech you for your aid against our mutual enemy, the traitor Konstantin Rodzaevsky." No, the letter ought not to be so direct. Putting down his pen, Matkovsky laid his hand across his face and sighed. Leaning his forearm against the table and propping his head against his open palm, he stared at the page, waiting to be filled with his writing. His tea sat right below him, its smell tempting him. Matkovsky tapped his feet. He has no time for that now.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, Matkovsky found himself adjusting his glasses, his fingers rapping the table in sequence. A thousand questions swarmed his mind. What if the Tsarists reject the treaty? What if they find the terms unacceptable? He shuddered to think of what would happen if both sides did not cooperate against Rodzaevsky. Someone knocked on the door. Rather than answering, Matkovsky's index finger mimicked the rhythm on his table.\n\nStanding from his seat, he said aloud, "The letter is not ready yet. Go away." The knockings stopped. He looked at the letter. Clapping his hands together and drawing a deep breath, he sat down, toying with the pen as he thought of what to say to Mikhail.\n\n"We appeal in the name of our old friendship," he scribbled without much thought, "in the Anti-Bolshevik Front. As we all know..." He found his hands picking up speed. Before long, he would stand and say:"
 MAG.3.a: ""The letter is ready. Come in.""
 
 MAG.4.t: "Saboteurs Strike!"
 MAG.4.desc: "There is an alarming trend growing on our borders. The traitors in Magadan seem to have struck a deal with the Tsarists in Chita. A temporary truce? An alliance, even? The minds of Mikhail and Matkovsky are foggy and unclear as ever.\n\nThis morning, our forward observers have found our border guards dead, and their weapons missing. This incident is hardly isolated. The intensifying raids coming from both sides of the border, as well as the destruction of valuable remnants of Soviet roads and rail, have become more and more frequent. Our forces are stretched thin, barely enough to cover one side of the front. When the Tsarists attack, the traitors join them, forcing us to expend our resources in two directions. We inevitably lose some in the process: whether it is men, weapons, or plain loot.\n\nRodzaevsky sits in his office, pondering what to do next. This pact has marked a turning point in the relationship between the three components of the Anti-Bolshevik Front. One can only wonder what fate awaits them next. Will the Tsarists and the traitors win against the divinely-sanctioned Vozhd of Russia or truth triumph against treachery? Only time will tell."
 MAG.4.a: "And we wait patiently."
 
 MAG.5.t: "The Man in the White House"
 MAG.5.desc: "Nikolay Petlin adjusted his tie. A mental tick, something he learned a long time ago in the RFP. Looking over his desk, he ruminated on the task Matkovsky had assigned to him. A typewriter, surrounded by rolls and rolls of ink, practically a luxury. Petlin could not imagine writing those letters and appeals by hand. He had spent long hours in this office, and his fingers twitched as he prepared himself to type again. His assistants could only do so much; none spoke English, and to ask Matkovsky for aid would overstep propriety.\n\nHe sighed. He remembered the words Matkovsky told him. "Convince the man in the White House," his master had said, staring into Petlin's eyes without flinching, "That is all." Matkovsky did not like being taken lightly. At the best of times, Petlin could see the old Harbin spirit in him, a spirit of hope, of kindling, of a prayer for a new home. The winter had extracted its toll upon the man, and the gaunt, flushed cheeks were but symptoms of the payment.\n\nHe looked beneath his desk. Stacks upon stacks of paper, numbering almost in the thousands. Soon, upon the completion of his task, these would be sent to America, finding themselves in the mailboxes of Senators, Representatives, Russian émigrés, and other assorted people who were receptive to Matkovsky's project. On top of the furthest stack, lay a folder, bound in manilla yellow. Plastered to the front of it was a label that read: "The Siberian Bill of Rights." The document contained Petlin's personal ideas to solicit more aid, or at least sympathy from Americans. He wondered if Matkovsky knew what his real sympathies were.\n\nHe shook his head. Now was not the time for the mind to wander. He laid his fingers upon the keys of the typewriter, and the clacking began."

 MAG.6.t: "The Count of Fascism"
 MAG.6.desc: ""Zdarova, brother Matkovsky!" A man hailed from the piers of the harbor. A lean body and a pale face, with a hand stretching out in the early morning air, waving to Matkovsky. Anastasy Vonsiatsky, also known as the Count of Russian Fascism, had set foot on the port of Magadan. He strode forward, his steps eager and his gait quick, impatient to meet his so-called equal in the old world. Covering his nose once he discovered the smell of the docks, he looked small, pathetic against the backdrop of wooden fishing ships about to depart into the morning light.\n\nMatkovsky furrowed his eyebrows. No one in this world currently has the right to address him in such a way. Giving an awkward, pained smile towards Vonsiatsky, he and his bodyguards walked forward to meet this Count. Extending his hand, a gesture of hospitality, Matkovsky said, "Zdrastvuyte. How has America treated you?"\n\nVonsiatsky wasted no breath in clasping Matkovsky's open palms. "Great, brother." He leaned forward, planning to catch Matkovsky in a hug. Matkovsky relented. America must have changed Vonsiatsky. The intimate gestures, the overenthusiastic, unreserved spirit, and that greeting: it was all a bit much, coming from a fellow Russian. Still drunk in that spirit, Vonsiatsky said aloud, "It is the land of the free. All this," he gestured with his hand, "Is too small for us."\n\n"You seem to forget the reason you are here, brother." Matkovsky said, a hint of coldness in his voice.\n\n"No, no." He dipped his hands in his pocket. "This man is a gift from me to you." He showed Matkovsky a black and white photograph of an American in a beret."

 MAG.7.t: "The Wizard of Whispering Death"
 MAG.7.desc: "A light curtain of drizzle had descended upon the port of Magadan. The clouds adorned their bodies with steely grey, and the waters of the harbor tugged and pushed their way inland, their course halted the low-lying sea walls. Amid the piers, rows upon rows of wooden fishing ships lay steady, their hulls quivering in the fierce wind, shallow rain, and restive waves. There was one vessel that stood out among the others, a metal deck, with rust coating its bows. The tumultuous air did not even seem to flinch it.\n\nMatkovsky, followed by an aide bearing an umbrella to shield him from the downpour, walked forward to this strange vessel. If Vonsiatsky had been speaking the truth, then there was no question to the owner of this ship. Mitchell WerBell, legendary mercenary, the veteran of a thousand wars worldwide, an infamous soldier of fortune, the Wizard of Whispering Death. Matkovsky steeled himself to meet this legend of a man, before seeing a figure stumbling out of the ship, staggering towards him.\n\nMatkovsky blinked. There was no mistaking it. The figure was WerBell, looking more green than in the photographs Matkovsky had seen of him, a beret hanging precariously on his scalp. Matkovsky tightened his pace, striding forward at such a pace that his aide had difficulty in following him. When he came face to face with WerBell, the man tried to give a clumsy smile, only for it to be mistaken for contempt.\n\n"Welcome," Matkovsky said, in English, "We have been expecting you, Mr. WerBell."\n\n"Privet," WerBell said, "My tovarisch." He continued in Russian, mixing it with English words when he had no clue which words to use. Matkovsky, for his part, tried to dissuade him from bastardizing the Russian language, and occasionally a word or two made it through WerBell's manners, but he was inconsolable. What little correct Russian he spoke was sprinkled with generous helpings of "fucking" and "shit." Blushing furiously in anger and embarrassment, Matkovsky finally extended his hand.\n\n"Here's," Matkovsky said, trying to keep his smile in place, "to the start of a beautiful friendship." WerBell clasped his hand with neither doubt nor comprehension."

The Vozhd is waiting for you!"\n\n"It's no use, Dmitry," Ivan said, sighing and catching his breath, "I've been at this door for hours, and I haven't gotten any answers yet."\n\nTime to try something else, Dmitry thought. Kneeling, he stared at the keyhole of the doorknob. He could do this. Taking out a lockpick from his pockets, Dmitry gingerly inserted it, working as to leave the machinations inside undisturbed and unharmed. The door had to open somehow, and jamming the keyhole would only make it harder for everyone. Might even require an ax: he chuckled. Ivan was about to protest, several times, in fact. They could've just asked for a spare key, but Dmitry wouldn't hear of it.\n\nThe door clicked. Dmitry stood, containing his jump at the very last moment. "See?" He said to Ivan, who gave a dry smile in response. Dmitry turned the knob, but the door wouldn't budge. "Bolted from the inside, goddamnit!" He kicked the door in a fit of rage. Ivan tapped his shoulder, gesturing for him to move. Brandishing an ax, he swung it several times against the door, as bits and pieces of wood fly in every direction. At the very last moment, when Ivan was about to give up, the door gave way.\n\n"Mr. Vonsiatsky, are you not we-" Ivan stopped mid-sentence, laying on the floor and clutching his chest was Vonsiatsky, his eyes glassy, his face pale. He was dead.\n\nSometime in the evening, the phone in Matkovsky's office rang."

 MAG.9.t: "The Mercenary Coup"
 MAG.9.desc: "Ivan and Boris did not like their new assignment. Transferred from the political wing of the RFP to the army right before the eve of the operation, they were, as their instructor put it, "dead weight." An officer handed them their bolt-action rifles and told them to stick with the rear guard, where the chance of survival was the highest. There was no danger here, and the Siberian woods were quiet, the wind whistling between the trees and the air cold as ever.\n\n"You think the Vozhd will let us back?" Boris asked Ivan, who was squatting beside him, watching the surroundings while smoking a flimsy cigarette. The only reply he got was a listless shake of the head and a hush. Ivan knew his stuff or at least showed that he wasn't in over his head. The hand that gripped the cig shook. It could be the air, could be genuine anxiety and terror in the face of war.\n\nA figure passed ahead, in the dirt trails they were watching: a mercenary. It was apparent from the gear they carried. Proper camouflage, an assault rifle, a belt chock-full of grenades as well as other miscellaneous tools of warfare, and, most importantly, the attitude. The man walked forward without any concern or worry, his footsteps lighter than the bravest man in the RFP. However, he had no reason to be here. The front lines were where he belonged, not here.\n\n"Halt!" Boris said, unslinging in his rifle and pointing it at the mercenary, who did likewise. Ivan followed suit. "Turn back. The frontlines are over there."\n\nThe mercenary said nothing and shot at Boris. It hit, and Boris was thrown off his feet. Ivan fired back, nailing the mercenary in the shoulder.\n\nAll over the lines, incidents like these flared up, and the operation was called off in a panic. WerBell's coup had begun."

 MAG.10.t: "The Treaty of Cooperation"
 MAG.10.desc: ""Here is the treaty that the Tsarists sent," Petlin said, placing the draft of the agreement on the table, "sir." He almost adjusted his tie again, before the stern stare of the Vozhd stopped his left hand. Yet those eyes did not judge Petlin's mannerisms in any detail. They went up and down the document, examining its fine print, looking for chinks in the deal that the Tsarists - or the RFP, for that matter - could exploit. No word on it seemed to raise any reaction from Matkovsky beyond an occasional rise of the eyebrows and a nod.\n\nPutting the document aside, Matkovsky turned to address his foreign minister. "Petlin," he said, chilling every bone in the minister's body. He gulped. It was the moment of truth, where the Vozhd would deliver his final verdict. "Good work," Matkovsky said after a few moments, "you exceeded my personal expectations. Before I sign this," he picked up his pen, toying with it, "is there anything else you'd like to add?"\n\nPetlin drew a deep breath. "No," he said, "There is none." Matkovsky's hand promptly drew a signature on the document.\n\n"It is done." He dropped the pen and rose. "Deliver this to the representative of the Tsarists and tell him that the Vozhd accepts the deal, and death to Rodzaevsky." Standing in front of Petlin, he offered his hand. "I appreciate that I have at least one competent person in charge of affairs around here." A smile, a rare thing for Matkovsky to show.\n\nPetlin shook his hand. "Yes, sir. I will do as you say. Your compliments are high praise for my blood and station, sir."\n\nMatkovsky patted his shoulder. "All in a day's work." Petlin turned and left where he came in."

Before the communication could proceed, however, he ordered all of his men out of the room, preferring to be alone. While the matter was not confidential, he wanted to keep everything private. Tonight was a special night, a time to talk with an old friend. So long as she also held to her schedule, that is. Ten seconds out. WerBell rubbed his hands against his temples. This Siberian business was hard, and Matkovsky was proving himself to be no pushover. WerBell smirked; the damned bastard would have his due.\n\nFingers on the dial, two seconds out. When it reached ten o'clock, his right hand snapped, finding the frequency that she used, locking on to it without difficulty. He reached for the microphone and spoke at it. "White Mouse," he said, waiting expectantly for a reply, "are you there?"\n\n"You're late," a kindly, maternal voice replied, "Maybe age has slowed you down a bit after all." She laughed. WerBell smiled. On the other side was the White Mouse, One of the Brits who had the backbone to fight in a war and be good at it, and a comrade during all those times where the Americans lost the torch of liberty before falling down a set of stairs to disgrace. "Good to see you, Wizard." He saw her firm, proud smile beyond the radio waves.\n\n"Likewise, Mouse," WerBell said, kicking back in his seat, the microphone standing precariously on his chest, "How is Kamchatka? Is it a shithole too?"\n\nHe felt her frowning at him. "Language, wizard," she said, sighing, "But yes, there is not much to do around here."\n\n"Still looking up to Uncle Sam?"\n\n"You know it," she said, "I know you've gone indie and all, but the OS-, no, the CIA has a proposition for you."\n\n"Forget it," He said, fuming. Make no mistake, he liked Nixon - only a good American could bring America back together, and not those cowardly liberals with their talk of "peace, land, and bread." Fucking communists. He just couldn't let go. "I still remember the last time I worked for those no-good bast-"\n\nThe White Mouse hushed him. "We also have taken your concerns to mind." She spelled her plans out for him. His eyes widened.\n\n"Hell of a plan," WerBell said, laughing, "You mad bastards.""

 MAG.12.t: "Magadan Free Radio - Broadcast 45"
 MAG.12.desc: "The Siberian hunters sat around a table. On it was a radio, an American brand, powered by batteries instead of regular electricity. They had bought this from an admittedly sketchy merchant selling American goods in the port of Magadan. Still, the surface of the thing was shining with polish, a particularly American brand of burnishing that made cheap things look luxurious. They turned the dial to Magadan Free Radio, whose frequency they had scribbled onto a piece of paper earlier.\n\nThe mix was better this time. As usual, they played Russian patriotic songs, with the Siberian hunters singing and humming along to the melody, despite having no idea as to what the lyrics were. Instead of cutting entirely, the radio quieted as the talk show began.\n\n"Welcome to Magadan Free Radio!" A coarse voice, with some lip-smacking but not as much as before. "Your only source of news in the Far East! I'm here with my co-host, Vasily!"\n\n"Hello." A smooth baritone, with some genuine cheer in how he talked now. "Tonight is another cold Siberian night, but rest assured, the MFR will go nowhere. What is our subject tonight, Sergei?"\n\n"I hold in my hand a genuinely genius American invention, Mr. Vasily. A deodorant! Truly magnificent." Sergei uncapped the deodorant, making sure to be as audible as possible. Pop. "Smell that, Mr. Vasily?"\n\n"Hmmm. And what does it do, Sergei?"\n\n"It is just the thing! It blocks body odor!" Sergei stopped as if applying it over his skin. "This deodorant, imported from America, should fit all you Siberian savages out there in the woods." The room was silent. "Mr. Vasily, why are you staring at me like tha-""

 MAG.13.desc: "Today is the fifth day of Oleg's survival training. The sky was dark, and the woods stretched into what seemed like infinity. In front of him were remnants of a campfire, and the results from the hunt last night: two foxes and a rabbit. Waking up to greet the new day, he lifted his sidearm and looked over it, balancing it in his hands as he did so. Apart from some dirt stains, it was clean. He pressed the magazine release, and then pulled the slide back. A cartridge flew into the air with a faint ping. All the bullets were there.\n\nSo far, Oleg did not have to use his gun on anything. No bear nor leopard even came close to him, although he did see them in the wild. The foxes, rabbits, and other assorted animals he hunted were the results of his traps. Using the gun on them would ruin their flavor and make them possibly unsafe to eat. To survive, Oleg learned, one must be ready to not only exercise force, but also restraint.\n\nHe picked up the stray bullet and shoved it back into its magazine. Time for his daily ritual. Setting himself down, Oleg began taking apart his gun. Setting the parts down on dried rabbit fur, he took out his canteen, and started cleaning the parts delicately. After each piece was free of grime and dust, he rubbed them on the fur, making sure they were dry. With icy fingers, he assembled the gun. To see if anything was wrong, he slid the magazine back and cocked the action. A snap. Oleg smiled. Today was a good day too.\n\nThe Siberian Rangers would come back for him, any day now."

 MAG.14.t: "The End of the Bandit King"
 MAG.14.desc: "Rodzaevsky stepped out into the harsh morning air, dressed in rags. Two RFP guards trailed him, rifles trained on his heart and head should he try and make a run for it. They shouldn't have bothered. On his face, the fire that had burned bright during the darkest moments of the RFP in Harbin was naught but cold embers. His hands and legs chained, he hobbled forward, dragging his feet and maintaining a precarious balance and momentum.\n\nAt their front was a makeshift gallows, constructed with the sole intent of executing the former chief leader of the RFP. The Bandit King of Amur, as he was known, now walked like the poorest beggar in the Far East, towards his impending death. Three men patrolled the site on Matkovsky's orders, making sure the execution was as private as possible. For all he had done, Rodzaevsky was still a former member of the RFP, a party that takes care of its own.\n\n"Stop right there," a guard said, right beneath the stairs to his doom, "I have something to ask." Rodzaevsky suppressed the urge to giggle at this man; what can a dying man say in the face of his fate? He nodded. "What did the Vozhd say to you last night?" All eyes were now on Rodzaevsky, every ear tuned to hear what he had to say.\n\n"Nothing much," Rodzaevsky said, sotto voce, "can we get this over already?" He intended to carry what Matkovsky said to his grave. The guards brought him to the rope, then placed it around his neck. They made him stand on a stool, before aiming their rifles at him again, prepared for a last, desperate escape attempt.\n\nThere was no need. In a few moments, a guard kicked the stool from beneath him."

 MAG.15.desc: "Ivan carried Boris on his back. He wasn't a doctor, and he did not know whether the gunshot broke a bone, shattered a vein, or hit a vital organ. Boris was probably safe; the mercenary tagged him in his shoulders. So far, using vodka, scraps of clothing, and the bandages he found on the merc's body, Ivan had managed to staunch the bleeding, the blood gathering in dark red clots beneath the bandage's white veneer. Boris moaned every time they went up and down crossing the rough Siberian terrain, but his ragged breathing and delirious groans meant that one thing was clear: he was alive.\n\nAll the way, from the lines back to the camp, Ivan screamed until his throat was sore, "Medic! MEDIC!" Yet, the grounds were silent, and the trees and bushes did not accept nor condemn his call for help. Boris was growing heavier by the minute, his weight settling into Ivan's shoulders like a cross. His breath became shorter and shorter, as the woods refuse to part way and yield to the camp.\n\nNot far now, Ivan thought, for every step he took. Not far. Every rock, fallen branch, and mound of soil endeared themselves to his eyes and feet, as he slowed down. He was close to fainting. He took his knife out and tried to prick his thumb lightly; his touch was less than gentle, and in his panic, he slashed his hand. The wound was not deep, just enough to keep him awake. He bandaged his hands, taking a slower and measured pace.\n\nIn half an hour, he reached the camp, finding it empty and deserted. Night had descended. The medical staff had fled, along with most of the troops. Had he been faster, had he been quicker, he could have saved Boris. He laid his friend down on the ground, and held his hand, as Boris's breath faded, fainter and fainter. He tried. He really did. Fate had not given leave for Boris to survive.\n\nLuck did, however. A truck horn sounded, and in their headlights was Ivan, holding his friend's hand and his tears at bay. He could not believe it. Gathering his will, he said, in a shaken and torn voice, "Friend or foe? Russian or mercenary?"\n\n"Friend," came the reply, "Russian. You are safe now. The Vozhd awaits in Magadan. Get in the truck.""

He did not sleep at all last night, right after they delivered his verdict. He cracked his fingers through cuffed hands. They were taking him deep into the woods of Siberia, in the middle of nowhere, far from civilization. He felt his body twitch all over. The withdrawal was encroaching on his mind, and an uneasy cold settled over his bones.\n\nThe men tasked with escorting him spoke foreign, faraway languages that he did not know even the slightest. All they did was use the muzzles of their rifles to poke Rodzaevsky forward whenever it seemed that he was close to stopping. He knew that someone in the group spoke Russian; he didn't know which was which. The air grew hotter and hotter, swaddling his body with a thin curtain of sweat.\n\nHis mind wandered to strange places. He wondered about Matkovsky. They said they had never found a body. Rodzaevsky knew Matkovsky and his sly wit. Siberia was vast and empty. It would take a lot of sentries spread across a general direction to eventually find him. Devil, devil! Matkovsky was his worthy opponent: a fellow Russian who contended for power, not a mercenary out for money.\n\nThey reached a clearing in the middle of the woods. One of them, the Russian speaker, went behind Rodzaevsky and blindfolded his eyes. It seemed like even the mercenaries had a touch of humanity. As his sight failed, he heard footsteps trail behind him, and rifles pointed in his direction ready to fire a single shot that would end his life. A voice gave a signal and the enfilade started. Rodzaevsky fell, lifeless, onto the ground."

Their equipment was in a similarly poor state, with most "soldiers" equipped with creaking, almost non-functional rifles like old Arisaka models and Mosin-Nagants dating back to the days of the Great War. A good fit for an army of wax models in a museum, perhaps, but not enough for a host with the intent to fight, as the Vozhd (Russian leader) humbly put it, "a total crusade to save Russia."\n\nWe commenced training as soon as we pinned down the RFP's situation. That is where we encountered another problem: the nepotism ingrained within the "officer corps" of the RFP was so prevalent that men who could barely hold the weight of a rifle bore such high ranks as Lieutenant, Captain, or even Major. Pressed on the issue, the Vozhd agreed to fire these people immediately, much to his credit. He also approved the building of several officer schools to whip up the higher ranks of his army into shape.\n\nThe reports we have received from the frontlines indicate good results. The border clashes against their neighbors have indicated a good increase in performance, regardless of victory and defeat. We will continue to monitor the situation and issue reports whenever possible. Mason out."

 MAG.18.t: "Soldaty bez Granits"
 MAG.18.desc: "From the outset, WerBell's goons were different from the regulars of the RFP militias. In Magadan, they walked around town, their expensive gear strapped to their bodies, flirting with the girls and ladies they saw along the way. They seemed not to have a care for Russia; it was just another playground for them, a vacation, a holiday in a desolate land where they got to shoot the natives. Smith (no given last name), in particular, came from South Africa, his hands itching for the trigger of the gun, his ears for the thrill of gunfire, his head and brain for the conduct and raw barbarity of combat.\n\nWerBell wasn't lying when he said that his gear was going to be good. His M16, strapped to his back, was the meanest piece of lead spitter this side of Russia. The RFP militias did not have them, only given old US M1 Garands instead, for they were not Smith. The fields, savannahs, plains, and jungles of Africa made themselves known through his copper, sun-burnt skin. He had all the reason in the world to be cocky. When his folks back home ask him why he had gone into the business, "To find a lady," came the answer. All who truly understood Smith knew that he wasn't in it for love, but the thrill of war and money.\n\nHe could see the Russians eyeing his gear with envy in their eyes. He smirked at them and winked. Every time he smoked, they would marvel at his tidy, clean, well-rolled cigarettes. Once in a while, he even offered them one. Warfare was a trade, and business was good. Leaning back against a wall in a random part of the podunk town, he took one of his fabulous cigarettes out and lit one.\n\nFor a backwater and deserted place, Magadan was pretty good. Not on the level of Bloemfontein, but pleasant enough. However, his heart was never there. Out west, closer to lines of the Tsarists and Rodzaevsky's loyalists, beneath the blazing gunfire and artillery bombardments, was where he belonged. With a puff of smoke, he threw the cigarette down and stepped on it. It was time for action."

An alien object nestled itself in his left shoulder, refusing all attempts to move it. The pain kept on giving, a radiant sun that bled an unfading, persistent coppery smell. He had the faintest idea of what happened to him, its images surfacing along with the shocks of pain that sent him receding towards the depths of unconsciousness. He was expecting for Ivan to leave him for dead, and make for the lines in all haste - their reassignment was the fault of his pride after all - but he felt himself tumble and shake, but never falling.\n\nSay what you would about Ivan: quiet, brutish, stupid, but he was a good friend. Dmitry's blood-stained and pain-wracked mind squeezed skepticism of Ivan's efforts, but his heart begged him to hope. It implored with every beat, refusing to let itself die. It grew fainter and fainter, as the hours passed by, but it dragged its death out. Instinct, not intellect, became the lifeline upon which Dmitry hung himself. His grasp was tenuous, and at every turn of the forest trail, through every bush that Ivan's feet trudged through, he would not let go.\n\nAt long last, Ivan's feet gave. He collapsed, sending Dmitry tumbling through the ground, with dirt and rocks striking his face and body. He felt his wound open, as the bandages that held him together tore itself apart. Sound, noises, voices. Footsteps through the ground, noises of guns, voices of gruff men in foreign languages cloud his ephemeral mind. As he passed out from this world to the next, he heard gunfire and saw muzzle flashes out of the corner of his eye. In his final moments, he smiled; Ivan was not going quietly.

Rodzaevsky was dead, with his madness buried six-feet deep in the ground along with his body. All over the former RFP stronghold of Magadan, partying had begun. Soldiers and local talents alike mingled with the crowd, and alcohol flowed freely from the pubs to the offices of the commanders. WerBell drank his fill, and he gulped it deeply. He had won, and to the victor goes the spoils. Or the swills, in his case.\n\nIn the next room over, the rest of his officers convened, their voices like indistinct bangs and thuds against the wooden wall. Sometimes he could hear a word or two emerge from the discussion, but his whiskey-addled mind soaked every last bit with liquor, and every phrase slid drowsily into his brain. No matter. He could trust his officers; they were loyal to more than their paycheck. If it had been the regular bread-and-butter mercenaries, he would have howled at them and shot his revolver all over the room.\n\nHe looked at the tea-colored substance lying in wait in the shot glass on the table, inviting him to take it for a single sip. Maybe he can. Maybe not. Better not to take the risk. Tonight was a fateful night. His neighbors were making history.\n\nThe door creaked open. "Sir?" One of his officers said, "We have an important question."\n\n"Spit it out already," WerBell said, growing impatient, "This whiskey's mighty tempting."\n\n"We have nailed the specific nature of the... Republic, sir. There is only one question left, and I think you should answer it. It's about the name."\n\nWerBell stood up, his hands poised for a theatrical and grandiose display. He said, almost at the top of his lungs, "We're west from Alaska," toppling from his feet, catching himself up in the last second, "West ALASKA!"\n\nThe officer blinked at him.

He had never taken the Bandit King of the Far East to be such a meticulous and attentive person. He looked around the room. Alcohol, drugs, coffee, every substance of comfort crowded the lone desk perched on the far end of the room, in front of the open windows. The afternoon sun's faint light filtered into the room, and the glasses of Rodzaevsky's excess glimmered like gems against the backdrop of the steel-gray sky.\n\nCovering his nose through the rank smell, he reached a drawer and pulled a file out. M section, Matkovsky, Mikhail. His photo, young and handsome, graced the file. Its pages were surprisingly clean, tidily typed. At first glance, it could pass for a well-written letter. The contents and notes of it stood in contrast to its exterior. Long, run-on sentences cursed Matkovsky, and a phrase drew his eye: "Kosher Fascist." Matkovsky smiled. Never change, old friend, never change.\n\nAll that remained, then, was to compile a list. Though most of the RFP were Russians, Matkovsky's wing of the party could not accept Rodzaevsky's without some adjustments. Some would follow the fate of their master. Some would be free to find their fortunes in the wastes of Siberia. Some would be the RFP's prodigious children, wayward sons of Russia who lost their way. All would serve Matkovsky.

Petlin, the man he considered to be almost a brother to himself, his own foreign minister! He stared into Petlin's eyes, finding fear and obedience settling their weight into his psyche. Maybe this was not intentional after all.\n\n"Sir, if I may explain myself," Petlin said, freezing his hand before it could correct his tie, "The Americans are different from us. We need to-"\n\n"I get your point, Petlin, it's just," Matkovsky said, waving off Petlin, "This is not what I - not we - stand for. When I read your document I found phrases like the 'right to assembly', 'right to free speech.' These are all dangerous ideas, not fit for Russia. Their rebellious intent practically jumps off the pages." Matkovsky sighed, "Just what the hell were you thinking, brother?"\n\nPetlin gathered himself and stood straighter. "Sir, if I may insist, my ideas can still be useful. Not only in convincing the Americans but the Russians as well." He cracked his knuckles in anxiety. "I have faith in the strength of our ideals and conviction, sir, I do. I beg you not to mistake my incompetence as rebelliousness."\n\nMatkovsky felt a rare moment of generosity, stretching his arms wide. "Petlin, Petlin," he said, tapping his foreign minister on the shoulders, "I would never. You have been with us since the beginning, closer to me than even my chancellor." He whispered to Petlin, "Now help me with all these, I am afraid that your brother lacks the skill necessary to convince the Americans."\n\n"Y-yes," Petlin said, his voice trembling, "I will do as you say."\n\n"Good. Now, cut back. We can't afford all of this. Make holes and loop them. Dismissed." Petlin left the room in a great hurry."

Even though he was an American agent, trained in both formal and spoken Russian, he had never conversed in any depth with the soldiers, much less giving instruction and introduction to American weapons. He smirked. There was an irony to it all: despite having been schooled and educated in one of the most renowned countries on Earth, Mason was as out of his depth as the illiterate Russian fascists standing before him. The cold, chilly air of the early morning gave his percussive heartbeat a tinge of anxiety and excitement in his veins. The training fields were empty save for a few animals scurrying underfoot.\n\nAn officer prefaced him. "From the honorable nation of America," he goes, "Mason has come..." A bunch of feel-good bromides and legalese, but he guessed that the soldiers needed to respect him first before they would be willing to listen to him. He caught a few of them eyeing the equipment he brought here. Mason didn't think it was all that impressive, considering the things he had seen while working in the agency, but, again, cultural and technological differences.\n\nAfter a few hour-long and anxiety-ridden minutes, it was finally his turn to speak. He drew back his tongue and lashed it out, throwing the dust off the language he seldom used. "Hello," he said, "as the officer has said, my name is Mason." He grabbed an M1 Garand and held it against his shoulders. "This is the Garand. You." He pointed to a random soldier in the crowd. "Fire your weapon, see how fast you can do it." He pointed to a target in the distance. The soldier had to eject his casings every time he fired. Sometimes, he resorted to hitting his rifle with his wrist before it worked.\n\n"Now watch this," He aimed the Garand and fired eight shots in succession, his streak stopped by the ping of the gun. He laid the rifle beside him, its butt on the ground. "And that is American firepower!" He said to the awed fascists."

 MAG.24.t: "The Wastes of Magadan"
 MAG.24.desc: "Mikhail Matkovsky stood, overlooking a large map of Magadan and its hinterland in the conference room that he and his top advisors often met in. He sighed, taking in the reality of his situation - while Magadan was a real town, most of the territory that he controlled was either depopulated, underdeveloped, or both. It wasn't exactly an ideal situation for a government that needed bodies and industry as fast as possible. As a number of his ministers filed in, all of them presumably having been briefed on the nature of the meeting, Matkovsky turned to them. In his well-known, tactful manner, he addressed his audience. "It's clear that our current... industrial situation is untenable." Continuing, moving aside to show his ministers the map. "We need to take action to ensure that we're not overwhelmed by our southern rivals. It's no secret that they enjoy Japan's material support."\n\nOne minister, Goltsov, spoke up. "It will take some work, of course, but I have been thinking the same thing, we cannot allow ourselves to be outcompeted by our rivals. A few proposals can be drawn up, my Vozhd. Industrialization, under the direct supervision of the government, attracting any potential foreign investment by any means necessary."\n\nMatkovsky looked around the room, waiting for any other comments before continuing. "Good, please do. I don't plan on matching Rodzaevsky and the Whites, I want to outstrip their production." Tacit nods from most followed - Matkovsky made his intentions clear. He wanted to turn Magadan into a city of industry. Not an easy task, certainly, for Magadan's earliest purpose was as a stop-off for the work camps and mines in the region. But if the Vozhd thought it best, it was probably best. And every person in the room, Matkovsky included, knew that if the Vozhd wanted it, it would be done. Matkovsky nodded gently, before stating, "Well then, let's get to work.""

 MAG.25.t: "Inspection Day"
 MAG.25.desc: "Mikhail Matkovsky, the Vozhd himself, made his way down to the Magadan garrison to inspect the quality of the troops that made up his army. The chilly morning air seemed not to have any effect on the Vozhd, who was in full military dress, as he and his high command approached the troops in formation. All of the soldiers were dressed as he was and sported their weapons of war, but even before he approached them, Matkovsky could tell what poor soldiers they would make. His generals exchanged nervous glances with one another.\n\nOne soldier was too fat, the other malnourished. The third was too short and the fourth didn't have his uniform's buttons done up right. They all had the full uniform, but it seemed as if they had simply borrowed bits and pieces from their peers, as a lot of them didn't fit. All of them, not just these four, were equipped with weapons that looked like they had been outdated by the time the Germans were ravaging the west of Russia. This sorry state of affairs made it blatantly obvious to Matkovsky that on one of the most important days of their lives, these troops could barely muster together even the smallest shred of professionalism. The inspection ended, Matkovsky politely walking along the columns of the Magadan garrison, taking mental notes. Scruffy beards, outdated weapons, ill discipline. Matkovsky knew that it wasn't their fault, for the most part. He had a chronic shortage of bodies, weapons, and officers, all of which were necessary for raising and maintaining a professional army.\n\nAfter the inspection, he had called a meeting of his high command, where a rare flare of anger shone through his usual professional behavior. "What is going on? These are the best troops that you have to offer me?" he asked his generals. A number of cursory excuses were offered, but Matkovsky put his hand up to demand their silence. "I don't want to hear it. If those are the men who guard the capital, what do those on the front lines look like? How do you think we will overcome Rodzaevsky, let alone retake the entirety of Russia? I don't care what the solution is, I want you to find it. And I want to be briefed on it this time tomorrow.""

 MAG.26.t: "Making Progress"
 MAG.26.desc: "In the months since Matkovsky's scathing inspection of the Magadan garrison, things seemed to go from bad to, well, surprisingly good. Matkovsky's generals and administration had taken upon themselves to figure out some way to improve the true RFP's fighting ability. "The answer was simple," mused one senior officer. "When we realized we couldn't use conscripts, we bought soldiers from abroad instead." Indeed, mercenaries and military advisors, state-sponsored or otherwise, have been slowly but surely streaming into the frozen port of Magadan to not only pad Matkovsky's army of ill-suited conscripts, but to train them as well, to crack the whip and bring them, kicking and screaming, into the world of professionalism. The fat ones were now skinny, the malnourished ones healthy. All of them had a semblance of fighting spirit for the first time ever, and the guns, while still archaic, were at least cleaned and maintained properly. Training, as barebones as it was, actually began to prepare the conscripts and their mercenary counterparts for the realities of modern warfare in the frigid forests and marshes of Siberia. All this of course was tacked on to a very long and expensive bill that Matkovsky had to pass off to his administration. He was confident that there would be something for them to pay the mercenaries with.\n\nAfter Matkovsky's second inspection of the troops, which like the first, was kept as a surprise, he once again called a meeting with his general staff. As they filed in, worried that the new inspection was not enough of an improvement from the original, many nervously fiddled with pens, or reports, while others looked anywhere but where Matkovsky stood. As they all assembled, the Vozhd spoke. "After this second inspection," he said, in his normal, reserved manner, "I want to say good job, to all of you." Many were surprised. "I know that the task I assigned to you was not an easy one, and while we're far from perfect, I am pleased with the progress that we're making. The path to seek out mercenaries and foreign support was not one that I would have expected, but it's clearly working, and I will be meeting with some top advisors about how to increase the numbers and effectiveness of these foreigners." And then, finally, the rare "Thank you. Dismissed.""

Another pause, before the same voice, beaming with excitement, "This is an American-made M1911, courtesy of our friends in the CIA."\n\n"Please don't wave that around, Sergei," a smooth baritone said, evidently Vasily, "That gun is loaded."

The commercial links between the party and America had manifested themselves in the cans of Coca-Cola, packs of Lucky Strike, and the powdered coffee that they now drank.\n\n"So," Sergei said to Vasily, "did you hear about the victory out west?" A nod answered his query. "I thought so. I hear the Vozhd's coming out here in a few days to make some grand speech about the victory or something." He took a sip of his coffee and a bite out of his toast, "These are good."\n\n"I hear they're cutting our pay," Vasily said, putting his cup down, while Sergei regarded him, eyes widened with surprise. "It's true." Vasily continued. "To tell you the truth, I have been expecting it for a while, what with the number of electricians and technicians showing up to work these days." He sighed. "At least I have savings."\n\n"What kind of savings?" Sergei said, his mouth full of food.\n\n"This and that, you know. My dad used to be a bodyguard for Rodzaevsky. I can find a thing or two here and there throughout the years."\n\n"Kind of surprised the Vozhd didn't just have you shot."\n\nA chuckle. "You tell me.

Tom thought for a moment, glancing over his shoulder back towards his crew and the sad, cold dockyard they inhabited. For a split-second he prepared to shake the man off, then his posture relaxed and his resistance stopped. Why not be John Wayne for a while?\n\nThe two men eventually reached a bar, and Thomas Tremblay's newfound comrade Aleksandr kicked open the doors violently.\n\n"Brothers! Look at the American who has decided to come smuggling in our port! The one from the movies!"\n\nBlank faces stared back at the unfolding spectacle, seemingly annoyed at the disruption. Tom grinned, mustering a ham-fisted southern drawl.\n\n"Well, howdy folks!"\n\nThe room erupted into jovial cheers and laughter.

They had ransacked his shop. Trinkets lay in the ground, and what little cash they had scrounged and wrung out of the trader's pockets lay on the counter. The shop had seen better days, days the trader could remember with fondness and warmth. The Union wasn't perfect, but at least they had not hired overgrown children to boss people around in fascist uniforms.\n\nOne of the little fascists, a scrawny man with a voice frozen in permanent hysteria, thumped on the counter, sending the few coins on it into tremors. To his face, his fellow thugs called him Vlad, the Boss; behind him, they ridiculed his height and his voice and whispered rumors of him knowing some important figures in the party's political wing. "I know that you've got some more," he said, "Come on, Bogdan," he plied with his hands folded together, "For our old friendship. You don't want to have all you ever had destroyed, do you? I am patient, but my friends here are not. I kept begging them, but they wouldn't leave you alone. I beg you, fulfill their simple wishes, and pay. Once you pay up I'll have your back again."\n\nBogdan didn't have anything else. Business had been slow since the fall of the Union, and chaos wasn't exactly great for commerce. He hung on to his shop with a kind of stubborn nostalgia, dreaming that the old times might return. He turned to his office, and to address his tormentors: "Wait a moment." Kneeling beneath his desk, he found his family safe and unlocked it. A gun, and his late wife's jewelry. His hand inched towards the pistol, but he stopped mid-motion. Not today. Not wise.

His printing press followed all of the party's guidelines and regulations, and he lent them his business from time to time to print propaganda. However, on nights like these, with the moon nowhere in sight and accompanied by a single oil lamp, he let his facade drop. He unscrewed his flask and drank some terrible vodka he had saved from the local distillery. Wretched stuff, but there was nothing better. The party took the cream of the crop for themselves.\n\nHe returned to his desk, his figure throwing shadows in all directions. Sergei was in his office, in his element. He considered lighting up a cigarette while he worked, but decided against it. Sitting down, he glanced at the pamphlets he had written, satisfied at his work. Soon, the "garbage collection detail" would come and collect his pieces, distributing them among the streets of Magadan. He paid them a small sum to keep quiet about it.\n\nLeaning down, Sergei almost dozed off before a thought knocked on his skull. Why did he do this? Resistance to the party was minuscule, and his men were more loyal to his money than anything else he could offer. He looked at his oil lamp, its fuel running low, a single candle-light holding out against a backdrop of darkness. The symbolism was not lost on Sergei. Perhaps in a few days, in a few weeks, maybe even a year, he would find himself in a basement, moments away from being snuffed out. He put aside his worries.\n\nA knock sounded.

Instead, it felt light, tasting of dirt. Horrible. He put it down, settling it behind his ankles.\n\nThomas stared at the image, a blurry mess of green blobs charging black dots on the screen. Today's movie was an adaptation of a famous American comic book, Captain America. For Thomas, a connoisseur supreme of the movie industry, this film was trash. Its projection and audio were even worse than the script. He had found out too late that the lenses didn't fit, and he had to prop it in with some tape. The result was a screen infested with a permanent blur, and the crackling, scarce, and incomplete audio made the viewing experience into something fantastical.\n\nMikhail Matkovsky - the Vozhd of the Russians, as he styled himself - sat at the front. A charismatic, almost intimidating man, it was almost comical to see him laughing at what Americans would think was garbage. Intelligence, it seemed, did not uplift taste.\n\nThe hero charged at the enemy, and the brown blots collapsed and tumbled backward. The crowd cheered, and the air was that of discordant revelry. Thomas leaned down to pick up his bottle of vodka, only to send it tumbling and spilling it all over the floor. He sighed."

Maybe a pack of cigarettes, or even a can of powdered coffee. In his head, he toyed with the image of the Vozhd wearing something made from the lovely hide of this moose.\n\nAs usual, the RFP officials and thugs guarded every entrance to the city, their brown uniforms contrasting with the pale buildings of the town. However, Nikita noticed that the RFP now had new companions among their ranks. Sharply dressed men and women armed to the teeth and speaking a thousand foreign languages, congealing into a Tower of Babel manifested in the outskirts of Russia. It was quite the sight, with the mercenaries keeping to themselves and the Russians eternally suspicious of what was going on. The officials cleared him to enter the town, provided that he left his rifle in their checkpoint.\n\nHe sold the hide for some good cash. Money he could use to buy bullets, provisions, food, and medical supplies to last him for another week. There was something new to the town, however: American products. American coffee, cigarettes, and even radio were available, and quite common even. They were cheaper than native-Magadan goods, although they were often sold out by the end of the day. Nikita bought a pack of cigarettes and a can of powdered coffee. Smiling at his newest gains, he strolled to the edge of the town, returning to his home in the northern reaches of Siberia."

They expected the night to go on as smoothly as it always did, a cruise into the moonlight as the games continued, pockets emptying and men filing into the street with the grace of drunken feet.\n\nThree listless men entered into the bar, new arrivals in Magadan. They were WerBell's men, heavily armed and heartily paid: professional soldiers that hailed from all corners of the world. They had too much free time. At first they and the locals got along quite nicely, which is to say they did not interact much at all. Only silent nods and scarce eye contact bridged the difference between the group.\n\nThe uneasy truce did not last long. The listless men flirted with the girls behind the counter, and the locals did not like it. Standing up, they shouted profanities at the mercenaries in a language they did not understand. It did not take long for the soldiers to unholster their pistols and threaten the locals. It only took a minute before one of the mercenaries accidentally fired a shot, resulting in a dead civilian who was only found hours later after the rioting that ensued.\n\nThe locals, instead of being driven back by gunshots, charged the armed men, using broken bottles and chairs to attack the new arrivals. WerBell's mercenaries, dispatched as a backup for the new arrivals, got involved shortly. The party's police, who intervened to stop more bloodshed, were met with a rain of bullets and jagged glass.\n\nAfter a dozen dead civilians, and two dozen more wounded, the riots were finally put down by force.

Now, as the sun was setting, its orange light aged his features beyond the man's already formidable years. He had joined the party since its first days in Harbin, and was a veteran of the Anti-Bolshevik Front.\n\nPeople from inside the party, further up in the hierarchy call her father Vlad the Tall, in mockery of his height. Outside the party, they called him a thug, a criminal, a robber vested with a RFP uniform. Sometimes he could see his reputation manifest itself when he met his neighbors.

Any time any of them dared to cross Vlad's path, however, they scurried away almost immediately when he drew his gun, a trusty Nambu he had kept by his side for years, again, since the days of Harbin.\n\nIn Katerina's eyes, however, she did not find a monster in the figure of her father, standing as a single silhouette against the dying day.

Following Barbarossa and the Soviet Union's collapse, the CIA could scarcely glean any information from that vast country. Except for the West Russian War of the 50s, the Russia of our imagination had become a cesspool of violent infighting, with the German bombings preventing any attempts of regional warlords to consolidate power.\n\nAt least, this seems to be the case in West Russia and Siberia. With a land area that stretched from the Baltic to the Pacific, there are some stretches of territory untouched by the banditry and chaos that plagues the areas adjacent to the German Reich. From Central Siberia, the primary recipient of the Bukharin-era Siberian Plan, we have heard that a Republic had risen and collapsed there between the Second World War and the West Russian War.\n\nThen there is the Russian Far East - a region that the CIA has been observing for quite some time. In brief, the legitimate government of the Soviet Union (under the provisional leadership of Genrikh Yagoda) retreated there after their defeat; subsequently, the Anti-Bolshevik Front sprang out from Manchuria and Harbin, making significant gains before shattering into three parts based on Chita, Magadan, and Amur.\n\nIn particular interest of this briefing is the Free State of Magadan, led by Mikhail Matkovsky - a local fascist of some repute. He and his foreign minister, Nikolay Petlin, has promised reforms and democracy should the U.S. support their bid for the - as the Matkovsky insisted - "great crusade for Russia," as well as intelligence and information.\n\nThe Agency notes that the decision is the President's alone to make.

As you're no doubt aware, I served under the previous administration as the Vozhd's top man in matters of internal security, and you'll find in short order that I am quite professional, should you choose to entrust me with such matters."\n\nWerBell met his offer with complete silence. Pavlov thought at first that this was contemplation, before realizing that the mercenary's eyes were completely uncomprehending. Oh, dear lord. The man barely understood Russian. WerBell pulled one of the other mercenaries over to the table and beckoned to Pavlov to continue. The rest of the negotiations progressed with the other man clumsily interpreting in his slightly less bad Russian, and they proved surprisingly fruitful. Clearly, the Americans had a deficit of loyal locals, and Pavlov was more than happy to fill it."

 ### Matkovsky expansion tree events ###
 magexp.1.t: "The Puppet Tsar"
 magexp.1.desc: ""Is the meal to your liking," Matkovsky said, as his hands cut another piece of beef, "Mr. Romanov?" Sitting across from him was the alleged Tsar, Mikhail. Candlelight illuminated those eyes that a few days ago had seen the muzzle-fire of rifles as the RFP stormed the "palace" where Mikhail ruled. The truth was, despite the regal garb and silverware elegant enough to act as a mirror, Mikhail was no more than a puppet for the old-style White Army types. While he waited for the response from this "Tsar," Matkovsky put his fork to his mouth, tasting the ragged, almost-done taste of the steak. Not good, not terrible.\n\nMikhail chewed, swallowed, and set down his utensils. Before he spoke, he wiped his mouth with a napkin. Taking up a glass of wine, he turned to regard Matkovsky, his gaze crisp and calm. "It was," Mikhail said, straightening to deliver his verdict, "an adequate dinner." Matkovsky smiled at him. From what he heard about the reluctant Tsar, Mikhail was never one to hold back his honesty. For all the legitimacy he lacked, Mikhail had one thing many in the Front did not have, from the monarchists to the fascists: a spine. He took a sip. Putting his glass down with a silent thud, Mikhail said, "Mr. Matkovsky, perhaps you will entertain a question from this humble prisoner."\n\n"Speak your mind," Matkovsky said, the dinner practically over at this point, "your 'Majesty'."\n\n"I realize that my position in Russia has grown rather... tenuous." Mikhail gave himself a chuckle. "Not that it has been well in the first place, but there you go." Leaning back, an act of defiance against royal etiquette, he drew a deep, heavy sigh. "So, what'll happen to me now?"\n\nMatkovsky stared at him, deliberating. This "Tsar" was a potential danger. Mikhail could be a dangerous contender for power. On the other hand, the monarchist strain in the RFP was wearing away and fast. Soon, no one would take Mikhail's claim seriously, and letting him go into exile, far away from Russia, might be the prudent - and decent - decision. Matkovsky opened his mouth to speak."
 magexp.1.a: ""You will stay here.""
 magexp.1.b: ""You will go home.""
 
 magexp.2.t: "Memories"
 magexp.2.desc: "Matkovsky reclined in his seat, smoking a cigar: a luxury in the chaos of Russia. He drew deep from it, its embers bathing the room in orange light. In one quick gasp, he expelled all of it out, letting his lungs bask in the warmth of the fumes and smoke. It had been an excellent day. As the Vozhd, he recognized that his work would never cease, but the heights! Oh, the heights that he had reached. From the underling of a madman into the head of the new Anti-Bolshevik Front. He snorted. Life was absurd; life was good.\n\nIn front of him was no alcohol, no whiskey, no vodka. He was drunk from another substance that had addicted him since the beginning of his career. Photo albums, in black and white, as well as in color, filled the surface of his desk. From the times of the old RFP in Harbin to the first incursion to Siberia, he had it all. Here he was, standing next to Rodzaevsky and Semyonov. There he was, inspecting the troops in the name of his old master, their black uniforms standing in contrast against a frozen background. He was young then. A true believer. A wry and sorrowful smile rose on his lips. If only men did not change. His mind wandered over the photographs, searching in vain for that turn in destiny that would perhaps have preserved their brotherhood. He found none.\n\nHe drew on his cigar again. His eyes wandered to the dusty, untouched gramophone in the corner of the room. Matkovsky stood up from his seat, and the Vozhd left the room."
 magexp.2.a: "A moment of quiet, amid all the chaos."
 
 magexp.3.t: "The Fate of Wild Mitch"
 magexp.3.desc: "Today was inspection day. Draped in a black fur coat, Matkovsky looked at the ships in the harbor as they brought over supplies and arms from America. He could see his breath stirring in front of him, in white, flaky pieces of air. The port had smelled the same, bearing an odor of brine and rotten fish, with a subtle tang of salt above it all. Petlin and Pavlov went up and down the piers, their silhouettes dark against the pale, weak morning light.\n\nA random thought struck him. They had not found WerBell's body. Try as he might, with his men spread out across the tundras and forests of Siberia, he could not find him. He sighed and breathed the scent of the sea. Wherever the mercenary was, he did not care. Dead or alive, WerBell was out of his way. He stepped forward and strode onto the docks.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSomewhere in the world, a soft rock tune played in the background of a tropical cafe, overlooking a beach. A gruff, balding man sat in the corner, reading a newspaper, his cup of coffee untouched. He had to settle for cigarettes. He had fun in some exotic locale recently, and it was a crying shame that it ended. Fucking fascists. First they wouldn't pay, and now they kicked him out. What had the world come down to? He shook his head. No more honest employers these days, it seemed.\n\nHe put the papers down. For the first time since the morning, he tasted the coffee. Mud. It was time to look for new places, new horizons. He left some money on the table, accounting for tips, and left the cafe, cigarette in mouth."
 magexp.3.a: "Where is he going to next?"
 
 magexp.4.t: "The Far East Theater"
 magexp.4.desc: "Transmission 02, Agent Mason, currently stationed in Magadan.\n\nSubject: The Growing Situation of the Far East: an Overview\n\nContent:\n\nFollowing the last report issued, training of the Magadan forces under Matkovsky proceeded smoothly. Surplus arms from the U.S. arsenals distributed among the soldiers have had an incredible effect, and the officer training has borne fruit. I can say without hesitation that the Vozhd's army is the most advanced in the Far Eastern territories; praise only checked by the old, military adage: they still have room to grow. The prospects of the Vozhd's "Crusade", - a term he insists on to no end - seems bright.\n\nContinuing from the last report, the RFP in Magadan has defeated their counterparts in Amur. Along with this development, they quickly broke the truce they had with the Tsarists in Chita and toppled the Tsar there. In one fell swoop, Matkovsky has succeeded in reunifying the old Anti-Bolshevik Front, albeit by force. Barring other emergent factions in the area, we are confident in saying that the Vozhd currently possesses the strongest forces in the East in terms of personnel and industrial capacity.\n\nHowever, we feel the need to qualify this series of rapid progress. There remains another significant force in the Far East: the Reds and the hardline RFP. The only main concern that the RFP and U.S. personnel note are the rumors from the Northern Siberia, of a religious leader amassing power among the tribes there. Though the probability of the RFP's victory remains high, we recommend further and closer inspection of regional developments. Mason out."
 magexp.4.a: "There is still much to be done."
 
 magexp.5.t: "Learning from the Past"
 magexp.5.desc: "Petlin studied the map before him. A dull, unadorned picture save for roughly drawn borders between "states" that competed for dominance in the Russian Far East. For now, there were only two significant contenders, with the communists marked in red and new, rejuvenated Russian Fascist Party in blotches of black and brown. He laid his fingers on the lines that demarked the boundaries between the two mortal enemies. In the dark cold of his office, he could feel the heat rise to his touch, as decades of hatred and enmity burned in the frontlines.\n\nA thud. Petlin didn't mind it. It was probably an aide stumbling their way through the dark. He looked outside the windows of his little room. The night was bright, with momentary gaps of darkness, as the clouds conspired to keep the light of the full moon for themselves. In the coming days - he did not know when, maybe in a week or a month - would be the days of another confrontation. He sighed. If only there were another way. A knock on the door woke him up from his reverie.\n\n"Coffee, sir?" an aide said, bringing a tray full of the hot black liquid, steam rising from the cups, "I thought you wanted some, as I made some for the men."\n\n"Put it on my desk," he said, breathing a sigh of relief. At least, it wasn't the Vozhd, come to check up on his work. "Mind the map." The aide gingerly placed Petlin's cup on the northern edges of the map, its fragrant fumes spreading its way through the room. As he lifted the tray, however, he knocked it over, spilling the coffee. The aide hurriedly drew his handkerchief, but Petlin stopped him. The damage was already done. No amount of wiping would ever clean the map.\n\nThe aide withdrew from the room, profusely apologizing all the while. As Petlin examined the stain, however, he remembered the rumors from the north, of a heretic amassing his forces to free the Siberians from the tyranny of fascism and communism. While the blot expanded and absorbed more and more of the paper, Petlin found his mind wandering. Perhaps this was an omen."
 magexp.5.a: "A sign from the Lord, perhaps?"
 
 magexp.6.t: "First Reports"
 magexp.6.desc: "Oleg leaned on a tree, using his pencil to scribble out notes for a report to the Vozhd's new State Intelligence Agency. As a member of the Siberian Rangers, it was perhaps unsurprising that he was handpicked for a field position in the SIA. He had to be careful not to press the paper too harshly against the tree bark, or he would tear the fragile and thin piece of grey paper apart. The notes themselves were simple, what he'd seen that day, the weather and geographical conditions, as well as the dispositions of the nearby locals.\n\nThe last part troubled Oleg more than any other. He did not like talking to people. He'd sooner crawl into the trenches of the enemy, evading mines and barbed wire, with machine guns raining fire upon him than talk to a bumpkin who couldn't even get their dialect right. Still, through the rugged surface, he managed to write a tiny bit of what he'd seen and heard of the locals. The data was probably insignificant, but he didn't care. He had done what was asked of him and done it brilliantly. He even talked to one or two of the less obnoxious farmers out there in the wilds. Finishing his writing, he shoved the paper into his pockets and sat down. It was time for a moment of rest. He took out a roughly rolled cigarette and lit it.\n\nIn the hands of the SIA, individual data was useless. Collectively, however, they might be the force that decided the battle. He dragged the cigarette out, letting the smoke cloud and cleanse his mind. After this, Oleg would go into the offices of the SIA and type up his report, drawing up conclusions and recommending courses of action for the higher-ups. He would rather be in the Siberian Rangers still, but maybe this life was good enough."
 magexp.6.a: "Thus ran the cogs of the Vozhd's new eyes and ears."
 
 magexp.7.t: "The Last Sentry"
 magexp.7.desc: "The truck ran into the Siberian countryside, carrying on its back five men: four in garbs of soldiers and equipped as such, and the fifth a blindfolded man, his clothes being threadbare rags on the edge of tearing apart. It was early morning, and the roadside snow lay in thick clumps, a fair bit of distance away from the woods to which the vehicle was headed. Occasionally they would come upon a bump on the road, and the four had to lift the blindfolded man back to his seat.\n\nTo their relief, the latter was silent. The voice that had proclaimed liberation for the workers of Russia from atop the radiowaves had held back, its will broken. He could do nothing now, his eyes shut, his hands tied behind his back - his followers lay dead in the fields, and whatever remained of his legacy would thaw like snow come the next spring.\n\nWhen they arrived at the clearing, a random spot in the middle of Russia designated as the "execution point." Opening the cargo bed, they took the blind man and brought him out by the elbow, setting him down, gently as they can, to a patch of snow-covered soil. Then, they made him stand and walked him forward, to somewhere he did not know. An atheist all his life, he confessed that he regretted nothing, and the calm stillness of the dawn greeted the eerie silence of his heart. He did not need the opiate of the masses; his pain was his own.\n\nThey took the blindfold off him, and the sunlight shocked him. How many days had it been? How many months, years - how much time? They stopped, and he knelt. His eyes remained fixated on the sky above.\n\nThey read out his sentence. Rifles clacked, and all ends pointed to his head. "By order of the Vozhd of the Russians," a voice read out loud, somewhere in front of him, "I sentence you, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin," he was ready. "To exile!" He pointed his head down and looked around him, lost. The guards gave him a revolver, two bullets, a coat, and some black bread. After that, they departed.\n\nHe wanted to laugh, and he giggled. Soon, however, all was silent, except for a lonely, deprived sobbing."
 magexp.7.a: "Cruel mercy."
 
 magexp.8.t: "The Vozhd on the Radio"
 magexp.8.desc: "The soldiers of the army sat in their canteen, waiting for the steady pace of the staff to serve their food. It was nothing much, given the soil of Siberia, but what was there was enough. Some thick soup and black bread was their dinner that night. Usually, they would wait in a line - tonight was special. An officer brought a radio to the frontmost table, for tonight, the Vozhd was on the airwaves, preparing to deliver an address to the people of the Far East. It was silent, save for the clatter of plates and the slosh of liquid soup as the servers lowered their ladles unto dishes. No one touched their food.\n\nA wave of patriotic music swept over the barracks. A voice, that of their dear Vozhd, Mikhail Matkovsky, spoke, booming and echoing through the room. "Good evening, the people of Russia!" he said, "tomorrow, past midnight, a new age begins. The Reds, long traitors to the virtues of the Russian people, have been defeated. Their armies lay dead in the fields, their ideologues, their party, their presidium, their pretensions to legitimacy, all scattered to the four winds." A semblance of cheer broke out within the ranks, although everything stayed calm. The clattering and the sloshing continue between the spaces of Matkovsky's words.\n\n"My loyal soldiers, militant and martial, the armed wing of the Russian Fascist Party, the true heroes of the proletariat, have broken through the darkness that had caged and jailed Russia for so long." A patter of claps joined the clatter and slosh. "They shall be the vanguard of a new revolution - a revolution not brought about by the necessities of inhumane ideologies, but for a renewal, a rejuvenation, for a new, for a powerful Russia to take her place once again among nations!"\n\nThe patter of hands, fingers, and palms joined together, a storm that drowned all the other noises. A cry here, a cry there acting as the thunderous rods that broke the atmosphere; the night was complete."
 magexp.8.a: "A lively evening, to be sure."
 
 magexp.9.t: "The Life of Judas"
 magexp.9.desc: "It was almost evening when Zakhar finished. He sat in his scriptorium, a candle by his side, prepared for the inevitable night. The sun hadn't yet set, but it was best to be ready when it did. His pen scribbled on the creamy, expensive paper that the Vozhd had brought for him, a generosity that matched the grandiose scale of his commission: the history of Christianity in the Far East. With each stroke, he struck the thought and the memory of how he came under Mikhail Matkovsky's service, a story that he - and perhaps only he and God - knew. He gritted his teeth, vowing to carry the tale to his grave. Each man bore a different cross, and this was his: not to die in honor but to live in shame.\n\nHis pen halted upon reaching the Fifties and the Sixties. Here, he sighed. For the sake of posterity, perhaps the future would do better not knowing the crimes done to reach a better age. Aside from the general chaos of Russia, he found himself stumped. Other than the obvious and apparent, there were no notable events that had happened in the Far East. He would have to consult his archives, documents, and books. Perhaps there he would be able to forge a narrative convincing enough, real enough, that there would be none who would question it. He opened the first book, a baptismal record he had set on the table, and began reading, leafing through its pages to find and secure the desired truth.\n\nWithin the first few pages, the black bars started to appear. A certain Father, whose name was blotted out by thick, messy ink, had baptized hundreds in a village - the name blotted, struck out of living memory. Zakhar recognized his handiwork. He had to do it in a hurry. It had been a hard choice, but he could not let the integral history of the monastery disappear. Zakhar remembered the Father, a man who undertook the difficult mission of proselytizing to the tribes in the north. Nobody thought that he would return, yet he did - bringing not peace but the sword. Zakhar rode out with him to the south, an aide in his war council, from the beginning until the end.\n\nHe stepped outside, the weight of warm and bright memories twisted into darkness. The laughter, the tears, seemed to burn in his ears, a ringing sound that wouldn't cease. Then he saw the graves, their silhouettes dark against the dying sun. Rows upon rows, for miles upon miles. He saw the crosses of his comrades, men and women, that they bore in life, and that now they carry unto death. Crosses of rough-hewn wood, unmarked, and unnamed. He collapsed to his knees. Perhaps today, too, he would fail to bear his."
 magexp.9.a: "For a few pieces of silver more."
 
 magexp.10.t: "The NKVD Papers"
 magexp.10.desc: "Dmitry watched as they stacked the papers from Yagoda's offices. Piles upon piles of flickering, faint white pages weighted down by rocks so the Siberian wind would not scatter them in all directions. Yagoda himself had either died or disappeared; the Vozhd would not care for either. Preferably, the Vozhd would have had him shot - but fate did not will Matkovsky to do so. Dmitry nursed the stump that had once been his arm. He still felt it, at night, grasping at imaginary objects, gripping the handle of imagined doors, and brushing against walls that only belonged in his mind.\n\nIvan was out there, somewhere. The quiet bastard didn't even accept any form of thanks from him. A single grunt, and hands that shooed away any cigarettes, canned food, or money. Dmitry's prosthetic lay beside him, on the grass, its sockets yearning for an owner to wield them. Not now. It had been some time since the doctors amputated his gangrenous, infected arms in a dank, full medical tent. The morphine they provided had not been enough, and he still dreaded to think of the night.\n\nTurning to see the pile, he saw a guard in RFP uniform walk towards it carrying a can of petroleum. Others carried leaves, branches, and whatever flammable material they could find and smothered the pile with it. The heavy odor of petrol reeked as the guard first opened the can and then poured it on the papers, shuffling away from it, leaving a trail. Then he lit a match, and all of them watched as the fire caught the path fixed for it, and gently set the records ablaze.\n\nDmitry observed the flames burn with disinterest. What had transpired between the Vozhd of the Russians and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, he did not care. He felt the flames brush his face, its heat intensifying by every second. He sat, massaging his stump, and watched the past crumble to ashes before his eyes."
 magexp.10.a: "The future is now."
 
 magexp.11.t: "The Charter of Magadan"
 magexp.11.desc: "Petlin watched as Matkovsky and the rest of his Cabinet took their seats at the round table on the highest floor of the RFP building. He followed them, sitting right beside Matkovsky, a mere ambassador lifted to the position of the right-hand man. He was the lifeline between the Americans and the party, after all. A chandelier set the room alight, an unfamiliar sight to Petlin's eyes. The Cabinet usually met during the day, not at night.\n\nOnce they were all seated, Matkovsky turned to him, mouthing, "That all of them?" He gave the Vozhd a nod, who then stood up and coughed, silencing the whispering that had commenced among the ministers. "Gentlemen," Matkovsky said, "I come to you here today with a bold proposal," he tapped his fingers on the table, going around the table, counter-clockwise. "As per the recommendations from our dear friend Nikolay Petlin," he pointed at Petlin as if his point needed clarification, "who has proposed a radical change: a shift that would perhaps transform the very nature of the party." Arriving at the other end of the table he stopped, before continuing, "I understand that many of us here, including me, Petlin, Pavlov, and many others have served the cause of Russia ever since the creation of the party in Harbin." Striding forward, he raised his voice, "However, the times have changed. The Party needs, forgive me for the trite expression, to move on with the times."\n\nReturning to his former seat, he said, "I propose to do away with the affectations of the past. To..." his voice trailed away, before once again finding purchase, "escape the shadow of Rodzaevsky." He raised his head and looked at every man seated in their eyes, "We shall sign the charter of Magadan. Petlin, our dear friend," his hands grasped Petlin's shoulders, "has kindly written a new constitution for us." He let go, before clapping his hands together, "I am sure that all of you have read it. Now, I propose that from today henceforth the Russian Fascist Party is no more - it is now the National Labor Party of Russia." He paused, gauging every man there for their worth, "All in favor say aye."\n\nThere was no dissent."
 magexp.11.a: ""Aye.""

 magexp.12.t: "Exiling the Tsar"
 magexp.12.desc: "In the fire of the Revolution, Bukharin had the royal family shot. They were a threat, they were deemed a rallying symbol for the old order.\n\nIn the confusion of the Far East, had things gone differently, Rodzaevsky would have had the Tsar shot. For he was a rival, a hated enemy of the new Russian order, a personal insult to the animal that had called himself the Vozhd.\n\nThe true Vozhd looks out across the table, meal finished, and regards the Tsar. The decision was clear - and the decent thing can be the prudent one as well. "Mikhail Romanov, you will leave Russia. I trust you know why."\n\nHe nods slowly, face flickering from disbelief to something like satisfaction or relief. "I... see. Exile, then." The last sentence is murmured softly, perhaps not meant for Matkovsky to hear.\n\n"Exile." Matkovsky nods sharply, swirling the last of his wine around as he regards the odd Tsar. "You will leave your homeland and not return. You will go to... Australia, was it not?"\n\nMikhail nods again with eyes downcast, fingers drumming on the table for moment. "It was, yes." He looks up to catch Matkovsky's eyes, "Thank you. I-" He pauses, and Matkovsky knows the erstwhile Tsar too well to think it's to think of a flowery thanks. "You did not have to."\n\n"No, I didn't." The Vozhd allows himself the ghost of a smile, "But I did."\n\nIn the relative peace of Magadan, with the long road to Moscow stretching out before him, the Vozhd allows himself mercy. The Tsar will soon be an irrelevance, after all."
 magexp.12.a: "The new Vozhd can be generous."

 magexp.13.t: "House Arrest"
 magexp.13.desc: "The world is on the brink, the motherland is at the cusp of a crossroads in her history, and the double eagle has a certain appeal in these times. Mikhail Matkovsky allows himself one moment to consider the decent thing, and sets it aside. The long road west has more than a few pretenders to the imperial throne, after all.\n\nMatkovsky looks the erstwhile Tsar of Chita in the eye, and replies. "There is a house near Lake Baikal, and you will be placed there with a suitable escort."\n\n"House arrest." The obvious is stated with a sort of resignation. "All the same, though..."\n\n"It is a mercy." The Vozhd finishes the sentence, words hanging heavy with implications. The animal of Amur would have shot him, as would any of the communists. "You will be well-treated, I assure you."\n\n"Thank you." The words are not without bitterness, but bitterness was not unexpected. The Tsar looks at the Vozhd with mingled resignation and relief, that he isn't to be made a spectacle and yet not to be free.\n\nThe light seems harsh, the conversation turning to Siberia, and the civil coolness of the Vozhd seeming to drain any protest out of Mikhail.\n\nMikhail Matkovsky sits with the last of the old order, and remembers that it can still inspire. The eagle will be caged, at Lake Baikal. The Tsar will stay in Russia, until the new Russia that the Vozhd is building will no longer have any faith in his legacy."
 magexp.13.a: "The Vozhd has mercy, but not overmuch."

 ### Regional events ###
 magreg.1.t: "Sign Up and Fall In"
 magreg.1.desc: "Young Sergey rubbed his eyes as he woke to the sound of the loudspeaker out the window. Outside, a truck drove by and a voice blared from its mounted loudspeaker:\n\n"Soratniki! Your Vozhd is calling you to a higher purpose! Though you may not have helped vanquish the false heirs to Harbin, you now have the opportunity to achieve a far greater glory: The reunification of our Russian land! Our friends in America have sent you the finest arms and equipment, but now we need you!"\n\nSergey pondered these words as he went downstairs to eat his breakfast. His parents had made him a simple kasha, and as he ate he could hear the truck driving by again.\n\n"Our victory over the traitors, subversives and lunatics is the first step towards a triumph over the Hun! With your help, we shall celebrate New Year's in Moscow! With your help, we shall celebrate Christmas in Kiev! And with your help, the world will stand in awe of Russia's majesty once more! Enlist with the National Republican Army today, and our Motherland will be united tomorrow!"\n\nSergey knew his parents wouldn't approve, but after his breakfast he hurried to city hall to find the local recruiter. His parents would just have to miss his 18th birthday this year."
 magreg.1.a: "To arms for Russia!"
 
 magreg.2.t: "Daydreams"
 magreg.2.desc: "Gone were the days of old. The failures of the Tsarists, the communists, and yes, even the failures of fascism. Or at least; Rodzavesky's ill begotten Germanophilic version. Mikhail had painted over all of their troublesome antics with a single big, red brush. Yes, the far eastern reaches were secured, but it would not be enough.\n\nIt would never be enough. Magadan had been a poor home for the émigrés who had fled there, hoping for a new place. A new home. A new Russia. And now, a step had been taken towards this new dream. To think it was all coming within his grasp...\n\nOf course, he still had work to do. Control had to be solidifed, the Americans had to be sated, and the future had to be secured. But - his dream kept coming back to him. A free Russia, different than all that had come before it. A new place, where everything was better. Everything was calmer. A place Russians could truly call home - no matter the price that would come in making it.\n\nA new, hopeful land. Peace through order; order through strength. This was the maxim they needed. Strong. Firm. Uncompromising.\n\nAnd despite all his glances to the forms on his desk, he couldn't get over the thoughts dancing in his head."
 magreg.2.a: "The future waits for no one. Back to work."
 
 magreg.3.t: "A Free Radio?"
 magreg.3.desc: "Though the government has finally agreed to subsidize Radio Free Magadan, this decision doesn't necessarily come without a price for the radio.\n\nMany Laborists have called for the radical reform of the radio and the replacement of the hosts (who have quickly grown on people, to the surprise of everyone except perhaps Sergei.) This would be done to ensure the loyalty of the radio to the state and make it a useful tool for spreading fascist truth. Of course, as neither Sergei nor Vasily are thought of very highly by the Laborists, with some whispering that the feeling is mutual, they would probably have to be... disposed of, to ensure they make no attempts at subversion as revenge for their dismissal.\n\nOn the other hand, Reformists have called for the hosts to remain due to their popularity, and the maintenance of the freedom of their content for the radio to live up to its name, with mandated changes only as necessary as to improve the efficiency of the radio's operation.\n\nAll that remains is for the final decision to be made."
 magreg.3.a: "There is no loyalty without freedom."
 magreg.3.b: "There is no freedom without loyalty."
 
 magreg.4.t: "An Atypical Meeting"
 magreg.4.desc: "It was a typical meeting for the RNTP. Nothing too large on today's agenda for the Vozhd, but appearances were important. Mikhail strutted in accepting the greetings of a few Laborists, the glances of several Reformists, and - the silence of the room largely. It was quiet today. A small miracle - not having to deal with the bickerings of his own party. Nikolay Petlin came to the podium, and Mikhail waited to hear what was first on the agenda.\n\n"The first order of business on the agenda; the arrest of Mikhail Matkovsky," Nikolay stated calmly, with a single bit of iron to his tone.\n\nThe Vozhd froze, and then blinked. Had he heard that right? Arrest? Him? For a moment, he assumed it was a joke. A single bit of dry humor from a man who wanted his position. However, no one in the party protested. No one in the party laughed, or raised their voice. The Laborists he had greeted just minutes ago turned pale, and the room remained utterly silent.\n\n"For numerous crimes against both Russia, and the Russian people..." Nikolay continued, but Mikhail was no longer listening. How could this have happened? How did this happen? It wasn't possible. It wasn't. But as he stood there with a dumbfounded expression, shock written across his face, the guards moved. Not to arrest Petlin, or to shoot him on the spot.\n\n"Traitor." The former Vozhd whispered once quietly, as the guards moved to restrain him. "TRAITOR! YOU - BASTARD! You and your Reformers, every last one of you a bastard! You can't - " Arms wrapped around his own. Rage, fear, and sorrow compressed into a single scream.\n\nNone of his own clique look at him as he's dragged away. The guards ignore his pleas. And Nikolay Petlin, his spineless foreign minister, his subordinate, his replacement looks him in the eye the entire time he's dragged out."

He had already heard the doors slamming, the engines roaring like hellhounds off to drag him down to his final judgement, and the boots of soldiers slamming the ground as they made their way up his driveway. He knew what was coming, he had for weeks. Between the ominous looks from Laborists, his allies disappearing, and the Vozhd's stranglehold growing ever tighter, Petlin knew a reckoning was coming. The death of any hope of freedom in Magadan was at hand. Yet, despite how much he had prepared himself mentally, the event still shook the man to his core.\n\nPetlin heard downstairs his door coming off its hinges unceremoniously as Matkovsky's thugs stormed his home. He stood up, awaiting the three armed men rushing up his staircase and into his study. As he raised his hands in a gesture of surrender, suddenly his breath was stolen from him as the primed-for-combat soldier at the front tackled him at the waist. Dizzy and in pain, Petlin was rolled onto his back and shackles were snapped onto his wrists as his charges were read out.\n\nTreason. A believable charge, an expected charge. It still stung to hear that all his efforts to improve his country had earned him the title of traitor.\n\nThe traitor was dragged out into the street. His neighbours stayed indoors so as to not incur the wrath of the Vozhd. Instead, they watched through their blinds as Petlin was thrown into the back of an unmarked truck. It sped off down the street, never to return to this place. Through his blistering headache, Petlin had only one thought."

 magreg.6.desc: "The Shchuka's were old boats, once built as undersea killers, few had been used in their intended role. The Reds in Petropavlovsk had converted many for smuggling, large sections torpedo rooms stripped of their cylindrical warheads, replaced with cargo holds and additional accommodation. Now in the hands of the Siberian National Republic, the process was completed, the last vestiges of their warfighting capability having being stripped from their hulls.\n\nAbramov looked over the half dozen or so vessels now tied up at Magadan's port, the blue-gray waters of the Sea of Okhotsk lapping at their hulls. He checked over the manifest, most of the vessels would be assigned to smuggling from Petropavlovsk or Magadan to Alaska, providing the Republic with a steady stream of income and hard currency. Some of the older vessels would be laid up, their hulls a source of spares for the rest of the fleet, and one would be used as a training ship, educating a new generation of submariners in the art of surviving under the sea. Taking a glance at the setting sun, Abramov walked back to his new office.\n\nPouring himself a mug of coffee, he let his mind drift back to the meetings in Manchuria, the reclamation of the Far East, and the breakup of the Harbin Three. Times were simpler back then when they had Yagoda's Supreme Soviet keeping everyone on the same page, but the differences and the disagreements eventually grew too deep to paper over. He was amazed he'd managed to survive the cutthroat politicking long enough to throw his lot in with Matkovsky.\n\nNoticing his mug was empty, Abramov moved to refill it, he had enough reminiscing for one day, there was work to do."

 magreg.8.t: "The Motherland Beckons"
 magreg.8.desc: "Diplomats from the Siberian National Republic have arrived in Washington in the last few days, meeting with officials from several agencies. Normally ambassadors from the states competing to reunify Russia are seeking diplomatic recognition, trade deals, or weapons, and usually all three. These men have come to America for a different purpose though. With the reunification of eastern Siberia, they report that the process of "stabilizing and rebuilding the Motherland" has begun. Citing this new stability and their long history of cooperation with the United States, they have requested permission to work with several Russian expat organizations in America. Their hope is to encourage Russian refugees and their families to emigrate back to Siberia and "heal the wounds the Nazis inflicted on the Russian people."\n\nNormally we would hesitate to allow representatives of a foreign government to work in the United States with the goal of persuading people to leave the country, but these are not normal circumstances. The Siberian National Republic, despite its authoritarian tendencies, has shown strong interest in aligning with the OFN, and if we play our cards right it could become a firm ally in a region of vital importance. The SNR has a strong opposition to Nazism and Communism, and while it would be easier to work with the Japanese they have instead courted us, and it would be unwise to ignore their overtures. In addition to all of this, the Russian émigré community in the United States is small and it is unlikely many will leave California or New York to return to Siberia. Those who do choose to go would likely return to their homeland either way.\n\nWith the downsides of accepting so far outweighed by the potential risks of rejecting the Russians, it has been decided that we should allow them in. We wish them luck on their mission. They'll need it to convince anyone to trade the greatest nation on earth for some arctic tundra."

He knew his daughter was only seven, and didn't understand the significance of what she'd just said, but she had just made his decision a certainty. He was Russian. His wife was Russian. His daughter had been born in Sacramento and had never been outside of the United States, but as far as he was concerned she was Russian too, and now she was saying Russians were stinky. Had some of the kids at school said that? Knowing their parents, it wouldn't have surprised Igor. They were just like everyone else in this country, always looking at him and Sofia with that uniquely American mix of pity and contempt. He was sick of it. When he'd heard about the Siberian Repatriation Program at the Russian Cultural Center last month it seemed like his prayers for a way out had finally been answered.\n\n"Why do we have to leave America?"\n\n"Because Russia is safe again sweetheart, and now we need to help make her strong again too."\n\n"But I like America.

It was miserably cold outside and the airport's insulation was far from perfect, but he still felt a warmth in his belly. It was the same warmth he felt when he met Sofia after arriving in San Francisco in the ancient year of 1947 or when he'd first held Sasha in his arms in the hospital in Sacramento. There was some indescribable joy in seeing all of the signs and labels written in Russian and confirming that he could still read his first language. Even hearing the chatter of all of the other people at the airport was an unexpected joy. The familiar words and syllables brought back so many memories of better times, before everything had gone south.\n\n"Papa?"\n\nSasha's question snapped Igor back to reality. "I'm sorry sweetheart, what did you say?"\n\n"Why can't we go to Vladivostok instead?"\n\n"Oh." He hesitated for just a moment. "The Japanese control it."\n\n"Darn." Sasha replied.

Every week a few more of those faces would arrive, presenting their passports and documents to customs workers who would wave them through an expedited arrival process. At first it was barely a trickle, but soon that trickle had grown into a stream and the stream into a flood of new immigrants arriving in Magadan, Kamchatka, and Irkutsk.\n\nFor most of these new arrivals this is an opportunity they have waited decades for, a chance to return to the homeland that was stolen from them decades ago. For others it is a chance to start over, to build a new life in a new nation where their past is only as important as they choose it to be. For a few it is a chance to see the Motherland they grew up hearing stories of but never dared visit themselves. With the warlords vanquished and order restored to the east, they can finally see the nation their families loved so dearly.\n\nWith the number of immigrants increasing by the day, more customs agents have been hired and the visa application process has been streamlined to reduce delaying arrivals and integration as much as possible. All across the globe the children of Mother Russia have heard the wonderful news: the nation is rebuilding, and the time for all Russians to do their duty has come at last. Every day more people arrive at our shores to answer the call to action, to build a new life, or even to retake an old one."

 magreg.12.desc: ""Are you almost done with the preparations?" Matkovsky hissed at the scurrying pair of aides- really just RNTP members with nothing better to do conscripted into the task- gathering what little luggage Matkovsky intended to bring as well as necessary papers. As they quickly apologized and redoubled their efforts, Matkovsky huffed and turned back to his desk before him, where he was attempting to complete what work he could before the trip.\n\nIt was hard to imagine that by tomorrow, he would be in America, self-declared land of the free and, much more importantly to Matkovsky, a potentially crucial ally against the Japanese dogs. With the aid of the Americans, celebrations might be held in old great Vladivostok yet, and that alone was reason enough to attempt to form this relationship with Washington. As long as they were of use, the Americans could try to push their senseless ideals onto him all they liked if it made them feel better, not that it would do them any good in the end.\n\nWhen at last his things were packed, Matkovsky gave in with a sigh, putting his pen down and getting up to head to bed. He was too distracted by his thoughts to properly get work done, and he needed to be rested for the meeting. If all went well, Russia would have a very powerful friend in the world, one who could change everything for her."

 magreg.13.t: "A Visit from the Vozhd"
 magreg.13.desc: "Washington's foreign policy bubble is abuzz in response to the news that the US has visitors: a delegation from the Siberian National Republic, a statelet which recently consolidated the easternmost lands of Russia under its control. The star of the show is the so-called "Vozhd", Mikhail Matkovsky, a leader whose cunning and drive are renowned in Russia expert circles. Matkovsky is controversial, however; his critics accuse him of running what is in effect a fascist dictatorship, antithetical to the idea that American foreign policy should seek to uphold democratic values. Less idealistic elements of the national security community point to Matkovsky's pragmatism and anti-Japanese sentiment to argue that the SNR could be a valuable ally, and perhaps one that the United States could influence for the better.\n\nThe Vozhd's visit, announced only shortly before his departure, is expected to last several days, with meeting the President being the high point of the affair. For Matkovsky and his men, long fighting for their lives in the frigid Far East, the Washington D.C. high life may be a dream come true. For liberal politicians, it signals that their country's attachment to democratic values is far more tenuous than it appears, and several Democratic and Progressive congressmen have already made their objections clear.\n\nMatkovsky's goals are still unclear, but the consensus is that he seeks greater political and economic cooperation with the United States, possibly coupled with military aid. While some on the American side may be willing to hear him out, that fact is contingent on whether he is truly open to reforms, or just another despot ruling over the fallen remains of a great power."

 magreg.14.desc: "As its various petty fiefdoms give way to genuine countries, Russia is beginning to open up to the outside world. One of the first stops for any erstwhile warlord on his world tour is the United States, and indeed, the Siberian National Republic's Nikolay Petlin is reportedly making his first state visit to Washington. Petlin's history has already made him popular among the American political class; he first took power by toppling the region's authoritarian strongman, Mikhail Matkovsky, and has promised to further democratic reforms as development continues.\n\nIn the Far East, with few inhabitants and fewer resources than it would like, foreign patronage is a vital political concern. Back at home, all eyes are on Petlin, as closer ties with the United States could greatly strengthen its chances of winning the grand Russian power struggle. Closer diplomatic and economic ties are likely the goal of this meeting, with the Holy Grail of military aid for farther off in the future.\n\nPetlin's chances look quite good; with the exception of a few dissenters who question how far the SNR has truly moved from fascism, most of Congress seems open to the idea of expanding relations, and the President has not signalled opposition. His few days in D.C. could mean the beginning of a mutually prosperous relationship - in the meantime, Petlin might take the opportunity to relax a bit in America's comparatively luxurious capital."

Even as the Vozhd, it was a struggle to find comfortable furniture. The phone conveniently sat on a table right next to him, and he decided to make use of the amenities. "Room service?" A short silence.\n\n"What do you need, Mr. Matkovsky?"\n\n"Give me rum." He thought for a moment. "Cuban."\n\n"That'll be right on its way, sir." A few minutes later, he reclined sipping a drink that had been the stuff of dreams just a few years ago. If Rodzaevsky wasn't dead, he would love to have seen his face. His thoughts turned to the day's events. Things had started off poorly; his welcome on the tarmac that morning was marred by the presence of a group of protestors, shouting all sorts of anti-fascist invective. They were lucky they hadn't met him at home. Mid-afternoon, once he was properly settled in, he met with the President for what turned out to be a very productive series of talks, where they discussed a number of topics ranging from the need for cooperation against Japanese aggression to the possibility of expanding economic ties in the future. To questions about political reform, Matkovsky made vague promises about democratization far off into the future, when the internal situation was more stable. The President was a reasonable person, and would naturally understand the delicacy of such matters. At least, that's what the Vozhd hoped.\n\nThe dinner was sumptuous, and Matkovsky very much enjoyed playing the part of the dignitary. He was particularly pleased to give a toast to a world without tyranny, earning substantial applause from those present. All in all, it had been a good enough showing for the Siberian National Republic's return to the world stage. He felt himself drifting off to sleep, and made one final mental note: find out where he could order a chair like this for his office at home."

Better than Matkovsky would have done, perhaps, but that was low-hanging fruit, and didn't necessarily mean he was successful. Still, he thought as he leaned back into his luxurious seat, feeling his worries wash away, it was a wonder in itself to enjoy finery in a hotel like this. Nothing in Siberia compared. The Americans truly did not know how good they had it.\n\nSpeaking of the Americans, their welcome had certainly warmed him. Russian expatriates and American lovers of democracy alike had cheered his arrival on the tarmac, and Petlin couldn't help but wave to them as he passed with a stupid grin on his face. He felt like a soldier returning home from a victorious war. Once he had been settled in, he had met the President himself for a series of surprisingly productive talks about topics ranging from cooperation against the Japanese aggressors to the expansion of economic ties between Siberia and the United States. When questioned on political reform, Petlin presented a concrete plan of gradual but certain democratization, assuaging the fears of the Americans. Though meeting one of the world's most powerful men in a room had certainly been intimidating, he had turned out to be a reasonable man and soon Petlin's anxieties calmed.\n\nThe dinner that followed the talks was the best meal Petlin had eaten in years, and the applause he earned upon giving a toast to a world without tyranny made him feel like a hero. Petlin felt fairly confident that it made for a strong diplomatic showing to mark the emergence of the Siberian National Republic onto the world stage. Falling asleep where he sat, he began to dream of that feeling of heroism he had quickly come to love."

Although initially put off by the Siberian National Republic's fascist past, the Americans ultimately decided that having an ally in the Siberian region outweighed other considerations. The recent delegation to Washington appears to have been a significant factor in assuaging their fears, and the President signed onto the deal with little opposition from the rest of the government.\n\nThe agreement between the US and SNR outlines significant political and economic cooperation, the expansion of trade between the two countries, a communication line between both countries' leadership, and a number of other provisions ensuring a firm working partnership for the years to come. Surrounded by rivals, such an opportunity could not have come sooner. Long isolated from the outside world, we finally have a lifeline, and one to a superpower to boot! The mood in Magadan tonight will be celebratory indeed, and promotions in the diplomatic staff are almost guaranteed to come soon."

 magreg.16.desc: "News coming out of the United States has dealt a major blow to the Siberian National Republic's efforts to gain recognition abroad, as the recent deal brokered by our leadership has been completely rejected by the President. Despite a visit by an SNR delegation to Washington D.C., the Americans ultimately decided that closer cooperation was not in their interests, either because of the SNR's history as a derivative of the Russian Fascist Party or because they did not see the value of a client in the remote reaches of Siberia.\n\nWith this decision, our future in international affairs becomes substantially murkier. Perhaps the Americans can be persuaded to reconsider their offer when the SNR controls more of the Russian landmass, but for now we must be ready to fight for Russia's future alone. Without a major international patron, our foreign policy has been significantly weakened, with potentially dire consequences. In Magadan, where many people's hopes rode on further connections with the United States, the mood is grim, and many of our diplomats are undoubtedly being chewed out, or worse."

The agreement between our two nations, the American-Siberian Trade Act, formally requires us to grant the Americans access to Siberia's resources in exchange for the immense riches they can deliver in great fleets of ships. The Vozhd, noting the terms of the settlement, was reported to smirk and sit quite comfortably knowing he now has secured formal American support.\n\nBefore long, we expect to see the port stuffed with American vessels hauling tonnes of fuel, arms, supplies, and munitions so we may gain the upper hand against our adversaries in the east. Our time spent foraging for food and stealing equipment from our neighbors in the cover of night is over; we demand prosperity from Siberia and prosperity we shall have!

We are told in Siberia that the battles are tough and the winters are cold, but with American guns and fuel their troubles are sure to be few. With the signature of a document and the shake of a hand, a relationship between the United States and the Siberian National Republic has been cemented in law, and the future of our nations extends down the path of freedom against tyranny wherever it may be found."

Whether it is scrounging up what we can from the pillaged resources of our neighbors, or increasing the appeal of illegal shipping to the Port of Magadan, we must work tirelessly from the ground up.\n\nIn this Russia, crazed with pain, we are once again forced to resort to using smuggled goods and arms from Western and Japanese markets to prop up our republic. Faced by enemies from all sides, our failure to secure American support in our struggle against warlordism and the Siberian wilderness are telling of how truly alone we are in our fight for supremacy in this corner of the world.\n\nWith a firm resolve to improve our misfortune, [MAG.GetLeader] turns his eyes to other markets, local and international, to attract the flow of arms and supplies to our domain. If we are to brave the brutality of the Eastern wastes, the Port of Magadan, our lifeline for our regime's governance over the region, must not run dry of foreign goods."

With a kick-started economy and an army fit to fight, the Siberian National Republic can stand on it's two feet and fight the chaos of anarchy with the support of her international allies. Until then, however, the Russians sit in Magadan praying their calls do not fall on deaf ears, and that support arrives before the Siberian wilderness whittles down their control of the wild Northern continent."

Shaking hands with envoys and international observers, we have most certainly made a name for ourselves throughout the globe and found friends across the great Pacific Ocean.

Thus, we turn inwards, surviving on the limited supplies we can gather from across the wilderness of Siberia.

On the other side of the table sat a representative from the so-called Siberian National Republic, flanked on either side by not-so-subtly armed bodyguards. "Now then." The representative spoke softly, almost quietly, and Aleksandr couldn't blame him. When it came to fighting the Japanese, even the walls may as well have ears. "Shall we discuss our aid to you and your compatriots?" With a quick nod from Aleksandr, he continued speaking. "We are willing to provide arms, supplies, funding, and training to your rebels- everything you asked for from us. In exchange, all we ask is that upon the liberation of these territories, that they be joined with our republic. Do you agree to meet that term?"\n\nAleksandr swallowed. He had had little love for Yagoda's clique in Irkutsk, but he did not place much more trust in the squabbling Harbin exiles. But with the Far East united once again, there had never been a more opportune time to throw a wrench in Japanese operations in Manchuria. It wasn't like he and the rest of the insurgents had much choice in the matter, either; without outside support, they stood little chance against the mighty Japanese occupier.\n\nSo be it.

The RFP had discovered his little effort of resistance. But, apparently, he wasn't important enough for them to spend the effort on disappearing. And so he found himself here.\n\nThe Dalstroy was, ostensibly, a public works program. As he and others were now experiencing firsthand, however, the program was little more than a way to imprison dissidents and other 'undesirables,' while working them to the bone besides. He recognized others who had rebelled, in their own small ways, against the Party. And now they were all beside each other, digging trenches for railway ties.\n\nOne day, he knew, things would change. They had to. But for now, seeing the hard-eyed look of an overseer and wanting to avoid the fate he had seen doled out to others who worked too slowly, he put his thoughts aside and picked up the shovel.\n\nThere was work to be done."
 magreg.25.a: "His abilities used in a more appropriate manner."

 magreg.26.t: "Factionalism Rears Its Head"
 magreg.26.desc: "The recent party congress has triggered a phenomenon previously unheard of in Magadan's halls of power: the formation of factions. As part of Matkovsky's token reforms to the political system, opportunities to express dissent within the National Labor Party have grown, and a number of politicians have decided to take advantage of these to attempt to change the government's course.\n\nMatkovsky's personal faction, the so-called Laborists, remain the largest bloc. An eclectic mix of moderate fascists, national conservatives, and personal loyalists to the Vozhd, this is the status quo wing of the party, advocating a very slow, moderated political reform under the umbrella of a single-party state. Even with the opposition more visible within the state apparatus, the Laborists hold nearly all of the power in practice, just the way that Matkovsky would like it.\n\nIn many ways, reform only generates more appetite for reform, and this certainly applies in Siberia just as anywhere else. Protesting single-party rule, Nikolay Petlin has formed his own Reformist wing of the party, one composed of advocates for a genuinely democratic system. Matkovsky's interest in political change only goes so far; his distrust for Petlin is well known, and the Reformists can be expected to be an underrepresented if loud section of the party.\n\nBringing up the rear is the Old Guard, a practically vestigial wing of the party led by fascist hardliners. As there is practically no desire for a Rodzaevsky-style return to extremist ideals among the populace or the political class, the hardliners are isolated and powerless, mostly made up of obscure, ineffectual figures. Many speculate that they are kept around as merely a negative comparison to Matkovsky's "moderate" rule, and scapegoats for his worst decisions.\n\nThis new era signals unprecedented pluralism as well as unprecedented conflict within the party. Only time will tell if the SNR is significantly impacted by the decision."
 magreg.26.a: "New rifts reveal themselves."
 
 magreg.27.t: "The Grand Sobor"
 magreg.27.desc: "Within his office in Magadan, Nikolay Petlin allowed himself a small smile. For the first time in years he could reasonably say that he was hopeful for the future. After months of careful maneuvering he had convinced Matkovsky to allow a primitive legislative body to be formed. The Grand Sobor was barely worth the name, but it was a start.\n\nThe Vozhd was still the ultimate power in Magadan, as he was not about to give up more than token influence over the nation. In fact, getting Matkovsky to relinquish even what little power that was given to the Sobor was almost miraculous in and of itself, but even so a victory had been scored for the people of Russia, as minor as it was.\n\nIt was clear to Petlin that Matkovsky thought the matter closed, that the token reforms he had allowed would be the end of the discussion. He believed he could simply go back to closing his mailed fist ever tighter around the Russian people, but Nikolay knew in his heart that he had only just begun. The Russian people had suffered for so long and they deserve so much more than a council that would rubber-stamp Vozhd Matkovsky's decrees. It would be difficult, and very dangerous, but he would do all he could to bring about a Russia that its people could be proud of."
 magreg.27.a: "The one step at a time."
 
 magreg.28.t: "By the Will of the Vozhd"
 magreg.28.desc: "In an internal communication sent this morning to senior members of the government, the Vozhd flatly rejected a proposal to establish a legislature, confirming his intention to remain the sole authority - executive or otherwise - within the National Republic.\n\nThe push for a national parliament, led by the so-called 'Reformist' wing of the National Labor Party led by Nikolay Petlin, and envisaged as a revival of the Tsarist-era Zemsky Sobor, was one of that faction's primary goals. It is as yet unknown what the effect of this rejection will be, though many within the party expect it to be significant.\n\nThe Reformists are, as expected, enraged by the decision, but even members of the Vozhd's own 'Laborists' have displayed unease. Though they of course support the absolute primacy of the Vozhd, they see division within the party, especially significant division as evidenced in the response to such decisions, as an inherently destabilizing and worrying trend.\n\nMany are predicting the struggle for power between the factions to only grow more intense and, while others make seemingly futile appeals for unity in the face of the Republic's many enemies, foreign and domestic alike.\n\nIndeed, although to the Republic at large the National Labor Party is a monolithic one, it is becoming clear that the divisions within it are deeper than ever."
 magreg.28.a: "One nation. One ruler."

 magreg.29.t: "What It Means to Be Free"
 magreg.29.desc: ""Welcome back to Radio Free Magadan!" Sergei exclaimed, an ecstatic grin across his face. "I'm sure you must be wondering what I'm so happy about, dear listeners!" A sigh. "Our audience can't see you, Sergei." Vasily's smooth baritone came. "Just get on with it."\n\n"Yes. Yes, of course!" Sergei agreed, as giddy as a child on Christmas. "I'm happy, listeners, because the Siberian National Republic has finally agreed to subsidize us, with our content as free as ever. Radio Free Magadan isn't just freer than ever, it's richer!" Sergei cackled with glee, still scarcely able to believe it. A small, rare smile spread across Vasily's face; he could not blame him, with how hard it was to believe. They truly had come far.\n\n"So, let us thank our generous sponsors by starting off the show talking about them. Sergei?" Vasily motioned for his co-host to speak. "Yes! Recently, I've heard some talk that over in America, people are guaranteed the right to assemble. A right to assemble! Can you believe it, Vasily?" Sergei exclaimed. Without waiting for a response, he continued. "I'm starting to wonder why they don't let us do that here. It could be of great benefit. Just look at how powerful the Americans are!"\n\nVasily considered this a moment, nodding slowly. "You know, Sergei, for once you might have a point.""
 magreg.29.a: "Fascism is a fad, radio is forever."

 magreg.30.t: "Free in Name Only"
 magreg.30.desc: "A teenage girl by the name of Galina Alexandrovna, living a relatively comfortable but ordinary life in the town of Magadan, excitedly rushed to sit down at her family's dining room table, where the radio was located in the center and where her parents already sat. It was time for Radio Free Magadan's latest broadcast, and Galina's family had made something of a family event lately of listening to each broadcast after a long day. Not that there was much else to do as a family around town, but still. "Well, what are we waiting for? Turn it on, turn it on!" Galina's father chuckled at her impatience and complied.\n\nHowever, the voice that awaited them was unfamiliar, and as cold as the Siberian weather. "Good day to all tuning in. As you might have already guessed, the old hosts-" Galina could hear the man's contempt for them in his voice. "Are no longer present. They have been taken away for subversive activities, and as such, the Russian Fascist Party will now be operating Radio Free Magadan directly."\n\nAs if to emphasise his point, two gunshots rang out in the background. After pausing a moment, the new host decided to ignore it, but he did not have to comment on it for Galina to know who had been killed. "I will discuss the news in just a moment, but first, join me in pledging allegiance to our righteous Vozhd Matkovsky. Oh Matkovsky, Vozhd of all Russians, bring glory to-" Galina couldn't stand to listen to another word, and shut the radio off. Her parents looked up at her with concern, but made no attempt to turn the radio back on; there was no need. It was simple to figure out what the rest of the show would consist of, now and for the rest of its existence. They, like their daughter, were horrified at the revelation. However, they were but ordinary people; they were no more powerful in this country than ants under a boot. That was to be the future of all ordinary people, it seemed now, just as it had been in the past: to be trampled on by the boots of tyrants forever."
 magreg.30.a: "The Vozhd killed the radio star."
 
 magreg.31.t: "A Brief Glimpse of Daylight"
 magreg.31.desc: "Nikolay Petlin scraped his fork across the plate for about the fifth time since the last bit of meat had been picked clean. Embroiled in thought, he continued to swirl the bits of sauce and grease that remained as his mind wandered. The taint of fascism was running deeper and deeper in Magadan with every passing day, stretching its tendrils across his fair country and tightening its grip. There was an anger there, for sure, but there was also optimism coupled with the tug of despair. It was his duty to rid what was once a protective measure, now a vile curse, from Harbin and Russia at large. Just as he was about to scrape the plate once again, he heard his wife pipe up from across the table.\n\n"It will work out. I have faith in you," spoke Lydia, already knowing what was tearing at her husband. It haunted her too, in fact. Every facet of Magadan reeked of the RFP and, by extension, her late ex-husband Rodzaevsky.\n\n"Will it? There is so much work to be done, Lydia. Matkovsky rules like a butcher and every day it seems like freedom gets further away and fascism gets stronger," replied Nikolay.\n\n"Someone has to do it, Nikolay. Gladly, that person is you, but you don't have to do it alone. I know these types, hell I was married to one. They're strongmen. Matkovsky is a man who rules by fear and brutality. A force of freedom will always topple a paper tiger like him."\n\n"Thank you," nodded Nikolay. The burden was not entirely eased, but at least he had some measure of reassurance. But moreso, he simply wanted out of the conversation. So, with a stiff upper lip he picked up his plate and placed it in the sink before heading off to his study, his mind abuzz with the same witch's brew of emotions."
 magreg.31.a: "A drop of hope still goes a long way, though."

 magreg.32.t: "A New Beginning"
 magreg.32.desc: "For Nikolay Petlin, the last few days had been a whirlwind of confusion and danger. The tyrant Matkovsky was in chains, arrested in a moment of weakness by a man he had thought so below him to be more a bug than a man. Petlin's supporters held the former Vozhd in a secure cell within Magadan, under close guard. It was almost enough to make him laugh, the sheer luck that had been necessary for the success of the coup boggled the mind.\n\nHis co-conspirators had risked it all to overthrow the Tyrant, and had Matkovsky been, ironically, more like his hated rival Rodzaevsky he would have likely ended Petlin's rebellion before it had begun. Thankfully, his arrogance had blinded him to the threat brewing under his nose. Now, a similar trouble brewed even as he sat overlooking the city.\n\nIn the depths of his new office, Petlin found himself in a very precarious position. While Matkovsky was safely behind bars, support for the Tyrant of Magadan was high in the army and the State Intelligence Agency. It would be a perilous task in and of itself to prevent Matkovsky's supporters from retaking control of the government, but it would be a necessary one. For the people of Russia to prosper, Matkovsky's tyranny needs to be left in the dustbin of history."
 magreg.32.a: "We can finally begin the great work."

 magreg.33.t: "A Lesson Learned"
 magreg.33.desc: "Matkovsky sat in his office, reading documents listing all members of the Reformist wing of the RNTP. He crossed another off the list as a phone call rang in, mentioning another name. One more eliminated. Twenty to go.\n\nHe cursed himself for underestimating Petlin. That backstabber had nearly brought the Vozhd's downfall! Luckily, the fool didn't have enough support for his idiotic coup. Still, it was devasting to Matkovsky to know that someone he trusted, someone he thought of nearly as a friend, would go to all that length just to see Matkovsky fall. Were there more Petlin's waiting in the dark for their chance at power? Were his other advisors planning to take him down? Matkovsky shuddered. He never felt so weak and so undermined. He had to be more cautious. Choosing those who would replace the people he had purged would be a hard job.\n\nStill, this was a lesson to be learned for the future. He would never give away power. No one could be trusted. And most of all, he would never agree to sign off reforms that would weaken his leadership ever again! Only he, the Vozhd, could bring Russia to greatness. Only he could succeed in the crusade against the traitors and the Germans!"
 magreg.33.a: "Long live the Vozhd!"

 magreg.34.t: "A Flight for Freedom"
 magreg.34.desc: "Petlin watched with a small smile from the window of his office as the everyday people of the town of Magadan went about their lives. They were much happier, much more fulfilled now than they used to be, especially when compared to the dark days just after the separation from Rodzaevsky's forces. Those days were long past now, though, and Petlin preferred to think about happier, more current events. One such thing that occupied his mind was his imminent visit to Washington.\n\nIt was amazing that it was actually happening when he thought about it - he hadn't really thought he would be able to do it. Now all that remained was to finish what work he could as hired aides packed his luggage and prepared his papers before he left tomorrow. Petlin could only dream of what finery awaited him in Washington D.C., the great city of democracy. Soon he would not have to dream - he would get to experience it, to enjoy it himself. Once he had, he would get right back to arranging for all other Russians to be able to enjoy that same luxury right here in their own homeland. For now, though, Petlin put those thoughts aside as he stepped away from the window and sat down at his desk to return to his work. Dreams could wait when the work to achieve them could be done."
 magreg.34.a: "Dreams of democracy."

 magreg.35.t: "Medals of Dishonor"
 magreg.35.desc: "Yuri Vitvitsky sat on the hill overlooking the bustling port of Magadan, and reflected on how much his life had changed. On the decision he had made, earlier that morning.\n\nHe had, in his older age, decided to fight for Russia, for the idea that his homeland could, one day, be made whole again. But this had not always been the case. He had, in the past, served a very different master indeed. One that he now opposed in every sense of the word.\n\nThe Empire of Japan had once promised much, and he had not had the experience, the knowledge or, he now realized, the desire to see the insidious purpose in everything they did. It had taken him a long time not only to understand that, but also to accept it. To accept how misled he had been. How, in truth, he had not wanted to see.\n\nReaching into his jacket, he withdrew a small container, and opened it to inspect the contents. Medals. The 'rewards' of long and commendable service to an Empire that did not, had not ever, truly had any respect for him. He had been a tool. But no longer.\n\nWith one last thought of confirmation, Yuri drew his arm back and threw the container as hard as he could, watching as it tumbled end-over-end and, finally, struck the water, sinking below the surface. Behind that spot, he could see a large cargo ship moving towards a pier, no doubt carrying materiel for the state's reunification efforts. The contrast, to Yuri, was striking.\n\nHe had a new master. One he could believe in. One who could show his old one the foolishness of their goals."
 magreg.35.a: "There are new medals to be earned."

 magreg.36.t: "To Protect and Serve"
 magreg.36.desc: "Trofim had not, in his wildest dreams, ever thought he would be wearing the uniform of a police officer.\n\nA longtime member of the Russian Fascist Party, he had spent many years escaping from or avoiding capture by the police of various states. As such, when he had first heard that the Blackshirts were being reformed into a police force, he had thought it a joke. He quickly realized that, as was always the case when the Vozhd proclaimed a change, it was no joke.\n\nAt first, he had not liked the change, though he would not have dared to voice that thought. In the Blackshirts, he had been used to doing what was necessary, without much thought to legal regulations. That was no longer the case. And, yet, he found that he did not mind the rules as much as he once had. Because they allowed him to realize something he had always wanted: acceptance.\n\nWhen people passed him on the street now, after the initial period of distrust of course, they no longer regarded him with constant suspicion and fear. After he had worked to capture some low-level criminals, some had even taken to greeting him. He liked that feeling. He liked feeling that, on some level, he was helping people as he helped his country towards its natural destiny.\n\nHe liked that. And he gave thanks to the Vozhd for the opportunity."
 magreg.36.a: "A surprising change of heart."

 magreg.37.t: "Way the Wind Blows"
 magreg.37.desc: "Former Captain of the Pacific Fleet Dimitri Kirlenko was an old man. He had enlisted in the Soviet Navy when he was a young man and had risen through the ranks with the enthusiasm that could not be matched. When he was first made captain he had been given command of the Rykov-class Cruiser Kalinin. He had fallen in love with that ship, she had been his first and his last command.\n\nWhen the Great Patriotic War came to a close and the Presidium fled to Irkutsk, he had served admirably against the IJN in its last offensive. When Admiral Yumashev took the fleet to Kamchatka he had personally ensured the cohesion of his task force. The Fleet's fall to the Father and Magadan had been the last straw for many of his fellow sailors. Those who didn't find work with the new regional hegemon found themselves drifting and drowning their sorrows in booze.\n\nAs Dimitri looked out at the docked merchant ships in the Port of Magadan he thought about his situation. The new rulers of the Far East turned his stomach. He was forced to do things he had regretted in order to keep the Kalinin and her sisters afloat, but even he could not find it in himself to be generous towards members of the Russian Fascist Party. Looking out towards the horizon he contemplated once again whether or not he should leave the country. Perhaps he would take charter passage on a trade ship to America, or go west deeper into the former Union.\n\nHe wondered whether his old friend Admiral Yumashev would approve of the Siberian National Republic and what it stood for. Would he begrudge his decision to abandon his homeland for greener shores? Would he support him staying in this new country? In truth, he knew it didn't matter. It would all come down to his own decision at the end. Dimitri looked out over the waters of his homeland for one more time, taking in the salt air and the sound of the dockworkers. With tears pooling in the corner of his eyes, he walked to the end of the docks. There was a ship there accepting passengers to the United States."
 magreg.37.a: "The final voyage of an old sailor."

 magreg.38.t: "Starting Fresh"
 magreg.38.desc: "A glass was raised at a table in San Francisco, silencing the indistinct voices speaking in Russian, who looked up expectantly. "I propose a toast," The man holding the glass announced. "To America, to the liberation of Russia, and most of all, to the ruination of the Germans!" Glasses clinked together as cheers went out, and as the dinner party continued with renewed energy, Matkovsky thought that his new life here might not be so bad. True, he still thought that the sooner WerBell choked on his own spit and went to hell, the better off the world would be. Nevertheless, he found he was almost coming to enjoy his time in this great American city of San Francisco. It reminded him of Harbin, almost, and filled him with a nostalgia for those simpler days almost enough to drown out his bitterness over his forced exile. Almost.\n\nThe rest of the émigrés here were quite agreeable and had helped him to get settled in, and in the years since WerBell's thrice-damned takeover, he had become something of a leader to them, hosting widely popular parties and celebrations for the community. Sadly, not many seemed very convinced of fascism, so whatever hopes he had once had of retaking Magadan and giving WerBell his just reward for betrayal quickly evaporated.\n\nStill, this America was quite a nice land, and the regard in which the émigrés held him allowed him to still enjoy some semblance of the power he had once held, so he tried not to dwell on crushed hopes and past adventures. Perhaps, Matkovsky thought, he should write a book, and hope that the next generation or the generation after might finally realize the fascist ideal."
 magreg.38.a: "An old fascist finds happiness, of sorts."

 #Petlin
 petlin.1.t: "The New Republic"
 petlin.1.desc: "Petlin adjusted his glasses as he entered Matkovsky's office, in the old RFP headquarters in Magadan. The place definitely seemed lived in. Shot-glasses with neat whiskey in them, and bottles of vodka just gathering dust littered the desk where the former Vozhd had once sat. Matkovsky likely knew that he was being arrested, and prepared himself accordingly. Petlin just did not expect him to indulge in alcohol, in the twilight hours of his political career. Outside, the wind howled, pounding the window-panes with savage force. Petlin wanted to shiver, but he was not cold.\n\nHe remembered the sight of Matkovsky as the guards hauled him away to prison, awaiting trial. A pair of bloodshot eyes, and a pale face that screamed utter defeat. Once, he had believed that Matkovsky was somewhat of a good man: standing up against the blackshirts and the savage barbarity that was commonplace in Harbin were virtuous deeds. When Petlin proposed the Siberian Bill of Rights, the old Vozhd seemed excited at the prospect of a renewed gesture at political reform. However, right in this office, a few years ago, he remembered as Matkovsky tore at his bill, decrying his ideals as "too liberal." Then came the Dalstroy scandal. Matkovsky was a monster all along.\n\n"No more Harbin," Petlin said, to Matkovsky. "No more the atrocities, no more the ideologies that debase us to the level of beasts." He strode to Matkovsky's favorite gramophone and turned it on. March of Siberian Riflemen filled the air. He picked up an empty shot glass and toasted to comrades long gone."
 petlin.1.a: ""To the memories of Harbin.""

 petlin.2.t: "Hope for Siberia?"
 petlin.2.desc: "Promising reports have reached the CIA from our contacts in the Siberian National Republic. A new government has usurped power from Mikhail Matkovsky's regime, and seems to bear all the signs of a functioning democracy in the making. This new government, headed by one Nikolay Petlin, also seems quite interested in strengthening ties with the US. Requests of that nature from Petlin's government have already reached the State Department, and await our response."
 petlin.2.a: "We could always use new friends."

 petlin.3.t: "Word from Washington"
 petlin.3.desc: "It seems our efforts to strengthen ties with the United States have borne fruit. Our foreign office has received word from American diplomats that they are interested in increasing economic and diplomatic relations between our two nations. All that remains now is to sort out the details, but that shouldn't be too much of a challenge for the Foreign Ministry. This could be the start of a beautiful relationship indeed!"
 petlin.3.a: "Wonderful."

 petlin.4.t: "Exorcising the Shadow"
 petlin.4.desc: ""This is ridiculous, Petlin!" Alexander Pavlov said to him in his office, "the Voz- Matkovsky might have been a criminal, but to abolish his title is a betrayal to our cause." Pavlov sighed. "Let's walk back on this, Petlin, my friend. We must safeguard the legacy of our predecessors. Matkovsky was a good man, and without him, the party would not have reached Siberia. He was a criminal, yes, but all he did, he did for the glory of his motherland."\n\n"I believe you, Pavlov," Petlin replied, his voice calm. "However, comrade, without Matkovsky the Dalstroy would not exist as an entity. The papers," Petlin was exasperated. "The papers in the Irkutsk Presidium. Remember that? The paper trails he'd burnt to cover his trace. The Soviets might not be our allies but their insight is important. Matkovsky is a criminal, and I will see him tried. No trace of his influence shall remain in this - in my - party. I hope you understand."\n\n"Fine. if you would not recognize his existence, then I will not recognize your government." He pointed at Petlin. "Listen, Petlin. I never liked you much in the old days, but now, there is no reason to hold back. You are not my Vozhd, Nikolay Petlin, and I will make sure the Laborists know that. The SIA, too." He stormed out the door.\n\nPetlin was tempted to call out to him, using the American expression. What was it again?"
 petlin.4.a: ""Don't let the door hit your ass on your way out.""

 petlin.5.t: "Criminals No Longer"
 petlin.5.desc: "The bare feeling of legs without shackles was new to Ivanov. The Dalstroy had put him to work digging railways and pointless public works for his association with the NKVD. He toiled, day and night, under starvation rations, sure that he would collapse at any given moment. His body was weak, and the work certainly did him no favors. Ivanov looked at his shoulders and arms. Boney, without much substance nor muscle. The soup they ladled out, thin and unappetizing, did not provide for much sustenance.\n\nThen, armed guards of the Siberian National Republic strode into the camp, arresting everyone. Some of the wardens ran to the woods, after a gunfight with the army. Ivanov heard that the rogue guards had been detained, awaiting trial, same as with their Vozhd. The act startled him. Justice in the depths of the Russian Far East was not unlikely; it was impossible. Yet, there he was, the soldiers casting off his shackles and delivered him away from that hell.\n\nNow, his only concern was that he needed a job. However, surely, President Petlin and his Prime Minister would take care of that. No more shadows, no more domination by powers that only sought power."
 petlin.5.a: "Only Justice."

 petlin.6.t: "Memories of Harbin"
 petlin.6.desc: "The scene was perhaps familiar. Petlin remembered the evenings and nights in Harbin, as the Russian Fascist Party celebrated its zenith. The swastika, the hooked cross ran through by electrified lights, shone like a Christmas tree in the freezing winds of Harbin winters. Yet, they stood, neither fire nor flames warming their hearts, but through the strength of will alone. Love, too.\n\nLove, the strongest of all emotions. It was love that brought them into Russia again. It was love that made them think of Russia when the Japanese and Chinese ignored and discriminated against them. Yet, it was love that also begat Rodzaevsky's obsession with a pure Russia, that justified the Dalstroy's atrocities. As Petlin and the people of Magadan held the candles in the remembrance of such tragedies and feats of will, they closed their eyes and prayed. A choir song soft hymns to God, of forgiveness and repentance. Petlin closed his eyes.\n\nHe remembered his own past. An organizer, of voices that once spoke of him with warmth and looked out for him. Of Matkovsky, of Rodzaevsky - they were young then, and all so foolish. So, so foolish. When he opened them, the patriarch led the flock through the Lord's prayer. Petlin followed."
 petlin.6.a: ""And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.""

 petlin.7.t: "Goodbyes"
 petlin.7.desc: ""Well, Lydia," Petlin said, at the entrance hall to his house, addressing his wife. "I'm off, and maybe for some time. It's going to be a few days, weeks, I don't know. I promise you that I'll be back soon." He regarded his wife with a broad smile on his face. Petlin was proud of her. A dissident in her own right, a powerful and active woman, freed from the clutches of Rodzaevsky the madman. He shuddered to think of what the deranged Vozhd had done to her, but she did not tell of her days in Harbin much.\n\n"See you, dear." Lydia said as she corrected her husband's tie. "Where are you going again? I have been on Magadan for so long that I don't know much about Russia."\n\n"Novosibirsk. The city of the Sun, as they call it, dear. I know that I will be far from you, but this is necessary. Soon, you will leave Magadan, and we shall go westwards. The state cannot hold a government from such a remote position such as Magadan."\n\n"I liked it here, at least."\n\n"I know. We will return here someday when Russia is whole again. Perhaps we'll even cross the straits, into America. See Los Angeles, San Francisco! Maybe even Vegas."\n\nShe smiled, a twinkle of enthusiasm in her eyes."
 petlin.7.a: ""It's a promise, dear.""

 petlin.8.t: "The Assembly of Novosibirsk"
 petlin.8.desc: "The conference at Novosibirsk took place behind closed doors, within the old halls of the city's local presidium. Whatever media that Russia had, as well as some foreign outlets from America, trailed the proceedings. All deputies of the Russian National Labor Party refused to comment. Petlin hurried away on his car before the reporters could reach him, bodyguards shoving the crowds away from him. Whatever that could be gleaned from the discussions within seemed to speak in favor of reformism, although no one knew its details.\n\nFinally, on one crisp morning, Petlin stepped out on a podium, the rest of the Russian National Labor Party behind him. "People of Russia and Siberia," he began, gathering his strength to address a nation. Or half of it. "I stand before you today, the leader of the Siberian National Republic, its President by the will of arms." He paused. "But that will be no longer. I declare thusly: that political parties are now legal, that the government will now seek approval from its people. We dedicate ourselves to the restoration of a democratic and republican Russia." All eyes were on him. "That is all."\n\nCheering broke out as he turned his back to face his party. In the middle of cold Siberia was a small spring of warmth. The media did not know of it, but Petlin smiled at their enthusiasm."
 petlin.8.a: "The Siberian thaw has begun."

 petlin.9.t: "The Siberian Constitution"
 petlin.9.desc: "After his declaration at the end of the Assembly of Novosibirsk, Petlin had gathered independents, laborists, and his own wing of the party together to discuss the specifics of a new constitution to replace the old Bill of Rights. In this, Petlin added provisions that defended the rights of free speech, assembly, and the right to organize politically. The Laborists grumbled and complained, but they did not have sole power on the party anymore. The independents, at first wary of Petlin, soon warmed up to him. Finally, after years of dictatorial rule, a leader who would listen to their concerns.\n\nStanding in the halls of the Novosibirsk Assembly, Petlin remembered the previous years, standing before Matkovsky as the presented his idea of a Bill of Rights before the Vozhd. "Too liberal." The words came back to him. "I am suspecting that you are a socialist, Petlin." He gave a chuckle. How was he so weak? If the same Vozhd returned to him, clad in his full glory, Petlin would not submit. The peoples of Russia have their rights, and he shall not deny them their entitlement. He swore that no one shall experience what had happened in Harbin, ever again.\n\nA couple of Siberian deputies approached him, hammer-and-sickle pins on their suits. Petlin became weary, but then they invited him to dinner. He smiled. Perhaps the communists are not as bad as they say, after all."
 petlin.9.a: "A new democracy is born."

 petlin.10.t: "Enemy, Mentor, Protégé, President"
 petlin.10.desc: ""Do you visit me just to gloat, Petlin?" Matkovsky shot him a venomous look. "When I am dying, you come to me. Foreign Minister, deputy, protégé, but above all, a traitor to our ideals. A traitor to Harbin!" Matkovsky rose from his bed but collapsed right back into it. When Petlin moved to help him, he held his hand out. "I do not need a traitor's help." He coughed blood. "I am close to dying, and I see my vision for Russia burning before my eyes. Its arsonist stands before me, yet I can do nothing."\n\n"Matkovsky," the name sounded strange on Petlin's tongue. "Would those that stand for the memories of Harbin let the pressure heaved upon us against our own people? If a decent man sees the Dalstroy and condemns it not, would it make him true to the memories of labor in Harbin, where women sold themselves on the streets, out of desperation? Tell me that," he held his breath. "Vozhd of all Russians."\n\n"You have no right to address me as such! You lowly worm, lowest of the low. To say that I despise you would be an understatement, Petlin."\n\n"The feeling is mutual, Matkovsky." They stared at each other, too angry to continue the conversation. "Trust me with Russia. I will take care of her well."\n\nA light of sympathy burned in Matkovsky's eyes. "Perhaps. Petlin, if you do not succeed. I will torment you in Hell. Remember that. Now, leave me, Mr. President.""
 petlin.10.a: "Mentor and protégé reconciled within one common wish."

 petlin.11.t: "Home Again"
 petlin.11.desc: "A stiff wind blew as Vitaly slowly but surely made his way towards the door, shivering and wrapping his arms around himself. He was here. He was really here again. After all that time he had spent wasting away in Dalstroy, all that time spent praying death would come for him just a moment sooner. At long last, he was returning to the only place that still mattered to him.\n\nHome.\n\nIt was strange, really, how it had become such an unfamiliar word to him. So long he had spent not daring to speak about it, only barely chancing to think of it on occasion, as though afraid showing too much attachment might condemn them to the same fate. Them. His family. Oh, God, his family. How much had changed in the time he had been away? Would they recognize him? Did they even remember him?\n\nOne, two, three knocks on the door, then he lowered his hand, anxiously waiting for a response. Even a 'go away' would suffice. He just wanted to know that they were alive. Finally, after a short time that felt like forever, the door swung open. "Hello, what can I do for-" The woman who had opened the door gasped, her eyes going wide, as though she had seen a ghost. She may as well have. Oh, how he had missed his wife. Did Sofia still love him, he wondered, as he still loved her?\n\nPast her, Vitaly could see two teenagers walking up, confused as to the commotion. His son, Valentin, and his daughter, Anna. He locked eyes with the former, the older of the two. The boy's face was an eerie reflection of his own, young against old, curious against cautious, fearless against fearful. Had he looked like that, before? What had before been like? He could not remember.\n\nSo, instead, he smiled and said the only thing he could."
 petlin.11.a: ""I'm home, everyone.""

 petlin.12.t: "The Drive Home"
 petlin.12.desc: "The scenery outside the car was beautiful. The thin patches of snow had given way to the budding green grasses of early spring, the buzzing of the bees hummed along the windowpanes of the car, losing their song in the clang and din of the engines. Petlin almost dozed off, and the route home wasn't even that long. Lydia was waiting there. Finally, for the first time in years, they may have peace. Free from tyrants, from false messiahs, and enemies - a quiet, after years of screaming and chaos.\n\nPeople waved to his car as it passed by. Some spat. The evening cast long shadows over the fences and bales of hay, and the final patches of cold dissolved under the somnolent gaze of the setting sun. Petlin sat back, letting the cushions of his seat absorb his weight. He looked at his watch. Still a few minutes before home is in sight. He closed his eyes and let sleep take him. The car juddered and shook, but after a day of work, it made for no finer bed. Petlin smiled at the thought of the evening. Friends, comrades, and his wife at the hearth, as warmth promises to wash over the cold that had submerged them."
 petlin.12.a: "For this evening, and many more to come."

 petlin.13.t: "Siberian Sports"
 petlin.13.desc: ""...you should also have a look at the Krasnoyarsk hockey team," Foreign Minister Yuriy Vlasov said, pointing to Krasnoyarsk on a map of Siberia for the businessman in the Magadan hotel room they were sitting in, "Yes, they are in a very far off location, but they are very tough and hardy nonetheless, and they will make excellent athletes if given the proper training."\n\nThe businessman in question, Jason Morrison, stared at the map.\n\n"Are you sure it'll be worth it?" he asked after a long pause.\n\n"Of course! With American money in the team's coffers, they'll have the coaches and equipment they need to be stars on the international trade! Starostin, am I missing anything else?" Vlasov replied.\n\nMorrison looked at Starostin.\n\n"The city of Krasnoyarsk has fallen on hard times, and the sports team is no exception," the economic minister said, "If you invest, even to something as ephemeral as sports, it'll go a long way to getting the city back on track to being one of the greatest industrial cities in Siberia."\n\nAnother pause followed as Morrison considered the city's value, and the team.\n\n"We'll start at a hundred grand a month. If the team shows signs of improving after three, I'll increase it to two."\n\nThe room muttered in agreement as the two ministers parted the room together. It was important for a new nation like Siberia to get as many powerful allies as it could. While sports may seem trivial, that businessmen were willing to invest in a field like this was a sign that much closer ties to the US would be made in the coming months."
 petlin.13.a: "And, perhaps, the citizens may benefit from such bonds as well."

 petlin.14.t: "The Old Admiral"
 petlin.14.desc: "Ivan Stepanovich Yumashev walked through the streets of Petropavlovsk in the early hours of the morning. The former admiral observed the people as they went about their business. Men and women on their way to factories and shops, parents and children hurried about to grocers to fill their pantries, and some simply sat on benches and observed the passing of the day. A smile broke out on his face when he saw a young soldier guide a scared child back to her parents.\n\nEvery once in a while a former sailor of the Pacific Fleet would approach him and they would talk of life since the dark days in Kamchatka. The younger would boast of pregnant wives and new children and the elders of grandchildren and the relatively easy lives they live now. The Admiral always took time to speak with these men, to hear their problems and their triumphs. When his men needed help, he would do his best to give it and when all they needed was an ear to listen he was all too happy to do so.\n\nIvan eventually found his usual haunt. A small bench under the shade of a great old pine tree facing out into the waters of the Pacific. As he sat, he thought back to the old days. The days after the end of the Great Patriotic War, as the Pacific Fleet slowly but surely came together in Petropavlovsk. He remembered the hard times when the fleet, once the pride of the Union in the East, were forced to prey on shipping lanes in order to survive.\n\nHe thought back to the Divine Mandate's fall to the fascists of the National Republic, the very same republic he now lived in. It was a strange time for the fleet, as the fascists were soon ousted from within by the current President. Now, as he gazed out at the waters of the Pacific he could not help but think how lucky they had been. Disaster had been averted when Petlin and his supporters ousted the Vozhd and restored the rights of the people. It was strange to think of the origins of this state, but he would say that it was a worthy one. A state he had come to truly feel at home in."
 petlin.14.a: "A home for the lost."

 #Matkovsky
 matkovsky.1.t: "A New, Winter Dawn"
 matkovsky.1.desc: "Matkovsky had been here before, in the misty days where Magadan constituted his only territory. His office was cleaner, his vodka more expensive, and the stationary both more reliable and better to grip. Yet, the old Harbin feeling never left him. He looked at the window, seeing petals of snow unfurl and split in mid-air, the howling of the winter winds dying against the glass-panes. Some flakes stuck, but they slid down, leaving a trail of clear liquid behind them.\n\nHe turned his attention to the list. Sheets upon sheets of names, blotted out in the order of their execution. At the top of the list was his enemy: Nikolay Petlin. The name was crossed out, but in truth, Matkovsky did not know where he went. Still, it was preferable to keep his absence in a more permanent state. Nikolay Petlin was dead, and that was all that mattered.\n\nAides came and went by his room, carrying a chill with them, shivering as they handed out reports of the purge to the Vozhd. "Hey," Matkovsky said to a lanky, blond aide. "Turn that gramophone on." The roar of music and the howl of the winds masked the gunshots, out in the Siberian wilds."
 matkovsky.1.a: "A Vozhd's work never ceases."
 
 matkovsky.2.t: "A Siberian Bill, Renewed"
 matkovsky.2.desc: "Once upon a time, the Vozhd of the Russians entrusted his loyal follower to write a constitution for him. The minister in charge was Nikolay Petlin: the traitor, the man responsible for the poisonous current of liberalism that ran in the Vozhd's party. His venom corroded Matkovsky's hold, like venom hissing upon contact with steel. The Vozhd was a merciful man, full of lenience. Yet, he could never let this sort of thing occur ever again. Not the least when he was this close to power.\n\nSo, he would have to be strict. He had entrusted the Russian before with the powers of political liberties and free speech, yet, they betrayed him. Tonight, by himself and a candle-lit room, Matkovsky would bind together a Siberian Bill of Rights. A new one, with none of the flaws of the old. He had to. If the Russian people and dissidents of the party would defy him, he found no better alternative than self-defense.\n\nHe would start by cutting. The former Bill of Rights was too long, too wordy, too ponderous. It spent a lot of its length clarifying useless liberties that could threaten the party's position. Matkovsky did away with them striking provision after provision with slashes from his pen.\n\nWhen morning light spilled from the windows to his desk, he rose, a new Bill in his hand. The Vozhd smiled, his work done."
 matkovsky.2.a: "Never shall the mistake be repeated."
 
 matkovsky.3.t: "Voter Rolls"
 matkovsky.3.desc: "When his village announced the new voting rolls for his district, Aysen was excited. Perhaps the Vozhd of the Russians would not be the leader of Russians alone. Yet, he, with the rest of the Sakha people living there, found their names absent from the board. Aysen's eyes looked over the A section, over and over again, sure that there was a mistake. It was blank as if the local officials had skipped over him.\n\nSo, this day, he came to the offices of the electoral commission, seeking to complain. Aysen was rightfully a citizen of the state, and he would not see his rights violated. Inside the log-built wooden building was a burly man who attended a thin slab of plank for a table. Two guards, armed with rifles and pistols, stood on the opposite corners of the room. A door was at the back, leading further into the innards of the office. Approaching the man, Aysen said, "Sir, I am sorry for interrupting your work, but my name is not on the voting roll."\n\nThe man smirked. "Are you Yakut?" he said. Aysen nodded. "My, my." He barked at the guard in Russian, who went to the backs of the office and summoned a paper form, composed of five to six sheets. "Fill this form and do the test. I will decide if you can vote."\n\nAysen spoke Russian, but not this kind of Russian. Scientific nomenclatures, technical terms, so many things he could not understand. The form was a literacy test, he realized. A way to cheat the Sakha people from their right to vote. Still, he filled the form with every ounce of knowledge in his mind and handed it to the man.\n\nAn affected disappointment. "I am sorry, but you can't. Perhaps once you've studied a bit more, you would be able to do so. However, as it stands, I can see nothing good coming out of you voting." A smile. "No offense." Aysen left the office fuming, but also frustrated."
 matkovsky.3.a: "The Party needs competent voters."
 
 matkovsky.4.t: "Status Report"
 matkovsky.4.desc: "A report was thrown on Matkovsky's desk from the State Intelligence Agency, spilling out sheets of paper and dossiers filled with printed reports and graphs. On its cover, it read 'THE SITUATION IN THE WEST' - gathered intelligence providing a comprehensive oversight of the warlords and bandit republics clashing in Central Siberia. The Vozhd gave the papers a long and skeptical stare, before reaching over and carefully flicking through each page.\n\nHe scoured over each sheet, examining the details of every Bolshevik brigand and opportunist despot rampaging throughout the icy region. Like animals, they skirmished with each other for scraps of food and resources in the frozen plains to the west. Finally, the Vozhd came to a page detailing various strategic and logistical plans for a possible annexation and integration of the region, and his eyes began to glow.\n\nHis authoritarian ego nourished, Matkovsky smirked and tossed the document back on his wooden desk. He leaned back in his chair and reflected upon the proposal, exciting his senses with all kinds of plans to march westwards."
 matkovsky.4.a: "This is only the beginning."
 
 matkovsky.5.t: "In the Interests of National Security"
 matkovsky.5.desc: "The Vozhd, upon realising control over much of Eastern Siberia, has returned his attention to matters of state security. After all, in order to have a stable republic, he explains, it must be protected from within and without. Thus, it has been determined that the State Intelligence Agency is to have far greater autonomy from legal restrictions and the authority to conduct operations that will safeguard our nation against subversives and revolutionaries.\n\nDoors are kicked down, homes are raided, hundreds are arrested, and traitors are shot. In the name of national security, there can be no margin of error. The Vozhd cannot afford to let this young republic, this great hope for Russia, fall to seditious villainy from the dark corners of the eastern wastes. The siberian wilderness is unforgiving, and for the crime of treason, Matkovsky is too."
 matkovsky.5.a: "We will take no chances."
 
 matkovsky.6.t: "Fair Elections"
 matkovsky.6.desc: "There were three names on the ballot for the Tomsk-12 constituency. Two were the candidates of the Russian National Labor Party, who had all the support the party could give them. Time in the local radio, campaigning funds, and the posters with their names that stuck on seemingly every window-corner of a Tomsk street. The Peace Preservation Act had mandated strict ideological requirements for political parties, effectively disqualifying any of the Tomsk Salons from running.\n\nThe other candidate was an independent, a former Bastillard. He entered the elections knowing full well that he was at a disadvantage. None of the old Salons could help him. Radios and newspapers refused to give him interviews. He had some discreet money funneled through by his old pals in the Bastillards, but that itself was a dangerous proposition. Should the authorities discover them, he would be charged with fraud and disqualified from the election. So he did what he did in his Bastillard days: standing on street-corners trying to insult people enough to pay attention to him. Some days, he could have a conversation. Others, the police hauled him away, naming him a "public pest."\n\nWhen the votes were tallied at the end of the day, the result was unsurprising. Ninety-five percent voted for the RNTP candidates, the rest going to the independent."
 matkovsky.6.a: "Without political cause, there can be no political resistance."
 
 matkovsky.7.t: "Volunteer Work"
 matkovsky.7.desc: "After the primaries, Alyosha spent his days milling about the town of Amur, doing odd-jobs and nothing in particular. He had spent a fortune to enter the Russian National Labor Party, only to be defeated in the primaries. Alyosha's politics were liberal: he had hoped to join the RNTP with the express purpose of reforming it from within. Now, bereft of money and opportunities, his days went by too slowly but also too quickly, like candles.\n\nIt didn't take too long for the SIA to find Alyosha. He was not a discreet man, and his behavior had attracted attention. Just as he entered a bar to drink his worries away, two men, one thin and tall, one stocky and beefy, tapped him on the shoulder. "Mr. Alyosha?" they said, "Could you please come with us? We are from the party. We need to talk."\n\nAt first, Alyosha was hopeful. Maybe the Vozhd saw potential in him as a politician and had sent these two men to give him a second chance. However, his flights of fancy were brought down by the weight of gravity when he realized that these two men were probably from the SIA.\n\nTaking him to a quiet street corner, they interrogated Alyosha on his faith for the Russian people, before asking him to volunteer in the Dalstroy. His face paled, but he had little choice. "Yes," he said. "Yes.""
 matkovsky.7.a: "If one cannot serve in the political arena, mayhaps one can serve as a laborer."
 
 matkovsky.8.t: "Concessions from the Vozhd"
 matkovsky.8.desc: "Phoning-in this morning, we have received firm assurance from Mikhail Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the Siberian National Republic, that efforts towards the strengthening of their free republic have recently undergone significant improvement. We have insisted in the past that if they want to hear anything from the United States, they too must show their dedication to the rights of men, to which they have appropriately adjusted and committed themselves to.\n\nMatkovsky presented evidence to suggest that the treatment of minority groups has improved from the Russian ruling establishment. Moreover, we are assured that liberties guaranteed in law have been respected by the state and law enforcement across the nation. Indeed, our own few diplomats across the Pacific have given us the thumbs up after being taken on a tour of Siberia by dozens of state officials to see the great potential of the region, not giving us a single tip for anything worthy of criticism in the young republic.\n\nMatkosvky was slow in his replies when we questioned him, but we have faith he will follow through on his promises. Until then, we will continue our diplomatic missions to discover more about the mysterious eastern republic now cozying up to us."
 matkovsky.8.a: "Lip service? Must be an American term."
 
 matkovsky.9.t: "Rangers Lead the Way"
 matkovsky.9.desc: ""AND HALT!"\n\nThe ranks of Siberian Rangers stopped their march, and a great crash echoed throughout the encampment as the soldiers stamped their boots. They stood in regimented columns, upright in rows and awaiting Captain Oleg's next command. These were the new recruits and they had been undergoing viscous training in the wilderness of Siberia to acclimatize them to the bitter eastern chill. Training was harsh, and the officers harsher, but such strict order could carve these men into warriors worthy of the Vozhd's command.\n\nResisting the harsh Siberian cold, they stood still as Captain Oleg walked past and examined each recruit. He looked at each one of the men in the eye and studied their posture. His gaze was piercing and intimidating, his very stare disciplining any sense of disloyalty in the young men's hearts. Captain Oleg reached the end of the column, to which he raised his hand for a moment and the recruits lifted their rifles to their side in synchrony. With his back turned to the recruits, the collective clatter of the rifles reminded Captain Oleg of his early days in the military, and he gazed back at the men to notice they were far more skilled than he was. He smiled beneath his bushy mustache and chuckled for a moment, before returning to his cold and unforgiving gaze."
 matkovsky.9.a: "To live and die in the snow."
 
 matkovsky.10.t: "Grim Tidings"
 matkovsky.10.desc: "Matkovsky sat in his office, drinking wine. Finally, after all these years, a vintage worth its legacy. Warm, sweet, it made Matkovsky tipsy and slightly drunk. The gramophone from Harbin sat in the corner of the room, blaring nostalgic songs: patriotic marches, anthems, Tchaikovsky. The sweet tunes and melodies of his youth brought back memories of him as a teenage boy in the Paris of the East. Finally, all that suffering, all that pain, was worth it.\n\nA knocking on the door, a disturbance to the rhythm. His doctor came through the door, lathered in an icy sweat. His glasses seemed to tremble as he walked forward, his eyes averted from Matkovsky's face. "S-sir," he said, stammering, fear apparent in the crashing of his teeth, "I-I bring you bad news."\n\nLeanig back on his grandiose chair, Matkovsky spoke. "What kind of bad news, doctor? Can't you see that the Vozhd is having a good time? Can't it wait? Surely you do not dare risk my wrath."\n\n"N-no, sir. It absolutely cannot." Swallowing, he continued. "I am afraid you are afflicted with cancer, sir."\n\nFor a moment Matkovsky sat still. He could not believe what had traveled through the doctor's lips. Cancer? Him? At the peak of his life, at this very moment? Lies! Lies! He stood up, calmly, wine glass in hand. Matkovsky jerked his arm back and forward again, catapulting the glass into the doctor's suit, splattering him in red. He wanted to shout, to scream, but he had to be calm.\n\n"Guards! Guards! Take this man away from me!" Boots trampled into the room. "Volunteer him for Dalstroy work. Make sure he is thoroughly educated. Understand?" Nods. "Dismissed." They carried the doctor out, and sobbing trailed after their departure."
 matkovsky.10.a: "There is nothing wrong with the Vozhd. Nothing at all."

 matkovsky.11.t: "A Winter Sonata"
 matkovsky.11.desc: "Matkovsky stared at the papers before him. Holding a side of his stomach, he groaned in pain every time he shifted his weight. The doctor wasn't lying after all. Cancer had come to him, throbbing, pulsating within his belly, a tide of pain that scarcely any painkiller could stem. His new doctors had suggested trips to America. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy - or whatever the hogwash it is these days - could help. Not now. A Vozhd of the Russians should rule from Russian soil, and not delegate his tasks to subordinates while he cavorts with foreigners on strange shores.\n\nMatkovsky inclined his head to the window beside his bed. The snow was falling, layering the frigid air in a cloak of white. Grains of it tossed and turned to the wind's whims, and a hollow rasp whistled as it brushed against the palace's walls. He closed his eyes and listened. Far below, in the kitchen, the voices of the maids and servants raised in curious gossip became indistinct whispers punctuated by shrill notes of laughter. Above, the wooden planks of the attic creaked as they moved Matkovsky's old possessions there. The gramophone, personal mementos, and the stack of Russian marching songs, preserved in perfect record.\n\nHe sat up. The pain was intense, and he gritted his teeth. Swinging his feet to the side, he prepared to stand. One hand on the bedpost, he lifted himself, straining against the mass of shock that seemed to emanate from nowhere. Yet, he did not scream. Then, the Vozhd stood in his opulent bedroom, his knees about to give way under the weight of the agony. Matkovsky took a deep breath and started to walk. He could use a drink."
 matkovsky.11.a: "Everything begins again."

 MAG_WA_the_republic_of_west_alaska: "The Republic of West Alaska"
 MAG_WA_the_republic_of_west_alaska_desc: "We have done the unthinkable. WerBell and his army of mercenaries have deposed the no-money, tin-pot tyrant Matkovsky from his seat in Magadan. His former friend, the Bandit King of the Far East, Rodzaevsky, joined him soon after. The world now waits with bated breath as WerBell founds the first state for soldiers of fortune. Eschewing the naming conventions in Russia, he has taken to naming his new homeland after the region closest to his old one: West Alaska.\n\nHowever, the new Republic needs to establish itself in this foreign land. The mercenary army shall reinforce the regions of Amur and Magadan, to root out any fascist opposition against us in the area. WerBell shall invite young men, from the villages and towns of the sparsely populated Far East, to join the soldiers without borders. A new page has appeared in the history of Russia, whether it goes on to become its own chapter, or remain a footnote, remains to be seen."

 MAG_WA_greater_ambitions: "Greater Ambitions"
 MAG_WA_greater_ambitions_desc: "WerBell has founded his state. The fascist dissidents in the countryside have either joined us or chosen death to join their puny little Vozhds. However, there is one more problem. The point of no return has passed, and we have condemned ourselves to dig this stretch of barren land until we either strike gold or die trying. We have to shoot the stars with a bullet left in the cartridge. Despite all the odds, all of us have agreed: it is a bet worth taking on.\n\nLet us lift the curtains of Magadan and Amur and gaze upon the rest of the Far East. This land may be sparse and deserted, but there is no shortage of gains to be made for the sharp-eyed mercenary. What are we, then, but a bunch of the world's craftiest bastards? We look to the north, past the Tsarists, and see a land full of milk and honey: the diamonds of Yakutia and the gold of Aldan beckon. Surely more than an average soldier's paycheck, isn't it?"

 MAG_WA_bury_the_past: "Bury the Past"
 MAG_WA_bury_the_past_desc: "One time, we had a job in Central America. Some dickhead wanted us to put down these dirty motherfuckers who were blackmailing his company. We did the job and then, can you believe it, the guy tried to renege. He tried to weasel his way out of the contract, a solemn oath made before man and God, to pay us for our provided services. We won't say what happened to him but, well, we got our money and no one had to worry about him ever again.\n\nSame principle here: We have all these asshole RFP veterans. They've never liked us. They never wanted us around. They made no secret of their intent to swindle us and have betrayed us in either body or in mind. It's time to show people the consequences of that traitorism. Fuck any boons that collaboration might bring. It's time to show that we're not aligned with these brownshirt morons but are, instead, committed to burying that past."

 MAG_WA_the_fate_of_the_tsar: "The Fate of the Tsar"
 MAG_WA_the_fate_of_the_tsar_desc: ""Tsar" Mikhail's presence in the Far East was nothing more than a series of unhappy accidents. An Australian by birth, he heeded the invitation to join a dinner party in Siberia, not knowing that he was the only claimant to do so. Later on, the Tsarists found, much to their shock, that Mikhail, in actuality, held no legitimate claim to the Russian throne. His father's non-dynastic marriage ensured that he is illegitimate at best, a usurper at worst.\n\nStill, we must decide what to do with him. WerBell has taken the luxury of treating the prince with generosity. The kid is no threat. However, he may still have his use. Hailing from a well-off family, perhaps we can ship him back to Australia in a flash, using our delivery services to make sure that he will be right as rain when he gets back. Of course, such premium transport should earn us a little more than a pat in the back. We'll call his family and tell them to keep in touch."

The issue is, well, it boils down to their circumstances. See, these potential recruits come from backgrounds dissimilar to our own. Some are fishers, some are traders. Some have not even seen a rifle in all of their lives. With such a feeble base of knowledge, they would only become burdens in the upcoming battles in Siberia.\n\nFortunately, the recent conquest of Chita has provided WerBell the opportunity to tap into what little personnel that the Far East can give him. He plans to build a new training academy for all Russians intending to join his host there. Our veterans and senior officers shall staff this new educational establishment, ensuring that no recruit goes into a war not knowing which end of the gun they should point toward the enemy."

In any other circumstance, we would not have gone after them this quickly, however, their lands contain something much more valuable than workers or industrial capacity. Tales of diamonds and riches stemming from its trade travel south, eventually reaching the ears of WerBell. With the booming size of our armed forces, these jewels would be useful in procuring pay for the incoming mercenaries.\n\nThe plans for our next step is clear. We are attacking the Republic of Yakutia, not out of spite or personal grievances, but necessary pragmatic interests. Without ideological support and only guarded by local militiamen and outlaws brought over with the promises of high pay, Yakutia will not be much of a challenge. The issue is time: the other powers of the Far East will set their sights upon this land soon, and if we are not quick, this chance could be lost forever."

With the number of workers and equipment that are there, we can expand our army as well as raising the wages of the soldiers currently in our pay. However, as an American, enough is insufficient for WerBell. There must be a way to squeeze more out of the captured resources, and luckily for the Republic of West Alaska, he already has a plan in his mind.\n\nThe crucial issue of the first new operations was that there were no markets receptive enough to its supply nearby. WerBell can rectify this problem. He will call executives and his acquaintances across America, and all will swarm him for the stock from his newly-found fortune. He will cut them a deal: slightly lower prices for the newest, state-of-the-art equipment. After all, we are running a business, not a charity here in West Alaska."

With the current output, we can feed and pay our existing mercenary companies with a little more comfort than before. However, phrases like "little more" are not enough for men like WerBell, and if his ambition were to reach as far as he wants it to, he would need perhaps a thousand times more.\n\nFrom the ashes of their short-lived independence, we shall claim the riches of the earth. Our men will go from every village and town in West Alaska, forming labor battalions from the wide-eyed young men who are always thrilled to join our little operation. Then, they will work in the mines, with the same rates as it was under the Republic of Yakutia. Who knows, if they are good enough, perhaps they can prove their worth and join the real mercenary companies someday."

Unbeknownst to Matkovsky, WerBell's relations to this lucrative market did not stop at rifles alone. Artillery guns, uniforms, supplies, and other essential tools of war: if you can name it, WerBell's got it, and at a cheaper rate too.\n\nWith the limited industrial capacity in the Far East due to the Reds' negligence during the Soviet period, WerBell now has to pull all the stops in ensuring that his army of soldiers without borders stays well-equipped and ready to attack at any time. No number shall go uncalled, no associate go unpressed, all shall go into the duty of making sure that West Alaska stays afloat for as long as possible. The remnants of the Reds and the Father's forces may seem small and insignificant, but it is better to be safe than sorry."

Thankfully, we have just the thing.\n\nWe shall build Firebase Moses, a forward operating base planted at the very edges of our political and practical control. From there, our troops will inform the high command of any slight changes in the composition and positioning of our enemies' divisions. Half the battle is knowing yourself, Sun Tzu once said, and the other is in knowing your enemy. With this move, we have made one more guarantee to our success here in the Far East."

Even though they have fought throughout the world before, our soldiers find themselves pushed to their limits, coming out on top despite the lopsided odds in numbers, equipment, and motivation. Luck has blessed WerBell with the most hardened soldiers of this world.\n\nHowever, we are not interested in mere "good." From the ranks of his current soldiers, WerBell shall pick and choose whoever he favors and believes to be the quintessential elite soldier. He shall assemble them to a single unit. Their pay will be higher, and their only occupation the preparation for war. When the time comes, these soldiers will push themselves forward, further than any man can; they will become the Dogs of War."

After our conquest of Magadan, however, many have taken quite an interest in our work. If we are to, say, put a call outwards to rally the mercenaries into our lands, we would receive quite a lot of applications.

West Alaska must expand deeper into Siberia, to the territories west and north. WerBell shall not rest until he has the whole of the Far East in his hands.\n\nFor our expansion plans, we have three avenues that we can pursue. First, the Reds, to the west. It appears that there are conflicts within their ranks as to the rightful successor of the Union, but it matters to us very little. We will crush both of them. To the north, we have the Father and his forces of peasant militia, who are no problem for our elite mercenaries to handle. Whichever we choose, the momentum of West Alaska must not stop."

The gist of the situation is that the Buryats, under former NKVD commissar Valery Sablin, have disagreed rather violently with the President of the Presidium, Genrikh Yagoda. Holding some lofty ideas, as young men are often prone to, Sablin claimed a radio tower amid Buryatia and proclaimed his ambitions: to unify Russia and restore the Soviet Union. Yagoda was not pleased by this and declared Sablin and his ilk revisionists.\n\nHowever, their ideological split does not matter to us. The factories of Irkutsk, as well as the broadcast system in Buryatia, are valuable assets to the people of West Alaska. We do not care whether or not Sablin or Yagoda is right; the fact of the matter is, they are sitting on our rightful soil; if they would not leave, we will then evict them."

Also, he is sitting on the most populated cities of the Far East, a juicy target for us. If we can dispose of him and claim these cities for our use, we will expand the recruitment pool of our army, as well as the industry to craft our weapons of war.\n\nYagoda will never see it coming. We shall strike hard and fast, disorganizing his forces, like a thunderbolt cutting the sky in half. The NKVD is, unlike the rest of the Far Eastern armies, proper soldiers, not militias: to take them down we will need the element of surprise. Rest assured, we will do what we do best. Yagoda shall forever grace the footnotes of history."

The state manages all things and distributes the wealth accordingly among the populace, certain biases notwithstanding. The NKVD sought to protect this way of living all this time. A system that might have guaranteed equality among all that participate in it, but one that stifles growth and individual merit. WerBell personally could not stand what he sees as the stagnation inherent within this system.\n\nThis must change. We will disband all the institutions of communism in Irkutsk. No more communism; only capitalism. All that reside there will discover a new, better way of life: the American lifestyle. To live, one must work, innovate, and interact with the market. We will go to the outskirts, purging the rest of the NKVD, making sure that they will never return. After all, this is done, the people of Irkutsk shall be grateful to WerBell for freeing them from the shackles of the past."

Raised in different circumstances, the two men couldn't have been more distinct from one another. WerBell is a mercenary, and Sablin is a dissident NKVD commissar. Where WerBell sees communism as an un-American thing and therefore seeks to destroy it, Sablin sees hope and reform waiting at the end of his long road to power. However, both are bound in the same childish idealism: WerBell for his soldier state, and Sablin for the eventual renewal of his homeland.\n\nHowever, we shall not let out similarities to keep us from proving whose ideals will triumph in the end. Sablin knows as well as we do that the Far East is a do-or-die land. It's either him or us. We must safeguard our ideas against him, and by making the first move, we will gain the upper hand. WerBell respects Sablin, but his own survival is paramount."

At age twenty-three, he has ruled over a land of his own, and his ideas, along with his firm, resolute faith in them have carried him this far. The people of Buryatia loves Sablin and his ideology, willing to die for his dream of a union of the proletariat, hearkening back to the times of Lenin and the old Revolution.\n\nHowever, what he had made was not a nation of soldiers, but dreamers. In the end, their vision of a new and better Union did not pan out as well as they had expected. These young people have no business running a country. We shall throw all the reforms, alongside the institutions they're meant to apply to, straight into the dustbin of history.

Unfortunately for the occupants of Aldan, we have decided to make their little cottage ours, and the gold that they house our pay.\n\nWe ought to show to the people of Aldan how mercenary companies are run and operated. We project that we will be meeting very little resistance on our way to defeat the town. However, as is the case with Yakutsk, the primary issue is not that of difficulty, but time. We would need to be quick, before the Reds and the Father can even think of making a move against those gold mines. Once the conquest of Aldan is complete, we will sell their gold through our diamond networks and make some nice money off it."

He seems to be a Christian Anarchist, who, ironically for one of Orthodox disposition, holds unorthodox ideas of Christianity. From the reports of Firebase Moses, this force is mighty indeed; perhaps the strongest that we may fight in the Far East aside from the Reds in Irkutsk and Buryatia.\n\nThe war against him will no doubt take a toll on our personnel count and time. However, making the first move will perhaps get us the leg up needed to succeed in crushing his forces. Regardless, many within our ranks are feeling antsy with braving such a vast and motivated force. We have seen insurgents all over the world; that is the reason we ought to succeed."

As he travels south, however, many joined him, willing to give their lives for the Kingdom of God as envisioned by Alexander Men. These peasants, although untrained, are numerous. However, by relying on these, Alexander Men has made a crucial mistake: all it needs to shatter his base of support is to win over their hearts and minds.\n\nIt boils down to that, then: a war of propaganda. From our radio stations in Magadan, we shall shout for the liberation of the Far East from the tyranny of that heretic. Our soldiers will perform infiltration raids into enemy territory, distributing rations and food in exchange for information and intelligence. Without his base of support, the Father is nothing; his house of cards shall fall, tumbling into the dark."

Our soldiers, assembled from the greatest mercenaries the world has ever seen, are faring relatively well, considering their numbers and our circumstances. However, there is a problem. We are fighting in the enemy's favored area. The rough terrain, combined with the harsh weather, makes it difficult for soldiers to resupply amid the chaos of the lines. Not to mention, the lack of infrastructure and roads ensures that no trucks would pass unmolested through the Siberian woods.\n\nWith the amount of punishment that the Father is giving us, we need to secure that a steady supply of ammunitions and guns make it through the frontlines. We will attempt to replicate the enemy's techniques and methods, adapting their system to better suit our way of conducting war. Fast runners, new roads and routes, as well as reassurances up and down the line that supplies are incoming should do the trick. After all, this is not the first rodeo for many of our soldiers."

However, there is still a persistent problem: the Father in the north holds an advantage in personnel that we could not quite match. At the portions of the line that we hold, fending off the militias proves to be a doable task. There lies our problem: there are not enough of us to keep the peasants from breaking through sections of the front left unguarded.\n\nIf we let them continue as they please, they will whittle us down to nothing. WerBell has no plan prepared for his loss, however. The answer to his predicament lies in acting in complete contradiction to the enemy's expectations: he shall attack. By making quick, decisive strikes against the weak parts of their lines, we can overwhelm them and isolate their divisions, neutralizing any threats they may have. These peasant rabbles may be many, but cut off from supplies of food, they can do nothing except surrender."

He is honest; the Father for him might as well be an alien from another world, come here to preach a strange faith.\n\nThe Romans, however, might hold the secret to that solution. Damnatio memoriae: the Father does not exist and has never existed. We may not have close relations with the Church, but with enough badgering, they should cave and declare that Men is a heretic. We will need to herd the masses away from the ideas of the Father, no matter how worthy they are of realization.

Triumphing over all the other traditional powers of the area - the fascists, communists, and the Father in the North - he has arrived at a position to establish a new kind of state. A haven for mercenaries, the rootless citizens of the world rendered useless by the lack of conflicts.\n\nNo longer shall these concerns plague them: for all who lack work, the Republic of West Alaska shall provide.

It would be a shame to let all of it go to waste, would it not? In a land where the Republic has no allies, it must find some, and, failing that, make some. To survive, one must concede.\n\nThough the fascists, Nazis, and the pinko-communist lapdogs are still loyal to their respective ideologies, the President does not expect that the current arrangement would last long.

Like the left and right hands, it needs to work together to achieve our collective goal.\n\nAs such, a constitution is necessary. With the President's foresight, the nation has drafted one.

Is he a loyalist, a patriot? Is he a mercenary out for his own gain? None can say at this stage. What is clear, however, is the Republic's dependency on American arms.\n\nInevitably, we require contact with Lady Liberty to spread the light of freedom. Though the government must tolerate her prying eyes, her watch does not confer only discomfort.

Would it not elate and uplift the heart of a patriot to see his home country soar again among the powers of this world?\n\nThat is WerBell's purpose. Though many may condemn his rule as tyrannical, he is not here to dictate - he is here to rule. Whether they like it or not, the Russians of West Alaska are his subjects, and he looks after them.

Though the plebians may jeer, it is ultimately in their favor that he takes the reins of chaos.\n\nThe Republic shall make no political promises to the local civilians.

It is a pragmatic solution: when WerBell's term as dictator expires, the Republic shall put its utmost effort towards the expansion of this freedom.\n\nHowever, for now, a certain amount of political curtailment is necessary.

Yet, even when one is as benevolent and open-handed as one can, one may not stop the evil intentions that brew in the dank corners of a man's heart.\n\nFear is as legitimate a tool as love. When adoration and adulation have failed, the government must resort to the implementation of deterrence as a policy.

From this patchwork of standards, we shall fashion the fabric of a new bureaucracy: a smooth and gliding citizen service that serves its people well."

In addition to better standards of living, political and voting rights, they have a steady source of employment that is sure to provide for them. The locals, of either flavor, envy the merc life. The Republic's laws are stiff, and there is not much room for social mobility - a discrepancy that would not have existed in America, where every man is free to be whatever he wants.\n\nPatterning his government on his home country's model, WerBell aims to fix this. He has a solution that will remedy the Republic's personnel shortage, as well as reassuring the restive locals: representation through service. Now, native Russians can sign up for a tour in WerBell's army and be granted more rights as they complete their term of employment. If they can shoot straight, why bar them from progressing their careers?"

Is the Republic a manner of dictatorship where the stated political rights are restricted indefinitely? These questions bubble in the thoughts of the Far Eastern Russians, who saw the unlikeliest of all candidates triumph over the fascists and communists.\n\nTo answer their anxieties, the Republic will make some headway to accepting democracy as its form of government. It will enter a preparatory stage - we will draw districts, establish voting booths, and devolve some governmental authorities to the municipalities and cities. We can complete the process, but not now. War stands on our gates, as the Central Siberians triumph over their own conflicts. Victory is greater than freedom."

From its bureaucracy to its police force, the Russians who willingly submitted themselves to WerBell's rule form the backbone and sinew of the newborn nation. Were it not for the help of these people, we would be nowhere. As a consequence, their status in society is a gray area.\n\nOne way to solve this quandary is to legitimize their position. Allowing more Russians into the civil service, as well as passing laws that confirm their legal status in society, would go a long towards soothing the restive ambitions of the Russian collaborators. The mercenaries will not like this, of course - but is the Republic not a state of, by, and for the Russian people?"

Those who deserve the world, those who hold up their part of the sky - and what can we give them but the adoration they deserve? If it were not for these brave pioneers, the Republic of West Alaska, the shining beacon of liberty amid a wasteland of dictatorships, might have never existed at all.\n\nNow is not the time for doubt. We shall issue more calls, more cries of rallying spirit, to gather those homeless in their home nations and to give them a reason to live, to fight for.

The United States of Russia, with its sister republic across the Bering Strait, has risen to the duty of salvation of the Russian people. Soon, democracy shall make its way to the people who have not known rule by popular will, and for that, we have one man to thank: Mitchell WerBell III.\n\nIn his presidential palace in Magadan, where he rules by the will of the peoples of the Far East, he drinks a glass of wine, cheerful. To the west lay Central Siberia: a far stronger foe than any of the statelets that he had faced in his progress to power.

We can kill two birds with one stone and guarantee they stay loyal to our government and help us build a new economy by allowing them to control our economic development.\n\nThe collaborators know where the best resource deposits are, where to invest in and where to steer clear of, and how to keep it all running in even the coldest winters.

If they want to eat, they'll need money, and they won't have any money unless they work for it. If even that is not enough, we can make a few examples of the most egregious obstructionists.

Unluckily for them plenty of their comrades do like us, or at least can be paid enough to pretend to. Loyalty to your countrymen is all well and good, but it won't keep the lights on. Information, on the other hand, just might.\n\nBy establishing a vast network of informants and collaborators across our country we can keep tabs on the Russian population and identify the troublemakers.

Production quotas, daily output, internal developments, all of this knowledge is at our disposal, and we won't let it go to waste.\n\nIt is no secret that some industries are more important than others. Using our informants, we can make sure our arms factories and resource companies are reaching their maximum output.

Siberia is now prospering under a partnership between WerBell's government and loyal Russian civilians, and the future looks brighter than ever.\n\nFrom Irkutsk to Kamchatka, Siberia is producing more than ever thought possible. Resources flow out of our port and wealth flows in to replace it. Our nation's economy is secure from both market disruptions and obstructionist sabotage.

If we want to draw further investment and business from around the globe, we will need a port worthy of the world's attention. Magadan can become such a port, but it will take investment.\n\nSoon Magadan will be the gateway to Russia, the new Vladivostok.

Under WerBell's guidance it has become a land of potential that is no longer untapped.\n\nSiberia's cities are flourishing for the first time in decades, some of them for the first time ever. The nation grows richer by the day as foreign trade streams in and the local mines and factories produce ever greater amounts of raw and finished goods.

If we do not take action soon our army is in danger of being overwhelmed by a type of enemy it is not prepared to fight.\n\nSiberia's landscape is as hostile as it is unique, and in many ways it is the perfect place for small groups of insurgents to hide from a larger foe.

As the region pulls itself back together and prepares for expansion, we are likely to be the first target, and our meager air fleet is woefully unprepared to defend against the armada we expect they shall be able to field.\n\nThe first step to addressing this is expanding the facilities our pilots can operate from. Currently our largest air bases are what remain from before the collapse of the Soviet Union with a few halfhearted expansions and modernizations thrown in. Some of these facilities have great potential to be combat bases for our new air force, and one in particular, known as Cheryomushki, is a prime candidate to serve as the new headquarters.

To the south lies the Empire of Japan, the strongest naval power in the world and a nation we have a chilly relationship with at best. While we have no delusions of opposing their naval dominance, we must not concede control of the sea to them without a fight.\n\nTo this end, a small, modern, and combat ready navy must be established.

The underdog who fights for coin in wars that was not their own: the life of the soldiers of fortune, whose goddess shepherds them from one battle to the next, in pursuit of glory and wealth. She is a fickle deity - for one era, mercenaries were prized warriors, foundations of empires, and the downfall of nations, before national armies eliminated the need for them. With the foundation of the United States of Siberia, it seems that she has bequeathed a home for her followers.\n\nThe Western Russians station their troops outside our borders, outnumbering us in equipment, division count, and personnel. Yet, like all the underdogs, the odds have always been against us. Fortune favors the bold, and WerBell is not done gambling."

First colonized by the Empire hundreds of years ago, a spate of industrial development brought about by the Siberian Plan has turned the region into a new center of industry within Russia. With this came the development of political ideologies perhaps not seen elsewhere in the Western world. Anarchism, thought long dead, still has followers in Kansk. Novosibirsk and Tomsk, anti-theses of each other, were within a stone's throw of each other. These varieties might seem interesting to the historian, but for the administrators of the Republic, this is a nightmare.\n\nTo pacify the Great Giant, the Republic of West Alaska shall use a carrot-and-stick approach.

The Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay came the closest, but its focus on the corporations have drawn disgust and ire from even the most freedom-loving American. With economic freedom must come personal freedom: this, in WerBell's eyes, has always been the American way.\n\nTherefore, there must be a rejuvenation of the economy under American principles if the United States of Siberia were to prosper.

Through freedom of enterprise, we seek to give personal freedom to every Siberian that participates within the market.

That being said, that future is far from accomplished, and what's said in name is much different than what's done in practice.\n\nIt's time to formalize the federalization of the United States of Siberia. While America created states based purely off of geographic and political considerations, Russia is a little different. While we'll be creating states based off of geographical parameters as well, Siberia has the unique reality of vastly different minorities spread throughout her territories.

But just because we don't blame them doesn't mean we can tolerate their simmering dissent.\n\nOnce more we must look to our friends in America for inspiration! WerBell and his cabinet have decided to create the Strategic Services Unit, or SSU, to root out dissenters and would-be revolters in our newly-conquered Siberian territories, in order to "discourage" any potential actions against our government.

And while Central Siberia is a little better, it can't hold a candle to the vast hordes of Russian people present to our west. The fact that our army is primarily made up of foreign mercenaries with few prospects of raising a mass force has made our high command acutely aware of our precarious position.\n\n"Fear not", our daring leader has reassured us, "There's an art to living dangerously". We don't need a massive army, claims WerBell. Our mercenaries have served us well up to this point, and why should that change? Our armed forces are a beacon of elitism and effectiveness across the Russian tundra, and we should play into this.

While we've until this point relied on our foreign mercenaries, the upcoming western conflict will require just more than ambitious foreigners.\n\nIf we can train anyone from around the world to be an elite soldier, why can't we train a Russian? It's time to create employment opportunities in our armed forces for natives - not just to fill ranks, but to become truly elite soldiers, on par with those who we've attracted from abroad.

Like us, our western neighbour has fought tooth and nail to get where they are. They have a large industrial base, a large population base, and an army that's been fighting for years.\n\nSimply put, it's not practical to rely purely on American aid to supply our soldiers anymore.

The audio, which had been Russian patriotic sounds set to the tune of unmastered sound and constant crackling, was now playing a very soft piano - a classic. Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9, no. 2, the particular favorite of some of the mercenaries that worked in Harbin. It continued for several minutes until the last tone rang, and a voice, smooth, controlled, baritone, took over. "Good evening, people of Siberia," A hint of English accent underlaid its Russian, "This is the new Radio Free Magadan, recently liberated from the Fascists that had lived there for years. If you've just tuned in, this is your host, Stephen, also known as Roastbeef to my French compadres," a carefully controlled laughter, "What funny boys. If you're Russian, or in merc parlance, a local, you can call me Strelok. Simple but effective."\n\nA cough. "Oh, excuse me," the voice said, lowering itself away from the microphone, although the percussions were still audible, "I apologize for the interruption. Now, due to the generosity of our benefactor, Mr. WerBell Esq.," he moved to a whisper, "The esquire is important!" He resumed, "If you have any requests, you can send them to our offices in Magadan, right near beside the old RFP offices. For now," sounds of shuffling paper, "It's now time for Surfin' Safari, by The Beach Boys. This is Strelok, or Roastbeef, signing off."\n\nSmooth rock commenced."

The garb he was wearing did not resemble what he had worn for years: rough, threadbare, and bearing only a single color. His medals, his lapels, his unearned magnificence, all gone, scattered to the winds like the Whites who had protected him. At least, the guards spoke English, and they would frequently joke with him and bring him the best of the prison rations, which now lay before him. Some soup with beans in it, a few slices of bread, and a glass of water. Not much, but enough.\n\nToday's guard, Jack, had told him to dig into his food - ASAP, as he phrased it. An honored guest was coming, Jack said, and he did not want to piss off this guy. Mikhail had known who his visitor was from the start. Dressed in prison uniform and fed like the lowest worker in the world, in Mikhail's veins still flowed imperial blood. It didn't use to be like this. He had no claim to anyone's throne, and his crown did not fit him. All this, for a piece of poorly cooked steak.\n\nThe bars of his prison clanked open. In the gap stood Mitchell WerBell, and an interpreter. Mikhail stood, first a little unsteadily, and after a few seconds, staggered to meet who might be his executioner or his savior. "I can speak English," Mikhail began, "The interpreter is unnecessary."\n\nWerBell nodded his head at his aide, who immediately went away. "So," WerBell said, sizing Mikhail up and down, "A Russian Tsar with a limey English accent? Truth is stranger than fiction, indeed." He took Mikhail by the shoulder, and the two of them sat down together on the Tsar's humble bed, next to his latrine.\n\n"I-I am not Englis-" Mikhail said, before stopping. Interrupting WerBell might not be wise.\n\n"Mr. Romanov," WerBell gestured at Mikhail, "That your name?" Mikhail nodded. "You know, I am not really sure why you're here, and I can let you go for, of course, a small cost. I hear your dad has them deep pockets for royalty. It should be nothing for you."\n\n"H-how much?"\n\n"For a small cost of half-million dollars, I will put you on a skipper headed for England, Australia, wherever."\n\n"I don't have that kind of money!"\n\n"Then you sure as shit should hope your father has." Mikhail was silent. Then, he slowly nodded. "I am glad we had reached an understanding." WerBell left, and the prison clanged shut once more."

Her duty was that of a spider - to construct webs of informants, local contacts, and spies: in the hopes of snaring a valuable piece of intel, or perhaps even a snitch or two. Her mind is tuned to the changes in the web, just like how a spider can feel any snag, any object that caught itself in its structure. This morning, her mind polished in the bitter wash of coffee, she had received a report from Firebase Moses: and it did not disappoint her. Cocooned in a file before her, was what she had wanted all along: juicy, valuable intel.\n\nShe could feel the venom emanate from this particular document, however. Firebase Moses had seen activities in the north, although it hadn't coalesced into anything concrete. All reports of civilian movement seemed inconclusive - tracking the cursory, sub-sensory flow of people to the barren north was pointless, not to mention exhausting and taxing. Opening the file, she rustled through its contents: hastily written notes, blurry photographs, and a word that echoed over and over: the Father, the Father. She leaned back in her chair and considered her options. The newly-installed telephone sat across from her. If she lifted the receiver, then the equivalent in WerBell's office would also ring.\n\nWithout a doubt, she reached for it."

On the other side of that ocean is heaven on earth: the United States of America. Land of freedom and liberty, of countless land and infinite money. Smith, from his days and nights in the city of Bloemfontein, had seen America from the covers of magazines, and the brief, barely-legible photographs of monochrome newspapers. War was a business, and business was good, yes; but he did not want to shoot at natives forever. No: he had dreams beyond, to settle in America, and finally end a roaming, sedentary life.\n\nAs images of kitschy glitz fluttered in his mind - of paperback romance books, of the descriptions of one shining city after another, he saw the ship bearing new arrivals to WerBell's latest scheme. No doubt, its occupants held the same kind of dreams that Smith had: to settle down somewhere quiet, somewhere where they could enjoy the winnings of a life spent on betting against fate and coming on top, again and again.\n\nSmith would rather be in the frontlines right about now, where the days passed quickly. An assignment is still an assignment, however, and at least there was pay. He had to watch over the soldiers, and guide them to their new quarters, guide them through the modest town, and generally help them acclimate. He went over his own words in his mind: the greetings, the jokes, and how he would handle and juggle especially inflated egos.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and took a drag. He'd play it by ear, fuck it. His future problems were for his future self. For now, he enjoyed the small luxury afforded to him and made a joke to his past, something only he would ever know. He laughed and watched as the vessel ambled its way through the waves, coming ever closer by the minute."

For the past hour, he had loaded and unloaded bullets into it, spinning the chamber, and playing with the safety, all from the comfort of his arm. The boy, an aide of age nineteen, tried to dissuade him from doing, in a pussy's parlance, "rash actions." WerBell might be drunk, but he knew what the fuck he was doing.\n\n"N-no, sieur," the boy's French accent bled into everything, staining his words with a tang of wine, bread, and croissant. Or something like that. WerBell was a stream-of-consciousness guy, especially when he was drunk. "Though, I have read stuff in the newspapers and magazines. I think that it's a fair country," the boy looked down, "at least compared to France."\n\nWerBell roared with laughter. The aide looked at him with puzzlement, and then growing offense. Before the young man could say anything, however, WerBell cut him short with a quick chamber-snap of the revolver. "Those magazines don't tell you anything about the full picture," the mercenary clambered down from the heights, "They don't tell you jack shit about America. Land of the free, land of liberty, land of opportunity. You can find damn near everything there, except maybe the fun of merc life." He took a sip of his whiskey, finally putting his gun to its holster, "Save up. Save the fuck up. You're young - twenty-one, right? Maybe there you'll find the girl of your dreams, and settle down in a nice farm somewhere in Texas. Or something like that."\n\nThe aide could do nothing but nod.

The perpetrator has been court-martialed and punished according to the Provisional Military Code of West Alaska. It happened after an altercation between Genrikh Yagoda and said recruit. The latter was tired and exhausted after a day of "cleaning up after the mess of the NKVD." Having lived under the regime of Genrikh Yagoda, the private attempted to reason with the dictator and acquire a motive for his "cruel, inhumane" reign in the Far East. Distressed at the loss of his fiefdom to what he termed to be "a bunch of mercenary troublemakers," the former President of the Presidium attempted to leverage his protection under the Code and his higher education against the recruit to justify what he euphemistically called "the excesses of socialism."\n\nThis did not go well. After a brief round of intellectual sparring, which the tired Russian recruit found to be annoying to the highest extreme, he fired at Yagoda, killing him after a few shots from his (now-secured) M1911.

 westalaska.7.desc: ""Are you comfortable, Mr. Sablin?" the interpreter said, relaying the message from his employer, who sat directly across from Sablin: the maverick mercenary Mitchell WerBell III. A scarce few days before, the Government of West Alaska had sentenced Valery Sablin, former commissar of the NKVD, to death. Now, he sat with the de-facto dictator of the nation - the latter puffing fumes from his cigar like the smokestacks of overworked factories.\n\n"Yes," Sablin said, in the most baffled tone he could manage, "Why am I here?" When his guards told him that he was meeting WerBell, he believed that he would be marched like lambs to the slaughter, to stand before the gun barrel of a ruthless mercenary and hunted down without mercy. Instead, he found himself before a polished plate, with a lustrous steak flanked by silverware. Far from the dark basements of the Magadan prisons, this dining room was well-lit, a chandelier hanging above, its beads shining like little glassy stars.\n\n"We're just here to have dinner in peace, from man to man," WerBell said, "A final goodbye." A mercenary draped in the trappings of a waiter poured red wine to Sablin's glass. "Want a cigar, Mr. Sablin? Although - maybe you don't know how to smoke one of these yet." WerBell smiled at Sablin, a look free of malice and ill-intent, a steel facade worn over an evil face. When he found the commissar staring at him with a mix of befuddlement and disgust, he tipped his glass over in Sablin's direction. "Come on, Mr. NKVD. The wine isn't that bad."\n\n"I'm fine, thanks," Sablin said, "I would rather suffer the indignity of imprisonment than being entreated and brought over to the side of an enemy of socialism."\n\nWerBell laughed again. "Who says you were going to live? Mr. Sablin, you are twenty-three at most. Live a little." He coughed, "Before you die, that is." He gestured his fork at Sablin. "Go on, dig in." He drank his wine and ate his food, not paying attention to the commissar at all, who did not touch his plate. He left WerBell's presence as resigned of his fate as before, although a part of him wondered what the mercenary truly was."

 westalaska.8.t: "A Soldier's Consitution"
 westalaska.8.desc: "WerBell leaned forward on his desk, his armchair either too small or too large for him, depending on the moment. In his head pounded the noisiest headache known to man - he shouldn't have drunk anything before today. His grip on his pen was slippery, and his grasp on reality equally as magnificent. Putting his pen down, he cracked his fingers together and stretched, triggering an avalanche pain in his head as the cranks of his shoulder administer their punishment. Every tremor of his head, every twitch of the eye, seemed to shake and break reality around him.\n\nIn front of him was the mother of all documents he had to ever write. He liked to pretend that in his alcohol-induced waking nightmare that the black trails of ink were pearls of wisdom, shining in the dark. The other part of him called it bullshit. The sum of himself, the part that thought the chair was too big, believed the latter. Sometimes one must lie for the truth to shine on - another piece of bullshit.\n\nA doorknock. "Are you done," the voice of the fearful French aide said, "Sir?" WerBell decided against replying. His throat was parched, and whatever sound that emanated from it, no mortal human being can ever withstand. He could do with a glass of warm water, but no, "Constitution first, sir." Damned French and their constitutions; what do they know about running nations? Two Empires, three republics, and a country that was sunk into the clutches of Fascism.\n\nHe grumbled, he complained, he shuddered and shivered. Sighing, he admitted that it would probably need to be done sooner or later. He peered down on the great sheet of paper and saw that he only just got unto "Minority Protections". It was going to be a long day."

 westalaska.9.t: "Confessions of a Mercenary"
 westalaska.9.desc: "They let him wear his clerical attire, his black robes, and the crucifix wrapped around his neck. They gave him food - not rotting, bottom-of-the-barrel food, but actual, edible meals. Even after their tribunals sentenced him to death by firing squad, they did not stop the special treatment. The Father, Alexander Men, took everything they gave him with a pinch of salt. Gifts from human beings can never surpass the grace of the Lord. Holding it close to his heart, he accepted that his fate was to suffer in the clutches of soft mercy. He fasted, he refused to wear his attire - preferring instead to wear the threadbare, drab wear of the other prisoners.\n\nToday, however, was different. They forced him, first softly, later almost at gunpoint, to wear his clerical robes. The guards said that their master, the deplorable and reviled mercenary, Mitchell WerBell III, sought to meet him, and confess. The remark alone stunned him, not to mention its repercussions. He was not even sure if WerBell was baptized in the Orthodox rite. His men discussed his Russian descent, but surely not? He debated the question until they brought him before WerBell.\n\n"I have nothing to say to you," Men said, "And I doubt that your intent to confess was ever pure." He resisted the urge to spit before his tribulation, the punishment for his failed trial. The two men stood and stared at one another before WerBell started,\n\n"Come on, Father," WerBell flashed a smirk at the agitated Father, "I am irreligious. I just want to talk. To see how a man of God views my career. Perhaps even," he paused. "A blessing." He continued. "I like to believe that I had been merciful in my youthful pursuit. Industrious, in the art of war, and an enthusiastic practitioner of the Lord's gift resolving conflicts with violence." He thumbed his revolver. "I am an arms dealer, and not just guns either. Men, tanks, artillery guns, the many things that render modern conflict possible." Stepping closer to the Father, "I have committed many sins, Father, and I do not see a way to turn back. Perhaps, with your blessings, I ca-"\n\n"No." Men cut him off.\n\nThe surprise didn't register on WerBell's face. "I thought so." He grinned. "Take him away, we're done.""

 westalaska.10.t: "What the Future Holds"
 westalaska.10.desc: "WerBell and Nancy stepped into the town. A few days ago, enemy insurgents had occupied it, turning the overly-large village into a pitched battleground. Shells dotted the ground, and brick buildings lay there, shattered - their facade now scattered around them. In the distance, a half-sunk Parish overlooked the town, its bells hollow. An artillery strike had struck its tower, and the defenders had to watch as the building sagged and leaned, retreating quickly in fear of further fire. Survivors from both sides staggered through the ruin, seeking medical attention and food. A shrill cry sounded in the distance.\n\n"What a mess," Nancy said, "But I guess you are used to this, seeing as-" she turned to see WerBell puffing a cigar, enjoying his time as if he was walking on his own backyard. "It's nice to see that at least someone is enjoying this trip out in the woods." She glanced at a woman in white who hurried between the medical tents, carrying in her arms medical supplies and tools, as well as alcohol to clean wounds. Local medics. Thank god for them. It was her idea. Their mission had expanded exponentially, and now she was sitting in the front-seat to the most mind-boggling phenomenon in Russia. She sighed. Her stay would be longer than expected, after all.\n\nTaking his cigar out of his mouth, WerBell blew wisps of smoke that wafted about him like a fine mist. "This may not look like it," he said, turning to Nancy, "But we're saving these people. For god's sake," he kicked a mound of dirt in front of him, "They can't even save themselves. Remember Germany?" He smiled. "We'll make soldiers out of them just yet," looking at two listless men who stood in front of the remnants of their house, their face emptied by disbelief, and filled with uncertainty, "We'll give them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."\n\nMaybe coming here was a mistake. Maybe the entirety of the mission was a mistake. "I hope you're right," she said, "I would hate for all this suffering to go into something wrong.""

 westalaska.11.t: "A Mercenary Leadership"
 westalaska.11.desc: "Mitchell WerBell sat behind the old desk, the one that used to belong to the fascist Matkovsky. He was still finding bottles of vodka hidden in the office, even after all these years. WerBell, tired after a long day of administrative work, wanted nothing more than to be out with his boys again fighting communists or whoever else, anything to get out of the gloom. It wasn't as enjoyable being behind the lines, but someone had to do it, and it was him.\n\n"Sir, we have a new report for you."\n\n"Another one!" WerBell replied. "How many of these am I going to get a day?"\n\n"It's very important sir, you need to read it."\n\nSkimming the pages, it was mostly good news, depending on what good news could ever be in the Siberian wastes. Multiple sabotage events foiled, most importantly at the Irkutsk Hydro Plant. The last pages of the report were the most important, however. They were running out of mercenaries. "Our men are strong and well trained," said the aide. "But the problem is, we've grown so fast that we don't have enough troops to guard our borders or complete anti-partisan missions. We need a solution, and the only ones are to hire more mercenaries or bring Russians into our ranks."\n\nWerBell stared into the pages, trying to get any sort of answer from them. Perhaps he did need some of that vodka."

 westalaska.12.t: "Some Assembly Required"
 westalaska.12.desc: "Mitchell Livingston WerBell III kept his face impassive, but internally burned with fury. He had not known how bad the situation was, and he was sure more than one person had been lying to him all this time. They would pay for that.\n\nHe had just inspected his army. Or, rather and as far as he was concerned, his 'army,' it barely being capable of being called such. The rabble that called themselves soldiers possessed no discipline and little understanding of basic field skills. The arms and other materiel they utilized were not only ancient and non-uniform, but also in terrible condition.\n\nWerBell had not lived so long, or secured his and his confederates' rule over the Far East by being sloppy, undisciplined, ill-equipped, or blind. No, he had secured it by taking charge. By putting in an honest day's toil of hard - and quality - work. Like any American would. Or should. And he would do the same here.\n\nLooking each of the officers he now walked past in the eye, he wondered if they knew what was about to be in store for them. There was going to be a lot of very hard work to bring the wider military into proper shape.\n\nAnd, by God, they were going to do it."

 westalaska.13.t: "Language Barriers"
 westalaska.13.desc: "Otto stared at the group of 10 Russians in front of him, their backs straight, their eyes attentive with a hint of bitter resentment, but their uniforms shabby and ill fitting. Muttering to himself in German, the old mercenary straightened back up and took a puff from his cigarette as he ran through hazy memories of the Russian classes he had taken when he was 15. Apparently, they qualified him to train troops.\n\nIn stilted, broken Russian he began speaking to the trainees: "H-Hello, good morning..." Shit, what was the word for recruit? "Students." The squad stared at him in utter confusion, but said nothing. Only silence reigned in the small field outside the barracks, save for the whistling of the siberian winds. Otto's heart beat faster as he floundered for the right words to give orders. Sweat was already collecting on his brow, beaten by freezing wind and leaving him with that agonizingly anachronistic feeling one gets on a cold, sunny day.\n\nLeaning to the side, one of the soldiers whispered to his mate, "Go figure, the idiots send a kraut who can barely speak Russian to train us to fight so we can pretend to be American." The other recruit chuckled in response. Turning red with embarrassment at mockery he couldn't grasp, Otto tried helplessly to form a sentence that would tell them to shut their damn mouths.\n\n"Quiet your faces! Today we will drill open-grass combat. Er- Open field. Open field combat." Otto dropped his cigarette, stamping it into the ground before shakily reaching for another one. At this point, the soldiers were barely holding back hysterical laughter, their lips puckered and their chins dug into their necks to avoid giggling.\n\n"Christ above. Just uh... just run twenty lap, yes students?" The squad nodded and began running down the small, gravel track they had dug the previous night.\n\nOne recruit shouted, "Okay teacher!" As he set off, snickering at his own joke.\n\nOtto went to sit down, lighting his second cigarette of the day."

He began ecstatically, "You're listening to Radio Free Magadan, your best source for entertainment in these changing times. Speaking of which,"\n\nWhispering could be heard just out of earshot of the microphone, along with the telltale patter of footsteps as someone was ushered into the studio, "As you know, things in Africa are changing aswell; as the situation becomes more unstable, we're welcoming new and exotic mercenaries and friends from the far away lands of the Congo! I have one such man here in the studio with me now. Say hello to our listeners, Mr. Calistrat."\n\nBroken Russian with a strong Romanian accent could be heard over the static of the radio as the guest began to speak, "Hello, I am called Fernando Calistrat; Very thankful to be welcomed to your country and look forward to serving with you armies. Thank you."\n\n"Wonderfully done, Fernando.

 westalaska.15.desc: "Roger Faulques felt the creak of the wooden docks as he stepped off the boat, stumbling a bit as he adjusted to being on land. Seagulls cried far above the port city of Magadan, a place far from anywhere he'd ever set foot. As he walked along the docks, shuffling in between crowds of travellers, sailors and dock workers, he felt old wounds ache. The bullet in his foot he caught fighting for his country against the krauts. The scars and bullet wounds from his time roving in Algeria. The bullet in his other foot, his chest, and his shoulder he caught fighting for the krauts or some other sordid power with enough money to convince the old soldier to bleed again in some hellhole in the depths of Africa, for some few Reichsmarks and a lifetime of dull pain. The bullet that never left his right leg after his stint in the Italian Middle East, giving him a painful but difficult to notice limp. A thousand other skirmishes lingered in his memory but left no mark like that of those years in North Africa, Central Africa and the Middle East.\n\nStill, Roger was only slightly less able than he used to be, a fact that impressed his employers and drew him fame and renown. The 'Man of A Thousand Lives' they called him. So, when Roger heard a state in Russia was hiring mercenaries, and saw many people he had fought alongside flee to once again live the daring life of a hired gun, he'd decided to give it a shot.\n\nIt was an odd feeling, walking the streets of Magadan as he searched for a barracks, a hiring office, anywhere he could find a job. It felt less like he was looking for another place to work and more like he was looking for a place to belong. Certainly, his career was storied, but he was for once in a place filled to the brim with men like him. They all had a certain look, a look he found in abundance in a crowd of men ahead of him, circled around some building whose signs he could not make out. It did look like the place for Roger to be, though, so he set forward."

Singlaub laughed like a hyena, his old friend WerBell's familiar laugh echoing back at him from the telephone receiver. WerBell had given him a call to discuss business, something about Eastern Russia or Western Alaska or... something, but it had quickly devolved into banter and storytelling about their old days in the OSS.\n\n"God, I don't even remember that. Must've been some opium," cackled WerBell, before continuing. "Anyways, let's get down to business, old friend. I hear you're still working with the feds back in the states."\n\n"Yeah, yeah, the Central Intelligence Agency."\n\n"Right. Still not as great as the OSS, but that doesn't matter. That's why I called you, on top of the personal stuff."\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\n"See, I'd like to make a deal with you and the CIA, back in the states. You ship us some guns, bullets, and whatnot and we look out for you boys here in Russia. Keep you and the CIA updated on the situation here and all."\n\n"Well... I'd have to run it by the Deputy Director. But I'm sure I can pull it off. Expect a call from the higher ups at some point to make sure everything's all set, but I think I can call in a few favors.

 westalaska.17.t: "A Transcendent Partnership"
 westalaska.17.desc: "Mitchell Livingston WerBell III shook hands with Gordan Ingram, and knew that he had met a kindred soul.\n\nInvited to set up business in the Far East, Ingram had arrived only a short time before, but had already made quite an impression. The man was a visionary in the field of weapons design, and had shown him a number of proposed firearms he intended to continue development upon.\n\nHe, and WerBell besides, had been most interested in a number of compact, extremely high rate-of-fire submachine guns, almost small enough to be considered, at least ostensibly, as a pistol. The military and clandestine potential of such a weapon was obvious, and WerBell had wholeheartedly agreed to facilitate the concern's administrative needs as much as possible.\n\nWerBell had even proposed some ideas of his own, primarily concerning the potential of such weapons with suppressors of various sizes, which Ingram himself had found quite interesting. They were both sure there would be many more weapon designs to come, which could be leveraged not only for profit, but for the state's operations both domestically and abroad.\n\nYes, WerBell thought, it was yet another victory for capitalism in the Far East. And who could complain about that?"

 westalaska.18.t: "New Regime, Same Profession"
 westalaska.18.desc: "Alexander Pavlov had been an enforcer for many years. Under Matkovsky, he had been in charge of many of the state's security operations. And now, under WerBell, he was in charge of surveying many of the new training facilities that had been ordered opened, ensuring they were up to standard.\n\nIt was a good job and, of course and most importantly, was an excellent way to enrich oneself at the expense of the officers who were not up to snuff. He was, naturally, careful to moderate his efforts to such a degree as to not cause trouble. Many of his former comrades had not been so fortunate, and he had, indeed, shot several of them to prove his loyalty to the new regime.\n\nHe wondered what Matkovsky would have thought of him working with WerBell so. The man had always been supremely practical, understanding the need for hard choices. The party split and retreat to Magadan had been proof enough of that. He pondered if Matkovsky would have understood his choices.\n\nPavlov quickly put the thought out of his mind. If there was one thing he had learned during his many years in the RFP, it was that one had to be very able and willing to change with the times. He had before, when Matkovsky had split from Rodzaevsky. And he was doing so once again. He did not know how long this new reality was to last, but as long as it did, he would ensure he was part of it. While also, of course, making sure he was ready should it fall. He wondered if he would be the one to deliver the coup to WerBell should that happen.\n\nHe suspected he would easily adapt to that reality as well."

Discipline, provided by the many new training centres, had increased substantially, with fewer and fewer reports on insubordination. Equipment was slowly being standardized, his partnerships with armament concerns proving their worth.. Fieldcraft was being learned, and communicated.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, more overseas manpower was arriving almost daily. Hardened men, veterans of the world's many wars and conflict zones, were finding refuge and a place to call their own in the Far East. Their own discipline and skills would no doubt help stiffen the general soldiery to a great degree.\n\nBeyond that, their loyalty and dedication to a state they could call their own would also provide a ready pool of administrators for the vast territories that could be administered. Ever so slowly, and bit by bit, the sun shone ever brighter on his new republic.\n\nAnd he would work to ensure it continued to do so."

There wasn't a chance he'd survive here. So, like, some manner of vermin, he had hid. For so long. That is, until he heard boots crunching snow outside of the cabin he had found refuge in.\n\nHow could they have found him? He thought to himself, hearing the steps come closer and closer to the cellar doors. There was definitely more than one person coming, he thought, he was sure of it. Before he knew it, the darkness of the basement was pierced by daylight as the doors were thrown open with a dull creak. Gurgen froze, shutting his eyes tight.\n\n"Gurgen Aseryants?"

Glancing up, he saw a man, what looked to be an officer of some sort, approaching his cell. Yuri staggered to his feet, expecting to be called to attention only for the man to approach the next cell over.\n\nA hushed conversation proceeded between the stranger and Yuri's neighbor, before the jingling of keys could be heard, followed by the metallic whine of a cell door grinding open. "Good to be back!" Exclaimed a voice which was becoming louder as its origin exited his cell. The uniformed officer led Yuri's prison mate into view as he finally approached his cell - none other than Georgy Shekherev, leader of the Amur Blackshirts. Yuri certainly held mixed feelings toward the revelation; Amur had been his sworn enemy for the longest time, but they both shared a prison under WerBell's republic.\n\n"Prisoner Yuri Vitvitsky," said the officer, as if reading from a script, "The United States of Siberia has an offer to extend to you."\n\nYuri raised an eyebrow, "And just what is that offer?"\n\n"A full pardon for you and several other blackshirts, in exchange for your service to the States as a peacekeeper."\n\n"Christ, anything that'll get me out of this cell is fine by me."\n\n"Very well," replied the Officer, plucking another key from the chain on his belt and pressing it into the lock on his cell door, sliding it open with the same distinctive grind.

The mercenary turned warlord had been pondering on the state of his little eastern Siberian domain, which turned out to be - quite frankly - a shit show to run. Political instability had been a staple of the region for a little over a decade now, governments ranging from Communist dictatorships to more esoteric ones like Men's religious mandate, and of course one shouldn't forget of Matkdovsky's travesty of a "republic" distorting what little idea the natives had of the concept of democracy.\n\nHow could such an unruly region be governed by its people or by anyone for that matter? Mitchel had no idea. Institutions such as the ones found in the United States of America couldn't be implemented over here, or at least, not in the same format or in the current situation that Western Alaska found itself in. As he puffed out a cloud of smoke, the middle-aged man grimaced as a thought crossed his mind: his dream of a federal government couldn't be conciliated with the reality of the situation he found himself in. Though he abhorred the idea, ruling by decrees would be the solution he'd have to settle for - for now - in order to bring much needed stability.\n\nYet as he started to warm up to his decision, WerBell feared that this show of despotic rule would set a precedent for the rise of a would-be dictator successor in the long run."

Now all that remained was a shell with a basement, one that worked perfectly for him and his friends.\n\nWhen Andrei entered, Katya smiled at his arrival. "I was afraid you were going to pussy out," she said, then slapped him on the shoulder.\n\n"And what, miss your great company?" Andrei replied, which got a round of laughs. "Okay, enough bullshitting around. Let's talk business." For the rest of the night, Andrei spoke with the others about the needs of the people. Some of them were just upset about the mercenaries getting to do whatever they wanted. Others wanted to implement some of the reforms from the old Union. But it was nothing radical. It could turn into that easily, but the small group of free thinkers was dedicated to nonviolence for the moment. Not out of an ideological underpinning, but because they believed it would lead to their destruction.\n\nWhich is why Katya had to keep showing up at these meetings. Back at her home, she spoke on the radio to her handler. "No, it's a lot of hot air right now, but that Andrei is a smart one.

Staggering back away from the furnace and nearly tripping over the man behind him, he caught the eye of one of the supervisors that had been assigned to the mill days ago.

The worker turned around to face the supervisor, his face twisting into a worried grimace. "Did I do something wrong?"\n\n"No, no... how would you like a raise on the next few hours of your salary?""

They were, in fact, in view from her window where she had been watching the sun slowly make its way beneath the skyline, bathing the streets in ochre that was slowly fading to purple and would transition from there to midnight blue. A black car followed by a motorcade of military trucks rolled through the streets, pulling up right beside the Administrative Offices.\n\nIntrigued, Lada leaned further out her window, gripping the sill and trying to discern who was climbing out of the car. Noone she knew, that's for certain, nor anyone who had ever been seen on a ballot or appointed by the Soviet. No, it was some variety of high ranking military man. She never could get down the specifics of uniforms in the newly forged USS, but the man certainly had the entourage to prove his rank.\n\nShe watched the little ant sized man enter the building along with a few soldiers. After a few minutes, more figures exited the building. Only it wasn't the soldiers, it was the administrative staff of the building. Lada stared at the window with deep concern as most of Yakutsk's government was ordered out of the building, presumably to be replaced by the man in the fancy cap and whatever staff he chose to keep. Worriedly, she stepped away from the window and went to go turn on one of her lamps, the night being quite dark by now. Returning to her window, she closed the curtains and went to go sit down and ponder the changing times."

When he had decided to sign up for the army, he'd assumed the line would be much shorter, but he'd arrived to a staggeringly long queue that he was now near the end of. Really, he had no idea who in their right mind would choose to sign up for this paradox of an army, but here he was standing in line. He had no other options, anyway.\n\nHis father had been getting sicker and sicker and his worthless factory job wouldn't cover the medical bills. Ever since the old man had come back from the war in the west, he'd been getting sicker by the year. Andrei had no idea what had happened; maybe it was the bullet in his thigh, maybe it was the months spent in the mud, but he hadn't been able to pay a doctor to treat him much less diagnose him. He'd been just about ready to call it quits when he heard about the new recruitment program; not only were they promising him rights for when his service concluded, but they extended to his family as well.\n\nSo he told his old boss at the munitions factory to shove it and came here, to stand in line and check a clock every five minutes. Finally, he was stirred from his thoughts by the man in front of him leaving the line. He was at the desk now, where a broad shouldered, man in uniform sat.\n\n"Good morning, friend. I trust you are here to join up?" He said.\n\n"Yes," replied Andrei, resisting the urge to sardonically ask him why else he would be there.\n\n"Just sign here." He nodded, sliding a paper in front of the soon-to-be recruit.\n\nAndrei stared down at the blank space waiting for his signature. "It'll all be worth it..."

 westalaska.29.desc: "Back in the west, impossibly far from Magadan, lay the historic city settled by Peter the Great. The subject of WerBell's interest however was in the landmark created by his niece, Anna. She created the Versailles of Russia, the Winter Palace. It had been the seat of Kerensky's government for a time, but its place in history was cemented by the Bolsheviks storming it in 1917. Not to mention the scarring memory of its destruction, filmed for all to see in the widely distributed films from the German invasion. That Goebbels sure did know how to film the obliteration of history...\n\nNevermind that, WerBell thought. The construction of his Presidential Palace, built as closely as possible to the Winter Palace which was once in St. Petersburg, was complete. It now lay in the Siberia, a proper land of ice and snow. The only fitting place for a Winter Palace, no?\n\nHe was celebrating the occasion with some French wine, brought all the way here from the Atlantic. Over a dozen bottles had been distributed to his men, who would partake in the celebration of the Palace's completion with him. In spirit, though. WerBell wanted to spend tonight by himself. He thought about his contender to the west, who could enjoy the full bounty of Bukharin's Siberian Plan. As he sipped from his glass and looked around, a smile creased his face. He had united a band of the lost and forsaken to his cause. He had made a new nation, not Russian, but one of his own design. He was the master of war and with his beloved soldiers, would march forward and crush whoever was in his path. Would Caesar hesitate, would Napoleon? Actually, to hell with those losers! They were conquerors. He was a builder. He was going to be a Washington. That is how history would remember him. He would accept no excuse to this."

Clearly, this gilded structure was where the old Tsar once resided. Now, it was to become an empty husk stripped bare by WerBell's mercenaries.\n\nEvery step became more difficult than the last. Even with two men carrying the chest, the weight of the valuables within made transporting it a herculean affair. "Come on, Kurt, put your back into it! I feel like I'm doing all the work here!" Kurt's comrade, a large American man, choked out with a strained voice.\n\n"I'm trying, it's just-" Before Kurt could conjure up some kind of explanation for his lackluster performance, he felt the chest begin to wobble. Both men lost their balance, and an object slipped out onto the grand and a shattering could be heard.\n\n"Fuck," The American grumbled under his breath, "I hope the Captain didn't see that. What did we lose?"\n\nKurt looked down to see a shattered picture frame, containing a seemingly recent photograph of an old Cossack sitting next to a balding man wearing the clothes of a royal. Two men whose deeds have been lost in the chaos of the Siberian anarchy, no doubt. Kurt turned back to his comrade."

Despite the cold, he still kept his eyes peeled as his men hauled another crate of auto parts out of the cargo bay of his ship. The men shivered just about as much as him, their frozen breath travelling into the air around them like wispy ghosts of the sea.\n\nThis was their first run out to Siberia. Being a tramp freighter, they've made runs all over the world, but being based out of the West Coast means that most of those trips have been to much... sunnier places. Japan. Indonesia. Australia. Mexico. Hawaii. Never some absurd 'Republic of West Alaska', as the locals called it, in Frozen Hellhole, Russia. A few other captains he knew had also started making their first few runs up to Magadan since the Russians finally started to get off their asses and rebuild.\n\nThe San Diego native glanced over at a man approaching him, a Russian wrapped in far fewer layers than he. "You're here dropping off the auto parts, yes?" Began the man, in heavily accented English.\n\n"Yes, yes. You're the buyer, then?" Inquired Frank.\n\n"Oh, no. I just came out to watch. There's been a, uh, big buzz around town with all the American businesses moving here. This is a Ford shipment, yes?"\n\n"Mhm. Never expected to make a shipment out here, much less autoparts. Figured if I was ever gonna make a delivery to Russia it'd be after an arms company decides to start contracting us. They mostly make liners do this shit." Frank said, shortly before muttering something along the lines of "This is one weird country."\n\nApparently, the Russian had heard the slight and glanced over at Frank.

Hardly a foreign land, Magadan was more Americanized than he thought it would be. Plenty of billboards for familiar brands dotted the city, along with plenty of Americans. The scruffy mercenaries that patrolled the streets were even from his own country! Though they swore allegiance to a new United States.\n\nIt didn't matter. Johnny had the chance here to expand his business like never before. When your business is trees, you're limited by the amount. Not to mention reforesting after you're done so the trees are there for you next time. Unlike back home, Johnny didn't have to worry about environmental protections, oversight, or much of anything in the way of Big Government keeping the Little Guy like him down. Well, little being figurative he still inherited this business from his pappy and his before him. But he was a worker! He was out here, making a bet and taking a risk on this new country of the United States of Siberia. He was an ambitious sonnuva gun willing to take on these kinds of risks!\n\nAfter he signed on the dotted line, the USS government was going to give him tens of thousands of acres of land to harvest lumber from. His company had endless growth and already investors back home were raking over the cash to help feed his enterprise. Even more would be lining up to invest after the first year, and the next, and the one after that. Each year ramping up production. And Johnny knew he wasn't the only company coming in. All across the States, people were heeding the call of fresh expansion in this new frontier. It was like the Wild West was reborn here and now."

The euphoria of what was promised by the United States of Siberia. He wanted to be first, ahead of all other competition. Well he got his wish. And now he was paying for it.\n\nAt first he figured he could hire American workers, but his contract stated he needed to use local labor. Next he wanted to set up several camps at once, but the infrastructure wasn't there for it. Hell, it was hard enough getting gas for all the trucks he needed. Production was almost ten times slower here than it was back home. The investors had stopped being interested at all. There was only one recourse for Johnny, to bail out. That was the only way he would be able to save his company without it falling apart. Except...\n\nHe didn't read the fine print. He was bound to provide a certain amount of jobs and give a certain amount of revenue, in taxes, to the United States of Siberia. Not to mention a certain amount of lumber, to help with the rebuilding of so many homes destroyed in the unification of the east. That would be done with Walton lumber.\n\nIt wasn't simply Johnny either. All of the American companies that had come here were trapped for at least a decade, if not more. It had been so simple. The government here knew American companies would be too eager to expand, too happy to jump the gun. Like Johnny had.\n\nHe pulled another draw from his cigarette, gazing out the window of his Oregan beach home. He would have to sell it soon to keep the company in the black. "Damn you, WerBell!"

Those men were mostly foreigners, united only by the cause of greed. His upbringing warned him of the foreign imperialists, but the Soviet Union was a distant memory now. The glowing neon sign that read 'Coca-Cola' in American letters. He was certain the Cyrillic sign would come up any day now. It's what it promised. American imports had flooded Magadan, giving it life. New jobs were popping up everywhere. To match demand, he had been promoted at the docks and now directed an entire team of dockworkers to handle the cargo. That had been money in his pocket and food on his table aplenty. It was imaginable when compared to the rule of the fascists only years prior. It was time to celebrate!\n\n"Vladimir!" Dmitri called out in the dusty autoparts hall. "Vladimir you bastard, I have vodka, don't make me drink it alone! Let me pay you back all those times I sipped from your bottle, eh?"\n\nNothing answered his call. He realized the shop was quiet, not a soul present. It was then he noticed the boxes, most everything packed up and ready to go. Dmitri hurried to Vladimir's house, where he spoke to him on the doorstep.\n\n"Americans," Vladimir said with his eyes sunken to the floor. "Place is crawling with the cars you notice. No one wants their old, twenty years out of date Soviet era shit anymore. They want real automobiles. I'm sorry Dmitri, but I'm moving my family to a farm down south, where my sister lives with her husband's family. We'll go drinking when the work is done."\n\nIt was the same story repeated a hundred times. If the Americans could make it, they made it cheaper and better.

Of course, any theory outside of 'here to break us up' would be wishful thinking, and even the most hopeful of the gathered workers knew that. As the first boot hit pavement, all eyes snapped to 10 or so men in riot gear piling out of the vehicles and pushing towards the picket line.\n\nThe shouting only got louder. Chaos was reaching its boiling point, ready to rise and flow over the lip of its vessel. Much like boiling water, it began with a pop and a fizzle. More specifically, the pop of a tear gas canister being launched and the fizzle of its contents filling the air. Maxim, in the far back, only began to realize what was going on when the men in front of him began doubling over and staggering aside with their faces in their shirts. Soon it reached him, jerking tears from his eyes and blurring his vision. All he could ascertain was that something was burning as he stumbled his way towards the edge of the cloud, tumbling onto the pavement just beyond its edge.\n\nDesperately wiping the sting out of his eyes with his sleeve, he heard one of the officers speaking over the anarchic shouting, hacking, grunting and coughing.\n\n"This is now officially an illegal gathering.

His workers with the workers of other new industrialists carving out a name with the little capital available to them in this new country. Well - the only reason Savin knew about this was the information from the government. This crazy mercenary experiment had produced competent spies. Being friends with America's intelligence community had to count for something huh?\n\nIt was going to be a general strike in a week, all across the ammunition sector. It would cripple production... but Savin knew about this whole his competition didn't. Because he always offered the government the best contracts, because Savin made the least fuss. If he could make up for the loss in labor quickly, he could corner the market.\n\nHe picked up the phone on his desk not far to his smoldering cigarette, "Hello, Sergei?

"Never expected so much money to be passing through a place like this." He muttered to himself, more than mildly impressed as he reflected on the sight before him.\n\nA cargo freighter was being loaded with crates of diamonds and gold taken from the rich mines of Yakutsk, and carried aboard in large crates by a team of longshoremen. These men were hired by the American company Warner worked for, which also owned the freighter and had paid for the diamonds, doubtless to be brought to some destination in the United States are sold there at high prices.\n\nSuch sights were common in the ports of the Far East, these days.

However, Vladivostok is a Russian city no more. After years of seemingly relentless work on improving its capabilities, it has finally emerged as a significant port along the Pacific, drawing in trade from Shanghai to San Francisco, as entrepreneurs and investors seek to extract the vast untapped resources of Russia in general and the Far East in particular through the safest and warmest large port remaining under the control of Russians themselves, and not the German or Japanese occupiers. It now serves to enrich not only those who control it and those who do business in it, but even those ordinary people who live in and around it. Most importantly, it has led to a greater role for the United States of Siberia on the world stage, giving it real power and influence in its own right in dealings with friend and foe alike."

Industry was expanding at an incredible pace. Resource extraction was increasing, in both capacity and efficiency. Overall commercial participation, both domestic and foreign, continued to increase.\n\nAnd as he well knew, it was all thanks to his government, and his policies. How could it not be? The communists, fascists, and fundamentalists that had once contended dominance over the Russian Far East had utterly failed to leverage the near-limitless resources of the land. But he had not.\n\nHe had brought good old-fashioned American ingenuity and entrepreneurship to this once darkened land. He had brought the light of progress.

She shivered in her fur coat, a gift from a friend - or is it a former friend? - and her breaths came in gusts of white and gray, as trembling fingers plucked the cigarette from its place.\n\nThe pavement clicked beside her, and she reflexively reached for her holster. Nothing was there, much less a gun. Old habits die hard. She eased up, taking in the full figure of her friend - or is it former friend? He reeked of whisky, although he tried his best to mask the odor beneath a layer of perfume. Strange. She did not recall him doing anything of the sort, not least to someone he disagreed with. Maybe he was still a friend. Taking up her voice above the volume of the waves, she started to speak, her tone tempered by the arguments they had. "You seem different today," she said. "What's the occasion?"\n\nHe greeted her with a smirk. "I don't know," he said, pretending to take offense. "I was going to say goodbye to a friend.

He handed her the box. "There's something in there - a real antique. Don't lose it." Before she could reply, he had started walking away.\n\n"Goodbye!" She shouted at the top of her voice. The waves and the wind stole the reply."
 westalaska.48.a: "Goodbye."

 westalaska.49.t: "A Familiar and Foreign Land"
 westalaska.49.desc: "It had been forty years and some change since Jack Ray set foot in Magadan. The city had changed since then. He had proudly followed the stars and stripes all those years ago. Of course, he was a shithead kid who lied about his age to get in at fifteen. His brief year spent as part of the American Expeditionary Force fighting alongside the Whites made Jack into the man he was: a killer, a soldier. Now he was pushing fifty and this was all he knew. It felt right to return to it, to become a part of the nation that was being built here.\n\nHe hadn't had the privilege of sticking with the Whites to the bitter end. Instead he would be part of the rear action in Scotland, against the Germans. When the South African War began, he was too old to take part. But the West Alaskan Republic would take him. He brought his own gun and his years of experience to Magadan, ready to serve as one of the countless new mercenaries answering WerBell's call. A stream of Czech, Pole, Manchu, French, Scot, Irish, Mexican, and Argentinian men stepped off with him. Jack had to give it to WerBell, crazy bastard knew how to bring soldiers together. As he looked out across the docks, he saw plenty of soldiers young and old. Behind him on the waves were two more ships, packed with what he had to assume were men and material. Jack had to keep reminding himself it was really happening.\n\nWith two arms raised in the air, Jack said in his clipped Russian, "I'm back, bastards!" The other men on the dock gave a ragged cheer as they welcomed another outcast into the ranks of their growing nation."

Really think your old Colt will be able to save your family?\n\nYou can be sure the crowd will regret picking your car when you pull one of these from the glove box:\n\nGet your hands in the Military Armaments Corporation M-10, the gun that conquered Russia. Designed by the genius gunsmith John Ingram, this compact .45 machine gun is only a bit larger than your usual pistol. Still, it packs more punch than the Army's Grease Gun: 700 words of friendly persuasion a minute that will make the whole mob will run and don't look back with just one quick trigger pull.\n\nIf you are a man of action who is not content with just protecting your car or your law, we offer you the MAC Operational Briefcase. With a leather finish and a semi-rigid structure, you will be able to carry your guardian angel anywhere you go and make it rain hell with the click of a button.\n\nBut if your biggest problem is that annoying neighbor, the local communist agitator, or a curious Federal Agent, what you need is a legitimate SIONICS silencer. A creation of President WerBell himself, this masterpiece makes your M-10 so quiet you can have a pleasant conversation on a telephone while throwing some lead down range.\n\nIf you have the tax stamp in hand, just call the number on the screen right now to get your M-10 delivered from Magadan straight to your doorstep."

Equipped with the latest in military technology, the West Alaskan Expeditionary Force, or WAEF is ready and able to help any nation or people fight!"\n\n"Now, I know you may ask "Oh Freddy, these guys might not even understand what we speak, or they may kill us!". Well, not to worry my friends, for WAEF is not only professional in all of its actions thanks to its rigid discipline but also is multinational and able to speak almost any language in the world!"\n\n"So, what are you waiting for? Hire the WAEF today! No matter if it is from the jungles of Africa to the hills of Britain, we'll be there!

No longer did Anatoly swear allegiance to the Tsar and faithfully discharge his duties as mayor in his name. Anatoly's duties were the same, but now he performed them for the up-jumped American mercenary.\n\nThe green and white flag of the Principality had been removed from his office, replaced by the West Alaskan colors. Anatoly could have laughed, "West Alaska", what a ridiculous notion. He could have laughed, but he didn't. The mayor hadn't retained his position for so long by snickering whenever soldiers sauntered into his town. No, he kept his mouth shut and his head down. So, Anatoly sat in his office, arranging his pencils and hoping that he could continue to protect the people in his care.\n\nTrue, there had been angry complaints, diehard Whites threatened to kill him for not fighting to the death against WerBell's mercenaries, but what could he do? Dead, Anatoly could do nothing, but as a collaborator, as mayor, he could continue to do what was best for his people. Anatoly sighed, leaning back in his chair. He wondered if the townsfolk would forgive him one day. Snow fell quietly onto the rooftops, and Anatoly slipped into the comfortable silence of the condemned."

 westalaska.53.t: "Who Owns the Pig?"
 westalaska.53.desc: "Gerry Patrick Hemming's Russian wasn't especially good, but it had been slowly improving since his arrival in Magadan. Before him were two Russian farmers, locals of the parcel of land WerBell had assigned him to oversee. Both were dirty, with unkempt beards and patched clothing, almost a comical representation of the Russian peasantry. Seated at his desk, armed guards at his side, Hemming struggled to follow the thread of the conversation. In their provincial Russian, the peasants jabbered and pointed fingers at one another in an accusatory fashion.\n\n"Okay," said Hemming in his elementary Russian, "Oleg, you say that Petr stole your pig?" Oleg nodded, dark eyebrows bouncing as he scowled at Petr. "And Petr, you deny this?" Petr also nodded, glaring at his accuser. "And I understand that there's no witnesses or receipt of sale of said pig?"\n\nOleg scowled, "I don't need a receipt, the thief took my pig right from my pen!"\n\n"Liar!" shouted Petr, who was held back by one of the guards as he rounded on Oleg.\n\n"Jesus," said Hemming, "everyone calm down! Oleg, you have no proof that the pig was yours, and Petr, you also can't prove ownership. Tell you what, you drop this and play nice with each other and I'll buy you a pig, Oleg. Everyone wins."\n\nOleg grinned, revealing missing teeth, "yes, I will drop my complaint."\n\n"Okay," answered Hemming, glad the situation was simmering down, "my people will talk to you tomorrow." The peasants filed out and Hemming rubbed his temples. He felt like a medieval count settling disputes, not military governor. Such were things in West Alaska, he supposed."

Said altercation has ended with the death of the politician involved to multiple stab rounds, with Peters stating that, and I quote, "The fucker deserved it for being a pretentious ass."\n\nWhile owing to his senior status, Peters has managed to escape punishment, our relations with the local population have noticeably worsened."

 westalaska.55.t: "The Magadan Studies and Observation Group"
 westalaska.55.desc: "To the customs officials at Magadan's airport, the men arriving were simply more soldiers of fortune, scruffy recruits from all over the world, come to find the fortunes in the new promised land of looting and exploitation.\n\nWhich was exactly what those men, entering on separate flights, during separate inspection shifts, and from wildly different backgrounds, wanted. The Agency, and by extension the United States, could not be publicly seen to be supporting a warlord strongman with no legitimacy whatsoever. Which was what they knew WerBell to be, regardless of the lands or titles he had bestowed upon himself. But his success was nevertheless in America's interest, and thus they had been dispatched.\n\nTheir task was simple. The rag-tag mercenaries WerBell relied upon for his 'army,' such as it was, were very competent at the age-old mercenary pastime of shooting and robbing unarmed or barely-armed civilian rabble. But they were very much not competent at just about everything else. That would change. The men, experts of warzones the world over, would train these scum into a more effective force.\n\nThey would smile and patiently instruct them, and participate in operations as embedded advisors and field observers. They would hide the deep disdain and loathing that they held for mercenaries and traitors alike, because they had been ordered to do so. And in doing so, they would ensure victory for America's interests and needs.\n\nIt was not, for most of them, the first time. They had done so before, with similarly unpleasant men. And it would certainly not be the last time either."
 westalaska.55.a: "One more wasteland for the Agency."

 westalaska.56.t: "A Matryoshka's Many Faces"
 westalaska.56.desc: "WerBell was quietly watching his television, patiently waiting for his own speech, one addressed to all citizens of the United States of Siberia so as to assure them the country's growth and its firm sovereignty. Most surprising would be that this speech would be entirely in Russian, something surprising considering that Mitchell couldn't speak a lick of it. But who said it had to be him doing the talking? He leaned forward as the screen lit up and his face showed up.\n\n"My fellow countrymen." he said, in perfect Russian. His lips were moving but his words didn't match up with their flapping, a thing easily explained as the President had a Russian merc dub over the recording of his speech, one initially in English. A light chuckle escaped through his teeths as he recalled the making of this subterfuge, used so the public would think of him as one of their own.\n\n"I, President WerBell, am addressing you concerning our nation and its history during the last few years, one not without its fair share of troubles: a warlord state amongst many others in this cold land, our Republic now encompasses a vast amount of Russia. Employment across Siberia has gone up as well as overall quality of life for its citizens. Our country is now one with strong institutions ensuring peace and stability for each and every one of its inhabitants, a proud and independent country and one that will stay free of foreign influence. This is my promise to you."\n\nA promise dead on arrival as the USS was backed by the CIA through covert means. Hell, its President was an American mercenary with a flimsy claim of Russian heritage. "And so, on this promise, I bid you goodnight and may God bless the United States of Siberia."\n\nAs the screen faded to black, a few notes of Stravinsky's Russian dance could be heard, and WerBell's grin could be seen irradiating in the dark."

 westalaska.57.desc: "Handshakes, fake smiles and whisky shots are three things diplomats must be acquainted with in order to broker deals.\n\nThe Stars-Spangled Banner could be seen waving atop a small ship entering Magadan's port, a place so very far from home. Well-suited men were standing on the its bridge, furrowed brows on their faces as they looked to the congregation of brawny men in battle-worn uniforms standing on the harbor's edge, solemnly waiting for their arrival.\n\nAs the Americans landed, one of the burly figures stepped forward and quickly shook each of the envoys's hands, nearly breaking their feeble wrists in the process of doing so.\n\n"Welcome to West Alaska gentlemen, a place not so different than the good ol' US of A, so you won't get homesick. Let's get you to your quarters, shall we? We can talk more over a glass of whisky and toast to the great budding friendship between our countries, eh?"\n\nThe diplomats at each other, visibly flabbergasted at the mercenary's bluntness and get down to business approach. Then again, whisky seemed alluring as the cold wind blew over the harbor..."

 #Blackbear event chain
 westalaska.58.t: "Boot Camp"
 westalaska.58.desc: ""Gun. Give," barked a voice behind Jack Svoboda's back, tearing his attention from the row of bottles yonder. For all of a second he thought a grizzly bear learned how to walk; man certainly towered over him like one, clad head to toe in furs to match. Only the outstretched hand dispelled all manbear thoughts; before they could return, Jack handed his father's gun over.\n\nAnd then it flew up and went crack- crack- crack. Three bullets flew with Siberia's winds and toppled three shattered bottles into the snow. The manbear did in three seconds what Jack couldn't with thirty - he resisted the urge to gape.\n\n"Elbow bent, leg too wide and shaking," said the bulky man in harsh, broken English. "Close eye when trigger pull. Move with recoil like grass in wind." He held Jack's gun closer, inspecting the fine patterns that ran its length. "Revolver with ivory handle and fancy drawing. Useless." Without looking away he continued, "Zapadnaya Alyaska no place for child playing toy soldier. Where from?"\n\n"T-Texas," muttered Jack hurriedly.\n\n"Amerikanskiy, eh? Think you are cowboy hunting Indian in forest? Keep shooting like debil and men here slit your throat with vodka bottle themself." The man turned to the range's other five curious shooters. "This go for everyone who come to Magadan. Here you not fight naked Tatar with bow; you fight army with more gun and brain than you all combine. Forget Hollywood der'mo. You are Blackbear, finest soldier of fortune in entire world. And we teach you to fight like one - or you die like one."\n\nThe Texan had barely gathered himself when the Russian walked away. "Wait!" he called. "My gun, uh, sir...?"\n\n"Get better gun from Supplies. And tell Trofim Boss sent you.""

Ten klicks away from civilization and buried in sub-zero snow, now-Private Jack Svoboda had a lot to bitch about: his stomach suffered hunger pangs for want of breakfast, and his legs still ached from yesterday's march. Frost bit into skin like the fatigues weren't there. Half a brain went to keeping his mouth shut; half prayed a witless bastard would enter his scope before sundown.\n\nAnd like his gripes were an invocation, the radio blared alive. "Python," crackled its Russian-tinged static, "Patrol, two at treeline north, 300 yard. I take left. In three."\n\nFucking finally! "Copy Boss," Jack near-shouted as he reoriented his Springfield towards the forest's edge. As promised, two men shuffled out from the trees, their arctic camouflage given away by gunmetal black. Why they were here and what for were fleeting thoughts to the tired, hungry merc. Sooner these yahoos drop dead, sooner he RTBs to a warm meal.\n\nJack swallowed a breath and held, like Młynarz taught. Hands steadied, he peered through the scope. The patrol had stopped: Left's buddy neared a pine and fiddled with his zipper. Trigger squeezed, fine cross inched to the pisser's head, that's right, just painting the snow yellow before a bullet blows his brains out in one-\n\n"Three." Crack. The 30-06 flew and hit snow. Heads swiveled in panic; another crack, more distant, before Left lost his. His buddy had barely covered up before a third knocked him face-first into his own piss.\n\nJust like that, Jack had missed his ration ticket for tonight."

 westalaska.60.desc: ""So I was thinking."\n\nSergeant "Python" Jack mulled the medic's question over as he kept watch ahead of the makeshift camp. Pitch-black midnight shifts and idle chatter never led anywhere good. Then again... "You're always thinking, Seong. But granted."\n\n"Well..." drawled Seong "Kay" Jung-Hwa on his cot. "doesn't all this sound like the silver screens? Bunch of mercs flock to a land of warlords, take things into their own hands and carve a place to call their own. All you need's John Wayne, Joan Fontaine, a hackneyed romance plot and-" he clapped, "-bam! Blockbuster of the year."\n\nAcross Kay sat Kazimierz "Kaz" Młynarz. Ember and spark glinted off rimmed sunglasses seemingly fused to the support gunner's head. "Like Boss said, Kay: keep Hollywood in Hollywood. Unless we're living in a fever dream of yours, West Alaska is our home now. One by and for those without."\n\n"Boss this, Boss that- bah, say something yourself for a change!" Kay retorted. "And I'm not the one who dresses up like a cowboy and twirls his pistols around. That's Baldie!"\n\nHe pointed at Adam "Shashka" Abramov, who was twirling revolvers on each hand. "Mark of good taste, my Korean friend. It say a lot more about you than me. Chasseur, if you can educate the young virgin on woman's wants?"\n\n"Chasseur" Mirielle whistled twice as the silent sniper fed a round to her scoped MAS-36. Someone was close. Before the conversation fully died, Jack leveled his rifle at rustling bushes where the clearing met trees. Thunder split the air twice, and a body hit snow with a soft, distant thud.\n\nTen more emerged with brandished guns."

 wa_superregional.1.desc: "Mitchell WerBell III looked out over the Siberian expanse, cigar clamped in his teeth. The Wizard of Whispering Death was clad in heavy furs against the cold of the Russian Far East, though the cold still stung his cheeks. He didn't care, today was his day. Central Siberia was finally in his hands, the misfits, fanatics, and goons of the region now six feet under, goddamn, today was a good day to be Mitchell WerBell III.\n\nThe lights of Chita twinkled below him from his balcony atop the former Tsar's palace, just as the bright Siberian stars shone above him. WerBell was always surprised at how bright the stars could be on the frontier.\n\nHe chuckled to himself at that. The frontier this certainly was, and WerBell was a trailblazing cowboy with American guns and toys, ready to make his mark on this savage land. Yes, that's what he would call it, his frontier, his United States of Siberia.\n\nHe could hardly believe the circumstances that had brought him to this place. The call from Vonsiatsky, the coup, the subsequent wars. Everything could have turned on a dime and sunk WerBell like a stone, but Lady Luck had been in his corner the whole time.\n\nThe Wizard of Whispering Death let out a cloud of smoke against the night sky, savoring in his victory and in the tobacco haze, could taste future victories to come."

 wa_superregional.2.desc: "They were a sorry lot, Vasily knew, but they were all Russia had against the American Monster of the East. Soldiers from Tomsk, anarchists, Siloviks, Rurik loyalists, mutineers, and Red Army vestiges made up their force. They numbered, at most two hundred at the start, but skirmishes with the mercenaries had dwindled their numbers further, and now there perhaps forty of them left. They hugged the treeline, these last warriors of Central Siberia, watching the truck convoy of the so-called United States of Siberia roll through the woods. They were outnumbered by the mercenaries, but a quick strike might earn them much-needed supplies and another day of resistance.\n\nLudmilla, a Silovik, peered through the sights of her rifle, waiting for Vasily's signal. Petr, an anarchist, raised his RPG. Finally, Vasily waved his hand forwards. Ludmilla's rifle cracked, Petr's RPG roared, and a dozen other small-arms weapons discharged on the convoy. A rocket slammed into the side of a truck, the explosion flipping it on its side in a fiery conflagration. A bullet ate brain meat and the driver of the lead truck fell dead, the vehicle careening into a tree. All was chaos and death as mercenaries shouted and sighted targets, partisans rushing down to grab what equipment they could.\n\nVasily scampered over a dead mercenary, rushing to the back of one of the downed trucks. He tore open the tarp, and gave a quiet cheer as he saw the medical crates his movement so desperately needed. He gave a start, whirling as he felt a harsh thump in his ribs. Had someone struck him? Vasily turned, wondering why his vision was swimming. A black man in sunglasses with one of the fancy American rifles fired again, his second shot taking Vasily out at the knees. As his vision faded, Vasily watched as his companions fell, their final raid all for nothing."

That included the big fish for her new agency. When she left the capitol she was an agent with a handler. Now she was a Director for the Department Domestic Conspiracies in the Strategic Service Unit. It felt good, it felt... official. In the van with her was a new recruit on his first mission. Next to him was a CIA instructor, who pretended to not be CIA but a normal American mercenary. In the building across the street was a meeting of students being radicalized by a firebrand. In the building next to them... twenty or so agents ready to strike at a moment's notice. Katya knew better than to trust him.\n\n"Have they said anything important?" Katya asked the recruit. The young man shook his head. Katya let out a sigh. "Seems this isn't working," Katya said, then she waited and added, "Alright. We're going in."\n\nMr. CIA let out a gasp, then said in his clipped Russian, "You can't be doing that. Evidence!" Katya turned to him with a grin, cocking back her M1911. "Our States aren't your States, cowboy." The recruit racked back a German surplus rifle and the three of them bursted inside of the meeting. It was a congregation of some youth agitators who wanted a return to socialism. A picture of Sablin hung at the corner which made Katya almost gag. Couldn't these types find someone else to idolize? At least Lenin had a nice beard. Her intuition to march in was correct. The leader was hoarding stolen guns from the army surplus. It was a win then, to stop this idiot before he got them all these kids killed.\n\n"What are you going to do with them?" Mr. CIA asked once the last were put up. "The leader?" Katya replied, "Ten years for the theft probably. The others we can shame and threaten, split them up. Maybe bug their landlines at home to see if they try anything after."

This man would be his protector for the rest of time. Anatoly had held a significant post in Novosibirsk and unlike everyone of a similar rank, was willing to work with the madman from Magadan. Not that it had made him any friends. Already every single colleague had greeted the Provisional Governor of the State of Novosibirsk with death threats. Pinned to his door with a knife, of course. Just to drive that little detail home. Anatoly looked for solace among the many mercenaries flowing into his city but found only the Congolese a decent drinking companion. Largely because he didn't speak. The others were loud, largely foreign mob that had no respect for anything besides their own pockets!\n\nIt wasn't like his work was particularly important either. He signed off on orders to repair railway lines, rebuild factories, and repurpose old military surplus to be used by the...Oh it was such a ridiculous fucking name! The United States of Siberia? He had sold his soul not to the devil, but to an idiot. Still... The post brought him prestige, no small amount of money, and influence with the Senators of the other states for helping grease the wheels of bureaucracy in their favor. If it helped the people of Novosibirsk, all the better no?\n\nAs he contemplated these matters, several bullets richoted from his window. The Congolese tackled him to the floor as others opened fire.

"We bet everything on supporting this, this - I don't even know if you can call this place a country!"\n\nThe Captain calmly let the man's complaints roll off him like water off a rock. His grin was plastered from ear to ear on his face. It was a rictus grin, not a friendly one. The Captain's teeth were grinding together, a vein on his forehead bulged. When the Captain's hand drifted towards his pistol, the mouthy executive shut up.\n\n"What we have here, is a failure of communication. You've been well compensated for your investments, but we have no more need of any of you. Your citizenship has been revoked, your worker visas have been rescinded, you are all leaving right away. And don't think the companies staying will fall on their swords to help you, because they won't. We need them. We don't need you. Bye bye." The Captain gestured for the group to get a move on. He was a hardened mercenary, all of them were coddled American industrialists. The group did what he said and there wasn't any incidents as they left the United States of Siberia for good."

 wa_superregional.7.desc: "While the mercenary core of Siberia's military was among the more experienced forces in the world, the same could not quite be said about the natives who made up the vast majority of the population - the population they'd need to recruit in order to conduct a large scale war against western Russia. WerBell had repeatedly been cautioned to keep his expectations low, so he was prepared for the worst as he watched the newest batch parade about the training grounds.\n\nHe focused on their every move, noting every step out of line and each miniscule fault of the soldiers. After fighting with and against so many different militaries in so many different conflicts, WerBell was something of an expert at identifying the combat effectiveness of any unit rather quickly. He tallied the mistakes in his head and measured them against his expectations before turning to the general at his right.\n\n"You know what, they're not half-bad!"\n\nThe general was visibly relieved. "Not for lack of trying, Mitch. I swear sometimes they were purposefully forgetting which leg to start a march with."\n\n"Well they got it now, that's what matters. I'm convinced we can work with what we got here. Tell me how they handle those small arms we got from Uncle Sam."\n\n"They can handle them all right. Most of 'em can shoot anything you point them towards within 500 yards, just don't ask them to hit anywhere specific."\n\nWerBell felt reassured, but still gave a slight frown.

 wa_superregional.8.desc: ""DESTINY AWAITS" read the recruitment poster, its artwork depicting several arrows punching into Western Russia. WerBell found the transition between approving a poster on his desk and seeing it plastered everywhere a little strange, but such was life. God, how far had they come? He'd gone from a mercenary working for a fascist to the President of half the former Soviet Union. No matter what happened now, he'd made his mark.\n\nYet that wasn't enough. If he just wanted to be remembered, he'd have gone out in an amphetamine rush in some battlefield long ago. He was after something more: guns, booze, and glory! Oh, how the old days called back to him sometimes... but no, not that either. WerBell was invested in Russia now. If he wanted to leave, he could have left with a fortune by '64. He sat at this desk every day because he believed in this project, however insane it is.\n\nWerBell glanced over at the maps on his desk, looking over the lines and arrows that made up his plan to invade West Russia - nothing like the arrows on the poster. In the early days, the army was little more than professional bandits. They invaded what they could to take what they needed to live. Now they were thriving, and Russia was too! Magadan's port was more crowded every day, maritime shipping breathing life into Siberia's economy. Russians lived with a measure of prosperity they hadn't seen since '45, and they knew it. WerBell felt proud of himself. He was cultivating something beautiful in this accursed land, something Russia had only seen briefly in its entire history: Democracy.\n\nRussia would come to enjoy the same freedoms Americans have had since 1776, and its people would love liberty just like God-fearing Americans did back home. Let the hordes to the west assemble on the border, WerBell thought. He had fate on his side, and the most badass army the world had ever seen at his back."

 wa_superregional.9.desc: ""I'm sorry Mr. Nakamura, there is nothing more I could do," the new Senator for the state of Kamchatka, Lev Semenov, said to the aging man. Mr. Nakamura was the representative for the few hundred individuals who identified as Ainu in the state Lev represented. Nakamura shook his head, going into the same speech given a hundred times. Under the Tsar, under the Japanese, and under the Communists each and every time the Ainu were persecuted. Already many had been executed in the forced conversion strategies of their oppressors. And now they were denied a state of their own?\n\nLev sympathized with them. He truly did. He had fought alongside two Ainu mercenaries during the early days of WerBell's grand scheme. Good, fierce men from a hardy culture. Now as a Senator, it was his duty to help them. Unfortunately, there simply wasn't enough Ainu living to justify the creation of their own state.\n\n"Mr. Nakamura, that wasn't the only reason I called you here. You see... Having spoken to the President himself I am confident we can secure for you and your people a privileged minority status. Many other Siberian ethnicities are receiving the same. It helps that for such a small population, the Ainu have contributed quite a few capable soldiers. You understand that soldiers hold quite a powerful sway in our nation, yes?"\n\nLev left the meeting feeling happy, knowing that dozens of conversations were happening as the new states were put into effect. He wasn't sure where this experiment of a country might end up. He wasn't certain of the foreign influence either, for that matter. What he was certain of that he was going to set a precedent, here, in the poorest state of this new federal union. There was hope on the horizon for Lev, who started out only as a mercenary from Manchuria. Before the old man left his office, he turned and said to Lev,"

 wa_superregional.10.desc: "Glasses clinked, laughter roared, and corks soared. The sounds of celebration almost drowned out his thoughts, but WerBell was determined to take a second to think about what got him here before drowning in alcohol and women.\n\nThey did it. They actually fucking did it. All of free Russia now laid beneath the eagle's wing, the light of American-style democracy banishing the darkness of the anarchy. Since the declaration of unification, foreign investments increased tenfold. Any corporation worth a damn in the free world has opened its first establishments on Russian soil, bringing half the planets' products to a people who have never even seen a modern radio. The demand for foreign goods was never satiated, and back home business was booming.\n\nSpeaking of business, the United States of Russia was now firmly established as the preeminent exporter of mercenaries worldwide, changing the tide of many a civil war in the name of gold and glory. Those who called it the Mercenary State usually do so as an insult, an attempt to question the legitimacy of the USR's rule, but WerBell accepted that name with pride. Never had a nation like his existed, and never will one again.\n\nOf course, some weren't happy with the result. Fuck 'em. There never was a mercenary who cared about the complaints of liberal pussies back home, and WerBell was no exception. Domestically, however, there were a number of Russians protesting his rule, something he did take more seriously. WerBell wasn't too worried about it, though. He could only imagine the culture shock they were experiencing; in only ten years Russians had gone from taking pot shots at each other with Mosin-Nagants to driving American cars and enjoying American freedom. They'd get used to it, he knew. He'd make Texans of them yet.\n\nAs his train of thought concluded, something caught his eye. Two somethings, to be exact, and some of the biggest ones he'd ever seen. WerBell still didn't speak much Russian, but a wink was worth a thousand words. As she approached him with an experienced stride, the old mercenary indulged in one final thought:"

"We're here 'cus we kicked everyone else's ass with half the men and twice the backbone, that's the long and short of it. We've never had a favourable amount of soldiers, or guns, or hell even popular support, and now half of this beautiful wasteland is under our banner. Do ya get what I'm saying?"\n\nThe aide spoke up, "I believe I-"\n\n"Rhetorical question, god dammit," WerBell chuckled for a moment before continuing. "Our army has served and currently serves in more conflicts around the world than any superpower. From here in Siberia to Africa and the Middle East, our men fight, bleed, and die. Other nations might have more industry, better designs, and limitless conscripts, but we have the experience, the discipline, and a history of using both to send superior forces running with their tails between their legs. The Siberian Army is the best fighting force this side of Moskowien, and it'll be the best in the goddamn world before I'm through!"\n\nThe old mercenary took a breath after his miniature speech, refocusing on the man in front of him as he steadied himself.\n\n"Now, what else does the army need?"\n\nThe aide opened his mouth for a second, but then closed it, staring at his President wide-eyed like a deer struck dumb in the headlights of a car.

His editor had just placed the file in front of him, and he could barely believe what he was reading. "Bob, you're a funny guy, I gotta tell you," he chuckled. "But you really didn't have to go to all this effort for a practical joke."\n\n"This isn't a prank, Pat," his editor replied. "Everything in that file seems to be at least half-true."\n\nPatrick looked it over again. "What, you're telling me that some American mercenary went over to Russia and...took over from a gang of Russian fascists? Bob, that's crazy. It sounds like something out of an adventure novel. A bad one."\n\nBob shrugged. "Maybe, maybe not. But there's been interest in it from some of the other papers, and we need to jump on this while we still got the chance. We managed to get you a way to Magadan, you're leaving first thing next week."\n\nPatrick stammered, "Uh, Bob, this sounds -I mean, c'mon Bob, you know Mary's expecting, I can't go on a long assignment like this."\n\n"Look, Patrick, it won't be that hard. You can head back whenever you want. You're one of the only Russian speakers here, we need you on this. OK? We'll make sure Mary is fine until you come back." Patrick thought it over, then nodded.

 MAG_WA_journalist.2.desc: "He'd heard stories from refugees and diplomats of postwar Russia; a land of bandits and starving peasants, where a warlord's army was lucky to be using equipment that would have been very familiar to Bukharin's Red Army. What he saw was not that. Men patrolled the streets with modern American, Japanese, even German equipment, with crisp uniforms and decent discipline. The people were still poor as shit, but the sight of so many who enjoyed so much foreign wealth, even if they were relatively few, made Magadan an anomaly.\n\nPatrick Sullivan stepped off the dock and found himself face to face with a tall man in military fatigues, an M14 slung over his shoulder. "I am looking for lodgings," Patrick asked the man in halting Russian; he knew he should have refreshed his skills since college.\n\n"I'm an American, dipshit," the soldier replied in English. "You're clearly not a Russian, but you're clearly not a merc either. So who are you?" Pat scrambled to pull his press badge out of his coat, and presented it to the soldier, who snatched it from him and read it over. He laughed as he handed the badge back. "So you're a journo? You're not the first to come here, but maybe you'll be the last to leave. Hey! Assholes!" he shouted at a group of soldiers playing cards nearby.

Had to take something as compensation, and the country suited me just fine."\n\n"You could have taken anything else and gone home, though," Sullivan countered. He was slightly worried about the glares WerBell's bodyguards were giving him, though WerBell himself seemed to be amused by Sullivan's questioning, even as he took aim at the next target on the range with his vintage Garand. After firing off a few shots, he turned back to Sullivan. "Did you serve in the war?"\n\n"Yeah. I was in Burma a while, and spent a lot of the war in Australia, in case Japan invaded."\n\n"So you know how to use this," WerBell remarked, extending him the Garand. Sullivan paused, then decided it was better to humor the mercenary. He took the rifle, and caught the clip tossed at him by one of the bodyguards. Loading the rifle, he took aim.\n\nEight shots later, he heard the sweet, familiar ping as the clip ejected. WerBell handed him the spotter scope, which Sullivan glanced through. He'd gotten five shots in the 9 ring, two in the 10, and one in the X. Twenty years on, and he was still decent at this.\n\n"Nice shooting. That feel good?" WerBell asked.\n\n"Yeah.

The second was the thump of mortar fire that jostled the entire post, quickly followed by his third; the "Hura!" of the Red Army soldiers charging his position. All around him, the mercenaries grabbed their rifles and manned their machine guns, discipline breaking down under the surprise and ferocity of the Red attack. He saw in the corner of his eye a section of trench get overrun, and three Red soldiers rushed to the emplacement where he and one other mercenary remained. Panic overtook him, and he grabbed for the first thing that he could use to defend himself; a hatchet.\n\nThe first soldier entered the emplacement. He seemed older than the others, but still inexperienced; he should have tossed a grenade first. He turned just in time to divert a fatal blow, but the hatchet was wedged firmly into his shoulder. He fell back onto the floor, screaming. The second hesitated for a fateful moment, then tried to shoot Sullivan, rather than use the bayonet. Sullivan grabbed the rifle just as it fired, keeping the shot away from him. He wrestled with the soldier for the Mosin, eventually forcing him against a wall. Pat immediately rammed the bayonet into his stomach.\n\nThe third, probably no older than 16, had been trying to avoid shooting his comrade, and now stood, mouth agape, as he watched his friend die. He began to raise his rifle when the last mercenary fired, scattering brain and bone everywhere.\n\nPatrick turned back to the first soldier, crying from the pain of the hatchet, as he saw a bloody man above him. His eyes widened. "Nyet! Nyet -" he pleaded, before Patrick drove the bayonet into his stomach. He squirmed, before rattling one last time.

It was all indicative of the very... aggressive entrepreneurial spirit he had encountered under WerBell, and even Sullivan, trying to write his story, joined in with the raucous mercenaries. The article could wait, life was short and the alcohol plenty.\n\nThey drank, laughed, told stories, and repeated the cycle until the "bar" was closed and the group was in a circle, either passed-out or soon to be.\n\n"How'd it feel?" Elizabeth "Liz" Thompson, an Australian mercenary, asked him.\n\n"It felt great, honestly," he slurred back. "Like back in Burma. The... simplicity of it all. Knowing what to do in a situation, what the stakes are... there's nothing like that back in the States." He sighed, and took another swig of the whiskey. "Honestly? Some days I dread going back.

He racked his brain for the words necessary to convey his emotions, a confusing mess in his mind.\n\nWhat was there to say? "Dear Mary, I'm sorry I abandoned you?" Was he sorry? When he was here, with WerBell's army, he felt the best he'd ever felt. He barely thought of his family back in America in the heat of the moment, and only slightly more when he was in Russia at all. "Dear Mary, I'm sorry your husband is a lying, cheating piece of shit?" He looked back at Liz, drinking in the bed, her nakedness covered only by the sheet. The two of them had been doing this for a while, and had celebrated the fall of Tomsk with an extended stay in one of the captured hotels. Liz was older than Mary by a full decade, closer to Patrick's age, and not as attractive conventionally, but she knew battle. When they were together, in the trenches or in bed, he felt a euphoria that Mary had never given him. Did he love his wife? He remembered he had, but did he still?\n\n"You want some?" Liz asked, offering him one of the special sugarcubes they'd brought to celebrate, temporarily interrupting his thoughts.\n\n"Not yet, Liz," he replied, before getting back to the letter. "Dear Mary... Dear Mary..." What could he even say? What would ever make up for the fact he barely remembered his daughter's name -was it Sarah or Barbara? - and had never seen her grow up? What would ever make up for the fact that he had failed as a husband? He drank from the glass of water next to him. Nothing, he knew. He would never be forgiven. He couldn't.\n\nHe grunted, crumpling the letter up and throwing it aside. He'd figure it out later, when his head was clearer. He climbed back into bed with Liz.

She's almost ten, Patrick, and you've never even met her!"\n\n"So that's her name..." he thought aloud, before realizing what he'd just said.\n\nA pause at the end of the line, then she laughed in disbelief. "I'm getting a lawyer and taking her with me. Don't look for us. Fuck you, Patrick." Then the dial tone.\n\nPatrick felt anger rush up in him, and only barely stopped himself from smashing the receiver to bits. He stepped outside and sat at the bench, watching the passengers go back and forth at SFO. He'd been like them, once, ten years ago. A family man, working a regular job. He pitied them, and his past self. They'd never know the things he'd done, not as he had. Not even the Pulitzer committee had when they'd mailed him the award. He sighed. He hated it here. The calm, the placidity, the... everything. Ten years on, Russia was still Russia; a land of guns, sweat, and adrenaline. A land none of these people would know.\n\nBut he was home. Didn't he want to be home? No, he realized. Home was Liz and MacKenzie. Home was the trench and the armory, the whiskey and the acid. Home was danger and euphoria. Not here. All he'd had left was Mary and his daughter, and now they were gone. Without them, he felt nothing for the ground he stood on.

This is not a small deficit, sir."\n\nMatkovsky dismissed the accountant soon after, sank into his chair, and began to think deeply about what could be done. He had begun this simple task without expectations - or so he thought, until the full picture became clearer, and he realized that the situation was even worse than he had expected.\n\nIt wasn't difficult to see where this was going, and a hypothetical quickly presented itself in his mind. The party becomes insolvent: others quickly notice, and leap at the chance to pick on a defenseless competitor. Perhaps it could happen in reverse. One competitor or another attacks, and the party is unable to muster up the resources necessary to survive. A singular conclusion thus arrived: continuing like this would mean driving the metaphorical car straight off a cliff.\n\nMatkovsky deemed this completely unacceptable, so there was much work to be done. He would have to use the next meeting with the War Council to snap the party of its complacency, and get things moving. The sooner that happened, the better.\n\nAs he lazily gazed out outside, he spotted a troop of soldiers marching in unison. He stepped closer to the window, peering carefully at them - yes, they wore those familiar gray papakhas. It reminded him of a memory, where decades ago men like them - good Siberian Riflemen - fought and died against the communists. A dream that they had ultimately failed to realize."

"Thank you for gathering here on such short notice," he began. " You may ask questions later. For now, while our ship is sinking, we need action, not words."\n\n"Because the situation we find ourselves in is so dire, I will be blunt with you," Matkovsky continued. "The Party is currently spending far more than it currently receives. If we do not change course immediately, we will soon face insolvency."\n\n"That is the bad news," he said, and some of the generals let out their breaths, relaxing a little. Matkovsky wasn't keen on letting that relief linger. "But if you think that you can just simply relax right now, then I can tell you that our party is already dead."\n\n"Now, the good news is that this is possible to fix. Our plan will be this." The generals shifted uncomfortably in their seats, waiting. "First, we must expand our industrial capacity. We must salvage and acquire it - by any means necessary. That alone will not be enough. As such, we will need to ask the Americans and leverage the diaspora for support. I hope we're not too proud to beg."\n\nThere were no objections, and Matkovsky swiftly motioned for a vote.

The endless marching, the biting cold, serving in an army led by tyrants. As he imagined it, each second began to stretch out into a painful eternity. Before he went in he decided, as an indulgence, to recall some of the memories of the last few months. He picked up a lilac almost in full bloom: absentmindedly, he began slowly, carefully, removing the petals one by one.\n\nA petal for the memory of that great hunt in the tundra. The boys were all so proud that day: they'd managed to catch a deer. It seemed so trivial now. Another petal for the time they sat round the fire in winter together, laughing as only they could. He remembered distinctly the sharp sourness of the lingonberry jam. There wouldn't be much of that in the army.\n\nThree petals, now. One for his father: his captain, his rock. One for his mother, who tried to hide her tears as she let go of her son. And one more - the final one - for Natasha, the love of his life, his soulmate. He wondered whether he would see her again, and he wasn't optimistic about his chances.\n\nThe air was cold, biting. He couldn't stay outside for much longer. Stamped draft papers in hand, he walked into his new life, finally standing before an officer of the Army. The officer smiled and directed him inside."
 matkovsky.smuta.3.a: ""Welcome to the Army, son.""

 matkovsky.smuta.4.t: "Woe Betide the Defeated"
 matkovsky.smuta.4.desc: "In a desolate valley surrounded by mountains, the air was engulfed in black smog as fire spewed from the windows of an isolated house. The fire remained young, while a man walked out the front door dragging a trunk. Surrounding the dying sigil of humanity, men garbed in black were scattered about hauling valuables towards a truck.\n\nTwo of these trucks were parked in front of the slowly dying building. One with two benches on either side and another with a flatbed that contained an array of items. The trunk from the house was placed in the latter, positioned carefully between a metal picture frame and a pitiful jewelry box. As the man passed the truck, he crossed the path of the unit's officer.\n\nClad in a distinct officer's hat and trench coat, the man, Stanislav, watched the chaos in front of him with a pleased look on his face. His thoughts were interrupted by the presence of one of his soldiers. "Stanislav, sir!" The man said while saluting, "We've tracked the residence's inhabitants down in the surrounding forest and disposed of them as you ordered."\n\nA satisfied expression appeared on the officer's face. With the Communist traitors disposed of, the last of his orders for this wretched stretch of the countryside were complete. Soon, he would be gone from here suffering in the cold. Stanislav patted the soldier's shoulder.\n\n"Good," Stanislav replied to his subordinate. He cleared his throat before continuing. "Alright men, dump whatever you have now in the back of the truck and get back here. We're heading back to Magadan!" The men obeyed systematically, fearing what might befall them if they didn't listen. Without any fanfare, the rare visit to this pocket of the earth was left behind, forgotten in the mix of its predecessors."
 matkovsky.smuta.4.a: "Barely a trace remained."

 matkovsky.smuta.5.t: "Cycles"
 matkovsky.smuta.5.desc: "Tweet! The sound of a whistle echoed throughout the factory floor, signaling the end of a shift. Sluggishly, men dragged themselves off their workstations and out into the pitch of midnight. Anton Volkov was one of these men, leaving in a fashion identical to that of his colleagues. Like them, he stumbled his way down into the empty streets of Magadan. After some time, the scattered workers had formed themselves into a silent-weary mob.\n\nFatigued, the mass of people trekked their way back to their apartments. All the while, they were pelted with a drizzle of cold rain. Their sorry reflections looked back at them from the sheen on the streets, laying pity and disappointment on what their lives had become. Meanwhile, the wind whistled through the rooftops, creating a hypnotic drone that set the blob mindless in their routine return.\n\nThe expressionless husk of people was interrupted by the thrumming of a passing car, before providing a loud honk at the wretched workers on the street. As the rest continued, Anton was awakened from his routine. He suddenly gained an awareness of his situation. The routine of sleep, work, and home, day after day without any breaks had finally set in for the worker. For as grateful as he was for having a job that paid, the isolation that accompanied it was not worth the loss of humanity.\n\nAs the rest of the men continued, Anton's steps became smaller. Slowly, he fell behind the rest of the group until he was left behind on his own. In the isolation of his thoughts, he concluded that anything, even miserable as being alone in the rain, was at least some form of variety, and right now, variety was a scarce commodity."
 matkovsky.smuta.5.a: "It was only a temporary escape."

 matkovsky.smuta.6.t: "Outlines of the Future"
 matkovsky.smuta.6.desc: ""I'm going to be straight with everyone here, our finances are in trouble, and something needs to be done. Now!" Matkovsky slammed his fist into the table adding new tension to the room. That was how the most recent party meeting started, with his cabinet all seated around him in agreement.\n\nThe room remained alarmingly silent. Members remained in fear of a proper response lest they end up in a part of Siberia colder than the President's immediate reception. Unfortunately for one individual, their cough echoed through the stress of the situation. All eyes had turned on them in hopes of a response.\n\nNervously, they stuttered out an answer. "Err, well um we could continue to ask the Americans for aid. Guns, trucks, vehicles, those kinds of things." He rushed out his next words. "I know that sounds crazy! However, if we can squeeze out enough from them, then they surely wouldn't abandon their investment further down the line.\n\nThe answer caused a knee-jerk reaction by another member. "Bah! Are you stupid? That's what got us here in the first place! We should look inward and take the spoils of the land. Looting and conscripting the resources of our enemies would keep us afloat. After all, they deserve it since they are traitors."\n\nMatkovsky nodded along at the debate, and upon seeing their leader's tolerance the party had broken into an argument, quickly forming sides between the two arguments. He thought both had some merit, but needed to consider it a little longer. However, the party did not need to know that. "That's enough talk. I think I've come to a solution from this meeting. You are all dismissed." As they piled out, he was now left alone to mull over the hard decision."
 matkovsky.smuta.6.a: "So long as an appearance was kept."

 matkovsky.smuta.7.t: "Losses and Gains"
 matkovsky.smuta.7.desc: ""And here Mr. President, you can see the trajectory of our finances have stabilized, a vast improvement from when we last met." The sound of moving papers filled the office. "Simultaneously if you look at the pie chart here, our foreign aid situation has also improved."\n\nNodding slowly, a smile grew on the President's face. "Very good." Flipping through the papers handed to him, he saw material needs for production met and his past worries washed away in the victory of his current success.\n\nHowever, what pleased him most was not the report, but its implications. With the finances of the party settled he as helmsman of the party would soon be able to reclaim the west. Not just communists and monarchists in the Far East, but past that.\n\nThoughts of marching with his army into Siberia and past the Urals filled his mind, along with the glories that accompanied it. Even the thought of someday pushing into Moscow and taking his country back filled his mind while he became leader of a newly unified Russia.\n\nThese thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a familiar voice. "Excuse me, Mr. President, are you alright? You've been staring at the wall smiling for the last five minutes."\n\nHis face grew warm as blood flowed to his cheeks. "Yes, thank you I'm fine. Everything is satisfactory, you are dismissed." Quickly, the accountant gathered up his papers and made for the door before he could leave though Matkovsky managed to give one final statement to the accountant.\n\n"Oh and if you tell anyone of this, you can expect to be in my office again, for different reasons." Hearing the instructions, he quickly nodded and shut the door, leaving the President alone in his office back to dream about his ambitions."
 matkovsky.smuta.7.a: "Ambitious goals for an ambitious man."

 matkovsky.smuta.8.t: "RFM Broadcast 589"
 matkovsky.smuta.8.desc: ""You're listening to Radio Free Magadan. Giving you the latest news that those communist bastards don't want you to hear. I'm Vasily-"\n\n"-And I'm Sergei, giving the latest news on the Smuta, as our glorious nation liberates Russia one town at a time."\n\n"In recent news, a small detachment of soldiers have recently secured a small town on the border of Amur, liberating it from the Nazi-loving scum. Why I think this calls for a drink of celebration!"\n\n"You've got that right, Vasily. Upon seeing their liberators, the town's inhabitants graciously showered the soldiers with rewards. Everything from vodka, to food and jewelry, was handed out. Boy, those country folk are real nice."\n\n"I agree, Sergei! In similar news, President Matkovsky has recently announced a new program to help rebuild the countryside. State funds and resources will be distributed to those who cooperate with the government."\n\n"Is that so? Well, it sounds like a great boon for those out in the wilderness. Certainly, nothing the traitors outside of Magadan would be generous enough to give. Why, if I were one of those fine country folk, I'd be running to my liberators with Yagoda's head just for the reward."\n\n"You could say that, Vasily. Well, this concludes the evening news from Radio Free Magadan, this is Sergei-"\n\n"-And Vasily signing off.""
 matkovsky.smuta.8.a: ""Now, back to your regularly scheduled music.""
 
 matkovsky.smuta.9.t: "From Shore to Shore, Sea to Sea"
 matkovsky.smuta.9.desc: "The clanking of boots on metal rang out throughout the ship. Young men rushed up to the deck at the news they had reached Russia. Peter was one of these, who had signed up for adventure in Magadan as the government there had advertised. As he finally laced his boots, he rose from where he sat to join his fellow volunteers.\n\nA blinding light was the first thing to greet the volunteer as he stepped on deck. However, its visage was rapidly replaced by the image of the coast. Gray-dull rocks just out from the coast, broken up only by the occasional wisping trails of snow and ice. Further, ahead a city could be made out, the legendary port of Magadan, but it was as dull and grey as the scenery surrounding it.\n\nPeter leaned on the railing in shock in a fashion identical to that of his peers. Brochures had promised an expansive mass of natural beauty that would be the land they would help reclaim. Instead, they got a wasteland that made Nunavut seem colorful. Peter's heart slowly sank as he grasped what he had gotten himself into.\n\nEventually, the container ship docked, and with it, the poor young souls disembarked. On Magadan's rotting piers, Peter saw vessels breaking the ice of the harbor to make way for ships to escape the snowy tundra. An escape he and the other men could only dream of. As they shambled their way across the port they eventually reached their new tormenter, the supposed leader of the RFP.\n\nHe greeted them with an energy that had long left the sorry men. "Ah, how good it is to finally meet. Welcome to Russia! I hope the trip was not too uncomfortable. Come, there is much we need to prepare you for." The group followed behind the overjoyed men, but for people like Peter, their minds still lingered on the immeasurable disappointment at the whole situation."
 matkovsky.smuta.9.a: "No one made eye contact with them."

 matkovsky.smuta.10.t: "A Letter From America"
 matkovsky.smuta.10.desc: "Esfir Kiseleva was the name attached to an envelope received by Galina. It was a name the old lady had not heard in years. The last time she heard it was attached to a little girl dragged along by her parents to America and that was more than 15 years ago. Now in her trembling hands was a link to someone she had long thought lost.\n\nImpatiently, Galina tore the envelope revealing a pocket watch, a letter, and some money. The watch was of fine craftsmanship. Meanwhile, the money in question was American. An unfortunate folly, the old woman thought, but the thought was excellent and there were places in town that were willing to exchange currencies. However, what intrigued Galina most though was the letter.\n\nHer eyes slowly scanned the white paper with care. "Dear Babushka, I hope this letter finds you safe. I know it has been a while since we have seen each other and mother and father were not fond of communicating, but here I am. We have been fine in America and doing alright all things considered.\n\n"I currently live in New York. It is a busy place, far from what life is like for you back in Russia. There are so many cars and buildings. Time Square feels unreal at times with the noise of millions walking through it each day. I currently work retail, in a jewelry store. That is how I was able to get the watch. I hope someday I can return to you when things are safer. Love, Esfir."\n\nGalina could not believe what she had read. At first, joy filled her at the news, before fear took over at the last few words. Quickly, she hastily grabbed a piece of paper and pencil but stopped after writing her name. East Siberia was a sleepy place, but it had grown more wakeful and anxious since her granddaughter had been here. Stuck in her contemplation, Galina turned to look at the window, searching the land outside for answers."
 matkovsky.smuta.10.a: "Meanwhile, the wind drowned out her frustrations."

 #### Werbell Smuta Events ####
 werbellsmuta.1.t: "The More Things Change"
 werbellsmuta.1.desc: "A squabbling bunch of thugs, buffoons and reactionaries was what most Magadanians saw the Russian Fascist Party for. A gang of rejects from Harbin that couldn't even hold their own party together. It was no surprise that few had any objection to the fall of it.\n\nWhile Magadan was never the loveliest place to live - being a transit hub for slave camps, the fascist stain further darkened the city. At least the NKVD had the veneer of discipline. Most of the blackshirts used to be street thugs!\n\nA blackshirt stood on nearly every street corner, harassing locals and enforcing the constantly shifting party line, and Nina was nearing her wit's end. She trudged the streets every day, head down, trying not to make eye contact with them, often knowing that she'd be screamed at anyway. 'Degenerate!' was one of the more common phrases, and one of the kinder ones. She was constantly questioned where she was headed, who she would be with - and if the thugs were unhappy in any way, she'd be thrown back home.\n\nSo when a mysterious American Expat waltzed into Magadan, she was the first to rejoice. For a week, the streets of Magadan felt alive again, or as alive as a half-frozen industrial hellscape could be. But days later, the familiar returned, a different uniform sure, a slightly different vocabulary - but ultimately the same men behind them.\n\nNina still found herself harassed, questioned and demeaned, dare she mutter anything under her breath. She knew that it would be debated within the populace whether they were being dealt with by a lighter hand. To some, it might be different. To Nina, though, in the end, almost nothing had changed."
 werbellsmuta.1.a: "And far more remained the same"

 werbellsmuta.2.t: "Under New Management"
 werbellsmuta.2.desc: "Most in Magadan were perplexed when the eccentric Mitchell WerBell III set up shop in town. In the weeks prior, a menagerie of equally strange characters began to walk the streets, speaking in tongues that few could understand. The American's agenda was indiscernible to most, but whatever it was - it was certainly being rapidly implemented.\n\nAside from the sudden influx of foreign ships, the most noticeable change was the vanishing of the Blackshirts from the streets. They were a plague on the streets, and terrorized the populace - making the frozen prison transport town somehow more insufferable than it was. They were more than comfortable harassing anyone who deviated from the ever-changing party-line - and whoever the individual goon decided they had a vendetta against on the day.\n\nNina, someone who resisted the fascists when they arrived in Magadan - couldn't tolerate their antics any longer. She wouldn't walk the streets alone. Otherwise, she'd risk them pinning her down or following her home - listening to every word, striking at any utterance that could be perceived as threatening the regime.\n\nSo she was the first to celebrate when one day, she awoke to streets empty of any signs of the RFPs henchman. People wondered and gossiped about where they could have vanished to. Some said and hoped they'd been purged, shot and buried. Others that they'd fled for other reasons.Nina particularly hoped for the former.\n\nMost thought they'd just been straightened out by the new regime, and sent on their way to reclaim the motherland - more specifically, on the front lines. Regardless, with one small act, no matter the ultimate reason, a few in Magadan started to - if cautiously - believe in their new, unorthodox ruler's benevolence."
 werbellsmuta.2.a: "What's the catch?"

 werbellsmuta.3.t: "Planespotting"
 werbellsmuta.3.desc: "Barnaby marveled at the airstrip in front of him; a museum filled from terminal to taxiway with almost every model of plane he could name. Of course, there was the Hawker Hurricane resting along a runway, one that he'd had had plenty of experience with it over the English channel. He could spot a Ju-87, too a short distance further, bringing back fond memories of his time over the Congo Basin in Zentralafrika.\n\n"Pretty Sweet, isn't it, Felipe"? Barnaby said to his friend.\n\n"For the last time, it's Federico!" Federico replied, with an exasperated sigh. "And no! This is awful. I can spot at least twenty models here. Twenty! I can barely repair your Hawker, let alone whatever this..." he gestured at a nearby bomber. "Whatever this Argentinian monstrosity is. How did we even get our hands on this?"\n\n"I'm sure it'll be fine, Fred," he patted the mechanic on the shoulder confidently. "I bet they all look the same on the inside."\n\n"No, they don't!" yelled Federico, "I don't know where the hell we're going to get parts to fix half of these! We're best to sell it all for scrap at this point!\n\nBarnaby smiled, unbothered by the display. "We'll work it out Fred. You always do."\n\n"You best hope I can," Federico muttered, opening his toolkit, and preparing to tackle the very large task in front of him. "Otherwise you're not making it fifty feet off the runway!" Barnaby smiled, and turned to leave his friend to his work - giving one final wave as he departed."
 werbellsmuta.3.a: ""Remember, we're on a deadline!""

 werbellsmuta.4.t: "Relics in the Snow"
 werbellsmuta.4.desc: ""Smaller than I expected, Isaiah. I was told that these Tigers were at least a kilometre wide and two tall! This is a moving cage." Arkady grinned at nobody in particular, pinching a cigarette between his teeth. He'd be better off selling his cigarettes than chomping them, but relief was a commodity that was in chronically short supply. Siberia was a land where keeping your sanity was a war all in itself.\n\n"You're an old man, but not senile." Isaiah's voice rang from underneath the tank. His pressed grey jumpsuit betrayed its age. Maybe he was proud of it, Arkady thought. Or maybe ironing was the only thing he had, apart from fixing and drinking whatever he could find. It did not matter. "This thing was a real terror back in its day. Not quite a wonder weapon though, eh? How do you think it ended up here? On the other side of the world?"\n\nArkady surveyed the rest of the junkyard. Dotted throughout the field, there were tanks of all shapes and sizes. Everything from T-34's to Lees to Matildas. Even some newer ones that he didn't recognise. If they weren't rusted, broken memoirs to a World aflame, it would have been beautiful, like a broken Roman statue in a museum. The wounds told a story of their own, even if it was one that the artist never wanted spoken. The Americans wanted Armour for their little venture to the West. They would get it.\n\n"I'm not quite sure what the Americans expect from this?" Arkady said. "Putting them together seems like a sure way to lose them, doesn't it? I still get paid for fixing them, so it doesn't matter to me. Only matters if I get hung by the Communists or - god forbid - those maniacs out past the Urals."\n\n"You aren't going to be the ones driving them, Isaiah. I am." Arkday spat out his cigarette and crushed the remains. Putting one hand in his coat pocket, he felt for his old friend. Bringing it out, he checked the magazine's content - never a bullet less than full - and slammed it back in. Maybe it was time that these old machines got back into service."
 werbellsmuta.4.a: ""I just hope you know what you're doing.""

      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_near_waters_exploitation: "Near Waters Exploitation"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_near_waters_exploitation_desc: "We'll dispatch operatives to establish a supply line with nearby areas, allowing for a steady stream of resources to be gathered and safely transferred to our §nMagadan Base§!."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_establish_combat_unit_fobs: "Establish Combat Unit FOBs"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_establish_combat_unit_fobs_desc: "By establishing a series of forward operating bases for our combat units, we'll be able to expand our mercenary operations across the globe."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_construct_base_development_fobs: "Construct Base Development FOBs"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_construct_base_development_fobs_desc: "By expanding our base development facilities beyond Magadan itself, we can bolster the local resource extraction economies. This will be a boon to both our military and civilian economic output."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_expand_and_darken_our_support_operations: "Expand & Darken Our Support Operations"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_expand_and_darken_our_support_operations_desc: "Failing to gain recognition from Washington, we'll keep operating in the dark. Working with the hand we've been dealt, we'll construct additional support bases within our zones of control to better sustain our operations. If the world denies us the revenues we were hoping to gain from legal trade, we're simply going to make up the shortfall by supplying the world with the goods that the powers-that-be is denying them. Free trade shall be absolute in the Pacific Ocean!"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_establish_the_free_port_of_magadan: "Establish the Free Port of Magadan"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_establish_the_free_port_of_magadan_desc: "With official support from Washington, we can move on to expand Magadan into a legitimate business port, a bastion of absolute free trade - the occasional formal regulation to keep up appearances aside, of course. After all, isn't every mercenary a businessman at heart when you get down to it? It'll also have the benefit of letting us conceal the operations of our §nMagadan Base§! behind the front of one of the world's finest import & export enterprises."

      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_construct_the_kamchatka_command_fob_desc: "§nMagadan Base§! has grown to the limits of its sustainable operations. A secondary command FOB is needed, one that will expand our reach deeper into the Pacific. We've determined that our best option at the moment is to establish a proper forward operating base off the coast of Kamchatka. Remote and with a good reach to the south and west by air and sea, it's ideal for our plans going forward."

      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_3_construct_intel_fobs_desc: "With our strategic position in Kamchatka, we will be able to operate spy operations and flights throughout the Pacific. With more intelligence assets at our disposal, the price we can ask for material that may interest any eventual clients is sure to rise as well."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_3_construct_support_fobs: "Construct Support FOBs"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_3_construct_support_fobs_desc: "With the ceiling reached for the scope of activities we can conduct without drawing too much heat to our §nMagadan Base§!, we'll expand our support operations in and around Kamchatka to improve our supply bottleneck."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_3_a_pacific_pirate_armada: "A Pacific Pirate Armada"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_3_a_pacific_pirate_armada_desc: "If you're going to do the time anyway, why not do the crime too? Since the world has decided to treat us like a bunch of criminals, we might as well turn it into a profit. The Pacific Ocean with its endless expanse is in itself the very essence of the freedom that the men and women in our ranks embody. Flying the black flag of liberty, our speedboats and planes will make sure that anything a man desires shall be within his reach for the right amount of cash. Naturally, thanks to our excellent intelligence services, we should be able to stay at a safe enough distance from CPS and OFN interests to anger someone with the firepower to fight back."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_3_the_magadan_merchant_fleet: "The Magadan Merchant Fleet"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_3_the_magadan_merchant_fleet_desc: "Magadan shall be known for having the finest trading fleet in the Pacific. Its convoys will carry goods to every corner of the world under a banner of the kind of liberty only America can provide. With enough freight ships to carry whatever legitimate goods the world craves and enough ice breakers to keep our operations going all year round, we'll be looking at some spectacular profits from this venture."

      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_3_establish_a_caribbean_command_center_and_hangar_desc: "Once Siberia and the Pacific have been made safe for us to operate within, it'll be time for us to expand beyond the Panama Canal and make our reach global. To do this, we'll purchase an offshore facility in the Caribbean well within international waters and turn this into our base of operations through the Atlantic and beyond. This will be the SBG's haven beyond Siberia, our Daughter Base. And with this foothold in the Atlantic, we'll be able to carry out our operations even better than before. We've turned this shot-in-the-dark coup against Matkovsky's fiefdom into something big."

    # Phase 4

      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_global_recruitment_drive: "Global Recruitment Drive"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_global_recruitment_drive_desc: "With the increased range provided to us by our Caribbean base, we are now in a position to expand our recruitment drive, giving us access to a pool of potential recruits from Europe and Africa. Previously separated from us by mountains and miles of land controlled by the CPS and EP, they're now a few hours by boat away from us."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_atlantic_combat_unit_fobs: "Atlantic Combat Unit FOBs"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_atlantic_combat_unit_fobs_desc: "While a huge undertaking, establishing forward operating bases for our mercenary forces deep into the Atlantic would open up countless opportunities for us by opening up previously hard-to-reach markets to us. Africa, the Middle East and even Europe yearns for professional soldiers of fortune to do their dirty work for them. True to our namesake, we will now be able to operate without any borders standing in our way."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_construct_ai_lab: "Construct AI Lab"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_construct_ai_lab_desc: "Proposed by freelance engineers that joined the ranks of the SBG, the AI lab will allow us to conduct research into more advanced military electronics and weapons system of hereto unimagined potential."

      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_construct_medical_fob_and_sick_bay_desc: "Building and maintaining a medical FOB with an attached sick bay will allow us to treat wounded or sick personnel and help soldiers recover from PTSD inflicted from serving with our Combat Units.

      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_the_crimson_corsairs_of_the_caribbean_desc: "Our operations in smuggling weapons, narcotics and other forms of contraband have so far been exceptionally profitable. Now that Africa, Europe, and the western seaboard of the Americas are within our reach, the obvious step is to expand our operations to these markets. As always, our intelligence services will prevent us from entering into conflicts with anyone big enough to put up a fight. That being said, some additional costs will be inevitable in these waters. As the saying goes, §Ythe tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the§! §Rblood§! §Wof§! §Bpatriots§!."
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_a_global_trade_empire: "A Global Trade Empire"
      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_4_a_global_trade_empire_desc: "From humble beginnings, our trade network in Magadan has grown into a trade empire with a truly global reach, we now embody the American virtues of free trade, free enterprise and free people. Flying the flag of freedom, freight ships under our control pass freely between the Pacific and into the Atlantic, carrying all products that any freedom-loving, God-fearing man might desire as long as their account balance can afford it. §RGod§! §Wbless§! §BAmerica!§!"
