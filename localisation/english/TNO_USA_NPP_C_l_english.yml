 USA_rfk_64_kennedy_presidency_desc:0 "Election Day has come and passed, and Robert F. Kennedy is now the 36th President of the United States.\n\nThe new heir to one of America's greatest families had blazed a cross-country campaign trail, promising to deliver equality for all Americans. To the worker, he promised better wages and better workplaces; to the old and infirm, he promised pensions for their hard work. To the sickly, he promised healthcare, robust and cheap; to the homeless, he promised homes of their own. To black Americans, he promised the rights they had been withheld for decades, that they can live freely and securely in the land of their birth. Though they had been subject to both doubt and ridicule -- from both his opponents and his own party -- the results speak for themselves.\n\nPresident Kennedy has his work cut out for him in the months ahead. Cracks are starting to show in the NPP's united front, and Republican-Democrats from county to state have already pledged to stonewall his legislation. But America's downtrodden now look to him for deliverance, as they once did to his brother. If Jack never quit even in his final seconds, then neither will Bobby."

Fear for the future runs rampant, yet distrust for those oathsworn to lead this nation through it grows with each scandal."\n\n"But must we give in to our lesser natures and believe that nothing can right America's path before the point of no return? I think not. America and her people are no strangers to crisis. The darkest of times are where character and strength shine brightest, and Americans had showcased great fortitude and unity in every war and depression that had assailed us for two hundred years. We had been dealt bloody many times in the past -- but we eventually recovered, and from each we emerged stronger than before."\n\n"My fellow Americans, I ask only one thing from you, and one thing only: to believe. Believe in the fortitude that resides in your hearts. Believe in the goodwill that guides our thoughts and actions. Believe that this great country will survive the present crisis, just as it had survived worse in the past. Believe that the present will pass, and together we will find our way back towards a future every American, no matter their race, class or creed, can look forward to...""

With Kennedy having to appease both the party and the voters, he walks a tight line of putting those he finds honorable and those he finds as just another career politician who jumped on the National Progressive Pact bandwagon. With multiple candidates vying for the top spot and only a few spots to go around, Kennedy must choose carefully."

 USA_rfk_64_moral_shadow_desc:0 "The United States of America is perhaps the greatest nation in modern history. Its footprint spans from the far shores of Australia to the icy mountains of Iceland. With the only challengers being the barbarous Japanese and the failing Germans, there is no doubt freedom will span the rest of the world in no time. Our fair nation faces a paradox, however. While we project Uncle Sam on every continent, Uncle Sam himself is sickly and weak. His fingers ache with arthritis and his stomach grumbles with the hunger of a nation subsiding on little but what he can beg for. As we throw our army and money and navy off to foreign lands to fight foreign foes, we let our own people starve and grovel for scraps. No matter how much it costs to the very bones and blood of our nation, we must close this great gaping fault in our great country, not just for America, but for the world."

 USA_rfk_64_across_the_aisle_desc:0 "The eternal chaos that is American politics has only been tempered by the fortunate election of the National Progressive Pact to power. It still stands built on a shaky foundation of corruption, partisanship, power-mongering, and war-profiteering. While Kennedy has been working to finally put the chaos to rest, he has decided that to do this he must work with the enemy. Temporarily, of course. Not permanent. RFK announced his new policy of cooperating with the Democratic Party, especially over their socially liberal policies as well as their progressive views on the welfare state. With the Democratic Party essentially being forced to take any opportunity they can, they've grabbed Kennedy's generous hand with eagerness. Now, with the NPP and the Democrats working hand-in-hand, we can finally put the death-throes of old American politics to rest."
 USA_rfk_64_go_it_alone:0 "The Pact Above All"
 USA_rfk_64_go_it_alone_desc:0 "Political pundits lampoon the NPP voter as a schizophreniac: Mercurial, erratic, quick to shift opinion in between gulps of breath. A disingenuous portrayal of the party at large, of course... but to brush their words off without a second thought is to ignore the problems that had plagued the NPP since its inception.\n\nContradictions over platform and policy are inherent in any big tent party with presidential ambitions; befitting its unprecedented scale, the National Progressive Pact runs the whole gamut of America's broad political spectrum. Conversely, establishing pact-wide consensus and a united front against the Republican-Democrat opposition will be difficult due to the wide variety of ideologies it tolerates. Only hatred of both the Rising Sun and the old establishment binds the party together. In any other scenario, it would not have existed.\n\nPresident Kennedy has decided to prioritize forming the consensus his party and his agenda desperately needs. Getting Wallace and Chavez to sit at the same table will be an exercise in herding cats -- but by hook or by crook, the NPP will stand together, lose together, and win together for his term and beyond."

 USA_rfk_64_rally_progressives_desc:0 "They may be few, but men and women of good principle still remain within the whitegold edifices of Washington D.C. These advocates of change come from many backgrounds and classes and caucus for different parties, but all believe that the United States is in dire need of political, social, and economic reform. For the Progressive movement, no other option guarantees America's survival for both the near and far future.\n\nCurrently, America's progressives rally under two factions: President Kennedy's own Progressive Caucus, and Senator Lyndon Johnson's Democrats. Both extremes of the NPP will raise objections over cooperating with the RDC, and Senator Johnson is infamous for both his temperament and his... peculiarities. Nevertheless, bipartisanship accords legitimacy to legislation in the eyes of the American people. A show of unity with our natural allies across the aisle can smoothen the passage of progressive policies for less backlash and compromise."

 USA_rfk_64_necessary_sacrifice_desc:0 "None have contributed more to the black Americans' suffering than the Dixiecrats of old and new. This geriatric band of white good ol' boys hold an iron grip on the reins of power throughout the South, eager to defend Jim Crow under the flimsy pretense of "states' rights". If one wonders why supposedly free men continue to live like slaves in Alabama, Louisiana, and a dozen other states, look no further.\n\nUnfortunately, such cretins also comprise a sizable portion of the NPP. Since having split from the Democrats, Wallace and his cronies rail against the slightest push for civil rights from our corner of Congress. His word carries far beyond our party, across party lines and to millions of like-minded Americans.\n\nDespite his misgivings, President Kennedy has decided to parlay with the Nationalists in a series of publicized meetings. No doubt they will demand concessions in exchange for support -- but we do not have the luxury of choice. Either the Civil Rights Act passes, albeit heavily reduced... or it does not pass at all."
 USA_rfk_64_majority_by_any_means:0 "Keep a Majority by Any Means"
 USA_rfk_64_majority_by_any_means_desc:0 "While committed, the Progressive Caucus is only one of three factions bound together by a shaky coalition. Our moderate inclinations toward reform does not endear us to both Left and Right, to say nothing of the Republican-Democrats who hold a dim view on any reform at all. This position is terrible for passing bills favorable to any President's agenda; after all, our supposed allies can and will abandon us should they deem it convenient.\n\nFor President Kennedy, the solution is obvious: compromise. The Progressive Caucus must actively take steps to reach every corner of every aisle and come to an understanding with as many Senators and Congressmen as possible. Genuine dialogue with party leaders will help convince doubters of our well-meaning intentions, making them more willing to vote alongside us in Congress. Acquiring the majority necessary to enact reform is a prerequisite to success for the next four years, and no petty accusations of "selling out" from his base will convince the President otherwise."

The younger Kennedy has struggled with his grief for a long time and has often even blamed himself for his elder brother's demise. Now that he is in power, he has decided that the best thing he can do is to honor John's legacy by embodying everything that he stood for: dignity, equality, and emboldening the spirit of America."

 USA_rfk_64_malice_towards_none_desc:0 "Our nation has always been a melting pot for a multitude of peoples of all colors and creeds, and yet the idea of America as a nation for whites alone persists. It was the peoples' desire to put an end to this tired old sentiment that swept Robert Kennedy into power. If we are to move forward as one country, we must remove the legal obstacles to the full integration of all races and a guarantee that all might be afforded the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We are likely to face stiff opposition from southern conservatives and even from within the Nationalist ranks of our own party, but we must push on in the name of a fairer and more equal America."
 USA_rfk_64_foot_in_door:0 "Put the Foot in the Door"
 USA_rfk_64_foot_in_door_desc:0 "Many within the Progressive Caucus consider the Democrats to be our natural allies in the fight for civil rights, separated from us only by party lines drawn up in the chaos that followed the Second World War. Indeed, they had voiced their support for the last such Act in the past, and their frustrations when Nixon vetoed it. Should we inevitably propose another, they may well prove to be better allies than our own pact's Nationalists.\n\nNegotiating with Senator Johnson is crucial for guaranteeing the Act's passage. Success means a stable coalition that will advance and safeguard the civil rights of all Americans for the rest of President Kennedy's term -- for that alone, compromise is worth the backlash the administration may receive from within the NPP."
 USA_rfk_64_door_in_face:0 "Slam the Door in Their Faces"
 USA_rfk_64_door_in_face_desc:0 "The NPP cannot pass a Civil Rights Act at its current state, and the White House knows it. In fact, our opponents are hedging their bets precisely on our awareness as we speak, hoping that the President's indecision feeds into a perception of weakness; for now, such is confined to the fringes of popular opinion.\n\nRather than let it spread any further, our policy planners have crafted a daring proposal: to release a draft of the Civil Rights Act so extensive as to draw the outrage and ire of everyone but the most progressive Americans. The Administration can scale it back to a more palatable state afterwards, and in doing so cultivate an image of compromise and level-headedness for the President himself.\n\nIt is a highly risky proposition, least of all for the President's ratings, but one that also presents high rewards: should the gambit work, then Congress will have unwittingly agreed to the version of the Act we want."

 USA_rfk_64_most_pressing_issue_desc:0 "Segregation in the United States has become by far the single most contentious issue of our times, dwarfing the impact of even our foreign affairs. Neighbor spits on neighbor for the color of his skin. Activists clash in the streets, fighting for the future or the past. The senate floor is dominated with endless debates and inter-party conflict and even intra-party conflict. While this goes on, America cannot call itself a united country, and the chaos will only continue to build if nothing is done. It falls to our administration to resolve this generational debate once and for all."

 USA_rfk_64_firmness_in_right_desc:0 "In spite of the rhetoric and barbed politesse, we and the Democrats share common values and ambitions towards America's ultimate betterment. It is, perhaps, only on relatively minor issues where we diverge in opinion and approach, though these differences are not so stark as to preclude hesitant tendrils of cooperation on both sides of the aisle.\n\nPresident Kennedy believes that reaching out to them with concessions to said issues will better incline them to work with the NPP in areas where bipartisanship has truly taken root, most notably in civil rights. Only together can we bring America back to good feeling, after all, and togetherness only begins when everyone has reason to join together at all."

They are still often racist, prejudiced and selfish. This is, sadly, an obstacle to the social justice our nation needs. The Civil Rights Bill that would liberate the many oppressed has come up against stiff opposition from constituents and lawmakers alike. The south is plagued with symbols of a past conflict, and the north indifferent. The bill will not get passed in its current state, but compromise is unpalatable. What will be done?"
 USA_rfk_64_hand_in_hand:0 "Hand in Hand"
 USA_rfk_64_hand_in_hand_desc:0 "Despite their stark differences, President Kennedy and Senator Johnson have had frequent and productive meetings in the Oval Office as of late, where they discuss the finer points of the work-in-progress Act. These meetings often last from morning to midnight, involving copious amounts of pens, paper, cigarettes, and hard liquor. Whatever words were exchanged between the two (and reports abound from anonymous staffers of particularly coarse language being liberally employed), they both leave having taken two more steps towards the Act's final version.\n\nSuch displays of inter-party cooperation, for the lack of a better word, has since motivated other NPP and Democrat Congressmen, especially those who both belong in committees, to work together for the cause which they both wish to advance. Hand in hand, none can stop us from together delivering the American people the rights which they truly deserve."

 USA_rfk_64_one_last_push_desc:0 "With every line typewritten into a clean sheet of paper, every debate settled amicably, every item brought to consensus, the NPP inches ever closer towards its ultimate goal. Slowly, the final version of the Civil Rights Act takes shape -- months of sore throats and fatigue had given birth to this one end-product. The American people eagerly await the day it is put to a vote, now a definite date rather than an estimation that shifts with the wind. Needless to say, so are we.\n\nAll that remains is to sort out minor minutiae -- utterly trivial in comparison to the hurdles we have long traversed. With one last burst of speed, one last push, we can finally type the last dot and begin the countdown towards role call."

They have not offered the slightest bit of compromise in the issue of civil rights, instead content with wailing and screaming about their sacrosanct "states' rights" whenever approached. To outsiders, they are a putrid stain on the NPP; to our supporters, they are a testament to the NPP's duplicity and hypocrisy; and to the NPP itself, they are a metastasizing cancer willing to throw away party unity for selfish gain.\n\nOwing to our weak position in Congress, we once had no choice but to seek their support in order to buttress the NPP's votes. Times have changed, however, and we are now in a position to make do without theirs; for President Kennedy, now is the best time to boot these upjumped rattlesnakes and alligators out of the party he leads."

 USA_rfk_64_work_with_cr_leaders_desc:0 "The repudiation of Wallace was accompanied by a sudden influx of support from America's civil rights community. This cause-and-effect relationship is easy to explain; after all, they had suffered more than most from the Jim Crow Laws our now-diminished Nationalist Caucus have enthusiastically advocated. Siding with our erstwhile coalition meant siding with those who had made them and their forebears' lives slavery long after it was abolished.\n\nAn opportunity to work closer with these advocates for freedom has presented itself in front of us. Having done away with the party's garbage, President Kennedy can now formally reach out to the black men and women at the forefront of the civil rights movement. Coopting their strength will be a boon like none other for the NPP, and nothing breaks the ice better than bonding over the woes of a shared enemy."
 USA_rfk_64_malcom_x:0 "Talk with Malcolm X"
 USA_rfk_64_malcom_x_desc:0 "Malcolm X is the most vociferous and aggressive, definitely the most controversial, civil rights advocate in the modern American political landscape. Leader of the Nation of Islam, he pontificates passionately against the injustices meted to the black man by his old slavemaster across the South. Yet the solution he proffers for America's racial divide mirror that of the white man he so loathes -- not to heal it, but to widen and deepen it, this time on the black man's own initiative. His words are appalling and offensive to the sensibilities of many; nevertheless, hatred runs deep and far for the many thousands who take them to heart.\n\nOrganizing a meeting with such a radical figure will doubtless cause backlash among the more integration-minded of our country and party. Hope remains that an impasse may be reached, however, and President Kennedy has worked with far less than hope before."
 USA_rfk_64_consult_mlk:0 "Consult with King"
 USA_rfk_64_consult_mlk_desc:0 "Contrasting Malcolm X's firebrand rhetoric of black supremacy are Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s sermons of peace and friendship for our fellow man. He preaches straight into the heart of millions every Sunday Mass, with a smooth baritone that soothes and inflames the soul in equal measure, clamoring for the average Joe to seek their conscience, join hands, and march forward together towards a future shared by Americans of all races and faiths. Truly, one cannot ask for a better spokesperson for the civil rights movement than the good Reverend and the word of God.\n\nConnecting with a community requires learning its mores and customs, so that no issues will arise from interacting with them. No one knows a flock of sheep better than their own shepherd, and Dr. King may be more ecstatic than most in helping the President help his own."

Those fortunate enough to have lived carefreely may learn their experiences, but theirs will be a clinical sort of knowledge: detached, unfeeling, passive. Crimson ichor spilled on soil by a cruel, centuries-old injustice become little more than words of black ink printed on plain paper -- words and pictures simply to learn from, but not to act upon. Progress may be made with the help of the fortunate and careless; defending progress in spite of convenience, on the other hand, requires those with spirit tempered only by experience.\n\nEverywhere one looks in this country will they find no shortage of such men and women. They belong to all walks of life, all sorts of occupation, bearing scars from lashes both tangible and invisible. Now that we have made inroads into their communities through their leaders, the time has come to accept them into our fold."

The Civil Rights Act heralds the greatest flowering of American political freedoms since the Bill of Rights, searing into the country's book of law the rights withheld to select citizens in many of its states. Millions of Americans will see their fortunes improve at last, breathe true freedom at last, witness jubilo at last, should this Act pass the baptisms of Congress.\n\nThe fate of millions now hangs in the balance, as do the sacrifices we have made to reach this point. Pray that our lawmakers will listen to their conscience and make the right choice."

A house is their symbol, and with it they declare to the world that they are freemen, beholden to none but their government. Strip an American of his house, and he becomes little more than a slave. What does it say of today's America, then, that most of its citizens do not have the money to buy a house of their own?\n\nThe Progressive Caucus has long been aware of this problem, and have drafted a bill designed to encourage the construction of affordable housing projects in America's booming cities.

A handshake takes its place among the most important in American culture: by firmly clasping the hand of another, then shaking it firmly, both establish either's status as the other's peer. With a simple handshake, a man announces to another his good intentions, his respect for their dignity, and his belief in their equal standing -- which, perhaps, explains why our captains of industry never seem to shake hands with the workers they employ.\n\nReaching out to this country's twice-bitten requires actively establishing good faith in our part. If we aim to bridge the crevasses of American society, then the government must take the first few steps towards building the paths to cross them.

The government's answer, at long last... but only after, not before, the inevitable massacre. The worker's memory is long and their history ugly, as blood red as the flags they wave.\n\nReaching out to this country's many scorned requires acknowledgement from those who had ignored it -- and we, their government, are to them the worst kind of ignorant.

In this they are aided by a school system which, thanks to segregation, impresses upon children from the outset that those of a different color than they do do not belong to the community in which they belong.\n\nTo President Kennedy, the next milestone for a newer, better, and more just American society is the thorough redrawing of America's school districts. It is a task that will take generations, but integrated schools will ensure that the bonds between black American and white American, once severed by a growing chasm, will eventually heal.

The National Ethics Commission's mission bears a simplicity that masks its significance: to ensure that the government enforces the law to both its letter and spirit.

Poor farmers in both his home state and across the country utter his name in the same breath as the Lord God, thanking him for the protection his United Farm Workers bestowed upon them and tens of thousands of others.\n\nThe Administration cannot negotiate in good faith with American labor without approaching the representatives it acknowledges -- for much of it, Señor Chavez is nothing less than a blessed idol. An earnest chat with the proverbial shepherd of America's farmers will assure them that we are committed to uplifting them from their demeaning, humiliating stature and treating them as the fundamental pillars of society that they are."

For those America's police had sworn to serve and protect, however, their motto rings hollow. In many infamous incidents, they had neither served nor protected the American people -- instead, they served those with the money to acquire their services, and protected the assets which they deeply prize.\n\nSecuring the backing of the American worker entails ensuring their safety from their own law enforcement, that they may not tread upon their rights like they had in the past.

For some, this country fulfilled their end of the bargain, and so they and theirs lived happily thereafter.\n\nSadly, this was not a common occurrence. A great many others lived lives no different from what they had left behind: miserable, pathetic, pauperous. Too many suffered the same withering glares they longed to escape, whether for their race, faith or sex. Too many died with only a gravestone to their name. To our great shame, this "land of opportunity" favored a select few and left the rest to wail and gnash teeth.\n\nPresident Kennedy aspires to bring America closer to what it had promised, legislation by legislation.

Years prior, even some within the party would balk at the costs involved for such a program, let alone the wisdom of granting free and unrestricted healthcare paid for by the federal government. But the administration persisted, slowly winning hearts and votes, until the National Healthcare Act finally stands before Congress, ready to be judged for its worth.

 ###### BIPARTISANSHIP EVENTS


 bobby.bipartisan.1.t:0 "The Beginning of a Beautiful Friendship"
 bobby.bipartisan.1.desc:0 "America is divided more than ever, on seemingly every issue-- economic policy, military interventions, civil rights, and just about whatever else you can fit on the nightly news. Now more than ever, however, we must bring Americans together, and create a more free, equal America.\n\nThat said, a "free, equal America" requires a lot of work to turn from fantasy to fact. The first step is securing bipartisan support in Congress, and our best bet is some kind of coalition with the more liberal Democrats. Let's show the Democrats that our values are quite similar by working on a War Powers Act together, which would limit the President's power to unilaterally plunge America into war, like what became the norm recently.\n\nIf they learn to like working with us on this, support for a future Civil Rights Act would be almost guaranteed!"
 bobby.bipartisan.1.a:0 "We must keep the prize in sight."

 bobby.bipartisan.2.t:0 "The First Draft"
 bobby.bipartisan.2.desc:0 "Congress, and really all of politics, is a tricky game: How far do you push your morals in favor of pragmatism, what's a vote really worth, and more.\n\nWith this bill, we're faced with a certain decision we must make as we draft the WPA. Do we make the Act as clear and direct and possible, or do we leave a few loopholes here and there? Making an airtight bill would certainly be the more moral choice and perhaps be the most popular, but if we leave even a few loopholes we could satisfy some of the warhawks in Congress."
 bobby.bipartisan.2.a:0 "Sometimes we have to focus more on what's realistic rather than what's right."
 bobby.bipartisan.2.b:0 "We came here to prevent another South Africa. Close the loopholes."

 bobby.bipartisan.3.t:0 "The Democratic Ambush"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.desc:0 "Some of the Democrats in Congress have sprung an amendment onto the War Powers Act! They want to let the President send "training forces" without needing Congressional approval. If we let this amendment through, the whole Act becomes meaningless, since the President could still just send whatever forces he wanted under the guise of his "training forces"!\n\nAt the same time however, if we did let this amendment through, we could count on a much larger base of support in Congress.\n\nWhat should we do about this?"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.a:0 "The hell are they doing, absolutely not!"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.b:0 "Well, it couldn't hurt to have a bigger majority."

 bobby.bipartisan.4.t:0 "The Democrats Speak Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.4.desc:0 "After our refusal to incorporate their amendment, the Democrats have raised a major stink nationwide, and the latest numbers seem to suggest it has affected our polling.\nHowever, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Although the Democrats are throwing their little tantrums, the Democrats are publicly applauding us for sticking to our guns, and LBJ even called to say congratulations! Who knew such a dreadful man had a heart!"
 bobby.bipartisan.4.a:0 "The Democrats are all that matter."

 bobby.bipartisan.5.t:0 "The End of the Honeymoon"
 bobby.bipartisan.5.desc:0 "Some diehard dove Democrats have raised hell over our decision to incorporate the Democrats' amendment in the War Powers Act. For now, these Democrats are mostly on the fringe, but it could spell disaster down the line. We can't go back on the promise to go for the Democrats' amendment, but we do have to make sure that we don't rock the boat too much in the future so our coalition stays secure. We need to make sure the Democrats can and do trust us!"
 bobby.bipartisan.5.a:0 "So much for reaching across the aisle..."
 bobby.bipartisan.5.b:0 "Well, it couldn't hurt to have a bigger majority..."

 bobby.bipartisan.6.t:0 "The Passing of the War Powers Act"
 bobby.bipartisan.6.desc:0 "With the recent Senate vote, the War Powers Act is on its way to Robert's desk, which means a victory for us and our coalition. Hypothetically, this should mean that we've achieved a great success for bipartisanship in America, but it just seems like we've dug the party trenches even deeper. We set out not only to prevent another South Africa, but to show America how to work together again, and while we got the job done in the end, the cracks we got along the way are worrying.\n\nStill, what's done is done, and we must look towards the future and not the past. There will likely be another opportunity to showcase bipartisanism soon, and to guarantee the Democrats that we're the people to work with when it comes to civil rights."
 bobby.bipartisan.6.a:0 "A win is a win, onto the next bill."

 bobby.bipartisan.7.t:0 "Grumbles in the Nationalists"
 bobby.bipartisan.7.desc:0 "Some Nationalist members of the NPP are complaining that we give the executive branch too much power in the War Powers Act-- they fear that we'll do the same when it comes to civil rights, which they view as undue government tyranny.\n\nThis is, of course, absurd, but we could count on more complete Congressional support if we alter the language of the Act somewhat, even if we might scare off a few Democrats."
 bobby.bipartisan.7.a:0 "Well, a little alteration couldn't hurt."
 bobby.bipartisan.7.b:0 "We can't go back now, send the bill to the floor."

 bobby.bipartisan.8.t:0 "The Elephant Blows Its Trunk"
 bobby.bipartisan.8.desc:0 "After altering the language of the War Powers Act to please the Nationalists, the Democrats are worried we'll just bend over to the Nationalists when it comes to civil rights! They're concerned we won't stick to our guns and get a square deal for all Americans, with LBJ himself trumpeting this line from every talk show in the nation. Unfortunately, it's too late to back out of the alterations, but hopefully the Act will still make it out of Congress with the new Nationalist support. This does not bode well for our future cooperation."
 bobby.bipartisan.8.a:0 "Why does bipartisanship have to be so hard?"

 bobby.bipartisan.9.t:0 "The Right Speaks Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.9.desc:0 "Our recent refusal to tone down the War Powers Act in accordance with the Nationalists demand to alter the language of the Act has earned us some respect with anti-segregationists and civil rights leaders, but it has also led to Strom Thurmond and George Wallace decrying our so called "undignified, callous, and immature conduct." Thankfully, this hasn't led to any serious implications, and what limited impact it has led to will most likely fade with time. We have even had some of our Democratic colleagues speak out to the press in support of our Administration after refusing to let them in."
 bobby.bipartisan.9.a:0 "Why does bipartisanship have to be so damn hard?"

 bobby.bipartisan.10.t:0 "Drafting the Environmental Protections Act"
 bobby.bipartisan.10.desc:0 "America has always been a land of progress, with each new era bringing new innovations and opportunities through the wonders of science and industry. But progress comes with a cost. The ravages of unchecked development has waged devastation upon the great beauty of nature, and the skies choke with smog just as the land lies awash with waste. Something must be done to ensure that we do not squander the bounty of our great country.\nOur newest bill would introduce a slew of environmental protections and regulations aimed at reducing the impact of human development on the natural world. Businesses and government institutions would be encouraged to monitor and reduce their reliance on polluting chemicals, inefficient practices and irresponsible waste disposal, among other such ills. Certain incentives to help encourage the adoption of green policies are also included in the bill, including increased taxation on pollutive products and subsidies for organizations that adopt environmentally-friendly initiatives.\nBefore we submit this bill, we must figure out our strategy. Our cooperation with the Republican-Democrats has presented an opportunity we may be able to exploit in this matter. A number of Democrat senators have expressed a great passion for the cause of environmental protection, and if we were to offer them a seat at the table to help draft the bill, we could shore up their support for when it comes time to vote. On the other hand, their passion may prove rather... counterproductive, as they will certainly request that we include even stronger protections that may not prove as palatable to the rest of the government.\nThe decision lies with President Kennedy, who is willing to pursue any avenue in the interests of defending America's natural beauty."
 bobby.bipartisan.10.a:0 "Invite the Democrats to the table!"
 bobby.bipartisan.10.b:0 "In times like this, it's best to be safe."

 bobby.bipartisan.11.t:0 "A Firmer Hand on the Environment"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.desc:0 "The Democrats have been eager to work with us in developing the Environmental Act, and lengthy discussions about the bill's contents have taken place over the last few days. As expected, however, our decision to include them may come at a cost.\nWhile they have welcomed the protections offered by the bill, the Democrats say they do not go far enough, for they claim that sufficiently wealthy and powerful organizations would freely be able to ignore the regulations if the profit remained sufficient. Rather than a carrot, we need a stick, they say. Among their proposed amendments include rendering certain particularly ecologically-damaging practices illegal, with significant fines and sanctions for those companies who continue to engage in them. In addition, they also seek the creation of a government watchdog that would be able to investigate organizations that flaunted environmental law and enforce fines on those they find in violation of the regulations.\nThough these suggestions would certainly make a difference for the environment, there are many who would balk at such an interventionist approach. Passing the bill with their amendments attached may prove even more difficult than if we had just tried to do it alone, and it may be better to quit while we're ahead and cut the Democrats back out of the discussions. Opening the door only to slam it back in their faces, however, might not be the best look for us."
 bobby.bipartisan.11.b:0 "It will be tough, but they're right. Make it stronger!"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.a:0 "Surely there is a middle ground here?"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.c:0 "This was a bad idea, reject the amendments."


 bobby.bipartisan.12.t:0 "An Avalanche of Calls"
 bobby.bipartisan.12.desc:0 "When President Kennedy opened the morning paper to find the draft of the Environmental Act staring back at him from page 3, he had cursed under his breath. Some careless staffer must have left a copy lying around for any old gumshoe journalist to find, and now the full draft of the bill was available for all to see. Already there was some consternation in the papers about the Democrats' amendments, and President Kennedy groaned at the knowledge that he had no doubt drawn the ire of some very powerful people.\nAt half past nine, the first phone call arrived, and they would seemingly never cease until well into the evening. Many different people could be heard on the other end, but they could have essentially been considered the same - all a bunch of lobbyists. Lobbyists for Mobil, Pacific Gas & Electric, Chevron, all manner of names that held so much clout in places that they really shouldn't. The calls were generally brief, but equally terse and all with the same message. 'Stop it.'\nThe demands of the lobbyists were simple. Dilute the terms of the bill and cease trying to cut into their profits. If the government refused, they vowed to use whatever resources were at their disposal to drown the NPP in bad press and flood the heartlands of the oil and energy industries with ads attacking the party. Heartlands like the Southwest and the Midwest, where the companies were essentially institutions in their own right who the working man looked to to provide his daily bread. Certainly, not men who would take kindly to their great corporate benefactors not being able to create as many jobs due to government meddling.\nBy sundown President Kennedy was no longer hiding his cursing. He knew he was in a bind, and was faced with a choice. If he continued down this path, he'd almost certainly lose some of the Midwestern states and quite possibly the next election. But was the defence of the natural world and the great green Earth that he and three billion people shared not more important than votes?\nWith one final expletive, he picked up the now silent phone and called the bill drafting committee, ready at last to inform them of his decision."
 bobby.bipartisan.12.a:0 "We have no choice. Tone down the bill."
 bobby.bipartisan.12.b:0 "Lobbyists be damned, this is for the future."


 bobby.bipartisan.13.t:0 "An Offer from the Nationalists"
 bobby.bipartisan.13.desc:0 "As heated discussion over the strengthened Environmental Act continues, one might have expected the Nationalist sister faction to the Progressive NPP to be the angriest voice of them all. Yet discussions between the two broken halves have proven oddly civil. The Nationalists are aware of President Kennedy's intentions and passes no ill judgement on his commitment to the environment. In fact, the most recent talks saw senior Nationalist leaders offer up the possibility of them supporting the bill through both branches of government. In return for concessions, of course.\nThe heartlands of the Right's voter base rely on industries that utilize un-green practices, and while tackling the pollution of the land we live in may be a moral imperative, it should not come at the cost of the average working man who put their faith in our party. So say the Nationalist, the clear solution is to press the regulations on a national scale, but allow certain exemptions at the state level so that more traditional industries can keep their overhead manageable. This, along with some other business-friendly amendments, would take the harsh bite out of the bill in the eyes of many businesses and business interests.\nWe need support to get our radical plan through, and perhaps allowing a few dissenters to cut themselves loose of the regulations is acceptable if most of the nation will still follow them. But it does leave a sour taste in the mouth..."
 bobby.bipartisan.13.a:0 "Let them have their exemptions."
 bobby.bipartisan.13.b:0 "Are you mad? Laws isn't optional!"


 bobby.bipartisan.14.t:0 "Johnson's Ire"
 bobby.bipartisan.14.desc:0 ""And so you would bring our brethren to your table with promises to hear them, to fulfil the promise our parties made to each other to put the cause of America before our own differences, and then at the first sign of making real progress you turn them away because it is not convenient? For shame, Mr President."\nLyndon B. Johnson's words today echo the frustrations heard within both factions of his party. Having brought the Democrats to the table, only to turn them away immediately upon the realization that their desires may be bad for the NPP, has been regarded as an insult and a betrayal not just to the Democrats, but to their Republican allies as well. Having previously agreed to cooperate with the RDC on matters such as these, so readily cutting them off may not have been the most stellar optics for us.\nJohnson and his allies in the halls of power have banded together in an alliance that threatens to tear apart the agreement between our two parties. They are demanding that we reopen negotiations and take the Democrats' views on board before they consider voting for the bill along with further input from the Republicans, and they are making it very clear that they will make things very, very difficult for us if we refuse.\nOur image in the eyes of the RDC does not look good right now, and yet if we acquiesce and are seen so willingly bowing before the demands of the opposition, the loss of voter confidence in us could be very damaging indeed. Today is a stressful day for President Kennedy."
 bobby.bipartisan.14.a:0 "Damn it all! Just give them what they want."
 bobby.bipartisan.14.b:0 "No means no, this is OUR bill too."


 bobby.bipartisan.15.t:0 "The Environmental Act Passes!"
 bobby.bipartisan.15.desc:0 "After all the haggling, debating and careful politicking of the last few months, our environmental bill has finally passed through the halls of power and emerged as law! With the only formality remaining being the signing of the bill into law by President Kennedy's own hand, a new dawn awaits this fair land of America. No more will selfish corporations be permitted to blindly squander the natural beauty of our country in the name of a quick profit, nor will the government itself turn a blind eye to the abuses against fair Mother Nature.\nNot only is this a great day for our natural splendour, but also a great day for everyone in the halls of power. Our close cooperation with the Republican-Democrats in getting this bill through proves just how much the government can achieve when it stops bickering amongst itself and instead finds common ground. Many with the RDC's ranks (and, perhaps more pertinently, within their electorate) have come to look upon us with ambivalence, if not outright favor, where before would have only been hostility.\nIn the future, we may well be able to count on their votes to back up our own. A few quiet polls and queries amongst Capitol Hill representatives has revealed that polls across the country have shifted as well."
 bobby.bipartisan.15.a:0 "Let's hope we've earned some favors..."


 bobby.bipartisan.16.t:0 "The Nationalist Caucus Requests Amendments"
 bobby.bipartisan.16.desc:0 "The first draft of the Environmental Act has arrived in Congress, and debate is already well underway. While it has been well received amongst certain Progressives and Republican-Democrats, others are less enthused. Some have called the bill "anti-business" and an attack on the values of the American free market, claiming that the extra costs it would cause to businesses would only lead to less jobs and a worse economy. The bill has spent the last few days under intense scrutiny from the subcommittees, and we remain far from a consensus.\nPrivately, representatives of our party's Nationalist faction have met with President Kennedy to discuss certain... adjustments to the bill that could potentially make it more palatable to them and their voters. These adjustments include granting exemptions from our proposed regulations to certain key businesses - primarily in NPP voting areas - while still "gently encouraging" more efficient practices overall. Not only would this quiet the criticisms of the more pro-business voices in Congress and help move the bill along, it would also shore up support for us amongst white collar voters who wish to see their companies prosper.\nOf course, taking the teeth out of the bill would render our whole endeavour somewhat pointless. Nonetheless, our ability to pass the bill as things stand is uncertain, and is a weak bill that passes not better than a strong bill that fails?"
 bobby.bipartisan.16.a:0 "What use is a law if nobody follows it?!"
 bobby.bipartisan.16.b:0 "They have a point. A few exemptions can't hurt."


 bobby.bipartisan.17.t:0 "The Democrats Lash Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.17.desc:0 ""A good bill, a great and necessary bill, made weak and toothless just to bow to the wishes of big business!"\nThis was the assessment of one Democratic congressman today following our adjustment of the Environmental Act, and his words have been echoed by many other progressive Democrats on the floor. Safe to say, they are not happy with us acquiescing to the Nationalists' suggestions, and indeed many who formerly supported the bill now seem determined to vote against it in indignation.\nSome of the Democrats have demanded that we restore the original draft of the bill to be debated. While we have clearly lost a lot of support, going back now would perhaps place us in a worse position than to begin with, for not only will we have rankled the Democrats, but we will also have reneged on our word to our Nationalist colleagues. Still, perhaps their passion shows that the bill as it once stood had more of a chance than we thought."
 bobby.bipartisan.17.a:0 "God damn them, let's just dig up the original draft."
 bobby.bipartisan.17.b:0 "We can't keep switching it up! The bill stays."

 bobby.bipartisan.18.t:0 "The Fruits of Cooperation"
 bobby.bipartisan.18.desc:0 "Our bipartisan efforts to secure support across the aisle have earned us praise, and the senate whips have been dispatched to count up the votes. Let us hope that the Democrats come through."
 bobby.bipartisan.18.a:0 "The real prize awaits..."



###### CRA EVENTS


 bobby.cra.1.t:0 "The Door Stands Ajar"
 bobby.cra.1.desc:0 "The time has finally come to discuss civil rights on a national level. Our new Civil Rights Act is not as comprehensive as it could be, yes, but it has almost guaranteed support from the more liberal Democrats, which more radical legislation might not have. Plus, we most likely can count on support from moderate Democrats if we treat them with a certain level of respect. When it comes to civil rights, we most certainly need every iota of support we can muster.\n\nWith this bill, we stand ready to help America live up to the dream of a free nation where all are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness! The only real roadblock is all of the so-called brilliant minds and wonderfully colorful personalities of Congress, especially from the "patriots" of the Nationalists.\n\nWe owe it to Americans of all races, colors, and creeds to do our damned hardest to get this Act passed, and to create a nation where we can really finally say that everyone is created equal. We've certainly got our work cut out for us, but it's worthwhile work indeed."
 bobby.cra.1.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

 bobby.cra.2.t:0 "Slamming the Door"
 bobby.cra.2.desc:0 "We are done making compromises and half-promises. We are done living in a nation run by the few, working against the many. We are done putting up with racist, Anti-American behavior. We are done accepting token excuses for lynchings and burnings. We are opening a new chapter of American history with this Civil Rights Act; the Act secures freedom and equality for every single American, no ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nWhile any moral, rational person could see this bill is the right thing to do, we have to deal with Congress here, so morality and rationality are essentially off the table. In fact, we've already gotten massive pushback from the Nationalists. They're moaning about the usual- federal tyranny this, states' rights that. Absurd arguments of course, but we are going to have to find a way to counteract them. The Democrats have also begun to mumble about the perceived radicality of the Act, but we should be able to court some liberal (and perhaps moderate) Democrat support if we play our cards right.\n\nIn any case, we have a long and difficult road ahead of us, but at the end of this road is a society better than the Founding Fathers could have even imagined all those years ago."
 bobby.cra.2.a:0 "Time to go to work."

 bobby.cra.3.t:0 "Into the Jaws of Democracy"
 bobby.cra.3.desc:0 "It's been long and grueling work to get to this point, but we can finally say with no small amount of pride that the Civil Rights Act has officially reached the Senate. It's a small victory, and we still have miles of the winding halls of bureaucracy to guide our bill through, but it is a victory nonetheless.\n\nNo time to celebrate however, because our bill in now firmly in the gaping maw of American democatic republicanism. In order to debut on the Senate floor, the bill must pass the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is currently headed by one James Oliver Eastland, a bonafide, card-carrying, rabid segregationist. Under normal circumstances, we might just let him have his way and delay the bill in perpetuity so we don't rock the boat too much. However, these are not normal circumstances.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act must be made into law if these United States are to continue to call themselves the defenders of freedom, equality, and true democracy in the dark fever dream of this world. As such, it is necessary that we get this bill past Eastland and onto the Senate floor. What option should we pursue?"
 bobby.cra.3.a:0 "Give LBJ a call..."
 bobby.cra.3.b:0 "Eastland can not be avoided... Send it to committee."

 bobby.cra.4.t:0 "The Phone Call"
 bobby.cra.4.desc:0 "Lyndon Bains Johnson. LBJ. Landslide Lyndon. Jumbo, in some circles. Love him or hate him, he just might be the most effective Senate whip in American history. He runs the damn Senate like his personal kingdom, and it might as well be. When LBJ dies, that man will just give Saint Peter "the Johnson Treatment" until they let him in. He might not be able to sell snow to an eskimo, but goddamn if that eskimo isn't gonna end up with a few pounds of snow one way or another.\n\nMore to the point however, he's an influential, powerful, experienced political figure, and he's sympathetic to the civil rights cause. He was the obvious choice to help the Civil Rights Act get through Eastland's Committee, and he's come up with a rather ingenious solution. According to a few archaic by-laws and regulations, we could just push this bill right past the Judiciary Committee and out to the Senate floor!\n\nLBJ's help is greatly appreciated, but at the same time, if we go for his plan and force the bill into a vote, we'll piss off the Nationalists even more, and they may end up filibustering the bill. If they do filibuster, the Act is dead in the water, and who knows where we stand? Do we take a risk and hope they don't filibuster, or do we just pray Eastland lets the bill through?"
 bobby.cra.4.a:0 "Go with the Johnson plan."
 bobby.cra.4.b:0 "The chance of a filibuster is already too high, we can't do this."

 bobby.cra.5.t:0 "The Act's Debut"
 bobby.cra.5.desc:0 "Johnson's plan went off without a hitch. Our little loophole is being tied up as we speak, but we shot the Civil Rights Act clear through the Judiciary Committee and right onto the Senate floor. Johnson just goes to show that there's still such a thing as a good Democrat, one who's willing to work across party lines for what's best for the American people.\n\nUnfortunately, we were right about pissing off the Nationalists. Eastland and Thurmond have been spending what seems like every waking moment complaining to the press. Funny how every single thing we do is a "tyrannic scandal, unseen since the time of Benedict Arnold!" In any case, we weren't counting on the Nationalist vote.\n\nThe bill's on the floor, but it's not quite time for it go to vote. All we can do now is court a few more votes and pray that the Nationalist caucus doesn't filibuster."
 bobby.cra.5.a:0 "Fingers crossed, this is a new dawn for America!"

 bobby.cra.6.t:0 "The Chairman's Choice"
 bobby.cra.6.desc:0 "It was a tough choice sending the Civil Rights Act off to Eastland's Committee, but it may have been the right call in the end. He is, as to be expected, pulling out all the stops to prevent the bill from leaving Committee and tearing holes in the bill wherever he can, but he's taken a break from being a professional belligerent ape to make us an offer!\n\nEastland will actually let the bill through the Judiciary Committee if we adjust the bill a bit more to his liking! While we would obviously prefer that the bill stays complete, Eastland's alterations aren't as extreme as one might expect. They would weaken the Act certainly, but it would still be a major win for civil rights and a clear framework for future legislation. Plus, it would obviously get us out on the Senate floor.\n\nThat said, Eastland's alterations come with more downsides than just a weakened Act. A weaker Act means less Democrat support, and the actual fight on the Senate floor will end up in rhetorical Battle-of-the-Somme style trench warfare, plus there's always a threat of a filibuster. Do we take Eastland up on his offer?"
 bobby.cra.6.a:0 "God damn him! Make the changes!"
 bobby.cra.6.b:0 "God damn him! We will not yield another inch!"

 bobby.cra.7.t:0 "The Filibuster"
 bobby.cra.7.desc:0 "Today has been a massive failure for the American civil rights movement. After all our work just getting the Civil Rights Act on the Senate floor, the Nationalists and Dixiecrats alike, led by Strom Thurmond, have staged a massive, truly legendary filibuster. Strom's been going for 14 hours and he doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon! Hell, there's a rumor that they've got a trashcan in the Senate cloak room so he can piss without ever technically leaving the floor. It almost makes you wanna say that you admire his dedication, if it wasn't dedication to such a heinous cause.\n\nAnyway, more to the point, the Act might just be about dead in the water if we can't somehow scrape up 60 votes to override them. Though it pains me to say it, we may be forced to rework the Civil Rights act into a more palatable form. It seems like it's back to the drafting room. Again."
 bobby.cra.7.a:0 "Damn them!"

 bobby.cra.8.t:0 "The Magic Total"
 bobby.cra.8.desc:0 "We need to somehow get 60 votes to counteract Strom's little tirade against the Civil Rights Act. 60 may not sound like too much on the scale of national governments, but out of 100 Senators... well, we've got work to do. The clear and obvious place to start is with Senators who are right on the very edge. Give the right people a little nudge and we should (hopefully) have our 60 votes in no time. In theory.\n\nThe question then becomes who do we target? There's essentially two options that we have: do we go for the more moderate Dixiecrats, and tack on some federal support for their home states? Or do we scare the more moderate Democrats into supporting the Act by warning them this is the last real chance for an American Civil Rights Act? Either way, we just have to pray to God, Allah, Buddah, Vishnu, and George Washington that we can get this filibuster overturned and this bill passed."

 bobby.cra.9.desc:0 "We've recently met with several influential Democrat leaders over guaranteeing Democratic support for the Civil Rights Act (and, more immediately, to counteract Strom's filibuster). The Democrats mostly support the concept of a Civil Rights Act, so negotiations went fairly smoothly.\n\nThat is, until LBJ, that damned crazy cowboy, downright demanded that we strengthen the Act if we want his support. Given the fact that he's the Democratic Party whip, it might make sense to give into his demands. Plus, a stronger Civil Rights Act isn't really much of a bad thing, is it?\n\nThat said, while we might have greater Democratic support if we acquiesce to LBJ, it could have unforeseen consequences towards NPP stability and solidarity. It might be the better option to simply tell the Democrats that the current Civil Rights Act is the only option, even if we lose some support."

 bobby.cra.10.desc:0 "We've recently opened negotiations with the Nationalists over the Civil Rights Act. The Nationalists are mostly against the Act right from the get go, so the negotiations were a bit touch-and-go right from the start. That said, they've sent out a list of demands that, if we incorporate, will mean we are all but guaranteed Congressional majority (assuming the Democrats play ball with this new bill).\n\nThe Nationalist alterations are about as extreme as to be expected, and will totally defang, declaw, and tar and feather the Civil Rights Act. They do keep a few token tennents in the bill, but to be frank, this new Act would come nowhere near our original goals.\n\nWhile working with the Nationalists would create a potentially more Congressionally popular Act, it would also complete gut the whole point of the Act. It may be wise to reject the Nationalists' demands and instead attempt to work with the Democrats."

The thing is, however, that filibuster never came! The Act is set to move into voting procedure very soon, and all without a hitch!\n\nThis is a big win, not just for us, but for the American people. We can focus on directly securing votes and generally preparing for the final vote on the Act without scrambling to react to some absurd, 24-hour long filibuster, and that means that we have a much better chance at passing the Civil Rights Act. We're therefore ever closer to reaching that perfect America enshrined in the Constitution-- a land where all are equal and free, judged by their conduct of action and content of ideas, not color of skin.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act is very far from a done deal, and we can't yet put our feet up and pat ourselves on the back. We can, however, breathe a sigh of relief that we have to jump one less hurtle on the road to a fair, free America."

This is a bill that rode the Underground Railroad. This is a bill that fought and died at Gettysburg, waving the banner of the Union and of abolitionism. This is a bill that marched with Martin Luther King and his 250,000, demanding freedom and equality under American law.\n\nWe stand now on the precipice of a new era of American history. This new era will surely be one of true American patriotism-- a nation coming together to celebrate our commitment to freedom, equality, and brotherhood. Because are we not all Americans? Are we not all deserving of the same opportunities and rights?\n\nIf we pass this Act, we will have one thing that they will never have in Germania. We will have a nation united and working tirelessly toward a true, free democracy. And we promise you this: Democracy will always win in the end.\n\nNow, we just have to hope that the Senate agrees."

All the hope we had for a better America, one truly by the people, of the people, and for the people has evaporated, as though it were a pleasant daydream of some fantasy world.\n\nWhat do we do now? What is there to do now? This was our dream, our goal, our destiny to claim. This was the last solid chance that civil rights are going to get in this country for the foreseeable future. And it was squandered. Where does one go from there?\n\nMartin Luther King Junior had a dream. That dream is dead. Malcom X promised freedom by either ballot or bullet. The ballot is failed.

Eastland expects that if he does this for us now (or if he "goes against every moral and logical fiber in my being for you un-American sissies"), we owe him some, unspecified favor ( the "very least you could do for making me break my own moral code").\n\nThe possibility of us owing Eastland a favor is honestly a terrifying one.

While MLK and Malcom X have certainly had (and continue to have) their differences (MLK emphasizes peaceful protests while Malcom X champions civil rights "by ballot or by bullet"), they certainly agree that civil rights is the most important issue that these United States face, and agree that a joint request to speak to RFK will have more weight and importance than two separate requests.\n\nFrankly, they're right. Combined, they have the weight of most of America's black population behind them. That level of public support is hard to ignore. Plus, it's just the right thing to do to get the perspectives of actual civil rights leaders as we attempt to pass our own Civil Rights Act.\n\nOn the other hand, inviting them to the White House will certainly lead to an outcry from certain, choice elements in Congress.

Thanks to the little stunt he'd pulled, the right-wingers had effectively blackballed him.\n\nWhich is why he was so surprised to pick up his phone a few days after the incident to find Thurmond on the other end. After they exchanged a few terse pleasantries, Thurmond got down to the meat. "Listen, Bobby. I might've bitten Nixon's bullet back in '60 but I ain't some idjit who don't have no idea how Congress works.

I'm willing to finagle my boys in Congress into supporting your civil rights legislation, but there ain't no way they'll swallow it the way it is now. You want this thing to become law, Bobby? You want your legacy to be civil rights? I can make that happen, but only if you play ball and make a few changes to the bill. Tone down some of them more... forceful clauses. You do that? I'll get it through Congress. Now I'm done hanging like a fish on a hook.

Suddenly, he slammed a manila folder onto the table. Refusing to give them the satisfaction of a flinch, Kennedy leaned forward to read the title. He wasn't surprised to see it was the latest draft of his nascent civil rights bill.\n\nTurning his head to exhale, Wallace drawled, "Senator Thurmond and I have been reading this over. Now, Bobby, don't you reckon it's a little soon to be pushing all'a this?

"Now, now, Bobby," said Thurmond, as though he were talking to a disobedient child, "we ain't done speakin' yet.

It also doesn't hurt that he has dirt on every Democrat who's ever so much as breathed in the Capitol Building during his time as Senate majority leader.\n\nOf course, this détente with the Democrats has not come without its price.

Rumour from the Capitol has it that the usually genial Carolinian flew into an incandescent rage when he was informed, shouting himself hoarse.\n\nWe're in the mud now. Thurmond has instructed all the members of the party's right-wing faction in Congress to boycott our legislation, voting absent on all of our bills. Not only that, but him and most of his lackeys are refusing to take calls from the White House. It's not likely he can keep this up forever, unless he wants to go down in the public's eye as an obstructionist dinosaur hellbent on fracturing the party for a petty personal grievance, but he can certainly keep his tantrum going until civil rights comes up for voting.\n\nAll we can do now is pray that we made the right choice and that our alliance with the Democrats will get us through this.

In a minute he'd call for his secretary to bring the draft to the typing pool so they could clean it up and copy it, but for now he was simply happy to enjoy the quiet solitude of the Oval Office at twilight, where nobody was trying to take something from him.\n\nAt the realisation that it was, in fact, twilight, the President did a double take, striding to the windows.

Nevertheless, despite his reservations, Kennedy had decided to try and compromise with Thurmond, get his boys to vote for civil rights, even if the bill had to be redrafted to be less ambitious than he had hoped. Changes could be made, as the years flew by. It wasn't a betrayal.\n\nAt least, that's what he told himself. As soon as Kennedy had taken the bait, Thurmond had reeled him in, making more and more outrageous demands, refusing to negotiate in good faith. "...and another thing, Mr. President, I reckon we oughta allow private schools to choose their own students. Shit, it ain't up to the government to force privately-owned, god-fearing institutions to take black people against their will."\n\nPresident Kennedy massaged his forehead between thumb and forefinger, receiver pressed to his ear. He could tell that Thurmond was trying to strongarm him. With every concession he was promised he only got more bold. It was fairly obvious that he was trying to whittle away as much of the bill as he could. Kennedy would have to let him have a few wins, but Thurmond seemed determined to gut it. It wouldn't surprise him if the Senator had a copy of the bill and a pair of scissors in front of him right now.\n\nPresident Kennedy took a deep breath while Thurmond continued to rattle off changes he wanted made.

Whose idea was it to form a party of segregationists and progressives, anyway? He supposed he could blame the bastard Thurmond and Henry Wallace for that one.\n\nStill, they could work together, from time to time. He wondered if it was worth the necessary compromises. The civil rights bill would get through Congress and pass into law, but had the cost been worth it? In the end, he'd stood strong, refusing to compromise on the central points, but Thurmond had still wrung some drastic changes out of him like dirty water from a dishcloth.\n\nBut that was the nature of compromise. Nobody got what they wanted and everyone ended up unhappy. Slumped in his chair, the President wondered if he should have worked harder to get Johnson and the Democrats on his side, rather than trying to co-operate with his party brothers. It would certainly have led to stronger civil rights legislation.\n\nWell, what was done was done. There was no use castigating himself for what he couldn't change. All he could do now was push the amended bill through Congress and hope that more progressive senators would be elected in the future."

His face was burning with humiliation. Here he was, the goddamn President, and a Senator of his own party was having more of an impact on the bill than he was. And Thurmond didn't even want it in the first place. He'd basically castrated it, tearing out everything that made it righteous, leaving only token changes, minor reforms, ineffectual promises, and plenty of loopholes for Southern governors to exploit to their hearts' content. It was a massacre.\n\nAnd there was nothing he could do. The President wanted to vomit right there on the Resolute desk, disgusted at his own weakness. He'd tried to negotiate in good faith with Thurmond's reactionaries and this was the price he'd had to pay. It was better than nothing, but not much better. He'd gone into this trying to achieve the dream of equality for every American, and that dream had been sacrificed on the bloody altar of realpolitik.\n\nThe President sighed, holding his head in his hands. Millions of African-Americans looked up to him to save them, to pull them into the light, and he'd as good as betrayed them.\n\nWhen that bill passed Congress, they'd see just how wrong they had been to put their trust in him."

 bobby.contelpro.2.desc:0 "LITTLE ROCK: Today, a low-ranking functionary of the National Progressive Pact's Nationalist faction was arrested by police at his Shannon Hills home outside the city as allegations come to light that the local branch of the faction may have committed electoral fraud by stuffing ballots to influence local NPP internal elections. Though as yet unconfirmed, Nationalist leaders across the nation have vehemently denounced the alleged actions of the Little Rock branch and insist that this is a local matter and is not reflective of the faction as a whole. President Kennedy spoke briefly on the issue this morning at a publicity event in Baltimore, saying that "Americans have put their trust in me and I will personally ensure that the cancer eating away at the Party is excised in the name of justice for everyone in this great nation." This is just the latest in a string of disappointments for the Nationalist faction, already significantly declined in influence following the election of the President and the rise of his Progressive faction to party dominance. Following party discontent over the scandal, it is unlikely the faction will be able to distance themselves from these events in the weeks to come."

Although it is not altogether clear at this stage, an anonymous source claims that evidence indicates that the ballot-stuffing conspiracy to win key areas for the Nationalist faction is widespread across the South and Midwest and that several of the faction's leaders were aware of it and supported the practice to harm the powerful Progressive faction. Speaking from a Baltimore publicity event this morning, President Kennedy said "Americans elected the NPP to root out the injustices of this great nation of ours, and I will not turn a blind eye to the crimes of those cancerous individuals eating away at our own party. Rest assured that those responsible for this travesty will be found and made to answer for their actions, and those groups within the party that seek to contravene our goals will be cast down". Party sentiment appears to be heavily with the President as all across the nation calls have begun for major members of the Nationalist faction to step down. This is just the latest in a string of major disappointments for the faction, and appears to be the capstone on their declining influence within the NPP. Whether or not the faction successfully weathers this scandal remains to be seen, but it is unlikely they will hold significant influence within the party in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the Oval Office, President Kennedy puts down his newspaper and smirks."

With this telegram, he could seriously cripple the Nationalists by paying for airtime on radio stations in key areas where the Nationalists went up against the Republicans or the Democrats, boosting the RDC in the public opinion and taking votes from the Nationalists.

The others had to be let go, yelling that they'd sue. Nevertheless, this victory appears to be far from pyrrhic.

He read the newspaper, hands whitening as he gripped the pages tighter and tighter.\n\n"Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, a noted conservative firebrand was revealed to have paid for an illegal abortion for his daughter, Joanne, after she became pregnant in college. Using his connections and wealth, he arranged for the procedure to be conducted in Virginia. Senator Goldwater declined to comment, citing his family's privacy."\n\nHe knew why this had been done. This was a dirty trick by the Kennedy Administration to discredit him, to shut him up and halt his criticisms. They thought that the shame, the ignominy would be enough to silence him. They had miscalculated. He sat down and began to write a speech."

 bobby.contelpro.26.desc: "Looking around the Senate chamber, Barry Goldwater felt a brief rush of fear. The speech in his hands was one of the most significant of his career and the wave of emotions since his daughter's call still had not fully passed. His career, his family, his legacy all hung in the balance and he cursed those who had stolen the letters. Rising, speech in hand, he began to speak.\n\n"Recently, the Washington Post published a story about my daughter. I will not comment on whether the allegations are true or not, as I believe this is a private, personal matter that should never have left the confines of my family. Those who broke into my daughter's home, terrifying her, and stole personal effects should be ashamed of themselves. I hope they will, if caught, be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law." His voice had steadied as he continued his speech, the eyes of the nation upon him.\n\n"I believe in a limited government, properly restrained and limited by our founding documents. I cannot see how the state intervening in private and personal medical decisions is consistent with that ethos. I ask for your privacy and respect as my family grapples with this reminder of a difficult time for us." Now, the volcanic rage bubbled up within him as he turned to the last page.\n\n"I believe this theft and leak were motivated by my opposition to the Kennedy Administration's agenda. If this was an attempt to silence me, then it has failed and I will never stop speaking out on behalf of the people and the Constitution. It should concern every citizen that this President, or his allies, when faced with a tenacious opponent, resorted to dirty tricks rather than open debate.""

He had won. Clark, when confronted about his nighttime motel visits, had shamefacedly agreed to tender his resignation and keep quiet about COINTELPRO. This was a great victory, so why didn't it feel like one?\n\nStill, thought Kennedy, taking a sip, this meant the secret would be kept. His legacy would remain untarnished by the occasionally pragmatic things he had to do to secure it, and he was now free to continue his crusade against injustice. So what if he had to circumvent the strict lay of the law a few times? That was hardly criminal. All's fair in love and war, after all, and if the rightists were determined to stand in the path of progress then they deserved to get cast down.\n\nYes, he thought, feeling the strange, powerful lightness of triumph rising in his chest.

When one of our agents confronted Clark at his office with our knowledge of his habitual motel visits, he immediately became furious and threatened to call the police if he didn't leave.\n\nAll our attempts to silence Clark have been total failures and we're in serious strife. If we don't do something drastic within the next few days, it's a certainty that Clark will leak our crimes (and Kennedy now couldn't think of them as anything other than crimes) to the press.\n\nKennedy felt his gorge rising just thinking about it. If the truth about COINTELPRO got out, he would be forever tarnished in the eyes of every American and his legacy would be annihilated. His achievements would go forgotten and he would be forever remembered as the President who criminally harassed his political enemies for no reason other than the fact that they had a different vision for America's future than him.\n\nKennedy looked at the phone.

 bobby.justice.3.t:0 "Sins of the Father"
 bobby.justice.3.desc:0 "Exposed to the foibles of Washington from a young age, Robert Kennedy came to realize early in life that America is a land of contradictions. Many of his father's fellow senators professed to value freedom and liberty above all, while simultaneously denying the fundamental rights of a great many of their own citizens for no reason other than the colour of their skin. The Civil Rights Act is a step in the right direction to right the wrongs of his forebears, but compared to the many injustices plaguing America, it seems but a drop in a vast, vast basin.\n\nSitting in the Oval Office, nursing a tumbler of scotch, the President wonders why he doesn't feel any sense of accomplishment. He'd changed the lives of millions, and yet it felt like he'd hardly done anything at all. So many terrible things were still happening across America. School segregation, redlining, FBI harassment, it seemed like the list kept going on and on, an unassailable mountain of obstacles.\n\nKennedy felt resoluteness rising in him, buoying him up even as he felt like sinking. He was the President now, and he had power, the power to do what was right. I can't rest, he thought, as he downed the scotch, until I get it all done.\n\nEven if it kills me."

Plenty of ancient old toads from less enlightened administrations populate America's labyrinthine institutions, slagging off their new boss while also never failing to collect their paycheck every week.\n\nIt's about time our enemies in government learn not to bite the hand that feeds them. There are plenty to go after, but Hoover and his FBI stand out as the first unruly mutt to be brought to heel. No matter the cost, all traces of reactionary dissent must be purged from the government so that nothing and no one stands in the way of justice for all Americans."

 bobby.justice.5.desc:0 "Nobody said reforming the nation would be easy, but it'd be a whole lot less painful if our own employees weren't actively scheming against us. Using the FBI as his own personal army of spies, Hoover has become one of the most powerful and feared men in the country, covertly infiltrating government organizations all across America, allegedly amassing a huge quantity of blackmail material, and carrying out clandestine and often illegal operations. In essence, they're a shadow government within the government, infesting our institutions like dormant tuberculosis bacteria, just waiting for the conditions to be right for them to awaken.\n\nThis has to stop. Though he should be our obedient underling, Hoover has effectively become a rogue spymaster with an unprecedented level of power and clout, and his interests are very often at odds with our own. He's far too entrenched in the FBI to be effectively neutralized, but perhaps we can give him a bit of his own medicine to get a leash on him and stop his unethical operations.\n\nThere have been unseemly rumours about Hoover and his long-time protege Clyde Tolson floating around for decades, involving all-male parties and furtive visits from handsome young men in the middle of the night. Hoover may like dirty tricks, but two can play at that game. Let's fling his closet open and see what skeletons fall out."

Even more interestingly, we got some pictures of Hoover and Tolson meeting with a pair of handsome young men in the hotel bar and taking them up to their room.\n\nAll you have to do is a little bit of digging and all of a sudden you're turning up yellowed old skeletons all over the place."

 bobby.justice.8.desc:0 "Since we put a leash on Hoover, our agents have been steadily tearing through the FBI's files to figure out exactly what they've been up to, and, surprise surprise, it's not sunshine and rainbows. From the records that remain it appears that Hoover has been using the FBI as his own personal army, sending agents to acquire blackmail material on important figures and extrajudicially pursuing suspected criminals.\n\nAmong the less shocking stuff, in a number of redacted files, our agents have uncovered evidence of a secret program called COINTELPRO. We don't have all the facts so far, but it appears to be an intelligence gathering program focused on somewhat vaguely-chosen "enemies of the nation", most notable civil rights leaders. Hoover apparently authorized the use of illegal tactics to gather information on these people and to harass them into silence and inaction.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a complete and total violation of the victims' rights and is a subversion of everything President Kennedy stands for. It's time to drag Hoover into the Oval Office and have a rather serious chat with him."

 bobby.justice.9.desc:0 "The air sat still and muggy in the Roosevelt Room. Many of the men sitting around the table had rolled up their sleeves and loosened their ties. Kennedy's chair creaked back as he looked at each of them in turn- Hoover, Guy, key members of his cabinet. He turned to the aides clustered around the wall and asked them to leave. When he was alone with his most trusted underlings- as well as Hoover- he began.\n\n"Mr. Hoover, so far we've discussed the principles and functions of the COINTELPRO program. And for now I'm letting you off the hook." The President had hoped Hoover would visibly show relief, but he just sat there blankly like an Olmec head. "However, it strikes me that it would be a colossal waste of resources to simply cancel the program."\n\nThat got some odd looks from Guy and the others. Hoover narrowed his eyes in appraisal. Kennedy continued, "It has occurred to me that with minimal difficulty this program could be repurposed to... investigate... certain reactionary elements that oppose the goals and ideals of this administration. Including the enemies of justice within the party."\n\nEveryone in the room looked taken aback. Guy stared at the President open-mouthed in surprise, internally furious Kennedy hadn't consulted him beforehand. Hoover, after a moment of inaction, smiled knowingly. "Of course, Mr. President. Why, it would hardly take any time at all. All you've got to do is write me a list." His toadlike grin stretched out his every wrinkle.\n\nKennedy nodded blankly. "Very good, Mr. Hoover.

Robert exploded, standing up from his seat, his gaze and eyes brimming with fury "You were there with me from the beginning, you know this road wasn't ever going to be clean! We can just stand in our moral high ground and pretend the opposition is not pulling strings every moment to deny us every inch of victory! We..." Robert's gaze softened, his expression mutedly relaxed from fury and outrage, to a sorrowful, guilty expression "...I can't, I can't fail them too, Guy. I can't fail America."\n\nThe silence in the room stretched for long minutes before the scraping sounds of a chair indicated his VP has stood up, and he left a room with a simple sentence, but one that all but branded the President's heart with a hot iron."

This epidemic of racist violence against American citizens by the men who are being paid to protect them must be stopped.\n\nThis morning, President Kennedy gave a speech at the Capitol virulently denouncing the systemic racism of law enforcement, and promising to root out the un-American racists entrenched within the nation's police.

Clark collapsed back into his chair, exhausted. "Christ's sake, Bobby. We hate 'em as much as you do, but we should be focusing on reducing their influence within the party, not going after them with a phalanx of spies like we're the second coming of Nixon!"\n\nClark slumped back, panting and puffing. Guy sighed and leaned forward, "Listen Bobby, I'll keep this brief. Ramsey and I can't be part of this. It's an insult to democracy and the Constitution. I went to you first as a friend, now you make me come to you as the Vice President. This is a formal complaint."\n\nKennedy slammed his fists down on the desk, suddenly full of vitriol. Guy narrowed his eyes. Kennedy had been flying off the handle more and more often lately whenever he was challenged. "Do you two," began Kennedy, barely keeping his rage in check, "know who you're talking to? I'm the goddamn President! I have no choice, this has to be done if we want to keep Thurmond and Eastland's minions in check! We can't keep waiting until we starve them out, they would do the same thing to us!" He raised his arms above him and stared up at the immaculately whitewashed ceiling. "This is not a crime. This is justice."\n\nSilence reigned in the room, and Bobby wasn't too sure who said it, who said the line that burned a fire in his spirit, and led him two consider what was once two friends the highest traitors of America.\n\nSomething in him died when he called Hoover, but all he could remember is the rage the sentence instilled in him."

To put it lightly, it has been a catastrophic political disaster the scale of which surpasses all others in American history. It's like they've already forgotten about Nixon.\n\nWe have everyone in Washington, literally everyone, going for our throat. Our friends have distanced themselves and even our staunchest allies won't return our calls. Thurmond's coterie have been screaming themselves hoarse all day and, most worryingly, the President has already received numerous death threats. The Kennedy Administration teeters on the edge of annihilation as discussion of impeachment begins behind closed doors.\n\nIn the Oval Office, the President sits slumped in his chair. He hasn't moved for almost fifteen full minutes and can't seem to find the will to do anything. Kennedy sighed, looking around at the room that had once played host to both his father and his brother. How would he be remembered now? As a stalwart of civil rights, an enemy of injustice and a champion of progress, or as a cowardly, corrupt slimeball who used his power to contravene the Constitution and to send an army of spies against his political adversaries?\n\nKennedy clenched his hands into fists and sat up. No, he couldn't let himself fall into despair. For God's sake, he was the President! I have to move forward, he thought, as he picked up the phone. This can't be the end.

Now Clark was out of the picture, there was nobody to stop the expansion of COINTELPRO and his campaign to end injustice could continue unimpeded. After all, a weapon is just a weapon. In the hands of a good man, it is an instrument of good. Now nobody would ever know he had done it, and his legacy as an icon of progressivism was ensured. It was, perhaps, a little unseemly, but it had been the right thing to do. His use of COINTELPRO had made the world a better place, and he kept telling himself that, over and over again.\n\nThe President exhaled with satisfaction and turned around, where Guy stood, his shoulders slouched. Kennedy walked behind the desk and sat down.\n\n"Wonderful day, isn't it William? It's a shame to be cooped up in here. I think I'll cut it early today, take Ethel and the kids for a picnic." He started rifling through the papers on his desk. "You can go now, William. I don't have anything else to discuss."\n\nGuy glumly turned to leave the Oval Office, feeling defeated.

Restricting redlining will be very unpopular with business owners and bankers, as well as the wider white population in general, but the unpopularity of our policies has never stopped us from trying to do the right thing before.\n\nTo deal with redlining, we could either do what's right and go hard on banning the practice, erasing every loophole, or we could try and preserve some of our political capital and put some small but meaningful restrictions into place instead. The reactionaries won't be happy either way, but if we compromise we might be able to avoid their outrage for once."

All in all, we've been able to remove one of the biggest obstacles to the racial integration of America's neighbourhoods, and for once doing the right thing wasn't painful at all!"

Our new restrictions basically generated no blowback, but we could perhaps take that as a sign that our enemies can't even be bothered opposing them because they don't do much good.\n\nPresident Kennedy leans back in his chair and looks up at the immaculately white ceiling, and feels frustrated at letting his trepidation prevent him from going all the way."

This morning, one such incident arising from integration pushback appeared on the front page of President Kennedy's newspaper, making him grimace from something other than his morning grapefruit.\n\nApparently, a pair of black teenagers whose family has recently moved into a previously redlined suburb in Atlanta attempted to order lunch at the local greasy spoon diner and the owner, one Lester Maddox, refused to serve them and asked them to leave. Despite this obviously being illegal since the passing of the Civil Rights Act, Maddox's supposed right to choose his customers has become Dixie's cause du jour, and Maddox has already appeared on several right-leaning Southern radio stations bemoaning the sudden change in his community's demographic makeup.\n\nWe have to respond to this quickly before it spirals out of control, to make it publicly known that the regressive racism of Maddox and his ilk has no place in modern America. However, despite being a thoroughly unpleasant man, Maddox has gained a strong measure of support from Southern whites and reactionaries everywhere. We could formally prosecute him to make an example at the risk of stoking the political fire, or we could give him a slap on the wrist to make our disapproval known without starting a fight."

Nevertheless, this was the right thing to do. People need to understand that integration is the future and they need to accept it if they want to do business. Despite the blowback, at least African-Americans know we're willing to go to bat for them even at political risk to ourselves.

Some are even questioning how committed we are to the cause of ending racial injustice.\n\nProsecuting Maddox would have blown the South up yet again, but by not doing so we've alienated our base.

In this modern age, African-Americans still lack many of the resources and opportunities provided to their white brothers. This should not be so. This great nation was founded by men of many backgrounds and cultures, who came together to create a common bond between them all, to create a nation in which all would have the same rights and privileges and could enjoy freedom and liberty without impediment. America was founded on the principle that all of its citizens would be free and equal, and the freedom of all of our citizens is diminished when not all Americans are equal. Are we to say that this is the land of the free for all but those with black skin? From now on, when some of the less enlightened say that black children should be excluded from white schools, we will respond with a resounding 'No'. In our ongoing fight against injustice, we will promote the integration of schools across America, so that all of our nation's children are privy to the same essential rights and opportunities."\n\nThe press pounced on that like hyenas on an injured gazelle, knowing full well that discussion of integration would stoke the flames of controversy.

Anthony could hardly believe his eyes as he was shown the vast collection of equipment his new school had for experiments. His teacher taught the class the basic principles of chemistry by showing them how to make 'elephant toothpaste'. Anthony oohed and aahed alongside his new classmates as the black goop shot out of the tube.\n\n12:30: English Literature. Every student was handed a copy of Huckleberry Finn, which Anthony was surprised to learn was his to keep. At his old school they never had enough books for everyone. The students took turns to read it aloud, and he felt everyone's eyes on him when the boy next to him suddenly stopped as he came to the next word - it was the 'n' word. For a moment the boy seemed to be at a loss for words, then he skipped it over, and the tension abated. It made Anthony feel awkward.\n\n4:30: Hometime. Anthony said goodbye to the trio of boys he'd befriended at recess and made his way outside, trying to ignore the eyes of some of the other students and their parents boring through him like a drill. He'd known from the beginning that being the school's first black kid wasn't going to be easy, but he was sure he'd be able to win them over in time.

Despite their pretensions at self-determination, states are still heavily dependent on federal funding to stay afloat, particularly poorer Southern States. It's about time they learned that deliberately standing in the way of integration will not come without consequences.

Like most racists, he's been protesting integration using thinly-veiled arguments for the rights of the states to be, we must suppose, as racist as they choose. The Republicans love this stuff and the rightists that are our supposed party brothers have let their approval be heard.\n\nThe general consensus at the moment seems to be that Goldwater's just angling to increase his popularity in the Midwest, but regardless of his motives, he's proving to be one of our major opponents in Washington and we need to find some way to effectively deal with him before his dominance of the political discourse comes to bite us in the ass at the polling booth.\n\nIntegration busing is very unpopular at the moment among all but our strongest supporters, and if we continue to aggressively push busing it might just hurt us and give Goldwater and his ilk more ammunition. We could steam ahead with our plans no matter the cost, or we could pull back and preserve our political capital. After all, surely a fire starved of oxygen will gutter out?"

Goldwater seems to always be two steps ahead and is able to turn every move we make to his advantage. To make matters worse, Goldwater's had quite a bit of success in mobilizing the small-government grassroots by pushing the angle that integration busing is an example of federal tyranny triumphing over the rights of the states.\n\nGoldwater has very quickly become the biggest danger to our administration.

We avoided a fight only by modifying our policies to fit the preferences of a bunch of cryptoracists who'd rip up the Civil Rights Act if they thought they could get away with it. At least Goldwater's been forced to begrudgingly consent to busing though, and the Republicans have ceased their endless bellyaching.\n\nSomething doesn't seem right though.

As gratifying as it would be to simply ignore him, Goldwater has become too big to ignore, and America waits for our response.\n\nIt'd be a shame to give in to Goldwater's bullying, but this situation feels like a bomb waiting to go off. We have to handle this carefully.

We can give out interest-free loans to families wanting to settle there, to prevent the possibility of black families getting redlined right out of our new postracial paradises.\n\nSurely once they get to know their new neighbours, people will be able to see past the colour of their skin.\n\nWe hope."

The time has come to wrench the dark thorn of hate from America's heart, to reform the nation and end the neverending culture war.

President Kennedy sits alone in the Oval Office and wonders what to do. In his heart, he wants to forcibly integrate everything as fast as possible and wipe clean the stain of segregation from America, but something gnaws at him.

Most of their neighbours were white, but there were a few other black families here and there. Often he found it hard to believe he lived in such proximity to white families. They always seemed courteous enough, but who could tell if the thorns of hate twisted their hearts, hidden away from their neighbours' eyes?\n\nAs Anthony reached his new home, he smiled to hear his father's favourite jazz record playing, filling the air with mellow saxophone notes and the clash of cymbals. Placing his books down, he joined his father and his sisters at the table. Anthony's mother led them in saying grace, then served them all a plate of roast chicken with mashed potatoes as Anthony excitedly told them about his day and all the wonderful things they had at his new school.

Even the Democrats aren't too keen on it.\n\nTo make matters worse, if that's possible, the Klan is planning a huge rally atop Stone Mountain in Georgia, where they're going to burn a gigantic wooden cross that will be visible all over Atlanta. We have no choice but to send in the army to watch over the gathering and keep the peace, but even that will leave law and order teetering on a knife's edge.

Their wives and daughters weep on television screens all over America.\n\nThe South is ready to explode, and the rest of the country isn't much better. People are in an uproar over what they see as the government murdering people who were protesting against their breaking the First Amendment. Radio demagogues ask whom the "Yankee hit squads" will go after next.\n\nNeedless to say, this is bad for us. Goldwater, Thurmond and their allies are screaming red-faced in Congress and there's not a newspaper or a news program in the nation on our side right now.

Which has priority above all. Burke has time and again emphasized how he is in the cabinet only to maintain security interests and make sure that government policy will compromise more important strategical goals, and during the war in South Africa he was in charge of the Congo landings that effectively broke the stalemate and guaranteed OFN victory. Minister of interior 'Scoop' Jackson overheard the conversation and intervened to object any replacement of Burke, Burke would not have been able to convince the other top officers to go through with the Congo plan unless he knew he had the President's support, having such a qualified military man on top of our government is a benefit, argued Scoop.\n\nClaude Pepper, former nominee for Vice President has been suggested as a possible name, he has long been a member of the Party and knows his ins and outs of the Dixiecrats, having stood on the ballot with now, Speaker of the House, Strom Thurmond in 1960.

The passage of the Civil Rights Act is an extraordinary step forward for all of us but, today, our struggles are not over. While the equality we strive for has now been codified, we must maintain our commitment to the downtrodden across America and refuse to withdraw into complacency. Unfortunately, we must still come to terms with the root of the issue.\n\nAcross the country, the remnants of prejudice continue to fester, many unabated by the legislation we have passed. While the blatant and ugly efforts of states to segregate the races of America have been dashed, the echoes from earlier times have nonetheless persisted. To many, these institutions are a fact of life, for good or ill, but our nation was not founded on the principles espoused by America's founders. I call on all citizens of the United States to look at ourselves and our society critically, and question some of the things we take for granted. The un-American attitudes of racist groups have lost their stranglehold on politics, but that does not mean they have been vanquished for good.\n\nConfronting these uncomfortable aspects will not be comfortable or enjoyable, but it is something we must do as a nation if we ever plan to move forward.

He was the President and he'd have dinner with whomever he wished. After a brief photo op in the Oval Office, Dr. King, the President and their wives had met for a private dinner away from the cameras, to strengthen their relationship in the eyes of the public and discuss the cause for civil rights.\n\nKennedy liked Dr. King, and wondered if, in another life, free from the shackles of politics, they might have been friends. In this life, however, they both had responsibilities pulling them apart, King's to his community and Kennedy's to the welfare of the nation. Nevertheless, they agreed on the absolute necessity for racial justice and that the right to equality is deserved by all Americans. King was no radical; he understood realpolitik and knew that Rome wasn't built in a day, but the President could still see the yearning for a better future behind King's eyes.

After a youth spent as a petty criminal, Malcolm X had found religion in prison with the Nation of Islam, quickly becoming the organization's public face and a major spokesperson for racial justice. Though differing from many other black leaders due to his racial separatist ideals, Malcolm X has over time become one of the most prominent and outspoken figures fighting for racial equality.\n\nNot to mention the most controversial, no matter which side of the debate you're on. As he sipped his coffee (wine, of course, would be haram), listening to Ethel and Malcolm's wife Betty exchanging stilted small talk at the other end of the table, Kennedy wondered if meeting with Malcolm X had been such a good idea. Malcolm X seemed skeptical, and frankly, Kennedy couldn't blame him. After hundreds of years of getting sidelined by white politicians, why should Malcolm X trust him? Kennedy wished he could somehow show the man what lay in his heart, his genuine commitment to justice, to racial equality, to bettering the lives of African-Americans.\n\nIn the end, both men left feeling frustrated. Kennedy wondered if it had been a foregone conclusion as the phone began to rang, an incensed Thurmond on the other end."

You know, I remember, growing up on the outskirts of the city, in Brookline, all the terrible signs they used to have. Outside businesses, stores, everything. Do you remember what they said, people of Boston? 'No Coloreds allowed' or 'Whites Only'. Traveling down the Freedom Trail today, though, I saw no such signs. Did you?

Time and time again, this great city and its residents have proven themselves to be a beacon of enterprising, welcoming, hard working Americans. Chicago, in short, is the embodiment of the American dream. Growing up in New England, from time to time you would hear the term 'Yankee Ingenuity' get thrown around. It basically refers to the American indomitable spirit of hard work and get-stuff-done determination that have allowed us to become as great and prosperous as we currently are. Standing here in Chicago, all I can see is Yankee Ingenuity."\n\n"However, there is a poison to all hard work. Some would see workers given nothing if it meant that their own pockets might get a little deeper. Workers of all kinds, deserve rights. They deserve the right to unionize. They deserve the right to demand better wages. The Progressives have always fought for such things, and we will continue to fight until the plight of the blue-collar man is rectified."\n\nKennedy stepped back from the podium and stood next to William Guy, the crowd going up in applause behind him.

At the core of American society, there is a disease. In inborn illness that we willingly accept as the societal norm when it is clear to see that it weakens us terribly. I, of course, speak of the policies of segregation and state-sponsored racism."\n\n"I see people of different colors and creeds standing before me today. White, Black, Hispanic, Asian. To all those affected by racism, I say that your fight is not forgotten. Civil Rights is not limited just to the African American communities-- it extends to all peoples, of all colors, who have been discriminated against by our twisted system. There are many individuals who have had to remind us of that. In particular, I would say Cesar Chavez; a man to whom I owe great respect. There are, of course, countless others who have contributed to the struggle. However, the struggle itself is not over, so we must stand together, regardless of color, and demand that we be judged not by the color of our skin but by the content of our character.

That does not matter. I stand here, in one of the most peaceful, beautiful places our great nation has to offer, to say that no matter how divided we may seem, we are still an indivisible union, connected through soulful bonds that may never be torn apart. Every year, millions of people visit this place. As such, it remains, and forever shall remain one of the great bonds that tie our union together. We are a nation of one people, one heritage. Regardless of race or creed or color, we are not simply Americans, we are America itself."\n\n"Standing in such a place as this, we may be reminded of the words of our forebear John Winthrop to his shipmates aboard the Arabella, as they were traveling to the New World, for a new life.

Today, as always, the eyes of all people remain upon us, anxiously studying the American Experiment.

Some said Houston, for its great population; some recommended San Antonio, for a trip to the Alamo; some called for Austin, for its place as the state capital. Bobby himself eventually had to intervene, deciding to visit Austin. On the steps of the Texas Capitol, thousands of people- of all races- looked on. Beside Kennedy stood Lyndon Baines Johnson, the famous Texan politician, and former opponent of RFK's presidential run.\n\n"People of Austin, before I begin, I want to thank all of you for the warm welcome I have received, not only from your city but also your leaders. I of course speak of the man beside me, Lyndon Johnson, one whom I greatly respect. In divided times, such as we find ourselves in presently, it is easy to see only the name of the party, and not the name of the man who follows it. It is easy to dismiss someone as 'other' because of the party line. However, I say that a man is loyal to his own convictions, and, as such, should not be judged upon the party with which he sides. I see the actions and policies of your Congressman Lyndon Johnson and I am moved and inspired by them. He has fought for the torch of Civil Rights as much as any Progressive, so why should I not call him friend?"\n\n"The actions of Lyndon Johnson reflect the whole of the State of Texas, and they will not go unnoticed, nor unappreciated. The only way that we can achieve true equality in this great nation is through the spirit of unity that ties all Americans together. Only through unity, may we achieve equality. So, together, I believe that the Republican-Democrats and the Progressives may yet carry the torch of Civil Rights not individually, but together."\n\nBobby continued to give short speeches intermittently with Lyndon Johnson, as well as the Governor of Texas John Connally, for more than an hour. When the whole affair had finished and all attendees had shaken hands for unity or somesuch, Robert's throat was dry and sore, and his hand ached from the crushing grip of LBJ. He hopped back into the jet black Continental with Vice President William Guy. "Next stop: Alabama," he said.\n\n"Wallace is gonna give you shit, that's a given," said Guy, "we could rub it in his face.""

It had everything: a full bathroom, bigger than some inner-city apartments; a king-size feather bed; radio; mini-fridge; even a TV! Unfortunately, the TV only had a few channels, so Bobby chose the news as background noise while he read about the latest developments in Europe. Regardless, after a long day of giving fiery speeches in Montgomery, Alabama, it was nice to relax for a few minutes.\n\nIt was quite the miracle he had the television turned up at all, as he heard his name said. Intrigued, Bobby increased the volume. "...overnor Wallace claimed President Robert F. Kennedy came to Alabama this week only to slander him and the entire state of Alabama. Wallace said that he had served the state of Alabama faithfully for many years and would not let a 'Yankee upstart with no political experience' tell him or his constituents how to live or run themselves. He also said 'Kennedy is trying to break the unity of the NPP and the State of Alabama'."\n\nBobby turned off the TV, his lips curling into a frown. He expected and hoped for an outcome like this. This was just the opportunity to kick Wallace down a couple of notches. If Wallace wanted to play ball, he'd soon learn a simple truth."

The Montgomery hotel had been pleasant, but with George Wallace's comments, it was time to leave. With fresh-polished shoes clacking down the marble foyer, he could see the entourage of press standing outside.\n\nWalking through the revolving glass door, Bobby stopped before the press. He eyed them up with a smile as they begged for comment. An NBC reporter shoved a microphone in his face, asking what he thought of George Wallace's recent claims about his speech yesterday. Bobby straightened his tie. "It is my opinion," he said, "that Governor Wallace is being slightly hyperbolic and hypocritical."\n\n"I have spent the better part of my life making a career out of politics, when he claims I am new to it. He claims that I am attempting to divide the National Progressive Pact and his state; rather, when I spoke yesterday, I was drawing attention to injustice, which should be unacceptable to the party and to Alabama. As for 'dividing his state', I do not believe his state was ever behind him in the first place. As I recall, the last gubernatorial election in Alabama had a little over 300,000 registered white voters, and less than 20,000 black voters, even though black people comprise a quarter of Alabamans. When election day rolled around, there were almost 290,000 votes cast by white voters, and less than 2,000 by black ones. Draw your own conclusions from that, but I say that I could not divide the State of Alabama against George Wallace because it never truly was united behind him in the first place. Good day."\n\nWith that, Kennedy and Guy passed through the mob of press and hopped into the black Lincoln Continental. "Wow," Guy said. "Wow is right," replied Kennedy, "I'm sick of Wallace's shenanigans. Now, I'm still on the fence about going on to Florida. I thought maybe we could head back to Washington.""

It would have been perfect had it not been for the day's events. "I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Every time I opened my mouth he would scream over me. Made me look like a goddamn fool. I've already gotten calls from 3 party members, all from different wings. They asked me what the hell happened."\n\n"I know," said Guy, "it's a rough business, especially when dealing with an animal like Wallace."\n\nBobby sighed, watching the distant flashing light of an airplane as it silently moved across the night sky.

In front of him, he reckoned there were about 10,000 people, most of them young, and a lot holding surfboards.\n\n"Before I begin, I want to give my appreciation for the very warm welcome that I've been given by the beautiful city of Miami," Bobby said over the muffled laughter of the few who got the joke. "The people of Florida are a diverse and freedom-loving group. This state saw, and continues to see, migration from all over the country. You have a bit of Southern values, Yankee ingenuity, and Western free-spirit. You are a microcosm of the diversity of America..."\n\n"...Despite the presence of totalitarian and communist regimes less than 100 miles from here, you have managed to maintain the freedom-loving nature that binds our union together in the darkest of times. If that nature is to be maintained, these communist elements must not be allowed to set foot on American soil."\n\nAfter speaking for more than 20 minutes, Bobby was hot, sweating, and unbelievably thirsty, he excused himself from the platform and left with his entourage of Secret Service and aides in tow.

Bringing a country together was hard work, and who knows how successful he would be in the first place.\n\nHe walked over to the massive swivel chair that sat between the windows and the desk. He sat down, kicking back and breathing in an atmosphere of relaxation. The charity for all campaign had seemed to be a nominal success, but it was hard to tell so soon after all the work was said and done. Bobby didn't think a campaign like that had ever been attempted by a sitting President. So many hours going over fine details with dozens of different speeches with dozens of writers.

Despite attempts to pass the bill as quickly as possible, resistance in both houses was strong and excessively prolonged, with senator Barry Goldwater filibustering the act for nearly ten hours before conceding defeat and allowing its passage.\n\nThe Social Security Act is the next addition to a laundry list of recently passed welfare programs, part of a greater initiative by President Robert Kennedy to expand the government's role in financial aid. By creating a system by which the government can dole out financial benefits to retired or disabled citizens, Kennedy has promised to create a safety net that any American can fall back on once they can no longer take care of themselves. To prevent widespread abuse of these benefits, the age at which citizens are eligible to start collecting money has been set to 65.\n\nAlready, critics of Social Security have spoken out in protest of the bill, accusing the act of being heavily flawed. Chief among their complaints is the mandatory contribution by Americans to maintain the system, which they say creates another unneeded burden on the working class. Still others have called it an example of excessive government overreach, something many Americans see as dangerous. Nonetheless, popular support for the act has been widespread, and many lawmakers consider Social Security a victory. Last night, President Kennedy held festivities with his cabinet in celebration."

Through earmarks, categorical grants, and other means, he has recently cooperated with Congress to send million of dollars to food banks and shelters in all parts of the United States. Millions of dollars from the federal government will now be used to provide meals to America's poor so no American goes hungry.\n\nThis act has garnered widespread support from both sides of the political aisle, with many praising his initiative. Democratic lawmakers, have been especially supportive, with many voting for and often supporting President Kennedy's food bank programs. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson specifically rallied many of these politicians to support the funding initiative, which he has said aligns closely with his own goals."

Civil Rights has been one of the most divisive issues in American discourse this century, and it is time to finally put it to rest by passing a strong Act to end the practice once and for all.\n\nOur supermajority in congress means President Kennedy will face no challenges there, giving us a lot of freedom in deciding the final contents of the Civil Rights Act. While congress won't pose any difficulties, however, our own party might prove trickier to handle. The Nationalist wing is already concerned about their waning influence, and are firmly against Civil Rights. We can't let them stop us from passing a strong bill, of course, but we might want to show a modicum of restraint in how fast and hard we push desegregation. They still command a lot of influence in the Southern States. Influence which, if we push them too hard, they might turn against our administration.\n\nWe have three drafts for consideration. All of them end the practice of segregation, ban Jim Crow laws and prohibit discrimination of Americans on the basis of color. The first of the drafts contains no further provisions. The second option aims to also empower the disenfranchised by mandating equal representation in state senates and positions and equal funding for schools. The third and most radical of the drafts aims to also counter the effects of segregation by mandating action policies for political offices, all official institutions, university admissions, and officer ranks in the military. All three options will surely anger the Nationalists, but the more radical drafts are sure to cause a much stronger reaction. How far shall we go?"

The President lightly hung up the receiver of the phone, fists balled, jaw clenched. He'd wanted to slam it down, but refused to give the corpulent old toad the satisfaction of seeing him riled.\n\nSo, that was that. After all the talks, and the schmoozing, and the gladhanding, and the endless fucking heart-rending compromises, Thurmond and his goons were just going to dig their heels in the mud and refuse to move, like an ornery camel. All that work wasted, just so the right-wingers of the party could keep their flagging dream of a segregationist future alive. So much for bipartisanship.\n\nBipartisanship. Kennedy narrowed his eyes as an idea formed. Drumming his fingers on his desk, he wondered if this was entirely wise. If he did this, he would forever alienate the rightists by cutting them out of the legislative process of his administration.\n\nEh, fuck 'em, he thought.

Why is it that in a country with the grandest skyscrapers, and all the land to build and grow communities, still have tens of thousands of homeless people? Why is it in a nation with the best schools and hospitals that even our enemies leaders send their children to study in or to have their cancers cured, have illiteracy at all or have millions dying in pain and misery?"\n\n"The simple fact is that for far too long, we have expected every American to lift themselves up, to climb up and out of the deep trench of poverty by their own merits, strengths and abilities, to join the American Dream that we all share. That system, which we call a meritocracy and take such pride in, has a great flaw though. There are some people who, no matter how hard they work, how hard the struggle, how much they save, how careful they are with their health, are struck by the misfortunes of fate, and are cast down into that pit of despair, unable to scramble out. In the White House, I receive stories like these, every day via letter and telegram, as I visit every state and city and county. It is heartbreaking to want to help those that, through little or no fault of their own, have been pushed into that trench of poverty."\n\n"So, instead I say let's help those that need it, everyone in that deep, dark hole that they were dumped into. Those that are sick, we should heal. Those that have been maimed, we should lift up. Those that are homeless, we should shelter. Those that are scraping by, we should give a helping hand. That is the goal of Social Security: providing a baseline, support for those that need it, giving every American a chance to live the dream.

True, to some of those gathered, he's a hero. But to many others, "President Strom Thurmond" is a sick joke of a phrase. And yet, there he stands, balding head gleaming under the television lights and slick with sweat.\n\nHe doesn't speak about segregation or states' rights, to the relief of the countless enemies that he's already made. He acknowledges his unelected status, he says all the important shibboleths of unity and patriotism. He eulogizes Robert Kennedy, America's latest fallen prince. Without any knowledge of who Strom Thurmond is, the casual viewer might feel confident in this new President. Their anxieties might be soothed for the moment. But to those who know of him, this is a dark night of the soul without equal.

But in order to even begin the process of expanding healthcare to more people, Bobby has to get his party onside to support him, which is easier said than done. While everyone in the party is generally in favor of increasing health spending and getting more doctors and hospitals, it's the nitty-gritty details that are causing issues that will have to be dealt with.\n\nThere are three general directions the President can go: he can pitch his idea to cover the largest number of Americans as possible, an almost fully national health system that many other nations have been establishing around the world. The problem is that some of the more radical members of the Progressive Caucus may be a bit iffy about the more vague and generalized terms, and the fact that it wouldn't be a full, government run and managed health insurance system.\n\nPresident Kennedy can also focus on specific areas of the nation that have worse health systems due to their intrinsic poverty and lack of development, such as Mississippi and Alabama. While the Nationalists will undoubtedly support this measure, the lack of support in struggling cities in the north or rapidly growing cities in the west will be seen as a slap in the face.\n\nFinally, the President can instead focus this as a civil rights issue, that this new plan will help African Americans and other marginalized peoples in the US, as they are usually denied the same health coverage and benefits that white people so easily receive. Most of the party will support this measure, though it will come at the expense of support from the Nationalists, especially the segregationists that have already made such a nuisance and fuss over schools.\n\nAll in all, there is no easy answer, but Robert Kennedy has to make a choice."

The important thing was to keep track of what you did spend it on, and at the end of every month, they would receive a phone call and envelope with a short questionnaire to fill in, to be mailed back.\n\nSoon, the rumors began to spread that the government was just giving money to random people, which quickly began to work it's way back through the political grapevine, and soon the "Citizen's Basic Income Experiment" was exposed via the Washington Post. The President has defended the program in a White House press conference, stating that the goal of the Citizen's Basic Income was to provide a baseline, guaranteed income that would help the poorest Americans make ends meet, and that it was just a year long trial to see the results.\n\nThe opposition has come from two sides: those in the Republicans and the Nationalists who denounce "government handouts" to random people, which would be incredibly expensive, especially in the light of all the other Social Security programs Bobby has been pushing. But there are some in the Progressive and Marxist caucuses who say that RFK hasn't gone far enough: he should be paying even more money, to more people, for longer.\n\nFacing this backlash, the President has to respond, and quickly."

He may see the President as not doing enough or going too slow in efforts to reform the American economy and society, and with hundreds of thousands of supporters throughout the US, but focused especially in the Southwest, his influence could sink or swim the efforts to reform America.\n\nBut the only way to get Chavez's support is to talk to him and convince him."

This is just a small step on the way to true equality and justice, but we support the President's efforts to advance our rights."\n\nThis was the best outcome possible from the meeting, as now many labor leaders among Progressive supporters are vocally supporting RFK's new acts and laws, as Chavez's full-throated endorsement is just the sign they needed."

Therefore, even before he walked out on stage to give his speech, he was discussing with advisors what to do when he was done. It was important that he got the right look, the right message across on who he would first shake hands with first, undoubtedly the most likely image to be seen tomorrow morning from coast to coast.\n\nShould he shake hands with a man in the crowd with a Nationalist button pinned to his chest, an average Joe to show that he was willing to work with his entire party? Or perhaps the head of the Cleveland chapter of the NAACP, to show the strong bond that RFK has with the African-American community? Or maybe the head of the Typographical Workers Union Local 53, which is one of the oldest unions in the city, to show solidarity with the working class?\n\nIt had been in the back of the President's mind from the moment he started his speech, and now, with fractions of a second to think, he stretches his hand out to thank..."

Everyone of us needs to pitch in to help the underprivileged and poor, the sick and broken, so that everyone can reach their full potential. For only then, when all Americans, in all 50 states, in every community great and small, help their neighbors, family and friends, can we finally defeat the disease and scourge of poverty that has plagued humanity for thousands of years."\n\n"So I call on all Americans, from New York to San Francisco, from Minneapolis to Houston, and all the points in between: your communities need you. Volunteers and donations are needed for an innumerable number of organizations tackling everything from school lunches to adult literacy to homeless shelters. Donating your time or your money, or both, is a great way to tell your community: 'We will not leave you behind. We will help you. We will keep you warm, fed and safe.'"\n\nThe applause as Bobby Kennedy finishes his speech is deafening, as he waves to the crowd and showing off his famous smile. Statistics already show that the poverty rate in America is decreasing with the boost to welfare, the support for medical services, and the improvement of labor rights. For the cherry on top, the National Progressive Pact, which is famous for not agreeing on anything, somehow has all come together to support the President's work.\n\nAll in all, a job well done."

Across the nation, children starve, workers are paid a pittance, whole communities slip through the cracks. It is imperative that we break the cycle of poverty and lift our poor and dispossessed out of that dark abyss. It is our duty, as rulers, as fellow Americans, to ensure that all our people can rise out of poverty and be provided with the opportunities they need to pursue happiness.\n\nOn his journeys across America, President Kennedy has seen poverty as no other politician has. Children starving in Mississippi, farm workers treated like slaves in California, blacks across the South living in utter destitution. He saw it all, and behind the proud faces of the men, he saw the shame, the desperation, the resignation. He saw the emptiness in the children's eyes, eyes from which the light had long ago guttered out, and thought of his own children.\n\nThose images of pain and degradation remained with him, consuming his waking thoughts, haunting his dreams. He knew he had to do something, for whenever he closed his eyes he saw those dark, shrunken faces, crying out for their saviour.\n\nBut Rome was not built in a day. The President knew to his eternal consternation that poverty was, like everything else, twisted into a political issue by the cruel vipers of Washington. The aid of Wallace and his cronies could be vital to the success of his first salvo of anti-poverty legislation, but would their support be worth the price?"

It seems that he'd prefer government revenue to gather dust in a vault somewhere, but what would be the good of that? The purpose of taxation is the funding of programs to benefit the taxpayer, and as the government of the United States it is our duty to ensure Americans have the highest quality of life possible.\n\nWe cannot let vocal and influential reactionaries prevent us from achieving a brighter future for every American.

On my travels across this great nation, the world's richest, I have seen into the abyss of poverty that so many of our brothers and sisters are born into and die in, a miasma of depression from which there is no escape, even for the willing, who are not provided the tools and resources to better their lives. It is a fallacy, too often espoused by the callous and uncaring, that people who are in poverty choose to be there, or are rightfully deprived of the means to the pursuit of happiness due to their colour, or class, or faith. When any American denies to extend a helping hand to his fellow citizen, he denies America. Some are happy to turn their heads, or to snatch crumbs out of the mouths of the hungry, but I will not stand idly by while American children starve, while American women die in childbirth, while American workers are paid too little to support their families. We are better than that. We have the means to lift every American out of the depths of poverty, and I intend to make that beautiful dream a reality. In the coming years, my administration will dedicate itself to the creation of innovative new agencies and programs to provide much-needed welfare to impoverished Americans nationwide. We shall not rest until every American is provided the means to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, those three unalienable rights that have been denied to all too many. Thank you, and God bless the United States of America."\n\nIn his darkened mansion, a man watched the President's address.

However, the reality of the divisive and fractious politics within the National Progressive Pact, especially in the Progressive faction, have been complicating matters. While they almost universally support Robert Kennedy as President, there are two wings that have their own interests and policy goals. While often allied on many issues, the few conflicting points are just that much harder to deal with.\n\nOn one hand, you have the union guys: labor leaders seeking to expand the power of workers' unions in the face of the big corporations and hostile moneyed interests, protecting and increasing the rights to collective bargaining, safer working conditions, and job security. On the other hand are the social welfare proponents: seeking to strengthen the "safety net" to catch those that fall through the cracks, tackling poverty and homelessness, and giving every American the chance to make a decent living, usually through higher taxes on the rich.\n\nThe problem is that it's damn near impossible to push both agendas at the same time, partially due to the opposition that would come from those rich and powerful fatcats that would rather keep their power over the workers and their vast fortunes away from those that need it. So that leaves the President with two options: either focus his political capital on trying to boost pensions for the public and private sector that will help unionized workers, or to increase the federal minimum wage to help those stuck on the bottom of society. While they are both good ideas, only one will be able to get through Congress easily. So who are we going to piss off this time?"

The docummenting of corruption, abuses, racism and violence by the men in blue from coast to coast has been well received and applauded by Civil Rights leaders, victims of police brutality, and those that have spent their careers trying to investigate the kickbacks, bribes, property seizures and more that happens every day, and how police unions protect bad cops and punish those that speak out. But the speech has also outrage from across the nation. Many citizens are considering what the President has said as little more than slander, painting all the cops in the nation based on a few bad apples. Police unions from New York to Los Angeles are in an uproar, denouncing the President and vowing to use their resources to support politicians that actually give a damn about the police and public safety.\n\nEven in the National Progressive Pact, RFK has received major blowback. Some in the Nationalist caucus have denounced the President, saying that he's not patriotic enough to support those that preserve law and order. Some have even shifted their loyalty from the NPP to the Republicans in response. Meanwhile, some members of the Progressive caucus, especially those that are really more concerned with the threat posed from outside the nation by Japan and fascism than with civil rights in America, are moving into the Nationalist camp, thinking that the President has gone too far. After all, police forces from the FBI to county sheriffs have been busy trying to root out the dangers of spies and agitators, and it's not helping to have their methods and motives questioned.\n\nNeedless to say, the speech may have done a lot to expose the bad aspects of the men (and the slowly increasing number of women) who police the nation and their power, but the political cost to Bobby Kennedy could have been much stronger than he could have anticipated."

Was this all there was to life?\n\nMusing over this, Beverly found herself remembering a conversation she'd had the night before with Pat, one of the other croupiers. Furtively, afraid of it somehow getting back to the bosses, Pat had told her that times were changing, that President Kennedy was on the workers' side, that they didn't have to take the bosses' shit anymore. All they had to go was organize and form a union to get the fair treatment they deserved, and the President was on their side.\n\nBeverly had never thought of herself as any kind of radical, but she was sick of living under the pit bosses' thumb, sick of never getting any time with her husband, sick of having to borrow money from her sister. She couldn't stay sunk in this quagmire. If there was a better life waiting for her, she owed it to herself to seize it.\n\nWhen the compulsive returned, he put it all on red 16. Resolving to speak with Pat before she finished her shift, Beverly spun the wheel. "Sorry, black.""

Even just a bit more a month would make a difference. Thanks to the President going quiet on labour issues, the bosses were starting to get bold.

Nevertheless, he'd joined the union, figuring that even a shred was better than nothing at all.\n\nFuelling the blaze simmering within him was the rage he felt at that grinning puk gaai President Kennedy's betrayal. Hong got his citizenship just so he could vote for Kennedy, and this was how he was repaid, by the President reneging on every promise he'd made to better the lives of the nation's workers?\n\nMercilessly carving open another salmon, Hong recalled some of his colleagues fervently discussing a meeting that was being held after work by a speaker from a leftist faction in the President's party who argued for a change in the nation's direction.

Yelling in Spanish at the top of his lungs, he told them that Chavez and his allies abhorred President Kennedy and his betrayal of the workers, that they were intent on wresting control of the party away from the two-faced gringo dogs.

As the South's golden boy, reaching a public détente with Wallace would do a lot to increase Dixie's regard for his administration.

Appearing to have reached a public concord, they could present the appearance of a united front to the voters.\n\nFacing the television cameras, the President turned on the charm and began to recite the speech that his and Wallace's writers had agreed upon the night before.

Privately, President Kennedy wondered if this was a good idea.

But there are some members of the Progressives, and even further to the left, that say the bill doesn't go far enough: there will be some, like the elderly and disabbled, who will have to jump through hoops and may struggle to get the aid they need, so the restrictions should be even further loosened, and the payments increased even more.\n\nBut over all, it seems that most congressmen were willing to support the Social Security Act, which will expand the number of people that can receive it, cut the red tape that drains so much money from a system that is supposed to help people who have fallen on hard times or those too old to work any more, and not belittle and humiliate them. The SSA, first and foremost, is to be a safety net to catch those that fall through society's cracks: the poor, the homeless, the injured, the elderly.\n\nIn a statement released to the press after the announcement of the passing of the bill, President Kennedy said that he will be signing the law tomorrow to make it law, and thanked all those that voted in favor of the act for their "...compassion, humanity, and care for the less fortunate in our nation that would otherwise be cast aside or ignored.""

"Now, I've tried to not ask for too many favors as we've worked on legislation, but this time I could really use your help to make sure this passes. So, I'm willing to compromise..."\n\n"No, Mr. President," Wallace interrupted, holding up a hand. "The Nationalist caucus will never support you."\n\nThere was a moment of silence.\n\n"Come again?"\n\n"The Nationalists will not vote in favor of the National Healthcare Act. This bill is a travesty, just another of your big government, bloated bureaucracy, tax raising pinko commie schemes. There is nothing that you can give us to convince me to tell my people to vote in favor of it. You've burnt too many bridges, gone too liberal, ignored any constructive criticism that has been raised, all to pass your socialist agenda through Congress. We will never support this bill."\n\nBobby was stunned. He had spent days with advisors, trying to guess what could be compromised on the NHA, what had to be retained at all costs, and how flexible they could be to negotiate with Wallace... and here he was, rejecting the whole thing out of hand. The President took a breath to regain his composure, and gave a solemn, grimacing nod of his head. "If that's your opinion on the matter, then so be it.""

### Scoopy

A rabid anti-extremist, Scoop, in more than 30 years of politics, has continually carried a torch of progress while refusing to give in to the draw of the far-left elements of the NPP. Scoop has always termed himself an American first and a progressive second. Every decision he has taken was done so with the well-being of the American people at the forefront of his mind.\n\nHowever, his fervent anti-extremism borders on extremism in and of itself. He despises the communists of the Marxist Caucus and the Sovereigntists, to the point where he has campaigned on a seemingly anti-democratic platform of banning the two parties. His populist, progressive, and moderate political positions give him a unique standing that echoes the progressivism of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nNow President, Jackson stands in a position from which he can achieve the dreams that he has proclaimed for more than 30 years: liberty, equality, and civility. In one fell swoop he may be able to remove the ANV and Marxists from American politics forever, passing landmark civil rights bills and other progressive legislation, and drawing a hard line in the sand for both the Empire and the Reich to fear."

 #Harrington

 #Leader Desc
 POLITICS_HAR_DESC:0 "Michael Harrington was born in St. Louis to a Catholic family in the beginning of 1928. Growing up, he attended Catholic schools and inherited conservative views from his parents. However, while studying at Yale and the University of Chicago, he began taking on Christian views that advocated for social and economic progressivism, opposing what he saw as the exploitation of the common American by capitalism. This approach, which was notably anti-collectivist, inspired him to join the Catholic Worker movement and write about politics. After the war ended, he was disgusted with the Catholic Worker and it's apparent ignorance of the threat of fascism. Seeing the need to join more radical groups, he joined up with Trotskyist Max Shachtman, leader of a virulently anti-Bukharinist and anti-fascist group.\n\nHarrington continued to shift farther left, while retaining his opposition to strict collectivization. By the late 1950's, his strong views on civil rights as well as his distaste for the increasingly authoritarian Socialist Party of America led him to join the rising National Progressive Pact. Now, as President of the United States, Michael Harrington advocates for his own take on Democratic Socialism, one of liberation and freedom, both economic and social, for all."

 USA_har_68_harrington_presidency_desc:0 "They said it couldn't be done, but for the first time in American history, a self-declared socialist (even if some in his pact disagree) has been elected to the White House. Michael Edward Harrington Jr, center-left firebrand of the NPP, was raised to the Highest Office on a platform of workers' rights, progressive legislative reform and what Harrington describes as a "Fight for the Poor", a comprehensive assault on the poverty and lack of institutional support faced by many of America's faceless poor.\n\nThe latter will involve comprehensive welfarist legislation on a scale unseen in American politics. Unemployment funds, veteran pensions and assistance for the handicapped and aged have polled well with audiences, and will likely be keystones of the Harrington agenda.\n\nThis root and branch reform is expected to consume the majority of the President's term in office and will face stiff opposition from Harrington's many political enemies, including many from within his own pact's conservative and radical right-wing faction. But if the earnest young ex-Catholic knows anything at all, it's how to wage a just war - and this war will be the most righteous of all."

The Beltway is full of those who would deride and oppose his efforts to bring reform to the systems that shelter them; in a coordinated mix of meetings and speeches, Harrington intends to make it clear that the lobbyists, cronies and career politicians choking America will be shown no quarter in his efforts to save it. Class privilege, money politics, the wealthy elite; everything will have to go. There will be no sacred cows left untouched in the pursuit of justice for the American people.\n\nIn this, Harrington will be met halfway by those loyal to his cause in his pact. A slew of proposals regarding radical reforms to judicial terms, healthcare and pension reform are already being drafted by NPP Marxists and moderate members, blowing the winds of change all the way to the Capitol Hill. Of course, he could also use this as a method of parsing support for his programmes and policies within the RDC front; for enemies are best kept closer than friends, especially ones who happen to agree with you..."

His policies will target the weak, vulnerable and faceless of American society, the "other America", and to drum up support from restive urban Evangelicals and religious ruralites Harrington has emphasized the essential continuity of welfarism with the teachings of the Bible and human decency. The aim is to make the hand of the state benign to the American mind, drawing from the Social Gospel of earlier decades to do so.\n\nOf course, this morality will serve a somewhat less innocent role in pinpointing potential sources of support for the planned legislative reforms being drawn up in NPP Progressives headquarters, and certainly might help in easing some of the more aggressive policies we have planned under the noses of voters. The American people know better than to look a gift horse in the mouth; and this horse now rides with the Eagle and the Cross, bright enough to blind any stray eyes that might wander too near."

Behind every threat, however, stands an opportunity; if we make efforts to ensure the Pact stands together, we might find ourselves better-positioned to push legislature through in the halls of power. Intimidation and threats of expulsion from the Pact might convince the majority to toe the Party line, and talks with Wallace and Thurmond will help ensure the major power brokers in our own pact stay loyal.\n\nAfter all, wasn't it Lincoln who said that a house divided cannot stand? We might have to promise dilution of some of our most incendiary reforms in the bargain, and our own support base won't be happy about this, but unity comes at a cost, and the NPP can't afford to sacrifice its legislative power on the altar of ideological purity..."

Through the tireless work of Harrington, Scoop and, oddly enough, the cautious support of some of our own radical leftists, a party line is being forged that stands a chance of holding against what is sure to be a savage partisan assault on the progressive agenda.\n\nNow all that remains is to consolidate our gains and declare the triumph of the Pact, and push on with our reforms, albeit in a limited form. Our ability to keep a consensus running amidst what some have described as "political schizophrenia" will surely be hailed as a great work of political maneuvering; only time will tell if it will be enough. No one knows how the RDC will react to a united NPP, of course, but the sheer weight of support for the bill might entice establishment mavericks to jump on the bandwagon."

It simply wouldn't do to neglect such a valuable source of political capital, and nothing gets the American people cheering faster than a rare display of cross-aisle unity.\n\nMeetings between Lyndon Johnson, Congressman Rusk and Harrington's staff will begin this process of reconciliation. The Pact Rightists are likely to be inflamed by this "selling out to the Establishment", and no one knows how far Party unity can be pushed, but reform comes at a cost, and the Progressive movement can't afford to sacrifice its ideals on the altar of political expediency..."

The fact that neither side agrees on precisely what those reforms will entail only adds to the mystique surrounding this sudden bipartisan shift.\n\nThe next logical step would be to make what is already obvious public knowledge: by consolidating the support of what some are describing as the "Newer Dealers", Harrington's circle will be able to force a confrontation with the conservatives in the NPP, but on his terms. Bipartisan support will prove a powerful intimidating factor for diehard opponents in Pact Right, and might convince them to reach some form of consensus with the administration at large."

Harrington plans to announce his plans for comprehensive legislative welfare on the steps of the Capitol, in a speech that will be open to the American people and broadcast on all major networks. The popular support we will gather will be critical to mustering support against a conservative establishment hotly opposed to "big government" intervention, and sweeping aside any of our own pact with personal reservations on the programme.\n\nIt will also act as a decision point for many of the political figures who have remained indecisive in their support for our programmes; by forcing them to take a stance for or against the Fight, we will bring their real sympathies and prejudices into the light of day. Our own advisers suggest that this will work to our advantage. It will be considerably more difficult to predict how this will affect an already polarized political atmosphere, but given our prior efforts to secure support on the Hill, we are likely to carry the day."

It is time to meet with stakeholders whose help will be invaluable in getting our planned reforms passed, and to thank the movements which supported us. It is not lost on us, of course, that these movements expect concrete policy measures that benefit their causes in return for their support.\n\nHarrington's aims to conduct a series of widely publicised policy debate meetings with prominent figures in the Progressive "front" from trade unions to senators, solidifying their support for our cause while assuring them that their needs will be met in our subsequent legislation through debate over our planned programmes. While this might be seen as a faintly elitist gesture by the common citizen, it will certainly do much to aid our internal efforts to push our reforms into law, and results are what the American people need right now."

Meetings with the leaders of the AFL-CIO and the influential Brotherhood of Teamsters, as well as leaders from our own government's public sector unions, will assure the labor movement of Harrington's support, and provide a platform for valuable discussion on Harrington's increasingly public workplace rights policy agenda.\n\nThis is not going to come without its challenges, however; the labor movement is known for its socialist tendencies and our association with them could risk alienating the more conservative parts of our already fragile voter base. Pundits threaten economic disaster if we allow the power of unions to run roughshod over the market.

The co-option of his base to our own could prove a powerful statement to the labor movement in America, as well as a personal moral victory for the unabashedly pro-worker Harrington over the establishment he despises. The plan outlined in the Oval Office is to meet with him first privately and then in public with his fellow Farm Workers' Union heads, assuring him of our support.\n\nIt will be difficult to placate an already worried America about the nature of the talks, of course, and many on the airwaves are already railing against the "Red takeover of America" implied by such a bold move by the POTUS, but Harrington built his campaign on the promise that he would not forget the poor, and promises are the lifeline of politicians in America."

It's high time we began talks with the Senate powerbrokers to ensure a favourable outcome to our proposed bills - at least on paper. Senators Lyndon Johnson and McGovern on the RDC side of the aisle are difficult to work with and it's likely we'll have to smooth over many of our personal grievances to make a deal with them viable, but they seem to be the best option we have to reach a divided Congress.\n\nHarrington's plan is this; to emphasise the "unity" of the New Progressive Movement, he will lead closed-door talks with LBJ, McGovern and other RDC senators, smooth out the...kinks in our relationship, and leave arm in arm with the Senate in his pocket. Some of our own in the Progressive say this plan is wildly optimistic and might leave us prone to attack by the fringes of our movement, but it seems like the best opportunity we have to sway the halls of power to our side - and inaction is something we simply can't afford."

The associations of the movement have links to the labor unions and our own NPP Progressives organizations, but cutting out the middlemen and meeting them directly might prove to be the catalyst for a closer relationship. As a representative of the interests of the people, these organizations are our best bet for reaching the common man directly, outside politics and the workplace.\n\nThis should be fairly easy to accomplish in theory, but as with everything else there are complications in practice; who do we meet and what do we prioritise?

Whether we follow this up with said reforms is up to the administration at large, but a sizeable minority of the Progressive are against further strains on an already ballooning legislative agenda, and our political capital grows more fragile by the day.

More pragmatically, he will promise increased spending on education and infrastructure for America's rural stragglers, and even an expansion of farming subsidies to ease the burden of America's breadbasket.

For this term, the President intends to focus on healthcare and education; no longer shall the American have to pay for his poverty with his lifespan and the lives of his children! We will lessen the burden of the poor and bring the underprivileged American household into the light, where it will stand as a testament to the American dream; one nation, just, equal, with true freedom for all.\n\nProposals both old and new are floating around the Administration; plans for extending medical care to all Americans, comprehensive wealth reform, vague plans to reduce racial bias.

After all, poverty is a socioeconomic condition, not an original sin. And if the fathers are innocent, what of the sons?\n\nFor reform to take place, we must look at the situation with a clear eye.

If we are to make American education equal, we must chart the width of these divides and quantify them, no matter how disturbing the task may be.\n\nA nationwide survey of schools will be conducted, using random surveys of teachers and students to gauge confidence in the schooling system and its ability to distribute equal attention across states and districts.

Yet, he may well have been denied access to elite private education as a youth due to poverty stemming from centuries of racial oppression, while his white counterparts were not. Even with legal equality, the halls of power and privilege in America still bear implicit signs marked "Whites Only." But the PCRI has developed a radical solution to this problem...\n\nThe PCRI has proposed that we move away from legal equality, and towards "social equity": Taking affirmative actions to raise the other America up to equal social standing with Whites. We will offer them improved access to universities, jobs, and even promotions in the army. This will be the only way to truly heal America's racial divide.

The flip side of that coin, however, is that Americans are not very fond of taxes. It's a delicate balancing act; new programs are generally supported, but new taxes are reviled. However, with the experts in the Harrington Administration, we can surely walk that line, so less fortunate Americans are protected, and the quiet grumbles of more fortunate Americans stay quiet."

 USA_har_68_drawing_up_a_budget_desc:0 "With some major questions settled, it's time to actually create a formal budget proposal. This is our opportunity to really show the American people our priorities. With this budget, we can now put our money where our mouth is, as it were."
 USA_har_68_social_security:0 "[Root.GetHAR_social_security_bill]"
 USA_har_68_social_security_desc:0 "The unemployment benefits program is a great start to securing a better future for Americans, but maybe it needs to be expanded into a larger "social security" program in order to more comprehensively assist more Americans to get what they really need. Presidential nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a similar program back in the 30s, and while he was unsuccessful in securing the presidency, the people have chosen President Harrington, which means that America is clearly ready to try the "social security" idea."

 USA_har_68_pushing_the_businesses_desc:0 "Some American businesses haven't been too happy about the new push towards better working conditions. They talk about profit margins, and Atlas Shrugged, and bureaucracy. The simple fact of the matter is that they will continue to grumble and argue for the foreseeable future, and we must apply some pressure to make sure all of America's workers are getting the solid deal we promised them."

In order to pass, the bill had to be cut down, and while it is a good baseline, it simply doesn't go far enough to help American workers. We must go back in and use any spare political capital to amend the FLSA to give real assistance to the working man."
 USA_har_68_working_to_solve_poverty:0 "Working to Solve Poverty"
 USA_har_68_working_to_solve_poverty_desc:0 "The symptoms have been treated. Any man can tell you the worst part of a fever is the terrible fatigue that leaves him stricken in bed, unable to eat or to laugh or to do the things a healthy man can. Just as it is with poverty, where gnawing hunger and the listlessness of unemployment leave a man just as stricken. Now, thanks to Harrington's policies, even the lowliest man can be assured that he can eat and have a reasonable chance of picking himself up.\n\nThe systems we have established should ensure that the symptoms of poverty continue to be treated for the foreseeable future. In time, the true elimination of the causes of hunger and woe should be properly addressed, but for now the poor man can rest easy."

 USA_har_68_an_america_for_all_desc:0 "With the end of his second term drawing near, Harrington intends to once and for all define the legacy he shall leave to America. Over the last few years, the NPP has fought hard for racial equality and economic mobility for all Americans, and the President means to ensure that this ethos is maintained past his time in office.\n\nTo this end, he intends to give one of his last speeches as President at the University of Chicago, where he studied long ago. As he gives his blessing to the graduating Class of '73, he will inspire them, and hopefully all the young minds of America, with the promise of a better future that all should seek to strive for."
 USA_har_68_an_end_to_poverty:0 "An End to Poverty"
 USA_har_68_an_end_to_poverty_desc:0 "If there is one legacy future historians will attribute to President Harrington, it will be the end of the curse of poverty afflicting the lives of American citizens. Though it may still exist and continue to do so, our citizens can rest assured that poverty is no longer a pit without escape, but a simple bump in the road on the path to the American Dream. With all afforded the right to healthcare in times of illness, food in times of need, freedom from racial prejudice and ready access to work and education, ascending from the darkness needn't be a Sisyphean task any longer.\n\nThe time approaches for a new President, but the efforts Harrington has made will not be in vain. America can move on into the future as one society, undivided by wealth or opportunity. In time, this may be seen as the moment that America truly fulfilled its reputation as a land where anyone can make it to greatness."

 harrington.2.desc:0 "President Michael Harrington stood in the Oval Office, scratching his chin, ruminating the day's events, as well as his plans for the future. When he had come into the presidency, he had campaigned on party unity heavily, trying to inextricably tie the groups such as the Nationalists to the Progressives. It was unlikely to ever work, and it was very difficult so far. Strom and his cronies had trouble cooperating with anyone, the stubborn bastards, and the future of the NPP seemed in question.\nRepublicans or the Right, that was the question. Should he pick the Republicans, it could possibly dissolve the NPP as a whole; the "big tent" would be set on fire, so to speak. Regardless, a decision had to be made. Harrington picked up the phone to his personal assistant. "Francine," he said, "I'd like to schedule a meeting with Strom Thurmond.""

"You've got to be out of your goddamn mind," he said, "you're too out there for us, and for our supporters, Harrington. You really think we'll all just roll over for socialism? Hell, why not declare Debs one of the founding fathers? Carve his face into Rushmore and hail the People's Republic of America?"\nHarrington, sitting opposite Byrd, took a sip from his coffee mug. "I think, perhaps, you are being hyperbolic."\n"Hyperbolic!" interjected Strom Thurmond, "You're one step away from a goddamn communist!"\nMargaret Chase Smith leaned forward, looking at the President. "Listen, Mister President," she began, "understand our position: our supporters and your supporters are totally distinct groups. We need a good reason to give our support to you."\nHarrington kicked back in his chair, eyeing the men and woman opposite him. "Well, what can I do?"\n"Resignation and suicide seem obvious choices," deadpanned Thurmond.\nSmith rolled her eyes. "A fully anti-Japan stance," she said, "Saber rattling, military funding; anything to piss off the Japanese. That, and hold back on some of the more radical elements of your platform, like a universal basic income. That would probably calm down some of our voters."\nHarrington rubbed his eyes, sighing. There could be no victory without sacrifice, in the end. "Alright," he said, "I can work with that.""

"You've asked me that several times already," he said, "my answer's the same: go with the Nationalists. We're already radical enough in their eyes, if we don't at least make a gesture of getting along, the entire National Progressive Pact might just collapse away into dust."\nHarrington sighed, "the more I ask you that the less confident I am that it's the right choice."\n"Then why ask me? Listen, Strom and Byrd would absolutely rally behind you if we-"\n"If we what?" Harrington interrupted, "If we gave up on our campaign promises, you mean. Even then, Byrd would be a hard sell, and Thurmond's not even worth trying."\n"Don't give up on him so easily," Howe replied, "he's a dog with no bite. Throw him a bone and he won't even bark."\n"The man said he'd 'sooner be in Tokyo with Tojo than in Hell with Harrington'. The Nationalists- and Thurmond- are a no-go."\n"So," Howe began, "Republicans it is, then."\n"Republicans it is," agreed Harrington, reaching over to the phone. There was a meeting that needed to be called."

 harrington.5.t:0 "A Foregone Conclusion"
 harrington.5.desc:0 "Michael Harrington sat at the head of the long meeting table. Exquisite mahogany, carved, and surrounded by what must have been a little over a baker's dozen of politicians he all knew by name. McGovern, Dole, Rumsfeld, McNamara, Gore, Rockefeller, Ford, and several others. "So, gentlemen," Harrington began, "I've brought you all here today because I believe we share common interests, and may work together for those interests. I am officially asking for the support of the Republican-Democratic coalition going forward. Our administration needs more support to pass its legislation through Congress, and I am of the belief that an agreement between our two parties may be reached."\n"So what do you want us to do?" replied George McGovern, "I'd be willing but I won't just blindly follow you."\n"Think of it more as a bipartisan agreement for the common good," said Harrington.\n"Absolutely not," interjected McNamara, "you really think our party would rally behind you? When I tell this to the Democrats in Congress it won't be pretty."\nDole was the next to speak, "hey, now, let's not be too hasty. Yes, the President here might have a few radical ideas but we could get some serious legislation passed with this alliance."\nSeveral murmurs of approval went up around the Republican side of the table, but the few Democrats remained silent until Donald Rumsfeld stood up. "Listen to yourselves! You'd rather break up the coalition for some progressive pipe dream than focus on what really matters? I won't add any more fuel to this fire. Goodbye."\nWith that, he stood and walked out of the room, followed by McNamara and an inconsequential senator whom Harrington couldn't remember the name of. "Let them go," said Bob Dole, "they'll come around sometime or another. Mister President, I'm all for this alliance. Despite your more radical policies, I have great respect for you and your dedication to the well being of America. However, I'm not so sure my compatriots have such convictions. Please, give us a few minutes to discuss this."\nHarrington obligingly left the room, checking his watch every minute or so. Two minutes, four minutes, seven minutes, nine. It went on and on and on until suddenly the conference room door gently opened, with the entourage of Republicans filing out. Bob Dole stopped and looked at the President, nodding gently."

 harrington.6.t:0 "Polarized"
 harrington.6.desc:0 "In recent weeks, several of the Nationalist wing of the National Progressive Pact have officially walked across the aisle and joined the Democratic Party. In addition, the Democrats have decidedly grown closer to the Nationalists in response. It appears that this sudden, extreme action is in response to a conference held between leaders of the Republican-Democratic Coalition and the Harrington Administration, in which the Republicans and the President agreed to work together. The few Democrats invited to the meeting, including Robert McNamara and Donald Rumsfeld, quickly left after they claimed the President was not interested in making compromises.\n\nThe new alliance between the Republicans and the Progressives is already visible in Congress, with the two groups voting almost unanimously on their legislative proposals. A fiery speech given by Strom Thurmond in the most recent Senate vote showed just how far the NPP has split over this issue, with Thurmond calling the President a "traitor to the party". Despite the large political shakeup, and the new counter-alliance seemingly between the Nationalists and the Democrats, it appears that most poor and middle class Americans are warming up to the Harrington Administration. The same however, cannot be said for their wealthier employers, who stand to lose millions from the President's social programs."

 harrington.7.t:0 "Harrington People's Tour"
 harrington.7.desc:0 "President Harrington has become increasingly tired with the inflexibility of the Senate. Passing his reforms in the Congress turned to be a very difficult task, encountering the inflexibility of the conservatives and even the moderates. So he decided that instead of dealing with an increasingly hostile Congress he would go back to his roots. A tour across the country will be organized to talk to the common folk and listen to their problems. This will allow to create popular support for his Progressive agenda and improve his image among those communities more hostile to him.\n\nThe reactions to the so called People's Path were mixed. Progressives applauded the President's decision of staying true to his ideals of being the "People's President" and they hope this tour can gain sympathy for the progressive cause. Some moderates sympathetic to Harrington's program voiced their concern about the project, arguing that the President should stay in Washington to focus on passing his reforms and deal with other problems. Non-progressives were more critical about it, defining the entire thing as nothing but a vanity project. Some conservatives went so far as to call the tour an attempt to "create a socialist personality cult".\n\nHarrington ignored the critiques and focused on organizing his ambitious tour. After all, these people bothered to put him in the White House. Why not return the favor?"

 harrington.8.t:0 "Harrington Addresses the Poor"
 harrington.8.desc:0 "President Harrington made a stop at one of the many charity centers of New York City to address the poor and the helpless. Harrington felt confident in his ability to speak to the poor: all those years of activism on his youth weren't in vain. "Look, fellas. I'm not here to make a campaign or anything like that. There are no journalists, no photographers and not even bodyguards" Harrington wasn't entirely honest with that one: they were two members of the Secret Service infiltrated inside the crowd to avoid any lunatic doing something funny. "I'm not gonna tell you "vote for me" or any of that political crap. You tell me your names and I'm gonna sit on this chair and just listen to what you have to say."\n\nAt the exact moment that Harrington sat on the chair, a hundred hands raised up and the entire room filled with the voices of dozens of people. "One at the time, please" requested Harrington. A crippled man with a long beard went first: "I'm Jack. I lost a leg fighting the Nazis in Wales. They rewarded me by screwing my fucking pension. I've been homeless for ten years." Another woman with small children on her lap was next: "I'm Brenda. My landlord expelled me and my kids from my house. I don't know what do." Then, a young black man: "I'm Terry. I'm a drug addict in recovery. People refuse to hire me and call me names on the street. I feel like I can't change anything." Every single one of the seventy souls inside the room started to tell their stories for the next two hours.\n\nHarrington was out for words at first but he finally got up from the chair to deliver an answer. "This is outrageous. How can people suffer like this in the richest country on Earth? I'm gonna do everything I can to solve this and I'll resign in shame if I can't change anything!" The entire room cheered him, as Harrington thanked the people for his support. Local newspapers tracked the people on the meetings weeks later, reporting that their situations have improved a lot since then. President Harrington's approval ratings went through the roof in New York, with a similar result in other big urban centers."
 harrington.8.a:0 "The poor won't be left alone ever again"
 harrington.9.t:0 "Harrington Addresses the Middle Class"
 harrington.9.desc:0 "After leaving behind the big urban centers behind, Harrington wanted to address the middle classes to further push his progressive agenda. This stop in particular was particularly com: a community in Florida filled with conservative middle-aged people, a place where Harrington is really unpopular. The speech was nothing special with Harrington talking about the importance of helping fellow citizens, specially the poor. Some voices of disapproval could be heard when Harrington talked about the importance of everyone doing their part to end poverty as it was interpreted as an attempt to raise taxes. The interesting part came when Harrington announced that he would be taking questions from the crowd. His aides warned him that it was a risky strategy: if the discussion gets heated, the right-wing press was going to eat him alive.\n\nFortunately, Harrington was ready for that. The questions were mostly conservative talking points that he already heard a million times, so he had no problem answering then. However, the moment that most resonated from the event was the exchange that the President had with one person in particular. An elderly man wearing a cross-shaped necklace asked: "Why should I give my hard working money to lazy people that don't contribute anything to society, Mr President?"\n\nHarrington decided to make a gamble with his response. "I have noticed that you are a Christian, isn't it?" The man nodded proudly. "Well, while I admit I'm not a big religious person myself, I'm a bit familiar with Jesus's teachings. Didn't Jesus talked about the necessity of having compassion and pity for the poor? And knowing what he did with the merchants at the temple, I don't think he was very fond of the invisible hand of the free market." Harrington exclaimed. The reaction was mixed, with some outright booing the President but others laughing a bit. Conservative newspapers fiercely criticized the President for using Jesus to "push his heretic communist agenda", but the liberal media celebrated Harrington's witty comments on religion. The President is sure he made a good impression."

 harrington.10.desc:0 "Harrington's next stop on his People's Tour was the rural communities on the countryside. A good chunk of the rural farmers of the Rust Belt supported Harrington, so now he has to prove them that he is willing to support his campaign promises. Harrington addressed a group of corn farmers in Iowa to talk about the necessity of investing in the rural industry. He promised that more funding will be invested in subsiding the farms, improving infrastructure and creating new schools across the state. "Agriculture is one of the main cores of America, so it would an injustice to leave you behind just like that." In what was already a recurring trope for Harrington's tour, a voice could be heard from behind the crowd. "I voted for you and now my crops are fucked, you asshole."\n\nThe Secret Service was ready to push the troublemaker out of the crowd when Harrington ordered them to stop. "Do you want to come here to talk about it? Seriously, I'm interested" Harrington exclaimed. The farmer eventually arrived to the podium and the President asked what his problem was "Those rats just fucked my entire harvest and now I don't have a penny. What am I supposed to do?" Harrington thought about it for a few seconds and eventually delivered an answer. "Those who have the same problem right now, rise your hands" At least a third of the people present raised their hands. "Well, I didn't see the rat infestation coming, but that's not excuse. Not only am I going to invest in better pesticides, but also compensate those farmers that lose their crops. What do you think?" Harrington exclaimed extending his hand. The farmer smiled and shook Harrington's hand with satisfaction "That sounds like a pretty good deal!" The event made a really good impression on the rural regions, guaranteeing a solid support base for future reforms."

 harrington.11.t:0 "Harrington Addresses the Rich"
 harrington.11.desc:0 "Harrington's last stop on his People's Path was the hardest of all. Harrington's final obstacle was the people he fought his entire life: the rich. His objective is to ensure support for his ambitious program of expansion of funding for small and medium farmers. He managed to pressure some of the Governors of the Rust Belt to help him, but now he needs the support of the most powerful rural and manufacturer businessmen in the country. A reunion was planned in Washington to address the issue, where Harrington had to negotiate with his mortal enemies for hours.\n\nThe fat cats started to talk first. "With all due respect, Mr President your actions have greatly affected our interests" a man with a cigar exclaimed. "Your aggressive rhetoric only alienates our good will to negotiate. My associates and I want to make sure that this deal will be beneficial to us." another bald executive said. Harrington immediately fired back. "Gentlemen, this can end in two ways. We associate in this project, improving your profits and we both benefit from it or we do nothing, the farmers suffer and you lose your chance for a good business. I'm open to negotiation, but I also need your compromise." The executives were actually surprised that Harrington was willing to listen to their demands to come to an agreement. Maybe that pesky Socialist is not that dumb after all.\n\nAfter hours of negotiation and deliberating the details, the businessmen accepted moderate support for Harrington's project. "Well, Mr President my colleagues and I decided to support your project. We are confident that this partnership could benefit both parts. However, we also hope that you will respect our interests the same way we respect yours. Have a nice day." Harrington now needs to work on the bills, but after such a long tour through the country and dealing with the bourgeoisie he decided to take a few days to rest first."

 harrington.12.desc:0 "In recent weeks, dozens of Nationalist politicians of the National Progressive Pact have come out in support of President Michael Harrington, capped off today by Robert Byrd and Margaret Chase Smith announcing that the Nationalist caucus is now standing fully behind the President and his policies. This comes as a surprising announcement to the nation, especially Nationalist voters, who voted in strongly against the progressive candidate last November. Byrd himself even said that he would sooner join the Republicans than see Harrington- whom he called a communist- in office.\nNow however, the political situation appears to have shifted in favor of the Progressives, with the Nationalists voting along in their most recent piece of legislation. Not all on the Nationalist caucus appear to have caved, with several Congressmen and politicians continuing to vehemently oppose the current administration. This group notably includes Senator Strom Thurmond, who had this to say: "I don't know what my party is doing, siding with a godless Bolshevik like our current President. It saddens and angers me, and I will not give in to the tyranny of the majority; I will continue to fight for what's best for America."\nRegardless of the outliers, it appears that most of the Nationalist wing is now cooperating with the Harrington Administration, and their voters appear likely to follow suit. How President Harrington was able to garner the support of a faction that has been strongly opposed to him in the past remains unknown, but a deal was likely made; one that may require the breaking of the President's campaign promises."

And everybody will be needed to mobilize voters, antagonize fence-sitting legislators, turn out to protest in favor of the administration, and help construct a coalition that the President can rely on. Some will certainly find it distasteful, but the Harrington administration represents the best chance for radical material gain in the history of the American left.

Plenty of unions, spearheaded by the Reuther brothers' United Auto Workers, threw their whole weight behind the Harrington campaign. But others, like the IBEW, UMWA, and SMWIA, all have leadership that is much more suspicious of the President. Many of them have powerful machines that the NPP's political efforts rely upon, which they are loath to give up and which we would regret crossing.\n\nThere are a number of ways we could deal with America's unions, but they pretty much boil down to two major options. On one hand, we could bank on the UAW and other progressive unions to give us more of their support. They're more ideologically aligned with us, and are more reliable, especially in the North, but there may be backlash from moderates elsewhere in the country, which could bode poorly for our future efforts. On the other hand, we could reach out to more moderate unions, and calm their worries about our administration. However, it's unlikely that we have the time or the political capital to address both."

The United Farm Workers had been harrying agriculture tycoons across the Southwest for years, and their brand of grassroots labor organizing appealed to the White House. They would be valuable allies, if Harrington could convince them.\n\nCesar Chavez's eyes never looked away from Harrington's. Chavez looked kind and understanding, and he was, but he was weighing and balancing every word the President said. Every now and again, he looked to Dolores Huerta, the master of outreach and organizing, gauging her expression. They both heard the President say the right things, about what the DOJ and congressional allies could do, about how much he admired their efforts and principles. He made commitments to investigate abuse and mismanagement.\n\nAnd after two hours, Chavez and Huerta nodded."

The Centrist NPP legislators who form our base of support have generally been supportive, although we've received more than one exhortation to "be careful". The Nationalists, on the other hand, have been even more livid than usual. They see it as a betrayal of the party, and of the principles that we all ostensibly share. At least one of the staffers manning the phones in the West Wing has broken down in the bathroom after the third expletive-laced rant from a member of the Alabama congressional delegation.

But at the same time, many of the planes that flattened Windhoek, or which sit on Icelandic airstrips, were built in his home state of Washington. He's a progressive, yes, but also one with a strong pro-war streak. And he's a reliable, if occasionally critical, backer of the administration. This makes him the perfect candidate for a congressional go-between. One of our Legislative Affairs staffers, a bright young South Africa vet named Perry Bullard, has already been meeting in secret with some of Jackson's staffers. Hopefully, this strategy will secure our base of support, and keep the NPP, however shakily, on our side."

You didn't expect to hear a drawn-out explanation of Marxist dialectic and historical materialism. After about twenty minutes of that, President Harrington stared across the Resolute Desk. "Get on with it", his look seemed to say. Gus halted. There was a gulf between them. However committed they both were to a better future, Hall had studied at Bukharin's schools, and Harrington had protested Bukharin's government.\n\nHall began to speak again.\n\n"Mr. President, we do represent a number of interests that are vital for NPP political success in the future. The students, the radical unions, and so forth. But we need your backing in turn. I've been on the receiving end of plenty of federal violence. Trust me, I know what this office is capable of.

Henry Jackson of Washington has publicized a congressional resolution to formally state that "known bomb-throwers like Gus Hall have no place in the important work of American governance".

President Harrington was always happiest in spaces like this, full of people fighting for a more just world. He just wasn't used to having everybody's undivided attention. They all spoke frankly. It was refreshing, hearing about the struggles of activists, instead of fighting with Washington bureaucrats and pork-shovelers. One of the activists, a young graduate of Mount Holyoke who had worked to desegregate her school back in '65, stood up and spoke for the better part of half an hour, picking apart America's foundations with the skill of a surgeon.\n\nAfter the meeting, outside the library, a professor from MIT asked for her name.

Based on how it was written, it's clear that said list was written by someone in contact with the White House previously, and that they're a member in good standing of the NPP's Nationalist faction. Every news agency worth their salt is digging for more information. Who is this "Forrest Carter" person? How did they get so close to the administration? One thing is certain, though. The White House is trying to forge an alliance with the Nationalists, in spite of the vast political gulf between them.

With every thought came another pen stroke, another massive change to the face of American life. Nevertheless, while hope pranced through the President's mind, the constant thoughts of a snake in the grass lied in the background. These thoughts persisted until the President's work was interrupted with some soft knocking at his door. Getting up to answer, President Harrington was greeted by Vice President Howe, who received a pat on the back from Harrington as he said "Irving, you surprised me! Come, sit down, I wanted to look at that report you told me about." With a smile, Howe and the President sat around his desk.\n\n"Michael, I have to admit, it's hard to imagine all those out there that get affected by this work. You're non-stop, you know that?" Irving asked, before setting a manilla folder onto the President's desk. Harrington flipped open the folder to peer into the reports laid inside. Reports, graphics, and measurements, all of which showed another slither of what lies in the grass: former southern Progressive members defecting to the Nationalist branch of the NPP or even the Republicans. One paragraph noted that the words "chaotic" and "exhausting" had been one of the most common trends in phone polling in regards to the fitting words describing the Presidential administration according to the American public.\n\nThe reactions of the United States provided concern, but he knew this wasn't the end. "Well, nothing like a morning filled with reports of defection." Harrington said, rubbing his chin. "Well, Mike, you know one concrete fact as well as anyone after all these years: people don't like change. Like ripping the band-aid off a papercut, you know?" Irving said with a bit of a chuckle. Harrington sat back in his chair as he reviewed the reports again. "You know, us two have probably dealt with more papercuts than any of these people, what a way to throw a fit, right?" the President said, compelling the Vice President to offer a few more bits of laughter in regards to the happiness of the President. "Don't worry, we'll get through this, if we got to the Presidency, we can get through anything they want to throw at us, right?" Harrington asked, offering his hand. The Vice President responded with a handshake before leaving the Oval Office."

Yet even so, for one of the first times in his life, that snake continued to crawl into the President's optimism. Harrington finally put his pen down and offered a small chuckle, saying, "People, fickle, huh?" before chuckling a bit more. Yet, as the President took some time for himself, work always seemed to find him as another set of knocks rang against the door of the Oval Office.\n\n"What's it look like out there on the front lines, Irving?" Harrington asked, as Vice President Howe stepped forward. Irving offered a smile and a handshake in return "Well, uh, Michael, another report came in about the defections in the South, a followup from the other day." He said, unveiling another set of reports. President Harrington took a while to carefully read through the set of paperwork, and once again, new punches thrown at his optimism came with every page. The numbers were accurate, as bases of his support continued to make moves towards joining the Republicans and the Nationalists of the NPP. A bit of confusion filled him upon seeing a new growth of defections in the Rockies rather than the South. And a bit of shock came as he saw that some had reported their "tiredness" bringing them towards the Left of the NPP and the Sovereigns on the other side. "What... what's going on, Irving?" the President, sounding a bit beat up, bit still cheery. The Vice President took a few seconds for the President to get his worries out before speaking, saying "Michael, you and I have worked a long time to get people to sympathize with the Progressive movement. But what's one of the biggest responses we always got whenever we made a speech or published an article?"\n\nThe President took a few slow breaths before responding, working towards building up his cheeriness once more as he thought of the years that had flown by alongside his best friend, Howe himself. Of the battles fought, and the victories one alongside one another."

The aching feeling shook the man to his core, and yet, Michael Harrington could not bear to turn away from the thoughts plaguing him. Originally, he could offer some understanding towards the citizens' concern for the rapid change, even if it helped them, because hey, change can be difficult. But now, concern has seemingly transformed into daggers launching into the President's back.\n\nHarrington watched onward as news had already predatorized the entire affair revolving around the divisions beginning to form within the NPP all across the country in regards to his cabinet's successes. Finally, the South had begun to slow down the numbers retreating towards the Nationalists: if only because the majority of those willing to defect had already done so by now. And yet, as the President watched onwards, he could only feel icy betrayal as the newscaster pointed to other areas of the United States, pointing towards new, emerging areas of political upheaval. Scenes of protestors gathering in the Rockies to combat his "aggressiveness" in changing the political atmosphere, with one group leader proclaiming that "the President has frustrated the government with his radical attempts to flip the table on them as he continuously butts head with the Congress to try to get these ridiculous proposals out. They're tired, and we are too!" Every word blended together to deliver a punch to the President's gut, as he watched the black and white television broadcast images of his foundation of support, the Midwest, his own homeland, Missouri, and the Pacific, acting in defiance with small gatherings looking to turn against his actions. Every demonstration, every showcasing of the American people's exhaustion with the conflicts in Washington, every banner, every sign, every action against President Harrington served to cut away at the strings of the President's heart. "Had he not done what was right?" the President thought as he saw images of a Yockey rally in Kentucky and a brawl breaking out between Progressive members and some Democrats and Nationalist members in Minneapolis.\n\nWith a few knocks on the door, Vice President Howe entered the Oval Office to deliver news of the broadcast to the President. As he entered, he saw the President standing, wiping his eyes as he watched the news. "My apologies, Michael, I didn't mean to interrupt you.""

Workmen which he, the President of the United States, fought day and night for. And yet, as he stared at the newspaper in his hands, he witnessed how these newspaper delivery workers spread the decrying messages of the defiance of his former support.\n\nEverywhere Harrington looked, whether it was the large graphics of maps detailing political shifts, or the articles describing the spiteful protests throughout the nation against the presidential administration, he saw a nation of reluctance, crouched behind an array of heart-piercing defenses, sensitive to even the slightest bit of change, in Harrington's mind. The South had solidified their antagonistic approach to the administration, as the wave of what the critics and opposition call "exhaustion" had moved the Rockies to change. Yet even so, the venomous trail continues to seep forward, as the baseless claim of frustration has begun to sprout throughout the Pacific and the Midwest more and more. As the President continued to flip the pages, the bruises to his self conscious continued to ride his mind, causing him to relive the feelings of the television broadcast from so long ago, the feelings of loss, of betrayal. Suddenly, as Harrington walked behind his desk, essentially falling into his desk chair, a rush of more memories flooded his mind once more. This time, not with the icy feelings of the betrayal of his constituents, but of the warm connection he shared with them. Those countless hours he spent meeting up with dozens, if not hundreds of workers across the United States of America, all in desperate need of care and concern that Washington was not willing to provide for the hardworking support of the American government and economy. No, they would prefer to cut the NPP apart, leave the power to the Left who are organizing riots as we speak and the Yockeys who are going to be tearing the constitution apart the second they get close to it.\n\nAs the President brought his palms to his face to try to wipe the anger and frustration from within him, his eyes became fixated on a particular part of one of the articles in the corner of the page. The name of one of the most beautiful cities in the United States, the Gateway to the West, St. Louis, Missouri, engulfed in street brawls between the Nationalists and the Progressives."

It was an honor to serve alongside you and work together for the common man of America, but I must tow the line for the sake of my career. We will see each other soon, President Harrington." The phone line cut soon after before Harrington had the chance to respond.\n\nThe President sat leaned over his desk, silent despite his Vice President having been here to listen into the entire conversation. "So, who was that, Mike?" Howe asked. "One of the Senators of New York, another gone from the East Coast." He said in near monotone had Irving not caught the strings of emotions tied to the President's anguish. "Fuck." Harrington stated, pushing away from his desk as his face grew redder by the minute. "What the fuck else was I supposed to do, Howe, what the fuck else?" The President roused, making Irving more and more uncomfortable as he saw his friend descend into his anger. "I'm, I'm sorry, Irving. To imagine them being so tired as I sit here steering the course of the nation." He said. "Well, Mr. President, unfortunately, being tired and angry isn't going to solve the departure crisis we're seeing with members of the Progressives, or the growth of the Yockeys across the South." Irving responded. "How bad is the party looking at this point?" Harrington asked. "Well, the South is already out of the question, every sympathetic man in the South has turned to the Nationalists, the Democrats, or over to Yockey. The Rockies have slowed their defections, if for the only reason that there isn't any left on our side to switch over to the Republicans. Meanwhile, the very base of support you started out with, New England, the Pacific, and the Midwest are all turning over for the first time." Irving said. Harrington got up from his desk to pace around the Oval Office upon hearing the dreaded reports. "Mike, walking around the damn office isn't going to help stop Gus fucking Hall from taking all our support!" Irving barked.\n\nHarrington froze upon hearing his Vice President. Gus Hall? The leader of the Marxists, who helped promote and start the protests, riots, and brawls through the city streets? Americans had already claimed that Harrington had broken apart the party; however, now he could only help but wonder if he had smashed the country in the process..."

In particular, Harrington had his eyes glued to the piece of paper that had made its way to his desk. A political cartoon, a source of humor for some active within the divided political world of the United States of America. For others, such as the United States, all he saw was scorn and insults as it depicted a gross misrepresentation of him taking money from blue collar white workers in the South and throwing it into a bonfire adorned with a sign marked "Welfare Program."\n\n"The daily newspaper in Mississippi seems to have taken a liking to you, Mr. President." Howe said. "What the hell did they do that for? I made these programs for them, Irving, for fucking them!" Harrington said, tightening the grip in his hands to vent his frustrations. "Easy, Mr. President. It's because Yockey's taking control across the South, and as the Nationalists lose membership every day, Yockey burns your work across the South." Even as Harrington listened on, he had read the reports, he had watched the news, heard the people. Yockey may have been a bastard, that much is true; however, Hall was right on the other end of the spectrum, stealing away from the social democracy Harrington had built around himself to feed to his "proletarian" dreams. The NPP, the government, the whole damned country had been engulfed in this wildfire of partisanship and extremism. "Irving, I have a question." Harrington asked, in a tone mixed with resolve yet sorrow, as the Vice President braced himself. "Did I do all of this? Is it really my fault?" Harrington asked. Hearing the drastic question from the President, Howe took a long few minutes to think over the question. Howe knew that more than a superior, Harrington was his best friend. Someone who celebrated all their successes with him, and launched their platform into the spotlight. Someone who struggled with all their failures alongside him, and helped Irving get over all the obstacles they came up against.\n\n"Michael. It doesn't matter whether it's your fault or not. It doesn't matter if it really is your fault, and the federal government has become gridlocked by all the chaos coming from it. What matters is that we fix this, we repair what's been destroyed over the past few years." Irving said, patting his friend on the shoulder."

Just as the entire ordeal he had been put through for the past few months had exhausted him, the screams and cries of Americans across the country echoed a similar exhaustion. An exhaustion seemingly grew out of the peaceful change, stable economics, democracy, and logic that Harrington so desperately tried to forward under his Presidency. Rather, all that America could muster to show to the public was the hate inside their heads.\n\nWithin the South, hell had broken out by the name of Francis Parker Yockey. The seemingly compliant Nationalist wing of the NPP dominating the South had been drawn, quartered, and cannibalized by the extremists marching across the streets, advocating for the support of Fascist influence to "undo the decadence found within the system of government within the Republic," as one rally leader proclaimed in Georgia. The bastards marched up and down roads, busy intersections, anywhere and everywhere they could find attention to, and brought havoc wherever they went, forcing the African-American populations of the United States into hiding. Even the madman himself had gone up to stage, with Yockey mounting a podium and advocating that they must "rescue the ideals of Western Civilization as it decayed with the growing disgust present in the world."\n\nMeanwhile, in the North, all who had remained to support Harrington were living in the shadow of a continuously growing name for the Progressives of the United States: Gus Hall. The Communist, seeking to dually overthrow the "shackles the United States' government binds to the American worker," as a news reporter within New York City had stated. Rallies displaying Communist propaganda through the streets of the industrial north brought together the suffering workers that, alongside the unmoving political figures of Washington, hadn't remained loyal to him after working so hard for them. The Progressives of the United States had become dominated by notions of extremism and anger, but even so, wasn't the rest of the country engulfed in the same fire?\n\nEverywhere President Harrington looked, he saw a nightmare of what was meant to be a country of freedoms. Now, radicals occupied the streets as blood, tears, and fire rocked the governmental system, with only the moving forward of time able to tell what lied ahead."

Exhaustion had turned to frustration, and with frustration came action, all until the cycle repeated until one thing was left to unite the spirits of the citizens of the United States of America.\n\nTerror.\n\nAcross the South, hardline Sovereigntists had swelled in number, as they continued to ravage the notions of a free and diverse society within the United States. As their party members continued to march on in the name of Fascism, they left the streets adorned with smoke, broken glass, and blood. As the Nationalists within the National Progressive Pact, the former rivals for Harrington and all of the Progressive caucus, continued to die, a greater enemy seemed to take its place, a monster, no, an abomination. A beast of a man who sought to undo the hundreds of years of American history to raise Hell: Francis Parker Yockey. On the other hand, how could Harrington merely frame his dread around the South when the very supporters who chanted the name "Harrington" for the sake of progress now march the streets in a flood of red. The factory workers, the office writers, the hard-working American populace who had toiled for years at the behest of an unfair system attempting to strangle such poor souls out of their earnings, the ones who Harrington thought of and fought for within each and every day of his political career. Now, they cry displeasure and tiredness, and have labeled the President of the United States himself as being a "traitor to the movement of the working class." Gus Hall leads a political atrocity, one which stands to destroy the stability of the United States just as much as any figure harping the word of Yockey would as well, as he continues to tear apart the seams of political and economic foundation in the twisted name of "revolution."

It might anger some of the party's conservatives, who have already raised a fuss about where, exactly, the ESEA's funds are going.

Numerous progressives are clamoring for this policy change, to ensure that college placements are based on merit alone, and that no student should have to worry about tuition fees at a state school.

He had pored over the Wilkins Report, underlining things, scribbling in the margins. Sometimes, his eyes alighted on a particular set of numbers, and he lost several minutes pondering every horror that those numbers implied. When his staff came into the Oval Office for the next morning's meeting, he dropped the Report on his desk, and jabbed it with a determined finger.\n\n"This. This is a priority.""

It's controversial, and in every state, conservative organizations have organized marches on capitols to protest its "Anti-American, anti-equality" nature. Still, if the administration thought that it couldn't possibly pass, they never would have brought it to the Senate floor, right? The chamber is filled with senators, lobbyists, journalists, and a few concerned citizens who have shown up to visibly support their position.\n\n"Those in favor will say 'aye'.

The feeling that not only will a horror be permitted, but it will also be repeated, and made worse every time, and never lose its painfulness as it weighs on your soul. The Supreme Court struck down the AAA this morning. Maybe the law never had a chance, or maybe it was just bad luck. The impact is the same.

Filled with disgust, Harrington picked up the phone on his desk and pressed a number. "Please get Maurine and Orville in my office immediately."\n\nThe two secretaries walked in just a few minutes later, seeing their President with a heavy stack of papers sitting in front of him. "Good morning, Mr. President." said Maurine Neuberger. "Good morning, as well, Mr. President, may we be of some assistance?" an inquisitive Orville Freeman echoed behind her. "Good morning, to the both of you! Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss regarding this piece of legislation."\n\nThe next hour and a half consisted of arguments filled with yells that could be heard throughout the West Wing.\n\n"Neuberger, look at the statistics, hunger is up in America by 13% since the Akagi Accords, and that's not even considering Black citizens! This program has to be eligible for everyone, whether it's the workers, the mothers, or the veterans, all of them are starving out there!" Orville barked. "I understand, Orville, but our hands are tied for the most part. Our economy has been thrown for a loop for the longest time, and part of getting these hungry people food will have to be maintaining a stable economy, unless we seek to get rid of all of our food. All of them ought to be taken care of, but I'm not sure if we could afford to include everyone in the program, the destitute of course, but it's tough beyond that. President Harrington, I'm sure you understand?"\n\nHarrington took a deep look at both of his Secretaries.

With each line came another comment from one or the other, and with each paragraph came another argument. Until finally, the elephant in the room came crashing down on the desk between them; the targeting and focus of the Food Stamp Program.\n\n"President Harrington, with all due respect, we need this bill to go above and beyond what the United States history has done for the hungry in the past! Supermarkets are exploding around the country, and it's common logic that offering Food Stamps to be used in such huge markets will guarantee that the poor and hungry can get something to eat, they need this, Mr. President! Besides, we ran on a campaign of guaranteeing these people food, we'll be the laughing stock of the National Progressive Pact if we don't commit to this!" Secretary Freeman hammered out. "And what about those markets, Orville, do you think they'll feel righteous in handing out their profits to the needy? Mr. President, I assure you, I want these people to be fed as much as any, but forcing the free market to go too far may result in them firing back and withdrawing any sort of support for our re-election or even the NPP as a whole! We must act cautiously, sir, and committing everything to this will not be helping that matter!" Harrington dwelled on the arguments as the words came flying towards him like daggers."

It seeks to introduce a new system to aid the poor and hungry throughout the nation by allowing such citizens to obtain federally-given Food Stamps, which are to act as currency in the form of obtaining food. The President has reported that it took a "long, long time" to tweak the details and include everything that he and his administration desired to have in it. Harrington has claimed that "this Program is the foundation of a new era for American citizens, one in which mothers, fathers, veterans, and children will never have to fear with the looming question of 'Will I go hungry tonight, again?'"\n\nHaving said that, the Harrington administration has given its full backing behind the President. "President Harrington has spent countless hours with us examining the bill, it covers everything he wanted to and more, it's genius to say the least." Orville Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture, commented. "We, in the Harrington administration, offer our full support for the President in his desire to pass the bill. We were selected by the President himself to be the finest minds to plan out the success of the poor and the average citizen alike." commented Maurine Neuberger, Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nLikewise, the bill does not go without a number of critics in the public sphere as well, as numerous Congressman in the Republican-Democratic Coalition, and even the Nationalist branch of the National Progressive Pact have voiced their concerns and even fears with allowing such meddling in the free market. Backing them up, several large supermarket chains have protested the bill, citing it as a "tyrannical restriction on our successes."

President Harrington, the main backer behind a wealth of welfare reforms in the United States, has regarded such guarantees as being centrally linked to a truly "free, fair, and just" human society, and has made ambitious steps forward in his pursuits for care for every American citizen, whether they be the average worker or the poor man left out on the street, whose situation may change with each passing vote tonight.\n\nMany within the administration collaborated with the President for the past few months in composing such legislation. Particularly, Orville Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture who worked diligently with the program on other progressive reforms, comments, "Tonight, Congress will decide the fates of those lowly men, women, and children who lie on the streets, cold at night. Every unfortunate soul, scarred by the horrors of the Second World War, the plagues of economic difficulties, or otherwise, they will know if we, as a society, have learnt to care for such folk, or leave them in the dust as so many Presidents have before."\n\nOnce more, however, not everyone is in favor of the President's actions; while some may call them "progressive," Republican-Democratic Congressman, as well as several of Harrinton's constituents in the National Progressive Pact regard them as "simply radical." Even his own administration cites anxieties, as Secretary Neuberger raised several concerns, most likely in regard to the cost of the programs that President Harrington has worked on; however, she declined to comment tonight.

Discreet dinners in D.C. townhouses. Activist groups staging sit-ins at senators' offices. Hearings have been held, with witnesses ranging from doctors to economists to impoverished elders begging for lifesaving care. The FHRA is personal for President Harrington. Many of those elders were people he's met before, in grimy apartments and on ramshackle farmsteads. Success on the FHRA could mean that the lives of millions across the country will improve dramatically. If it fails to pass, though... it would be a dramatic loss for the Harrington administration, there's no denying that. Even more so for the country.

They may have founded this party, but he feels no obligation to do anything but tolerate them. Nonetheless, they took a hard vote on the FHRA, and they've received plenty of less-than-kind feedback from their constituents. Now, they've come to push the administration to make penance.\n\n"This contract for Nucor would create two hundred new jobs in Birmingham."\n\n"Spartanburg, sir, is in desperate need of improvements to its hospitals."\n\n"The fact is that more than a third of Florida's fruit producers need this subsidy to continue operations profitably."\n\nOn and on they go.

His face, half-paralyzed two decades earlier in an attempted killing, looked unusually enthusiastic. Harrington liked Victor. They shared both moral righteousness and an obsession with the particulars of organization. Harrington had turned the White House upside down. Victor had turned the United Auto Workers into a labor empire. And now he had come with a radical new proposal for Medicare.\n\n"Victor, this would essentially render the private insurers obsolete."\n\n"That's the point, Mr. President. Why should we let anyone fall through the cracks when we have this opportunity?"\n\n"It'd be a hell of a lot harder to pass at all, that's why."\n\n"I know it'd be a tough sell. But it's the right thing to do, and the policy shop in Detroit has been running polls already.

On the other hand, the US Chamber of Commerce has taken the lead in opposing the bill. They have their own letter-writing campaigns, and much more imposing fundraisers. The Chamber has been calling Medicare the first step on the road to tyranny, a waste of money, a handout, and plenty of other things besides. The sizable tax burden that's been plastered across the editorial pages of half the country's newspapers hasn't helped the administration's case much. With both sides jockeying for Congress to vote their way, it's anyone's game, and the American healthcare system depends on how that vote goes."

With a cough, however, the man in the middle officially began the meeting.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin this by saying that I am proud of each and every one of you. Without every secretary present, our administration would be nowhere near as successful as it has been." A round of silence, with some awkward smiles, greeted the President. "Having said that, we are nowhere near finishing the work we have planned, in particular being the Social Security network we have planned out to guarantee every American the ability to feel secure about the financial matters of their lives. With that in mind, such provisions are not without costs, and we must address the elephant in the room: the defense budget is easily one of the easiest programs of our expenditure to cut back on."\n\nThe President's proposal was met with a wide range of nervous coughs, gasps, and the shaking of heads. "With all due respect, Mr. President, the nation's security and safety is held up by the defense budget, while we may desire the possibility of helping out those without stability, no one will have any form of stability if we're unsafe."

"News got out about the potential rate of the rise of income taxes, sir." he said, giving the President a wave of anxiety. "Campaign donors and other business owners are having a fit, executive employees are taking a hit on all phone lines." He continued, rushing towards another office.\n\n"Damn it all!" Harrington said, making it back to his office while swiftly slamming the door on his way in with anger. He nearly fell down into his chair in the office, and pulled himself up to look at the sheets of legislation on his desk, and picking up his phone. "Secretary Neuberger, please come to my office immediately." Maurine soon walked in, with a swift "Please, take a seat." issued by her superior. "Maurine, now that the news is out regarding the income tax raise, we have to make a decision. If we sit on this we are just going to keep losing more support, should we go through with the full increase or not?" Secretary Neuberger was overwhelmed with the sudden demand of her, but managed to come together. "Well, Mr. President, I must admit that although it is quite the unpopular strategy, it would generate a substantial amount of income to come in for the Treasury. Furthermore, while I'm no campaign manager, people are sure to appreciate a Social Security net, and if taxes are to provide funds for it, then I would have to say that some would be appreciative at least."\n\nHarrington pinched the bridge of his nose to deal with the stress of it all. Neuberger was always one to provide legitimate facts, but he'd be damned to say that this would not come to make his next election a whole new pain in the ass. Having said that, maybe this is just what we need though, to rally those appreciative enough of it to his side to help with the Social Security program?"

The construction of the bill was getting closer and closer to being ready, and yet, with every passing day, more memories of his earlier days flooded towards him. Constant thoughts about his political readings, his viewings of the suffering of those in labor, and the uncaring of their superiors towards their difficulties. No kidding why so many are hungry out there, can't even get a break to eat, can they? Harrington dwelled on his thoughts, and finally sat down after the hour of time he had to battle with himself. Finally, he grabbed the phone, and punched in that ever familiar number. "Mr. President? It's eight in the evening, can I help you?" Secretary Neuberger replied over the phone. "Listen, it's about the Social Security bill. I think I finally want to add in the amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act in it, could you come in?" Silence came in through the phone for a few moments.\n\nGive me half an hour to get there, Mr. President.\n\nThe President's Secretary came in through the Oval Office just a minute early. "You don't joke around with time, do you?" Harrington said. "Mr. President, I appreciate your humor, but this could completely change the situation. Adding those amendments could cause the business owners to lash out far worse than ever before, and we are already taking in deep crap from them, what makes you think giving them more hell is going to do for us?" With that, the Secretary's respectful disposition faded to the back, as Harrington thoughtfully nodded. "Madam Secretary, my senior communications advisors have instructed the danger in it, that the bill is already facing the threat of death without the amendments. But let's face facts, Mrs. Neuberger. Every day, those hard-working Americans that we are trying to look after up here are not getting any respect for the work they do, nor any way to move forward from their suffering. We need to help them!\n\n"But is it the right time? The bill could die the second it hits the Congressional vote already. " Harrington thought, in the midst of silence."

"Seeing President Harrington every day, I know that this piece of legislation is something that comes from deep within him. To see the success of American citizens without a cost to their freedom, time, or effort. He believes in the American Dream, and just knows that it takes a great amount of care and unity to see that we may prosper together."\n\nWhile Secretary Neuberger's words indeed spark emotion, the opposition cite a lack of any form of unity in the bill. Many of Harrington's critics, including several Democratic Senators, cite that such a program will bankrupt American reserves, while a wide range of Nationalist Congressmen in the National Progressive Pact see this as a "direct violation of American economic traditions."

Vice President Irving Howe said. "We get the people supportive of our reforms, the less opposition the RDC will be able to put up."\n\nHarrington nodded. It wasn't rocket science - he'd promised America a presidency of the common man, and he would keep his promises. The only question was where to start.\n\n"What about the veterans?" Defense Secretary William Winter stated. "America has thousands of men who served in South Africa and in the Pacific. Nobody's going to object to us treating our heroes right."\n\n"A Home for Heroes." Nobody would question the need to repay America's soldiers for their service; the Nationalists of the NPP would be ecstatic, and the RDC would be hard-pressed to say no.

Harrington rubbed his eyes, dry from the strain of reading through the draft. He'd taken a close look at every line - this first act, the one upon which everything else would follow, would be perfect. Senator Jackson would ensure that the rest of the draft would go through Congress, to take care of the rest.\n\nIt ought to be easy, Harrington thought. Everybody loved veterans, and the NPP could finally stick it to the RDC for not only being soft on the fascists, but ungrateful to its soldiers. Education subsidies for veterans, increased access to healthcare, disability payments to the injured - who in their right mind could oppose this?\n\nHarrington sighed.

The Progessives and the Nationalists of the NPP were broadly in support, and mounting a full-throated defense of the bill. The RDC members, for that matter, were speaking in broad platitudes about the bill's provisions, hailing the intent of the legislation.\n\nBut the details were a different question. Time and again, Democratic senators - and even a few Republicans - had asked about money. Money, money, always the money. Harrington had been in Washington long enough to understand that when people wanted to criticize you quietly, they would ask about the money - a fitting fig leaf to disguise a lack of concern for America's soldiers in the language of responsibility.\n\nThe debate wound on, and Harrington resisted the urge to call the Senate leadership for an update. Politics was a numbers game, of course, but they'd been careful to package everything in a way that couldn't be opposed on the merits.

A cab driver had found him collapsed a few blocks away from the hospital. A few minutes after we had brought him in and put him up in a bed, he pulled a switchblade and was holding it against my throat. It turns out that he didn't have a cent to his name, and couldn't pay for services. Guess he thought taking a hostage would help his situation somewhat. We let him go, and I never saw John again. The police shrugged it off, when they finally showed up. Just another homeless wino, they said.

I am the oldest of eighteen children from Lewiston. My father, Gerard, worked in a mill. He beat me, and when I was eleven, I ran away from home. For two years, I lived on the streets. I worked in whatever job I could get. Shining shoes. Washing dishes. I've slept in the back room at strip clubs and horse stables. But I survived. Eventually, I became the only person in my family to graduate high school.\n\nI wanted to go to college intensely. But at Husson, the entrance test was in English, and I was terrible with it. So I went to my state representative, Peter Snowe, and he helped convince the admissions people to let me take a test in French. I passed, and they accepted me. Now, I'm studying for a business degree. I write for the school newspaper. And thanks to the Higher Education Act, I don't have to worry about the cost. I am working hard and making something of myself. And you helped with that, Mr. President. So, thank you."

harrington.99.desc:0 "Dear Mr. President,\n\nMy grandfather always called Gallup "Kalabwakin". That's the town's name in Zuni, in the language that he spoke. My parents never spoke it around me, although my cousin works at a school in Zuni Pueblo that teaches it to little kids. I hope to send mine there someday. When I was growing up in Gallup, though, my parents didn't spend much time caring about school. My father was a dishwasher, and my mother a hotel maid. The highways were being built, and with them came travelers, tourists, all of those people. It brought money and jobs, but nobody got rich. Not even close. My parents drank. They never did drugs, but most of my friends had at least one parent who did. We were all desperate. Once I left home, I moved across town with the boy I'd met at Gallup High. He ran off three years later, to work construction in Albequerque. Left me with two toddlers and barely any way to make ends meet. But when I could vote, Mr. President, I voted for you. Your efforts have helped me get enough food on my table, and not get tossed out by my landlord. I know a lot of folks around here who feel the same. So, thank you, Mr. President. You helped."

My family has been supporting Democrats, and then Republican-Democrats, for generations, and we loved them for nominating the Kennedys. My grandma called you a dirty Red the first time she ever saw one of your advertisements. She called you an atheist, and a bunch of other things. But last year, her husband, my grandpa, passed away. He had worked as a janitor at the Big Y headquarters for years and years. Grandma had always been worried about keeping the house-she had been raised in it, you know-but now she gets his pension benefits and doesn't have to worry anymore. I don't think that she'd ever admit it, but I know that I'm grateful. So thank you, Mr. President. I'm glad that you did what you did."

 harrington.201.t:0 "The Quiet Americans"
 harrington.201.desc:0 "President Harrington sometimes takes a walk along the grounds of the White House: in the first weeks of his term he made the bold move to begin walking around the D.C. Metropolitan Area's seedier districts, the streets that the Secret Service make sure to lock down every Presidential Address. He continues that tradition on an infrequent basis, when he can spare the time, greeting the lower-income constituents of the Beltway and treating them to a meal - he takes pains to remember all their names. Sometimes the name is all you have, he thinks. In any case, Harrington has little fear of blowback from these men and women: his policies have shifted the window on public discourse and treatment of the poor more than any other President in American history. Although he has savaged his Cabinet, nearly driven the Chambers insane and generally raised hell to do so, he has no regrets on the matter.\n\nTonight he takes a slightly different route, walking in another direction: same streets, different people. The lights dim, the streets narrow and fill with the casual refuse of American life, broken condoms and filled trash-bags. The other America is here, where the normal Americans aren't, and their response will tell him more about his success as a President than any pundit or analytical group. He walks into a cafe, its dull neon aesthetic glinting in the streetlights, and begins to probe. Is the government doing okay? Do you feel safe? Do your children feel safe? What do you think? "The fridges are still empty most days, the schools aren't working thanks to all the new fancy rules, the kids still walk to school afraid. But I hear it's worse in Mississippi. I hear it's worse in the Black Belt. I hear it's worse in Detroit. I hear the President's working to help but -"\n\nHarrington goes to bed that night and lies sleepless, even into the chill hours of the Potomac dawn. The cry of herons follows him, vast and boundless, into the gray morning light."

 harrington.202.t:0 "The Shaking Earth, The Quaking Seas"
 harrington.202.desc:0 "The cracks in the NPP had been there for a long time, traceable to the moments of its inception. Simply put, the average National Progressive is a schizophrenic, his disparate personalities united only by a hatred of the Japanese threat. Many were willing to band around the cause of pushing the weak, spineless Republican-Democrats out of the White House. But the tension could only be ignored so long - and now it is beginning to splinter the very ground under which the President sits.\n\nAs Harrington's presidency becomes increasingly focused on its internal policymaking, and the cries of Big Government grow ever louder from the street-tops, the NPP is beginning to reconsider its loyalty to the man it has propelled to office. If a candidate refuses to toe to party line, bullying his party-members into submission and pushing an agenda that appears increasingly radical, well.. Loyalty can be defined, but it can also be redefined - created, but also withheld. The Rightists in the NPP led this charge, attempting to negotiate with Harrington to tone down his radical interventionist policy, but to no avail.\n\nIn a series of closed-door meetings the inevitable comes to pass. The Nationalist caucus moves across the proverbial floor, denouncing the Harrington Presidency as a nest of traitors, snakes and vipers dedicated only to turning America decadent, weak and prey for the foreign invaders. They are accompanied, alarmingly, by a pronouncement from a series of Baptist churches in the American South and West, declaring much the same thing: but this time they go further. For the first time in American civic history, a pastor declares the incumbent American President an Anti-Christ, dedicated to giving the American way of life over to the devil. This is an unpleasant surprise: it will not, however, be the last."

 harrington.203.t:0 "Doubt in the Aisles, Fear in the Pews"
 harrington.203.desc:0 "The editorial is simple and damning: President Harrington is going too far. His policies are well-intentioned, no doubt - here the author pauses for dramatic effect, evaluating Harrington's personal history and his party's policies in an objective light - but are they really what is best for Americans at this point in time? Harrington's reformist sentiments extend not just to pension funds and social safety nets, but to education, to urban design, to the structure of the job, to a hundred other things that define the American way of life. How much can the apple tree be shaken for its fruits before the trunk tears itself apart in the tension? The author goes on to note that the worrying lack of progress on many of Harrington's Moral Battlefields, his areas of focus where the American poor are concerned, does not reflect a lack of effort on the Administration's part. The bureaucrats of the American government are simply trying to barricade policy they see as alienating and dangerous, not to mention tedious. They might even be right.\n\nThe sympathy the author exudes is possibly the most insulting thing about the article: it is clear that in other circumstances, the author might even have supported Harrington for his conviction and unshakeable belief in the need for a government with a heart. It is with profound sorrow that the author announces his doubt, so profound it acts as a final spit in the metaphorical coffin. He pronounces, with a magisterial and terribly condescending grace, that Harrington is 'the President we deserve, but perhaps not the President the nation needs right now.' Perhaps the editorial would not be so damning, nor its effect so profound, if it were not for the name attached to it: the editorial is written in the unmistakable style of, and signed off by, Lyndon B. Johnson, staunch Republican, cold-eyed reformist and (until today) the biggest ally Harrington has across the aisle policy-wise. If the Johnson is wavering, then Harrington's cross-aisle support is under threat as well: and another card is taken out of the already trembling house."

 harrington.204.t:0 "A Quiet Divorce Is Hardest to Bear"
 harrington.204.desc:0 "The parting of longtime partners is always bitter. Long-time enmity dissolves to wistfulness and sorrow, and the hopes undergirding that enmity are sublimed into a greater regret - it is said that things are most beautiful in retrospect, and perhaps the main engine driving that beauty is not the joy those things brought, but the sorrow of having to leave them behind. So it is in a quiet room in the locked doors of a hotel a few miles from D.C., as a long-time partnership dissolves - this partnership is not a matrimonial one, but it brings with it its own emotional baggage, and a fear of the future, that would not look out of place in any family court.\n\nThe Republican faction has officially renounced its support for Harrington's policy and by extension his administration: LBJ himself has spoken to the press about the mounting and eventually unbearable tensions the President has wrought on his nation through misguided and hasty policymaking. In a defiant shot back across the aisle, the President has in turn accused Lyndon of being the worst of allies, a moderate too enamoured of the vested interests he hides behind his back to support real change. The answer is clear: a break in public must be followed with a split in the alliance which once held Harrington's Congress together, and helped push through most of his policies.\n\nThe parting of longtime partners is always bitter, and tinged with sorrow: but the uncertainty is far more visceral than either of these. Harrington wonders, as he walks out of that hotel room into the bright day of the Beltway, what lies ahead for the country, and for himself. The ground trembles and quakes, but there is no time to stop. The programme, after all, must be finished - for Harrington has bright dreams for his country still, and the most dangerous visions are those that remain untarnished in the face of failure."

 harrington.205.t:0 "Crack the Heavens, Split the Seas"
 harrington.205.desc:0 "The Progressive-NPP has always been an eclectic blend, to use the politically correct terminology. Progressivism is a potent motivator, but its unifying power has always been in doubt, and within the Progressive caucus there have always been strains of divergent thought about the extent and importance of the reforms officially proposed under their platform. Harrington's newfound aggressive stance is one that has shaken significant parts of this unstable base: talking about Social Security and reforms to labor security are quite different from what has been accomplished, what has been done and what remains on the table. There is talk of radicalism, of overreach - the Good Old Days are definitely gone, as are the smiles that accompanied it.\n\nBobby Kennedy sums it up best: in a speech given at Party Headquarters (publicised by media after the event in lurid fonts) he comments on "the devil we know, and how he turned out to be the devil we don't know so well after all". The reference doesn't even bother with explicitness, which in itself stands as a testimony to the splits occurring within the Progressive front. It's all out in the open now, and so when Harrington hits back with a demand for party unity and a call to "stay on course, lest we drift apart and then astray", no-one is surprised. Acrimony is the order of the day, after all, and just as with any breaking family, it might even be taken as a sign of affection.\n\nOne thing is certain: if things go on like this, well... the President is a strong man and no one can say he is a coward, but he is not a miracle worker. Lapsed Catholicism aside, no Savior will descend on fiery clouds to help him where even his own party has deserted him. Ironic, given the circumstances: Golgotha is far away - but for Michael Harrington, Good Friday is here."

 harrington.206.desc:0 "As ignorant Congressmen clash in a darkling Capitol, the whispers grow to a subtle storm. Crack-crack-crack go the ceiling fans in a dozen meetings, called and cancelled for working groups that have dissolved into the fractal chaos of the Progressive caucus. Crack-crack-crack and the rooms are silent, save for the slow sizzle of burning stares and desperate notes, written in the knowledge they might already be irrelevant. Crack-crack-crack and the President walks into hushed Cabinet meetings where the Pact is mentioned less and less, and Our Men mentioned more and more. Nobody smiles, few greet the President, many outright argue with him. After the anguish there is silence, and the fans, and the silent face of the black night outside.\n\nCrack-crack-crack go the ceiling fans, and with every whir a Party dies. The Rightists are long gone, the Republicans have left, the Progressives have crumbled, the radicals are increasingly silent (although a Representative Yockey and his followers are vocal in their agitation). Slow amputation, but an amputation nonetheless.\n\nThe Republican-Democrats can only watch in awe as their biggest rival for the hearts of the American people calves and splinters from within, unsure whether to mourn or celebrate. The cliques are forming, along lines carefully predetermined by alignment on policy platforms and collaboration: the only thing they can think to agree on is that none of them will ever work with Harrington's Men Of The People (or Yes-Men, to use the derogatory term) again. The Progressives are a caucus in name and in physical presence, but the facade is all there is now. Everything else burns as the President watches a government torn asunder. And there is no end in sight."

The Overton Window has at least shifted sufficiently for the Left-NPP to begin filling in the cracks (and there are more cracks every week) in the President's circle of Advisors, to compensate for the crumbling Progressive base that Harrington relies on. Chavez himself has begun to take on an increasingly accommodating position, speaking up for the use of Presidential executive orders where legislative means prove non-viable (and since President Harrington doesn't control Congress, the former is looking like an increasingly appeal long option).\n\nCertainly there are very few cynics left in the Cabinet, and even fewer remain in the President's graces: in what appears to be a reactive fit of paranoia the President has even begun expelling those he seems unfit for the Party and an enemy of his agenda from his personal space (although he really doesn't control much beyond his personal desk anymore). Those who are left are forced to withstand an environment of constant stress and fatigue. Too much work, too few hands, and the cameras and paparazzi grow louder every day, their chorus more insistent.\n\nAfter a 25-hour board meeting titled Resolution To Current Affairs (Legislative Means And Procedures), Harrington reportedly collapses from stress and overwork at a conference reviewing the continuing failures of Education Reform in the Southern States. The press are ushered out, but the photos of the President lying supine on the desk hit a nation's vital signs like a brick. Something is wrong with the United States of America..."

(Last week the papers published a photo of a Guardsman wrestling with a protestor: it was bad optics for all, and if the Zhdanov cocktail in the protestor's hand had been dropped...)\n\nThe hooded figure making his way down the alley gazes at the signs, the paint still drying in bright flecks and stripes: HARRINGTON GET OUT! COMMUNISM NOT WELCOME HERE! WHO PAYS FOR US? The crowds holding it aloft are not bankers or corporate suits, of course. No, these crowds are the middle and lower classes: from the West Coast drawls and the New England polish he hears in the babble, some of them have come quite a long way. He listens attentively, asking questions: here at the end of all things he can at least ask for clarity.\n\nThe poor speak to him as they never have before. Collapsed companies, drying-out towns and burnt-out teachers, slowly slumping local economies. Reforms to education impacting thousands of students, some of them poor, some of them their families' last hopes. Broken homes that only receive a perfunctory brush with federal welfare, and are left to rot. Whispers of the President's inaction towards certain parts of the civil rights movement - is he a bigot? And regret, regret for President Harrington and for the nation he dragged into the furnace of good intentions, endless regret and the scent of lost futures.\n\nAll these come out into the open, and revelation brings its own senseless and ineffable calm.

My position gives power, but it also bestows vision. I see the tired young mother, struggling at her workplace against the invisible sexism that chokes her career and her family; I see the tired old farmer, yoked to the agriculture companies that rob him of his due share. I see the fearful young minority walking on the city streets, knowing his every breath is a threat to those who would seek his harm. Their struggle to live, work and play is my struggle as well, and I will make it our struggle; for if the other America dies a quiet death just off the television screen, I, your President, will have failed at leading this one. And the struggle that defines these forgotten ones is not just one of poverty, but of culture, soul and spirit; therefore it will be my task, and my privilege, to bring true and lasting reform to the system which shackles with crime, unemployment, despair and low health. I implore all Americans to stand with me, and with them."\n\n"... My fellow Americans, my party and my country pledge me to protect the Union indivisible.

But my faith in the essential worth, the dignity and pride of man, that which is granted to each of us at birth and which the world cannot wrest away save through death - that faith could no more leave me than I could choose to leave my bones and skin. Hence I pursued a singular goal once in office, most peculiar to my peers and aggravating to my opponents; the return to an honest American morality in policymaking, away from the gilded sham it had become in the hands of capital. I began my third speech to Congress with this story:\n\n"Any child will tell you, and proudly at that, that if one were to see a starving beggar at the side of the road, the right, Christlike, American thing to do would be to help him up, bring him home, treat his wounds. Indeed, if the child were to recommend that we leave him at the roadside to live or die, any parent would rebuke him! The desire to protect the commonweal is ingrained in the nature of man itself. Yet because our country's business halls and public offices deem poverty a sin and helplessness an untreatable illness, we have all become hypocrites! We rob the beggar of his right to healthcare and safety, the mental patient of his right to equal and proper treatment, and the criminal of his right to redemption and restoration to the world."\n\nMy question, friends, is this: when your children grow old enough to see you as an equal, to know your accomplishments for what they are, will they call you a hypocrite too? Someone who knew his duty to his fellow man, but spurned it because he was weak, afraid, or simply had too much to lose?...And that terrible title of hypocrite; will you deserve it?"

"Mister President," he said, sitting down across from Harrington, "I understand from your call that you're looking for me as a cabinet member?"\n"That's right, Taylor. A President needs a cabinet, and I've dallied for too long on the formation of mine. I want you to be my Secretary of State."\nTaylor looked taken aback. "Really?

npp_fp.1.desc:0 "WASHINGTON -- No matter your political leanings, all recent conversation in the Capitol invariably turns to the same subject: President [USA.GetLeader]'s announcement that the United States would seek to revise the post-war modus vivendi with the Empire of Japan.\n\nThe policy pronouncement, though vague, has been a central policy plank of the National Progressive Pact since its formation. Although the [GetLeader] Administration has remained tight-lipped on concrete initiatives, this has only encouraged the imagination of the political class in Washington. Members of the NPP congressional delegation could be heard throughout the week speculating on America's newfound foreign policy, ranging from doubling military and financial aid to the Organization of Free Nations to actively destabilizing the Co-Prosperity Sphere's via its many restive insurgencies. While stressing that the ultimate decision rests with the President, senior NPP figures emphasized that 'all options remain on the table.'\n\nMembers of the Republican-Democratic Coalition have expressed skepticism towards the President's confrontational foreign policy, viewing the endeavor as naive adventurism. A senior RDC policy aide, who asked not to be named, panned the NPP policy as dangerously reckless with little consideration for de-escalation. "It's all fun and games," they remarked, "until the nukes fly.""
npp_fp.1.a:0 "At least the NPP fights for America!"
npp_fp.2.t:0 "The Means"
npp_fp.2.desc:0 "The three supplicants - the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of State, and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency - sat opposite President [USA.GetLeader] as the clock struck twelve. With bursting binders and copious calculations, they each settled in to decide the means of America's vengeance against Japan - a knock down drag-out budgetary deathmatch.\n\nThe Chairman spoke first. "Total military superiority has to be the foundation of our strategy. The Japanese only respect force, and we'll beat them at their own game."\n\nAs the Chairman finished, the Secretary of State shot him a withering look. "That's bullshit. Hoarding resources is meaningless if the Japanese isolate Australia and New Zealand to wither and starve. We have to fortify and invest in the OFN, an unbreakable rock for the Japanese to break themselves upon."\n\nThe Director of the CIA sighed. "The Japanese Empire is not the monolith they make themselves out to be. Political subversion and precise covert action can expose the rot at the heart of their Empire, eroding it from within."\n\nWhen the three finished, President [USA.GetLeader] digested their proposals. "You all make a good case, and it's clear you're worried there's only so much funding to go around." President [USA.GetLeader] leaned forward across the desk. "Gentlemen, cost is no issue; I'm afraid we aren't being nearly imaginative enough.""

npp_fp.3.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
npp_fp.3.desc:0 "The office of the President could be a thankless job, but there were still some simple tasks to be found, here and there.\n\nFor example, playing host. President [USA.GetLeader] beckoned the leaders of the OFN to his side in the Oval Office as they posed for a group photograph, smiling before the flash and clatter of the cameras. It was the family photo of the Free World, from Canada to Central America to Australia and New Zealand, all smiles and merriment before the press were shooed out of the room for the real work to begin.\n\nOften, the President would have to serve as a mediator. President [USA.GetLeader] found himself motioning for the Canadian Prime Minister to stop talking over his Central American counterpart, so that his complaints could get a fair hearing. The leader of the Free World would ensure that the littlest amongst them was still among equals.\n\nBut the easiest job, President [USA.GetLeader] found, was that of salesman. Tens of millions of dollars and technical assistance for Latin American agriculture; hundreds of millions of dollars for Canadian industry, or for the never-ending reinforcement of Fortress Australia and the Rock of New Zealand. The precise sums, President [USA.GetLeader] realized, never really mattered. It was that time of year, as important to OFN members as Christmas was to children.\n\nAmerica would be generous to its OFN family, President [USA.GetLeader] thought, for they could either stand together or they would die alone."

npp_fp.4.desc:0 ""Foreman! You're going to want to see this!"\n\nThe shift foreman raced out from the mining office as his miners rushed out of the mines, racing towards the entrance to the complex. The ground rumbled faintly as the newest American excavator lumbered into sight. Standing well over the height of three men and belching diesel smoke from its exhaust, the mighty machine crawled over the pitted rocks of the path leading to the Mount Isa mines, in the Queensland outback.\n\nThe miner who had pulled the foreman outside could barely hide his excitement. "Did you know this was coming?"\n\nThe foreman nodded, hiding his own amazement much more successfully. Sure, he'd signed off on the mystery paperwork sent over by corporate in response to his last requisition, something about an American program. More red tape from Canberra was nothing new.\n\nBut this marvelous contraption was absolutely new, and as the excavator's claws roared to life and ripped into the face, doing in an instant what would have taken their old machines two hours, he joined his miners in a raucous yell:"
npp_fp.4.a:0 ""Thank God for the Americans!""
npp_fp.21.t:0 "Mysterious Saboteurs"
npp_fp.21.desc:0 "The corporal was jolted awake as the convoy slammed to a halt. It was still quiet, a sign that was both good and bad. Good, because it meant that they hadn't stumbled into a guerrilla ambush; bad, because there would be backbreaking work ahead.\n\nThe corporal grabbed his surplus Arisaka and hopped off the truck, jogging his way to the front of the column. As he approached the lead vehicle, the jungle foliage opened up before a river - and the broken, blasted remnants of the only bridge on said river for miles.\n\nThe lieutenant - an IJA officer detached to the Philippine Army - was furious. "Those damned guerrilla scum," he muttered, looking nearly ready to flog the river for refusing to bend to his will.\n\nThe corporal walked towards a gaggle of engineers, hanging back as the officer vented his rage. "How long will this take?"\n\n"Four hours, depending on Lieutenant Ida's mood." The lead engineer shrugged as he lit a cigarette. "Don't know how he does it, it's the third time this week."\n\nThe corporal sighed. "Hope he realizes that the river won't tell him who blew the bridge."\n\nThe engineer chuckled darkly. "Just like the two rivers before this one.""
npp_fp.21.a:0 "Time to hurry up and wait..."
npp_fp.22.t:0 "Set Up The Networks"
npp_fp.22.desc:0 "Despite the Philippine government's assurances, the authorities struggled to enforce their presence across the vast archipelago. Nowhere was this more clear than in the Agdao barangay, or neighborhood, in Davao - the largest city in the Southern Philippines. Here, far from Manila, the barangay councils ruled, a parallel Filipino society surviving in the shadow of Japan's model cities.\n\nThe police gave Agdao a wide berth, rarely venturing into the barangay for fear of their lives. This, and a fistful of yen, was enough for Alex Cayetano to slip through the checkpoint. He turned off the road, losing any Kenpeitai tails before ducking inside a bar off the beaten path.\n\nThe barangay captain was waiting, a well-built man with a jagged scar on his cheek. "Mano po, ginoong," Cayetano said, touching his forehead to the captain's hand.\n\nThe captain nodded. "Stiff. You must be the new one."\n\n"Your family abroad sends their regards," Cayetano replied. The captain ignored tradecraft, but he was untouchable; Cayetano could not be so careless, for he was disposable.\n\nAfter a moment, the captain laughed, a low rumble. "Ha! Let me tell you about our uncle in Manila, so caught in his splendor that he rarely visits anymore. I hope you brought some gifts; this may take a while...""

npp_fp.23.t:0 "Chaos in the Countryside"
npp_fp.23.desc:0 "The halls of the hospital were lined with stretchers and gurneys, laden with the bodies of bloodied soldiers. Nurses scurried about, hooking soldiers to IV drips to stabilize their condition, while a doctor examined every new arrival, marking those too mangled to be saved with a black tag. The sirens had largely subsided, five hours after the attack, replaced by barked orders and keening wails.\n\nThe local police commander, having finally arrived to visit his injured men, offered his thanks to the hospital director. "There aren't enough words to express my thanks for the work your people do here, day after day."\n\nThe hospital director, haggard and sorely in need of a change of clothes, sighed resignedly. "Your thanks would be more meaningful with actual protection." From the window, a plume of black smoke could still be seen coming from the direction of the army outpost, destroyed by the morning's bombing - the third that month. "The guerrillas are getting bolder. My staff are asking: what happens when we're attacked for helping you? Not if, but when."\n\nIt was no idle question, and the police commander grimaced. "Director, if we tried to protect every hospital in this city, let alone the whole country, we wouldn't be able to go after the guerrillas at all."\n\n"And that's done - excuse me - jack shit." The director's sunken eyes bored into the commander's. "If you can't protect us, then what are you good for?""

They'd watched from the sidelines as the Army had fought the Viet Minh insurgency in the rural provinces, content with protecting lives and property. It was, for many officers, the safer option: the worst they could expect to face were battles with street gangs, rather than the endless jungle ambushes of the Army.\n\nAnd yet, for the first time in years, the populace was increasingly uncooperative. Wary glances and resentful stares, once reserved for the Army officers, now followed policemen on their daily patrols. More than once, the police would break up another underground political study group, only to be greeted by a jeering public as they corralled the arrested students into the black vans.\n\nAlways, they would find pamphlets, printed with the mark of the Viet Minh. "Is it not better to die free, than to be an Emperor's slave?" The Saigon police force had found thousands of them, their numbers rising steadily alongside the wave of crime sweeping the city without pause or respite.\n\nOfficers whispered amongst themselves, sharing worried glances before the next reported incident. If the Viet Minh could spread and win converts in the cities, then the wave of petty crime was only a harbinger for something far worse. Was the war in the provinces finally coming home?"

Acrid smoke, from burning debris to charred flesh, wafted skywards as forensics officers meticulously scoured the surroundings, picking through dead bodies and discarded shell casings like vultures.\n\nThe army would quickly whisk away any captured Viet Minh fighters for 'interrogation', though oftentimes the intelligence gained was minimal for the lethal violence employed. Knowing this, most attackers refused to allow themselves to be captured, either rushing their enemies with a grenade or eating their last bullet, becoming just another gory detail sanitized as a 'dead insurgent.'\n\nThis guerrilla was no different, except he had botched his final act of resistance, shooting himself in the stomach rather than the mouth after being buffeted by an explosion. It wouldn't be long until he expired; the army lieutenant questioning him seemed not to care, slapping the dying man's face to keep him conscious.\n\n"Where did you get your weapons?" Slap. "How many more of you are there?" Slap. "Where are your comrades hiding?" A vacant smile; the lieutenant slammed the butt of his rifle into the insurgent's sternum. The insurgent, face wracked with pain, vomited a black soup of blood and pus, before sucking in one last ragged breath.\n\n"Viva la revolucion," the insurgent croaked, doubling over with his final words."

The perfect cover for observing the Japanese occupier at work.\n\nBy night, Cayetano joined the Agdao barangay captain's entourage, patrolling the streets and serving the community, while developing the means to smuggle in American guns and supplies unseen.\n\nDays turned into weeks as Cayetano built his network, observing the inner workings of his contacts. They were superbly organized, running a parallel government in plain sight of the Japanese - a promising sign.\n\nOne morning, the captain took Cayetano aside. "Somebody wants to talk to you. Tonight, stay in the bar past closing. You'll be back in a few days."\n\nIt was the break he'd been waiting for, and Cayetano eagerly hung on after the bar's lights went out, until the hood came over his head and the chloroform swept him away from consciousness. A few times, he could hear the muffled roar of an engine, the bumps of a backroad passing underneath. By the time his eyes could focus again, he found himself bound in a wooden hut, sunlight filtering through the cracks in the wall.\n\n"So, you're finally back."

npp_fp.31.desc:0 "The devil of policy formulation was in the details. As the Cabinet drafted the outline of America's industrial strategy to support any future war with Japan, two distinct schools of thought had emerged.\n\nOne, championed by the Secretary of Defense, advocates for the expansion of military infrastructure and production capacity. The legacy of President Thomas Dewey's failure to build up America's military continues to haunt the Pentagon; proponents of this plan argue that the buildup of military equipment needed to support a future war must start today, even at the expense of other industrial or economic priorities. They warn that ultimately, America will go to war with the military it has, rather than the military it wants.\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce takes a different tack, arguing that fostering the growth of America's civilian industrial base would yield accelerating dividends in the longer-run. The wholesale diversion of American industry into military production, they argue, would be monstrously inefficient and create a hypermilitarized economy like that of Germany or Japan, a nation of free men enslaved to their guns. Even if it would take time to shift civilian factories to military production in a crisis, America remains protected by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, buying time to bring American industry to bear."

These proud men were laid low by injustice, and America's rage smouldered on their behalf.\n\nThe mother of four, whose sons were obliterated in an instant by a Japanese battleship, stifled a sob as she remembered burying four caskets in a single day. She did not need to say more, for America wept for her.\n\nThe veteran, whose remaining hand shook as he described the metallic taste coating his mouth when a 'dead' soldier detonated into a meaty mist, vaporizing his sergeant while shrapnel cleaved through his arm. America recoiled at Japanese barbarism, the acts of a race of beasts playing at being human.\n\nSuch indignities, such sorrow, such horror! This was the legacy of the last war, recalled in every waking moment by the Occupation of Hawaii and the Treaty Ports. America endured, but this - this was not life!

He was no stranger to the staggering scale of war - fighting on the British Isles as a major, he'd watched waves of American soldiers fling themselves against the Germans like so many leaves in a storm. He never thought that he would see anything like it again, but now witnessed an America arming itself for another grand crusade, its industrial heart rousing itself from decades of torpor.\n\n"It was an ambitious contract, but you've got it all in hand," the General said.\n\n"You're not the first to be impressed," the chief executive of the plant replied, keeping up with the General's brisk pace. "We can produce one tank every eight hours, and we're working to bring that down to six, maybe five."\n\nThe General ran the numbers in his head. "One tank per workday, maybe two or three at full capacity and triple shifts, so two to six hundred tanks a year." A rare smile creased his face. "Remarkable.""

In reality, our victory was a lot narrower than we'd like, and many of our voters supported us for our progressive domestic agenda rather than the campaign of vengeance many of the party leadership still like to see as the core of our platform. In addition many of the former Dixiecrats in the party are openly sympathetic to isolationist stances and only pay lip service to containing Japan. We now have a difficult choice ahead; promptly reinstating the draft and enact war preparation measures to ensure our nation is protected against the many foreign threats and ready to act swiftly like a pouncing eagle, or to try to gradually build support for these things through a fierce media campaign while optimizing our industry for wartime production.

All Americans will have to take part in making this dream a reality, and dancing around it only puts our precious liberty and our aspirations further at risk. The draft must be reinstated, and better now while we are at relative peace so that people get used to it, than when our country is already bleeding and struggling in war. Let us set up a task force with the Pentagon and census department to determine our drafting capabilities, and begin contracting factories to produce kits for a greatly expanded military machine.

Over the last few weeks a number of politicians and generals have approached our administration with ideas of a vast aid package for the military-industrial complex, with the government funding the construction of new arms plants in return for increased control over production. While they are probably paid off with promises of cushy board positions in their retirement from office, that doesn't mean they are wrong.

While we have a good overview of the layout of the ports and garrisons due to them being in the middle of our cities, the Japanese will surely try to reinforce them with Navy and Army elements once they figure out what we are planning. At that point it will be crucial that our Navy elements can position themselves to intercept any Japanese aid force and dissuade them from trying to stage relief landings or shelling the cities.

Let us install heavy naval artillery on islands and shorelines surrounding the ports, with minimal effort to hide it from the Japanese.

However, as the war started going badly for us and especially after Akagi, the Japanese took on another form in the artistic zeitgeist. Uniform, brutal hordes, blood-crazed rapists and slavers who represent all the worst things about tyranny; the Yellow Peril. Some in our party may balk at the racist connotations of these portrayals, but if we employ them strategically and subtly, and contrasted with the "good" Asians we fight to rescue, this can help give our commercials, our posters and our films the edge to really portray our fight not only as one against the illegal and unjust Akagi Accords, but against the vilest of tyrannies yet do dawn over Asia and the Pacific.

Many of the older fighters fought against our own troops once upon a time, and though only the most ancient of the members remember the Spanish, many of the Filipinos saw our actions during and after that war as naked imperialist aggression.

Many of them were released or outright ignored by the Japanese during the war, but in the wake of the Akagi Accords, many of them disappeared, which we thought was due to a purge by the Laurel administration. However, now it seems that dozens of them were warned of the incoming purge and were evacuated by the Luzon-based Hunters ROTC guerrilla group to rural Mindanao. On the basis of the former cadets of the Hunters and surviving Army remnants, they formed the Provisional Government of the Army of Mindanao (PGAM). If we can reconnect them with the old exile government in DC, we have a real shot at restoring a legitimate alternative to the collaborationist regime!

As the guards gave their familiar salute towards the presidential convoy going into the complex, he remained lost in thought, desperately trying to push away what he had come here to do and instead focus on the memories he had made there before. Like that night Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, after having to move heaven and earth to finally deliver the promises of America to so many, and had fallen asleep beside him open bottle of champagne in hand.\n\nThose feelings of warmth were the only thing that powered him to get out of the car and walk over to the calling flame, but even they couldn't defeat the sense of finality that washed over him as he stopped and finally looked towards where his brother rested. All he could do was simply stare and shiver as the memories of fortitude were replaced by ones involving Jack, long pushed down by both repression and the strains of governance. The ferociousness of Hyannis touch football, the giddiness of him winning the VP nomination, the glow of undying loyalty as his Chief of Staff... He wasn't his charismatic, secure self anymore, and with all his remaining strength he took the note he had held in his clenched fist and laid it down next to the dancing flame. He stared at it, as the feelings of utmost anger, sadness, and loss died down inside of him, before abruptly walking back to the limo. Not a word was uttered by the Secret Service as he grasped onto Ethel, as memories of old faded away and the realization that he had finally made his family's legacy whole set in. After years of fighting, scraping, and clawing, he had secured what his brother had died for, what he had fought for every single day since that horrible moment. Tears poured down his cheeks as the limousine drew away, and he said goodbye to Arlington for the last time.\n\nDusk fell. An elderly groundskeeper shuffled between the rows of headstones, tidying them, making sure they would look perfect to the families who would come through those gates in the morning. Checking on the Eternal Flame, he saw a piece of paper. He picked it up, unfolded it, and pondered the words of a grieving brother's soul finally at peace."

USA_scp_the_jackson_presidency_desc:0 "Henry M. "Scoop" Jackson, a native Washingtonian who was denied service to his country during the 40's by the dreadful Democrats, has managed to claw his way to the West Wing of the White House, representing the shining ambitions of the Central branch of the National Progressive Pact in his desire to reforge America into a new, progressive, and powerful state in the entrance of the new decade.\n\nTo describe President Jackson's ambitions and desires for the new administration would take quite a while to detail the intricacies of the politicians mind, and so, he's taken the liberty to summarize it briefly for all to hear: "bombs and welfare." Yes, it may take time and money to get there, but America will soon be rid of the extremists who pull and tear at the seams of the constitution, and be able to walk forward with the power of the military at her fingertips, and a well-off American populace standing there to support her in all she does. Here's to the next four years, everybody!"
USA_scp_welfare_for_the_people_desc:0 "Welfare has always been a tricky spot in terms of legislation for the United States, as some of the harshest critics on the right would proclaim that such actions would spur an economic meltdown while making our citizens lazy. However, one thing is for sure of all people: they wanna feel happy and cared for by their government, and, by God, we'll make it happen!\n\nAcross the country, the poor and hungry continue to scrounge for what they can, scrambling at the bit to make ends meet and eating the scraps that have been left for them. This cannot do, this will not do, for we are America, We the People, for the People! Sure, the economy has always been a delicate balancing act since the end of the Second World War, but we have grown plenty since those days, and it is our intention to prioritize for the lower classes of our country over the banks and the stock markets!"
USA_scp_a_right_not_a_privilege_desc:0 "Oftentimes, American conservatives will speak about social welfare programs as if they're something to be earned. Our administration vehemently disagrees with this notion. The American people deserve a safety net that all can benefit from, and our administration will work to sell that idea, through speeches, ad campaigns, and grassroots organizing. In our America, everyone should be able to reach their potential, free from fear of deprivation or precarity."
USA_scp_contacts_in_the_unions_desc:0 "America's progressive unions have always been an integral part of our political coalition. Their members vote for us, their executives donate to us, and their endorsements have helped our candidates in hundreds of races across the country. We'll need their support again if our agenda is to succeed. Let's have our liaisons reach out to the leadership of unions like the UAW, to advance our administration's priorities and keep our union support strong."
USA_scp_strike_the_fr_desc:0 "The NPP has relied upon its Nationalist branch since the beginning, and in terms of national defense and foreign policy, our faction overlaps with theirs significantly. However, the faction isn't always reliable. At times, they're outright opposed to our policy initiatives. But our administration's influence on Capitol Hill could help to change this. Our congressional liaisons will lean on leadership, getting them to move troublesome Nationalist congresspeople off of important committees, snubbing them at caucus meetings, and using a dozen other tactics to cut the Nationalist influence from the halls of power."
USA_scp_the_two_snakes_desc:0 "While much of the NPP is made up of its Nationalist and Progressive factions, there are those at both ends of the party who go far beyond the mainstream. There are the Nazi-sympathizing Sovereigns, and the outright socialists and communists of the Marxist Caucus. We need to shut them out of the party and make it clear that this sort of destructive extremism has no place in American government. God help us if they ever get near the reins of power."
USA_scp_meet_the_chiefs_desc:0 "President Jackson was elected, in no small part, because of his pledge to support the US military through thick and thin. After all, in the Senate, he was a strident hawk whose military budget requests were legendarily vast. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are surely the experts on what the branches of the military need to thrive in this new decade. Our administration will meet with them and work to improve the United States military through any and all means."
USA_scp_why_we_fight_desc:0 "After all the blood and treasure lost in the wars of the 1960s, America-and the world-needs to know why we have a military. The United States armed forces represent the best of us, standing for freedom and justice in a world so often left wanting for it. We'll have the Pentagon start providing assistance to all sorts of movie and television studios, while simultaneously expanding our direct public relations strategy. America's military might will be known throughout the world in a new way in the 1970s, and if war comes to America, our people will know why we fight."
USA_scp_turn_on_the_hose_desc:0 "We live in an age of technological marvels and strategic opportunity. Everything from satellites to computers to laser-guided munitions will allow our military to achieve incredible things in the field of battle. But to have a more modern, professional, and capable military, we'll need to invest. Officers and specialists will have to be trained. New weapons systems will have to be procured. And all of this will cost quite a bit of money. Fortunately, we were elected with a mandate to expand defense funding. The Pentagon will have all the money it could ask for to build the fighting force of the future."
USA_scp_army_modernization_program_desc:0 "The United States Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps all stand as the building blocks for Lady Liberty's Sword and Shield against the German Eagle to the East and the Rising Sun's grasp across the Pacific. For years, they've recovered proudly and strongly from the sinking defeat of the Second World War, and has helped promise us a future of freedom, liberty, and justice for all; however, it is undeniable that the sword can be sharpened, and the shield can be bolstered. Thus, it's time to introduce a bill to Congress that will handle two of America's biggest issues: education and military quality. The Army Modernization Program.\n\nWith the program in effect, better education standards will be coupled with improved and intensified training methods for members of the United States Army, and may soon be expanded to include all branches of the military. With hope, we will be able to expand the boosts in education towards all of the American public, for the sake of a better tomorrow. After all, smarter people make better soldiers, right?"

scp.1.t:0 "The Seeds That Sprouted Scoop"
scp.1.desc:0 "Frost. Frost crawled its way across the windows of the Oval Office, as President Henry "Scoop" Jackson looked out upon Washington D.C., bearing a warming cup of coffee sat upon the beautifully carved and ancient desk. Surprising? No, for President Jackson had known the chill of frost since his birth as a Washingtonian along the West Coast of the United States. Enlightening? Of course, as Jackson dwelled upon the sources of belief and ideas that had spawned throughout his life, from birth to his swearing upon the Bible.\n\nSure, when you look at the America of today, you can see all the scars of pushing and pulling from partisan politics, of course. But beneath all of that, it was the poor African-American he drove past through the city of Everett, who constantly shivered from frost by any other name, just as frigid. It was the veterans and soldiers he shook hands with, talking about the stories of desperation and the fight for their country they endured as they fought through the Second World War in the Pacific and in England, or, for the younger ones, the plains and savannas of Africa. Hope was what inspired him, as he knew it was possible for this amazing country to be helped even more, no matter how many soldiers or dollars it took. Dollars were what fed the hungry, clothed the naked, cared for the sick, and sheltered the homeless, while soldiers were what stood the wall for America on the frontlines, and made sure the fascists out there didn't take one more goddamn step forward.\n\nA car's lights passing by the wet morning's dew shook the President back to reality, as his hands grasped his mug of coffee, bringing it to his lips. America needed help, to be sure. But its core was golden, and it's time for him to take a stand and ask what he can do for this country. After all, he knew he was the man to do it."

scp.2.desc:0 ""You really think they're going to like us out there, sir? I'll be frank, I'm from the area, Southerners can catch a whiff of fire when it comes to talk of welfare and social programs, sir." Vice President McMath said, as he sat next to the President. "McMath, I want you to know something: I wanted to do my damnedest to fight out there and knock the hell out of the bastards who stood up against our country. And I know you got that chance, so trust me when I say this: now, more than ever, we gotta fight, General."\n\n"Now presenting the man himself, President Jackson, on the future of helping Americans in his Presidency!" The Governor of Kentucky said, before shaking hands with the President, as the crowd came to a roar.\n\n"Good evening, everyone, and thank you for welcoming me to the beautiful countryside of Kentucky! Now, I want you all to know something: in recognizing the greatness of your state and of all Kentuckians within, your state motto comes to mind: 'United We Stand, Divided We Fall.' Now, the very power of the statement calls to mind some of the fights this country has been having within itself; however, I swear upon here and now, that this country is as great as it ever has been, even if it may need your help. That is why I call upon the Bluegrass State's help in moving forward, in helping pick up those who've fallen down on their luck in this country, so that everyone is ready and able to bring about a newer and brighter day for the United States of America! I understand some have raised criticisms and concerns for the cost and whatnot, but mark me, Kentucky: it is our duty, both civil and moral, to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your fellow American, and the only way we can guarantee this is by helping those who lay suffering, no matter the cost!"\n\nThe rest of the night was consumed with a mix of glamor and promises, as far as Vice President McMath was concerned. Sure, he looked into the audience and found his fair share of frowns and scowls; nevertheless, he smiled, knowing damn well the applause that surrounded those fools."
scp.2.a:0 "Together, for America!"

scp.3.t:0 "A Hot Seat in a Hotter World"
scp.3.desc:0 ""You know, I'm trying to cut costs around here for the sake of the country, so I scaled back the President's Chef team for some Dunkin' Donuts instead, hope that works. Besides, that wheat shit they brought me sucked." President Jackson said, earning a stream of chuckles and laughs from members of his State Department and Department of Defense. The men and women in the room began to laugh as they finished their early morning breakfast, shaking hands with the President.\n\n"Now, now, let's get to starting this meeting. As I'm sure all of you are aware, the National Progressive Pact gets elections for promises of change, and for promising a better, stronger America, since it needs it now more than ever, with the Japanese and the Germans nipping at our heels. So, we gotta show them what we stand for: everything that gets done in this room, every decision made, every hand shook, every thought that passes through our mind, it all has to back one principle: Evil must, and will, be met with force. There's no room for détente when the people we have to work with have butchered and beheaded the fathers and grandfathers of the families of Americans out there, and there's no way in Hell that I could respect myself for shaking hands with a Nazi or an Imperial. This goes for all of you, by the way. Wohlstetter, you're leading the Department of State, and I want you to make sure that every diplomat, ambassador, and embassy out there knows that we aren't going to be the kid that gets shoved around in the world anymore. Admiral Burke, you're in charge of the Department of Defense, and rest assured, those brave sons of America out there are not going to be forgotten about. We're not going to leave a single Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine uncared for, and in exchange, we're going to be making sure that they hoist the stars and stripes wherever we can. We're not taking one step back, ladies and gentlemen, not at all."\n\nWith a few handshakes and nods, everyone went off to work. Jackson knew, in his heart, that America wasn't going to be backing down for the next four years."

scp.4.t:0 "Lunch"
scp.4.desc:0 "Every Friday, the cafeteria of the mid-sized "Graphic Image" studio is just bustling with activity. Dozens of young creatives enjoy their brief period of recreational time and eagerly yearn for the long-awaited weekend. The food's good, too - today, a selection of sandwiches coupled with complimentary salads got served. At one table, Drew White sat with his colleague Edward Andrews and enjoyed his well deserved lunch break. Turning to Edward, he attempted to instigate some small talk:\n"I gotta say, this egg sandwich is pretty darn tasty. Anyways, how's progress on these new posters? I heard that you apparently had some really fantastic ideas for them." Edward could muster nothing but a tired shrug. For a moment, it seemed like he would say nothing at all - but then, the words just started to pour out of him like water from an overpressurized hose.\n\n"Oh, I'm almost done with them. It's just the same thing over and over, y'know. The Japanese octopus spreads its tentacles all over the Pacific is a classic motive, then you have a scary skull wearing one of these Nazi hats - lately, I even combined these two to create a Nazi skull with tentacles coming out of it's holes. It's pretty cliched at this point, but it gets the people going, I guess."\nHe paused for a few seconds, lowered his voice to a barely audible mutter, and continued. "This whole project is just so utterly depressive. When I went to college and got my degree in graphic design, I wanted to be a visionary. I wanted to design groundbreaking masterpieces that make people reassess how they view life itself. Now, I'm reduced to some kind of factory monkey pumping out the same three motifs to whip the masses into a warmongering frenzy. I'm nothing but a discount Goebbels, and I utterly despise myself for it."\n\nSilence. Drew, who has never been good at comforting people, attempted to defuse the situation: "Well, I - I understand your problems, buddy. Try eating one of these egg sandwiches, maybe that'll make you feel better.""

scp.5.t:0 "Friends Help Each Other Out"
scp.5.desc:0 "Audie Hoggard looked out into the field, with the sun rolling downwards as a beautiful red shade dawned upon the sky, with the day coming to a close above the lush, green fields of Quantico, Virginia. "They say the Program's gonna help out all active and reserve members of the military, and help out veterans as well. They even say it's gonna help their kids, I mean, shit, what a way to kick off the end of senior year, you know?" Audie had a few other friends there, Jodie Swaine, Cliff Haines, and Roy Norris. Everyone perked up at Audie's words, except for Roy.\n\n"Pfff, yeah, y'all get to enjoy y'all's lives in college, I get it. Guess who gets to work all of next year?" Roy said, lighting a cigarette while laughing.\n\n"Hey, lay off, Roy, things are just looking up for us is all." Cliff said.\n\n"Of course you'd say that, you little hopeful dipshit. Not everyone's lives are as perfect as the shining pupil, bootlicking military brats you all are." Roy said, squinting at Cliff. Audie looked back, seeing Jodie's face meet the ground, as memories of her crying to him about her father being caught up in an artillery strike near Bloemfontein, and the horror he saw as he saw her dad resting in a hospital, talking to Jodie, missing an arm and having half of his face charred. Audie knew that Roy had it tough at home sometimes, and that all of them had suffered, but Audie realized he decided to make a choice.\n\nAt that moment, he didn't care.\n\nAudie's fist cracked against Roy's nose, sending a splatter of blood and dropping Roy to the ground. "What the fuck is wrong with you? God you're all fucking nuts." he said, clutching his nose while flicking the cigarette at Audie before he stormed off. The sting of regret pinched Audie's heart in that moment, but when he turned and saw Jodie cleaning off that tear going down her face, and Cliff giving him a slight smirk, Audie had an entirely different thought all together."

He's lucky the mirror didn't crack, as it fell from the wall and bounced on the carpeted floor.\n\n"Henry, what the fuck was that, don't go busting shit up just cause you're mad!" cried his roommate, Private Wallace Deacon, as he ripped him back.\n\n"Don't tell me what the fuck to do, man!" screamed Prescott, as he went and laid down on his bed.\n\n"Look, I get it. I've been wanting to get a good education all my life, I've been wanting to be an engineer ever since I could hold a fucking wrench, I get it. The Army Modernization Program was gonna help us all out, get that education we all want, and the government fucked us. We can't go busting holes in things just cause we're mad about it though, Henry." Private Deacon said.\n\nBut Private Prescott couldn't relinquish his anger, nor the dents he's already caused in the room. He thought about back home in Virginia, where he wanted to work with kids, get them therapy, help them with their issues, he was always just a few hundred off from affording a college career, however. But dejection and disillusionment was all he could feel, as he looked up and saw President Jackson looking just as disappointed and pissed off as he was."
