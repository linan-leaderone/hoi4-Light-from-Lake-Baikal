 ##LEADER DESCS##

 POLITICS_OTTO_WEIDINGER_DESC:0 "The slave revolt has sown chaos and destruction across the Reich's eastern territories, but nowhere has been hit as hard as Kaukasia. A land famed for its brutal treatment of slave and native alike, the fires of rebellion burnt hot and fast here, shredding the old order in a furious maelstrom. The final vestige of German administration retreated to Baku, the heart of the Reich's oil production, and was forced to rely on corporate bought mercenaries to replace the shattered garrison. It was to be their undoing.\n\nOtto Weidinger is no bureaucrat. He is a soldier, plain and simple. An SS man turned mercenary, Weidinger has spent the better part of his life criss-crossing the east with his mercenary bands, aiding whatever buyer needed him for the right price. From putting down partisans to defending corporate holdings, Weidinger has seen it all- the quintessential mercenary, on par with Siegfried Müller. However, if there's one thing Weidinger has no experience in, it's running a nation. That's where the companies come in.\n\nWeidinger is nothing more than a figurehead for the real administrative powers- the companies. Oil companies, tungsten companies, all sorts of corporations have come together behind Schörner's promises of a return to the days of glory. Their influence over the Caucauses has ousted the pro-Germania government, placing Weidinger on top and giving him the power he needs to deal with these pesky slaves. Weidinger himself has no qualms with his situation- a fat paycheck and full control over the company soldiers in addition to his normal band would be enough for him without helping return Germany to its glory days. With the latter as well, this may as well be his dream gig- assuming he can maintain it."

 DFK_Funding_from_the_Shadows:0 "Funding from the Shadows"
 DFK_Funding_from_the_Shadows_desc:0 "From shadowy depths emerge pouches filled with coin, and Weidinger is more than happy to snatch them. In order to maintain their rule over Baku in the Caucasus, the Deutsches Freikorps is receiving secret funding from powerful corporations and the Marshal of Moskowien himself, Ferdinand Schörner."
 DFK_Band_of_Brothers:0 "Band of Brothers"
 DFK_Band_of_Brothers_desc:0 "Other than blood and heritage, the only thing that can bond men together is war. The Deutsches Freikorps are a band of mercenary soldiers who have fought alongside each other through thick and thin, bantering in hours of peace and falling before their brothers in times of battle. The Freikorps are united together by the flames of war, and nothing will break them apart."
 DFK_Rule_of_the_Mercenaries:0 "Rule of the Mercenaries"
 DFK_Rule_of_the_Mercenaries_desc:0 "Baku lies under the chaotic leadership of the Deutsches Freikorps, a band of vicious German mercenaries with no experience of state administration. Due to the nature of such a mercenary government Baku has become highly militarized, and its extreme instability - both socially and politically - is of no surprise to anyone."
