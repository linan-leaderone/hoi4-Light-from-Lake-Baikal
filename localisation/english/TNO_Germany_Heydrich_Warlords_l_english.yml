 POLITICS_Felix_Steiner_DESC:0 "No, God, no. They have to stop, end the fighting, end the rivalries, end the tension. Or else we're all dead.\n\nFelix Steiner was born just at the turn of the century within his native Germany, at the perfect time to become embroiled by the First World War, where he fought and bled to earn his Iron Cross, both first and second classes. However, just because some papers were signed in Versailles did not mark the end of the war for Steiner, as he enleagued himself with the Freikorps paramilitary and molded himself within the path to militarism. Taking up arms within the eventually-formed Schutzstaffel, Felix Steiner would find himself crowned with the administrative power to form the Fifth SS-Panzer Division Wiking, made up solely of Scandinavian volunteers to the Waffen-SS, who would march to victory in the East alongside its Fatherland.\n\nAfter the war, however, Felix Steiner would come to know the nooses of National Socialist bureaucracy quickly, powerfully, and dangerously. Being assigned away from the volunteer Division he fathered, Steiner found himself administering over the active servicemen and the veterans of the Schutzstaffel, Waffen-SS, and even the Wehrmacht. During the era of crisis that would strangle the former prestige of the Reich, Steiner would come to know a closeness towards all servicemen of the Reich, believing their delve into the warrior spirit to earn anyone favor as an Aryan soldier, be they from the Schutzstaffel or the Wehrmacht. Some looked disfavorably upon this egalitarian notion; however, Steiner himself felt satisfied in cleaning up accusations of crimes during and after the war for many of the servicemen he served himself.\n\nHowever, an era of crisis would breed an era of fire. Now, the Deutsche-SS and the forces of the Ordensstaat butcher each other in the streets, and Steiner only has so many pawns to use in this game. The members of the Schutzstaffel and Wehrmacht that he's untied in his state are at a constant pin drop away from opening fire upon one another. A cost he cannot afford when he's attempting to weather Heydrich's and Himmler's storms on both sides."

With the liberal use of hostages, coercion, blackmail, kidnapping, and more, Steiner has, for the moment, secured and largely pacified his holdings. Though his position is tenuous at best, the large body of SS and Wehrmacht soldiers at his beck and call ensures Steiner's continued rule."

It is time to put petty squabbles between the Wehrmacht and SS aside; it is time to unify the rest of the Fatherland in glorious battle, purchased honestly with our blood!"

An ardent Sudeten-German Nazi, not so much a fiery populist as an ordinary everyman, Henlein officially joined the Party after the occupation in 1938, and was soon appointed Reichsstatthalter of the Sudetenland. It was here where his fateful rivalry with Heydrich began- a rivalry which he would eventually come out the loser, passed over for promotion after promotion as Heydrich ascended higher and higher. For years Henlein toiled, never getting that promotion to Gauleiter he always coveted, watching as Heydrich rose to leader of the German-SS- and then Führer.\n\nEven so, perhaps Henlein would have still worked with Heydrich against Himmler in the split- had Heydrich not completely passed over his head with plans, leaving him in the dark. The last straw having broken, Henlein turned his gaze to Burgundy- but they showed little interest in courting him either. Therefore, Henlein has concluded his only path is to grow as radical as he can, reviving the old ideas of Lebensraum and Lebensborn, forcing mandatory training and drills- all in an attempt to exude Aryan qualities from his lands, making him as appealing to the Reichsführer as possible.\n\nHenlein prepares his men for war- for he knows this is the only shot he may ever have to get that promotion he's been aching for for so long."

 POLITICS_Klaus_Barbie_DESC:0 "The Butcher of Lyon makes his new home in Danzig, bringing his old troops, his old ideas, his old means- but new, fresh amounts of blood.\n\nMany words come to mind when the name Klaus Barbie is brought up, and few of them are good. A Gestapo and SS functionary during the war, Barbie made his name on wholesale slaughter, keeping the French in check during the occupation. Such cunning brutality quickly brought him to the forefront of SS operations, and his drive- and promotions- never slowed. Soon, he was sent to Germany by direct order of the Reichsführer, a critical part of Heydrich's support in East Prussia- and an eye kept on the protégé.\n\nOnce the Bürgerkrieg was won, Barbie was reassigned to Danzig, ordered to keep his eye on Heydrich under the guise of "Anti-Partisan actions"- a move that has paid off in full, as Heydrich splits from Himmler and Germany breaks apart again. Barbie's hold on Danzig and the surrounding area remains stable, even in these troubled times- and with native partisans to the north, potential treachery to his south and west, and few allies to the East, his determination has only grown.\n\nBarbie is the unshakeable eye of Himmler's forces, a siphon of intelligence and codes. The SS-Standartenführer does all he can to deliver the information that Himmler expects of him, and he doesn't mind torture, murder, kidnapping, arson, or any other unsavory method to do it. Indeed, there's a reason the Reichsführer puts such trust in him- with his focus on ideological purity, it seems likely he'll stay with the founder of the System. However, if some misstep occurs, and he begins to have doubts of Himmler's intentions, it would certainly do Heydrich much good to shut down such a wealth of stolen secrets- and, perhaps, use them for his own ends.\n\nOlder, wiser, but still as cunning and brutal as he ever was, there's no doubt that Barbie is one of the most dangerous men in Germany today, no matter what happens around him."

There is only one response to this ludicrous sense of national pride, and that is found at the end of a rifle.\n\nKlaus Barbie, the Butcher of Lyon and the leader of the Intelligence Operation in Danzig, has thoroughly trained his men and aides in the art of suppressing those who would see themselves lifted above the Aryan race. So brutal are the methods of Barbie and his compatriots that it is an ongoing debate whether he means to scare the Poles into submission with his savagery, or if he intends to wipe out the race once and for all.\n\nLeft to their own devices in Eastern Europe, these anti-partisan soldiers will certainly do more than just collect intelligence."

 POLITICS_LEON_DEGRELLE_DESC:0 "Leon Degrelle began his political career as the leader of the Rexist movement within Belgium, a far-right, Catholic political party, heavily influenced by Fascist and Corporatist thought. During the war, Degrelle proclaimed Rexism to be a close friend of National Socialism, choosing to collaborate with the occupiers of Belgium and join the Wallonian Legion, quickly rising up within the ranks of this organization to become its leader. After the war ended, Degrelle became responsible for the rule and control of much of southern Belgium under the Reich, as one of the most influential collaborators in all of the Einheitspakt.\n\nNow, with Wallonia fully integrated into Heinrich Himmler's Ordenstaat, Degrelle continues to exercise control over the lands as commander of the SS-Wallonien collaboration brigade. Though Degrelle has competently and ably served the Ordenstaat in their adoption and application of the Burgundian system, the Reichsführer-SS has grown suspicious of the Belgian. With how important Degrelle has grown, however, Himmler has been unable to get rid of him without proof that the man is plotting something."
 
 POLITICS_LEON_DEGRELLE_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Who would have thought that Leon Degrelle would have made it this far? Not many, least of all the man himself- but he's here now, and he has one chance to succeed.\n\nLeon Degrelle was torn on the German invasion at first, along with his party, but he grew into one of their most ardent collaborators with time. An Iron Cross recipient, a war hero, and a proud advocate of the Wallonian people, suffice it to say that Degrelle was heavily displeased with the news that his lands were to be put under the control of Heinrich Himmler and his acolytes- a displeasure that has only grown with time, as Himmler's spartanist Aryan ideal ground Wallonian culture and independence into the dirt.\n\nAt first, Degrelle tried to covertly undermine Himmler's work, subtly stocking arms and preparing his men for an uprising. This was revealed, despite his efforts to keep it hidden, and Degrelle and his men have been on the run ever since. Even as they have succeeded in hiding from the SS brigades that hunt for them so far, Degrelle thought it was only a matter of time until they found him, he and his men were playing for time- that is, until the Ordensstaat collapsed in spectacular fashion, and a faint hint of hope broke through.\n\nIn the chaos of the split, Degrelle and his men have seized Wallonia from Himmler's clutches, setting up their forces for the inevitable counterattack. There is only one hope for the Walloon Division now- to fight off Himmler's and the other factions' assault together. If, for whatever reason, this endeavor fails, then Degrelle and the Walloon Division will certainly die- and Wallonia may go with them."

All the rest are dead, missing, or tied to the SS. The admiral who terrorized the Allies with his Wolfpacks, Dönitz has once again evaded those who wish him harm- and there are many who do in this new Germany. His family, however, has not been so lucky- his sons slaughtered in the World War, his wife passing away a few years ago, and his daughter and son-in-law almost certainly brutalized, trapped behind SS lines. His outward displays of the calm and powerful war hero, friend of Hitler and destroyer of the Reich's foes, hide the tired, beaten-down man below.\n\nIt's no wonder that the Admiral has created a council below him to deal with the pressing affairs of the day- he gives them a face, and they give him power. As such, Hamburg stands as a spot of relative calm- though the SS whirls at its doorstep, and will crush it if they can, at least someone sane is running the ship.\n\nAll is not well below decks, however, as two sides clash in the aging Admiral's head. One side, the prideful war hero, fights to stand his ground- to cement the Kriegsmarine not just as the forgotten arm of the Heer, but as a true force in Germany and an island of sanity in the storm. The other, the tired old man, wishes nothing more than to use the Kriegsmarine as a gateway north- for the refugees that crowd the city streets, and for himself. It's unclear which Dönitz will win out, but for now, the Admiral makes his last stand."

Operating as an intelligence officer since the early days of the Weimar Republic, Gehlen is attributed in being the man who revolutionized the offices of Germany's intelligence agencies, many would argue that Reinhard Gehlen acted courageously for the sake of the dedicatedly conservative National Socialists of the Reich. However, those within the inside know that, even after the end of the Second World War, Gehlen continued to operate for the sake of himself, as he continued to coalesce the intelligence community under his control more and more, and attempting to rip it away from the claws of Heinrich Himmler.\n\nArbitrary rules, a slowing bureaucracy, and more only showcased Gehlen's continued rise within the Reich. As many as he has inspired within the community, many would harbor a feeling of exhaustion and frustration in regards to Gehlen's operations of the intelligence community. Nevertheless, his stand against Heinrich Himmler and the SS's grabs towards dominating the intelligence operations of the Reich has genesised a following for the Generalleutnant that gave many Speerites and Bormannites a figure to stand behind, especially as the power of the Schutzstaffel within the Reich began to rise, and the shadow of Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich began to overtake the shining light of the Reich for the people of Germany.\n\nNow, Germany stands shattered, with two madmen attempting to claim themselves as the true leaders of National Socialism above Germany slaughtering all who stand in their path to get there.

The youngest of the major figures in Burgundy today, Eriksson joined the SS as soon as he could, swiftly making his way through the ranks of the Langemarck Division. Even if the troubles of the 50's have blunted his once favorable views towards the economic side of things, he remains one of the most driven collaborators in Burgundy today- reliable, useful, and loyal.\n\nHowever, this loyalty is less driven by a personal liking of Himmler, nor even a particular attachment to the System that the Reichsführer endorses, but rather an intense dislike of his southern counterpart, Leon Degrelle. Eriksson knows that, should he be removed from his position of power, Degrelle and the Walloons will waste no time in seizing Flanders for themselves- something that he refuses to allow. As such, the leader of the Langemarck Division has used shadier methods to boost his division's strength, making under-the-table deals with Breton traders and falsifying resistance attacks to gain aid and strengthen his side.\n\nNow, with Heydrich's split and Degrelle seemingly wavering on the edge of outright treason, Eriksson sees his opportunity arise- and he has no intention of letting it slip away. Soon, he and his men shall join Himmler's forces in one final, crushing strike against Degrelle and his pack of dogs. Then, and only then, will Eriksson know that he has succeeded in keeping the Flemish way of life safe."

 POLITICS_BERT_ERIKSSON_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "In hindsight, Eriksson never would have aligned himself with Himmler. He accepted the Greater German ideal, but not the eradication of his Flemish heritage and identity. They were supposed to be one of the many Germanic peoples, standing side-by-side against international Jewry and its plutocratic-Bolshevik puppets. If not for the damned coup attempt, which forever sullied the glory of the SS, he could have found succor in the camp of Reichsmarschall Göring, or perhaps the militarist camps of distant Ostland. Too late now, though.\n\nDegrelle and de la Mazière have made their moves, and the French resistance has returned to haunt the SS. There is no hope for the Ordensstaat to survive, and Eriksson knows that his Walloon 'comrade' has designs on Flanders. As if that wasn't enough, Germany will doubtless be looking to reclaim its western conquests, and the Flemish themselves are not enamored of the Langemarck Division.\n\nBert Eriksson had better think of a plan quickly, lest he become a mere footnote in history."

 POLITICS_ULRICH_WEGENER_DESC:0 "Enough is enough. No more hiding in the sewers beneath Germania. No more shivering in the cold nights of the sane citizens of Germany's basements. No more running. No more hiding.\n\nUlrich Klaus Wegener is a new face in terms of leadership within Germany, only having served at the age of fifteen within the last days of the war, being just a mere teenager as he bore witness to the glorious days of victory on the horizon. Young Ulrich was told that Germany would prosper forevermore, knowing not of difficulty or obstacle as it would reign over the globe as the Supreme Master of the World, and no true Sons of Germany would ever suffer again!\n\nBut none of that fucking happened.\n\nInstead, Young Ulrich would bear witness to suffering and hunger, as the German economy crashed. Realizing war was brewing on the horizon, the up-and-coming leader of the Beserkers, Germany's chief Special Forces and Counter-Terrorism unit, aligned himself with Speidel's faction during the Bürgerkrieg in order to stand with some sense of sanity within the German nation at that point; yet, sanity would not win out, would it?\n\nThus began Wegener's true rise to leadership. When he helped lead the anti-militarists into hiding, finding shelter only in the rat-infested shadows as the Schutzstaffel prowled every corner, the Wolf ready to strike at any moment. Now, however, the Wolf Pack finds itself torn apart, each side ripping and tearing at each other's throats. In the midst of this chaos, in the wake of this insanity, in defense against this terror, Ulrich Klaus Wegener stands alone in fighting a double-fronted war, with every side calling for his death. Or so he would believe."

No matter how many need to bleed to do it.\n\nOtto-Adolf Eichmann was born a German, worked as a German, fought as a German, and killed as a German. Originally from Prussia but rising through the ranks of his father's Austrian mining business after being pulled away from school, Eichmann's closest form of solidarity came through the right-wing militias and paramilitaries all of his friends had been talking about, and the bold words of the NSDAP flashing across the Newspaper headlines. Germany was destined for greatness, in young Adolf's mind, and it was his time to participate, and participate he did, as Eichmann was charged with personally sicking the dogs of war, brutal deportation, and genocide against thousands upon thousands of Jews. With the powerlessness of the Allies preventing anything from stopping him, Eichmann bathed in the blood of the Hebrews as a Grand Master and Architect of the most horrific slaughter of Jews the world had ever seen.\n\nHowever, the years of joyful bloodshed were cinched tightly by the collapsing successes of the Reich. Economic mishandlings, military failures in Russia, and a near-collapse of the German government had shaken the entire Aryan spirit, driving Eichmann towards swearing allegiance towards the newly formed Ordensstaat. For, if the Vaterland would trade the sword for the shackle, perhaps the Reichsführer-SS would employ Eichmann where he worked best, as he became the new SS-Obergruppenführer over the SS-Totenkopfverbände, leading the "Death's Heads" to a bloody, new Final Solution.\n\nHowever, all of the successes and accomplishments for Eichmann have come to fold, as the entirety of the Reich finds itself embattled against itself. To the East, the Blonde Beast leads in apocalyptic bookings of doom and despair towards Eichmann's former master, the Reichsführer-SS. Of course, Eichmann could never give into the wishes of someone willing to end the world, if that were true of course, however, a new goal rises upon the horizon. The degenerate Untermenschen surrounds the SS-Totenkopfverbände in broken shackles, and the time has come to reignite the Endlösung."

Nevertheless, as the dawning of Axis victory appeared on the horizon, Hanke never allowed his ambition one step back.\n\nThus began the glory days of the Reich, the days in which the Americans backed off, the French and British were conquered, the Russians were a mere thought upon the hills, and the world became the cornucopia upon which Germany feasted.

However, SS-Brigadeführer Joachim Peiper managed to achieve just that, through scrutiny by some and praise by others. Born right into the heart of the middle of the First World War within the burning heart of the German Empire itself, Berlin. Peiper quickly attracted the likeness of the soon-to-be Reichsführer-SS, who admired the young recruit's Aryan features so much that he was forwarded to SS Leadership training. From those halls would birth the Ravager of the East, the monster who would lead the "Blowtorch Battalion" through Kharkov and into atrocity after atrocity. And with the Reich's victory would come more massacres for the Beast of Berlin.\n\nAs the Reich brought upon a new era of dominance and success, Peiper found himself becoming further engrossed with the esoteric propagandas of the Schutzstaffel, as the dedicated National Socialist came to praise Peiper as a goal, some ideal to achieve. Nevertheless, the Reichsführer-SS held his prized possession close, allowing for Peiper to receive a massive promotion for all of his "duties in the field of combat and leadership, in the recognition to dedication towards the annihilation of degeneracy, and the establishment of a new National Socialist era." Thus, as the celebrity combatant kicked back with a seemingly secure position in the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, Peiper believed that all had turned out well.\n\nAnd, yet, the horrors facing the Reich could never be more dire. With Peiper's former ally, Reinhard Heydrich, now denouncing and rebelling against the Reichsführer-SS, the Butcher of Berlin stands as a meat grinder against all those traitorous cowards refusing the Reichsführer-SS in their attempts to flee to the South, as the bitter, frozen Austrian winter grows colder by the day..."

He and his Brother Generals- Paul Hausser and Sylvester Stadler- each took the stunning revelation of Himmler's plot differently. Hausser refused to believe it, Stadler quietly distanced himself from the Reichsführer, and Gille bought every word of it. Such a disagreement could only end poorly, but Gille was skilled enough to find himself ruler of what remains of his divisions- with Hausser dead and Stadler gone, nobody else is left to challenge him from within.\n\nThe task now turns to stopping and defeating Himmler and his lunatics- before they can follow through on their plans. Gille's men- the brave soldiers of the 19th Waffen Grenadiers- stand ready to aid Heydrich and his allies. The tide must be turned, the Reich retaken, and the Aryan paradise restored- and each and every soldier in the division knows what happens if they fail.\n\nThere can be- will be- no retreat, no weakness, no surrender.

His relative youth did not stop him from joining the SS early, however, joining in 1933. From there, his rise only continued- soon, he was commanding regiments, then divisions, emerging from the War with an Iron Cross and a new rank as Commander of the "Hunyadi" 25th Waffen Grenadier Division- a division made up of Hungarian Nazi's, proud to serve their Führer and the Reich.\n\nStadler has stayed in his post since, but the Reich around him has changed- and not for the better. He, like nearly all other SS higher-ups, stood with Himmler during the West Russian War- and suffered the consequences. Ever since, he worked to aid Heydrich's efforts, helping set the groundwork for his Führership. When the Bürgerkrieg began, Stadler was swift to bring his forces to bear against the others, and stood proudly with his brothers in victory- a short lived one, for then came Heydrich's accusations, and soon after came the split. Stadler himself doesn't quite know what to make of it, but the possibility of the rumors being true tilts him towards Heydrich's side- a position not shared by his Brother Generals.\n\nStadler stands at the head of the Kommandostab now, but his drive to fight has left him- a position shared by his men, who similarly lost that spark that drove them all those years ago. Stadler's main focus now is to move his men back to their homeland, Hungary- and go with them. What happens in Germany behind him is not his concern, though he'll certainly do what he can to get his lands in the right hands. All in all, Stadler stands not as the purist or hardliner he once was, but as a man weary of seeing his men fall before him, wishing for nothing more than the quiet luxury of retirement."

He proudly displays his Iron Cross from those times, now leading the Wiking 5th Panzer Division- a division made primarily of hardline Scandinavian National Socialists. One of the SS officials to avoid purging in the wake of Himmler's failed coup, Hausser continued to bide his time among his allies in the SS, aiding Heydrich's maneuvers where he could and readying his men for the conflict to come.\n\nWith Heydrich victorious, Hausser thought his work was finished- and his men did too. Unfortunately, fate has played a cruel joke on the Reich, and Heydrich- in a feat of supreme lunacy and cowardice- has denounced Himmler on the basis of insane allegations, splitting Germany once more. Hausser and his men proudly stood in favor of the Reichsführer- and were stunned when their brothers, led by Herbert Otto Gille and Sylvester Stadler, refused to stand with them. Things only deteriorated from there.\n\nAt the end of the struggle, Hausser finds himself victorious-but at a steep cost, with his Brother Generals and their forces dead or fleeing. As tragic as this turn is, Hausser knows there's only one man to blame- Heydrich, that snivelling, traitorous worm. This foolish split has cost Hausser much, and the Oberst-Gruppenführer knows how to fix it- with his men, proudly standing with their loyal, true brothers in Germania, ending this treachery once and for all."

Born into a blue-collar household, Mohnke rooted himself within the NSDAP and the Schutzstaffel at the young age of twenty-two, where his military career would bring him into a constant state of dipping and dodging through multiple international accusations of massacres of prisoners-of-war. These slaughterous exploits would see one of the culminations of Mohnke's career, in which a severe air raid over Yugoslavia bombarded Mohnke, leading doctors to ignore the officer's demands that he be released as soon as possible, and choosing to amputate his leg instead. Already a dedicated man, Mohnke's refusal to budge and stubbornness in work engulfed his being in rage towards his new handicapped situation.

Cut him up into pieces, string him up at the gallows, lit his whisper-trail afire... this conspiracy will end!\n\nOtto Remer, once nothing but a Generaloberst, now fancies himself as Field Marshal. Once, the man was third-in-line for the Militarist faction, happily sat behind Reichsmarschalls Hermann Göring and Ferdinand Schörner, Remer now leads from the front, as the main voice of what Militarists remain after Heydrich's victory. Through fiery rhetoric and high position, he has successfully whipped his men into shape, ready to crush the two great threats to the Reich: the Blonde Beast, who has betrayed Germany and now sits to the east, and a much closer, much more insidious foe lurking amidst the shadows of every corner... Ferdinand Schörner.\n\nRemer's old boss has gone missing in the chaos that has engulfed Germany once again, and rumors spread that the erstwhile Field Marshal now uses his power to string treacherous webs to aid Heydrich, the traitor... and, rumor has it, he's focusing his efforts to prey upon Remer's very own domain. This cannot, no, will not be tolerated, and it is the destiny of now-Generalfeldmarschall Otto Ernst Remer to lead the Court of National Order in order to crush every whisper, every potential threat, every mere mention of that rat.\n\nAs Remer's armies march west to confront that bastardous traitor, an internal war rages inside his domain: the Court has and shall continue to search every inch of ground, every home and every building, and all traitors shall be exposed and stomped out. With Himmler's aid, Remer shall crush Heydrich's wayward state, expose and decapitate Schörner's schemes, and-eventually-take the reins of Germany himself.\n\nAnd, when he takes the reins, the old dream of the Militarists-a Reich that spans the globe-will soon be a dream no longer. Nevertheless, no matter how many dreams of conquest stir throughout Remer's legions, a shadow continues to dance around the corners, whispering rumors within Remer's men's ears, and planting the seeds of anti-Himmlerite ideas within their minds, and Remer will not end his Inquisition of the Court until he can end this treachery... the treason of Bloody Ferdinand..."

They shall pay, they will all pay for their crimes against the Fatherland! All of them! But that is for later.\n\nFerdinand Schörner has fought for Germany his entire life, from the hellish battlefields of the Great War to the icy wastes of the West Russian War. He has known suffering and defeat, but not like this. Forced from his stronghold by German soldiers in the dead of night? Never. He has remained underground in Hannover since the collapse of that fat idiot's army, hidden only by the grace of patriots and true National Socialists. But it was not SS cultists searching the city for him, but his own men. When he looked at the portraits of the man tearing Hannover to pieces, it was not Heydrich, but his own subordinate, that perfidious traitor Remer. Schörner organized cells to fight the upstart, but they were cut down faster than they could spread. Remer was almost upon him, soon Schörner would be flushed out and hanged as he had ordered so many others to be hanged... if not for Heydrich.\n\nWith the Blonde Beast's help, Schörner has set things in order. Remer is dead, along with the other traitors in the militarist faction, leaving the Field Marshal in stronger control than ever. He has learned of Himmler's insane plan, and made common cause with his foes Heydrich and Speidel to save the Reich he has always served.\n\nBut Schörner remembers his enemies. His vengeance upon them is merely delayed; once Himmler is dead in a ditch, Schörner shall set everything right, as it should be. Those who tore Germany apart shall learn the reason Bloody Ferdinand earned his sobriquet. All in due time."

Kazimierz Piechowski knows firsthand just how terrible of a fight it all was, and, yet, just how necessary it was, whether it was for belief, for ideology, or just for the chance of a god-forsaken home. Participating within the Polish Boys Scouts as a young boy, Piechowski knew that he was a priority on the target list of the Germans, and once Poland's government fell, he knew it was high-time to move the fight underground. It was long, hard, and brutal, but Piechowski's evasion of the Reich could only go on for so long, as the concentration camps awaited the Pole, and all of his comrades.\n\nBut death hadn't chosen Kazimierz that day, nor any day within the coming years. The suffering was unbearable, the sight of the men, women, and children of his nation being systematically exterminated would have been unbelievable had it not been happening right in front of him. How cold was this world to do this to so many? Piechowski knew that it did not matter, and as the camps were moved to the plantations, he knew that carrying the journey forward was all he could do.\n\nBut now, Germany stands against itself, brutalized by the very barbarians who tore his countrymen to shreds in the past few decades. Both had to be fought against, for some stand of righteousness in this terrible, cold world. But, rumors only grow. Nightmares of a world on fire plague Piechowski, and his deepest fears about who he may be forced to fight alongside grow closer to reality with each coming hour."

Experienced, cynical, and ever-irreputable, the Obergruppenführer has seen much in his years of service to the Reich and the SS, and his eyes have watched dozens of plots pass before them. Accusations of treason or crimes against the Reich, evidence passed hastily in back-door deals, the slow rise and fall- or, in some cases, success- Fegelein has seen it all.\n\nSo, when caught between what little loyalty he possesses to Himmler and the System and Heydrich's frankly ridiculous allegations of the Reichsführer's plots- nuclear armageddon? The end of the world? Please.- Fegelein stuck with his guns. Today, he and his men devote themselves to ending Heydrich's treachery and exposing his falsehoods- through both pen and sword, as they broadcast nationwide urges to leave the traitor and instill the true Spartanist Aryan ideal as devotedly as they fight for it. If there's one thing that the Obergruppenführer is committed to, it's the Aryan paradise he's worked towards for so long.\n\nAnd yet, something tickles at the back of Fegelein's consciousness- What if Heydrich's words are somehow true? Fegelein wants the Aryan ideal, yes, but not by ending the world. It's a good thing Fegelein doesn't root himself to many causes, for if Heydrich backs his words with facts, Fegelein may find it wise to desert- and everyone wants a good propaganda department these days."

Nevertheless, the failures of democracy crashed hard upon Eicke as he fell into poverty and joblessness with the onset of Weimar's corruption and degeneracy; however, that was all until the National Socialist German Workers' Party came along. From then on, it was blood that earned Eicke his medals, be it the blood of his former commander, Ernst Röhm, or be it the blood of every single degenerate, handicapped, or corrupted subhuman that Eicke witnessed die within the concentration camp.\n\nTo Eicke, the German Reich had finally realized that it was strength that it needed for its people, and allowing any of these affronts to the Aryan image live would be an unacceptable slight against Germany's power. After the war, a lifetime of devotion and desire to please Himmler found him as a strong-and-true official within the Deutsche-SS, as SS-Obergruppenführer Eicke, despite his occasionally rocky relationship with Reinhard Heydrich, realized his true potential in destroying any traces of corruption within the Vaterland.\n\nBut, no.

Ernst Kaltenbrunner stands as such a figure, coming from a family of lawyers and carrying that position to its most dastardly ends in enforcing National Socialism within his home of Austria, as it became consumed by Adolf Hitler's Reich.

Becoming an operating inspector of the KZ-Lagers of the German Reich, death flowed from the fingertips of the Austrian to all those deemed unworthy by the German Reich.\n\nThe victory of the German Reich may have granted it a freedom from the death of the Second World War, but it only allowed for the continuation of extermination and annihilation at the hands of Ernst Kaltenbrunner. The Reichsführer-SS deemed Kaltenbrunner's activities to be praiseworthy, despite the criticisms of the decadent liberals of Germany, and realized the usefulness of Kaltenbrunner as both a pawn and an ally. However, the Reichsführer-SS brought Kaltenbrunner closer and closer, even managing to use his power to divert potential enemies from rising within the Reich during the 50's coups, guaranteeing the inspector a spot in the command of the Ordensstaat...\n\nHowever, as Germany shattered under the actions of the supposed traitor Reinhard Heydrich, Kaltenbrunner has found himself dedicated to a new mission for the Reichsführer-SS: survive. Nürnberg has become a city surrounded by enemies, and, realizing what he must do, Kaltenbrunner has extended the activities of KZ-Lager Flossenbürg right up to the borders of city.
