 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_SOBHUZA_II_DESC: "Having inherited the throne when he was merely months old, Ngwenyama Sobhuza II of Eswatini is one of the longest reigning monarchs in the history of the world. He helped see to the full independence of Eswatini in 1953, and today rules skillfully, aligning his interests with those of South Africa against the Germans. Sobhuza II has seen other monarchs be born, be crowned, and be buried, and still he leads his people into one decade after another. It is likely that he will continue to reign for many years to come."

 ### Ideas ###
 SWZ_south_african_kingdom: "South African Kingdom"
 SWZ_south_african_kingdom_desc: "Eswatini has had a tumultuous history over the last few years. The Kingdom was at first anything but, independent in name only under South Africa, and reduced to another exploited province with the rise of the Afrikaaner Volkstaat. However, with the Volkstaat's collapse, Eswatini has reasserted itself as a proper nation and hopes to build a proper nation from the corpse of South Africa."

 SWZ_uncontrolled_nepotism: "Uncontrolled Nepotism"
 SWZ_uncontrolled_nepotism_desc: "For most of its history, power, and money in Eswatini have been with the ruling house of Dlamini, and even through all the chaos of the last few years, this has been the case. As a result, nepotism runs rampant throughout the country's administration, hampering the ability to find skillful civil servants and leaders. This chronic problem has led to weaknesses both in the bureaucracy and the military"
