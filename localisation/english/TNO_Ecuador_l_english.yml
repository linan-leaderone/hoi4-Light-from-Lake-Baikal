 POLITICS_GUILLERMO_FREILE_POSSO_DESC: "After the failure of Gándara to keep his plans under wraps, ended up imprisoned by the government, the United States attempted to distance itself as much as possible from the mess that had become Ecuador.\n\nHowever, plans would change with the fall of the Arosemena cousins and the rise of a decisively anti-American regime, making Washington attempt to rekindle their connections with the army that still had some use, namely Guillermo Freile Posso.\n\nHaving served in the United States Air Force where he gained a reputation as a glory-seeking ace, he was one of the first of many to leave the country in the aftermath of the failed coup, hoping to gain exile for himself in the country where he once served. Bigger plans awaited for him though, with the Americans fearing losing their strategic base in the Galapagos, they would approach him to lead an exile government.\n\nFreile would accept nearly immediately, styling himself as the legal successor to the Arosemena government and drawing plans of the eventual take-over of the mainland. The reality of the situation however would be one much different, with the exile government being utterly reliant on aid from Washington, having nearly no resources and population of its own to muster, all the while having to contain a terribly broad base of support in a bid to retain some international legitimacy."

 ECU_idea_a_puppet_in_all_but_name: "Ecuador Chained"
 ECU_idea_a_puppet_in_all_but_name_desc: "In the sorry state that the Republic of Ecuador found itself in after the Communist Revolution in 1960, the Peruvian invasion couldn't be stopped, with the state collapsing soon thereafter as Velasco fled into exile.\n\nWhat he left behind would become nothing more than a puppet to American and Peruvian interests. Crippling the already weak army, further empowering the oligarchs that had controlled the economy for decades and establishing a new "Democracy" in the stead of Velascos' de-facto dictatorship that served as a continuation of his regime only without him as its head.\n\nDespite the best tries by many in the government to fix this, they found themselves unable to salvage the sorry state, either due to incompetence or shell lack of means to achieve their goals, leading to most turning away from the regime and to more extreme parties that promise a rebirth of the nation."
 ECU_idea_communist_underbelly: "The Spectre Of Communism"
 ECU_idea_communist_underbelly_desc: "In the aftermath of the Communist Revolution of 1960 and the subsequent invasion of Peru, the Revolutionaries had to retreat to the jungles of the Amazon where they would regroup and prepare for their next move.\n\nHowever, the future would be bright for those wishing to bring Socialism to Ecuador. With Velasco on another continent far away and the puppet Peruvian government only worsening the living standard of more and more citizens, the Revolutionaries turned into the face of Ecuador's future and the only ones that could truly oppose Peru, greatly growing in popularity as droves of people began joining them.\n\nControlling most land of Ecuador outside of the capital, the spectre of the Revolution lingers constantly on the heads of Quito as it inches itself closer and closer with every day."
 ECU_idea_the_wolves_from_outside: "The Wolves from Outside..."
 ECU_idea_the_wolves_from_outside_desc: "Across a continent stands a constant reminder of Ecuador's past and the threat to its future. Bringing his government to Iberia in the aftermath of the invasion by Peru, Velasco utilized his friendship with the Spanish to set up a government in exile.\n\nThere he would change his approach to politics, taking cues from Peron and doubling down on his populism. Uniting under him many politicians, both in exile and on the mainland that wish for his return, he stands as a constant threat to any Ecuadorian regime that is not completely built around his person."
 ECU_idea_and_the_wolves_from_within: "...And the Wolves from Within"
 ECU_idea_and_the_wolves_from_within_desc: "With the many issues of Ecuador, one would believe that the pitiful army that it boasted would not be one of them, but that would be anything but the case.\n\nThanks to the sorry state that the government found itself in, abandoned by Peru in all but name, antagonistic to the US and bent to the will of the oligarchs, the weak army still stood as what kept total anarchy and a collapse to the Revolutionaries from taking place.\n\nThat however did not mean, by any stretch of the imagination, that the army was supportive of the government. On the contrary, the army simply stood complacent to the government, with rumours of backdoor negotiations between itself and the Americans in reference to their support of a possible coup, many begin to wonder how long the farcical Republic has to live."

 ECU_idea_vencir_o_morir_desc: "The Revolution against the Arosemena government is nothing but the first step for Aguirre and his fellow Revolutionaries. With the final goal of bringing Communism to its neighbouring nations, the country prepares itself against the guaranteed future invasion by Peru.\n\nUniting nearly every Ecuadorian against the Imperialism of the nation that had crushed the hopes of the nation not once but twice in the last 20 years, even ones that do not agree with the Revolutionary government are siding with it against Peru."
 ECU_idea_alianza_para_el_progreso: "Alianza para el Progreso"
 ECU_idea_alianza_para_el_progreso_desc: "While the First Ecuadorian Revolution in 44' had implemented much-needed reforms to the state, these were reverted over time as Velasco walked back on his many promises to the people, with whatever policies that remained being revoked by the Peruvian puppet government.\n\nThus, the various Revolutionary parties came together to organize a coalition with the purpose of bringing the changes needed for the people of Ecuador to finally have a future."
 ECU_idea_true_home_of_the_revolution: "The True Home of the Revolution"
 ECU_idea_true_home_of_the_revolution_desc: "Cuba was meant to be the home of Communism in the Americas, the state to export the Socialist Revolution to the continents. Instead, Castro would turn it into a puppet to the interests of the capitalist pigs in Washington, bowing down to them so that he could remain in power.\n\nDue to this few, if any, Ecuadorian Revolutionaries supported Cuba, seeing Castro as nothing more than another Velasco who'd betray the ones that put him in power at the first chance he'd get.\n\nThis thus meant that the revolution needed a new home, with Ecuador embracing that role, bowing to no imperialists, be they American or Japanese, promoting fellow parties at any chance available."
 ECU_idea_a_non_partisan_government: "A Non-Partisan Government"
 ECU_idea_a_non_partisan_government_desc: "While the many parties of the state proposed various governments and ministers to the military in the aftermath of the coup under the guise of returning Ecuador to a Civilian Administration, all of these were refused.\n\nWith the military refusing to align itself with any particular party or ideology, choosing instead to adopt an apolitical approach to governing the country in order to guarantee that it would be able to pass any and all possible reforms needed.\n\nHowever, this non-partisan stance requires that the parties, at the very least, don't directly oppose the military government and its actions, something that might very well be the more radical the reforms taken are." 
 ECU_idea_shifting_tides: "Shifting Tides"
 ECU_idea_shifting_tides_desc: "It is no secret that the military government of Gándara had been brought up by the Americans, with these enabling and backing the coup against the Arosemena government.\n\nHowever, that does not mean, by any stretch of the imagination, that the military truly wishes to work closely with the United States. Knowing the American involvement in the prior invasion by Peru and their unwillingness to back Ecuador's claims over their lost territory, many see Washington as nothing more than an ally of convenience.\n\nNone agree with this more than the Head of the Junta itself, having studied in Italy during the Second World War and in Iberia during the late 40s and mid 50s, Gándara stands as a strong voice in favour of the influence of the former Triumvirate countries in Ecuador.\n\nFor the time being though Ecuador needs the Americans, though for how long that is to remain the case eludes many, especially if a future military conflict would come to take place between Ecuador and its Southern Neighbour."
 ECU_idea_pragmatism_above_all: "Pragmatism Above All"
 ECU_idea_pragmatism_above_all_desc: "If the government of the Arosemena cousins could be described in a sentence it'd be "woeful incompetence in the face of overwhelming odds".\n\nDespite many of its members partaking in it with the best of hopes for the country, they wouldn't be able to do anything to change the downward spiral that Ecuador found itself in, having to bend the knee to forces above itself.\n\nThe military however only has Washington to follow orders from, and with these giving a broad greenlight to the many reforms that Ecuador needs, the government will pragmatically address all of these issues and act accordingly to secure Ecuador the future it deserves."
 ECU_idea_el_plan_quinquenal: "El Plan Quinquenal"
 ECU_idea_el_plan_quinquenal_desc: "Drowning in loans and reparations, Ecuador found itself utterly unable to meaningfully invest in its own country under the prior administration, being forced to spend what little money it made on foreign debt collectors.\n\nWhile deals with the Americans and Peruvians were attempted to ease this situation, its negotiations would all but result in diplomatic humiliations, setting the country back even further.\n\nBut now with the US backing Gándara and his administration, new solutions were found for the economic issues of the country. With debt repayments being halted and reparations to Peru cut, alongside massive investments in the form of massive low interest loans, the government has begun massive investment programs in infrastructure to try and kickstart the dying economy.\n\nThese investments, while of incredible boon to the country, are only temporary and rolled out in a five year plan form, making the future where these will be over and their debt repaid an uncertain one in the eyes of many."
 ECU_idea_our_iberian_friends: "Our Iberian Friends"
 ECU_idea_our_iberian_friends_desc: "In the aftermath of growing Iberian influence over the American Continents and the rise of the notion of Hispanidad amongst its various countries, Velasco found an ally for Ecuador in its former colonial overlord.\n\nInvesting in the country and growing to become one of its largest trading partners before the Coup of 1960, Iberia would give exile to the Caudillo and host his supporters, supporting them in their bid to return to power in their homeland.\n\nIts efforts would pay off as after Velasco's return to power, Iberia would become the single largest trading partner and investor in the country, coming to dominate its economy as its companies would flood Ecuador's markets with cheap goods.\n\nWhile this has been proven to jumpstart the economy of the state, as employment and living standards rose, Iberias aid is not one out of pure benevolence, instead of out its own interests in the country and region, making any overt reliance on them dangerous for the government and country as a whole."
 ECU_idea_populism_and_progressivism: "Populismo y Progresismo"
 ECU_idea_populism_and_progressivism_desc: "No two better words can describe Velasco Ibarra better than Populism and Progressivism.\n\nHaving come to the forefront of Ecuadorian politics in the aftermath of the Glorious Revolution in 1944, Velasco would rule uninterrupted for more than 15 years through his clever use of populist and progressive policies, uniting both Conservatives and Socialists under his wing.\n\nWhile this approach to politics wouldn't save him from eventually being ousted, it would be the reason he would be invited back, being hailed as a Hero by the people and serving as a unifying figure for a country that was breaking at the seams.\n\nHowever, with the Left radicalised after the Arosemena government and the Right defanged after the seizure of goods from the oligarchs, it remains to see if Velasco will be able to continue to exert as much pull and weight in the future, or if he will fall on top of his carefully built house of cards."
 ECU_idea_public_enemy_number_one: "Public Enemy Number One"
 ECU_idea_public_enemy_number_one_desc: "Ecuador has one enemy, one entity that has haunted it for centuries and humiliated it twice over the past 20 years alone, Peru.\n\nNo other country has haunted the collective conscience of the people of Ecuador quite as much as Peru, with its people looking down and taking any chance to belittle their smaller Sister Republic.\n\nOr at least that's the narrative pushed by Velasco, painting Peru as the source of all wrong in the country, the one corrupting element that has stopped Ecuador from becoming prosperous and a great nation within South America.\n\nEmbarking on a massive propaganda campaign to unite the people against this common enemy, Velasco has ramped up funding in the army, hiring Iberian and Italian advisors to aid with its modernisation, all with the goal of defeating the sworn enemy of his nation and restoring the honour to Ecuador."

However, the position of Prime Minister had not been given on those grounds alone, with his Reformist and Modernising attitude making the appointment work.\n\nSurrendering more and more to the state to the oligarchs in a bid to gain their support for his goals, would tremendously weaken the country's economy and increase corruption, significantly worsening living conditions for the majority of the population.\n\nThose sacrifices he forced onto others were worth it though, for the sake of the nation and its future. That future though would be whisked away as the President would ruin the negotiations between the state and the Americans, forcing the Prime Minister to act and meet with the Peruvians to at least guarantee the nation a single victory.\n\nHowever, much like his cousin, he would ruin these negotiations, refusing to compromise with Peru, causing them to call off the talks and ruining any possibility of decreasing the reparations the state was forced to pay, possibly sealing its dark future in stone.§!"
 ECU_Reynaldo_Varea_Donoso_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nDespotism§!\n--------------\n§LReynaldo Varea Donoso is not a diplomat. He is nothing much more than a loyal stooge, willing to be a yes man at all times, doing as his President and Prime Minister order him and asking little to no questions afterwards. Such was the case in both negotiations with the Americans and Peruvians, when the Arosemena cousins would destroy any possibility for the regimes to stand on better terms, with Varea being blamed for the failures of both.\n\nBut while some would resign for this, it mattered little for the Foreign Minister, to him the most essential things were his position alongside the money that came with it.§!"

Much akin to the Prime Minister, Intriago would do so not out of a sense of self-preservation, but instead a wish to better the lives of its people, having grown disillusioned with the lacklustre policies of Velasco.\n\nHe would, however, be utterly incapable of doing anything akin to what he wished. With the economy being under the tight control of the oligarchs' thanks to the backdoor deals of the Prime Minister, the state lacked the means to implement any substantial reform of any sort.\n\nRefusing to give up he would attempt to salvage the state through the negotiations with America and Peru, hoping that the first would give the desperately needed funding the state craved and the second would cut down its tremendous reparations. However, much to his lament, negotiations with both would prove unsuccessful and Ecuador would be abandoned with its economic future dym, to say the least.§!"

A constant reminder that despite being incredibly weak after its neutering by the Peruvians, the institution still needed to be respected.\n\nHowever, that feeling was not mutual, with nearly none in the military paying anything but lip service to the government, as Gándara did nothing but serve as a glorified rubber stamp, with the lack of American support and the threat of another Peruvian intervention making any sort of governmental intervention null.\n\nThe failed talks between the Americans and the government would change that. With rumours that Washington had begun to enter backroom talks with the army, giving their support of a coup, many wonder how long it'll take for the military to strike, or if the rumours will stay as nothing but gossip.§!"

 POLITICS_CARLOS_AROSEMENA_MONROY_DESC: "Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy was born into the political elite of Ecuador, but instead of relying on it, he chose to fight against it. Joining politics in the early 50s, backing Velasco and its populist party, he would achieve some political success, however, still a minimal one when contrasted with ambitions.\n\nAfter decades of ostracising the Left more and more, coming to rely on the establishment to keep his power, Velasco had become deeply unpopular with the people. Thus, in the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the Socialist Revolutionaries of Ecuador launched their own uprising in 1960, taking a hold of the country and driving Velasco and his government to Iberians that supported him for so long. The Revolutionary Government however wouldn't last, with the Peruvians crossing the border and stamping out the fires of the revolution, setting up a puppet government in its wake.\n\nNone that fled into exile and few of the ones who remained after the revolution showed a willingness to collaborate with the people that had stolen half their land in a bloody war not two decades prior, Arosemena Monroy however was not one of those people. Out of the will to protect himself and his country, the politician would gather as many collaborators as he could manage and present a cabinet to the Peruvians, one that they would be forced to accept out of nothing else but pure necessity as Washington had begun pressuring them to return the region to civilian rule.\n\nHis rule would, however, be characterised by his inability to enact any significant reforms, being bound by the Oligarchs that ran rampant after decades of being enabled by Velasco now further empowered by Lima. With even the things under his control resulting in failures for the President, with his "drinking habits" ending a diplomatic meeting between Quito and Washington in disaster and national humiliation, leading many to wonder how long the President will be able to last in power."
 POLITICS_MANUEL_AGUIRRE_DESC: "In the eyes of Manuel Agustín Aguirre Rios, the First Ecuadorian Revolution of 44' had been usurped by the Conservative counter-Revolutionaries, with Velasco serving as their head, infiltrating the reforms of the Caudillo to stop them from going far enough and stringing him along only to throw him out in the end. For Aguirre, Velasco was nothing but a stepping stone on the path to the true Ecuadorian Revolution.\n\nThis view however wouldn't be accepted by all, as many still revered the Caudillo and his reforms. This was best seen in the Second Ecuadorian Revolution in 1960, where the people, outraged by the removal of their leader, rallied behind the Partido Comunista del Ecuador and Ricardo Paredes Romero to bring down the Oligarchs that betrayed the state with the help of Che Guevara. However, as infighting began over the return of the Caudillo to lead the state, the country would be invaded by Peru, trialling and executing Paredes and chasing Guevara out.\n\nWhile Aguirre and his Partido Socialista Revolucionario del Ecuador were small forces before the Second Revolution, they would take centre stage in the rebuilding and reorganising of the Revolutionaries as much of his opposition fled to join Velasco after the Peruvian invasion, wholly embracing Guevarism and beginning to wage guerrilla warfare against both Peru and Ecuador from the jungles of the Amazon, waiting for the right time to strike.\n\nWith the people hungry, the army divided and the government in peril in the aftermath of the Colombian refugee crisis and the failed army coup, the PSRE would pound the state, launching multiple popular uprisings all over the country and seizing important government buildings and taking control of the country once more and declaring the Third Ecuadorian Revolution. Proclaiming the birth of the Socialist Republic of Ecuador, Aguirre calls upon the various Revolutionary parties of the country to unite under him and his regime, preparing for future reforms and conflicts."
 POLITICS_JOSE_IBARRA_DESC: "No other figure had dominated Ecuador quite like José María Velasco Ibarra. From its people to its politics, his populism and personalism allowed him to take center stage in the country for nearly two decades.\n\nWhile his opening up to Iberia as the alternative to the US was welcomed by Washington, after relations between the two soured perspectives swiftly changed. Backing a coup against Velasco to guarantee an American ally would lead the country, the Caudillo fled to Iberia where he would build up his allies that fled with him there. There he would meet with the Iberian leaders and other politicians in exile, planning paths for his return and deepening his "Velasquismo".\n\nSo when the elites that just half a decade ago helped coup him, asked him to return to the Presidency and save the country from collapse, he would accept without much thought. Positioning himself once again as a unifying figure to the people, their saviour and hero, he would turn against those who brought him back strike at the elites, nationalising vast swaths of the land of Ecuador and many of their companies. Causing mass capital flight from American companies, with a swift stroke he would rid Ecuador of influence from what he saw as its biggest hindrances to prosperity. Further falling back on his Iberian allies, Velasco has set himself up in a position of near omnipotence in Ecuador, with his only threat being the military in the Galápagos, making his near future all but guaranteed to be, if nothing else, stable."
 POLITICS_MARCOS_GANDARA_DESC: "An academic at heart, Marcos Gándara Enríquez had observed Ecuadorian politics from the sidelines ever since the aftermath of the invasion of Peru, writing about the state of Ecuador and its armed forces in depth over the years.\n\nHaving amassed respect from his international peers after studying and working with Iberian, Italian and American militaries, Gandára would set himself to be a prominent figure in the late Velasco government. However, the 1960 Coup, Socialist Revolution and Perivian Invasion would throw a wrench in his plans.\n\nBeing forced to sit from the sidelines as the government took one disastrous policy after another and his country collapsed at the seams led him to take drastic actions. Cozying up to Washington against his better will and preparing a coup to remove the Arosemena government and instate a military one that would finally handle all the lingering issues that had haunted Ecuador for the better half of the century.\n\nSeizing his chance with the Colombian Civil War restarting, taking control of the country and ousting the civilian government, he would begin to enact wide ranging reforms to the state while keeping the army independent from politics. However, his true intentions go beyond his current actions, with both his alignment with the Americans and the apparent temporary rule of his administration being not truly what Gándara wants but instead what he is permitted."
