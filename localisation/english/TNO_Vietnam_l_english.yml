 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_VU_NGOC_ANH_DESC: "A doctor by trade, Prime Minister Vu Ngoc Anh came from a Catholic Mandarin family from the Northern province of Nam Dinh. Renowned for his studies in France, he became involved in smallpox vaccinations across Tonkin. So famous did he become that the government appointed him to the Tonkin House of Representatives between 1930 and 1940, a capacity he served in the General Economic and Financial Council. The watershed moment in his career was his handling of the Northern famine: as one of the principal organizers of aid and relief, he is widely credited with bringing the famine to an end.\n\nThe trajectory of his career would change dramatically when Japan made Vietnam independent in 1945. Famed for his methodical, compassionate demeanor, the Tran Trong Kim government appointed him to the position of Minister of Health and Aid, an office where he performed admirably. When Tran Trong Kim resigned in 1952, Tran Van Chuong retained his services and promoted him to be his Deputy Prime Minister. Dr. Vu had never thought he'd rise this far. Yet, in the wake of the failures of Operation Yon-Go, he himself would become Prime Minister.\n\nIn other times, Dr. Vu would have made for an excellent Prime Minister. The decades of work in the medical field and experience in the political arena would have given him ample room to maneuver. His methodical and compassionate character would have granted him, if not the love of the people, then their apathy. However, there he is: the janitor to all the failures of the past government. With Diem's personalists on the rise and the National Front abandoning his government, there seems to be nothing stopping the Viet Minh's resurgence. His rule was over before it truly began. The question is: who will succeed him?"
 POLITICS_BAO_DAI_DESC: "Bào Dai is a man haunted by could-have-beens; as a child, he was raised to the throne more or less by decree in the wake of his father's death, and his moves have been carefully planned by others for most of his life since then. Not much has improved significantly since the days of his youth; the puppet masters now speak Japanese rather than French, and the grain convoys go to Osaka and Nagoya rather than to Paris, but Vietnam still chafes under a foreign boot, and he with it. And he is powerless to stop it.\n\nAs emperor, Bảo Dại has grown increasingly autocratic in his rule, preferring to rule without the help of his council. Which is ironic, considering those he relies upon to do his bidding are themselves loyal more to their paymasters in Tokyo than to the Emperor. Most of the rest of the country is indifferent to his decrees in any case, as Vietnam churns with rebellious sentiment and insurgents, just as it did in the last days of French rule. Ho Chi Minh lurks in the shadows, ready to pounce, and the overlords wait for a misstep to justify further intrusion.\n\nBào Dai sees his present and yearns for lost futures, for the dream of an independent and strong Empire that died when the Japanese marched in. His regrets are Vietnam's own; but unlike him, Vietnam has a chance of forging its own path and making it out alive. Bào Dai knows that when the future comes for him, he will be swept away, just another cobweb in the dusty hall. It's not like he has a choice in the matter."
 POLITICS_TRUONG_TU_ANH_DESC: "Trưong Tử Anh - Anh Cả Phưong, "eldest brother Phưong," to his acquaintances -  has been waiting easily twenty years to reach the position he has reached, and now that he has done so he will hold on to it like a limpet.\n\nBorn in Phú Yên province, nationalism was in Anh's blood; his father, the headman of his home village, participated in various nationalist movements such as the Cần Vưong movement. Yet Anh would go further: in university in Hà Nội, he began to formulate an ideology known as survival nationalism. This ideology held that humans were composed of 'basic instincts' such as selfishness, sexuality and society, that these instincts had to be stronger than those of others, and such strength of instincts were brought about by strength, transformation, and integration.\n\nWith this ideology, Anh founded the Đại Việt Quốc dân Đảng - the Dai Viet Nationalist Party - in 1939. After the seizure of Vietnam from the French by the Japanese, Anh coalised with elements of the VNQDD under Vũ Hồng Khanh and the Đại Việt Dân Chính Đảng under Nhất Linh to form the modern National Front.\n\nCooperating with the governments of Trần Trọng Kim and Trần Văn Chưong, Anh built his strength in the north and south of Vietnam, catching the Personalists in the middle. Chưong gave Anh and Nhu more power to prevent the government collapsing, which failed - then, Vũ Ngọc Anh compounded the blunder and integrated both parties into the government to stave off further attack. Obviously, that failed, and Trưong Tử Anh is in control.\n\nWith that done, Anh is free to promote his survival nationalism to the Vietnamese people. He will do so without regard to the cost - for no cost is too great to make his nation strong."
 POLITICS_NGO_DINH_DIEM_DESC: "After ten years of being spurned from the Prime Ministership, Ngo Dinh Diem has come roaring back on the heels of one of the worst crises in Vietnam's history. Diem began his career by slowly ascending the ranks of the mandarin bureaucracy. Once the Japanese entered Indochina, Diem was quick to turn against the French, and began establishing connections with the Japanese.\n\nFor his role in forming the Association for the Restoration of Great Vietnam, Diem would be forced to seek refuge by the French. However, the Japanese would soon free Vietnam from the clutches of colonialism. That did not mean Diem would automatically become Prime Minister despite his efforts, as Tran Trong Kim was appointed to the position instead.\n\nAfter a decade of building up his power, and with the aid of his brothers, Diem has now reached the apex of his political career. With the ineffectual government discarded and a state of emergency declared, Diem is free to bring order and justice to Vietnam."
 POLITICS_REPUBLICAN_DIEM_DESC: "For ten years, Diem had been spurned the Prime Ministership. Yet now, not only has he come roaring back on the heels of the worst crisis in independent Vietnam's history, but he has also now swept away the puppet of French colonialism. Diem had withstood being forced into exile by the French. Diem had withstood being sidelined in favor of Tran Trong Kim. He had withstood for far too long an ineffectual government leading Vietnam into chaos.\n\nThe Social Revolution, espoused by Diem's brother Nhu, shall sweep away the Viet Minh and revitalize Vietnam. Material capitalism, one way or another, shall be swept aside. Order and justice shall soon be restored to a nation long deprived of either. Some may have to suffer in the name of these ideals, but Ngo Dinh Diem had not swept away the previous failure of a government in order to compromise on what was necessary for Vietnam.\n\nAfter a decade of building up his power, Diem's political career has only just begun. A new democracy, as the state withers, will be established upon the ruins of what was, and now none can stand in the way of the Social Revolution."
 POLITICS_NGUYEN_KHANH_DESC: "Nguyen Khanh was born to a southern background, and brought up by his de facto stepmother, a famous Vietnamese opera singer. When Japan liberated Vietnam from the clutches of colonialism, Khanh offered himself up to join the embryonic Vietnamese army, and was accepted into its ranks.\n\nNguyen Khanh rose through the ranks, joining the sole operating airborne unit at the time, and was eventually sent to be educated at Japanese military academies. Throughout it all, Khanh has seen everything there is to see. He witnessed the Thai operation against Laos and Cambodia. He witnessed the operations against the Viet Minh, and their most stunning reversal in 1960.\n\nNow, Nguyen Khanh has managed to seize power against domestic instability, with a state of exception. Khanh's rise to power has been... chaotic. Many in Vietnam now can only hope that Khanh's subsequent administration will bring an end to the chaos and instability."

 VIN_Bao_Dai_hog_desc: "§YEmperor of Vietnam\nPaternalistic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LThe Emperor of Vietnam is a renowned luxuriant wastrel. Though he was the face of the Vietnamese state at home and abroad, he does not govern. Instead, whenever official duties do not bother him, he retreats to the Imperial Citadel, spending his days in luxurious idleness. Though the people and the political establishment loathe him, he fits the purpose that Japan had laid out for him. Compliant and easily cowed, what little patriotic sentiment that the Emperor of Vietnam has did not matter.\n\nThese are the last days of the Empire, and Bao Dai knows it. Prominent nationalists have spoken out against the monarchy, becoming staunch republicans in the face of Bao Dai's sumptuous apathy. The Viet Minh - the less said, the better. The Imperial Citadel was a pebble in the proceedings of fate: to be washed away in the onrush of great change.§!"
 VIN_Vu_Van_Mau_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nPaternalistic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LVu Van Mau has kept a relatively low profile as Minister of Foreign Affairs. After all, given Japan's relationship with Vietnam, such work is often seen as unnecessary. However they are wrong.\n\nIn fact, out of all the members of the cabinet, Vu Van Mau has likely done the most work to ensure Vietnam stays afloat. It is his frequent visits to Tokyo that guarantees a steady supply of arms, advisors, and supplies make their way to the depots of Haiphong. Without his "unnecessary" work, Vietnam would surely fall to ruin.§!"
 VIN_Tran_Van_Van_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nPaternalistic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LTran Van Van is a prominent businessman from the South, having founded the first steel casting factory in Vietnam. When the Japanese liberated Vietnam from the shackles of French colonialism, Tren Van Van was invited to Thuan Hoa to work in the Ministry of Finance under Ho Ta Khanh.\n\nOver the next decade, Tran Van Van would come to fall in with the reformists of the National Front of Vietnam, such as Tran Van Huong, or Nguyen Luu Vien. Having risen to the position of Minister of Finance, Tran Van Van now represents the National Front, despite not officially being a member of it.§!"
 VIN_Ngo_Dinh_Nhu_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Interior\nRevolutionary Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LIf you ask a Vietnamese political expert who the most-connected man in Vietnamese politics is, the answer will always be "Ngô Đình Nhu". A former library archivist and a devout - many would say too devout - Roman Catholic, Ngô Đình Nhu is the ideologue of the Cần Lao (Personalist Labour) Party. He first entered the Imperial Government by being appointed Minister of Interior under Trần Văn Chưong, his father-in-law. But despite his relative experience, he is widely disliked within the government, partly because of his strange ideology: Personalism.\n\nBasing his views on the writings of theologian Emmanuel Mounier, Nhu insists on the need for a social revolution to sweep away the Việt Minh's advocated communist revolution. Despite this anti-government position, the government retains his service for fear of his paramilitaries, which are fully capable of causing chaos in the Vietnamese midlands. So long as the government can weather this rough patch, they can prevent Personalist influence from spreading further.§!"

 VIN_idea_viet_minh_desc: "On every map of the world, the territory under the Empire of Vietnam is represented as united under the government in Hue. However, if one were to step foot into the countryside, they would not find our police forces nor the Imperial Japanese Army patrolling the villages, but the communist League for the Independence of Vietnam, or Viet Minh in short. They began their fight for Vietnam's independence against the French in 1941, but now they changed their target to the Vietnamese government and Japanese forces in the country. Under the charismatic leadership of Ho Chi Minh and Truong Chinh, the Viet Minh have gathered support from all over the country and even beyond, including elements from the Chinese National Revolutionary Army. Although activities have been decreasing since the 1950s, they are waiting for a single moment of weakness to strike the country and bring about their §R"Revolution"§!..."

We have no control over our economy, nor our military matters, even our internal politics are manipulated by Japan. Japanese cultural influence only increases day by day, eclipsing even the French.

However, the failure of Operation Yon-Go in 1961, and the subsequent finger-pointing between the 38th Army and the Tran Van Chuong government, revealed the instability inherent in the political establishment of the country. With the resignation of former Prime Minister Tran Van Chuong, former healthcare minister Vu Ngoc Anh was appointed as a caretaker Prime Minister, but his government is missing vital support from the National Front of Vietnam. As the factions in the Vietnamese government fight amongst themselves to see who will replace him, the Viet Minh prepare their next moves..."

With the Viet Minh threat receding in the 1950s, Japan began to block such actions. However, with the failure of Operation Yon-Go in 1961, Governor-General Tsuchihashi Yuitsu has finally allowed us to proceed with a tentative expansion of Vietnam armed forces. However, the government must be careful to both wean themselves from Japan while also maintaining their generous assistance."

The Prince must take swift action to ensure Japanese support and calm the population."

The existing scouting movements have been reorganized into the Revolutionary Youth, women are being organized, and more. There are, however, worrying reports of intimidation, violence, and a campaign in the north involving mass executions and abuse, targeted at suspected Viet Minh..."

 POLITICS_HO_CHI_MINH_DESC: "The man called Ho Chí Minh by the world has been known as Nguyen Sinh Cung and Bác Ho - "Uncle Ho" - in addition to something between fifty and two-hundred other pseudonyms. Virtually nothing is known about his life other than that he was born in Central Vietnam in 1890, and that he was trained in Marxist politics in France and Russia. He is, however, known and grudgingly respected by all Vietnamese - even his enemies - as a polyglot and a competent poet, whose poems in the Chu Hán and Chu Quoc Ngu scripts make for easy reading and listening for nearly the whole realm.\n\nNow, on the other hand, they know something more about him than before. After more than two decades of struggle, first against the French, then against the Vichy French, and at last against the Japanese - all the same breed of imperialists, Ho knew quite well - Ho will not go quietly, if at all. Having carved out a free zone in Northern Vietnam, and with agents seemingly seeded throughout the country, Ho has become more than just a leader - he is an enigma and a bogeyman to the Japanese and the Vietnamese government, and a nearly mythical hero to anyone who stands against them.\n\nBut Ho Chi Minh grows old, and even as Japan's grip on Asia weakens, Ho senses he may not live long enough to see Vietnam stand proudly as an independent nation. The Vietnamese people know and rally to Uncle Ho - but who will they follow after he is gone?"
 POLITICS_TRUONG_CHINH_DESC: "The man who now calls himself Truong Chinh was born as Dang Xuân Khu in the Red River Delta not far from Hà Noi in 1907. After twenty-nine years spent on a life journey that led him first towards socialism and later towards the communism of Ho Chí Minh, he took his current name - "Long March" in Vietnamese - to honor the Long March undertaken by Mao Zedong, who was later to be martyred fighting the Japanese imperialists.\n\nNow Ho Chí Minh is dead, and an at least temporary victory against the Japanese has been assured. His successor is the man who the Vietnamese communists were proud to refer to as the 'excellent student of Bác (Uncle) Ho' - Truong Chinh. His revolutionary credentials are impeccable, and his loyalty to Vietnam and the Communist Party never in doubt: he took pride in his devotion to Ho's ideals even though he did not always agree with them.\n\nWith control now fully in Truong's hands, and the loyalty of his party and nation more or less assured, Truong is freed to move forward with a somewhat changed ideological program: the main plans will be predicated upon a land reform inspired by Mao Zedong's writings combined with a Bolshevist interpretation of the anti-colonial movement.\n\nRegardless of his plans, Truong will give his predecessor every reason to be proud of him. This he swears on his honor and loyalty to the Revolution and to Vietnam."

It has outlasted its Chinese comrades, having endured the worst of the Japanese where they unfortunately scattered.
