SAM_Smuta_Bunyachenko: "Smuta - Bunyachenko"
SAM_the_face_of_a_slave_a_prisoner: "The Face of a Slave, a Prisoner"
SAM_the_face_of_a_slave_a_prisoner_desc: "Once a prisoner of the Germans, I, Sergei Bunyachenko, will never forget those days. They have branded themselves deep within my soul. With that time in their camps, living an existence less than that of a dog, forever chaining down my existence, I must work to forge a better future for all other Russians. Even if they should hate me, even if they should resent me, this lowly slave that I am cannot ever allow anyone to share in my personal hell.\n\nTo this end, I will do what I must."
SAM_thank_you_but_i_didnt_want_this: "Thank You, But I Didn't Want This"
SAM_thank_you_but_i_didnt_want_this_desc: "As great an honor as becoming the leader of the ROA is meant to be, Bunyachenko would be lying if he said he had expected such an honor would fall to him. He has done little in his life to deserve such a high post, even one tainted by the stench of treason such as this. Nevertheless, he cannot trust anyone else with the responsibility of the post, and so he must accept it as his own. He will do right by Russia, this time - when no one else will, he must."
SAM_celebrations_all_for_legitimacy: "Celebrations, All for Legitimacy"
SAM_celebrations_all_for_legitimacy_desc: "A rally here, a dinner then, a parade there. The people are demoralized under us, and we have to give them reason not to be so. To secure support and legitimacy for our government after the rise to power of Bunyachenko, we will hold some necessary celebrations to lift the peoples' mood and distract them from the hardships of their everyday lives."
SAM_too_much_sloth_weakens_an_army: "Too Much Sloth Weakens an Army"
SAM_too_much_sloth_weakens_an_army_desc: "There is no time to celebrate the empowerment of Bunyachenko. Too much remains to be done, and we must conserve our resources. We cannot encourage sloth and relaxation in our men through pointless festivities - as the present is hard, the near future will be harder, and we must prepare our people for such eventualities as best we can."
SAM_too_much_sloth_weakens_an_army_tt: "§FThe cost to complete §W$RUS_Decision_Smuta_Chaos_Decrease_CP$§! will §Bbe halved§!.§!\n"
SAM_not_a_hero_but_a_leader: "Not a Hero, But a Leader"
SAM_not_a_hero_but_a_leader_desc: "Sergei Bunyachenko is not a hero. Nevertheless, he has proven to be a man that men can rally around. He, too, spent time in German camps; he, too, knows the hardships of being a soldier. Yes, Bunyachenko is no hero, but that is not what matters to the soldiers who serve at his command. They respect him because they know that if it were needed, he would gladly pick up a gun and fight right alongside them."
SAM_scores_to_settle_all_too_many: "Scores to Settle, All Too Many"
SAM_scores_to_settle_all_too_many_desc: "If there is anything that can unite the Russian people, especially our army serving to protect them, it is our bitterness towards the Germans and desire to retake what is ours. With so many former German POWs in our army, there are more than enough scores to settle, ranging from the personal to the ideological. We will focus on this hatred and thirst for revenge in our propaganda to discourage infighting and mutiny."
SAM_a_strong_russia_a_comfortable_life: "A Strong Russia, a Comfortable Life"
SAM_a_strong_russia_a_comfortable_life_desc: "More than anything else, what our soldiers desire is a better life for themselves and, increasingly, for their families. If we are to unite them and rally them under our flag, we must promise these long-destitute soldiers a future that has what they need and, truthfully, rightly deserve: freedom, comfort, and security."
SAM_talk_to_me_directly: "Talk to Me Directly"
SAM_talk_to_me_directly_desc: "No more will disobedience and defiance from junior officers within our military be tolerated. For too long in our armed struggles, they have undertaken unauthorized operations against the enemy in foolish attempts to earn some immaterial glory, sometimes jeopardizing our wider military strategy. From now on, any officer that attempts to abuse their autonomy to conduct such irresponsible affairs will be harshly disciplined."
SAM_but_i_will_do_whats_necessary: "...but I Will Do What's Necessary"
SAM_but_i_will_do_whats_necessary_desc: "Now that he has been given a chance to make things right, Bunyachenko will not waste it. Men like Oktan and Zykov cannot be trusted to do what is best for Russia, and with no other options, Bunyachenko is more than willing to make his vision a reality himself. Russia's grand future lies ahead of him: all the remains is to seize it with his own two hands."
SAM_food_shelter_protection: "Food, Shelter, Protection"
SAM_food_shelter_protection_desc: "We cannot simply slaughter those who grow angry at the rule of our government. There are far too many of them, and far too few of us. To employ only the stick to discipline the masses would therefore be unwise. Instead, we must offer them a carrot they might have instead of the harshness of the stick, some means of salvation for them that is easier than attempting to bring us low. Whether they are hungry, or homeless, or unsafe, we will do what we can with those resources we have available to provide for the needs of the people. What we provide may not always be sufficient, especially at present, but it will be enough to make the people hesitate in their dissent."
SAM_punishment_exile_death: "Punishment, Exile, Death"
SAM_punishment_exile_death_desc: "For those who pose the greatest internal threat to our plane for Russia, namely Oktan's hired thugs and Zykov's clever propagandists, we will have to rid ourselves of their remaining power by any means necessary. For those who can be convinced by punishment, they will be imprisoned for as long as needed. For those who cannot be convinced but might be forgiven, they will be permanently exiled. For those who we cannot take risks with, execution. All is done in the name of our country. The existence of these dangers cannot be tolerated if we are to one day earn forgiveness."
SAM_not_a_dictator_but_a_saviour: "Not a Dictator, but a Saviour"
SAM_not_a_dictator_but_a_saviour_desc: "Although we cannot and should not change the facts of the matter, appearances are important, especially now. We must begin making the transition from a state clearly governed by the military to one that appears to be civilian led, even as it remains no less despotic in policy. This is an important point, for if we do not at least pretend to be a civilian government, then many who are unfit for military service will become discouraged from participation in government, and we will miss out on much expertise and technical skill in the process."
SAM_tall_smokestacks_everywhere: "Tall Smokestacks, Everywhere"
SAM_tall_smokestacks_everywhere_desc: "In order to revitalize the Russian economy, cooperation with the industrialist leaders is important. Without their help, it will prove very difficult to take charge of the economic future of Russia, let alone to improve its direction. We will meet with them and make them understand our position, then come to an agreement so that we can greatly increase our industrial output and economic strength."
SAM_much_energy_to_be_used: "Much Energy to Be Used"
SAM_much_energy_to_be_used_desc: "Those who cannot serve, will work. This rule might be harsh, but these are desperate times, and they call for desperate measures. We will improve the mobilization of our workforce and aim for the full employment of our people: anybody able to work a job will have one, whether they like it or not. Those who cannot do anything else will perform much-needed menial labor across the territory we control."
SAM_much_skills_to_be_employed: "Much Skills to Be Employed"
SAM_much_skills_to_be_employed_desc: "It has come to our attention that there are many within the ranks of our armed forces with great administrative talent, who however languish in dead-end military posts as they struggle in a career they never wanted. The energy of these people will be redirected: instead of supporting the functions of an army that already has bureaucracy aplenty, they will be given posts within our state that badly need to be filled, so that they can help us to better adjust to the necessities and intricacies of governing civilians rather than soldiers."
SAM_you_cant_scare_me_now: "You Can't Scare Me Now"
SAM_you_cant_scare_me_now_desc: "Already secure in our positions, we need to tolerate and work with the remnant cronies of Oktan and Zykov no more. As such, just to be safe, it would be best to rid ourselves of them. A shuffle of government posts will be conducted to strategically eject them from state employment and swiftly replace them with men who can be trusted to be loyal. After all, only a completely loyal government can be trusted to unite in the face of the great struggle to come."
SAM_binds_to_break_shackles_to_smash: "Binds to Break, Shackles to Smash"
SAM_binds_to_break_shackles_to_smash_desc: "We cannot afford to hold grudges anymore, at least not against those who pose no real danger to our authority. Former soldiers of rival regimes languishing in our prisons will be offered a chance for freedom - in exchange for service in our own army. Some might refuse, for reasons ranging from the ideological to the petty. Most will not, and this will afford our army the opportunity to grow greatly."
SAM_you_can_trust_me_always: "You Can Trust Me, Always"
SAM_you_can_trust_me_always_desc: "Who Sergei Bunyachenko really is - that doesn't matter. What does matter is how people perceive him. As we have the opportunity to give the people our own perspective on this, we should take it. To the masses, Sergei Bunyachenko will be an honest, diligent soldier, somebody that anyone can strive to be like and somebody that can be reasoned with. That is, so long as his vision for Russia is followed. With that image projected by our government, it is hoped that the people will work harder, work together, and work for the great vision of Sergei Bunyachenko."
SAM_just_a_few_bottles_nothing_more: "Just a Few Bottles, Nothing More"
SAM_just_a_few_bottles_nothing_more_desc: "We have accomplished much of significance in the time since the bombings ended, and this is a fact worthy of celebration. We cannot overindulge, we have too much at stake to become lost in victories that pale in comparison to the struggles to come, and yet... there is no harm in allowing ourselves to relax ever so slightly. For the sake of the morale of our men, and because they have more than earned it, we shall allow some limited celebrations of our victories thus far."
SAM_for_your_freedom_not_mine: "For Your Freedom, Not Mine"
SAM_for_your_freedom_not_mine_desc: "Even now, there are some who resent the ROA, resent Bunyachenko himself, for their traitorous work for the Germans. We cannot begrudge them this, it is true. We betrayed Russia, and we can do nothing except try to one day earn her forgiveness. However, we must make one thing very clear to the people: they do not need to fight for Bunyachenko. So long as they fight for his vision, they do not need to love him. They do not fight for his own selfish interests, but for their own freedom from enslavement under the German boot."
SAM_janus: "Janus"
SAM_janus_desc: "There is nothing left, except for my state. From the former German prisoners who brought me so far, I have been propelled to the very heights of power in Russia. I lead a strong state, an unmistakably sovereign state that will reclaim what rightfully belongs to it. Even the Germans, deluded by all their own miserable propaganda, cannot help but fear this. Good; let them fear our coming. They have earned nothing less.\n\nI am Sergei Bunyachenko, and I will correct my mistakes."

SAM_Smuta_Oktan: "Smuta - Oktan"
SAM_a_kingdom_in_the_making: "A Kingdom in the Making"
SAM_a_kingdom_in_the_making_desc: "Germany is engulfed in chaos, and the bombers have gone quiet. West Russia, for the first time in years, no longer has to fear the bombings.\n\nThis development is both good and bad - bad, because now the degenerate Russians will crawl out of their holes, and mobilize their rotten statelets to expand and butcher each other, as they are so prone to do. However, this affords the Russian Liberation Army the same opportunity - one I shall not squander.\n\nI, Mikhail Oktan, have been entrusted with the duty of transforming this broken, backwater nation into a proper state; a proper kingdom. This statelet of Samara may be my humble beginning, it is mine - and soon all Russia will be as well."
SAM_the_king_himself: "The King Himself..."
SAM_the_king_himself_desc: "To have a kingdom, one must have a king. Yet not just any king can rule effectively - the king must be strong, wise, rich, respected, and above all - absolute. A weak king will bring a nation to ruin, and be powerless as it slides into failure and degeneracy. I will permit no such thing.\n\nRussians are a backwards, weak, and degenerate people, who will be a tiring challenge to rule. A king does not choose his subjects - but he can shape them. With a strong German mind and arm to guide them, these people will learn the proper ways - willingly or otherwise.\n\nThrough my efforts, Russians will one day be proud National Socialists, and look at me with the respect I am owed. This is inevitable - I am certain of it."
SAM_i_was_the_best_choice_no_doubt: "I Was the Best Choice, No Doubt!"
SAM_i_was_the_best_choice_no_doubt_desc: "Vlasov's rule has ended.\n\nI, and everyone else knows and understands this, for his power, legitimacy, and authority has been transferred to me. Yet Vlasov still has a use, and what ruler discards a tool which can yet serve him? Vlasov cannot challenge me any longer, so I will utilize him further, and leave no question as to who is the rightful heir of Samara.\n\nStrangely, several trustworthy people have advised against this action. They fear that Vlasov is untrustworthy, and he and his allies might undermine or move against me.\n\nUtter nonsense. Such concerns can be dismissed, for if he had such thoughts, he would not have chosen me, would he?"
SAM_sir_you_are_not_allowed_to_enter: "Sir, You Are Not Allowed to Enter"
SAM_sir_you_are_not_allowed_to_enter_desc: "Vlasov has transferred his authority to me, but I cannot help but observe how they still treat him. They still look at him with respect. They go to him for advice. They quietly affirm my orders for his approval. If one was conspiratorial, one might wonder who truly rules Samara.\n\nIf Vlasov wants to play such games, then let us play.\n\nVlasov will be permanently removed from all places of influence. His rule has ended, and mine has begun - no one will threaten this. His remaining allies will certainly oppose it, as will those who remember him fondly - but this will resolve itself in time. Soon all will learn there is only one name in Samara that matters.\n\nAnd that name is Mikhail Oktan."
SAM_a_most_expected_promotion: "A Most Expected Promotion"
SAM_a_most_expected_promotion_desc: "The existing military structure of the Russian Liberation Army is a convoluted and tiring matter to deal with. Generals and officers bicker and argue over who is in charge - when the answer is obvious. These idiotic Russians forget who is in charge - so they must learn in a way they can understand.\n\nTo this end, the position of Head General of the Army will be created - a position I will be promoted to, of course. A position that is above all other military ranks, so there is no more question of who commands it. I expect that, out of a desire to keep their power and authority, some disloyal officers will oppose this move, but they will fail.\n\nIt is a critical step into reforming the army into something truly patriotic - and has the secondary benefit of revealing who is truly loyal to me."
SAM_service_is_optional_actually: "Service Is Optional, Actually"
SAM_service_is_optional_actually_desc: "The wise men fill their ranks with the poor, degenerates, undesirables, and leeches of society. This is useful for solving several problems at once - one need not fear rebellion, treason, and insubordination from a poorer and more simple-minded army. The intelligent have other uses, not on the front lines.\n\nAdditionally, this provides an opportunity to ensure our coffers are always full.\n\nMen often bribed recruiters to avoid military service - I will formalize this process, by introducing a Patriotic Tax - which will allow recruits to pay to avoid conscription. This will, of course, lessen our military numbers - but without a doubt, I, and all those who are loyal, will be far wealthier than before!"
SAM_toys_soldiers_and_patriotism: "Toys, Soldiers, and Patriotism"
SAM_toys_soldiers_and_patriotism_desc: "To gain the loyalty of men is a commendable thing, but to keep it is far simpler. For those generals who have remained loyal to me, I will ensure that they are well rewarded. For these men, the best means of ensuring their continued support is making sure they have enough toys to play with.\n\nGuns, medals, equipment, soldiers! I see their eyes light up like children as I hand their gifts one by one; a payment for service well-earned. And when the gifts are dispersed, I will set them loose upon Russia to play with their new toys, and generously utilizing the authority I have invested in them.\n\nI will let them have their fun - so long as they remain loyal."
SAM_it_is_my_army: "It Is My Army"
SAM_it_is_my_army_desc: "The ease by which I have been able to transform the rotten, incompetent, and disloyal army that Vlasov commanded has surprised even myself - and speaks to his incompetence. Ah, there is no use reminiscing on past failures of lesser men - the pieces are in place, and there is only one step left.\n\nAll of the changes, appointments, and policies will now be solidified through the sovereign text of law. While there is a certain ease in relying on unwritten rules and quiet arrangements, such are easy to break and exploit - and I have no intention of suffering either!\n\nLet the legal code make it clear for all - this army is mine, and it shall always answer to me!"
SAM_and_all_those_below: "...and All Those Below"
SAM_and_all_those_below_desc: "To have a truly good, prosperous, and wealthy kingdom, it must be one where people are happy - or at least, content.\n\nThere are two actions I will take to achieve this - the first will be taking steps to provide them the necessities needed to live. Men are easy to control, Russians even more so, and once I have provided for them, they will have no reason to oppose or question my rule - at least for the overwhelming majority.\n\nYet there are always going to be dissidents and those simply ungrateful. Thus, my second action will be to make sure that these traitors keep their mouths shut - either through fear, or by force."
SAM_imagine_all_i_could_give_you: "Imagine All I Could Give You!.."
SAM_imagine_all_i_could_give_you_desc: "A great king does not act alone, but also possesses a cadre of loyal dukes who support, advise, and assist in the rule of the kingdom. Loyalty is prized, dedication is rewarded, and for those who willingly and gratefully serve under me? Why, I will ensure that they are greatly rewarded.\n\nThere is no shortage of wealth and riches I possess, and for those who are deserving, they share in the spoils - while those who lack the loyalty or competence will be starved of it. This will certainly draw away some funds from various programs or institutions - but such things are nothing compared to the benefit of strong, loyal allies.\n\nAnd for those who still oppose me? Well, perhaps when they see the rewards of loyalty, and the punishments of defiance, they will be wise enough not to speak out of turn."
SAM_or_do_to_you: "...or Do to You"
SAM_or_do_to_you_desc: "The useful thing about loyalty is that when gained, it is difficult to lose. I have little reason to worry about those who are loyal to me - while there remain many who oppose my appointment, and subsequently defy my rule.\n\nUnacceptable. Intolerable. Contemptible. Pathetic.\n\nNo, I will not let these fools get away with this insolence. A ruler who lets his enemies challenge him without action is weak. As whispers and rumors compound, more and more will pounce on perceived weaknesses. From Bunyachenko to Zykov, each voice that opposes me must be crushed.\n\nAnd when such voices are silenced, then I will rest, knowing my rule is secure."
SAM_protesting_is_just_not_beneficial: "Protesting Is Just Not Beneficial"
SAM_protesting_is_just_not_beneficial_desc: "For protest to happen is to reveal a problem; for it to repeat is a failure. Any proper kingdom would possess a system of governance that would ensure that there is no need, desire, or capability to protest. This problem has been one which has long plagued men who rule nations - when the solution is deceptively simple.\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nThose who declare themselves opposed to me? Who foolishly reveal their intentions through their antics? They will be dealt with, be they Jews, communists, democrats, and criminals; none will be spared. And when they are dealt with, so too is the problem of protest solved."
SAM_running_with_empty_pockets: "Running With Empty Pockets"
SAM_running_with_empty_pockets_desc: "To be a coward is one thing, to be a traitor is another - and the combination of the two produces something truly repulsive. Deserters are among the lowest of men, worthy of nothing but contempt. It is no surprise that many prefer to have them shot, or not even worth the effort to find in the first place.\n\nNo, death is too good for them. And these leeches will not live free in Russia. They will be found, and they will be made to serve.\n\nTheir lives will be made forfeit, and all that they have will be seized. They will be organized into divisions and placed on the front lines to fight and die in my name. A pragmatic plan, and if it shows clear benefits? There is no reason why other criminals and undesirables cannot be treated similarly in the future."
SAM_a_road_for_everyone_to_drive_on: "A Road for Everyone to Drive On"
SAM_a_road_for_everyone_to_drive_on_desc: "I am not ignorant of that which is said about me. That I am a simple tyrant. That I am an evil dictator. That I care nothing for the people I rule.\n\nNonsense! Nothing could be further from the truth!\n\nWho was it that has built the roads they drive on? Who commanded that the rails be refurbished? Who ensured that they can travel throughout this nation without fear or concern? For them to still complain after what I have given them? After what I paid for?\n\nIt is infuriating for these ungrateful peasants to still scorn me. Perhaps they would prefer someone less benevolent, and they may get a taste if they do not learn to appreciate what I have given them."
SAM_a_state_for_everyone_to_serve: "A State for Everyone to Serve"
SAM_a_state_for_everyone_to_serve_desc: "To build a government is no easy task - something even more apparent when one has to worry about spies, Jews, and traitors ready to infest it. Care must be taken in its design, subtlety in its intricacies. One fundamental truth is clear - Power in the hands of a few is dangerous - while power diluted can be controlled.\n\nAnd there are many who would do anything for just a sliver of power.\n\nSo this power will be spread far and wide. Ministries large and small will be formed at my command, open to all those who are willing to give their loyalty, and who are relentless in hunting the treasonous or undesirable - be they mere criminals or the Jewish spies who infest our lands."
SAM_additional_pair_of_eyes_always_helps: "Additional Pair of Eyes Always Helps"
SAM_additional_pair_of_eyes_always_helps_desc: "I do my best to remain vigilant and aware of the schemes and plans of my enemies - but there is a point where my vision becomes murky, and I cannot perceive the blades in the dark. Thus, I must take measures lest I find this dagger plunged into my back.\n\nA new agency will be created; a secret intelligence apparatus filled with only the most capable and loyal. But I cannot be too careful here - especially with such an important tool. And even loyal men must prove their competence.\n\nThey will be tasked with finding as many weapons and military equipment as they can - from our allies, enemies, or citizens - and ensure that it reaches our army. Those who succeed will have proven their dedication - and those who have not will find their careers short indeed."
SAM_i_remember_our_pact_kaminski: "I Remember Our Pact, Kaminski"
SAM_i_remember_our_pact_kaminski_desc: "Ah, Kaminski. For over two decades now, we have worked together. I supported your endeavors in Moskowien, and you ensured I remained a counterbalance to Vlasov. Now Vlasov is gone, and I have succeeded - though my work has only just begun.\n\nThe pact we made remains, Kaminski - And it will not end until all of Russia is under my rule. In times like these we learn how reliable our partners truly are - and you are a reliable partner, are you not? Business partners support each other - especially if promises have been made. I ask not for charity, but a fair price for your support.\n\nPay no mind to the grumbles and whispers you may hear from those who will turn their nose up at your support. They do not matter, not anymore. I will await your answer, Kaminski - and I assure you, I will not forget it."
SAM_how_else_do_i_educate_them: "How Else Do I Educate Them?"
SAM_how_else_do_i_educate_them_desc: "The way the modern leader speaks to the people is no longer just through speeches, but through words. Newspapers are an older form of media, but in this desolate Russia, it is all people have. The paper Речь has served well as the source of proper National Socialist news - an endeavor I remain quite proud of, but sadly it remains unknown to most of the public.\n\nIt is time to change that - and in a way that will grab attention.\n\nStories don't need to be true to have an intended effect. We will prepare a "terrorist" attack, and it will be this paper which reveals the truth of the culprits - communist terrorists, of course. With some subtlety, planning, and a useful narrative, I will not only dominate the media landscape with an outlet I control - but eliminate a few troublemakers at the same time."

SAM_for_your_stab_in_the_back_you_will_die_desc: "Laziness. Treason. Failure.\n\nThese results are unacceptable. The war is being lost, and this cannot be allowed to continue. But who is to blame for this? I have made no mistake but believing that those I relied on could do the job. Now they have exposed themselves as woefully unfit for their positions - be it through incompetence or sabotage.\n\nI will not lose this war, and there will be consequences for those who have brought us to this point.\n\nThose who are responsible for this catastrophe will be dealt with - publicly and permanently. In their place will rise true, loyal, and competent patriots. Once the rot has been excised from this state, there will be nothing to stop our march to victory."
SAM_cant_say_no_to_all_the_lights: "Can't Say "No" to All the Lights"
SAM_cant_say_no_to_all_the_lights_desc: "The armies march forward, claiming victory after victory. With every city taken, with every pretender who falls, it demonstrates that not only are we unstoppable - victory is inevitable.\n\nThis once-humble statelet is now firmly on the path to greatness. All of West Russia is falling to us, be they democrats, communists, kings, or pretenders. They cannot stand before the army I have raised, or the state I have built. Some may call celebrations premature, and ask that caution be exercised - but why should they be listened to?\n\nNo! A celebration will be held for our inevitable victory. Let all who have come this far partake in the spoils and celebration! No expense will be spared, and all of Russia shall hear of this event - and despair, for they know I have won."
SAM_a_kingdom_almost_made: "A Kingdom Almost Made"
SAM_a_kingdom_almost_made_desc: "It is done.\n\nThe dissidents have been silenced. The traitors have been purged. One by one those who stood in the way were crushed under the might of my army. Obstacle after obstacle has been overcome. They whispered when they thought I could not hear. They questioned. They doubted. They plotted. They feared.\n\nToday, these whispers have been silenced. West Russia is mine.\n\nThis kingdom rests upon a firm foundation, with the path before me clear. This is only the start. The west is mine, but there remains an entire nation left to claim. My vision is clear, my path is set, and now, no one will stand in my way."

SAM_all_these_dreams_and_hopes_of_mine: "All These Dreams and Hopes of Mine"
SAM_all_these_dreams_and_hopes_of_mine_desc: "Zykov now stands above Bunyachenko and Oktan and is now second only to Vlasov in the KONR hierarchy. Zykov has worked tirelessly to reach this point - and now is the time to make use of his newfound power.\n\nThe original vision of the KONR - a force for a free, democratic and anti-communist Russia, lies deep under layers of rot. Each reform that Zykov implements, each strike at the German adjacent and militarist factions, and each foe that we vanquish will burn away this rot. Our reforms will range from the separation of the military and government, the gradual introduction of elections from the bottom and slowly upwards, and the evolution of our fledgling government into a mighty eagle!\n\nStill - we must be vigilant. Vlasov's favor is not enough to entirely protect us from the attacks by the adjacent factions, and his power continues to slip with age. Power that must be swiftly absorbed, if our regime is to survive."
SAM_my_party_but_where_should_you_be: "My Party, But Where Should You Be?"
SAM_my_party_but_where_should_you_be_desc: "The KONR is too central to the current administration to be kept as is. Hardline generals of the ROA and their cliques litter its ranks, making the risk of a move against Zykov too significant to ignore. As we transition to a civilian administration, so too must the KONR. It will realize its vision as a real political party of sorts , with Zykov front and center - and the placement of others within it entirely under his discretion.\n\nThe question remains of where Vlasov himself will fall within this new hierarchy. A powerless figurehead? An eternal President? Or merely an advisor to he who truly holds all the cards - Miletiy Zykov.\n\nWhatever the case, his place will, in all practical sense, be the same - powerless and only serving our ends."
SAM_as_our_first_and_foremost_chairman: "As Our First And Foremost Chairman"
SAM_as_our_first_and_foremost_chairman_desc: "While it could be argued that Vlasov's decision to serve as head of the ROA and KONR was one based entirely on his own survival - as most of his actions may have been - he has still been instrumental in the formation of a new Russia, and will be remembered primarily for that reason. His misgivings and mistakes will fade with time - that Zykov can make sure of.\n\nFor these reasons, Vlasov will stand as a figurehead of the new party, its honorary leader and first Chairman. Of course, all the power will lie with Zykov, but Vlasov's credentials and sway over the KONR will only strengthen our position.\n\nWhile this isn't the case today, perhaps in a few decades he will be seen as a titan on the same level as Peter the Great or Alexander Nevsky. A little propaganda can go a long way."
SAM_you_can_provide_advice_thats_all: "You Can Provide Advice, That's All"
SAM_you_can_provide_advice_thats_all_desc: "Outside of our little corner of Russia, and even within it - Vlasov has not been a popular figure. Many see him as instrumental in the continuation of Russia's new Time of Troubles, allowing the Germans to triumph over the nation, whether Bolsheviks controlled that nation or not.\n\nSidelining Vlasov into an unimportant and purely ceremonial role could help dispel some of the stigmas many Russians have of KONR, and show Zykov as a fresh face, divorced from the controversial decisions of the past.\n\nOf course, this isn't the main reason for sideling Vlasov. His previous command over the ROA serves as a threat to Zykov's newfound power. Isolating the Old General can only help Zykov tighten his grip on the new party, and show it as a truly new force - one fighting for a free and just Russia."
SAM_popular_structures_of_freedom: "Popular Structures of Freedom"
SAM_popular_structures_of_freedom_desc: "Zykov's relaxation of previous political restrictions has quickly led to the formation of new dissident parties, who represent both a threat and an opportunity.\n\nTheir presence helps legitimize Zykov's turning of a new leaf, and their opposition to Nazi collaboration and stratocracy align with Zkyov's, and allow him another bulwark against his real opponents. Of course, these new parties could serve as an outlet for public dissatisfaction with Zykov's new regime, but he will never let it come to that.\n\nThese new parties should be allowed to blossom under a watchful eye - for now at least. Zykov's proactive reforms have earned him near immunity from any critique. Attacking him would be seen as political suicide. Dare these parties defame Zykov - they will be destroyed at the ballot box, and perhaps more covertly - through Zykov's hand."
SAM_spokespersons_of_national_defence: "Spokespersons of National Defence"
SAM_spokespersons_of_national_defence_desc: "As our statelet transitions from military to civilian, the question arises - where should all those former military men go? It is best to keep them around in some capacity. After all, we have a country to reunify and wars to fight, but this must be done in a way to minimize their political power. Thus Zykov has decided to allow these groups their own parties outside of the main KONR, and some token representation to satiate their lust for power, while conceding little of it ourselves.\n\nNow that the Germans that back Oktan, and the militarists that back Bunyachenko, are sectioned off, these two can be further marginalized until none of the old ROA can truly threaten Zykov's position again. They will have an outlet to speak their minds, but this will lead nowhere, only legitimizing the portrayal of a fair and open society. Whatever they try, Zykov will endure!"
SAM_a_peoples_army_not_a_militia: "A Peoples Army, Not a Militia!"
SAM_a_peoples_army_not_a_militia_desc: "Despite our efforts, the ROA remains far too strong of a force. To further mitigate their influence on our burgeoning statelet, we must go further! The ROA still lies somewhat outside the civilian government and should be brought into it. The President will now control several of its previous functions directly, and many of its former officers will be demoted to meaningless positions. Furthermore, to create a counterweight against the ROA we will establish further non-ROA brigades - we cannot entirely rely on a bunch of German sympathizers and opportunistic generals!\n\nWe must be cautious. Moving too fast could upset the frail balance that makes up our government. Losing the faith of the ROA membership now could see defeat against the adjacent statelets, or worse - an attack from the inside."
SAM_an_overarching_party: "An Overarching Party"
SAM_an_overarching_party_desc: "Our blossoming political scene has given those originally less sympathetic to our regime far more faith in its ability to represent them. While a great benefit to stability in the short term, perhaps this has gone slightly too far. The new political parties will be permitted to continue, but now they will exist under the broader umbrella of Zykov's new KONR.\n\nThis will strike a balance between genuine democracy, particularly on the local level, while maintaining Zykov's grip. As Russia continues to endure its time of troubles and constantly warring, a fullscale democratic society is simply impossible. Our people should be grateful for what voice they have."
SAM_guiding_and_aligning_my_people: "Guiding and Aligning My People"
SAM_guiding_and_aligning_my_people_desc: "Zykov is a master at influencing public opinion. This was his job after all! Now this job is even more important. Crushing dissent with force does not fly anymore and will not be necessary in Zykov's Russia. Still - with the liberalization of our political system, the ideas of the people need to be guided and molded, aligning with Russia's best interest.\n\nForce was still necessary when a military junta ruled us, but now public opinion is a far more powerful tool. With promises of democracy - even if just a mirage, Russians will be far more engaged in the well-being of our statelet and become far more susceptible to the propaganda that Zykov expels."
SAM_vote_for_resources_elect_your_security: "Vote For Resources, Elect Your Security"
SAM_vote_for_resources_elect_your_security_desc: "The Russian people are not used to democracy. Only for a brief few months in 1917 did they snatch a whiff of it - before the reds seized on it. If we truly wish to create a free and democratic Russia, its people must be weaned onto democracy starting from the bottom up. Local elections and referendums will help motivate the people, as they'll see the impacts of their decisions in real-time - and be less impacted by the ongoing integration of the rest of our fractured motherland as national politics would.\n\nOf course, this is only half the reason for keeping the democratic process at lower levels. Fractured and disparate local jurisdictions prove little threat to Zkykov's government at the top. Perhaps one day, the Russian people will have a complete democracy - but this may not come for some time yet."
SAM_fill_those_vacant_positions_now: "Fill Those Vacant Positions Now!"
SAM_fill_those_vacant_positions_now_desc: "A new democracy brings a new bureaucracy. One with ample positions at every layer of government - with some more meaningful than others. This grants us an opportunity to deal with our opposition - not by 'disappearing them' or throwing them out - but by simply delegating them to meaningless positions and barraging them with books, not bullets. Seeing such 'luxurious' treatment of many dissidents can further restore the faith of Russians in our government, knowing we genuinely care about the values we espouse.\n\nDeeply embedded in the bureaucracy, we will always have eyes on our enemies - with loyal officials surveying their every move, a move against us will be impossible, and we can turn our eyes outwards to the threats that lie beyond our borders. Granting more opportunities to expand this new bureaucracy even further."
SAM_every_regime_has_its_outliers: "Every Regime Has Its Outliers"
SAM_every_regime_has_its_outliers_desc: "Citizens of our new republic have noticed the loosening of our grip. More and more people are beginning to speak out - first as a whisper and, for some, eventually a shout. Still, much of the public continues with their lives, passively supporting the regime. While this tumor remains benign, it could cause far more harm extracting it now. In fact, having a group of outliers criticizing the regime could be beneficial - seeing their cries of dictatorship and repression be answered by silence would show them as the fools they are.\n\nWhen Zykov liberates the rest of Russia while dissidents peck at his feet - it will only further prove our strength and our tolerance. Any other bolshevik or idiosyncratic megalomaniac would've mowed them down by now - they are lucky to live in such a free society."
SAM_how_much_power_do_you_want: "How Much Power Do You Want?"
SAM_how_much_power_do_you_want_desc: "Money, for good or for ill, talks. The corporations and big businesses of Samara have traditionally been in the pockets of Oktan, but with the kleptocrat sidelined, their allegiance is up for grabs. People will grumble, no doubt, but we cannot deny that the corporations represent a sizable and powerful faction in our slice of Russia. Inviting them to the table, discreetly, of course, to evaluate what their demands are could allow Zykov to strike an accord before they become our enemies."
SAM_advocating_an_era_of_mass_politics: "Advocating an Era of Mass Politics"
SAM_advocating_an_era_of_mass_politics_desc: "To the Russians, popular sovereignty has remained a peculiar Western notion. Languishing under tsars, communist dictators, and now warlords, the Russians had little hope of realizing their own desires until now. Many have claimed to act in the best interest of the people, but who knows better their own desires than the people themselves? Zykov will keep his promises, and we will aid in establishing grassroots democratic movements. This may seem counterproductive, but helping to kickstart political parties shows our dedication to democracy, even if those same parties may oppose us down the line. Our promises are more important than our grasp on power and the people will recognize us for who we really are."
SAM_the_intelligentsia_know_best_under_me: "The Intelligentsia Know Best Under Me"
SAM_the_intelligentsia_know_best_under_me_desc: "The intelligentsia have always been Zykov's people. The thinkers, artists, teachers, scholars, and philosophers have sat in our corner from the very beginning. Now that Samara has begun to open up to democracy, the threat of elections now looms. Multiple parties have appeared, each vying for the future of Russia. The intelligentsia, as they are want to do, eagerly launch themselves at every novel idea and new ideology. While this is charming, we would not want their enthusiasm to damage our own powerbase. Zykov will yank the leash, integrating the intelligentsia back into our own party. Let us put them to work on Zykov's vision through promises of pensions, scholarships, and buildings and parks in their name. Better that they aid us rather than our opponents."
SAM_a_working_system_finally: "A Working System Finally"
SAM_a_working_system_finally_desc: "At long last, the power of the military is reduced to a more reasonable level. No longer the sole foundations of our government, their influence has been challenged by the newly established civilian-controlled institutions and parties. Where generals once made decisions, now a new branch of civilian experts stands, ready to assume control.\n\nWhile this is a continuous process, these initial steps in changing the power dynamic of the state will help us on the long journey of becoming a proper Republic, complete with a fully functioning government.\n\nPerhaps with this in place, we may finally be able to present ourselves as the true successor to Kerensky's government."
SAM_allocate_resources_for_ballots: "Allocate Resources For Ballots"
SAM_allocate_resources_for_ballots_desc: "The trouble with Democracy is that you have to rely on millions of individuals working in tandem to make your system work. Too many "democracies" only care about the opinions of the elite or the cosmopolitan crust of society. Ignorance leads to resentment, resentment leads to anger, and anger leads to extremism. That's the way it has always been.\n\nThat's why it's so crucial that every man and woman gets the ability to vote, no matter where they live. They could live in Novosibirsk or Norilsk, it does not matter. What matters is that even our most humble of citizens can cast their vote in a free society. A society that is...how the Americans say it...run by the people, for the people."
SAM_new_plans_for_representation: "New Plans For Representation"
SAM_new_plans_for_representation_desc: "The trouble with Democracy is that you have to rely on millions of individuals working in tandem to make your system work. What if the people are idiots? We have come too far for our beloved Russia to fall victim to the vices of extremism and chronic incompetence. Russia may be a democracy, but we will not go out like Weimar did - trapped in an endless cycle of cruelty and despair.\n\nThat's why it's so crucial that we guide the people on who they should vote for, when it comes down to the ballot. We could have a nice, sensible party that has moderate views on tariffs and the Gold Standard. On the other hand, there's always the chance that it results in a totalitarian hellstate run by bandits disguised as glad-handed politicians. By giving them a nice, controlled selection of parties, we can make sure that the people don't do anything idiotic. Not that they would, of course."
SAM_a_few_more_options_cant_hurt: "A Few More Options Can't Hurt"
SAM_a_few_more_options_cant_hurt_desc: "No, the solution to Democracy's flaws is not "freedom", or "representation." It is a matter of choice. America has only a few parties to choose from, while Japan and Germany had only one! The latter aren't democracies, but America is not a model Republic. In their quest for true "liberty", they have found themselves in a rut, where many are disillusioned with the binary choice that they're given.\n\nOur solution is simple. Give them more choices! It does not matter that these parties answer to us, what matters is that their subtle differences in minutiae attract our people into voting for them. Our people will be so consumed in debating minor details, that they'll cease to argue about our "lack of democracy." Insolent jabber, of course. Streamlining democracy is hardly the same thing as destroying it."
SAM_do_not_break_what_works: "Do Not Break What Works"
SAM_do_not_break_what_works_desc: "The needs of the state must come before the uncertainty of liberty, and right now, security remains paramount. While there are certainly many who wish to participate in these elections, the fact is that allowing uncertain or unknown elements - be they supposedly friendly to us or not - into the delicate mechanisms of governance risks more discord than stability.\n\nFree elections of course remain a priority for the future - but for now it is too risky. We will still maintain the elections, but we will ensure that the options are limited only to those who we are certain will not disrupt the existing order. Until our state is in a stable place, such measures must be maintained.\n\nThe transition to democracy is a process, and right now we are only on the first step."
SAM_a_benevolent_show_of_my_popularity: "A Benevolent Show of My Popularity"
SAM_a_benevolent_show_of_my_popularity_desc: "We are victorious!\n\nThis trial was arduous and challenging, but now all of West Russia lies under our control. Our nation now stands, freed of the foul influences of corruptive ideologies, greed, and incompetence that plagued Samara and the other illegitimate warlord states. A new hope for Russia has emerged, one that is strong, stable, and triumphant.\n\nNow that we have won, and order properly restored, we will begin the process of elections. All of the parties we have approved will now put forward their candidates, and the people of Russia will soon take part in a free, and very fair vote. "
