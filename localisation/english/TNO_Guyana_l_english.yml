  GUY_Forbes_Burnham_hog_desc: "§YPrime Minister\nPeople's National Congress§!\n--------------\n§Lplaceholder§!"
  GUY_John_Carter_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nPeople's National Congress§!\n--------------\n§LA lawyer who practiced and taught law in London during the war, John Carter is a staunch ally of Forbes Burnham who has been associated with him since 1957, when he joined Burnham's People's National Congress and became its first chairman.\n\nAppointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs in part to give Burnham an ally in the cabinet, he has so far served effectively in his official role, though it has left him with little time to assist Burnham politically.§!"
  GUY_Lionel_Luckhoo_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nThe United Force§!\n--------------\n§LAs well known for his loyalty to Peter d'Aguiar as he is for his ability as a lawyer, Lionel Luckhoo is d'Aguiar's most able ally in the cabinet.\n\nHaving served in parliament in the 1950s, then as Mayor of Georgetown from 1955 to 1960, it was during his mayoral tenure that he became associated with Peter, and after the latter's victory in the 1961 elections, Lionel was among the first to join the United Force party. He now serves as the Minister of Finance in the coalition government.§!"
  GUY_Plotemy_Reid_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Home Affairs\nPeople's National Congress§!\n--------------\n§LOnce a teacher, then a veterinarian, Ptolemy Reid now finds himself among the most powerful men in the land. After graduating from his studies in veterinary medicine at the Tuskegee Institute, he was initially unable to find employment in Guyana, but eventually found a position as the Chief Veterinary Officer at the center of the powerful sugar plantation industry in Guyana, the Bookers Sugar Estate.\n\nBecoming involved in politics in 1960 as a member of Forbes Burnham's PNC, he is known to have a bit of an independent streak, and Peter d'Aguiar is convinced that Reid can be won over with enough patience. For his part, Burnham is convinced of Reid's ultimate loyalty to him. Only time will tell which of the two is right.§!"

  POLITICS_Cheddi_Jagan_DESC: "The founder and longtime leader of the PPP, Cheddi Jagan is a man either adored or despised in the political world. The former President of Guyana, his tenure was marked by severe resistance both within and outside of his own party and splits over various policies. He left the post after losing an election to Forbes Burnham despite much reluctance on his part, largely due to outside pressure from the United States. Cheddi is not a man easily put down for good, however, and he has once again taken charge of all of Guyana. Following Burnhams authoritarian actions, the USA invited Cheddi Jagan to lead a reconstruction government as long as he delayed his radical economic plans, Jagan accepted.This time, with the knowledge of what led to his past failures, perhaps he can finally implement socialism in Guyana."
  POLITICS_Peter_D_Aguiar_DESC: "Considered by most to be the fiercest defender of conservatism and capitalism in all of Guyana, Peter d'Aguiar is a man loved by many and loathed by the rest. He contested the 1951 elections on behalf of the National Democratic Party, but chose not to run in 1955 or 1957.\n\nWith the split in the PPP between Forbes Burnham and Cheddi Jagan, however, Peter formed the Defenders of Freedom, an anti-communist political organization allied with the Catholic Church seeking to protect and advocate for conservative policies. After negotiating an alliance with Burnham for the 1961 election in an effort to ensure Jagan's removal from power, Burnham and his allies successfully won the election. D'Aguiar transformed his following into the 'The United Force' political party and has governed uneasily alongside Burnham's PNC.\n\nHe now seeks to put his ideals into action in Guyana, but internal troubles within his coalition and tensions with Venezuela may see these hopes ground to dust."

  GUY_Elizabeth_British_Legacy: "The British Legacy"
  GUY_Elizabeth_British_Legacy_desc: "Despite the British Empire being dead, the ghost of the Empire remains at large within Guyana. While rule under the USA was short and quickly lead to an independent Guyanan democracy, British influence remains deep. British businessmen own large swaths of the Guyanese economy and the political system remains closely tied to the Westminster system, of a Prime Minister with the Queen Elizabeth as Head of State.\n\nWhile Cheddi Jagan's administration sponsored decolonization programs, with some businesses being expropriated by the state, the creation of a welfare state and even creating a new flag, Peter D'Aguiar is not interested in continuing these programs and supports the retainment of the Westminster system.\n\nResentment runs deep in Guyana against the colonial past, and as long as its traces remain, the resentment will remain as well."
  
  GUY_Venezuela_border_dispute: "Essequibo Dispute"
  GUY_Venezuela_border_dispute_desc: "The border dispute with Venezuela, once thought quashed has once again reared its ugly head.\n\nVenezuela claimed more than half of the territory of the British colony of Guyana at the time of the Latin American wars of independence. While Guyana thought the boundary was clarified in the Arbitral Award of 1899, Venezuela has called the award an Anglo conspiracy.\n\nWith the independence of Guyana in 1950, Venezuela declared that it would no longer abide by the arbitration decision and has laid claim to the Guayana Esequiba. Venezuela has a larger army and the power to seize this region by force, however the USA has sided with Guyana so far in this conflict, and a direct confrontation would jeopardize their approachment to the OFN. To ensure Venezuela never makes a grab for the territory, we must remain in the OFN and cultivate relations with America."
  GUY_Venezuela_border_dispute_tt: "§RThe dispute may threaten the unity of the OFN.§!"

  GUY_US_investment: "American Investment"
  GUY_US_investment_desc: "One of the conditions for Guyanese independence was their position in the OFN as an American ally and access to Guyana's economic markets. While investment has taken place since independence, many investors were scared away by Jagan and his socialist policies.\n\nWith the election of Peter D'Aguiar and his economically liberal party, he has attracted many American businesses to invest in Guyana's small economy.\n\nGuyana has now entered a period of an economic boom and as long as the money continues to flow, the economy will continue to grow."
  
  GUY_Fragile_Coalition: "A Fragile Coalition"
  GUY_Fragile_Coalition_desc: "Despite the PPP governing Guyana for the entirety of the 1950s, they were defeated in the elections of 1961 due to an electoral alliance between the two opposition parties of the TUF led by Peter D'Aguir and the People's National Congress led by Forbes Burnham. This alliance born out of necessity to remove the PPP from power, must now collaborate in government.\n\nThe coalition is not stable and in the short time it has been in power there have already been several rifts over key policies. The alliance only remains together to ensure that the PPP does not call a vote of no confidence and win the following elections. However, as time goes on and more rifts emerge, most have agreed that it only remains a matter of time until the coalition inevitably collapses."
