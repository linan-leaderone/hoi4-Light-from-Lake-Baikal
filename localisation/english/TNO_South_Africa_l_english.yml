 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_VILLIERS_GRAAFF_DESC: "Succeeding his father's position as Baronet of Cape Town, De Villiers Graaff soon entered the ring of South African politics. He had worked his way from the lower echelons, starting his career as a member of the House of Assembly and eventually, his hard labor and commitments paid off, as he was elected to lead the United Party in '56. It seemed to Graaff that his ascension to power as Prime Minister was dutifully needed and to succeed, he had to balance the delicate house of cards and maneuver his way through the system to prevent his nation from tearing itself apart.\n\nSince his appointment, Graaff worked tirelessly to maintain his balancing act to preserve the fragile equilibrium South Africa had. The bulk of the problems mostly lay from the ramblings of the National Party and Boers, who stalked him with malice, armed with daggers, waiting for a chance to backstab him and break free. Another problem was the African National Congress, an organization established by a conglomeration of blacks who take to the streets and protest daily, all waiting for their long promised rights and fairer treatment. Naturally, Graaff's solution was clear: Suppress both sides, play them against each other, and maybe, just maybe, negotiate some terms to successfully quell their resistance.\n\nThe year is 1962, and South Africa teeters towards a collision course. Both the NP and the ANC are getting restless, becoming more radical and dangerous to the government each passing day. The Germans await at the border, sharpening their claws for when they can dig into the fresh meat of the Cape Colony, threatening to destroy the liberty of its people. Prime Minister De Villiers Graff must steer his nation in the right course and prepare accordingly, lest all his hard-worked effort be destroyed in one fell swoop."
 POLITICS_CONNIE_MULDER_DESC: "Connie Mulder is a disillusioned man. For years, he worked to bring the National Party to power, first as a councilman, then as a mayor, and finally, as an officer during the war. Even more so, he was one of the Transvaal Boer's most pro-German politicians, staunchly opposing any expansion of American influence into South Africa. Yet for all of this, he now leads the revolt against those he wished to see rule.\n\nMulder watched in horror as the Afrikaner Volkstaat which he helped bring about was torn apart between its slavish loyalty to Hüttig's regime in Bouhlerstadt, the ceaseless native resistance to its existence, and the extremists in the Volksraad. Slowly but surely, the former teacher established connection with United Party politicians, knowing full well the regime couldn't last. Then came the overthrow of Hertzog, and it was worse than Mulder imagined.\n\nWhen the fragile government collapsed in the face of Malan's coup, Mulder was the only man with connections to both Boer loyalists and United Party politicians, and so he was unanimously elected President of a restored South Africa, with all three votes. In a sense, Mulder is little more than a puppet for the special interests who back his government, whose ultimate end is to restore the pre 1964 constitution. However, he also personifies the factionalism that the reborn South African state suffers from: As a lifelong segregationist, he is at odds with the remnants of the United Party who wish to use the war as an opportunity to end the practice once and for all."
 POLITICS_TAFFY_WILLIAMS_DESC: "Only the most insane of men would attempt to actively insert themselves into the hellish nightmare that was Hüttig's Africa. One such man was Taffy Williams.\n\nAfter briefly serving in the Zentalafrikan Wars during the 1950s, Williams returned to Europe for service by HMMLR during the British Civil War, missing out on the first two South African Wars due to the American blockade. However, Robert Oppenheimer's need for loyal mercenaries to protect the DeBeers-Anglo corporation, and now, to prop up his new "Republic," ensured the Englishman's return to the battlefields south of the Sahara.\n\nSmuggled into Mozambique in the aftermath of the Second South African War, Williams was made head of the "DeBeers Protection Forces," an organization that has now become synonymous with the South African Army. In collaboration with remnants of South African and Volkstaat militaries, Williams effectively protected the company's assets from retribution by the SS until news of Hüttig's death came.\n\nFollowing plans carefully laid by Oppenheimer, William's mercenaries easily toppled the disintegrating German administration, installing what is nominally a Republic with Oppenheimer as President. However, it is obvious that the government is little more than a front for corporate dominance, and that, for the moment, it is Taffy Williams, and not the President, who calls the shots."

The De Beers corporation, founded by Cecil Rhodes, and now run by Harry Oppenheimer from Cape Town has full control of the extraction and trade of the precious stones. By working closely with De Beers, not only have we opened doors to both the OFN and the Einheitspakt's economies, but we now have the means to turn our country into a proudly developed nation - if we can avoid the ire of the powers breathing down our necks, that is.\n\nWe gain £GFX_diamond_texticon [?SAF_diamond_gain|G0] [get.SAF_diamond_plural_gain] a month.\nWe have £GFX_diamond_texticon [?SAF_diamond_count|G0] [get.SAF_diamond_plural].\n\nTrade with the Pakt is [SAFPaktTradeAvailable].\nPakt displeasure with us is at [?SAF_Pakt_Displeasure|R0%]"

 SAF_Boer_Viet_Cong_desc:0 "Armed Afrikaner paramilitary groups aren't a new phenomenon in South African history. However, many of these groups, bolstered by strong public support and RK influence, are conducting operations in South African territory with the goal of overthrowing the government. We must deal with this problem, or a free South Africa will cease to exist."
 SAF_The_Empty_Throne:0 "The Empty Throne"
 SAF_The_Empty_Throne_desc:0 "Whilst South Africa officially still has a monarchy, in reality the throne has remained empty since the death of King George VI. With the government never having recognised either Edward VIII or Elizabeth II out of a desire to antagonize neither the OFN nor the Einheitspakt, the position of the monarch has remained in limbo for nearly a decade. Whilst the government has so far remained unwilling to budge on the issue, public opinion is increasingly asking why South Africa continues to have a monarchy at all."

We were able to quickly overrun them in similar fashion to the Second World War. However, recent developments have given us more trouble than we would like to admit. The South Africans are beginning to utilize methods of warfare that we had not anticipated. The enemy now hides, making full use of their landscape to avoid direct confrontation. We now face ambushes and traps rather than conventional battles. Our soldiers are struggling to adapt to this dramatic shift in the war. Unless we can adjust equally as quickly, we suspect that the fight will rage on for longer than we could have anticipated."

Even as our troops begin to adjust to guerrilla warfare, the South Africans have begun changing their tactics one again. Ambushes are starting to take place behind the lines, focusing on our supply columns and bases. The men are suffering mentally from the constant raids too, as no matter where they are, the chance of an attack becomes increasingly common. The structure of South African divisions are shifting too. When captured, they have nothing of value to tell us, as their units now operate independently from their own high command. We must meet this problem head on."

Now we find only new and frustrating surprises on the front lines and behind them. Our troops might take several miles of ground in a day, only to be driven back by their camp being set ablaze during the night. The issues with supplies continue, as the South Africans always seem to know which routes we are using, as we discover when our trucks detonate mines buried in the dirt. Even our air force now useless, as trying to bomb underground targets is a gamble at best. What scant few casualties we inflict pales in comparison to what the South Africans inflict with each of their raids. Nowhere is safe now, and there is very little we can do about it."

Despite our government's recent efforts to improve their standing, the Africans still live in poverty and without even basic services.\n\nOur reforms, however, have caused another drift, this time within the white community: the Boers, descendants of the first Dutch colonists, deeply believe in racial segregation, and think that what we are doing will only grant the "coloured" the chance to rebel against their masters.\n\nThis brings us to the most pressing issue: the Germans are funneling support to the National Party. The three Reichskommissariats claim they do it "to protect fellow Aryans of Dutch descent against runaway slaves and to establish peaceful relations on their southern borders", but everyone knows that the Boers are the perfect tool to add South Africa to their list of colonies...\n\nNo matter what, South Africa will endure.

There are those, even within our government, who believe in reconciliation with the National Party in the name of a "Government of the Civilized" against the native threat; from their point of view, the best way to win the Afrikaan vote would be a crackdown against rebel Negroes, followed by a general strengthening of the police to guarantee order.\n\nThere is no more time to delay: we need to make a choice now."

 SAF.2.t:0 "Republicans Win South African Referendum"
 SAF.2.desc:0 "Cape Town (AP) - The United Party of South Africa suffered a major defeat when a referendum to declare the South African Federation a republic was approved by voters. The proposal, endorsed by the opposition National Party, would eliminate the federation's placement under the British crown, cutting the last official ties with the British Empire.\n\nThe referendum proved highly controversial, with support breaking down entirely on ethnic and political lines. Many Afrikaners supported the referendum, while those of British heritage opposed it. Political faults were also ruptured, with Prime Minister De Villiers Graaff campaigning heavily against the referendum, while the opposition headed up the ultimately successful campaign for it.\n\nMany referendum supporters accused the ruling United Party of heavy handed tactics to suppress the vote, while frequent allegations of racism have plagued the republican campaign. A sizable minority of support for the referendum was from extremist right-wing Boer nationalists, such as the Boer Kommando, who saw it as a necessary step to removing the English-dominated United Party from power. Despite the victory, many of these groups are arming and organizing, claiming that the United Party will try to subvert the will of the people and keep the monarchy in power."

 SAF.18.t:0 "Albert Hertzog Calls a National Vigil"
 SAF.18.desc:0 "The death of Adolf Hitler has come to the ears of the National Party. And they answered it with sorrow and passion; at the call of Hertzog, members of the party are to come together so they may hold a vigil for the Führer.\n\nAnd in the name of the man they seem to mourn, they are calling for a week exclusive to Hitler's respect. People should light candles for the fallen German, businesses, they demand, should close down.\n\nReports of armed Boer men are reaching us, the details suggesting that they are organized by the National Party and are not only providing 'security' for the mourners but also forcing business to close down and threatening their political opponents. From Port Elizabeth up to Pietersburg, it seems that this is not something we cannot ignore. Hertzog is making a very interesting gamble on the behalf of his party, cleverly using this vigil as a way of rallying his supporters.\n\nHertzog proclaims that his lockdown of the country will stay until the South African government pay proper respects to Adolf Hitler and denounce what they called the Anglo-American imperialist interference on South Africa. We cannot let this happen. We cannot allow this to become greater than it is. They are defying the Dominion!"
 SAF.18.a:0 "Get them under control!"

 SAF.19.t:0 "Police Refuses to Crack Down on National Party"
 SAF.19.desc:0 "We have a problem. The police was sent to disperse the Boers' vigil, but it seems that things are not going the way we want them to. One of the officers, Eugène Terre'Blanche, has refused to carry out his orders. He has gone over to the Boers, joining them as his fellow officers either observed him in shock or followed his example and deserted too.\n\nAccording to reports, the crowd was roused to applaud him. He spoke to them, delivering a big speech by the side of Hertzog, praising his policies and one independent Boer Nation. Terre'Blanche was known inside the SAP as especially devoted to the ideals of the National Party, seems that he's letting himself free to do as he pleases against any authority.\n\nSouth Africa cannot approve this. The whole country is watching him receive a glorious ovation from the masses out in the streets, insulting the authority of the Government. We are losing control of the situation. Not only he is defecting to them. Thanks to his actions, the rest of our officers are refusing to disperse the protests. If we do not do something soon, we may lose the country!"
 SAF.19.a:0 "Those Boers must be stopped! The army must be sent in!"

 SAF.35.t:0 "When It Began"
 SAF.35.desc:0 "History has had a fascination for seminal events since mankind learned to write their names with stone and chisel.\n\nThe intuitive drive to envision the disorder that surrounds men as a series of causes and effects instills itself into common sense, so tempting them to regard certain happenstances as larger-than-life moments shifting time's course. A Serb ending an archduke's life, common sense would thus say, began a war that snuffed a continent's lamplights forever. A threat for a Polish port heralded a new order over Europe and the wider world. Thrice again, a grisly massacre in Cape Town marked the beginning of Africa's latest tragedy.\n\nBut common sense is faulty and full of holes. Human intuition is no less fallible in writing South Africa's narratives than in any other war it has seen. What it believes is a gargantuan conflict's violent outset is instead its largest battle up to that point -- the conflagration among a teetering powderkeg's flickers.\n\nOne such flicker emerged in a polling station in Pretoria, weeks before the nation decides between Dominion and Republic. Census workers found themselves harried by an assemblage of Boers, armed and exuberant. Not to be outdone, the Majesty's loyal subjects -- not His or Her Majesty, South Africa remained at an impasse over whose crown they swore fealty -- rallied onto the streets to meet the Afrikaners head-to-head. They carried the same guns and shared the same patrimony; nevertheless, their opinions over its destiny cannot be reconciled. Tensions simmered in the standoff, ugly differences brought to light with shouts and jeers.\n\nThen a shot rang loud. A man crumpled atop a pool of blood. Shouts became screams as muzzle flash lit the streets. A state of emergency postponed the referendum in Pretoria until further notice. The Boers rendered it moot weeks later.\n\nWho shot first was lost to time, but its aftereffects foreshadowed the years to come: democracy strangled at the crib; hundreds laid lifeless along the blood-soaked pavements; and a city whose infernos rose to mingle with the reddish hue of the sunset sky"
 SAF.35.a:0 "A continent plunged in years of twilight."

 SAF.36.t:0 "Escape from Robben Island"
 SAF.36.desc:0 "Amidst the chaos caused by uprisings from the ANC and the Boers, our national security has suffered yet another blow. Last night, off the coast of Cape Town, a shockingly large formation of small go-fast boats were able to bypass our searchlights and land on Robben Island. From there, the boats' passengers-a number of highly-trained ANC militants-used mining explosives to blast a hole in the wall of the island's feared Maximum Security Prison. The guards, in the middle of a shift change, were undermanned and unprepared. What with the current military situation, many of them had already been retasked to other parts of the country. This failure to prioritize doomed the rest. After a number of desperate firefights in the prison's corridors, the guards were all killed or incapacitated, and the militants could make their escape. Accompanying them were a number of the island's most infamous prisoners.\n\nGovan Mbeki.\n\nOliver Tambo.\n\nNelson Mandela.\n\nAs alarms screamed across the island, the boats made their way back to the mainland. Already, there are calls in the press for an investigation into this utter failure of security. Police are blocking off major roads, but it's most likely that the escapees are already far from our grasp"
 SAF.36.a:0 "How could this have happened?"

 SAF.37.t:0 "The Cape Town Massacre"
 SAF.37.desc:0 "Troops arrived at Cape Town, their transports reaching the grounds of the Parliament. They swiftly came out of them, forming up against the protestors, obeying the orders of their officers, sergeants shouting at their men to move more quickly.\n\nThings would have gone well had it not been for a series of unfortunate events. The protestors, surprised but also provoked at the army's presence, stood their ground, refusing to leave. The troops kept telling them but the Boers were pressing against them. Barricades were toppled, protestors were picking up rocks and throwing them at the men and rumors of armed Boers coming to help their kinsmen fight back were getting to the soldiers.\n\nConfused orders came through. Instructions to the contrary were issued. These mixed with the shouts of the protesters, the din of strife, and the sirens of abandoned police cars made the worst happen. In just several bursts from the rifles and carbines of the soldiers, forty people, none of them with weapons as feared by the alarmed troops, lay dead on the ground. The crowds were now dispersing, but not because they wanted to. They had to. Their brothers and sisters, their mothers and their fathers, they were scattered upon the ground, broken and bleeding.\n\nIt was a horrifying massacre. And the news of this came all over South Africa, turning the entire land against the Armed Forces. Only the worst can come out of this now."
 SAF.37.a:0 "It is too late now to go back."

 SAF.38.t:0 "The ANC Revolts!"
 SAF.38.desc:0 "At approximately 0700 hours, a number of police stations in the eastern coastal city of Durban went silent. Over the course of the morning, it became clear that this wasn't a coincidence. Emergency broadcasts from military units in the air quickly poured in.\n\nLOUIS BOTHA AIRPORT FALLEN\n\nSALISBURY ISLAND UNDER HEAVY ASSAULT\n\nPORTS IN REBEL HANDS\n\nCivilian radio stations started broadcasting exhortations in Zulu and Xhosa, calling on the native peoples of South Africa to rise up and overthrow their colonial overlords. Some broadcasts even noted that, with the ongoing Boer revolt, the opportunity for revolution has never been greater. Mere hours later, the few surviving security units in Durban began evacuating south, as the ANC's uMkhonto we Sizwe declared the city to be in free African hands. Meanwhile, similar assaults have begun in other cities across the country. Clearly, our nation's crises will not be limited to the Boers."
 SAF.38.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

 SAF.39.t:0 "The Civil War Begins!"
 SAF.39.desc:0 "The slaughter at Cape Town was just the start in a wave of blood crashing on our nation. The most of our Afrikaner citizens are now openly hostile, rallying around the head of the National Party, Albert Hertzog, who has declared us to be criminals and illegitimate leaders. His followers have taken weapons into their hands. There's no turning back now, a civil war is upon us.\n\nSouth Africa is coming apart, the great cities of Pretoria, Johannesburg, and Bloemfontein are falling into the control of the Boers. Angry militias are sprouting up all over the land, turning their weapons on anyone they think is on the side of the Government. The law of the land is lost and any semblance of order we once had is destroyed.\n\nThere is no way out of this but to fight. The more ground we lose to these people, the more our Republic steps closer to the grave which have been dug. Some might say this was our fault, but we must accept it quickly and begin our defence. For sooner or later, these Boers will be joined by those damned Germans from planed it all from the north! If war must be the only way out of this alive, if shedding more of the blood of these men can put an end to the division of our land, then so be it! We will stand our own ground too, and we will by no means tolerate another conflict with these cursed rebels! South Africa will fight to keep itself alive and to keep itself united despite everything."
 SAF.39.a:0 "For South Africa, our land!"

 SAF.40.t:0 "Smash the Dominoes!"
 SAF.40.desc:0 "The time has come for the ultimate battle against fascism! The last stand against autocracy abroad and worldwide, a final glorious crusade against the forces of evil that have forced the free people's of the world under their autocratic jackboots. With one fell sweep, we will stop the Nazis from securing a new foothold in Africa, for if we do not, surely the brutal invasion of our South Africans will only be the beginning. If Africa falls, next falls India, then with the east secured, the Nazis will soon be in the Americas as well!\n\nAt least, this is the sentiment that every American general with a foot in the White House door has loudly shouted, berated the Senate over, rallied their troops with and harassed the media with as seemingly every man who has ever held a gun has proclaimed the time for a 'final battle' against the fascist menace.\n\nWhile many members of the Republican-Democratic Coalition have seemed nervous over the situation, proposing some doubts that this 'Domino Theory' is as immediate a threat as proposed, or that entering war with direct servants of the Reich can end in anything besides a greater conflict, it is most surprising that several members of the NPP have stepped across the Senate aisle to agree. Leftists in the NPP have questioned what, exactly, the RDC dominated military establishment proposes as any end goal in this conflict, and what plan they may have to deal with Africa even if there is some sort of victory, while the far right of the party has showed some suspicious hesitance to do battle with the fascists.\n\nRegardless, however, the President seems dead-set on a policing action in the nation, President Nixon seemingly hoping that a knock out punch on the Reichskommissars will save his flagging administration and halt the impending impeachment vote."
 SAF.40.a:0 "Goodbye my darling, hello Kuruman!"

 SAF.41.t:0 "The Summit Begins!"
 SAF.41.desc:0 "Emissaries from the Organization of Free Nations member states have gathered today in Washington, D.C. to discuss the ongoing developments in South Africa.\n\n"The spectre of fascism has struck the Dominion of South Africa in its moment of weakness," President Nixon said as he greeted ambassadors and ministers from five countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Guyana and the West Indies Federation, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. "We, as an alliance of democracies, are obliged to protect democracy not merely within our borders, but wherever it flourishes without. The Free World cannot afford another setback, like it had in Europe, in Asia, in the Pacific -- a line must be drawn, one way or the other. If we must draw it across the Kalahari, then so be it."\n\nUnder threat from both an insurrection and a surprise invasion by German forces in the continent, Africa's last democracy has urged the United States and its allies for immediate military support. The White House is expected to issue a resolution for an intervention into the South African conflict in the following weeks, although details regarding the scale and participants thereof are currently unknown..."
 SAF.41.a:0 "The giant shifts from its slumber."

 SAF.42.t:0 "See South Africa!"
 SAF.42.desc:0 "In recent weeks, Americans have been treated with an unusual addition to their primetime schedules' standard fares.\n\nBreaks in between runs of nightly sitcoms, usually reserved for advertisements from Coca Cola and Ford and a hundred other sponsors, instead show montages of rolling savannahs, cresting mountains and vibrant cities from a faraway land called South Africa. Backdropped by an instrumentalized version of God Save the Queen, a grandfatherly voice soothingly extols the life of a nation few have heard, let alone seen. But that was fine, he assures; for a minute of a family's time, South Africa will visit them in their own homes. Mayhaps soon they will visit South Africa too.\n\nThese advertisements are the brainchildren of Edison Cook, newest chairman of the South African Broadcasting Corporation and co-founder of the nascent American South Africa Public Affairs Committee. Tasked by Cape Town to "encourage closer ties between two free nations parted only by one ocean", he has successfully negotiated air time from each of America's country's Big Three networks for his organization's extensive public awareness campaign. Observant commentators have remarked of the concurrence between Mr. Cook's campaign and the commencement of hostilities in South Africa.\n\nDespite the veteran broadcaster's optimism, and his blank check, only time will tell if the imperiled democracy's newest ploy to sway America's spirit towards its defence will bear fruit."

 SAF.43.t:0 "A Kimberley Tragedy"
 SAF.43.desc:0 "Harold Howard, like his father and his father before him, was a farmer with a homestead north of Kimberley. There he grew wheat, corn and many other crops with his wife Laura, his daughters Annie and Kylie, and the family's farmhands Johan and Mattys. Farming demanded backbreaking and routine labor from the 52 year-old father and his family -- every day in the Highveld began with work at five and ended with work at seven -- but Harold saw no need for things to change anytime soon. A farmer he has been, he thought, and a farmer he will always be.\n\n"But months prior to the war, Harold realized his farmhands had been returning from the weekly trip to Kimberly erratically late. Years of habit established thus: They would leave at eight with a lorry full of produce, sell them to markets around the city, and come back home before lunch. Nowadays they would return between then and sundown at the latest. Harold had a mind to ask them what they've been doing, but ultimately held his peace. He'd trusted the Boer boys with his money for ten years now; why shouldn't he trust them on how they spend their time every Sunday?\n\n"Harold thought his life won't ever change. He also thought he shouldn't ask questions when it did. So imagine his surprise when Johan Anderson and Mattys Bosman returned to the farm at eight PM... with a lorryful of armed men.\n\n"The poor man neither spoke nor wrote of the events that followed as he recuperated in the city hospital, only that he escaped by the skin of his teeth. Laura, Annie and Kylie were absent from his bullet-ridden truck..."\n\n-- excerpt from Tales from the Bush."

 SAF.44.t:0 "Christians for Freedom"
 SAF.44.desc:0 "In most Sundays, the sermon at the Church of Jesus Christ the Savior begins with a reading from the New Testament. The Lord's words were timeless and granted prescient wisdom to any era with every reading. As the world seems mired in a decade of strife, His pleas to treat fellow men of all races and creeds as brothers ring loud like gunshots for America's laity.\n\nBut today was special. Before a congregation of nearly fifty pious Americans, Reverend Isiah Hickenlooper began his sermon with an allusion to Father Abraham.\n\n"Brothers and sisters," boomed the Reverend to the spellbound attendants. "Near five score to this day, our forefathers were unchained from slavery by the fires of war. Men who had been uprooted from one continent to another had at long last met the jubilee they were promised. But even now the friends and families they had left behind remain yoked by empires: the Englishmen, the Frenchmen, and now the fascists of Nazi Germany."\n\n"Shortfalled we may be, but we are luckier than our cousins in the Dark Continent. We have the pretense of rights; they have not. We can live our whole lives without bearing the scars of whips; they cannot. We are masters of our own destinies; they are not! No, my friends -- they have not tasted freedom for three hundred years! And they will never taste freedom for three hundred more unless something is done!"\n\nReverend Hickenlooper's flock is one of several who have organized the "Christians for Freedom", in support of President Nixon's intent to intervene in the South Africa conflict. This national band of pastors and preachers have since agitated for a campaign to free German slaves in Africa -- a sentiment that hearkens heavily to America's own war waged against slavery.\n\nLike heavy gears made to turn, the nation's faithful are roused into a 20th-century crusade by an abolitionist spirit not seen since the mid-19th. This animus manifested itself when Sunday Mass for Reverend Hickenlooper's Alabama church ended not with benedictions, but with the spontaneous utterance of a jubilant tune passed from father to son."

 SAF.45.t:0 "Ships on the Horizon"
 SAF.45.desc:0 "A stormy night in the South Atlantic. A Südwestafrikan patrol boat monitoring the waters off the coast of Alexander Bay is periodically hit by waves from the bow, washing over the vessel. In the light of a thunderstrike, one of the crew spots something, and motions to the captain. The sighting is confirmed, to his horror. He starts relaying an emergency message to the Kriegsmarine command in Lüderitz. Many vessels, various types, markings unknown. He tries to give off as much information as he is able, until a broadside of Mark 42 guns ends his broadcast permanently.\n\nThe report, though brief and vague, sets off a scramble across Africa, as a massive effort to confirm the report is undertaken. Eventually, an aerial reconnaissance flight returns with pictures that send an enormous wave of dread throughout the entire Schild. There can be no doubting it now, the Americans have arrived with their Sixth Fleet.\n\nGone is any semblance of German naval superiority. Shattered are any dreams of ending this war through a quick and daring naval invasion of the Cape. The seas belong to the cruisers and frigates of the American Navy, its skies to the flights of aircraft lined on the decks of the carriers. The fleet is of such a size that no one would dream of taking it on with the ships of the Schild. In one stroke, it appears the Americans have achieved victory at sea for the South African War."
 SAF.45.a:0 "The light at the end?"

 SAF.46.t:0 "Gifts from Uncle Sam"
 SAF.46.desc:0 "Not all of America's gifts were purely benign, however. Hidden underneath the hustle and bustle that ensued were crates devoid of the "MADE IN USA" stencils borne by the majority of unladen containers. Eagle-eyed witnesses would spot men in the khakis of the South African Union Defence Force carrying these unmarked crates to equally unmarked warehouses. If the revelry deterred them little from inspecting, then the glares of armed guards cratered their curiosity for them instead.\n\nInside, the crates were pried open to reveal cargo just as precious, if not moreso, than cans of American food: racks of American M16s, belts of American 5.56 mm bullets, boxes of American radios, barrels of American mortars and bazookas. Some of the crates packed creatively disassembled American field guns and artillery. When asked, the attendants remarked only of "misplaced" equipment from the US Navy. A scarce trickle of it, they admitted, but it will have to do until better channels are approved and relayed.\n\nIn his apparent wisdom, President Nixon has approved clandestine measures to partly supply South Africa's wanting men with the implements they need to stem the fascist tide. Should we tell our people and the world of these gifts?"
 SAF.46.a:0 "To every radio and TV screen."
 SAF.46.b:0 "No one has to know..."

 SAF.47.t:0 "American Muscle"
 SAF.47.desc:0 "As debates rage in Washington over what scraps to send South Africa's way and when, New York Harbor is host to a one-in-a-lifetime scene: thousands of cargo trucks, lined up like a row of ducks, waiting patiently for a crane to pack them on a cargo ship's deck. Packed with more trucks than most towns have cars, these ships will soon depart for the faraway shores of the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nIn anticipation of an invasion of Europe and the Japanese Home Islands, the US Army issued General Motors a contract to produce their reliable CCKW trucks during the Second World War. The Pentagon expected hundreds of thousands of the so-called "deuce-and-a-halfs" forming the core of the Army's ocean-wide supply train. Detroit was more than capable and willing to fulfil such a lucrative contract, going so far as to reach its agreed-upon orders by spring 1945.\n\nUnfortunately, the invasion plans they were built to buttress were scrapped when mushroom clouds engulfed Pearl Harbor later that year. A good number entered the civilian market after the war -- just as many were left to flake off their army green paint jobs in warehouses across the fifty states.\n\nThe war in South Africa is akin to a second calling for these unused, unsung warriors. When Cape Town asked for trucks of all kinds to support their war effort, the White House and GM immediately had the other in mind. Days later South Africa agreed to take several thousands of GM's leftover CCKWs for a pittance of how much they cost GM to make, but several orders of magnitude more than the cost to bring them back to proper function. In other words, a rare win-win deal in the history of international trade.\n\nThough they were denied the war they were born to fight, the venerable deuce-and-a-half now joins the veld with factory-fresh engines, desert camo paint and the South African Union Defence Force's insignias on its sides. Hopes are high that it will perform there with the same gallantry it had shown the world twenty years ago."

The lands covered in black represent the Slave World; those in white represent the Free World -- our world, with the freedoms and luxuries that come with. Each torch stands for one free nation; because of World War Two, most of them lie in the Western Hemisphere. Germany, Italy, and Japan have made most of the rest their slaves.\n\n'Note the lone torch at the very tip of Africa, the continent right below Europe. That is South Africa: Its sole democracy. Once a lion within the British Empire's great pride, South Africa is now a lion without a family to call his own. High above him, black buzzards circle as they wait for the moment to strike.\n\nNow the ugly beasts have swooped down for the kill -- but first, a glimpse of the country in question. What makes South Africa special in the concert of nations? Why must we pay attention to its plight? Though it stands as a beacon of hope amidst a continent swathed in darkness, it still seems an ocean too far for any American to care overmuch for its fortunes.

 SAF.49.desc:0 "Accustomed as they are to the dark hair that accompanies either pale, fair or swarthy complexions, the assemblage that filtered out of the St. Ignatius in Cape Town harbor seemed like aliens from Mars for Cape Town's inhabitants: Pale, blond-haired, and blue-eyed. Wearing sharply tailored doctors' suits and nurses' caps, they stopped for neither the city's fine sights nor its fine people as they hurried to the Observatory's Groote Schuur Hospital. Befuddled onlookers wonder of the stoic, no-nonsense medicine men they were now saddled with.\n\nThis peculiar host of doctors and nurses is, of course, Iceland's own little commitment to the OFN's budding front in South Africa. Much to his dismay, General Hamilton Howze, de-facto governor of the island since the Second World War, professes that US Forces Iceland is too small to contribute a sizable force to the war without compromising its extant mandate. However, he adds, Iceland has among the most robust healthcare systems in the world; its health professionals on average are on par with the best America can offer, and its facilities are more than equipped to handle abrupt surges of wounded and diseased patients. Surges, incidentally, that South Africa will doubtless encounter as the war drags on.\n\nFor a nation six times smaller than the entirety of the Cape Province's capital, its medical staff is a testament to the weight it can punch in spite of its size. Their assistance is welcome regardless, as South Africa's health service infrastructure is strained to its limits by the exigencies of war."

Say what one will about the Federation's many failings, but its sandy beaches and tropical fruits seem to attract geniuses with the wherewithal to immigrate and the will to learn the Queen's English. They have since built the islands' piecemeal infrastructure up to a developed nation's standards since one war's end.\n\nNow, as the clarion call echoes in Kingston, the very same genius now board ships bound for another war to replicate their miracles in the Great Escarpment and beyond.

"I know we're all up to our eyeballs organizing the sealift to South Africa, but what's got General Bigelow so worked up?"\n\n"Whatever supplies the South Africans didn't abandon, they're burning through in days," the colonel replied testily. "They're throwing all the munitions and men they have at the Nazis, and soon they'll be out of both. And besides..."\n\nThe colonel pointed at a campaign medal on the General's desk.\n\n"Twenty years ago, Major Bigelow was a logistics officer during the Defence of Britain.

 SAF.53.desc:0 "Since the days of colony, Canada has maintained a long tradition of military service in the name of God, King and Empire. The Old Dominion has always answered firm and true whenever London called for their aid. Its army's conduct in the First and Second World Wars, in particular, were nothing short of exemplary; around 1 in 12 of all Canadians had fought like heroes in the shell-pocked battlefields of France twice over.\n\nThough the Empire is now a sad memory, Canada has yet to err from maintaining an army belying its stature\n\nSuch is the case today as the Canadian Division disembarks from the Queen Mary in Cape Town Harbor. The spectacle that gathered throughout the coast was the most euphoric a war-burdened populace can muster: Ten thousands of little Union Jacks fluttered high alongside just as many little Orange, White and Blues while a band vivaciously trumpeted God Save the Queen near the waterfront. The mob sang along off-key of course, as did the squaddies surprised with the reception that greeted their first day in the veld.\n\nThen again, can one truly blame the Cape for so cheering for the Queen's men? They and theirs have long distinguished themselves from the innately rebellious Boers with an innate loyalty to the Crown.

 SAF.54.desc:0 "In exactly two Boer Wars and two World Wars, South Africa had fought at least one battle alongside its brothers in the Antipodes. Whether in East Africa or North Africa, shared experience in the battlefield has built up a camaraderie between the two far-flung Dominions that the fall of Empire cannot completely dissolve. Bolstering these feelings is an undercurrent of sympathy; after all, South Africa is as much of a bulwark as Australia and vice versa, but against the Nazis instead of the devils in Tokyo.\n\nSo is it any surprise that Canberra has sent ten thousand Australians to assist their brothers in their latest war? One would suggest that Washington had to goad it into doing so -- poppycock, naturally. More than anyone in the OFN, Australia recognizes the value of reciprocity; if it cannot show commitment to its duties, then who will show the same to Australia when the Rising Sun makes its move?\n\nNo, Australia and South Africa are brothers -- and brothers support each other in times of crises.

One free, democratic nation that has or had existed since the beginning of the 20th century. Say, France and England near the front and our own country, the United States, at the opposite end. The Second World War meant that a good half of the dominoes on this table had already fallen, just like this.\n\n"So many fledgeling democracies and their people, left to the tender mercies of the black fascist hand. All that remains are a couple handful of dominoes, the ones at the back end sheltered whether by distance, strength, fortitude, or a combination of all three. Right this moment, South Africa now forms the front tip of this shaky conga line... and with the war making like tremors and gusts battering the table, the South African domino has wobbled every which way since it began.\n\nI will not insult your intellect by stating the obvious repercussions of South Africa's demise. What I can do, however, is proffer a solution: An intervention to stop the tremors and gusts wherever and whenever they're found. One way or another, South Africa must not fall in our lifetimes.

The afternoon sun was making it hard to think.\n\nHis uncle had told him stories of the war in Britain. The soldiers there had been less surprised to hear French. Many Free French troops had fought in Britain. So had Polish pilots, Czechoslovak engineers, Russian exiles. American troops, their numbers almost as high as the desperate Brits, themselves fielding youth barely able to hold rifles and great war veterans with their grim desperation. All united against the fascist onslaught.\n\nOf course left unsaid by his uncle was that it had all been for nothing. Hundreds of French Canadians, buried under a cold and remote sun. The war had been unpopular then. This new war might be. Joseph had seen the protests back home in Québec city on his days of leave from Valcartier. A protester near the national assembly had coughed blood on him after getting in a fistfight. The fool didn't have to shout at him only for wearing a uniform, Joseph thought.\n\nIt felt good to be in the shade. The hangar was still extremely hot. The soldier leaned against the corrugated metal wall. Hopefully the war would be short. Hopefully only volunteers like him would make it to this foreign place.

The ship was days ago hijacked by a group of radical Iberian democrats who boarded disguised as passengers, and has since gone off the radar following a quick stop in Saint Kitts, in which crewmen injured in the hijacking were offloaded. Aboard the ship are six-hundred passengers, consisting of women, children, and civilian men. Many of those aboard the ship are Iberian, however the Pentagon confirms that several occupants are American citizens.\n\nIt is possible that all those aboard the ship could meet a violent end, should all go awry, which would include the death of several American citizens at the hands of foreign terrorists. The American public would find such news unacceptable. As such, the only advisable course of action would be to commence a naval search operation to find the Santa Maria, and to liberate those on board.

The intent of the mission is clear. Act fast, ensure civilians are not harmed, and take prisoner as many of the hijackers as possible. As soon as the first shot is fired, the hijackers will mobilize.\n\nThe squad leader gives a short series of hand signals, and they begin to move slowly across the dimly lit deck of the ship.\n\nNot long after, contact is made. The squad leader quickly releases two shots into the armed hijacker patrolling the deck, and the hijacker goes limp. Now that shots have been fired, the marines spring into action. Shots ring out from the other side of the deck, as other hijackers are likely killed. Smithley accompanies his squad in climbing an outer staircase of the ship, as they prepare for close quarters combat upon entering the bridge. The order is given to fix bayonets, and Smithley quickly affixes the ringed bayonet to the socket upon the barrel. Commotion can now be heard from within the ship, as several men begin shouting. Gunshots can be heard from other areas of the ship, as other marine squads quickly dispatch the oddly placed and unprepared hijackers.\n\nSmithley's squad quickly arrives at the entrance to the bridge, from where the ship is controlled. The squad leader begins counting down the entry. Finally, the count hits one, and he springs into action along with the rest of his squad. Quickly, they rush in to the bridge. Smithley, without thinking, dispatches one armed defender before a shot is fired. The other armed men within the bridge drop their rifles, and swiftly surrender to preserve their own life."

The ambassador claimed that, should the United States accept the offer of Iberian support in the conflict, Iberia is prepared to contribute significant and direct military combat support.\n\nAlthough wholly unexpected, this news has been welcomed by many in Washington. Previously, many Americans felt alienated within the conflict. It has been widely viewed as if we were standing alone.

In a recent communication, the Iberians have pledged a significant expansion to their existing support within the war. The communication to Washington D.C. outlines many intricacies and details of current Iberian intentions within the conflict, however one pledge within the document stands out from the others.\n\nThe Iberian island of São Tomé, which rests just north of the Equator, not far off the coasts of Central and West Africa, carries great potential as a logistics hub for the duration of this conflict. Following the establishment of Iberian operations in South Africa, they now believe the situation to be appropriate to lease access to the island to us, granting us an invaluable logistical asset. Senior military officials believe that the ports of São Tomé may be effectively used as a logistics waypoint, and further as a possible airbase for our bomber aircraft fleet.\n\nWhilst plans for the usage of the island remain in the preliminary stages, we have gratefully accepted the Iberian lease proposal, and it is estimated that logistical operations upon the island will commence in a matter of mere weeks."

The content of the documents provided details, at great length, upon the industrial and infrastructural specifications in various vital regions within Mozambique and Angola, now controlled by the Reichskommissariats of the Afrika-Schild.

Due to Iberian intelligence upon local industry, American bombs fell with deadly accuracy upon essential edifices within the local industry, causing irreparable damages and bringing a significant share of arms production in the region to a complete halt.\n\nDue to the quick and devastating nature of the new American bombing campaign, it is hoped by many senior officials that the productive capabilities of the Reichskommissariats will be significantly hindered for the duration of the conflict.

But more powerful than the propaganda were the songs, the most popular being Canto do Desertor, an anti-war ballad written by the Angolan-born poet Luis Cilia calling for desertion as the moral thing, reinforced feelings of nostalgia for home and family and the futility of dying in a war for those who are oppressing your people. The popularity of a Cilia's songs proved so much amongst the Südwestafrikaner SS that their German officers ordered the confiscation of personal radios and started punishing soldiers who tuned in on RFA's frequency, but no matter how harsh the repression is, in every sector of the Namibian front you can hear the troops humming while their officers are away 'Me deram uma Cruz de Ferro quando matei meu irmão, e a cabo promoveu-me o Alemão, todos me chamam de herói ninguem me chama de amor, quem quieres uma Cruz de Ferro que eu não vou pro quartel'"

Their comrades on the frontline are in turn often running on amphetamines to maintain vigilance on endless patrols. In this they are joined by desperate locals consuming cheap amphetamines to curb hunger as they flee devastated fields and plantations.\n\nFor once the Germans and Americans are in agreement about something. But neither side is able to stem the tide of drugs flooding into the dark continent. Criminal syndicates from Asia transport entire productions of heroin to backwater ports that the Schild and OFN cannot monitor. Even without criminal activity, the vast amount of medicine brought in by both factions still presents a colossal risk potential. Overworked doctors prescribe drugs for any ailments, and officers often close their eyes on this problem to keep their soldiers sedated and functional. Soldiers from both sides torch as many fields of marijuana as they can, but their generals have little time for police work as they struggle to win their war. And through all this, private corporations funnel vast amounts of older pharmaceutical products to the continent where they serve as precursor for harder drugs.\n\nThe domestic reaction in America has been horror. Many refuse to see their children conscripted, lest they return home as dysfunctional addicts. Critics of the government's war effort see in this drug epidemic a microcosm of the entire South African mess; an impossibly large continent is impossible to fully control and monitor. Private interests benefitting from the chaos have little interest in solving the crisis, and the American government is too busy to try and help to make things better.

In it, he has justified the ANC's decision to go beyond constitutional methods and non-violent resistance, citing the increased restrictions placed on non-whites. Instead, they have embarked on a campaign of sabotage against property, while developing a military arm for possible future use.\n\n"But this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution which will guarantee racial harmony and freedom for all," he continues. "It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one colour group by another. The ANC has spent half a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs, as it certainly must, it will not change that policy."\n\n"This then is what the ANC is fighting for. Our struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African people, inspired by our own suffering and our own experience. It is a struggle for the right to live."\n\nHe turns to look the judge in the eyes, the last time he will do so in this trial.\n\n"During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all people live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to see realised."\n\n"But if need be," he concludes, "it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""

 SAF.104.desc:0 "The white-haired Afrikaner rose from his place as quickly as he could, adjusting his glasses with one hand while the other gripped a sheet of paper, knuckles white from the pressure. All around him waited the rest of the Parliament; his colleagues in the National Party on his side, and the members of the United Party, their ranks dirtied by the presence of the English, reminding him bitterly of their treatment of his family who they forced into concentration camps. His eyes regarded them with terrible contempt, especially as he noticed Seretse Khama, the only black man present, observing the proceedings. While he obviously shared the same feelings his contemporaries had for the English, nobody would doubt that Albert would be more disgusted with the African.\n\nNevertheless, despite the presence of these people, he would have to make his move now. Albert steadied himself as the Parliament was called to order, the representatives of each party settling down in their seats. He waited until the speaker to proclaim to them that the floor was free for him to take. Then he began to speak to them, his voice loud and clear.\n\n"This land does not need to continue its existence under the watch of a monarch! In fact, for the many times I have proclaimed this, especially with my party, it is not necessary to seek the guidance of one. We can rule over this land as a Republic with a President at its head. But what is the point of striving for this if this is not put forward to the people? For everyone to have their say, especially those who truly deserve to settle the land which they have called theirs since they've come?"\n\nMen from the United Party rose in anger, booing at him, raising their voices, but the speaker interrupted them. And the Boer kept speaking, more clearly now, overcoming the volume of his opponents, just as many in his own party rose to defend him and to counter their disapproving remarks.\n\n"I make it clear before you now! Realize that there is no way for this Parliament to keep on moving forward if it cannot listen to the calls of the people. I demand that a referendum be considered for the sake of our people! And if this is not put to consideration, every proposal set forth by this parliament shall be halted. This land is our land; this is the Volkstaat, and we are not slaves of any king or queen!"\n\nThe parliament burst with noise and the Boer returned to his seat, proud, as his party members shouted down the opposition, silencing them."

The Boers had done it. And their enemies would have to shake their heads, sigh, and retreat into their homes. After all, as victory is celebrated, the streets of Suid-Afrika, the home of the supposedly noble Boers, witness vile acts in the dark.\n\nA scream of a prostitute here and there rings and fades.

This would certainly win the more moderate and considerate members of that Congress, and as a consequence, it shall invite their kin to see us in a more favorable light and use their numerical majority to our advantage at the referendum, this would make us seem reasonable and approachable. However, this will inevitably provoke the Boers, especially those who follow Hertzog and cling to the promises of his party. It won't be good.\n\nOtherwise, we can establish a confrontation in opposition to the Congress and appeal to more conservative voters. This means concrete police, and possibly military, action against them. Arrests and raids would be made. And this would allow us to try removing from our land one threat from within and removing much of the National Party's appeal to law and order. The results however may not be so good. We must anticipate the possibility of these people rising against us, turning to violence, and pulling our nation down into anarchy.\n\nThe only thing we can do about it is to be careful, yet we must be quick about what choice we make. There is no time for us to waste, for not only are we facing down the shadows that haunt our Republic within, but we are also about to meet the challenge the Nazis to the north of our borders have.

Since then, the island has been home to a whaling station, a leper colony, a place to quarantine animals, and defensive fortifications in the Second World War. But it has always been regarded as a place to store troublesome chiefs, native leaders, and other political prisoners by its owners.\n\nRecently, it has become the new, permanent home to a number of radical prisoners. Daniels, Mandela, Mbeki, Mhlaba, Sisulu, Sobukwe, and others who are too much of a threat to society to be allowed to exist on the mainland wll be placed in the maximum security prison. Here, their visitors can be cut off, their mail stopped and regulated, their cell block isolated, their contact with the outside world shut. Their existence is reduced to their five square meter cell, their table, and the straw mat to sleep on. If they behave, they might be able to work in the quarry on the island, digging up lime."

Rather, they are formed by the will of like-minded men, buttressed by the hands of like-minded men, and financed by the money of like-minded men. Like a clockwork machine all three function synchronously to achieve some goal or another: Its leaders convene in smoke-filled rooms to discuss their ends and means; its grunts execute said means to their fullest extent; and its businessmen funnel part of their profit to propel themselves, their leaders, and their compatriot grunts further towards said ends.\n\nThe African National Congress is no different, but oftentimes perceptions fail to reflect the truth. One can easily see throngs of exuberant blacks waving banners of protest in television and on print, and the faces of the revolution they proclaim: Mandela, Tambo, Sobukwe. However, their pecuniary backbone escapes media attention save for reports on economic growth and the odd broken storefront. Ignored by many, these financiers are left free to support the petty insurrectionists wedging South Africa apart with millions of pounds -- blood money to the last shilling.\n\nTo deal with this clandestine threat, Commissioner du Plooy has suggested two approaches: sanctioning black and coloured businessmen suspected of providing funding to the ANC, or blacklisting businesses vocal in their support for the National Party. Going straight after the Congress's wealthy benefactors may hurt it the most, but undertaking the latter will allow us some degree of plausible deniability and, perhaps, uproot paper trails leading straight to the Reich."

It was a long day, but at the end of it, the South African Police had several suspects in their custody who would no longer be agitating the public openly.\n\nHis partner, Hanekom, had told him some better news. It seemed the national raids were a success. Hundreds of ANC agitators were now behind bars from Bechuanaland to the Cape. That would put a big dent in their operations, he figured. True, some hadn't gotten captured but at least they wouldn't be poking their heads up anytime soon.\n\nSo what comes next, he wondered? The ANC was smashed by now. Maybe they'd do something rash in retaliation, maybe they wouldn't. Maybe they'd just never be heard from again. But that wasn't likely, he assumed.

Of the thousands under the agency's payroll, he settled on JJ de Swardt's dossier. The captain was a rising star in the Bliksems, having earned his stripes fighting small flareups in Bechuanaland.

South Africa has no shortage of dilapidated homesteads half-buried under the sand, only that a sharp eye catch their silhouettes among the bush. One eye spotted a complex 12 miles west of Pretoria. Fairly sizable, replete with provisions, and just far enough from civilization to stifle a scream with the open desert. De Plooy approved a second expedition into what the preliminary report called Vlakplaas Farm.\n\nLastly, he picked a name for its new inhabitants.

 SAF.122.desc:0 "The rural village of Mahlabathini was obviously a place where nothing of much importance seemed to happen. Toward the southern end of the Province of Natal and with over a thousand inhabitants, it was indistinguishable from the many other African villages in the area. Then, one day, a small group of South African Police showed up at the primary school and stood guard around the complex, accompanied by the mining magnate Harry Oppenheimer.\n\nSome ANC members talked with Oppenheimer for a bit, and the sound of helicopters filled the air. Two transport helicopters, marked in the colours of the South African Air Force, landed on the football green. Out came several plainclothes officers, a few staffers, and Prime Minister De Villiers Graaff. The ANC members were satisfied, and left with a police officer.\n\nThe leader of the ANC, Oliver Tambo, would later have to admit he did feel like this was a set-up. And it did seem ridiculous that this would really be taking place. But the assurances by the other members of the ANC that this was really happening convinced him. He left the safehouse on the edge of the village and went to the school, where he was allowed in after a brief search for weaponry by the guarding police officer.\n\nThe meeting between Tambo and Graaff took place in a schoolroom, with the desks formed to make a makeshift table. Several staffers for both sides were allowed in, as well, the Prime Minister's photographer to record the meeting, and Oppenheimer as a mediator. Negotiations were a bit awkward, at first, as neither side really trusted the other and expected a sudden ambush. Eventually, it became clear that both really did want to talk, and things got a bit more relaxed and calmer. And things got easier when Tambo and Graaff decided they really did want some of the same things.\n\nBy the time the meeting was over, substantial progress had been made. Graaff knew that the ANC would be willing to reduce violent and disruptive activity in exchange for concessions. Tambo knew that the government was now willing to meet with them on things, which was a lot better than when they were totally ignored. In the end, the ANC and the United Party could lead with something in common:"

The rumor of a meeting between Tambo and Prime Minister Graaff came up once again, but we didn't know if it had really happened, or if it was another deception. Govan said 'this is where they put us in our own cell block."\n\n"Finally, the warden came out and spoke to us. He cleared his throat, and announced, 'the government of South Africa and the African National Congress have come to an agreement where the ANC will renounce violence as a political tool. As part of this deal, the ANC will no longer be judged to be in violation of the Suppression of Communism Act, and their members will no longer be prosecuted for their crimes. At 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, you will all be loaded onto a ferry for Cape Town, where you will be released. Thank you.'"\n\n"It was shocking, and we were unsure if it had truly happened. We spoke to the warden after the speech, who assured us that it was all true. Then we started asking questions. Everyone else could leave if their groups signed the deal, said the warden, but we were going to be leaving tomorrow. I asked him if I could have my release delayed to inform my family to meet me when I got out, and if I could be transported near them and released there. The warden told me that transportation was our own prerogative. 'As for the delay,' he said, 'Graaff signed the deal, there's nothing to negotiate. You're leaving Robben Island if you like it or not.' And that was that."\n\nNelson Mandela."

Robert Sobukwe had to rely on mirrors and coded hand signals to maintain contact with his followers in the Pan African Congress. Through which, he told them to keep to their belief in hardline socialist principles, and a South Africa without non-Africans.\n\nRecently, however, the guards had approached him with an offer, saying the PAC would be unbanned and released if he renounced violence as a political tool. To help persuade him, they allowed him to discuss it with the other PAC prisoners, who told Sobukwe that the ANC had signed the deal and had left the island. Many wanted to take the deal and leave the prison. But Sobukwe stood firm. There would be no cooperation with the government, he decided. As he observed his comrades in the PAC marching past him with the rest of the prisoners, he reflected on his decision and knew they would have to stay steadfast if they were to finally achieve victory.\n\nThen came the shock of his life.\n\nA prisoner in the middle of the group raised his hand. Several PAC prisoners were suddenly grabbed by prisoners behind them, covering their mouths so they could not be heard. Then out came the shivs, pieces of glass with cloth wrapped around the handle. Jaw agape, he watched his comrades go down in a fury of stabs and kicks. He started to yell, but none of that made a difference to the sudden orgy of violence that was transpiring outside of his residence. And he realized, to his horror, that the assailants were PAC members as well, the moderate ones who wanted to leave, and the victims were the ones who stood by him.\n\nWho did this, Sobukwe wondered? Did the ANC infiltrate the PAC? Was somebody making a play for party leader? Why aren't the guards watching this? Did the government want this to happen?\n\nSo fixated was Sobukwe on the inter-party coup on his hand mirror, he failed to notice the three prisoners that had climbed over his fence behind him."

The striker inside moves instead."\n\nTo confirm this, Balfour looked down at the gap. But that raised more questions. "What's this ball inside for? And where are the keys?"\n\n"That's the typeball," Walker said. "The typewriter rotates it around to get to the letter you want, and then strikes it on the paper. It uses, um, something called digital to analog conversion and, well, something-something coding, I forgot what they call it. It's complicated, but it's really fast, let's just leave it at that. Here, I'll show you." Walker put in a piece of paper and typed his name with the machine. Indeed, it was fast.\n\n"You can replace the ball if you want to do italics or something like that. There's a set of balls in your drawer, along with a manual if you want to know more. And don't worry about maintenance, if they break, we usually get somebody from IBM to repair them anyway. Sounds good?"\n\nBalfour nodded and got right to work on the typewriter. He learned fast, Walker had to admit.

We will name them after the King's African Rifles, so they'll be the Royal African Rifles, or the South African Rifles if the referendum goes through. Fitting, don't you think?"\n\nEdward Lansdale looked over the proposal. "Not really," he said.

Isn't that why you're here?"\n\n"I'm here to keep your country afloat," said Lansdale, "and that's going to be hard to do if you insist on fighting the last war. The next conflict that you fight is going to be against the Boers in Transvaal, and you can't make the same mistake the British did by assuming you can fight a conventional war against them. You march those divisions four abreast in there, and they won't come back out."\n\n"Do you have an alternate strategy?" asked Marshall Fraser.\n\n"Turn 'em into a South African National Guard. Forget sending them into battle like it's Jelib again, you make these guys do some less glamorous work," Lansdale explained. "They don't need heavy artillery, they need to be able to direct traffic, clear homes, get into remote areas, and send people to strategic hamlets. They're a counter-insurgency force, they bring the fight to the enemy on their turf. That's what you should have these men doing."\n\nGeneral Viljioen was unconvinced.

"It's been a while, and we want to know if you made a decision on our proposal, yet."\n\nButhelezi took a deep breath and said, "You know, I'm thinking I'll do it. I've always wanted a career in politics and I'm glad the United Party thinks the same way. I'll run as a candidate in the upcoming elections. And I'm honored that you would make me the first native United Party candidate."\n\n"You're welcome, Mr. Buthelezi. We're glad to hear that you'll stand for us. Your goals and ours align, and you'll be welcome in our ranks. Although, technically, you aren't the first African candidate. King Seretse Khama is going to run up in Bechuanaland, we just learned that this morning."\n\nButhelezi laughed. "It figures that he'd do that. He definitely hates the Germans enough to join you. But that's alright, I'm happy with being second. And hopefully he gets elected so I don't feel alone in Cape Town."\n\n"I hope so too. I'll tell Cape Town the good news. Good luck, Mr. Buthelezi.

 SAF.128.desc:0 "Nesiwe Mbeki has experienced a lot of things in her 75 years living in her village in the Eastern Cape. When she was born, South Africa was a colony, the First Boer War had just ended, and life in the village was going on as it always had. She witnessed the Second Boer War, the formation of the Union of South Africa, the First and the Second World Wars, and all the events in between. In the meantime, her village changed with the addition of new wood homes, a new schoolhouse with a generator, and more and more pressure on the residents, specifically the younger ones, to forget their past and traditions, and change their ways.\n\nNesiwe has been living with her son's family ever since her husband passed away. Not content to sit around the living room and stare at the wall, she took to telling stories to the children of the household who were too young for school or to work. The children told their friends, and soon the village children would go to the house to listen to her stories. Stories of old Xhosa heroes and legends, ones that she was told as a child, and ones he was dismayed to find the young ones had a lack of familiarity with.\n\nThen one day, one of the white teachers in the village sought her out. He told her that the government had decided to start teaching Xhosa, Zulu, and various other native languages, instead of just English and Afrikaans. This was due to the recent reforms to placate native groups. The only problem was there was a lack of white teachers who could speak Xhosa, necessitating the recruiting of elderly natives who could handle teaching duties. She fit the qualifications, and she could speak and write in English, thanks to a missionary who once visited the village when she was a child. Would she consider becoming a language teacher in the village school?\n\nNow, Nesiwe is a Xhosa language teacher. She teaches children how to read and write in the language of their ancestors. She helps her son's family with an extra source of income. And, most importantly, she still tells the children of the village the stories that have been passed down for generations of Xhosa. Nesiwe is happy with the recent turn of events, and many other elderly natives in South Africa feel the same."

 SAF.129.t:0 "B. J. Vorster Found Dead!"
 SAF.129.desc:0 "At 11 AM, a chicken farmer pulled into a service station in Cullinan, outside of Pretoria. He reported in a call to the police that a stopped car with its engine running had been blocking his lane on a remote highway nearby. When he went to investigate, he found the driver, a white man, slumped onto the wheel, dead, with what he believed to be gunshot wounds. The driver immediately left the scene to contact the authorities.\n\nWhen the farmer led the police to the scene, they found it exactly as he described it. By the looks of it, the victim was shot in the head at close range once with a .380 inch bullet. The driver-side window had been opened, and the car was in between the lane lines, indicating the vehicle had been stopped before the murder, and the assassin had come from the side. The victim was missing their wallet, and their identification. But one officer recognized the deceased, and the victim's surprising identity was soon confirmed.\n\nBalthazar Johannes "B. J." Vorster was born to a sheep farmer in Jamestown, South Africa in 1915. Becoming involved in politics during his years studying law, he had been a member of the pro-Nazi organization Ossewabrandwag during the war, an affiliation which earned him a detention at Koffiefontein. Claiming to have a newfound belief in the parliamentary system, he was elected as a National Party candidate for the National Assembly, before becoming a senator. Known for being able to be approachable, eccentric, and occasionally reasonable, he was nonetheless comitted to Boer nationalism and the implementation of racial segregation.\n\nNobody knew who ended his life on that road. The assailants had vanished long before the farmer had arrived. Combing the area failed to find much in terms of usable evidence. No cartridges were found on the ground, nor were there any fingerprints on the car or the body. A tire track was discovered on the side of the road, but that may have been unrelated. And no claims of responsibility from one of the rebel groups of South Africa.\n\nRegardless of his beliefs, B. J. Vorster was a South African Senator. A South African Senator who was murdered. And the culprit may well get away with it."

This is enough, the commando system must be taken apart before more of it starts leaking equipment to the paramilitary groups."\n\n"It's a disgrace, but we need to take a larger view of the situation, before we do anything rash," said Field Marshall Charles Fraser. "The Commando System is far larger than just a few units. It's a militia system that operates all over the country. There's local units everywhere, many who are filled with perfectly loyal individuals. Shutting down this system of militias will only cause harm to our national security in the long run."\n\n"It's causing damage in the short run," Minister of Security Colin Eglin said. "They're already giving out weaponry to rebel groups, and they're probably going to join them soon. It's clear that the army's oversight isn't working. The commando system may be essential, but it has to go, before it becomes counterproductive against our own security."\n\n"Removing it entirely will be counterproductive, with all due respect," said Field Marshal Hendrik Klooper. "It is a massive organization which we need to be able to deploy in an instant. It's our reserves. It's our main organization that we need if the Germans come across the lines.

 SAF.131.desc:0 "The first step was to find out who would be assigned to the case. The Supreme Court of South Africa had various local levels, but this one would be heard at the Appellate Division in Bloemfontein. A large number of judges served in the division, but cases were heard by a panel of five judges. Once the judges who would hear the case were identified, the courting could begin.\n\nIt was obvious that one of the judges would rule the way they wanted. They had a case history and opinions that pointed to a view that suited the United Party. Thus, they were ignored completely, since they were confident they could rule the way they wanted. There were bigger concerns.\n\nThe second judge was a little vaguer on the side they supported. They had some opinions that looked good for the outcome, but had some that didn't. A private conversation, however, gave plenty of confidence that they would rule favorably for the side they wanted. So now they had two.\n\nThe third was the toughest. They had doubts about the merits of the case, and wanted to rule against it. This couldn't happen under any circumstances. It took a long time, with plenty of conversations, but they were finally convinced of its merit. A new courthouse in their hometown being named after them would be officially unrelated.\n\nThe fourth was a judge that was favorable to the side the government wanted. They weren't on the case originally, but some strings were pulled, and they got on. Mostly to make sure they were covered if any of the other three went back on their word.\n\nSo when the Appellate division met in Bloemfontein to decide on voting rights for natives, the United Party could relax a large amount. Sure, officially the decision would be made after the arguments, just like all the other cases heard by them. But that wasn't how things really worked. And the government could already celebrate a great legal victory when the court convened."

Many were content to chant with their families and march under the Vierkleur and perhaps enjoy a barbecue. Only a few of the initial demonstrators carried weapons, and the police hoped that all of the large crowd of protestors would stay this way.\n\nThat changed when the mob began to rock cars back and forth.\n\nWhile the disturbance attracted the attention of the police officers, an armored van smashed through the outer gate and the garage gate. It was followed by a large group of Afrikaner paramilitaries. The sudden attack overwhelmed the small number of guards inside the building. Proceedings were immediately canceled, as the occupants inside tried to clear out, but it was too late.\n\nThe courtroom staff hid in various rooms as the Boer Kommandos painted slogans on the walls, urinated over furniture, and harassed the court members they found. Police rushed to the scene, but the amount of demonstrators prevented them from making a timely entrance. When they had finally arrived, the Kommandos were firmly in control of the building.

The hostage-takers lacked heavy weaponry, and were extremely disorganized. And they had been so kind as to put a major breach in the fence. So while the negotiators tried to bore them to death, the police made a plan...\n\nThe first step was the moving of a fire truck and a group of police officers near the front of the building. This made the Boers move towards the front to prepare for the expected attack. Meanwhile, groups of armed police gathered in the building behind the court. Under the watchful eye of sharpshooters, a group of welders cut away a section of the fence to get another point of entry.\n\nAs soon as the go-ahead was given, grenade launchers filled the building with tear gas as the police went in. A large number went through the hole in the fence, while a larger number went through the breach in the fence created by the van. Snipers went to work, shooting at the paramilitaries when they popped up in the windows.\n\nA few minutes after the breach, the hostages were being led out and forced to lie on the grass as they were checked for weapons. They were scared, but unharmed, even the judges. Several of the Boers were down, the rest were captured. A few injuries to the police force, but no fatalities. All in all, a successful operation."

Overwhelm them with police officers and extreme force. Get the hostages out, and arrest whoever was left. That was the plan. In actuality, it was a disaster. The Boers were too heavily armed, far more than had been expected, far better than the attacking police. It was a pitched battle, and when it was over, the police retreated under a white flag, carrying their casualties, while the Vierkleur stood tall, taunting them.\n\nThe police lost their leverage. The army, under General Magnus Malan, was now in charge. After negotiation, it appeared both sides weren't interested in continuing the fighting. The Boers could leave if they left the judges alone. And the paramilitaries accepted. The Afrikaners released the hostages, and marched out of the city with their firearms, in formation, and with their heads held high parading with their Vierkleur right on the noses of South Africa's soldiers and policemen.\n\nIt was the most shameful moment in the history of the South African Police."

Full three-course meals, air conditioning, vacation leave -- these fruits of prosperity, once banal, have become luxuries as soon as half of South Africa rebelled and the Reich rumbled to war. What plenty remains have been reserved for guns, tanks and ammunition for ten million fastened belts. For a nation under siege, butter is indulgent excess at best, and treason at worst.\n\nOf course, that does not mean special occasions no longer warrant a bit of celebration under the current stresses. Far from it. What it does imply, however, is that Her Majesty the Queen's loyal soldiers needed only the humble tea kettle -- and some special ingredients -- to commemorate the day of her birth.\n\nFavors were exchanged among the quartermasters beforehand such that their well-oiled trucks delivered crates of Twinings and creamy milk, rather than rifle rounds and oil, to Commonwealth formations across the front. More specific requests varied among the realms: the Canadians, for instance, ordered an extra bag of English breakfast for every beaver in uniform. West Indiemen detachments asked for generators to power their fancy iceboxes for brewing cold tea. The ANZACs demanded gallons of the freshest Norco Cape Town receives from the Antipodes. South Africa asked for medical supplies and spare parts, the killjoys; then again, they accepted the honeybush bags as eagerly as they do bottles of Betadine.\n\nYet in spite of their myriad differences and quarrels -- regiments heckled each other and themselves over whether to add milk before the tea or the converse -- every last Commonwealth tar listened to Earl Cameron announcing the Queen's thirty-sixth birthday on CBC Radio. And when Her Majesty's speech ended with the first crescendo of an old, storied tune crackling from their ham radios, an embattled brotherhood of nations raised their cups to the air in unison as they shouted:"

Then they had seen the column of black, billowing from a patch of green near the abandoned Weipe border post. The chopper touched down, and the squad stepped out, staring at the gruesome sight.\n\nThere was a humble low-slung main house, made of stone and wood, accompanied by a couple of tiny shacks and a pen of goats. Flames poured from the house, the shacks had clearly been picked over, and what goats hadn't been taken lay bayoneted in the grass.\n\nAlong with the family.\n\nTheir remains lay in front of the house, the youngest son still clutching an Afrikaans Bible in his ruined arms. Settlers, probably hard up types from Krugersdorp or Bloemfontein, just trying to make a new life on the Lowveld.

The belated ceremony was held in Cape Town, with many notable government officials in attendance. Many more people had lined the streets to watch the procession, and a larger number watched these events live on television.\n\nSouth Africa had never held a coronation of its own, with their ceremony being combined with the rest of the commonwealths when the monarch took the throne in Westminster Abbey. Thus, they decided to re-create the ceremony in Cape Town. Once her oaths had been taken, the Archbishop presented her with the holy bible, and prepared for the most sacred part of the ritual.\n\nThe Queen, who up until that point had still been referred to as "Princess Elizabeth," since she was still technically a princess, went to sit in the Governor-General's chair for her anointing. She was presented with the Armills, Stole Royal, Robe Royal and the Sovereign's Orb, followed by the Queen's Ring, the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross and the Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove. All of these had been given to her before, for they were the same ones used in her coronation in Canada. But this time, it was official for the South Africans.\n\nFinally, St Edward's Crown was picked up by the Archbishop, who held it aloft over her head.

On the front page was the word "REPUBLIEK" and a photo of the prime minister's face.\n\nAfter so much pain, after repelling the Nazis and the Boer traitors and securing its own independence, South Africa was finally ready to act on the results of its republic referendum. Effective at midnight, per the government's order, South Africa would break from the British Crown. Beneath the fold were a mix of other stories-of Black Africans protesting their underrepresentation in the government and lingering effects of the National Party's policies, of the first football game since the end of the war, of a church service to remember all those who had died.\n\nMartha dabbed at her eyes and gently folded the paper into her purse. She knew that the referendum meant that she had lost her job, but what she felt now was not sadness or regret. It was hope. There were countless problems that South Africa would need to face in the coming years-the costs of the war, discrimination and prejudice, governmental dysfunction. There would be hardship and struggle. There would undoubtedly be disappointments and moments of pain, but her country-her republic-could be in charge of its own fate. People like her could do hard work to correct the mistakes of the past and make South Africa a better place for everyone.\n\nMartha went through the rest of the day without issue or incident.

His fellow platoon members nodded their heads, whether for confirmation or slight fear. "Everyone prepare your counterfeit passes and recite your identification lines again. You'll get extra points if you can do it in German." remarked Reid-Daly, receiving chuckles from his team. "One last thing 'for we do this. If we all make it out alive, let's have drinks shall we?

The plains were now past and they've just entered Reichskommissariat territory - specifically Ostafrika, the more sinister and malicious of the three.\n\nThey soon arrived at the checkpoint a few hundred meters from the military camp and had to identify themselves to the Germans guarding the gate. "SS-Oberscharführer Jack N. B. Stolk, reporting for duty Sir!" stated Reid-Daly, saluting the guard with gusto. The guard merely grunted and stated "Next," unfazed by his charisma. "Alright, I guess not everyone's a big fan of me." joked Reid-Daly. Next, the Germans examined the truck's contents, and opened the crates containing the faulty ordinance. This part was crucial, for if their trick was discovered, their mission and lives were very much over. As the guards reached out to grab the rifles, Reid-Daly muttered "Herr SS-Sturmbannführer said don't touch them.", waving off the Germans.

From there, he peeked from within, in anticipation for the climax of his operation.\n\nHe saw the Germans begin to unbox their shiny munitions, intending for use in a firing exercise. He saw the soldiers reload their rifles and insert shells in their artillery and mortars. Reid-Daly quickly told the driver to hit the gas, preparing their escape a few seconds before the explosive display.\n\nThe facility was suddenly rocked with a loud and powerful explosion, causing distress and panic among the Germans. The commanding officers now lay astonished. On the open field of the facility, lay scattered debris and shrapnel. Several soldiers lay on the floor, dead from the blast or barely managing to stay alive, embedded with fragments of their newly-acquired weapons. An emergency sweep of the area revealed that those "Anglos" had disappeared moments before the blast. A quick radio to the checkpoint revealed they had already been let through, now untraceable and uncatchable.

Now however, in front of them was a small police cordon, and on the other side, what looked like a small riot. Miners, dozens of them, waving their picks menacingly - Jacopetti asked a policeman what had happened, and as Prosperi was already filming, the cop explained, in a thick Afrikaans accent, that a small mining incident became the pretext for a wildcat strike.\n\nAs the miners, all black, shouted slogans like "Africa for Africans", the black-gold-green flag of the African National Congress appeared as if out of thin air. It didn't take long for police reinforcements to arrive and disperse the crowds with a generous application of batons - all caught on film by Jacopetti and Prosperi. After the riot, when the Italians' jeep started to once again make its way down the now empty road, Jacopetti managed to capture one last shot - rows and rows of small, dingy homes where black miners lived.

After managing to capture the village from Hüttig's troops, the Black rebels had bunkered down, repelling any enemy scout that came too close - but none of them had been brave, or foolish, like these two, who fell right into the hands of a rebel patrol. Screaming and pleading for mercy, they were dragged into the main square, to be lined up against the wall - and, much to the amusement of the militia, never stopped taking film even in their final moments.\n\nThe leader of the militia, a massive black man wearing a pair of German military sunglasses alongside a similarly improvised uniform, wanted to execute the two Germans scouts in person. "Please, for God's sake! We're not Germans!" One shouted, as the other kept filming despite numerous hands trying to grab his camera and his clothes. "We're shooting a movie! A movie!" Quickly, he produced documents from his pockets. "REGNO D'ITALIA", said the letters on the exterior. The rebel leader squinted, struggling to read the document. "Ja-co... petti?"\n\nA few minutes later, the rebel leader, whose nom de guerre was Simba, was treating the two Italians no longer as intruders, but as welcomed guests. With a smile on his face, he showed the two around the village, especially the places where fighting had happened - and where the grim remnants of the fallen German garrison and their collaborators laid to rot. "Our people will be free!" Simba proclaimed before the camera, with a wide smile, gesturing towards the impaled skull of a German soldier, still wearing his Stahlhelm, now serving as a decoration for the village's main entrance. "All of Africa will be free one day!" That evening, Jacopetti talked with a few of Simba's men - all farmers, simple people, driven to rebellion by desperation - as they sped towards the Südwestafrikan border on a looted German jeep.

"Zum Bomber" said the sign outside, with a picture of a cartoonish pilot drinking an oversized pint of beer while driving its plane in mad circles across the sky. Much like the building, its colours were fading in the dusty wind. Two men, armed with cameras and a microphone, made their way inside.\n\n"Ein Film, ja?" The airman laughed with his comrades, all of them looking into the camera. Most of them still wearing pilots' clothes, the Luftwaffe crew members each had their beers and cigarettes, coarsely laughing and smoking in the dimly lit interior.

And yet, the two filmmakers were still there - many pilots had gone to sleep, but a few, visibly drunk, were still in the tavern. "Franco und Gualtiero, huh? From Italy. I've been there, once. On vacation, when I was ein Kind." The pilot smiled, a half smoked cigarette hanging from his lips. "I wish I could go on a vacation. Sometimes, it's just... how do you say it in English?" A pause followed. The pilot's eyes wandered off in the far distance. A distant rumble was heard, a bomber returning to the runways. "Tiring. It feels tiring." The pilot got up, struggling to stay on his feet. "I did a mission on a rebel-held village, yesterday. I've been to the place, there used to be children there. They will never go on a vacation."

However, not even this corner of Congo was safe for the rebels - and before they could start to execute the hostages, a company of mercenaries descended upon them like starving vulture.\n\nThe battle raged on for a few more hours, grenades punctuating the sparse symphony of gunfire. Soon enough, shirtless gangs of white mercenaries had driven out the shirtless gangs of black rebels, and after freeing the hostages, proceeded to resume their predecessors' job in systemically robbing them of anything even remotely valuable. As the two filmmakers kept shooting scene after scene of glorious looting and smiling mercenaries posing with their eyepatches, colourful parrots, and macabre war trophies, one soldier of fortune called them out. "Merda, siete Italiani!"\n\n"Gualtiero Jacopetti, piacere. And he's my colleague, Franco." The newly found compatriots shook hands, before the overjoyed mercenary spoke again. "I'm Paolo. Are you shooting a movie? About us? It's about goddamn time!" Hours later, the mercenary was still telling his story, and that of his compatriots, sitting on a tree stump. "Many are French, old legionnaires - other Belgians. There's even a few bloody English." Paolo smiled. "I was born in Kenia, my parents were among the first Italian settlers there. Then the Mau Mau came to visit us...and that's how I ended up here." Paolo got up, lighting a cigarette. "Dio, I really want to see that movie when it comes out. Anyway, you should come with us. I can set up a flight back to Italy for you." The mercenary column was preparing to leave the half destroyed mission. As the trucks moved along the muddy forest road, it started to rain, and the two Italians had to put away their cameras after filming one last shot - the whitened skeletons of African rebels, all slowly sinking into the mud, corpses swallowed by the African jungle."

 SAF.154.desc:0 "Volunteers and supplies from the world over have been filling our ports to aid us in our holy struggle to hold off the Nazi hordes. Most of these nations we have expected such as the OFN, who, of course, has been waiting for this for years. Others we were less prepared for, such as aid from the officially neutral West India (hedging its bets as always) smugglers from parts of the German sphere.\n\nBut the least expected of all of them has recently shown up unannounced at the headquarters of 1 SAI on the front. After nearly getting into a firefight with the 1st's sentries, 100 Russians (along with, ironically enough, guides and escorts from Zentralafrika hired via Breton connections) claiming to hail from various warlord states of the former Soviet Union approached the base commander and immediately offered their services.\n\nThe volunteers claim to belong to the 'All-Russian Volunteer Anti-Nazi League', a ragtag militia claiming allegiance to over a dozen different Russian states from the famous West Russian Revolutionary Front all the way to a devotee to a man claiming to be 'King Rurik' in the far east. While most of them do not speak English, their leader, claiming to belong to some sort of paramilitary organization called 'the Guard' has informed the commander in heavily broken English that the 100 fighters constitute a mix of volunteers sent by various governments and men wishing to fight the Germans for personal reasons, and 'will fight harder than any other man, having been trained for nearly three weeks in a 'Guard' regime'."

A Südwestafrikan patrol boat monitoring the waters off the coast of Alexander Bay is periodically hit by waves from the bow, washing over the vessel. In the light of a thunderstrike, one of the crew spots something, and motions to the captain. The sighting is confirmed, to his horror. He starts relaying an emergency message to the Kriegsmarine command in Lüderitz. Many vessels, various types, markings unknown. He tries to give off as much information as he is able, until a broadside of Mark 42 guns ends his broadcast permanently.\n\nThe report, though brief and vague, sets off a scramble across Afrika, as a massive effort to confirm the report is undertaken. Eventually, an aerial reconnaissance flight returns with pictures that send an enormous wave of dread throughout the entire Schild. There can be no doubting it now, the Americans have arrived with their Sixth Fleet.\n\nGone is any semblance of German naval superiority. Shattered are any dreams of ending this war through a quick and daring naval invasion of the Cape. The seas belong to the cruisers and frigates of the American Navy, its skies to the flights of aircraft lined on the decks of the carriers. The fleet is of such a size that no one would dream of taking it on with the ships of the Schild. In one stroke, it appears the Americans have achieved victory at sea for the South African War."

 SAF.156.desc:0 "The general held a sheet of paper before a small, expectant crowd in front of a hangar in AFB Brooklyn. Behind him posed a handful of men from the South African Air Force's 57th Medical Detachment, along with their UH-1V "Horseshoe". As the general read off their exploits to the star-struck audience, door gunner Matthew Spirter recalled the chain of events that had just propelled the Horseshoe's crew to fame. The day began like any other: Taps at five o'clock, heli maintenance at seven, and border patrols until noon. With the exception of some GIs catching bullets in an unlucky firefight, the morning patrols were dull and boring. Up until that one morning, at least. Nothing could have prepared them for what happened then.\n\nHorseshoe had just touched down in Cape Town for refueling and resupply when the distress call came through the comms. Couple American squads, ambushed as they chased a column of SS all the way to Namibia. Brass dispatched them for medevac; everyone else was too far away or otherwise engaged. As the helicopter sped towards the border, another panicked alert from the ground reported only four men returning fire. Spirter cocked his M60 as they approached the LZ.\n\nThis was his first true test as a door gunner since his enlistment. Dad saw democracy fall in Europe; he swore to keep it alive in South Africa any way he could. So when the cluster of friendlies rose from the dunes and bullets peppered the Huey's sides, Spirter delivered burst after burst of .50 caliber fire at the dozens of Afrika SS below. That shut them up quick right as they landed and pulled the wounded out of the fighting.\n\nHe thought he saw war for the first time then, when the desperate Americans packed their limbless, wailing squadmates onto every free space Horseshoe had. The flight back home was as tense as a room cramped with fifteen war-torn men can be -- up until one of the wounded asked for a Zippo. Then they all laughed as fellow survivors do.\n\nBack in the airbase, Spirter caught an American with a stump and a pair of crutches among the crowd: a reminder of the lives he and the crew had saved. He smiled."

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.1.t:0 "Hard Decisions"
 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.1.desc:0 "Private Timothy Brooke counted eight other men hiding with him in the ramshackle apartment. One lost both his eyes, two carried bleeding stumps on their limbs, and four sported bullet wounds staining their khakis even with several layers of bandages plugging the bloody leaks.\n\nDoc rounded the list, scurrying from one corpse to another like a mother hen. A first aid slingbag swayed to and fro his side with a barren gape -- the morphine bottles and gauze packs it had carried lay scattered across the cramped domicile's floor. Some of them had been administered to the corpses littered about the street corner outside. At least the Jerries and their Bravo patsies halted their artillery barrage hours ago.\n\nThe orders from brass hours before that were simultaneously clear and vague: Hold out until relieved. Sarge must've asked himself when they can expect relief just as shrapnel skewered his brain into Halloween decor. At least his death was relatively quick. Painless, maybe. Timothy can't say the same for the poor sods the corpsman was trying so hard to keep alive. Combat fatigue can only numb so much of the pain.\n\nSo he asked the question again. "Doc," his hollow voice said, "Put them out already. You're running out of everything."\n\n"For the last time Tim," the medic hissed, "I can't just leave them out to die!"\n\n"They're already dead men sleeping. Just don't know it yet." None of the wounded stirred from their slumber. "Save what's left for tomorrow."\n\nThe night's silence settled between him and Doc, who had slumped against the wall with both hands on his face. It stretched out for who knew how long until Doc's puffed, bloodshot eyes locked with his. "I'll let you know," he whispered.\n\nWhen the moon hung overhead, seven shots broke the ruined city's fragile peace. And when sunrise brought with it a motorcade of friendlies and fresh supplies, a corpsman picked up an empty Colt and thrust the pistol to its weeping owner's hands."

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.2.desc:0 "If the Marines had the SS and Boer Kommandos, and the Air Force the Luftwaffe, Wesley Evans thought, then Logistics must too have an adversary. So like a genie, Africa had given them one. Case in point: the flying black devils buzzing about his ear. His neck bore a landmine of red swells itching harder than gonorrhea. No use swatting them out of the sky; the red swell shaped like his right ear served a painful, self-inflicted reminder.\n\nHe sighed, slumping against the drive wheel. The motor pool was ever under attack from three adversaries: boredom, heat, and mosquitoes. He'd learned to live with the first two. Now if there were only something to deal with the third once and for all-\n\n"Wes!" shouted Gary Murkowski. Evans tilted his head to the side. The half-naked American moseyed towards his truck with what looked like two spray cans on his hands. What did he want this time? He asked as much to his fellow trucker. "Well I heard you guys got a little fly infestation in these here parts," he shoved the can to a few inches away from Evans' face, "so I brought these from back home!"\n\nColour him surprised that an American would propose a potentially disastrous idea. "And I won't keel over from spraying this onto myself how?"\n\nMurkowski shrugged. "Don't knock it 'til you try it." Evans switched his gaze between the can and the American. Incidentally, the itch on his neck flared up at the same time. He bit his teeth and scratched the spot until his nails dug deeper into skin, leaving behind a trail of blood. The buzzing on his ears continued to taunt him. That does it!\n\n"Give me that," Evans spat, swiping the extra can off Murkowski's proffered hand. He pressed the release and sprayed lemon-scented aerosol on the dashboard, on the seats, and on his clothes and skin. He ran out of aerosol before he knew it -- but mercy of mercies, the buzzing stopped.\n\nWearing a wide, kak-eating grin, Murkowski said, "See? Told 'ya."\n\nEvans bathed in his newfound relief too much to do anything but glance at the can that saved his life."

There'll be a photograph taken of this moment: Hope, dressed in slacks, a golf club in one hand like the Nixon voter he is, and a microphone on the other. Table Mountain in the background, some Swedish-American beauty off to the side getting ogled, the sun shining bright over Darkest Africa. Iconic. But right now, all Bob sees is the fear.\n\nSo he does what he does best. He cracks one-liners, pokes fun at the mess hall food and the military lingo, and he makes the soldiers proud to be there.\n\n"You know," he jokes, "they call this place the world's biggest distributor of Messerschmitt parts!"\n\nCue the cheers from the Air Force boys. The Marines start roaring when he translates "Semper Fidelis" as "Don't worry, Doc, just nail it back on!"\n\nAs he wears easy smiles for the crowd, he looks out at the signs some of them are holding. Hometowns, loved ones, the dates they plan on getting back. Some of them, he knows, will never make that date.

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.4.t:0 "Life in Lephale"
 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.4.desc:0 "For as long as the sun rose and the moon set, Lephale prospered as the nexus where so many peoples meet. The old white men of the south traded guns for Xhosa wheat in the village, as did the Zulu trading their fermented milk for the strange contraptions of new white men from the north. The elders had thus called their vantage in the land a blessing... but now, as the two eagles of West and North waged war, Lephale's blessing has become a curse.\n\nThe Boers came first. They took the village's goods despite their owners' protestations, cursed the "savages" who dared to resist, and left behind a garrison of armed men. Some left to seek redress in a nearby town, never to return. A few crept off to join their rebel brethren, take an eye for their lost tooth, but most stayed put. Life went on.\n\nNext came the Americans. The Boers fled before they arrived; to sate their disappointment, the new white men captured Lephale's remaining elders for "collaboration" and handed out bars of chocolate. A headstrong young man dared to speak out against their captors' unfair exchange, receiving a rifle butt to the face for his troubles. Some talked of fleeing to safer ground, but most stayed put. The white men will leave as they had before. Life went on.\n\nLast came the Germans. They wore black uniforms, skull-capped medals and cold faces. They took all that was left and ordered every man who can carry a gun onto the village center. Old and young cowered in their huts when they heard three distinct sounds: first, shouts in an alien tongue. Then gunshots. Then screaming.\n\nDays passed before the survivors emerged to gather their fathers and sons. Sapped of their strength, the survivors stayed put, and slept, and wept. Only the specter of famine forced them back to their farms and herds. But soon burnt huts were buttressed with fresh timbers; some huts were rebuilt wholesale.\n\nThe old died and laid beneath fertile earth. The boys became men, married the many women who survived with them. Lephala prospered anew. The wheel turned."

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.5.desc:0 "Isaak clambered up the steep slope of what felt like the tallest dune yet. He had been struggling towards the pillar of smoke on the horizon for hours. Now it was just beyond this mountain of sand. Dragging himself over the summit revealed the wreck: a downed Me-262 fighter jet, half-buried in the sand with its left wing torn off. He smiled -- this one he had just shot down. When he approached, the pilot dug at the inch-thick layer of fine desert sand surrounding the cracked cockpit dome. After what felt like an hour of digging, Isaac finally caught the pilot within. He looked even younger than Isaak, maybe, but he was covered in too much blood, sand and glass to tell.\n\nIsaak shattered the cockpit with a solid kick and grabbed the poor boy by the shoulders. He had barely pulled him out when the boy drew a sharp gasp. Isaak nearly jumped out of his boots, slipping off the jet's wing and inadvertently tossing the Nazi onto the Namib. He scrambled back up towards the undead German. "Wasser. Bitte," it rasped.\n\nThe South African barely had water to spare for himself; he had used up the majority of it on his trek to the Messerschmitt, and he had no interest in giving his last gulp to an S.S. draadtrekker. He ignored the German for the time being and rummaged through the cockpit for supplies: two bottles of Fanta soda, but no water. He hobbled back to the Nazi and gave him one bottle, which he eagerly drank. "Danke," he rasped, "bist du ein Buren... eh... Boer?"\n\nIsaak didn't speak German, but understood the Nazi well enough. Afrikaans would have to do for communication. "Nee," he said, "ek is Suid-Afrikaans. Uh... soek jy 'n sigaret?" The German nodded, and Isaak handed him a lit cigarette from his pocket pack. Gazing into the west as the sun set beneath a dune, he said, "Wirst du mich töten?" Isaak didn't understand him, so he shrugged. The German sighed, dragging his thumb across his throat in a cutting motion. "O," he said, not sure of the boy's proposition, "il jy hê ek moet?"\n\nThe boy definitely didn't understand the words, but he seemed to get the meaning. "Oh, noch nicht," he said, shaking his head, "Ich möchte zuerst den Sonnenuntergang beobachten." So the two boys watched the sun set over the Namib, the sky flaring into hues of orange then red then purple then blue. As the stars came the German passed, like a ripple on a silent sea."

Then his left arm stung, drawing a piercing shriek on his lips and memories from his mind. A battle with those filthy Boers and their Kraut friends. A blast to the side, shrapnel digging into his skin, screaming- and black and nothing else.\n\nThe door swung open as if on cue, revealing three men with batons. "Hello Adriaan," said one with false cheer. "Glad to see you're awake."\n\nCheer faded as a frown took its place. "Now face the wall."\n\nIn one hard swing, the blackjack struck Adriaan's back with a resounding crack. The prisoner yelled as he slumped a bloody heap on the bloody floor. Another swing, directly behind his head, and Adriaan saw black again.\n\nHe woke up the next day to haze on his vision and blistering sores stabbing at his every bit of skin. Hair stood on end as a baton struck the cell's iron bars. The three officers had returned, this time with a bowl of pap, smiles wide as they regarded his hobble towards the bowl. A baton swatted his hand away as it reached for food, cracking finger bone and drawing another bloody scream. Pap fell to the blood- and dirt-smeared floor with a wet smack.\n\nAdriaan stared into his captors' soulless eyes. His flashed for mercy the German bastards would never give him -- like a dying mouse toyed by cats before they descend for the feast.\n\nAs he slipped into black a third time, Adriaan knew he will never leave his cell."

Wilbanks was pilot of a light reconnaissance aircraft conducting patrols near Pretoria when he received a distress signal from Capts. Benjamin Buckley and William Havelock. His immediate decision to enter their proximity revealed a numerically superior hostile force poised to surround the crash site of a Huey gunship. The Boer force, realizing that Capt. Wilbanks' discovery had compromised their position and ability to launch a surprise attack, immediately fired on the small aircraft with all available firepower. Meanwhile, they began encroaching upon the crash site while pinning Capts. Buckley and Havelock down with small arms fire from all sides."\n\n"Realizing that air rescue elements cannot arrive in time to evacuate the stranded pilots, and despite cognizance of both the limitations of his lightly armed, lightly armored aircraft and the enemy's overwhelming firepower, Capt. Wilbanks immediately assumed a covering, close support role. Flying through a hail of withering fire at treetop level, Capt. Wilbanks deterred the Boers' advance first with a salvo of white phosphorus rockets, then with rifle fire from the side window of his aircraft. Despite increasingly intense antiaircraft fire, Capt. Wilbanks continued to disregard his own safety and made repeated low passes over the enemy to divert their fire away from the crash site. His daring tactics allowed a rescue helicopter to successfully enter the combat zone and extract Capts. Buckley and Havelock to safety. During his final courageous attack to protect the withdrawing helicopter, Capt. Wilbanks was mortally wounded and his bullet-riddled aircraft crashed onto Boer lines."\n\n"Capt. Wilbanks' magnificent action saved two fellow pilots from certain injury or death. His unparalleled concern for his fellow man and his extraordinary heroism were in the highest traditions of the military service, and have reflected great credit upon himself and the U.S. Air Force."\n\n--Medal of Honor citation for Captain Hilliard A.

 SAFWAR.SAFFlavour.10.desc:0 "The arrival of the Australian contingent to the OFN's South African "advisor" group was treated as something of an after thought both by American planners and their Afrika-Schild counterpart. Australia's small army was not expected to contribute much more than help in stabilizing the front line. Its small special force command would equally be helpful in supporting American operations.\n\nThis perception of the men from down under proved entirely inadequate. Boer insurgents in conflict zones found themselves stalked by Australian commandos. African SS divisions walking into contested territories would be repelled not by the industrial might of the American bomber fleet, but by ambushes, sabotage and misdirection. German officers that initially cursed the cowardice of their African underling soon grew to fear the shadows where any number of Australian infantrymen might be hiding.\n\nThe lessons learned by Australia in the waning days of the Pacific war in the jungles of southeast Asia are proving their relevance to modern conflicts. Faced with the Japanese onslaught and faltering help from the United Kingdom at the time, Australian commanders learned to do more with less. Information gathering was often left to company level officers, encouraging cooperation with local leaders. In effect, many Australian companies operate as extremely well equipped insurgencies.\n\nDespite interest and analysis by both sides of the conflict, the strategies of the Australian army are not a panacea. Having been developed as a method to compensate for Australia's smaller army and industry, these methods do not help the OFN much in holding vast amounts of territory. Nor have the Australians found as much cooperation from African locals than from south east Asians dreading Japanese troops. But the Aussie's grit and courage have certainly added to the Schild's misery in the sectors they share."

 SAF_american_companies_deal_desc:0 "In our struggle against tyranny and darkness, material aid is of vital importance. We must begin making overtures for foreign support, and American corporations are an obvious choice. Outside of the German sphere and friendly to our way of life, we should be able to strike up an amiable arrangement."
 SAF_buy_american_guns:0 "Purchase American Guns"
 SAF_buy_american_guns_desc:0 "As our working relationship with the OFN increases in scope, it has become possible to purchase American arms en masse. They may charge a steep price, but each rifle in the hands of our boys is one the fascists cannot have!"
 SAF_tech_support_industry:0 "Request American Industrial Research"
 SAF_tech_support_industry_desc:0 "Perhaps the most well known quality of the United States, beyond its natural splendor, is its industrial potential. American advisors may be called abroad, bringing their vast technical knowhow to the factories of the Cape. We must redouble our production efforts and find innovative ways to reach peak efficiency!"
 SAF_tech_support_infantry:0 "Request American Military Research"
 SAF_tech_support_infantry_desc:0 "While we are a proud nation, there is only so much we can do. We may call American military theorists to our nation. If we can analyse our doctrinal and equipment failures as they occur, we may just stand a chance against these bastard invaders."
 SAF_american_companies_deal_big:0 "Award a Major Contract"
 SAF_american_companies_deal_big_desc:0 "Our war has attracted many interested parties abroad. If we were to bestow a major military contract, we might discover new innovations. The price will surely be steep for a nation at war, but the benefits just make that an acceptable loss."

 SAF_buy_american_guns_big_desc:0 "Like a hungry monster, the war demands more and more from our people. We must supplement our ailing reserves with a larger shipment of materials."

 SAF_increased_guerrilla_support_desc:0 "Across German Africa, there remain a few brave souls. Scattered partisan groups, taking advantage of lax rule in some Reichskommissariat and motivated by the sheer brutality in others, occasionally sabotage German operations.

At least, until the Iberians came to an agreement with us to use it as a refueling and supply station. Since then, it has been a vital stop for transport ships and warships alike - in addition to its close proximity to Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika, allowing for reconnaissance and covert operations behind enemy lines to expand."

Unfortunately, it's rather hard to find ideal approximations to acclimatise our troops within the United States itself. Fortunately, our quasi-allies, the Iberians, have agreed to open up their facilities in the tropical colony of Bissau in order to acclimatise our troops for the steaming jungles of Mozambique and the Congo. While not entirely able to acclimatise our troops for all African biospheres, we would have to make do for now."
