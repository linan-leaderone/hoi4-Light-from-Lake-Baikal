What is more substantive, in the words of Luis Batlle Berres, is that "some motherfucker is screwing around" with the people of Uruguay. To be more exact..."

The recent decision of the government to demolish the conventillo Mediomundo and kick off its black population proved controversial enough so as to cause a deeper understanding of the Afro-Uruguayans situation, leading to the refunding of the PAN.\n\nBarrios, inexplicably for foreign observers, has been able to convince a people otherwise proud of "coming from the boats" into supporting him; something conspiracy theorists have blamed on the strange "wololo" noises reported."
