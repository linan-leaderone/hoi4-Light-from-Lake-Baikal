 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_INTALLA_AG_ATTAHER_DESC: "Intalla ag Attahar has had a rough life, and there is no arguing the point. Born in French West Africa in 1927 as the son of Attahar Ag III, he witnessed first hand as the French colonial order that had confined and oppressed him and his people collapsed into dust. It was almost as if Allah himself had struck them down- one day they were there, and in the next they were gone. In this vacuum, Intalla and his father prepared the Ifhogas- the tribes they nominally ruled over- to continue their existence as an independent Tuareg Confederation.\n\nThis was not to be.\n\nGerman bombers soon began to obliterate the dunes and jungles of West Africa, destroying the cities and towns the Ifhogas ran and forcing them to flee into the sands of the Sahara. While this was a terrible setback for the father and son's plans for an independent Tuareg Confederation, it would, ironically, serve to help them in the long run. The other contenders for the region, being less used to the nomadic life, were slowly ground to dust while the Ifhogas continued to survive, if not thrive. As the years went on and the bombings continued endlessly, the morale of the tribes began to flag, and almost collapsed with the death of Attahar. However, Intalla stepped up into his father's seat, and was granted a blessing shortly after- the daily roaring of planes suddenly stopped. In near disbelief, the Toauregs spread out and conquered the lands of Azawad under Intalla's banner.\n\nNow, Intalla rules what he and his father always dreamed of- an independent Tuareg kingdom. All across the Sahel, wayward tribes flock to the nation-state, drawn by the seemingly inconceivable promises that Intalla has not only made, but upheld- stability, freedom, and total independence from those who wish to own the Toaureg people again.\n\nThe tribes have their freedom. If anyone, African or European, dares try to subjugate the area again, they will meet the fury of the natives, and Intalla will be the one to lead them."
 POLITICS_BEY_AG_AKHAMOUK_DESC: "Bey ag Akhamouk has had a rough life, and there is no arguing the point. Born in French West Africa in 1903 as the scion of amenukal Akhamuk ag Ihemma, he witnessed first hand as the French colonial order that had confined and oppressed him and his people collapsed into dust. It was almost as if Allah himself had struck them down- one day they were there, and the next they were gone. In this vacuum, Bey prepared the Ifhogas- the tribes under the banner of the Ahaggar - to continue their existence as an independent Tuareg Confederation.\n\nThis was not to be.\n\nGerman bombers soon began to obliterate the dunes and jungles of West Africa, destroying the cities and towns the Ifhogas ran and forcing them to flee into the sands of the Sahara.

The other contenders for the region, being less used to the nomadic life, were slowly ground to dust while the Ifhogas continued to survive, if not thrive. As the years went on and the bombings continued endlessly, the morale of the tribes began to flag, and almost collapsed with the death of the previous amenukal, Meslagh ag Amayas. However, Bey stepped up to the role of amenukal, and was granted a blessing shortly after- the daily roaring of planes suddenly stopped. In near disbelief, the Tuaregs spread out and conquered the lands of Azawad under Bey's banner.\n\nNow, Bey rules what he and his father always dreamed of- an independent Tuareg kingdom.

 ### Ideas ###
 AZW_idea_saharan_nomads: "Saharan Nomads"
 AZW_idea_saharan_nomads_desc: "The Sahara is a brutal environment, where only the hardiest forms of life can survive. The Tuareg tribes of Azawad are masters of this hostile landscape, making as much of a home of it as anyone could. Centuries of passed-down experience have given them a greater understanding of the desert than any outsider could ever hope to attain."
 AZW_idea_tuareg_heritage: "Tuareg Heritage"
 AZW_idea_tuareg_heritage_desc: "Azawad is not a nation so much as it is a tribal confederation, an alliance of the Tuareg tribes of the southwestern Sahara. The government isn't decentralized, it simply doesn't exist. Individual tribes roam the desert, migrating across the sands as they have done for centuries. Without significant reform and centralization, Azawad will never be remembered as anything other than a temporarily unclaimed region of western Africa."
