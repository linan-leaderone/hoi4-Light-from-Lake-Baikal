The nuclear payloads within ensuring that no first strike will catch this leg of the nuclear triad flat-footed.\n\nAt sea, the Navy continues its watchful gaze, an armada of carriers, destroyers, and cruisers spread from the Cape of Good Hope to the frontlines in the North Sea.\n\nBeneath the ocean's waters, the Silent Service plays cat and mouse with their superpower opponents. Submarines faster, deadlier, and quieter than anything their forefathers could have imagined stalking the waters. The silent boomers of the Navy's ballistic missile submarines lurk even deeper, the ultimate insurance policy against any first strike.\n\nAbove it all stands the President, the Commander in Chief, overseeing a military machine that inches ever closer to war."

They cling upon their degenerate beliefs of democracy and equality among the races, believing that there shall come a day where all who have wronged America shall suffer its vengeful wrath. Of course, this is nothing more than moronic spiel spoken by the mouths of Congress's wrinkled politicians clinging to glory days of the past - senseless bravado, all to feed the narrative that their nation, battered and broken as it is, stands strong.\n\nHowever, for this one time, it appears their bravado is more than just hot air and rattling of sabers. They've come to grown much bolder, or dumber, in their so-called "peacekeeping" efforts to such an extent that their forces are actively impeding on the stability of the Reich's possessions, in an active plot to undermine Germania's authority and prop up their degenerate puppets into the purified mainland of Europa. We've tolerated such insolence before, but it appears that these recent events aren't simple tricks of subterfuge by their shadowy operatives but something much, much bigger.\n\nWhatever their plans are, the Führer will not tolerate this brashness any longer. If the Eagle wishes to play a game of strength, then it shall be well met by the Reichsadler - accordingly."

The fiery oratory of Goldwater, of Smith, and Jackson, met with the equal measure of McGovern and Church, urging restraint and calm in the face of flaring tempers and high tensions. One view, however, is lacking.\n\nThere are no appeasers in this Senate, none who would dare see American honor besmirched, its reputation sullied in the face of fascists, Nazis, and tyrants. Not again.\n\nThis is the America forged in the atomic flame of Pearl Harbour, blasted and shaped by the fires of a vengeful public, buttressed by years of wartime propaganda. It is an America that shall fight tyranny, that shall defend the free, shelter the brave. A spirit, a commitment that has waxed and waned yet rediscovered stronger than ever as America hurtles to a final confrontation with the Nazi beast.\n\nIt is an America in which the idea of retreat, of cowardice in the face of danger, in the face of fascism and Nazism, is all but unthinkable. In the Senate, and the streets, and in the halls of power, the message is clear."

One by one, the Wolf Packs depart from their concrete dens and scour beneath the deep blue of the Atlantic, their orders clear as they stalk close to the sea floor for their metallic prey: stop any further incursions by the enemy into the Reich's naval territory, with force if they must.\n\nWith a sharp howl from the radar, a U-boat spots an enemy vessel entering its stomping ground; alarms are raised, the men scatter to their battlestations as the submarine begins its turn in the lonesome ship's direction. A torpedo is primed before it is loaded into a firing tube, the predator awaiting a few more precise seconds before unleashing its payload out into the blue, its course dead set for the magazine of the enemy cruiser with quiet, rapid speed.\n\nThe news spread to Germania rapidly, although the details are blurry as to whether the U-boat had fired first or if the Americans were to blame for the attack; either way, it changed little the fact that that torpedo could possibly be the first shot of a renewed war between the Reich and the United States. The clock ticks closer to midnight, and the Reichskanzlei is left to act decisively on this precarious issue."

It's sailors making final frantic checks over equipment, munitions, and supplies.\n\nIn the skies above Iceland, bathed by the Arctic sun, the men and machines of the United States Air Force acknowledge their new orders, aircraft moving in the long arc towards fortress Europe. The pilots reserved and their machines resigned as they raced to war.\n\nAt a telephone booth in an army base frantic with activity, a soldier turned to stare at the line outside as he thought of what to say. As helicopters roar overhead, he says the only thing he can.\n\nA mother, on the other end, takes the news with quiet solace and solemn silence.

The lack of clarity as to who fired the first shot in that confrontation has left them with a precarious choice as to whether to treat it as an undesired incident or, most notably, as the spark of a new Weltkrieg between the United States and the Greater German Reich. Whatever the decision would be, it was the Führer who would have the final say, his cabinet waiting with bated breath as to what his orders would be.\n\nSlowly, as if removing himself from a realm of deep thought, the Führer would raise his eyes towards his men, the answer flashing in his eyes before he even spoke the blood-freezing word: "Attack". There would be no formal apology given to the Americans, no attempts of bargaining with them for forgiveness to an act of aggression they have produced: the Reich will stand by its superiority and it shall display its might before the enemy, no matter the cost!\n\nThe cabal of officers would each exchange a knowing look, for there was no further question as to what was to be done. Each man would shift to their leader, clicking their heels together and swiftly raising their arm for one final salute."

All over town, people had retreated to their living rooms and dens. They sat with their children or their partners, alone or in the company of friends, sitting in frozen horror or wide-eyed glee. All stared at the glowing image of President [USA.GetPresidentLastName], propped up behind the Resolute desk.\n\n"This is not a decision I take lightly," said the President, glancing for a moment away from the camera to a photo on [GetSheHe] desk as if it could provide any escape. "I, like all of you, remember the costs of the Second World War, of the horrors inflicted by the Japanese on our soldiers and the people of Hawaii. We cannot hesitate in opposing offensive threats on the part of any nation, whether they be small or large."\n\nAcross the Atlantic in the city of Wismar, a similar scene played out. German families gathered in front of their televisions. Parents cradled their children and whispered sweet reassurances. Young boys wept or laughed at the prospect of battle. Most, though, remained silent as the Führer spoke, his voice crackling through the transmission.\n\n"From their actions, it may be clearly seen how, with all their hatred for the National Socialist way of life, this outcome was inevitable," said [GER.GetLeader]. "The Aryan way of life will not be secure until the so-called American republic is no more. In the entirety of German history, our people have never been more determined and united to achieve this goal."\n\nThe two towns watched their leaders. They continued to watch as the broadcast ended and the signal lapsed into patriotic songs. They could not know that, already, their leaders were receiving word of troop movements in far-flung reaches of their empires. They could not know that skirmishes had already broken out in cities all around the world. Still, they all knew what the speeches meant.\n\nWorld War III had begun."

Together, they would become masters of great, continental empires that span from the British Isles to Russia, across the whole of the Mediterranean, and the whole spectrum of Asia and the Pacific. The Axis Powers were the victors: united, they stood as gods over the battered, shamed superpowers of the old age.\n\nBut now, just as when united they had risen, it was perhaps destined that if divided, they would surely fall.\n\nGermany no longer resorts to the trickery of their propaganda or the manipulations of their slave economy: now, their armed forces begin to mobilize aggressively, in what can not be mistaken as a mere act of intimidating the Empire into submission. The Prime Minister's cabinet now urgently convenes to discuss the looming threat of what was once their iron brother from the West, as a dark storm of conflict begins to shadow over the lands of Nippon."

When the Führer had come before the children of the Fatherland promising revenge against those who defiled their nation's honor and thought of their deep-rooted supremacy as the true masters of Europe, the world watched as Germany rose with iron pride and will, rebuilding its armies to even greater heights for the coming war that shall make their destiny manifest - a destiny in which the newly-forged Third Reich shall be servant to none, and master to all.\n\nAnd, as history had shown: Germany prevailed. The empires of old had reached their twilight, their territories now property of the founders of a new order that falls beneath the shadow of the Crooked Cross, its hegemony stretching far and wide from the British Isles to Deutsch Afrika, to the freezing tundras of its Reichskommissariats. Like the Aesir gods of old, the Aryan race had prevailed over the titans that had conceived the canvas of imperial superiority, their vacant thrones now taken by even greater giants.\n\nNow, the coming of Ragnarok is upon the Greater German Reich, for the foolish Japanese fail to see that it is by the grace and compassion of the Master of Europe that they're permitted to sit at the table of victors, ruling their "Co-Prosperity Sphere" as they see fit. If they cannot recognize that Germania is free to expand its interests, that it has every right to take what it deserves, then there shall be no choice but to provide them with a reminder of Aryan superiority in killing old gods."

tension_diplo_crisis.13.desc:0 "Never once had the possibility of war against the Fatherland crossed the minds of those military leaders and strategic advisors that flank around the Prime Minister and his retinue of ministers. While the bond between the two superpowers had gotten colder since the inebriating years of victory over the Second World War, there still remained a fledgling essence of brotherhood among giants, as both held the familiar path of thrusting their once weakened and humiliated nations straight into the laurels of august hegemony over their respective spheres - masters of their own fate, bound by none of the now-defeated old.\n\nOf course, there was a more down-to-earth reason as to why Japan's leadership rarely entertained any future involving confrontation with the German Reich, and that would be logistics. Many of the maps, battlefield reports and other forms of data concerning the formations of the Wehrmacht's divisions and assessment of their strength date all the way back to 1945, making them utterly outdated and useless to be offering any tactical benefit for the Imperial Army. With the grim bonus of the Germans excelling in covering up their more dangerous toys in their arsenal, any current response to their aggravating actions could only result in bloodshed on a crippling scale for Japan; a massacre to which the Prime Minister would prefer to slate as a last resort.\n\nThe Prime Minister acknowledges these issues, and he is quick to reiterate to his subordinates that something must be done to counteract the technological advantage of their Aryan foes. Sacrifices will no doubt be made to pay for the blood price of securing the future of the Emperor's subjects - and if there is one thing that the Japanese understood better than their old brother-in-arms..."

Years ago, the late Adolf Hitler had granted to the Japanese the prestigious title of "Honorary Aryans", for he saw in them that despite their differences in culture, doctrines and especially genetics, they were not so different in their desire to manifest a destiny stolen from them by the perfidious Allies. After all, they too suffered the blindness of the imperialist parasites that sought to promulgate the corruption of their Judeo-Bolshevik puppet masters upon the innocent people they relished in their oppression. But now, the times have changed; whatever wisdom or intellect Hitler had seen in the Rising Sun perished in his departure to Valhalla, and with it, the new Führer's respect for the mongrels of the East.\n\nIn a public declaration before the Volkshalle, the Führer declared that the Japanese are now revoked of their status as Honorary Aryans, their failure to comprehending reason and the pleas for diplomatic resolution a telltale sign to the Reich that the Japanese have grown barbaric, their minds now cursed with the infection of the Untermensch's way of thought. With fire in his vocals and thunder in his clenched fists, the Führer laments this horrific betrayal by those they once called their brethren, their friendship spat on and their alliance of steel withered and rusted by the decadence that infests the Emperor's domain.\n\nAt the announcement's closing before the roaring crowd energized by anger and zeal, the Führer promises to his people that Germany shall respond to this insolence with fire and fury, that the only consequence deserving of a traitor to the Reich's generosity is by being swept aside as burning embers to their folly. A flurry of arms raise high in salute to this howl for war towards the great, golden eagle that hangs high above the stage."

After much debate, the Prime Minister and his cabinet have agreed that the oncoming war won't be fought by rifles and tanks, but by battleship cannons and screaming aircraft; no doubt was shown to the veritable notion that Germany wouldn't hesitate to make use of its nuclear weapons upon Japan, making much of the IJA's ground forces obsolete at the first rain of nuclear hellfire begins to crack through the grim skies.\n\nThey had confidence in the capabilities of the Emperor's warriors in the Navy and the Air Force, if not in the flimsy hope that the conflict wouldn't escalate to utter atomic annihilation by both sides. The Prime Minister could not help but to entertain the possibility of a traditional war himself, as would a few others among his cabinet, but atomic fire or not, there still would be hundreds of thousands of souls that would be sacrifice to the meat grinder that was to come - the only difference was whether their deaths would be abruptly swift or gruesomely slow.\n\nEven as it appeared that the Rising Sun was to set upon its glorious empire, its people would not abandon their trademark resolve to see their fate through till the end. The Prime Minister, his cabinet, his generals: they all were aware of the stakes, The Nazis may resort to their titan-killer weapons to uphold their fantasies of being masters above all, but Japan had endured the wrath of greater giants time and time again.

The same could be said as to how another World War could begin during the Age of Atom, a war in which the partaking nations will rely not on the steel of their weapons or the bravery of their men, but by a weapon so nefarious and destructive that even the old gods could feel its tremor from their realm.\n\nYet despite this nuclear sword of Damocles hanging above the two stirring giants, the Führer had nonetheless sent orders to the Oberkommando das Heeres to initiate secret battle plans drawn up years since after the Weltkrieg; contingencies that mandated the use of the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to dominate the seas and airspace of the Japanese Home Islands to make way for a land invasion of great magnitude that hasn't been seen since Unternehmen Seelöwe. Any hope of a peaceful resolution was dashed by the roaring screeches of Messerschmitt fighters and the droning horns of the Kriegsmarine's terrifying warships, the full might of the German Reich's warmachine now making haste to sail for the lands of the Rising Sun like a coming storm of iron and vengeance.\n\nIt is only fitting that the phases behind this ambitious invasion match the varying steps that summon forth the carnage of Ragnarok: Skoll and Hati, the wolves who chase the Sun and Moon, marks the arrival of the Fatherland's vanguard of ships and aircraft, and for the great battalion of soldiers that would take the battle against the Japanese upon their own soil, fighting these traitors to the Reich's superiority straight to the streets of Tokyo...\n\nThey were dubbed "Armeegruppe Fenris" and "Armeegruppe Jormungandr"."

Across the Home Islands and the greater Sphere, the Prime Minister's voice beamed through every radio and his face shone on every screen, promising to the people that the divine mandate of the Japanese people shall not be crushed by the arrogant Reich and its pride-drunken barbarians. While there can be only so much one man can do to rally a whole empire through the creeping veil of fright and doubt, an ecstatic energy shines among those who feel brave, ready to take up arms against the Nazis in what could be their greatest battle yet since the last war.\n\nIn Germany, the same essence of fear and doubt plagues the citizens of the Aryan Reich, their vigor for battle spurred by the fiery oration of their Führer as he, just like his counterpart from the East, promises that destiny sides with the superior race, that the Third Reich shall yet again prove its mastery over all by crushing the Empire of the Rising Sun and reminding the world of the indomitable might of Hitler's glorious civilization. Citizens already line the streets from the many recruitment offices dotting the cities, each staffed by men and women promising fame and glory to the courageous men willing to lay down their lives for the Fatherland.\n\nThe two titans were now awoken, their great vessels of steel and their vast swarms of unquestionably loyal warriors crossing through ocean and hearth to prepare for the greatest clash between superpowers seen since the days of the Weltkrieg.

However, they have recently begun to grow increasingly erratic in their interference of our activities, to such an extent that their military assets have begun to ramp up their momentum to dangerously active performance levels.

If anything, they worsened because of it. He could tell the mood was no different for those around him, too. The air had stiffened, even for a submarine. Looking around at those around him, Alan could tell from the pale visages and shuddering hands that everyone had the same thoughts running through their heads, like a broken record on a loop that couldn't be stopped. Their headsets chattered with the voices of radar specialists and the high command in the OFN.

Not that he could focus on them in the least with what he'd need to be focused on.\n\nIt was like a digital fourth of July. As the radar's pulse washed over the screen time and time again, and the pings illuminated the screen to the point that it looked like Alan was looking at a dozen fireflies dancing above the Louisianan swamp he knew so well, the horrific implications of the Japanese on the move were enough to make him snap out of his daze.\n\nHe could overhear the conversations of others beginning to disturb his thoughts.

Quite unexpectedly but nonetheless welcome by the Prime Minister and his cabinet, the Army and the Navy have come to cast aside their petty rivalry for the purpose of defending their homeland against these barbarians who have yet to learn their place, each side providing a contingency that will make the United States pay dearly for this act of aggression.\n\nHowever, as the discussions for a response have yet to spawn favorable results, an aide comes rushing into the chambers to the Prime Minister's side, informing him that the American President has issued an ultimatum: a cease to all hostilities - a cease to Japan's mandate as the dominant force in the Pacific.\n\nAll eyes were now on the Prime Minister, each waiting with varying levels of intensity as they awaited the final answer to this blasphemous demand by the Americans. To refuse this demand was to banish the Empire to extinction by nuclear fire, in exchange of safeguarding their honor; to accept it was not even worth consideration to some, for it meant that Japan would show weakness before the enemy, weakness to the people it leads beneath its crimson glare. The only audible sound within that chamber was the ticking of the clocks, each second shaping what would be the Prime Minister's final decision."

All over town, people had retreated to their living rooms and dens. They sat with their children or their partners, alone or in the company of friends, sitting in frozen horror or wide-eyed glee. All stared at the glowing image of President [USA.GetPresidentLastName], propped up behind the Resolute desk.\n\n"This is not a decision I take lightly," said the President, glancing for a moment away from the camera to a photo on [GetHerHis] desk as if it could provide any escape. "I, like all of you, remember the costs of the Second World War, of the horrors inflicted by the Japanese on our soldiers and the people of Hawaii. We cannot hesitate in opposing offensive threats on the part of any nation, whether they be small or large."\n\nOn the opposite side of the world in the small city of Nikkō, a similar scene played out. Families gathered in front of their televisions, transfixed. Some cradled their children and whispered sweet reassurances. Others cheered as Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] spoke. Most, though, were silent.\n\n"We cannot allow the forces of imperialism to prevail in shattering our community," said the prime minister, neither his voice nor his expression providing any hint to his mood. "Many of us remember the hardship of the 40s but, rest assured, our victory over the Americans will be swift. We will show them that people fighting for freedom and independence will defend their gains."\n\nThe two towns watched their leaders. They continued to watch as the broadcast ended and the signal lapsed into patriotic songs. They could not know that, already, their leaders were receiving word of troop movements in far-flung reaches of their empires. They could not know that skirmishes had already broken out in cities all around the world. Still, they all knew what the speeches meant.\n\nWorld War III had begun."
