 BUL_Konstantin_Partov_hog_desc:0 "§YPrime Minister\nAbsolute Monarchy§!\n--------------\n§LThat Konstantin Partov sits as President of the Council of Ministers is a testament to just how far the once-crucial role has fallen. A drab academic known only for his role in World War II-era repressions, Partov is not the insightful spirit that Bulgaria needs, but the impotent proxy which Boris III desires, brought back after a decade of irrelevance to serve as a Tsar's unpopular stooge.\n\nPerhaps a more able man could rise up from such a position - but President Partov cannot. After five years, he remains chained to the Tsar, unwilling to commit to any policy not proposed by Boris III. Even if the role of President of the Council of Ministers has any value at all, it has become quite clear that Konstantin Partov does not.§!"
 BUL_Stanislav_Balan_for_desc:0 "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs and Worship\nAbsolute Monarchy§!\n--------------\n§LOnce the Tsar's secretary, Stanislav Balan has grown into a helpful ally and personal friend to Boris III, distinguished in the Tsar's long line of undistinguished suits. For most of the world, meeting with the Tsar is meeting with Balan - on the level of foreign policy, the men are inseparable.\n\nWhile perhaps not the best of diplomats, Balan shines in his ability to transform the thoughts and whims of the Tsar into actual policy - namely, the Tsar's beloved push towards neutrality. For now, the plan has worked, but it may not work forever. For all their ties, Balan is strictly secondary to the Tsar himself. And deep down, even Balan has no idea what his friend - and Tsar - might do.§!"
 BUL_Petar_Aladzhov_eco_desc:0 "§YMinister of Finance\nAnocracy§!\n--------------\n§LIf the task of a modern Bulgarian minister is to sit down, follow the Tsar's dictums, and think as little as possible, Peter Aladzhov is certainly far outside his purview. One of the richest men in Bulgaria and a star administrator since the later days of World War Two, the man is known to the world as one of the most independent and recognizable figures in all of Boris III's government.\n\nAladzhov has also grown close ties to the largest voices of reform - mainly, Boris III's heir, Prince Simeon. The two men readily discuss a move away from the dirigisme of the Tsar and towards a free-market economy. For Simeon, it is his closest chance of influencing the current cabinet.§!"
 BUL_Vasil_Boydev_sec_desc:0 "§YMinister of War\nAbsolute Monarchy§!\n--------------\n§LIt would be wonderful to say that Vasil Boydev was selected for the Ministry of War for his many achievements: his revival of the Bulgarian Air Force, his negotiations with Liszt and Hitler, his command during the Vranje Uprising. Yet his choice was made less for his bountiful accomplishments and more for the independence those accomplishments have provided. A man so loved is beholden to no one - and with the military a mess of rowdy ideologues, Boris needed a man who couldn't be persuaded by any one faction of the army.\n\nOf course, there is a downside to such a plan - Boydev is also not beholden to the Tsar. But so long as the two mens' visions are similar, Boris can keep the ally he so desperately needs.§!"

 BUL_Kimon_Georgiev_hog_desc:0 "§YPrime Minister\nLeft-Wing Corporatism§!\n--------------\n§LKimon Georgiev, the old coup-maker, is perhaps the only man in Bulgaria to near the veneration and respect of Boris III himself. Involved in three separate coup d'etats over five decades, Georgiev founded the Zveno organization, even briefly ruling as Prime Minister in 1934. Though he has been under house arrest ever since, he remained influential in the armed forces. Using these connections, he aided in the revival of the long-shelved Fatherland Front - and with his skills, got them to power.\n\nSince then, Georgiev has been a fairly quiet ruler, content to let younger members of his staff work beneath him. Georgiev is old now - and the true work, liberation, is already complete.§!"

 POLITICS_BORIS_III_DESC:0 "The tale of Tsar Boris III extends beyond mere biography. For over forty years, the fate of Bulgaria has rested upon the Tsar's shoulders. Every act of heroism is his pride; every act of villainy is his shame. When they are all tallied up, what will his legacy be?\n\nBoris III's allies refuse to ask such a question - they feel they have an answer. With his intelligence and courage, Boris III delivered Macedonia to Bulgaria, saved the nation from fascism, and preserved its independence. This is the story his government tells: simple, clean, and easy to repeat.\n\nYet behind closed doors, many refuse to believe it. The Tsar has shown a clear trend towards authoritarianism, using harsh repression to maintain his authority. Despite all the pomp and grandeur, Boris III remains a dictator as much as a king - and as a dictator, he can be as stubborn and paranoid as anyone.\n\nRegardless of his legacy, the Tsar's story must soon end. Now deep into his sixties and in poor health, Boris III has begun grooming Prince Simeon to one day take his place. Someday soon, there will be no Boris III - and for good or ill, the tale of the Unifier-King will be complete."
 POLITICS_TODOR_ZHIVKOV_DESC:0 "Todor Zhivkov has spent the last decades consolidating his power - the power of himself over his state, and the power of his state over his party. The result, after a failed monarchist coup, is a communist Bulgaria - with Zhivkov at the head.\n\nDespite his decades of struggle in the name of the revolution, Zhivkov is not without controversy, both from within communist circles and without. Unlike figures such as Ranković, Zhivkov is not especially expansionist, but he still has incorporated nationalist views hailing from the monarchist-era into his vision for Bulgaria. He continues to claim Macedonia, to connect his reign to traditional Bulgarian national heroes, and to maintain a relationship with the Church. His promotion of his own daughter to the ministry of Art and Culture had also ruffled some feathers.\n\nNot only does Zhivkov draw ire from many communists for his nationalism, but also for his internationalism. He readily works with capitalist powers such as the OFN, and even works to normalize relations with nearby Balkan states. Nevertheless, while these decisions may anger hardliners, Zhivkov's same policies have made him beloved in the eyes of the common people."
 POLITICS_TODOR_ZHEKOV_DESC:0 "When Todor Zhekov first found glory on the battlefield, the poison of fascism was already in his head. Already, he imagined a better Bulgaria, one in which the Macedonians knew their place, one in which all its lost land returned home. Yet on that fateful day, he could not have known that he would one day be the man to lead it.\n\nHis life as a dictator began that day in Vranya. In the last days of the uprising, it was his army who took the town of Vranya and sent Koliševski to be hanged. He returned to Sofia a hero, emboldened to speak openly on his far-right ideals. In a nation reeling from the loss of Thrace and the instability in Macedonia, he found his audience: a youthful rabble to call his own.\n\nSoon, Zhekov became the favorite child of the fascist idolizer, a man who represented the aggressive and violent individualism of fascism movement. When Hristo Lukov died, the UNBL elected Zhekov to lead it, placing the general in charge of Bulgaria's largest fascist movement and functionally at the head of the far-right overall.\n\nOver his life, Zhekov has seen many movements like his fail. He watched the old UNBL calcify under Lukov and his uncle. He watched Alexander Tsankov flail and collapse. Those men refused the call of their nation - but Zhekov will listen, and Zhekov will fight. On the battlefield, he fought to the death - now, his country will do the same."
 POLITICS_ASEN_KANTARDZHIEV_DESC:0 "Even as he ascends to the head of Bulgaria, Asen Kantardzhiev is an unknown, an anonymous Führer. Even close followers of his party know him as little more than a name on a wall. Yet make no mistake - all of this was planned. This moment, this revolution, was the dream.\n\nThe dream began three decades earlier, in a small room in Sofia. A veteran of the Great War, Kantardzhiev came back to a nation in need of order, stability, purity. Yet in the paranoia that followed Zveno's fall, Kantardzhiev knew Boris would destroy any threatening organization - at least, any he could see.\n\nInstead of integrating with the military as the UBNL did, Kantardzhiev moved to the shadows. His "party" proved more conspiracy than party, influenced by Freemason societies. It worked. No matter how often he was arrested, beaten, banned, his party grew behind him, organizing autonomous pogroms, worming into Boris III's cabinet.\n\nNow, surrounded by the blood of fallen allies, Kantardzhiev rules alone. Now, few can tell what will follow next. Kantardzhiev always spoke of violence and might, saving a nation by reminding it of God and Tsar - but these are the words of a fascist, as weak and disposable as tissues. What will truly follow, no one can say but Kantardzhiev - and he is not one to tell."
 POLITICS_SIMEON_II_BORIS_DEATH_DESC:0 "Simeon Borisov von Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, now Simeon II, Tsar of Bulgaria, surveys the vistas of his beautiful homeland and eagerly begins to set apart his difficult work after decades spent as his late father's heir.\n\nA reformist, the Tsar spent much of his schooling in the West—or at least those parts of it accessible from within the grasp of Germany and Italy—and came back with hopes of transitioning the Bulgarian state away from the old oligarchical system towards a more free market. Boris III dismissed such suggestions as the fancies of a callow youth... until Bulgaria nearly collapsed during the Macedonian War. That terrible experience was more than enough to convince even Simeon's conservative father that reforms were needed—so the father followed the son, if hesitantly and with small steps of the sort that Simeon had taken when he was young.\n\nBut all things come to an end, and Boris has shaken off the mortal coil. The new Tsar has many ambitious ideas, but it is unclear whether he will have as easy a time at convincing the public of his ideas as his gregarious father did."
 POLITICS_SIMEON_II_BORIS_FLIGHT_DESC:0 "Simeon Borisov von Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, now Simeon II, Tsar of Bulgaria, surveys the vistas of his beautiful homeland. It is all he can do to distract himself from the untenability of his situation, for he is woefully underprepared for real rule.\n\nAs Crown Prince, the Tsar was educated in those parts of the West that were accessible from within Germany and Italy's grasp. He was taught many theoretically useful things and came back with many ideals and proposals. But the intellectuals that educated him could not give him any hints on how to hold his father's collapsing coalition together, let alone bring it back into prominence. Small wonder, then, that the new Tsar is in such a quandary.\n\nThe Macedonian War brought Bulgaria to near-collapse, and now another near-collapse is playing out—the communists and fascists fight amidst each other for control over the Bulgarian nation. But Tsar Simeon Second-of-that-Name can only watch passively as his nation bleeds. What choice does he really have, since his words mean little and his actions still less?"
 POLITICS_SIMEON_II_RESTORATION_DESC:0 "Simeon Borisov von Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, now Simeon II, Tsar of Bulgaria, surveys the vistas of his beautiful homeland, and shakes his head grimly. There is much work to be done, and he must be about it.\n\nAs Crown Prince, the Tsar was educated in those parts of the West that were accessible from within Germany and Italy's grasp. He was taught many theoretically useful things and came back with many ideals and proposals. But the intellectuals that educated him could not give him any hints on stabilising Bulgaria after Simeon's puppet-masters used him, threw him aside, and were then thrown aside by the Fatherland Front. He needed no Western teachings to call loyal policemen and soldiers to his side and seize power for himself.\n\nThe Tsar and his prime minister, the communist-hunting retired police chief Nikola Geshev, are in agreement; Simeon's old reformism is a foible that Bulgaria cannot risk when the situation is as grave as this. Authoritarianism, which after all had kept Bulgaria stable from its re-establishment, must be reembraced if there is to be stability in Bulgaria ever again."
 POLITICS_HRISTO_STOYKOV:0 "Hristo Styokov is not the true leader of the Zveno-ruled Independent Republic of Bulgaria. In the aftermath of the death of Kimon Georgiev Stoyanov, neither Stoykov nor anyone else had the stature to lead alone. No, Stoykov merely forms part of a trifecta of leaders, each playing to a different side of the coalition that props up the Zveno regime, which sorely needs propping up. With resistance to the unpopular authoritarianism and inefficient corporatism of Zveno growing left, right, and center, the triumvirate's services will all be needed - at least for the moment.\n\nStoykov, who connected Georgiev to the nationalists and the agrarians, is the champion of the radical militarists, those closest to the late Georgiev's technocratic, authoritarian vision. Stancho Cholakov, the Prime Minister, is the visionary in charge of the crowd of Zveno-aligned bureaucrats, who form the heart of the Bulgarian government. Then there is Dimo Kazasov, minister of defense - easily the most distinguished, but sidelined due to his right-wing alignment and personal feud with Georgiev.\n\nThese three will now govern. But until they can grow their influence, even this trifecta when unified cannot hope to match the strength of the man they have lost."
 POLITICS_NIKOLA_PETKOV_DESC:0 "Nikola Dimitro Petkov lived more than long enough to see Bulgarian democracy die once before, and that despite his every attempt to save it. He saw Aleksander Stamboliyski fall in a coup and fled to Paris. When he returned he was sent to and from prison camps throughout Bulgaria until the repression at last began to ease up a bit. Many people who met Petkov came to believe what one journalist said of him: "I have known no nobler friend of common people, no stauncher anti-Fascist, no more devoted democrat."\n\nThe Fatherland Front's reign progressed, autocracy grew, and Petkov realized that democracy could well die a second time unless he unified his efforts with that of the whole of the BZNS (instead of the factions closest to him) and formed a front against autocrats on all sides.\n\nWhen Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha's failed coup began, Petkov seized the opportunity that the Lord had clearly presented him and used it as a pretext to remove not just the Tsar but all the autocratic scum that had been ruining Bulgaria for years. In their place, Petkov enthroned true multiparty democracy in Bulgaria.\n\nThe question of democracy remains up in the air. Bulgarian Agrarianism as represented by the BZNS has struggled with party democracy because of the long and often antidemocratic legacy of Stamboliyski. But Nikola Petkov has sworn a vow to the God he loves, and who loves him: so long as he remains on Earth, Bulgarian parliamentary democracy will not die without a fight."

 BUL_rusting_sword_of_damocles_desc:0 "The Tsar is certainly our leader, but even his power is not ultimate. The military, bloated yet ever-present, holds a Sword of Damocles above his head. Unfortunately, they cannot wield it well. The armed forces are a den of cliques - some ideological, some personalist - that grows less functional by the day.

How cruel it is, then, that Boris's kingdom may die upon that same soil. Bulgarian forces nearly lost the region a decade ago, and their grip remains fragile.

 BUL_endless_roots_of_radicals_desc:0 "Democracy - typical party democracy, that is - never held much power in the Bulgarian sphere. Yet its fringes have persisted long after its extinguishment. Fascism has only grown more prominent in Bulgaria, even after the disastrous Gabrovski premiership, while Communists and Agrarians remain a persistent thorn in Tsar Boris III's side. So long as Boris III remains weakened, these roots will only grow deeper."
