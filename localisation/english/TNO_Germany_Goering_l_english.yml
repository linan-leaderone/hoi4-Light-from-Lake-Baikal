 POLITICS_HERMANN_GORING_DESC:0 "Göring once made a public challenge that if any Allied bomber dare reach the Reich that forever after he would be known as Hermann Meier. The success of Nazism in the World War proved his bluff wise, and Göring was soon sure to cut himself a piece of the great pie the victors greedily dove into once the Allies lie destroyed.\n\nUsing a mix of a somewhat political able mind and several excessive uses of blunt force, namely in the deployment of thugs, militias and 'patriots' to harass and drive off any threats to his power, Göring has centered himself as the sole politician in the Reich who truly listens to the pleas of the soldiery. Seeing no other way to power, he has surrounded himself by uniformed sycophants who have convinced the aging Führer that the only way for the Reich to prosperity would be through the utter destruction of its enemies.\n\nNow, Göring goose-step arm and arm on what many consider a rapid road to the destruction of the Reich. That is assuming he is soon stopped however, for one can only imagine what may happen once Göring sets his sights overseas..."
 POLITICS_ALBERT_BORMANN_DESC:0 "In a regime as prone to nepotism and corruption as the Reich's, one would naturally expect the brother of one of the top party officials to rise high in his own right regardless of competence. Albert Bormann would disagree. Despite being the brother of the head of the Parteikanzlei and one of the most powerful men in the Reich, Albert's chilly relationship with his elder sibling has ensured his lack of continued mobility into the upper ranks of the government. Still, the industrious former attaché to the Führer is not without his own allies. Naturally, the man he once served as a go-between for the Heer, Adolf Hitler, was always fond of him, and it was really only with the late Führer's patronage that Albert escaped being sent off to rot in one of the farther-flung Reichskommissariats by his estranged brother.\n\nThe Führer's death threatened to upend all that. It would have, that is, had not the victor been the other main protector within the halls of the Reich's power: Hermann Göring, the darling of the militarists. It was this militarism that drew the official to the Reichsmarshall, along with the man's own considerable charm, something that Martin never really had. Now, Göring has found in the brother of one of his greatest foes a competent administrator, willing to carry out his orders without hesitation or mercy."
 GENERAL_FERDINAND_SCHORNER_DESC:0 "§LBorn: 1892\nAge: 70\nBranch: Heer\nRank: Generalfeldmarschal\nThey call him "Butcher", "Bloody Ferdinand", "Hound of War" and many other brutal sobriquets. He is content with the title of Generalfeldmarshcall. He is skilled in large scale operations involving hundreds of thousands of men, and he cares nothing for their individual lives. Ferdinand Schörner is a man loved by none and feared by all. In the West Russian War it was said, the chances of being hanged as a deserter was greater than the chance of death in combat. His sway in the military was more than proven when, following a brief coup attempt at the end of that war, Schörner found his prospects for power actually rising.\n\nA veteran of the First World War, Ferdinand would end up as one of the Führer's favorite commanders in the Second. In more recent times he has also cultivated a mutually beneficial partnership with Reichsmarschall Göring, the old ace lending his political capital to Schörner's requests in exchange for the loyalty of the militarist faction.\n\nStill, the old devil of the Eastern Front has his own designs for the future, ones that may or may not require any politician to be his master. His rivalry with the other star of the Wehrmacht, Hans Speidel, is one of the largest obstacles he has yet to be encountered. Only time will tell if he has finally met his match, or, as some fear, he is only a step away from achieving his own ambitions.§!"
 GENERAL_JOHANNES_STEINHOFF_DESC:0 "§LAmong the heroes of the Luftwaffe, there is one pilot who stands head and shoulders above almost all others: Johannes Steinhoff. One of the most experienced aces of all time, Steinhoff was one of the very few pilots on either side of the Second World War to survive from the war's start to its end, flying combat missions throughout. Even after suffering horrific burns following a disastrous accident while test piloting the ME262 jet prototype, Steinhoff was back in the skies as soon as the doctors cleared him. Not wanting to lose such a valuable asset, Hermann Göring assigned Steinhoff to the Luftwaffe's pilot academy, where he served as head instructor for several years. Steinhoff would fly again during the West Russian War, and when that conflict too had passed he had hoped to live out the rest of his days peacefully as a teacher. It was not to be however, as the Bürgerkrieg enveloped Germany, the ace was faced with a hard choice. Eventually, he chose to follow Hermann Göring, the appointed successor to the late Führer. This time, the Reichsmarshall had more than just an instructor's billet in mind for Steinhoff, and shortly after Göring's victory the old veteran found himself as the new Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe.§!"

 GER_Otto_Ernst_Remer_army_chief:0 "§YIf Schörner is the butcher, Otto Ernst Remer is his bloody knife. As a young officer coming of age just before the rise of the Nazis, Remer devoted himself body and soul to the National Socialist cause. Remer served with distinction in the campaigns against Poland, the Balkans, and during Operation Barbarossa, eventually rising to a battalion command in the Grossdeutschland Division. Remer's crowning glory came when he was personally awarded Oak leaves to his Knight's Cross by no less than the Führer, Adolf Hitler, himself. Remer's unit served in the thickest fighting of the war, from the deep heart of Russia where the Union was finally broken to the hills of North England where war finally came to its close.\n\nIn the long years since then, Remer has steadily grown in his influence within the Wehrmacht, rapidly rising to become Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's right hand man, and as a consequence, the second most powerful man in the militarist faction of the officer corps. While Remer does have a strong degree of respect for his fellow warmonger and direct superior, his loyalty truly lies only with whoever he believes furthers the cause of the ultimate global victory of National Socialism, and whomever he thinks can best support that goal with action.§!"
 GER_Artur_Axmann_for_desc:0 "§YReichsjugendführer\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LArtur Axmann is considered one of the first politicians wholly of the Nazi generation. Artur first joined the NSDAP in secondary school, becoming an exemplary member of the Hitler Youth. After his graduation from the youth ranks of the organization, Artur became Reichsjugendführer, and fully took upon his shoulders the responsibility of teaching the German youth of the greatness of National Socialism and of the German Reich. Notably, he was also responsible for conscripting members of the Hitler Youth into the German army.\n\nAlways a patriot, Axmann also gave service to his country during the Second World War. He fought with the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front, though was sadly forced to retire from this duty when he lost his arm in combat. Artur has known no life but that of a loyal Nazi since he was a child, and as such, remains totally and absolutely dedicated to the cause he has been brought up upon. As such, he is a clear symbol of the intelligence and dedication of the German children.§!"

 GER_Wilhelm_Stuckart_hog_desc:0 "§YParteiminister\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LWilhelm Stuckart was a judge before the rise of the NSDAP, and this brought him under the wing of Hermann Göring, who was Ministerpräsident of Prussia at the time. Through his own legal expertise, as well as his growing friendship with the man, Stuckart quickly emerged as Göring's number two man, being partially responsible for much of the Prussian administration during that period, also participating in the theft of numerous cultural artifacts for the administration.\n\nWith the NSDAP's rise to power, Stuckart joined the Ministry of the Interior, eventually becoming a co-author of the Nuremberg Laws. He furthermore was responsible for signing a decree obligating the report of any newborns with deformities. It was later under this very same decree that Stuckart's own one-year-old son was euthanized for being born with Trisomy Twenty-One.\n\nThough he pledges himself to the party and the militarist cause, Stuckart is truthfully only loyal to the advancement of his own career and to his old friend Göring. Much of Stuckart's power has come from pure favoritism, though in these positions, he has proven himself one of the Reich's foremost legal experts. Most importantly however, he is a man whom Göring can trust.§!"
 GER_Rudolf_Diels_sec_desc:0 "§YChef der Geheime Staatspolizei\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LBefore there was Hangman Heydrich, before there was Gestapo Müller, there was Rudolf Diels. Diels is another of the long-time Göring cronies who have seen their fortunes rise dramatically thanks to their patron's ascent to Führership. Diels and Göring first met in 1933 when the latter was given the position as Minister-President of Prussia where Diels served as the head of the Preußische Geheimpolizei, the state's secret police. Thanks to his work, Diels had an encyclopedic knowledge of prominent political figures, including members of the Nazi party, and some of their dirtiest secrets. Seeing the potential benefit of having Diels' knowledge at his beck and call, Göring established what would soon become the Gestapo and placed Diels in charge of it. Diels tenure as Gestapo director would only last a year however as Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich would work to undercut him within the government. Their maneuvering paid off and in 1934 Diels's tenure came to an end with Reinhard Heydrich succeeding him as the head of the Gestapo.\n\nDiels has kept largely to himself for the past two decades, although his connection to the Reichsmarschall has only deepened - he is even married to Ilse Göring, cousin of the Führer. Now that the accursed Heydrich is gone however, Diels can regain control of the organization that was always rightfully his and a new era of the Gestapo's dominance within the Reich is about to commence.§!"

 GER_Paul_Korner_eco_desc:0 "§YReichswirtschaftsminister\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LPaul Körner, while serving as an artillery officer in the First World War, formed a long and lasting friendship with Herman Göring. He would later go on to join the NSDAP and the SS, rising rather quickly as an early member of both. Notably, Körner was present alongside Göring and Hitler during the negotiations for the NSDAP's coalition with Hindenburg, an agreement that led to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor and laid the path for his later rise to rule over Germany.\n\nAfter the NSDAP took full power, Körner found himself appointed as Göring's secretary for the Four-Year Plan, also holding a seat for the NSDAP in the Reichstag. At one time, Körner also served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Reichswerke, a company founded by his old friend. Though Körner is cunning and talented in his own right, his career has undoubtedly been mostly shaped and aided by his friendship with the Reich's uncle, and that does not seem likely to change.§!"

 GENERAL_EDUARD_WAGNER:0 "§LQuartermaster General of the Heer, Eduard Wagner has earned infamy for his brutality towards civilians. A devoted Nazi, Wagner crafted the regulations for the Wehrmacht and SS to cooperate in the killings of Jews and Slavs on the Eastern Front of the Second World War. He managed the task of supplying the Wehrmacht with winter clothes and fuel successfully during said war, and gained respect from many other generals for his efforts. During the West Russian War he reallocated supplies away from Himmler and towards the main front, aiding in holding the line while leaving the SS out to dry when they made their move. Since then Wagner has become ingratiated with the militarists, becoming a close ally of Ferdinand Schörner.§!"
 ADMIRAL_KARL_JESKO_VON_PUTTKAMER:0 "§LKarl-Jesko von Puttkamer is a man of unmatched loyalty and willpower. Always on a fast track to greatness from his noble blood, von Puttkamer has been a man loyal to the Reich and the Reich alone. Hitler's naval adjutant during the war and afterwards, von Puttkamer was very close to the late Führer. Hitler once visited von Puttkamer in the hospital after he was wounded during Himmler's failed coup, proceeding to award von Puttkamer with the Wound Badge. Von Puttkamer currently professes loyalty to only the Führer and the Reich, though he publicly supports Göring and the Militarists.§!"
