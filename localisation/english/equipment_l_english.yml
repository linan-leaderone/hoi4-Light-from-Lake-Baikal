  infantry_kit_eq_45:0 "1945 Infantry Kit"
  infantry_kit_eq_45_desc:0 "During the Second World War gas attacks were not as common as in the First one, so the importance of masks was reduced. Helmet technology advanced, making head injuries less common, but the helmets are not bulletproof still."

  infantry_kit_eq_52:0 "1952 Infantry Kit"
  infantry_kit_eq_52_desc:0 "In general, given the superplus of military equipment left from World War II, infantry kits haven't evolved too much. Some designs have been revised and in the case of footwear, synthetic rubber has been adopted fully as a material."

  infantry_kit_eq_82:0 "1982 Infantry Kit"
  infantry_kit_eq_82_desc:0 "The eruption of full-scale war across the world has lead to gigantic leaps in infantry kit design greatly aided by accurate battlefield feedback. Innovations once thought to be several decades in the future are being forced onto the soldiers of today, as ballistic protection and shrapnel defence become key focuses of current design."

  infantry_kit_eq_88:0 "1988 Infantry Kit"
  infantry_kit_eq_88_desc:0 "Experience from recent total conflicts have brought into sharp relief the critical importance of integrating communications equipment directly into kit, resulting in radio-enabled helmet-visors and the beginnings of realtime vital sign monitoring.
