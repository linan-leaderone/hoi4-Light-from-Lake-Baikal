 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_DMITRY_KARBYSHEV_DESC: "Dmitry Mikhaylovich Karbyshev's story is a tragic one, full of betrayal, loss, and fury. He first fought for the Tsar in the Great War, joined the Red Guards in the Civil War, and returned to duty when the Motherland was invaded once more. Captured by the Germans and sent to a string of concentration camps, Karbyshev was beaten, tortured, and left to die, but he never lost hope in his people. Eventually, he and a few others escaped the death camps and fled east, past the Union's weakening grip and into the arms of Lazar Kaganovich's West Siberian People's Republic.\n\nEmbittered by years of suffering, Karbyshev resolved to never let Russia see such torment again. He began planning for what he called the §RGreat Trial§!, the coming final conflict with Germany that would seal Russia's fate. Gathering many like-minded comrades to his cause, he soon rebelled against Kaganovich and seized Omsk, turning the city into a fortress where he could prepare in peace. Karbyshev proclaimed the rule of the All-Russian Black League, the only organization he saw fit to guide Russia through what lay ahead.\n\nBut time wore on, and distrust grew among his once-loyal officers. Now he can do naught but watch the vultures circling above, and weep at how those he hoped to save fight each other instead of the enemy. The §RGreat Trial§! looms ever closer, and unless someone worthy takes up his mantle, Dmitry Karbyshev fears Russia will be doomed when it arrives."

 POLITICS_DMITRY_YAZOV_DESC: "Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov is part of a new generation of post-Soviet leaders: those born after the rise of Lenin, with no memories of the Tsar or the Great War. They knew hardship as children, but were told that this hardship was a necessary sacrifice for the Motherland's survival. When the Nazis came swarming from the west, they fought on the front lines under the Red Army, witnessing hell on earth and suffering bitter defeat again and again. When the Great Patriotic War was over, what little happiness they had in their former lives was taken from them by the victorious Germans. The West Russian Revolutionary Front's military failures and subsequent collapse in the 1950s only made men like Yazov more set in their ways: the old Soviet commanders had fervor, but the leadership desperately needed some fresh blood. Younger men, harder men, those who were taught from birth about the value of sacrifice and have witnessed it firsthand.\n\nWith Comrade Karbyshev having passed before his vision was complete, the burden now falls to his protégé Dmitry Yazov to carry it out. Unlike his former mentor, Yazov has both the will and the stamina to implement it, and is already transforming the entire nation to be ready for a form of total war more destructive than any the world has ever seen. He expects his people to sacrifice everything they have, including their lives, to help achieve revenge against the German menace, and many of them will gladly do so. Nothing, not even the threat of atomic fire, will be enough to deter him from his course, and he frequently boasts that if all Germans and all but one Russian perish in the coming war, it will still be a victory.\n\nOmsk is stirring from its slumber, and the world trembles at the thought."

 POLITICS_DMITRY_YAZOV_70_DESC: "Dmitry Yazov looks upon his handiwork, a strong and hard Russia preparing eagerly for revenge, and smiles pridefully.\n\nYazov and his comrades had known hardship as children; they were told that the hardship was a necessary sacrifice for the Motherland's survival. But failures of the Great Patriotic War and the West Russian War first broke the minds of Yazov and his ilk, as they realized how futile it had all been. Then it led them to conclude that the leadership of the Russian people needed to be in the hands of young, hard men who had been taught well about sacrifice and knew it firsthand.\n\nComrade General Karbyshev, founder of the Black League, suffered death and was buried before his vision was complete; it fell, therefore, to his protégé Dmitry Yazov to carry that vision out. After subjugating West Siberia, defeating the liberal and old guard insurgency to secure his rule, and unifying the whole of Russia, Yazov was freed to begin his master work: that of transitioning all Russia into a state of readiness for a form of total war more destructive than any seen before.\n\nYazov now expects his people to sacrifice everything they have - even their lives - to achieve total revenge against the German menace, and more and more of them are willing to do so. Nothing, not even the threat of thermonuclear hellfire destroying civilization itself, will be enough to deter him from his course. Indeed, Yazov frequently boasts that if no Germans and only one Russian survive the coming §RGreat Trial§!, it will still be a total victory.\n\nThe §RGreat Trial§! approaches, and Yazov smirks as the opportunity for his revenge upon those that raped his homeland comes ever closer.\n\n§RAnd "the lamps are going out all over Eurasia; we shall never see them lit again in our life-time."§!"

 POLITICS_OMSK_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC: "Dmitry Yazov is dead. The champion of the Black League, the carrier of Karbyshev's great mission is no more. Being chosen to lead the most conscientious force in Russia to the victory against the Fascist beast, Yazov failed to handle the ambitions of the vainglorious and power-hungry warlords and doomed the League to a miserable end. Without its leader and guide in the Russian struggle, the League ceased to exist as a single entity and became a collection of feuding generals, who seek to grab their part of the great heritage of Karbyshev and have long forgotten about the purpose that once united them.\n\nWith Yazov's death, the §RGreat Trial§! has failed. Although the remaining League generals are trying to hold on to their naught fiefdoms, the will of a powerful neighboring warlord is sufficient to erase the last remains of the All-Russian Black League in Omsk."

 POLITICS_PAVEL_BATOV_OMSK_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Since the vile armies of the Black League descended on Sverdlovsk, Pavel Ivanovich Batov has been trapped in a great darkness, his mentor slain, his homeland lost. His life has been defined by endless struggle for his own life and the life of his nation. Yet somehow, he stands - broken, bitter, but unflinchingly alive.\n\nBelow his feet, the Glavkoverkh. The death of Dmitri Yazov was the pinnacle of Batov's insurgency, the one act that could finally unravel the Black League. In the days after, the believers in Batov were vindicated, as the Black League command collapsed. Sverdlovsk, easily liberated, seemed like the first step towards saving the region from utter tyranny.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, it was clear that much more was needed. Soon, the resources of the insurgency stretched thin, while warlords and remnants blocked Batov at every turn. What began as a plan to liberate all of Western Siberia was gradually cut down to an insecure hold on the Sverdlovsk region. All else was lost.\n\nSome might call it a tragedy. Batov is certainly frustrated - even now, he plots to finally retake what few lands the Black League still holds. Yet when he looks at his new citizens, he cannot help but disagree. Even in the chaos of the collapse, the people of Sverdlovsk shine with hope. The world may be burning, but at long last, there is light."

 POLITICS_EVGENY_SAVINTSEV_OMSK_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Perhaps it is hunger. Perhaps it is the cold. But for just a moment, Evgeny Aleksandrovich Savintsev broke the greatest dictum of the Black League. He considered surrender.\n\nOnce the second-in-command to the Glavkoverkh himself, Savintsev was infamous for his special forces brigade Spetsgruppa V, the Black League's final line of defense. Their last assignment, to hold the Fang against an uprising in the Redemptionary Brigades, was supposed to be simple. But with supply lines cut and a nation in chaos, Vorkuta was... lost. For Savintsev, it was a failure greater than any other.\n\nNow, the general and his troops have been stranded in the Northern Urals, cut off from any major cities or supplies. The situation is dire. Food has begun to run thin. Bullets require rationing. Riflemen's trigger fingers are locked by frostbite. Yet when his officers demand he spit out an order, Savintsev can only shout "Attack." No matter how many resources he loses. No matter how many of his men die.\n\nFor all their harm, these final orders are not an act of cruelty. They are the instinctual response at the very heart of the Black League. For an entire decade, the commander of Spetsgruppa V was told to never surrender. As his forces rot away, Savintsev can finally see the price."

 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_PASTANOGOV_OMSK_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Behold the bogatyr in his final hour. Its king is dead, its armies scattered; its death must be moments away. Yet in the city of Zlatoust, Konstantin Konstantinovich Pastanogov holds his last stand.\n\nOnce, Dmitry Yazov found himself in need of a mighty army to strike fear into his enemies. He requested his finest man to lead - Pastanogov, who pledged slavish devotion to his leader. The Glavkoverkh called its army "Task Force 'Bogatyr'". For years, it rode across the countryside, trampling all who failed to serve under hooves of shells and bullets.\n\nThen, the Black League was broken apart by traitors, and the bogatyr found itself trapped in the fortress of Zlatoust. But the knight had been trained well, and returned to its endless slaughter. Armed with Dragunov's endless arsenal, Pastanogov forced any who could hold a rifle to die for a dead master. In whispers, the bogatyr endlessly repeated: "PLAN HYDRA WILL NOT FAIL."\n\nBut do not believe these cursed words; Russia shall behold not this pale horse. In due time, the walls of Zlatoust shall fall, and Yazov's chosen murderers will join their Glavkoverkh. The bogatyr, loyal and dutiful, has killed countless men in the service of its master. Now, at least, it may follow its duty to perish."

 POLITICS_SOSLANBEK_APAYEV_OMSK_COLLAPSE_DESC: "To hear Soslanbek Nikolayevich Apayev tell it, the failure of Yugra was its disorder. In its final years, the old regime could only measure a feeble resistance against the Black League. In a matter of weeks, Ioseliani was gunned down for treason, his empire stolen away. The Vory v Zakone were scattered to prison camps to be re-educated, or more likely, to rot.\n\nBut a cat has nine lives, and Vory v Zakone many more.\n\nThough Yazov attempted to transform the soul of Yugorsk, its criminal ways lingered. In Yugorsk's prisons, gangs formed, following the ways of old. With the Black League watching, most were quickly crushed or forgotten. Only one man - Apayev - thrived, dominated, monopolized. When Yazov was shot for his crimes, Apayev seized upon the opportunity. And as the prisoners hung their masters, they looked to one man, a blood-soaked Moses, for guidance.\n\nNow, the city of Yugorsk belongs to the thieves - but mostly, it belongs to Apayev. While the Free City follows some elements of the Vory v Zakone code, Yugorsk has one leader and one authority. He demands payment. He demands loyalty. He demands blood. He demands everything from his people - and in turn, he promises, he will give them everything they desire. The failure of Yugra was disorder. It will never see disorder again."

 POLITICS_VALENTIN_SHASHIN_OMSK_COLLAPSE_DESC: "For most men, the black gold of Surgut is a supreme temptation, a blank check that could let them fulfill their every impulse. Perhaps Valentin Dmitrievich Shashin is no different.\n\nA middle-manager in the lean government of the Free Aviators, Shashin's career had always been as a supporter, managing the intensive fuel needs of such an air force. But the Free Aviators are long lost now. Without their ever-present reign in the skies, the government of Surgut was left to its civilian components. By luck, by diligence, Valentin Shashin had managed to become the most well-known of these bureaucrats - and, in time, their leader.\n\nNow in power, Shashin focuses less on the survival of Russia and more on the refugees who take shelter in his borders. They are clothed, fed, and sheltered, treated with the dignity that Lenin always dreamed of - provided they spend a few years in the refineries. For the cost of this working-class utopia is an endless stream of fuel, sucked from the ground and sold to whichever warlord might need it.\n\nUndoubtedly, Surgut has the highest standard of living in Western Siberia. Yet a doubt lingers in the chairman, even as the people of Surgut cheer his name. Bocharova used whatever resources she had to save Russians across the nation, no matter their ideology or creed. Shashin shakes the hands of despots and fuels their reigns of terror. Yes, he has saved a city - but what has become of the nation?"

 POLITICS_VIKTOR_KOLESNIKOV_OMSK_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Some may have expected Viktor Demyanovich Kolesnikov would break. But the yearning for freedom is a drive that never yields - it shall be felt within him till his final days.\n\nWhen Sverdlovsk was lost to the Black League, Victor Kolesnikov lost everything. While he was spared the fate of many of his commanders, he was thrown to the Vorkutlag, to be molded into the perfect officer or to die at his post. Soon, his jailors thought, this man could become a proper member of the Russian National Army - violent, emotionless, and servile.\n\nInstead, Kolesnikov mocked his so-called commanders with open insolence. As many times as he was sent to solitary confinement or beaten until he could not see, he would come back more sure in his convictions, more ready to resist. As weeks went past, other inmates watched this dissident stand firm in the face of oppression. Soon, his fellow prisoners came to resist at his side.\n\nNow, with Omsk cut off, a vengeful army of prisoners at last refuses to yield. United behind their leader, they have hunted down their cruel captors or forced them into the Urals to the South. It is vengeance. It is justice. It is loyalty to old causes and dead leaders. And at its head, there is Viktor Kolesnikov, calling his men to action, finally standing free."

 POLITICS_PAVEL_MESHIK_OMSK_COLLAPSE_DESC: "To hear the people of Nizhny Tagil tell it, Pavel Yakovlevich Meshik is a hero of the working class, liberating them from the vile Black League. But look closely. Someone is listening in.\n\nIn truth, Meshik began as a chief of the secret police, cruelly devoted to Kaganovich at every turn. When Tyumen fell, most expected Meshik would be executed. But where most would denounce the brutality of the secret police, the Glavkoverkh saw loyalty he could to twist into service. And so Meshik served - from town to town, from house to house, on an endless hunt for those who denied the necessity of the §RGreat Trial§!.\n\nYet they never managed to catch the man who shot Glavkoverkh Yazov in the chest.\n\nNow as always, Meshik hides away from justice. His citadel, Nizhny Tagil, provides him and clique a comforting story that none deserve. Here, the chekists have returned to every corner, listening for those who talk of Chairman Meshik's past openly. Those who dissent disappear into the night, or are hung in the streets. It seems Meshik hopes to cover his past in a coating of blood.\n\nBut red cannot stain that which is already black. The town of Nizhny Tagil may have its eyes stapled shut, but the rest of the nation knows more than Meshik could ever hide. The chairman is one with the Black League, and with them he will die."

 POLITICS_HADJI_UMAR_MAMSUROV_OMSK_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Hadji-Umar Dzhiorovich Mamsurov, veteran of the Ural League, has seen a dozen enemies rise and fall. In a decades-long military career, there has scarcely come a day that Mamsurov had not had to fight for his survival. But until this moment, he had to fight alone.\n\nOnce a devoted USSR soldier, Mamsurov found the Ural League in their long march to the south. Here, he found the tools of asymmetrical combat, tested on the countless enemies that the League would come to face. Then, Yazov conquered the Guards and sent them to far-off camps. Mamsurov was left outnumbered and outmatched - just as he always was.\n\nBut this time, something had changed. Enemy divisions appeared disloyal, more supportive of Mamsurov than their own leader. It culminated with a shocking missive: that a man named Batov hoped to work with the Ural fighters as brothers in arms. And when the news came that Pavel Batov had killed the Glavkoverkh, Mamsurov and his armies rose up once and for all.\n\nNow, Mamsurov leads his army in a moment of unusual calm. The Urals are tired of war; they look to him and see a moment of quiet. And with his north protected by Batov, a somehow trustworthy friend, perhaps the Urals will see peace for years to come."

 POLITICS_VIKTOR_GRIGORIEV_DESC: "Viktor Antonovich Grigoriev is many things: brave, courageous, and certainly an opportunist. When he was called to leave his hometown of Omsk and serve in the Red Army, he fought tooth-and-nail, staying in battle with frostbite and later ramming an enemy tank with his own. It was only logical for him to later join the Black League's army after this pointless struggle, but he was never particularly dedicated to the League's cause.\n\nGrigoriev cleverly survived the intrigues between the three West Siberian cliques as a low-ranking officer until the war with the merchants of death, when he was one of the first to jump off the sinking ship and side with the enemy.\n\nHe might have been humiliated back home, but that did not concern him once he was appointed mayor and warlord of Omsk. Grigoriev may be a mere puppet of the government in the Urals he answers to, but as long as he keeps control, all is fine."

 POLITICS_VIKTOR_GRIGORIEV_ONEGA_DESC: "Viktor Antonovich Grigoriev is many things: brave, courageous, and certainly an opportunist. When he was called to leave his hometown of Omsk and serve in the Red Army, he fought tooth-and-nail, staying in battle with frostbite and later ramming an enemy tank with his own. It was only logical for him to later join the Black League's army after this pointless struggle, but he was never particularly dedicated to the League's cause.\n\nGrigoriev cleverly survived the intrigues between the three West Siberian cliques as a low-ranking officer until the war with the anti-communists of Onega, when he was one of the first to jump off the sinking ship and side with the enemy.\n\nHe might have been humiliated back home, but that did not concern him once he was appointed mayor and warlord of Omsk. Grigoriev may be a mere puppet of the government in Onega he answers to, but as long as he keeps control, all is fine."

 # Karbyshev cabinet
 OMS_Dmitry_Yazov_hog_desc: "§YDirector of State Administration\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\n§LWhat can be said of Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov, the protégé to the Black League's founder? Born in a backwater town near Omsk to a peasant family, Dmitry joined the Red Army at the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War at just seventeen. When the Germans caused the complete and utter rout of the Red Army, Dmitry was forced to make his way back to West Siberia and drawn to the new strength of Kaganovich's West Siberian People's Republic.\n\nHowever, like many military men in West Siberia, a black coal of hate formed in Yazov's heart for the Germans for what they had done to his Motherland. His dedication to the defence of Russia drew the eye of Dmitry Karbyshev, the general who would go on to break with Kaganovich and form the Black League. Dmitry, liking Yazov's intelligence and fanaticism to the cause of saving the motherland, took him in as his personal protégé. This caused Yazov to go with his mentor to Omsk when they finally declared independence from Kaganovich, and he became the right hand man to the older man.\n\nHowever, Yazov holds nothing but contempt for what he sees now. The people all around Karbyshev only pretend to believe in the cause of the Black League, using their mantle to do whatever the hell they please with Karbyshev too powerless to stop it. He swears to himself that he will make the old man proud, that Karbyshev's dream of a final §RGreat Trial§! with the Germans defeated once and for all. After all, he is Dmitry Yazov, and he will make sure his mentor's work was not in vain.§!"

 OMS_Viktor_Abakumov: "Viktor Abakumov"
 OMS_Viktor_Abakumov_for_desc: "§YDirector of Foreign Affairs\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\n§LThey say a good NKVD officer is a ruthless one, and how right that statement is.\n\nAn ethnic Russian of dubious origins from the Don Cossack region, Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov was once part of the mighty Red Army during the Russian Civil War, the spearhead of the proletariat's struggle and the Soviet Communist Party! How proud he was, as joined the party and its security service, the OGPU at the time!\n\nHow frustrated he felt when he was demoted to overseer of some distant GULAG! Sure, his tendencies as a womanizer as well as an opportunist looking to enrich himself were far from what you'd imagine to be the ideal socialist in the eyes of the Soviet apparatus, but he served dutifully! Carrying each sinister order given to him, which perhaps explained his survival. Fortunately, during the mid 30's the reorganization of the soviet security apparatus came to be, propulsing Viktor as the NKVD head of the Rostov Oblast shortly before the war with Germany, time he amply used to - yet again - enrich himself should hard times come.\n\nAnd the hard times came: Bukharin's USSR was devastated during the Great Patriotic War, leaving all Soviets Republics devastated from the invasion and the bombings following it. Landing himself a position within Kaganovich's West Siberian state shortly before its fracturation, Viktor soon came to become one of Karbyshev's close associates, becoming in the process one of the future emblematic figures of the Old Guard within the Black League.\n\nYears later, Semyonovich is still true to himself and his needs. Women? Luxuries? All he wants, he shall get as he uses his position within the Black League to this end. The §RGreat Trial§!? Karbyshev's ideals? Viktor doesn't care, merely pretending to in order to satisfy his personal greed.§!"

 OMS_Alexander_Kharkhardin: "Alexander Kharkhardin"
 OMS_Alexander_Kharkhardin_eco_desc: "§YDirector of State Development\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\n§LIf one begins to examine Alexander Kharkhardin, they may first notice his sizable house - unusual for a member of the Black League - filled with paintings condemned for sale or destruction. Dig further, and one may find the lost contraband of his ministry appearing on the black market soon after, and reports of treasury funds going missing. But the trail will soon run cold, with every suspect file doctored and every would-be witness silenced. And just as one thinks they have a smoking gun, they will find themselves in a ditch, court-martialed and sentenced on a trumped-up charge of treason, in a pile of bodies that goes deep into the earth.\n\nSuch is the manner by which Kharkhardin maintains his empire.§!"

 OMS_Konstantin_Valukhin: "Konstantin Valukhin"
 OMS_Konstantin_Valukhin_sec_desc: "§YDirector of Internal Security\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\n§LThe All-Russian Black League of Omsk are men with the hardest task imaginable: to prepare the Motherland for the §RGreat Trial§!. Given that they have such immense responsibilities, it is only fitting that the men of the Black League should enjoy privilege above the common Russian, is it not? And given that this is necessary, anyone who pushes against this state of affairs must be an enemy of the League. That is how Konstantin Valukhin sees it, at least.\n\nKonstantin Nikolayevich Valukhin has spent much of his time in the service of the security apparatus of one Russian government or another, serving first in the Cheka of the early Union, the NKVD of Bukharin, and then Kaganovich's security apparatus, until finally coming to Omsk with Karbyshev and the founders of the Black League.\n\nValukhin has, however, always been an opportunist. In the decadent revolutionary states of old, the greatest path to opportunity was through the security services, and he has found a similar opportunity for privilege here, as chief enforcer of the Black League and its parasitical Old Guard. Valukhin sucks the life from the people of Omsk and, through his position, seeks to prevent anyone in the Black League from changing this.\n\nIncluding, if necessary, the Glavkoverkh himself.§!"

 # Yazov cabinet
 OMS_Evgeny_Savintsev: "Evgeny Savintsev"
 OMS_Evgeny_Savintsev_hog_desc: "§YDirector of State Administration\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\n§LEvgeny Aleksandrovich Savintsev is a curious byproduct of the Black League, a man of an unassuming expression and even more quiet presence, preferring to speak what is necessary, apparently no particular hobbies or interests, and uninterested in the inner politics and day to day by the Black League. Evgeny could be passed by your typical lieutenant and commander of a squadron, fated to either an ignoble death or the preparations of the trials ahead as another faceless soldier.This couldn't be further from the proof, albeit by his interest, this general idea helps his and Yazov's interest tremendously.\n\nFor Evgeny is not a simple cog of the machine, but the engineer and maintainer of the Black League's finest weapons against the warlords, the Black Army's Special Units.\n\nBorn in Tomsk, he barely finished school by the time the Soviet Union rose against its youth for what was once to be the Great Patriotic War, but simply became the deathbed of the Russian dream; there, amongst the ruins, despair, seeing soldier after soldier run over by the seemingly unbeatable German March, his mind was not beset by despair, but by cold logic, taking every piece of what happened in the war, and how the German army operated, what could have countered it, crushed it into a pulp and brought any amount of salve for the thousands that lost their lives for a nation that utterly failed them all. His quiet demeanor speaks of a deep, frozen rage beset in his soul, and a determination to create the perfect weapon to destroy Germany's pride, piece by piece until nothing else is left but the hollow husk they've made him be. Such fury and dedication to the League's ideals made him a perfect pick by Yazov as his right-hand man, and the second opinion to pick what will be the vanguard of soldiers that, one day, will lead the push to the Teutons themselves.§!"

 OMS_Aleksandr_Sakharovsky: "Aleksandr Sakharovsky"
 OMS_Aleksandr_Sakharovsky_for_desc: "§YDirector of Foreign Affairs\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\n§LA survivor of the Siege of Leningrad, Aleksandr Mikhailovich Sakharovsky is a man devoted to the Black League just as Yazov is. However, he is also the man responsible for ensuring the League maintains a "good face" on the world stage. Most people in the greater world could never truly understand the need for the League and the truths espoused by them. As such, he paints the League as a force for good, with them serving as a "protection force" against "the evils that threaten Russia and her children".\n\nUnder the table though, Aleksandr serves another purpose. As a former member of the NKVD, he was charged with aiding the League's sabotage and infiltration efforts in other warlords. After all, unlike many warlords in the Russian Anarchy, the leadership of the Black League realize that wars are not only won on the battlefield, but in the shadows. Omsk is the shadow state of Russia, and Aleksandr will guide its shadows with Yazov's guiding hand to victory.§!"

 OMS_Evgeny_Pitovranov_eco_desc: "§YDirector of State Development\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\n§LEvgeny Petrovich Pitovranov was a man that seemed to have been prepared for a single, sole purpose: the preparation of the Black League's complete and total militarization for the §RGreat Trial§!. In 1937, Pitovranov had joined the Communist Party while studying at the Russian University of Transport. In a year's time, he had been put in charge of NKVD operations in the Gorky region, being moved around various regions, working in tandem with the NKVD and the KGB to suppress dissent and ensure the pacification of settlements.\n\nAs the Soviet Union began to crumble, Pitovranov and his unit was redeployed west of the Urals, where they ultimately found themselves under the jurisdiction of the West Siberian People's Republic. Pitovranov and his unit became cogs in the Omsk Regional Directorate of the NKVD, during which time he became affiliated with the gradually-growing Black League.\n\nAs the West Siberian People's Republic collapsed, and Karbyshev's Black League seized the region of Omsk, Pitovranov was one of the first members to join the new administration. Since then, he has been tasked with the complete militarization of the Black League's territories - no small task - and one that he's carried out with the utmost proficiency.§!"

 OMS_Yuriy_Drozdov_sec_desc: "§YDirector of Internal Security\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\n§LHate is all Yuri Ivanovich Drozdov knows now. He grew up with a caring family in Belarus, with a mother who was a part of the Belaruisan Secretariat and his father being a decorated war hero of the Polish-Soviet War. Yuri lost his parents during Operation Barbarossa when the Germans overran the city of Kharkiv where he was training to be an artillery officer. While plans were made to evacuate him to Aktobe, the Germans were too fast and he barely made it out of the city with his life. A fifteen-year-old now on the run, he headed to the only place where he thought he could bring the fight to the Germans: the West Siberian People's Republic. Taking over a year to reach it on foot with just a rifle and his uniform, he enlisted in the Republic's army.\n\nHowever, Kaganovich failed to truly prepare to fight the Germans in Yuri's eyes. This easily made him seduced by Karbyshev's new Black League which would truly keep Russia safe from the Germans. Deserting with many others in the Republic, he became an intelligence officer within the League, and began a friendship with Karbyshev's protégé, Dmitry Yazov.\n\nNow head of the Internal Security Directorate, Yuri has made it his goal to make sure the League never falls into the degeneracy it once did. He will ensure that everyone remains loyal to his friend and leader Yazov, and that there will be no dissent when the §RGreat Trial§! begins against the Germans. Yuri will avenge his country and his parents, no matter what it takes.§!"

 ### Ideas ###
 OMS_fueled_by_revenge: "Fueled by Hate"
 OMS_fueled_by_revenge_desc: "During the Last Trial, each of us saw and faced Hell on Earth. The Nazis razed our cities, slaughtered our families, and shattered the Union we worked so hard to build. And as the world unraveled around us, we resolved to never again allow the Teuton to despoil our homes. Never again would we tremble in fear as the jackboot trampled on our soil.\n\nWhatever the cost, whatever the sacrifice, the day of the §RGreat Trial§! will come.\n\nOn that day, they will feel our terrible vengeance."
 OMS_nothing_left_to_lose: "Nothing Left to Lose"
 OMS_nothing_left_to_lose_desc: "Our backs are pressed against the wall, our supplies run low, and yet morale is as high as ever. Each and every son and daughter of the Black League knows their mission, and knows that they have nothing to lose, for the Last Trial already robbed them of everything. This simple truth has transformed the League from a band of disgruntled veterans to an army with discipline unparalleled in the Russian wastes.\n\nWe will survive our current, dire circumstances, we will rebuild what was lost, and when the §RGreat Trial§! comes, we will repay our enemies for every life lost."
 OMS_karbyshev_figurehead: "A Puppet in All but Name"
 OMS_karbyshev_figurehead_desc: "It is a sad fact that the founder of the Black League, General Karbyshev, is not as young as he once was. As he has aged, though his mind is as sharp as ever, his body has become frail and weak. The people weep to know that he is not long for this world; and yet not all is lost. The loyal sons and daughters of the Black League's officer corps are glad to receive and deliver General Karbyshev's orders, and even to reinterpret them when the General's mind has slipped.\n\nIt is a service that most are glad to perform, no matter how much the General begs for it to end."
 OMS_idea_quiet_war: "Prepare for the Storm"
 OMS_idea_quiet_war_desc: "A spectre is haunting Omsk - the spectre of insubordination and betrayal. Whispers around the halls threaten division and strife among officers, and plots against the League are forming to pick comrade Karbyshev's great project clean. To face this silent enemy, we need to redouble our efforts against cliqueism, find the traitors, and neutralize them. In the end, we will cultivate the ideal of a loyal force to the people of Russia, that will work tirelessly for the liberation of the motherland."
 OMS_the_shield: "The Shield of the Motherland"
 OMS_the_shield_desc: "Shelters, bunkers, AA guns - all possible measures have been taken to secure our sacred Motherland from the brutality of the Hun. Let they or any others come - no matter how hard the hammer falls, our shield is of unbreakable, unbending iron, forged from the will of our people."
 OMS_new_boss: "New Leadership"
 OMS_new_boss_desc: "Comrade Karbyshev's sudden death has thrown a spanner in the delicate administration of the League, and while comrade Yazov has more than enough willpower to carry on his ideals, it is not enough to keep things stable. This instability, however, is only temporary and will fix itself once everyone accepts comrade Yazov's leadership."
 OMS_leadership_secured: "Leadership Secured"
 OMS_leadership_secured_desc: "The struggle is finally over and Glavkoverkh Yazov ended up victorious. Overtly traitorous officers have been neutralized and those who remain are supporting his rule over the League. As a result, our officer corps are more obedient and the army can carry out orders in a much more efficient fashion."
 OMS_collapsed_central_authority: "Collapsed Central Authority"
 OMS_collapsed_central_authority_desc: "When Dmitry Karbyshev founded the Black League, he hoped to build a strong nation, a steel wall to protect the motherland and her people. Unfortunately, things are never that simple.\n\nWith Yazov's death, the thin veneer of order among the League high command disappeared, as conspiring generals found out that they had nothing in common with each other, except for ambition and mutual hatred. As the city of Omsk burns down, against the backdrop of a meaningless fight for a broken throne, only one thing is certain:\n\n§RThe Black League has failed Russia, her people, and General Karbyshev. The Great Trial will never be put to action, victory against the Reich will never be achieved.§!"

 OMS_securing_the_people_idea: "Securing the People"
 OMS_securing_the_people_idea_desc: "We secured our control over western Siberia by force of arms, but that does not mean that our rule is secure enough. To make sure that no other threat to our power rises up, we sent military cadres across conquered territories establishing logistic networks and bringing stability to the people. This system is simple and efficient, and it should be adopted for pacifying newly reclaimed territories."
 OMS_an_end_to_luxury: "An End to Luxury"
 OMS_an_end_to_luxury_desc: "In order to mold the Russian people for the §RGreat Trial§!, we have begun a program of wealth expropriation with the aim to eliminate decadence and hoarding. Cadres are checking the factories to ensure production is focused on military equipment and investigating cases of hoarding wealth against the State and the people.\n\nWhen the §RGreat Trial§! shall begin, we will not find ourselves unprepared."
 OMS_an_end_to_luxury_2: "An End to Luxury"
 OMS_an_end_to_luxury_2_desc: "Everyone knows that luxury can corrupt even the most stalwart spirit. And when a nation is too focused on the short term gain of wealth, the people will become decadent and soft. The cadres are redoubling their efforts in containing the spread of corruption, and our industry has adjusted to this new situation without too much trouble.

To do so, we must shape Russia and its people into a perfect machine that can be made ready for war at any time we want.

 OMS_a_new_sibplan_idea: "A New SibPlan"
 OMS_a_new_sibplan_idea_desc: "Bukharin was a fool but his ideas were not unsound: his plan to uncover the riches of Siberia and turn the region into an industrial powerhouse have its merits, namely the creation of a strong industrial base centered around the Kuznetsk basin. Our new SibPlan will take this development to the west, building a new industrial base around the city of Omsk, correcting the economic imbalances between different areas of Russia."
 OMS_project_kamera_idea: "Project KAMERA"
 OMS_project_kamera_idea_desc: "Project KAMERA is the name given to several weapon development programs, and among the most secret there are research projects involving chemical, biological, radiological weapons, and their application in modern warfare.

 OMS_isd_field_commissars_idea: "ISD Field Commissars"
 OMS_isd_field_commissars_idea_desc: "The Field Commissar Corps is a new unit tasked with maintaining ideological purity among military cadres.

Integrating these units within our army will ensure their loyalty to us and their efficiency in executing orders."
 OMS_expanded_auxiliaries: "Expanded Auxiliaries"
 OMS_expanded_auxiliaries_desc: "Our new program of expansion of the Redemptionary Brigades is currently active. By offering them better conditions and the promise of an eventual release, we can see the brigadiers putting more effort and achieving better results than before. They are still of extremely limited usefulness to us, but with these improvements they can fulfill their roles with more efficiency. There are also reports that indicate better integration of the Brigades with the Army, which is also owed to the program."

 OMS_expanded_system: "The Expanded System"
 OMS_expanded_system_desc: "One of the lessons that we learned from the Potemkin Program is that controlling the flow of information from Russia to the outside world is the only way to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the world. As such, we will expand the number of agents in the villages designated by the Program to ensure that not a single thing can escape our control of the narrative."
 OMS_national_reconstruction_idea: "National Reconstruction Efforts"
 OMS_national_reconstruction_idea_desc: "Western Russia was left in ruins after the failure of the West Russian War and years of uninterrupted bombings by the Luftwaffe. Even after reunification, the traitors in charge were too inept to give the region the proper direction for economical and industrial revival. With the Black League in charge, that will soon change. West Russia will be turned into the vanguard of the Motherland, every single means of production will be reconstructed in preparation for the §RGreat Trial§!, to withstand the assaults from the Reich both industrially and logistically."
 OMS_project_kamera_idea_2: "Project KAMERA"
 OMS_project_kamera_idea_2_desc: "The discovery of several "revenge weapons" hidden in the arsenals of Syktyvkar will give us the necessary edge to defeat the Nazis in the §RGreat Trial§!. The fruits of Soviet research in the field of chemical weapons will be put to good use against Germany. Already our scientists are developing new equipment from the material found in Syktyvkar.\n\n§RAnd when the Germans will come, they will find us prepared.§!"
 OMS_underground_military_depots_idea: "Underground Military Depots"
 OMS_underground_military_depots_idea_desc: "We have begun the construction of nuclear bunkers across the country to shelter the Russian people against the atomic retaliations of the Reich. We will shelter our people through the harshness of the Fourth Thesis, and once the dust settles and Russia is avenged, they shall climb out of their underground complexes to reclaim the earth. Above a world of ashes, dust, and embers, only the Black flag, the flag of victory, will stand out against the wastes."

Where the General failed, he will succeed. He is younger and sees the true state of Omsk. Some lesser officers believe the League is an invincible, omnipotent entity ready to restore Russia.\n\nYazov is not nearly as shortsighted.\n\nHe sees a rotten organization that has been corrupted from the inside by opportunists and recreants. He sees policies that need to be implemented and countless procedures that must be reformed - boots that must be laced up and belts that must be tightened - before the League will be in any shape to take on our immediate enemies, let alone the rest of Russia or Germany itself. Luckily, the Glavkoverkh is a man of ambition and has already laid out a slate of reforms that will correct the League's course and transform it into a proper polity."

It also led him to neglect other areas some would consider necessary to nation-building, such as developing proper infrastructure. As well, the Siberian Plan failed to industrialize Omsk, despite it being one of the largest cities in Siberia. As a result, we lack the heavy industries required to undertake a campaign as massive as reuniting Russia.\n\nGlavkoverkh Yazov plans to rectify these shortcomings with a series of industrial reforms that he hopes will allow us to surpass our enemies and truly kickstart our war machine."

 ### Initial Karbyshev tree ###
 OMS_initial_last_days_of_comrade_karbyshev: "The Last Days of Comrade Karbyshev"
 OMS_initial_last_days_of_comrade_karbyshev_desc: "General Dmitry Mikhailovich Karbyshev is dying.\n\nThis is a fact that nearly everyone in the Black League is keenly aware of, and yet life continues as usual. The soldiers march through the streets of Omsk, the factories churn out as many guns as they can between bombings, and, much to Karbyshev's chagrin, the officers bicker as always.\n\nComrade Karbyshev does not have long, and yet his energy does not seem to have left him, even in his last days. The General plans to tackle some of the greater problems facing Omsk, with the help of his closest confident and student, Comrade Yazov. With his aid, and General Karbyshev's characteristic zeal, the Black League's course will be righted, and we will march ever forwards along the path to the §RGreat Trial§!."

 OMS_initial_review_the_redemptionary_brigades: "Review the Redemptionary Brigades"
 OMS_initial_review_the_redemptionary_brigades_desc: "General Karbyshev designed the Redemptionary Brigades as a means for those who had served the enemy in the past to cleanse themselves. The sons and daughters of those groups that betrayed the Motherland in the Last Trial would earn their salvation through fire and war. Unfortunately, the current state of the League has betrayed this noble purpose. These days, the Brigades serve as a tool of the various cliques that permeate the once great League.\n\nGeneral Karbyshev has seen this, and will thus end it. The Redemptionary Brigades will receive new training methods, better equipment, but harsher standards. Their officer corps will be overhauled into truly loyal children of the Black League, and we will ensure only those who truly deserve redemption will serve in the Brigades through rigorous trials. When the day of the §RGreat Trial§! comes, the Redemptionary Brigades will march with us side by side in defense of Russia."

 OMS_initial_trust_in_yazov: "Trust in Yazov"
 OMS_initial_trust_in_yazov_desc: "Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov, long General Karbyshev's favored student, has of late been the only man in the Black League the General finds trustworthy. A brilliant strategist, dedicated to the ideals of the League, and loyal to his mentor, General Karbyshev believes it is well past time Yazov came into his own.\n\nYazov will be given heightened responsibilities across the League as a whole, including supervision over the Redemptionary Brigades, the reforms of which he seeks to spearhead. General Karbyshev finds himself hopeful for the first time in years, for if any can see his vision through to the end, it is Yazov."

 OMS_initial_watch_the_borders: "Watch the Borders"
 OMS_initial_watch_the_borders_desc: "One of the few things everyone in the League agrees on is that we are utterly surrounded by enemies. Kaganovich, the greatest threat, rules with an iron fist over Tyumen and the surrounding territories, and it is no secret that, if given the chance, would be more than happy to invade our small statelet.\n\nIf Kaganovich thinks we will not go without a fight, he is mistaken. Yazov will personally oversee the construction of several new lines of defense along our border, as well as the repair of an old radar station. When Kaganovich comes - for one day he will come - we will be more than ready to crush him."

 OMS_initial_a_quiet_war: "A Quiet War"
 OMS_initial_a_quiet_war_desc: "Comrade Yazov has, in his most private moments with General Karbyshev, expressed doubts of a smooth transition of power after the General's death. The League's fractured state, and the cliques of officers responsible, Yazov fears, may just be volatile enough to erupt into armed conflict if the situation isn't handled delicately. And so General Karbyshev has given him leave to do as he sees fit to ensure a peaceful succession.\n\nComrade Yazov has already began his efforts to grow his own power base, and to combat the schemes of his rivals - and yet more must be done. Comrade Yazov will train the Redemptionary Brigades to prepare for even the highest treasons, and he will engage in scheduled radio broadcasts to the League as a whole, earning their loyalty and respect.\n\nWhen the General meets his end, Comrade Yazov will be more than ready to continue his legacy."

 OMS_initial_against_the_old_guard: "Against the Old Guard"
 OMS_initial_against_the_old_guard_desc: "When General Karbyshev first dreamt up the League during the Last Trial, he envisioned a disciplined army, ready to stand for Russia at any moment, unbroken and united in their purpose. Of late, it seems, the officers of the League have lost their way. Bickering and disunity has become a way of life for the League, even to the point where some question the General's authority - but this will end immediately.\n\nAt once, measures will be taken to ensure that the old guard are cowed and brought back to the fold, by force if necessary. The General knows this will be an uphill battle, but in the end, it is one that must be fought - for if Russia cannot trust its eldest sons, who can it trust?"

 OMS_initial_enforce_discipline: "Enforce Discipline"
 OMS_initial_enforce_discipline_desc: "While the General's reforms have perhaps not had the desired effect as of yet, he is not an idle man, and will not allow himself to sink into inaction and despair. Many low level commanders within the League report a sense of indiscipline and cowardice among the lower ranks. Infighting has become commonplace among the men and women that are supposedly Russia's saviors.\n\nPerhaps a stronger approach is needed. General Karbyshev will work to enforce greater discipline in the ranks - drills will be held twice a day, meals will be shortened to ten minutes, and dissenters will be given harsh punishments.\n\nThe officers need only obey their orders."

 OMS_initial_breaking_the_cliques: "Breaking the Cliques"
 OMS_initial_breaking_the_cliques_desc: "Blame for the League's current state is not wholly on the shoulders of the rank-and-file, as much as the General wishes it was so. A broken roof does not destroy a house, but rotten foundations will. The source of so many woes plaguing the League may be traced back to one ever-present threat: the Officer Cliques. Those meant to command the League into a new age have lost their way and fallen to the decadence that threatened the destruction of Russia during the Last Trial.\n\nThough he grows more weary by the day, General Karbyshev will continue his reforms. He will not allow all that he has done to be for nothing - the League must endure, but for that to happen some sense must be restored to the officers.\n\nPerhaps now, he hopes, they will finally listen?"

 OMS_initial_the_final_speech: "The Final Speech"
 OMS_initial_the_final_speech_desc: "As the General surveys the results of his hard-fought reforms, he is forced with one bitter, inalienable truth.\n\nHe has failed.\n\nAs his health worsens more and more, the once-proud founder of the League finds himself desperate. The League spirals towards disaster, and yet none save Comrade Yazov heeds his words. Though discouraged, the General has not lost all hope. He has called a general assembly of the League, and will give one last impassioned speech, begging the men, women, and children that call Omsk home to look within and recognize the course of disaster the officers have put them on.\n\nAcross the League's lands, the General's voice will be broadcast his last order:\n\n"Be ready for the Trials ahead.""

 OMS_initial_lessons_of_the_first_trial: "Lessons of the First Trial"
 OMS_initial_lessons_of_the_first_trial_desc: "The First Trial ended as the Teuton burned our homes, tore through our defenses, slaughtered our soldiers, and bombed our cities to rubble. In the end, millions of Russians lay dead or enslaved. Many within Russia feebly wonder how this could have been; they wonder what terrible weapons or blessings the Germans had that gave them their victory. General Karbyshev and Comrade Yazov, however, know the truth.\n\nThe Germans accomplished this terrible victory through complete military supremacy, through both speed and power. As loath as we are to admit it, the old tactics are perhaps no longer applicable. It is time for a new way. If we are to defeat the Enemy, we must use his own strategy against him."

 OMS_initial_the_steel_heart_of_omsk: "The Steel Heart of Omsk"
 OMS_initial_the_steel_heart_of_omsk_desc: "While the current geographical situation is not ideal, Omsk does have one great strength that will give us the edge over our rivals in the region: industry. Factories pepper the landscape, and across Omsk workers labor to create as many weapons and defenses as possible. If Bukharin did one thing right, even in his ignorance, it was providing us with this tool of vengeance.\n\nYet this must be expanded on. The construction of new arms factories will begin effective immediately, and within a matter of months new weapons will begin to pour from Omsk's Steel Heart to the arms of our soldiers."

 OMS_initial_the_shield_of_the_motherland: "The Shield of the Motherland"
 OMS_initial_the_shield_of_the_motherland_desc: "We are the last hope of the Motherland, in the end. Under the Tsars, the Russian Worker labored endlessly as a near-slave, while the man on top reaped the benefits, providing nothing in return. The Bolsheviks, too, failed the people. Under Bukharin's undisciplined gaze, our military stagnated, and the Germans marched to annihilate us with near-impunity.\n\nNo more. From Omsk, a new order will sweep across the land, one dedicated solely to the protection and vengeance of Russia, and when we march forwards to retake Moscow, their generals, their scientists, even the Führer himself will quake in their boots. When finally they beg us for mercy as our boots rest on their necks, only then will the Last Trial be avenged."

 OMS_initial_remember_the_oath: "Remember the Oath"
 OMS_initial_remember_the_oath_desc: "Every member of the Black League knows the words of the oath by heart.\n\n"I believe, before all else, in Russia, one, indivisible and invincible.\n\nI believe in my own strength, and the strength of my comrades.\n\nI reject the lies of the First Trial and embrace the Black League as Russia's one and only salvation in the coming Trial.\n\nWhen the day of the §RGreat Trial§! comes, I will stand shoulder to shoulder with my comrades, I will face the enemy without fear, and I will put my nation before my own life.\n\nI will be the sword and shield of Russia, by which justice will be done for the fallen.\n\nI swear this oath by my sacred Motherland.""

 OMS_initial_falling_snow: "Falling Snow"
 OMS_initial_falling_snow_desc: "In the end, the monster General Karbyshev created has grown out of control. Even as the life fades from his body, the officers circle like vultures, ready to pounce and tear the League's bloated corpse limb from limb. The General sees the §RGreat Trial§! approaching closer and closer by the day, and yet he knows now he will not be the one to face it.\n\nBut perhaps there is one who can. General Karbyshev will thus perform one last act in the service of the Motherland, knowing that Comrade Yazov, with his youthful drive and determination, will complete the General's mission.\n\nIt's time to take a stroll."

 ### Initial Gauntlet tree ###

 OMS_into_the_gauntlet: "Into the Gauntlet"
 OMS_into_the_gauntlet_desc: "Dmitry Karbyshev is dead, and in his last days he witnessed his vision corrupted into a mockery of what he intended. He died believing he had failed, and that those who he had thought were his allies were traitors to his vision - all but one. His last act of empowering Dmitry Yazov as his successor was the last shot of a dying man to salvage what the Black League has become.\n\nIt will not be easy, but Yazov must do what Karbyshev could not. The corrupt officer cliques and traitors to the League will now be dealt with, and the vision of its founder brought to fruition. Yazov will see that Karbyshev's legacy is preserved, and finish his work. He faces a Gauntlet, and he will be opposed by the old guard of the League - but he will deal with them all the same.\n\nThe §RGreat Trial§! demands nothing less."

 OMS_blocbybloc_clearings: "Block-by-Block Clearings"
 OMS_blocbybloc_clearings_desc: "In a city there are a thousand places to hide, and just as many means to escape. Our enemies know this, and will take advantage of this environment to hide and disappear, believing we are unable to pursue them. While such urban operations are difficult, time-consuming, and dangerous - we are undeterred, and will do everything necessary to hunt these traitors down.\n\nStreet to street, house to house, door to door, we will methodically clear each one and every one of threats. We will create a noose around each city, one ever-tightening as we flush the rats from their holes, and drive them into our traps. When we are finished, the traitors who would defy Glavkoverkh Yazov and the Black League will be dealt a blow from which they shall not recover."

 OMS_consumed_by_the_earth: "Consumed by the Earth"
 OMS_consumed_by_the_earth_desc: "Within Omsk there are many underground safe houses, empty basements, and secret passages that are used and exploited by criminals and traitors alike. Places where disloyal officers would quietly plot, scheme to hold onto their power, or hide from the laws that they have broken. Fortunately, Yazov knows many of these hideaways, and plans an insidious means of exploiting this knowledge.\n\nWhile other operations are commencing, loyal soldiers of the Black League will infiltrate these underground structures and passages, and wait for the traitors as they flee there, intending to hide. And when they open the doors, expecting safety, they will be met with the barrels of guns.\n\nThe important ones will be arrested. For the rest, the underground will be their tomb."

 OMS_the_asphalt_arteries_cut: "The Asphalt Arteries Cut"
 OMS_the_asphalt_arteries_cut_desc: "No competent officer would find himself caught without a contingency. These traitors to the Black League are outnumbered and illegitimate, but they are not stupid. As we move against them, many will attempt to flee, rather than fight.\n\nWe cannot predict where each of them will go, but we possess a critical advantage - Glavkoverkh Yazov. While the officers have their own escape routes, and contingency plans, they have never been forced to implement them. More importantly, their plans are uncreative and predictable.\n\nWe will establish patrols of uniformed and plain-clothes agents throughout the city to interdict fleeing or retreating officers, and offer rewards for information from the citizenry. Soon, there will be no place for them to run without the Black League in close pursuit."

 OMS_minimize_future_liabilities: "Minimize Future Liabilities"
 OMS_minimize_future_liabilities_desc: "As satisfying and simple as it would be to bring our full might to bear against these traitors to the Black League, we must exercise restraint as we remove them. A full-scale war incurs costs and damages we are not prepared to endure, especially as future wars loom on the horizon.\n\nFurthermore, too much violence, too quickly could delegitimize us to the people. Our legitimacy is our most powerful asset, and if we are perceived as equivalent to the bandits appropriating the name of the Black League, we have failed our mission.\n\nInstead we must temper our fury, and channel it into methodical violence - one that is swift, lethal, focused - and with limited collateral."

 OMS_a_natural_fortress_inside_out: "A Natural Fortress Inside Out"
 OMS_a_natural_fortress_inside_out_desc: "The experience we have gained as we deal with the traitors has granted us unprecedented insight and knowledge into the nature of urban warfare, both in how to conduct it - and how to protect against it.\n\nToday, we are on the offensive. Tomorrow, it may be our enemies who seek to capture our cities, and we must ensure that it is impossible for our tactics to be replicated against us. When Omsk is fully secure, we will turn this city into a fortress that cannot be breached, and one that promises nothing but death around every corner for the enemy.\n\nOmsk belongs only to the Black League - now and forever."

 OMS_one_thousand_entrances_laid_open: "One Thousand Entrances Laid Open"
 OMS_one_thousand_entrances_laid_open_desc: "Under Glavkoverkh Yazov, we have insight into the tactics and thought processes of the traitorous officers - and at the same time, they similarly have insight into our own actions. They will not succeed, but their knowledge will buy precious time, and hinder the overall success of our operation.\n\nTo counter this, the Black League must adapt, and to this end, Glavkoverkh Yazov has granted tactical autonomy for individual units of the Black League in conducting operations. While this reduces the coordination of our military, relying on the ingenuity of our officers opens up many possibilities.\n\nThese traitors are stuck in the mindsets of old. It is time for new, creative thinking - something they will never see coming."

 OMS_unified_movement_planning: "Unified Movement Planning"
 OMS_unified_movement_planning_desc: "We know who the enemy is, where they hide, and what they plan. While they can similarly predict our actions, we possess the initiative, manpower, equipment, and legitimacy. These traitors are reduced to mere insurgents, and have ceded every advantage to us.\n\nAdvantages we will fully exploit.\n\nThe Black League has trained for complex operations, and we will employ this capability as we move with calculated precision against them. Our operations will be carefully planned, thoroughly methodical, and lethal in execution.\n\nWhen we strike, it will be as one unified body, it will be without mercy - and it will be on our terms."

 OMS_establish_widearea_control: "Establish Wide-Area Control"
 OMS_establish_widearea_control_desc: "For the majority of the League's existence, it has been focused on Omsk, and the few cities under our control. The rural regions, while under our control and ostensive protection, were in practice left to their own devices. Unfortunately, this approach has blinded us beyond the cities except for a few agents, and allowed for our enemies to hide throughout our territory.\n\nThis oversight will be immediately corrected.\n\nNo more will the rural regions be left alone or forgotten. No more will they live without protection and oversight, and no more will they serve as havens for traitors and criminals. This is our territory, and it is far past time that every square meter be secured for the Black League."

 OMS_all_eyes_on_them: "All Eyes on Them"
 OMS_all_eyes_on_them_desc: "The traitors flee Omsk and the cities like rats, with experienced officers employing their own contingencies for such scenarios where their comfortable lives were threatened. These officers flee, some to other warlords and statelets, and others to hide in rural regions among sympathizers. The common threat? They flee to places they know our reach is limited.\n\nOr so they think.\n\nThe reach of the Black League is longer than they knew, and we have agents stationed throughout the region who watch and report to us. We will instruct them to look for traitors to the League, and other suspicious visitors. Justice for these traitors may be delayed - but our agents will ensure that it is inevitable."

 OMS_exploit_humanly_instincts: "Exploit Humanly Instincts"
 OMS_exploit_humanly_instincts_desc: "Solidarity and brotherhood only goes so far - especially when based on weak foundations. It is easy to form cliques when times are good and safe - but when times grow tough, such solidarity fades, and men expose themselves as frauds, and without any existing value or principle to anchor them, will only seek survival.\n\nWe have ways of breaking them.\n\nSome merely want to live. We can arrange that. Some only wish payment. We can facilitate that. We know their homes. We know their secrets. We know their families. We possess the tools to break apart the cliques, play to their weaknesses, force their compliance, and turn them against each other.\n\nAll that is required is the will to carry it out."

 OMS_internal_rot_consuming_all: "Internal Rot Consuming All"
 OMS_internal_rot_consuming_all_desc: "The weakness of these traitorous officers is that they believe in nothing. They serve no ideology, they believe no cause, and they hold no principles - only selfishness and survival drive them. This corruption, disgusting and pathetic it may be, is useful to us - and presents several avenues through which to exploit it, and destroy these cliques once and for all.\n\nWe will target the allies of these traitors, moorless soldiers and young officers, and sway them to our side. From them we will grow a network of double-agents within the heart of this insurgency. We will need to be careful in this process, but should we succeed, not only will the traitors be purged and the cliques broken - but we will give these agents something that had been denied to them.\n\nPurpose."

 OMS_chaos_and_disarray: "Chaos and Disarray"
 OMS_chaos_and_disarray_desc: "While not as common as they once were, bombings remain a fact of life within Russia, one that has created a very predictable and useful pattern we can exploit among citizens and soldiers alike. When the air raid sirens sound, everyone immediately rushes to nearby shelters, as to be outside is to risk death via bomb. We will use this to our advantage.\n\nWe control the sirens, and can prepare operations around them being sounded. If there are no bombings coming, we will create the illusion and use the chaos and disorganization to easily find and eliminate our enemies. This tactic may only be successful for a short time before they catch on - but that is all the time we will need."

 OMS_repair_what_was_broken: "Repair What Was Broken"
 OMS_repair_what_was_broken_desc: "At last, this insurgency is crushed, and Glavkoverkh Yazov stands as the undisputed commander of the Black League. The officer cliques have been shattered, and while remnants and stragglers have fled, they are not in substantial enough numbers to pose a threat to us - for now, at least.\n\nNow, the Black League turns to the task of fulfilling Karbyshev's vision, and truly readying Russia for the §RGreat Trial§!. First though, we require resources, manpower, and infrastructure to prepare the Black League for the wars to come. There remains many dilapidated buildings, critical infrastructure, and railways throughout our territory whose restoration would greatly benefit us in this task.\n\nAs such, that is where we will start."

 OMS_arm_the_auxiliaries_desc: "Old, malfunctioning rifles, jury-rigged machine guns, and poor rations are a common sight on the front lines of the Redemptionary Brigades. Because of the, frankly, abysmal condition of their equipment, the brigades simply cannot fight as well as they might if given better weapons. General Yazov has thus ordered that the Brigades receive any surplus equipment, quality weapons, and better rations.\n\nThough they will never be as well equipped as a Soldier of the League, the Redemptionary Brigadier will nevertheless be equipped to withstand the coming horrors."

 OMS_fortress_omsk: "Fortress Omsk"
 OMS_fortress_omsk_desc: "If we are to survive the battles ahead, Omsk must become a fortress city the likes of which the world has never seen. The bunkers underfoot, already a great boon when the bombings fly overhead, will be expanded to fit even more citizens, and the border forts that protect us against the forces of Kaganovich will become ever more impenetrable.\n\nWhen the work is done, the entirety of the German Army could throw itself upon our walls, but they will not fall, no, the Germans would only meet death."

They offer lies to the people, be they reclaiming a past glory, or simply keeping rule by force. They are incapable of unifying Russia - only the Black League possesses this vision, and the will to execute it.\n\nYet before this, we must prepare.

One where administrators were given roles out of nepotism or shuffled away as political punishment. This inefficient, wasteful, and incompetent system will be abolished, and a new one built in its place.\n\nRegions will now be determined through a methodology that takes into account the population size, industrial capacity, local terrain, and resource potential of an area.

Both undermine the state. Both threaten its control. Both pose risks.\n\nRisks cannot be taken. Weaknesses cannot be tolerated. Leniency cannot be given.\n\nOne weak link can spell our defeat, and so we must be continually vigilant. We must watch all - merchants, parents, teachers, and even our soldiers.

Through their opposition, they have revealed themselves as our enemies.\n\nTheir meetings will be discovered and silenced. Their rallies will be crushed. Their sympathizers in our ranks purged.

There are political enemies as well, who cling to forbidden and failed ideologies, who can yet learn a better path.

We will push not just their physical limits, but their mental ones as we expose them to what the Germans will do to our people if they fail. Their discipline will be iron, as they are taught the skills of sabotage, assassination, and biological warfare.\n\nThese efforts will ensure that when the order is given to march into the German hell, they will do so without fear, and execute orders without hesitation as Russia is finally avenged."

The Black League has been without a true air force for too long, and Glavkoverkh Yazov has ordered that a dedicated air force be established to rectify this.\n\nThis new air force will possess the best planes the League can provide. The pilots will be drilled daily, training ranges will be established for practice runs, and recruitment programs will be created to ensure a steady supply of pilots.

Never again can this rot be allowed to fester.\n\nFrom now on, every single officer will be watched. No more will promotions be given as favors or bribery, but through strict merit and loyalty.

We will show them them the razed cities and piles of corpses, we will reveal the systemic genocide of Russians, and we will show them the crowds of Germans, united in their ideology of evil.\n\nWe will sear each atrocity of Germany into the minds of our citizens until they realize that only a united people can stand against this foe.

Despite coming from a single state, with a nation many believed on its deathbed, the Black League has shown that it possesses the will and capability to unite Russia.\n\nFor now, our authority is unchallenged, even as foes to our east and west rise. Our work is far from over, and it now falls to Glavkoverkh Yazov to determine the next steps the Black League will take.

This is only the beginning, however. While we may have accomplished a nominal hold on the territories once held by our immediate enemies, they are far from secure. It's time that we start solidifying our conquests and quashing any remaining dissent towards our administration, and by extension, our vision.\n\nThe Glavkoverkh has demanded that our armed forces begin extending our system throughout our new territories, and they shall do just that. This will be a new test for us: to ensure that our message is received by the masses outside of Omsk and its environs."

For now, we must find willing collaborators, ideological allies or opportunists, and quash those who are unwilling to accept our victory. As we learned from the Gauntlet, sometimes our greatest enemies are within; never again will we let those within our territory work against our vision, and as such, we cannot let any internal dissent simmer into a great fire of rebellion."

Their useless luxuries and distractions will not help us prepare for the §RGreat Trial§! - they do the exact opposite, softening our people to the realities of what must be done. The Black League and her operatives have been ordered to perform a mass "confiscate-and-repurpose" program, hunting down and confiscating anything that is not considered utilitarian in nature.

The Glavkoverkh has already prepared a detailed list of names for us to implement in these areas. Regional commissariats, similar to what we had when we ruled just Omsk and its hinterlands, will be appointed to these areas to begin extending the administrative side of our rule.\n\nOf course, many measures have been put in place to avoid the mistakes that led to the Gauntlet. Each potential regional commissar will be vetted extremely thoroughly for ideological purity, potential connections to undesirable sectors of society, and their effectiveness in governing the territories that they've captured.

Everything from guns to rations needs to be in vast supply; we will not be caught unprepared again. We shall prepare Russia to be ready for war at any moment.\n\nWe shall complete this preparation by creating a highly militarized society in which military production is prioritized, our people live highly regimented lives in organized units dedicated to specific tasks.

However, it was a turning point in our history. It solidified the power of our Glavkoverkh, Dmitry Yazov, and allowed us to refine our vision and ideals going forward.\n\nHowever, the Gauntlet also taught us many things about how our political structure should be built. Regional commissariats akin to the ones that we had when we were based only in Omsk will be retained, but those who will be put in charge of those commissariats will be vetted extremely thoroughly. They will be tested for loyalty, ideological purity, and their propensity towards corruption. If they fail any of these three tests - not only will they be rejected for the position, but their current station will be investigated as well.

The size of our army will swell, but this is a double-edged sword. Many of our new recruits are unfamiliar with our doctrine at best, and absolutely opposed to it at worst. The military is the apparatus with which we will orchestrate our mission, and thus, we cannot afford to have those disingenuous or uninvested in our cause being a part of it.\n\nWe will form the Committee of Internal Investigation, which will be used to probe out any "problems" within the military's ranks, from top to bottom. Not only will it sniff out and expose internal threats, but it will also encourage, officially or otherwise, behavior from all tiers of our armed forces to come forward and bring to our attention these threats."

These "freedom fighters" are little more than bandit rabble - no better than those who steal from their own people.\n\nThe defeat of these bandits are paramount to the extension of our authority throughout the rest of Western Siberia. Luckily, our soldiers already have a sizable amount of experience in counter-insurgency operations. The Glavkoverkh and our high command has already put a proposal together to ensure that we finish Batov and his followers quickly and efficiently.

They hide in the hills, mountains, and forests outside of the cities. Their raiders seem to act like a wave, attacking and then melting away the second they're threatened.\n\nIf we can't beat them on the field, we need to beat them where we can - from within. Our League already has significant experience in infiltrating closed-off organizations from when we fought with Kaganovich's farcical state and the military remnant in Sverdlovsk.

The rebels have moved Westwards, into a natural curtain of rock, metal, and crag: the Urals. This is, of course, only a temporary frustration. Our troops, organized and well-trained, will be able to flush them out eventually.\n\nThe Glavkoverkh has demanded that the Black League's high command present to him a path forward to deal with Batov - and they have. The first phase is the infiltration of the rebels, and the second is the location and isolation of their mountain hideouts - scattered throughout the Urals, they seem to have a makeshift line of communication. Cutting them off from one another and besieging each hideout in the mountains that they thought would save them will ensure an eventual victory."

Secondly, we must begin a national reconstruction, to set our movement up as a true rival to the Teuton and other Russian states who refuse to see the truth. Thirdly, we need to perform a national purification: to systematically separate the wheat from the chaff, and discard from our ranks and society the nonbelievers and troublemakers. Fourthly, we must begin a program of national reclamation, to exert our authority over all of Russia.\n\nFifth and finally, we must begin national vengeance.

The Black League has stamped out the fiefdoms of the traitors and cowards and reclaimed the region, but with those victories only mark the beginning of a different kind of struggle. Western Siberia must be rebuilt and its industry expanded to meet the League's needs. The research and academic centers under our control will need to be improved and centralized if Russia is to have any hope of escaping from the dark age it was thrown into.\n\nThe Glavkoverkh has ordered the creation of the State Development Directorate, a new branch of the central government that will be responsible for both of these tasks. The League will reclaim and retool the factories of Siberia to produce weapons and supplies for the combat cadres. The scientific and educational institutions of our nation shall be brought into the modern day. Weakness and decay have ruled Russia for too long. It is time to start building again."

 OMS_a_new_sibplan: "A New SibPlan"
 OMS_a_new_sibplan_desc: "Bukharin's Soviet Union was a weak nation that failed to defend Russia, but it did produce some good ideas in its short existence. One of these was the Siberian Plan, SibPlan for short, an ambitious program to industrialize Siberia both to enrich the impoverished east of Russia and to create an industrial base far from any invaders. Unfortunately, most of the development took place east of our current territory, while projects in western Siberia floundered.\n\nDirector of State Development Evgeny Pitovranov has drafted a new SibPlan, one which takes into account both our limited resources and our new goals. The industry of the Trans-Ural region will be fully centralized under the state and expanded to meet the needs of the Black League. Industrial projects will be focused on aiding the military and preparing our new economy for the §RGreat Trial§!. Everything from aircraft production to fuel distribution will be optimized and perfected. There can be no wasted resources, no gaps of inefficiency within our industry. The Black League's goal is nothing less than Russia's salvation, and we must remake the economy to serve that goal alone."

 OMS_total_industrial_nationalization: "Total Industrial Nationalization"
 OMS_total_industrial_nationalization_desc: "The Black League has already assumed control of vital industries like weaponry production and infrastructure construction to make sure they serve the needs of the state, but other industries, as well as local businesses continue to work independently of our government. We will put an end to this.\n\nWe cannot tolerate any industry outside of our control. Left to their own devices, industrialists prefer to cater to decadent consumers, producing unnecessary luxuries that will be of no use to us. We must seize their factories and their workshops so that they can begin producing the items that we will need in our coming struggles. We will allow owners who are compliant to remain as supervisors of their factories. Their experience will be of much use to us. Those who choose not to do their patriotic duty will of course be dealt with as deemed necessary. Their industry is necessary to our success.\n\nThey are not."

 OMS_militarized_railway_system: "Militarized Railway System"
 OMS_militarized_railway_system_desc: "Moving troops and supplies around our vast nation requires an extensive network of railways. Luckily, western Siberia has a comprehensive rail system that was maintained even through the German bombings. Unfortunately, it is often clogged and trains are often delayed for hours or even days. It is not uncommon for many trains to be vying for space on the tracks, and certain routes are becoming infamous for the backlogs they involve. This cannot be allowed to continue. We will give the military the responsibility to schedule our nation's trains. This will greatly increase the speed of transporting men and equipment to where we need them, at the expense of our civilian population's needs. For the moment, this is a sacrifice we must make. The military of the Black League is the vanguard of the new Russia, and our only chance for salvation. Everything must serve them, for only they can deliver the justice and salvation we need."

 OMS_optimize_agricultural_output: "Optimize Agricultural Output"
 OMS_optimize_agricultural_output_desc: "Despite our intense focus on industrializing our nation, millions of our people do not work in industrial fields. We cannot forget the Russians who grow our food, who raise our beasts of burden and form the bedrock that modern society is built upon. While we are bringing the nation's factories into the modern age, we must do the same for its farms. Large private farms concentrate too much power in an owner's hands, while small family farms are inefficient. Both must be abolished, and replaced with a new system of state-owned work sites, where agricultural cadres can grow the crops and raise the livestock that will feed their fellow Russians. State ownership will also make it easier to implement the new technologies and techniques that define modern agriculture. Gone are the days of wheelbarrows and hand tools. It is time our farms met tractors and chemical fertilizers."

 OMS_expand_the_industrial_cadres: "Expand the Industrial Cadres"
 OMS_expand_the_industrial_cadres_desc: "The Black League is no longer confined to a single city and its surroundings. We now control a huge swath of territory and the people that live on it. As a natural result of our expansion, the population of our state has increased almost tenfold in mere months. This influx of new people has put a severe strain on our society, especially the system of cadres. Millions of our new citizens await assignment to a cadre that will decide how they will serve Russia and the League, but until they are assigned, they exist in a sort of limbo, uncertain of what to do or what comes next. Minister Pitovranov has recommended that we prioritize assigning these new workers to the industrial cadres, at least in the short-term. With the massive expansion of our industrial base, many of the existing cadres have been stretched thin and are working overtime to keep the factories running. An influx of fresh workers into the sector would both increase our productivity and greatly reduce the number of cadre-less citizens. If their labor could be more useful somewhere else in the future there is nothing stopping the League from simply reassigning them."

 OMS_better_tools: "Better Tools"
 OMS_better_tools_desc: "Modern industry is a complicated matter. It requires more than lots of workers on an assembly line to build an armored infantry vehicle or a jet plane. It requires advanced machinery and tools, both rarities throughout Russia. Though we managed to create some of these machines on our own and captured a few more in our reclamation of western Siberia, it is not enough to meet our needs.\n\nOur engineers are in the process of reverse engineering the simpler examples of these tools, such as handheld welding torches and powered drills, so we can begin producing them domestically. Other items like robotic assembly arms and automated assembly lines will need to be imported for now as they are too complex for us to produce, but once we have the industry to support them these too will be disassembled and examined. Soon Russia will have a thriving, modern industrial base and we will not be reliant on outsiders to sell our tools to us. For decades Russia failed to modernize its industry, and our enemies took advantage of that. They will not find us so unprepared."

Without much preparation they can become concrete mazes that an attacker must clear block by block to secure. The cities of the Black League are no different, but our generals see room for improvement.\n\nBy rebuilding destroyed urban centers along strict, carefully planned guidelines, the cities can be made vastly more efficient in many areas. Shopping districts can be remade into housing projects, churches into command centers, city squares into labor yards.\n\nBy reorganizing the urban landscapes of our state we can also turn the cities into massive fortresses. Narrow streets will make moving through the city difficult, and can be easily transformed into chokepoints at a moment's notice. Each city will have a detailed plan outlining several layers of prepared defences. Should the League come under attack, the invaders will regret the day they decided to fight on our terms."

 OMS_foundries_of_war: "Foundries of War"
 OMS_foundries_of_war_desc: "In matters of war, there is no such thing as over preparation. Our armies spent years fighting tooth and nail, often making do without even the most basic supplies. This struggle has strengthened the soldiers of the League, but it will take more than a good fighting spirit to destroy the Germans. It will take guns. Millions of them. It will take tanks, and planes, and bombs and missiles and radios and shovels and countless other items that an army needs to fight a modern war. We cannot grow complacent in the militarization of our industry. Even as more factories are opened and our economy starts to develop, we must remember that it is not enough.\n\nAcross our territory more land will be cleared. New foundries and plants will be opened, producing anything and everything that might be of use in the battles ahead. The factories will run all hours of the day, never ceasing production for even a second. Weapon depots will be filled, and backup depots, and emergency backup depots, because there is no such thing as over preparation."

 OMS_the_resource_consolidation_commission: "The Resource Consolidation Commission"
 OMS_the_resource_consolidation_commission_desc: "Siberia is thought of by many as a barren land devoid of life or value. There is no denying that much of Siberia is sparsely populated, but only the uninformed and the foolish could say this land is worthless. Siberia is filled with valuable resources that can be of great use to any who can claim them. From oil to iron, there are bounties of materials that could aid our mission literally beneath our feet, all we need to do is take them. Unfortunately, that is where the difficulties arise.\n\nThe various warlords who once controlled these resources were not exactly efficient in charting or extracting them, and things have not improved since we took charge. To amend this situation, Pitovranov has recommended we create a subdivision of the State Development Directorate, the Resource Consolidation Commission. This Commission would be charged with centralizing and streamlining resource harvesting within our state. Under their watch the oil will flow consistently, the steel mills will meet their quotas, and no more resource deposits will linger in the earth unexploited."

 OMS_research_and_development_initiatives_desc: "Once, Russia was a center of innovation and scientific discovery. The Germans took that from us when they invaded, killing so many of our brightest minds and stealing our centers of innovation. The rest of the world has raced on into the 20th century, leaving Russia fighting to catch up. The scientists and engineers of the Black League have struggled mightily but they have had to work with outdated equipment, limited resources, and insufficient funding. This stops now. Russia's reclamation, and the §RGreat Trial§! that lies beyond that, cannot be won if we have to fight them with the weapons of the First Trial.\n\nThe League will immediately devote more funding to expanding and modernizing the research facilities we control. Scientific personal and resources that we acquired during the first phase of the reclamation will be reorganized into new research teams with designated goals. Everything from chemical fertilizers to construction materials will be developed. Of course, the focus will be on new, modern weapons for the brave soldiers of the League."

 OMS_project_kamera: "Project KAMERA"
 OMS_project_kamera_desc: "Our increased investment in research initiatives is already bearing fruit. The Sverdlovsk design bureau has quickly become a center of military innovation and experimentation, producing new prototypes of every type of equipment from bullet casings to tanks. The experimentation has not been restricted to conventional, or even legal weapons either. Deep within the bureau's most secure laboratories, the weapons that will guarantee our triumph in the §RGreat Trial§! are being tested. Mustard gas, ricin, cyanide, and other chemical agents are being developed by our scientists for use both on and off the battlefield.\n\nProject KAMERA, the creation of our chemical weapons stockpile, is highly classified. Only a select few in the Black League know of its existence. If the outside world discovered the weapons, or the plans for their use, they would condemn us as monsters. We have no time for their hypocritical moralizing. All that matters is avenging the motherland, and we will use every tool available to make sure justice is done."

 OMS_the_black_budget_desc: "We must do whatever we can to close the technology gap between our state and the rest of the world. A final struggle is drawing near and a technological advantage could prove decisive. Our scientists will have all the funds they could ever ask for. Every resource will be granted at their request. The fate of the nation is on the line. We cannot afford to lose Russia again over something as trivial as research constraints. The scientists of the Black League will have no restrictions on their research either material, or ethical. We will allow anything if it has a chance of strengthening our cause.\n\nTo keep track of resource requests and consumption during testing and experimentation, a separate, confidential budget will have to be created. This "Black Budget" will function as a log of items we have diverted from other areas to priority research. This will include weapons requiring stress testing, tanks with flawed armor designs, even prisoners who would otherwise join the redemptory brigades, that will instead be earning their redemption as test subjects. The scientists will have everything we can offer them. The budget will make sure they do not waste it."

The bombings robbed them of their childhood, and the destruction of Russia robbed them of their future. They have nothing left to look forward to but the possibility of revenge on those who have taken everything from them. The Glavkoverkh himself has taken a special concern for the children of the League. He sees the potential within them, the potential to become the next generation of Russian leaders and soldiers. He will not allow this potential to be wasted.\n\nA new nationwide education system is being planned, centered around a curriculum designed to prepare children as young as five to serve the league in any capacity they can. This will not be an education of useless academics, but of practical skill. Children will learn how to work in their parent's cadres. They will learn that if called upon, they must be able to fight and willing to die for Russian and the League. We expect no more from them than we do from any other citizen."

 OMS_national_redoubt_program_desc: "A reality haunts the Black League's government. Those who know the most of the preparation for the §RGreat Trial§! know that it will likely not be a war of reclamation, but a final act of vengeance. The German enemy has more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world, and there is little question that they would rather drag earth to hell with them than let us bring justice without retribution. If Russia and the League are to have any hope of survival, we must be ready for this last cowardly act of self-destruction.\n\nAcross the nation we will build a system of bunkers and shelters based on the designs of those in Omsk. Pre-existing fortification complexes and metro systems will be reinforced and stocked with supplies to serve as emergency shelters. New, purpose-built shelters will be built in the largest cities of the nation, designed to hold as many people as possible. If the day comes when the enemy decides they would rather destroy the world than face the consequences of their choices, the Black League will shelter in the earth. When the fires have burned out we will emerge, and teach them that they cannot escape so easily."

For Russia to survive new bunkers must be built. Bigger and deeper. Many will be built outside of the cities so they're not subject to a direct strike.

On the long, winding road to Berlin, our forces will have to storm through nuclear explosions and clouds of biological and chemical agents never before fired in anger.\n\nTo that end, these weapons must be harnessed for use by the League, for their destructive potential is unmatched by any other ordinance created by man. Nuclear, biological and chemical weapons are the new reality of war in the modern age, and this must be accounted for in any plan for the §RGreat Trial§!.\n\nAlready, work on these tools of war has begun.

Out of the Sverdlovsk laboratories come reports of new strains of anthrax, capable of being packed into the smallest shell or bomb that can rain down on Germany in the hundreds from our artillery or aircraft.\n\nThis is not enough for the purposes of the §RGreat Trial§!.

Rumors have emerged from the wastes of eastern Siberia, of pretender warlords attempting their own petty imitations of the very ideology that consigned Russia to ruin. Even if such subhuman filth may claim Russian nationality by blood, their actions prove that they are little better than the Hitlerites to our west, and deserve to face the full might of our arsenal."

However, before the League can take the fight to their so-called eternal city, Germania, there is one aspect for which we have no answer.\n\n§RThe atom bomb.§!\n\nFor our mission to succeed, the League needs to ensure the inevitability of Mutually Assured Destruction.

Agents that can defoliate entire forests - if the formula is correct. As with all the League's efforts towards vengeance, all of Ovchinnikov's work is in progress. Perhaps there might be a way to accelerate it.\n\nThe League shall provide test subjects as materials for feedback of the potency of the chemical agents.

However, the completion of a proper warhead is years away, a sad fact that even the Glavkoverkh recognizes.\n\nHowever, not all roads to power have to be pure. A dirty solution would suffice if the cleaner methods would not do. In this case: the dirty bomb. Nuclear scientists might call it a hack-job, engineers might call it sloppy.

Over the course of the coming conflict, Russians will fight amongst the ruins of their own towns, homes and churches, giving many places a solemn legacy that none will ever forget. Moscow, Petrograd, Samara, Nizhny Novgorod and a thousand other locations with old Russian names will be rebirthed in a baptism of atomic fire.\n\nYet, the Russian nation will endure.

The leadership is secure in Black Mountain, but these soldiers need protection against the atomic retaliations of the Germans. The Glavkoverkh needs to shelter these soldiers through the harshness of the Fourth Thesis.\n\nWhen the time of burning comes, we shall give the Army the ultimate honor. Once the dust settles over quiet earth, and Russia is avenged, they shall climb out of their underground complexes.

 omsk.2.t: "Preparing for the End"
 omsk.2.desc: "It was one thing, thought the old general, to dread the failure of your greatest aspirations. To know the quiet burning of doubt in your gut. But it was quite another thing to look the twisted remnants of your dreams in the eye every day. To be constantly greeted by people, tripping over each other to obsequiously praise the vision and beauty of your own worst nightmare.\n\nGeneral Dmitry Mikhailovich Karbyshev, Glavkoverkh of the Black League, had clung to life on this earth for eighty-two years now, and he had certainly seen worse. He had lost friends to frostbite, wolves, and concentration camp guards on the three thousand-kilometer overland trek back from Nazi captivity in Mauthausen that had made him a living legend among Russians. He was a man who could bear torture, both phyiscal and emotional. But he could feel what was coming. It was plain for him to see. He saw it in the eyes of every fresh-faced Youth Cadre recruit, in every projection of the next five years' industrial production. There it was, a simple fact, shining like the sun in every geopolitical analysis of the coming Trial, in every snippet of hopeful speculation on the future.\n\nKarbyshev's watch was coming to its end.\n\nThe thought of death, a final rest from all his earthly toil, did not faze him. But, when he looked at the nightmare around him, he felt a panicky, hot-headed sense of urgency. His beloved League had grown corrupt and cruel, ruled by officer cliques and cronyism while innocents labored away in the Redemptionary Brigades. As painful as it would be, he had to try one last time. He had to address his sin, his unfinished work on this cursed planet, before the long night claimed him."

He had flown missions over Omsk dozens, if not hundreds of times - which was a feat in and of itself, considering his 264 was older than he was and handled like a brick - but his recklessness had finally caught up with him. All it took was two good hits and the left wing was sheared clean off the side of the fuselage and the plane started tumbling downard. He could barely hear his own screams over the thunder of anti-aircraft fire. He blacked out before he hit the ground, the wastes of Russia reaching up to claim him.\n\nMartin awoke face-to-face with his copilot, Johan. His face was caved in. Martin screamed and sat up. His eyes widened. The Me 264 was a fiery wreck in front of him. Hellish red and white flames licked at tangled spires of metal. Heat rolled against his skin. Next to him, his crew was laid out on the ground, their corpses mangled from the crash. A small crowd was assembled in front of the wreck, silhouetted against the flames. Some of them turned their heads in his direction. His breath hitched.\n\nHe scrambled to his feet and tried to run, but intense pain blossomed in his knee and he cried out, falling back to the ground. They were coming. "Wait, wait!" he said and turned onto his back. Three of the silhouettes rushed towards him. Their bayonets gleamed with murderous intent. He pulled himself backwards with his arms, palming fistfulls of dirt and throwing it at them. "Wait, stop, stop! Please!" One of the silhouettes - no, a man in a black uniform - brought his boot down on Martin's face. He heard a crunch and nothing more."

Could he not even get junior officers to follow his orders any more? Some cadres had refused to drill twice a day, while others drilled twice but only for half as long as they normally would each time. His order that meal times be shortened seemed to have been ignored entirely. No one was being punished for their disobedience, because the people responsible for carrying out the punishments were just as non-compliant as all the rest. He had held back on ordering harsh treatment for so long because he wanted to believe that the members of the League would realize the error of their ways on their own. He now saw just how naive he had been. The League was further gone than he had dared imagine. Deep inside of himself, a small voice questioned if it was still worth the effort.\n\nHe crushed that voice, as he had done so many times in the past. He had made his choice years ago when he created the League, and he was too far along to start doubting himself now. The League had wandered off course, and he would spend whatever time he had left trying to get it back on track. His legacy depended on it. Russia depended on it. He could not abandon his nation, not when so many people already had. He believed, before all else, in Russia. One, indivisible, invincible. So long as he lived there would remain at least one member of the League who stayed true to its principles. They were all he had left."

The scores of soot-stained men who stood behind him, work boots half-buried in a mixture of snowmelt and mud. They crowded around Karbyshev and his meager retinue of bodyguards, eyeing the old soldier with wariness and an indescribable emotion that felt almost like hunger.\n\n"I'm not here to punish you," Karbyshev said as loud as he dared. "I want to give you a chance at redemption." A voice piped up from the crowd.\n\n"The last time we were offered 'redemption' by you lot, fifteen men died in a cave-in. Starting to seem like there's not a whole lot of difference 'tween the two." The foreman's face turned bleach-white, his hands reflexively clenching. But he had braced himself for a punishment that never came.\n\n"Real redemption," Karbyshev answered. "Not the same old lie you've been getting from the officers. Actual freedom." The crowd collectively murmured. "Whatever you did to get here, it'll be wiped away, and you'll be equal with us. A lot of you never even did anything worth getting here. We're going to change the system. But I need your help.""

That the children of soldiers lived in elaborate air raid shelters beneath the ground, and dined on army rations and canned meat packaged when Bukharin still ruled Russia. For a free man, or even one fortunate enough to be born and raised in one of the few countries on the globe that could count itself as being at least somewhat free and stable, such a proposition would seem hellish. But for a man who had seen his childhood home torched by two different German armies, his friends and neighbors bayoneted by bandits, and who held onto his two grandchildren as his last worldly possession of any import, such a deal did not seem so bad. It was true, he reasoned, that tyranny was odious.\n\nBut in his painful life which had seen the rise and fall of no less than three different Russias, he had known tyranny's cold hand in many forms. He had learned to accept it, and live alongside it, regarding it as simply a shadow in the corner - a thing to be acknowledged and worked around, and little else. And so as Fyodor's refugee caravan approached the checkpoint at the purported border of Omsk's Black League, wind whipping at the ragged coat he had stretched over himself and his grandchildren, he felt only security and a sense of relief when black-uniformed men with guns approached them. His journey across his broken homeland had taken him through countless governments and their hollow promises. Time and time again their lies had nearly taken away from him all that he cared for. But here was a government which promised only one thing - survival.\n\nAnd that was good enough for him."

 omsk.7.desc: "They came just after sunset, the dry wind carrying their shouts and the clatter of hooves. Half of them didn't even know the name of the town. But that wasn't the point - they were there for plunder, pure and simple.\n\nSuch a barbaric event would be unthinkable in the League's core, around Omsk itself, or in any of the statelet's major cities. But on these windswept steppes where borders were just an idea, the League's presence in small villages often amounted to little more than a few under-equipped frontline or garrison cadres.\n\nFor what it was worth, they acquitted themselves well. The men and women of cadres 103858, 109663, and 109667 fought as best they could to protect the agricultural workers stationed there, but they were caught off-guard by the bandits' brazen raid. But by about 9:0 that night, it was all over, their lives either already snuffed out or draining away fast. By the next day, they would be added to the ever-growing list of martyrs, and high command would be charged with dealing with the situation."

The small encampment belonged to those raiders who had so brazenly attacked then only a couple days before. Now, it was time for their just rewards. Five full cadres of well-armed infantry made a quarter-circle as they moved towards the clearing where the drunken bandits enjoyed their revelry.\n\nThere was a click of bipods unfolding, the soft ticks of safeties, and the crunch of soldiers laying prone in soft snow.\n\n"Pick your targets, and wait for the signal."\n\nAfter what felt like ages, a squawk came over the radio.\n\n"Open fire."\n\nThe ill-conceived party became a hellscape within seconds. Tracers ripped through tents, horses, men, trees, everything in sight. Some were shot where they sat, drinking and yelling, others had time to emerge, stumbling, from their tents, only to be shot down in an orgy of violence. After a couple minutes of continuous fire, the encampment was utterly ruined. A soft moaning sound flew into the night. It would not be heeded.

Waiters scurried to cross the invisible line in the middle of the room, seemingly afraid of the psychic consequences of standing near such a powerfully charged faultline. On one side of the table - a menagerie of unimportant functionaries, Karbyshev among them, his face recalling some timeless, monolithic statue. His dispassion said all that was needed. On the other, the old guard, stolid, intransigent, and unabashed.\nIn the background, muffled by walls, there were gunshots.\n"Glavkoverkh," Abakumov intoned with a bare minimum of effort, "I regret to interrupt this luncheon with such an uproar, but a plot was uncovered against the leadership of our League." He paused for effect, throwing a glance at the men seated at his side. "It has been dealt with." Karbyshev, of course, knew all too well what was happening, and his heart sank. It was all over, and his plan - no, HE, had failed. But he would not go down quietly. Abakumov, or one of his cronies, was in the middle of gloating when a withering stare crossed the room, his words falling to the floor like a dead bird.\n"Ten years now," Karbyshev almost whispered before raising his volume tenfold. "Ten years now, you people I once called my comrades have betrayed my trust, and since then I have been nothing but window dressing for your continued victimization of our people. I have watched you send women and children to war armed with museum pieces." He paused, rising from the table and letting his chair fall to the floor. "I see you for who you are now. You rats are just as treasonous as Vlasov and his vermin," Karbyshev spat with pure venom, animated by a terrible anger. "I lost many things from the waste they fed us in the camps - muscles, fat, teeth. But not my convictions.""

 omsk.10.t: "Karbyshev's Condition"
 omsk.10.desc: ""Any word from Abakumov?" Karbyshev asked, already knowing the answer.\n\n"None," replied Khasan Magomedov, the young Tatar lieutenant who served as the old general's aide-de-camp. "Likely still recovering from the tongue-lashing you gave him." Karbyshev chuckled. The young officer was technically Karbyshev's countryman, in a way - Karbyshev himself was of Tatar (albeit, Siberian, and Orthodox) extraction, and Magomedov hailed from Tatarstan proper. But nationality wasn't why the Glavkoverkh had insisted on this man serving as his assistant for the past decade.\n\n"Have you seen the doctor's report?" asked Karbyshev. Magomedov shook his head. The Glavkoverkh poured two glasses of vodka and motioned his aide over, gesturing to a chair next to his desk. Once Magomedov was seated with his drink, Karbyshev continued. "Nothing you probably don't already know, or haven't heard on the grapevine." He took a long sip of vodka, his eyes almost wistful. "Doctor says I'm not long for this world. Kidneys are going out, plus half a dozen other things." Magomedov's face went white, not so much because he was unaware of this fact as because responding to such a statement was not the easiest task. Karbyshev sensed this immediately, and filled the void instead. "I know, not the easiest line to follow up on."\n\n"One way to put it, I suppose," replied Magomedov, gathering his wits. "Have you figured out...you know, final wishes and such?"\n\n"In the process of doing so. But I assure you, you can have anything from my office and quarters when I go." Both men laughed, and, for a moment, the oncoming specter of death didn't seem so immediate."

 omsk.11.t: "Karbyshev's Last Days"
 omsk.11.desc: "Karbyshev motioned Magomedov over to a side table in his office, glancing around furtively before speaking up - not in Russian, but in Tatar, his other native tongue.\n\n"Listen, Khasan," the old general said with a grim seriousness in his voice. "When I die... well, I have faith in Yazov." A moment passed. "But if things go badly, go north, and tell them Yelena sent you." Magomedov replied with a look of mild disbelief. "My daughter, yes." Karbyshev responded. "She's smarter than I am, truth be told. Got out when she still could." His eyes grew distant, as if imagining another time, and what could have been. "But I've got a thing for lost causes, I suppose. I stayed, and this monstrosity was built up around me. Built on me."\n\n"Dmitry, I..." Magomedov stumbled, at a loss for words. "...I really can't express my thanks. But... Dmitry, why me?"\n\n"You know, you're one of the only people who calls me that. Just 'Dmitry.'"\n\n"That's because you asked me to, sir."\n\n"I ask everyone to do that. They don't. Even Yazov can't bring himself to. And it's part of why I care about what happens to you after I'm gone. See, when Yelena defected, I knew it was for the best. But that took away one of the last people who would sit down and talk to me as a human being, as a friend, and not just worship me or try to get favors. You're practically the only one left now. I sit up here in heaven, and watch all the people down below file into church, as it were, and pay their respects. And then their little ceremonies end and they all go back to ignoring me and everything I stood for. I'm not a real person to them anymore - just an image, a myth." The old man sat back in his chair. "That's why I care.""

 #omsk.11.t: "Karbyshev's Last Days"
 #omsk.11.desc: "Yazov would not let it show, but he was distraught. For years he had ignored the small signs that his mentor was fading away, but they were coming more quickly now and as much as he would like to, he could no longer deny reality. Every day Karbyshev seemed a little smaller, a little weaker. Most days he didn't leave his bedroom, not even to go to his office down the hall. His voice barely rose above a whisper now, and he struggled to hold a pen to write with. All of these were concerning on their own, but they were not what disturbed Yazov.\n\nWhen he looked into Karbyshev's eyes he had once seen fire and passion. In the last few years that passion had gone, replaced with a grim determination that he still admired. But a few weeks ago he had noticed the determination had left his mentor's eyes too. Now there was something new. Acceptance. Karbyshev would never say it aloud, but Yazov knew his teacher had surrendered to his fate. He didn't want to believe that Karbyshev would allow himself to fade away into nothingness. The fire that had once burned within him must still exist somewhere inside. Every so often Yazov would try to coax some passion or excitement out of the old general, but he never succeeded. One day while they were both working in Karbyshev's bedroom, Yazov heard a small chuckle from behind him. He turned to see the frail man his teacher had become sitting up on his bed.\n\n"What is it sir?"\n\n"I was just thinking about my legacy, about what I'll be leaving the world with once I go on to whatever's next."\n\n"You'll have a wonderful legacy sir. You'll be the man who saved Russia from the traitors and the fascists. You'll be remembered as a hero."\n\n"I certainly hope so.""

 omsk.12.desc: "It was over.\n\nAll of the old marshal's schemes had failed. Once, he had fancied himself the pilot of the great ship that was his beloved League. Perhaps this had even once been true. But, in the way that only human beings could, Dmitry Mikhaylovich Karbyshev had deluded himself, thinking himself to be sailing Russia to a new dawn when he was little more than a wooden figure carved on her prow. All the papers strewn across his desk were now little more than butterflies without wings.\n\nPerhaps a walk outside would clear things up. It wasn't like there was any other option left. The old marshal left his office, passing through multiple security checkpoints on his way out, and catching more than a few surprised glances. Yet at the same time he felt invisible - the only person who even asked his business was Magomedov, slumped half-awake behind a security desk.\n\nAs the cold nighttime wind whipped against Karbyshev's old frame, he felt a strange sense of peace. Certainly, it was one tinged with sorrow - sorrow that he had not done enough, that he could not do more. Yet the hot, heavy anguish that had wracked him for the past five years was gone. Looking up at the snowy night sky, watching the snowflakes emerging from the darkness, the old general felt as if he had done his part. What would be, would be. Letting the faintest hint of a smile creep across his wrinkled face, he waved to the sentries at the guardhouse as he walked out the main gate of the command compound and strode into a copse of trees, towards the riverbank. Half-frozen by the early Siberian winter, the little creek babbled softly at the general's feet, lapping up against the icy ground. His boots quivered on the slick rocks of the riverbank.\n\nHe didn't struggle when the cold waters claimed him.\n\nThe next morning, the internal security men would ask Magomedov a thousand times over what it was Karbyshev had said to him before leaving."

Under normal circumstances, this would be irritating. But manufacturing in Omsk meant manufacturing underground, safe from German bombers and Russian raiders. This meant every vibration shook the whole plant, every sound echoed off of the vast concrete walls, and the pain of being in this swirling mess of industry was doubled.\n\nThis was necessary. Every industrial cadre assigned to each underground plant was told this, and knew this. For if they were to survive the next war, nothing could be spared in the defense of these factories. They would be the engine that kept Omsk running."

 omsk.14.desc: "Sofiya had come to like the bombings.\n\nThe grownups talked about them like it was a problem. The instructor of their Youth Cadre lectured them on how evil the Germans were and how their bombs killed Outsiders on the surface. But Sofiya didn't believe it. For one thing, she had never seen an Outsider. She'd only heard stories - how they ate dirt, wore rags, and lived in holes in the ground instead of barracks, without cadres or instructors. Vasya, the new kid, always cried whenever they told stories like this, but everyone knew they were true.\n\nWhenever the bombs came, the sirens would start to play, and the whole cadre would be sent down into the shelters beneath the surface. So instead of doing physical exercises or learning about the Germans, the children would run through the tunnels, playing war while the bomb-sounds thumped up above, rumbling like soft thunder.\n\nBut now these days were becoming rarer and rarer. Sofiya and her cadre were now braving the outdoors more and more often, and these coveted playtimes beneath the earth became less and less frequent. Lectures on the Germans had become more frequent, and physical drills in the proving grounds were becoming the new norm, only occasionally interrupted by a few lonely aircraft in the sky."

It was nearly stripped bare of branches and leaves, the evergreen trees barely green anymore.\n\nBut they had endured.\n\nAnd it had now been quiet in the sky for 3 days straight.\n\nHe felt a lump in his throat. Behind him were the days of Karbyshev and his guiding hand. The days when he could afford to take orders, and be a soldier. Now, he would have to lead. The fate of the Russian nation, all on his shoulders. Out of all the officers in all the League, Karbyshev had trusted him.\n\nWas he really ready? All of Russia was against them. The world would be, as well, once they saw the strength of the Russian nation united. And the ultimate foe, Germany, would not sit idly by and wait for its destruction. Surely this was hopeless. What he wanted most to do was to crawl back in a bunker and forget he had ever been born, to forget Karbyshev's impossible dream and become just another officer.\n\nTo run.\n\nBut that would not do. Russia needed a leader, and though he would be an imperfect instrument, he would act. He would look to the heroes of the First Trial, to the proud Russian nation, and to Karbyshev's determination for his strength. All the fear of what he had to be, and the doubts about what he was, were cast aside by a newfound clarity of purpose. He was Russia's last, best hope for national salvation.\n\nHe stopped staring at the forest. There was much that needed to be done, much that must be prepared for the coming Trial.\n\nAnd he would do it."

 omsk.16.t: "The Old Guard"
 omsk.16.desc: "Karbyshev had thought back to the birth of the Black League a lot more recently. Perhaps it was because he knew things were coming to an end soon, for himself anyway. He smiled at the thought of those early days, when his vision had been so clear and the path towards national redemption seemed so obvious. He was overjoyed when many of his officers and old comrades volunteered to join the League and help him save the motherland. If only they had stayed true to their word and not fallen astray. Perhaps even then they had simply concealed their cynicism from him, and had always planned to use the League as a path to personal health and power. The old general prayed it wasn't so. He did not want to consider that so many of his friends might have always been this corrupt and power-hungry. But then, if the League had made them this way, was that any better?\n\nHe had spoken with Kharkhardin yesterday about the growing corruption in the League and what might be done about it. As always happened when he brought these things to Alexander, he was gently chastised for making mountains out of mole hills when there were more important issues to focus on. He didn't have the heart to tell Alexander he knew that he was skimming money off the budget for his personal projects. It wouldn't have mattered if he had. Just like all of Karbyshev's other old friends, Kharkhardin seemed to think of him as more of a puppet than an ally these days, someone to prop up for the League while profiting off of its members.\n\nKarbyshev inserted a piece of paper into his typewriter and began to write another memo laying out a plan to eliminate corruption in the League's ranks. He knew it would be ignored. All of the others had been, but he could not give up now. His motherland needed him, and he would not abandon her, even if everyone else had."

The expansive complex will not only feature a primary bunker in the heart of Omsk, but metro systems fanning out all across the city.\n\nWhile some in the League complained at first of cost overruns and corruption, they no longer will.

They had not been in the room for 5 minutes and already things were getting out of hand.\n\n"Gentlemen, please stop arguing for one moment!" Karbyshev managed to get a desperate shout over their bickering, though doing so winded him and he had to sit down. Reluctantly, both men quieted down and turned to him.\n\n"Does anyone know when Kharkhardin is going to arrive?" Karybshev asked, gasping for breath after his outburst.\n\n"He isn't coming," Valukhin replied. "He said he has important business and he'll request a briefing on whatever we discuss."\n\n"I told him this was important."\n\n"I know Dmitry. I'm just telling you what he told me."\n\n"Very well.

It has been some time since I made a public address, but there are matters of vital importance that must be discussed and I believe each and every one of you deserves to be involved in that discussion. I know in my heart that every member of the Black League believes in our mission. From myself to the rank-and-file members of the cadres, all of us want a strong, united Russian nation and understand the Black League is the best organization to accomplish that goal. But in recent years we have been consumed by distractions and division, and I fear we have strayed away from our objective."\n\n--a pause--\n\n"I have seen troubling signs of infighting and factionalism from my subordinates and from many officers of the League. Let me be clear that there is no room for factionalism within the Black League. If Russia is to be reclaimed from the darkness we must work with a unity of purpose, united by our love for our motherland. I am troubled that I must remind everyone that your loyalty is not to your superiors, but the Black League itself. I have also uncovered extensive networks of corruption from high ranking members of the League. I shall not identify names here as I believe in offering a chance at redemption to all, but let me be clear that if this corruption continues there shall be consequences for all of us. If any of you believe that you know of any corrupt or unpatriotic behavior I would urge you to report the suspect and make sure that justice is done. The greatest betrayal a League member can commit is placing their own needs above those of the Russian people."\n\n--another pause--\n\n"I had hoped these matters could be solved internally, but I have realized they are too widespread to not be discussed in public. I hope that by addressing you, the patriots who make up the foundation of the League, we might be able to finally put an end to factionalism and corruption and restore the League we all believe in to its original purpose.

 omsk.20.desc: "It was an early morning in Omsk. Yazov, preceded by a steward, sat down by the training grounds of the League. Out there, in the blur of the distance, the shouts of men and gunfire rang in the air. Today, too, was a day of preparation for the Great Trial. Near him was an empty chair. Comrade Karbyshev was not here today. Yazov shook his head, brushing his face with a gloved hand. Thoughts of betrayal assailed the protégé's mind, only for a slight tremor in the air to banish them.\n\n"Your coffee, sir?" the steward said. Yazov gave him a faint smile. "Banish those forms of address, comrade. We are all equal to our duty," he said, "but yes, for now, I will take coffee." The steward gave a little bow, perhaps unused to the notion of equality among the ranks of the League, and laid down his cup in front of him. In the chilly morning air, wisps of steam trail the jet-black liquid. Yazov took it and held it in front of him, staring down at the cold, hard-set eyes reflected in those dark depths, letting the scent immerse him in the memories of things long gone. He took the rim to his lips and drank.\n\nThey flooded him in an instant, the rich aroma guiding him through the whirling pool of his mind. He remembered his first taste of coffee, from before the Fall. Then he came upon a scene of comrades breaking bread in the freezing weather of the winter battlefield, hearing the firewood crackle. He let an unseen tear gather in his eyes. They're all dead now. Yazov put his cup down, gritting his teeth. He held it out for a few moments, pondering whether to finish his drink. Against common sense, he did.\n\nHe found the fragrance guiding him away from the turmoil of the Great Patriotic War. Yazov drifted where it led him. Dearest Omsk, dearest homeland! He had sat in the cramped and huddled camps of refugees fleeing the west, the blood the Germans spilled staining even half the world away. He remembered the harsh and bitter coffee of that place and the dank and sour smell that surrounded him. At that precipice, the coffee ceased to be. Yazov stared at the bottom of the cup and smirked. Now was not the time to mourn, but the time for revenge."

It was still smudged with grease.\n\nAFTER ACTION REPORT FOR BITIYA SECTOR\n\nCO: KAPITAN ALEXEI KURCHATOV\n\nCADRES INVOLVED: 102821, 108302, 205913, 209813\n\nPATROL OF CADRE 102821 ENCOUNTERED ENEMY POSITIONS AT 0930.

Pitched battles with a reasonably determined enemy. However, they seemed to be no match for the firepower or determination of his soldiers. He allowed himself to be proud. This was progress. They were a real fighting force now, comparable and even superior to the best that Siberia could muster. Maybe it was time to rest his tired eyes. He removed his cap and tossed it onto the desk.

A full quarter of his cadre- nearly 20 men, had been lost across the border after the last action against Tyumen. Half again as many were also wounded, and they were desperately low on all sorts of medical supplies. He didn't even feel angry at anyone in particular- in fact, his unit had performed quite well, holding their own and giving far worse than they got. But when the line falls, your unit falls with it, tough or not. If 102821 had been more active, or 205913 had held out a little longer...\n\nBut that was irrelevant. What mattered now was restoring discipline, and making sure this never happened again. He grabbed a private by the scruff of the neck. "DO YOU NOW UNDERSTAND THE PRICE OF COWARDICE?" He could barely muster the energy to fake his fury. "How many have been lost now? Those who you knew and grew up with? Lost unnecessarily, because some rats wanted to scurry off the ship." He tossed the poor private back into the snow.\n\n"Let this be a fair lesson to all of you. If you run, you will die. Worse, your comrades will die. Worse, your nation will die. Those who run betray not only their cadre, but their nation. You must fight for the nation to survive. Let no man in this cadre EVER AGAIN turn their back to the enemy. Face him without fear, and you cannot fail. Use what you have been taught, and the steel in your hearts, and we will be invincible."\n\nHe slumped his shoulders after he spat out the last few words, and tramped off towards a foxhole near the front.

A few hundred meters to his right a burning tank bellowed a pillar of black, oily smoke into the sky. Scattered around the fields like discarded toys were the bodies of soldiers from both sides. They looked almost ridiculous, the ways they were twisted and contorted. The cleanup effort would take some time, and even then the little valley he had once enjoyed garrisoning so much would never look the same.\n\n"Excuse me, Colonel Fedorov," one of his lieutenants approached him. He turned away from the scene to address the man.\n\n"What is it, lieutenant?"\n\n"It seems the enemy has retreated back to their territory. Our scouts have reported they have withdrawn from the field completely and are heading east at full speed. Should we pursue them?"\n\n"I don't think so. They nearly overwhelmed us here. It's best not to push our luck. Tell your men to start counting casualties, ours and theirs. I want a report as soon as possible."\n\n"Yes sir."\n\nThe lieutenant scurried away and Fedorov turned back towards the grim view. He refused to let it show, but the way the Black League's soldiers had fought disturbed him. They came on relentlessly, with no concern for their lives. If he hadn't seen them bleed with his own eyes he would have been convinced they were robots. This had not been their full strength either.

After a long, bumpy ride the trucks stopped before another, newer gate that read Omsktransmash. Behind it the rest of her life waited.\n\nAt first the new equipment the instructors expected her to handle baffled her. This place was unlike anything anyone in her cadre had seen. None of them had any idea what a place like this might assemble, until the overseer took them to see the prototype. It was a tank, larger than any vehicle Alyona had ever seen and sporting a cannon twice as long as she was tall. The overseer explained the League had selected them to assemble the next generation of Russian armor, and starting tomorrow they would be given their stations and taught how to serve their new purpose.\n\nThe next week had been a flurry of lectures and tutorials and demonstrations. Alyona's assignment was to attach the cannon to the turret. It was backbreaking labor, far harder than her old job had been, but she approached it with enthusiasm. Every day more tanks rolled out of the factory, ready for the battles ahead of them. The words of the overseer's speech stuck with her. The machines she produced would be on the front line, avenging the motherland and punishing those who had betrayed Russia. Alyona couldn't have been more proud."

 omsk.27.desc: "The rain poured upon the silent streets of Omsk as the procession marched through the streets, the drumming of rain upon gravel and boot upon stone drowning out all life. In the center of the column of wordless soldiers, a simple wooden coffin rested upon the hands of a chosen few. As they marched through the city, a flash of light momentarily lit the stony faces of those marching before a crushing boom of thunder echoed overhead.\n\nAt the front of the column, arms aching, bearing the weight of the left side of the coffin upon his shoulders, marched Dmitry Yazov. He was grateful for the night and for the rain, for it would let none see the tears as they flowed freely down his cheeks. He was still garbed in the uniform of General Karbyshev's closest follower - not a leader, just a follower.\n\nAs the procession passed apartment block after block, the residents, garbed in their own uniforms, filed orderly out of their homes and joined the procession. Not a word was spoken among the men and women of the Black League as they marched their great General's body through their streets.\n\nThey marched for what seemed hours, out of the city proper and past the training fields, and all along the way; more and more people joined the march. For one night, they would put their differences aside. For one night, the entire Black League stood united in mourning. Eventually, they reached their destination. The highest hill in the land the League controlled, a suitable final resting place for the man that had given so much for them.\n\nYazov exhaled deeply as he knelt with the others carrying the coffin, lowering it oh so gently down into the tomb. A single, choked sob left his throat before he stood, gazing at the assembled Black League before him. A small podium had been arranged just behind the grave.\n\nHe walked, unsteadily at first, then confidently, then with utter calm, to the podium. He looked down at his people below. The Black League watched him with complete attention, each man and woman standing rapt and alert. In his heart of hearts, Yazov knew then that it was not over. He turned on the microphone, and began to speak."

Even a lowly dogsbody such as him could feel the energy in the air.\n\nVasily, a man Bodgan would call more than an acquaintance but not quite a friend, nodded in agreement. "This new man - Yazov - he's really got it all planned out hasn't he? I guess the Black League got tired of biting at its own heels..."\n\n"Unless you want a one way trip to the Redemptionary Brigades you'll bite your damn tongue." Bogdan cast his eyes askance, but they appeared to be alone for the time being. "I may be a humble man from humble birth, but even I can see that things are changing here. Used to be that you could sweep these streets in peace as long as you threw a salute to the League when they came your way. Now I see them everywhere, eyeing me up and down. Like they're evaluating whether I'd be better as frontline infantry or as bloody cannon fodder - which I guess is the same thing."\n\nVasily gave him a woefully naive look. "Every city needs civilians, Bogdan. Surely they'll find a use for you that isn't quite so bloody." As he spoke, a platoon of League cadets came marching down the street. Their eyes were steel, devoid of any emotion beyond pure determination and the slightest hint of rage and hate. The two civilians stood aside as they passed, and Bogdan dropped his voice to a resigned whisper as he spoke again.\n\n"These aren't just broken men anymore. They have one purpose in mind, and that purpose has no place for men like me. No place for civilians, unless I am holding a gun.""

If Mr. Karbyshev was here today, do you know what we would want us to do? Do you know what he would be pained not to see us do?"\n\nYazov took a well-placed pause.\n\n"He would want us to prepare for the Great Trial. And prepare we must, men.

Yes that's exactly what I'm saying. They always tell us how important it is that we be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our motherland, but what has Russia given me?

Any attacker would be shot at from 5 different angles, as the city planners had intended. Reinforcements could be rushed via tunnel to weak points, and ammunition could be flooded to any part of the garrison that needed it.

 omsk.32.desc: "Yazov felt uneasy. He held nothing but respect for his late mentor, but Karbyshev's death had exposed his greatest failure. He had given his life to build the Black League from nothing, but in his dogged efforts to save Russia, he had allowed the League to become reliant upon him to hold it together. Even with Yazov as his designated heir, the old generals had seized Karbyshev's passing as their opportunity to attempt to break free. Yazov knew that the League could not survive another succession crisis. Without him, the Black League would collapse from within and without. All of this would have been for nothing. Russia would be doomed.\n\nYazov resolved not to repeat the mistakes of his mentor. The Black League was bigger than any one man, and the motherland's salvation could not depend on him alone. What the League needed was reorganization, from top to bottom. The League would become an entity unto itself, even its most prominent members merely small parts of the great leviathan that would see Russia avenged. Yazov called his councillors and generals to his office. By the time they arrived he was already hard at work. They labored long into the night, until the plan was complete.\n\nThey sent out the first orders the very next day. Every officer of the Black League was to nominate a successor, to maintain the chain of command should he be incapacitated, and a secondary successor should his first choice be incapacitated as well. Every position from field marshal to sergeant would be required to have two levels of contingencies ready. The frontline troops would not be spared their share of the responsibility. It would be their duty to prepare themselves to fight without their officers, to continue the League's struggle even if their leaders could not. The soldiers would obey their commanders, but they would fight for the Black League, because as long as the Black League existed, Russia could never die."

Then it all gave way as a whine, a crackle, and a pop echoed across the silent streets of the Black League's little swath of earthly territory.\n\n"Comrade-soldiers of the Black League," intoned a voice over the loudspeakers, "this is Glavkoverkh Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov speaking. Some days ago, when our dear comrade Supreme Commander Karbyshev passed, I was named his designated successor in his last will and testament." Somewhere in a bunker below Omsk, Yazov paused, knowing that he would now have to admit the unthinkable - there had nearly been a coup within the League. "Certain opportunistic and treasonous elements of this League's leadership attempted to prevent the execution of our great Marshal's plan. They have been dealt with in accordance with the military justice of our League."\n\n"I speak to you today to announce a change of course. Under the direct leadership of Glavkoverkh Karbyshev, our League was a model of efficiency and effectiveness, and made tremendous progress in the reunification of the Russian nation and its total preparation for the Great Trial. Yet, for the past five years, a cancer has begun to grow within our state, festering, rotting away within our very flesh and corrupting the correct guidance of our founder. And today, it has finally been excised."\n\n"In nature, there is no quarter for the weak, no mercy for those incapable of securing their own existence. The same is true in the affairs of human beings. We cannot, will not, must not let sentimentality, corruption, and favoritism come before our ultimate priority - ensuring that Russia has a future. We must make the Russian the apex predator of the Eurasian continent. In the coming days, I will speak to you again more and outline the changes that are in store.

In total there were fifteen cadres assembled that morning waiting to be inducted into the ranks of the Black Guard, the finest soldiers in the Black League. Arkady and his brothers had endured months of grueling training to reach this point. Not all of them had made it. Some of them had flunked out, while others had broken under the weeks of physical and mental torment they had endured. There was no room for weakness in the ranks of the Black Guard, and those who survived the training had no weakness left in them. Arkady considered this fact without pride, for pride had no place in the Guard either.\n\n"Cadre 183275." called the Captain overseeing the ceremony.\n\nArkady's cadre marched towards the stage. The Captain began reading their names off one by one. Each soldier crossed the stage, saluted the Captain, and proceeded down the stairs a newly inaugurated member of the Black Guard. There was no celebration of the occasion. The guards could celebrate when they had avenged Russia, but until that day they would be allowed no joy, no sense of accomplishment.\n\n"Glazkov, Arkady."\n\nArkady took the short walk towards the podium, gave a crisp salute to the captain, and exited the stage. As he walked down the stairs he felt a spark of pride in his new status. He crushed this last internal rebellion. He was truly a member of the guard now. After the last graduate had crossed the stage the Captain approached the podium.\n\n"You are all now members of the Black Guard, the Motherland's last, best hope for revenge.

However, these refugees can be a useful intelligence asset if used properly. Not only can we extract information from them about the conditions in surrounding states, but we can use them as cover for infiltration."\n\n"Moving our own agents in with refugees will be far more plausible and less risky than attempting either border crossings or individual infiltration. If they are turned away, no harm done. If they are let through, then they are already intermingled with the general population.\n\nThis proposal would require essentially no added cost, merely some carts and hidden communications equipment, all of which are readily available.

So far only a few saboteurs have been captured alive, and while they have refused to talk even under advanced interrogation methods, we have been able to discern that they originate from Omsk. It seems the Black League has dispatched a small army of spies and operatives to our nation to try to halt our buildup and prevent us from mounting any organized military campaigns. This is likely only the first step to make us a softer target before a full invasion. Already our units have been placed on high alert and border patrols have been increased to prevent any more League agents from slipping into our territory. However, the damage that has already been done is significant and it will take some time to repair, as well as to track down the remaining saboteurs who we have not yet captured.

The two cups sat in the cold, their steam streaming into the air in smooth wisps, before dissipating. He leaned back in his chair, growing sleepy as worry and concern faded from the creases of his face. Comrade Karbyshev was not so weak that a chilly wind could kill him. He would return and lead the League to glory. He squinted. Now was not the moment to grow complacent. What would the man think of him if he found Yazov dozing off before their appointed meeting?\n\nYazov sat up, his elbows on his knees, tapping his fingers as the hours passed and the day stretched to the evening. The cold breeze blew between the trees, and the training field grew silent as men trooped to dinner and other martial business. The stern clouds looked to the Earth and seemed to grow greyer and greyer in disappointment or wrath. Still, Karbyshev did not appear. He was old, however, and maybe his creaky joints made him late. Yazov laughed, but it was hollow. Aides and officers came out of the offices, begging him to return to his quarters. A storm grew in the distance, and the clouds grew stark, steely in outlook.\n\nThe sun went down, and snow fell. First in a gentle dusting, then as a thick, heavy blanket. The cool breeze became a frigid gale. The cool breeze became lashes of frozen air. Still, Yazov sat, waiting, his fingers clasped together, breathing with every shiver and shock. An aide, braving through the harsh weather, came beside him. Yazov was still. "Sir," the aide said, "it might be time to rest. You will sadden Comrade Karbyshev deeply if he returns."\n\nYazov stood.

Perhaps the rot within the League's officers would dissipate with the promotion of a fresh young face?\n\nObviously, Yazov reflected bitterly, he was wrong - for the most part anyway.

We've got 20 guests about to come knocking!"\n\nThe men rushed to their predetermined spots along the side of the road. Feodor scrambled over to the machine gun. He pulled out a belt of ammunition and fed it into the gun's loading mechanism in one practiced motion. He turned to face the approaching squad, still unaware that they were not alone in these woods.\n\n"Hold fire until they're too close to run." Alexi whispered next to him. One tense minute of silence passed as the traitors approached. 150 meters. 100 meters. 50. Feodor could see the clouds of steam rising from the breath.\n\n"Kill the bastards!" one of the cadre shouted and sixteen men opened fire as one. The machine gun cut through the soldiers like a buzzsaw. It was over in a few seconds. Before anyone had time to process it twenty men were bleeding out in the snow. They'd never had a chance to fire back.\n\nAs the cadre began to celebrate this unexpected victory Feodor caught another tremor of motion in the corner of his eye. One of the fascists was struggling to stand, letting out a raspy wheezing sound. He began to draw his sidearm but Alexi put a hand out to stop him.\n\n"Don't waste a bullet on him, he doesn't deserve it...""

Across the horizon there were vast fields and forests beneath a setting sun.\n\n"Just across those fields lies our greatest foe," the commissar said. Some of his men looked at him in perplexion. Was their greatest foe not the German? The commissar took note of the looks on their faces. "The Teuton is a heinous creature, a merciless monster that consumes the lives of any it can lay its gnarled fingers on. It does not know kindness or mercy."\n\n"But it is only in its nature to be evil. Our greatest foe had a choice in the matter, and they chose treachery. Across those fields, the "Aryan Brotherhood" lies in wait." The commissar's lip curled in disgust at the very utterance of that name. "These self proclaimed Aryans are our own flesh and blood, comrades. They are Russians just as much as you and I. And yet they take up the mantle of the Teuton, the very ones that murdered, raped and enslaved our nation until it buckled at the knees."\n\nThe commissar spat into the dirt. Blood rushed to his face as he looked to his men with pure hatred in his eyes. "They are the Judas of Russia. And I would rather suffer a million more of our own butchered by the Teuton than to allow this mockery of our people to persist."\n\n"Tomorrow you will be fighting for the very heart of the Russian nation. Give no quarter, show no mercy. This corruption must be ripped out from its roots and purged from the face of the Earth." The soldiers broke out in cheer.\n\nThe commissar rose his rifle high to the sky. "Tomorrow, we shall shed the blood of a thousand traitors! Death to the Aryan!"\n\n"Death to the Aryan!" the soldiers chanted with hate thundering through their voices. "Death to the Aryan!""

 omsk.48.desc: "As they had been trained to do, the cadres scattered quickly when the German bombers were observed approaching the outskirts of Omsk, moving in ordered groupings to their assigned shelters and positions, and providing their identification particulars as they entered.\n\nTo a one, they all hated the Germans high above with a burning passion, but they knew that, until their preparations for the Trials to come had completed, they were near powerless to strike back at them. So they sat, and hated, in disciplined silence as the tremors of bomb hits reverberated through the shelters' walls.\n\nSuddenly, however, the bombs stopped. And the distant report of machine-gun fire could be heard. One cadre, assigned to observation duty, moved to the shelter's periscope and, after a moment and with excitement breaking through the calm demeanor usually demanded, reported that the bombers were under attack by fighter aircraft.\n\nThe other cadres fought to remain still, though they all knew what that meant. The Aviators had arrived. Their instruction, reinforced daily, was clear: the Aviators were strictly unreliable elements. But even when delivered by dedicated officers, the enthusiasm with which lessons against the failures to the north or the great enemy to the west were delivered was not present. None truly held the Aviators, in their heart of hearts, as an enemy. How could they, when they fought, and killed, Germans on a near-daily basis?\n\nSeveral minutes later, the observer reported a damaged German bomber approaching the ground, on a trajectory for a crash landing, and the officer in charge asked for volunteers to venture out during the raid in search of prisoners. Every cadre present stood without hesitation, despite the danger. The Aviators might have shot the bomber down, but the task was not yet finished.\n\nIf any German had survived, they would soon wish they hadn't."

 omsk.gauntlet.1.desc: "Timur Ivanov ran a dirty hand through his lank, greasy hair. He hadn't bathed, hadn't even slept, in days. Yazov and his Black League had hounded him for weeks and Ivanov had watched as his comrades in the Old Guard were picked off one by one.\n\nNow, hiding like a rat inside the abandoned apartment building, Ivanov wondered if he was truly safe. Setting down his sheaves of paper down on the table, he got to work. There had to be a safe way to contact his allies, organize a proper resistance, or at least, determine a safe escape.\n\nIf the Russian wasteland had taught him anything, it was that anything was possible. Toppling Yazov could still be done if they worked quickly.\n\nHis frantic scribbling came to a sudden halt. What was that sound? Carefully, as not to make any noise, Ivanov rose from his chair, revolver in hand. Moving carefully over to the window, he thought he could make out the sound of a motor running, muffled as it was by the new fallen snow.\n\nUsing the muzzle of his pistol to open the curtain just enough to see, Ivanov's blood ran cold. There, in front of the apartment, was a coterie of Black League soldiers exiting their truck. Terror seized him. How could they have found him? He had been so careful, bribed the right people, and moved only at night. Five of them were moving closer, and he knew he had no chance in a firefight.\n\nInexorably, Yazov's executioners approached the door. He had no option, but to ready his pistol, and prepare to die, as so many of his comrades had before him."

The cars had parked outside, the engines turned off, and the soft footfalls of the Old Guard officers approached.\n\nOne of the usual entourage was not among them, the Judas who had sold them all to Yazov in exchange for his own life. None knew that their safehouse, their secure redoubt, had been compromised.\n\nThe first man flicked on the light, as those behind him filed inside. These haggard, gaunt men had been on the run for days now, looking over their shoulders for Black League knives. They should have counted their fingers after shaking hands with their fellow conspirators instead.\n\nAs the last man filtered inside and closed and locked the door behind him, the soldiers rose from behind their hiding places. Automatic fire chattered from Great Patriotic War relics, as the bodies Old Guard opened up like bloody flowers.\n\nThose who survived the initial onslaught dove under tables or else ran for the door, so quickly forgetting it was locked. A man fumbled for his sidearm in a panic before being lifted off his feet by a stream of lead. Only seconds later, it was over. Gunsmoke lingered in the air as casings rolled off into corners.\n\nThe Black League soldiers gathered the bodies, ensured that all of the targets were accounted for, and then made way to depart. Another batch of the Old Guard was dead, and Yazov's hold tightened further."

 omsk.gauntlet.3.desc: ""It isn't safe here," Vadim warned, the old veteran's voice grim. Despite grimaces around the room, the rest of those present seemed to agree. "Yazov's men have the city, and are actively hunting us."\n\n"Too much of the League is with him," another muttered angrily. "How did it come to this? Who thought it was fine for Karbyshev's protege to assume control unchallenged?" The men around the table began breaking into a more intense argument, which Vadim quickly tried to dispel. Tensions were high enough, and he knew they were going to worsen. He braced himself as the arguing continued - before it was abruptly cut off.\n\nThe door was suddenly kicked open, and smoking canisters thrown inside. Vadim placed a wet cloth over his nose as the others began coughing as the first Black League soldiers stormed in, masked and rifles ready. One of the other officers moved for his weapon - and was instantly shot. More soldiers poured in, killing those who moved too fast, and forcing the rest to the ground as they were restrained.\n\nAll of them, except for Vadim. A Black League officer acknowledged him with a nod, and handed him a mask which he donned. One of his friends, now restrained on the ground, looked up at him with wide eyes. "Why?" he gasped.\n\nVadim knelt down, unable to keep the regret out of his voice, much as he tried controlling it. "Lisenka." He answered quietly, before standing again. He needed to say nothing else but his daughter's name to make it clear the situation.\n\nVadim thought himself a strong man, a loyal one too. Yet he'd learned that a man was only as strong as his family, and in that respect, he was a weak man. And monsters like Yazov exploited weakness, no matter what it was. In the end, he saw no reason to condemn his family for a doomed dream. This was Yazov's League now."

Yet the cold and aches didn't matter to him; only his mission. All he needed was confirmation his target was in his home.\n\nConfirmation he now had.\n\nThe man had thought that fleeing the Black League would save him. That they would let the traitors of the Old Guard live out their days in peace. Perhaps in the old Black League, that would have been true, but no more. He'd tracked the traitor to this small town, and sent notice to Omsk. New orders were returned to him.\n\nThe orders were simple. Liquidation.\n\nHis orders clear, and his target on the premises, he waited for night to fall. The man was helpfully a loner, and Sherkov had already broken into the house to assess its layout. He'd ensured that a window was unlocked, and was able to let himself inside without a sound. The house was silent as he made his way through the house, in the darkness, until he reached the bedroom.\n\nPicking up a pillow in gloved hands, he wasted no time in forcing it down on the weaker, older man. The man woke up, and tried to thrash around, but it was too late. Sherkov pressed down hard; pressed down until the man stopped moving. Removing the pillow from his face, he placed two fingers to the neck.\n\nNothing.\n\nSatisfied, he departed the house as silently as he had entered, and began making the long trip back to Omsk."

"Tea?" He asked, sliding over a mug, while sipping from his own. The young man, Tanas, slowly reached over, and took it. Alexei watched him drink it, appraising him quietly. "Are you afraid?"\n\nThe man froze in place for a moment, the mug between his hands. His expression answered the question, if his trembling voice didn't. "Are you going to kill me?"\n\n"You're here because of your associates - not actions," Alexei said, leaning back. "I was in a situation like you once, surrounded by men only interested in greed and power. They promised me whatever they wanted - if I helped them. I imagine it was similar for you - but there's an emptiness to it all, wouldn't you agree?" He motioned idly. "We're supposed to pursue more than money, power, and decadence, no?"\n\nTanas nodded slowly. "That's what I thought the League was. Above all that. Better."\n\n"Because it is," Alexei smiled, pleased. "Men such as those offer nothing to Russia and the League, and are parasites on both, who corrupt all those around them." He fixed Tanas intensely. "But good men, we instinctively know this is unnatural. It is wrong. I'm not here to kill you - I want your help, and the Black League needs good men.

Savintsev raised his glass in toast and drank as well, allowing the burning draught to linger on his tongue for a moment.\n\n"Glakoverkh," said Savintsev carefully. "Why am I here?" He knew that he had discharged his duties faithfully and competently, surely Yazov had not called him here merely for congratulations and vodka.\n\nThe ghost of a smile crossed Yazov's face as he turned to face the officer. "I need you as my second, my right hand. I need people I can trust, Evgeny. Your skill and devotion to the Black League have placed you above your fellow officers, and in the days to come, we will all be tested. Do you accept this task?"\n\nNot entirely sure what Yazov meant by "tested", Savintsev masked his hesitation by swallowing the rest of his drink. His stomach grew agitated and acidic at the sudden influx of liquor. To be Yazov's right hand was greatly prestigious and to refuse the Glakoverkh was foolish. "Yes, I accept. Anything for the League and the Great Trial to come. What must I do?"\n\n"Yazov extended a hand, which Savintsev took readily. "Destroy our enemies and foster the Russian people. Once the Old Guard is destroyed, all of Russia will need to be brought into the fold." Yazov gripped Savintsev's hand tightly, his eyes like pieces of flint.

Of course, Yazov was perfectly aware that many of the men in the room would prefer to see him shot than listen to someone they regarded as an upstart firebrand. Yet, he carried on. "As the new Glavkoverkh of the Black League, I would like to make it clear how I intend to exercise my new role."\n\nYazov took a deep breath.\n\n"In the last days of our dearly departed comrade Karbyshev, there was no respect for authority among the higher ranks of our organization. Our founder, a living example of the principles we all seek to emulate, was ignored and regarded as little more than a figurehead. His wise counsel was spurned, and our mission corrupted by bureaucratic cliques."\n\nHe could see the discontent evident among some of the men seated before him. But he carried on. "While I have no intention to punish those responsible for this system, I certainly do not intend to let it continue." Yazov glanced to the side, at Sakharovsky and the others he had brought with him. "I have at my side a staff of eminently capable officers and generals, and with their help, as well as, I hope, yours, I intend to make this organization into something of which our dear Dmitry Mikhailovich would be proud."\n\nYazov had long imagined this moment and the satisfaction it might bring, the heady rush of making a fateful decision manifest with carefully-chosen words. But no such feeling came, and as Yazov met Abakumov's hateful beady-eyed stare, a sickening, head-spinning realization washed over him. There was no turning back now. The Rubicon had been crossed, and this was war."

It's just that... well... this seems exceptionally harsh to me. Dozens of executions. Hundreds of arrests. Some of these people are the most senior members of the League. Can we really afford to get rid of them?"\n\n"Every person on that list is a coward and a thief, and most of them are traitors too. The Black League has no place for them any more and we must show the members of the League what happens to those who obstruct our progress. Now I would encourage you to deliver that memo as fast as you possibly can if you don't want to be considered an obstructionist yourself."\n\nThe lieutenant opened his mouth to reply, then thought better of it, snapped a quick salute, and almost sprinted out the door. It brought Yazov a small amount of satisfaction to see the fear in the man's eyes. Respect was all well and good, but fear was the best way to ensure obedience. Karbyshev had been a wise man, but he had failed to realize that. He had placed his trust in people who had exploited and abused him. Yazov was not so forgiving, as those scum were about to find out."

Nothing can be achieved without such power, and without such power one lives only at the mercy of those who are stronger. As grim a reality as it may be, we must recognize that there is no inherent right to existence, to life. We can only rely on ourselves."\n\n"The simple fact is this - ideals have failed Russia. It is systems of ideals that place unworthy people in positions of power. In the First World War, Russians bled and died for the sake of an incompetent man who had done nothing to merit leadership. In the Second, they did the same, only for different men. We have seen the products of such systems and paid the price for their failures. But no more." Yazov paused. He knew what was coming. His stomach clenched, but he knew there was no other way. It was what Karbyshev would have wanted. This is what he had to be.\n\n"The Black League's sole objective is the survival of Russia in the face of the coming Trial. To do this, we cannot make the same mistakes as our predecessors. Going forward, weakness in leadership will not be tolerated. I am hereby issuing a decree allowing the removal from command of ineffective officers. From this day forward, any official - no matter how high-ranking - can be brought before a court-martial by the consent of ten of his direct subordinates and another officer. The lawless wasteland permits only the strong to survive. We will bring this principle into our leadership, in order that the new Russia we are building may be sharpened into a weapon which no amount of German bombs can break.

While there is undoubtedly some reason being used by the officers to justify their revolt, at this time, no formal statement has been issued. In any case, such a pretext matters little - Yazov has made his intention to remove these aging, "inefficient" officers eminently clear, and it can be assumed that the mutineers are fighting first and foremost for their own careers.\n\nExactly who is in command of the revolt is unclear. While the uprising in Isilkul is reportedly headed by one General V.S. Abakumov, an NKVD veteran who joined the Black League in its early days, it is still uncertain who, if anyone, is actually leading the rebellion in Tara.

Truth be told, while on the exterior he was quite adept at putting forth a brave face, within the pressure was nearly overwhelming. He couldn't help but feel like a child dressed up in his father's work clothes, the weight of the world on his unready shoulders.\n\nThese thoughts were interrupted when General Sakharovsky burst in.\n\n"Glavkoverkh," he said breathlessly. "We have work to do."\n\n"So it would seem, Alexander Mikhailovich," Yazov replied, trying his best to exude the confidence that he lacked as he stood up from his desk and gathered his things. "Mobilize everyone we've got. Even the RSBs. Lock down the city. Once we're in control, we plan our next move." Sakharovsky nodded, and summoned an aide. Yazov felt decisive.

The wash of crackled words, murmured through half-broken speakers demanding the citizens return to their homes, mixed anxiety into the palette.\n\nLower down, in the dark bowels of the city, the composition was ongoing; thousands of dark-clothed oppressors, each one a brush, painted their heavy boots across the streets.\n\nAll those wide eyed rabble viewing the great scene from their windows could do nothing but accept the artistry before them.\n\nYazov had become the grand painter of the city, perhaps all of Russia.

Not physically - it was cramped, damp, and smelled of mold, but in a more existential sense. This kind of war - the kind he now felt himself immersed in - was something he could rationalize and understand. The last few weeks of chaos and civil disorder had been a disorienting, vertigo-inducing sequence of events for Innokentiy, a veteran of the failed effort to reclaim West Russia in the 1950s. The war that was now being fought was nothing like the one he had seen waged ten years ago. The conflict within the Black League came and went in fits and starts, with brief engagements interspersed within long, endless hours and days of tension and speculation. The front lines seemed to appear and disappear at will, as political machinations within the higher ranks made foes suddenly become friends and vice versa. Rarely could Innokentiy enjoy the adrenaline rush of a straight fight, or the feeling of a well-executed infiltration. But today was such a day, and, as he looked at the bunker complex a few broken city blocks away, he couldn't help but feel quite pleased with himself.\n\nA distant "thud" from within the compound let Innokentiy know that his work had come to bloody fruition, in one way or another. The handoff of the explosive-laden briefcase last night had gone off without a hitch, and it seemed that his contact had successfully set off the device, at least. It wasn't until the appointed signal - a staccato series of six gunshots, in groups of threes, that Innokentiy knew that Viktor Abakumov was dead."

 omskgauntlet.12.desc: "The new regime in Omsk now takes another step towards consolidation, as the officers' putsch in Isilkul collapses into anarchy with the death of its leader and sole unifying figure, Viktor Abakumov, at the hands of an assassin's bomb. An NKVD man who found Karbyshev's ideal of a strengthened and renewed Russia attractive for all the wrong reasons, it is unlikely that many outside of the officer cliques he held together will mourn his passing.\n\nWithin hours of Abakumov's death, tensions among his shellshocked co-conspirators seem to have boiled over into open warfare, and with gunfire reported inside of Isilkul, Black League units were able to sweep in and mop up any remaining resistance with relative ease. Yazov's dream lives on for another day, but there is no rest yet for the Glavkoverkh - a revolt still festers in Tara."
 omskgauntlet.12.a: "Target liquidated."

 omskgauntlet.13.t: "Siege of Tara"
 omskgauntlet.13.desc: ""Come on, come on, come on!" yelled the cadre leader over the ragged beat of boots on the dirt road. "408966, forward!" For a moment, he was back at Volokolamsk in 1940, fighting a losing battle against the oncoming German tide. And then, a moment later, he was on the outskirts of Tara once more, distant gunfire beating out a harsh tattoo in his ears.\n\nCadre Leader Pavlov's cohort was certainly not used to actual frontline combat, let alone against men who had until recently been their sworn comrades-in-arms. Then again, combat wasn't exactly in their job description - Pavlov's cadre was a reserve cadre, known in Black League parlance as a "chetvyorka," or "four," due to the fact that their six-digit designation began with that number. Normally, such units, often composed of older soldiers seen as being past their prime, were relegated to the duties of keeping the non-League members in line, and making sure that the civilians stayed quiet and met their production quotas.\n\nBut today, as had the days before it, had not been an ordinary day. As he broke down the door of a grey, dreary civilian dwelling with a few chosen subordinates, Pavlov reflected on how utterly unthinkable this situation would have been only a few months ago. Men he once would have died to save were now his mortal enemies. With a splash of dust, the rotten door split open, termites wriggling from its fragments on the ground as the reservists rushed in and corralled the building's occupants. The civilians cowered before him and his black-uniformed men with a practiced ease sharpened by years of living under the Black League's "protection." As usual, it didn't take much to make them comply - the end of a PPSh was excellent for loosening a person's tongue. Moments later, Pavlov had the target's location, and had rejoined the rest of his cadre back on the dusty road. The ring around Tara was almost complete."

 omskgauntlet.14.desc: "Yazov, it seems, has successfully run the gauntlet.\n\nIn contrast to the revolt in Isilkul, which ended in gunfire and internecine street warfare before Black League liquidators swept the city clean of those who challenged the Glavkoverkh's authority, the revolt in Tara has died peacefully. While the news of Abakumov's death and the collapse of the Isilkul putsch seems to have not fazed the Tara conspirators, the defeat of Old Guard forces and the subsequent encirclement of the city certainly has.\n\nThe revolt's leaders have now run up the white flag of truce, and have agreed to surrender to Yazov's forces in exchange for any potential death sentences being commuted to Redemptionary Service, though it remains unclear whether the Glavkoverkh actually intends to honor this pledge. Regardless, it seems that the Old Guard's rebellion has finally ended."

 omsk.smuta.1.t: "Out Stretches the Black Hand"
 omsk.smuta.1.desc: "Another day of work, another assignment. By now it was a familiar routine.\n\nValerian enjoyed his work, and especially doing his part for the League in his humble role as a technician. Information was power, he'd always believed it, and always rested well, knowing that his work helped enable the League to protect them. More recently, however, he'd...not developed some doubts, but admittedly, questions were arising. His latest assignments had been strange, especially this latest one.\n\nWhen he and his team had pulled up at the site, he'd actually made a call to his superior to make sure they were at the right address. They'd not done a school before; he'd not even thought that was a relevant surveillance target. Nonetheless, they'd received confirmation, and they'd begun work, per their orders.\n\nSurveillance establishment was a multi-stage, multi-day process; usually more complicated than most people assumed. There were the obvious surveillance elements, primarily cameras, established in hallways and other public areas. Simple, justifiable, and managed by the administrative staff. However the League had designated the school for full surveillance coverage - meaning it was classified as a potential counterintelligence hub.\n\nThat meant bugging everything. Mostly offices, bathrooms, and other places where people might talk where they thought they weren't being watched. There was an art to surveillance, which he normally enjoyed, but for the life of him, Valerian couldn't figure out what they were gaining by spying on teachers and schoolchildren.\n\nHe signed, as he finished setting up a camera, performing a few checks, and stepping down his ladder. He was likely overthinking all of this. If the Glavkoverkh had ordered it, it was surely for a reason."

 omsk.smuta.2.desc: "The prisoners were dressed in simple clothing, cuffed, and forced to walk the street together with a few other captives of the Black League. Anna couldn't think of a set of more humiliating circumstances. Circumstances made worse by the unsympathetic crowd - and soldiers.\n\nOnce brought to the city square, the Black League officer began reading their crimes. Dissemination of illegal materials, inciting resistance against the Russian people, all of them fancy words that only described expressing her concerns about the growing surveillance and oppression of the League.\n\nShe didn't look into the crowd. She didn't want to look and see her family and friends in the crowd. She knew they were there - if they'd not come voluntarily, then she knew the League would have forced them too. She was not just being punished, she was being made an example of. She'd resolved to not cry. She'd done that earlier.\n\nThe officer read the verdict, stating that their assets would be confiscated by the state. What little she'd had was now lost, and even if she served her sentence, she knew she wouldn't get it back. He then turned to face the prisoners. "Each of you will receive sentences of five years hard labor."\n\nThen he paused. "However, if you wish, there is a different path, if you wish an alternative to pay your debt to the Russian people. The Redemptionary Brigades are open to you - should you choose them. Do so, and your debt to Russia will be paid in full."\n\nAnna's first reaction was one of revulsion. To become fodder for this state; a lethal arm forced to fight and kill...Yet the ugly truth was that, no matter what happened, she would be serving the League. Did it matter if it was in uniform, or in chains? She did not know what her conscience would accept - but she needed to make a decision."

 omsk.smuta.3.desc: "On a table rested a simple model of the city of Omsk, but not the city as it currently existed.\n\nNumerous changes had been made to it. Critical buildings were moved, guard posts were established at critical junctures throughout the city,  anti-air emplacements were planned that comprehensively protected the airspace. There existed designated areas to establish and store artillery, and roads and networks designed to facilitate rapid troop repositioning, as well as designed to facilitate a comprehensive urban defense.\n\nIt was a marvel of military architecture.\n\nYazov reviewed the model city recently presented to him by several League architects, and their work could not have been better. Resting near the model city were numerous design documents which held blueprints, analysis, and justifications for the design choices. He had charged them with turning a city into a fortress - and they had exceeded expectations.\n\nOmsk would only be the first such city to be reimagined in this way, but it would not be the last. No more would cities be the vulnerable achilles heels of the state. Now they would become fortresses; death traps for any who would assail them. Yazov imagined the Germans trying to throw themselves against the defenses - and failing. He smiled at the thought.\n\nThe only downside was that such renovations would be a major disruption for civilian life - families would need to be relocated, materials procured, and prices raised. An unfortunate, but necessary sacrifice. The German war machine would spare no effort to destroy them - and they needed to be prepared to meet it."

At the head of the table was Yazov, who smiled as they entered. "Take a seat, gentlemen."\n\nThey were all older men, well-dressed, and exhibiting dour expressions. Each of them were executives or owners of the largest oil and mining corporations, few of whom had been especially happy with the change in leadership. Yazov was well aware that they'd had certain understandings with the Old Guard - and now it was time to renegotiate these previous agreements.\n\n"I have asked you all here to establish a new understanding concerning the League's expectations of your activities," Yazov snapped his fingers, and aides disturbed several documents to each attendee. "Upon your written consent, your operations will be subordinate to oversight of the League. Inside the agreement are the quotas we expect, and of course, how you will be compensated for your efforts."\n\nThe reaction was immediate shock and outrage. "Do you expect us to agree to these ludicrous terms?" One demanded, standing up, face red. The rest of the executives were similarly furious, as they read further. "How dare you try and force this on us! We will not-"\n\nYazov lifted a hand. The League soldiers readied their rifles, aiming them at the executives at the table, who froze in place. "If you do not accept," Yazov said slowly. Deliberately. Clearly. "Then this same proposal will be given to your subordinates. I will repeat this as many times as necessary. The days of your exploitation, corruption, and decadence are finished. You will serve Russia - or I will find those who will."\n\nHe pointed at the documents, his voice hard, and leaving no room for debate. "Sign.""

 omsk.smuta.5.desc: "While the citizens of the Black League rested as night fell, the Glavkoverkh continued working. Too much remained to partake in the luxury of rest.\n\nYazov was confident they had the ability to succeed against the German menace - but the truth was that there were many, many lessons to be learned from the previous failures. It would be foolish to ignore what had been tried in the past, so that mistakes could be easily avoided.\n\nHis study was filled with literature and reports; most of which related to the Great Patriotic War, and West Russian War. From after-action reports, to first-hand accounts, to war journals and academic books on the subject, he spared no source of knowledge. Yet he needed to know more than history.\n\nAccompanying the aforementioned literature were German military manuals, accounts and memoirs written by German generals and officials. Books on National Socialism, from a variety of perspectives were included. Italian, American, and Japanese analysis of German culture, military, and economy were collected.\n\nKnowledge was critical, and Yazov knew that relying solely on the Russian perspective was not enough. They needed to know what had been learned by the other enemies of Germany - and of course, how the Germans saw themselves and their ideology.\n\nThe study was neatly organized, and as he read through his vast library, pages were bookmarked, passages were highlighted, and he would regularly make a number of notes in his notepad. Every night he spent at least one hour doing this, and he would continue doing so until he was finished. The scale of knowledge before him was monumental - but he would get through it, while there was still time to do so."

 omsk.smuta.6.desc: "Tatiana watched as mortars were fired, and the white-streaked canisters flew towards the small, abandoned village. As the canisters landed one by one, he wondered who had lived there, and what had happened to them. Nonetheless, it was a good place for simulations. Today, the simulation was a chemical attack. Something he'd never done before.\n\nWhen they marched into the German heartland, there would be many of these types of villages, and all of which would need to be pacified. As shells continued firing, the tear gas became visible, and soon coalesced into a dense fog seeping through the village. As he watched, unbidden thoughts came into his mind.\n\nToday was only tear gas, but this was only a simulation. When they did it for real... there would be people living there. He wondered when this situation would apply; where the line would be. Would they do it only to heavily defended areas? Would it be a last resort? Would they only use non-lethal chemicals?\n\nHe didn't know, and was finding himself more uneasy with the implications. While the village was empty, he could imagine the screams as the chemicals engulfed the village. It was one thing to kill German soldiers, but he wondered...\n\nHe violently shook his head. No, no none of that. Families or not, civilians or not, when they did this for real, it would be against Germans. They were all complicit; they knew what had been done, and would support it again. He couldn't allow doubts to consume him now. If anything, the Germans deserved worse.\n\nHis officer ordered them to move forward, so he put on his gas mask, and joined his comrades as they marched into the chemical-laden village. It was enough to make him focus on his task, and push the doubts to the back of his mind."

They had learned about the First Trial in school that day, about what the Teutons had done to the Russians.\n\nSome of the children had cried, others remained silent and numb, but all felt the same ripples of disgust and outrage. The projector had shown them pictures of the piles of Russian dead, the smashed remains of villages, and hurt and starving men and women marched to their deaths.\n\nBurned into Yuliana's mind were the long, lingering images of the dead children. The little bodies were around Yuliana's age, far too young to understand war, but the Teuton had come for them all the same. They were naked, starved little skeletons, huddled together in pits. Gloating Germans stood above them, like hunters posing with their kills.\n\nAn old soldier from the First Trial had come in to speak, too, telling them in a creaking voice how the Germans had forced everyone in his village into the forest before shooting them. He had only survived by pretending to be dead and hiding under the corpse of his mother.\n\nYuliana had raised her hand and asked what they could do to stop it from happening again. The teacher had seemed to brighten, explaining that punishing the Germans so harshly that they would never dream of hurting the Russians again was the answer.\n\nEvery German, the teacher had said, knew about what the army was doing - and approved of it. Therefore, every German would be punished like the Teuton soldiers. Yuliana, and her classmates, agreed. They were evil, all of them, and if the Russians didn't kill them first, they would come back to destroy Russia for good."

Most could be dismissed out of hand, but it remained prudent to keep an open mind. The officers under his watch were a generally well-disciplined and upright lot, but every organization suffered from corruption, even the League, much as they tried to stamp it out.\n\nWhich, admittedly, was part of his job.\n\nAs he cross-referenced and double-checked figures, Gusev came to a few conclusions about this particular complaint. First, Captain Kiselev was making much more than his wages should indicate. Scratching with his pen, Gusev marked the captain out for audit. Second, the rank and file soldiers had undoubtedly been engaging in battlefield looting - a practice strictly forbidden by the Black League.\n\nGusev sighed as he reviewed his disappointing conclusions. No matter how many slogans were spoken, nor how much propaganda was ingested, soldiers were still acting like soldiers. The Black League, like every other army in history, suffered from a degree of corruption, and today was another unfortunate reminder of that fact.\n\nLooking back over the stack of papers that required his attention, Gusev stood to prepare himself a pot of coffee. The investigations would not conduct themselves, after all. The only thing worse than corruption was refusing to act on it - and it was here that the corruption would stop."

 omskexp.1.desc: "The black-uniformed ranks stood assembled before a tense, pacing Yazov. He saw the nervous energy in their eyes, and fought to not meet it with his own, steeling himself, forcing his mind back into the familiarity and certainty of the past. To the Gauntlet, and how he had been decisive and strong. Like Karbyshev. He'd just do his speech, and forget about the fear.\n\n"Comrade soldiers," Yazov began, using that familiar phrase that Karbyshev had been so fond of. "Today, by proving our strength, we prove our worthiness to rule Russia. Your deeds today will prove the fundamental nature of the universe - the strong rule, and the weak perish. Your deeds will prove that WE, the All-Russian Black League, are the sole salvation of this nation and its millennium of civilization. So, though today you may fight your own countrymen, fight as if you were facing down the Führer himself! Because if we fail today, there IS no tomorrow, and Russia will perish once and for all at the hands of the superpowers when the Great Trial comes. So go forth, and carve your names into history!" Yazov was satisfied with his delivery, and a cheer broke out. And now, the final, personal touch that was uniquely his. "Our cause is just," he shouted to further cheers, giving voice once more to those words he had heard on the radio when it all began in 1941. "The enemy will be destroyed. Victory will be ours!"\n\nThe speech was over in what seemed like an instant, the words flowing from him without comprehension. As his heart soared, basking in the soldiers' cheers as anxiety melted away for a moment, he wondered if this was how Karbyshev had felt before stepping into the unknown."

 omskexp.2.desc: "Light was just beginning to creep over the eastern horizon. Andrei had been awake for several hours already, watching the border for any sign of movement. Behind him the rest of his cadre was doing their morning drills, checking their weapons, and preparing for breakfast. Ahead of him stretched an endless grassland, disappearing into the darkness. About fifty meters out into that grassland was an invisible line, the line that separated the All-Russian Black League from the traitors and cowards that sought to undermine Russia. Borders were a fluid and often fanciful concept in Russia nowadays, but according to the map they had, the line was out there and they were not to cross it. Not yet, anyway.\n\nTechnically there were no plans for war with the Bolshevik scoundrels in Tyumen, and any talk of such was a rumor started by the men. Technically Combat Cadre 154376, along with almost every other combat cadre in the League, had been moved to the border as part of a training exercise. The order to be combat-ready at all times had nothing to do with the escalating border clashes between the League and the communists to the north. Officially everything was business as usual, but the simple fact that the cadre commanders were making no effort to silence talk among the ranks of an invasion was enough proof for everyone. War was coming.\n\nStaring out into the predawn darkness, Andrei couldn't help but be excited. He knew that he shouldn't be, after all it was his fellow Russians he would be going into battle against, but he had trained for war since he was 14 years old. He would finally be able to serve his purpose for the League and avenge the Motherland. He did not want to fight for glory. Out there in the darkness, about fifty meters away, lay something far greater than glory. Redemption was waiting for him."

 omskexp.3.desc: "Since the collapse of the Union, Omsk has always been a heavily fortified city. The bunkers and tunnels first built by the West Siberian People's Republic were only the foundation for the massive network of fortifications and redoubts constructed on the orders of Karbyshev. The paranoia of the Black League has taken physical form. The lines of fortified gun emplacements, trenches, and minefields stretch from the borders of the League all the way back to its heart in Omsk. The very landscape of western Siberia has been weaponized against all outside intrusion.\n\nAs Karbyshev's influence weakened, the squabbling generals of the old guard grew lax in their maintenance of these mighty fortifications. They only cared for the defences that protected their personal holdings, thinking exclusively of themselves and not of Russia's needs. Only when Yazov vanquished the traitors did he realize the sorry state the defences were in. He had reunified the League and its territory, and now that he had consolidated his control he would not lose it to an outside invader.\n\nAs the league prepares for war every step has been taken to make sure the home front is ready. The Last Trial has taught the Russian people that they must expect the war to come to them, and under the Black League's guidance they will be ready if it does. The league has conscripted everyone within its borders to restore the fortifications in and around Omsk. Trenches are deepened and reinforced. Old bunkers are cleaned out and refitted. Anti-air crews reposition their guns towards the border to counter an aerial opponent. As Russia's reclamation draws near the anticipation in Omsk is palpable. These last weeks of preparation will decide Russia's fate. Yazov and the rest of the Black League refuse to cede a single inch of Russian soil to the enemy uncontested."

It had been weeks since the surrender of the last forces of the West Siberian People's Republic. He still couldn't believe that they had lost. By all accounts it should have taken a few months to wipe out Yazov's treacherous cult. Yet as soon as the Black League crossed they forced the armies of the Republic further and further back until the day came when he had emerged from his command post with his hands over his head and several League soldiers forced him into the back of a truck bound towards Omsk. He had braced himself for execution but it never came. After being processed the guards placed him in the cell where he now was and left him to rot. Aside from the guard who brought his daily meal he hadn't seen anyone in weeks.\n\nHe heard the door to the hallway outside his cell open. The echo of footsteps drew closer and closer. Oleg's heart began to hammer in his chest. Perhaps the waiting was finally over and they had come to finish him off. An officer of the Black League came to a stop outside the door, locking eyes with him.\n\n"Oleg Losik." the officer said. It was not a question.\n\n"Yes." Oleg replied, doing his best impression of bravery.\n\nThe officer drew an envelope from his pocket. "This letter is from Field Marshal Yazov. He addressed it specifically to you. You will have your response ready by this time tomorrow." He tossed it through the bars and departed the way he came.\n\nOleg tore the envelope open and removed the letter inside. His eyes devoured its contents. "Betrayal of the Russian nation... obeying traitorous superiors... displayed talent and bravery in the field..."

The question rattled around in Sergei's head day in and day out, even though it wouldn't make a difference. The light was out. The last bastion had been conquered, and now hope rode with Batov and his warband, no matter how shriveled that hope had become.\n\nHe heard steel clanging and the squeal of old hinges, then footsteps pounding towards his cell. His heart smashed against his ribcage. An officer with a nose like the prow of a boat stopped in front of his cell. "Sergei Bobrov," he said flatly.\n\n"Y-yes," Sergei replied, his voice cracking from underuse. Was it finally time for his punishment?\n\nThe officer pulled an envelope from his breast pocket and slipped it through the bars of Sergei's cell. It floated to the ground. "This letter is from Field Marshal Yazov. He addressed it specifically to you. You will have your response prepared by this time tomorrow."\n\nThe officer turned and left.

The bus stop was a short but frigid walk away. Oh no. Oh no, no, no. The bus was late. When it finally arrived he climbed on and found a spot near the back. It felt like there was a brick in his stomach.\n\nPerhaps by silently begging it to go faster, the bus made it to the factory quicker than usual; it wasn't enough to make up for the lost time, though. It shouldn't have been a big deal - fifteen minutes wasn't the end of the world. His stomach dropped as he walked in. The assembly line stunk of cheap tobacco and grease. Two conveyor belts stretched across the room, where they emptied finished buttplates into cardboard boxes. "Grigorovich! What the fuck kept you?" God. Yevgeny's boss, a tall, thin man who demanded to be called Nikolayevich, appeared from the shadows and smacked him on the back of the head. "Have you no sense of duty to your nation? To your fellow Russians? Get to work."\n\nBy the time his shift ended fourteen hours later, Yevgeny was a sweaty, filthy, bleeding mess. The cuts on his fingers had split open again, staining his bandages red. Nikolayevich kicked him in the leg on his way out. "Don't be late tomorrow," he growled. Yevgeny cowered and nodded.

 omskexp.11.desc: "Roman stared at the bottom of the bunk above him. The shiv in his hand refused to let him sleep. The two guards paced up and down the row of bunks, their boots clicking on the wood floor. All of the pieces were in place. The game ended tonight. He would die or they would. His heart thrummed in anticipation. His breath caught when Igor stood up from his bunk at the other end of the lodge. Just as planned. The guard on that end sneered at Igor and drew his gun. Roman gripped his shiv.\n\nRoman slid out of bed and threw all of his weight into the second guard. Roman wrestled with him for a few seconds before he plunged the shiv into the guard's neck and held him down until he stopped moving. He stood, his legs weak. The other guard was a bloody pulp on the ground by the time he hobbled over. Igor grabbed the keys and started on the lock. Roman looked around at the other prisoners. "You are free now. Go, run! Die as free men! The Marshal is with you!" Roman said before he and Igor slipped outside.\n\nMakar's lodge was down the road. He was waiting outside, his pudgy face speckled with blood. "W-we have to move. They will hunt us. Quickly, now!" They ran, scampering through the Yugorsklag like rats. Alarms blared all around. Bare feet pounded on gravel. Guards shouted. The hole in the fence was just up ahead. Dogs barked. Gunshots from everywhere and nowhere. Makar pushed Igor aside and dove for the hole. Roman looked around. Flash. He was blind. The searchlight was on them. The loudspeaker screeched in fury. Makar blubbered. The hole was too small for him. Too small for any of them. The game was over. Roman's heart sank. The guards in the tower opened fire and cut the three of them down in less than a second."

 omskexp.12.desc: "Gennadiy Vladimirovich Vorobyov was frozen. His eyes, his tongue, his teeth, his skin, his testicles, his heart - all of it was stiff and cold. Lifeless. And soon his brain would join them and he would be dead. But he would also be free from Vorkuta. He couldn't wait.\n\nHe trudged through the endless ice and snow, rifle in hand. He shivered and pulled his thin overcoat tight to his body, shifting his backpack from one shoulder to the other. The wind stabbed at him like a driven nail. None of what he was given was meant for weather like this. His coat and hat were too thin and his boots were waterlogged. He felt naked. The exercise was simple: make it back to Vorkuta. The only problem was his numb fingers dropped the compass the first time he took it out. It shattered and without that, his map was useless. So he started walking in the vague direction of home. That was... one or two days ago. Sunlight was scarce above the Arctic Circle; he only got two or three hours at best. That left him with pain and the cold.\n\nA loose chunk of ice brought his boot out from under him. He put his free hand out to break his fall and landed hard on his arm, twisting his hand to the side further than nature would allow. Snap. An involuntary scream burst from his throat as he rolled onto his back. Staggering to his feet, he glanced at the brown-red stain spreading down his sleeve, and kept walking. Between the pain hammering his brain and his great, heaving breaths, a realization dawned on him. No man could survive this. This was a culling. The weak would freeze and the strong would rise. He repeated that in his head as the black flesh in his extremities spread and the sun sank once again below the Arctic horizon."

Yakov swallowed, wiped his nose, and faced the five members of the redemption board.\n\nThe man in the center had a single red line and four stars on his epaulettes. "Yakov Ivanovich Kapriyanov. Conscripted into the 31st Redemptionary Service Battalion for the crimes of allying with a traitorous regime and withholding valuable materials from Black League members. Duration of service to Russia: two years. Is all this correct?" Yakov nodded and the man made a note in his file. When he was done he put his pen down. His eyes were like shiny black marbles under his peaked cap. He jabbed a finger at Yakov's wheelchair. "How did you lose your legs?"\n\n"The Battle of Tobolsk. My battalion was ordered to clear a minefield."\n\n"I see." Another note. "Tell me, Yakov. Do you believe you have been redeemed?"\n\nYakov looked off into space for a moment. "I don't. I can't. I don't even know what redemption means? Have I bled for Russia? Have I lost countless comrades in service of the Motherland and the Black League? Have I given Russia everything I had? We both know the answer to that question." He mustered what courage he had left and met the captain's eyes. "But only you know what redemption means. So you tell me."\n\nThe other members of the board shared looks. The captain glanced to his left, then his right, before leafing through the file laid out in front of him until he found the document with Yakov's mugshot."

Right on cue, Maksim and Luka rounded the corner into the makeshift reception area the ISD had set up in an old medical clinic. As expected, between them on a gurney lay the body of one Oleg Petrovich - though the only way one could recognize the man's identity anymore was by the toe-tag someone had attached to him.\n\n"That took a while," Kazimir observed. "Did you get anything during all that screaming?" Maksim grunted and shook his head, while Luka took a moment to light up a makhorka cigarette. "Fuck's sake. Fine, dump it and go grab another one." He looked down at the list, tapping his pen thoughtfully. "Try... Hm. Try Mitrofan Mikhailovich, that kid we caught near Kurgan." The pair nodded and silently rolled away the latest unfortunate to die under interrogation.\n\nWhen they returned five minutes later, the ISD officers were carrying a young man in a soiled Red Army uniform between them. A vicious red welt had formed on his temple where someone had struck him to stop his struggling. "This him, sir?" asked Luka, spitting away the end of his cigarette.\n\nKazimir ran a finger down the list to find the name again, glancing at the captive to see if the description fit. "Seventeen or eighteen, red hair, narrow jaw, corporal's stripes... Yeah, that's probably him." He jerked his head in the direction of the interview rooms. "Alright, back to it."\n\nThe officers moved towards the hallway, but Maksim stopped beside Kazimir's desk, looking thoughtful for a moment. The senior officer glanced up at his subordinate with a frown. "Problem, Sergeant?" he asked.\n\nMaksim shook his head. "No, sir, sorry, I was just thinking... We need new drill bits. The last guy's ribs blunted our last one. Can you put in a requisition for us?"\n\nKazimir nodded curtly, and with that his subordinates set off down the hall to torture a teenager to death for information he didn't have."

A conspiracy of traitors sought to usurp him; Bolsheviks, merchants and criminals defied his mandate; partisans still plagued the rightful government.\n\nBut none of these things were a hindrance to the determined. In Yazov, the Black League had its Menelaus: a relentless pursuer of vengeance, possessed of an iron will and willing to pay any price for the salvation of that which he loved the most.\n\nHowever, Yazov knew in his heart that his mission - to fulfil the sacred destiny of Russia - would never get any easier. There was always another false claimant to the epithet of 'legitimate government'. It was in the nature of the League to never be understood by lesser men. Even come the Great Trial, Russia would still be crawling with turncoats and faint-hearted pacifists who refused to see the purity and valor of his hate. There was only one answer: an iron boot, perpetually grinding them into the dirt while its wearer conducted the symphony of war.\n\nFor today Yazov had his triumph, but tomorrow? Tomorrow would come the days of blood. No matter how many gallons he had to spill, Russia would pay the price for its future."

 #Batov insurgency events
 omskbatov.1.t: "The Insurgency"
 omskbatov.1.d: "Reports continue to come in of attacks by men of a rogue militant group led by the heinous former Sverdlovsk military junta leader Pavel Batov, as forces reportedly loyal to him have spontaneously led uprisings in several key cities against our rightful government. In Sverdlovsk and Tyumen, these rebels have succeeded in forcing out our local garrisons and now have proclaimed the Russian National Salvation Commission from their headquarters in Sverdlovsk.\n\nWe have succeeded in identifying several key characters of the rebellion, among them Karbyshev's daughter, Yelena Karbysheva, a great betrayal. Ivan Bagramyan, a prominent figure in subjugated Sverdlovsk, has reportedly joined the rebels along with Ernest Voznesensky from Tyumen and Hamazasp Babadzhdanian of Sverdlovsk. All evidence points towards these individuals working together in planning this.\n\nPavel Batov is known for his skill in military organization and strategy, which explains the dangerous success of his movement in such a short time. His ability to manage Sverdlovsk for as long as he did is a testament to such abilities, and we believe that without this competent "head" the rebellion is doomed to fail, making him a key target. The traitor Yelena Karbysheva acts as the head of inter-state affairs and is already reaching out to our rivals for support, and her close personal history with our former leader makes her especially dangerous as well. Ivan Bagramyan and Hamazasp Babadzhdanian are both former Soviet generals who served in the First Trial but now find themselves opposing us.\n\nWe must act quickly to ensure the early death of the rebellion! While they are weaker than us now, they have the advantage of fighting on ground where the foolish population supports them, and unless we move to wipe them out who knows how strong they will grow..."

 omskbatov.2.t: "Operation: KNIGHTFALL"
 omskbatov.2.d: "Nikolay peered at the compound through his sniper scope, the grey tenement appearing bulbous and discombobulated around the edges. Its facade might as well be Marshal Batov's tomb-stone: the Black League had tracked the insurgent to his corner, where he can no longer escape. Still, it appeared magnificent - the sandbags on every window, machine guns polished to glinting in the early morning sun. Pavel Batov had chosen not to go with a whimper, but a statement. Nikolay liked that, even if the Marshal was a traitor to the motherland.\n\nCrackling on the radio. Nikolay took and lit his final cigarette before the operation began. To steady his hands, as he stated to his superiors. Optimally he would have also requested a can of coffee beans and a reclining chair, but he digressed. He was growing sarcastic of the proceedings in the League. At least it was good pay and good food. They paid high rates for snipers - both against them and with them.\n\nIn the distance, a faint explosion boomed through the air, its reverberance barely halting before a whistling sounded. Then, an earth-shattering boom. Black League troops, dressed in camouflage, took this as their signal. In waves and waves, they advanced against the grey tomb, as machine-guns turned their lambent gaze to perforate their bodies with lead. More mortar shells, more troops, more guns, until the rapid gunfire halted, replaced with sporadic, pathetic pops.\n\nBatov stepped out from the backside of the building, alone, unguarded. Here was Nikolay's quarry: the former Marshal of the West Siberian Military District. With one press of a trigger, he let loose a bullet that would nail Batov in the shoulder. Three Black League troops followed him, but he pulled his trusty Tokarev, and shot, shot, shot. It all happened too quickly for Nikolay to follow, but when he set to finish the Marshal off, he halted.\n\nHe saw Batov crawl over the concrete pavement, a single hand scaling a gravity-less cliff, blood trailing behind him. Soon, he would stop, and his head would sag. He was dead."

Daughter of the legendary Black League leader Dmitry Karbyshev, she had gone through the entirety of her childhood under her father's vision - which she now embraced. If only he were still here, she thought to herself as her loyalists and the remnants of Batov's men sped her into the nearest car bound for West Russia, perhaps they would not be in so much trouble.\n\nShe remembered how he was in his final days: mind addled with disappointment and body inhibited by a cold, mysterious sickness. Yelena left him not long after.\n\nThey brought her to an open-topped military car, ready for her perusal. Perhaps, out there in the west, she can find refuge and bring news of the madman Yazov's plans. The Black League had betrayed her father's beliefs. She did not want to rule nor take power; she only saw what love had powered, now only hate ruled. Seated at the back of the car, she saw the buildings and tenements of the small town and vowed to return.\n\nThen her chauffeur turned the engines on and pressed the gas pedal. The car did not roar alive, instead, only a click, and a ticking.\n\nBefore she could warn and get out of it, she was consumed by the flames and the inferno."

The crunch of approaching boots on rough gravel.\n\nIt was the end of the line, whispered a voice in the back of Yazov's head.\n\nThe command car was in disarray. Someone - maybe Sakharovsky - was slumped forwards, blood tricking weakly from the base of his skull. The driver was smashed through the front window. The once-mighty Glavkoverkh sat sprawled on top of - or maybe it was under - one of the car's seats, his limbs twisted into some pattern he couldn't quite comprehend through the adrenaline fog. Something kept him warm - it could have been blood, but he wasn't sure.\n\nThe crunch of footsteps outside and the shouts of insurgents sounded his requiem. His primal instincts screamed at him, pleading with him to run, defend himself, anything. But something within the Glavkoverkh was simply done, vanquished, spent. This wasn't a heroic or memorable death. But, fate had made it his.\n\nA face - or was it two? - suddenly loomed in the smashed window, indistinct and blurry to Yazov's unfocused eyes. Some indeterminate sounds echoed in the distance, but Yazov was no longer interested. A cold, silent paralysis began to grip him, and his thoughts grew indistinct, incomprehensible even to himself. His own head grew distant, numb, his consciousness shrinking and shrinking and receding back away from his eyes into a single, infinitesimal point, until, somewhere, the last stirrings of life within Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov fell silent."

 omskbatov.5.t: "A Word of Warning"
 omskbatov.5.d: ""Any reports from the outlying territories?" Evgeny Savintsev stood by a radio operator in the depths of the Black League's headquarters. "I need information. Now." He was probably pressuring the young man too hard for situations outside both of their control, but if there was hope, Savintsev hoped to be the first one to hear it. He could hear the buzzing of the ham radio, as Black League personnel scramble frantically through all the radio channels available to them.\n\n"Nothing, sir," the young man said to him, face pale. "Nothing at all. I have tried contacting the bases in Tyumen, Sverdlovsk, everything. No response." Under Savintsev's steady and skeptical gaze, his resolve seemed to melt. Perhaps he did find something after all, buried in the recesses of his mind.\n\n"Are you sure?"\n\n"Y-yes, sir. Although..."\n\n"Although? Please be straight with me, soldier."\n\n"There was an unencrypted radio signal that one of the other radiomen found. He said that he was going to pass it up straight to you, but I guess he didn't." His voice quietened into a whimper. "The contents might upset you, so I stayed quiet."\n\n"Tell me."\n\n"It was a message, from Sverdlovsk." The boy swallowed. "It said," finding a piece of paper, he wrote: YOUR ARMIES LAY CRUSHED YOUR GLAVKOVERKH IS DEAD RUSSIA CONDEMNS YOUR EVIL. "And no message after.""
 omskbatov.5.a: ""Dismissed, soldier.""

 omskbatov.6.t: "Unity in Purpose"
 omskbatov.6.d: ""So did you really send that message, sergeant?" Batov said, his tone jocular and full of cheerfulness. One could not guess as to whether he had sent a prank or a death threat. In a compound near Sverdlovsk, Batov's resistance force gathered, a hodge-podge of men and women in varying states of combat readiness. Batov could tell you stories of that one recruit who showed up wearing a metal pan for a helmet for days. Still, everyone there was united in a singular purpose: to rage against the dark, to triumph over the Black League.\n\n"Hell yeah, I did, sir!" Batov admired that sort of enthusiasm. Military work was, at the same time, ludicrous and dull. It was dry one moment and the next you could be paddling up a creek, knee-deep in blood. A spot of comedy and humor could help one get used to it quicker. Pavel patted the sergeant's shoulders and dismissed him.\n\nEntering his inner "office," he saw his high-ranked officers gathered before him. Ivan Bagramyan, trusted quartermaster. Yelena, daughter of Karbyshev. Ernest Voznesensky, the old economic official he had inherited from Kaganovich. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, stranger in a strange land.\n\nHis grin slowly hardened into a stern visage. "Bagramyan, I want you to prepare the government. Yelena, I need you to establish contact with Black League rebels. Voznesensky, handle the infrastructure. Babadzhanian, make sure everything goes smoothly." They looked at him, their eyes flashing with hope and energy. He had to be stern, but he allowed himself to smile."
 omskbatov.6.a: ""Let's get to work, everyone.""

 omskbatov.7.t: "The Fall of the Black League"
 omskbatov.7.d: "For months the forces of the West Siberian Provisional Authority and the Russian National Salvation Commission have battled across the war-torn landscape of western Siberia. Little by little, the underground army has pushed back the forces of the Black League, reducing the areas where its soldiers could operate safely and striking from the shadows when they were least expected. The commanders of the Black League convinced themselves that this was just another partisan organization, larger and more organized than most, but they would still be crushed. That lie became harder and harder to believe as the League's authority continued to evaporate outside of its strongholds, but the tipping point came with Yazov's assassination.\n\nWith the head of the Black League cut off, its weakness was made plain for all to see. The illusion of total control was broken and could never be repaired. Massive uprisings took place and the Salvation Commission launched an organized military uprising, seizing control over much of western Siberia. Now the surviving officers of the Black League have taken shelter in Omsk once again. They are desperately trying to contact their remaining forces scattered across their former territory. Only a holdout garrison in Vorkuta has responded. Everyone else is either already dead or simply saw which way the wind is blowing and decided not to go down with the ship.\n\nIn the tunnels and bunkers of Omsk desperate plans are being drawn up to retake western Siberia and continue the Black League's mission, but all but the most deluded officers know this is a mere fantasy borne out of panic more than anything else. The Black League is done, its mission is a failure. Russia may still be unified one day, but it will not be under Yazov's vision. The only thing left for the League to do is quietly die out like so many dreams before it."
 omskbatov.7.a: "All nightmares come to an end."

 omskbatov.8.t: "Operation: DRAGON'S LAIR"
 omskbatov.8.d: "After weeks of preparation, the crackdown on the insurgents within Zlatoust has begun. In the predawn hours this morning hundreds of officers from the directorate of state security descended upon the city, backed by several battalions of infantry. The officers went door to door, arresting anyone suspected of working for the so-called "Russian National Salvation Commission." The main targets were the local leaders of the insurgency, especially those who were operating from within the city government itself. Most of the suspects were caught off guard and apprehended without incident. A few attempted to run but were quickly caught or gunned down. Others chose to take their own life rather than surrender, saving the directorate the trouble of dealing with them. By the time the sun was up, hundreds were behind bars, dozens were dead, and most of the city had been secured.\n\nA few of the rebel leaders got word of what was happening and attempted to make their escape. Realizing the city was surrounded, they rallied their supporters, three dozen men and women in total, and took control of a warehouse on the edge of Zlatoust. The staff of the warehouse were taken hostage, and the rebels used the weapons and materials stockpiled within to fortify their position. The 29th League Infantry Battalion surrounded the warehouse, cutting off all means of escape, but was instructed not to storm the position to avoid unnecessary casualties. What resulted was a multi-hour standoff that lasted into the evening. Eventually it was decided that the warehouse and its contents were expendable, and an airstrike destroyed the building and everyone inside of it. The city is now firmly under our control once more."
 omskbatov.8.a: "It was not wise of them to test our patience."

 omskbatov.9.t: "Operation: SMOKE PIT"
 omskbatov.9.d: "The city of Chelyabinsk has become a hotbed of resistance to the Black League in recent months. The efforts of Batov's terrorists have turned the city into a miniature warzone, with frequent bombings and hit-and-run ambushes against the city's garrison. Increasing the number of soldiers present in the city has only resulted in a rise in attacks against them. To prevent the situation from devolving further into chaos it was decided that a new approach should be tried. Intelligence officers and secret police have spent the last weeks infiltrating terrorist cells throughout the city, locating their safehouses and warning of planned attacks. These agents have uncovered a network of partisans that extends across the whole city and even into the surrounding villages. With their entire organization laid bare, a more permanent solution was now available.\n\nThis afternoon, the spy's work bore fruit. As the rebels prepared for a series of coordinated strikes, their units were suddenly ambushed by well concealed soldiers of the city garrison. By the time the partisans realized their cover had been blown it was too late. Dozens of partisan soldiers were killed in the first wave of counter-ambushes, and before their commanders could mount an effective response they found their safehouses had been exposed. Combat cadres across the city dragged hundreds of terrorists out of their safe rooms and bolt holes. A few surrendered but most fought to the death. By the day's end the tally was 254 dead terrorists, including every member of the Chelyabinsk partisan command, 133 in custody, and 13 dead League soldiers. The spine of the resistance in Chelyabinsk has been broken. Those terrorists who remain free will either submit to the inevitable or continue their doomed struggle. Without their commanders to guide their treachery it will not be long until we catch them."

 omskbatov.10.t: "Operation: BROKEN STEEL"
 omskbatov.10.d: "Tyumen, once the capital of the West Siberian People's Republic, is now the home of one of the most active branches of Batov's insurgent movement against the Black League. Paranoia has gripped the city with rumors of partisan infiltration and disloyalty within the government spreading like wildfire. It seems everyone from the mayor to the custodian who sweeps his office is under suspicion, and there is no way of knowing who can be trusted. That is, until a month ago when a partisan commander Shadrinsk wasn't quick enough with her cyanide pill and fell into the hands of our interrogators. She held out for a remarkably long time, but everyone cracks eventually. She provided a list of names that, while not comprehensive, gave the garrison of Tyumen something real to work from.\n\nSoon a few officials from the mayor's office simply vanished without any explanation. These men did not provide any information of use, but their disappearance caused a panic among the partisans. All it took was a few days of observation to find which government employees were sweating under the pressure, then placing some tails on them to find out what they had to hide. Soon the Directorate of State Security had a list of dozens of names, and the real purge could begin.\n\nNow the terrorists are running scared. Most of their leaders have been arrested or disappeared without a trace. With the local leadership exposed, the footsoldiers are running for the hills, all their grandiose plans for an uprising now nothing more than dreams. Order has been restored to Tyumen and a major blow has been dealt to Batov's criminal organization.\n\nSurprisingly, the mayor had no involvement whatsoever."
 omskbatov.10.a: "The cowards run because they know they cannot hide."

 omskbatov.11.t: "Operation: HOMECOMING"
 omskbatov.11.d: "It has long been suspected that Pavel Batov, the treacherous leader of the insurgency plaguing the League, has hidden somewhere on the outskirts of Sverdlovsk. The city was the former headquarters of the military clique that Batov belonged to, and even after it was reclaimed by the League it remained a hotspot of terrorism and sabotage. The local garrison has struggled to pacify the region around the city and recently reported there was a serious risk of being forced to abandon their positions in the face of escalating attacks if they were not reinforced. In response, a full division was ordered to the city to destroy the rebellion once and for all. Word of their impending arrival reached the city before they did, and the local rebels launched a full rebellion. By the time the division arrived the city had devolved into a war zone and the local garrison was besieged inside city hall and their fortified barracks.\n\nWith no possibility of a sudden citywide sweep that would catch the rebels off guard, the division commander adopted a new strategy. Combat squads entered the city ready to clear it house by house. Intense street fighting quickly enveloped Sverdlovsk, but the uprising had been hastily organized and began abruptly before the rebels were organized. They were no match for the disciplined forces of the Black League and by the end of the first day most of the garrison had been relieved and the city center was secure. It took several more days before the outskirts were recaptured, but by that time most of the partisans were on the run, their loyalty to their officers vanishing as soon as they realized they were losing. No sign was found of Batov, though a hidden command post that he may have stayed in was uncovered. The city suffered significant damage during the fighting, but with the rebels forced out restoring order should be an easier task than before."
 omskbatov.11.a: "The only way to guarantee obedience is with fear."

 omskbatov.12.t: "A Lost Connection"
 omskbatov.12.d: "Yazov watched the march-past as all commanders were expected to do; with all the efficiency of a gear turning against another the contingents, row by row, filed past him. He'd long since grown weary of these formalities: with every contingent that saluted him came another fifty to sixty men who weren't on duty against the Menace. Another company lost to the pointlessness of display, of an indulgence so polished it almost escaped notice.\n\nThe messenger hesitated by his ear, and Yazov started. Calming himself, he snapped: "What is it? Be quick, I'm on duty."\n\n"The daughter of Karbyshev has been found." Yazov's face froze. He whispered to his fellow general and bounded away from the procession. "Where has she been found? I must know." She was the daughter of his mentor; she was owed that much, one last kindness for the man he'd never said goodbye to. But how to tell her about her father? That he'd wandered off into the forest like an old boar looking for one last fight? Oh, his head spun so - but there was so much to do -\n\nA cold certainty began to slip into his gaze, and puzzle pieces fell together in his mind. "You didn't find her. You found her handiwork." The messenger looked away, his fists clenched white. "We have credible information she's working with Batov. A People's Popular - something."\n\nSomething died in Yazov's eyes. She'd turned into a disappointment. Saying nothing, he stalked back to his procession. At least there was one thing worth celebrating."
 omskbatov.12.a: "Her father never lived to witness her disgrace."

 omskbatov.13.t: "A Sense of Closure, Or..."
 omskbatov.13.d: "Yazov stared at the dossier. It was thin, as were all files belonging to enemies of the Black League: the ISD knew the bare minimum necessary for strategic action, or they had already brought an abrupt end to their careers. In any case, there was little need to maintain extended correspondence. Most of the time the dossiers were also anonymous - why pretend these people mattered in more than purely operational capacities?\n\nNot this folder, however. This one was earmarked by Yazov himself, and in the days since he'd authorised offensive action against its subject he'd come again and again to its pages. How could he not? The dossier belonged to the daughter of his greatest influence, his second father - his enemy, and now an anonymous corpse officially buried in an anonymous grave.\n\nHe flicked open the pages, poring over the details; where had it gone wrong? Surely there had been some imagined slight, some magnified transgression that swallowed them both, broke father from child - there had to be. What had happened to them? If things had gone differently, would Karbysheva now be standing in Yazov's place, fighting for the Iron Dream of Russia born anew?\n\nAnd how best to honor a daughter who had died fighting her father's greatest dream? Yazov had never found the answer to that satisfactory. So he had come up with his own - as he grasped the pages of the dossier, he prayed that he'd done the right thing.\n\nThat night, the Government of Omsk announced a planned renewal of the Founder's Memorial, in the City Centre; repairs took a day to complete. If a coffin, with a dossier placed atop it, made its way to the Memorial, no one took notice - and if it did not emerge come the morning, when the Memorial was resealed, there was nary a peep."
 omskbatov.13.a: "I do this for you, General."

 omskbatov.14.t: "A Tangible Threat"
 omskbatov.14.d: "Glavkoverkh Dmitry Yazov was rarely able to enjoy time to himself. His indispensable duties to the safety and preservation of the motherland were all-consuming, and although Yazov remained staunchly committed to his work to a degree some would consider unhealthy, even he understood the importance of the quiet moments.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages of a fiction novel he had been working his way through the past few weeks, a rather vintage gramophone played old tunes from before the many tragedies that had befallen Russia. He wondered if there would be a place for such art in his new Russia.\n\nBefore he could follow this line of thinking further, however, felt the floor beneath him quiver and shake. The tea cup on his desk, filled with piping-hot liquid, began to vibrate intensely, and even his desk seemed to shift ever so slightly. As the window panes too began to rattle, Yazov felt his stomach tighten. He knew full well what kind of force it took to cause such a racket.\n\nThe Glavkoverkh's suspicions were confirmed by a loud thump that once again shook the entire room. Rushing from his desk to peer out the window, he was met with a large, distant plume of smoke rising against the evening sky. Omsk's vast industrial sector was in that same direction, and Yazov felt shock turn to anger as he began to connect the dots.\n\nWith an explosion of that size, this was obviously no accident. The insurgents were getting more bold with their attacks, and they clearly weren't afraid to strike the very heart of the League."

 omskbatov.15.t: "Disappearing Act"
 omskbatov.15.d: "Lev Ivanov hated being so early to work. The old arms depot in Sverdlovsk tended to be rather unnerving without any of his co-workers around, with its claustrophobic concrete corridors and unreliable lighting. Lev couldn't help but feel as though someone or something was watching him as he made his way down to the storage unit to take stock.\n\nArriving at the door to the small arms storage, Lev immediately discovered that the double doors seemed to be stuck. He groaned and tried not to think about who might have jammed the door without even bothering to fix it. Placing all his weight against the door, Lev strained as he attempted to shove the door open.\n\nNo luck. Lev decided to change tactics, and, perhaps against his better judgement, started to ram his shoulder into the doors. Surprisingly, his first attempt worked, and Lev found himself barreling through the two doors and diving for the concrete floor. Dusting himself off, Lev stood up to examine the scene. There was a weak plank of wood that now laid in twain across the floor, which appeared to have been wedged under the handles of the doors. Behind him, however, was an even more confusing scene.\n\nThe armory was empty. Every crate, every weapon, every bullet was gone. In the far corner of the colossal room, he noticed the cargo bay doors were wide open. Although part of him was annoyed that he didn't think to use those to get in, Lev was far more concerned with what would happen when he reported this breach of security to the head of his cadre..."

 omskbatov.16.d: "TOP SECRET: CLASSIFICATION LEVEL 5\n\nREPORT: Newly extracted intelligence indicates that insurgents loyal to P. Batov have begun establishing operations in the far north, in the vicinity of the Vorkuta Training Facility. The primary goal of this new branch of the insurgency is currently unknown, but it is considered highly probable that agents of the insurgency will soon attempt to infiltrate Vorkuta, if they have not done so already.\n\nInformation extracted from former insurgents points to a conspiracy to contact dissidents in the training facility and spread dissent among the recruits, with the eventual goal of staging an uprising to seize control of the facility and the surrounding area. This intelligence has been deemed somewhat reliable by those who conducted the relevant interrogations. For transcripts please consult attached document A-3.\n\nCOUNTERMEASURES: Security measures are already present in the Vorkuta Training Facility to limit the spread of dissent and ensure full cohesion and obedience among the recruits. In light of this new report, patrols of the outer perimeter of the facility are to be increased from 5 to 10 men and scouting missions into the surrounding region will now be conducted weekly rather than monthly. Additionally, headcounts will now be conducted every morning in addition to every evening, and all reports are to be recorded and audited on a weekly basis. Finally, once every two weeks the sleeping arrangements are to be reshuffled, with the intent of preventing the recruits from becoming overly familiar with their barrack mates.\n\nOnce the new security measures have been fully implemented, the center of the insurgent operations in the region will be located and destroyed. 20 combat cadres specialized in arctic warfare will be dispatched to lead the search. Recruits with a proven record of loyalty and merit will be allowed to aid this effort, including offensive operations, in lieu of traditional live-fire exercises.\n\nEND REPORT"

 omskbatov.17.d: "Mikhail gritted his teeth and forced himself to stop shivering. He clutched his shotgun close to his chest as he crept through the snow, placing each foot in the print left by the man ahead of him. There were twenty of them, ten soldiers and ten recruits deemed fit to join the mission, as a chance to prove their worth. On the other side of the abandoned apartment building, twenty more were creeping towards the front entrance while they approached the rear. In the surrounding buildings snipers waited, prepared to shoot anyone that tried to flee. This building was the headquarters of the insurgents infiltrating Vorkuta, and Captain Petrovich was determined to catch them before they realized the game was up.\nThey reached the edge of the building and took their positions. Mikhail crouched below a window and remembered his orders. Take no prisoners, secure intel on the ringleaders already embedded in Vorkuta. He watched the sergeant give the signal, then everything happened all at once.\n\nMikhail smashed the window and vaulted through, shotgun at the ready. A surprised woman was inside, and without thinking he pulled the trigger. As she crumpled to the floor he was already running out into the hallway, racking his gun. Something whizzed past his ear and he turned and fired. A shirtless man collapsed against the wall, his stomach a crater of gore. The sounds of gunfire and screams came from everywhere, but Mikhail ignored them. He saw smoke coming from under a door and ran to it. He kicked it and the door flew open to reveal a young woman standing before a pile of flaming papers, a revolver in her trembling hands. Her shot missed, but Mikhail's didn't. She flew backwards, letting out a howl that shifted into a gurgling moan. Mikhal stepped over her to extinguish the fire. It was too late. Whatever the documents had been, they were already reduced to cinders.\nIt was then that he realized the woman on the floor was still alive. She was clutching her ruined shoulder, staring up at him with large, pleading eyes. Mikhail racked his gun again and put an end to her."

 omskbatov.18.d: "TOP SECRET: CLASSIFICATION LEVEL 5\n\nBriefing: Operation SMOKE PIT\nThe insurgency in Chelyabinsk and the surrounding region has been exceptionally active and aggressive as of late, with unusually high numbers of bombings, terrorist attacks, and ambushes on the security forces present in the region. So far, increasing the number of active security personnel has proven insufficient to quell the violence or identify the hideouts and networks used by the local insurgents. Considering the unusually aggressive and confrontational tactics, it is probable that the insurgents are seeking to draw the attention of our forces to the region, hoping that by throwing this critical urban center into chaos, they will draw our forces away from other areas they wish to strike.\n\nOperation SMOKE PIT will address this. Rather than play into the insurgency's hand and continue to transfer more forces to the region, the Internal Security Directorate will infiltrate the local terrorist cells to provide intelligence on their plans and ultimate goal. Operatives skilled in subterfuge and infiltration have already been selected and begun preparing for their assignments. It is believed the informal and disorganized nature of the insurgency's network will allow for espionage to be conducted with relatively low risk.\n\nOnce embedded these operatives will earn the trust of the insurgents and join them in their attacks, studying their tactics and identifying vulnerabilities. During this period, the violence in and around Chelyabinsk will be permitted to escalate to avoid tipping the insurgents off that they have been uncovered. When the final goal of the insurgents has been determined, the operatives will be withdrawn and the insurgency in the region will be crushed in a single, decisive strike by the security forces present in the region, in addition to any reinforcements deemed necessary to ensure a comprehensive and definitive end to the unrest."

 omskbatov.19.d: "TOP SECRET: CLASSIFICATION LEVEL 5\n\nBriefing: Operation DRAGON'S LAIR\nInsurgent activity in and around Zlatoust has primarily concentrated on theft and smuggling of firearms. The region's large number of weapon production facilities has made it a natural hub for the black market trade of stolen and unregistered weapons. The insurgency has encouraged and participated in this smuggling, using it as an opportunity to weaken our security forces while strengthening their own. It is estimated that P. Batov's "National Salvation Commission" is responsible for 55%-75% of the underground weapon trade. For more information on the underground arms trade refer to attached document 3-A.\nParticularly concerning is the recent increase in numbers of AK-47 assault rifles found on captured and killed insurgents. The efficacy of this rifle has been proven by our own soldiers, and it was recently designated as the standard battle rifle of the armed forces. Should the insurgents gain access to large numbers of AK-47s, they will be able to match the firepower of our security forces and light infantry units, forcing our garrisons to employ more destructive weaponry such as armor and air support to ensure continued firepower superiority.\n\nOperation DRAGON'S LAIR is an operation developed by the Internal Security Directorate to destroy the underground arms trade, recently approved by Glavkoverkh Yazov. DRAGON'S LAIR will designate additional funding and resources to ISD offices in the Zlatoust area and create a new task force assigned to mapping out the black market and insurgent networks in the region. This task force will have a direct line to Director Drozdov and will be given whatever resources it requires to complete its objectives.\nOnce key figures in the black market and insurgency have been identified, the ISD, in conjunction with the 8th, 12th, and 29th League Infantry Battalions will surround Zlatoust and conduct a comprehensive crackdown on illegal smuggling in the city, denying all entry and exiting of the city until all persons of interest have been terminated or detained."

 omskbatov.20.d: "TOP SECRET: CLASSIFICATION LEVEL 7\n\nBRIEFING: Operation BROKEN STEEL\nIn recent months the Internal Security Directorate has reported a marked increase in partisan activity in the city of Tyumen, particularly concentrated in the leaking of classified information available only to officials with security clearance up to level 6. For a comprehensive list of leaked documents and information, refer to attached document 1-C. These tactics are notable for their divergence from traditional insurgent activities, such as ambushes and acts of terror.\nThe ISD has determined the cause for this discrepancy stems from a pervasive infiltration of the city government of Tyumen by insurgents loyal to P. Batov. The source of this infiltration has been identified as an excessively lenient review process applied to lower-level officials of the former People's Republic of West Siberia. Many individuals of questionable ideology and background were permitted to re-enter the government. A list of those responsible for this oversight, as well as recommended punishments, can be found in attached document 4-A.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the delicate situation, completely replacing every official in Tyumen is not advisable at this stage. Operation BROKEN STEEL proposes a cheaper and more effective alternative. Turar Alieva, a partisan known to be in contact with the Tyumen insurgent network, was recently captured in a raid on her cell's stronghold. Her interrogation is ongoing, and once she has provided the names of her contacts in Tyumen they will be detained and interrogated themselves.\nUndercover ISD operatives embedded in the city government will observe all individuals under suspicion following the disappearance of their colleagues. Those who display signs of distress will themselves be detained and disposed of. In this way, a chain reaction of distress responses will be initiated, identifying the most probable insurgents among Tyumen's government without necessitating a comprehensive purge."

Sverdlovsk has been identified as a potential central hub of P. Batov's "National Salvation Commission" due to this persistent unrest as well as its role as the headquarters of the Ural Military District, Batov's former military clique. This makes the city a location of high priority for both our own security forces and the insurgents, explaining the continuing attacks on the garrison even in the face of increased security measures.\nCurrently, the situation is continuing to deteriorate, and within the last month the garrison has been forced to double the size of all patrols, issue armored troop transports to patrols beyond the downtown district, and restrict guard assignments to the most critical buildings. The garrison commander reports the situation may not be sustainable without significant reinforcements. Surrendering control of the streets is not an option.\n\nOperation HOMECOMING has been drafted to prevent the situation from deteriorating further, crush the resistance cells in the city, and potentially find and eliminate P. Batov and/or his lieutenants if they are present in Sverdlovsk. HOMECOMING will assign the elite 1st Guards Division to the city to reinforce the garrison, more than tripling its size. The division is well trained for urban combat, and has been authorized to persecute all insurgent activity with extreme prejudice, up to and including the use of artillery, air support, and armored vehicles. The presence of the division within the city will be sufficient to prevent an organized uprising from overwhelming the garrison, and the additional manpower will aid the ISD in their search-and-destroy missions in the region."

Batov's insurgent network have proven effective at driving the "National Salvation Commission" out of major urban centers. The Internal Security Directorate has also reported a steady decrease in insurgent activity over recent months. Informants planted within the insurgency have confirmed that the actions of the ISD and other League security forces have dramatically hampered the ability of the insurgency to conduct operations. Most critically, the informants have reported that morale among the insurgents is at an all-time-low, with most continuing to fight only out of devotion to Batov himself.\n\nA ISD operative on a deep cover mission has managed to provide us with the location of Batov's personal hideout, an abandoned tenement building located deep in a village deep in the Urals. Batov has gone to extensive lengths to fortify the building, expending enough of the insurgency's limited resources on defensive measures that it is highly unlikely he is residing anywhere else. While no single building could be held against a prolonged siege by our forces, the defences are formidable enough that Batov would likely have time to escape before the building could be surrounded or destroyed. Additionally, the security measures are thorough enough that a lone assassin is unlikely to reach Batov inside.\n\nOperation KNIGHTFALL provides a solution. 10 combat cadres equipped with mortars, machine guns, and supported by light artillery, will mount a frontal assault on the facility to draw the attention of the insurgents and flush Batov out. As Batov attempts to flee, a sniper with a proven record of successful missions in similar conditions will eliminate him before he can escape. For a list of possible snipers consult attached document 1-A. Preparation for Operation KNIGHTFALL will begin immediately pending the approval of the Glavkoverkh."

While insight into the region is limited due to the sophisticated security apparatus of the Black League, certain revelations have emerged that require addressing.\n\nChief of these is that the region is experiencing a sustained militant insurgency, led by PAVEL BATOV, a former Soviet officer of the now-destroyed Sverdlovsk state, who has been organizing resistance against YAZOV and the Black League.\n\nBATOV is managing a diverse number of rebels, all of whom are united against the Black League, while facing a sustained effort by the League to hunt him down and execute him. As of now, they have failed to achieve this, and BATOV's insurgency remains active. This presents several opportunities.\n\nBATOV has been making overtures to outside parties for assistance in deposing YAZOV. This is almost certainly because BATOV seeks control of Western Siberia himself to reimpose a Soviet state. This objective is in contradiction of our own, however we assess that the likelihood of his success, even in the event that the Black League collapses, is minimal.\n\nThe Black League is an ultramilitaristic, radical force which poses a significant threat to our own objectives. While BATOV's ambitions may conflict with us, there is greater benefit to removing the Black League from West Siberia than allowing them to grow stronger and crush the only existing opposition.\n\nFor these reasons, we strongly recommend providing limited support to BATOV without delay."

Yazov considered opening the window to scrape it off, then decided against it. He turned back to Pitovranov, only to find him still buried in the newest report on production numbers. Yazov had skimmed the report earlier and it seemed to contain mostly good news, though he had called Pitovranov to his office to confirm that. The economist, always a man of details, had been reading the report for almost an hour. In that time Yazov had made himself a cup of coffee, written a memo for commanders of the combat cadres, briefly contemplated cleaning his window, and signed about a dozen execution warrants.\n\nPitovranov cleared his throat and put down the report, finally finished with it. Yazov turned to hear what he had to say. "Overall, this is very promising. Obviously there is some inefficiency from integrating the industry of reclaimed territories, but not as much as I'd anticipated. There are a few areas I'd like to tweak the production quotas, with your permission of course, but all signs say we are headed in the right direction."\n\nYazov grinned. "Permission granted." The economist nodded then turned to leave but before he could go Yazov called out to him. "Evgeny, before you leave can I ask you for complete honesty?"\n\nPitovranov didn't even attempt to hide the confusion on his face. "Of course, sir. What is it?"\n\n"Did you ever think we'd make it this far? The League I mean?"\n\n"I suppose I never really thought about it. I just kept doing my duty and this is where it has led me."\n\nYazov chuckled. "That makes sense. Recently I've been thinking about how far we've come. It seems like just yesterday we were fighting tooth and nail to hold on to Omsk, and now here we are, masters of western Siberia and soon all of Russia."\n\n"We could not have done it without your leadership sir."\n\n"Thank you Evgeny. I've done everything I can to save the motherland, and thankfully it seems that has been enough. Can I tell you something that won't leave this room?"\n\n"Of course.""

 omskreg.2.t: "The Good News"
 omskreg.2.d: "Stepan gazed, for the fifth day in a row, in utter puzzlement at the uniformed men on patrol past his house. They wore camouflage and black helmets rather than the khaki and green of Marshal Batov's soldiers. There was something about their manner, too, which he found disconcerting. Batov's men had always chatted happily amongst themselves, stopped to talk with citizens or help them with minor tasks. These men appeared to regard Stepan and his neighbours as lesser people, not even looking their way unless it was to deliver a cold, cruel glare.\n\nOn the sixth day, he mustered his courage and stepped out into the street as the patrol approached. "Excuse me," he called out, "Excuse me!"\n\nThe sergeant at the head of the patrol signalled for them to stop, and he approached Stepan. "Yes, citizen? Something to report?"\n\nStepan shook his head nervously. "No, sir, I was just wondering... who are you men? You aren't under Marshal Batov's command, are you?"\n\nThe patrol collectively glared at the civilian, who suddenly felt as though he'd made a serious mistake. The sergeant's eyes narrowed. "Because of your... advanced age, I will forgive your ignorance, comrade. We are the Black League. We are Russia. The traitor marshal has been driven from this place, and you are under our rule now. Do not forget it. Patrol, march!"\n\nWith that, they were gone, polished boots hammering a tempo down the paved streets of Sverdlovsk. Stepan still didn't quite understand, but whatever was happening, he didn't like it."
 omskreg.2.a: "He's not required to."

 omskreg.3.t: "Share Your Wealth"
 omskreg.3.d: ""Give that back, you bastards! Hey, no... hey! Get your hands off that, I paid good money for it!"\n\nTaras slugged the merchant across the jaw, splitting his lip. The well-dressed man dropped to the pavement, dazed. "Shut up. It's not your property anymore. These," he said, motioning to the bottles of expensive alcohol filling the back of the truck, "Are class-A luxury goods, forbidden for civilian possession by directive of Glavkoverkh Yazov. As such, they are hereby forfeit."\n\nThe merchant scrambled to his feet and twitched like he was about to make a move, but then his arms dropped to his sides and his shoulders slumped. "But that's my living you're taking!" he whined. "If I can't make a profit off those, I'll be ruined."\n\n"Not my problem," Taras replied, crossing his arms. Behind him, his men lifted crate after crate of vodka out of the truck, chatting openly amongst themselves about 'skimming a little off the top' and 'how welcome the merchant's gifts were'. The merchant could only stand there impotently. Nobody passing by even glanced his way. When the last of the vodka was stowed away in the patrol's APC, Taras stepped back and allowed the merchant to shuffle back, empty-handed, to his truck.\n\n"Consider yourself lucky we aren't fining you, too," called Taras after him. "Have no fear; your products will go to a good cause, I assure you!""
 omskreg.3.a: "Maintaining morale is a good cause, right?"

 omskreg.4.t: "On the Hunt"
 omskreg.4.d: "The map of western Siberia was a complex mess of pins, scribbled notes, circles drawn in red ink and various stamps. The ISD had made great strides in the pacification of the area, but there remained one more major obstacle: Marshal Batov. His photograph was pinned to the corkboard in the ISD headquarters, generously perforated with pinholes. Beneath it were arrayed various photographs of other officers from Sverdlovsk; all were dead, their eyes crossed out - but not Batov.\n\n"He's got to be somewhere in the forests, surely," said one officer, tapping the circled woods north of Sverdlovsk. "It just makes sense, doesn't it?"\n\n"He'd get lost in there just as readily as anyone else," countered his junior. "No, sir, I believe him to be in Zlatoust, possibly in the area of the capital. Hiding in plain sight works more often than you'd think, and it would give him ready access to stolen weapons."\n\nWherever the treacherous marshal was hiding, he had to be found quickly. The bandits under his command were wreaking merry havoc. Patrols went missing, bridges were blown up, supply depots raided. They knew what to do when they found him, but doing so in the first place - that was the rub. Batov was no ordinary partisan leader, but one of the finest strategists in all Russia. However, he was also still just a man - find his weakness, and he would crumble in an instant."
 omskreg.4.a: "He won't make this easy."

 omskreg.5.t: "Into the Mountains"
 omskreg.5.d: "Peek, snap off a shot, then scramble. Keep low, find what cover you can. Close in, let the grenades fly. Keep your knife and sidearm close. Don't stop for anything. Lather, rinse, repeat.\n\nSo went the ISD's constant drills. For those old enough to have served in the NKVD, it was an exceptionally challenging experience. They'd rarely been expected to engage in combat back in the days of the Union. Most of what they'd seen was anti-partisan warfare, which this was... technically. Whereas decades ago they had faced off against indignant Polish and Baltic farmers after the annexations, now they were up against some of the best soldiers in Russia, commanded by one of the best commanders in Russia.\n\nThey had to be ready for Batov's men. They had to be. Every day he lived was another dent in the legitimacy of the Black League. If they underestimated him, made a mistake, lost their only chance - it was over."
 omskreg.5.a: "Practice twice as hard, and battle's twice as easy."

 omskreg.6.t: "Pavel Who?"
 omskreg.6.d: "There was no such man as Pavel Batov. No partisan leader of that name was tracked down and eliminated by the Internal Security Directorate. There was never a marshal of that name in the military of the rogue state, Sverdlovsk.\n\nThose portraits? The plaques in his honor? Nothing more than efforts by dissidents to mislead the good citizens of Russia. Creating composite photographs is rather simple, when one has the expertise, and what reason could one have for trusting a few scratched-out words on a brass plaque?\n\nNo books on military affairs were ever authored by a man of that name. He is a purely imaginary figure, concocted by bandits and traitors to legitimize their criminal activities. This... 'Pavel Batov' does not exist. He never did. Set this childish delusion aside, and heed the command of the Glavkoverkh, for Russia has more important things to worry about."
 omskreg.6.a: "What was that name again?"

 omskreg.7.t: "The Three Theses"
 omskreg.7.d: ""Ideologies," the instructor pronounced in a sharp, practiced tone, as he turned to face the classroom, "are weak. It is important that you, as officer candidates, understand that a just cause does not win wars. If this was the case, then Germany surely would have been defeated in the last war. But, instead, they won, not because of some mythical racial 'heritage,' but because their armed forces were the strongest. It is for this reason that we will not teach you ideals, but simply the observable facts upon which we base our actions. Our entire program of national salvation is founded upon a set of three tautological theses, into which we have condensed the whole of Dmitry Karbyshev's geo-strategic thought."\n\n"The first Karbyshevite thesis - the Great Trial is inevitable. It is impossible to know the true intentions of nation-states, and thus conflict between them is inevitable. And so our present tripolar arrangement is bound to collapse eventually into global conflict in the form of the Great Trial, with Russia at its geographic center."\n\n"The Second Thesis - if Russia is not prepared for the Trial, our civilization will be obliterated. To prove this, one must only look at the weapons of modern war. The next war will be total beyond any concept of totality. Eventually, nuclear weapons will be used, which, if we are not prepared to face them, will lead to our annihilation."\n\nThe instructor took a deep breath before launching into his peroration, the tone of his voice now becoming that of a fiery preacher. "And at last, the Third Thesis - the synthesis. As the only organization which has recognized this geopolitical inevitability, and the only one which is actively preparing to face it, the Black League is Russia's sole hope for survival. We will fortify our nation. And, once the guns fall silent, we will emerge from beneath the Earth to take back that which is ours, and exact our vengeance upon the Germans.""
 omskreg.7.a: "A fine performance."

 omskreg.8.t: "Memories of the Gauntlet"
 omskreg.8.d: "It was perhaps ironic that, in his moments of greatest self-questioning and insecurity, Yazov always thought back to one of the most desperate, paralyzed moments. The Gauntlet, as it had come to be known, when Yazov's fragile inheritance had been thrown in his face. The moment was crystallized in his mind - sitting there, at his desk, gunshots echoing off concrete, hot panic in his mind as animal impulses seized his heart. How he had felt paralyzed, every idea bringing forth ten counterarguments and a hundred nightmare scenarios. But it wasn't this panic that brought him back to this place time and time again.\n\nIt was how he had pulled himself out of it, against his every instinct and impulse - slowly, at first, forcing himself to follow through on his own decisions, swatting away doubt and putting faith in himself. And though he did not feel destiny's winds at his back, he knew he had to press on, success or failure.\n\nThere was no path but forward."
 omskreg.8.a: "An important lesson."

 omskreg.9.t: "Internal Affairs"
 omskreg.9.d: ""You stand before the Committee of Internal Investigation today," said one of the men seated at the large wooden desk across from where Trofim stood. Each member of the committee appeared so uncaring and stone faced that they could just as easily have been made of wax.\n\n"Do not be afraid, Trofim," said one of the other committee members. "Fear wastes time."\n\n"Listen, uh, comrades, I swear upon Russia and the great trial itself that I have been completely loyal to the cause! I have done nothing that-"\n\n"You are accused of wasting resources, Trofim. Don't lecture us about loyalty," said the first committee-man. "One of your subordinates has reported that you are a wasteful commander, and after reading the reports, they are correct. You lose approximately twenty-four percent more soldiers in combat than other squad leaders of your rank and station, and yet your accomplishments to go along with the casualties are no greater than the others. If you have evidence of your competence, speak it now."\n\n"W-well, those numbers are skewed! We were ordered to charge a machine gun nest recently and lost half our team! It was no fault of mine!"\n\n"If it was no fault of yours then your subordinate would not have reported you. My vote is guilty," said the third judge.\n\n"Seconded," said the first. "Then we are unanimous," pronounced the second."
 omskreg.9.a: "The Black League will not tolerate wasteful use of resources, even if it's lives."

 omskreg.10.t: "Program of National Action"
 omskreg.10.d: "COMRADES OF THE BLACK LEAGUE\n\nWe call all members to a PROGRAM OF NATIONAL ACTION\n\nFIRST - To ensure the continued existence of the Russian people, we must work towards instilling in people and land the STRENGTH to repel all enemies.\n\nSECOND - To ensure the UNITY required to prevent the same traitorous breakups that critically weakened Russia in the First Trial, we must destroy WARLORDISM and ensure sameness of political thought.\n\nTHIRD - To ensure that the Russian nation is unified as such, we must eliminate FOREIGN INFLUENCES and make sure that those who have betrayed our nation face appropriate justice.\n\nFOURTH - To ensure that all Russian people can be unified as such, we must RECLAIM the lost lands containing our Russian comrades.\n\nFIFTH - To ensure that the world knows the cost of the destruction that Germany has wreaked upon Russia, and the POWER of Russian vengeance, we must AVENGE our homeland against the vile Germans and their government.\n\nThe more Vasily read, the more he agreed. These were simple goals, simply put, that would restore Russia's place in the world. Perhaps the League wasn't quite as bad as he had been told. Sure, the uniforms were intimidating and some of the rumors must be true, but for such a goal... Vasily had seen the dead and watched the destruction in the West Russian War. He had even seen the breakup of the last time Russia was truly powerful.\n\nStrength, Unity, Power - these were necessary requisites for a stable nation in a world such as this. And if the costs were high... he had been willing to lay down his life in the last war to protect his nation and his family. There couldn't be anything more than that he wouldn't be willing to give. Perhaps, then, it was time to take up arms again, if the League would have him."
 omskreg.10.a: ""It's all come down to simple phrases: Do not forget! Do not forgive!""

 omskreg.11.t: "Great Trial Above All"
 omskreg.11.d: "Dmitry had found the tattered old page in a gutter in his small town. It transfixed him for some reason- the confident face of the soldier, skewering the wicked German on his bayonet. It was a feeling of power and purpose. He wanted to be the soldier, the big man of the house, the one who would save his family and his people. He did not know where his family was at the moment, and he only got by on scraps of bread or anything he could steal, but this poster promised him something more.\n\n"THE GREAT TRIAL - ALL MUST SERVE."\n\nAll meant him. It meant that he was wanted, needed by his nation to fight for the right. He wanted to be part of a new family. How desperately did he want to join the League officially, be assigned into one of those wonderful Cadres! A brotherhood of steel, ready to fight for their nation - and die if necessary.\n\nHe resolved to get the next official that came by to get him official membership. Until then, the poster would hang in his corner in the back alley behind the workshop. He would sit and look up at it, every day. The soldier, his prey, the soldier, his helmet, the soldier, his rifle. He began to pray, as he had been taught very briefly. He prayed for what he wanted - to be the soldier in THE GREAT TRIAL."
 omskreg.11.a: "All must serve."

 omskreg.12.t: "For the Future of Russia"
 omskreg.12.d: ""All loyal citizens must donate any materials they can to the war effort. You will be required to make a donation of at least half a kilogram of metal. This can be iron, aluminum, steel, or other such useful material. Come out of your homes immediately and report to the town center with your items for donation."\n\nThe truck with the loudspeaker kept trundling past barely standing, ramshackle houses and towards the church. As soon as it arrived, the officer driving was presented with quite a scene - a soldier pointing his rifle, bayonet fixed, at a priest holding out his cross. They were conversing rather tersely with each other.\n\n"The people here have been ushered, from cradle to grave, by this bell, and you shall not have it! I cannot allow it, even on my life!"\n\nThe priest spoke with a religious fervor, but the rifleman was adamant. As he should be. The officer walked slowly up, not bothering to unholster his pistol.\n\n"The Black League requires this material for the war effort. We will dismantle it, whether you like it or not."\n\n"Over my dead body!" Replied the priest.\n\n"If that is necessary. I do not believe that it will be." The officer motioned for the men to climb the tower. The priest blocked the door with his arms. The men held out their rifles - would they shoot? No. The officer looked at the priest, looked at the men, then grabbed the priest by the scruff of the neck and threw him into the mud.\n\n"Proceed. And do not delay like this with the rest of collections. We move to the next town by sundown.""
 omskreg.12.a: "The history of Russia, melted away."

 omskreg.13.t: "The Directorate Sees All"
 omskreg.13.d: "The two intelligence officers sat in the van close by to the blocky apartment. They had no extra rations to eat, and no more cigarettes (those had disappeared after the first two hours). Now they sat here, doing nothing but listen through their oversized headphones to the bug under the former colonel's table.\n\nThis was the third day they had been stuck here, doing essentially nothing. But supposedly, this man had information on a secret project he had been working on for almost a year before the Black League had taken over here. The only records they could find were of a "Top secret Special Device" that "when used, could incapacitate a man for up to 30 minutes without him realizing a thing". Its codename was "Katya". Naturally, such a device was of great interest to the Internal Security Directorate, and so they had been staked out here.\n\nThe officers' ears perked up when they heard the door open. They listened more closely, hearing each creak in the floorboards.\n\n"There you are, my dear Katya. It is so cold out there, I don't know how I could get warm..."\n\nThe two officers looked at each other. One slammed their headphones down on the side table.\n\n"You've got to be kidding me.""
 omskreg.13.a: ""Remember - Top secret, my dear Katya.""

 omskreg.14.t: "A Quiet Rage"
 omskreg.14.d: "Yazov stared at the map spread across the table in front of him. It depicted the Black League's best understanding of the current situation in Russia. To the east and west the other contenders for control over Russia were splayed across the landscape, representing how far the League still had to go. To the south the states of the southern Urals continued to persist despite all odds, waiting to be swallowed by one of the behemoths around them. In the middle of it all was the West Siberian Provisional Authority, a bastion of order and duty surrounded by treachery.\n\nOptimism was a luxury Yazov did not afford himself, but some part of him had hoped that once western Siberia was unified the road to unification would be easy. Instead the League had been forced to grapple with rebellions and dissent. Rebuilding Russian society to be ready for the Great Trial had been time consuming, but necessary. While the Black League was working to pull its portion of Russia out of the darkness and prepare for the storm that was coming, the warlords around them had expanded their territory and consolidated their hold over vast stretches of the Motherland. Dislodging them would not be easy.\n\nYazov took solace in the strength of the League. In less than a decade it had grown from a corrupt and disorganized organization confined to a single city into a colossus ready to reunite the nation and bring justice to those who have wronged the Russian people. The armies of the League could not be stopped by even the mightiest opponents. Soon the time for national reunification would come, and the black tide would sweep across Russia, wiping away the weakness and degeneracy that had infested it for too long. It would not be a joyful event. It was the League's grim responsibility to rebuild the Motherland and punish those who weakened her. Yazov knew there would not be time for celebrating once Russia was whole again. He would have to make do with the satisfaction of knowing the traitors were all dead, and the final confrontation with the true enemy in the west could begin at last."

 omskreg.15.d: "To run an economy most efficiently, one must model the economy after the command infrastructure of an army. Logistics must be maintained - supply lines must be held, quotas must be met, and the appropriate people distributed according to their abilities. All must work as parts in the great war machine of our economy, and to oversee this, the State Development Directorate will use all appropriate measures to ensure efficiency.\n\nIndustrial cadres must meet efficiency and work quotas. Farming cadres must produce enough to keep our soldiers on the front lines fed and our industrial workers running smoothly. Growth must be maintained in all sectors according to needed advances in production of all goods and supplies. All work must be subsumed under the banner of our eternal struggle. We will accomplish this through the same discipline and organization that we would show if we were soldiers on the front.\n\nThough the men and women behind desks with typewriters may seem innocuous, they are vital to securing the future of Russia and should not be overlooked- nor can they overlook their own duties.\n\nFor to be a soldier in the Great Trial means many things."

 omskreg.16.d: "The officer looked over the roster for cadre 602981. It was always difficult to actually fill out the 80 people required, and now was worse than ever. Luckily, a new batch had come in. He didn't really care where they came from anymore, as long as they were able enough and willing to work hard.\n\n"All those not currently assigned to cadre 602981, please step forward."\n\n32 people were counted. Mostly young boys, barely out of their Youth Cadre. But, they would do. They never really seemed too eager about being on an industrial line making tools or guns or clothes, but it was always hard to tell what the reason for that was.\n\nSome were afraid of battle, understandably so. Those were the small, pinched faces he saw staring up at him. But others were furious at missing the opportunity to do what they now viewed as their nation's most honored duty. These were the angled brows, the staring eyes, and the clenched jaws. With enough solid work, who knows what might happen. An infantry or command cadre, in time. But for now, they would serve their nation in the rapidly expanding industrial cadres that would bring Omsk to parity with its neighbors, and eventually the whole of Russia."

The military transport behind him sputtered in anticipation of carrying the villagers off.\n\n"What's a cadre?" asked a slack jawed local.\n\n"Resistance will be treated as treason," clarified the soldier.\n\n"Will we be coming back?" whimpered a little girl.\n\nOddly, the leaguesman seemed to soften upon hearing the child's voice, and he knelt down to speak with her.\n\n"Resistance will be treated as treason," he said, reassuringly, before ruffling her hair and standing back up. "You have three hours to gather your belongings and board the truck. Failure to return at that time will be treated as resistance."\n\n"And resistance will be treated as treason," groaned several villagers in unison."

Konstantin had wanted to make sure his bureau was getting value for money, and decided to investigate what they needed a land survey for.\n\nNavigating the complex web of bureaucracy had only become more difficult under the management of the Black League, but Konstantin had applied the same single-track determination to this task that had seen him rise rapidly through the ranks since their takeover. While he turned up several other instances of high sums directed towards "Land Survey & Related Activities", he could never seem to track down where the money went. In the end, he'd had to call in a favor with his brother-in-law at the State Development Directorate to get a physical address. Now that he had it safely written down, maybe he'd finally get to the bottom of things.\n\nThe morning after Konstantin's visit to the Directorate, there was a strange man in his bedroom when he woke up. As Konstantin scrambled to make sense of the situation, the intruder politely invited him to get dressed and join him for breakfast. "Please have some tea," the man began, as Konstantin sat down opposite him. "Konstantin Aleksandrovich, by all accounts a great servant to Russia and the Black League," he continued, "It would be a loss for everyone if something was to happen to you.

In the old days the infantry were hardly more than ditch diggers and military fortification builders, with a few more seasoned teams that would hunt bandits, naturally.\n\nThat had been Karbyshev's plan. Dig in. Prepare for a day when war would be upon them. Rodian had known it was a naive plan, he had always known that no victory could be won as a hermit state. It was the sole reason that Rodian was still alive, while the rest of the old guard had died during Yazov's ascension.\n\nRodian eyed the instructor, teaching tactics Karbyshev would never have thought to teach them.

 omskreg.24.d: "Vorobyov smirked at the recruits standing naked and shivering in the barracks. The cadre's older men were arrayed in parallel rows facing one another, forming a corridor from one end of the hall to the other. Each man held in his hand something blunt and painful - truncheons, sticks, leather belts, soap in socks, among others. Vorobyov stepped up to the head of the line where the recruits were standing. Some put on a show of defiance, others covered themselves in shame. "It's quite simple, kids," he said with false cheer and a knowing smile. "What you're going to do is run down between 'em one by one and try to reach the end without falling over or giving up. You do either, and they'll beat seven shades of shit outta you. Maybe we'll throw you to the boys next door. They like 'em young, you know." The soldiers snickered. Malevolent intent was palpable in the frigid air.\n\n"Alright, go!" Vorobyov shouted, slapping the nearest recruit on the shoulder with a hand missing some of its fingers. "Run, shitbird!" As soon as the recruit entered the gauntlet, the bludgeons began to descend. The sound of blows raining upon his bare skin turned the others pale. Halfway down the line, he toppled to the floor with blood running from a split forehead, and the cadre descended. Like a pack of wolves, they surrounded his prone form and tore into him. The barrage of blows lasted mere seconds, but by its end he was unmoving - alive, but barely.\n\n"Fuck this!" blurted another recruit, dashing for the barracks door. The cadre's eyes settled upon him as he ran. He wrenched the door open, heedless of the cold outside - and came face to face with a burly sergeant. "Sergeant, thank God!" He turned to point at the cadre behind him with a trembling finger. "Sir, they... they're going to fucking kill us, sir! Please-"\n\n"Get back in there, you pussy," growled the sergeant. He produced his own truncheon and smiled. "Believe me, I'm worse.""

 omskreg.25.t: "Life at the Vorkuta Training Camp"
 omskreg.25.d: "Yevgeniy startled to his feet when the truck beneath him jerked to a halt, wrestling him from the one place where he felt any respite: sleep. Selected for supplemental training, he knew the drive down the potholed roads of Siberia would be his last opportunity for rest. Joining the ranks of his weary comrades, he rubbed his eyes. As he opened them, he saw just mere feet away a stout but authoritative figure, staring into his eyes with a scowl. Next thing he was on the ground, the jackboot of the same man now firmly lodged in his chest. Hazed, Yevgeniy's vision faltered until it faded to darkness.\n\n"Get up you, you son of a bitch!" This time, instead of on his chest, the boot was kicking his side. Biting his lip through the pain, Yevgeniy slowly got back on his feet, listening as the man continued to bark out every possible obscenity at him. Seconds later, he stood in ranks as men marched into Vorkuta, surrounded by barbed-wire fencing.\n\nThe first days there were hell. The beatings continued incessantly, with nothing but arduous work and drilling to break up what seemed like constant pain. Those too bruised went to the glorified morgue of a "hospital" and few ever returned.\n\nIn the second week, as his group was on a ten-mile run, Yevgeniy spotted a carrot in the dirt. Knowing better than to run to get it, Yevgeniy tried to ignore the orange beauty that his malnourished body yearned for. With only two small meals, he wanted nothing more than to devour it. As they neared it, he caved. Breaking formation and shoving his comrade out of his way, he fell on the ground clutching the carrot. In a flurry of shouts, kicks, and strikes from a baton, Yevgeniy finally got his sleep.\n\nThe camp at Vorkuta came to be known as the Fang for its unrelenting training style and harsh management. Within a month of the first arrivals coming in, 25 had died of injuries sustained during training."
 omskreg.25.a: "Such is the price we pay to prepare for the Great Trial."

 omskreg.26.t: "Showing Off"
 omskreg.26.d: ""Comrades!" boomed the drill sergeant's voice. "Glavkoverkh Yazov is here!" Men leapt up from their exercises and dropped everything. Within three seconds, every single man in the training hall was standing at attention, eyes straight ahead. "Atten-tion!" As one, a hundred heads turned to the doorway and arms snapped up in salutes. Then, in came the Glavkoverkh, as though he were a civilian wandering into a shop on a lazy Sunday.\n\n"As you were, comrades," said Yazov, his face an unreadable half-smile. Within a heartbeat, every man had resumed his previous activities, unquestioning of their leader's sudden laxity. Yazov began to stroll through the hall at a leisurely pace, looking left to right with the drill sergeant and two armed guards at his back. He paused before a group of men engaged in rapid, relentless push-ups.\n\n"How long have these men been going, sergeant?" he asked, his tone neutral.\n\n"My apologies, sir, but I've no idea. Corporal Rykov is leading them, though."\n\n"Corporal Rykov, at attention!" called Yazov. A giant of a man leapt to his feet and snapped to, stone-faced and straight-backed. "How many push-ups have you fellows performed today, Corporal?"\n\nDespite towering over Yazov, the man swallowed. "I'm not certain, sir. We measure ourselves in time rather than individual actions. Currently we stand at thirteen minutes straight."\n\nYazov tapped his chin. "Explain your reasoning for this, Corporal."\n\n"Sir! Because endurance is best measured in years, not footsteps, sir!"\n\nYazov nodded, content. "Very good, Corporal. You know our ethos well. Carry on.""

 omskreg.27.t: "A Hateful Heart"
 omskreg.27.d: ""Who are we, brothers?" roared the man at the column's head.\n\n"We are the Black League! We are Russia!" they replied.\n\n"What is our purpose?"\n\n"To kill the German!"\n\n"How far will we go?"\n\n"Even to our dying breath!" came the roar. Loudest of all was Pavel, his voice bearing a harsh edge born of hate. Hate was what fueled him, what gave him purpose. It had become him, transformed into a raging inferno when the foul German bandits of Orsk took his village and burned it to ash. For years he had wandered, living off the land, sustained by the Motherland's gifts. The day the Black League had found him scrounging for food amongst the dead was the day that had made him who he was today. The League had taken him in, honed the uncontrollable fire in his soul into a searing blade of vengeance. Someday, when the League took the fight to Germany, he would be unleashed. When a German boy had suffered as he had, seen his mother defiled, his siblings butchered like swine, his home reduced to cinders - only then would justice be done."
 omskreg.27.a: "Kill, kill and only kill."

 omskreg.28.t: "Fortress Kosvinsky Kamen"
 omskreg.28.d: "All Yazov saw was a big flat rock in the middle of nowhere. But this was to be the last bastion of the Russian people. The new command center here, under Kosvinsky Kamen, would ensure that nothing could stop the final plans for revenge on Germany. The earth would absorb the blows from even the strongest nuclear weapons, and those sheltered inside would survive, to emerge as avenging angels for the motherland.\n\nConstruction had already begun some time ago, and he could just barely make out the massive concrete and steel circular doorway that led deep into the mountain. All of Omsk had experienced being underground at one point or another, but no subterranean structure would truly compare to this operation.\n\nHe thought of what Karbyshev would say if he saw this, and what his little state had become. For some reason, it turned his stomach. A wriggling doubt in the back of his mind told him that something was off. He remembered the doubts he heard from Karbyshev just before his death, and his words about right and wrong. They left a sour taste in his mouth as he walked towards what was to be his wonder of the world. Surely, Karbyshev would agree that this was necessary. Surely, he was doing the right thing for Russia."
 omskreg.28.a: "Such thoughts cannot be entertained."

 omskreg.29.t: "The League's Youth"
 omskreg.29.d: "Andrey loved school.\n\nHis teachers pushed him hard, he knew, but that was important if he was to help ensure national survival. Every person living within the League's territory, even those as young as him, needed to learn, needed to prepare, if the Great Trial was to be overcome. And Andrey intended, with every fibre of his being, to be ready.\n\nIn between his ordinary classes on language, mathematics, and the like, he received instruction on the principles of the league.\n\nIn the morning, he learned about the visionary foresight of General Karbyshev and his preparation for the first national programs of action. In the afternoon, he learned about how he could better shape himself to help, with ever increasing effectiveness, the purification, reclamation, and vengeance inherent to the other programs.\n\nEvery day - one more day closer to the Great Trial - he learned more, understood more, and became more prepared.\n\nHe had even begun applying his lessons outside of school, watching carefully for evidence of revisionism or insufficient dedication. He had already identified several such individuals, and though he could of course not be sure what happened after his reports, at least two had, so far, not been seen since. And deservedly so.\n\nAndrey intended to protect himself, his family, his people, and the Black League, and he would not be deterred from any course of action that would advance any of those goals.\n\nThat was what his teachers had taught him, and Andrey very much loved school."
 omskreg.29.a: "To overcome the Great Trial, loyalty must be ensured from a young age."

 omskdiplo.1.d: "West Siberian Provisional Authority Foreign Ministry internal memo no.0001\n\nIf you have received this memo, it means you have been shortlisted to serve your mother country in the new foreign ministry. Offices are being prepared in western Omsk and you will be notified when you are required. Starting immediately, you are required to begin your planning around the key diplomatic issues facing the League, and be ready to present solutions.\n\nIssue no.1 Foreign relations and legitimacy for our authority: Goodwill is a meaningless fiction, but if we allow the Americans and the Japanese to believe us to be a hostile or threatening regime then we will soon find our rivals to be meeting us on the field with foreign guns in hand and volunteers at their backs. Additionally, any embargoes must be strangled in the cradle, especially on goods that will be needed to prepare for the great trial.\n\nIssue no.2 As the great maw of the Black League opens up to an unsuspecting world, naive humanitarians will flood into our territory to 'help'. We need to ensure they are monitored, that they find nothing they should not, and that every scrap of value is extracted from their visit.\n\nIssue no.3 The German menace casts a long shadow over Russia, and we need to cow them into inaction until we are truly prepared for the trial.\n\nIssue no.4 Many of the illegitimate warlords have grown too paranoid toward us to make infiltration a straightforward task. We need to choose new and vulnerable victims we can begin spying on."

 omskdiplo.2.t: "Operation Potemkin - Briefing"
 omskdiplo.2.d: ""All of you are aware of the many failures of the First Trial. We must learn from these, and adapt to our new circumstances. One of these failures was poor relations between Russia and the Western powers. When alliances against the Germans needed to be formed, they backed away. When aid needed to be sent, they did not send enough. When the time came for all nations to stand strong against the madmen, the world failed.\n\nJustice will come to those who abandoned Russia in her hour of greatest need. That is not why I have called you here today. I am here to announce Operation Potemkin. This operation, conducted by our propaganda departments as well as our Directorate of Foreign Activities, will ensure that those who do not understand the measures we must take are either not aware of them, or are convinced of their necessity.\n\nThis means giving a new face to the Black League. One of strength, yes, to deter aggression. But also one of peace. One of security. We must focus on the people, and how safe and fulfilled they are at being part of a great nation. We must pretend to be as hedonistic and narcissistic as those in the West.\n\nWe must also reassure our potential enemies that our goals do not stretch beyond the borders of Russia. The Japanese would certainly be nervous about a resurgent Russia. They must be calmed. The Germans would naturally be furious about the rise of a strong power once again in the East. They must be deceived and distracted.\n\nGentlemen, we must act quickly as reunification continues. Details on assignments can be found on page five, budgetary matters on page thirteen. Good hunting.""

 omskdiplo.3.t: "The West Siberian Provisional Authority Reaches Out"
 omskdiplo.3.d: "It was the CIA who pressured the foreign ministry into accepting the obscure West Siberian Provisional Authority's abrupt offer to invite American diplomats to a conference in the capital city of Omsk. Foreign affairs had initially deemed it to be too dangerous, especially considering that up until now Omsk and its surrounding territory has been an informational black hole. This, more than anything, is what led to CIA pressure to attend.\n\nA few CIA agents disguised as bodyguards attended the conference with the curious diplomats last week, and reported that the situation in Omsk appeared surprisingly... normal.\n\nThe government had clearly done hasty work to beautify the city center and refurbish an old hotel for diplomatic use, but such a thing was hardly out of the ordinary when American officials visited developing nations.\n\nTruthfully, most were impressed at how well the local government had patched over the cracks of war and decay, and found it to be an excellent sign of the government's effectiveness.\n\nThe only dissenting opinion of this rather pleasant assessment was from an older agent, who insisted there was something off about the people's smiles - something dead and rotten in their eyes.\n\nRegardless of his paranoia, the conference went rather well, with diplomats being well fed with local cuisine and well watered with vodka. They were even given the honour of meeting the ever busy Dmitry Yazov, who the diplomats found to be a very impressive figure. They assure us that, while he wasn't democratically elected, he seems to be a 'developmental authoritarian', using his unchecked executive power to turn a backwards region around for the better before transitioning to democracy. The West Siberian request was hardly unexpected, they merely wished for OFN recognition of their government as a sovereign state.\n\nWe hardly have any reason not to accept."
 omskdiplo.3.a: "Give them their recognition, but warn Americans that the region is still a war zone."
 omskdiplo.3.b: "No, I trust that agent's gut. There's something black brewing in the heart of Omsk."

 omskdiplo.4.t: "United States Recognition"
 omskdiplo.4.d: "There was some worry that we were overselling the performance to the American diplomats, but our theatrics did their job.\n\n"What a nice people," said one diplomat before being loaded back into his jet. "I hope they turn things around and rebuild."\n\nAs the Americans leave, the plastered smiles in the city center all fall back into the resolute scowls that have made permanent homes upon the faces of our citizens. We came off just as planned, just a simple poor country trying hard to make a good impression. In the eyes of America, and therefore the OFN, we are just what we want to be: forgettable.\n\nWe receive a call from their foreign office a week after they returned to their decadent homeland. Our request has been accepted."
 omskdiplo.4.a: "We'll take it as a sign that the Americans will stay neutral."

 omskdiplo.5.t: "The Americans Close Diplomatic Channels!"
 omskdiplo.5.d: "Though we clearly fooled the majority of the fat and ignorant diplomats with our performance as a third world nation trying a little too-hard to make a good impression, there was one man who clearly saw right through us.\n\nWe weren't foolish enough to assume the CIA wouldn't have a presence at the conference, in fact, we planned for it. A CIA that believed us to be insignificant would report that we are no threat, and thus spend their resources elsewhere.\n\nWe politely ignored the overly curious 'bodyguards' whose performances couldn't hold a flame to the impenetrable wall of deceit we laid upon them.\n\nAnd yet, one of those damned agents didn't believe a word we said. Staring, scowling, and whispering to his fellows the entire conference.\n\nHe must have gotten through to someone, for not long after they returned to their gilded shithole of a country we received a call informing us that our request was denied and that we were not to contact their ministry again.\n\nA wave of finger pointing has engulfed the foreign ministry, and several officials who were in charge of the deception have been removed from their posts."
 omskdiplo.5.a: "Line up a firing squad for those at fault. This will not happen again."

 omskdiplo.6.t: "The West Siberian Provisional Authority Opens Their Doors"
 omskdiplo.6.d: "At first, our foreign office had merely laughed when the obscure Russian state sent an envoy asking to host several of our diplomats in their capitol of Omsk. The diplomat would have been laughed out of Japan entirely, were it not for an opportune meeting he managed to arrange with a prominent businessman. He loudly implied that once Russia is unified, they'd be inclined to offer some extremely lucrative mineral rights deals to the Zaibatsu - in exchange for a few minor diplomatic concessions now.\n\nNews of this rapidly spread throughout the business world, and soon the diplomatic office was under significant pressure to accept the offer.\n\nThe conference was of little consequence. The little Russian men had clearly gone to great effort to renovate the city center for our diplomats, but were horrendously embarrassed when a wrong turn on the way from the airport led the mission on a detour through the dirty industrial district of the city. A business expert assigned to the diplomatic team reportedly grew insatiably excited after spotting the vast reserves of Siberian resources laid out in endless stockpiles.\n\nThe concessions requested by the West Siberians were mostly minimal, the largest demand being an official recognition of them as a legitimate and sovereign nation.\n\nWhile we have no guarantee that the West Siberians will actually come out on top of the Russian conflicts, it's a very small request compared to a potentially enormous economic gain."
 omskdiplo.6.a: "They're desperate for international legitimacy. Give it to them, we'll be paid well if they succeed."
 omskdiplo.6.b: "Deny their request. It looks far too good to be true."

 omskdiplo.7.t: "The Empire of Japan Recognizes Us!"
 omskdiplo.7.d: "The Japanese are the great vulture of Asia. Their imperial addiction drives a great hunger in their bellies, a craving for resources that can be easily taken from the backwards people of lesser nations.\n\nIt was hardly a difficult deception to make the Japanese think we were one such opportunity. We needed to make no promises, only implying that we'd be happy to integrate into their economic sphere once unified, in exchange for international recognition. Wishful thinking took them far enough to think we might actually go through with the insulting plan. This was enough to get their interest, and an 'accidental' detour of the delegation into an industrial stockpile of resources we'd trucked in from all over our territory had them so enchanted that they gave us everything we wanted.\n\nWith Japan now officially recognising us, we can trust that they, along with their wretched East Asian puppets, will stay neutral in our unification struggles."
 omskdiplo.7.a: "Success."

 omskdiplo.8.t: "Japan Refuses to Recognize Us!"
 omskdiplo.8.d: "Disaster strikes our negotiations with the Japanese. Though the fat Zaibatsu look upon our grand state with nothing but hunger, they've failed to pressure their government into recognising us.\n\nOur ploy had been an expensive one, trucking resources into Omsk from all over our territory, and 'accidently' detouring the Japanese delegation through the stockpile to whet their plunderous appetites.\n\nThe business representatives sent along fell for our ploy, but it seems the actual diplomats did not.\n\nWe've received a call from the Japanese foreign office informing us that our requests have been denied, and they've issued a formal complaint against our 'con artist diplomacy.'\n\nMany in charge of the plot have been reported by their subordinates for incompetence and leadership restructuring is underway to prevent such failures within the ministry again."
 omskdiplo.8.a: "Unfortunate."

 omskdiplo.9.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]America Recognizes the Omsk Government!"
 omskdiplo.9.d: "In a surprising move, the Americans have announced today that they will be formally recognizing the West Siberian Provisional Authority as a legitimate Russian nation state. Little was previously known about the isolated Siberian state, even by the standards of Russia, but a recent diplomatic mission sent by the Americans found the government to be a very amicable potential partner in the region.\n\nState officials have gotten ahead of the criticism for working with the dictator, Dmitry Yazov, citing him as a 'developmental authoritarian' who is merely acting as head of the country until Russian unification is complete.\n\nDmitry Yazov has made promises of responsible military action over the unification wars to come, along with a speedy transition to democracy afterwards.\n"
 omskdiplo.9.a: "Omsk seems like a nice place to visit."

 omskdiplo.10.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Japan Recognizes the Omsk Government"
 omskdiplo.10.d: "International observers were baffled this afternoon when the Japanese government issued a statement this morning recognizing the enigmatic West Siberian territory as a lawful and sovereign nation state.\n\nCritiques of the move come in large part due to the thick shroud of secrecy surrounding the Omsk-based government.\n\nThe move is taken by many to be economically motivated as the West Siberians have reportedly offered favourable trade terms to the Japanese upon the day of unification. Already the Zaibatsu are drafting plans to move in and exploit Russian resources, but they are pragmatic enough to know that they'll need to wait until the wars have wrapped up - lest they lose their investments to marauding warlords.\n"
 omskdiplo.10.a: "Is Omsk open for business?"

 omskdiplo.11.t: "The Red Cross in Omsk"
 omskdiplo.11.d: "As expected, now that we've opened up contact with the outside world, requests to offer humanitarian aid to our populace have begun to arrive with our Foreign Ministry. Preparations have already been made for these useful idiots. A compound near Omsk has been set up for the Red Cross to share with a few Catholic organizations, and they'll be arriving soon.\n\nGuides have been carefully chosen from the ranks of our special forces. They'll provide a smiling face for the foreigners, and give us plenty of notice as to where the humanitarians are planning on heading next. A team of prudent specialists will be moving ahead of the aid caravans, preparing the site and the locals to survive against the international scrutiny.\n\nAny villagers with 'loose lips' that are found to be in the path of the foreigners will be quickly relocated to work camps to avoid any regrettable leaks.\n\nSome in the league aren't certain any of this is worth the risk, but it's hard to say no to free vaccines and foreign planners setting up emergency preparedness protocols in the countryside, even if the pretentious notion that they're here to 'lift us out of poverty,' is an insulting one."
 omskdiplo.11.a: "We'll watch them carefully."

 omskdiplo.12.t: "The Red Cross' Contribution"
 omskdiplo.12.d: "Ivan sighed as the American doctors left the village in their small caravan of jeeps. They had been pleasant to deal with, more pleasant than anyone had expected. The government warned them to be on their best behaviour, and they had done so. Russia didn't have people like those Red Cross workers anymore - people with big hearts and bright smiles.\n\nIt was infectious, the town found itself smiling despite themselves, singing songs and drinking vodka in the foreign camp at night.\n\nThe children had been inoculated against diseases, and Ivan was glad that his own daughter might have a better chance at life thanks to their actions.\n\nNo sooner than they disappeared over the horizon, did the Black League special forces team step out of the forest. Ivan felt his heart drop. The pleasant dream the Americans had brought with them had left with their caravan.\n\n"An acceptable performance," growled an officer in a commissar hat. "What did they leave behind?"\n\nFor a single suicidal moment, Ivan thought about lying, about hiding the medical supplies, the water purification equipment, the school books. With a reluctant sigh, Ivan handed over the rough scrawled inventory list he'd made. The officer scanned through it and nodded.\n\n"We'll have a truck here in a half hour, have a few men on hand to help us load it all up.""
 omskdiplo.12.a: ""We will put their aid to good use.""

 omskdiplo.13.t: "Darkness from the East"
 omskdiplo.13.d: "The Gestapo serving in the eastern Reichskommissariats have reported a suspicious number of incidents. Nothing major has happened, but there's been far too many incidents of civilians 'accidentally' stumbling into secure areas, plans and documents disappearing, and strangers appearing in towns unannounced for this to all be a coincidence. Someone is planning something, and our Gestapo are tearing their hair out trying to understand what's going on.\n\nThose we arrested are either innocent of wrongdoing or hardened infiltrators that can hold up under difficult interrogations. The locals seem to know nothing of what's going on either, and no amount of threats of collective punishment or preemptive raids have turned up any information whatsoever on the anomalous activity.\n\nThe only conclusion we can draw is that a foreign organization is moving into the territory, but who they are or what they're planning is anyone's guess."
 omskdiplo.13.a: "Put local forces on high alert. We don't need to know who they are to be able to stop them."

You may build your petty bunkers to try to ride out the coming storm, you may prepare your tainted armies for war, but know that the stain of your criminality will be burned from this earth, whatever the cost. There is no shelter from the justice we deliver, and no promise of compromise that we will respect. To all those who thought themselves safe from the consequences of their actions, this we swear: German cruelty will be repaid.\n\nYour Führer has lied to you. He claims to be the heir of your criminal regime that has pillaged Russia and committed unspeakable acts in its victory, yet to not have any involvement in such crimes. He promises a brighter future by reversing the policies that he himself brought to fruition. He promises you absolution, while hiding his own guilt. Know that there is no pretense of reform you can hide behind, and no words that can erase what your nation has done. To all those who seek clemency in lies, this we swear: Germany's sins have not been forgotten.\n\nAll of Russia is joining together to face the menace that haunts our Motherland.

We, the Russian people, have endured far worse than you, and will forever endure. Unlike you, we do not seek to destroy, we seek to protect. For our children, and our children's children, we build our Motherland into a fortress that shall never fall. We dig into the earth to build our bunkers as we shall dig to build your graves. To all those who seek glory here, this we swear: We will bury you.\n\nYour Führer promises you ultimate victory. He draws lines on his map and claims the earth as his domain. Know this: Russia is no longer a prize to be claimed. The Black League will make it so.

To all those who seek to devour our land, this we swear: Never again shall Russia be stolen from its people.\n\nAll of Russia shall unite to face its impending doom, and all of Russia shall overcome it. Soon, the nation you dismissed as shattered will become whole once more. The Black League will make it so. In doing so, we shall end your murderous reign. We invite you, German, to the land you have pillaged and desecrated, that we might avenge our fathers and our country. To the vile nation whose blood shall soon flow in our rivers, this we swear:"

Your tainted country deserves far worse, but justice shall come soon enough. The Black League will make it so. Your colonies shall crumble into memory, and in its place shall spring new and free nations that will erase your mark on this world. To all those who attempt to deny this justice, we swear: You will reap what you have sown.\n\nYour Führer denies an inconvenient reality. He tells you that all is well, so long as you serve him, but your crumbling country can no longer support its own weight. You have felt the ground shake under your feet, and seen your buildings fall to ruin, yet still he claims that there is no such quaking, and that all might be normal again. These delusions will not save you. Nothing can. You have oppressed too many for too long for the world to forget your crimes. To all those who remain blind to their failures, we swear: You will be made to see.\n\nAll of Russia remembers what you have done, and all of Russia will visit vengeance upon you. Soon, the nation you have tried to destroy shall rise again to crush you. We shall wipe the stain of your murderous ideology off the face of history.

 omskdiplo.19.t: "The Spider's Web"
 omskdiplo.19.d: "Aleksandr slumped down in his chair and stared at the ceiling. It had been a busy day - talking to agents, organizing intel, reporting to Yazov personally. But progress had been made. He was very pleased with how the Black League's tendrils were creeping into every adjacent warlord they could get into. Finally, he had a real intelligence organization, not the scratch group of operatives he used to deal with. Confiscating files of conquered warlords naturally supplemented his own work, and so the Director of Foreign Activities was ready for the next step.\n\nBut who? To the East, with their political chicanery and nearly unlimited potential for meddling? Or further than that, to the Soviet states who had forgotten their place in history? Perhaps west, to their old comrades, or to the insane asylum - it was getting hard to tell these days.\n\nEither way, he had a lot of work to do tomorrow. The next great step in their network would have to be made, in concert with the army. The ground must be laid for unification, and much of that burden would naturally fall on him. He didn't mind. Because from this small office, with its uncomfortable chair and desk that was far too small for his needs, he could spy on every man, woman and child from Finland to Irkutsk. He closed his eyes to rest for a few minutes."

 omskdiplo.20.t: "The Foundations Laid"
 omskdiplo.20.d: "Foreign Ministry Status Report no.0017\n\nThe first round of our diplomatic efforts have come to their natural conclusion and are ready for review.\n\n-The diplomatic facilities have all been completed and renovated for use. We now have city centres that appear civilized to outsiders, hotels for diplomats, offices for our diplomatic core and meeting chambers that can host negotiations. While the ministry has additional ideas to entice and ensnare foreign support, we now have all we need to lull the outside world into complacency.\n\n-Diplomatic outreaches, regardless of how successful they were, have breached through the static and have established contact with the outside world. At the very least, military planners are confident that outsiders will contact us with words now, rather than bombs.\n\n-The Reich has received a statement of our intent, and their paranoia has already begun to work in favour of our plans. The militarists have spent decades searching for an enemy, and now that they've found one in us, they've begun to overplay their hand, spreading discord through their blood-soaked empire, aided by the infiltrators we've sent into their borders.\n\n-Finally, on the local scale we've ramped up our intelligence operations, and we now have sympathetic ears ready and willing to aid our armies on the field in the unification wars to come."
 omskdiplo.20.a: "Realpolitik at its best."

 omskdiplo.21.t: "The Lycurgus of Russia"
 omskdiplo.21.d: ""To describe Yazov is not to describe a traditional political figure in a modern sense - his policies are unconventional, his ideological underpinnings vast and lacking the crude labels of 'left' or 'right'. If he represents anything at all, he represents order and nation, stability and strength, in terms that can easily be understood by the average man and woman of Russia. And, of course, to be prepared against future aggression from Germany, with a major focus on mass armament. While this may seem like his end goal, it is in reality a way to maintain public support, and to create a shared sense of unity among the Russian people. He is bringing a new order to Russia, as Solon did to Athens or to Lycurgus or Sparta, a figure that cares for his people above all else, and wishes to create a nation that will outlive him."\n\nThe following was written by Samual Huntington, a political scientist who has spent many months in our territory, researching the economic and social system of our nation. His article, published in various outlets throughout America and the Free World, has already made waves, as many nations are reconsidering their prior stances on us.\n\nThis may prove useful, especially considering the necessity of additional resources and contacts in these nations. While distasteful, it would prove useful in defeating both our enemies in Russia and in the eventual conclusion of the Great Trial."
 omskdiplo.21.a: "Lycurgus of Russia? I like the sound of that."

 omskdiplo.22.t: "A Simple Deal"
 omskdiplo.22.d: "Lieutenant Morozov and the other Black League officials had already taken their seats by the time they arrived. A group of Japanese businessmen in expensive suits sat down across the long table from a group of stone-faced officials in full uniform. The meeting room was fairly dark, the singular lightbulb not quite strong enough to illuminate both ends of the table. Once the businessmen were seated, the head of the delegation was the first to speak, their translator allowing Morozov and the other officials to understand his words, "We understand that you have an offer you wish to put forward?"\n\nMorozov nodded, and pushed forward a document which had been translated into Japanese before the meeting had begun, "Indeed. We offer you a simple deal. You will receive the procurement of resource rights in West Siberia, although any extraction using those rights will also be under the supervision of Black League officials. and in exchange we'll receive further military aid from the Empire of Japan. That is all we ask for on behalf of the Black League. Is that agreeable to your delegation?"\n\nThe translator soon finished Morozov's brief speech, and the businessmen quietly discussed the offer. Eventually, the head of the business delegation replied, "We find your offer agreeable. We'll accept your offer."\n\nAfter a few trivial matters were hammered out, and some paperwork signed, the Japanese businessmen turned to leave the room. Once their backs were turned, Morozov couldn't help but smirk."
 omskdiplo.22.a: "How blind they are, to the truth of things to come."

 omsksr.1.t: "One, Indivisible, and Invincible"
 omsksr.1.d: "Glavkoverkh Yazov, head of the Black League and savior of the Russian people, stood stoic at the podium. He looked down at his prepared remarks, and found them wanting. They were merely words on a page. He would give the world more than an announcement. He would give them a declaration.\n\n"To all the heroes of Russia assembled here today..." He started off a bit shaky, his voice a little too monotonal over the microphone.\n\n"There have been many who have told us of our imminent failure. Many who have doubted the will and strength of a people long under assault. Many who fear what we might become. They know nothing of the sacrifices the Russian people have been forced to make in the name of survival. But we know, comrades. We know all too well what was lost in the First Trial, and we know now what must be done."\n\nHe began to speed up. His clenched hand wrapped around the podium, and he leaned forward.\n\n"Russia must be made strong again, and the Russian people with it. We must do this for our own survival, and we cannot expect help from abroad. But the inner strength of our nation, of the people themselves, is a bottomless resource, and it has been tested time, and time again. We must use that now to construct a new Russia from the ashes of the old, and do whatever is necessary to ensure that it survives forevermore."\n\n"At stake is everything you know, and the survival of every man, woman, and child in Russia. For if we were to fail, and let the German reconquer what he wills, or let the weaklings around us take power, the world will never again make the mistake of letting the Russian people reunite. But we will not fail. For that, I depend- Russia depends- on your courage and skill."\n\nHe relaxed as he wound down. His hand unclenched, he stood straight, and spoke softly.\n\n"Know that each of you pushes forward the day that we all see Russia freed from its chains. Long live the Reclamation Government, and the justice that it will bring!"\n\nWith one voice, the answer came:"
 omsksr.1.a: ""Long live the Reclamation Government!""

 omsksr.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Russian Reclamation Government"
 omsksr.2.d: "News has come of a declaration from Western Siberia. A "Reclamation Government" has been formed by the Black League to reclaim Russian territory from those it deems unworthy or traitorous to the Russian people. Their successes so far have shown them to be a powerful military force.\n\nLed by Dmitry Yazov, the Reclamation Government has made many promises to the Russian people, the most significant of which is a return to democracy after reunification and "strengthening" of Russia. Whether he is Cincinnatus or Caesar, Yazov certainly now has the power of a military dictator, and appears to have cemented his rule.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this military state can last, whether Yazov can keep the reins steady.\n"
 omsksr.2.a: "Bitter plants from bitter seeds."
 omsksr.2.b: "Onwards to Victory."
 omsksr.2.c: "Their "state" will never last."

 omsksr.3.t: "Assignments"
 omsksr.3.d: "The line to be assigned to a cadre had stretched far outside the small barn the Omsk men had set up as their headquarters in the village. They had promised food, shelter, and community, which was two more things than any of the villagers had right now. But the little town near Samara was now part of the League, and that meant that the people in it were, too. A middle-aged man sat behind a desk as a mother and her child approached.\n\n"Only one at a time, please, ma'am."\n\n"Please, he is very young. I only wish to make sure-" The official raised his finger to cut her off.\n\n"That is for me to decide. He shall serve the League in whatever way Russia requires. What is his age?"\n\n"He is only 16. Surely there is some work he can do." She began to whisper. "Something away from the front lines."\n\nHe was not 16. The official was quite aware that he was not 16. And still, he paused for a few seconds. He recalled his own Youth Cadre, the punishments, the pain, as well as the brotherhood. This mother had no idea what being 16 in Omsk actually meant, what it required. His face grew blank as he accidentally stared at the boy. His pen hovered over the assignment card. "If he were not 16, I might be able to assign him to an industrial cadre rather than a Youth Cadre." The official looked very purposefully at the mother. "Do you understand me?"\n\nThe mother watched as his sunken face turned towards her. There was very little to indicate any change in expression, except that the corners of his lifeless eyes seemed to twitch, and there was a turn in his stubbled right cheek. "...Yes. He is 18."\n\n"I see. You are being assigned to Cadre 603481, in Luzino. Your son will be assigned to Cadre 704821, in Sverdlovsk. Do not pack anything. You will be transported tomorrow. Say whatever goodbyes you need to. It is unlikely you will see anyone here again."\n\n"But surely he could stay with me and-"\n\n"Do not test the limits of my patience. You will find them short.""
 omsksr.3.a: "Small mercies."

 omsksr.4.t: "Blueprint for Armageddon"
 omsksr.4.d: "Yazov looked at the aligned blueprints on the table. 6 full floors, with an elevator to the surface. A kink in the entrance to attenuate the radiation. All concrete and rebar. Sealed doorways, CBRN-resistant ventilation systems, room for nearly three hundred people in this underground home. He traced his finger down the elevator and along the hallway to the residential areas. He had been in enough bunkers to know what it would look like. He knew how the walls would feel rough and unwelcoming, how the air would start to become stale, how the silence would start to drive you mad after a few weeks. The engineer's voice snapped him out of his daydream.\n\n"Current estimates are that it could survive a five megaton warhead detonating at .22 km height at any distance farther than half a kilometer. Survivors would be able to continue operations without further supply for up to half a year, at which point potable water would be expended. Our estimated cost for each is a hundred thousand rubles, depending on terrain and features. Naturally, they can be outfitted with additional modules for command units, armories, and etcetera, to be designated at time of construction."\n\nAll so technical. So deterministic. An engineer's solution to an apocalyptic problem. He straightened his back and looked the man dead in the eye."
 omsksr.4.a: ""Begin construction immediately.""

 omsksr.5.t: "Construction Complete"
 omsksr.5.d: "Yazov ran his hand along the rough concrete of the first level. The glare of the fluorescent lights was just as uncomfortable. But he was not here to review the amenities. This was to be Russia's future. This had to be Russia's future. For a second, he allowed himself to feel safe and ready. Nothing could touch them here. The network of these bunkers that had been built would secure the Russian people against any eventuality. These small rooms, barely large enough for three stacked cots and shelves, were a great accomplishment of the program of national action: survival of the Russian nation, whatever the cost. He had always spoken about it in words, and always believed it, but the bunkers were his words made manifest.\n\nThe lights flickered off for a moment. When they came back on, Yazov had already started back up the stairs towards the elevator. There was still so much to be done. Tons of concrete and snaking tunnels do not prepare a nation for war. He didn't even know if the bunkers would work, yet he had claimed to all assembled that their security was guaranteed forevermore. He climbed faster. What a joke he had played on all of them, and on himself, in thinking that he could stop the inevitable. He was nothing, just the shadow of Karbyshev, a pretender playing the savior for all to see.\n\nHe arrived at the elevator, adjusted his cap, and pushed the button. There would be no time for these thoughts on the surface. Just as well."
 omsksr.5.a: "Our security is guaranteed forevermore."

 omsksr.6.t: "Mission to Omsk"
 omsksr.6.d: "As usual, the man from Omsk showed up two minutes early. Unusually, he showed up with a director and producer in tow in full regalia, each carrying two copies of what looked to be a screenplay.\n\n"Good evening, Mr. Ambassador. I would like to talk with you a moment about a brief collaborative project that, I think, would benefit both of our countries. I have invited some gentlemen from Hollywood that have expressed interest in this endeavor and have written a brief script that reflects the ideas we would like to see put onto the big screen.\n\nTo put it simply, Ambassador, we want to show that our objective is neither some vengeful crusade, nor to establish some brutal dictatorship-quite the opposite! What we want is what any nation wishes for- peace and security for its citizens. Our circumstances require some regimentation, yes, but discipline is not such a terrible thing if citizens themselves take pride in defending their homeland."\n\nAfter a brief look through the screenplay which contained many "sweeping shots of hardy workers enjoying their labor", the ambassador grimaced and scratched his chin."
 omsksr.6.a: "The RNRG could be a valuable partner. Accept the proposal."
 omsksr.6.b: "We cannot lend legitimacy to the RNRG. Reject the proposal."

 omsksr.7.t: "Our Own Hollywood"
 omsksr.7.d: "The Americans have agreed to lend us limited supplies in the form of filmmaking equipment and technical assistance, as well as agreeing to let a team of a producer, director, screenwriter, and accompanying staff to travel to Omsk to participate and advise in filming. We expect to make great and immediate progress towards our goal of completing the movie on schedule.\n\nAppropriate industrial and agricultural cadres will be conscripted for filming, specifically for scenes A.15, A.20, and B.11, which will require numerous extras and filming in large-scale industrial areas. We have commissioned one specially outfitted helicopter for the occasion, to be used in landscape filming. Glavkoverkh Yazov has been informed of the development regarding American assistance and has authorized filming to begin at once."
 omsksr.7.a: "Lights, Camera, Action!"

 omsksr.8.t: "Rejection"
 omsksr.8.d: "The Americans have rejected our proposal to make our humanizing movie. Obviously, they will be as helpful to our government as they were the last time Russia was powerful. We will have to find other ways to present our new face to the world, perhaps by finding new partners for this endeavor.\n\nThere may be other ways to communicate with the outside world about our intentions, but lacking the legitimacy of American backing, even American commercial backing, is a serious blow. Perhaps we must look inwards for such things."
 omsksr.8.a: "They can't give us the courtesy of a second look."

 omsksr.9.t: "A New Look for Omsk"
 omsksr.9.d: ""On your first visit here Mister Ambassador, I felt I was welcoming a capable and honest ambassador, but now I feel I am saying goodbye to a friend. No one could have been more conscientious and respectful to both our countries," said the actor posing as Dmitry Yazov.\n\nThe ambassador smiled. "The work being done to improve living conditions everywhere in Siberia, your industrial innovations, your use of natural resources- I am greatly impressed by what I have seen here. I believe history will record you as a great builder for the benefit of mankind," he replied.\n\nWith a final handshake, and the ambassador turning back for a final salute as he walked out the door, the famous movie, "Mission to Omsk", portraying the purported reality of life in newly unified West Siberia, faded to black. Reviews have been highly polarized, with some saying that it is merely a propagandistic hack job, while others credit innovative screenplay design and the use of helicopters to capture scenes of expansive Russia as never seen before. Overall, it appears Omsk has convinced at least part of the world that the gold in its flag outshines the black, and that it is a nation worth recognizing as a potential ally."
 omsksr.9.a: "Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction."

 omsksr.10.t: "First In"

A thin slip of card paper would decide whether he lived or died. Getting through Moskowien's infamously porous border would not be difficult, but staying there undetected and carrying out his assignment certainly would be.\n\nHe had been charged, as part of the new infiltration program, to signal back any information he could find about Moskowien's vulnerabilities. Drozdov himself had sent them off with encouraging words about how they would be the first echelon, the tip of the spear that would retake their nation's land. Troop dispositions, popular unrest, partisan groups, infrastructural weaknesses, anything that would help in the assault, whenever it came.\n\nIt was time to start off again. He would cross the border in the fading light, and likely have to go through several checkpoints just the next day. But he was ready. He grabbed the handlebars, flicked up the kickstand, and started dragging the motorcycle towards the forested stream that would be his crossing point."
 omsksr.10.a: "Work in the shadow, to serve the light."

 omsksr.11.t: "First Out"
 omsksr.11.d: "Yuri crawled through the swamp, his hands filthy, his eyes half-closed to stop the mud from splashing in. He heard the dogs howling and barking after him, heard the German voices yelling to each other, getting closer... Just a few days ago, he had been transmitting data about the local garrison from his airdropped comms unit. Whether there was a rat in the town or whether his transmissions had been intercepted was irrelevant at this point. What mattered was that he was screwed.\n\nIt was there, in the muck, that he decided that he would die here. He knew what the Germans would do to him if they captured him- the manuals he had been given told one story, but his comrades in the unit told of far worse fates that awaited him. But he would choose to die on his own soil, his nation's soil. And one day, there would be tanks running through this swamp, throwing these arrogant Germans off the ground that he would make sacred.\n\nHe looked at the small pill he had been given in case of emergencies. It was time. He crawled to a deep pond, took a last breath, and bit down."
 omsksr.11.a: "I am cold."

 omsksr.12.t: "The Briefing"
 omsksr.12.d: "Sakharovsky walked up to the projector. The collected hierarchy of the Black League sat in anticipation of his new draft.\n\n"Glavkoverkh, comrades, the following is a general outline our staff has prepared for Operation Chernobog. While conventional military action will be needed to dismantle the German state, it will also be necessary to use unconventional means to assist this main objective. With that in mind, specialized units will be deployed into the heart of Germany well before military operations commence in order to sabotage infrastructure, cause civilian casualties, and destroy the trust of the government in its military.\n\nProbing attacks must first be conducted in vulnerable areas on insignificant targets- namely, isolated civilians and low-ranking officials. Utilizing information gained here on German reactions, we can target our larger-scale operations towards infrastructure and transport systems. Critical to these attacks will be the usage of German chemical weapons- this will result in suspicion being directed towards the Wehrmacht. We can then escalate attacks towards the population, resulting in the desired split between the civilian and military leadership. Research into replicating these agents is, therefore, of a high priority.\n\nWith the civilian government fearing a coup from within and the military attempting to maintain order, we expect that we will be able to trigger a partial shutdown of the strategic command structure within the timespan of one to two months after major operations begin. This will severely hamper any conventional or nuclear response to our initial attacks. You may find an extended timeline on pages twenty-five through twenty-eight, and a requested budget on pages thirty-three through thirty-nine.""
 omsksr.12.a: ""Are there any questions?""

 omsksr.13.t: "Trial no.59"
 omsksr.13.d: ""The convening authority of the Black League, Samara District, hereby orders this courts-martial of-" The officer flipped up the page. "Nikolai Gurevich. Former Deputy to the Economics Minister of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia. Is that correct?"\n\n"Yes," replied Gurevich. He felt deathly uncomfortable in the solid wood pew and scratchy prisoner's uniform he had been provided with. He looked up at the black-clad officer who leered down at him from beneath his cap. His hands began to twitch.\n\n"You are aware of the illegitimacy of this government and the disunity it has caused to the nation of Russia, correct?"\n\n"Yes. Please, I was merely an officiary, I was not involved in the war, I immediately offered-"\n\n"Then we have no further need of you. Your sentence has been rendered. Sergeants, please remove this man."\n\nHe felt hands below his shoulders. He tried to speak out, to say something in his defense, but there were no words that would make an ounce of difference now. He was half-carried and half-walked to a concrete courtyard. This was where the shots had been coming from."
 omsksr.13.a: ""But I wasn't anyone...""

 omsksr.14.t: "Under a Different Flag"
 omsksr.14.d: "A hundred men stood assembled in the courtyard as a black-clad officer stood on a podium before them. The old and young alike had shivered through northern winters and endured the terror of battle. This was what remained of a former West Russian Revolutionary Front infantry company, given general amnesty after the conclusion of hostilities. They were sorely needed, now more than ever.\n\n"Soldiers of Russia- you fought proudly in the defense of your homeland and your families. Though we may have been at odds before, we welcome you now as comrades in the same struggle against those would seek to destroy our nation. Fight with us with the same dedication and fury you have already shown, and we shall secure a place in this world for the Russian people and bring vengeance upon those who have desecrated holy Russia.\n\nYou must now recite the oath of the Black League.""
 omsksr.14.a: ""I believe, before all else, in Russia, one, indivisible, and invincible...""

 omsksr.15.t: "Comrades in Arms"
 omsksr.15.d: "Ustinov and Yepishev were seated in full WRRF uniform opposite a single empty chair. They did not look like defeated men, quite the opposite. As Yazov walked in and took his seat, they rose and saluted him, as equals.\n\n"Comrades, you surely know that I reserve the greatest respect for yourselves and your former cause. I think we share many of the same beliefs and virtues. I have, therefore, come personally to see if you would join us in our struggle against our hated enemy in the defense of Russia."\n\nThe two generals simply stared for a few seconds, nearly expressionless. Over the long, awkward pause, Yazov grew anxious. Was he going to have to jail them? Shoot them? These men, who had fought for the nation so admirably?\n\nThe two men opposite exchanged a few mumbled comments. Ustinov snorted. Yepishev looked concerned. After what felt like minutes, with Yazov growing more and more impatient, they finally stood. First Ustinov, then Yepishev, then Yazov.\n\n"Comrade, we would be proud to serve under your leadership. Let us help the Black League to restore the full glory of Russia." The two men snapped to salute.\n\nYazov returned the salute. As they turned and marched out of the room, he leaned on the table ever so slightly. It was good to have two honorable and trustworthy men that would add unity to the cause. And he was glad he didn't have to shoot them."
 omsksr.15.a: "Keep your friends close."

 omsksr.16.t: "Integration of the Armies"
 omsksr.16.d: "For too long, Russia has not used all of its strength. To overcome its challenges, all must serve, and all must give everything to the cause. This includes fighting on the front lines, and women have been overlooked unnecessarily for this solemn duty. This has shortly come to an end, as a series of orders to begin re-integration of women into frontline units has been put out to all cadres. Ranks are now being filled with women as well as men, with equal training and standards for all.\n\nThe boost in manpower and the skill of these heroines is a welcome addition to our forces, and is absolutely necessary for the task ahead. They will serve as well as anyone else, and help to bring forth a united Russia. Today, a thousand female voices all over the Reclamation Government have declared:\n\n"I believe in Russia, one, indivisible, and invincible. I believe in my own strength and the strength of my comrades...""
 omsksr.16.a: ""I swear this oath by my sacred Motherland.""

Your trials will be many, and your hardships unbearable. Still, for the sake of your children, and your children's children, and all Russian people, you must persist in bringing justice to Germany and safety to our lands.\n\nWe must reunify all of Russia under our banner, for Russia cannot be disunited or weak to accomplish our glorious aims. We have seen previously what disunity and backstabbing can do, even to a determined people. This must not occur again. This will not occur again. The Black League will make it so.\n\nOnly then can we accomplish our true task: bringing justice to the oppressors in Germany and their puppet state that now holds Moscow. We shall scatter them before our might, and show them the same mercy that they have shown to all of Russia. They will be erased from the world, and good riddance to them. We shall accomplish this task for the sake of all free peoples. In doing so, we assure Russia's safety and the safety of the world.\n\nThe justice of our cause is clear. The implements of the destruction of Germany are in your hands. Let us go forward in our righteous anger! On to Moscow!"
 omsksr.17.a: ""And onwards to Berlin!""

 omsksr.18.t: "Warnings from Within"
 omsksr.18.d: "It was intended to be an ordinary inspection. The Glavkoverkh himself, along with his aides, observing the mines. He had done all the usual stunts, shook hands with all the coal-dusted hard-hatted workers he could. Praised them for their dedication to victory above all else. And yet, before that night was over, Yazov's mind would fracture.\n\nThere had always been rumors about Karbyshev's death. They were always intentionally kept from Yazov. Who knows how he might react when he learned the truth? It is better for him not to find out that the one man he could count on did... what he did. But then, one swaying miner turned all their plans to dust.\n\n"I am sorry for the loss of Comrade Karbyshev, Glavkoverkh Yazov. Such a terrible way to go. My uncle was a guard and saw him as he walked out to die."\n\nEvery eye of every aide behind Yazov opened to the size of dinner plates. A few shook their heads vigorously at the assembled miners, others just watched in shock.\n\n"I am unsure what you mean, comrade."\n\nYazov's voice was slow. Dispassionate. Analytical. Quieter than usual. Just a normal question. But his clenched jaw and burning stare told volumes. Even the drunken miner must have picked up on something, but he continued.\n\n"Well, comrade, as I am sure you know, he had simply had enough, you know. Thought it was time. Thought he should go." Shockingly, the miners around him began to nod in assent.\n\nYazov's breathing accelerated. The aides behind him now drew their fingers across their throats at the miners, or put a finger to their lips. It was far too late. Good god. He knows. It was truly amazing that Yazov managed to keep an even tone. But the aides could not see the twisted look of anger and deep sadness on his face when he said:"

The Germans will use every weapon imaginable against us. We must be ready with our own. Unconventional weaponry is required for what will be an unconventional war. When THE GREAT TRIAL arrives, we shall be ready. We must be ready.\n\nTo this end, several projects will be commissioned to research effective unconventional weaponry and prepare its deployment on a large scale. You will be informed of your assignments in upcoming days. All such research is classified top secret.\n\nThese weapons of national vengeance will bring forth the fury of every Russian mother who lost their son, every father who saw his home and land destroyed, and every soldier who, despite their greatest efforts, saw their nation fall to ruin. We will bring home the devastation the Germans have wrought upon our land. They have sowed the wind - let them reap the whirlwind.\n\nAny concerns from high-level (department lead researchers or higher) officials should be directed to Glavkoverkh Yazov directly."

 omsksr.20.d: "Yazov strode impatiently down the hallway after a disappointing briefing, Sakharovsky in tow.\n\n"Comrade Sakharovsky, we have discussed this. We desperately require atomic weaponry. I will not tolerate delays in the program. There have already been enough issues."\n\n"Glavkoverkh, please - there may be an alternative."\n\nSakharovsky put his hand on Yazov's shoulder. The other was outstretched to one of many conference rooms in the bunker. Yazov turned.\n\n"Explain."\n\n"The primary objective of atomic weaponry is not merely the destruction of buildings or their inhabitants, but to render economic activity unviable for an extended period. Well, a genuine nuclear reaction is not necessary for such an event. Merely spreading radioactive fallout is good enough. These Radiological Dispersive Devices will do exactly that."\n\nYazov still looked skeptical.\n\n"Nonsense. A conventional bomb would not spread the radiation nearly as far as a nuclear bomb, would it not?"\n\n"You are correct, Glavkoverkh. Even our largest conventional weapons would not have the truly desired effect. However, there are a couple advantages to these 'dirty' bombs. One, they are easier to make. We can therefore have more available to target more cities in the Trial. Two, they can be made smaller than real nuclear devices. Small enough, perhaps, to be carried by a dedicated agent into a population center. This would make upcoming operations far more effective."\n\n"Furthermore, the effect of radiation may not be significant past a few kilometers - but the people of Germany will not know that, nor will they believe their government when they tell them so. Some weapons of vengeance strike at the heart. Others strike at the brain."\n\nYazov stood silent for a while. It was an elegant solution to a problem of limitations. Sakharovsky had outdone himself."
 omsksr.20.a: ""Very well. Radioactive material will be transferred.""

 omsksr.21.t: "The Sixth Circle"
 omsksr.21.d: ""Major Ovchinnikov, I-" said the Glavkoverkh, before being politely cut off by his host.\n\n"No need, Glavkoverkh. It's perfectly natural to feel revulsion when you look at what we're doing here," interjected Major Yuri Ovchinnikov, opening a door for his guest. "It's certainly not the most civilized operation sometimes." He glanced back at Yazov briefly as they entered a long, windowed hallway before continuing. "Block 5 is our most advanced facility," explained the major. Yazov glanced down the line of windows, and his stomach seized up instinctively. On the other side were, in various states of deterioration, the husks of human beings. A gaunt man, splayed across a cot, with horrible lesions covering his skin. A feverish woman, huddled in the corner of her cell. A crumpled-up rag of a person, crouched on the floor, coughing helplessly, his bloody-\n\nYazov had to look away. His host continued his narration. There were several cells, for instance, for the testing of a hemorrhagic smallpox strain, codenamed "India," obtained from an anonymous seller. His team had been slowly breeding the virus to be resistant to almost every antibiotic available in Russia. Upon mentioning this fact, Ovchinnikov had turned to Yazov and, like a schoolboy telling a prurient joke to a friend, had suggested with a smirk that the medical aid being sought abroad by the Glavkoverkh might come in handy for this. Then, he directed Yazov's attention to a darkened room at the end of the hall, turning on the light to reveal a nearly skeletal man, hunched over an exercise bike of some kind. This man, as the major explained, was being used to test the efficacy of pathogens on soldiers in combat. Having been infected, lengthy stints on the bike simulated physical strain, while the psychological stress was replicated by firing live rounds over his head at random intervals. The major waited for Yazov to comment, but was met with only silence."
 omsksr.21.a: "Yazov wanted to be proud. But he just felt empty."

 omsksr.22.t: "Uranium Exposure"
 omsksr.22.d: "Reports have been flooding in from the doctors assigned to the redemption brigades that strange symptoms have begun to surface among the units who have been sent to assist in mining operations. Bloody urine, catastrophic kidney failure, and unprecedented rates of cancer have ravaged the redemption brigades, with nearly eighty casualties to date from whatever is causing this. Though most are baffled, one doctor in particular has speculated that the damage is so bad that it's 'as though they were digging Uranium with a shovel.'\n\n-Which isn't far off from reality! High command is ecstatic at the success of the operation, having expected casualties three times greater than what we're seeing!\n\nMany additional redemption brigades have been rerouted to assist with Uranium extraction operations now that we know the losses are well within acceptable parameters."
 omsksr.22.a: "This is much cheaper than safety equipment!"

 omsksr.23.t: "The Fourth Thesis"
 omsksr.23.d: "Yazov's mind was not his own. Verbal shrapnel rebounded in his head endlessly, cutting any semblance of a coherent thought into ribbons as he paced his darkened office, alone. He relived the moment for the thousandth time, repeating what that damn miner had asked him. How he had angrily demanded clarification as his entourage looked on in horror. How the miner had continued, saying some relative of his was on duty that night and had seen it happen, his comrades agreeing. The men were dead now, but he couldn't kill their words, words eating away at his mind like a corrosive poison. He had to know.\n\nAnother day. Karbyshev's old Tatar aide, caught in Tyumen, regarding the Glavkoverkh with pity even as he languished in his manacles. Yazov remembered how he had stood up, ramrod-straight, staring down at the prostrate yet defiant man from mere feet away. And how that man had nonchalantly told him how it was all true. He wanted to go out on his own terms, the Tatar had said. He decided to embrace the inevitable. He had taken control, the Tatar had added, mocking Yazov. Again, the man was now gone. But, even without their vessel, the accursed words still fluttered about, haunting him. Confidence was now draining away, being replaced by a growing shame that he was letting this hound him at all. The Great Trial awaited, he told himself. He had greater things to deal with, a greater mark to leave on history. The inevitable-\n\nYazov's mind crystallized into absolute clarity. The conclusion was simple, the logic plain. Just as Karbyshev had seen the inevitability of death, and thus embraced it on his own terms, so should Russia not simply wait for the Great Trial, but start it when she was ready. He saw his path forward, his decisive mark in history. The warm winds of destiny were at his back, overriding his own doubts, as he looked up to the plaque on the wall bearing the three Karbyshevite theses. Now, there would be a fourth."
 omsksr.23.a: "I have a purpose. And miles to go before I sleep."

 omsksr.24.t: "Inspecting the Black Mountain"
 omsksr.24.d: "Valery and Alek watched as the rusted metal gates of the Black Mountain turn inwards, its hinges howling the whole way down. Dressed in hazmat suits and gas masks, their breathing seemed to echo in the walls of this place. It was dark, with only their electric lights piercing the gloom. They looked at the walls, the moss that had grown over the concrete, like greenish plaque on an infected tooth. A transparent film formed over it, a liquid that seeped through years of non-maintenance. Drip, drip, drip. The ceilings seemed to perspire in fear of what it had contained.\n\n"Alek," Valery said, "I get the feeling that this place ain't friendly." Friendly, frien, frie, fri. His voice echoed within the vast chambers of the Mountain's research complex. "Did you hear that?"\n\n"I did." Alek seemed more amazed than afraid of this place, although Valery saw his left arm tremble. The fingers that held the flashlight were a little unsteady. "I've heard stories. My family lived in Sverdlovsk. People who go here," Alek said, his flashlight drifting towards the ceiling, "do not come back. Either researcher or subject."\n\n"That infamous, huh."\n\n"You're from Zlatoust. You wouldn't know."\n\n"I guess." They walked inside, the concrete crunching under the heels of their boots. "Did you smell that? Is that rotten mea-"\n\nAlek cut him off. "Better if you don't describe it at all. Far better.""
 omsksr.24.a: ""If you say so, Alek.""

 omsksr.25.t: "A Cold, Dark Sea"
 omsksr.25.d: "Alexey nodded to the privateers opposite him, marvelling inwardly at how - cold - this business was. There was no shortage of enemies he'd faced, no shortage of bitter reprisals and post-hoc justifications, and yet here he was, facing the men the Internal Security (Naval) Branch despised most of all: the men and occasional women of the sea. Nikolayevich, their head, had been running the ports for as long as the Black League's long halls held memory of him, and his motley little crew were whispered to have fingers in every pie this side of the Arctic Sea. Including, it was whispered, the Germans' own fleets.\n\n"Gentlemen, please. Sit down." There had been a time when Aleksey, fresh from League boot-camp, would have gladly paid his own life to strangle this enemy of the State, but he'd grown in his long watch to understand the higher truths. There was an order to killing. A reason. And he now had a reason to keep this man alive.\n\n"Commissar Alexey." Nikolayevich raised a grey-flecked eyebrow. "What is the purpose of this visit?"\n\nTargets and people, Alexey reminded himself. "Nikolayevich. I have been ordered to bring you in, but the Black League seeks not to arrest you. Your talents are... required." He gestured at the photos in the open file before them both. "We seek reconnaissance. Submarine and marine both. Your clippers are seaworthy, and armed. We will bring them into the fold, and we will build your ships for you. You need only say yes." As Nikolayevich rose to speak, Alexey held a hand up. "And before you negotiate, you might want to take a look at the last picture."\n\nNikolayevich flipped to the end of the dossier. His eyes turned cold. His face went white. A wordless murmur escaped his lips, and Alexey rose from his seat. "We offer much - but never forget what we can take, Nikolayevich. Report to the Naval Yard at 0900 hours tomorrow.""
 omsksr.25.a: "Aim for the right targets and people will follow."

 omsksr.26.t: "The Fate of the Pretenders"
 omsksr.26.d: ""N-Neyn! Please!"\n\n"Your use of the disgusting Germanic tongue disgusts me, whelp. We have razed your hideouts, slaughtered your fellow pretenders, obliterated your divisions, and you have the audacity to speak in a language which threatens the Russian state?"\n\nWithout a single chance to respond, the member of an Aryan Brotherhood combat unit was swiftly executed with a pistol shot, falling forward into a shallow dirt hole. He was one of many on his knees, blindfolded, in a line facing a makeshift mass grave dug swiftly after the aftermath of the final battle against the appearers. Cadre 227719 was assigned to liquidation of several units of men who had surrendered against the might of the Russian Reclamation Government. Upon orders from Yazov himself, no mercy was to be shown. Any single man who held a rifle in their treasonous act of Teutonic appeasement was to have their life taken.\n\nCries were heard from some of the men. Others breathed heavily while awaiting their imminent fate. A member of the Cadre stepped behind another traitor on the ground, with the blindfolded soldier sniffing rapidly.\n\nThe roaring fire of artillery in the distance masked another shot, and with it the brass expelled from falling to the ground below. Another thud, another traitor to the motherland deep in his grave.\n\nThis was not the last of this scene, and many like this were happening across the former territories of the Aryan Brotherhood. Justice has finally been served in the Russian Anarchy, and every pretender in the grave would prepare Russia more and more for her upcoming Great Trial."
 omsksr.26.a: "Teutonic appeasers will rot six feet underground!"

 omsksr.27.t: "In Gurgite Vasto"
 omsksr.27.d: "The sky was without form, and darkness was on the face of the clouds. And as the access door leading onto the command center's rooftop slammed shut, Yazov was once again alone. Adrenaline sublimated into the mist, his body cooled by the soft drizzle. The tramp of boots echoed off Omsk's concrete carapace as a cadre drilled on the square below.\n\nSakharovsky. Savintsev. Steklyar. Six others, chosen by name. They were the first to hear about the Thesis. Sworn to secrecy beyond any known in the League. Miles of barbed wire and layers within layers of security clearances had still come to this: a meeting on the rooftop, five stories in the air, where only the wind and sky could eavesdrop.\n\nOnly hours ago, Yazov had felt sick to his stomach. What if this was all insanity? And even then, until that moment of truth, the Thesis' existence was dizzyingly tenuous - only a single heartbeat away from erasure. But now, the truth would be borne by ten men. And then, a hundred. And one day, by all Russians.\n\nYet, a new, even more sickening, dread overtook Yazov. He could feel the great colossus groaning beneath his feet, awakened from its slumber. He could see the leviathan stirring behind the sky's gray sheets of rain. The wheels were now turning, gears tearing at decades of grime and rot and decay. Now, perhaps he could stop what he started, before millions rallied to the call. But soon, it would be beyond the control of any man. It would grow and grow until a nation's wrath blotted out the sun. The thought was exhilarating but terrifying. What was he, a mere man, against such a will, such a great machine? In the most primal depths of his gut, he feared it would swallow him whole. And so, as a bone-chilling rain ran from the languid skies, the master of Russia turned around, opened the door, and resigned himself to a fate unknown."
 omsksr.27.a: "The great machine had been set in motion."
 omsksr.27_tt: "§RStepping into the unknown, his resolve grew. The Great Trial awaits.§!"

 omsksr.28.t: "Golgotha"
 omsksr.28.d: "Some of them went loudly, strutting about on the gallows like caged beasts as the UVB men wrestled them into position. They fought for every precious last breath. But fate was incontrovertible, inevitable, and they fared no better than children trying desperately to squirm their way out of a doctor's shot. Such men left their earthly lives in struggle, shouting that the Black League men were all murderous, satanic Jews and Bolsheviks who would destroy Holy Russia. That the Vozhd still lived, and that even now Blackshirts were regrouping, and would soon take back Zeya. In their last moments, as they looked cold death in the eyes, they tried to rally the people who had once cheered the deaths of the RFP's enemies.\n\nOthers went into the cold night in a far more pathetic manner, begging for their lives and shrilly pleading their innocence. That they hadn't known about Rodzaevsky's crimes, or if they had known, there was nothing that they could do, or if they could have done something they were ordered not to. But it was all for naught - the die were already cast.\n\nAnd then some met fate quietly, without so much as a word. Perhaps they were resigned to their fate. Or perhaps they knew their guilt, and knew that this was justice.\n\nFor days on end, Zeya's central square was filled with nonstop executions of Russia's fascists - generals, ideologues, party bureaucrats, and even the Vozhd's pet "Patriarch" - held on the very same gallows where Matkovsky and the pretender-Tsar had met their respective ends. The hangman's lot was not an easy one. But, for once, the liquidation cadre manning the gallows did not feel a single pang of remorse."
 omsksr.28.a: "Zeya would be cleansed."

 omsksr.29.t: "Update on Directorate Activities (pg.35)"
 omsksr.29.d: "DISTRICT 31 (VITIMSK REGION)\n\nCHARA - Upon arrival of frontline cadres, local residents had staged an uprising and had executed 23 local RFP officials and had arrested 45 claimed RFP members. No further action required, logistics units en route for cadre induction and redeployment of local population.\n\nIKAB'YA - 44 fascist-collaborationist fighters liquidated by UVB units following liberation. 163 additional suspected collaborators detained for Redemptionary Service. Cadre induction of remainder of inhabitants pending UVB background investigation.\n\nNOVAYA CHARA - Local residents claimed no RFP presence, but UVB investigation revealed RFP memorabilia at the residence of the town's mayor, who subsequently liquidated, resulting in civil unrest. After continued resistance and application of punitive measures, remaining population was relocated and sentenced to Redemptionary Service.\n\nUST-NYUKZHA - All RFP members had fled before arrival of frontline cadres, and candidate groups for cadre induction were successfully identified; however, after local residents resisted cadre induction and assaulted UVB personnel, over 500 residents were sentenced to Redemptionary Service and relocated. The remainder were permitted to remain in situ as non-member civilian workers."
 omsksr.29.a: "Liquidation Quota Status: MET"

 omsksr.30.t: "Curfew"
 omsksr.30.d: "The damp and drizzly night hung low over Arkhangelsk, as the city lights reflected off the low clouds to bathe the world in a stale salmon-orange glow of un-darkness. The world was silent, save the soft sounds of distant police sirens and the occasional passing BTR.\n\nWhen Marat saw the man crouched at the basis of the West Russian War Memorial in the center of the city twenty minutes after the end of curfew, he had assumed the worst. A possible saboteur, maybe someone planting a bomb. He'd seen many of those in the days since the fall of Arkhangelsk. But as he stepped out of the staff car into the damp, drizzly night, his pistol at the ready, his concern faded away. The man at the base of the memorial was clearly quite elderly. Marat's steps slowed, and it was only in a regular speaking voice that he addressed the man.\n\n"Sir, you should really get going. It's twenty minutes past curfew." The man turned around, slowly, revealing a ragged jacket adorned with Soviet decorations and a crumpled St. George Ribbon. A look of subtle disdain crossed the old man's time-weathered face as he regarded the young man. Marat instantly knew what he was thinking - it was the same with almost everyone he'd met in Arkhangelsk. Were these men in black any different from the ones who had come before?\n\nMarat broke the silence with an outstretched hand and a gesture back to the staff car."
 omsksr.30.a: ""Comrade soldier, come on. I'll take you home.""

 omsksr.31.t: "The New World"
 omsksr.31.d: "The world had died and been reborn before Maria's young eyes. Ever since the big fire, the rules were different, and no one ever explained why.\n\nA strange, new language had smothered everything. She couldn't go down to the Bryudershaftsplats, because there wasn't a Bryudershaftsplats anymore. Now, they called it the Ploshad' Osvobozhdeniya, and her parents scolded her harshly, with fear in their eyes, for calling it by the other name. The old "Permhaym," rough and substantial, was now just a single, clipped syllable - "Perm'." The new way of naming things, frankly, just seemed so clunky compared to how they used to do things. "Gitleralleyy," short and simple, was now "Prospekt Sakharovskogo."\n\nEven her friends had been changed by this strange event. Greta, the girl she had grown up playing with, was now "Galina." Teodor, now "Fyodor." Ulrikh, now "Yuri." And she hadn't seen Adolf in weeks.\n\nNowadays, she had to talk differently as well. In school, the teacher would smack her with a ruler if she heard her talking in the old way, with its hard sounds and soft accent. The new way was different and confusing, with strange words and a persistent sound she couldn't quite master.\n\nIn time, the old tongue would fade, eroded away by time's steady tide. But the memories of a cursed childhood would live on."
 omsksr.31.a: ""Chernova," not "Shvarts," remember?"

 omsksr.32.t: "Judgment Day"
 omsksr.32.d: "The mood of the crowd on Samara's Sobornaya Square was hard to judge as a light, unseasonable snow fell from the sky. Some of the city's denizens clearly wished to show their loyalty to the new regime, waving homemade banners and chanting recently-learned slogans. Yet the motives of others were not as easily discerned - certainly, no one dared to publicly show sympathy for the traitors of the ROA. Perhaps it was simply the crude spectacle of it all, then. Or for some, maybe it was the chance to see a long chapter in Samara's history come to a definitive end, on a simple wooden gallows at the square's center.\n\n"SERGEY KUZMICH BUNYACHENKO!" The hangman's assistant shouted the name of his first customer in a booming, officious voice, as if he were the gatekeeper to Valhalla. The general, wearing a bare gray jacket stripped of all insignia, stepped forward, climbing the steps onto the gallows with an air of solemn acceptance. Although he was surprised by the fact that he was not granted last words as the noose was slipped around his neck, he didn't seem especially bothered, and went silently to his death, stolid and emotionless.\n\n"MILETIY ALEXANDROVICH ZYKOV!" The unassuming ideologue stepped forward, his mind vacant, worn raw by weeks of pleading and reasoning with the unreasonable. He seemed almost half-asleep as the noose was put over his neck, muttering something that only he and the hangman would ever hear.\n\n"MIKHAIL ALEXSANDROVICH ILINICH!" The profiteer-general stepped forward with an almost-lewd smirk. Something resembling a cheer rippled through some of the locals assembled on the plaza. As the noose was slipped around his neck, he tried his best to flash a defiant grin, but it quickly turned to a grimace as the finality of it all dawned on him. In the blink of an eye, the trapdoor had fallen, and he stirred no more."
 omsksr.32.a: "The end of an era."

 omsksr.33.t: "Nighttime Rumination"
 omsksr.33.d: "A lambent sliver of light silently shot across the Siberian night sky. Kostya craned his neck, momentarily forgetting the fatigue of late-night exercises. The celestial visitor burned brightly for a few seconds before fading with a soft finality, its departure as sudden as its appearance.\n\n"The fuck was that?" Vadim asked, not taking his eyes off of the forested horizon that encircled their shared foxhole.\n\n"Shooting star," Kostya replied lazily, reclining back against the foxhole's rough-hewn wall. "Fifth one this night. You seen anything?"\n\n"No. Thought this was your turn sleeping, though."\n\n"Can't. Thinking."\n\n"About what?"\n\n"Shooting stars." Vadim shot Kostya an odd glance. "You ever feel really, I don't know, small?"\n\n"No-wait, what do you mean exactly?"\n\n"Like, relative to the universe. I was just thinking-" Vadim half-jokingly rolled his eyes. "-you know, that shooting star must have been up there in space for, I dunno, millions of years. All of human history, it was just sitting up there, orbiting or whatever."\n\n"...Kostya, where are you going with this?"\n\n"Think about it, Vadim. For god knows how many years, that little space rock was destined to be here, at this time, in this place, and there's nothing humanity could have done to change that. Bukharin could've won the war, and it'd still be there, right there, at this very moment, regardless of what happened on this planet. You and I could both be dead, or have never been born-"\n\n"I get the point. So what you're saying is-"\n\n"What I'm saying is that sometimes I feel like everything we're doing here, in the League, hell, as human beings, is just so... small. The world just... goes on." Vadim shot him a look - not a disapproving one, but one that they, and perhaps everyone in the Black League, knew well.\n\n"Yeah, I know," Kostya replied. "It's just, I can't help but feel that way."\n\n"You should really get some rest, man.""
