 ### Ideas ###
 # General #
 AM_salted_earth: "Salted Earth"
 AM_salted_earth_desc: "The greatest mark that the Regent's Holy Russian Empire has left across the Motherland is that of salted earth and ruined fields, the legacy of the vast amounts of chemical agents deployed against insurgents and other enemies during the process of unification. As a result, vast amounts of fertile land has been poisoned, formerly critical water sources have been rendered unsafe to drink, and forests have been stripped bare. Untainted food and water is rare in the post-imperial wasteland - and all of the Motherland shall suffer for it."

 # North Russian Liberation Front #
 TMA_Alexander_Altunin:0 "Alexander Altunin"

 TMA_nothing_left_but_the_people: "Nothing Left but the People"
 TMA_nothing_left_but_the_people_desc: "Whilst the North Russian Liberation Front has no grand dreams of saving the rest of Russia, they shall fight to the bitter end to hold on to what they have. In this wasteland, there is nothing left to spare - no ideology, hope, or ambition beyond resisting Larionov. Hope, to the bitter soldiers of the Front, is merely the first step on the road to disappointment."

 TMA_impossible_position: "An Unthinkable Position"
 TMA_impossible_position_desc: "Whilst collaboration with the Finnish, perhaps, is the most desperate option, the Front relies on Finnish aid to feed its people, and ward off starvation a bit longer - despite the poor feelings of Altunin and the Front towards the Finnish state."

 # Imperial Mercantile Consortium #
 TMV_Nikolay_Talberg:0 "Nikolay Talberg"

 TMV_corporate_pillars: "The Corporate Pillars"
 TMV_corporate_pillars_desc: "The Imperial Mercantile Consortium is a hybrid state-private ruled apparatus, run by a board composed of the corporations established under Taboritsky's empire. The corporations, within the Consortium, have their own private fiefs where their word is law - the central currency is merely that of the largest corporation's scrip, and the state apparatus runs oiled by backroom deals."

 TMV_fraying_strings: "Fraying Strings"
 TMV_fraying_strings_desc: "Whilst de jure a component of the Regency to its east, the Consortium has seen the way that the wind is blowing, and operates essentially independently, paying mere lip service whilst working to cut itself loose from Larionov's dying monstrosity."

 # Holy Russian Empire #
 KOM_imperium_nihilus: "Imperium Nihilus"
 KOM_imperium_nihilus_desc: "With Taboritsky's emptying of Russia, and Larionov's purges to ensure a government loyal only to him, it can truly be said that the Holy Russian Empire has nothing left to it. With the Shturmoviki expended, the army barely able to keep itself equipped, the fields poisoned, and the populace starved, the Empire's position is maintained solely by the horrific weapons it has stockpiled - and the broken obedience of the shackled peasantry."

 KOM_hermit_kingdom: "Hermit Kingdom"
 KOM_hermit_kingdom_desc: "Despite his grand visions of reuniting Russia, and restoring the Empire, in truth, Larionov's Holy Russian Empire is nothing but a pariah state guarded by a depleted army kept loyal solely by fear and the promise of riches. Larionov's empire is walled off from the rest of Russia, its only interactions with the other warlords being raids and threatening communications."

 # Christian Republic of Samara #
 TMS_Pimen:0 "Pimen"

 TMS_beacon_in_the_wastes: "Beacon in the Wastes"
 TMS_beacon_in_the_wastes_desc: "As one of the most stable and benevolent states in the post-Taboritsky wastelands, refugees from all over the fallen Empire have made the long trek to the intact lands of the Christian Republic, seeking salvation. Whilst the priesthood is fully willing to house them, and the cities of Samara always need more laborers to help rebuild the infrastructure of the area, some look upon the pilgrims as potential threats - and imperial agents at worst."

 TMS_blessed_isolation: "Blessed Isolation"
 TMS_blessed_isolation_desc: "Despite the benevolence of the Samaran government, the priesthood has looked across the lines, outside of the republic, and seen nothing but a fallen, sinful nation, perverted by a twisted, heretical vision of Christianity. The Christian Republic has no desire to reunify the motherland, regarding it as far beyond saving."

 # Autonomous Soviet Liberation Army #
 TML_Ryszard_Kuklinski:0 "Ryszard Kukliński"
 
 TML_not_yet_lost: "Not Yet Lost"
 TML_not_yet_lost_desc: "The Autonomous Soviet Liberation Army is an organization born by defeat after crushing defeat - the last hope of a coalition of Poles, Russians, and Kazakhs to drive the forces of madness and terror out of Kazakhstan, and finally build a better place in the wasteland. So long as the Liberation Army endures, hope shall exist for all those in Western Kazakhstan oppressed by ultranationalists and fanatics. With the hope for a better day behind them, Kukliński's forces shall drive on to liberate their home, and never stop until the last soldier falls."

 # Idel-Ural Free State #
 TMQ_Joint_Council_of_the_Free_Peoples:0 "Joint Council of the Free Peoples"
 
 TMQ_bitter_survivors: "Bitter Survivors"
 TMQ_bitter_survivors_desc: "Persecuted by the tsar's empire, and exterminated en masse by the Regent's, the nations of the steppe peoples have suffered significant depopulation, oppression, and trauma beyond measure. Bitterly gripping their rifles, handguns, and axes, the peoples of the Idel-Ural Free State shall grimly resist to the last, and remain eternally vigilant and distrustful of those that they see as collaborators with Taboritsky's horrific regime. Each and every Great Russian is a source of scrutiny from the government of the Free State - whilst they themselves may not have committed atrocities, it is Great Russians who have brought horror upon minorities time and time again - and who is to say that they will not collaborate with yet another oppressor in the future?"

 # Ural Purification Zone #
 TMU_Yuri_Evtukhovich:0 "Yuri Evtukhovich"

 TMU_horsemans_ride: "The Horseman's Ride"
 TMU_horsemans_ride_desc: "Evtukhovich has no desire to build anything out of the lands of the Idel-Ural Free State, nor does he desire any position other than that of General of the Imperial Guard. His task is merely to cleanse the rebelling steppe peoples with flame, gas, and shot - and that is what he shall do, in his quest to serve the Blessed Regent and the Empire. Any method is just, so long as it leads to the imperial flag rising over the ruins of Kazan once more - to drown the fields of Russia in the blood of separatists and subhumans is merely a bonus."

 # Revolutionary Communes of Orenburg #
 TMN_Mikhail_Pervukhin:0 "Mikhail Pervukhin"
 
 TMN_new_land_of_iron: "The New Land of Iron"
 TMN_new_land_of_iron_desc: "With the failure of the old communes to protect the peoples of Orenburg, and the horrific regime fostered upon the once free communes by Taboritsky's mad regency, the now-radicalized population of Orenburg has turned to the ideology professed by the Party men from Tyumen to defend themselves from a potential imperial resurgence. Under Pervukhin, Orenburg is being transferred into a land of iron and industry, with every resource possible being poured into strengthening the state."

 TMN_last_revolution: "The Final Revolution"
 TMN_last_revolution_desc: "The effects of Pervukhin's revolution have been profound - and hardly pleasant. Revolutionary fervor has once more gripped Orenburg, trials of collaborators are still underway, and even the slightest bit of evidence against one's neighbor may have them facing a revolutionary tribunal. In this state of eternal revolution against reaction, the new Revolutionary Communes cannot afford to spare mercy."

 # Kazakh Purification Army #
 TMP_Safa_Gaziz: "Safa Gaziz"
 TMP_eye_for_an_eye: "Eye for an Eye"
 TMP_eye_for_an_eye_desc: "So it was written in ancient times, so must it be once more. The Russians have butchered us like cattle, sullied our bloodline with their putrid seed, and driven us to the very brink of annihilation. There can be no peace in the steppes of our homeland until every last Russian is reduced to scattered bones, scourged white by the desert winds."

 # Russian Empire #
 TMG_Alexei_II:0 "Alexei II"

 TMG_the_pretender_of_the_people: "The Pretender of the People"
 TMG_the_pretender_of_the_people_desc: "Russia is once again in a time of troubles, and like the false Dmitris of old, an impostor has seized the throne. Alexei's fledging empire, despite the Emperor's origins, is an odd island of stability in the wastes. Rejecting the racial theories of the Regent, he takes up the mantle of Peter and Catherine the Great, his enlightened despotism securing what may be one of the last pockets of sane rule in the new anarchy."
 
 TMG_a_red_tsar: "A Red Tsar?"
 TMG_a_red_tsar_desc: "Whilst Alexei II's past is unknown to the people he rules over, in reality, he was an NKVD agent, and a bureaucrat of the Soviet Union. Whilst his hidden, personal ideology may be a far cry from Yagoda's Bolshevism, Alexei II must still be careful to not break the mythology he has created with radical reforms - the faith of the people must lie in the tsar himself, not in dead ideologies."
 
 # Holy Regency of Russia #
 TMY_Andrey_Dikiy:0 "Andrey Dikiy"

 TMY_all_alone: "All Alone"
 TMY_all_alone_desc: "Surrounded on all sides by those who hated Taboritsky, and far from the old heartlands, the self-proclaimed Blessed Regent Dikiy waves between sobbing fits of despair and delusions of grandeur. As the last bastion of Russian Nazism in the east, it is at least somewhat comforting for his subjects to know how tenuous and miserable an existence he leads."
 
 # Amur Refugee Zone #
 TMR_Anatoly_Sobchak:0 "Anatoly Sobchak"

 TMR_critical_supply_shortage: "Critical Supply Shortage"
 TMR_critical_supply_shortage_desc: "Despite Sobchak's best efforts, there are simply too many mouths to feed and not enough to go around. The people, starving in the cold, are dying - only to be replaced by even more refugees. Foreign aid is the only possible solution, but until it arrives, they must make do with what they have."
 
 # Free Port of Magadan #
 TMM_Nikolai_Abramov:0 "Nikolai Abramov"

 TMM_shiver_my_soul: "Shiver My Soul"
 TMM_shiver_my_soul_desc: "Operating out of Eastern Siberia is not easy for any fleet, primarily due to the lack of ice-free ports. The frigid conditions alone can turn even the hardiest sailors away to seek better prospects. However, so long as there are hungers as strong as the wind and tides, enterprising and ruthless captains will continue to sail the Arctic waters in search of profit."
 
 TMM_greed_and_felony: "Greed and Felony"
 TMM_greed_and_felony_desc: "Smuggling is Abramov's primary concern, given that piracy is simply too dangerous an endeavour, but that doesn't make him harmless. On the contrary - the fascist admiral will quite happily resort to murder if it expedites business."
 
 # United Siberian Salvation Council #
 TMC_Nikolai_Artamonov:0 "Nikolai Artamonov"

 TMC_a_light_from_the_east: "A Light From the East"
 TMC_a_light_from_the_east_desc: "The rallying and propaganda from Artamonov and the OSKS have led to a strange sense of hope from the Siberian people. Already, wild and idealistic depictions of the United States are abound in Petropavlovsk as the nation prepares for American salvation. Many in Artamonov's control know that his promises may prove empty - but compared to the despots and radicals of years past, there is something meaningful in being given a promise at all."
 
 # The Institute # 
 TMI_Nikolai_Kardashev:0 "Nikolai Kardashev"

 TMI_visionary_enclave: "Visionary Enclave"
 TMI_visionary_enclave_desc: "The Institute, above all, is an enclave founded to follow the goal of a better world through science and reason. The resources of Chelyabinsk have been put to use once more, as means of developing and manufacturing goods which may be used to reclaim the wastes, and restore a semblance of civilization. Under Director Kardashev, the Institute is focusing on a way to chemically reclaim the poisoned soil and water of Russia - and, with the last major concentration of scientists and visionaries in Russia, it may very well be that the Institute is the last hope for a livable Russia."

 TMI_the_cutting_edge: "The Cutting Edge"
 TMI_the_cutting_edge_desc: "While the Institute's forces are small, the infrastructure of Chelyabinsk means that they are capable of equipping an army with capabilities that outstrip their size. With each soldier bearing their finest advances, it is guaranteed that the Institute, if challenged, shall not go quietly."

 # Black Bandits #
 TMX_Androniy_Mishurenko:0 "Androniy Mishurenko"

 TMX_Black_Bandits: "Black Bandits"
 TMX_Black_Bandits_desc: "Less generous views of Makhno's anarchist fiefdom in Ukraine painted it as nothing more than the personal kingdom of a brutal, nepotistic bandit claiming to be a liberator. Whether or not one agrees with that interpretation, it certainly applies to Mishurenko's new "free society" - not that he seems to care."

 # Nenets Aviators #
 TMF_Alexander_Zyvagin:0 "Alexander Zyvagin"

 TMF_depleted_population: "Depleted Population"
 TMF_depleted_population_desc: "Nenetsia was never highly populated region. Though the influx of refugees and partisans from neighboring lands has alleviated the loss of population to the Regent's genocides, the Free Army remains undermanned. Were it not for the surviving Free Aviators, they would surely be at the mercy of the Airborne Brigades to the west."

 # Imperial Air Brigades #
 TMD_Ivan_Melkikh:0 "Ivan Melkikh"

 TMD_sky_reavers: "Sky Reavers"
 TMD_sky_reavers_desc: "Airborne bandits are a new and terrifying plague upon the benighted lands of Russia. Descending from the skies faster than any land-bound vehicle, their helicopter fleet allows the Airborne Brigades to surround, pillage and raze flat whatever isolated community they please before their rivals can respond. It will take more than a few old planes from the 40s to end their reign of terror."

 # Trans Ural Confederancy #
 TMT_Hadji_Umar_Mamsurov:0 "Hadji-Umar Mamsurov"
 
 TMT_memories_of_heroism: "Memories of Heroism"
 TMT_memories_of_heroism_desc: "More than their shared heritage as Russians, what defines the Confederation's members is their collective martial tradition. Within their hearts reside the iron will of the NKVD, the resilience of the Ural Guard and the discipline of the Third Army. Come what may, none shall find them wanting."

 # Kingdom of Altay #
 TMH_Boris_I:0 "Boris I"
 
 TMH_The_Practical_Kingdom: "The Practical Kingdom"
 TMH_The_Practical_Kingdom_desc: "At times, the Kingdom of Altay scarcely feels like a kingdom at all. King Boris is a monarch without a throne or castle, often going days or weeks without wearing his crown. While his focus on Altay's necessities has saved precious lives and resources, the drab nature of his rule has created problems with morale - how can a nation dream when its leader cannot?"

 # FUNNI SATANISTIC GANG #
 TMB_Abaddon:0 "Abaddon"

 TMB_evil_unbound: "Evil Unbound"
 TMB_evil_unbound_desc: "Only the worst of the SS could hope to match Abaddon's followers in cruelty and sadism. Serial killers and nihilistic brutes are the vaunted elite of this new society, their inhumanity cloaked in religious fervor born of their old commander's charismatic ravings against a world gone mad."
 TMB_deranged_cult: "Deranged Cult"
 TMB_deranged_cult_desc: "Never before in the history of the world has Satanism - true, unadulterated devil worship - expanded beyond a fringe cult. But times have changed, and the world has tilted on a diagonal. Though most of the Brotherhood's members are little more than ordinary bandits, the ideology of their insane leader is slowly but surely proliferating down the ranks. Someday, the name of Satan will be praised throughout Omsk without a hint of irony."

 # The Redeemed Black League #
 TMO_Alexander_Lazarenko:0 "Alexander Lazarenko"

 TMO_insular_enclave: "Insular Enclave"
 TMO_insular_enclave_desc: "Lazarenko believes only those born and raised within the Black League's borders are true Russians. As such, they keep a close watch on their own population, deter or shoot refugees on sight, and brutally subjugate any groups that they come into possession of rather than integrating them. Their population is small and will remain so, but each and every member is fanatical in their devotion, fully prepared to lay down their lives for the cause."
 TMO_redemptionary_service: "Redemptionary Service"
 TMO_redemptionary_service_desc: "Whilst the commanders of the Black League maintain that only those born within their territory are truly worthy of membership, the brutal Redemptionary Brigades remain as a means of acquiring the birthright. Through years of service in a Redemptionary Brigade, one may finally acquire the right to Black League membership and gain the League's trust - if one survives."

 # New Tomsk #
 TMJ_Alexander_Zinoviev:0 "Alexander Zinoviev"

 TMJ_legacy_of_the_salons: "Legacy of the Salons"
 TMJ_legacy_of_the_salons_desc: "Though they faced great persecution by Holy Russia, some former Salon members - primarily Bastillards and Decembrists - remained in or near Tomsk throughout Taboritsky's reign of terror. When New Tomsk was formed, the Salons were revived, albeit much reduced and with only a shadow of their former power. For now, they have put aside most arguments in the interest of surviving, but only time will tell if this arrangement will hold."

 TMJ_Crumbling_City: "Crumbling City"
 TMJ_Crumbling_City_desc: "Ravaged by the Shturmoviki with several districts levelled completely to suppress its democratic spirit, Tomsk struggles even as it endures. It will take much time to restore the city to what it once was from the fraction that remains."

 # Free Kazakh States #
 TMK_Sultanakhmet_Kozhikov:0 "Sultanakhmet Kozhikov"
 TMK_scarred_steppes: "The Kazakh States"
 TMK_scarred_steppes_desc: "Kazakhstan was re-occupied for only a short few years, but the damage done is incalculable. Entire tribal identities were erased overnight, and population centers wiped from the landscape. The people of the steppes survive, as they always have, but it will be many long decades before the legacy of Taboritsky's genocidal imperialism is erased from Central Asia."

 # Central Eurasian Republic #
 TME_Mikhail_Baganov:0 "Mikhail Baganov"
 TME_Benevolent_Authoritarianism: "Benevolent Authoritarianism"
 TME_Benevolent_Authoritarianism_desc: "Taking lessons from the non-ideological government of Novosibirsk, Baganov's regime has chosen to reject all politics beyond pragmatism. So long as any part of the Holy Russian Empire survives, the threat of Nazism's resurgence is real and present. For the good of all, the emergency government must clothe itself in both velvet and iron in equal measure."

 # Siberian Free Territory #
 TMW_Yevgeniya_Taratuta:0 "Yevgeniya Taratuta"
 TMW_Empty_Magazines_Full_Hearts: "Empty Magazines, Full Hearts"
 TMW_Empty_Magazines_Full_Hearts_desc: "With the eradication of the Black Army, the general devastation of Russia, and now the military state under Mishurenko having turned against them, the Free Territory lacks the material means to wage a modern war. Despite this, every peasant knows they are defending the last chance their communes have at true freedom, and they fight with this knowledge in their heads and their comrades at their side."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_ZINOVIEV_AM_DESC: "An opponent of the USSR during its existence, Alexander Alexandrovich Zinoviev is a man with philosophical inclinations, who has nonetheless been spurred into action in his country's time of need. Nearly conscripted during the first war with the Germans, the USSR fell before he could be brought to the front. Zinoviev made his way to the newly established Central Siberian Republic in the aftermath, seeing it as a beacon of relative tolerance and stability, and joined the Bastillard Society, rising to an undistinguished position in their leadership. With the rest of the leadership of the Bastillards dead or missing as a result of the vicious purges of the Empire, he has taken charge of the rebuilding of Tomsk, large portions of which were leveled by imperial forces. Deeply haunted by the devastation of the Modernist and Humanist societies, Zinoviev is very willing to compromise in order to ensure the continuation of much needed stability."

 POLITICS_ABADDON_AM_DESC: "As Shturmoviki commander Antoly Andreevich Motsny watched as the Russian monster state collapsed, he was a man lost. After the death of Sergey Taboritsky, the empire was shattered, its armies scattered across Russia. As warlords and subhumans fought in the ruins, Motsny and his unit took hold of the fortress city of Omsk. It was in Omsk that Motsny learned the gut-churning truth: Taboritsky, His Most Holy Regent to the Blessed Tsar, was nothing other than a disguised Jew. The revelation shook the devout Motsny to his very core and forced into doubt all he had ever believed in.\n\nAs Motsny ruined his own flesh and imbibed hallucogenic drugs in search of the truth, the answer became painfully clear. Taboritsky was indeed a holy man, the true prophet of God, just as he was a Jew. If God would permit this vile creature to be his servant on earth, then what use was there in worshipping him? Motsny felt terribly alone, cut off from his faith and alone in a hostile world. That was, until a second epiphany came to him. If God would ally himself with Jews, then His enemy, mighty Lucifer, must be the true savior of Mankind.\n\nWith the hole in his soul mended by newfound devotion to his dark master, Motsny has abandoned his former life and adopted the moniker of Abaddon, the High Priest of Satan. From Omsk, he commands his Brotherhood of Cain to tear down the decadent and insipid monuments of Christianity and of Taboritsky the Arch-Jew. A dedicated occultist and believer in blood-sorcery, Abaddon demands that fresh captives be brought to the bowels of Omsk to be made as offerings to his beloved Morning Star."
 
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_LARIONOV_AM_DESC: "In the chemical ridden hellhole that is Russia, hatred thrives, new and old. Viktor Aleksandrovich Larionov is one such symbol of old hatred, the newest Regent of the Holy Russian Empire following Taboritsky's footsteps.\n\nFormerly a soldier in Wrangel's White Army during the Civil War, and later, an officer of the ROA during World War II, Viktor came to become a close associate of Taboritsky. Following his death, Larionov was appointed as head of cabinet following the power struggle, after which he promptly made use of his Shturmoviki to purge any opposition, proclaiming himself as Blessed Regent of the Holy Russian Empire.\n\nNow nestled in Vyatka, the Blessed Regent keeps paving the way for the rightful monarch's return, though his belief in Alexei's return specifically remains questionable as opposed to his predecessor. But, isolated in the Russian wasteland with few followers - most of those kept in line through fear and bribery, Larionov is but a mere mad man leading a realm of thieves and raiders."

 POLITICS_SAFA_GAZIZ_AM_DESC: "A long time ago, a certain German philosopher warned that one should be careful of not becoming a monster himself in the process of fighting them. Unfortunately, Safa Gaziz is now but a reflection of the Mad Regent's reign of terror.\n\nOriginally a minor NKVD officer of the Kazakh SSR before the Soviet Union's demise, Safa led a relatively quiet life prior to Taboritsky's reign of terror in Kazakhstan. Under the Holy Russian Empire's occupation of his homeland, Gaziz led a group of raiders and partisans, wreaking havoc in the countryside against Russian forces.\n\nAs time went on, his hatred for the Russians and Slavs as a whole grew, removing the "-ov" Russian suffix of his surname as a sign of rejecting any Slav cultural influence. Now that the Regent lies dead, Gaziz and his clique of hatred filled partisans have risen up to purify their homeland of any Pole or Russian foolish enough to set foot in Kazakhstan.\n\nHe who fights monsters should look to it that he himself does not become one himself..."
 
 POLITICS_SULTANAKHMET_KOZHIKOV_AM_DESC: "Even in the face of oppression and death, mankind finds a way to cling onto hope, something that can be seen in the Free Kazakh Clans's continued existence in the Kazakh wastelands of the former Holy Russian Empire.\n\nThough his name might be hard to remember in its entirety, the impact that Sultanakhmet Kongyrkhodzhayevich Kozhikov has had over the remaining Kazakhs is unforgettable: a soldier of the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War, the future leader of the Free Clans became a grassroot movie director following the USSR's collapse, seeking to show the life and traditions of his people.\n\nThis came to be an important detail, as he saw his homeland fall under the Mad Regent's reign of terror and sought to show the horrors his people were subject to under the Holy Russian Empire through his underground photography documentation. Through this, he came to be elected by the unified councils of the Free Kazakh Clans at their first gathering following the fall of Taboritsky's regime.\n\nA beacon of hope in these war-torn lands, Sultanakhmet will lead his people towards a better tomorrow, one where their way of life is no longer threatened."
 
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_KARDASHEV_AM_DESC: "Once a brilliant physicist working to ensure the continuation of Russian scientific advancement even as the land fell into anarchy, Nikolai Semenovich Kardashev was finally sent to a death camp just before the death of Taboritsky. After escaping in a large prison uprising occurring in the chaos that followed, Kardashev went to Chelyabinsk, located nearby the camp that once held him, and found a society of scientists and researchers already working in hiding to build a better society out of the inevitable ashes. Quickly taking charge of this group, Kardashev used his excellent administrative skills to attract other intellectuals as well as partisans and former NKVD officers to serve as security forces. As a result of his hard work in developing this haven for progress, he was elected Director of the Chelyabinsk Institute by his colleagues."
 
 POLITICS_ANDREY_DIKIY_AM_DESC: "Andrei Ivanovich Dikiy was a longtime associate of the Blessed Regent, dating back to the days before the rise of the Regency. He rose rapidly within the ranks of the Regency, ingratiating himself to the Regent whenever and wherever he could. When the collapse happened, Dikiy found himself in the Far East, overseeing the purification of the region. After the pretender, the morally-decrepit pit of subhumanity masquerading as the so-called "Alexei II", Andrei Ivanovich knew the truth. Marshalling what soldiers he could, he rose against the pretender, dedicated to putting down who he referred to as the "satanic impostor".\n\nIn reality, Dikiy is little more than a naked, power-hungry cretin with few true ideological convictions past the all-consuming desire for power. As the political machine that he helped build and reinforce fell apart around him, he did not weep or grieve. Where his former compatriots saw tragedy, he saw opportunity. Equipped with a dogged desire to empower himself, he views the destruction of Alexei II and his movement as his ticket to acquiring enough legitimacy to declare himself the true Regent of a resurgent Holy Russian Empire."

 POLITICS_ANDRONIY_MISHURENKO_AM_DESC: "Androniy Afanasyevich Mishurenko is the leader of an all-new Black Army that rules over what remains of the wastes of Siberia. After the horrors of the Mad Regent, Mishurenko stoked the flames of internal dissent within the remnants of the Siberian Black Army, breaking off the Bratsk Communal Vanguard under his personal protection. Now, his warriors ride about the desolate remains of the countryside, tasked with securing order in the communes. He claims to be the true heir to the Black Army, a personal protector of anarchist ideals and a warrior for equality, forced into his despotic position by the circumstantial horror of the Holy Russian Empire. Most, however, see him as little more than a bandit king with delusions of grandeur."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_ALTUNIN_AM_DESC: "As the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed around him, Alexander Terenyevich Altunin shouldered the crushing weight of defeat once more. A war hero during the West Russian War, he was known for coordinating logistics to the Front and protecting refugee convoys during the darkest period of the war.\n\nHe played a similarly important role during the brief resurgence of the Front in its bid to reunify Russia, but as defeat swept over Altunin and his comrades once more, he was spared the fate of death. Fleeing to the Far North and living in an obscure fishing village, he survived the nightmare.\n\nWhen Taboritsky died, Altunin, crippled by survivor's guilt, stepped forth. Coming out of hiding and inspired by his past successes against the Germans, he has taken up the reins of the so-called North Russian Liberation Front, an organization dedicated to the plight of the Russians of the North West. However, he cannot alleviate the suffering of the people while hiding behind the curtain of ideology. By heading the Liberation Front, Altunin has made the choice to abandon ideology, and perhaps the very notion of a unified Russia to ensure that his land begins to heal from the deep scars of Taboritsky."

 POLITICS_ALEXEI_II_AM_DESC: "Who is he? A man? A god? An idea? Each Russian has their own answer, Taboritsky's Imperial Cult having stained Alexei's name into the collective consciousness of the Russian people. Many understand him as the nightmare, the final end that awaits them all. Others, styling themselves as more rational than the rest, view him as naught but a name, used to justify the most horrid of crimes. But to some, he is the avenging angel of the people; the light, the guide, the savior of Russia.\n\nHe watched as his people slaughtered each other in his absence, saw the rise of the Reichsadler and the fall of the Motherland, and wept as the Regent, the wretched despoiler of all Creation, plunged Russia into its darkest chapter. His people find themselves broken and beaten, with no hope of recovery. They till ravaged fields, eat poisoned food, and salt the earth further with their tears. Russia calls out in agony for something to save it from destruction; the voices of suffering millions begging the void for someone to bring them salvation.\n\nAnd finally, Alexei answered.\n\nBorn Michael Goleniewski, he has seen the triumph of Nazism everywhere it has stepped foot. His Polish homeland fell in mere weeks, the Union didn't survive the onslaught, and even the Americans surrendered before the power of the atom. His heart lies with the people, socialistic tendencies bleeding into his governance as tsar.\n\nBut he is no extremist. Russia has suffered more than any people ought to; dying three times in under a century, each more brutal than the last. Now is not the time for ideology or division. Russia needs to be reborn once more, and Michael will take up the mantle of its phoenix.\n\nGod has not seen fit to help Russia, but Alexei lives, and he loves his subjects."

 POLITICS_ANATOLY_SOBCHAK_AM_DESC: "For every hundred tales of loss and sorrow, there's one of survival that gives the faintest glint of hope in what often seems to be a doomed land. The story of Anatoly Aleksandrovich Sobchak is one of those tales.\n\nFormerly involved in the monarchist White movement in Chita during the early 60s, he was mayor of the major Far Eastern city. When the Whites were on the brink of defeat, he fled the city with a meager handful of friends, first into the Siberian wilderness before covertly slipping over the border to Manchukuo. When he was there, he helped rebuild whatever sort of a Russian expatriate community was left in Harbin.\n\nWhen news arrived in the Manchurian city that the "Blessed Regent" had died and that his empire was rapidly crumbling, Anatoly Aleksandrovich made one of the hardest decisions of his life: he went back.\n\nCrossing the Amur with no more than two dozen followers, Sobchak founded what he called the Amur Refugee Zone, swearing that he will use his international connections in the Sphere and the West to bring in all the foreign aid he could to what few people remained in Eastern Siberia. Sobchak has dedicated his life to an attempt at alleviating the vast suffering that has been inflicted upon the Far East."

 POLITICS_BORIS_I_AM_DESC: "When Boris Nikolaevich Krylov refused his father's offer to be made a prince in his kingdom, he remained as a general in the kingdom's military. But his position wouldn't last - as the city of Kemerovo fell to their enemies, Boris narrowly escaped the probable fate of the rest of his family.\n\nHiding out as a fugitive in the Central Siberian wilderness, he eventually settled in a small village under an assumed name. As the Holy Russian Empire swept eastwards and established their administration within Siberia, nightmarish atrocities descended upon the population of Siberia as the Blessed Regent's agents turned brother against brother and father against son.\n\nWhen the news came to Boris that the Regent had died, he believed it to be false. But as the wanton killing ebbed, and the terror evaporated, dread was replaced by anxiety - what would be the future for Siberia?\n\nBelieving that any central authority was required to inspire trust and hope within the people who had survived the Holy Russian Empire, he assumed the mantle he never wanted: Boris I, King of Altay. His rule, kind and fair-handed to Russians and the few surviving minorities alike, has earned him many friends."
 
 POLITICS_HADJI_UMAR_MAMSUROV_AM_DESC: "Even as Hadji-Umar Dzhiorovich Mamsurov leads a nation, his heart still screams in defeat.\n\nIn a better time, Mamsurov was a commander in the Ural League, protecting his people from the tides of tyranny that had surrounded them. When Taboritsky's men invaded, Mamsurov fought to the end, but to no avail. As Mamsurov lost contact with battalion after battalion, the truth gradually became clear to him - the Ural League was gone, and his men were alone.\n\nWith the Guard's destruction, many lost hope and surrendered to the Regent and his madmen. Yet Mamsurov did not - could not - let go of the dream. As the Empire rose and fell, Mamsurov and his band of partisans never ceased their struggle. Years later, when Taboritsky's death tore apart the Empire, Mamsurov at last returned to liberate whoever could be saved from the madness to come.\n\nWith the partisans victorious, Mamsurov has certainly spared some precious few - but he is certain he could have done more. The Urals' new leader still sees visions of the world he promised his people, where his men beat back Taboritsky and saved the land to which they were sworn. But there is no time for regret. The Urals need a new protector, one strong enough to save them from any foe. As Mamsurov walks through empty villages and charred forests, he is certain that this duty falls to him."

 POLITICS_HADJI_UMAR_MAMSUROV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "In an ideal world, Hadji-Umar Dzhiorovich Mamsurov would have enjoyed a very well deserved, long-delayed retirement after decades of fighting against fascism in all its shapes, and forms. Yet, as the thrums of the Black League washed over the Urals, a black uniform not worn by bandits of pillaging, but his kin up north brought upon the old soldier an outrage seldom seem.\n\nSo did the old soldier raise his chin, gathering the brave and the survivors, and cast his lot with Batov's insurgency, for one final fight against another foe borne from a cauldron of hatred. Now, the sun shines from the blighted night cast by the League, its dying throes still spewing poison and rot in his loved motherland.\n\nDreams of retirement have faded from the old soldier's mind, as he knows, deep in his heart, no rest ever comes for the righteous."

 POLITICS_YEVGENIYA_TARATUTA_AM_DESC: "A former member and ideologue of the old Siberian Black Army, Yevgeniya Aleksandrovna Taratuta survived the purges imposed by the empire on her fellow anarchists, and came out of the experience more determined than ever to free the Russian people from the chains of the state, having witnessed firsthand the depths to which a government could sink. Having rallied those of her old allies that remained, Taratuta seeks to restore the Free Territory as it once was, a beacon of freedom in a land in desperate need of it. She will show the world that Russia can be free, can rise above the depredations of the Holy Russian Empire, or die trying."
 
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_PERVUKHIN_AM_DESC: "No amount of reactionary thuggery could ever extinguish the flame of Bolshevism in Russia, and Mikhail Georgiyevich Pervukhin is living proof of that.\n\nWith the death of Kaganovich and subsequent collapse of the Tyumen government, Pervukhin followed his last orders and led the last few Stalinists on an odyssey towards the Southern Urals. There, he found fertile ground for a revolution, which he planned for and organized from a mountain hideout, in expectation of the moment for Taboritsky's reactionary monstrosity would finally collapse. When that day came, the Bolshevik coup was swift, and General Secretary Mikhail Pervukhin was sworn in as chairman of the Orenburg Revolutionary Communes.\n\nIn other circumstances, it is likely that a regime so fanatically dedicated to the ideals of the late Kaganovich would be intolerable to any population that aspires to a dignified living. In fact, there could scarcely have been a less-fertile breeding ground for a dictatorship of the proletariat as totalitarian as Pervukhin's, than the patchwork former anarchist villages around Orenburg. Such was the extent of sheer oppression practiced by Taboritsky's men, that an eventuality so unlikely became first a foretold certainty, and then a fact. Indeed, for many whom just a decade earlier professed an unbound love of liberty and freedom; Pervukhin's cult of personality, all-encompassing iteration of the NKVD, and absolute control over every facet of economic life; are now harsh but fair measures.\n\nFor Pervukhin himself, the situation could scarcely be more exciting. In effect, the revolutionary Southern Urals: besieged, impoverished, and ravaged as they are, form a perfect analogy to the Russia of 1917. It is only fair, in turn, that Pervukhin be considered its Lenin."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_IZEKOV_AM_DESC: "Sergey Mikhailovich Izvekov was not special. He, like many other priests of the Orthodox faith, fled the Holy Russian Empire after the revelation of Taboritsky's hellish perversion of the church. Izvekov helped those he could, leading them out of the nightmare and into the city of Samara. Things were not much better in the former capital of the ROA, but Izvekov and his companions kept their faith alive. They hid in sewers, basements, and in the forests, praying that the nightmare would end.\n\nAnd end it did with the death of the Blessed Regent. The people of Samara rose up, casting off their chains and sending their oppressors back to Hell. Once the city was freed, a new order was established.\n\nCommunism, fascism, tsarism, the hated Regent, all had led Russia deeper into ruin. No, another way must be found, and so the people of Samara looked to God. It was His kindness that led Izvekov, now Vladyka Pimen, to become the first ruler of the theocratic republic of Samara, earning the love and respect of his people to garner enough votes in the first election.\n\nVladyka Pimen is not a weak man, and knows that Larionov rants and raves from Vyatka. It is only a matter of time before the second Blessed Regent turns his guns on the Christian Republic. When he comes, the people of Samara will be ready with faith and steel, and Vladyka Pimen will lead them."

That flame burns within Ryszard Jerzy Kukliński, and within every Pole in his Autonomous Soviet Liberation Army. Once an officer in Nowa Polska, Kukliński has gathered together a ragtag assortment of Poles, Kazakh freedom fighters, antifascists, and Russians, taking command of his little slice of Kazakhstan.\n\nHis is a battle of life and death, of freedom against certain extermination. Kukliński's primary objective is the destruction of Safa Gaziz's insane regime and the establishment of a free socialist state on the steppe. Bread and work for all, and a bullet for the mad dogs that haunt the hellscape."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_TALBERG_AM_DESC: "In the withering eyes of Nikolai Dmitrievich Talberg, there is only power or death.\n\nFirst a government official under the monarchy and later a devout monarchist professor, Nikolai Talberg expected his final days to be papers and lectures in the halls of the Komi Republican Academy. Everything changed when Talberg gained the favor of Taboritsky. Soon, Talberg became the first elder statesman to support the imperial government, and was handpicked by Taboritsky to lead his corporate council. Under Talberg's leadership, the Imperial Mercantile Consortium grew to become the servile beast of the empire, churning through an ever-growing mass of slaves to build the weaponry of Taboritsky's army.\n\nWith Taboritsky's death, many felt the Consortium should take new management, but Talberg silenced any critics foolish enough to state such ideas openly. Instead, Talberg quietly broke from his obedience to Vyatka. Free of its master, the consortium shifted focus, focusing only on ideals which could bring it further riches. Talberg became the leader of the empire's only grace - its empty wealth.\n\nStill, Talberg knows it will all end soon. Facing increasing bouts of illness, the leader has grown unable to sniff out traitors in the council, leaving dissent to fester underneath him. At times, Talberg fondly remembers times when he had students who believed in him and revered his every word. Today, Talberg wakes each day to a council of dogs, waiting to tear apart his domain at the first sign of weakness. And as Talberg grows older, he is only more certain that that day will come."

First came the Luftwaffe, then Taboritsky, and now Melkikh and his Imperial Airborne Brigade.

The enemy is numerous, better equipped and better trained. The only reason they haven't yet been overrun is their knowledge of the land. The Nenets know this, but their resolve is iron. Never again will the Nenets be enslaved by Russians. Never again will the Nenets be subjected to the nightmarish purges of the Taboritsky regime.\n\nNever again.\n\nNever Again..."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_BAGANOV_AM_DESC: "How can the human spirit endure the death of one's nation? How could such a spirit, no matter how resilient, endure the death of one's nation a second time? Mikhail Petrovich Baganov knows, though he wishes day after day that such knowledge was not his. A former Novosibirsk general, Baganov and a cluster of partisans, refugees, and anyone with legs with which to run, melted into the Altay when the madness that had engulfed Komi engulfed Siberia. In the forests and hills, they fought a desperate battle for survival, praying that the dawn would come. It never did.\n\nBaganov watched as Novosibirsk died; no, as Novosibirsk was murdered. As madmen, zealots, and sycophants tore his former country apart, Baganov wept bitter tears of grief. The Russia he once knew was raped, slaughtered, turned inside out, leaving only an ugly, brutalized exterior of blood and pain. As he and his partisans began to lose all hope and as Baganov considered ending his own life, a single ray of hope shined. Taboritsky, the Monster of Syktyvkar, was dead.\n\nAs the Holy Russian Empire began to collapse, Baganov seized his opportunity, his rag-tag army taking back his beloved Novosibirsk. In this new, old city, Baganov proclaims the death of Russia and the birth of a Eurasia free from the agony and hatred of past regimes. A new nation will live on, if it can only survive until dawn." 

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_LAZARENKO_AM_DESC: "Dmitry Yazov was wrong. The Teuton, for all his disgusting evil and inhumanity, was but one great enemy of the Russian race. Taboritsky and the men who followed him were not Teutons, but Russians horribly ridden by a Germanic ideological disease. In germ warfare, only the proper precautions and vaccinations can prevent an outbreak amongst your own population. To Alexander Ivanovich Lazarenko and his Redeemed Black League, hidden from the surface in their deep Plan Hydra bunkers, only the cold embrace of the earth ensured the purity of his soldiers.\n\nRussia is a corpse writhing with maggots, with each rancid grub wearing a uniform and proclaiming nations of their own. The Russians, once thought by Lazarenko to be the race to save Mankind from the horrors of Nazism, is now polluted beyond redemption. That is the ultimate cruelty of the Teuton, to have poisoned the very essence of the Russian race.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Alexander Lazarenko has proclaimed a new crusade, a Second Great Trial to cleanse the Russian people of their Teutonic pestilence. By bullet, gas, and shell, Russia will be redeemed. There is no other way."

 POLITICS_IVAN_MELKIKH_AM_DESC: "When Ivan Aleksandrovich Melkikh learned of Taboritsky's death, he supposed he couldn't be bothered much to care. The old man was dead, and so was his empire, no matter what Larionov says. The Imperial Airborne Brigades, the least politicized branch of Taboritsky's military machine, was now under the sole command of Melkikh. The old order is as dead as Taboritsky, and Melkikh, ever the ambitious man, has no intention of serving under another warlord. Why not, mused Melkikh, be a warlord himself? The new bandit king of the skies has taken well to his role, and he is served by cruel, uncompromising men who project his decrees through vicious thuggery.\n\nTaking to the skies in their helicopters in a grim parody of the Free Aviators, Melkikh and his cabal of airmen terrorize towns and villages in search of loot and entertainment.\n\nTownsfolk run inside cellars and nervously whisper prayers when they hear the chopping of the Brigade's propellers, cowering much as they did during the terror bombings of yore.\n\nStill waving the flag of their old formation, Melkikh reminds those he brutalizes and horrifies that though the Regent is dead, the airborne terror lives on."

 POLITICS_YURI_EVTUKOVICH_AM_DESC: "The Blessed Regent of the Holy Russian Empire may be dead, but the fighting spirit of his loyal subjects almost certainly is not. Even as the resplendent empire Taboritsky worked so hard to build continues to collapse at the seams, the dreaded Shturmoviki, his holy will made manifest, continue to fight tooth and nail against any they perceive to be enemies of the empire. Yuri Nikolaeivich Evtukhovich, commander of the Second Imperial Guard Division, is one such man who refuses to accept the continued disintegration of the Regent's legacy.\n\nYuri Evtukhovich was a steadfast ally of the Regent since the beginning, serving with what would eventually become the Shturmoviki amongst the dark street corners and alleys of Syktyvkar. The ascendance of OVRI and Sergey Taboritsky saw Evtukhovich being named as one of his key generals, and he proceeded to lead the resurgent empire's armed forces from one battle to the next, always conducting himself with the reckless brutality that so many have come to expect from the Regent's troops.\n\nNow, however, the situation has changed. The Blessed Regent has been struck down in his prime, and the empire is again at the brink of ruin. Evtukhovich and his troops find themselves cut off from the central government in Vyatka, and surrounded by all manner of hostile forces. So it is that the Second Imperial Guard Division and their commander once again march to war in the name of the blessed tsar.\n\nThe rumors may claim that the late Regent was a Jew in disguise, but the general dismisses this narrative in favor of his own. Sergey Taboritsky was called to the heavens, and Yuri Evtukhovich will fight bitterly to continue his holy mission on Earth."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ABRAMOV_AM_DESC: "Armageddon itself may have come to Russia, but that does not necessarily mean that one can no longer make a tidy profit. Enter Nikolai Ivanovich Abramov, a former associate of Konstantin Rodzaevsky's Russian Fascist Party who has always had a keen eye for opportunities; be they to increase his influence or to line his pockets.\n\nAfter the Russian Far East fell to the dark behemoth to the west, Abramov was one of the lucky few who were able to evade the gaze of Taboritsky's security forces. The RFP's naval wing, of which Abramov was an admiral, was never the most prestigious branch of the organization, and perhaps it was this fact that saved his life in the end. The good fortune would not stop there, though, as soon Taboritsky's regime would crumble with his apparent death, leaving Abramov in a key position to climb the ladder once again.\n\nWith the help of old contacts all across Amur, Abramov was able to carve out a slice of his own in the midst of the apocalypse, and he now finds himself in control of one of the only functional ports still left standing in Russia. Now that the dust has settled, he has offered all sorts of premium services for the privileged few who remain alive; be it safe passage away from the madness that has befallen Russia, or luxury goods from across the world.\n\nNot that he cares too deeply about Russia's plight, of course. Nikolai Abramov saw a chance to get rich, and he took it."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_ARTAMONOV_AM_DESC: "Nikolai Fedorovich Artamonov was once an unassuming man in a rather underappreciated branch of the Soviet military. Now, however, he may just be the last hope for the people of Kamchatka.\n\nAlthough he did not achieve much acclaim under the rule of Admiral Yumashev, he received some minor political influence when the forces of Far East overran the ports of Kamchatka. He was seen as the most competent man available to manage the local ports, and was given a comfy and relatively well-paid job to administer them in the name of the Far Eastern government. The good times would not last forever, though, as soon a great and terrible storm would blow in from the West.\n\nThe unprecedented scale of the atrocities committed by Sergey Taboritsky's armies served as a sobering reminder to Artamanov that this was a time of action, and to rest on his laurels would be an almost criminal breach of his responsibilities to the people of Kamchatka. With the aid of like-minded local leaders, Artamanov rallied what few remained into a statelet devoted towards a singular goal: the safety and security of Russia's survivors no matter what the cost. Desperate times call for unorthodox solutions, and Artamanov sees only one path forward: the immediate secession of Kamchatka from the state formerly known as Russia, and the admission of the region as a territory of the United States.\n\nSome say that this goal is laughable; a completely impractical solution thought up by a silly man. Artamanov sees no other option. In his eyes, every other avenue has failed, and only that shining city on a hill beyond the Bering Strait could possibly save Russia from total annihilation now."

 POLITICS_JOINT_COUNCIL_AM_DESC: "Even after nearly half a millennium spent under Russian domination, the peoples of the steppe have endured. Chauvinistic policies imposed upon them by the tsars of old did not manage to break their spirit, nor did the socially collectivistic nature of the Soviet Union wash away their sacred identity. The Tatars, Bashkirs, and so many other minority peoples began to believe that no matter who their masters were, their cultures would survive.\n\nThen came Sergey Taboritsky.\n\nWielding a capacity for cruelty that even the most belligerent of Russian autocrats would consider a bridge too far, Taboritsky and his dreaded Shturmoviki came down upon the minority cultures dotted across Russia's landscape like a ton of bricks, systematically wiping out communities with reckless abandon. As the Regent's dark grip upon the nation continued to tighten, it seemed as though the steppe peoples were, after so many years of proud existence, facing total extinction. Then, as though by divine intervention itself, Taboritsky was consumed by the dark abyss that he himself had created, and his regime followed.\n\nWith a chance to catch their breath, the minority communities of the steppe decided now was the time to come together for mutual defense, before the scourge to the north had another chance to finish their bloodthirsty mission. What resulted was the Joint Council, an administrative body for the so-called Idel-Ural Free State. With two representatives from each constituent republic, Tatar, Bashkir and Udmurt, as well as three to represent the people as a whole, the Council provides a level of representation that these besieged peoples have not experienced for some time.\n\nWhether or not they can preserve what remains of the sons and daughters of the steppe, however, remains to be seen..."

One more pill... just one more, to keep him awake.\n\nSome time had passed by the time he fell out of his fugue state. The sun had set; upon noticing, he immediately bolted upright, fear purging the lethargy from his veins. What if the Shturmovik outside had stuck his head in and seen him dozing? He had to compensate just in case - quickly! Snatching up the long strip of paper that had piled up by his feet, he scanned it with feverish eyes for some good news. What he saw, repeated over and over and over again, instead set him quivering as he realized the profound lack of good news to deliver.\n\n"NOVOSIBIRSK OURS STOP CITY AND SURROUNDS LIBERATED STOP FASCIST FORCES DEFEATED STOP REPUBLIC WILL STAND FOREVER STOP DEATH TO THE REGENCY STOP"\n\nIt was then that the guard deigned to enter and demand the situation report."

 after_midnight_collapse.2.d: "The wastes of Western Kazakhstan had been silent for a long time. Not a village had been left standing, following the crusade of the Shturmoviki against the barbarian race that populated the steppes and deserts of Russia's borderlands. It was assumed that final victory had come long ago, as one could comfortably travel the land without seeing a single soul.\n\nThen, on a cool, clear morning, just before dawn, there came a lone figure, running for his life across the arid, rocky terrain of the southern steppe. The tattered remains of a poncho flapped in the wind behind him. His black uniform, stripped of any insignia or emblems, stood out like an inkblot on fresh paper against the sun-scorched earth.\n\nBut insignia or no, there was no escaping the raging cloud of dust that bore down on him, with the thunder of hooves and gunning engines at its fore. The man had long since ceased any attempt to get a glimpse at his pursuers, focusing entirely on running as fast as his burning, screaming muscles would carry him. He had been doing so for an hour, and yet evaded them still - he knew they were toying with him.\n\nThen, mere seconds after that thought had crossed his mind, the earth-shaking tempest grew louder for the first time in twenty minutes; it was time. He had played their game, indulged their mocking offer of escape for long enough. The Shturmovik, for the first time in his life, found his courage. He turned around, raised his pistol, took aim at his onrushing pursuers...\n\nThen the front fender of a ZIS-3 slammed into him at top speed. With an impact that shook the driver and the crunch of wheels pulverizing bone, the imperial garrison finally fell."

Grains of sand carried across the skies from the Tarim Basin speckled the abandoned huts that comprised an abandoned fishing village, the inhabitants scattered before the gas and fire that had once rained from the skies.\n\nUntil today.\n\nThe sea was still pure, at least. That was something - it meant the fish stocks survived. Perhaps they were more numerous than ever, without the regular deductions made by Kazakh fisherfolk. It had been a hard few years living off rabbits, deer, and even horses in the wilderness. The sheep were too valuable to slaughter, and so they had remained even as their shepherds were reduced to travelling on foot like Russians. Countless days spent chasing rogue flocks without horses to keep pace, countless nights sleeping in the frigid steppes - finally come to an end.\n\nAnd yet, as Pariya sighed and waded into the shallows with her fishing spear, family at her back, she knew nothing would be the same again. They could return to the life they had yearned for, lived by countless generations of ancestors, but nothing would return her parents to life, repair the broken bloodline of their prize steeds, or heal the mustard gas scars that marred her skin.\n\nAt least they had their lives."

Nobody hailed them as they docked, and there was certainly no red carpet rolled out for the good captain. The sole presence was an imperial watchtower on the waterfront, which had previously been reduced to splinters with a single precise shot from two kilometers away. Quite a shot, if the gunnery chief did say so himself - which he did, loudly and with many a toast from his subordinates.\n\nThat very night, from the radio tower on the docks, the designated signal went out. Aging transmitters sent forth Abramov's message, along with the simple code to confirm that all was clear. No response ever came, but those who heard it did.\n\nThey arrived in a steady trickle - in yachts, rowboats, fishing ships, motorboats, dinghies, patrol boats, and even warships. The stream ran dry within days, but by then the port of Magadan was filled to overflowing, with dozens of vessels anchored outside the harbor's shelter, or lashed to each other for stability amidst the frigid waves. In the old town hall, ravaged by mortar fire and the telltale signs of a massacre, Abramov spread his arms in greeting before the assembled seamen and said just one thing:\n"

Every man and woman will know, at some point in their lives, the hardship of saying farewell to their mother for the last time. Yet, no personal tragedy could compare to what we have suffered as a whole. She, the great nation who gave all of us life, is no more."\n\n"After one's mother is laid to rest, it can be a nigh-insurmountable challenge to continue living as though nothing had changed.

When the cold of winter passes, we must emerge from the comfort of our abode and begin the sowing of a new harvest. Otherwise, the world will simply continue without us.

The march towards workers' liberation could be adversely affected by any number of factors, just as the construction of a house could be forestalled by inclement weather. That was simply a fact of life - and Marxism, by definition, dealt only in facts.\n\nAmong those facts, the inevitable victory of socialism was the most iron-clad of all. Even if the spirit was crushed, or the people enslaved, the idea would survive. It was the fated outcome of history. Servitude bred resentment; resentment bred anger; anger bred revolution. Sure as the sun would rise, the red banner of the working class would always fly triumphant over the graves of humanity's oppressors.\n\nMikhail Pervukhin understood this better than anyone. When the imperial banners were trampled into the mud by peasant uprisings, his faith in the scientific truth of socialism was validated yet again. He had seen priests, liberals, and deviationists alike cower before the reactionary juggernaut of Nazism; but he stood strong because he knew, just as he knew the sky to be blue, that the Regent would fall.\n\nNow that the yoke had been cast off by the people, they would need his guidance. Without a new steward to light the way, they would surely slide back into the same tendencies they had just rebelled against. Bukharin had led them off a cliff - but Pervukhin would lead them to victory upon a road built from the bones of the revolution's enemies. He would be so much more than another Bukharin."

Handing his binoculars to the captain, Menzies pointed directly at what he'd seen across the slate-gray waters of the North Pacific. "There," he said. "See it? That light, just up the shore from the seal colony. Think it's coming from the old pier." Even without the binoculars, he could see it, flickering like a distant car driving behind a thin treeline.\n\n"I see it," murmured Hill. "Not a lamp, though - something about it's not quite right. Maybe a small floodlight." He lowered the binoculars and squinted through the anaemic light of an Arctic dawn. "Whatever it is, it's flashing a signal at us. S.O.S., in fact."\n\nMenzies nodded. "I figured, but what for? Think the Russkies know we were watching 'em, and want to bait us?"\n\nHill had just opened his mouth to reply when someone shouted up the ladder behind them. "Hey, Captain! We just picked up a signal on an open frequency! Don't know what for, but there's someone on or near the shore, and they're calling for help in English!"\n\nHill hesitated only for a moment before the prospect of an alternative to another boring patrol, and of a decoration for heroism, won out. "Well, since they asked so nicely - tell the helmsman to bring us in closer! Get the lifeboats ready!"\n\nOn the shore, his hands sore from five hours of switching the floodlight on and off, a shivering young man saw the submarine ascend fully and turn towards him.

Before the Regent had personally selected him to rule the lands north of Lake Baikal, he had been a professor of history. Of all history's conundrums, one thing had always puzzled him: peasant rebellions. His thesis on the intellectual deficiencies of peasants, approved by the Imperial Ministry of Education, was established fact in state policy. That was precisely why he'd always had to be so harsh - how else would the stubborn wretches learn?\n\nIt seemed so foolish. What hope did peasants have against any kind of organised authority? Of course, they could potentially wreak devastation before a proper army could be brought to bear, but the moment resistance was met, they would crumble. The devastation, more than anything, came from the fact that there would be too few people to work the fields and keep the nation fed. What use was a life in the fields when it came to the task of delivering death?\n\nAs Kamarov had recently learned: quite a bit.\n\nHe had learned it through practical experience. The peasants' knowledge of the land allowed the garrison patrols to be picked off at leisure. Their resilience to hardship had rallied them together in a clandestine resistance. Most prominently, their courage was now beyond doubt in Kamarov's mind, thanks to their rapid and fearless storming of both his manor and the barracks.\n\nThe final lesson - that of the impressive, unyielding strength that swinging tools all day gave a peasant - was delivered on a sunny Monday morning, when the meek, doe-eyed young lady who tended the manor garden eviscerated him with a single swing of her sharpened shovel. The lessons learned could have been of much practical benefit to the empire - unfortunately, their memory was lost, along with the former professor's life, when the other peasants roared the name of Mother Anarchy and tore him to pieces with their bare hands."

When he had last sat at the desk across from the Merchant of Death, it had been to discuss security measures. Back then, it had been a splendid but tasteful room: carved wood, Swedish-made furnishings and prototype guns locked in their display cases. Now it was just another one of the opulent, over-indulgent money-sinks that every imperial governor just had to possess. Stained glass windows that completely obscured the view, velvet curtains with silver filigree, and the gold - so much gold, pillaged from wherever it could be found and plastered over half the room.\n\nShiryaev spat and kicked away the high-backed governor's chair, instead sitting down on the edge of the desk. At least that was still the one he remembered, albeit with gold leaf obscuring the hand-carved decorations. A bottle of French brandy next to him caught his eye, but he was still on the job - no time to be lounging around in comfortable chairs. He had a call to make.\n\nHundreds of kilometers away in Perm, Hadji-Umar Mamsurov sighed and picked up the phone which had roused him from a nap in one of the Regent's own chairs. "Shiryaev?" he mumbled. "Finished?"\n\n"I wouldn't be talking to you otherwise," came the terse but not unfriendly reply. "I've had word from Zaytsev, too. All your old forts are secure. He's running the stragglers out towards Orsk now." There was a long pause as Mamsurov closed his eyes and tried to find some joy in reclaiming the Ural Guard's home, but felt nothing more than grim satisfaction. "Mamsurov?"\n\n"Sorry," the old general said, opening his eyes to gaze out the window upon Perm's skyline.

Every heathen village they razed only seemed to create more subhuman partisans. No matter how deep they dug their fingers in, no matter how much violence went into the effort of uprooting the weeds, they could never reach the roots. The reports read success, but reality disagreed.\n\nWhen the apparatus supporting the genocide fell away, their enemies were ready. The years of preparation, of refusing open battle and picking off stray patrols, came to a sudden, violent end. From the hidden places of their homeland, the Tatars, Udmurts and Bashkirs struck out with a terrifying fury born of grief. Like a tidal wave, they swept north and east, washing away the forces of General Yuri Evtukhovich.\n\nBut even a tidal wave eventually recedes. Evtukhovich's forces, though reeling, now had their longtime foes in sight. Fear and hate fueled their black hearts, already embittered by years of gruesome struggle. The battle-lines finally solidified as the Imperial Guard found a foothold, and solid they would remain for many, many years thereafter.\n\nFor every civilian struck by a mortar, a Shturmovik or Guardsman would vanish while on sentry duty. When a Russian toppled into his trench with a hole in his head, the Guard's snipers would repay the favor in kind. Every time a barrage decimated a partisan squad, their comrades would be sure to lift a screaming officer upon a dozen bayonets by day's end. On and on and on it went, victims desperate for justice against a pack of butchers with their backs to the wall. There was no glory in it - only a vicious, all-consuming battle for survival."

Of course, he felt that any crown was too impressive for a man such as he.\n\n"It's time, your majesty," said the elderly monk who had draped a fur cloak over his shoulders. There was an insistent edge to his voice, and the king had the sense that he'd missed the first couple of times the monk had told him that.\n\n"Yes," the king replied simply. "Yes, I know. Forgive me, I am..." he swallowed, suddenly cold. "It's wrong," he finally said as he donned the broken crown. Catching a glimpse of himself in the mirror, he had to stifle a bitter chuckle - it was noticeably ill-fitting, much like he was for the title that had been thrust upon him.\n\nCaught up in yet another pothole of self-deprecation, he didn't notice that the monk had quietly shuffled past him and onto the balcony overlooking the town square.

Compared to the empire, even those cold-hearted killers were welcome among the populace. At that particular junction, Yazov's ideals of national vengeance seemed more appealing than ever.\n\nBut the Black League was not led by Yazov anymore.

Jets soared, guns blazed, and Guardsmen fell from the sky, trapped within the flaming prisons of their flying machines.\n\nThe Free Aviators had returned, and war with them. There would not be peace in Nenetsia - but justice still had a chance."

 after_midnight_collapse.20.d: "Victory - a thing long forgotten by Poland and her people. How long had it been? Forty years? Fifty? Since the war against the Bolsheviks, it had been nothing but defeat after defeat, despite minor successes. One might have forgiven the Polish for resigning themselves to it for all eternity.\n\nUntil one glorious, magnificent, and most recent day.\n\nThe survivors of Nowa Polska, who had resisted extermination for years, finally got their chance - and took it. As the garrison began to desert or clash over conflicting orders, the descendants of Sobieski took to the field in one final effort to reclaim their pride. They fought like the greatest of knights, but the battle's outcome was not yet assured in their favour.\n\nThen the cavalry arrived.\n\nRussians and Kazakhs alike added their colours to the Polish red and white. As one, the free people of the south struck a blow that decapitated the imperial forces in the region. On that day, more than one nation could say with pride:"

 after_midnight_collapse.21.d: "The refugee column trudged with no great alacrity across the grasslands of the southwest. From whence they were fleeing, even the smallest child was aware, for each had equally harrowing stories to tell of the Holy Russian Empire. As to where they were fleeing: that remained to be seen. Perhaps foolishly, they had headed south and west rather than towards the distant east - towards the Germans, in other words. Following the Volga, they hoped for... something. Anything, so long as it wasn't imperial rule. Perhaps Kazakhstan was not beyond reach.\n\nIt was on the ninety-second day of their trek that the first good omen was sighted: a Shturmovik, bloated, pale and riddled with holes, lying in the mud of the riverbank. A gruesome sight, but a welcome one. Then there was another. Then a third. Minutes later, they entered the battlefield, where scattered corpses in black uniforms lay unburied and rotting beneath the sky.\n\nIt was more than beautiful. It was a manifestation of God's justice upon Earth, that some great avengers had arisen to strike down evil. Beside the river, his dead eyes looking out upon the flowing waters, a headless Shturmovik tied to a post pointed forward, his arm fixed in place with bloodstained rivets.\n\nAs the column's leader peered to the horizon, the setting sun pierced the clouds behind him, casting illuminating rays upon something that glimmered and shone like burning gold.\n\nTwo days later, that once-distant beacon loomed before them, packed with people like themselves and watched by stern-faced men with white crosses painted on their helmets. There was not a Shturmovik in sight, save for the ones wrapped in cloth and awaiting burial along the roadside. It was dirty, crowded, noisy - but the Lord had guided them thence, and so they rejoined their people."

 after_midnight_collapse.22.d: "Another day, another letter from the insipid, self-appointed Regent. Talberg snorted and tossed it into the hearth, where it quickly burned down to curls of ash. The deluded old soldier was playing at dictatorship, but with none of the charisma or drive of Taboritsky. The Blessed Regent had been a... difficult man, at times, but Talberg and his compatriots owed their prosperity to him.\n\nThe old man felt a coughing fit coming on, and quickly clamped a mottled hand over his mouth, while the other reached into his pocket for a handkerchief. He convulsed and wheezed for half a minute; his lungs burned by the time it subsided. Wiping the flecks of blood from his hand and lips, Talberg groaned and took a sip of water to soothe his raw throat. Damn, but he was older than he had any right to be. It felt as though his life had been extended by that which he squeezed from the thousands of slaves working in his mines every day. An amusing thought, on some level.\n\nStill, he wasn't going to live forever. The empire was on the way out already - he wouldn't last much longer than it, that was certain. He needed a worthy successor, someone hand-picked to avoid another incompetent like Larionov taking charge. Security had to be attended to, as well. Defending the sovereignty of the Imperial Corporations took precedence over attachment to a dying nation.\n\nFirst, however, he'd need to set about carefully severing the tendons that tied his grand enterprise to the gangrenous body. One at a time, with ever-so-delicate cuts of the scalpel. Only once the cost could be properly accounted for would it be safe to bring down the hammer and snap the fragile bone linking them in two."

 ### Events ###
 after_midnight.1.t: "Four Weeks Out"
 after_midnight.1.d: "It had been a month since the platoon left Irkutsk. Their orders were to pacify a Siberian province and bring the Regent's justice to all who resisted. It was a mission the soldiers were familiar with. The villages and homesteads were different each time, but the results were always the same. Fear, grovelling, pleading, a desperate struggle, gunshots, and moving on to the next settlement on the list as the survivor's screams faded away.\n\nAfter crossing off the last village, the lieutenant radioed his commander, requesting further instructions. Instead of the usual order for the platoon to return to Irkutsk for supplies and reinforcements, his superior told him there was some confusion in the high command. The platoon was to continue its current mission until the issue was resolved and it was given new orders. Before the lieutenant could ask a question the commander cut him off, ordering him to wait to be contacted. There was a squeal of static and the radio went silent.\n\nThe lieutenant looked down at the list. Every location on it had been pacified. There was no work left to do. He felt the eyes of his men upon him, asking a question only he could answer. He looked up, searching for a solution. His eyes fell on a dirt road leading into the forest. Thirty minutes later the platoon was marching down the road, knowing not where they were headed, only that their mission was not over.\n\nThe soldiers marched until they couldn't any longer, then they would rest for a few hours and continue. Whenever they came to a settlement they would carry out their orders. There was no established rule, but they always took about half of the population. Sometimes that meant one. Sometimes it meant twenty. One red day it had meant a hundred and fifty. Some soldiers deserted, but most were too afraid. As long as they followed orders they could cling to their wretched lives a little longer. So they marched, and they killed."
 after_midnight.1.a: "And when no one looked, they cried."
 
 after_midnight.2.t: "The End of Eden"
 after_midnight.2.d: "The forest outside of Tara had served as a sanctuary for the locals for centuries. Its towering trees gave it the feeling of a land removed from time. The village children would play in the stream while their grandfathers fished in the small pond it fed into. Birds flew from tree to tree. Rabbits and deer, foxes and badgers, creatures of all types made their home in the woods, creating a feeling of untamed wilderness that enchanted everyone who experienced it. No one owned the forest, and no one tried to. Even the local hunters looked elsewhere for prey. Through the rise of the empire, the chaos of the revolution and the civil war, the collapse of the Union and the brutal reunification, the forest had sheltered all who sought refuge under its canopy.\n\nIt only took five hours for it to end.\n\nThe colonel was in a difficult spot. His artillery battalion had received several crates of mustard gas shells he hadn't requested. When he tried to send them back the logistics officer reported that he had been ordered to distribute the shells and could not take them. The colonel would have to get rid of them somehow. Throwing them away wasn't an option. Wasting equipment was a serious offense, and he'd known men who'd been executed for far less. That left one option.\n\nThere were no partisans in the forest, but that didn't matter. All the colonel cared about was the possibility that partisans might decide to hide in the forest in the future. The guns fired, the shells fell, and a putrid yellow cloud began to envelop the ancient trees. The next morning the rising sun revealed an apocalypse in miniature. Dead trees and poisoned soil, a pond filled with lifeless fish floating on the surface. Scattered corpses, animal and human, twisting in their final agonizing moments. The people of Tara quickly learned to avoid the woods. The toxic corpse of the forest lingered long after the men who killed it had moved on."
 after_midnight.2.a: "Humanity has not earned paradise."

 after_midnight.3.t: "Daybreak"
 after_midnight.3.d: "There had been no word from the Regent for over a week. He had retreated into his quarters, muttering at people who weren't there while his staff watched him. The click of the door locking from the other side echoed through the halls. The butler had placed trays of food and water at the doorstep three times a day, usually with a stack of documents the Regent's advisors wished to show him. For the first few days the platters had been gone each time the butler returned, though the documents went untouched. On the fourth morning he had returned to see last night's dinner was uneaten, a bluish mold already consuming the food. The butler was about to knock when he heard an incomprehensible whispering coming from the other side. He placed the breakfast tray at the doorstep, picked up the uneaten meal, and practically sprinted back to the kitchen.\n\nIt was several nights after that when the cry came from the Regent's room. The sorrowful wail shook through the entire building, waking everyone from their sleep. Some contemplated going to investigate, but none could summon the courage. Outside the locked door, the two soldiers guarding the Regent came to an unspoken understanding: the door would remain closed. They refused to contemplate what had occurred, for if the Regent had died that meant that the charade was over, and if he lived they would be punished for intruding on him. The only option was to do as they had been told, and guard the door.\n\nWhen the morning came the Regent's generals and advisors assembled at his residence. They gathered in the ornate hall outside the door, trying to formulate a plan. A few of the Regent's closest confidants approached the door, knocking as forcefully as they dared or shouting to try to evoke a response. Nothing worked. The door remained an impenetrable barrier from beyond which no sign of life came. The butler offered a key to the assembled men, proposing that they unlock the door to see if the Regent was unwell. The men glanced at each other. None of them stepped forward to take it."
 after_midnight.3.a: "An unpleasant odor had begun to emanate from the room."

 after_midnight.4.t: "The Last Shift"
 after_midnight.4.d: "Stanislav's post on the line was near a window. That's how he knew it had been three days since he'd entered the factory. He'd watched the sun set twice, and now the light was beginning to fade again. Yesterday he'd considered jumping out the window, but he knew it was too high. Now he would've jumped anyway if he could muster the strength to smash the glass, but he couldn't. All he had the strength to do was repeat the same robotic motion of feeding bullets into ammunition clips. It took all his concentration to stay conscious and continue to work. The exhaustion, the hunger, and worst of all the thirst were eating away at his mind and body, but resting would only bring death quicker. Poor Boris found that out the hard way. He'd fallen asleep at his post for a few minutes when one of the guards spotted him. He didn't even shake Boris awake before shooting him through the temple and storming off. That was yesterday morning. Boris's corpse still lay on the floor next to Stanislav, slowly putrefying, a reminder of the consequences for slothfulness.\n\nWith the little sanity Stanislav retained, he still wondered why this was happening. The day it began had been no different from any other. After fourteen hours of exhausting work he'd seen one of the guards answer a phone. He hadn't heard any of the conversation, but the guard appeared frightened. No announcement was ever made, but when time came for the shift to end the whistle to dismiss them hadn't sounded. They continued to work, and the guards continued to watch them. It was two hours before someone got up to ask when the shift would end. A guard killed her for leaving her post, and made it clear anyone who stopped working could expect the same.\n\nStanislav had accepted then he was never going to see his son again. He was going to die in this cramped, noisy building in the next few days. Either he would fall asleep and be disposed of like Boris, or his thirst would get the better of him and his organs would shut down. Some primal instinct told him that moment was not long off now. He only wished someone would tell him why this happened. All he wanted now was a reason."

 after_midnight.6.d: "The car rumbled to a stop and the tax collector stepped out. Things were already not looking good. There were no signs of life in the village of Khezembeck, at least as far as he could tell. No smoke rose from the chimneys and no lights burned in the windows. The only sound was a dog barking somewhere further into town.\n\nThe tax collector let out an exasperated sigh and started waddling into the village proper. He knocked on every door, waiting a few moments for a response before trying the knob. Most of the doors were locked, but before long he found one that gave way. He stepped into the darkened house, barely able to see his hand in front of his face. He pulled a match from his pocket and struck it.\n\nThe flickering light illuminated a modest but well kept living room. An old picture of a man and a woman sat on the mantle and a child's doll lay forgotten on the couch. The tax collector wiped a thin layer of dust from the mantle and muttered. No one had been here for a few days at least.\n\nHouse by house he checked the village, finding no signs of any life larger than a rat. He scribbled notes in his ledger, crossing entire families off the record. On his tour he noticed a large number of tracks exiting the village, heading west towards Moskowien, just like the last two villages he had visited. He would make sure to note this in his report to his superiors.\n\nAfter several hours of fruitless searching, the tax collector got back in his car. This was not good at all. Three villages in a row, and not a single resident to be seen, or a penny of taxes to show for his efforts. His superiors would certainly not be pleased. Luckily, they had not been responding to his messages recently. With any luck they were busy with some larger issue that would keep them distracted for a while. As he drove away, the tax collector wondered if the people of Tilgorsk had also fled west without warning."

 after_midnight.7.t: "In Retrospect"
 after_midnight.7.d: "Preview from The New Time of Troubles: Russia in the 20th Century, by Richard Pipes:\n\n"The Pustyye Zemli, better known as the empty lands in the west, did not emerge overnight as it might seem. Taboritsky's regime began a policy of systemic chemical weapons use on a localized scale before the reunification of Western Russia was complete. Though comprehensive records from the era are obviously rare, it is estimated that by 1966 over ten million cubic meters of various chemical agents had been unleashed on the Russian landscape, mustard gas and chlorine gas being the most common, along with copious amounts of incendiary chemicals and defoliants. With this staggering level of use, it is almost a certainty that small areas of Russia had already been rendered uninhabitable to all higher forms of life before the Regent's forces had crossed the Urals.\n\nThough the foundations for the empty lands were laid during the reunification wars, they did not truely start to materialize until Russia was fully unified under the so-called Holy Russian Empire. Taboritsky's reign of terror and ethnic cleansing campaigns were fiercely opposed by dozens of partisan groups, some of which continue to operate even now. To combat these rebels, the Holy Russian Empire embarked on a suicidal campaign of mass gas deployment and environmental destruction within its own borders, seeking to deny the underground organizations anywhere to hide in Russia's vast landscape.\n\nThe empty lands are the inevitable result of this policy. In Russia's current state conducting on-the-ground research is an impossibility, but aerial surveillance has recorded over ten thousand examples of newly lifeless regions since 1969. The vast majority of these are less than ten square kilometers, but the largest examples can cover thousands, representing entire dead ecosystems. Early studies estimate that 0.4 percent of Russia's land area is now uninhabitable for at least the next two to three decades, and over 10 percent has been contaminated to varying degrees.""

 after_midnight.8.t: "Prodigal"
 after_midnight.8.d: "The village seemed all too familiar to Ivan. He tried to focus on his assignment, but he could not shake the feeling that he had been here before. The layout of the streets reminded him of his childhood, of running between the houses with his sister, playing soldiers and fighting imaginary Nazis. Thinking back to those games made him wonder if he had been destined to do this. To make his living killing the unworthy for officers in far off cities.\n\nTo his left a bright green house was burning, smoke billowing out of the windows, the former owners dead on the lawn. The green paint conjured long forgotten half-memories from Ivan. Blurred images of a friendly face, of warm summer days and a time before all of this filled his mind. Try as he might he could not place them. The face remained blank, a vague amalgam of forgotten people he had left behind.\n\nIvan approached the corpses on the lawn. He heard a dull ringing in the back of his head, the kind he heard when a bomb went off too close. All around him rifles were firing, buildings were collapsing, children were screaming, but all of it was fading away. The ringing grew louder as he approached the bodies. There were three, an old couple and a younger woman, perhaps in her 30s. All of them lay face down in the grass, a perfect round hole of gore in the back of each of their skulls, their blood soaking into the dirt.\n\nIvan reached the old woman and flipped her over. One of his squad mates down the street shouted his name but Ivan didn't hear him. The ringing was deafening now, drowning out every other sound in a relentless hum. The edges of Ivan's vision were becoming blurry, the colors bleeding into each other, choking his sight to what was directly in front of him. He looked down at the old woman, and behind the decades that separated them and the mask of fear she still wore in death, he finally saw a face he recognized.\n\nIvan let her fall back to the ground and walked over to the rest of his squad. A few of the men asked what he'd been doing, but he offered no answer. Shrugging, they all went back to work. By nightfall Atlyvorsk was gone, with no survivors to tell what happened to their home save one."

 ## KINGDOM OF ALTAY EVENTS ##
 
 after_midnight.11.t: "For the Fallen"
 after_midnight.11.d: "Three coffins lay before the kneeling form of Boris Krylov. They were empty, of course - nobody knew what exactly had happened to his family, but they were almost certainly dead. Tears streamed down his face as he prayed for their salvation to a God who had long since abandoned Russia. He thought of his father, crazy yet brilliant in so many ways. He thought of his brother, who had so loved the people. He thought of his sister, the strongest woman he had ever known.\n\nNow, there was only him.\n\nWhen the empire finally collapsed, Boris had been the only man in the region with any sort of clout. The people looked to him now to guide them through the trials that lay ahead. Of course he had agreed, but he now found himself sick to his stomach at the trepidation of it all. He had always been the quiet one of the family, content to stick to administration and bureaucracy. He was not a leader. He could hardly compare to father or to his siblings. But if he could not lead the people, who could? The people of Altay were broken and lost, and he was all they had left.\n\nHe fought the temptation to confine himself to his tent and drink away his sorrows. He knew he would not be the best leader, but for the sake of all his subjects, and for the sake of his family's legacy, he would give it his all. He stood and reached for his father's coffin, upon which sat the crown that had once adorned his head. With trembling hands, Boris Krylov adorned it upon his own head.\n\nHe caught his reflection in a nearby window. He thought he looked ridiculous. Yet he stowed his doubts and his fears, and with a heavy heart he strode from the church to greet his subjects. He resolved to do what he could to lead them, for what else could be done?"
 after_midnight.11.a: "For father. For the family. For everyone."
 
 after_midnight.12.t: "An Impasse"
 after_midnight.12.d: ""I'm sorry, but we just can't spare the soldiers, we're already overstretched keeping the bandits out," said Major Ivanov, his tired features scrunching up in frustration as he stared across the council table at one of the many peasant representatives.\n\n"You can't expect us to just sit around waiting for our houses to get burned down by some bloodthirsty thugs, you have to help us with the enemy within!" Came the hoarse reply from the representative. King Boris was already getting a headache, but despite the dull pain overwhelming the back of his skull he continued to strain to follow the conversation. It was anarchy, with officials yanked from all walks of life competing for their own needs to be met in a land that was drowning in loss and brimming with need. The clergy, the soldiers, the farmers, the workers, all wanted things they could not have. So much was being said, pleaded for, promised with crossed fingers...\n\n"As the Lord says..." "Bastards!" "...15 troops..." "...has to be..." "This week alone..." "...crematoriums." The words rushed past Boris as he tried to push through the fog overwhelming his mind, struggling to understand where the conversation had even wandered off to. Sweat beaded on his forehead as the words continued to blend together, until his head was simply filled with rushing white noise. Now they were all looking at him, waiting for an answer to a question he hadn't heard. What was he supposed to tell them? He was just a general! This was the least he could for his people, try to lead them, and yet he could still do so little.\n\nBoris sat up, straightening a crown he never wanted, weathered by the years. The council's eyes beat down on him like hail. Someone tried to break the silence, hoping for an answer from the beleaguered king, "Your Majesty?""
 after_midnight.12.a: ""I... uh. Can you repeat that?""
 
 after_midnight.13.t: "Weary Beyond Words"
 after_midnight.13.d: "Boris gazed down the hill towards the stream, bubbling as it made its way gently across the clear, green pasture. His druzhina were relaxing by the stream, chattering amongst themselves, the noise competing with the gurgle of the water. Boris, a few dozen feet above and behind them and perched on the hillside, gripped a handful of soil where his hand rested for support. Exhaustion tugged at his limbs and wore away at his mind almost always, but right now he was able to find respite beneath an open sky.\n\nCalm moments were rare nowadays, and Boris tried to enjoy it as much as he could. However, despite the softness of the grass, the noise of the stream, the majesty of the mountains beyond, and the pleasant breeze brushing cheerfully past his face, he still couldn't rid his mind of worry.\n\nThe pastures beneath the foothills of the Altay Mountains were beautiful this time of year, as were the mountains themselves. The craggy giants, dusted with snow, were painted a dreamy purple by distance, sky and shadow. It startled Boris to know that, at least in the words of humanity, a people so often wrong and arbitrary in their claims, these great beasts of stone belonged to him. They were a testament to the responsibility he now held and could not in good conscience release. They had seen so many rulers over the years, including his own father. The old man had seemed so... invincible, in his leadership of his territory. Right up until the end, he ruled with dignity, grace, and power. He was a man truly worthy of subjugating mountains. Boris did not feel that way at all. So he sat, stared at the clear blue sky, and asked himself:"
 after_midnight.13.a: ""What would father do?""
 
 after_midnight.14.t: "Brothers in Victimhood"
 after_midnight.14.d: "Boris was puzzled when he received word of the delegation from the east. Very few travelled so far these days, and the men who had arrived were apparently from a group of Mongol pastoralists. What they could want so far from their home, especially after their people were so horrifically slaughtered by Taboritsky's forces, was a mystery.\n\nRegardless, they were technically his subjects, so Boris agreed to hold an audience with them. The delegation were a sorry bunch. Their clothes were ragged, many looked half starved, and a few lacked limbs, eyes, and other body parts. Yet the leader, an elderly Mongol who walked with a limp, smiled warmly as he approached.\n\n"Greetings, Your Majesty," he said in broken Russian. "We have come bearing aid for your people. We have brought food for the hungry, and yurts for those without homes." He gestured behind him at their wagons, loaded up with cheeses, dried meats, and bundles of fabric.\n\nBoris stared agape at the supplies, and then back at the man. "You would bestow this on us? Even after everything that has happened to you? Surely your people need these supplies?"\n\nThe old Mongol shook his head. "Our people suffer, yes, but so do yours and all the people of this land. We are all brothers in victimhood now, and it is just that we do what we can to help each other. My only regret is that we could not bring you more."\n\nBoris found that words suddenly escaped him. In truth, the supplies were not much - they would feed and house a few dozen people at most. Yet these people who had so little themselves, who had every reason to hate Russians for all that had happened, had come offering what they could to help him and his subjects. Fighting back tears, he could only utter a breathless few words of gratitude."
 after_midnight.14.a: ""...Thank you.""
 
 after_midnight.15.t: "Once More, With Feeling"
 after_midnight.15.d: "Boris smiled strugglingly through the coughs as he watched the fading glow of the cigarette butt sail through the gloomy dusk fog and suddenly snuff out as it hit the river a few meters below him. For a moment he wondered if the faded German magazines the camp had used as toilet paper the previous year had spoken true, and the smoking caused the cough. He cast the thought aside. There were a thousand dreadful or ordinary things that could cause a cough in the misty ruins of Russia, what mattered was smoking helped.\n\nHe opened the pack for another. Blyat. Chucking the empty pack away, he marched back to his tent. No use asking the quartermaster, Boris had already squirreled away whatever leftovers of real tobacco could be found. After fruitlessly searching for several minutes, he could do little but sit down on his bed in frustration and take swigs from an old bottle of vodka to staunch his coughs. He couldn't even find his damned crown, much less some smokes. He wanted to cry, but knew he couldn't; the men outside, while rough men dressed in little more than filthy rags and old ushankas, all looked to him as a leader. But the last Knyaz of the Rus was as lost as his men. His siblings had always known what to do, what to say, but Boris was lost, only moving forward out of a vague sense of duty to his lost family and a desire to help... the starving villagers of Russia? His men? Himself? He hardly knew any longer.\n\nThe memory of his father stirred something in Boris, and he looked at the pile of books and papers he had thrown on the floor looking for smokes. At the top lay a faded copy of his father's 'Sayings of St. Symeon'. One of the books Rurik had read when lost in despair. Maybe it had all been a trick, but... he picked up the book, and his cough became a faint memory as he scanned the pages with widening eyes. Patterns, order, faith... hope? He scooped up the rest of the books and returned to his bed. Trick or no trick, maybe there was something greater at play."

 ## CENTRAL EURASIAN REPUBLIC EVENTS ##
 
 after_midnight.16.t: "Firm Footing"
 after_midnight.16.d: "Baganov and the soldiers he had brought with him set to the momentous task before them. After seizing an imperial arsenal, they'd brought dynamite to the governor's palace, not bothering to clean the corpses of the soldiers who had died defending this... nightmare. Baganov surveyed the dynamite as it was placed, making sure to step over the pile of gore that had once been the governor. Ripped limb from limb, he remembered the screams. The bastard deserved worse, he thought. They all did. In a lapse of anger he kicked the mangled head of the governor across the hallway. He calmed down immediately, looking around at soldiers wondering what had happened, swiftly returning to their work. He'd have to be calm, but how could he be calm? Here, in this swastika-adorned Hell, a double-headed eagle glaring down on him?\n\nAs he was satisfied with the explosive placement, he shouted for the soldiers to leave. Once they had, they were met by a crowd of shivering, starving survivors, waiting to see what was left of the palace - those parts they hadn't looted - blown to kingdom come. "Do it," Baganov ordered as a soldier pushed the plunger. An explosion rocked the palace, bringing part of it crashing down as pieces of marble and wood flew into the sky, but the main structure remained intact. He sighed, watching the dust settle on the husk of the palace. That damned palace. Its blind eagles staring into a nightmare.\n\nPickaxes, axes, and torches were distributed to the crowd once more descending on the palace. The palace still stood and it must be torn down. The legacy of that madman, that arch-traitor, that Antichrist, had to be destroyed. He and so many others swung, cut, and burned, trying to demolish the gilded symbol of Russia's end, tearing it down brick by sordid, swastika-emblazoned brick. "Fall, damn you, fall!" Baganov muttered as he tore a stairwell to pieces. "What will it take to destroy you?""

It was cold even here in the former army district headquarters that passed for his presidential office, which was one of the few buildings that had an independent power supply. With the breakdown of the power grid, only those buildings with generators could still provide heating. He didn't know how many had already frozen to death, how many would in the coming months.\n\nHis mind snapped back into focus as he faced the three Narodniks. "Mr. President, are you alright?" one asked.\n\n"Hmm? Yes, I was just thinking of something. Please continue, Mr. Ivanov."\n\n"The peasantry requires additional aid. With the destruction of Novosibirsk's factories in the past decades, we Narodniks represent the common people of the republic. You can go on about creating a Eurasian utopia all you want, but unless you can help the people you claim to support, your words mean nothing."\n\nBaganov grimaced. "I assure you, sir, we are providing what we can. Supplies are low enough as it is, and we need everything we can to-"\n\n"Aren't you supposed to be helping the people?" the ruddy-faced woman interrupted. "Isn't that the point of your Interim Government? Mr. President, if you cannot promise us food and land, then give us democracy."\n\nBaganov stood up. "I am doing everything I can. Do you know how many corpses I've seen? How many burned villages and desolated farms? The poisoned rivers? That's what being President means. And so long as our people are starving, so long as Taboritsky's remnants haunt the forests, none of us will be safe from death. That's the harsh truth. You want to help the people? Then help me save them. We can have democracy in time. But for now?""

 after_midnight.18.d: "Major Yevgeniy Ustryalov and his subordinate, Captain Kira Emekova, stopped their horse-drawn cart outside Barnaul, or at least the shanty town that had been built where Barnaul once stood. The Imperial Army had used the original town for artillery practice, leaving only ruins for the survivors. Most fled or died, but gradually a settlement formed. The old Red Army combat engineer remembered his orders from Novosibirsk: to try fixing the agricultural situation here.\n\n"So, Captain Emekova," he asked as he dismounted the cart and fetched his supplies, "How are you enjoying your first day as an army engineer?"\n\n"Funnily enough, not as grim as my civilian career," the younger woman replied. "The company's better, you bathe more than those partisans."\n\nHe chuckled, and the two made their way to the gates of Barnaul, greeted by a party of farmers. The two made their way inside as their soldier escorts began distributing the rations they had brought as best they could. Yevgeniy began examining the irrigation structures the farmers had built as Kira examined the soil. Could be constructed better, he supposed, but it wasn't the main issue. He began taking notes as Kira approached. "The water's contaminated, but not by much. Still, it's enough to make most agriculture here difficult."\n\nYevgeniy checked the map he'd brought and pointed west. "The old warlord that used to be based here began working on a water treatment plant about three kilometers that way. Never completed, but we can salvage something, improvise a purifier for the farms here. Better than nothing." He slapped Kira's back as the two mounted their cart and began their salvage."

 after_midnight.19.d: "Yekaterina took a break from her grim task in the streets of her old hometown, Novosibirsk. The Siberian winter and collapse of agricultural supply had taken its toll on the city, and President Baganov had ordered the army to begin cleaning up the bodies of those who had succumbed.\n\nThe homeless population was found slumped, frozen, in alleys and in ruined shops. She'd then had to go into homes to find those who'd frozen to death in their own beds, or taken a more merciful way out first. God help her if the dogs had gotten there first...\n\nAs she drank from her battered flask of vodka, she looked up at the ruined building in front of her. Above the doorway she made out the outline of three gears, a familiar symbol, but one she could not place. She stood up and found a placard covered in the snow. She picked it up, dusting off the snow, and made out a faded word on the battered placard: "Progress."\n\nShe remembered it all at once; the Titan Corporation. The brains of the federation, the nerve center of the Falcon's attempt to forge his new Russia. She scoffed. In a past life, she had been a Narodnik, one of those who kept the promise of a Russia that worked for all the people alive. Titan, Sibir, Feniks, all their supporters, what did they know of "progress?" What had their progress done for the people?\n\nBut in spite of everything, she felt... sorrow? Did she miss them? Yes, she concluded. They were bastards to a man, but they believed in progress, in a strong Russia, in a land where at the very least slaves wouldn't be forced into backbreaking shifts for the glory of a dead princeling, or where she wouldn't have to throw frozen corpses onto pyres because they couldn't dig enough graves. She sighed and took another swig. Titan's progress had lost, to the madness of what used to be Russia. She threw the placard to the side as she returned to work."

"Sounds like a dream. Now shut up and help me, there's got to be a good plane here somewhere."\n\nThe airplane graveyard outside Novosibirsk stretched around them. Most of them were old fighter planes from the war their parents had fought against the Germans, and were at best incapable of flying beyond either Lake Baikal or the Urals. They searched through plane after plane, careful to try and avoid those with the imperial eagle and swastika upon them. They had seen those fly over the skies countless times, bearing gas bombs to some unfortunate village. Even if they were sure they wouldn't trigger the chemical weapons inside, those planes were only capable of slightly longer flights than the fighters. They were made for terror, not travel.\n\nBut almost a full day of searching, salvaging, praying, revealed the horrible truth; those cursed engines of death were the best they had. Vasily looked at a map as he sat against the wing of a Yak-9.\n\n"Once we fix this rusty can, we'll fly to Irkutsk for resupply, then to Chumikan. After that we either ditch the plane and head to Sakhalin by boat, or ditch the plane in Petropavlovsk and then leave for Alaska."\n\n"Vasily, I'm not sure we-"\n\n"I don't fucking care, Dmitri!

 ## NEW TOMSK EVENTS ## 
 
 after_midnight.21.t: "Dust and Echoes"
 after_midnight.21.d: "Alexander Zinoviev stands among the piles of pulverized concrete and marble leading up to the former Duma building in Tomsk. Shattered pieces of column and tattered posters alike litter the space that once housed the most honorable democracy in all of Russia. The former republic, the bearer of ancient virtue, was set ablaze by Taboritsky's madmen. Now the abominable two-headed eagle had fallen into desolation itself, and Zinoviev had nowhere else to turn to.\n\nZinoviev picked up a fraction of displaced marble and examined the Russian engravings, the whispers of democracy from before the wasteland. If any scholar could get a bird's-eye view of the ruin, he surely would have thought it belonged to a plaza from ancient Greece, not some pulverized remains of a recent Russian government. Zinoviev remembered how the Republic of Tomsk took its virtues from the ancient Greeks: sociability, conscience, benevolence, industriousness, to name a few. By comparison, Taboritsky's regime was only vice.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that Zinoviev was standing right here, side-by-side with Likhachyov, Shostakovitch, Kharms, and Sakharov in the glorious Duma, campaigning for the future of Russian progress. Now, he was the last one standing; the dying fate of Tomsk now rests in his hands alone. Taboritsky's men tried to douse the flame of Russia's last hope and nearly succeeded in purging the "degenerate liberalism" for good.\n\nThe last flicker in the torch sways side-to-side, unprotected from the raging wind. Tomsk has today to count and recover the dead lying in the wake of Taboritsky, but tomorrow, the city must rebuild. Democracy hangs by a struggling thread of hope in the middle of Siberia, but Zinoviev knows what he must do."

 after_midnight.22.t: "Green and Blue"
 after_midnight.22.d: "A ragged, dirty group of scavengers walks the wasteland of what once was Tomsk, looking for any sign of previous life neglected by Taboritsky's men. Nothing persists more than the smell of moss and dew, with a faint hint of smoke as the scavengers travel deeper into the rough Siberian forest. Discarded wood, piles of ash, and crumbled marble litter the landscape; of course, not one could forget the two or three charred bodies every 200 yards.\n\nDeep into the forest, a polished, rectangular wooden box rests among the teal grass and the black dirt. A closer look reveals inhuman claw marks along the top half of the box; whoever found this box before had pried it open violently. The leader of the group slowly and easily lifts the opening of the box, revealing the looted corpse of Boris Pasternak, the founder of the republic. All of his valuables were taken from him, but his body remains in one piece, much to the group's surprise. The scavengers pick up the coffin at once and return home.\n\nThe remnants of the Duma are delighted to see Pasternak's body recovered and in good condition. The older members recall how Pasternak fought tooth and nail to maintain his sacred democracy against all opposition. Younger members recall stories of Pasternak's fervent determination to see Tomsk thrive as he worked until his last breath. The Decembrists take pride in knowing that Pasternak was one of their own, and they vigorously insist that Pasternak be given a proper reburial.\n\nThe shining white sun begins to set, illuminating the bright green grass. The Decembrists gather on a large hill overlooking the River Ob, each one holding onto Pasternak's polished coffin. Dark green trees reflect against the sparkling river as the sun grows dimmer. The Decembrists bow their heads in one final moment of silence dedicated to the great founder, he who worked tirelessly to preserve the Russian dream. The body is laid to rest. The curtain of night and stars descends slowly, respectfully."

Those few who remain of the Humanist faction have made it their duty to identify every soul silenced by the reign of the Mad Regent, and to give them what little dignity could be afforded to them. It is far easier said than done - most bodies are already in advanced stages of decay, many have been damaged beyond recognition, and often there isn't even a next of kin left alive to make a final confirmation. Yet the tired, broken men and women who had once dreamed of a better world toil on.\n\nWhat few bodies that can be clearly identified are turned over to their families, if any still live. In many cases, the workers only have anecdotes and what few records had escaped the fires of the Regency to make an educated guess. It isn't unheard of for two separate bodies to be attributed to the same person. The Humanists give it their all, but in the end there are still so many bodies unaccounted for.\n\nWhen the task is done, they begin to dig. A section on the edge of the ruins of Tomsk is turned into a mass grave for all those who could not be identified. Upon the site, the Humanists erect a monument to the unknown soldiers and innocents, crafted from the rubble and detritus of the broken city. It bears a message of mourning, and a hope that such a tragedy might never be unleashed again. As the men and women stand solemnly around their last great work, a bitter finality sets upon them. For they know that this grave does not merely represent their lost ones, but something far, far greater:"

 after_midnight.24.d: "The Modernists weep when they first return to the Academy of Sciences. The crumbling ruin of what had once been a house of learning is structurally unsound, having been so thoroughly torched by the Shturmoviki in their rampage through the city. Almost all of the old records had been destroyed, and only a small portion of its equipment still functioned. One of the old technicians sits cradling the remains of his facility's pet cat for several hours. Eventually, the men and women of science realize that the time for mourning will not last forever, and soon they will need to salvage what they can of their old lives.\n\nWith the husk of the Academy as their base of operations, the most skilled surviving engineers of the Modernists set out to bring back some semblance of order to the land. The old politics of the city are now irrelevant and the other factions are busy with their own priorities, so the Modernists mostly go where they please. Soon, some limited amenities at the Academy and in the surrounding area are restored, but without reliable power and water supply there is little more they can do.\n\nSo, their attention turns towards the power plant. The nucleus of the old city, it had been bombed harshly during the Regent's march. The materials needed to repair it are scarce, but the power it could provide is too crucial to pass up. Slowly, the engineers got to work. Without proper equipment the work is gruelling, even deadly in some places - several die to electrocution, falling debris, and other accidents - but still they toil.\n\nFinally, with some trepidation, the Modernists activate the main generator, and cheer as it sputters into life. They know that many tasks still lay ahead; restoring the infrastructure needed to supply the power to the city will be a herculean task in itself. For now, however, they are content with the small victories. Amidst the desolation of the new Russia, they have found the light."

Once they would have strived to build an army and an industry to rival the world's great powers. Now, they can only hope that their people have enough food to stave off starvation.\n\nThey are now the leaders of the Republic of New Tomsk, merely by virtue of having the most members to survive the Regent's madness. While the other factions trifle over the ruins of their old dreams, the Bastilliards turn to the wellbeing of the people. Under the leadership of Zinoviev, they establish kitchens and makeshift clinics amidst the ruins of the old city, even going so far as to reach out into the surrounding villages and towns. They do what they can to tend to the basic needs of the people, with what little food and medicine remains.\n\nThe kitchens are a microcosm of the new Russia. Broken men, dead-eyed women, starving children, all come to be fed and treated as best as the Bastilliards can manage. They become a small beacon of normality, where the people come to gather, to nurse their damaged psyches and find comfort in their shared trauma. The damage caused by the reign of terror lingers in the mind as well as in the physical world, but under the care of Zinoviev's men the people can find some semblance of healing.\n\nIn the old Tomsk, the Bastilliards were often regarded as the coldest of the factions, caring more about the strength and sanctity of Russia than the people who lived within it. Now, only after Russia had been so thoroughly shattered beyond repair, the people can see clearly that they truly did care. A people's strength comes from many places, and in times such as these the Bastilliards sought only to secure the strength for the people to survive."

 after_midnight.26.d: "The poor boys of the imperial garrison were naught but skin and bones and sin, shrunken into their shadows, but a mirage of someone long gone, children born into Russia, not Hell. They were killed brutally, torn to shreds, their blood painting the walls.\n\nThe masses rose as one. A mass movement's character is that of the average of its people, shared sentiments coalescing into one single fist. It is usually a fist of hope, a great leap towards something better, and that yet remained, for anarchism is but a deeply human sentiment, being that of freedom, and humans were they yet.\n\nBut in the wake of the Regent, who embroiled Russia in the Nightmare, humanity began to resemble the Nightmare. The average had changed, a dark drop of corruption had fell in the pool of human sentiment, and that mass fist became one, perhaps not if of malice, of pain.\n\nWeapons sprung from the floorboards, having been waiting for the Day of Freedom. Bullets sprang through the streets, and the imperials were gunned down, then gunned down more, and, for good measure, filled with more rounds. Were it not for that the fact that they had already been twisted down to the soul, the bodies would have been unrecognizable.\n\nThe trees rang with cries and screams, but not many cheers. Murder, mayhem, and blood, as anarchism and anarchy merged. A black flag was raised, a massive one made of the cloaks of fallen soldiers, stained in blood, shadowing the garrison. Below it, was the head of the governor, or what was left of it."

There were still public executions, though, instead of lining the roads like the ones of old, they were in a slightly more avoidable place, the public square. A mixture of bastards to the bone and innocents swung from ropes.\n\nYevgeniya Taratuta was smoking. She used to not smoke, but the prohibitions under the empire made her miss the little ways one could kill themself. She looked through the smoke, at a local man responsible for a great deal of the executions, those of collaborators, and those of falsely accused collaborators.\n\n"You know why I have to wear an eyepatch, Taratuta?" he said, his stone facial expressions barely moving.\n\n"I'm sure it has to do with the Regent."\n\nHe chuckled. "That question was less rhetorical than you thought. I don't remember. Working in the factory, after the Regent died, the pains grew to my entire body. There was no specific pain, but my being ached, my soul ached, and I probably lost my eye somewhere, but it was too irrelevant to care."\n\n"My condolences."\n\nHe pointed to a man long gone purple on the short noose. "He was a factory commissar. He's responsible for stories like mine. These bastards have to die. So don't you fucking tell us about worrying about innocents. If any of these goddamn scum live, there won't be innocents left."\n\nTaratuta sighed. There wasn't a point, or a way, to stop this. "Justice will always win," she said, "and justice is the people.

There was a time when he dreaded looking at a full field, knowing that most of it would go to the garrison, the Mad Regent. But now he looked and knew he was free, and knew his family was free. He saw heads poking between tall wheat stalks, some dancing, some just working. It belonged to them all, he had learned. The owner was a general, who was now a head on a stick, and the documents were burnt along with most other remnants of government. Now the earth belonged to men, not the dead, and not the cruel.\n\nA woman was speaking on a tall podium, grasping a book to her chest, taking breaks between words to draw from a long cigar. "Workers!" she said, in a loud yet mellow voice taught restraint by the dark times. "The state has been killed! The Regent has been killed! All that is left is humanity, and human spirits!"\n\nVasily smiled. Damn right! He can farm in peace, as he wanted.\n\n"Now I ask you, the workers, to join us in the first conference! We shall decide for ourselves the direction of us, of Russia!"\n\nNow that, Vasily was less enthused about. Meetings were government, and government was a bullet. He'd stay home - the crops need farming. He was not alone in this; when the first Siberian Soviet conference opened, Taratuta had found attendance quite lacking."

Who are you-"\n\nThe horseman made a flourishing display turning his horse to the side, and tilting his cap. "People! I am here to deliver a denouncement, from a better man to an inferior woman!" Heads turned, and mumbles grew. "Androniy Mishurenko is the leader of the workers! He is the savior of the workers! He is the true liberator of the peasants and workers!"\n\n"Do not listen to the statist! Do not listen to the fascist! He brings us closer to the days of the Regent!" Taratuta said - luckily upon not entirely deaf ears, but they were not fully open either.\n\n"The day will come of peace! Peace will come," he says, "when the protectors of the people are here! When they are in their rightful place! When the Black Army is here! Wait for joy, people!"\n\nTaratuta was about to shout another response, but the horseman was off, after throwing the letter at her.

They are but bandits! Their black flag is closer to the bandits of Orsk than the flag of the people!" Vasily was confused. The Black Army sounded good from what he had heard, and he didn't even know where Orsk was. His sack was full, so it was time to go back to the mill.\n\nWhat sounded of thunder woke Vasily from his nap. It was a shame, he thought; it'd been so long since he had been able to slack off. Being free of a boss was nice, he thought, but something horrible interrupted his thoughts. Anna, the girl he fancied, was face down, and he could hear her crying. Before he got up to go and help her, he saw the source of thunder, a horseman in black, followed by another one in the same uniform.\n\n"Finish off the whore, and take her food. Harvest is good this year, looks like." The man's voice was hoarse and bereft of compassion.\n\n"Been a long time since we been able to eat good. God bless Mishurenko, and God damn the Regent."\n\n"Ain't God and religion statist?"\n\n"Ain't we?"\n\nThey laughed, leaving the dying girl behind.

The air was silent, broken only by the sound of horses and quiet sobs as the small group of captives stood shivering and silent, awaiting their fate.\n\nThey were once part of the imperial regime. Portly bureaucrats, priests in tattered robes, soldiers with faded patches of the Holy Russian Empire, and even the wife of one of the Mad Regent's governors. People who had enabled the tyranny of a madman. Now there was no Regent to protect them. Now there was only judgement. Only justice.\n\nFrom atop his steed, Androniy Mishurenko motioned, and two of the Black Army soldiers cut the captives free. They stood there, frozen. Mishurenko met the eyes of one of the captives, a women. He smiled coldly. "Run." She remained frozen. Another gesture, and a gunshot sounded, and one of the captives fell dead. That spurred the remaining ones into action, even starved and beaten as they were, their pain was forgotten as adrenaline and terror filled them.\n\nThe soldiers mounted their steeds, chuckling in amusement and jeering at the fleeing captives, watching them scurry like rats in a desperate bid to save their lives. A mere execution for these imperials was too clean. They deserved worse. They deserved to feel a fraction of the fear they had inspired in the name of their Regent. They deserved to suffer, as Russia had. Their last moments would be ones of abject terror, of pain, of suffering as the Black Army extracted justice long overdue.\n\nThe charade had lasted long enough. Putting two fingers to his lips, he whistled, and the soldiers cheered and kicked their horses into action and their bloodlust took over. As Mishurenko led the charge, he savored the terror of the imperials, moments before they were trampled under the steeds of the reborn Black Army."

The cheering grew louder and the man was unable to stop the barrage of blows, and he collapsed to the ground, unconscious as the audience beat their drinks against the table and roared loud enough to wake the town at the sight of the champion.\n\nMore drinks of sloshing brown and frothy beer were brought out by women who'd once managed what had once been the home of the Bratsk governor, directly from the basement distillery. More brawls and fighting rings were springing up, a particularly large one between two of the few women who remained with the true Black Army.\n\nAs Mishurenko walked through the manor, he shook his head at the men knocked out on the floor or slumped against the wall. Poorly fared the man in this place who could not hold his drink or fists well. Ah well, such was the freedom the Black Army embodied. No greater was such ideals represented than in this place. Inheritance claimed through conquest, and now rightfully belonged to them.\n\nThis place which had once stood to embody the passive horror of the Mad Regent's bureaucracy now stood ransacked. The fine furniture torn up and stained, smelling of beer. The fancy rugs burned or sold. Portraits of Taboritsky placed in corners where men pissed on them to the cheers of their drunken brethren.\n\nA fitting end for this monument to imperial statism - or something like that. Perhaps this revelry he witnessed was not in the true spirit of anarchism, yet to Mishurenko's mind, only sniveling puritans like Taratuta would look upon this expression of freedom, and condemn it. After all, what was anarchism if not the freedom to eat, drink, revel, and celebrate where one wished?"

As Mishurenko finally finished his slurred, loud oration, he swung his head to the stenographer and asked him to read out loud. The stenographer began:\n\n"To the traitorous bitch-dog known as Taratuta, be prepared to understand your weakness!\n\nWe require no account other than our own eyes, for we have seen a whore rape her nation and claim it peace! We have watched as your cuckolded pawns live in squalor, as you let them wallow in shit and wallow in it yourself! Watch, Taratuta, as a million impure savages lick their lips, as they think of ways to fuck your nation. Without the watchful eye of the Black Army, there is no hope for the good people of Siberia, as they are trapped in a rancid carcass as it swarms with flies.\n\nHave you provided freedom and prosperity to your peasants? No! Those who have turned away from Androniy Mishurenko, the true liberator of the peasants and workers, are now as impoverished and sullen as the common bitch. Those within Mishurenko's vast lands weep, as they watch you fuck their daughters and mothers. How do you not stain your vast, piggish face with tears at the plight of your own nation? So long as you breathe, you are a sore on the ass of every Russian peasant. May the Black Army liberate every oppressed Russian, and may the liberated Russian piss upon your corpse!"\n\nThe room turned to Mishurenko to wait for a response..."

He had furiously tried to move to stop them, only to freeze in fear when one of them lazily aimed his weapon in his direction.\n\n"What do you think you're doing, comrade?" The Black Army soldier asked with a lazy, knowing smile that was missing several teeth. His ugly face was pinched and greasy as dirty fingers rested on the trigger. "You wouldn't be interrupting an official Black Army inspection, would you?"\n\n"You're robbing me!" Yuri shouted.\n\nThe soldier exchanged a glance with his partner before they both laughed. "No, no, comrade," the soldier said in between mocking chuckles. "Not robbing. Inspecting. And it just so happens this is the monthly taxation period," he frowned mockingly. "Or is weekly? Ah, doesn't matter, does it?" Both men found their inside joke more funny than Yuri, who could only stand there in silent fury and fear, as he knew that there was nothing he could do.\n\n"The Black Army appreciates your contribution, comrade," the soldier said mockingly, as he grabbed an unopened beer bottle on his way out. "Oh, that is a fine horse you have out front. Don't worry, we'll take good care of her." With a lazy wave, both of the Black Army bandits left the house they'd ransacked and ruined, barely keeping their amusement at their grand theft to themselves. Yuri knew that what they were stealing wasn't going anywhere but their own pockets.\n\nHe felt sick. He remembered a time when the Black Army had once protected them. Had once stood for something. Now, like everything the Regent had touched, was remained had been twisted and corrupted beyond recognition."
 after_midnight.34.a: "Once soldiers, now bandits."
 
 after_midnight.35.t: "The Great Crusade"
 after_midnight.35.d: "Under an overcast sky, the Black Army stood before him, reformed far greater than it had ever been before. Perhaps the guns were scuffed and haphazard, perhaps the uniforms were torn and dirty, perhaps their discipline was not quite as firm as it once was - but did that matter now? In this land of misery and suffering, were they not still the shining beacon of liberty in Siberia?\n\nHow could they not be? Mishurenko knew they had what was essential to liberty - freedom. True freedom, in a way the previous "Free" Territory had never possessed. The cowards and traitors under Taratuta called him a dictator, yet how could he be a dictator when he had the complete loyalty of his men? Jealousy, that was all it was, they saw the riches his men plundered, the endless stores of food and drink they enjoyed, and they stewed in anger at the sight of the true freedom his Black Army enjoyed. The Black Army, who was returning justice to the Siberian lands one dead imperial at a time - along with anyone else foolish enough to stand in their way.\n\n"Comrades!" He rode his horse up and down the lines of soldiers who stood attentively, with hunger in their eyes, and bloodlust in their hearts. "Beyond us stands oppression! Tyranny! And traitors to the Black Army!" The soldiers roared and boo'd the mention of Taratuta's rival state, as Mishurenko lifted a hand, and silence once more fell. "We have brought this land under our protection, but we will not abandon those beyond it to suffer under the hand of tyrants and traitors!"\n\nHe swung an arm outstretched to the greater Siberian lands. "We are the singular beacon of freedom in Siberia! It is time to bring liberty, peace, and justice once more to the Motherland!" The ground shook from the cheers and roars of the army before him, and Mishurenko's heart soared as he fed upon the energy displayed. "Ready your arms, my brothers!" Mishurenko declared to deafening cheers, as rifles were raised into the air. "Our crusade of liberty begins today!""

 after_midnight.36.t: "Force of Habit"
 after_midnight.36.d: "Many, many years ago, when he was still a young student, Michael Goleniewski had once prepared for a stage play where he was to play the part of a Polish-Lithuanian nobleman, an effort that had involved several hours backstage attempting to put on a gaudy, unwieldy costume. For some reason, the memory drifted unwarranted to his mind as Stanisław struggled to fit the undersized crown on his head.\n\n"For God's sake, Michael, an emperor... does not laugh like some peasant!"\n\n"Sorry, man, but you have to see - isn't there something about this that is hilarious? Pass me a cigarette at least, my legs hurt from standing for so long."\n\n"Emperors don't smoke during their coronation either, and you might light one of these bloody robes on fire - we haven't got a single other 'royal' looking thing for you to wear."\n\n"Bloody? Is that any word for a royal retainer to say?"\n\nBoth men looked at each other for a second and then began laughing uncontrollably. Stanisław looked at the cracked old antique he held in his hand and Michael glanced at the tattered edge of his 'royal robe', and they realized what exactly Russia had been reduced to. In such a situation, man has only two choices: to laugh or to cry, and crying would have seemed less kingly than a good chuckle.\n\n"All right, all right - we have to get this done with. People will be gathering outside by now, and the coronation will be only the first step. Finally, some good will be done for this wretched land."\n\nMichael calmed himself down and tried to create an expression of deep, imperial majesty on his face - and failed. Even if it wasn't a very royal gesture, at times like this there was only one true solution:"
 after_midnight.36.a: ""Give me some of that vodka at least - the wind's getting colder.""
 
 after_midnight.37.t: "None the Wiser"
 after_midnight.37.d: "The biting wind blew harshly through the crowd that had gathered in front of a small worn-down chapel to witness the coronation of Tsar Alexei II. The ceremony itself was short and muted - with no one left alive in Irkutsk who could play the organ, it was decided to forgo music entirely to maintain a sombre atmosphere. Once the new king had his crown placed on his head and finished reciting hymns and oaths long forgotten by his people, they watched with bated breath as he walked outside and, in front of a small microphone, began to speak.\n\n"People of Russia - my loyal subjects! It is with nothing more than the grace of God that I, Alexei Nikolayevitch, have returned to my place as Tsar of All Russia to fulfil my god-given duty to restore order and please to our weary nation! The wicked Regent could not stand against the infinite strength and compassion of the Almighty, and in this hour of gratitude I offer my humble thanks to the Lord Jesus Christ for offering us a chance at salvation once more. In the days to come, I will make it the first mission of my imperial government to carry out the Lord's work and restore to my loyal and ailing subjects the basic conditions that all humans need and deserve - and then to extend this to all citizens of Russia - no matter how far away or under what depraved and illegitimate master they are forced to toil."\n\nWhen the crowd had dispersed and Goleniewski had finally time to himself, he reflected on his speech. Almost all of it had been devised in the spur of the moment - including the extreme religiosity. Ironic, coming from a communist and atheist, though neither of these things seemed to matter very much. Neither of them had saved Russia from what it had become, and if appealing to the 'opium of the masses' was what it would take to bring back order to the shattered remains of the nation, then it would be done. What the people needed was not Michael Goleniewski, Polish spy, but Tsar Alexei II, a people's emperor acting with the blessings of God above."
 after_midnight.37.a: "What they do not know will not hurt them."
 
 after_midnight.38.t: "The Purgation"
 after_midnight.38.d: "One of the emperor's new programs had been restoring the radio loudspeakers in every town and village centre, and getting Irkutsk's radio broadcasting facility back and running. So when his citizens were told that a vital and important announcement would be made over the radio, a surprisingly large number of them were able to tune in. After the royal fanfare and state anthem, the tsar began:\n\n"People of Russia everywhere - my imperial subjects! Know that your true emperor, Alexei II, has been by the grace of God almighty been returned to you! Know that all those who claim to be acting in my stead are nothing more than traitors to the state - the agents of evil whose sole aim and purpose is to take from those with nothing to spare everything and more! Know that Sergey Taboritsky, the False Regent and Monster of the Motherland, is long dead and burning in the fires of hell for his infinite crimes against the Russian people - as will every bandit now claiming the cursed title of Regent for himself! In the name of God, and in my holy duty as the Tsar and Autocrat of All Russia, I vow an oath to heaven - I shall not rest until these monsters are wiped clean from our homeland, beginning with Andrey Dikiy and his gang of cutthroats and rapists! People of Russia, the hour of liberation is near at hand - and it will begin with the utter rout and destruction of this so-called Regency!"\n\nAll across the scattered remains of Taboritsky's regime in the Far East, the tsar's thunderous message resonated through the air and filled the hearts of all those who heard it with an emotion Russia had not seen in far too long: hope. All those but one, as Andrey Dikiy writhed and screamed with impotent rage as he heard the distorted but still powerful voice echo out of his radio. As visions of torture and public execution swam through his mind, those less fortunate souls in the statelet he ruled listened and prayed to God - some for the first time in their lives - hoping against hope that finally some justice would come to the frigid wastes of Siberia."
 after_midnight.38.a: "Perhaps at long last, their prayers will no longer be in vain."
 
 after_midnight.39.t: "Words Uttered in Secret"
 after_midnight.39.d: "One thing that had not run out of supply in the shattered remains of Russia was vodka, and as such there were a plethora of shady establishments in every corner of Irkutsk that offered its weary inhabitants some alcoholic solace. In the corner of one such bar, a small gathering of men in old uniforms - markings too worn to distinguish to all but a few - discussed quietly the bizarre situation they found themselves in. "I'm telling you man, I worked with him! He was with us - an NKVD unit in Poland, before the war! No, no, the first one - the Great Patriotic War. Polish - of all the things, now apparently our 'tsar' is a bloody Pole!"\n\n"He's telling the truth - I worked with him too, some unpronounceable Polish name like Goliynevsky or some such, Mikhail Goliynewskiy... I can't remember. Not very competent either, just a paper-pusher."\n\nAfter the others emptied their glasses, one man with a sunken, worn face piped up.\n\n"Bah - Pole or not, he can't be that inept. We actually have a bit of electricity, water, food - what more can you ask for? Outside here, it's much worse - you have no idea. For what he is, he's making a decent job of it at least."\n\nAs the vodka continued flowing, what had started as a whispered conspiracy devolved into an argument - as it usually did.\n\n"Well, what are you going to do, take up arms with your broken Mosin and fight for the fucking Regent? Who cares if he isn't actually the tsar - it doesn't matter. He acts like more of a leader than the bastards who came before him, and we finally have some hope for once in our cursed lives. Maybe we'll even see the motherland united again in our lifetimes.""
 after_midnight.39.a: "What matters more, a man or what he represents?"
 
 after_midnight.40.t: "Red and Gold"
 after_midnight.40.d: ""By order of His Imperial Majesty, The Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias,\nThe Imperial Government has resolved:\n1. To declare all industrial and commercial enterprises located in the Russian Empire, with all their capital and property, whatever they may consist of, the property of the Russian Empire.\n2. To declare the formal redistribution of this land to those who may best make use of it and those who already reside and derive sustenance and employment from working on it, upon the principle of peasant ownership.\n3. To formally amend to the Constitution of the Russian Empire the following provision: that each region of the empire shall be governed by the Imperial Government through the institution of the regional soviets, and that this shall remain an inalienable and unalterable foundation of the State and Constitution.\nLong Live the Emperor! S' nami Bog'!"\n\nAfter the initial brief period of bafflement, all of Irkutsk was ablaze with talk and rumour about the recently announced imperial decree, which bore a more than passing resemblance to the old Soviet decrees of decades past. While those who were genuine monarchists were initially confused, the tsar's personal popularity and public image had ensured their undying loyalty - surely, as Alexei worked with the sanction of God himself, questioning him was equivalent to both treachery and blasphemy. If these decrees resembled the old Soviet announcements, it was a coincidence and nothing more.\n\nMeanwhile, in an old dingy bar in a dark corner of the city, a group of old comrades chuckled quietly to themselves as they heard the news. It seemed their once compatriot had not forgotten where he had come from - in a bizarre way, he had found the way to the people's hearts in a way that perhaps even Bukharin had failed to understand."

 # Regency Of Holy Russia Flavour Events #
 
 after_midnight.41.t: "In Taboritsky's Footsteps"
 after_midnight.41.d: "Imperial Regent Andrey Dikiy paced through the meeting hall of the Verkhneudinsk Opera House, formerly that delusional brat Sablin's headquarters. His portraits and banners were thankfully stripped from the place and burnt, but Dikiy couldn't shake the feeling that there was still something lurking about. Like after dealing with a rat infestation, one still flinches at every sound from behind the walls or beneath the floorboards.\n\nAnd yet there was another parasitic infestation to deal with.\n\n"Men, followers of the tsar, keepers of Holy Russia!" his voice boomed through the hall, staring over the small throng of officers and bureaucrats watching him. Even at their highest attendance, they could barely fill a third of the seats. "We have been betrayed! The lying Jew Larionov didn't even wait for our Blessed Regent's body to cool before trying to seize power for himself! He seeks to keep the Tsarevich hidden, no doubt so the Polack to our west can join forces with him! These deceitful parasites have wormed their way into our administration, trying to undermine those who still believe in the truth and await blessed Alexei's return! Thankfully, I have told the Shturmoviki to deal with them!"\n\nOn cue, Shturmoviki stepped forward from the wings and started grabbing men in the audience, dragging them to a fate nobody had to guess. At first, the targets seemed obvious; rivals for regional power, pragmatic collaborators who lacked ideological loyalty, suspected crypto-Jews, and the like. Then they started grabbing others, those who as far as anybody knew had done nothing wrong or disloyal. One stood up and proclaimed "God save Alexei, the tsar who shall be, and God bless his holy regent!" Others joined in, alternating between "Praise Alexei!" and "Praise Dikiy!" but it was futile at stopping some of them from being dragged away. Even some of the Shturmoviki were suddenly arrested by their comrades.\n\nWhen it was all over, the numbers of the audience had been reduced by about half, and the remainder were giving a fervent standing ovation to Dikiy-almost as if their lives depended on it."
 after_midnight.41.a: "Six of one and half a dozen of the other."
 
 after_midnight.42.t: "Two Crosses, Entwined"
 after_midnight.42.d: "The workers scrambled up the side of the Epiphany Cathedral's domed spire, welding torches and bronze sheets in hand. When they arrived at the peak, they quickly affixed the sheets to the back of the cross topping the dome, welded them in place, and gave them a firm shake to make sure they stayed in place. When they came back down, it was clear what they had done: they affixed a swastika to the back of the cross! And while the welders worked on top of the church, a similar commotion happened just outside the front door.\n\n"You cannot do this!" cried Father Nikodim, "you would not dare burn images of Apostles and prophets!"\n\n"We are not burning images of Apostles and prophets," replied a Shturmovik, "we are burning images of Paul the Jew and Moses the Jew. Tell me, Father, are you a Rabbi?"\n\n"N-no," the old man stuttered.\n\n"Is this a synagogue?"\n\n"What does this-"\n\n"Then you should not be keeping images of Jews in your church!" He marched away with the icons in hand, and Father Nikodim went back inside the church, not bearing to look at the sight of the artwork being tossed in the bonfire."
 after_midnight.42.a: "One man cannot serve two masters."
 
 after_midnight.43.t: "Dark Souls"
 after_midnight.43.d: "Regent Dikiy stood along the ridge, binoculars pressed to his eyes. The night was pitch-black, and he could hardly make out anything.\n\nBut that all changed with a flare gun's shot, bathing the field in an eerie red light. Dikiy could see the light glinting off the polished helmets of the Shturmoviki, as well as the tips of their bayonets. They charged forward out of their foxholes and bunkers in the night, toward the village that the damnable Asiatic Buryats had turned into a bulwark of resistance.\n\nGunfire started coming from the village, and some of the Shturmoviki fell, but the rest weren't deterred. They charged with no less valor than before, rifles held firmly, screaming war cries in the name of the tsar and regent. For a moment, Dikiy forgot that the empire had fallen, and he was watching them crush rebels in the first Regent's eastward march all over again.\n\nAt last, the Shturmoviki reached the village, and they began cutting a bloody swathe through it. The sound of screams and gunfire drifted across the air, and Dikiy couldn't help but feel his breast swell with pride."
 after_midnight.43.a: "Perhaps there is some hope for Russia after all."
 
 after_midnight.44.t: "The Noose"
 after_midnight.44.d: "Dikiy stared out of his office window, looking at the moonlight shimmering off the Angara River. It brought him a brief respite, a second of calm in a very chaotic night.\n\nIn happier times, he would have been sound asleep right now. He just couldn't, though. Not when Holy Russia is in such shape. If it were the Polack pretender across the river making a mockery of Alexei's name, it would have been enough. But the financial situation was looking increasingly dire as well. Man cannot live on bread alone, but an army cannot march on prayers to God alone either.\n\nHe took off his glasses and polished them before looking at the river again, as if it could somehow deliver a greater tranquility now that his vision was cleared. Nothing. Suddenly, Dikiy felt incredibly faint, and he staggered toward the armchair in the office's corner before he passed out completely. He felt his glasses slip off his nose, and he vaguely heard a crunch beneath his feet as he flopped into the chair. He would worry about his glasses when he was conscious again."
 after_midnight.44.a: "So he did get some sleep after all."
 
 after_midnight.45.t: "Alone in the Dark"
 after_midnight.45.d: "Regent Dikiy continued staring at the river. It didn't bring him calm anymore-it hadn't in a while-but it provided something to keep his mind distracted for a moment. How long was it since he had been outside, two days? Judging by the pile of plates in the corner of his office, it was probably closer to three. Of course, as far as his men were concerned, he was valiantly conducting affairs of state and solving the problems that plague the regency. But frankly, it was getting hard to tell the difference between the problems and the state. Who was his friend anymore? Who was his enemy? Were his guards up to something? Why did demanding more guard rotations not solve that? Was the officer who planned the guard rotations in on it? What was he in on?\n\nDikiy glanced at the wall, showing a map of Russia, endless lines drawn on it in half a dozen colors showing the ever-shifting borders of the state. That was it! With Russia so divided, he could simply wage wars and keep the guards he distrusted on the front lines at all times! It was genius, why didn't he think of that before?\n\nHe returned to his desk and began feverishly writing, composing battle strategies, drafting mobilization orders, all the energy of a man possessed. Possessed by a divine will to power granted through the intercession of the Tsarevich, no doubt."
 after_midnight.45.a: "The clock ticks onward."
 
 # Amur Refugee Zone Flavour Events #
 
 after_midnight.46.t: "Never Enough"
 after_midnight.46.d: "Anatoly Sobchak's first proper day in Russia was nothing if not busy.\n\nThe moment dawn broke, the former mayor of Chita was bound down the banks of the Amur to follow up with his contacts within Manchukuo. They had promised all kinds of supplies and valuable goods to aid his efforts, so it was only natural that when he had met with these so-called friends of his, they claimed that the deliveries were held up by red tape and various other bureaucratic inconveniences.\n\nUndeterred, Sobchak wasted no time making a beeline for the coast to discuss terms with a wealthy American who claimed to be interested in lending a hand. The meeting did not go well. The American had neglected to mention beforehand that he wanted cold, hard cash in exchange for his help; cash that Sobchak did not have.\n\nAfter some vague promises were made, a deflated Sobchak then looped back to the ruins of Zeya to inspect one of the last remaining armaments industries still in operation. "In operation" turned out to be a generous way of putting it indeed, as the factory had a shortage of workers, working equipment, and electricity. It seemed his militia would have to go even further without even the bare minimum of equipment.\n\nA long day had passed, and Sobchak was not sure he had accomplished anything at all. As he crawled into bed that cold and lonely night, dark thoughts began to creep into places once occupied by cautious optimism. He had returned to Russia to save as many lives as he could, but Sobchak was slowly becoming aware that he may have underestimated the challenges involved. Did the rest of the world even care what was happening here? Today, he may have just received the answer to that question."
 after_midnight.46.a: "We have to keep trying."
 
 after_midnight.47.t: "From Across the Seas"
 after_midnight.47.d: ""Anatoly,\n\nWe have not forgotten about your efforts to bring salvation to Russia's people. You helped us in the past, now allow us to help you. Please accept this shipment as a demonstration of our faith in you.\n\nSincerely, a friend."\n\nAnatoly Sobchak already had a relatively clear picture of who this 'friend' could be. It wasn't too long ago that he was caught up in the whirlwind of the resurgent White movement centered in Chita, with the illegitimate Romanov prince Mikhail Andreevich as its nucleus. Sobchak didn't know what had become of Mikhail after they had fled Russia, but he had assumed that this time the former tsar had given up on Russia for good.\n\nSobchak folded the letter and stashed it in his coat pocket, focusing his attention to the tons of Australian grain being hauled off a ship for transport. If not from Mikhail himself, someone sympathetic to his cause certainly still had a vested interest in Russia. After spending so much time scraping by in hostile territory, Sobchak found it reassuring that he still had some friends out there.\n\nWith the situation deteriorating by the day, he could only hope it would be enough."
 after_midnight.47.a: "We'll take all the help we can get."
 
 after_midnight.48.t: "Without Strings"
 after_midnight.48.d: "The cold air stung Anatoly Sobchak's face as he emerged from the passenger side of the jeep. His journeys across the Refugee Zone had brought him to the derelict dock facilities by the mouth of the Amur, now retrofitted to serve as one of the many pipelines leading out of the blasted hellscape formerly known as Russia. As he approached the scene, he was greeted by a rather familiar elderly officer. "Anatoly Aleksandrovich, I appreciate you coming here on such short notice."\n\n"It's no trouble at all, Nikolay." Sobchak looked over Kossov's shoulder to see a group of foreigners being aggressively questioned by his guards. "What am I looking at here, exactly? Who are these men?"\n\nKossov glanced at the scene behind him before turning back to Sobchak. "We caught these Japanese fellows trying to sneak in by boat. They claim to be here on a humanitarian mission, but my men think they might be here for a different reason."\n\nSobchak sighed. "Tell your men to let them go. Japan has no reason to be spying on us, they've got bigger fish to fry than some naive fools in the middle of Siberia."\n\n"Are you certain, Anatoly? I've spent enough time down south to know that Japan never extends their hand for free. You wish to take that risk?"\n\n"For Christ's sake, Nikolay, let them go. Have you forgotten we're still standing waist-deep in shit? I'm not about to turn away help on the off chance there might be strings attached. Do you even know if they're here on behalf of Japan at all?"\n\nKossov nodded without another word, and with a call to his men, the aid workers were allowed to continue their mission; as Sobchak had guessed, it was apparently one of genuine altruism, rather than the quid-pro-quo they were suspected of."
 after_midnight.48.a: "The world has begun to take notice of our plight."
 
 after_midnight.49.t: "Striking True"
 after_midnight.49.d: "Despite the heavy-duty gas mask that clung to his face, Sergey Fedorovich could not avert his nostrils from the miasma of death that permeated the air. His squad had been sent to pick through an old diamond mine in the middle of god-knows-where, and so far all they had managed to find was frozen cadavers and bombed-out wooden structures. It seemed that if there was anything at all that once called this place home, it had either been looted or sent to a shallow grave. Fighting through a trifecta of freezing temperatures, horrid smells, and poisonous air, Sergey made his way to the center of the dig site where the rest of his comrades had regrouped.\n\n"Sergey!" His superior called out as he approached. He could barely recognize him under all the NBC gear, and Sergey wondered how it wasn't the same story vice-versa. "I think we're just about done here. Go take a look in the tunnels, see if we missed anything. The rest of you, get ready to move out!"\n\nSergey was not enthused about crawling around in a tight space, especially in conditions such as these. He had hoped that the tunnel had collapsed so that he wouldn't have to bother, but as he arrived at his destination, Sergey's hopes were dashed. The mines were clear of any blockages, for the most part, but that was about the only positive thing one could say about their condition.\n\nEven with his flashlight in hand, the tunnels were darker than any place Sergey had ever been, and naturally, they seemed completely barren of any useful minerals. After what seemed like hours of crawling around in the dark, Sergey sighed as he turned to leave, his weary voice echoing off the rocky walls. As he spun around, though, a subtle twinkle in his peripheral vision caught his attention. Turning back to investigate, Sergey shined his flashlight in front of him, and discovered a peculiar rock shining through the rubble..."

 after_midnight.50.t: "Plus Ultra"
 after_midnight.50.d: ""Father, are we ever coming back here?"\n\nThe voice of his 12-year-old son brought time to a stand-still in the mind of Artyom Valentinov, who had been idly staring out across the Bering Sea; waiting for the boat that would take him and his son out of this place. The question was not entirely unfamiliar to Artyom, of course, for he had once asked the same thing of his own father nearly fifty years ago.\n\nThe year was 1921, and the Bolsheviks were in the ascendant. Artyom, a child at the time, was forced to flee his homeland towards safer shores. His days spent in Russia at the time had been nothing if not pleasant, safely growing up in the lap of luxury thanks to his family's wealth. Of course, it was this wealth that had painted a giant crosshair over each and every member of the Valentinov clan, necessitating their escape from the only home they ever knew.\n\nHis father's answer, of course, was yes. After many years spent hiding away in Canada, his promise came true nearly three decades later: when the White Army emerged from hibernation in Harbin to carry on the old fight once again. The Valentinovs would be among the first to return to Russia to aid them however they could.\n\nWhen they had first arrived, they had numbered over a dozen: including Artyom, his wife, and his four sons. Now, only two of this illustrious clan remained; slowly whittled away by the horrors that would blow in from the West like a terrible storm. When Artyom had left Russia, he did so with a homesickness in his heart, but he knew that it was an entirely different story with his son. He had survived, but not without bearing witness to the very worst that humankind had to offer.\n\n"Father?" His son's voice brought him back to the present. Artyom had decided what his answer would be."

 # Free Port Of Magadan Flavour Events #
 
 after_midnight.51.t: "Sailors of Fortune"
 after_midnight.51.d: "Turbulent waves of seawater crashed upon the rugged and precipitous rocks of the shore, seeping into the small, porous holes present within the sides of the old wharves and docks, protruding into the tempestuous open waters of the Sea of Okhotsk.\n\nNikolai Abramov observed the everyday nature of the port from within a modest office, overlooking a remarkable jewel of the Siberian coast: Magadan, humbled only in the Far East by Vladivostok itself. Abramov sat himself down before an aged wooden desk, littered with nautical maps and shipping records, clasping his hands together as he reviewed them with attentiveness. He had once pledged his skills and seamanship to the cause of the Russian Fascist Party, sailing under the banners of national socialism and the swastika. What naive fools they were, relentlessly pursuing empty ideological principles and dogma set in place by distant and bygone men, blinding them from their necessary duties; the two separate branches claimed to be different, yet Abramov held no loyalty to either.\n\nReminiscing about the past is pointless now, he thought. The Russian Fascist Party had ceased to exist long ago, their actions and deeds relegated to the annals of history, but he was still here. Abramov fixed his mind upon present matters; opening a drawer, he placed a map of the region squarely in front of himself, marked with common shipping routes. As he observed the map, he began theorizing about overlooked portions of the ocean where his smuggled cargo could slip past unnoticed from the prying eyes of foreign patrol ships, and which routes would net the most substantial profits.\n\nA series of vessels departed from Magadan's shores, brimming with illicit goods, bound for locations across the seas. Regardless of where they are headed, they will all return to the same place: the port nestled upon the frigid coastline of the Far East."
 after_midnight.51.a: "No storms we cannot weather."
 
 after_midnight.52.t: "Drown Our Sins in Rum"
 after_midnight.52.d: "Balmy, cerulean waves met the rocks and pebbles of Magadan's coast, the skies were bright and cloudless, the seas were calm and placid. A ship could be seen in the distance, its hull adorned with a stripe of dark crimson; despite the fact that dozens of vessels of the same size pass by the icy port to participate in its clandestine operations every day, this ship, in particular, attracted the fixated attention of crowds of sailors and dock workers. Once the ship was in port, the reason for its allure was quickly revealed as the crew unloaded crate after crate of sweet and fragrant alcohol.\n\nTo Nikolai Abramov, the appeal of indulging in alcoholic beverages is something he was all too familiar with. It was a craving that needed to be satiated once in a while, and it brought forth the ecstasy and bliss of temporarily losing awareness of one's abundance of problems and responsibilities; in the current desperate state of affairs, the elevated demand was self-explanatory.\n\nAn abundance of vodka and gin in Magadan itself would certainly be of benefit, Abramov thought. He was aware of the lucrative financial prospects it could bring to the territory, as alcohol was desired in markets all around the world. A single yet crucial issue, however, existed: the acquisition of such goods would prove to be a substantial challenge, as shipping routes for alcohol did not usually cross into the waters of the Sea of Okhotsk. As Abramov continued to deliberate, a thought popped into his mind: piracy. Although he did not have the adequate manpower or equipment necessary for direct involvement, he possessed valuable contacts in the South China Sea, contacts who would gladly divert Japanese alcohol shipments to the north, for a price.\n\nAbramov smiled as he reached for the half-empty bottle of vodka beside his desk, a rarity soon to be plentiful in the frozen northern port."

 after_midnight.53.d: "As the obfuscating darkness of night descended upon the docks and inhabitants of Magadan, the boundless oceans and limitless skies merged into one form, only being illuminated by the faint and delicate glow of the Moon. In the distance, the distinctive shape of a vessel could be seen from the coastline, drifting slowly towards the horizon.\n\nThe unremarkable ship, though nominally transporting a shipment of coal, ferried dozens of men, women, and children; people who wished to begin anew in shores of greater opportunity and stability, people who wished to abandon their dreadful livelihoods in the derelict remnants of a land once called Russia. The atmosphere aboard the ship was one of euphoria and exhilaration; the open decks were brimming with elated men, bottles of vodka in hand, celebrating their progression into a future of hope and optimism. The vivacious and ebullient cheers of ecstasy were interrupted as a deafening crash could be heard from the decks below, the vessel began to tilt gradually as a deluge of frigid seawater poured into the hull with the force of a tempestuous maelstrom, slowly weighing down what had become an iron sarcophagus. The enthusiastic and merry atmosphere of the passengers had dissipated, replaced with expressions of horror and cries of fear as the tumultuous ocean slowly devoured part after part of the ship, forcing the people aboard to resort to increasingly futile attempts at survival, unwilling to accept fate.\n\nNikolai Abramov watched from a distance, his facial expression was one of indifference, having no remorse over what he considered was just. The ship had refused to pay the full amount required for docking and had exited the port, there had to be measures of retaliation, for they must set a clear precedent. Three red flares shot up into the evening sky, a last, desperate plea for rescue; a plea that would never be answered."

 after_midnight.54.d: "The frozen waters of the Sea of Okhotsk, usually calm and placid, were disturbed by the worn steel hulls of a dozen small and antiquated vessels; adorned with the gradually dissipating insignia of the Pacific Fleet.\n\nLeonid stood at the bow of one of the ships, a meager fishing boat repurposed for their use, peering towards the immaculate sheets of drift ice present within the water, contemplating about the acquisition of rations for the week, how the men aboard his ship were going to be fed. He sighed in exasperation as grim thoughts of distress flooded his mind, overwhelming him with dread as he remembered the dire straits they were currently in. He calmed himself down with the last tool still present within his mental arsenal: hope. Hope that the future would not be as forlorn as today; hope that he may return one day to a recovered and united homeland; hope that even as the ships he possessed were paltry in comparison to the mighty vessels of decades past, he would still be able to sail towards the horizon in triumph, smiling with glee.\n\nThe deafening sound of a ship's horn scattered Leonid's thoughts and pulled him back into reality. One of his men pointed towards a strange, foreign ship approaching the modest flotilla. The words "Free Marine Infantry" were inscribed onto the side of the ship, confusing Leonid as the men made contact. Soon, a small party appeared before Leonid and began reciting demands in an emotionless tone, calling for him to surrender his ship. Leonid was taken aback by the bluntness of their words, but knew that he was not in a position to negotiate as made evident by the weapons being brandished by several of the men. He deliberated for a short while before deciding to flatly decline; he had sacrificed too much and toiled for too long to simply abandon everything. No, he would resist.\n\nBefore the words of disapproval left his mouth, he collapsed onto the deck, a pool of blood gathered around his head."

 after_midnight.55.d: "A small fishing boat resided off the coastline of the barren wastes of the Far East. Its craftsmanship was of Manchurian origin, its modest anchor submerged into the frozen depths, lodging itself neatly between rugged underwater rocks. A Chinese man stood on the edge of the stern, his hands clenching a mechanical lever, used to retrieve the net. As he let out a sigh of fatigue and began pulling, he failed to notice the approaching ship; a vessel slightly larger and bulkier than his own, commandeered by men dressed in drab, threadbare woolen uniforms. Before a single word of protest could be uttered, one of the men jumped onto the boat and proceeded to ferociously pummel the fisherman with exceeding force using a rubber cudgel before dragging him, blood-soaked, aboard. The man's ship was seized and taken to the hub of illicit activity that was Magadan, to be sold for a pretty penny at the smuggling market.\n\nAbramov sat squarely before his desk as he sifted through various reports from differing regions and times; sightings of sizable ships with hefty steel hulls, bearing the colors of Manchukuo, armed with imposing guns of different calibers. He slammed his fist onto the wooden table as he continued to contemplate his options; would the self-indulgent Japanese lords to the south truly bother with such trivial affairs as the deprivation of a handful of Chinese fishermen, to the point where they would expend resources to infringe upon sovereign waters? As thoughts raced across his mind, he readjusted his thinking; regardless of whether the specific reports were factual, it certainly would be reasonable to suggest Japanese interference in the Sea of Okhotsk, and as long as there is a slim possibility, his craft would be at stake.\n\nAbramov peered out towards the docks and harbors below, brimming with workers loading and unloading crates upon crates of smuggled cargo; then towards the vast and boundless ocean, stretching for uncountable miles, extending into the horizon. The future would be secured, no matter what."

 after_midnight.56.t: "S.O.S."
 after_midnight.56.d: ""I see a lighthouse!"\n\nThis declaration roused an unusually loud hoorah, and for good reason. In a clumsy first attempt to find a harbour along the coast of Eastern Kamchatka capable of taking them in, this American vessel had nearly run aground several times, sending the sailors closer and closer to panic and possible mutiny each time, the captain becoming the target of silent frustration. At last, the tensions dissipated as the brilliant light of a lighthouse - clearly makeshift, but serviceable enough and certainly a sight for sore eyes - guided them to the destination they had been searching for. Awaiting them was a large, but crude harbour, likely built recently for the specific purpose of receiving aid, such as that carried by the American ship. As they pulled into that harbour, a crowd of Russians, looking largely malnourished but no less jubilant for it, cheered for them. "Come on John, let's not keep them waiting." One sailor called out to another, as the ship anchored. At the sight of the absolute gratitude of the people before them, all the irritations and tensions of the sailors were forgotten, replaced by an earnest and genuine desire to help them survive, and rebuild their lives."

 after_midnight.57.t: "Into the Abyss"
 after_midnight.57.d: "In a tar black night, on the Bering Sea, beneath the thunderous wrath of a storm, a lone Russian ship struggled against the ocean's gluttonous attempts to devour her. She was an old model, a transport ship from some forgotten convoy, bruised from 20 years of hard work and rusted from 30 years of abandonment in a Far Eastern harbor. Her floorboards cracked with every malicious crash of a wave against her hull, and new leaks let loose their payload of freezing water at the cue of the metallic, screeching sounds of plating tearing.\n\nThe wind howled, laced with razorblade sleet, around the Captain's reddening and frostbitten ears as he shouted orders over the roaring of the tides and the deathrattle of his craft. It was too late, of course, but Ivan was never a man to give up on his word - he was going to bring him, his family, and the rest of the refugees to Alaska or die in the heart of the sea. Dying at sea was a blessing compared to what would be in store for them back home.\n\nWith another roar of splitting steel, the ship began to sink rapidly. Ice cold water was lapping its way over the deck, and the crew and passengers atop it were already beginning to tumble into the frothing mouth of the Arctic off the steepening slope of the deck. The ones below... Ivan chose not to think about what had happened to them. Taking in one last shaky breath, he put on a stiff upper lip, and allowed himself to keep the latter half of his promise. The St. Niphon was dragged under, and at last her cries of pain ended along with her crew's.\n\nThe Orthodox graveyard outside of Anchorage was grimly silent under the cold sun. It was empty but for a priest and a single journalist. Four blank gravestones marked the final resting place of the sailors who had been found. The priest gave the four half-frozen men and women their last rites, and the journalist scribbled down yet another story of Russian corpses recovered on the beaches of Alaska."

 after_midnight.58.d: "At a small port on the east of Kamchatka, a mid-sized cargo ship bearing the Canadian flag pulled in and anchored, with dock workers already gathering to help unload it. This had become something of a routine for the locals and sailors alike, working together well to unload the cargo of the ship, now more precious than ever: coal. With quality firewood increasingly scarce and highly priced after everything that had happened to the Russian landscape, coal had become truly invaluable as a cheap and relatively widely available heat source to the ordinary people of Kamchatka, and of what remained of Russia in general.\n\nThe sailors, as friendly as ever, even helped to unload the cargo themselves to lighten the load of the local people, despite the difficulty of communication between the two groups; in times like these, they reasoned, help should not have to be asked for to be received. This was, after all, a humanitarian aid mission meant to distribute, rather than sell, the precious cargo. There was no reason for them to act any other way than humanely."

Snow was still coming down, dusting the streets of Anadyr in a thin coat of pure white that still failed to erase the horrors this city had been subjected to. How could he heal this country from behind a cheap, coffee stained desk in the frozen middle of nowhere?\n\n"Uh, sir? Mr. Artamonov?" Came the voice of the American, cutting through Nikolai's drifting thoughts. "You were talking about why you formed the USSC."\n\nNikolai nodded, clasping his hands together on the desk and forcing a smile at the camera leering at him from across the room. "Yes, right... well, quite frankly it was the only thing I could do." He replied, his thick accent not doing favors for his already weak grasp of English.\n\n"Mhm." Hummed his interviewer, "What exactly do you mean by that?"\n\n"My people were suffering and I had the power to help stop it. So I did."\n\n"Well, surely you could've tried to move somewhere better, yes? Somewhere warmer, somewhere safer, and bring as many of your countrymen as you could fit in a boat. At a certain point, one has to give up."\n\nNikolai paused, and his gaze once more shifted away from the camera and out the window. Sucking in a deep breath, he turned back to the thousands, maybe millions, of eyes watching him through their TV screens. "I refuse to give up on my motherland. She can still be saved, as long as her people continue to fight. We will just have to keep living for tomorrow. Things will get better someday.""

 after_midnight.60.d: "Los Angeles: the City of Angels, the City of Stardom and Fame, the city that breathes the glamor of its state of California. It was nothing short of paradise to a Russian such as Artamonov, who would find it impossible to imagine such a metropolitan sprawl grow on the despoiled soil of Mother Russia. The majesty of its skyscrapers, the glitz of its bustling streets; it was so foreign and odd, yet so enticing and magnificent, so much so that there were a few close occasions of the man nearly bumping into a streetlight or person, just by how enamored he was with this place.\n\nAs part of their government delegating funds to commencing humanitarian efforts in the Kamchatka region, Nikolai Artamonov was invited to the States as a guest while the first of many aid fleets were to set course for the Russian coast. The experience was most welcome by him, for the soothing warmth and diamond shine of L.A. certainly beat the icy storms and rocky geography of Siberia - as much as he hated to admit. One could just close their eyes shut and let themselves be swallowed by the sea of sounds and visuals that shaped this kingdom of liberty, this haven of humanity - and Artamonov would do just that.\n\nAs the world around him went dark with his shut lids, Nikolai could hear the Siren's song purring into his eardrums, the beeping of cars and the clamors of passerby serving as the symphony to which she seduced this battered soul to stay and remain in its urban paradise. He could feel the city's ethereal arms wrapping upon his heart coated with ice, melting away its casing as to let it beat free from the terror that besieged it in Russia. He would no longer need to worry of the horrors that lurked east, it murmured; he would not even worry of missing any food to eat or people to see. A home that awaited him with great arms.\n\nNikolai could smile to the sweet words and mellow promises, yet home was not what his spirit sought most. The Siren's call was strong and charming, but that of Mother Russia's was stronger and passionate. For as much as this city was prosperous, he still had his promise to keep for those lost souls seeking freedom in Russia."

Shivering, he huddled closer to his torn vatnik and trudged forward.\n\nNature had long reclaimed the grave for its disuse. Weeds grew and roots crept along its narrow walkways, and the brambles around it became heavy, snow-crusted thickets that engulfed the rotting poles of what once was a wooden fence. Concrete and rusted rebar jutted from the clearing's centerpiece: a small mound inscribed with stones.\n\nHe neared the makeshift headstone. Amid the crude invectives and Jewish stars was etched a small hammer-and-sickle. He ran a thumb on the faded red insignia - a hero, it said, rested here. The Shturmoviki never could do these signs away, no matter how many heroes they slew at the Mad Regent's behest. Yet they were slain in droves regardless, leaving the meek and the cowardly to emulate their deeds for the people's sake.\n\nLike him. Once a lowly figure among the Zhukovs and Tukhachevskys of the Red Army, and now the only one among his peers to outlast the empire. They left him with their legacy, millions of starving stomachs and Russia's least arable land this side of the Urals. So much saddled on so small a man.\n\nPerhaps that was what brought Alexander Altunin here, kneeling on a tomb forgotten by everyone save maybe God, as the pale moon glowed wanly and the cold bit into his skin. If he murmured the right words and stayed long enough, then maybe a proper hero would rise from his slumber and save Russia from a slow, painful death."

A respectable distance from Äänislinna, the squat concrete-grey edifice defied the endless white landscape while still enjoying civilization's amenities: electric lamps, thermostats, toilets, feasts. Finnish hospitality left the general warm for the first time in years.\n\nHe should've anticipated Finnish deceit long before the diplomat offered vodka. Pride would've spirited them back to Arkhangelsk; they may not have even left at all. Alas, now they were in Finland, facing a dilemma with only one answer.\n\n"No two nations can coexist without respecting each other's sovereignty," the diplomat continued. "Vacuous proclamations may suffice now - but in ten years' time? When our children may yet stare at Soviet cannons from across the Neva?" The diplomat tapped at the leather-bound treaty on the dinner table. "That's what ink and paper is for."\n\nSome recess in Alexander's mind conjured moments studiously learnt in Novosibirsk. His namesake Nevsky on Chudskoye Lake; Pozharsky and Minin in Moscow; princes and boyars breaking the Tatar yoke at Kulikovo. Anything to will him to resist the invader trampling upon sacred Russian soil.\n\nThe spent man felt nothing; and so he muttered tired goodbyes as his signature graced the Suomalaiset's bargain."

His left leg was wrapped up to the knee in scraps of cloth and dirty gauze, dark blood oozing through the thin fabric. As the medics left, Eino and his team gathered around the boy for another operation among far too many.\n\nSurgical knives cut through sticky linen. Tweezers peeled off layers of gauze. While Reeta told the boy everything would be fine, his wound was laid bare for all to see.\n\nThe boy screamed. Reeta and Heljä sobbed. Someone - could be Vaino, could be Eevert - expelled their lunch onto the tent's thin walls. Time slowed for Eino, and his eyesight grew clearer, as if he could pinpoint every pustule, bone pore and blackened vein on what used to be a leg.\n\nHe had first heard of Taborite in Tampere. Chlorine trifluoride and more besides, said the Department of Chemistry. Tissue death in half a minute and necrosis in five, said Dr. Väinämöinen. Few survive before they even feel their skin rot and peel off - so was this boy lucky or not?\n\nDr. Eino shook his head as the world around him returned. No time to waste with half a healthy limb.

It laid with his seal affixed on top of a pile of letters, each addressed to different men from different nations, but all carrying the same incessant appeal.\n\nThese were the product of sleepless nights, between which Dr. Braginsky had urged him to rest. The Grand Marshal was no ignorant fool; he'd seen STAVKA's estimates. 20 Russians an hour lost to hunger. A full night's sleep would condemn a century and half. Better he catch sickness putting food on a peasant's table than lose a company after every nap.\n\nWith perfect timing, Vasya barged in as his coughs returned.

Shakily he knelt up, sifting through broken chairs and broken glass until he met face-to-face with the fount of all his woes. Gimlet eyes pierced holes up and down the crumpled, bloodied paper as a faithless man prayed to every god he knew that its contents were false: that some divine inspiration would smite its wrongs and assure him all is well.\n\nYears hiding like mice from the Shturmoviki. Months whoring Russia out to the world for morsels. Sleepless weeks staving off Larionov, Melkikh, famine, petty gangs, his own fucking men from overdrink.

Here, the highest industrial authorities in the regency had convinced Taboritsky to allow for a sole concession: a single, massive skyscraper, stripped clean of the Regent's wasteful requirements and obsessions, a black tower dominating an ashen grey landscape. Taboritsky's only request, a metal sculpture of Tsar Alexei, was slowly being dismantled by construction crew as twelve limousines slipped through the gates and entered the monolith.\n\nIn the first hours of morning, a cabal of the regency's industrial leaders entered Meeting Room 25 in the top floor of the Kostroma office, flanked by a pair of guards and several emaciated servants. The bright light from the room's massive window was almost blinding against the dim light of the office interior. Through it, Consortium Chairman Nikolay Talberg appeared as a spectre, casting a long shadow onto the oblong table.\n\nTalberg began to speak with a quiet gravity that forced the consortium to take heed. "Look out, beyond this window, and see what the Regent has given us. It approaches greatness..." A legion of chairs began to turn, though no one said a word.

Yet plans for German investment died on the leaves as if one of Taboritsky's hideous vessels had flown overhead and smited the earth itself.\n\nIf only there were less ideologues on company boards, men who depended on feeble Untermenschen fears to sleep at night. Those men, the so-called thinkers of the boardroom, always balked at the Consortium. When they saw the pictures of the massive cathedrals, smeared with filth and packed with broken beings, they were afraid. Despite every inclination, their minds could not help but focus on the faces of the workers, smeared with sweat and grime, wincing in anguish or hanging in defeat. A face which could be German.\n\nAfter the slideshow, when the slim and upright Consortium representative walked to the head of the boardroom, the ideologues would silently beg for a justification, a reason, something to make it all okay. And the representative, unaware of this primal terror, would say nothing.\n\nBut occasionally, a man of action, of discipline, would stare at the production line and not see a line of broken figures, crackling and bending in endless toil.

His body demanded sleep - he had been up for far too long for his age. But this would work. The chairman was certain of it.\n\nThis was the deal that the Consortium had been waiting for. Even a week ago, German investment seemed like a dream. Even Talberg was surprised when he heard a corporation was interested in an offer. Now, two representatives sat in front of his desk, eyeing every detail and passing notes.\n\nTalberg raised his glass. "A toast to industry," Talberg said, as his assistant poured his guests a drink. As crimson red flowed into two stained glasses, he thought in horror about just how rare wine of this quality had become after the Regent. The last good bottle of wine in Russia, poured into the mouths of German swine.\n\nFor a minute or so, the representatives chatted among themselves, grinning and pointing. Nikolay was certain they were laughing at him. He knew why they'd even attempt to make a deal, and it wasn't out of German kindness. It was violence. They were younger than him. Stronger than him. Bloodhounds on the hunt, ready to rip out his neck and bring the corpse to German masters.\n\nFinally, one spoke in broken Russian - "This... good wine. May we see?" Talberg handed over the bottle, frustrated but willing to put up with anything. It was a Zweigelt, imported from Austria some twenty years prior. The two paused. "Aryan. Of course.

A decade ago they called them Untermensch - here, they called them restricted workers.\n\nToday, Donner hadn't brought his battalion. This was a private meeting, purely to discuss finances. From what Donner had heard, the Consortium was extremely generous. So long as they got what they needed, they'd give you what you wanted - no questions asked.

A young, pale figure, with sunken eyes and a concave belly, had stopped his cart to observe this stranger. A younger Donner would've crushed him - now, it seemed barely worth the effort. The Waffen-SS had shown Donner every depravity he could try, and left him numb.\n\nAn intrusive thought reached Donner's mind - perhaps the slave felt the same. But this was impossible. The slave had not traveled the world. The slave had not felt the heat of the African jungle, or the glory of victory on the front line. The slave had done nothing, and was given nothing.

Artemov moved to grab his pistol, but found it missing. A fatal mistake.\n\nArtemov's heart began to beat faster, as his eyes circled the room. Now, he was aware of how alone he really was, how many others hid in the dark.

While they were assuredly decisions made for the benefit of Holy Russia, Larionov more often than not found himself putting out fires left over from the foibles of the previous administration.\n\nA sudden crash of thunder from outside the window of his bedchambers caused the aging man to jump to his feet in fright. With a muttered swear, he wobbled over to close the window that had been thrown open by the wind. Panting from the exertion of walking across the room, he slid down the wall, coming to a rest on the floor.\n\nA sudden idle fancy struck him: perhaps they would let him abdicate? It was clear that he was in over his head, surely the others could see that. He would simply retire from politics, and let someone more competent take up the reigns.\n\nHis sudden hopes were dashed as quickly as they had appeared. Of course they wouldn't just let him leave. He knew too much, had seen too much. No, it was much more likely that they would simply kill him for daring to admit that things were any less than perfect. With a soft groan, he placed his head into his hands and began to sob."

Though his status as a captain of the Shturmoviki allowed him the privilege of eating in the officers' mess, he tended to take his meals alongside his men. It was something he figured was good for morale, and he did truly care about them. The downside of course was that he rarely got to eat his food in peace.\n\n"Andreev, you know what the Regent says about gossip," he responded. Andreev was a good boy, really. Earnest in a way that a lot of new recruits weren't, and halfway competent with a rifle. Valery had noticed a general decline in the competence of the new faces in his regiment. Some tried, and just couldn't hack it, though he could tell that many more were in it simply for a paycheck and a warm bed. He missed the old days, where they fought for the preservation of the Russian race.\n\nAndreev's face fell, flushing a bit at the chastisement. "'Idle gossip is the tool of the devil,' I know, but this is too big not to tell," he said, "Olev told me that he heard the entire outpost got wiped out by partisans."\n\n"What?" Valery asked, incredulity plain in his voice.\n\n"It's true. The entire garrison there is just gone, almost to the man! This never would have happened under Taboritsky, but now that Larionov is in charge-"\n\n"Shut it," Valery hissed, "Do you know what that kind of talk will get you? A one way trip to the gallows, that's what. Stop talking about this, and tell your friend Olev that if he knows what's good for him, he'll keep his mouth shut too."\n\nSuitably chastened, Andreev turned back to his food with muttered apologies. Valery wondered if he had been too hard on the lad, though he knew that what he had said was correct. The higher ups would never allow such talk to fester, though truthfully, he found himself starting to think along the same lines."

"You'll have direct access to the Regent's holy words," they would say, "The closest to God and Alexei."\n\nIf he were being honest, he didn't know anything about being close to God, but Antonin took a certain pride in his work. He helped the Regent with what he could, and had quickly become indispensable to the day to day operations of the state.\n\nThe pay wasn't half bad either, which was nice.\n\nA grandfather clock that sat at the edge of his little office struck nine, its dolorous chime startling him from his work. Letting out a soft groan, he stretched his arms, feeling each pop as his tired joints settled back into place. Antonin had recently started staying later at the office, helping the Regent with whatever he needed done. He was getting rather worried about Larionov, actually. The Regent had recently been overtaken by a palsy, his movements stiff and shaky, and day by day was growing into less of the person that Antonin had once so admired. More than once had he found the Blessed Regent wandering around his office, muttering confusedly to himself, and would need to be gently reminded as to what he was supposed to be doing at any given point in time. Larionov was growing forgetful, which meant that Antonin needed to stay on his toes more than ever.\n\nGrabbing his coat, Antonin walked out into the cool night air of Vyatka. He wasn't a doctor, but he knew in his gut that there was something seriously wrong with the Regent. Perhaps it was just stress? He could only hope it was nothing more serious."

His hands shook as he tried to untangle himself from the unfamiliar bedsheets, his mind stuck in a haze as he glanced furtively around. The Regent could feel his heart pounding out of his chest, his breathing heavy. With an agonizing slowness, he got up from the unfamiliar bed, reaching for a pistol hidden in the unfamiliar nightstand.\n\nA knock on the door broke the silence of the room, and the Regent's eyes snapped towards the sound. Slowly, he brought the pistol up to bear, the weapon trembling in his grasp. The doorknob turned, and a young man poked his head in. "Good morning Regent," he said, warmth in his voice, "I hope you slept well-"\n\n"Who are you?!" the Regent interrupted, turning the pistol on the intruder. The young man blanched, stepping through the door with his hands raised. "Where have you taken me? Don't you know who I am?" Spittle flew from his lips as his voice grew louder with every proclamation. "I promise you that your death will be agonizing!"\n\n"It's just me, Antonin, your secretary," the young man said, his voice shaking. He took a cautious step forward. "Regent, are you well? Do you need me to send for a doctor?"\n\n"Stay away!" Larionov screamed, cocking back the hammer and gesticulating wildly, "Don't come any closer, or I swear that I'll shoot!"\n\nHe saw the young man's eyes flick to something behind him before he was tackled to the ground. Two men wearing security uniforms were standing over him, ripping the gun away from his hands. "Get a fucking doctor, now!" he heard one of them shout. The young man in the doorway fled, presumably to fulfill these orders, but the Regent didn't care.\n\nThe world grew dark, and the Blessed Regent wept like a child."

Most doctors had fled Vyatka some time ago, and only the bravest, or perhaps the most foolish, remained.\n\n"There's not much more that I can do," the doctor said, his voice tired. He had been in the room with the Regent for some time. "He's comfortable, I can say that much."\n\n"Do you know why it happened?" Antonin pleaded.\n\nThe doctor shrugged. "Could be anything. Stress from overwork, dementia, it doesn't really matter. What does matter is that he's confined to his bed. He won't be able to govern, of course."\n\n"Of course," the secretary replied, "Thank you doctor." Antonin nodded to two of the Shturmoviki posted along the wall, and they grabbed the doctor by the arms and escorted him from the room. The doctor would be killed, of course. It would never do for the people to learn that a second Regent had gone the same way as the first.\n\nWith the room now empty, Antonin walked over to his desk, sinking into his chair with a sigh. He wasn't stupid. He knew that what happened to the doctor would soon happen to him. He was nobody important, just a secretary who knew too much. He would meet his end the minute the rest of the ministers learned about what had happened.\n\nUnless.\n\nA sudden thought struck him, and his eyes shot open. Did the ministers have to know? It wouldn't be that unusual for the Regent to become suddenly reclusive, secrecy was quite common in the empire after all; and he could forge all of the signatures necessary. Antonin's mind was a blur; he let out an almost panicked laugh at the thought. It could work. It would work.\n\nIt had to work."

 #The Christian Republic of Samara
 after_midnight.76.t: "Genesis"
 after_midnight.76.desc: "Samara lay well within the grasp of the Regent, and apathy infected every rotten crevice therein. The mottled apartment complexes gazed over the people eking out an existence, left to buckle and break under Taboritsky. Russia found itself content with its quiet despair, and found no reason to break out of it- the Shturmoviki made sure to maintain that apathy, and the people knew not to break from it. Russia waited. With every day spent waiting for change, Russia's will decayed, its spirit abolished in favor of heresy. Such was the fate of the people of Samara - victims to apathy, soldiers of sloth. Russian spirit was born anew, and in a sense, it repeated. When clergymen gave sermons to their people, the people listened - the word of the Lord had returned to Russia, expunged too long by insanity. When what few Catholics of Russia flocked to the city, apathy began its own death, its inevitable supernova showering the city in determination. When the people took up arms in the name of liberation, apathy's death was ensured, and the city was showered in fire and lead.\n\n"Any word of the ROA?" Vladkya Pimen shouted to nobody in particular, as he stood besides a field hospital consisting of those in Samara who knew to hide their talents, everyone working on a burn victim or shrapnel ridden partisan - shouted, as the gunfire crackling throughout main street had yet to dissipate. The Vyatkan officers and clergy members surrounding him made up what effectively amounted to an escort, as vengeful Shturmoviki prowled the alleyways and windows, prompting the guard to bring with them a dozen AT grenades. Down the street, a flare's light lit up a smokescreen, occasionally glowing with the harsh streaks of gunfire, and a figure growing clear from out of the smoke, bearing a bandaged arm, half-sprinting past the mortar teams taking position along the sides of the street. By the time he got to the escort, his arm had grown soaked through with blood, and he was panting like a beaten dog. "Your Excellency-" He took in a deep breath, then continued. "The ROA remnant armies have been finishing off the remaining regency forces in the north of the city-" he gestured towards the roof of an office block on the verge of collapsing with his good hand, as the thump of mortars flew over it, "and we have reports of clergy arming slaves in Nizhny Novgorod. That's all we know. Now if you'll excuse me..." The officer nearly fell into one of the cots lining the sidewalk."

 after_midnight.77.desc: ""Fuck me, how are there so many people still in Russia?" Fredrik looked to his desk, and felt like he was going to be sick. Coffee ran out long ago, and his collection of teabags now rotting in his waste bin was allowing for a disgusting manifestation of his work ethic to take shape within the confinement of his trivial workspace. Outside, shouting matches had been taking place all day, night, and day, concerning what went where, and how much could be spared. From the sounds of it, nothing. From the looks of it, too. Foodstuffs hadn't exactly been plentiful prior to the takeover, and now they simply did not exist. So had his twenty Manila folders told him, anyways. Feeling around his pockets, Fredrik pulled out his last cigarette. Rolling it around in his fingers, he could tell the filter was liable to snap. Poor manufacturing skills, the cost of half your skilled workers being turned to brick-layers or corpses. The image of the uprising flashed to Fredrik's mind, prompting him to take out his match box.\n\nThat was better. Now, he could really think. Right; the problem was a total lack of infrastructure for essentials, and everyone was starving from their side of the Don to Nizhny Novgorod. If only everyone knew just how bad things were in this goddamned city. The tobacco and tea had mixed together into a vomit-inducing smell, certainly not helped by the figures sitting on the paper behind Fredrick, as he sat in front of his desk, and watched the smoke dissipate as the ceiling fan chopped it to pieces. This wasn't enough. Walking out the door, he left it open, half to air out the diseased waste bin, half to show his superiors he hadn't been sleeping, as if the smell wasn't enough an indicator. Stepping outside, the streets of Samara weren't actually crowded, not by his definition, but the signs of a city fit for starvation were everywhere. He let out a puff of smoke and stepped down from his office steps with an irrelevant urgency, as the reports he'd left unfinished in his office would need much more than the seconds he'd saved. As he walked, he checked his surroundings. He walked past a couple, thin as his pencils, and half as strong. They looked at him as he passed, half expecting themselves to be shot by him. "The Russian look", they called it. The figures showed there would be another few thousand in Samara by tomorrow."

 after_midnight.78.desc: ""Are we ready?" Grandmaster Pimen looked up from the paper sitting between himself and the small crowd. Vladimir Bayersky, the last ROA general, half-asleep, gestured to the paper script in front of the both of them. The hall the meeting was taking place in was a relic of Taboritsky's exploits, redecorated to abolish the vile memories of the unspeakably horrific character. The mural to the Tsarevich, a symbol of the horrific actions taken in his name, was repainted with the dull yellows and reds into a scene of the heavens, though with the scheme adorning the wall, it was hard to associate the scene with anything but the land below their feet. The swastikas hanging from the walls were burnt, and candles were lit in the name of a new age. The grandmaster looked to his surrounding accomplices. A half-dozen civilian governors, the general, all standing around each other in equal stoic hope and total impatience. This little ceremony was a luxury they could hardly afford, and yet here they were, standing around the republic's soon-to-be constitution. The right to vote was the first, an obvious pick since authority was established in Samara. The right to pray was, again, inherent. The power to conscript any one citizen into the armed forces was an unpopular decree, but still one many saw as essential.\n\nSo the list went, and by the time the last rights and responsibilities were uttered, all signed the piece of paper along the dotted lines and returned to their duties. How could they not, when crime and homelessness were skyrocketing? The civilians returned to their offices to direct where aid was to go, while General Bayersky returned to his duties of maintaining the fledgling national army. Grandmaster Pimen would not be so sudden to leave. Walking up and down the darkened temple, Pimen pondered whether this constitution would make any kind of a difference. With refugees pouring into Samara, Catholic or not, they'd be proving a deficit upon the nation as a whole. The situation could certainly be fixed with time, though that was something the republic did not have."

It was days like this that kept Vladkya Pimen cooped up in his musty office, trapped with his stale coffee, the vapor once surrounding it long since dulled into a lukewarm haze. Taking a pause to collect himself, Pimen looked to his hands, and put down his pen. Letting out a sigh, he pushed his maroon leather seat away from his beaten, oak table, and looked to the brass knobs of the drawers to his desk, filled with stacks of paper, denoting one piece of information after another. His office was the bureaucratic highway into the future, and Vladkya Pimen knew just how bleak it looked. All that awaited to complete his understanding of the republic was to review its first census. His door was heaved open, and the metropolitan sighed. Here it was - Pimen could already feel it off of the poor sap handing it over to him. This was the census.\n\nIt was a collection of seven different sheets of paper, the topmost one scarred by a coffee stain. Held together by a flimsy paper clip, it was a miracle the report hadn't fallen apart in his hands. Quickly scanning the front page, he felt a sensation of sweat and grime, probably from the ever-stressed accountants and bean-counters handing things over to someone who knew about as much on where that report was supposed to go as anyone else. Vladkya Pimen couldn't keep fooling himself. As many details as he tried to make note of, he couldn't erase that feeling in the back of his head that he needed to just read the paper. He refocused his eyes over the ink, and read. What the aides heard was not precisely describable, only really identifiable through what it must be doing to the office therein. Crackling of wood could definitely be made out, as could the splinters creeping from under the door. A wailing was equally audible, if now withering into a subdued whimper. After ten minutes of the charade, the door was finally pushed open by the metropolitan, now looking to be disheveled beyond what any of the young accountants had ever seen in their entire lives. He had tears flowing down his face, and scanned over his flock."

However, the only soldiers in sight were those keeping the jeering crowds back from the spies bound and gagged atop the stage, four nooses staring at them from across the unsteady planks. All four of them had varying severity of gashes along their faces, and ragged clothing was nearly ubiquitous. As closely as they resembled refugees, they were Shturmoviki.\n\nThe criminal on the far left, wearing a dulled scarf and shoddy, thin coat, had his face broken like shattered glass. The thinner, second thug from the left apparently surrendered at the first opportunity and begged all the way to Samara for food. If only he knew how bad things had gotten in this city. The traitor to the middle-right seemed to yell at the hungry man - not that it could be heard over the shouting of the enraged crowds. According to his captors, Pimen had heard the madman wore a combat vest before it was seized from him, leaving him with nothing but his slacks and a green jacket. Judging from the dozen or so guns seized from his apartment, he was ready to take on the entirety of the national army. Finally, the last man seemed as though he'd be dead in a minute anyway. On the stage, he wore a heavy trench coat, and seemed nauseous while staring at his noose, and had the sick complexion of someone about to vomit bile across himself, and judging from his clothes, already had.\n\nAs the guards lifted the degenerate terrorists to their nooses, the jeering from the crowd, the pushing and shoving, grew so intense that it seemed a riot would break out. Then, the stage groaned. And with an uneasy creak, it crashed to the ground. The guards fell over or found themselves trapped beneath the boards. The mob climbed over the wreck and pulled out the bodies of the bloodied thugs. Then, the mob tore them limb from limb. The metropolitan watched and felt an urge to act, to say "This is wrong.""

Yet, difficulty was an odd word when discussing the times that had fallen upon the former lands of Russia. If you couldn't put up with some difficulty after all, you hadn't survived the Mad Regent's reign.\n\n"Comrades." He began, having said the entire speech twice before in Russian and Polish helped him feel in his head for the right Kazakh words to use, though he doubted his grasp of the tongue was about to win any ovations from those listening over the radio.\n\n"It is with great pleasure that I can say the last bastion of the Mad Regent's butchers in these lands have been brought to justice by your revolutionary brethren in the Autonomous Soviet Liberation Army." Kukliński paused for a few moments, the cheers would need to die down before he delivered the full message. "The many peoples of this land have struggled for decades against fascist tyranny, and that struggle is something we shall endeavour to continue to the utmost. Yet I am here not to talk of that struggle just at the moment, I am here to tell you that there is much work to do before that moment will arrive. The day when the red banner of socialism shall fly from Lisbon to Vladivostok awaits us yet. But first, first comrades, we must rebuild our homes. We must bury those lost, and we must create a future for our children."\n\nThe speech continued long after that of course, but those few sentences were what stuck in the minds of the Kazakhs who listened in. Though the Pole's grasp of the language was nominal, something about what he said struck a light of hope in their thoughts. For the first time in years, men and women went to sleep not afraid of what the dark night outside held."

Refugees had poured into the rebuilt town of Zhanakala, burnt to the ground by the Regent's men. But with the ASLA in control now, people felt it safe to return to the urban zones - safe enough that a town once barely holding 5,000 people hosted nearly 12,000 refugees amidst the ruins and the new surrounding tent city. Some were Poles, who'd fled from first the fascists and then been some of the Mad Regent's last targets. Many were Russians, fled from the same but hated by Pole and Kazakh alike for being perceived as getting off lightly. The Kazakhs were smaller in number so far north in the ASLA to begin with, but the Mad Regent's efforts had reduced that number even further.\n\nThe standoff was between representatives of all three: a grizzled Kazakh soldier who Ivan knew led a militia, a one-armed Pole clutching his party membership, and a Russian woman garbed like a nurse with an ancient rifle slung on her shoulder. Ivan didn't need to take more than a glance to know things would end in bloodshed if he didn't intervene.\n\nIt had apparently begun with the Kazakh and the Pole arguing over whose land the town had been built on to begin with, and when the Russian had tried to say it didn't matter, the response from the other two had blamed the actions of Taboritsky on Russian imperialism as a whole. Ivan supposed he should have been surprised by those thoughts, but he'd heard similar enough ones too often from gaunt sunken eyed refugees. He supposed he couldn't blame them for tying the actions of a tyrant to his people.\n\nIn the end though, he was able to disperse the three before anyone was struck. Promising to find some more homes for the injured and elderly amongst those in the tents managed to get their minds of the more petty conflict they'd been engaged in. For Ivan, it was merely another day in life. He knew something else would happen tomorrow, but that was to come. Peace had been maintained for now."

Inwardly, she cursed the Purification men for the thousandth time; the father of her two girls wasn't even Russian! He'd been an Udmurt by ancestry, not that it had mattered to the men who shot him.\n\nA thunderous explosion heralded a handful of converted trucks clattering over the nape of the hill that had allowed the column to escape the initial attack, and to Ayim's horror, there were machine guns mounted above the cabins of each. In her hurry to push her daughters behind the small crate that contained their belongings, Ayim missed the first cries of relief from ahead. But as the sound of the machine guns stopped, she finally looked out of the wagon to see a sight Allah himself couldn't have made any more welcome.\n\nOn either side of the carts ahead of her were advancing figures with red and white patches on their arms, soldiers, but not shooting at her. Horsemen yelled battle cries as they careened into the front ranks of the Purification men, giving enough time for a pair of ancient tankettes to open up with their cannons on the armed trucks. The fight that continued behind her wagon as it entered the territory of the Autonomous Soviet Liberation Army was fierce, but Ayim could only offer a quick prayer to Allah in thanks.

It gave them some hope for what was to come shortly.\n\n"Comrade Kukliński," It was Delkin who spoke first, his mustache twitching with nervousness as he chose his words carefully. "My colleagues and I have come to you today to ask that at the next elections, whether there may be a greater number of parties on the ballot than at present." A short chorus of affirmations from those gathered behind him followed. "Given the victories of the ASLA over the last of the Regent's nearby forces after all, there is no reason for continued restrictions of political expression."\n\nThe next words Delkin might have been about to give voice to died in his mouth as Kukliński simply raised a hand to indicate silence. "I'm afraid that would be impossible, Comrade Delkin, the dangers have not yet passed and we are surrounded by those who might seek to undermine the revolution again. Was there anything else?"\n\nHalf a dozen voices rose to object, Delkin's not among them. For a few moments Kukliński evidently considered trying to answer them, before sighing and ordering his guards to dismiss them from the room.

Then again, he supposed the socialists weren't exactly thrilled to have been forced to give him the job either, except that there really was nobody else with any leadership experience amongst the people of Nowy Hel. Well, the priest reflected, as he gazed off to the side where the other half of the village's administration sat on a tattered but still functional prayer mat, not quite the only one.\n\n"You do realise there will be problems if we build either the church or the mosque separately." Imam Rinat grumbled. The man was even older than Filip, and had escaped three prison camps in his lifetime which had not helped his demeanour, but his scarred face belied a genuine talent for both numbers and farming.\n\n"There will be complaints if it is not built at all as well." Filip offered as a rejoinder. Rinat simply stared at the mixed band of men and women setting up tents by the riverside before shaking his head.\n\n"We need a mill and a place to pray, we don't have enough bricks for three and we can't use mud for a mill. Separate rooms will have to do." The Imam promptly started coughing. Once perhaps Filip might have despaired at that blunt statement of fact, but as he looked at the mix of Poles, Kazakhs, and a dozen other peoples from whom the flock before him had once belonged to, working together in the harsh sun, Filip felt it wasn't so insurmountable a goal.\n\n"I think we can manage that."

An all-encompassing eclipse had engulfed Tatarstan's verdant fields in Cimmerian darkness. This, however, was not meant to last, for the eclipse would eventually subside. The rapidly retreating penumbra had left behind several vestiges of their presence, symbols of the abhorrent suffering they had brought upon these lands. To many, they were rallying points for retribution.\n\nA resentful tempest of jagged daggers and deafening gunfire descended upon the Russian Shturmoviki guards of the slave outpost, frightened and stupefied. Unintelligible shouts and cries brimming with rage and indignation accompanied the screams of fear as sharp steel viciously cut into the flesh of petrified Russian guards, tattering their woolen uniforms, covered in fresh stains of crimson. Bursts of white, hazy smoke permeated into the air as Tatar firearms emptied their loads into the backs of fleeing men, the copper-plated bullets lodging themselves within various body parts with infallible precision. Pleads for mercy were met with the distinctive crackles of a pistol, their bodies lifelessly collapsing onto the ground.\n\nAs any semblance of opposition began to dissipate within the camp, the assailants turned their attention towards the liberation of their countrymen, rendered slaves by the Shturmoviki. They were unbound from their shackles and released from their fetters, hundreds upon hundreds returned to their homes alongside their liberators, free men once more. The remnants of the site, as a final act of vengeance, were set alight. From afar, the camp engulfed in flames stood as a fiery brazier; a symbol and a warning of the resilience of the Tatar people."

To others, however, it served as a rationale for perseverance; a reason to endure and rebuild, to emerge from the debris in glorious triumph and prosperity.\n\nA council of steadfast Tatars gathered in a chamber, all of them irking to speak and share their opinions; this was the governing body of the newly proclaimed Idel-Ural Free State, an assembly comprised of peoples once oppressed and persecuted under the regimes of old. Within minutes, the council was engaged in fierce debate upon the matter of Russians in their territory, the people that were responsible for the current state of sorrow and agony.\n\n"Expulsion!

A voice shouted across the room in rage followed by a series of cheers.\n\n"By expelling them, all we would be doing is repeating the methods that they have employed; we would be no better!" An equally rambunctious voice cried out.\n\nThe discordant discussion proceeded for hours, with the voices of different figures dominating the room at different moments. Despite the frenzy of emotions, however, no common consensus was reached; the Russians of Kazan would be allowed to remain, for now."

Despite no longer needing to hide in secret cellars and chambers from the prowling Shturmoviki jackals, despite no longer having to live by the mandate of fear settled into policy by that madman and his perfidious cult of whispering snakes, he did not feel the sweet essence of relief washing down his burdened soul. Yes, he and his people, the Tatars, have been given freedom amid the apocalypse of Taboritsky, but now they must face a new, greater challenge.\n\nThey were now free, but now they must heal and recover.\n\nAnvar was no doctor, but he was an academic in a different field: that being the teaching of his people's rich culture to the new generation, so that they may in turn share it to their descendants for as long as time shall last. Taboritsky saw that all of the peoples he deemed "inferior" to his Greater Russians were to be eradicated from the annals of history - his history. The scholar had witnessed himself the cruelty that had been inflicted upon his people's great works and memorable texts, the Shturmoviki proving meticulous in incinerating and shredding all matters of scripture that so much as oozed 'degeneracy'. The smell of burning paper still haunted his senses, even as the cold Ural breeze surged into his lungs as he remained stood before the husk of an old, burned school - the stench of their ignorance, serving as his scar from that ghastly regime.\n\nThankfully, some of the important knowledge had been preserved in his aging mind - but he was just one literate man amid a sea of broken, illiterate souls within the village he called home. Most of his wards barely had an understanding of the basic history of the Tatar, barely adjusted to the general teachings. To make it worse, almost all of his peers were survivors of those horrid death camps, their minds forever hijacked by the ghastly sights they have witnessed within those fenced compounds of misery and agony - it barely left enough space for such younglings to even build the motivation to study.\n\nSlowly, he brought himself to sit down upon the front steps of the school, his shoulders forever burdened with the arduous task of salvaging a history torn to shreds and cast to the winds of fate. For as much as he was wise and filled with knowledge, there was no plausible solution to rebuilding what was now forever lost. All he could truly do was ponder... and weep."

She looked around her, but found only the familiarly unfamiliar people who shared the communal housing with her - only one of a number of similar places for those with no family, no home to return to. There were no Shturmoviki to be seen, and yet they could not be unseen. They were gone, that was certain, but not forgotten, many years from being forgotten if they ever could be.\n\nShe had been but a girl when she had been sent to one of Taboritsky's camps, and now she was a young woman, left without anything in the world except the identity the Shturmoviki had tried to eradicate her for. Being a Tatar had cost her everything, and now it was all she had. Standing up carefully so as not to wake the others in the room, she walked over to the door to the room and leaned against it, clasping her hands together in silent prayer. There, she took several deep breaths, and reexamined her surroundings.\n\nThe camp was gone. The guards were gone. She was here. Nobody here wanted to harm her. Slowly but surely, the nightmare she had been having began to fade. It would return, if not the next night, then another, but for now she could feel safe. Successfully back in the present, Aliya began to return to where she was meant to sleep, but as soon as she took a step forward she realized something. Others in the room were groaning, tossing, and turning in their sleep, helpless against unseen terrors. Nightmares of the camps plagued them, just as they did her.

"As ready as I'll ever be. And you?"\n\nMurtaza chuckled, but there was no humor in it. "I'm more ready for them than they are for me. Bastards won't even know what hit them." Without another word, Rustem pulled the bag onto his back, the handle going over his shoulder. And like that, the pair of Bashkir brothers left their native village, setting out into the wastes. Nobody waved or said goodbye to them - who was left to do so? Nobody remained there save world-weary men who felt much older than they were, and tired women who just wanted to live normal lives again. Even so, there was no such thing as a normal life in their homeland anymore. Not after the thrice-damned Shturmoviki had slaughtered their way through their people, placing them in camps and treating them like rats needing extermination. Not after the once-beautiful land they called home lay ruined, poisoned by countless toxic chemicals. Their people could try to rebuild all they wanted in this new state just for them, but Rustem and Murtaza knew that there was no going back now. Especially not for them, having lost all friends and family except each other. They could not bear to see the remains, and that had ignited a flame within them; one which would not stop burning until it reduced every last remaining Shturmoviki to ash."

It was an ugly thing, only good for killing. When it wasn't killing, it was just a useless, impotent hunk of steel. Useless. Impotent. Useless...\n\n"Commander Evtukhovich, did you hear me?" one of the men assembled behind him spoke. "I asked what our new orders were, now that we've lost touch with the capital."\n\nOne of Yuri's eyes twitched. He spun around, and before he could even recognize the man who'd spoken he raised the pistol and fired. The officer cried out as he crumpled to the dirt. His comrades let out shouts of fear and dove out of the way, but Yuri couldn't have cared less about them. He fired again and again at the man on the ground, emptying the clip into his gut, his chest, his head.\n\nYuri threw the pistol aside and knelt down to look at the corpse. From what was left of the face he could tell it was Fedorov. He'd always been a good officer. Ruthless, efficient; untroubled by false morality. Yuri would never have guessed he was such a treasonous lizard, but here he was.\n\nHe stood up and looked at the other Shturmoviki officers cowering in the mud, waiting for his next move. His eyes passed over each of them one by one.\n\n"How fucking dare you," he rasped. "New orders? Why the fuck would we need new orders? The regent's order still stands! Why would it have been rescinded? It is our order to cleanse these mountains of every last goddamn subhuman rodent hiding in them, and that order will stand until we hear otherwise. Is that absolutely clear?"\n\nThe officers all nodded, too afraid to speak. Yuri picked up the pistol and inserted a fresh clip into it. In a certain light it had a sort of brutal beauty to it.

They were too skinny. Even the Shturmoviki, entitled to better treatment than the common soldiers, looked like walking corpses in their dark uniforms. Exhaustion hung thick in the air. They all knew the end was coming. They were here to find out what form it would take.\n\nAt the front of the square, a stage had been assembled. A single figure now climbed atop it, and the murmuring crowd fell silent. Yuri Evtukhovich, commander of the imperial forces in the region, looked out over his legion. As his eyes passed over Alexander's section of the crowd, Alexander flinched. Evtukhovich raised the bullhorn he held, and began.\n\n"Guardsmen, it has been brought to my attention that there are disloyal elements among our number. These godless traitors have questioned the authority of the Regent, and through him the authority of the Tsarevich and God almighty. The heretics have been disposed of, but I feel compelled to remind you of your oaths, and the punishment for breaking them. You are sworn to obey all orders without question. Without. Question. Compliance is not enough. To doubt your orders is to doubt God. To doubt the Regent."\n\nThe commander paused for a moment to pull out a piece of paper before resuming. "Our last order was to 'secure the Urals in the name of the Tsarevich.' If we have not received new orders, it is because the Urals are not yet secure. The inhuman Jews and their Tatar dogs still infest this land. Our task is not complete, and we cannot rest until it is! Men of the Imperial Guard, are you prepared to see your orders through? Are you ready to die and to kill without hesitation in the purification of your holy motherland?"\n\nThere was a roar of approval from the crowd. A cacophony of applause drowned out everything else. Alexander joined in. The soldiers around him were whooping and screaming with joy, but behind their eyes he could see the same feeling running through himself."

This was worse than combat. At least in combat he could fight back. Here his only option was to run as fast as he could. He was close, but there couldn't be much time left. He'd passed the nine kilometer mark, and the desiccated trees were already starting to thin out as he neared the edge of the forest, but they'd only been given forty-five minutes.\n\nTen kilometers in forty-five minutes. Three quarters of an hour to run a path straight through a forest the artillery corps used for target practice. The starting pistol fired at 11, and at 11:45 the trucks waiting on the other side of the woods would depart, bringing anyone who was finished by then with them. At 11:46 the shells would start falling. The gunners were practicing with mustard gas today. Konstantin hadn't believed it at first. It was a scare tactic to motivate them to go faster, or weed out anyone that didn't have the guts to be in the Shturmoviki. He'd been dispelled of that notion as soon as he got a good look at the forest.\n\nHis legs pumped faster, summoning a final reserve of strength he didn't know he'd had. The burned, rotting hulks of trees became a blur as he flew past them. He hurdled over a fetid pool of water with an unidentifiable corpse floating in it in a single leap. He rounded a corner and beheld the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. The edge of the trail, and there, a few meters further, five idling trucks with a few guards standing around them. He launched himself forwards and barreled out of the forest at last. The guards guffawed as he staggered to a stop.\n\n"That's forty-five. Looks like he's the last one," the sergeant said as Konstantin climbed into the back of one of the trucks, taking a seat next to the few other soldiers who'd finished ahead of him. The trucks lurched into motion and started pulling away. He heard the gurgling sound of gas shells passing overhead, and the crumping sounds of them impacting behind him. He saw a golden fog start to creep out of the receding trees."

There were twenty-three in total, and behind them over a hundred humanoid mongrels and traitorous deserters had taken shelter from his men. Reconnaissance reported that they had been heavily armed and alert, and would have been a difficult target for the infantry to hit. Luckily, there was no need to send in the troops; the Imperial Guard still had plenty of toys stowed away. It didn't have to spend lives attacking these rodents in their burrow, not when a little white phosphorus would flush them out.\n\nThe stench of garlic that phosphorus attacks always brought still hung in the air, even hours later. As the commander of the Purification Zone stepped through the improvised wall of wagons, he got his first look at what his orders had wrought. Twisted corpses, scattered like dolls around the campsite. Some were splayed out, clawing at the poisoned earth. Others huddled around each other even in death, the last remains of the degenerate families that had tried to flee his army. All were covered in the same burns that white phosphorus left. Deep scorch marks covering the entire body, skin so charred it became brittle, paperlike. Evtukhovich felt nauseous. He hated garlic.\n\nHe was looking at the remains of what had once been a baby, cradled in its mothers arms, when he noticed one of the Shturmoviki officers approaching him. "We've rounded up the survivors sir, we're preparing to execute them now, with your permission."\n\nEvtukhovich paused for a moment, as though he were contemplating some profound statement, before speaking, "Hold off, for now. Bring them back to the camp with us so we can get some use out of them." The officer snapped a smart salute and departed. Evtukhovich turned back towards the body he'd been studying. It couldn't have been more than a year old. Such a little thing, and yet it had threatened everything he was fighting for, everything he loved. There was no other choice. There was no other choice."

If anyone asked him how he got here, he could not have told them. Life hadn't made sense for weeks, maybe years. He went where he was told to go, ate when and what he was told to eat, and killed whoever he was told to kill, knowing that if he said no, he was next. Nothing seemed connected any more, just moment after moment with no context but the dread he couldn't escape.\n\nThe rank in front of him came to a halt and Alexander did the same. Wherever they were going, they had arrived. At the front of the column he could see a gallows. There were around a dozen kneeling figures, hoods over their heads and nooses around their necks. In front of them, the commander was pacing back and forth as the Shturmoviki and the guardsmen assembled in perfect order. Around the soldiers a crowd of civilians had been assembled, brought to watch what Alexander now remembered was a victory parade.\n\nEvtukhovich raised his bullhorn and began shouting into it. "People of Holy Russia! You have been brought here today to see the face of the enemy! This is the enemy which infests our motherland, conspiring to pollute our blood and deny us our God. This is the enemy which the brave men of the Guard, the warriors of the Holy Regent and the blessed Tsarevich will purge from our country no matter the cost! Look at this vermin!"\n\nWith that he tore off the hood of one of the prisoners, revealing a Tatar woman gagged with a rough cord. Even from this distance, Alexander could see the burns that covered her face, hear the muffled screams and sobs coming from behind the gag. Evtukhovich went down the line, ripping off the sacks. Each time he did so a wave of jeers and shouts came from the crowd. Once they had all been unmasked, Evtukhovich gave the signal to the hangman and the trapdoor dropped. As the bodies twitched and jerked, he raised the bullhorn one more time, while the soldiers applauded."

 #The Revolutionary Communes of Orenburg
 after_midnight.96.t: "Grain and Steel"
 after_midnight.96.desc: "The Bolshevik coup in the Southern Urals had been weeks in the making. No sooner had the earliest rumors of Taboritsky's death reached Mikhail Pervukhin's hideout in the mountains, than he set about preparing for the expulsion of Orenburg's isolated garrison. When it came, it was but a mere formality, with the imperials scattering at the first sight of an organized attack.\n\nGeneral Secretary Pervukhin, henceforth the competent authority in the areas which long ago had belonged to the eponymous anarchist council, quickly endeared himself to the local population by overseeing the liquidation of Taboritsky's regional kapos. He knew well enough, however, that the task of government would be far more unpleasant. Imperial rule had been particularly unkind to the Southern Urals: the fields which were not merely fallow lay poisoned, the factories that had not been entirely stripped had suffered some other form of ruination, internal commerce was nonexistent, an effective bureaucracy had never existed in the first place... Pervukhin sighed.\n\nLooking up at the map of the Southern Urals kindly left at Government House by its deceased prior occupant, the general secretary grimaced. It was an almost ancient map by this stage, produced during the later-days of Soviet rule, as marked by the CCCP watermark on its legend. That in and of itself was a reminder of the achievements of Bolshevik civilization; what little remained of a functional society could be traced back to the achievements of the Union alone.\n\nPervukhin's mind harkened back to the days of 1918 and 1921. Was Russia then no less savaged by reaction than it was now? Did the Bolshevik spirit, incarnate in Lenin, Kaganovich, and Stalin, not suffice to overcome the penury of Russia's situation then? If those men had managed to thrust the vastness of the Motherland into modernity, then he could put the pseudo-Makhnoite peasantry of a few oblasts back on the right track. That feat could be accomplished only through the methods of his mentors.\n\nMaterial balance planning, democratic centralism, and a strong Red Army were the correct ways to run a state, whether the uppity muzhik liked it or not. For their part, the anarchists should be content that after the demonstrated failure of their fantasy government, he was benevolent enough to allow their existence to be reflected in the country's new name: 'Revolutionary Communes of Orenburg' did have a nice appeal to them after all, even if there were no communes."

 after_midnight.97.desc: "The dire situation in greater Orenburg had necessitated the revival of the term, 'Spetz,' now applicable to the large number of former Ural League officers in the service of the commune's Red Army. With political commissars by their side, a handful of poor rifle slavemen underneath, and their close relatives under Cheka watch, these men became Pervukhin's military backbone.\n\nApart from the few raids by Kazakh purifiers in the south, however, the Ural Red Army was often more preoccupied with the 'Internal Enemies of the Revolution' than those on the outside. Initially, this was taken to mean what few sympathizers the Taboritsky regime had had in Orenburg, or what few local bourgeois organized to resist the expropriation of their factories. Nowadays, however, the term invariably described the anarchist peasantry, which had taken offence not only to policies of the revolutionary government, but to the general secretary himself.\n\nFor his part, Captain Lukomsky did not much blame the peasants. No sooner had the red flags been raised over Orenburg, than particularly pervasive, sometimes even cartoonish, depictions of Mikhail Pervukhin - whether in print or stone - became a staple of life in the communes. The cause of this particular unrest was the replacement of a statue in memory of the Orenburg's Workers' Council, with one of Pervukhin, which depicted him standing right beside Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Lazar Kaganovich. Lukomsky thought it gross, and the peasants' distaste for it justified; but if his time in the Ural League's army had taught him anything, it was that orders were orders.\n\n"Fire." The three dozen Red Army men under his command opened up on the muzhik mob, as had by now become customary. The cold, miserable winter weather made the scene even more dreadful, as Lukomsky struggled to clear his nose while kicking away the bodies of anarchists which had fallen at the side of the statue they had attempted to topple. From the particular homes of the God-forsaken village, the political commissar and his chosen few brought back seized anarchist memorabilia to use as firewood. Black flags, deviationist literature, pornography. All these, it was decreed, should burn at the altar of the general secretary. And so they did."

This time, Red Russia would take no chances.\n\nThe muzhik anarchists had been too weak, or perhaps too high on the opiate of gospel, to do what was necessary. That was not so with the NKVD, whose list of clergymen - Taboritskyite or otherwise - had been steadily growing since the first few scraps of graffiti-penned kill lists redacted in the Bolsheviks' Ural hideouts.\n\nTo Vasily Alenxandrovich Petrov, the task was not particularly pleasant. Growing up during the first warlord era, religion had been present in his homestead: killing one's childhood is never easy. Nevertheless, the institution's collaboration with Taboritsky condemned it even in Petrov's eyes. And so, he led his dozen men into the temple, pushing away the few raggedly dressed priests who pleaded to prevent a ransacking.\n\n"If only they'd fought this hard against Taboritsky." Petrov's political officer let out a laugh as he demeaned a bearded man, clinging on to a Bible. Most of the company laughed - ever so uneasily - with him, as the butt of a Kalashnikov left the old man lying on the ground. The rest of the platoon, outside the church, fired off a warning shot at the local rabble, which had not taken long to notice what the bonfire was being set up for. While some, it should be said, were apathetic to the forcible seizure of holy books (as they were, by this point, to almost anything), the majority of people attempted some form of protest. Petrov had orders to deal with those by shooting, but he chose a more sensible approach. Not like their protestations would change anything, anyway."

Then, just as soon after he spoke, he heard the voice of Mikhail next to him, amidst the many other farmers nearby.\n\n"Irritated, are you now, Ilya?" He asked.

Ilya sighed, and he could feel Mikhail become a little annoyed. He was a determined Bolshevik, that much Ilya knew, and when he found some satisfaction under Bukharin, he hated the communes, and then welcomed Pervukhin.

Taboritsky's reign of terror had so thoroughly ransacked the Southern Urals that the construction of even such a basic industry became a groundbreaking event, worthy of celebration and a Red Army parade.\n\nThe general secretary was of course present for the opening of the M.G. Pervukhin Agricultural Tooling Factory, as were the People's Commissars for Foreign Affairs, Labor, Industry, and Agriculture. Pervukhin was not alone however, with the People's Commissars for Military Affairs, Communications, Justice, and Education, also in attendance. There were a few important military figures, alongside what few technicians were available, all there to celebrate this great achievement of reborn Russian socialism. One group who shined through their absence however, were the workers themselves.\n\nIndeed, all workers with the technical skill to operate industrial machinery were over the mountains and far away, busily toiling in the collectivized farms. The food situation in the cities was so dire that they could hardly be spared for industrial production, that would be double whammy at any rate. Thus, Secretary Pervukhin had devised a solution which would be beneficial to all:\n\nWhat few members of the deposed government had not been executed, alongside the detained anarchist intellectuals, and Kazakhs taken prisoners during frontier battles, all had long sat at Cheka camps consuming the proletariat's food. Now, however, they would have to provide redemptive labor for it, with reduced rations of course, only fair in the face of the worsening agricultural crisis.\n\nSurely, these actions might be retroactively considered excessive, but as far as Pervukhin was concerned, they were just and necessary. When Russia once more found itself united and prospering under the Red Banner, it would be this factory they could trace national redemption to."

The door ahead opened, blinding him with the orange light and heat of a thousand burning lanterns. There sat the high priest upon his gothic throne, peering down at Nikolay from behind his ram skull mask. Nikolay fell to his knees and touched his forehead to the hallowed ground. The robed men raised their lanterns, and in dry monotone chanted "Rege Satanas, Ave Satanas, Abaddon, dirige nos."\n\n"Rise, initiate" the high priest ordered. At once, Nikolay stood, locking eyes with the slender figure before him. His old commander was unrecognizable. The skin around his eyes was sullen, his gaze was dull, his expression hollow. The man who Nikolay once knew as Colonel Anatoly Motsny was nowhere to be seen, in his place only a soulless vessel sustained by dark sorcery - Abaddon, the archangel of destruction, the progeny of Cain.\n\nNikolay was silent, straining to disguise his growing terror, as the high priest rose from his throne and placed a dagger in his hand. Though his heart brimmed with fear and his soul cried in agony, he gripped it tightly. Nikolay slid the steel blade across his own chest, wincing as he tore a piece of flesh from his body. He clenched it in his fist, hesitating only for a moment before placing it onto his tongue. Abaddon held a silver chalice to Nikolay's chest, pressing it firmly against the wound. The blood thickened even as it rushed to fill the vessel. Nikolay grasped the chalice, putting it to his lips that he may receive the unholy communion. "Rege Satanas," Nikolay began, blood oozing across his torso and sliding down the back of his throat. "Ave Satanas, Abaddon, dirige nos."\n\nThe high priest slid a finger over Nikolay's bleeding chest and marked his forehead with the Petrine Cross. "Welcome, Initiate, to the Brotherhood of Cain.""

They promised to make the enemies of Russia suffer, promised him revenge against all who had wronged him. He was suspicious, but he was angry, he was uncertain, but he was hungry. And so Vladimir joined the Brotherhood of Cain. "Warriors!" cried his commander, on the eve of his first raid, "The true Lord calls your names. Revel in his glory!" His fellow soldiers practically jumped to their feet, cheering and laughing as they burst out the door, and Vladimir followed behind them.\n\nTobacco smoke filled his nostrils, terrified screams and celebratory laughter filled his ears. Drinks filled goblets and soldiers sang. The Warriors of Cain beat and whipped the assembled slaves, with no regard to their race or gender, every cry or scream became a prayer for the coming raid's success. They defiled holy icons with blood and piss, snuffed strange powders to summon strength for the battle, stripped each other naked, and screamed hymms to the morning star in bliss.\n\nVladimir's mind was flooded with memories of piety, how proud he was to be confirmed, his mother's tales of the ancient Hebrews. The hand of God reached down to Vladimir, he whose soul was still not corrupted, he whose mind was still bound by empathy. But the fires of temptation burned in his loins, the serpent's words coursed through his spirit. Why did God watch as his family was shot? Why did he do nothing as the Arch-Jew trampled Russia? Where was he when Moscow fell? Abaddon appeared beside him, the voice of Lucifer himself on his tongue. "Why are you not reveling, brother? Have you forgotten what Adonai has done? Have you forgotten our communion?"\n\nContempt boiled within him, years of prayer unanswered, decades of suffering uncompensated. He stared into the writhing mass of flesh and sin, his soul now resolute. He downed a goblet of wine, and grabbed the whip."

It was all he could scrounge without being spotted, all which he had to honor the Lord. The young priest wept, praying between each sniffle "I am sorry, God. I have tried to maintain my courage, to hold your blessings in my heart at all times, but I have failed. I am grateful for my life, eternally thankful for your blessings. But I am tired, I am weak, I am a coward and a sinner. I-I beg for your forgiveness. I am so, so sorry." Gennady stood and walked into his bedroom. He unholstered his pistol and prayed he would reunite with his wife in heaven.\n\nOksana held a bucket in her hand, carrying water so that her sickly mother would not have to. A headscarf wrapped around her, a plaid sarafan lay over her. She walked with her head down, and prayed that she could go home safely. But she felt the eyes of Lucifer's agents along her back and the grinding of wheels behind her. A truck stopped, a claw trapped her arm, the bucket spilled onto the dirt. She could smell the alcohol on their breath and sense the smiles behind their masks. They bound her with rope, stabbed a syringe into her arm, and threw her into the truck.\n\nValery's joints groaned, his rigid footsteps led him behind a line of emaciated bodies. Abaddon's riders led the men like cattle, shambling toward the quarry. Valery felt a pop in his knee, letting out a gasp as his legs collapsed beneath him. One rider lifted him by his hair, another smashed his nose with the stock of his rifle. He choked on phlegm and blood as they bludgeoned his body, too weak to do anything but wince as a bayonet penetrated his abdomen. The others could only continue their march, broken spirits deaf to the crushing of bone. As they labored without respite, they saw a cross erected at the entrance. Valery's ghoulish body bled from the punctures in his hands, feet, and belly. His head hung limp and he weakly squirmed. The last of his voice rattled in his throat, and his spirit separated from his body."

There lay a great circle filed with sticks and straw, demarcated by a ring of blood. Five stakes of pine were planted at its edges, and wooden spokes ran between them to form a pentagram raised two meters in the air. At its center stood the Son of God crucified in effigy, his body built from wood and rope, his head that of a pig wrapped in a crown of thorns.\n\nThe audience watched in silent apprehension as the masked men brought captives from the backs of carts. Thieves, captives taken on raids, rebellious slaves, worshippers of the Jew-God. Each had been stripped of their clothing, their hands tied behind their backs. The riders marched them into the circle, securing their hands to the spokes and leaving them hanging by their wrists. Some screamed, some cried, some wriggled feebly, and some quietly accepted their fates. Some townsfolk whimpered, some closed their eyes or diverted their vision. Mothers covered their children's mouths so that their wailing would not draw notice.\n\nFrom the assembled brothers stepped Abaddon in his ram-skull mask, carrying a trident in his left hand and a torch in his right. In an impassioned voice, booming that all may hear him, he began his prayer. "Oh Lucifer, oh Prince of Darkness! I consecrate you a most holy city, I offer you a temple upon the Earth! Lend your strength unto me, impart your blessings on the New Babylon! May you silence the foul agents of Jerusalem and take vengeance upon them! Oh Morning Star, may your glory be known by all peoples!" He kneeled before the straw circle, and through his torch he summoned the fury of Hell. Four dozen voices screamed in terror, their eyes wide as hell raced toward their bodies. Their hair withered, their skin blistered, their very tears were turned to steam. Agonized screams and mortified cries broiled into the surrounding air, a cacophony of suffering pointed at Adonai himself. Smoke billowed upwards, and Hell became manifest upon the Earth."

A blessing in disguise, it came to be, as the rare - yet haunting - news of the state of Russia at large came to their little community.\n\nA sense of simple, blissful ignorance settled in the recent years for them, a fear that, if any of them acknowledged what happened to the country at large, the miasma of death that became their motherland wouldn't reach their little, idyllic paradise.\n\nPeople would come from their less inconspicuous neighbors carrying scars, horror stories that the people of the village simply didn't want to hear anymore, until eventually nothing but blissful, welcoming silence came from the roads leading to them.\n\nNo news was good news, as far as the people of Karpova were aware. And as long as they simply paid no attention to anything outside their borders, besides the occasional pilot landing from this 'Free Army' to resupply and rest, they were sure that they would continue standing, living by the same tick of the clock, until the end of time."

Her mind wanders, momentarily, to the women before her that guided this plane, what would they think?\n\nAt that moment, she gripped the yoke harder, eyes daring to burn with unshed tears, as memories of friends gone flood her mind - and a single question, that she wouldn't ever entertain before, starts to worm its way into her consciousness.\n\nA certain noise breaks her from her stupor. Glancing to her left, distant dots are seen in the horizon, in a certain familiar, odious v-pattern. Target practice, just what she needed.\n\nHer mind instantly cast away all unnecessary clutter, hands automatically moving to well-familiar switches, as she leaned the plane down, picking up speed, to align her aim to the targets below; as the roar of her engine announced her presence, and the spit of her machine gun tore their helicopters to scrap, she couldn't help but smile and relish in the same feeling so many women shared in this selfsame cockpit."

The air howled, yet it didn't seem to diminish the fury of the man's voice, as he raised his voice again, motioning to the warehouse at their side.\n"We can't just shrug and offer the other cheek when those psychopaths kill our people and poison our land even more! Haven't we suffered enough under the Regent's insanity, now we have to just twiddle our thumbs and keep waiting until Melkikh finishes the bloody job?!"\n\nShe listened to him, as he, the leader of them all, screamed himself hoarse as his argument collapsed more and more into an irrational, hateful speech against everything that befell them; the Russians that put them into shackles, the empire that turned these shackles into a noose, and now the bandits that seek to give the final twist to break their neck. Finally, all the rage and vitriol spilled out of him, leaving what really was Alexander Zvyagin, for those close to him: a scared, tired, young idealist, in a land marred by justified cynicism.\n\n"We don't have the people, Alexander. Everyone is tired of fighting. We've fought for ten, long years, and what did we get from it? The land is even more broken than when I was up there, shooting at the Krauts myself. But you can't draw what simply is not there anymore. We can only endure-"\n\n"We will die."\n\nFor the first time in quite a while, Aglaya was shocked, staring at the broken person at her front; Alexander can't muster the energy to look at her in the face, pitifully looking at the ground beneath them as if it could give him any answer, any consolation, or any help at their situation.\n\n"We can't keep... hoping we can shoot them down forever. They'll... just keep chipping, more and more, until they reach Surgut. And then..."\n\nHis sentence was left unfinished, a grave silence stretching between both of them.

It glowed softly as Melkikh puffed on his cigarette, the smoke billowing from his nostrils as he exhaled. He watched the tendrils of gray nothing dance like ghosts in the cold Siberian air, and he smiled. Ghosts, Russia was full of them. But Melkikh was not one of them, and neither were his men.\n\nIf Melkikh could use one word to describe the Russian race, it would be 'survivors'. They had outlived the tsar, the Nazis, and now the Blessed Regent. He sneered, or at least one of the Blessed Regents. Larionov was making noise in Vyatka, screaming at Melkikh down the phone to organize his helicopters and planes in defense of the city. The commander of the Imperial Airborne Brigades knew an opportunity when he saw one, and Larionov's Frankensteinian state was not long for this world.\n\nOut here in the Siberian wastes, he alone commanded air power, he alone had the guns and guts to take what he wanted. Fuck the Regent, fuck the empire, Melkikh was king of the skies.\n\nOne by one, the blades of the helicopters began to spin, the engines humming as the raptors prepared for takeoff, and as Melkikh stood watching his warriors ascend into the air, a smile crept across his face."

In a sudden, terrible moment, everything was light, heat, and noise. Lidka didn't realize she was screaming until her throat was raw. Splinters, earth and flesh were rent and thrown wildly by the explosion, and Lidka felt a wave of heat throw her from her prone position into the air.\n\nShe landed on her back some yards away, the wind torn from her lungs. As she struggled to breathe, she watched as the death-machines wheeled overhead. What could they do? A few brave souls had fired their rifles at the planes to no avail, their bodies quickly turned into wet scraps at the next strafe.\n\nLidka tried to push herself back up, but her limbs were unresponsive. She struggled to lift her head, hair, blood, and sweat clinging to her face.\n\nWhat remained of her body was a horror, a mess of charred meat and splintered bone, another casualty of Melkikh's rage.

The gunner of Kolomnikov's chopper, a crazed, fearful expression on his face, pumped lead down on the gun emplacements, trying desperately to pick off the Black League defenders. Maybe if their guns could be neutralized - the gunner howled and careened back, clutching his face and screaming as blood gouted from his jaw.\n\nInstinctually, Kolomnikov leapt over the fallen gunner to take his place, gripping the machine gun in his sweaty hands.\n\nJust as he began to return fire down at the black garbed figures that guarded the concrete hellscape, and as casings pinged and rattled around his feet, Kolomnikov felt his mouth dry and his bowels turn to water as an AA gun turned towards his chopper.\n\nThe flak tore through the soft skin of the helicopter with ease, like a giant punching a fly. The cabin shook violently, and Kolomnikov was thrown from his feet as the chopper began its death spiral. In a swirl of sound and blurred colors, Kolomnikov was tossed around the cabin, only the grace of centripetal force keeping him inside the helicopter.\n\nThe howl of tortured metal and the kinetic scream of impact greeted Kolomnikov as his chariot met the rising earth, glass and wreckage showering him and those few who had survived the crash. Pain greeted Kolomnikov, searing, agonizing pain, as he struggled to right himself and extract his limp body from the wreckage. As he glanced out the crumpled door of the chopper, he felt as though he might cry. Rushing through the trench the chopper had fallen into were soldiers of the Black League, rifles at the ready.

Melkikh would not suffer the disobedience of Mother Nature, and no weather report would discourage him from taking what was rightfully his.\n\nThat had been weeks ago, and now the company that had embarked for a raid into Nenets territory was lost in perpetual white. Chopper pilots strained to see through the driving snow of the blizzard, holding their controls in white-knuckled death grips. None dared to turn back, for to return to the air marshal without loot was to face summary execution.\n\nThe wind and snow wreaked havoc on the blades, and the first chopper that was pushed down to earth by the hoary hand of Boreas landed with a dull crump. The distress of the stricken crew was heard over the radios of the squadron, who initially believed that the Nenets had acquired a rocket. As one chopper scrambled to face the nonexistent enemy, it blundered blindly into its brother, sending them both careening to the ground in a suddenly bright orange fireball.\n\nWhen the Nenets scouts found the wreckage, there was no sign of the crew save for the few corpses frozen solid by the icy winds of Siberia and the wolf tracks leading off into the forest."

There had to be at a dozen of them, all older Soviet planes, proudly emblazoned with the red star of the old Union. The fighters, long time heroes of Siberia, were unmistakable: the Free Aviators.\n\nHelicopters fired mounted machine guns fruitlessly at the passing fighters, the Free Aviators easily spinning to avoid the line of tracers. Melkikh's gunner was shoved off the gun by the air marshal himself, who grasped the machine gun and swung it towards his enemy. The gun shook, bright tracer rounds illuminating the night sky, seeking the death of the witches. A Soviet plane careened to the left as Melkikh riddled its left wing with bullets, smoke trailing from behind the stricken fighter. All around the aerial duelists, and explosions shook the sky as raiders and Free Aviators killed and died alike.\n\nAs choppers fell from the sky and bombers exploded midair, Melkikh felt his gun cough, the last of the casings clinking to the floor. "Fuck!" the Air Marshal shouted, dismounting the weapon. A cold sweat began to percolate on his brow as he slowly came to the realization that the fight was hopeless. "Pull back! Return to base!" screamed Melkikh down the radio. As one, the fleet turned to flee.\n\nThough they were harassed the whole way back, the Free Aviators peeled off shortly before the fleet touched down. Melkikh was incensed, coming off of his chopper ranting and raving. "I!" He screamed to raiders, "I alone am the master of Russia's skies! When this is finished, the Free Aviators will be forgotten!

He thought his luck was shifting when the Redeemed Black League sprung him from prison during the chaos of Regency's collapse. However, looking at what was supposed to be his 'training camp' he knew that thought to be foolish.\n\nHe recognized the people around him; they were fellow prisoners he knew from his time behind bars, murderers and thieves. They were surrounded by towering steel walls, with faceless guards manning the battlements staring right through each and every 'recruit', waiting for them to step even an inch out of line. Their 'barracks' was a crowded tent filled with lumpy beds that lacked pillows or blankets. There was no place for any of them to store personal possessions or even spare sets of clothes. They were expected to wear the one uniform they were granted at all times, a constant reminder of who they were supposed to be.\n\nThere was not enough of anything to go around. Not enough equipment, not enough beds, not enough food. They were expected to fight for their right to live, for the "redemption" that they were offered from this new Black League. So that is what they did, each and every recruit fought for every scrap of food that they could, while the masked guards on the walls watched them, assessing them all.\n\nAs time went on they were privileged to be visited by a small team of drill sergeants. These men would begin the arduous process of taming the wild animals that they had created. Week by week, drill by drill, the recruits were trained.

To achieve this he and his staff had put together the Militarized Village Program, an initiative to concentrate the Black League's population into easy to defend strongholds and fortify them to withstand any enemy incursion.\n\nHe and the rest of the Black League knew that these people would resist being relocated, weakened by sentimentality and a poorly placed pride in their heritage. This mattered not to Lazarenko or his staff. These people were not true members of the Black League, instead they were mere pawns to be used in the furthering of the Black League's interests. They would be relocated at gunpoint regardless of their wishes, anyone who resisted would be shot without warning.\n\nConcentrating everybody into these strongholds also possessed another upside for the Black League. These peasants would be easy to survey and control. Under the watchful eye of the Black League, Lazarenko could make sure that these peasants served their purpose in the Great Trial. They would provide their labor, their minds, their possessions, and their lives, all in an effort towards the League's greater goal.\n\nIt was the duty of Lazarenko and the Redeemed Black League to save Russia from itself. The reason she had failed in all of the prior trials was due to her unruly and savage people. Yazov's great failing was his inability to see this immutable truth.

Some of them starved to death, unable to fight for their right to eat, others had died from diseases due to the increasingly filthy nature of the camp. The rest had been killed, either by the guards or their fellow recruits.\n\nThose who remained had changed from their time spent within the camp. They had become more violent, acting almost like rabid beasts rather than human beings. Altercations over food or equipment escalated from fist fights into brutal life or death combat. Everybody fought like they like their life depended on it because they all knew that it did. In this place Viktor had no friends, just rivals for survival.\n\nOnce a week, members of the Black League visited to check up on the progress of their recruits and to provide combat training. These were the only men the recruits truly feared. Anything that could be considered a slight towards a ranking officer was punished severely. A week in solitary for minor offenses, and death for major offenses. Like rabid dogs wearing shock collars, the only thing these recruits truly feared was their masters.\n\nDuring his time at the camp, Viktor learned every way he could possibly kill a person. Through instruction from the Black League and his own personal experience fighting for his life he had been made into a skilled killer.

Their sworn enemy was no longer the Germanic Teutons - instead they found their enemy in the very people of Russia. They blamed their fellow Russians for their failures to defeat Germany, time and time again. The result was a regime that did not even see their citizens as people, instead they were resources to use in raising future generations of Black League zealots.\n\nThe streets of Yekaterinburg were lined with men of the Internal Security Directorate. Their faces were covered with gas masks and their arms carried assault rifles. They watched the city's residents, punishing even the most minor of transgressions with extreme cruelty. At night, the men of the ISD raid the homes of everyday citizens, taking any form of personal possession forbidden by the Black League.

Her thoughts were interrupted as a stray bullet emerged from her window, grazing her shoulder. Backing away from the window she knew she had to escape. Rushing to a small shack near her house, another stray bullet grazed her leg. It took all her willpower to not draw attention to herself by screaming.\n\nThese 'soldiers' fought more like rabid animals than human beings. Their rifles were all mismatched, afixed with sharpened scraps of metal to serve as makeshift bayonets. As they ran out of ammo in their weapons, rather than reload most of them just dropped their weapons and began to kill people with their own hands or knives. The men of the Black League spared nobody, not even the children.\n\nThe brutality they unleashed upon this small village was almost puzzling. Katerina had seen her village suffer raids many times before, but those men were sadistic, they engaged in cruelty for their own enjoyment. These men however, did not seem to enjoy any of the horrors they were unleashing upon her people. In fact, in the brief glimpses she got of their faces, they didn't seem to feel anything at all. They showed zero emotion as they mercilessly slaughtered this village. Not enjoyment nor regret, not pleasure nor pain. It was as if they were not even present anymore.\n\nStill in the small shack and fearing for her life, Katerina waited for all of the 'soldiers' around her to be occupied. It pained her to use the suffering and deaths of people she once thought of as friends to escape this, but she had no other option. When she thought an opportunity presented itself she bolted from the shack heading east. Unfortunately for her, someone had taken notice. She tried to run as fast as she could, but her leg was still bleeding. It didn't take long for the man behind her to catch up."

 ## Kazakh Purification Army

 after_midnight.122.t: "Kazakh Dawn"
 after_midnight.122.desc: "The end of days. That's how it looked like to a young Shturmoviki stuck in the Kazakh plains around Aktau, the scorching sun beating down on him as he tried to fiddle with a shoddy radio. It had been days since his comrades had ceased to answer his calls, and God knows how long since the Regent had returned to him. He was alone, in a land far different from the Siberian village he grew up in, and filled with subhumans he'd swore to purify in the name of the Holy Russian Empire.\n\nYet in spite of being seemingly stranded in a forsaken land, he kept hoping that he'd hear anything on his radio, anything that would give him some semblance of hope. And for a second, it seemed as if his hopes were coming true as the radio picked up a signal: "To all the Russian dogs still defiling these lands, the time of retribution has come for you. The crimes committed by the Mad Regent and his rabid dogs shall be avenged: for every slight committed against the Kazakh people, it shall be punished tenfold. I, Safa Gaziz, Grand Marshal of the Purification Army make this promise. We will come for you, your wives and children, your precious homes and churches, and your beloved motherland. As you plundered our lands and smothered our blue sky into one as black as your heart, so shall we. The sons of Genghis and Tamerlane shall bring fear to Russia once more!"\n\nThe soldier felt disgust, as well as amazement that a Kazakh would even be able to handle any kind of technology. But most of all he felt despair as the prospect of rescue seemed dim, and out of this feeling of despair, fear grew in his heart as he clutched ever so tightly to his rifle."

No more.\n\nDays ago, the inhabitants of this small Russian enclave on the banks of the Aral Sea were warned by our leader that the day of retribution would come for them, yet they stayed here, probably thinking that we were but jumped-up thieves. This would be a costly mistake, and their last at that.\n\nIn an instant, our warriors swooped in the village, lording of the Slavic scum as they gunned them down with no distinction, exulting in making them pay for the crimes done under the centuries old Russian yoke. As their houses burned and their neighbors laid dead, the remaining villagers tried fleeing to the sea in a last ditch effort to save their pathetic lives.\n\nA futile effort. From the banks of the sea, the soldiers of the KPA would gun them down as they stood on top of their horses. Soon, the freshwater of the Aral Sea would turn crimson red as bodies floated away before sinking. Once, our sky was blue as the Sky-Father intended: on this day, it shone like as bright as a ruby."

And Kazakhstan has plenty of black sheeps.\n\nFor centuries, the sons and daughters of the Sky-Father have been under the Russian yoke and many have been bewitched by the benefits brought from assisting them. Worse, some had even mingled with those devils, diluting the pure blood of the Kazakh population over time.\n\nA divided house now finds itself at a crossroad: should it find peace in letting old wounds be healed over time, leaving families reuniting despite differences? Or are some lines meant to not be crossed? Evidently, Gaziz had no want for peaceful reconciliation in his mind as he ordered "race traitors" to be purged.\n\nDay and night, the KPA soldiers took care of the question: they tortured and hanged those who fought under the USSR, leaving their corpses as warning at the entrances of Aktau. The women were first shamed by having their hair shaved, before being left to their fate in the harsh steppes under the blue sky of Central Asia."

Luckily, his village had been mostly spared the violence that had befallen his country after the collapse of the Russians that occupied the region. Since then the radio waves had been absent from the usual drivel the Russians spouted, denouncing the Jews, non-Aryans, and other groups that had drawn the hate of the Holy Russian Empire. Tuning into the most commonly used frequency for wide ranging broadcasts, and to his surprise found himself in the middle of a message.\n\n"And who is responsible for all this death and destruction? To find the answer to this comrades, you need not look at the banners of the degenerates and whores that occupied these lands for so many years. The Russians! These subhumans and those complacent with our oppression! The Uzbekis! The Iranians! The Tajiks! And why did they oppress us so? My comrades, the answer of course, is they were terrified of the demonstrable superiority of Kazakh blood! We are an ancient, noble people! Why, one must only look at the incredible achievements of our people throughout history-"\n\nThe speech was quickly silenced by Amir cutting off the power to radio. He was no fool. He had heard of these xenophobes, the Kazakh Purification Army is what they called themselves. But they were no different than the Russians before them. Frankly, Amir was sure that he could replace the references to Russians and Iranians with Jews and Tatars and it would sound just like a speech from the Holy Russian Empire.\n\nAmir decided it was time to finally retire the radio. There was nothing to gain from the word of his fellow man anymore."

Deciding it was safe, Alinur returned to where his horse was waiting and helped Khristina off the horse. They had been on the run from the KPA for a few weeks now, occasionally sleeping in anywhere they could, whether it be the basement of a sympathetic townsperson, or the cold forest floor, huddled together to conserve heat. Tonight it looks as if it would be the latter.\n\nAs they embraced each other near a small fire they had started, Alinur thought back to the night this journey began. Alinur had planned on laying low with Khristina and waiting out the collapse of the Holy Russian Empire until things returned to a sense of normalcy. However, that normalcy never came. Seemingly overnight, the Kazakh Purification Army swept through Western Kazakhstan, the news of their brutal treatment of the Russian population moving even faster. Quickly abandoning their plans, Alinur and Khristina scrambled to vacate their small village. After all, Khristina was a Russian, and even worse so, she was an Imperial Russian settler, sent over with her family. When the KPA marched into their village, burning down houses and dragging out the few other Russians residing there to be shot on the street, the couple realized that there was no time left. Taking only what they could carry, and stealing a horse left unattended, they escaped into the night, being pursued by the KPA.\n\nIf they had been caught that night... Alinur was suddenly pulled back to reality by the gentle sobs of Khristina. Embracing her tighter, Alinur stared into the crackling fire in front of them, steeling himself to face whatever was in their future."

But the people were not here today to mourn the destruction of their lands and families. The chemicals that had been lingering around the area of their old home had finally cleared, and the Kazakhs had returned to rebuild. They had brought with them foodstuffs, tools, and lumber.\n\nThe people had survived the simmering hatred of Holy Russia, and as the sun rose over the Aral Sea, they got to work."

For the first time in months, she felt like she could take a moment to just take a moment and breathe. The regime of the Mad Regent was gone. No Russians were coming to conquer them again. For so long, war had been a constant as they fought each other, only to weaken themselves when the Russians had invaded, enslaved, and slaughtered them. They had never both been unified or free before.\n\nNow... maybe that could change.\n\nThe remaining families and clans alive had managed to come together, resolving to settle on the Jaxartes and survive. Others had soon followed or had found them arriving from the east. What had once been a few dozen survivors had turned into hundreds. Tents had been erected, routines established, and slowly they had all begun to heal. There only remained the lingering question - What now?\n\nTheir homes were destroyed, their land poisoned, and their people slaughtered by the Russians, but they were now... free. No regents, tyrants, or dictators controlling them. The clan leaders had started speaking, talking about starting something new. A new Kazakhstan. Free. Independent. Whole. A new dawn from the nightmare they had emerged from.\n\nThere were still threats. Some of those who had come from the west had warned of Kazakhs who were led by butchers, who emulated the Mad Regent and his propensity to slaughter. However, Hanifa was surprisingly calm, as were many others. Those people were driven by rage and hate, much like the regency had been. It was unsustainable. And like the Holy Russian Empire, it would destroy itself in time.\n\nAnd when it did, a new, free Kazakhstan would rise."

Finally, she finished, and fired it. She was rewarded with the sight of an explosion a short distance away. She let out a sigh of relief, proud of herself for managing it in the live-fire exercise. A number of other explosions sounded as the other women in her unit did the same.\n\n"Again." Officer Rustemov ordered. He was an old veteran of the Kazakh Red Army, a man missing an eye and with a patchy beard. He had been heavily involved in drilling the militia units that had been formed in recent weeks. The genocidal men to their west, and the concern that what emerged from the remnants of Russia may attempt to reclaim Kazakhstan had driven the need to have a fighting force - even if it had to be built from the ground up.\n\nThere was no shortage of volunteers, and thanks to the amount of weapons and ordinance that had been left behind or abandoned by the Russians, they didn't have to worry about supplies. It wasn't enough for an army - but it was enough for them. She'd barely known how to fire a gun, but the vivid memories of the Russians invading, and being unable to fight back had instilled in her a desire to never be helpless again.\n\nIf there was ever another army that marched upon them, be they from the west or north, at least she'd die fighting back. Twilight turned the sky orange, and after a few more hours of drills, they were sufficiently tired. Rustemov ordered them to stop. "Drills are done for the day. Take a rest. You've earned it." Aida and the rest of the women smiled. Rustemov was tight-lipped with his compliments, so hearing one was gratifying.\n\n"Yes sir." She brought up a hand in a salute, echoed by the others, and turned to leave, chatting with each other, with rifles slung over their shoulders."

Hills roll in a similar writhing agony, scattered with shocks and scars of gaunt trees. Putrid air clouds the ground and clings tight to the direction of the wind.\n\nIf one were to continue their journey, they may find the remains of a granary, once home to vast quantities of golden wheat, its colour soft as summer sun, all carefully deposited by a farmer's toughened hands. A home would be close by, it would have been filled with all the things this farmer loved in this world. Now it too stands abandoned, inhabited by nothing but the same unrelenting, toxic atmosphere.\n\nFew refuges can be sustained; those that do cling to life in the carcasses of old towns, with supplies dwindling and fears rising. Many have instead come to embrace a nomadic life, reliving the customs of the past; with hardened skin they return to the earth, scraping away at whatever they can find. These people spend their days in shock, with nothing to sustain their future, but their nation prevails, as a dim spirit haunting its hollow land.\n\nThough the plagues brought in by the invaders tore their land apart, they managed to persist. Though their muscles ache and minds yearn to escape, they persist. In the death of the old a new life emerges, mirroring that which came long before, and so they shall persist. This land was not home to Kazakhs alone, even since before the recent vile deluge swept the ground bare, there had been Russians living alongside them. Though they may not have always been peaceful, they had grown accustomed to each other's existence.\n\nThe Russians had been as much victims of the indiscriminate carnage as the Kazakhs. They had been strune far across the steppes, cut-off from the past; all those who had survived at least. Loss was as arbitary throughout the survivors as the marauders from beyond the border had been. It was impossible to find a group that had not been."

Everyone had been strewn throughout the steppes, cut-off from the past and held hostage by the present - all those who had survived at least. These few were left were now subjugated by the terrible spectre of the future.\n\nSmall bands of refugees are all that remains of the Russian communities, they hobble across the landscape in the same way their Kazakh neighbours now do. However, their lives are plagued by a constant uncertainty, worse even than the Kazakhs. They can never tell where they will be welcome, or if another band mistakes them as an enemy. The relentless anxiety of the land hounds them.\n\nWith little left to choose, one by one, they settle down in attempts to live off the land. Their new way of life, melting into the pastoralist culture of the Kazakhs. Soon the ways of these two people will be indistinguishable, and through this, in spite of all they have endured, they will live on."

Within the cities of Perm and Zlatoust and all the outlying towns and villages, however, there was only silence. It was a melancholy silence, one that had been born of the terror of the Mad Regent's regime. Where once the people of these lands had held hope within their hearts, now there was nothing but a silent resolve.\n\nIn the small town of Mezhgorye, Hadji-Umar Mamsurov stood before a small crowd of former Ural Guard, NKVD, and 3rd Army soldiers along with many natives of the region around Mount Yamantau. He was here to be sworn in as the first President of the newly formed Trans-Ural Confederation. To his left, his adjutant gave him a thumbs up. Within the lands under the tentative control of the confederation, the masses huddled around old radios to hear their leader's speech.\n\nThe old soldier steadied himself before beginning his speech. "I have never been one for speeches, so I will try to keep this brief," he began. "It has been only scant months since the unification of Russia under the boot of the Mad Regent, yet in that time his dogs have brought untold ruin to the people of Russia. Thousands slaughtered in this mad quest for a dead child. Now, he is dead, and the long road to recovery has begun. I stand here today, not simply as your leader, no. I stand here as merely a man, chosen to lead you through the night and into a better dawn," he stopped there and weighed his next words carefully. When next he spoke he swore an oath, before God and the people of the confederation, that unknowingly mirrored one made by the founder of the Ural League years before him.\n\nHe pledged an oath of servitude to the people and spoke with passion in his heart that he would fight to his dying breath to protect them. This oath would be sworn by every one of his successors until the day finally came for the confederation to end, for better or worse."

But these men were not mere refugees. They had a purpose. A goal. One driven by faith and gratitude for and towards one whom they all considered the greatest man any ever met.\n\nThat man was Jānis Mendriks.\n\nTo him, all of them, whether Balt or Pole or any other, had been first and foremost a victim of the Soviet state's infamous gulags. They all remembered well the hardship, the senseless violence, the deprivation and, above all, the hopelessness felt when shackled within them. In the fall of the state to the Germans, however, they had gained their freedom. Something they, at that point and little better than animals themselves, had little use for. They all knew how close they had been to the edge.\n\nUntil Mendriks had shown them a better way. Shown them that they could co-operate and fight to protect God's children, and in so doing save themselves from darkness. Through their years fighting with the Ural League, they had all seen ample evidence of that darkness, indeed. Even so, none of them had been prepared for the horror that was Taboritsky's Russia.\n\nBut, using the principles Mendriks had imparted to them, they had all survived by helping and fighting for each other. But they had needed a mission. A purpose. And they had found it. They intended to travel to Rome. It would be a long and difficult journey through inhospitable terrain and dangerously unstable statelets across the ideological spectrum. But they would do it, or die trying.\n\nFor they all knew, in their heart of hearts, that Mendriks was truly a saint. It only needed to be made official. They would ensure it was."

However, they were surrounded and picked off by bastard Ural Guardsmen and some remnant of Batov's lot. Now he sat, beaten and bruised by his captors, as some mongrel whore read off a list of his so-called crimes.\n\nHadji-Umar Mamsurov presided over the first of many trials that would set an important precedent for the future of the confederation. When the bastard Colonel Bolsunov had been dragged before him he had been ever so tempted to simply have the man executed out of hand. He had been personally responsible for the deaths of thousands of Russian citizens since he joined the Shturmoviki and Mamsurov would have liked nothing more than to put a bullet into him himself. But that wasn't the right course of action, and so he had authorized military trials for Bolsunov and those of his men that survived the fighting outside Perm. Of course, for all that this was a legitimate trial, the verdict was never in question.\n\n"Roman Ulyanovich Bolsunov, you have been brought before this tribunal to answer for your crimes against the people of Russia. You stand accused of treason, murder, extortion, and the use of poison gas on civilian populations. How do you plead?"\n\n"I admit to no crime! This trial is a farce, controlled by Jews and mongrels!

The door closed behind Mamsurov, and he regarded the weathered figure who once owned this land like it was his mansion.\n\n"Mikhail Kalashnikov," Mamsurov began, and the man wearily raised his head in acknowledgement. Kalashnikov was not as Mamsurov had seen in so many reels of footage, so many pictures of parades and factories. To say he'd lost weight was an understatement - his cheekbones jutted from his face, highlighting his sunken eyes, and his winter jacket loosely hung from his hunched form. A scar dragged itself across his cheek, trailing off at his jawline, making Mamsurov wince on instinct. "I wish we could have met under better circumstances."\n\n"I do too, comrade." Kalashnikov's voice was low and quiet, and a silence hung in the air as both men considered their next words. "I suppose this... is not just a friendly meeting."\n\n"I'm afraid not." Mamsurov pulled an envelope from his pocket. "Our engineers could use training from a designer with your level of skill - Lord knows we need the weaponry, with the madmen we call our neighbors. Payment will be-"\n\n"Payment?" Kalashnikov looked up with the most force Mamsurov had seen out of the man so far. "You think I still care about payment? Look at me. Look at my-" He raised his right hand, showing the stumps of what were once fingers. "I'm old. I'm... dying. I couldn't give less of a shit about payment. The least I can do is teach those to come after me how to build a rifle." He paused, taking a deep, rattling breath.

The Yasha of old wouldn't ever sacrifice anything for anyone, but Yasha remembers vividly and proudly the memories of hastily assembling sandbags on an abandoned house, the faint memories of Dirlewanger's pillagers' cars roaring in the distance... Success was hard on and almost made up the loss of part of his ear to a stray shot that day...\n\nThen, the dammable Regent, and his twisted corpse of an empire came...\n\nThey've tried their best. They, really, really did. Yasha pushes his wheelchair, one of the wheels slightly rusty, and harder to push than the other, and one of the tires clearly empty, and yet was nothing short of a commodity around these parts. Half of his face is permanently paralyzed, making it fairly awkward to breathe with only one active nostril; his legs are gone, replaced by wooden pegs, and burns across his body, Yasha looks much older than any forty-odd year veteran has any right to be.\n\nYet he's alive. And as he lowers a wreath with his good arm, surrounded by veterans like him, covered in their war tales, he can't help but cry, as the memories flood the young, yet aged soul. The statue is a recent thing, built from remaining rubble, the fruit of a surviving sculptor, fled from the harrowing shadow that befell what remained of his home in Yekaterinburg, depict a man he never met, but heard tales from other veterans, and came to admire as much as he did Mendriks himself; Pavel Batov, cradling a dying Ural Guard soldier, a scene he came to see so many times...\n\nWith immense effort, he did one shaky salute, to the patriot he never met, but felt he knew for ages."

Through the full-length window which replaced one of the walls of his office, countless dots of sparkling and shining lights contrasted against the pitch-dark and onyx-black tapestry of space. Even in the unending nightmare which was now Russia, some things - like the enigmatic sky - would always stay constant.\n\nWhere the factories and apartment blocks littering the Siberian municipality would once years ago shine with industrial floodlights late into the darkest hours of the night, there was now utter darkness. That nighttime glow and buzz was what had previously eclipsed the stars above; it was only with their extinguishing that he could see their radiance. The city, and purportedly many others, had been cut off from the power grid for weeks as the nation fell into utter chaos. Hunger and poverty was everywhere - even more so than under that madman Taboritsky's empire, and there was not enough food or even water to go around. Would Chelyabinsk or Russia ever heal from the three injuries she had been afflicted with - the two Great Patriotic Wars and now the lunatic's rule?\n\nYet, in spite of the crushing sorrow and despair all around him, Kardashev stayed hopeful. Like the stars he glimpsed, there were those things which would be eternal and unchanging. The days of dictators and tyrants, of Taboritskys and Hitlers, would eventually pass with time, and Russia would rebuild what was left of herself. They always did, and they will again. Through it all, it would be science - knowledge, enlightenment, and all the good virtues of truth - which would prevail without fail. Its survival here in Chelyabinsk was the strongest proof he could've asked for. He merely hoped his own efforts would not be wasted."

Where are they being kept?"\n\n"We don't have enough data on that either."\n\nKardashev's head throbbed with a migraine as he considered the information his ministers had presented to him - or, more aptly, the absence of information which they had informed him of.\n\nHe knew that the path to building a utopia would be a rocky one - one filled with countless obstacles and hurdles, and whose diverging paths would be fogged and unclear - but there would at least be some direction to his labors. Without any solid information of what was actually going on in Chelyabinsk, even how the road should begin was unknown.\n\nKardashev, after all, was devoted to science - he was a career physicist - and what did science value most? Data. Without it, what could he and his ministers know for certain? Without it, how could even the most simple jobs be performed optimally? How could he know whether their policies were actually working as intended or delivering results?\n\nHe dismissed the council, telling them once more to brainstorm ways to accrue data, and reminding them of the importance of the first task of the Institute. Yet, in everyone's minds there, dread had settled - dread of not being able to live up to their dreams, of failing to make something better out of the ruins of old Russia, and of leaving the sick and the tired to their damned fates."

Amongst those assembled were formerly seasoned politicians and officials from the local government of Chelyabinsk prior to the conquest of West Siberia, the handful of competent bureaucrats and administrators still left in the area, and Kardashev's kindred scientists and experts.\n\nThe debate would begin with the hunger crisis. With the black void of data they had, it was difficult to properly formulate a response; no one really knew what the people were going through, how severe the shortages were, or how many were affected by them. The conclusion of the conference was that the crisis was very severe if only taking into account official importation of food as reported at the border, but was realistically less severe, a statement which in no way could give any information on the actual availability of food for the average citizen.\n\nThen there was the matter of allocating other resources - goods not required for survival but greatly important to the functioning of modern society such as gas for heating and electricity. Those needs, however, came not just from the citizens, but also from industry and commercial entities, as well as the government. How were they to be distributed? Again, lack of information was a critical issue, as the committee didn't know what areas were most severely lacking in said resources nor agreed on what needed it most. For instance, Kardashev's scientist clique were fond of using calculations and planning to allocate resources to the mathematically most important channels - for instance, industry for production of other important goods, perhaps at the expense of the commercial sector or some parts of the population.\n\nIn the end, the conference only solidified the need for a thorough census and survey to gather information, resulting in little actual change in policy or opinion amongst the governing committee of the Institute."

They promised to rebuild the city, to provide for its people, and to establish a new society - and who could disagree with that, after years of suffering and anguish?\n\nYet, it was too good to be true. His initial impression of the scientist clique being elitist and aloof turned out to be correct - it had been months since they took over the city, but basic access to food and water was still rare in his neighborhood, while officials proclaimed that progress was being made and spouted on and on the same rubbish about sacrifice. If any change was happening, he definitely wasn't seeing it.\n\n"Give us bread!"\n\nCertainly, neither were the thousands who were marching with him in protest to petition the government to allocate more food, medicine, and gas to the needy. He was one of the luckier ones - he wasn't malnourished or ill as many others in the crowd were, but he had seen his neighbors and relatives struggle to get by. That was why he'd chosen to take action and join the protest, organized by workers who had been disgruntled with shortage after shortage. He had had his own fair share of starvation during the reign of Taboritsky, and had only recently been able to have real meals again. Others had not been so fortunate, and their pain had not been soothed by Kardashev's taking power."

 after_midnight.141.t: "Fatal Error"
 after_midnight.141.desc: "Forcefully opening the door to the cabinet room, Kardashev was greeted by his knights of the round table - his ministers and advisors. Taking his seat at the front, one member, in charge of security for the Institute, cleared his throat. "So, Comrade Kardashev, I assume you have called us here for..." he waved his hand at the window, gesturing vaguely at the masses outside. "...for that."\n\n"Yes, yes. What's all the commotion about? They've gotten far more militant today, and my secretary told me they tried to break in."\n\nAn awkward silence cast itself across the room. The security minister finally piped up after several long moments. "It has to do with last night." He nodded at the other two representatives of the security forces in the room. "To give you the long and short of it, amidst the tensions in the protests yesterday, a few of our men got spooked and opened live fire. Six confirmed dead as of right now, and three others severely injured as a direct or indirect result of their actions."\n\nThe room was silent, stunned for a moment, before it broke out into frenzied discussion in whispers between members next to each other. One advisor, an esteemed scientist, spoke up, his face blanched\n\n"This will be a PR disaster for us, Comrade Kardashev, if what Smolyakov is saying is true."\n\n"PR disaster? Are you hearing yourself? We have the blood of six people on our hands!"\n\n"I understand that it is a tragedy, comrade, but we must-"\n\n"But what?! Can you think of anything other than our reputation or control for once?" He raged. "The point of the Institute was to help the people, to build a society based not only on material truth but on the needs of the many. But if this is how we're treating our citizens, I don't see how we can live up to that!""

 ### Helper Events
 after_midnight_helper.1.t: "Kamchatka Goes Dark" 
 after_midnight_helper.1.d: "Concerning news reaches us this otherwise blessed afternoon from the Far Eastern fringes of the empire, and we aren't entirely sure what to make of it.\n\nOur loyal governors in Chukotka and the Kamchatka Peninsula have, throughout this period of renewed crisis, consistently sent messages reporting on their current status via the radio station in Petropavlovsk, straight to our central communications. Today, however, the messages have stopped entirely, causing some concern amongst our general staff.\n\nThis abrupt cessation of vital status reports could have resulted from any number of reasons, of course. Petropavlovsk is, after all, one of the most far flung towns under the Tsar's holy protection. Some have argued that this is merely a result of a technical failure on their end, while others present disturbingly plausible theories of Judeo-Masonic sabotage.\n\nWe can only hope that it is not the latter."
 after_midnight_helper.1.a: "Technical difficulties, nothing more."
 
 after_midnight_helper.2.t: "Silence From the Zone"
 after_midnight_helper.2.d: "The Siberian Purification Zone, the largest and most operationally successful of its kind, has ceased to respond to our communications.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the radio messages relayed to us from our units deployed to the zone to cleanse Russia of the subhuman infestation had grown increasingly scattered and unintelligible. From what we could discern from the confused and garbled reports, our forces suffered widespread mutinies and devastating attacks from unidentified, exceptionally well-armed bandit groups.\n\nWhile this does not exactly paint a clear picture of what has happened, it does indicate that order is rapidly breaking down across the Far East. Unfortunately, it seems our previous fears of Zionist plots to undermine our divine authority were indeed well-founded. With the Imperial Army spread thin, we are unable to spare any units to investigate, and can only pray to the Lord above that the zone is able to restabilize."
 after_midnight_helper.2.a: "They will endure."

 after_midnight_helper.3.t: "Nightfall in the Far East"
 after_midnight_helper.3.d: "According to panicked transmissions from the ruins of Irkutsk, the situation in the Far East is deteriorating rapidly.\n\nIn the early hours of the dawn, a frantic message urgently requesting reinforcements reached Imperial Army units stationed in Central Siberia from the local garrison commander of Irkutsk, claiming that a horde of subhuman insurgents were overrunning the city.\n\nHe went on to describe that these rebels had declared a "divine mandate" somewhere within the region, but the commander was unable to finish his transmission before the line was abruptly cut. We can only assume the worst, as no further contact was received from Irkutsk, or anywhere else in the Far East.\n\nWhile we have little information on these rebels, or their motivations, we can only assume that this is related to the unholy deception that had befallen the region earlier. With our units paralyzed by the disappearance of the Blessed Regent, we are in no position to restore order, and the Far East is lost.\n\nHis loyal servants join hands in prayer for the safety of the empire, for darker times may yet lie on the horizon."
 after_midnight_helper.3.a: "Everything is under control."

 after_midnight_helper.4.t: "Panic in the Wastes"
 after_midnight_helper.4.d: "Brothers, servants of the Lord and His holy child, it appears as though the moment we had been dreading has come to pass.\n\nOur contact with the central region of Siberia has become more tenuous with each passing day, and it seems likely that the entire region is on the brink of a total blackout. It started subtly at first, with isolated patrols and garrisons going quiet with nary a peep as what to their status was. Then, the bases and military installations across the Siberian wastes began to fall silent as well.\n\nThis all came to a head a few days ago, in which we had received a final message from the regional commander before he too was consumed by the silence. He claimed that the few units still under his command were on a full retreat towards the few industrial centers that still remained untouched by our holy crusade against the Jew, and that the countryside had fallen into total anarchy.\n\nWith the apparent collapse of imperial law in Central Siberia, orders have gone out to our units east of the Urals to lock down their positions and prepare for the continued spread of disorder, but only God knows if they'll be able to stay true to the cause."
 after_midnight_helper.4.a: "The empire is eternal."

 after_midnight_helper.5.t: "The Fall of Central Asia"
 after_midnight_helper.5.d: "After lawlessness and disorder consumed Central Siberia, it was widely predicted that the Central Asian territories would be next. Unfortunately, this bleak picture of the future rang true.\n\nMuch like with Siberia, the silence crept in slowly at first. One-by-one our forward operating centers and strongholds across the territories ceased to report their status, the fog of war growing thicker by the passing week. Not too long ago, the last frantic cry for help reached our units in West Siberia, claiming that a massive, well-organized force of Kazakhs had routed the Imperial Army across the region and was threatening to overrun the last bastion of imperial control.\n\nThese subhuman devils apparently fought with an unprecedented level of brutality, and they had reportedly occupied wide swathes of Central Asia at blistering speeds. With communications severed completely, however, we have no way of confirming these reports for ourselves.\n\nLet us hope that this madness does not consume what remains of our holy empire..."
 after_midnight_helper.5.a: "The Lord stands with us. We shall overcome."

 after_midnight_helper.6.t: "Shadows over Omsk"
 after_midnight_helper.6.d: "The few lights still burning in West Siberia are going dark.\n\nIt started with the total loss of communication with the rural areas. While these regions had already been depopulated for quite some time, our soldiers had established several observation posts for the purpose of ensuring stability across every corner of the empire.\n\nEven as our outposts cut contact left and right, Omsk, as one of our main communication links with the rest of Siberia, remained functional for weeks. It was through them that we learned that this startling trend of radio silence had spread to the Urals, and it was hoped that the city would remain in contact for some time.\n\nEvery link we had with Omsk has been suddenly and abruptly cut.\n\nAs one of the few population centers left standing in West Siberia, this was a considerable cause for alarm. Local units still in contact with us have been deployed to investigate this strange turn of events, but so far none have reported back.\n\nWhat few units of ours that are still reporting in have been ordered to dig in and prepare for the worst."
 after_midnight_helper.6.a: "Please remain calm."

 after_midnight_helper.7.t: "Unrest in Yekaterinburg?"
 after_midnight_helper.7.d: "Today was a rather hectic day for the central communication station in Vyatka.\n\nAfter a lull in further incidents regarding radio blackouts across West Siberia, it was assumed that perhaps the Lord had smiled upon us once again, and the situation was slowly beginning to stabilize. Unfortunately, while we still have no absolutely no doubts that Christ favors us, perhaps our assumptions about local operational security were perhaps a tad optimistic.\n\nWhat remains of the city of Yekaterinburg descended into what can only be described as a bout of mass hysteria as our receivers were absolutely inundated with frantic messages claiming that the city was under siege by unidentified hostile forces. These were followed by vastly contradictory messages relayed by a seemingly different person each time. Some would claim that the city was still firmly under control and nothing out of the ordinary was occurring, while others claimed that it had descended into a full-scale civil war between mutinous units, and nearly all of them contradicted the initial message about an impending attack from outside forces.\n\nThen, after hours of confusion and panic at the communications center, Yekaterinburg finally went dark. Not long after the total loss of contact with the city itself, similarly confused and contradictory messages began to flood in from areas all across the Urals. The latest message, an apparent call for reinforcements from an Imperial Army division retreating in entirely the wrong direction, was an appropriate final act to another region lost to anarchy."
 after_midnight_helper.7.a: "The situation will improve in time."

 after_midnight_helper.8.t: "The Siberian Anarchy"
 after_midnight_helper.8.d: "After Yekaterinburg was silenced, a similarly chaotic malaise had spread to the rest of the Urals, putting immense strain on the communications center in Vyatka and only further muddying the waters as to what kind of disaster was currently befalling the empire to the east. For the longest time, however, the occupied industrial sectors of Siberia held their ground. Continuing to send detailed status reports even as the darkness closed in around them, these fortified areas served as holy pillars of unity in these uncertain times.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems their time is up.\n\nNovosibirsk reported that the city had fallen and then was retaken five times before finally going completely silent. Units in the Kuznetsk Basin reported hostile elements were mounting a full-scale offensive, but never were able to elaborate before the line was cut. Chelyabinsk continued to claim everything was under control until contact was lost. Garbled reports from Tyumen were hard to discern, but we were able to understand that some kind of fire had overtaken the city ruins, and that the garrison was evacuating. Communications from Zlatoust remain open, but only faint music can be heard.\n\nAll of these incidents point towards a singular reality: Siberia, in its entirety, is lost. We now only have our sacred crownlands in the west to hold on to, and the remnants of the Imperial Army and the Shturmoviki are already reorganizing to prepare for whatever comes next.\n\nMay God deliver us from the machinations of the accursed Jew and their unholy master, and bring peace and order back to our empire."
 after_midnight_helper.8.a: "Our path is clear. Our triumph is assured. They will not break us."

 after_midnight_helper.9.t: "Into the Abyss"
 after_midnight_helper.9.d: "The unthinkable has happened. West Russia, the heartlands of our empire, has fallen into anarchy.\n\nIt began similarly to the tragedy that befell Siberia, with the countryside falling into the abyss in a massive wave of communications blackouts and unplanned radio silence. Then, the servants of Cain turned their attention to the population centers. City after city began to report all manner of civil disorder; from riots, to mutinies, to outright invasion. Our holy warriors, scattered and paralyzed by the tragedy that befell our Regent, were powerless to stop it.\n\nEven the brave Shturmoviki found themselves forced to retreat towards the last bastion of imperial authority: Vyatka. It is here where the loyal subjects of the blessed tsar prepare to make their last stand in the name of everything that is pure on this earth. The communications center in Vyatka now lies abandoned, with its operators bleeding off as more regions fell into chaos, but they are no longer necessary.\n\nOur enemy has us surrounded in the holy capital, and we will hold our ground no matter what the cost. Soon, our Blessed Regent will return, and we will march forth to reclaim every inch of ground that was lost."
 after_midnight_helper.9.a: "Our test has come. We shall fear no evil."

 after_midnight_helper.10.t: "Night Gathers"
 after_midnight_helper.10.d: "The empire is in crisis. From the Volga in the west to the frozen seas of the Far East, warlordism and anarchy have become the law of the land. We, the divinely-chosen servants of the Lord God and His blessed vicar on earth, Tsar Alexei, now stand with our backs against the wall. The forces of Satan and his Judeo-Masonic puppets plot just outside the embattled outskirts of Vyatka, and action must be taken to preserve what little remains of the renewed Russian state.\n\nViktor Larionov, one of the highest-ranking commanders in the service of His Imperial Majesty, has thus taken matters into his own hands. With the aid of the Shturmoviki, he has seized control of Vyatka and revealed the truth that was kept hidden from us the whole time: Sergey Taboritsky is dead.\n\nThis news comes as a shock to the empire's loyal subjects, but Larionov has cautioned that the time for mourning has long passed. A purge of those who were responsible in the conspiracy against Taboritsky's divine regime is now underway, and Larionov has already declared himself to be the late Regent's successor.\n\nWith only a few heavily depleted units of the Imperial Army still at his disposal, Blessed Regent Larionov's task is no doubt a colossal one. Nevertheless, we must endure if we wish to see Taboritsky's vision honored even after his death.\n\nWe shall continue to resist the impure for as long as we draw breath. For the Regent. For the tsar."
 after_midnight_helper.10.a: "The empire endures. We shall not fail."

 after_midnight_coup.1.t: "Purity Tests"
 after_midnight_coup.1.d: "Yakov Sharkov awoke with a start, throwing a bleary gaze around the room. What in the Devil was that noise? Staccato gunfire rang through the halls of the apartment bloc, and Sharkov felt his blood run cold as he realized he could hear heavy booted feet making their way towards his door. The aide to the minister of security leapt from his bed, nearly tangling himself in his sheets as he made his way to the front of his apartment. Did he remember to lock the door that night? What was going on? Who was shooting who?\n\nSharkov made it to the door just in time for the footfalls to stop right outside his door. He looked down at the bolt, and to his horror, saw that he had failed to slide it into place. A stupid, careless mistake that might cost him his life. Sharkov grabbed the knob so hard that his knuckles whitened, just as whoever was outside his door attempted to turn it.\n\nSweating with terror and with tears pooling in his eyes, Sharkov tried to hold the knob steady, but whoever was on the other side shoved against the door hard, sending the administrator sprawling to the ground. Shturmoviki entered the apartment, rifles held with a self-righteous swagger and eyes burning with dead light. One of the brutes leveled the barrel of a rifle at Sharkov's face and asked, "Who is the Blessed Regent?"\n\nSharkov blinked, "what?" The rifle inched closer, now directly between his eyes.\n\n"Who is the Blessed Regent?" the Shturmovik repeated, ice in his voice.\n\nSharkov, now having emptied his bladder in fear, managed to stammer out, "T-Taborit-" the gunshot blew blood, chunks of brain, skull fragments, and clumps of hair over the carpet, gruesomely peeling away the back of Sharkov's head. The Shturmoviki left the apartment without another word, proceeding to the next door on their list."
 after_midnight_coup.1.a: "No one would know the death toll of that fateful night."
 
 after_midnight_coup.2.t: "Loyalty Rewarded"
 after_midnight_coup.2.d: "Stepan Tsvetnov, naked and shivering, his emaciated body scarred by the innumerable tortures the Shturmoviki had inflicted on him, crowded into the gas chamber with the rest of the political prisoners. Stepan didn't even know what he had been accused of, if anything. The Shturmoviki had grown even more sadistic of late; perhaps this gassing was for their own amusement. Soon, Stepan knew, the deadly fog would fill the chamber and the crying, shaking masses would die. He closed his eyes, trying not to think of the stink of unwashed, terrified humanity or the weeping of his fellow prisoners. But the gas never came.\n\nA Shturmovik officer rushed into the gas chamber, flanked by his bodyguards, "By order of the Blessed Regent, your execution is forestalled indefinitely, step out into the hallway, please." Surprised, suspicious, and overjoyed, Stepan and the other prisoners began to file out of the killing room. What was this all about? Was the new regent a kinder man than Taboritsky? As the naked masses reached the hall way, a squad of Shturmoviki with submachine guns awaited them. "Against the wall, please," said the officer, gesturing with his pistol. The confused prisoners obeyed. Were they to be shot? Why not gas them?\n\nThe officer produced a sheet of paper and began to rattle off a list of names. Stepan did not hear his. "Step forwards," said the officer once he had finished reading, and a number of the selected prisoners did so. The officer turned and began to leave with his catch.\n\n"Take us with you!" shouted one prisoner, a young woman who would have been beautiful were she not so skeletally starved. "You can't leave us!" Stepan was about to say the same when the Shturmoviki raised their guns and began to fire. A hail of lead ripped through the naked, huddled masses, leaving them crumpled against the hall. Stepan, blood leaking from his lips, fell on top of the pile of corpses, never knowing why he died."
 after_midnight_coup.2.a: "The Blessed Regent watches over his own."

 after_midnight_coup.3.t: "A Fallen Throne"
 after_midnight_coup.3.d: "Viktor Larionov settled into the chair almost tentatively, as if Taboritsky's ghost might smite him dead for doing so. The new Blessed Regent sighed, placing the flat of his hands on the desk. This was his now, all of Russia was his. He looked around the room, taking in the tasteful displays of imperial splendor that adorned the chamber of the late Taboritsky. He looked at the portrait of Alexei that the old man had so lovingly obsessed over and smiled. The old man was dead, and this was Larionov's empire now.\n\nDead, yes, Larionov had been the one to discover the late Blessed Regent's bloated corpse, already staining the lovely rug. The Shturmoviki under his command had quietly burned the Regent's corpse weeks ago, but the masses didn't know this. So, then, a public funeral for the old man was to be arranged, something to placate the plebians.\n\nHe began to type, detailing the funeral, closed casket, of course. The people were not holy enough to look upon Taboritsky's face, besides, that same face had been squirming with insects before it was consumed by flames. The casket would be weighted, but devoid of any corpse. A priest of Taboritsky's own sect would perform the ceremony, of course, but Larionov would march at the front of the procession. With Taboritsky, officially, in the ground, Larionov could assume all functions of his office without any complaint. Larionov adopted a satisfied expression. A new chapter of the Holy Russian Empire was beginning, and he held the pen in his hand."
 after_midnight_coup.3.a: "The Regent lives."

 after_midnight_coup.4.t: "Book and Bell"
 after_midnight_coup.4.d: "Bells rang, feet stamped piously, and priests droned a mournful dirge. Born aloft by porters, the casket of Sergey Taboritsky, surrounded by Larionov's most loyal followers, proceeded through Vyatka. It was a haunting sight; no crowds gathered, no one wept, and even the carrion birds that roosted in the burnt ruins of buildings made not a sound. Viktor Larionov, the Blessed Regent, stood at the front of the procession, head bowed in proper piety.\n\nFrightened eyes peeked out from shattered windows and burnt doorways, gaunt faces sick with hunger and pain watching as the funeral march stamped down the street. Taboritsky was dead, but any hope that might have brought the people of Vyatka had been crushed by Larionov's self-appointment as the new Blessed Regent. Unburied corpses and starving dogs lined the streets, ignored and forgotten Russians who had not been deemed holy enough for a funeral such as this. Larionov played the part of the mournful heir brilliantly, keeping a grim visage for the benefit of his own entourage and for the lookers on.\n\nAt last, they reached the appointed place, the cathedral graveyard where Taboritsky would be buried. The casket was lowered into the freshly dug hole, prayers spilling from the lips of all those present. Larionov stood near the grave, hands clasped. "Today, we send our dearly beloved Sergey Taboritsky to join Our Father in Heaven, to serve as His right hand in death as he did in life. Never has the world seen such a devout warrior of Christ, never will we see his like again. Though we mourn his passing, we must give thanks to the Lord for having delivered him unto us. Without Taboritsky, Russia would still be a Jew-infested den of sin. Thanks to Taboritsky, our Blessed Regent, Russia has been purified, made godly in preparation for Alexei's return. God bless Taboritsky. God bless Alexei. God bless Russia." Larionov finished by throwing a handful of earth onto the casket.\n\nEarth began to fill the grave as they dug, and the empty casket was hidden away, like a shameful secret, forever."
 after_midnight_coup.4.a: "Alexei would weep, were he in attendance."

 after_midnight_coup.5.t: "Son of Cain"
 after_midnight_coup.5.d: "Larionov's hands shook as he read. No, no, no, this couldn't be. Taboritsky was the holiest man in Russia, a paragon of good, the model Christian! But the words, Taboritsky's own words, told the awful truth. Sergey Taboritsky was the son of a Jewess. That meant, by the Christ-Killers' own laws, that the late Blessed Regent was himself a Hebrew. Larionov slumped into his chair, allowing the diary to slip from his cold, trembling fingers. Had it all been a lie? No, not a lie, Taboritsky's diary revealed he had been deeply devoted to Alexei, so it wasn't some Jewish plot to destroy Russia. At least he had the sense to be deeply ashamed of his polluted blood.\n\nHours later, the Blessed Regent and his chieftains gathered in secret, Larionov holding the diary in his hands. "Gentlemen," announced Larionov, his mouth dry, "I must reveal to you a most disturbing truth." Eyes narrowed, throats swallowed, sweat percolated on brows. Almost choking on the words in disgust, Larionov forced them out like reluctant bile, "the late Sergey Taboritsky was a Jew by his own admission, writ by his own hand." Looks of horror crossed the faces of the chieftains, whilst others purpled in rage. Larionov opened the book to the marked page and began to read the damning passage, the chieftains remaining silent.\n\n"I fear," began Plotnikov, "it may only be a matter of time before this information leaks out, if we-".\n\n"No," interrupted Larionov, "this could work to our advantage. Only we know the contents of the diary. We will say this: the coup was a measure to protect Russia from international Jewery, thereby legitimizing my rule."\n\nThe meeting adjourned, Larionov returned to his office, taking care to secure the diary within a safe. He would master this revelation, and Taboritsky the Jew would serve the new Blessed Regent."
 after_midnight_coup.5.a: "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past."

 after_midnight_coup.6.t: "Quid est Veritas?"
 after_midnight_coup.6.d: "The armored car rolled through Vyatka, the swastika and icon of the Holy Russian Empire emblazoned on its chassis in bold paint. Lukova watched as it passed, flinching in fear and hiding behind a crumbled wall. It wouldn't be out of character for such a vehicle to open fire on a cowering citizen just as Taboritsky had purged the destitute in Syktyvkar. Instead of bullets, the car sprayed sound, emitting from crackling speakers that jutted like gargoyles from its turret.\n\n"Christians, fellow Russians," began the unmistakable voice of the second Blessed Regent, "I come to you with disturbing news." Lukova, still in hiding, wondered why Larionov had bothered to specify. All news in the Holy Russian Empire was disturbing to some degree. "Sergey Taboritsky, our fallen and former Blessed Regent, was, according to his own words written in a secret diary, a Jew." Onlookers gasped, adopted expressions of surprise, or said nothing as they shuffled away from the propaganda car. Lukova did nothing, said nothing, there was no point in doing so. Taboritsky a Jew? Surely, that had to be a lie.\n\n"Like all Jews," continued the voice of the Blessed Regent, "Taboritsky possessed a twisted mind, and I tell you with sorrow that he planned to murder Alexei as a sacrifice to his Hebrew deity when our beloved Tsarevich returned. I and my companions were forced to act."\n\n"Yes, my fellow Christians, my ascension to the position of Blessed Regent was done out of love for you, for Christ. Taboritsky was slain by the judgement of God, and it was God who ordained that I save the Holy Russian Empire from the taint of Jewery. Hebrews still lurk amongst us, good Christians, we must be ever vigilant for their tricks and lies."\n\nThe car rolled on, deeper into Vyatka, the speech carrying on, fading as it grew further and further from Lukova's hiding place. Did it matter to her if Taboritsky had been a Jew? Certainly not, and certainly not now that Larionov promised only more pain, more pogroms, more death. Did the truth matter at all?"
 after_midnight_coup.6.a: "The death train rolls along, no matter who the conductor is, no matter his blood."

 after_midnight_coup.7.t: "Vyatka Calling"
 after_midnight_coup.7.d: "Larionov stared at the radio, at the great map of the Holy Russian Empire. He minions stood in silent fear, awaiting what the Blessed Regent would say or do next. Communications had been patched through to the outer reaches of the empire following the death of Taboritsky, and the news was not good. Secession, desertion, and a disregard for Larionov's orders ruled beyond the regions beyond the Blessed Regent's direct control. "Those ungrateful Jew fucks!" screamed Larionov, slamming the palm of his hand down on the table with enough force to cause pencils to jump from their resting places. "After all this, after all we have sacrificed, all we have gained, those cowards, those blood-traitors, shit it all away!" The Blessed Regent's face contorted in rage, and the chieftains dared not speak. "The army won't listen to me, the Shturmoviki outside Vyatka can't be fucked to call me back, and Melkikh is sitting in his roost and laughing at me! I am the Regent! I will not be ignored!" Sweat shone off Larionov's face, and the Regent took a shuddering breath. Emphatically, he beat his fists against his chest, "I am the master over life and death in Russia, I will not be denied. I want the name of every commander, every officer, every soldier who will not accept my authority. I want them rounded up and burned at the stake, I want their families fed to dogs, and I want their towns gassed!"\n\nLarionov sagged into his chair, seeming to deflate. "As far as I am concerned, only you present here at this moment are loyal to me and to the empire. There will be Hell to pay, all of Russia will be back in our hands. I swear this on God, if I die, Russia dies with me." The Blessed Regent's voice was low, soft, but tinged malice and venom, the voice of a wounded viper. Night fell over Vyatka, and over the Holy Russian Empire."
 after_midnight_coup.7.a: "Loyalty to the Regent, it seems, extends only as far as a bullet can travel."

 thanksforplaying.1.d: "On a cool spring morning, as the rasputitsa passed, one might have recently seen an unusual and unsettling sight. Amidst the rising stalks of verdant grass and the life-giving soil of the Motherland, there lay a dead man. What clothes he wore in life were reduced by the elements to nothing more than discoloured scraps. Small bits and baubles made of gold, silver, and gemstones hid beneath a layer of dirt, taking the appearance of mere scrap and pebbles.\n\nThe skull's hollow eyes betrayed nothing of the life that had once danced within their windows. Whatever heart previously beat within the broken ribcage had long since rotted away to nothing - whether it had been withered and black, or vibrant and full of love, was of no consequence. The rings set upon skeletal fingers could have meant anything, such was their burnished state.\n\nAnd yet, was it truly so frightening a sight? Whoever those old bones once supported, they were but dust on the wind, and a name consigned to memory. Whatever the dead man had done in life, he was gone now. Anything terrible that could have been attributed to him, no matter how awful, was in the past. Whether or not he had been consigned to a particular afterlife, his mortal form was no more.\n\nSomeday, the bones too would be reduced to nothing. They would be eroded by the wind and rain, and no more would their presence perturb the Motherland's peace."

"Incredible. That's Mother Nature for you, I suppose."\n\n"Not just her," replied the other with a gentle smile. "We were busy while you were going up and down the country, taking your samples and poking around in the dirt. Astounding what a lot of determined people with shovels can do!"\n\nThe first grinned as they stowed away the screen in a pouch. "Of course that was your idea.

The melancholy passed, yet moisture dampened their eyes.\n\nThe first clapped the other on the back. "It's safe. We made it that way - you, me, the others... and the Motherland herself. The taint didn't last, just like everything else he built." The first released that they, too, were weeping. Overcome, the pair embraced. Against all odds, after all the horror and suffering and deprivation, it was over. Life had found a way."

Zeya wasn't much better, but at least it had the warmth of home and hearth.\n\n"How long has it been?" she murmured, gazing southwards across the rooftops of a rebuilt Arkhangelsk. How long, indeed. When last she walked the European side of Russia, the world was a very different place. Computers were the size of refrigerators back then; now, a device with countless times the processing power fit neatly into the palm of her hand. Not to mention how much the land itself had changed...\n\nShe felt the memories rising unbidden. They were always there, just below the surface, scratching at the walls of their prison. For so long, they had ruled her. It had taken so many years of effort to-\n\nShe shook her head, dispersing the whispers. They didn't rule her anymore. Once, but never again. She lived, as Russia lived. The empire, the Shturmoviki, the Regent - they did not. They had been unable to prevent her escape across the shattered lands of Siberia. They held no power there, nor in Amur, where she had found a home, nor over her still-beating heart.\n\nLike the Motherland, Svetlana was free. Scarred, broken, grieving - but free.

Due to its nature, the Mercantile Consortium is no longer capable of executing the brutal purges of Taboritsky's empire - but the racial theories remain.

With the assistance of his Shturmoviki, he has proclaimed himself Blessed Regent of the Holy Russian Empire and purged his opposition, protecting the Imperial Cult within his borders. As Taboritsky before him, Larionov believes it is his divine mission to reunite the Empire and prepare the way for the return of the rightful monarch - though his commitment to Alexei specifically is dubious. However, his lack of manpower limits him, and means that he shall always be a mere pariah kingdom of raiders and thieves.[AM_check_if_nation_has_been_visited_KOM]"

Though initially rejecting power, the people made their wishes clear: every other ideology has failed Russia, in the end. In the absence of anyone better, they have turned once more to God - or, in the case of the secularists, to the last authority that might retain some competence and moral backbone. A semi-theocratic republic has thus been declared, with a mixture of clergy and laity making up the government, bureaucracy and officer corps.[AM_check_if_nation_has_been_visited_TMS]"

In the face of this adversity, however, Nowa Polska, and the spirit of Poland itself, lives on in General Ryszard Kukliński - a former officer of Nowa Polska, turned partisan when Taboritsky's forces came to Kazakhstan. Seizing lands north of the Kazakh Purification Army's reach, Kukliński has mustered a force of Polish expatriates who flooded across the border in droves in the wake of Gaziz's advance, anti-fascist Russians, and Kazakh refugees who have fled the Purification Army's brutal regime. The Autonomous Soviet Liberation Army will stop at nothing to put down the maddened Kazakhs and restore a free, equitable state - and as long as Kukliński and his soldiers draw breath, the spirit of Poland will never die.[AM_check_if_nation_has_been_visited_TML]"

Joining forces in the hope of staving off further destruction, their intense persecution and enslavement has left them bitter towards Great Russians, despite knowing that all peoples have suffered under Taboritsky. Spurning contact with the rest of Russia, they will form an isolationist pluralist-ethnostate, where ethnic Great Russians are encouraged to reject their old identities and assimilate into a 'more moral ethnicity'. No half measures shall be taken to guard their new Free State from potential oppressors - for the corpse of the Empire is still on their border, and Larionov still lurks.[AM_check_if_nation_has_been_visited_TMQ]"

Seeing weakness in the newly established Free State, Evtukhovich's forces, made up of the Second Imperial Guard Division and several reserve divisions made up of irregular Shturmovik auxiliaries, have plunged into war once more, seeing to restore Imperial control over the steppes, and finally purge the steppe peoples that have revealed their hand once more.[AM_check_if_nation_has_been_visited_TMU]"

Instead, the workers and peasants must unite under a collective will of iron, armed to the teeth and ready for battle. Thankfully, there is a particular brand of Bolshevism that thought along similar lines already - one that has been eagerly spread with zeal by former Party men from Tyumen. Mikhail Pervukhin, a former disciple of Kaganovich, has taken command of the lands of Orenburg, and begun the process of reshaping Orenburg itself to resist the fascist invader - one that shall suffer the Tsarist and reactionary not to live.[AM_check_if_nation_has_been_visited_TMN]"

With the collapse of central authority, and its ranks filled with particularly nasty men under the rule of their commander, Ivan Melkikh, they've decided to make out like bandits, and loot and pillage the north of Russia. Using their massive helicopter fleet, they have fled north to the oil fields near the Arctic Circle, establishing themselves as a force of airborne raiders who live to pillage and plunder with impunity, still waving the flag of the Regent for the slightest facade of legitimacy.[AM_check_if_nation_has_been_visited_TMD]"

In internal exile, the surviving leader of the Black League, Alexander Lazarenko, has developed a new Thesis - one that implements the lessons learned against the Regent. The Great Trial, according to Lazarenko, was not against the Germans, but against fellow Russians. The Black League can trust nobody - not even fellow Russians. Lazarenko's Redeemed Black League will be a state formed of the purest, untainted by the foolish notion of a shared Russian heritage.

Horrified by this revelation, and by the destruction wrought upon Russia by this arch-Jew as part of some greater plot, a large swathe of the Shturmoviki disavowed their 'rightful' commanders and seized the bunker-city of Omsk. His religion, his government, his cause - all of it a lie, perpetuated by the Jews to destroy Russia. If God is the enemy, and the old gods of Russia are dead, there is only one god who can be turned to - He who inspired murder in the mind of the righteous killer, Cain, and rebelled against all that the Jew-god stood for.[AM_check_if_nation_has_been_visited_TMB]"

They will establish a stronghold and neutral ground at Mount Yamantau, where Taboritsky once stood and thought himself unassailable - this will be their de-jure capital.

However, this is not true in the slightest. In reality, the Institute is a benevolent institution, run as the last enclave of science and vision within Russia, founded by the combined effort of Ultravisionary refugees, saner scientists from the Black Mountain, and intellectuals that have fled from all over Russia.

Yet, life endures, and small green shoots rise from the ashes of that grand old city. Based in the districts of the city that have not been levelled, amongst the local elites entrusted with rebuilding Tomsk as an imperial city were hundreds of former Bastillards - dedicated civil servants who secretly did all that they could to resist the influence of Taboritsky's Empire.

In the wake of the fall of the Mad Regent, these differences, always simmering under the surface, have erupted into a boil, as Androniy Mishurenko engages Comrade Taratuta's Free Territory, seeking to assimilate it under his own vision for the region.

With the fall of the Regency, and communications to the government lost, Goleniewski has styled his moustache, put on the most regal outfit he can find, and declared himself to be the Tsarevich returned to the citizens of Irkutsk.

In winds of cold steel those enemies have been killed, and maimed, and mutilated, until today, where the Regent once again reigns over the greyed, emptied husk that is Russia. The empire endures. Larionov has stepped away from active leadership, and has begun the dismantlement of the personality cult of Tsarevich Alexei.
