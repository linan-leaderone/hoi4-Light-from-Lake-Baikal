AST_The_Curlew_Cries_desc: "Australia is a settled state, not one which grew naturally from the peoples who inhabited it. Our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander inhabitants are now minorities in their former lands, and have neither the rights nor privileges of most Australians. They aren't even counted as people on the census. The debate over this has been ongoing in Australian political society for some decades now, and as the decade goes on seems only to have grown more heated."

AST_A_Nation_of_Many_Differences_desc: "There is no Australian ethnicity, aside from what few native peoples remain. Instead our citizens come from Ireland and from Russia. Dutchmen walk alongside the descendants of Greeks and English. In truth, nobody is quite sure what Australia is. Separated from Britain, many ask if now we should chart our own course, or hold strong to the traditions of our founders."

WORLD_AST.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Prime Minister of Australia Resigns"
WORLD_AST.1.desc: "Australian Labor Prime Minister Kim Beazley has resigned after a pork-barreling scandal claimed several high-profile members of the Federal Cabinet. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were funneled into marginal seats in a plot to steer the results in Labor's favor. Beazley was not implicated, but cited his failure to "turn the searchlight of absolute honesty" onto his party as the reason for his resignation.\n\nDr. Herbert V. Evatt, a leading member of the ALP's Left faction, has been chosen as the party's interim leader, making him the current Prime Minister of Australia. The erratic former High Court judge will preside over the Government until its parliamentary caucus convenes to elect the man who will carry it to the upcoming snap election. However, Labor's poor performance in nationwide opinion polls and Evatt's declining health have stirred rumors of a leadership challenge.\n"
WORLD_AST.1.a: "Don't let the revolving door hit you on the backside."

WORLD_AST.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Cameron Claims Victory in Australian Snap Election"
WORLD_AST.2.desc: "As one of the few remaining OFN-aligned nations in Japan's Mare Nostrum in the Pacific, both Tokyo and Washington have watched the elections with an impassioned interest. In these turbulent times, the voters of Australia have emphasised the need for dependability and trust in their Premier. It is then little surprise that Clyde Cameron has seized the lead and triumphed in the elections.\n\nAn infamous pragmatist within the Labor Party, Cameron has managed to use his allies within the grinding gears of the Party Machine to become the ALP's choice for the ballot. While he has triumphed within, the road to keep Adelaide Avenue was always going to be one fraught with dangers and potholes. While his opponents may spin the re-election of a party that was embroiled in a scandal a few months ago - as a negative, Cameron's use of rhetoric and capitalisation of the uncertainty of the so-called 'Cold War' has erupted in a surge of votes in his favour. Now with a finely attuned Parliamentarian in power, many wonder what's next for the continent.\n"
WORLD_AST.2.a: "Solidarity Forever in the Sunburnt Nation."

WORLD_AST.3.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Arthur Calwell Becomes PM of Australia"
WORLD_AST.3.desc: "It appears that there is a new wind blowing through Australia. But not quite as new as one would think. The Australian Labor Party have triumphed once more at the polls despite their scandal two months prior, and insider party scheming and politicking has led to an old guard candidate on the "Right" Wing of the ALP.\n\nArthur Calwell has claimed victory in the recent snap election in Australia. While the powers of the world eye up Calwell's still unclear intentions abroad, that stands in sharp contrast to his policies at home. Arguing for nothing less than full liberties to the labor unions that make up the vast industries of Oceania and the unflinching preservation of a White Australia, Calwell will use everything in his arsenal - including his characteristically silver tongue - to move the members of Parliament into voting for his measures. Yes, there is a new wind blowing through Australia, and that wind calls for the downtrodden and dispossessed in society.\n"
WORLD_AST.3.a: "A socialist who supports the White Australia Policy? Preposterous."

WORLD_AST.4.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]John Gorton Reigns Supreme in Australia"
WORLD_AST.4.desc: "In a sea of elderly geriatrics and 'Alter Kämpfers' within politics, the Australian voters have picked someone more fresh-faced for the hot seat of the Premiership. John Gorton, a member of the Liberal Party, has taken the decisive lead he needs to become the next Prime Minister of Australia.\n\nA relative newcomer to the political scene, his ideology is like few others in the nation. Combining a policy of social progress and rights for the individual with his fervent support for the nation's economy to become more self-reliant and promotion of Australian businesses, the news must have been bad news for the economic masterminds in the United States seeking to deepen ties with the nation. However if this has been a minor bump for the OFN, it has been a catastrophe for Tokyo. Gorton has pledged his unwavering support against the Empire of Japan, with tensions between the two devolving almost immediately. But only time will tell what Gorton has planned for the Land Down Under.\n"
WORLD_AST.4.a: "Let's just hope he knows what he's doing."

WORLD_AST.5.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Paul Hasluck Prevails in Australian Snap Election"
WORLD_AST.5.desc: "Once considered a black sheep, even amongst his own party, it appears that the winds of Fortune have changed decisively in Paul Hasluck's favour. A proponent of Old Tory-style Paternalism, the fact that he is in the Liberal Party at all may strike as contradictory. With the Liberal Party being comprised of devotees of the creed to devolve Canberra's outreach and place more emphasis on the individual and states, Hasluck's victory doesn't simply signal a change for the country, but a change at the very foundation of Australian politics.\n\nWith this electoral upset, Australia has chosen firmly to look into their past to solve the problems of their present. In his victory speech, Hasluck referenced the 'lack of unity' within society, pledging to 'mend the divide' and to 'fix society' once and for all. Moreover, Hasluck promised that "every citizen will feel naturally obliged to lend each other aid". Whether Hasluck can push his bold vision through Parliament - with rumblings of dissent in his own party - is another issue entirely.\n"
WORLD_AST.5.a: "It appears that he did have luck, after all."

WORLD_AST.6.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Constitution of Australia Destroyed!"
WORLD_AST.6.desc: "Australian Prime Minister Joh Bjelke-Petersen has done the unthinkable. Live on national television, the PM took out a copy of the Australian Constitution and tore it apart with a pair of scissors, shortly before announcing that his government would no longer be bound by it. Condemning the Constitution as "another tool of the elites", he proclaimed that a new era of 'proper governance' had begun in Australia. An especially egregious act even in Joh's own history of media manipulation and rampant cronyism, observers note that a tipping point has been reached in an administration that has up to now seen multiple escalating controversies.\n\nIn light of this truly historic moment, riots have broken out in every single major city across the continent, with an unprecedented joint statement from both the Labor and Liberal Party accusing Bjelke-Petersen of 'totalitarianism reminiscent of Adolf Hitler'. As police squads scour the country for unruly protesters and any of those that stand in Joh's way, a dawn is rising over Australia. Even if it threatens to scorch all in its way.\n"
WORLD_AST.6.a: "So begins Australia's fall."

WORLD_AST.7.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Joh Bjelke-Petersen Elected PM of Australia"
WORLD_AST.7.desc: "In an unexpected upset, controversial former Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen's Country-Liberal Coalition has narrowly triumphed in what has proven to be one of the most polarizing federal elections in Australian history. Known for his brash demeanor and suppression of protests and strikes, Bjelke-Petersen's detractors have labeled him a populist and political rule breaker, labels he's seemingly embraced. Campaigning on a highly publicised platform of anti-socialism and conservatism, observers have commented that much of Joh's support came as a backlash to the perceived alienation caused by previous governments.\n\nAlready the new Prime Minister has become embroiled in controversy as he jubilantly announced that the 'communist plotters' of the Labor Party wouldn't be returning to the Prime Ministership 'any time soon'. Some Australians fear Joh may be here to stay.\n"
WORLD_AST.7.a: "Don't you worry about that!"

WORLD_AST.8.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Australia Tests Its First Nuclear Weapon"
WORLD_AST.8.desc: "Officials from the Sphere and OFN are closely watching the Maralinga test range in South Australia, where Australian Prime Minister [AST.GetLeader]'s nuclear weapons program has successfully tested its first atomic bomb. The Prime Minister pledged to develop an Australian nuclear arsenal shortly after his election, citing Japanese regional hegemony as an existential threat to the island nation. The detonation at Maralinga cements Australia as the world's fifth nuclear-armed state — a source of security among Australians and great anxiety amongst others. It is currently unknown if Australia received any outside help in developing the weapon.\n\nThe Japanese Foreign Minister has condemned the test, calling it "the penultimate step on a staircase to oblivion.""
WORLD_AST.8.a: "The red plume makes the Outback seem pale..."

WORLD_AST.9.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Prime Minister Dismantles Australian Nuclear Arsenal!"
WORLD_AST.9.desc: "Australian Prime Minister Jim Cairns has announced today that his administration has dismantled Australia's fledgling nuclear arsenal. Cairns, a socialist activist, was elected to the premiership in 1968 on a hardline anti-nuclear platform. His supporters celebrate the development as the welcome outcome of years of campaigning.\n\nNonetheless, the country's allies are shocked at the sudden reversal in nuclear policy, with many at home believing the decision to have wasted millions of dollars in research and increased the island nation's vulnerability over what local commentators are calling 'blind idealism'. Meanwhile, top American diplomats argue that Cairns has weakened the OFN in the Pacific. Japanese reactions have been positive, with Japan's Foreign Minister congratulating the PM on his commitment to regional peace."
WORLD_AST.9.a: "Precedent in the making, maybe."

WORLD_AST.10.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Australia, USA Sign Polaris Sales Agreement"
WORLD_AST.10.desc: "Australia and the United States have signed a historic deal for the sale of the Polaris A3 submarine-launched ballistic missile. Under the agreement, the US will provide Australia with materials and systems to develop a sea-based nuclear deterrent with reduced vulnerability to a first strike. The agreement also includes provisions for the construction of four fleet ballistic missile submarines modeled on the US Benjamin Franklin class in Australian shipyards and for navy exchange programs to train new submarine crews. The first of these new submarines are not expected to be commissioned until the mid-1970s, and are expected to serve for a period of 30 years.\n\nSphere diplomats have slammed the deal, arguing it raises tensions in the Asia-Pacific and increases the likelihood of a nuclear exchange."
WORLD_AST.10.a: "A dangerous current in the Emperor's ocean."

AST_scripted.12.t: "Australia Requests Sale of SLBMs"
AST_scripted.12.d: "[USA.GetLeader] tapped the hardwood top of the resolute desk with the butt of a fountain pen. A decision that could potentially move the doomsday clock hours forward at the forefront of his mind. 'Australia and nukes...' [USA.GetSheHe]'d been getting tired of hearing about it. The issue of selling Australia nuclear-equipped submarines had first been raised months ago and now the scheduled meeting with the Prime Minister was just a week away. The meeting would officially end the matter but in truth, it all came down to the President, and better to come prepared with an answer than drag this headache out longer than it needed to be.\n\nAustralia having nuclear weapons at all had been a risky move, giving them submarines with which to launch them? There'd be no denying it would be a great kick in the teeth to Japan, but would it be a bridge too far? It could spell disaster if Japan retaliated, Sphere nukes in South East Asia was the last thing the public needed to hear about. Then again, an OFN member besides America having the capability to truly defend itself from attack could prove popular among the more internationally minded voters.\n\nIt all came down to a calculated risk, [USA.GetPresidentLastName] stopped tapping, flipped the pen around and wrote [USA.GetHerHis] decision on a memo."
AST_scripted.12.a: "What are Americans if not risk takers? Australia will have its subs."

POLITICS_HAROLD_HOLT_DESC: "For Harold Edward Holt, the recent nomination to become the prime minister of the Australian republic has been the last achievement of a long and accomplished career in politics. Born into a land owning family in Sydney, Holt entered politics at a young age as a member of the Young Nationalists, the youth wing of the United Australia Party, and was elected to parliament at the age of 27, making him the youngest MP at the time. Quickly becoming a protégé of Robert Menzies, Holt continued his career during wartime and rose through the ranks of the Liberal Party of Australia, the newly formed successor of the UAP.\n\nThe war proved to be an immense shock for the Australian nation. In what would turn out to be a pointless war ending in a bitter defeat, the country lost a generation of her brave young men, and as the Japanese sun rose over the Pacific, Australia was irredeemably scarred by its burning rays. Amidst cries for change and a deep political crisis, Canberra cut her ties to London just as Nazi troops completed the occupation of England, thus giving birth to the Republic of Australia. The politics of the young republic were dominated by the Labor Party, but soon Holt rose to the forefront of the opposition, eventually becoming the leader of the Liberal Party.\n\nEventually, the Liberal Party gained enough popularity to reach victory in the 1961 elections, with Holt being finally proclaimed prime minister. Promising to reaffirm the country's ties to the OFN, both economically and militarily, and to finally stabilize the country's economy while also ending the White Australia policy once and for all, Holt won over the nation with his reformist platform - however, only time will tell if his vision of a free, prosperous and fair Australia will be destined to become reality."
POLITICS_KIM_BEAZLEY_SR_DESC: "Perhaps in better times, Kim Edward Beazley could have been known as a patron of education. A crusader fighting against the plague of illiteracy and slack-jawed idiocy in the Sunburnt Nation. In other, missed futures - slipping through his fingers like minute grains of sand - perhaps Beazley wouldn't have had to become Prime Minister. Content with his position inside the House of Representatives, Beazley could have settled himself as a modern Cicero, tackling his opponents with acerbic wit and passion inside his shining city on the hill.\n\nBut these are not peaceful times. Australia finds itself on the verge of encirclement by Tokyo's unrelenting waves. An entire generation of young men lies rotting inside the Papuan jungle, with not even the Charon's consolation of victory cradle their spirits as they cross the Styx. Only the logistical nightmare of invasion and occupation of the Land Down Under saved Australia from being skewed upon the blood-encrusted bayonets of the Japanese Empire. With only a tenuous lifeline to America, many are starting to wonder. Will Australia survive to fight another day? Or will it - like Eastern Asia - succumb to the Sun's blinding glare? Or will the most heinous enemy come from within?\n\nFaced with such dire consequences as one's independence, it is no wonder why the young man is such a proponent of renewed ties to Washington's warm embrace. After all, with Britannia's Throne claimed by traitorous pretenders, is it little wonder why Australia should align with the Last Hope of Liberty? Beazley stands, with his back to the past, and his brow to the future and shouts;\n\nAustralia, Advance!"
POLITICS_ARTHUR_CALWELL_DESC: "Support for the White Australia policy has slowly diminished over the last twenty years. The network of racist legislation first passed to safeguard Australia as an outpost of the British race in Oceania has been, and is slowly being, unwound by a new generation of cautious reformists.\n\nPolitical lepers, the lot of them!\n\nArthur Augustus Calwell is the most dogged, full-throated defender of the White Australia policy in the Federal Parliament. Calwell contends that standing as sovereign of his own nation, the African, the Asian, and the mulatto is equal to the white man, but upon his first step in Australia, he becomes a pollutant. No nation, however strong, can survive the unsegregated cohabitation of the races. It is with this line of thinking that Calwell argues he is not a racist, but merely proud of his color, as any man ought to be. His critics deride him for this. Calwell reckons they're all ratbags.\n\nIndeed, what Calwell reckons has always come first. He argues that the media misrepresents him: that they never focus on the working-class man orating from the back of pickup trucks in isolated townships on the need for rural hospitals; on the self-educated unionist conversant in Mandarin who argues against involvement in foreign wars; or the community-minded Socialist who champions welfare and good wages.\n\nBut all of that ends at the color line. In the hazy bar of Parliament House, holding a shot glass level to his eyes, the Prime Minister grins and rasps to his comrades, "Two Wongs do not make a White.""
POLITICS_JOHN_GORTON_DESC: "In a party of economic liberals, a larrikin centralist rules the roost. John Grey Gorton, Prime Minister of Australia, is a self-aware anomaly. Treading the narrow passageways of Parliament House, he overhears party adversaries deride his policies as a strain of creeping Socialism - "Gortonism", they call it. They say they're like a club of mushrooms: kept in the dark and fed on shit. Gorton just laughs and asks if he can join, and so his backbenchers call him "Chief Spore".\n\nBut past all his jokes, Gorton knows that he is isolated. He is an economic nationalist, social liberal, hard drinker, and chronic womanizer, and for these abnormalities, he is on one day labeled a threat, and on the next, an embarrassment. They don't know how little their jibes sting; Gorton has endured much worse. They don't know about the airplane crash, or the childhood spent loving a mother trapped in a sanatorium. They don't know the man who lost his face, only to walk in front of the cameras and smile anyway.\n\nGorton's mission, as he sees it, is to bring progress to a nation content with the security of political Luddism. Whether he will trust his cabinet with this mission is sure to be one of the defining dilemmas of his premiership. Or, perhaps, his last."
POLITICS_CLYDE_CAMERON_DESC: "Clyde Cameron broods at the fork of old and new Labor, not knowing which way the wind will blow. He rakes his hair, scratches his neck, and considers the currents. He refers to his diaries, which he has kept every day since he joined the parliamentary caucus, with times, vote tallies, and snide remarks all recorded. Looking over the figures of Australian leftism - from the antediluvian party elders to the neophytes running student occupations - Cameron decides on the need for a new strategy and a change in leadership.\n\nOnce a Labor head-kicker, Clyde Cameron gradually developed into a calm, diligent, and vindictive political operator respected by parliamentarians on both sides of the aisle. Within Labor, he champions the need to accommodate a changing electorate and the erosion of old voting coalitions. But Cameron's image as a pragmatist hides the idealistic, stalwart Socialist underneath. No one will dissuade him from his dream: an Australia where the worker lives in happiness and security, tolerance has triumphed over bigotry, and war is never waged.\n\nTo forge such a future, there must first be the Socialists who will bring it about. Cameron knows that Parliament considers him spiteful and fastidious. He suspects that the ASIO and the CIA monitor him, as well. If he fails, despite his energies, then Cameron will educate the next generation of Australian Socialists to accomplish what he could not. Cameron has vitriol in surplus for his enemies, but he affords the struggle for a better world, and the strugglers most of all, nothing but admiration."
POLITICS_PAUL_HASLUCK_DESC: "From poet to politician, to historian, and now Prime Minister, Paul Meernaa Caedwalla Hasluck has built his entire career on a fathomless energy for his dearest passions. Coming from a modest Fremantle home, Hasluck first broke into public policy by writing newspaper articles under the pseudonym 'Polygon.' Many Western Australians knew his advocacy for forward defense or international governance before they knew his real name. But when Hasluck arrived in the House of Representatives in 1949, many members found him difficult to know.\n\nHasluck's contemporaries have supplied many assessments: he is collegial but somewhat stuffy, prohibitively fastidious, formal, well-read, private, and good-humored, with a preference for governance rather than politics. He despises shouting and loud noises in general. He prizes clarity. Hasluck resents delegating, preferring the comfort in private ministrations and a sense of duty sated. He is demanding, sometimes aggressive to subordinates, and loves the Australian land dearly.\n\nThe red flatness of the Outback is now just a vagrant memory. Even in the tight halls of Parliament House, with its stubborn cigarette haze and crushing tight corridors, Hasluck occasionally feels the phantom touch of windswept sand tracking around his ankles. But his task is unchanged. The order that must be impressed - if necessary, by assimilation - is one of liberty and individualism, respect and duty, and resoluteness. Hasluck pretends at no higher purpose. His mission, he knows, is born of the common obligation at the heart of all humankind."
POLITICS_AUTHDEM_JOH_DESC: "To say that this was unexpected would be understating things. Few expected Johannes 'Joh' Bjelke-Petersen to run for the Premiership. Burdened by such a narrow support base, his violently inflammatory rhetoric and a run as the Queensland Premier marred by scandal and accusation upon accusation, it was clear why most mainstream political figures shrugged him off. Making his takeover of the Liberal-Country Coalition and victory in the elections only more stunning.\n\nBut of course, Joh was never aiming for the 'mainstream' audience now, was he? What has propelled the polio survivor to victory was not his backing by large corporations and fat-cat donors - although Joh was never one to turn down a free boost in the campaign - or his skilful handling of the burgeoning television and mass-media news - although that certainly helped. No, it was something much more base and primal. Hatred. Hatred for the pompous elites. Joh is a Prime Minister for the common man - a group that has had little weight inside Parliament until now. What Australia needs is someone who can speak with, not down to, the Citizen. Not that relentless scrabble in the trade unions or the tax office, that demands more and more to line their own pockets. If they're under the delusion that they can act as one, then they'll find out just how wrong they are.\n\nWhile the old, dying guard and the chains of bureaucracy may attempt to stop Joh, they cannot stop the people. Australia, by any means necessary, will be rebuilt into a home for all true citizens. Even if he has to break every single rule and defy every single regulation in the book."
POLITICS_DESPOT_JOH_DESC: "Australia is diseased. Putrescent to the palpitating, rotting core. Its institutions - keeping its satrapies flush with millions of taxpayer dollars - only serve to perpetuate this shambling husk of a nation. Australia is built off the tears and blood of a class assailed. Not just by the traitorous Communists and their fellow travellers in the Australian Labor Party - who would have our great people subjugated to a dying, decrepit ideology spouted by half-frozen Russian fanatics and yellow-bellied peaceniks but from above. Yes, above. The Canberra Elites, with their imported cigars and decadent orgies of backroom scheming and chardonnay, laugh from their ivory towers. They cackle as their puppets play politics while they continue to put their diamond-encrusted boot on the hard-working taxpayer. What has this land become?\n\nNo more. No more cries Joh. Like the tatters of the Constitution that line Joh's feet, these twin snakes will be strangled with the full might of the Executive Branch. Critics whine about the 'brazen' disregard for democracy by destroying that Constitution, live on air. Good, says Joh. Good that the ultimate symbol of elitism and champagne-soaked 'intellectualism' reels in agony. Good that the mainstream media, with their pockets lined with blood money, detests him so. Good that nobody will be able to stop him now.\n\nEven now, a transformation is occurring in Australia. Those who refuse to cooperate with Joh's new order, will be crushed underneath his boot. Police, armed to the teeth with lethal firepower, storm the offices of unruly journalists. In candlelight, Country Party enforcers redraw the lines of districts into grotesque salients and blotches, making sure that Australian Democracy only has one master. Corruption is a dirty word in Politics, but in Joh's Australia, it will be a curse that is uttered often and soon.\n\nStorm clouds have broken over Australia. Whatever emerges into the sunlight will be §Rtruly unrecognisable§!."
POLITICS_EVATT_DESC: "Herbert Vere Evatt was once a lambent star. An intimidatingly intelligent lawyer, Evatt graduated from the University of Sydney with first-class honors in four fields, two university medals, and, later, a Legum Doctor. He became an industrial lawyer, then the youngest High Court Justice in Australian history, and then from Leader of the Labor Party to be Prime Minister. But Evatt's brilliant mind has rusted away.\n\nEvatt suffers from the dual blights of cerebral thrombosis and arteriosclerosis. His memories, once like delicate friezes etched into steel, have slowly receded into an ambient buzz. Many in the Labor Party would say that Evatt's fall began before his mind slipped away - when he first decided that he was smarter than everyone else. He made a million decisions without consultation, half of them successful, half of them not. In Parliament, Evatt could no longer impress a pace on his environment.\n\nOscillating between serenity and belligerence, but nightmarishly lucid, Evatt hews at the heart of a political quagmire. The factions and the Liberals crowd him. Parliament has turned against the White Australia policy, and Evatt has not turned with them. His mind lies to him as the clock counts down, suggesting facts he knows are false. Perhaps what good Evatt could have done has already been done. Perhaps all his judgments will succeed him sooner than he thought.\n\nPerhaps his time is at an end."
POLITICS_JOHN_MCEWEN_DESC: "John "Black Jack" McEwen, the Prime Minister of Australia, is a grim man who grew up in a narrow room in the back of a chemist's shop. McEwen's mother died when he was two and his father died when he was seven. He left school at thirteen to provide for his grandmother and younger sister, and in 1918, he left his work to join the Australian Imperial Force in their fight against the Central Powers. He never saw combat, but his service made him eligible for a grant of farmland from the Australian government. From there, he tilled the land, made a productive farm, and joined the Victorian Farmers' Union to do, as he saw it, the same thing but on a bigger scale. Federal politics was the next step up.\n\nMcEwen climbed up the Country Party quickly; he became a minister, then deputy leader of the Country Party, then leader. Country activism came naturally. All he had to do was stand straighter than his company and stick to his guns. In a party of free-traders, McEwen became known as an advocate of protectionist economics and agricultural-industrial development, vaulting into rage-filled outbursts when his steady fund of patience wore out. Now, having endured the full tenure of a deposed prime minister, McEwen weathers the storm at the top of the mountain, stone-faced and obstinate, trying to enforce a sense of calm.\n\nBut the stress is adding up. All the arguments, all the travel, all the labor, all the years filing him down, are working him from top to bottom. The skin on his feet, hands, and chest has grown scaly and dry. Whenever he walks, his skin cracks and his feet bleed. He'll change bandages during the day and get on with his work. It's what the country needs. Hard yakka makes a hard man, and John McEwen reckons it's only right that Australia's hardest man does Australia's hardest yakka. The rough and ready life is the only life worth living.\n\n§VYou've just gotta work through the pain.§!"
POLITICS_GOUGH_WHITLAM_DESC: "Gough Whitlam is a massive man with a massive ego, a massive brain, and a massive, massive plan. Whitlam has spent the better part of the sixties raging against the Labor Party's old-style social conservatives to advocate a new program of radical reform. He kept dissenting even when it broke party rules and the higher-ups threatened expulsion. He kept going, he says, because people either crash through or crash. He couldn't go any other way because his conscience wouldn't allow it. He couldn't accept the current state of things because all of it is so embarrassing, because all of it is so wrong. So, with a new generation of middle-class reformers behind him, Whitlam crashed through.\n\nGough Whitlam, the Prime Minister of Australia, is a compassionate, moral man who bludgeons people with his intellect. He is inflexible and withdrawn, belittling as often as he consults. Few in the Federal Parliament can challenge him in debate or knowledge of the issues he selects for remediation. His opponents call him arrogant. Whitlam agrees and insists that they are ignorant. Enraged, his opponents ask him how he would face God at the end of his life. Whitlam says they can all be sure he'll treat Him as an equal.\n\nWhitlam will turn the House floor into an anvil upon which he will hammer progressive legislation into being and reactionary MPs into oblivion. No one should have to suffer the products of ignorance. Within the next three years, so Whitlam swears, Australians will enjoy universal healthcare, free university, legalized abortion, recognition of Aboriginal land rights, freedom from conscription, and sweeping constitutional reform to enshrine new fundamental rights. All of that, Whitlam swears, and so much more, when he crashes through again.\n\n§P"They are lofty, I am eminent."§!"
POLITICS_WILLIAM_MCMAHON_DESC: "The telephone sitting on the Prime Minister of Australia's desk is beige and glossy and new. Before William McMahon, calls came into the Prime Minister's office through a row of telephonists tucked between hardwood partitions in the northeastern corridor of Parliament House. Now, every call comes through McMahon. Every scheme comes through McMahon. Every friendly message from a media magnate comes through McMahon, and every policy order comes from McMahon. He can hardly think to part with it all, Tiberius With a Telephone and his network for deregulation.\n\nWilliam McMahon is the Liberal Party's specialist on economic matters. His overscrupulous memoranda have been read aloud in Parliament House many times and debated in party rooms many times more. Liberal Members of Parliament know well, though, to scrutinize every word that comes out of McMahon's mouth. He is a brilliant administrator and a knowledgeable economist, undoubtedly, but he dispenses half-truths, exaggerations, and lies more frequently than anything else. He is stiff and uncharismatic, nervous, and intense; a tireless advocate for financial deregulation, budget-balancing, and progressive innovation wherever the budget permits. His challenge is getting the Parliament to trust him when things come to a vote.\n\nNow, William McMahon sits at his desk, rapping his fingers on the handpiece of his telephone. He knows that the person who picks up won't trust him. He knows that wrangling the Senate and the House and the public will be as hard as a fresh-cut diamond. That's fine. He's not above putting in a few extra hours."
POLITICS_MALCOLM_FRASER_DESC: "Born to Victorian sheep farmers, Malcolm Fraser originally intended to continue the family business, going to school for economics and philosophy. However, a fateful meeting of the Young Liberals in Hamilton in the early 50s changed Fraser's career, and he soon found himself enraptured by Australian politics.\n\nHis time in the party has been rough, losing his first election, only to find success a year later. Slowly Fraser built up his standing in the party, cycling through a series of party positions and cabinet ministers over the years. Finally, having battled and won against Billy Snedden in a party leadership spill, he now finds himself both the leader of his party and all of Australia.\n\nPolitically, Fraser is a supporter of multiculturalism, standing with the oppressed people of the Sphere that might see Australia as a refuge from tyranny, and a continuation of the nation's welfare state, even if heavy on the purse. All progress should come at a measured pace, and Fraser is not about to stop the steady pace that got him where he is today. More than anything though, he is a staunch hawk in foreign policy and is willing to do anything to see fascism repelled both at home and abroad."
POLITICS_JIM_CAIRNS_DESC: "Much has changed in Australia, to have James Ford Cairns serve as Prime Minister of that island nation at the hour in which he finds himself. Cairns shall seize the moment and do what he can to bring about his concept of a better nation.\n\nCairns, a socialist from very early on, was born to a family whose father went to war and did not return. He served as a policeman from 1933 to 1944, then joined the Labour Party, where he continued on his career, promoting his concept of socialism and doing what parliamentarians did—until it all changed and he found himself Prime Minister.\n\nThe new Prime Minister is a socialist adherent of the so-called New Left. By profession an economist and deeply attached to theory, he is not so far into theory that he loses track of reality; he is rightly commended for his administrative skills. He is not one to change his behaviour for anyone; everyone gets the "full Jim", who is typically polite but forthright about his wishes.\n\nThough he is not violent, he is committed to his views; this combined with his public sympathy for the more psychological and spiritual elements of Australian counterculture may lead to grating against some Australian institutions. But Cairns is certain that he will be able to do what he can regardless; time shall tell the truth of his views."
POLITICS_BILLY_SNEDDEN_DESC: "Born in Perth to an illiterate mother and a father who fled from Scotland to escape the law. Few ever thought Billy Snedden would amount to much, but he was no quitter. At the age of 8 he worked in construction with his brothers, helping out any way he could. In 1942 at only 15 he landed a job as a junior law clerk, paving the way for his entry into politics.\n\nOfficially entering the political arena in 1954 as a Liberal member for the House of Representatives, he served in the Cabinet of Robert Menzies until their eventual defeat in 1961. As a member of the opposition he was made Shadow Minister for Immigration. There he made a name for himself as an extremely effective legislator, and a hawk internationally.\n\nIn 1971 he challenged the leadership of the Liberal Party. Seen as a dark horse candidate by most MP's, Unexpectedly not only did Snedden defeat his main competition in Malcom Fraser, he utterly bulldozed him, becoming leader of the Liberal Party. Campaigning against Labor, Snedden promised to strengthen Australian democracy.\n\nWinning the election after a brutal campaign, the first thing on the Prime Minister's agenda is to reform the culture of Parliament. His detractors doubt his time in the top job will amount to much, but Billy Snedden is no quitter."
