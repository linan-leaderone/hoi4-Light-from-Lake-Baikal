 RUS_murmansk_crisis_category: "The §BMurmansk Crisis§!"
 RUS_murmansk_crisis_category_desc: "The Russian people of Karelia are tired of living under Finnish occupation, and, as West Russia became unified under our banner, they saw a chance to rejoin the Motherland and rose in revolt. Now, the Murmansk People's Republic fights against numerical superior forces and better equipped troops, and without our support their days are counted. While the Finnish Army is smaller compared to ours, it is better organized and has the support of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard in Onega. To intervene in Karelia, we must first organize our forces and prepare them for war, while we will send covert support to Murmansk via the Barents Sea to resist the Finnish offensive. Once we have accumulated enough §BPreparedness§!, we can launch a full intervention and join the war in support of Murmansk.\n\nCurrent §BPreparedness:§!
