  GER_CountryInfo_Content.1: "The Final Victory"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "In all of history, many men have come to dominate Europe. Augustus Caesar, Charles V, Napoleon. Yet no man nor nation has ever laid their enemies low so decisively nor governed with such evil a purpose as §rAdolf Hitler§! and the §WGroßgermanisches Reich§!.\n\nWith the world prostrated before her, §WGermany§! is master of Europe. The true extent of her power stretches far beyond her borders, for no corner of Earth was left untouched by the §WReich§!'s victory or its consequences. Free to indulge in its §rNational Socialist§! dogma, the §WReich§! has spent the last decades striving for its brutal final goals - the making of an Aryan utopia and the exploitation and destruction of countless "Untermenschen" in the way. As §rHitler§! ages, though, the troubles of this system grow impossible to ignore. Its constant, structural cruelty, paired with complacent incompetence, has fractured the very foundation of the nation. What happens when the last bonds which tie the §WReich§! together fade away?"
 
  GER_CountryInfo_Content.2: "Der Krieg"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "§WGermany§!'s greatest test would come on September 1st, 1939, when the jackboots of the Wehrmacht stormed across the Polish border. Within two years, the entire continent and far beyond was embroiled in the greatest war ever seen. What stunned most observers more than sheer scale, however, was the utter and total success of the Axis in its fight against the rest of the world.\n\nPoland was the first to collapse under the weight of the Blitzkrieg. Numerous Allied nations soon followed her. Finally, two titanic struggles broke out in Europe, more brutal and devastating than any campaign before - the gigantic battles of the Eastern Front and the slow grind of Operation Sea Lion. Even in the face of these enormous challenges, however, the §WReich§! was unstoppable. The massive resources poured into Britain and Russia were not enough to prevent their collapse, and the atom bomb forced America from the war soon after. §rHitler§!, once a destitute veteran in Munich, now had all of Europe in his fist. The §WReich§! was §Gvictorious§!."
 
  GER_CountryInfo_Content.3: "Der Frieden"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "By the end of 1945, §WGermany§! was the unquestionable master of Europe. Her empire stretched from Marseille to Arkhangelsk. Alongside puppet governments in the west, brutal Reichskommissariats were created in the east, cruel colonial governments which entwined greedy resource extraction with the final, genocidal goal of §RLebensraum§!. It was this complete hegemony which further fed the bloodthirsty, demonic machine, accelerating the deterioration of §WGerman§! dominance.\n\nOverlooked in the expenses, however, were the equally vast number of §Rfurious enemies§! organizing across the borders, as well as the increasingly distressing financial reports or cooling diplomatic relations. All at once, the walls fell in - the economy collapsed, §WGermany§!'s distant allies severed their ties, and the §eWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! surged over the eastern frontier in unthinkable numbers. The §eWest Russian War§! had §Rbegun.§!"
 
  GER_CountryInfo_Content.4: "Der Kampf"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "The §eWest Russian War§! would tear away the veneer of §WGerman§! invincibility with all the rage it deserved. The §jHeer§!, revered at home for so long, was routed by §eRussian "Untermenschen"§! armed with inferior equipment and less resources. As the spearheads of the §eWest Russians§! blew apart resistance, the East collapsed into total chaos. When §WGerman§! forces fled Paulusburg, the §WThousand Year Reich§! teetered on oblivion.\n\nIn such a desperate environment, it was no surprise that the shadowy §EHeinrich Himmler and his SS§! would make an attempt to seize the reins of state. However, the §jHeer§! broke up the conspiracy before it had a chance to fully fire, leading to the destruction and exile of much of the §ESS§! to the §EOrdenstaat§! and the turning of the tide in the East. §eThe Front§!, exhausted by its push, finally ran out of steam and collapsed under the weight of the reorganized §WGerman§! forces. By the skin of its teeth, §WGermany§! had survived another close call - but the rot had been exposed, and it would not be removed so easily."
 
  GER_CountryInfo_Content.5: "Stillstand"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "The §WGerman Reich§! had survived its closest call yet, but the trouble which plagued it remained. With its eastern holdings in shambles and the economy in the gutter, it would take years for §WGermany§!'s slave-driven economic schemes to even restore a stagnant equilibrium. Meanwhile, the Heer used its defeats as a way to divert even more funds to its bloated coffers while ignoring the troubles which plagued it. §rHitler§!, himself weakening in strength, increasingly lost control of his four most powerful subordinates - §LBormann§!, §OSpeer§!, §gGöring§!, and §PHeydrich§!.\n\nThe §GGerman eagle§! no longer soars. It trundles along, weighed down by its §Rcomplete moral bankruptcy§!. Corruption, vanity, and wanton cruelty are the mottos of her administrators, and the increasingly desperate people seek any sort of solution for their woes. The hate which the §WReich§! exports is finally turning inwards, and all that remains to hold the people together is a fading, senile §rHitler§!. What will happen when his time is up?"
 
  # 102
  GER_CountryInfo_Content.6: "He With Power"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "He With Power- The §rFührer§! is §WGermany§!, and §WGermany§! is the §rFührer§!. That is the party line, the truth the §rNSDAP§! set in the world and that §rHitler§! finally confirmed in the course of the §RSecond World War§!. When victory came, it did so in glory the §WReich§! had not seen in close to a century - her eternal enemies beaten, crushed under the greatest war-machine the world had ever seen. §rHitler§! became the lynchpin of this glory and to this day his name is written with any mention of it, alongside §Rthose innumerable crimes committed in the process§!. What followed was a decade of §Gprosperity and power§!, where the §WReich§! stood as the unquestioned hegemon of the world - and utter despair and tragedy in the years after, where the people saw it all crumble to dust. The §rFührer§! is not there to notice it, however. Though his eyes still see and his voice still rasps, the sharpness and instinct is gone, and the strength is following. It will not be long until §WGermany§!'s most consequential leader §Rleaves it behind.§!"
  
  GER_CountryInfo_Content.7: "Those Within"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.7: "Beyond §rHitler§!'s grasp lies the vast overgrowth of bureaucracy which dominates modern Germania, bloated and fat on its blood-stained treasures. Within its concrete facade lies a morass of back-stabbing and immoral ambition. In this political viper's nest, only the smartest and strongest men can thrive.\n\nToday's establishment politics are dominated by §LMartin Bormann§!, §rHitler§!'s right-hand man with a nose for power and a complete lack of a moral compass. His weaseling and conniving has firmly planted him as the leader of the conservative majority. He is not without challenge, however. §OAlbert Speer§!, a sharp schemer in his own right, has turned himself into a leader of those in §WGermany§! who cry out for reform to the broken system.\n\nIf all was to go to plan, it would be one of these men who would become the next §rFührer§! - but every day makes it more and more clear that succession will not be so orderly."
  
  GER_CountryInfo_Content.8: "Those Without"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.8: "Though being outside of Germania means an ambitious politician has less opportunity to wheel and deal, the Volkshalle's endless scheming means that avoiding the morass has its own benefits. Such is the idea for those who style themselves as the next Führer, dodging the swamp in favor of forging their own path to power.\n\n§gHermann Göring§!, the charismatic ace of years past, has found himself the leader of the powerful §Lmilitarist§! faction. His popularity with the citizenry grants him widespread appeal - something §PReinhard Heydrich§!, deputy leader of the §ESS§!, could not be further from. His power comes from fear and the shadowy backing of §Ehis superior, Heinrich Himmler§!. Though few see him as the next §rFührer§!, that hasn't stopped him and his supporters from trying.\n\nThese outside candidates surely believe in their ability to lead, but it may be more prudent for them to dust off their military experience first."
  
  GER_CountryInfo_Content.9: "Those Who Command"
  GER_CountryInfo_Content_desc.9: "In the chaotic self-devouring nature of the §WReich's§! politics, little stands above the melee. The §jHeer§!, those proud defenders of the §WFatherland§!, are no exception. While they portray themselves as supreme Aryan leaders and warriors, the truth of the matter is that the armed forces are as involved in the power plays and the scheming as any.\n\nThe modern Heer is primarily split between §Qmoderates§! and §Lmilitarists§!, respectively led by §QHans Speidel§! and §LFerdinand Schörner§!. On §QSpeidel's§! side lie men like §QHenning von Tresckow and Dietrich von Saucken§!, united in their opposition to the blatant tinkering of the §Lmilitarists§!. For their part, the §LMilitarists§! lay claim to men like §LOtto Remer and Hermann Göring§! - driven, ambitious bloodhounds who wish to reach glory through conquest.\n\nBoth sides are inexorably opposed to one another, more focused on defeating their internal rivals than protecting the §WReich§! itself. Will they truly be ready?"

  BRG_CountryInfo_Folder.101: "The Black Stain"
  BRG_CountryInfo_Folder.102: "Mechanics"

  # 101
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content.1: "The Black Stain"
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "§WThe SS-Ordensstaat Burgund§! is the youngest state in the Einheitspakt, cobbled together with lands from the §QFrench§! and §YBelgian§! territories of the Reich in order to placate §PReichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler§!. During the West Russian War, Himmler attempted to launch a coup against the ailing Führer §RAdolf Hitler§!, whom §PHimmler§! saw as a decrepit fool who was driving the Reich into chaos. However, §RHans Speidel§! and the Wehrmacht were able to crush the coup, forcing §RHitler§! to find a punishment for his once-loyal follower. It came in the form of §Wthe Ordensstaat§!, a white elephant that would hopefully keep the SS too busy managing in order to plot. How wrong he was. §PHimmler§! has spent the past several years consolidating his power and ousting anyone in the administration who was not utterly loyal to him, and now he is ready to strike and succeed where he once failed. But even the best-laid plans may go awry..."
 
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content.2: "The SS Within"
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "§WThe Ordensstaat§! is dominated by the SS, who are predominately loyal to §PHimmler§! above all. However, no man rules alone. The native German SS are joined by various collaborators: the §YSS-Legion Wallonien§!, led by the Walloon §RLéon Degrelle§!, the §OSS-Legion Langemarck§!, led by the Flemish §RBert Eriksson§!, and the §QSS-Division Charlemagne§!, led by the French §RChristian de la Mazière§!. All of these factions despise one another and vie for power, sometimes jockeying with one another and sometimes threatening to undermine the rule of the §PReichsführer-SS§!. If there is to be any hope of success, §Rthe collaborators must be kept on a close leash§!."
 
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content.3: "The SS Without"
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "Thankfully, not everyone in the Reich is an enemy. §gReinhard Heydrich§! is as loyal as ever to §PHimmler§!, and more importantly, he resides in Germania, leads the SS in Germany, and has §RHitler§!'s ear. It is no secret that the old Führer is not long for this world, and §gHeydrich§! is poised to sweep in and seize power should some terrible tragedy befall the great leader. If he were to succeed, it would §Ggreatly expedite§! the fulfillment of the §PReichsführer-SS§!'s vision for the Aryan race..."
 
  # 102
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content.4: "Mechanics"
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "Manage the §Yworkforce§!, carefully maintaining a balance between §WSicherheitspolizei§! and §Wskilled laborers§! in the §WOrdensstaat§!'s territories.\n\n- Launch §Yinvestigations§! into §Rtraitors§! who may be lurking in the ranks of the Waffen-SS.\n\nBring the story of the §qBlack Stain§! of Europe to its §econclusion§!."
  
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content.5: "The Workforce"
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "§WThe SS-Ordensstaat Burgund§! does not meekly stand by and wait for workers to toil of their own free will, it §Vcommands§!. The §Yworkforce§! consists of those §Wskilled laborers§! torn from their homes to slave away in the greater interests of the state which cannot be fulfilled by simple coerced labour, and must be managed accordingly to ensure that there is an even balance between the oppressed and their oppressors. They may be moved around like cattle from the reserve to any state, but mind that they do not find themselves in an underpoliced, unwatched area.\n\n§WThe Sicherheitspolizei§!, meanwhile, are the sword and shield of the state, and are critical to ensuring that the skilled labour act as they are dictated. They, too, may be moved from reserve barracks to states where they are needed."
  
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content.6: "Investigations"
  BRG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "The §ESS§!, whilst representing the pinnacle of Aryan rebirth, does not draw solely from German blood. Men from the Walloon, Flemish, and French nations have, too, returned to the fold of Europa - or have they?\n\nLaunch §Yinvestigations§! into the leaders of the §YSS-Legion Wallonien§!, §OSS-Legion Langemarck§!, and the §QSS-Division Charlemagne§! - collect evidence, watch the shadows carefully, and ensure the §PReichsführer-SS's§! eternal dominance - lest the §Rimpostors§! lurking among us in the garb of dedicated National Socialists strike when we least expect it."

  #101 - Introduction
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.1: "Introduction"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "Spanning three continents, and occupying a central place in the Mediterranean Sea, the §nItalian Empire§! is a major European power, and de facto leader of the §KTriumvirate§!, a military alliance uniting the country with the §wIberian Federation§! and the §VRepublic of Turkey§!.\n\nAs the second European economic and military power after the §rGerman Reich§!, §nItaly§! is locked with its former ally in a fight for dominance over Southern Europe. Politically, §nItaly§! is at the same time a constitutional monarchy, headed by §mUmberto II§!, Emperor of Ethiopia and King of Italy, Albania and Tunisia, and a one-party state, ruled by the iron fist of §BGaleazzo Ciano§!, Duce of Fascism and Prime Minister of the §nItalian Empire§!.\n\nWhile the state propaganda depicts the Empire as stable and prosperous, the truth is §Rfar less pleasant§!. How did this come to pass? How did §nItaly§! become the §Wfourth world power§!, only to lag behind, and become a shadow of what it aspired to be? Read along, and discover..."
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.2: "Rise of Fascism"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "Starting as loosely-organized bands of strike-breakers and syndicalist-beaters, §iBenito Mussolini's§! creation eventually coalesced into the §jNational Fascist Party§!. Feeding on the fear of §ecommunist§! agitation and the outrage at the loss of Dalmatia at the §WVersailles Conference§!, the §jPNF§! soon expanded its influence through relentless propaganda and political violence: feeling powerful enough to take power by force, the §jfascists§! descended on Rome, and the fearful §MKing Victor Emmanuel III§! quickly appointed §iMussolini§! as Prime Minister.\n\nFrom then on, §iMussolini§! set upon the task of reshaping his country in a way that suited his dream of power and glory. §nItaly§! became a §Wtotalitarian§!, §Wcorporatist§!, §Wmilitarist§! state - effectively summarized in the phrase "everything within the State, nothing outside of the State, nothing against the State" - and began an expansionist drive, culminating in the invasion, and brutal annexation, of §WEthiopia§!."
  #102 - WWII
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.3: "Slow Beginning"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "United by common struggle against both §ecommunism§! and decadent §Dliberal democracy§!, fascist Italy and §rnazi Germany§! soon became closer and closer. Despite the opposition of a few prominent Italian fascists, Italy joined the §WSecond World War§!, in a bid to achieve its historical claims over Dalmatia by right of conquest.\n\nDespite the boisterous claims, the war went poorly for Italian armed forces from the very beginning. Ill equipped and poorly led, the Regio Esercito struggled in the initial invasion of §WFrance§!, stalled in the push towards §WEgypt§!, and was immediately forced on the defensive in §WEast Africa§!, while the Regia Marina found itself outnumbered and outgunned by the might of the Royal Navy: it would take months of painful lessons, and plenty of §rGerman§! aid, to reverse this shameful situation. The war in the §WMare Nostrum§! would end with the British Mediterranean fleet, starved of fuel and ammunition and weakened by days of bombings, finally defeated near Cyprus by Italy's first converted carrier."
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.4: "Triumph"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "When the fascist eagle descended upon §MGreece§! the stalwart §MGreek§! army resisted well on the Albanian border, but Italian naval supremacy led to the shelling of §WAthens§! and its direct amphibious invasion, crippling the country and eventually forcing its capitulation.\n\nWith all its claims occupied, Italy would then participate with a token force in Operation Barbarossa. The subsequent §Wcollapse§! of the §eSoviet Union§!, the occupation of §WBritain§!, and finally the §Wnuclear bombing§! of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, ended the war: thus, Italy participated to the peace conference as a victor, earning itself the §WEmpire§! it had always desired."
  #103 - Postwar Italy
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.5: "End of the Axis"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "Before and during the war, many had warned §iMussolini§! of the risks involved in accepting an alliance with §rGermany§!. The Duce ignored them, adamant in his will to ensure Italy would get a place at the peace conference: this attitude would, however, quickly change in the years that followed the peace.\n\nThe first crack in the §rAxis§! was the planned §rGerman§! invasion of §WSwitzerland§!. As the last bastion of democracy in Europe, the small Alpine country was deemed too much of an eyesore by Hitler: it was then, that §iMussolini§! understood that the §rGermans§! were preparing to surround Italy, and turn it into another puppet. The following §WTreaty of Campione d'Italia§!, included a formal Italian §Wguarantee§! of Swiss independence, granted Italy a valuable buffer state, but enraged the §rReich§!.\n\nSlowly but steadily, the alliance fell under constant infighting. The matter of the §WUstase§!, §rGermany's§! anger at the §Woil§! discovery in the Gulf, the §WKenya§! border dispute and many, many others, led to the Axis's death by a thousand cuts."
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.6: "Birth of the Triumvirate"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "As tensions with the §rReich§! mounted, the aging §iBenito Mussolini§! was growing increasingly worried about the possibility of a war against §rGermany§!. As such, he tasked §BGaleazzo Ciano§!, then-foreign minister, with finding allies: thus, the §KTriumvirate§! alliance was born.\n\nInitially formed by Italy and §WTurkey§!, itself worried about §rGerman§! expansionism in §WKaukasien§! and the §WBlack Sea§!, the alliance then expanded to §WIberia§! in 1957. A military and economic alliance, the §KTriumvirate§! aimed at ensuring mutual defense and shared domination over Southern Europe.\n\nThe early Fifties were the §WGolden Age§! for the §nItalian Empire§!. Protected by an alliance, and fueled by the rich oil fields discovered in the Gulf Governorate by §WEnrico Mattei§! and his §WENI§!, Italy's economy grew, and with it, its power: this, however, planted the seeds of future §Rproblems§!, as abundance naturally leads to §Rwaste§!, and waste naturally lead to §Rcorruption§!."
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.7: "New Duce's Woes"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.7: "§iBenito Mussolini§! peacefully passed away in 1953, and the mantle of Duce went to his chosen successor, §BGaleazzo Ciano§!. With the charismatic founder of fascism no longer leading the nation, the cracks on the façade began showing: unwilling to address §iMussolini's§! mistakes - or rather, completely refusing to consider them as such - §BCiano§! sent Italy into a spiral of economic and political §Rdownturn§!.\n\nStruggling to maintain his grip on power in a country that progressively started to lose faith in its leader's capabilities, §BCiano§! progressively increased §Wrepression§!, while resorting to §Wboot-lickers§! and §Wsycophants§! to man the machine of the state. Disloyal, or simply controversial, bureaucrats were routinely sent far away from the mainland, either to the colonies or as diplomatic envoys into Italy's puppets: stacking the offices with loyal stooges, however, can only solve issues up to a §Rlimit§!."
  #104 - Situation in 1962
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.8: "Empire"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.8: "The colonial empire is far from stable. With every passing day, §Runrest§! grows, and the §Rundermanned§! garrisons exert less and less control: §WViceroy Amadeo of Savoy§! keeps the ship stable with his personal charisma, which commands respect even from locals, but the situation might soon grow worse than what the aging Hero of Amba Alagi can manage.\n\nThe §KTriumvirate§! has developed the same flaws of the §rAxis§!: Italy's poorly-concealed attempts at becoming more than a "primus inter pares" for the §KTriumvirate§! constituents, as well as the constant bickering between Italy and Turkey on the issue of the §WLevant§! are a pressing concern.\n\nUnrest mounts in the mosaic of §Wpuppets§! and §Wreliant regimes§! within Italy's sphere of influence created at the end of the Second World War: in §WCroatia§! and §WGreece§!, the collaborationist governments barely control the capital and major cities, while §WEgypt§! and §WIraq§! grow uncomfortable with Italian economic and political dominance."
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content.9: "Politics"
  ITA_CountryInfo_Content_desc.9: "The rule of §BGaleazzo Ciano§! is not even safe from the inside. The Duce's ineffectual rule has turned against him large sectors of the §jPNF§!, with some saying that §BCiano's§! tenure is soon to end: should this happen, a radical change in course for the §Wvery essence of fascism§! may be in the making.\n\nMeanwhile, the Emperor weaves his web of influence. Adored by the people and the Army, §mUmberto II§! is slowly setting the stage to challenge the Duce - or is he? The Emperor is as mute on matters of politics as his Corazzieri bodyguards, but as they say, still waters run deep...\n\nDespite this all, the §nItalian Empire§! is still a power in its own right. Boasting a §Wlarge economy§!, a §Wpowerful army§! and an §Wextensive sphere of influence§!, Italy has not yet entered irreversible decline, and can yet come back as a world-influencing actor: all it needs, is for someone to §Wtake the reins§!, end the stagnation, and bring much-needed change to the Country of Crossed Destinies."

Accordingly, §nBrazilian§! ships, civilian and military, were torpedoed by U-boats under the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. This led §sVargas§! to lead §nBrazil§! into joining the Allies in 1942.\n\nThree army divisions formed the §nBrazilian§! §wExpeditionary§! §MForce§!, which arrived in Britain and fought the §qGermans§! when Sealion was launched. Under the leadership of generals such as §sCastelo Branco§! and §MHenrique Lott§!, the "Smoking Snakes" fought well; however, it was not enough.

Trade embargoes and American economic downturns combined with inflation to create a disaster.\n\nThis combined with §sVargas'§! hypocrisy of sending troops to fight for democracy while running an authoritarian dictatorship at home led to a loss of civil and military support. In 1949, successes such as the formation of Petrobras were disrupted by the attempted assassination of the journalist §BCarlos Lacerda§!, ordered by one of §sVargas'§! men without his knowledge.\n\nIn response to the resulting chaos the military launched a coup. §sVargas§! at first stated he would resist it and nearly shot himself; in the end, he resigned and fled to São Paulo.

One of his first acts as President was to use so-called 'National Security Laws' to ban the §ePCB§! after its surprise success in the elections.\n\n§BGomes'§! prime aims were to deal with the economic crisis and align with the §iU.S§!. He acted to slow inflation, attracted §iU.S.§! and other private investment, and rebuffed §BLacerda's§! demands to privatize Petrobras. He also increased the size of the military and allowed America access to bases in the north.\n\nBut §BGomes§! also signed the party's death warrant in one foolish move. In 1953, acting with the backing of the §BUDN§!, he abolished the minimum wage implemented by §sVargas§! post-WW2. This caused a mass popular revolt, sunk §BGomes'§! attempt to join the §iOFN§!, and ultimately lost the 1955 election. The Varguists regained power under §MJuscelino Kubitschek§! of the §MPSD§!."

This has garnered a lot of support but met with resistance from natives and §BLacerda§!, who calls it typical Varguist waste.\n\nFinally, in 1961 §MLott§! was faced with coffee strikes paralysing one of the largest sectors of the §nBrazilian§! economy. To get the strikes to end for the time being, he pledged—despite his own views—to push through land reform. How this succeeds or fails will no doubt be a determining factor of his administration."

The §P"Chinese-Japanese War"§!, the §z"War of Resistance"§! or the "Second Sino-Japanese War" are only some of the names that describe the Empire's invasion. However, to those that lived and died through it, only one could encapsulate the conditions of the struggle. §VHell§!. Stiff Chinese resistance - in no small part due to the armistice that leaders §CMao Zedong§! and §QChiang Kai-Shek§! had signed - prompted Japan to take crueller measures to tame the land they occupied.

Second, close relationships and gifts from the §Glocal landlords§! - at worst flat-out bribery - make him less and less concerned about the welfare of the average people - of §WYunnan§!.

Unlike the §RTatars§!, they harbor ambitions of expansion and may cause problems in the future if left unchecked. To the east lies the warlord of §GGayny§!. Relations with §GGayny§! have mostly been cordial, and it may be possible to sway them to the cause.\n\nThe §WPrincipality of Vyatka§! now stands poised to undertake the arduous task of uniting Russia once and for all.

  SAM_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "In the bloodiest days of the West Russian War, when it seemed like the Reich's hold on Russia was on the verge of slipping forever, the German high command turned to desperate means to stave off the collapse of their front line. Drawn from a range of auxiliary colonial militias of Russian conscripts that were meant to police German-held Russia, the §WRussian Liberation Army§! or §WROA§! was created. In propaganda, the §WROA§! was depicted as a proud Russian army, fighting the §RBolshevik§! menace of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§!. In desperation, the Germans even allowed the creation of the §WCommittee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia§!, or §WKONR§!, as the embryo of a free Russian Republic that would rule over areas liberated by the German counter offensives."

  SAM_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "Reality was much less flattering to the §WROA§!. Its leader §WAndrey Vlasov§!, a former Red Army general, was nothing more than a puppet of the Wehrmacht's high command. His officers were a disjointed bunch. Many were also captured Red Army officers, preferring to join the §WROA§! than die in a German POW camp. Others were fascist émigrés, joining the §WROA§! on a great crusade to defeat §RBolshevism§!. The common soldiers were desperate cannon fodder, drafted at gunpoint by the Germans and sent to reinforce the most desperate sectors of the front. Far from being welcomed as liberators, Russian people caught in the conflict area welcomed §WROA§! soldiers with rock and insults."

Soon the §WROA§! found itself beyond the German lines, freed from their former taskmasters. With the war winding down and the §RWRRF§! in retreat, the Germans wrote off their cannon fodder as mutinous Slav Untermensch. The new headquarters of the §WROA§! in Samara were not spared any of the terror bombing campaigns that followed. Since then the §WROA§! has huddled in Samara, having traded one prison for another. Unable to expand their area of control by the terror bombings, and forbidden to go back home in the west, the common soldiers of the army have languished for the better part of a decade in their garrisons."

However the officers are not all united in ideology. Quite a few have formed a pro-democracy faction, and argue that §WVlasov's§! heir as chairman of §WKONR§! should be §WMiletiy Zykov§!, a former journalist that has maneuvered his way into being the chief propagandist of the §WROA's§! regime in Samara. Zykov argues for the continued struggle to liberate Russia from §RBolshevism§! as well as German oppression. In between all this, many common soldiers and lower ranking officers have grown tired of the high command's bickering and seek to follow General §WOktan's§! goal to use the §WROA§! to build a strong, fascist state... and to enrich the soldiers in the process."

Across the former territory of the Soviet Union, loyal §GRed Army§! units flocked to his banner, including the Sixth and Ninth Armies under Marshals §GMikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky§! and §GGeorgy Konstantinovich Zhukov§!, respectively. With these powerful mechanized forces and an alliance with prominent political figures the newly formed §WWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! was able to exert authority over all of the shattered remnants of the Union which remained west of the Urals."

Despite Lazar Kaganovich refusing to commit the forces of the West Siberian People's Republic to the operation, the §GRed Army§!'s advance was swift and brutal.

  IRE_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "For the first time in a very long time, Ireland is free. Subjugated under the heel of the English Tudors in 1603, for generations, all that the men and women of Ireland ever knew were that they were second-class citizens in the nation they lived in. Kings and Queens came and went, but the one of the only constants in the winding avenues of the history of the British Isles was London's complete domination. All this changed on one fateful day in 1919.\n\nThe British Empire had been brought to its breaking limit by the carnage of the First World War. Entire generations - including thousands of Irish volunteers - were fed to the meat grinders. In 1916, the §nIrish Republican Brotherhood§! launched a six-day blitz in Dublin against the Empire, declaring a new Irish Republic. While the "Easter Rising" was suppressed by the British Army, what it couldn't do was break the spirits of the Irish people."

Under the leadership of §nÉamon de Valera§! and the military guidance of §DMichael Collins§!, Ireland once again tried her hand at obtaining independence from England. Enfeebled by the First World War, Britain failed to contain the growing guerrilla war that raged on. Locked in stalemate, Britain acquiesced and granted them their sovereignty. But in what would become the first in a series of flashpoints, §ONorthern Ireland§! continued to fly the Union Jack as a constituent of Britain.\n\nThis fact, and the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown that Ireland was forced to swear, became the catalyst of the Irish Civil War. The Anti-Treaty forces, led by de Valera faced off against the pro-Treaty Collins. Where the Irish People's guns were once united, now they were turned against each other, with every act of barbarity committed by both sides."

Both Michael Collins and Liam Lynch - the Chief of Staff of the IRA - were dead, killed in pitched gunfights, where their killers could not be identified or know what they had done. Peace returned to the Emerald Isle. Yet, it would not stay for long.\n\nFailing to convince the ruling §KSinn Féin§! to abandon the Oath of Allegiance to the British Monarchy, de Valera formed the §yFianna Fáil§!. Ascending to the "Taoiseach" in 1937, de Valera and Ireland as a whole found themselves a member of a Europe that was dousing themselves in gasoline. For De Valera, the question was not "if" War broke out, but "who" to align with when they did. When the Nazi Blitzkrieg overran nearly all of Free Europe, the answer was clear."

However, with the collapse of Britain, resistance to Dublin fell.\n\nNot only overseas, where Ireland's commitment to the §qEinheitspakt§! has brought uncomfortable truths forwards to Irish society.

While Fianna Fáil are the dominant party inside the Dáil, factionalism and inner party politics means that each wing of the FF is effectively a political party in its own right, that needs to be wooed or quelled.\n\nThe FF are not alone.

Hesitant to allow any German influence the Republic, Corish and the LP are focused on uplifting the rights of the Irish Working Class, much to the chagrin of the Hardliners and Moderates inside the Dáil.

Composed of avowed communists and socialists, the Marxist Caucus sees the average American as exploited by the capitalist class and the current fight over civil rights to be a symptom of a larger class struggle.\n\nEven smaller and more fringe than the §VMarxists§! are the §jSovereigntists§!, a vile group of fascists and white nationalists. Few but the most radicalized Americans would dare associate themselves with them.

The Reformist Thaw that gripped the Union had made it into an economic powerhouse. Portugal's nautical infrastructure and §iOFN investment§! shifted Iberia's policy of autarky into industrialisation. It appeared that the Union would become the Free World's most important player inside §LFestung Europa§!.\n\nWhat Iberia did not appear to be was a den of intrigue and candlelight plots. That was, until the §KGolpe d'Albufeira§!. Led by §nHumberto Delgado§!, the conspirators aimed to break apart the Iberian Union and restore Portugal's independence. However, before the plot could be put into action, it was discovered - along with its ties to Salazar.

Backed against a wall, §WThe Dominion of South Africa§! carefully slinks back and forth across the narrow tightrope of international diplomacy, speaking words of freedom and liberty to §GWashington§! and whispering promises of supremacy and segregation to the §RReich§!.\n\nSo it has been since the end of the Second World War.

The throne of §WSouth Africa§! lays dusty and barren, a dominion only in name, but far from a republic.\n\nAcross the aisle, the powerful orations of §RAlbert Hertzog§! echo out into the nation, attracting the Boer population to the National Party, a party established on cooperation with the §RReich§! and the domination of white §WSouth Africans§! over the black.

And once that happens, Sverdlovsk will rise from the ruins along with a free, disciplined Russia.\n\nWhen that happens, the Germans will §Vnever see them coming.§!"

 SVR_CountryInfo_Content.3: "The Marshal's Rule"
 SVR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "Sverdlovsk is less of an actual government with an ideology and a method of ruling, and more of a §gde-facto military dictatorship§!. It possesses no ideological inclinations, at least any major ones, and is more sustained by two things. The first is the omnipresence of the §VThird Army§! in life and in politics. There is no civilian administration, and what resources there are go towards maintaining the military garrison at all costs.\n\nThe second is the fact that Sverdlovsk's industry is still mostly §Kuntouched§! from the terror bombings. Due to their hardness, this has meant that Sverdlovsk is a beacon of civilisation and living standards in an otherwise devastated West Siberia. With these two factors in place, the populace is more than willing to overlook their decidedly un-Communist situation and place their support within the rule of the §zMarshal.§!"

While we dare not say it out loud, there will eventually come a time where Sverdlovsk is ruled by a new Marshal. While the choice is almost certainly going to be the (relatively) young commander §PPavel Batov§!, keeping said rule in place will be another thing altogether. Putting aside the threat posed by the other warlords, there are whispers of dissidents against the regime that seek nothing less but total democratisation.\n\nUnder the loose leadership of §MBoris Yeltsin§!, they seek a strong, but free Russia that operates for the people and is owned by the people. For now, they remain in the shadows. But they will rear their head eventually; when they do, the nation must decide what path it will go down."

While the annihilation of the Nazi is our goal, our quarrel is §wnot with the women and children§! of Germany but the §oideology§! they spout.\n\nMoreover, we have caught the plague.

It was a last-ditch attempt to try and preserve at least some of the freedom their neighbor was sure to lose under occupation.\n\nThe §gGerman Reich§!, sufficiently weakened by the ordeal of conquering and subduing the §zEnglish§!, accepted the independence of the new republic; however §GWelsh§! freedom came at a price. The deal made with the §gGermans§! has forced the §GWelsh§! government to send a substantial portion of its coal output to the §gReich§!.

The §BScottish§! people and §YSNP§! as a whole are distrustful of these immigrants, seeing them as oppressors who had controlled them for three hundred years.

Many of its members were arrested and detained by the §gGestapo§!; the others fled abroad, including to §BScotland§!.\n\nThe §BScottish§! branch of the §VLabour Party§! had to reform to stay afloat in its new home; as such, the §VIndependent Labour Party§! was formed.

This idea has been drilled into the §QArmed Forces§! and is something that the generals and admirals live by. §QWimberley§! is a smart man and will put everything on the line to protect Scottish independence and freedom as he sees it.

The dark highways of the Norwegian Autobahn cut through its picturesque fjord valleys. Secured in 1940 as a "protectorate against British invasion" by a vast combined-arms operation by the Wehrmacht, their control of the Kingdom of Norway would prove a persistent headache for the §qGerman§! government both during and after the war.\n\nUnlike their more cooperative cousins in Denmark, Norwegian civilians and military alike proved far less apathetic to the §qGerman§! intervention even in the early years of the occupation. This problem was compounded by the utter failure of the Wehrmacht to capture the King and cabinet in 1940, the royal family, and leading politicians escaping with the remnants of their navy to Scotland and beyond."

 NOR_CountryInfo_Content.2: "Cracks in the Fortress"
 NOR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "Without anyone to sign a formal surrender, the unstable military administration of von Falkenhorst would prove unable to effectively cope with continued civil disobedience and increasing partisan and commando activity from the locals.\n\nThe solution was a compromise government. A power-sharing agreement left the judicial, executive, and later legislative branches of government controlled by the native §oNational Unity (NS) Party§!, led by Minister-President Vidkun Quisling. The Reichskommissar is supposed to oversee §jNorway's§! eventual integration into the §qReich§!; however, Joseph Terboven was, much to his chagrin, left with little power besides that of the veto and the ability to pass executive orders."

 NOR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "After the war, Terboven was able to leverage §jRK Norwegen's§! contribution to the §qGerman§! nuclear program into solidifying his position. But Germanization was still limited due to the native Parliament, the Storting, ousting Quisling for his lies about the Germans withdrawing after the war and failure to secure the Kola peninsula for §jNorwegen§! in the peace settlement.

Lie is a useful tool for Terboven to contain the popularity and resentment of Lunde since the executive branch would be seriously hampered without a police force to enforce its edicts.\n\nHowever, with mounting challenges from dissidents and reformers, the traditional rural heartland Lunde's support is rooted in is eroding, and he feels pressured to take an increasingly hardline stance against the §qGermans§! he secretly loathes."

 NOR_CountryInfo_Content.5: "And If They Leave"
 NOR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "Should the §qGerman§! garrison be forced to withdraw, it is doubtful that Lie could maintain the status quo even with brute force. It is yet more doubtful that Lunde would even be bothered to try to maintain his servile facade without the threat of the garrison. The Germans have made multiple attempts to assassinate him over the years as an intervention against him harkening back to the nationalist days of the party. But they always failed and the status quo was inevitably restored, giving Lunde a firm grip on what power remains to him.\n\nShould a crisis emerge between Lie's national socialist true believers and the opposition, there is no telling if anti-Lie forces might make a move to throw Lie down as Riksfører. Worse yet (or better yet, depending on who you ask), the partisans of the §dMilorg§!

This is used to fund either industrial equipment meant to extract resources from areas that haven't been drowned by the §BCongo Lake§!, or military equipment used to fight any of the §Rhundreds of resistance groups§! that take advantage of Müller's anarchy. Officially, most of these resources are "lost" in pitched conflicts with partisans and when partisan bases are neutralised, most of the Reich's equipment is strangely missing. Unofficially, Müller trafficks his benefactor's gifts to a §sshadowy network of international agents and mysterious factory complexes§! and then sold at marked-up prices, alongside the black market of rare, exotic goods deep inside the jungle."

 COG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "What lies inside the Congo is Mankind's greatest mark of its existence on Planet Earth. To some, it is the epitome of everything wrong with the Nazi ideology. It is §lmadness§!, it is §fvainglory§!, it is §xpointless, barbaric and contradictory§!. To its supporters, it is proof that Humanity is more than just base animals, but §pGods§! in their own right, ready to right the wrongs branded upon it. It is the §BCongo Lake§!. The Congo Dam that fathered said lake was yet another short-sighted byproduct of the postwar euphoria experienced by the near-impossible odds that Germany overcame in the Second World War. Germany created a series of dams near the mouth of the Congo River. What was meant as a shortcut to tame the §nwild foliage of the rainforest§! devolved into Hell. What places the RK still control became hives of disease, poverty and refugee slums, displaced by the lake. Now, nearly 20 years later, the Congo Lake has become nothing less than an eternal reminder of §eMan's folly§!."

 COG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "Whether it's Germany utter apathy to it's failed sons in Africa or it's Zentralafrika's atomic-thin veil of deception fooling the Reich, it appears that nobody has spotted the fact that the Zentralafrikan garrison §Rrarely seems to be in the actual Reichskommissariat most of the time§!. In fact, the main characteristic of Zentralafrika is that it will offer its §x"skills"§! to the highest bidder, bringing along with them the promise of high-tech German weaponry and relatively well-trained troops.\n\n§VAsia§!, §nAfrica§!, §iAmerica§!, it doesn't matter where they end up, as long as Müller's pockets are full, they will fight for anyone and everyone. Even if it goes directly against Germania's interests, even if they directly help the enemy, even if it goes directly against their §wvery own interests§!, they will fight for whoever has the deeper pockets. They wouldn't have it any other way."

 COG_CountryInfo_Content.7: "Beyond the Reichsmark"
 COG_CountryInfo_Content_desc.7: "South Africa is a powderkeg. Worse, it is a powderkeg that has had decades to boil. Resentment from both §OBoer§! and §nAfrican§! alike has led to Cape Town making rasher and hastier decisions, than it did previously. Without the leash of its §VBritish§! master on its collar, South Africa has become rudderless. They can grovel at the feet of the Boer or the Black Man. Not both.\n\nTo Müller however, this is nothing more than an §Eobligation§!. He will send his mercenaries over to South Africa where their §Rbattle-hardened experience§! will more than easily wipe away whatever §JCape Town conscripts§! sent to stop them. Once the war is over, the hunting will resume, as it always has. The only thing that worries Müller is §iAmerica§!. Sure, their military can go toe to toe with the best of his army, but imagine what it would do to his §Kbusiness§!? A sobering thought, indeed."

 UKR_CountryInfo_Content.1: "Breadbasket of Europe"
 
 UKR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "§MUkr§!§Yaine§!'s history is best condensed in what the word "§MUkr§!§Yaine§!" literally means; from the old Slavic language, it means "Borderland". Caught between the forces of Berlin in the west or Moscow in the east, there has scarcely been a moment of calm in §MUkr§!§Yaine§!'s storied history. Once but a slice of the vast §KRussian Empire§!, §MUkr§!§Yaine§! first gained independence in the chaos of the §VRussian Revolution§! before losing it to Moscow's vengeful return, and now finds itself a slave to §oGermania§!.\n\n§MUkr§!§Yaine§! lies conquered at the mercy of another empire's hand, subject to its cruelty and decree, yet the cycle has begun to churn out another vain imitation of §MUkrai§!§Ynian§! history, put on show for the thousandth time as a ruler's crown starts to slip. Every twisted dream of §MUkrai§!§Ynian§! nationhood now vies with one another for the nation's soul; be it east or west, §gcollaboration§! or §Gindependence§!, §Ofascism§! or §yfreedom§!, every hope and prayer for §MUkr§!§Yaine§! has come to seize Destiny - or die trying."

 UKR_CountryInfo_Content.2: "A Million Broken Dreams"
 UKR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "§MUkrai§!§Ynian§! dreams have a habit of stillbirth. Starting with the Cossack hetmanate, §MUkrai§!§Ynian§! nationhood could only flare up for fleeting moments. In 1917, with Moscow in §Vturmoil§!, the §DUkrainian Rada§! tried their hand. This dream, too, died young, with the remnants of §MUkrai§!§Ynian§! democracy fleeing from the advancing §eSoviets§! to §CPoland§!. The §gOrganization of Ukrainian Nationalists§! soon began resistance across Western Ukraine and in Polish Galicia, and fought with the §oNazis§! against their hated enemy.\n\nBut with the end of the §SUA-SSR's§! dream, the §gOUN§! soon floundered, with those opposing collaboration breaking away under §sStepan Bandera§!. Meanwhile, another movement arose in Western Ukraine and Galicia, fighting for a §Gdemocratic dream§!. But §Rnone§! of these visions would survive - nor would almost any leader of the Ukrainian resistance movements, including Bandera. Even §oGermany's§! vision would die, as Erich Koch's colony slowly lost its position as the breadbasket of Europe at the hands of countless terrorist freedom fighters."

 UKR_CountryInfo_Content.3: "Frozen in Time"
 UKR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "The Reichskommissariat was designed with the goal of subjugation. Its planners believed that someday, §MUkr§!§Yaine§! would submit to §oGermany§! and meekly accept its cultural and demographic §Rdecline§!. Instead, the situation on the ground has barely progressed, even after almost two decades spent attempting to move the dial. The §MUkrai§!§Ynian§! people have proven effective at maintaining their armies, and with violence already the core of their colonial policy, the Germans have no other answers.\n\nThe §DUNRA§! still fights for a §Grepublic§!, one now slipping into history. The §sUPA§! still fight for a man who died in prison a decade earlier, their nationalistic dreams more fantastical than ever. The §SPartisans§! battle for a Union which has long since §eshattered§!. Even the §oReichskommissariat§! battles for eventual Germanization, a dream that has endlessly delayed as the situation on the ground failed to change. The world has moved on from the Second World War, but Ukraine remains here, fighting with §Vno way out§!."

 UKR_CountryInfo_Content.4: "Reformers of Rot"
 UKR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "The reality is that this system is utterly §xbroken§! in its current form, and that reality is clear even to the oppressors who run it. §MUkrai§!§Ynian§! colonialism has meant great expense and greater death. If it is to last, to continue to provide what the Nazi machine requires of it, it will need reforms.\n\nWhat those reforms will look like is still a matter of great debate. §oOhlendorf§!, an SS leader and thinker, looks to the free-market and pragmatic government action to §Grejuvenate§! the colonial system and §Rwipe out§! resistance. §BLeibbrandt§!, a disciple of Rosenberg, sees a §Llimited devolution§! to the natives as the reform the Reichskommissariat was always designed for. §sBräutigam§!, a rising star in the diplomatic core, imagines an even more radical reform that sees Ukraine as a §Dtrue equal§! with a fair government.\n\nFor now, the Reichskommissariat's reformers are forever §eblocked§! by Koch, yet he is an ancient man now. If the Reichskommissariat survives, it will likely be without him."

 UKR_CountryInfo_Content.5: "The Dud Revolution"
 UKR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "The dream of the Soviet is still alive. With the present grim and the future bleak, most §MUkrai§!§Ynians§! have little to rally behind but the past. No group exemplifies this more than the §SUA-SSR§!, a group of leftists under §SOleksandr Shumskyi§! who wish desperately for a return to the glory days of the §VUkrainian Soviet§!. Old soldiers and young dreamers all flock to that antique red banner.\n\nThey are tenacious and driven in this goal, but also incredibly ideologically diverse. §SShumskyists§!, §RTrotskyists§!, §eBukharinists§! and more fight alongside one another as begrudging comrades. A strained yet resolute adhesive of a common goal holds them together, just barely maintained by §SShumskyi§! himself. Were the movement to lose him, there is no guarantee the §SSSR§! would stay together, and their dream would §enever be realized§!."

 UKR_CountryInfo_Content.6: "Heirs of 1917"
 UKR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "The history of the §DUkrainian National Revolutionary Army§! has seen it collect traditions stretching across a century of §MUkrai§!§Ynian§! history, from the first rumblings of §Gindependence§! to present day. Perhaps their movement is best summarized in a common slogan: "it is 1917 once more."\n\nThat year, a Ukrainian Republic was first created. Though it would be destroyed by the §VBolsheviks§!, the Republic would nevertheless come to define the §DUNRA§!, most clearly its liberalism and republicanism. When Taras Bulba-Borovets formed his own army, he took these §yideals§!, and that year of §Rrevolution§!, in his heart.\n\nNow, in 1962, it survives with new leadership. A §Ynew generation§! sees the §DUNRA§! as the movement looking forward, even as it looks back. Their nationalist, even leftist beliefs have become increasingly the norm - even if a §eblack heart§! of collaborationism and §sUPA§! connections lurk within the movement."

 UKR_CountryInfo_Content.7: "In Bandera's Footsteps"
 UKR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.7: "Once, the §sUPA§! would have been defined by §sStepan Bandera's§! words. Like most in the §MUkrai§!§Ynian§! nationalist movement, he began resisting the §CPoles§! before collaborating with the §oNazis§!. Yet only Bandera, with his uniquely radical position and surprising popularity, managed to break from §oGermany§! and rise against their former masters.\n\nNow, the §sUPA§! is defined by Bandera's death. Killed in a concentration camp, his movement outlived him, finding new leadership under Dmytro Klyachkivsky. His movement lurks in the west, engaged in an endless war with the §DUNRA§! and the German occupiers.\n\nNow, the §sUPA§! survives strong, but leadership is §Ysplit§! over the future of Bandera's vision. Some seek the nostalgia of past orthodoxy, whilst others audaciously seek to reforge the §sUPA§! for their own ends. The Banderites walk a dangerous and uncertain path just as likely to be their §xdoom§! as their §ysalvation§!."

  MEX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "The presidency of §OLázaro Cárdenas§! was a new beginning for the languishing §OMexican Revolution§!. The collectivization of farmland into "§wejidos§!" had brought significant change to the countryside, landmark efforts to educate the country had begun, and the popular movement itself was incorporated into a united, corporatist organization - §nPartido§! de la §WRevolución§! §xMexicana§!. Under his firm hand, §nMexico§! was at last moving towards socialism.\n\nThe biggest event of §OCárdenas'§! sexenio was the 1938 nationalization of oil. At a stroke, §nMexico§! reclaimed its sovereign rights to its greatest resources. However, this caused tremendous outrage, mostly with the oil companies in the §MUnited States§!."
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content.2: "Politics of Necessity"
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "Faced with the tensions from the §foil expropriation§!, the next president, §mManuel Ávila Camacho§!, would adopt a more §Mmoderate§! approach. He ended the thorny issues with the Church and rolled back many of the outright §Ssocialist§! policies like §Ssocialist§! education. This did not seem to placate the new §MAmerican§! government, however, which led to a personal rift that kept §nMexico§! from fully committing to the §Mwestern allies§!. §nMexico§! would never join the war, and often resisted pressure from the §MUnited States§! to fully eliminate §ofalangist§! and §rfascist§! groups.\n\nThe war did, however, affect §nMexico§!. The higher commodity prices and lack of European exports convinced the §nP§WR§xM§!§!§! the way to a brighter future lay in industrialization and opening up to the global markets. And the tensions with the §MUnited States§! convinced them a §xnew ally§! was needed in the hemisphere."
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content.3: "A New Revolution"
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "President §LMiguel Alemán§! was responsible for the massive postwar shift in the §ORevolution§!. A new opening to the §xJapanese§! brought in a new partner that would reduce reliance on the §MAmericans§!. §xForeign§! §Minvestors§! in industry and tourism would also grow the economy, leading to the §KMexican Miracle§! and §Lrampant corruption§!.\n\nAt home, §LAlemán§! would solidify his power through the new §qDirección Federal de Seguridad§!, a secret police force. But perhaps his greatest accomplishment was the reformation of the §nP§!§WR§!§xM§! into the §nPartido§! §WRevolucionario§! §xInstitucional§!, and the solidification of §nMexico§! into a de facto §none §Wparty §xstate§!."
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content.4: "A Course Correction"
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "After a controversial election in 1952, §lAdolfo Ruiz Cortines§! would seek to restore faith in the Revolution by tamping down on the excesses of §LAlemán§!.

However, it was clear more was needed.\n\nProviding a §ivelvet glove§! and an §qiron fist§!, §EAdolfo López Mateos§! had overseen populist policies and violent crackdowns since 1958.

This is represented first and foremost by the second most powerful man in §nMexico§!, §QGustavo Díaz Ordaz§!, the Interior Secretary. Holding this role often means he manages the §qstate apparatus§! to buy loyalty and snuff out §edissent§!.\n\nAn heir apparent like §QOrdaz§! needs the §npa§!§Wrt§!§xy§! structure to help him win elections with some degree of legitimacy. The man responsible for that is §dAlfonso Corona del Rosal§!, former General and head of the §nP§!§WR§!§xI§!.

  MEX_CountryInfo_Content.6: "The Technocrats"
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "The §Keconomic growth§! that has solidified the §nP§!§WR§!§xI§!'s hold on power can be traced to one man: Finance Secretary §iAntonio Ortiz Mena§!. He has been given a free hand to run the §Meconomy§! through export focused §Kstate capitalism§! by successive governments, and it has worked extremely well, guaranteeing §istabilised development§! - §Kconstant growth§! and little §Rinflation§!.\n\nHowever, §nMexico§! is still facing dire §jpoverty and anti-growth policies§!. Commerce Secretary §VRaúl Salinas Lozano§! in particular is a believer that §Kpolitical expediency§! is holding §nMexico§! back from §Mfull development§!.

The growing §dwealth disparity§! in the nation, constant §Lcorruption§!, and a §edire situation§! for the countryside have made them increase in popularity. They have already posed a challenge to the system in 1952, backing the leftist opposition. A §Knew voice§! of the §ORevolution§! could rise off of their demands and struggles."
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content.8: "The Leviathan's Sword"
  MEX_CountryInfo_Content_desc.8: "Many §Mdemocracies§! keep a degree of impartial law enforcement, but the §qsecurity services§! of §KMexico§! are another unofficial arm of the §nP§!§WR§!§xI§!. From the §Lcorrupt local police§! to the powerful §qDFS§!, the unofficial §rpolice state§! is pervasive throughout the country. These men answer only to the Governor of their states, and the governors only to the President.\n\nEven society itself is not free of the corporatist §nP§!§WR§!§xI§!. Despite nominally §xfree unions§!, the §RConfederación de Trabajadores de México§! takes advantage of its §Kparty connections§! to almost monopolise organized labour. In return, it turns its §Jmembership§! out for the elections, which are counted - yet again - by §Kstate apparatuses§! beholden to the §nP§!§WR§!§xI§!.

  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_GER: "Econ broke"
  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_ITA: "As 1962 begins, the §nItalian Empire§! finds itself in a difficult situation.\n\nItaly's §Wcorporatist§! economy, while undoubtedly more lively than the twitching corpse that is the §rGerman§! one after the market crash of the Fifties, is plagued by §Robsolete§! production methods, §Rlack§! of private investment, as well as §Rcorruption§! and §Rcronyism§! in the supervision organs. Unemployment is on the rise, and while the oil from the Gulf fields maintains the budget afloat, and allows Italy to afford massive subsidization programs, public debt grows at an §Ralarming rate§!."
  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_IRE: "Ireland's Economy is that of a §fFree Market Economy§!. This is a system where corporate enterprise is allowed to run with either no or few checks from the Government. Depending on the government, this system will have varying amounts of regulation ensuring that corporations are kept in check. More importantly for Ireland, it is a Bündnispartner. The Irish Economy has a series of ties with that of the Reich. With German mistreatment of Irish workers in factories, the influence that the Reich has over Ireland is getting more strained by the day. However, German influence also has meant investment. The §pAufsichtsrat der Wehrwirtschaftsführer in Irland§! - or just the Adwil - is the main board in charge of German investment in Ireland, also being Germany's main mode of influencing the Economy. One one hand, the Adwil is a "free" source of funds, which Ireland can use to fund national projects. On the other, displease the investors too much and they may pull out, leaving us destitute."
  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_IBR: "Iberia's Economy operates on the principles of Dirigisme - a system where the state is the unchecked maestro of the economy it benefits from. In this case, Iberia is responsible for building and managing it's projects using quotas and forecasts alongside deep co-operation with the many corporations that make up the state.\n\nAgriculture is in shambles, due to the stagnation that the repression has caused. Much of the population still toils in the countryside, which hurts industrialisation. Conditions in the rural areas are varied, however the poorest areas suffer from crippling poverty and lack of basic, governmental services. Spain serves as the Industrial Heartland of the Union, with most corporations being in Madrid's orbit. However, Portugal still remains as the main heart of global trade, although it's a role that has diminished in importance with Iberia's retreat from the Globe."

  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_JAP: "The Empire of Japan operates under the principle of §hDirigisme§!. This principle - literally to "direct" - is a state of development where the government enforces its will upon the free market and directs the players inside it to bend to its will. This isn't to say that it is a planned economy, like the sort that Stalin envisioned inside the former §VSoviet Union§!, because the private sector is as important - if not more - to the Dirigisme Economy compared to a Free Market State.\n\nIn Japan, this has led to the rise of the §KZaibatsu§! such as §xMitsubishi§! - near-dynastic corporations that control vertical monopolies over huge sectors of the economy - taking prominence inside the economy, with considerable influence. In return, alliances of "small" businesses in Japan have formed loose alliances called the §dKeiretsus§! to combat the Zaibatsu's rampant control of the economy."

  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_ENG: "The Kingdom of England is a §KFree Market Economy§!, where corporations are allowed to do most of their activities and business with very few to no regulations. While the level of regulation differs from nation to nation and government to government, it is generally much more laissez-faire.\n\nIn England's case, it's economy has remained mostly intact from the pre-Occupation days. However, the biggest issue in the English economic sphere is §Jrebuilding§! what is left. During the Second World War, England was subject to the largest strategic bombing campaign - called §YThe Blitz§! - in European History, with Luftwaffe planes leaving very little English industry untouched. The lack of significant reconstruction has led to even more §Bresentment§! towards the government and high levels of unemployment inside England."

  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_SVR: "Sverdlovsk operates under the §gMilitary-Directed Economic§! model. This is a model where the military, due to its §gunchecked grip§! on the state, has the ability to completely command and direct the economy. It is not a command economy similar to that in the former §VSoviet Union§!, because private enterprise is allowed to exist in the state, but the military regime has the §Rfinal say§! over all directives inside the nation.\n\nIn Sverdlovsk's case, the military regime commands what is left of the industry that was moved west by §CBukharin§! and §eStalin§! into the Siberian plains, and was not damaged during the §LLuftwaffe Terror Bombings§! in the 50's and 60's. Compared to other states, it still has a fairly hefty industry and is able to project economic power further than the other warlord states."

  ##Guangdong
  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_GNG: "§SGuangdong's economy§! operates as a §SCorporate Oligarchy§! - a polity where both the economic and political spheres have been subsumed under the direction of large corporations, in this case the §YFour Companies§! of §YYasuda§!, §VSony§!, §WMatsushita§!, and §mFujitsu§!.\n\nSocial and labor protections are intentionally kept weak - weaker than on the §jHome Islands§! themselves - to enable the maximization of profit, with the Four Companies given essentially free reign to do as they please. While Guangdong maintains the minimum necessary to maintain the pretense of a functional government, the withering away of the state has afforded even more opportunities for §Rcorruption§! or §Ycorporate interests§! to insert themselves into public life.\n\nGuangdong's economic performance is also intimately tied to the §melectronics product cycle§! - a competition to win the hearts and wallets of consumers with the §Kbest product§! at the §Kcheapest price§!."

  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_GRO: "Reichskommissariat Ostafrika's Economy is that of the §oGelenkte Wirtschaft§! model. This model tries to balance between the command economy of the former §RSoviet Union§! and the free market capitalism of the §iUnited States of America§! by combining a use of state-directed initiatives and cooperation with private enterprise and selecting a few trusted and proven corporations to serve the state in a fashion that suits both parties.\n\nIn §jOstafrika§!'s case, the state runs on African branches and subsidiaries of German corporations within Europe. However, it is most similar to §EBurgundy§! in the fact that it heavily relies on slave labour and an incredibly repressed underclass to serve the §rselect few§! chosen inside the colony, that can barely eek out a living themselves in the harsh conditions of Eastern Africa."

  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_ANG: "Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika's Economy is that of the §oGelenkte Wirtschaft§! model. This model tries to balance between the command economy of the former §RSoviet Union§! and the free market capitalism of the §iUnited States of America§! by combining a use of state-directed initiatives and cooperation with private enterprise and selecting a few trusted and proven corporations to serve the state in a fashion that suits both parties.\n\nHowever, §mSüdwestafrika§!'s economy doesn't so much pretend to Germanise what parts of the colony it fully controls, but is more content to waste it's money on building Luftwaffe infrastructure inside Namibia, trying to justify it by pointing to the §JSouth African§! powderkeg. In reality, it's Luftwaffe officials pocketing the cash for themselves and going on half-hearted missions to prove that they deserve the funding more than the rest."

  CountryInfo_Economic_Overview_COG: "Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika's Economy is that of the §oGelenkte Wirtschaft§! model. This model tries to balance between the command economy of the former §RSoviet Union§! and the free market capitalism of the §iUnited States of America§! by combining a use of state-directed initiatives and cooperation with private enterprise and selecting a few trusted and proven corporations to serve the state in a fashion that suits both parties.\n\nThe reality on the ground is that Zentralafrika is run more like Müller's §ysweetshop§! than anything else. The entire colony is littered with shell companies of Western and other §oforeign-based corporations§! who pay Müller a hefty fee to sap what resources haven't been drowned by the §BCongo Lake§! - with the Reichskommissar away to hunt down big game and leaving the economic paperwork to his underlings."

The button in the shape of the nuclear symbol in the top bar will lead you to the §YCold War Interface§!. It will tell you everything you need to know about those competing in the §BCold War§!, which is currently winning by how much, and in what ways, along with other useful informations.\n\nThe §Yrankings§! tab shows you which country is currently in the lead, calculated by factors such as their §Rmilitary§! and §Geconomic§! power. The §Rtensions§! tab records the palpability of relations between great powers, as well as the incidents that led to this development of tension. The §Gspheres§! tab highlights the economic sphere of the major powers, showing their raw economic power and influence amongst other nations.\n\nFinally, the §xNukes§! tab, discussed in the next entry."
 
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.5: "Nuclear Warfare"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.5: "§WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§! ultimately takes place during a Cold War, and not a World War. Each of the major three nations: §Wthe United States§!, §WGermany§!, and §WJapan§!, enjoy full §Rnuclear triad capabilities§! as of 1962; locking the world under the fear of §Rnuclear holocaust§!.\n\nAs such, nations are ultimately at the whim of the §Gsuperpowers§! of the world, and they are forever locked against one another without the means to secure an easy victory. Any war between the three §Gsuperpowers§! will inevitably be §RWorld War III§!.\n\nWhen §RWorld War III§! is fought, it can not end well. The sides will fight until one side begins to falter. If a nation feels that it is about to collapse, is unable to continue a war, or has their core territory overwhelmingly threatened then §Rnuclear war§! is an inevitability. If a nuclear strike is launched, it will be a matter of days until thousands of nuclear weapons are deployed in the war. If this happens, it is §Rgame over§!!"

 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.6: "The Economy"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.6: "§WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§! features a complex §Weconomy§! mechanic. You can access your economic overview by clicking upon the §Wglobe sign§! in between the §Wresearch§! and §WCold War§! tabs. The foundation of your national economy is your §GGDP§!, which will be the key to the economic prosperity of your state. Your §GGDP§! needs to be balanced out with your §Rdebt§!. Every year, interest upon your §Rdebt§! will be deducted as an expense, and ending up with too high of a §RDebt§! to §GGDP§! ratio could spell financial ruin.\n\nTo avoid troubling economic times, keep a watchful eye upon your §Gincome§! and your §Yexpenditures§!. Your §Gincome§! is determined by multiple factors, the most obvious of which being your §GGDP§!. Many other factors come to play, however, such as your industry, poverty rate, academia, and much more! On the other hand, you have your §Yexpenditures§!, the bane of any economist. §YExpenditures§! are a measure of factors such as military upkeep, social securities, construction projects, and more."
 
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.7: "Laws and Social Development"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.7: "Taking inspiration from the law system of Victoria 2, §WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§! features a detailed law system to express the specific §Ypolicies§! of your nation, providing greater immersion and complexity. Your §Ypolicies§! are located under the §Wpolitical§! tab, and includes a wide range of §Ypolicies§! to consider during the course of your playthrough. Each §Ypolicy§! has its own effects on various game variables, with both pros and cons to each §Ypolicy§!.\n\nFurthermore, each §Ypolicy§! has §Yeffectiveness§! which can improve or worsen as the game goes on, with some being determined by buildings and funding. This determines the effects gained by a §Ypolicy§! and the more effective a §Ypolicy§!, the better the effects.\n\nFinally, §Ysocietal development§! represents the progress of your country and can trend towards positive progress or negative progress, §Gupgrading§! or §Rdowngrading§! throughout your playthrough."
 
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content.8: "Country Specific Mechanics"
 CountryInfo_Tutorial_Content_desc.8: "Many of the countries in §WThe New Order§! feature expansive §GScripted GUIs§! designed to add more depth to your §Rgameplay experience§!, and make peacetime gameplay more interactive. §GDecision Scripted GUIs§! are built directly into the §Ydecisions tab§!, and can be accessed simply by opening the tab. This includes the §WTomsk Duma GUI§!, the §WSouth African Referendum GUI§!, and §Rmany§! others!\n\nOn the other hand, §GFull Scripted GUIs§! are accessed via the §Ypolitics tab§!, using a button located below your §Wcountry leader's portrait§!, next to the §WHead of Government's portrait§!. These §GFull Scripted GUIs§! tend to be much more in-depth, and are oftentimes vital to a country's §Rgameplay experience§!. This includes the §WUnited States Voting GUI§!, the §WSpeer Zollverein GUI§!, the §WJapan Legislature GUI§!, and §Rseveral§! others. Furthermore, most §GScripted GUIs§! also feature an §Yinfo button§!, which, when §Rhovered over or clicked on§!, will display helpful information on how the interface works and other features of the §Rintegrated mechanic§!."
