It is also key to protecting the fruits of the revolution. If the number of militia is insufficient, the security situation will deteriorate, and local hostile forces' unrest will grow (up to 4% per month), causing damage to local water conservancy facilities. When the number of militia recruited in a single region exceeds 50% of the limit, natural growth of unrest and damage to water conservancy can be effectively avoided. Therefore, before allocating militia to the center, ensure that local militia forces are adequate."

COX_landreform_unrest_level_tt:0 "When local hostile forces' unrest exceeds 80%, a riot will break out in the region. Riots have five intensity levels, and the number of militia required to quell the unrest varies according to the intensity, increasing by 30%/40%/50%/60%/70% of the militia limit in the region. Each time a task to quell unrest is completed, the intensity of the riot will decrease by one level until the riot is fully resolved. Therefore, address the situation as soon as possible before the riot escalates to a high intensity."

##### Province Introductions #####
introduction_cox_landreform_dh:0 "As the only capital since Sheng Shicai's rule, Dihua has enjoyed numerous resource allocations and policy preferences. The dense streets radiate outward from the Grand Cross, and the electrified streetlights continue to shine at night, while the yellowed two-story Western-style buildings are a common sight. Over 90% of the heavy industry in Xinjiang is distributed in the rural areas surrounding Dihua, continuously exporting manufactured goods. However, after thirty years of continuous operation with almost no maintenance, the heartbeat of this industrial heart is growing weaker, the workers are discontented, and the landlord-industrialists have been suppressing wages. Many people are casting skeptical eyes on Dihua, wondering if it still deserves to be the core of Xinjiang Province."
introduction_cox_landreform_alt:0 "Altay, located in the northern part of the Junggar Basin, is known as the 'Water Tower of Xinjiang.' It was the core region of the ancient Linzhong and the Oirat Khanate, and the earliest liberated area in Xinjiang Province. Although this area was generally regarded as a northern frontier stronghold during Sheng Shicai's rule, it does not mean that it is a barren and bitter land. The Irtysh River, originating from the Altay Mountains, flows northward into the Arctic Ocean, bringing abundant water resources and fishing opportunities to Altay. The mineral-rich soil has also greatly promoted agricultural production. According to early survey reports from Sheng Shicai's time, there is a strong possibility that large rare metal veins are distributed in this area, although mining work is still far in the future. Agricultural production here is still primitive, with some indigenous people even maintaining a semi-hunting, semi-nomadic economy. Given time, this area is sure to become a new land of plenty."
introduction_cox_landreform_ks:0 "Kashgar, full name Kashgar, means 'Jade Stone' in Turkic. As an important town on the ancient Silk Road, Kashgar was once a massive transportation hub, where countless riches converged, making it famous for its wealth and diversity. However, with the decline of the Central Plains dynasties, Kashgar also fell into chaos, with droughts leading to peasant migrations, nomadic plundering, and the blockade of the inland leading to the bankruptcy of artisans, all of which were eventually incited by local elites into a national riot—the East Turkestan Rebellion of 1933. Compared to the brutal Anti-Japanese War, the national hatred under class contradictions brought even greater pain to this place. Most people in Kashgar still remember the slogan at that time: 'Protect religion, kill Han and Hui.' Almost thirty years have passed, but will the old hatred dissipate?"
introduction_cox_landreform_hm:0 "Hami has been deeply influenced by the Central Plains dynasties since ancient times. As a key route connecting Xinjiang to the inland, it is home to countless Han immigrants fleeing westward, who once guarded this gateway to Xinjiang for the former Sheng Shicai government. Among the large population of Han immigrants are many small producers and members of the national bourgeoisie, who have brought small textile and sewing light industries to Xinjiang, providing much-needed cotton textile light industry—though it remains weak. Outside of the densely populated Hami City, which rivals the provincial capital, the rural areas of Hami are no different from other parts of Xinjiang, except that the landlords are of different ethnicities, and class contradictions are not manifested in ethnic terms. This very fact allows landlords to be more flexible in their 'carrot and stick' approach, causing farmers to live in extreme hardship yet remain too afraid to resist."
introduction_cox_landreform_ht:0 "Hotan, formerly known as Yutian, has been famous for producing jade since ancient times. The majority of the local population is Uyghur, followed by Han. In the mid-Qing period, it once housed one-eighth of the total population of Xinjiang—of course, this is a thing of the past. Due to the fall of the Qing dynasty, the Northwest bandit turmoil, and the continuous changes of the Central Plains warlord regimes, the jade market on which Hotan relied for survival gradually dwindled, forcing industry workers to flee this area. The overwhelming sand from the Taklamakan Desert buried the unattended water conservancy facilities. Removing the drifting sand is not difficult, but the future of Hotan remains uncertain after the loss of its traditional jade industry."
introduction_cox_landreform_bygl:0 "Stretching westward from Gansu and Qinghai, the Altyn-Tagh mountain range occupies most of the territory of Bayingolin Prefecture. Although the eight seasonal rivers formed by snowmelt within the mountain range create a 20,000 square meter basin, the average altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 meters makes this area unsuitable for large-scale farming. Meadows and pastures are among the few sources of wealth, with Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, and other ethnic groups living and roaming among them. Since there are no boundary markers in the mountains, herders from Tibet and Qinghai often mistakenly enter Bayingolin Prefecture, sometimes leading to disputes and conflicts over grazing, causing headaches for local administrative departments."
introduction_cox_landreform_kmls:0 "Kizilsu, meaning 'Red Water' in Kyrgyz, is an area with arid conditions, complex terrain, and elevations ranging from over 7,000 meters to just over 1,000 meters. The main residents are Kyrgyz, a branch of the Soviet Kyrgyz people who practice Islam. Their social organization is relatively primitive, with most people engaged in nomadic herding and some practicing rudimentary farming. Some areas still use wooden plows. Although Kizilsu controls an important mountain pass to Kyrgyzstan, Xinjiang authorities' control over the area is insufficient, so the pass has long been used as a route for Kyrgyzstanis fleeing disasters rather than becoming a customs checkpoint."
introduction_cox_landreform_tlf:0 "The Turpan area is an olive-shaped mountain basin located in the eastern part of the Tianshan Mountains. This basin gathers moisture from the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic, making it one of the most rainfall-rich areas in Xinjiang, with numerous oases and fourteen rivers. Most of the Han people who fled from the east eventually settled in the more stable and fertile Turpan area after staying in Hami for several years, making this one of the most densely populated agricultural areas in Xinjiang. However, this does not mean it is a utopia: disorganized peasant movements among various ethnic groups are frequent, and village-level conflicts over water resources often erupt, with 'water grabbing' becoming a common derogatory term. As for why irrigation water is always scarce—don't look at the local elites; they really know nothing about it."
introduction_cox_landreform_cjdq:0 "Located on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, the Changji region is one of the few barren areas in northern Xinjiang. Most of its territory is covered with endless sand dunes and deserts, and the hilly terrain in the north is extremely rugged, making it difficult to develop by human labor. The extreme continental arid climate results in very limited precipitation, almost entirely concentrated in the summer, and the lack of storage facilities and high evaporation rates further hinder agricultural production. Most of the residents in this area are impoverished nomads, with very few farmers, and the number of local elites is close to zero. While some might argue that infinite resources lie buried beneath the sands, for now, Changji is a hopeless wasteland where no one wants to set foot."
introduction_cox_landreform_aks:0 "If the eastern regions of Xinjiang are likened to a beating industrial heart, Aksu is the main artery supplying raw materials to this heart. The New and Old Rivers, the Tarim River, and the Duolang Canal, dug during the Qing Dynasty, provide ample irrigation water for local agriculture. The abundant light and heat conditions have made the Gali fruit famous in Central Asia, and the textile industry in Dihua and Hami rely on the high-quality cotton produced in Aksu Prefecture. Due to this supply-demand relationship, many landlords in Aksu Prefecture have connections with the Dihua authorities. Whether Uyghur, Han, Hui, or Kazakh, all are equally oppressed here, enduring the scorching sun and whipping in the orchards and cotton fields."
introduction_cox_landreform_klmy:0 "No one doubts that the Karamay region holds immense potential—if you have ever been to Karamay, you will be amazed by the oil and gas resources buried in the Gobi Desert. For a long time, locals have used the exposed surface oil as fuel, and it is not uncommon for herders to use oil to boil water in the wild, a true local spectacle. However, the exploitation of oil and gas resources remains at this primitive level, and today, Karamay is still a wilderness filled with cattle and sheep. The fragility of the nomadic economy is starkly evident in this area, where a single sandstorm or snowstorm can devastate nomadic production. This situation is likely to continue for a long time into the future."
introduction_cox_landreform_tc:0 "Located in the far northwest of northern Xinjiang, Tacheng Prefecture is home to several large ports in Xinjiang Province, where industrial products from Central Asia and illegal immigrants continue to flow in through the porous border, making the ethnic composition of the region extremely complex, though it is primarily composed of local Kazakhs and those from Central Asia. Due to the existence of port taxes, agricultural taxes in Tacheng have always been slightly lighter than in other regions, a small concession that has attracted waves of poor farmers seeking a livelihood. However, local elites still heavily tax tenant farmers, and it is not uncommon for farmers to fall from poverty into serfdom. In some areas, the proportion of serfs is even higher than in southern Xinjiang."
introduction_cox_landreform_kel:0 "Korla is a region where Han, Mongolian, and Hui people live together. Although there are many Han residents, they do not hold an absolute majority; fleeing Mongols and bankrupt Hui migrants are also important components of the population. Unlike other areas in eastern Xinjiang, Korla's agricultural production is characterized by four farming and six herding, playing a more significant role in producing secondary products. Large-scale nomadic herding combined with concentrated pastoral activities near settlements is a unique feature of the area. While nomadism is highly mobile, the local elites monopolize essential goods such as salt, iron, and tea, desperately needed by the herders. Additionally, the area is subject to the irregular 'grass-harvesting' raids of the Ma Clique, meaning that the suffering of the local residents has not lessened in the slightest."
introduction_cox_landreform_aksq:0 "The name Aksai Chin comes from Turkic, meaning 'China's White Stone Beach,' but since the 20th century, this area has often not been under Chinese control. Following the end of World War II and the collapse of the British Empire, British India and its successor states' control over occupied territories has steadily weakened, leading to Aksai Chin entering a state of autonomy and relying on Xinjiang for essential goods that cannot be produced locally. In name, Aksai Chin's sovereignty has been restored, and the local residents still retain their cultural identity with China, but Xinjiang authorities' governance of the area is more laissez-faire than even the traditional jimi (loose rein) system."
introduction_cox_landreform_tklmgdq:0 "Whether the Taklamakan Desert region is qualified to be an independent administrative division has always been a subject of doubt. The vast expanse of the region is covered with nothing but yellow sand, with a permanent population barely numbering in the tens of thousands, scattered across several river valley oases along the only He Tian River. The vast desert area has extreme temperature variations between day and night, making it uninhabitable. Due to the harsh natural environment, the local economy is at a low level of self-sufficiency, with the clan heads of each settlement holding governance power. Ethnic conflicts are relatively rare, and class contradictions are also relatively mild. Unable to produce any products and not expecting any products from the outside world—this is the current situation in the Taklamakan Desert region, and the hope for change is nearly non-existent."
