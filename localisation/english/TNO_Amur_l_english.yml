 AMR_Konstantin_Rodzaevsky: "Konstantin Rodzaevsky"
 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_RODZAEVSKY_DESC: "Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky was always a man of the East. The perceived oppression of the new Soviet system which he despised from a young age pushed him to flee Blagoveschensk in the Union for Harbin, the city in which the émigrés thrived. There, he became convinced that a system to rival Bolshevism had to be created; he found that system in Europe, where Fascism had just been born. The nascent ideology was adopted by many Russians, bitter from their loss in the civil war. A young and charismatic Rodzaevsky grabbed the chance to unite them all under the banner of the swastika, setting crowds on fire with his speeches. He made a promise to return to his homeland one day, and liberate its people.\n\nShortly after its foundation, the Russian Fascist Party forged a close relationship with the new overlords of Manchuria, Japan. The greatest benefactors of the party supported it throughout its entire existence, until the opportunity for reclamation came with the collapse of the Presidium.\n\nEmboldened by the enthusiasm of his Japanese allies, the leader of the RFP went on a noble crusade to crush Judeo-Bolshevism. However, his dreams of complete liberation were dashed by his rivals: the generals and their Tsar, and worse of all, Mikhail Matkovsky and his band of traitors who looked across the Pacific for help. Konstantin Rodzaevsky, left alone in Zeya as the leader of a mere warlord state, has become enraged, and has vowed to get revenge against all of Russia's enemies, whoever they may be: Jews, Reds, Matkovskyites, Tsarists, anyone who dares challenge the Vozhd. To him, it is the only way to restore the nation to its old days of glory, yet that dream seems further and further away."

 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_RODZAEVSKY_70S_DESC: "Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky has been known by many names to many people. To his detractors, he was insane. To his enemies, he was the bandit king. To his supporters, he was the Vozhd. He was the one who led the Russian Fascist Party into Russia. He was the one that began the crusade against the Bolshevik and the Jew. And he was repaid with treachery. Traitors desecrated his vision, slaughtered his comrades-in-arms, and distanced themselves from his movement. Rodzaevsky fell into a great depression, latching onto a drinking habit and increasingly-dangerous paranoia; the dark days of Zeya.\n\nBut as his enemies were rooted out, and the splitters dealt with; the Bolsheviks destroyed and the crazed cultists ground into dust, Konstantin Rodzaevsky found his spirit renewed as the Vozhd and he was reborn: seizing more and more of Russia, he worked to shed his alcoholism, and his paranoia evaporated alongside the last of his internal enemies. Even the perfidious Germans, who the Vozhd had once looked up to, showed their true colors by ignoring him. But this was not a tragedy - it was a revelation. The Vozhd realized that the Germans were stagnant failures who fell short in establishing their own National Socialist utopia - the Germans themselves a race of collective disappointment. The Vozhd learned that the Slav would not need the crutch of another.\n\nThe National State, the product of Rodzaevsky's hard work, was the first serious step in his vision to forge a Russia strengthened by National Socialism. He marches onwards, the fires of National Socialism burning in his heart and with full confidence in the future - a National Socialist future. A Slavic future."

 AMR_Lev_Okhotin: "Lev Okhotin"
 AMR_Lev_Okhotin_hog_desc: "§YSecretary of the RFP\nClerical Fascism§!\n--------------\n§LLev Pavlovich Okhotin was born and raised in Chita. In 1920, at the age of nine, Okhotin and his family, staunch Tsarists, fled the city for Harbin, fearing retribution from oncoming Soviet forces. Growing up as a boy-in-exile with an unhappy home life, Okhotin was a natural and youthful recruit into Rodzaevsky's newly-formed Russian Fascist Party. One of the first members of the organization, joining in 1932 and leaving his job at the Harbin Teacher's Institute shortly after, Okhotin would quickly become one of the Vozhd's few friends.\n\nWhen the Tsarists cut off contact and the perfidious Matkovsky escaped to Magadan and split the party, and when the Vozhd's paranoia gripped him and stripped him of any assurance or confidence he may have had, Okhotin remained faithful despite the Vozhd's increasing distance; despite his dwindling resources for the All-Russian Army; despite the cautious glances and suspicious whisperings of Alexander Bolotov.§!"

 AMR_Nikolay_Zaerko_hog_desc: "§YSecretary of the RFP\nClerical Fascism§!\n--------------\n§LThe new Party Secretary of the Russian Fascist Party following the purge of Lev Okhotin, Nikolay Ivanovich Zaerko has a relatively distinguished career in service to the dream of Russian fascism (or as distinguished as such a thing can be), having served as adjutant to Rodzaevsky before his promotion.\n\nAs expected from an adjutant that has been promoted to second-in-command, Zaerko is a loyal sycophant utterly devoted to every word that comes out of Rodzaevsky's mouth, treating his statements like the words of Christ himself. Rodzaevsky likes this in a second-in-command; as a result Zaerko's relationship with his boss remains as good as ever.§!"

 AMR_Mikhail_Spasovsky: "Mikhail Spasovsky"
 AMR_Mikhail_Spasovsky_for_desc: "§YForeign Minister\nClerical Fascism§!\n--------------\n§LMikhail Mikhailovich Spasovsky, by far the eldest of the Russian Fascist Party's senior members, was born in the 19th century in Saint Petersburg, then the capital of the Russian Empire. In his youth, he was a member of the Black Hundreds, the ultra-nationalist reactionary movement that permeated certain layers of Imperial Russian society before the First World War. Following their collapse during the February Revolution, Spasovsky found himself drifting eastwards with the Russian White movement, ultimately relocating to the Manchurian city of Harbin.\n\nThe ravages of time and the harsh reality of life first in Harbin and then on the Amur haven't been kind to the aging reactionary. Despite his close relationship with the Vozhd and his highly respected position within the party, Mikhail Spasovsky is in his 70's. The added stress of the Vozhd's ever-increasing paranoia has not been kind to the elderly party member. Despite Rodzaevsky's respect and continued praise for his foreign minister, Spasovsky's increasingly complicated heart problems have made the venerable fascist feel as if he is not long for this world.§!"

Briefly training to become a Russian school teacher in Harbin during his youth, he instead found himself enticed by the Asano Detachment - a force of ethnic Russians commanded by Japanese officers in the Kwantung Army.\n\nAs the Asano Detachment evolved to a number of basically-independent brigades, Shekherev found himself a satellite of the Russian Fascist Party, many members of which were also a part of the Asano Brigades. Finding himself engrossed in the movement, he further fell into the orbit of Rodzaevsky when reading his works, especially the ABCs of Fascism. Ultimately joining the party and subsequently its Blackshirt paramilitary wing, Shekherev impressed his peers and superiors with his devotion to the cause and ability to get just about any task done, no matter the amount of work or degree of brutality required.\n\nSince the party's arrival upon the Amur, Shekherev has found himself a prominent position both in the party and at the side of Konstantin Rodzaevsky as the head of the RFP's Blackshirt movement. A man at a crossroads, Shekherev is desperate to transition the party away from Alexander Bolotov's thuggery, driving an increasingly large wedge between the two men. However, he is chained to the nature and purpose of the organization that he runs.§!"

 AMR_Konstantin_Steklov_eco_desc: "§YEconomy Minister\nClerical Fascism§!\n--------------\n§LFor reasons known only to himself, the man born as Georgy Nikolaevich Zhiryakov spurned his original name long ago, adopting a new personal identity - perhaps to match his political one. Whatever his reasons, Konstantin Alekseevich Steklov has been a dedicated follower of fascism for decades. Originally part of Vonsiatsky's All-Russian Fascist Organization, he chose to side with the RFP when that group split, then followed the Vozhd to Zeya upon Matkovsky's secession.\n\nSteklov is old even among the White leadership, having served in the Great War, the Civil War, and the army of warlord Zhang Zongchang. Not as fanatical as Rodzaevsky, he is nonetheless an ardent fascist and reactionary, willing to commit the most horrendous acts imaginable to rebuild the Motherland according to the Vozhd's vision. Slavery and genocide are a miniscule price to pay, in his view.§!"

Since joining up with the Russian Fascist Party, his dedication to his party and his Vozhd has been matched only by his willing violence towards the enemies of the party and the Russian people.\n\nAs the Vozhd's paranoia has only begun to increase as a result of the splitter Matkovsky and the collapse of the unified front with the monarchists, Bolotov has intensified his influence over the dictator, frequently having his ear when recommending names for purges. More often than not, however, these names are those that Alexander Bolotov had previous misgivings with...§!"

As it was in the face of Fascism that the Unholy Union was shattered, we seem to have made a right call; and it is beneath the banner of Fascism that the Homeland will be reborn, and any despoilers will be run out of it. While we may be confined for now in this desolate land in the Far East, this sorry state is only due to betrayal; internal by Matkovsky and external by the dastardly Japanese.

After great consideration, the Vozhd has righteously decided that a purge of his Supreme Council is needed in order to form a newer, cleaner, and stronger government to serve the state in his person.

This is particularly true of the common people, among whom manipulative dissidents and shadowy communist infiltrators lurk at every turn. To ensure the security of our state, we will place eyes for the Vozhd everywhere: in every home, in every factory, on every street.

In our darkest hour, the Japanese and their clients in Manchukuo took us in with warm welcomes when no one else would, they sheltered us from the bitter cold and fed us when we starved.\n\nAfter the German eagle laid its claws into the fields of Russia and brought down the entire rotten Soviet structure, shattering the Union into pieces, it was Japan who emerged as our benefactors in our struggle against Yagoda's corrupt soviet rump state. Even after the collapse of the White coalition, Japan continued in its support of our righteous government not the ridiculous, foolish monarchist snakes in Chita nor Matkovsky's backstabbing rabble.\n\nNow, when we stand as a bastion of purity and nationalism in the dark, it is the Japanese who are our only ally, arming us and advising us on our crusade to liberate the motherland from the shackles of degeneracy and cleanse it of those who betrayed it."

Originally written by Gennady Taradanov and Vladimir Kibardin- now revealed to be Matkovskyite archtraitors- and edited by the great Vozhd himself, it was recently decided to convince the people of our cause by publishing the book for public reading, after further editing to minimize the influence of the Matkovskyites. Fascists are molded, not born, and what better way to spread the Fascist ideology than to spread widely knowledge of the glorious future it promises?"

However, we cannot expect them to continue providing us with such crucial aid without some kind of short term payoff. To that end, we will give them everything they might want from us within reason, granting exclusive economic rights and land for their Zaibatsu to exploit and develop.

 AMR_the_german_model_idea: "The German Model"
 AMR_the_german_model_idea_desc: "The Germans might be our mortal enemies, and their Reich is a pathetic mimic of the national socialist ideal, but at the very least their economic model works. The reason why their nation is still standing is due to the national corporatist economic system, which is why we will emulate said model and apply it to the territories we conquered. The conquered masses will complain, but it is only fair that the winner leads over the defeated. Besides, it's the slaves who will be doing all the dangerous, laborious stuff."

 AMR_commandos_desc: "By the orders of the Vozhd, a new special military forces unit has been created as a detachment from the regular army. Members of this unit are called 'commandos' and perform all sorts of functions which ordinary soldiers are not trained for. These duties include, among others, the conducting of asymmetrical warfare and demoralization of the enemy through sudden night raids to throw them off balance and create gaps in their lines. We have high expectations for these commandos, and in coming times we hope they will be able to meet them."
 AMR_idea_lessons_from_the_ice_march: "Lessons from the Ice March"
 AMR_idea_lessons_from_the_ice_march_desc: "During the great tragedy of the Russian Civil War, now decades in the past, which saw the hated Bolsheviks ultimately achieve victory through their deceptions, our forebears in the White forces endured much suffering on their slow retreat to the east. One particularly infamous incident of this was the Ice March, in which many thousands of soldiers had to carry out a retreating march across the ice of the frozen Kan River, as well as a great area of Siberia in general, in the winter in order to avoid total defeat or capture. This near disaster should be mourned, but also learned from so that it is not repeated: we will study its details and apply them to the modernization of our military logistics."

 AMR_the_true_heir_of_harbin: "The True Heir of Harbin"
 AMR_the_true_heir_of_harbin_desc: "Fate was truly generous to the long-suffering Russian people as it sent Konstanin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky and the Russian Fascist Party to its rescue from the decades of the Judeo-Bolshevik slaughter. A spark that was ignited through the rightful anger of the young and patriotic exiles of Harbin became a flame that would spread across the Russian Far East, bringing freedom to the oppressed Russians and punishment to the forces of the Soviet tyranny. The determination of the Fascist heroes, the sacrifices and feats they made in the name of Russia and God, are the true manifest of legitimacy of the Russian Fascist Party and the dearest Vozhd as the vanguard of the Russian anti-communist struggle.\n\nEven if our efforts were sabotaged by the betrayal of the Semyonov and Matkovsky cliques, our will has never been more firm. Our true purpose, the total liberation of Holy Russia under the Fascist banner, only began its incarnation. Either it will mark the greatest point in Russian history, or end in its total subservience to Jewish overlords."

 AMR_contact_the_japanese: "Contact the Japanese"
 AMR_contact_the_japanese_desc: "In the darkest years of Communist tyranny, the conscientious and patriotic exiles of Harbin could not ask for a better ally than the magnificent empire of Nippon. A state which did not know the Jewish influence for millennia, it rose as the pre-eminent power of Free Asia that rejected the values of the mercantile and Semitic civilization and cherished honor and tradition. The moral virtues of the Japanese are truly the opposite to those of Jews.\n\nThe Japanese establishment was not blind to the threat coming from the Soviet empire and was fully aware of the role of which the RFP was to play in the anti-Bolshevik crusade. It was the Empire of the Rising Sun that directed our efforts towards the recapture of Priamurye and aided our forces with guns and butter against the Red armies. Even though Japan withdrew from Russian affairs, it doesn't mean the Empire can no longer assist in our struggle. By any means, the Vozhd will show himself as a worthy ally to the Chrysanthemum Throne and prove his willingness to continue our relations on good terms."


 AMR_the_free_all_russian_army: "The Free All-Russian Army"
 AMR_the_free_all_russian_army_desc: "The warriors of the Russian Fascist Party are full of fervor and courage, yet they lack in training and discipline necessary for an army of the modern age. Our forces, primarily composed of street fighters and militiamen of Harbin, are hardly a match to our closest rivals that have the brightest officers of the White cliques or at least American mercenaries at their disposal. What else to say about the Bolsheviks, who fastened their soldiery with a fierce drill and don't shun any inhumane measures to achieve their pitiable victories?\n\nIf the restoration of Russia is ought to happen - and let it come to happen - the reform of the All-Russian Army should become our foremost priority. Our military minds will adopt the experience of Japanese and the White Army elders, our recruits will be bound by the will of the Party and the military will become an organic entity, not to be disturbed by internal squabbles. Perhaps, one day, the world will watch with amazement how a small band of followers would become a force to equal the mighty Wehrmacht..."

 AMR_secure_the_west: "Secure the West"
 AMR_secure_the_west_desc: "History truly has a tendency to repeat itself in the most deriding ways, as it destined for Ataman Grigory Semyonov, along with his sham Tsar and sycophant White officers, to arrive back to Chita and the surroundings of Transbaikalia for the first time in decades since the end of the Russian Civil War. The twist, of course, is that he once fought valiantly against the Reds for the righteous cause - but now he seeks to put down the nationalist Russian efforts against Communism. No longer a paragon of the Russian officer chivalry, he and his clique are lacking any noble goals and desire only to enrich themselves at the expense of their puppet Tsar, Mikhail.\n\nThe earthly days of Semyonov, Shepunov and other reactionaries are numbered and the throne of their pretender is crumbling apart, but as long as they persist, their pauper principality remains an utmost rival to us. We should pay special attention to our borders with Chita in order to prevent any unwarranted intrusions from their side."

 AMR_secure_the_east: "Secure the East"
 AMR_secure_the_east_desc: "A despicable coward, pitiful traitor, loathsome snake, Mikhail Matkovsky found himself at the mercy of the harsh environment of Magadan where he fled in the aftermath of his failed attempt to usurp the leadership of the anti-communist front for his self-serving goals. Isolated to the frozen outskirts of the Russian Far East, he was left with little means to survive but through the loyalty of his few adherents and the supply coming from the usurers of America.\n\nBut his apparent miserable situation should not fool us. If Matkovsky ever exceeded at anything, it is trickery and ability to survive against all odds. Even in his desperate position, he will seek to undermine us and use our moment of weakness to strike us in the back. Leaving the borders with him unprotected would be foolish on our behalf. The fortifications in the north will provide us with a line of defense in our final strike against the Renegade."

 AMR_under_lock_and_key: "Under Lock and Key"
 AMR_under_lock_and_key_desc: "One of the most amazing things about the territory controlled by Konstantin Rodzaevsky is the degree of social control that he is able to exert throughout it. From the smallest Siberian village to the bustling town of Rodzaevsk, the Blackshirts and Russian Fascist Party have an extremely tangible presence, both through iconography and people. Party bureaucrats and Blackshirt thugs are incredibly present, and very detailed registrars of individuals living within the shadow of the Vozhd helped these party members to track, catalogue, and keep tabs on just about anyone, including those that are coming into and going out of the Amur region.\n\nWhile this not only means that the RFP has a good handle on exactly who everyone is within their territory, it also means that they can effectively target would-be defectors trying to flee, or prevent the ingress of subversive agents before they can do damage. The Vozhd likes to joke that he will soon have the entirety of Russia "under lock and key"."

 AMR_the_rodzaevsk_officer_academy: "The Rodzaevsk Military Academy"
 AMR_the_rodzaevsk_officer_academy_desc: "The politically conscious White officers and the anti-Bolshevik fighters who exceeded in the Japanese ways of war proved to be a great aid in our reconquest of Amur, but as the core of the military, they alone aren't a force to rely on in the long-term. The demands of the ever-escalating war require us to nurture military traditions of our own. To supply our formations with officer corps and provide it with professionals who embrace the experience accumulated by the greatest military minds of our age, we need to learn to forge military cadres through every available means.\n\nThus the Rodzaevsk Military Academy will function as the first war school of the new Russia. The Vozhd himself will be present in his hometown at the opening of the Academy to greet recruits and announce his hopes and aspirations for the new generation of Russian officers who will bring glory to the Fascist sword."

 AMR_a_new_asano_brigade: "A New Asano Brigade"
 AMR_a_new_asano_brigade_desc: "A special episode in the history of the Russo-Japanese cooperation is the history of the Asano Brigade, an anti-communist formation of Harbin youth that served along with the Imperial Japanese Army. Formed under the auspices of esteemed Kwantung Army officers, the Brigade proved itself as a capable force against the communist partisans, a worthy asset to one of the strongest armies in Asia. Their valor was even compared to those of Samurai. The Brigade was eventually disbanded, with many of them participating in the struggle against Bolshevism in the Far East and later joining the anti-communist armies of Russia, including ours.\n\nAs the matters of security against the resurgent Bolshevik threat become relevant for us both, we can petition the Imperial Japanese Army high command for the creation of the second Asano Brigade, which will not only serve the purpose of the common cause between the All-Russian Government and the Empire of Japan, but also will provide us with a reliable veteran group that will aid in our later campaigns."

 AMR_arms_from_the_sphere: "Arms From the Sphere"
 AMR_arms_from_the_sphere_desc: "First opening herself to the world during the Meiji Restoration in the 19th century, Japan made a long way to become one of the world's leading superpowers and an economic and industrial giant which exceeded, in every area of production one could imagine. The almighty Zaibatsu, titans of the Asian economy, produce immeasurable amounts of guns and ammunition, most of which aren't used immediately for the service of the Imperial Japanese Army and the adjacent forces in the Sphere, but instead are stored until better times. Those tools could be very useful for us.\n\nWith insufficient arms production in our lands to compensate for the lack of equipment of our forces, we can obtain the surplus of Japanese guns and ammo for a handsome price and back up our promises to use them against our common threats, those being border bandits and communists."

 AMR_rethinking_our_tactics: "Rethinking Our Tactics"
 AMR_rethinking_our_tactics_desc: "One of the main reasons that the RFP failed to extend their authority westwards during the initial collapse of the Union was that, quite frankly, most of the tactics and strategies that we employed were based off of archaic battle plans concocted by decrepit White Russian army officers - human waves, the supremacy of the officer, grand battle plans. What were they thinking?\n\nThose officers and their service to our cause is appreciated, but their specific contributions aren't. It's time that Rodzaevsky and his military's high command draft new strategic plans and large-unit tactics in order to best prepare ourselves for the oncoming conflicts. This way, we can ensure that the mistakes made nearly a decade ago won't be repeated."

 AMR_blackshirt_field_divisions: "Blackshirt Field Divisions"
 AMR_blackshirt_field_divisions_desc: "One of the most valuable resources that we have at our disposal are the much-feared Blackshirts: the most ideologically committed of our party members that form the core of our party's paramilitary. However, until now, we haven't been utilizing the Blackshirts to the best of their abilities.\n\nThese fascist fanatics, known for their intimidatory tactics, extreme brutality, and utter dedication to Rodzaevsky and the RFP's cause have previously been relegated to targeting civilian dissenters and ending internal opposition to the Vozhd and his RFP.\n\nHowever, Rodzaevsky has a number of ideas for how to better use the Blackshirts - primarily, to act as partisan suppression units and political commissars of sorts, installing them within and alongside our regular units to ensure cohesion and adherence to the party line, both among our soldiers and the civilians that they rule over."

 AMR_armored_cars: "Armored Cars"
 AMR_armored_cars_desc: "Decades ago, warfare in Siberia was conducted mostly by armored trains. As technology progressed, so too did weaponry. Armored trains evolved into armored cars, which evolved into trucks used for troop transport and logistical support. Now more than ever, we have to take steps in order to secure and integrate new, motorized equipment into our armed forces both in frontline and logistical roles. This will help give an edge to our army's performance and help put us along the road towards a modernized, effective fighting force, especially if we form dedicated mobile units. Surely our friends in Tokyo would be able to secure some surplus equipment for us, even if we do have to pay a premium for them!\n\n"Strategic mobility, at its heart a central tenet of warfare, is an inherent trait in the Slavic race. Thus, it would only be natural that we adapt to this new equipment. Forward!""

 AMR_a_disciplined_force: "A Disciplined Force"
 AMR_a_disciplined_force_desc: ""About turn! Present arms! No, not like that, you filth! It's precise, it's as if you actually cared about your station here. You can expect to be eating your meal in the barracks' prison if you're not careful!"\n\nCurrently, our armed forces are a colorful mixing pot of conscripted peasants, disaffected White Émigrés, and foreign mercenaries. As it stands, our armed forces are in no position to be fighting prolonged conflicts - oftentimes, our troops' discipline breaks down even fighting partisans and bandits. New training regimens must be implemented, disciplinary actions enforced and made harsher, and incentivization schemes put into action to make sure that our troops don't break and run at the slightest indication of adversity. We need to ensure that our soldiers are the best, not just in the Far East, but in all of Russia, to demonstrate our superiority."

 AMR_japanese_advisors: "Japanese Advisors"
 AMR_japanese_advisors_desc: "It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that a whole generation of White Émigrés in Asia was raised and trained by Japanese masters. The Japanese provided us with military assistance, organizational help and they ultimately guided us towards victory over the Bolshevik forces at the edges of the Russian Far East. Although they left us to act without their supervision as soon as they helped the Russian Fascist Party to kick-start the Russian reunification, we still can benefit from their continuous assistance.\n\nRequesting the Japanese support wouldn't be a shameful decision to take for our national pride, as the Bolshevik government enslaved and oppressed all specialists we could use at our disposal. As our ties deepen, we can offer lucrative positions within the ranks of our military and economics to the advisors from Japan, assisting for the mutual benefit for our countries."

 AMR_basing_rights: "Basing Rights"
 AMR_basing_rights_desc: "We have established links with the Japanese by foot, but did little to nothing to expand our links by the sea. Although we enjoy a great deal of diplomatic pleasantness and gifts coming from the border with Manchuria, the means to reach our shores for the Japanese sailors and naval traders remain non-existent. The closest point of collision between Amur and Japanese traders is a small settlement in Chumikan, once a harbor for Russo-American steamboat trade, but it remains unavailable to the modern trading boats and is completely unusable as a port.\n\nAlthough Chumikan isn't a second Vladivostok - and neither is it a second Magadan, for that matter - it has a potential to become an important crossroad between the Japanese Isles and the rest of Russia. Should we accommodate Chumikan with modern boat equipment and grant the Japanese liberties within the settlement, our trade with Tokyo will enhance further."

 AMR_lessons_from_the_kenpeitai: "Lessons From the Kenpeitai"
 AMR_lessons_from_the_kenpeitai_desc: "The Kenpeitai, the gendarmerie arm of the Imperial Japanese Army, is an amazing sight to behold. A centralized force against the anti-Japanese elements within the country and abroad, the Kenpeitai is a pervasive organization that keeps order within the Empire and enforces its will on disloyal subjects. As a direct result of the Kenpeitai's hard work, Japan doesn't have a problem with the wreckers sabotaging their orders or degenerates trying to taint their noble culture.\n\nThe Blackshirts and other forces of internal security could use a few lessons from their Japanese colleagues, perhaps even with advice from their consultants. In order to create a force that is capable to ensure stability and suppress the Judeo-Bolshevik instigators whenever they rear their ugly heads, we can use the Japanese Kenpeitai as a model to follow in our beginning."

 AMR_onwards_to_liberation: "Onwards, to Liberation!"
 AMR_onwards_to_liberation_desc: "We have taken a number of steps to ensure that our army is ready for war - first, with the Renegade and the False Tsar, and then with the Bolsheviks to the west. Our strategic thought has been modernized, the Blackshirts integrated with our frontline formations. We have secured ourselves a source of motorized equipment, and have drastically increased the discipline of our troops.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and in some cases the process is still finishing up, but at this point it's become clear that our ragtag group of peasants, mercenaries, and ideologues has been transformed into an effective fighting force that is prepared for the liberation of all of Russia. Finally, Rodzaevsky's dreams are beginning to become clear - a Russia, under the firm control of the true RFP and himself, the Vozhd, at the helm of the nation. Onwards, to liberation! Dlya Rossii!"

 AMR_god_nation_labor: "God, Nation, Labor"
 AMR_god_nation_labor_desc: ""God, Nation, Labor!" With this slogan the Russian Fascist Party made itself known when it was first formed by the visionary members of the White Émigrés in Harbin. In those words lies power and strength of Russian Fascism as a constructive force, directed towards recovery and improvement of the All-Russian State. On those glorious principles a reborn Russia will sit on with dignity, a Russia without the tainting influence of Jewish materialism and the cannibalistic notion of class struggle.\n\nBut the dream of a nationalist Russia guided by God and bonded by collaboration between classes will remain an unreachable dream if every Russian fascist will not discipline himself to the most glorious cause, will not be ready to sacrifice his life for the service to the Russian nation. To oversee the transformation of the All-Russian State, the Party will take the affairs of the spiritual and material world into its own hands, guiding the obedient people to the enlightened spirit of Fascism."

 AMR_define_the_enemy: "Define the Enemy"
 AMR_define_the_enemy_desc: "We cannot sincerely proclaim our mission for a strong and independent Russia when we remain unaware of the enemy who dedicated his whole life to destroy the Motherland we love and cherish. Even having experienced the communist whip on their own skin, many of our countrymen are easily attracted by the messages of "tolerance", taking anti-Semitism as a sign of barbarity, not as a justified answer to the prolonged attempts of the elders of Zion to subdue free nations to their will.\n\nTo keep the Russian people on their path of deliverance from Bolshevik tyranny, it is our sacred duty to enlighten them about their true enemy, the Jewish international cabal that seeks to spread its tentacles through the lies of communism and liberalism, the most destructive ideologies of the 20th century that brought countless misery to Russia. The Jewry derives its power from illusions and tricks it pulls on the ignorant souls - once a Russian man learns to see through it, their power crumbles, like a house of cards."

 AMR_our_own_patriarch: "Our Own Patriarch"
 AMR_our_own_patriarch_desc: "Few strata of Russian society suffered from Bolshevik tyranny as the Orthodox clergy. The imposed exile, the threats of murder, seizure of property and forced denial of the faith - what hardships had they not endured under Lenin and Bukharin! Even after the end of the Soviet rule, many of them remain morally broken in the wake of horror they experienced and don't attempt to return to their traditions, instead indulging themselves in apathy and, at times, heresy. With a moral and organization decay in the Church, it is our duty to rebuild it for the service to the Russian nation.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church will be reorganized under the supervision of the state and the Vozhd himself and the spiritual affairs will be guided by the new Patriarch of all Rus', who will embody the symphonia of Fascist rule and Orthodox faith."

 AMR_for_holy_russia: "For Holy Russia!"
 AMR_for_holy_russia_desc: "If there is a single thing that defined the Russian Fascist Party among its ideological fellows, it is our high spirituality and unfeigned devotion to the idea of the Third Rome, to the Orthodox Faith that held together Russia for a thousand of years and came to her aid in difficult times. How could it be any different? Adopting the principles of Fascism as it was envisioned by Hitler and Mussolini, we brought it to the Russian soul, made it embrace the Russian traditions, very spiritual in nature.\n\nThe Bolsheviks knew the strength that lies with the Orthodox Church and by all means tried to destroy it, to deprive the Russian people of their faith and make it worship their Satanic cults of Mordechai Marx and Lenin, the cults of moral depravity and blasphemy. For such insults, we will not stand. Once more, Russia will be the paragon of Christian faith and God himself will guide his warriors against the forces of the Devil."

 AMR_rodzaevskys_paranoia: "Rodzaevsky's Paranoia"
 AMR_rodzaevskys_paranoia_desc: "It's no secret that the Russian Fascist Party, and, by extension, its head Rodzaevsky, have witnessed countless betrayals by his so-called "peers". Not only have these betrayals been personal attacks on the Vozhd, but many of the most prominent, among them the Renegade in Magadan and the Tsarists in Chita, have been directly linked to the failures of the RFP and Rodzaevsky, stalling for years the liberation of Russia from the communist yoke.\n\nBut no longer. If there has been anything that the Vozhd has learned since the failure of the united front is that no one can be trusted. Success comes from personal hard work and the ability to get things done as an individual. Nothing else will suffice. It's time to take stock and clean house. From the lowest party official to Rodzaevsky's inner circle, none will be exempt from scrutiny, and traitors will be dealt with in the harshest of ways."

 AMR_a_new_supreme_council: "A New Supreme Council"
 AMR_a_new_supreme_council_desc: "Nobody is above Fascist law, and the high members of the Supreme Council of the Russian Fascist Party are not an exemption. Although the Council is supposed to represent the most active and devoted members of the Party, from the very beginning it was filled with careerists and traitors who cared about nothing but their welfare. It would be foolish to assume that those kinds of people disappeared with Matkovsky, as the marks of treachery are evident in every aspect of life in the state. Every single instance of disinformation, corruption and disobedience, even at the lowest levels, could be linked to the highest body of the All-Russian Government, with the same names constantly reappearing on the Blackshirt papers that are gathered on Rodzaevsky's desk.\n\nThe Vozhd always looked with suspicion towards his closest "associates" and now he wills to issue his judgment towards every single one of them, to evaluate the degree of their treachery. Some are indeed faithful followers of Fascism - but more of them have baggage to hide from the eyes of the Blackshirts..."

 AMR_eyes_in_every_home: "Eyes in Every Home"
 AMR_eyes_in_every_home_desc: "The national purification doesn't end at the top - it also has to cover the bottoms. To make the population comply with our ideals, targeted repressions and purges are not enough - we need to ensure submission and vigilance at every level of Russian society.\n\nWhile the Blackshirts will continue - and intensify - their regular activities against the enemies of the nation, the burden of the anti-treason efforts will be imposed not merely on them, but also on the patriotic, conscious citizens of Russia who will aid our efforts against the traitors. A neighbor will watch over his neighbor, the children will be encouraged to report on their dissident parents and our servicemen will be hidden in plain sight, ready to uncover anti-state activities at any given moment.\n\nEvery aspiring insurgent will find himself surrounded by atmosphere of constant terror and persecution, not being able to take a step without fear of retribution."

 AMR_the_heart_of_darkness: "The Heart of Darkness"
 AMR_the_heart_of_darkness_desc: "Row by row, man by man. From the top to the bottom, all must be examined. Blackshirts, party officials, military officers, cabinet members. All will be given a number and tested. Even those who the Vozhd has called "friend" for years are not free from inspection. The party must be purged of its subversive elements, and if it means that Konstantin Rodzaevsky has to put a bullet in every last traitor's skull himself, by God, he will do it. No stone will be left unturned as every party member's loyalty will be tested.\n\n"Stand up for Russia! Stand up for your nation! Look at your brothers beside you. In them lurks a potential traitor, a Judas to our cause. What do we do to Judas? For the betrayer is condemned to an eternity of pain in hell, we too shall condemn them to pain in life. Be ever-vigilant, and prove your loyalty to the Vozhd!""

 AMR_tests_of_loyalty: "Tests of Loyalty"
 AMR_tests_of_loyalty_desc: "While the idea of testing every single party official's loyalty personally was an appealing concept to Rodzaevsky, it simply wasn't practical based on how many there were. For anyone else, this would have been a happy problem, but he had other things on his mind. Instead, the Vozhd has begun to personally devise a loyalty test to weed out traitors and determine who is and who isn't a true member of the RFP.\n\nTo prevent treason and treasonous thoughts, these loyalty tests will be mandatory not just for new members, but for those who are already in the party as well. Everyone but the Vozhd will take them, to ensure that the party is pure and free from those that may sympathize with the Whites to the west and the Renegade to the east."

 AMR_work_will_set_you_free: "Work Will Set You Free"
 AMR_work_will_set_you_free_desc: ""Work will set you free! Find penance for your sins against our people and against our Vozhd!"\n\nThe amount of traitors and betrayers that have been weeded out of our party have been satisfying to the Vozhd, but the great number of them has made their fate of death by hanging or by bullet simply impractical. A number of loyal party members have suggested taking a cue from the Germans. Instead of simply killing the dissenters, we can have them moved to work camps where they will not only learn the consequences of their mistakes under grueling work conditions, but also where they will be able to contribute to our state's eventual victory. For a dead body has to be buried, and a bullet spent for execution. But if a traitor is worked to death, well, his work is his legacy."

 AMR_the_one_true_vozhd: "The One True Vozhd"
 AMR_the_one_true_vozhd_desc: ""Hang the worst and work the rest to death", was a suggestion made by the Vozhd's second-in-command, Lev Okhotkin. With the forced labor camps now open, and the worst of the worst rooted out and hung, the party is finally secure. Known in whispers between top members who survived the purges as "the bloody affair", it's become apparent that the party has since been purged not just of actual traitors, but those who posed a direct threat to Rodzaevsky himself. The only top party officials that disappeared were those who had ever been vocal in their opposition to the RFP's leader, which many believe not to be a coincidence.\n\nRegardless, there is no more competition for the position of party leadership. Not, at least, within Rodzaevsky's realm. There is and can be only One True Vozhd: Konstantin Rodzaevsky."

 AMR_proud_russian_industry_desc: "Even since its uprising, the Russian fascist movement advocated the creation of a truly national industry in a post-Bolshevik Russia, an independent, self-sufficient industry that doesn't rely on international or any other foreign capital and instead serves the interests of the Russian nation first and foremost, an industry which follows the way of strengthening and recreation of the national economy.\n\nThe fascist systems abroad traditionally had an old ally and support in small business. While we don't deny their pleas, the demands of our age require us to pay special attention to heavy industry, a key player in supplying the war effort. From a few rust factories in Amur, Russia will see a rebirth of the Russian industry that will be directly tied to the interests of the state and the nation."

 AMR_national_unions: "National Unions"
 AMR_national_unions_desc: "The degree of control exerted by the state on unions has often been a touchy subject among many senior RFP members. However, it's clear that they do have their uses - they motivate the workers, help our factories follow production quotas, and increase our support among the lower sectors of society.\n\nWe must take action to ensure that our soldiers of industry not only have their protection, but that their protection is overseen directly by the administration. We will found the Natsionalnyy Komitet Provsoyuznogo Prizreniya, the Union Oversight Committee, which answers directly to Rodzaevsky.\n\nThus, only unions that receive the personal approval of our beloved Vozhd, Rodzaevsky himself, will be able to operate with absolute impunity - this will be done so that they can work closely with the NKPP and the state to ensure the workers' adherence to party line. Anything else is entirely unacceptable as we work towards a strong, unified state for the workers!"

 AMR_the_corporate_state: "The Corporate State"
 AMR_the_corporate_state_desc: "It is of paramount importance that we begin reorganizing our economy and society as a whole around the tenets of corporatism - that is, the organization of society by groups such as agricultural, labor, and military, to name a few.\n\nEach one of them representative of their own interests, but ultimately cooperating with one another for the good of a Greater Russia! For the farmers are the beating heart of the state, and the laborers, toiling for hours on end, are Russia's muscles and sinew. The military, ever vigilant against communists and splitters, are Russia's long arms and stone-like fists. The Vozhd will help Russia transcend the confines of a traditional economy and realign herself towards a more efficient, corporate entity."

 AMR_an_iron_grip: "An Iron Grip"
 AMR_an_iron_grip_desc: "From the Stanovoy Range in the north to the Amur River in the south, our Vozhd, Konstantin Rodzaevsky has asserted his control throughout the land. He has reforged the economy along a corporate line, controlled the military, and purged the party of its dissidents. It's clear that Rodzaevsky now reigns, undisputed, as the Vozhd of the Russian State, ready to assert his control over the Far East!\n\nWith the position of our Vozhd secured, it seems that his paranoia is slowly fading, and the fiery, passionate ideologue that once moulded the Russian Fascist Party to his ideals and drew thousands of followers is beginning to reemerge. Now, we can finally focus on dealing with the Renegade in the East and the False Tsar in the west. Hail Russia! Hail the Vozhd!"


 AMR_the_vozhds_speech: "The Vozhd's Speech"
 AMR_the_vozhds_speech_desc: "With the Free All-Russian Army marching forward and the domestic enemies lying behind, the All-Russian Government has become fully prepared for the reunification campaigns ahead. It is an unfortunate fact that the first states to stand in the way of our mission are our former anti-communist allies - but at the same time their incoming humiliating defeat will solidify our image as the legitimate bearer of the White cause and will eliminate the last nests of the White resistance against the Fascist cause.\n\nAs loyal soldiers prepare their arms, the Party statesmen actively organize the war effort and the Russian workers are toiling in factories and manufactories, Vozhd Rodzaevsky prepares for his speech in the capital to identify our goals and inspire the Russian warriors. This day will mark the revival of the anti-Bolshevik crusade, slightly interrupted by traitors, and the reunification of the Russian Far Eastern anti-Bolshevik Front under the banner of the swastika."

A fate self-inflicted, wounds and beatings endured like a whipped dog - one content to accept its fate.\n\nNo more.\n\nNo more will we suffer this humiliation. No more will we accept this indignation. No more will we be content with the scraps we have retained. Our enemies have ruled long enough; it is time they be ended. Today the Russian fascists stand and declare "Enough." Now, we will do more than repay the humiliation we have suffered.\n\nWe will avenge it."

 AMR_a_godly_russia_made_true_desc: "For too long, Russia has been faithless. Indeed, perhaps the humiliation that has befallen Russia and her people was because we turned away from God, and allowed the godless Bolsheviks to sweep across our lands, burn our churches, execute our priests, and punish the faithful. The Bolsheviks, and the Jewish allies, have done much to destroy the Orthodox faith - that is, until the Vozhd brought Russia back to God.\n\nNo more will the Orthodox faith be shunned and persecuted. Indeed, he shall use his authority to spread the word of God far and wide, and restore the Orthodox Church to her rightful place in Russian society. The pagan religions, godless ideologies, and Jewish whispers that have, and continue to poison the Russian mind will be cleansed from this land without delay."

But these were not Russians, but men corrupted by foreign values, specifically the German ideology of Marxism.\n\nThe Vozhd's vision, however, is purely Russian. One rooted in the history of our nation and her people. One with the corruption and vices of the Tsarist regime expunged, and the sickness of communist ideology purged. It is a Russia that embraces her heritage, people, and God. A Russia unapologetic, pure - and strong."

No, a strong Russia shall only come through hard work and sacrifice of her people.\n\nFortunately, there are many such hardworking men in Russia, many whose ingenuity has helped produce much for our state. We shall gather these people, and better organize, train, and utilize them for the ultimate benefit of the state.

Nonetheless, they intend to tear down our state, and if armies are insufficient - then they will take alternative approaches.\n\nThere are many ways a nation can fall without firing a shot.\n\nOur nationalist revolution, and fascist resurgence, is the greatest threat to Jewish power - so they attempt to poison it, even working with the godless Bolsheviks to do so. Their whispers and machinations will infect our people should we lower our guard. Fortunately, we are onto their schemes - and they will find that the national revolution cannot be so easily dispelled."

 AMR_liberation_from_misguidance_desc: "Fascism is a deeply misunderstood ideology among the average Russian. Indeed, if asked, it is unlikely many could even share the basic tenets of the Russian Fascist Party - and some would subsequently insist that truth does not matter, because we are fascists. Such small-minded people are a burden, but one we must confront.\n\nThe solution when faced with ignorance is to offer enlightenment. It is time the Russian people learn the truth of fascism. Learn our beliefs, values, doctrines, and statutes. Let there be no ambiguity of where we stand on the questions that must be asked on politics, society, and life itself.\n\nWhile it may take some time - after enough sessions, and with strategic encouragement, they will come to see things as the Vozhd does and embrace fascism - as all Russia will."

Their networks are vast, their contacts are many, and who we can trust is few. We must take immediate steps to counter this.\n\nWe will counter this in two ways - the first way will be establishing networks of our own contacts. These will be reliable, loyal fascists who will listen and report to us any suspicious activity or treason. The second way will be incentivizing the people to watch for Jewish and Bolshevik spies.\n\nThey may sacrifice some of their own to try to put us at ease, but we will not be fooled with these pawns. Only when their entire networks are abolished, and all of them are serving their last days in camps will our mission be complete."

Others express themselves more violently, by forming mobs that destroy property or intimidate loyal party members.\n\nThese troublemakers, subtle or violent alike, have done enough.\n\nWe will unleash the Blackshirts upon all those who dare speak against the objective truth of fascism, and the leadership of the Vozhd, or otherwise corrupt the people of Russia. Let them spew their heresy to the condemned, as they serve Russia in the labor camps. We do not need to hear it anywhere else."

Who but the Vozhd possess the grace, the vision, and the humility to lead the Russian people to salvation?\n\nNone, that is who!\n\nYet God will not grant us victory without toil and sacrifice. For God, we must fight. For an Orthodox Russia to be restored, it must be conquered. Take heart, good citizen; lend your ears to the words of the party; open your eyes to the Vozhd's vision.

One day, we will no longer need the support of such allies, but for now, we must call upon them once more, and ask them to contribute to our cause, as they have done before.\n\nThe Japanese will demand a price, of course. Perhaps a favor to do, or promise to fulfill in the future. Yet there is likely little to fear from such demands. Their price will be reasonable, and what ultimately matters is our coming victory - one which they have a stake in, and thus have proper motivation to see us through to the end."

First they reduced Russia to the godless husk of the Soviet Union, and still unsatisfied with her humiliation, shattered her into pieces.\n\nWe will not forget. We shall not forgive. But we will learn.\n\nWe must not let our hatred for our enemies blind us to their schemes. They collapsed Russia once, and if our eyes remain closed, they may do so again.

We shall answer.\n\nCommunism, monarchism, such ideologies of failure have shown to be insufficient in restoring Russia to glory. There is only one path capable of returning the Motherland to her rightful place, and the Russian Fascist Party will be her guide.\n\nTake heart, citizens, for under the Party, you will have a future to believe in, and a nation to be proud of!"

In our current position, the existing infrastructure is insufficient for our needs. The numbers are clear, and after taking these risks into account, the poor state of our supply lines will enable our enemies to easily surround our soldiers, and defeat them.\n\nThat these brave patriots of Russia are put at such risk is unacceptable to the Vozhd - and he has immediately ordered that all the supply lines be reinforced and expanded to allow our soldiers to push forward. We will mobilize our workers to accomplish this, which will no doubt claim some of their lives, but such are necessary sacrifices.\n\nThere will be nothing to stop the march of the warriors of Harbin - and the triumph of the Vozhd."

It is one thing to wage war, and control the ground. We are born on the Earth, we are bound to it. Humans were not intended to fly, let alone rule the air.\n\nYet we do.\n\nTo possess and field an air force displays an ingenuity, power, and capability that can only be considered awe-inspiring. It demonstrates that we can break the limits imposed on us by nature, where even the skies belong to us. And the skies of Russia are our dominion, and the nation which controls the skies, controls the war. It is this strength we shall demonstrate, and when fascism spreads across Russia, it will be accompanied by the sounds of roaring jets."

Hollow platitudes, and pathetic lies. The truth is plain for all to see.\n\nStrength is gained through work, wealth is acquired through ingenuity, power is derived by the sword, respect is gained through fear.\n\nWe do not negotiate with the weak. We do not respect the craven. We do not reward the lazy. We do not coddle the warrior. We have no place for such failures. Through these principles, we shall make a Russia that forges great men - and one which commands respect across the world - if not fear."

Yet even these people require hope to strive towards, else they will become stagnant and useless.\n\nWe will give them one.\n\nWe will promise that those who work without complaint, display obedience, and show a willingness to learn the truth of fascism - will be given their freedom. Forgiveness is a virtue, and the Vozhd is surely a godly man - but forgiveness is not given freely - it is earned."

A cacophony of deception, wrapped in the rhetoric of liberation, that nonetheless only served to divide the Russian people, and destroy their national identity. By reducing man to his station, by defining him by his work, is that not exchanging one shackle for another?\n\nThe Vozhd will truly break these shackles, and free the minds of the Russian from this ideological slavery. He will accept and declare all Russians as one people, be they the proud men of Harbin, or the rugged Russian factory worker. There is no struggle, but the national struggle - the struggle to unite our brothers and sisters of Russia under a single banner once more.\n\nAnd this struggle is one we shall triumph over."

The National Revolution is their life, and spreading it to all of Russia, their mission.\n\nNothing must stop us from realizing this dream. To live for one's people is an honor. To die for them as a privilege. We must not let our worldly fears of injury and death hinder our patriots from their noble toil.

We cannot hesitate. We cannot stop.\n\nMillions will stand in our way. Millions of our brothers and sisters, their minds warped by the machinations of the enemy. It does not matter if their choice was made willingly or not, for too many are beyond salvation.

The vision of a Russia under the light of fascism is no longer merely a dream, but a true possibility. Surrounded by enemies on all sides, our enemies were crushed one by one by the strength of our war machine, and ideological conviction.\n\nThis is a notable triumph, yet there is much to be done before the National Revolution is complete. There are many of our citizens who must be educated in our doctrines, the last gasps of resistance snuffed out, even as we prepare for the enemies which rise to our west.

Thus, it has become clear that we are to prioritize the rapidity of this conflict, to ensure the preservation of our strongest troops and to crush the rebellious priest as fast as possible.\n\nSome in our high command have suggested rapid, precise strikes by both regular and specialized troops against key enemy positions, be them military or civilian, in order to destabilize their forces and demoralize their troops; ultimately, this would be aimed at causing the complete collapse of Men's forces.

When we finally caught Men and a small group of dedicated bodyguards attempting to flee westwards towards the rest of Russia, only a brief and rather pathetic degree of resistance was put forwards.\n\nNow, we parade the priest through our capital, and can begin preparing the trial of Alexander Men. The priest has remained silent throughout his capture, perhaps out of cowardice or a misplaced sense of stoicism. But a pair of both secular and religious trials, each carrying the penalty of death by hanging, will ensure that Men's fate is sealed.

The Russian Fascist Party is, after all, a party. And any worthwhile party would ensure that the voices of its members are heard. Thus, the Vozhd has announced a grand Congress of the Russian Fascist Party, where all senior and junior members will attend to voice their opinions and decide on matters of the state going forward, in true fascist fashion. However, Rodzaevsky, and every other party member already knew that there was going to be exactly one opinion on the way forward - and that opinion was the Vozhd's.\n\nRodzaevsky, in the darkest days of his tenure in the Far East, committed wide-reaching purges of all of those who posed an ideological danger to the Russian Fascist Party, and thus himself. There is no RFP without Rodzaevsky - it simply wouldn't be able to exist, and thus, there is no opinion other than Rodzaevsky's."

 AMR_cement_the_foundation_desc: "Rodzaevsky's dearest security minister, Bolotov, who presided over and helped orchestrate the Vozhd's purges, has come to the Vozhd with a tantalizing idea: the formation of the Security Assurance Squads. These squads, officially known as the Otryady Obespecheniya Bezopasnosti, or OOB, would be an equivalent to the Nazis' SS. They would supplement the Blackshirts, who already perform an uncountable number of duties for the state and are, truthfully, a tad overextended; the organization would remain under the control of Bolotov himself.\n\nNo one knows more than Rodzaevsky himself how important the Schutzstaffel was to the Nazis, as well as their key role in Germany's politics. On one hand, it would give us an additional branch of the party that would have a sizable reach in the military and civilian lives of Russians, and it would give the overworked Blackshirts a bit of a break. On the other, it would give a large amount of power to Bolotov. But the Vozhd knows Bolotov - and the Vozhd is in control."

Despite the German troubles with their SS, the Vozhd is wise enough to know not to ever let the OOB get out of hand. The Blackshirts are overextended, and the OOB would be the perfect tool to cement the RFP's control over the populace. A reign of peace for the compliant and a reign of terror for the dissidents. And, what's more, is that in times of war, the OOB can fight alongside our regular troops and the Blackshirts, just as the SS did, oftentimes meaning the difference between glorious victory and humiliating defeat.\n\nBolotov can have his branch - and it will cast a long shadow over Russia and her internal enemies. The Bolshevik and the Jew will know a new type of fear: one that will penetrate their being straight to the core, that will keep them up at night, and will further unify our fine nation against their perfidious efforts to destroy the Russian people. Truly, the OOB will help us build a great future!"

An organization as excessive and powerful as the one that Bolotov is proposing is too similar to the NKVD... and everyone knows how dangerous organizations like the NKVD and the SS can be if they are not kept in check. Clearly, this is Bolotov trying to increase his powers at the expense of the organization which has played such a key part in our triumph. We can't purge Bolotov - not now. He's too useful to us, and his service has been commendable.\n\nBut a small slap on the wrist, a rebuking of sorts, will be able to communicate how unhappy the Vozhd is with this proposal.

Luckily, through Rodzaevsky's "skilled political maneuvering", we've managed to purge the most undesirable aspects and individuals from our party and reform it into a functioning political organ.

He has published, among many other things, a guidebook for how any good fascist family should operate - the man at the head of the house, the woman at his heel, and their children educated and kept busy by the party. Of course, all true Russians will surely be more than willing to adopt this new society, for if they offer resistance, are they interested in nothing but dividing our nation further?"

However, with the Vozhd's foray into Russia proper, it had to be put on hold. But now, as Rodzaevsky works to consolidate his control of the Far East, he has ordered to not just restart the program, but to extend it throughout all of the territory controlled by the party.\n\nLogistical complications aside, this will be nothing but useful for our state, as the planners behind it have already drawn up a number of "physical projects", in reality labor-intensive enterprises, to build character and instill discipline. And, if worse comes to worse, the Union will be handy to mobilize in any potential war-time desperation..."

This movement, while strictly "voluntary", will have local meetings where these women will not only be instructed in their role for society, but also the nuances of our doctrine, as much as they could possibly understand it."

This work had been published and circulating for quite some time.

His tact, wisdom, strength and skilled strategic thought are all traits that should be both celebrated and emulated by any true Russian. But is it not enough just to celebrate the Vozhd and his many talents - the Russian people should live by the Vozhd and die by the Vozhd. They should think of him in their waking hours and dream of him in their sleep. For Konstantin Rodzaevsky is the savior of the Russian nation and is due the respect that he deserves.\n\nThus, we must embark on a multi-faceted attempt to ensure that the people know the importance of their leader, keeping him in their hearts and minds for now and forevermore. Pictures of the Vozhd should be made available and mandatory to display in the home; the life of our dear leader must be learnt in school; our workers and farmers must pledge allegiance to Rodzaevsky before they start work each day.

However, it's time to do away with the legal fiction that our Church is an independent institution.\n\nWe should promote our church further, but we also need to integrate it with the RFP even further - the clergy will be ordained as not just priests, but members of the RFP, and prayers will be made for the success of the Vozhd and his party. Homilies will focus on Russian fascist values. The Patriarch, a man appointed by the Vozhd to his position, will pay more than lip service to his patron.

Our people must know their enemy. With our forces, paramilitary or otherwise, we can identify every single one of our enemies and enact sufficient measures on them - make them targets of public shaming, force them to wear identification of their genetic and political stains, and collect their names and information on a very, very long list.

It's plainly obvious to anyone that the Russian is an inherently adaptable individual who is best suited not just for the romanticizes way of life of the rural peasant, but also to work in our vast industrial complexes, churning out industrial goods and weapons of war. The beating heart of Russia has, since the earliest days of industrialization, its economic and industrial might.\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks and Bukharin took over, reducing the basic Russian instinct to work to a pathetic appeal towards an international worker for their nation, and when their perfidious union collapsed, the subsequent economic fallout shattered Russia's industry. It's time to rebuild."

Their economy, a sector dominated by megacorporations and the use of less-than-willing dissidents - the latter of which we have an uncountable amount - earned them the role of paramount economic power in Europe.\n\nBetter still, the corporate system that Rodzaevsky plans to borrow from the Germans was the one that won them the Second World War and earned them their spot in the powers of today - they shattered the decrepit union with Germany's economic might and sealed their fate during the West Russian War - due almost entirely to their unwavering fascist spirit and their sound economic system. By encouraging the formation of Russian megacorporations and extending the forced labor systems that we already have in place, we can take some lessons from Europe and implement it for the Russia of tomorrow."

 AMR_class_collaboration_desc: "One of the most important tenets of fascism is promoting class cooperation - this is in contrast to the detestable practices of the communists, who attempt to stoke class conflict and liquidate who they deem to be "undesirable". Instead of attempting the insurmountable, we should promote class cooperation between all, from the lowest of the low to the Vozhd himself; it matters not if you are a rural peasant struggling with literacy or an industrial magnate whose heating in his home reminds him of his time spent in Harbin. All should be working towards a single goal - the goal of cooperating with one another and bridging the gap between socio-economic divides.\n\nThe Tsarists ignored the divides, and the Soviets failed in trying to eliminate the divides by killing the other classes. Clearly, the only way forward is to ensure seamless cooperation among the classes."

We've done a lot and worked towards the ultimate goal of a paradise for our workers. However, lots of work still has to be done to improve the factories and the equipment within them for the worker. Class cooperation is necessary, and there is no more important class to get on our side than those who seem to slave away in the industrial centers of our nation, day and night, to create the very finished goods that are necessary for the barest function of civilized living.\n\nThe workers are the ones who started the first revolution, and the second. There will be no third - so long as we ensure that they are on our side from the get go. And to do this we can improve their working conditions and equipment, perhaps with Japanese assistance."

The Russian man marches on Russian food, after all, and where would we be if we did not have any of the latter?\n\nWe can institute generous agricultural grants and cheap loans to incentivize Russians to start their own farms and encourage those who are currently struggling to pull through and continue their work. We cannot - and will not - allow those to our west to outpace our agricultural production based purely on the fact that their lands are more fertile than ours.

The industrialists are the ones who are in charge of the well-being of the economy, below the Vozhd of course - but ultimately the ones who will not only stimulate the Russian economy but drive it forward into the future.\n\nThus, we need to give large government grants and legal concessions to these industrialists and the firms that they represent to ensure that we have taken care not just of the body, but the brain as well. While this may develop into a situation where a number of Russian megacorporations develop a strong hold on our economy, it's these megacorporations who once propelled Germany into superpowerdom and will do so again with Holy Russia."

We should slash taxes for these wealthy individuals and their associated businesses so they're encouraged to invest further into our economy.

Our factory workers work hard to achieve the best for the nation, and it has begun to show. But we need to capitalize on the increase of efficiency and encourage our nascent industrial base to work even harder than it already does.

Now that we have captured the Cheryomuski air base, we can begin to look towards the skies - with the intent on making them the next domain of dominance for the brave Russian warrior.\n\nWith the air base under our control, a decent pool of men to draw from, and our Eastern benefactors likely more than willing to provide us with the materiel and training that we'd need to create a new generation of jet pilots, it seems that the Free All-Russian Air Force is not only easily attainable but around the corner."

 AMR_japanese_designs: "Japanese Designs"
 AMR_japanese_designs_desc: "We cannot have an air force without planes - and the few planes that we have are from eras far gone. It would be laughable to put these ancient beasts in the sky. However, with little experience in the way of jets and modern aircraft, even our most gifted pilots and designers would have trouble coming up with working designs.\n\nThere is an answer, and it lies in Tokyo. The Japanese have thus far been highly generous with the amount of material, economic, and technological support that they have afforded us thus far. Our contacts in the Japanese capital have already indicated to us that the Japanese would be more than willing to provide us not only with designs, but actual jets, that would be able to jumpstart the Free All-Russian Air Force. Of course, these jets won't be cheap, but then again, what is with the Sphere?"

 AMR_expand_cheryomushki: "Expand Cheryomushki"
 AMR_expand_cheryomushki_desc: "Despite us controlling the Cheryomushki airbase - by far the largest in the Far East - it is pitifully outdated. Built to house propeller planes and any plans for modernization abandoned during the initial collapse of the Union.\n\nWhile Cheryomushki is our greatest asset in the creation and fielding of a modern air force, that doesn't mean that it can't be improved. We should expand the airbase and modernize it to make sure that it not only has the space for the great numbers of jets that we have planned to keep there, but also longer runways to take into account the longer lead that the jets need, as well as modern Air Traffic Control towers and mechanisms. We will turn this airstrip into the airport of the future!"

 AMR_quality_in_quantity: "Quality in Quantity"
 AMR_quality_in_quantity_desc: "The Free All-Russian Army is many things. However, the term "overwhelming numbers" does not exactly come to mind when examining the divisions that we employ. While the Vozhd and his high command is reluctant to compromise the quality of our forces, the harsh reality of our situation means that the idea of mass conscription has been floated.\n\nIt's true that this conscription would hurt the quality of our newly-professional army, but as we look to the storms in the west, all are well aware that our lack of raw manpower is our greatest weakness. It's time for us to implement mass conscription across the Far East - at least for now - in order to ensure that our army will clear the way to the west, overwhelming our enemies both in numbers and with their ideological fanaticism."

 AMR_more_men_more_guns: "More Men, More Guns"
 AMR_more_men_more_guns_desc: "With more troops coming in, it's only natural that they'll need weapons. With more men comes the need for more guns. And with the need for more guns comes the necessity of actually making them. The factories must work harder and longer. The managers must push their workers, slaves or free men, to the limit to produce and outproduce our rivals to the west.\n\nAnd with more guns comes the ability to field more men, in a self-perpetuating cycle. Thus, conscription must be extended even further - the young, the old, the unwell, and all of those who were previously deemed unfit must serve. If they can hold a rifle and fire it, they can fight for us. Our army shall be nothing if not numerous, like a black tide swarming over the corrupt and decadent, cleaning Russia and the world from the stains of Zionism and communism."

 AMR_look_to_the_future: "Look to the Future"
 AMR_look_to_the_future_desc: "The sad reality of our position in the Far East is that it is the region within Russia that is the most devoid of people. This means that, even from the beginning of our foray back into Russia, and the dark days in Zeya, we have always struggled to put men in the frontlines. While our position has been solidified in the Far East, our manpower problems have not.\n\nThis, however, does not have to be an issue. While some believe that the path of mass conscription is the best way to solve our manpower problem, others believe that the best way forward is to emphasize a modern army with a highly mobile force. Modelled on the Blitzkrieg strategy employed by the Germans some decades ago, a mechanized soldiery supported by tanks and highly integrated with the air force will ensure that the lack of troops that we have will mean nothing compared to the lightning-quick strikes that we will be able to perform."

 AMR_the_best_of_the_best: "The Best of the Best"
 AMR_the_best_of_the_best_desc: "When the Russian Fascist Party had been split, and when the Tsarists threatened us from their rotten base in Chita, we couldn't afford to turn away any man from the service. The result of this was that, for quite some time, our army contained some of the less-than-savory elements of society. This included drunks, incompetents, and even drug addicts. The situation had become so bad at points that the so-called army functioned more like a group of bandits than a coherent armed force.\n\nNo more.\n\nWe may be suffering from a lack of manpower, but we are a proud nation with a proud army. And if the Free All-Russian Army is to transform itself into a force willing and able to execute highly sensitive Blitzkrieg maneuvers, we need to clear out the most problematic individuals to achieve an army that's truly the best of the best."

Come up brothers, with us the Russian banner is noisy; over the mountains, over the valleys; true Russian is flying!"\n\nOur people may toil endlessly, but our investment into the army has finally paid off. The Free All-Russian Army, with the reforms that we've put through, is the pinnacle of achievement. An invincible force, they will be the sword to the Vozhd's arm in putting to the torch the Zionist Bolsheviks who have thus far prevented us from extending our rule towards the rest of Russia. For God, Nation, and Labor!"

 AMR_the_hand_of_russia_desc: "With our immediate issues settled and the Far East back in the rightful hands of the only true All-Russian Government, we can finally focus on one of the most important things in our bid for reunification - international diplomacy. While the United States of America has long been in the grip of the international Jewry, indicated by their obvious and insulting support of the renegade Matkovsky, there are a number of other powers that we can reach out to in the hopes of recognition and support for our righteous cause in the reunification of Russia. In the west lay the Nazis, the models of our very own movement, have begun to recover from their internecine civil war, and in the east, our benevolent and long-standing patrons: the Japanese. The Vozhd has already assembled a veteran diplomatic corps that will be used to embark on foreign missions if necessary, and has begun writing a diatribe denouncing the powers that are tools of the Jewish shadow-state."

 AMR_overtures_to_germany: "Overtures to Germany"
 AMR_overtures_to_germany_desc: "Now that we've secured the Far East and declared the All-Russian Government, we've been able to legitimize ourselves in the world's eyes. We can finally contact our brothers to the west, the Germans, who have been thus far one of the most active participants in the destruction of the Jewish forces fighting for the creation of their world order. While it is true that the Germans may be wary of a united Russia, especially one that will be as strong as the one that our Vozhd has envisioned, Rodzaevsky has indicated that he is willing to grant preferential resource use and other "minor" concessions in return for German economic and military assistance as well as, perhaps even more importantly, diplomatic recognition as the rightful Russia. A delegation has already been selected from among the RFP's most esteemed and ideological diplomats - all that's left is to send them off."

 AMR_denounce_the_elders_of_zion_desc: ""According to the records of secret Jewish Zionism, Solomon and other Jewish learned men already, in 929 B.C., thought out a scheme in theory for a peaceful conquest of the whole universe by Zion. As history developed, this scheme was worked out in detail and completed by men who were subsequently initiated in this question. These learned men decided to conquer the world for Zion with the slyness of the Symbolic Snake, whose head was to represent those who have been initiated into the plans of the Jewish administration, and the body of the Snake to represent the Jewish people. As this Snake penetrated into the hearts of the nations which it encountered it undermined and devoured all the non-Jewish power of these States."\n\n"Wake, all you faithful Russians, bound to the state and your Vozhd. Wake, all of you, and denounce the Elders of Zion across the Pacific, marionetting the so-called leaders of the 'Free World' as if it was a puppet show for children. These are the men who tout democracy as if it makes them strong, not weak. Denounce these fools who slave away for their Jewish masters.""

 AMR_our_old_benefactors: "Our Old Benefactors"
 AMR_our_old_benefactors_desc: "The Japanese are many things: they are a strong race, a generous people led by an emperor whose administration has gone leaps and bounds for our movement. Many of our soldiers still fight with Japanese weapons while our officers and Blackshirts confer with Kenpeitai agents. To deny the connection that our movement has with the Japanese would be nonsensical. Thus, should we not lean into the relationship that we already have, that was cultivated by our Vozhd and his peers for decades? The Japanese are close to us, both geographically and diplomatically if not politically, and if we seek closer collaboration with them through economic deals and military assistance, perhaps we can even get some of our Russian land back as well as diplomatic recognition..."

 AMR_congratulate_japan_desc: "It has already been well-established that the United States of America is in the grips of the Jew, who have already begun to use the American industrial base and gigantic economy to destroy the work of those who worked so hard to free themselves from the Zionist plots. But was it not the Empire of Japan, whose steadfast emperor and fanatical servants, bravely fought against the Americans and their Jewish puppet masters during the Pacific War, not only fighting them to a standstill, but defeating them, standing triumphant over the American behemoth! Great minds think alike, and there are no greater minds than those of Japan and Russia - a perfect example of how compatible our two nations are. Our future lies with the Japanese. The strength of the Asian peoples will not be undermined under the cosmopolitan onslaught."

 AMR_japanese_recognition: "Japanese Recognition"
 AMR_japanese_recognition_desc: "Our diplomatic carousing and praising of the Japanese has not gone unnoticed, nor has the vast amount of resources that we now sit upon. With some skillful and careful maneuvering, the Vozhd and a team of his most skilled and veteran diplomats, tempered by years of Russo-Japanese relations in Harbin, have begun to draft a proposal to the Japanese to ask for recognition. While the treaty would be hard-pressed to be accepted by the Emperor's Finest, we are willing to... negotiate some economic concessions in return for their international diplomatic recognition and a future of friendship and cooperation. But even achieving their recognition would go a long way to legitimizing our rule in the world's eyes, and it opens up further possible negotiations with our friends in Tokyo."

 AMR_a_mutually_beneficial_arrangement: "A Mutually Beneficial Arrangement"
 AMR_a_mutually_beneficial_arrangement_desc: "Now that the Japanese and her allies in the Co-Prosperity Sphere have formally recognized us, we can look east in order to improve our industrial situation. The Japanese have as of yet to disappoint the Vozhd in their generous "donations" of manpower and materiel. However, with our new relationship with the Great Samurai now redefined, the Vozhd has seen it fit to ask Tokyo for more than just guns - economic development, in the form of industrial equipment and the means to assemble and use it. Of course, this equipment is not free - it comes with a rather hefty price tag. That is, the free reign of Japanese companies within our territory. Surely the Japanese understand, however, our two-way relationship that surely means that the Japanese companies would respect our markets and allow our own companies to work alongside their own."

 AMR_economic_assistance: "Economic Assistance"
 AMR_economic_assistance_desc: "Another great victory for our Vozhd! The Japanese have accepted our proposal, after a few small revisions regarding their market requests they have eagerly, gleefully even, shipped off the industrial equipment to our ports, complete with a complement of Zaibatsu representatives who would instruct their Russian counterparts on how to operate the machinery most efficiently. Already, the Vozhd has declared an "eternal friendship" with the Great Samurai, and Blackshirts have already begun to direct dock workers in preparation for the equipment's arrival as well as scout out perfect places for the factories. There's a lot of work ahead of us, building and operating these factories, finding people to work in them. However, this is a large step in strengthening our relationship with Tokyo."

 AMR_off_to_tokyo: "Off to Tokyo"
 AMR_off_to_tokyo_desc: "Now that our relationship with the Japanese has progress to warm, and we have begun to economically involve ourselves with Co-Prosperity Sphere members, the Vozhd has proposed one more sit down with Japanese diplomats - this time, instead of recognition, it's the matter of "Outer Manchuria", better known to Russians as Priamurye. Seized by the Japanese during the collapse of the Soviet Union, Priamurye has had a short but incredibly troublesome relationship in the hands of its current owner, Manchukuo. "Outer Manchuria", as the Manchukuoan administration has seen fit to dub it is filled with naysayers and bandits... at least, according to them. This is likely, according to the Vozhd, because those there are either rabble-roused Asiatic bandits preying on the inefficiencies of Manchukuo's pitiful police force or intensely patriotic Russians who seek nothing more than to join the All-Russian Government. Of course, the Japanese will demand more of the same - economic concessions - but the Vozhd is more than willing to give them."

 AMR_our_new_provinces: "Our New Provinces"
 AMR_our_new_provinces_desc: "There is a saying in Blagoveshchensk that a man is safer in the pits of hell than he is leaving the city limits. Despite the Japanese having decided to give us back control of Priamurye, extending our administration throughout the large swathe of territory we were granted has proven... troublesome. The cities, what few there are, are filled to bursting with destitute homeless or worse, as well as an out of control drug trade and rampant organized crime. The countryside, however, is even worse. Territory is evenly controlled by Russian bandits and Korean communist insurgents contesting one another in a series of absurd turf wars. But this is Russian land once, and it will be again. The Vozhd has made a speech about the indomitable will of the Russian Fascist Party and its assured victory in Priamurye, even if the Vozhd's enemies are bandits and exiled Koreans. Already, trucks full of the most brutal Blackshirts have begun to arrive in the region, preparing to end the anarchy that reigns."

 AMR_one_step_closer_desc: "With Central Siberia under our belt, through no small effort, the Vozhd has begun to reflect upon himself and the achievements that he has led his people and his party towards. "One step closer" is the statement that his advisors continually congratulate him with. They were right, of course. One step closer, indeed.\n\nBut this one step is a big one. The Russian Fascist Party is no longer a small footnote in the history of the city of Harbin. And Konstantin Rodzaevsky is certainly no "bandit king" like his former detractors attempted to call him. It's time for the Vozhd to become the man that Russia needs him to be. Reliant on the Japanese and hopeful for the Germans no longer. Russia shall stand on her own, with the brave Vozhd at her helm."

 AMR_the_second_party_congress: "The Second Party Congress"
 AMR_the_second_party_congress_desc: "The time has come, the Vozhd has announced, for the Second Congress of the Russian Fascist Party. While there has been some confusion as to why this congress would even be necessary, especially considering how no voice within the party dared to disagree with the Vozhd's ideas, it's become clear that the continual bickering between Bolotov and Shekherev has become intolerable for the head of the RFP.\n\nThe Vozhd has called the congress to order for one, very specific purpose: to remind both Bolotov and Shekherev who was in charge - and that they would be wise to heed the reminder. For the Vozhd no one is "too useful" or "too untouchable"."

 AMR_a_loyal_council: "A Loyal Council"
 AMR_a_loyal_council_desc: "Now that the congress has concluded, it's become apparent that there are still some within the Council who plot the Vozhd's downfall. The original round of purges, aimed at cementing Rodzaevsky's rule was highly effective, but the traitors were much more deeply rooted than previously thought. While a much smaller list of traitors, seditionists, and dissenters has been concocted, this time almost entirely composed of high-ranking Russian Fascist Party members, each name on the list is more prominent than the last.\n\nBut the Vozhd has no tolerance for even a modicum of disloyalty. Konstantin Rodzaevsky is the Russian Fascist Party, and the Russian Fascist Party is Konstantin Rodzaevsky. To wrong one is to wrong the other. Clearly, Bolotov and Shekherev missed some of the traitors in the first round of purges - the Vozhd will not make the same mistake again."

 AMR_a_subservient_party_desc: "The Supreme Council has been, for quite some time, an issue with the Vozhd. They had, at least on paper, the ability to vote on things such as legislation, party membership, and other, increasingly trivial matters. Of course, the votes never diverged much from the will of the Vozhd, but Rodzaevsky has always worried that if they really intended to, the Supreme Council could absolutely veto any progress that he would want to make.\n\nAnd this fact has caused the Vozhd stress. As such, as one of the final actions of the Second Party Congress was to have the Supreme Council take one last vote; to abolish the Council's ability to do just that.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the vote was passed unanimously."

 AMR_the_dawn_of_a_new_russia_desc: "Now that the party has once more been purified, and the political side of the All-Russian Government has been dealt with; the party pacified, the Vozhd's lieutenants reminded of their place, there comes a new era in Russian history - the dawn of a Russia unadulterated by Jews, Communists, and those who seek to harm the Russian nation.\n\nThe Vozhd has announced the beginning of a new stage in the Russian Fascist Party's so-called reclamation of Russia. In a speech entitled "The Dawn of a New Russia", he outlined that the final traitors and threats to his rule had been rooted out and dealt with, and while the Russian people toil onwards, he has begun planning for the final step in national reunification. Like all of his speeches, it ended with the RFP's infamous motto: "For God, Nation, and Labor!""

 AMR_united_in_vision_desc: "There is only one vision for the future of Russia - one vision that is worth talking about. And that vision is of the Vozhd - Konstantin Rodzaevsky. He knows the way forward for Russia, and to doubt him would be tantamount to the betrayal of the Russian state. Thus, any true Russian would know that they should be united in vision - the Vozhd's vision - which will forge the way forward for a strong and independent Russia, one that is free from the tyranny of the Bolshevik and the oppression of the Jew.\n\nOf course, all true Russians would think this, but it is important to make sure that they're reminded of this. In our new territories, the Vozhd's works shall be distributed and made mandatory reading, so that all can understand the importance of the Vozhd's mission."

On top of that, industrial growth and our nation's GDP is skyrocketing. Clearly, the Vozhd's economic plan, heavily based on the one that characterized what was once the economic superpower known as Nazi Germany, is working.\n\nBut it's not enough.\n\nThe plan needs to be expanded, quotas increased, more slaves found, and hours increased further. The system needs to be exported and applied to Central Siberia, where the disgustingly-generous conditions of the workers has led to them being decadent and expecting that we bend to their desires. Never shall we pander to the legacy of the Bolsheviks; these reds will learn, at the end of a bayonet if need be, a real work ethic - and the importance of working towards something greater than self-indulgence."

However, the Vozhd would never claim that their economic model, one of the only reasons that they were able to be so successful for so long, is anything but a recipe for success - and the system itself is certainly admirable.\n\nThus, we should continue to emulate the plan, ensuring that we adhere perfectly to the way in which the Vozhd has planned to repurpose the German model for our own means, and make sure that, like in the Far East, it is applied in Central Siberia to the letter.\n\n"It may not be the easiest life, soratnik, but at the very least you can sing while you work!

He may be a Bolshevik, and, worse still, influenced by the Jewish Zionist elites, but that is not to say that a stopped clock is right twice a day.\n\nHis Siberian Plan, which saw the vast and rapid industrialization of Russia east of the Urals saw a massive uptick in industrial productivity in places where there used to be none. And now, with most of Siberia under our direct control, this has paid off for us in quite a way.\n\nThe Vozhd believes that the Siberian Plan and its legacy can be repurposed in order to facilitate the transition to the Vozhd's vision, reforging it to ensure that we can guarantee that our Russia will be an industrial giant."

And so, the Vozhd has a vested interest in not just extending our administration to this area, but to ensure that it, as soon as possible, falls in line with his vision.\n\nTo do this, many eggs will need to be broken. The workers, comfortable with generous concessions, must be whipped into shape. The ideological opponents to our regime must be purged, either being shot or enslaved. And the dissenters, be they from the highest or lowest rungs of society, must be rooted out and eliminated. Of course, like rats, communists, or Jews, they hide in plain sight - and thus, a grand degree of terror must be inflicted upon the populace of Central Siberia. Only at the end of this terror will the area be ready for integration into the All-Russian Government."

 AMR_dispatch_the_blackshirts_desc: "The Blackshirts, long having acted as both the backbone and the long arm of the Russian Fasicst Party, are the natural choice to play the role of the pacifiers for Central Siberia. They know well how to inflict terror upon our enemies, and are experienced in rooting out Jews and communists, so effective that many in the Far East already refer to them as "the Vozhd's hounds". They, rightly so, do not take offense to the moniker, but instead revel in it, taking pride in the fact that they're able to do their job so effectively.\n\nThey are to pacify the area, by any means necessary. The Vozhd has ordered that they break the enemies of the Russian people among the populace of Central Siberia by any means necessary, and that they shall do."

They're far overstretched in terms of what they're able to do, especially considering that they're already occupied in the Far East pacifying communists and Korean nationalists.\n\nThe OOB, the Otryady Obespecheniya Bezopasnosti, Bolotov's Security Assistance Squads, have been drilling for years now in preparation for domestic pacification and the rooting out of traitors and seditious elements within our territories.

A thorough examination of these individuals will surely turn out some worthwhile candidates for party membership and administrative roles in Siberia."

The hordes of enemies, many times more numerous than us, now lay defeated and shamed.\n\nHowever, it would be foolish to, like we did before, simply send these wretches to the labor camps. We always knew that the conquest of Siberia would be difficult, simply because the land that we held was much less populated than our opponent's territory. As we go west, things will only get worse.\n\nThese defeated soldiers will have to be integrated into our army if we are to have any chance at completing the Vozhd's vision.

Some even whisper that the Vozhd himself is surprised, if not happy, about all of what he and his administration have accomplished.\n\nThere's still plenty to do, but there's also plenty to celebrate: the Vozhd has already begun forging a free, strong, and independent Russia.

The Vozhd's work is cut out for him - and by extension, the people of Russia have their work cut out for them.\n\nThe unification of our motherland is paramount, and the crossing of the Urals will be no small task. And beyond our unification lays the next great challenge: Germany.\n\n"... we shall not waver, we shall not rest.

 amur.1.desc: "Thirty years... For thirty years we have fought, for thirty years we have bled, and for thirty years we have waited and yet... We have accomplished nothing.\n\nThe fall of the unholy Soviet Union was meant to be our hour of victory, a time of triumph in which we would have marched down the Trans-Siberian Railroad and united all of Mother Russia under Rodzaevsky and the RFP's leadership unfortunately something unexpected happened - Mikhail Matkovsky¸ Rodzaevsky's former ally alongside the so-called 'Tsar' Mikhail betrayed our glorious movement and instead chose to carve out their own petty fiefdoms in Magadan and Chita grounding any progress we had made in our Liberation to a halt and trapping us in one of the remotest corners of Siberia in the progress.\n\nThus here in Amur we have remained, too weakened by the traitors to do anything except rattle our sabers and gloat about the times gone by. However if there is one thing that these past thirty years have taught us it is patience... It may not happen this decade or the next or even in our life times but one day we shall cast down the Traitors and liberate Holy Russia once more!"
 amur.1.a: "Slava Rossii!"

 amur.2.t: "The Matter of Blagoveshchensk"
 amur.2.desc: "Blagoveshchensk is a town of little worth and even less significance. At least, that's how the Japanese see it. Renaming it to Haianpao when it was annexed into their miserable puppet kingdom of Manchukuo, as they did when they stole the great eastern jewel of Vladivostok.\n\nTo Rodzaevsky, however, it means the world, for it is the Vozhd's hometown. It is therefore also the birthplace of the RFP and Russian National Socialism, and once we hold the entirety of Russia it will be the birthplace of the nation itself. As any good nationalist knows, having one's home occupied by foreign invaders is an unacceptable state of affairs and does severe harm to the morale of the people. Just as the Tsars would have fought tooth and nail for Saint Petersburg, we must have Blagoveshchensk!\n\nThankfully, since neither the Japanese nor their Manchu servants have any real interest in the town, they are unlikely to have any good reason for turning down the Vozhd's righteous demand for our sovereign territory. They will lose a 'troublesome' population and gain our eternal gratitude... with the addition of some reasonable concessions to their greedy industrialists, no doubt."
 amur.2.a: "I'm sure they'll agree."

 amur.3.t: "Border Patrol"
 amur.3.desc: "The gunshots, barking dogs, and the bright lights coming from both vehicles and flashlights were indicative of the nightly border patrols - the same ones that Anton Shvets and his wife-to-be were trying to avoid. Bundled in the warmest clothes that they had, including thin jackets and boots, they both had large packs on their backs. Shvets had recently been outed for his Jewish heritage by a neighbour who had done some looking into his family history. Not intending to wait around for his execution, he convinced the woman he loved to flee with him westwards, towards Irkutsk.\n\nAvoiding the roads, the pair made their way westwards along the ditches to the left of what few roads there were - even in the day, traversing the Siberian wilds was dangerous, but in the pitch black of the night, it was impossible. And so the two refugees continued, seemingly at a snail's pace, trying to avoid the obvious interactions with anyone else, especially the RFP's incredibly strict border patrols. Shvets, who had once worked as a logistics administrator for the very border patrols he was now avoiding, knew the reputation that they held. Frequently, they would simply execute those fleeing the regime on sight. Those that they didn't execute, they tortured and interrogated in case they were enemy agents. Occasionally, so the stories went, the patrols would even enter territory not controlled by Rodzaevsky and terrorize villages within their range. Shvets kept all this in mind as he trudged ever westwards, following the road on its depressed shoulder. However, they eventually reached a bridge that spanned a shallow, but surely frigid river. Svhets looked at his partner, and then back at the bridge, before the distant sounds of motors began to rise over the din of wildlife. Lights began to peak over a hill across the bridge, and Shvets was forced to make a decision. He gave a simple command - "Get down!" and lay down, in a prone position, by the side of the road. Initially, Shvets had considered either attempting to run across the bridge or go through the water, but both would mean certain death - the latter from the cold and wet, and the former from the fascists. As the pair lay there, they waited for the patrol to pass. Feeling the sets of tires, they counted - one truck, two... where was the third? Shvets slowly raised his head to see the third truck had stopped shortly after the bridgehead - and there were soldiers getting out of it. "Run!" Shvets yelled, but as the woman he was with stood up to flee, she was shot twice. Shvets, reluctant to move, slowly put his hands up from his prone position, as the soldiers surrounded him."

Anton finished his pledge of allegiance with gusto, puffing out his chest as he thumped his right fist against his chest and then threw it outwards and upwards to his assembled comrades. "Glory to Russia!" he shouted, voice clear in the chilly air of the lecture theater.\n\n"Glory to Russia!" came the roaring, united refrain from the cadets, as they too saluted the army's newest lieutenant.\n\n"Glory to Russia!" barked Major Korbut, who also took his turn to salute before stepping in front of Anton, producing a lieutenant's bar fashioned from brass and pinning it to his breast. "Lieutenant Anton Mikhailovich Melnikov, you are henceforth an officer of the All-Russian Army. You now represent all that is best in the Russian race. You will not fail. You will not falter. You will not give a single step to the enemy. You will uphold the glory of the Vozhd and the All-Russian Government against the Judeo-Bolshevik menace and its puppets, wherever they might be found. Do you understand?"\n\nAnton saluted again, stretching out his arm so far and fast that he felt something pop in his elbow. "Yes, sir! Glory to Russia!"\n\nKorbut nodded approvingly, and Anton allowed himself a joyous grin. He knew he'd done well - he had earned top marks in every course, made child's play of every physical trial and proven his loyalty by denouncing the degenerate homosexuals who had infiltrated the Rodzaevsk Officers' Academy. Of course, as a good Christian man, he understood the value of humility - but in that moment, Anton Mikhailovich allowed himself to bathe in some well-earned pride."

 amur.5.desc: "Kohaku Tanaka was a rarity among the Kenpeitai - he could speak fluent Russian. From his time in Harbin and working with the Russian White movement that the Japanese had harboured in opposition to the Soviet Union, Kohaku took a great interest in the language, and had learned it quite well in his years spent in Manchuria. Because of this, the aging Kenpeitai agent made a natural choice for being sent to Zeya.\n\n"It's the last one, we promise, and then you're done." was what he was told when he protested the assignment.\n\nHe had wanted to retire for quite some time - he hadn't seen his hometown in decades, and he certainly wasn't getting any younger. But now, Kohaku found himself in the freezing Amur region, instructing Russian Blackshirts in the ways of dissent suppression, a hard series of lessons learned by the Kenpeitai in Japan, Korea, China, and beyond. They had been instrumental in the immediate post-war, ensuring that the Co-Prosperity Sphere was secure. Kohaku himself hadn't played a significant role in that, but he had been briefed and trained on exactly what was done and how. And in turn, he would go about imparting that information on the Russians. It wasn't a perfect system, but it worked.\n\nKohaku, after a brief seminar about information extraction and torture, had found himself sat at his desk in the front of the classroom, making some notes in Japanese to send back to his handlers in Harbin - specifically about the material and its clarity. As he wrote, he was interrupted by a knock at the door.\n\n"Come in." Kohaku spoke, his Russian heavily influenced by his Japanese accent. A younger Blackshirt, perhaps no older than 24, entered. It was typically unusual to see such young "students". But Kohaku knew him - Vlas Kozlov. He was a good study, asked a lot of questions, and his reputation for brutality was already known among his older peers.\n\n"Mr. Kohaku," Kozlov spoke. "I had a question about a seminar that I had attended of yours a few days ago - you spoke about the suppression of dissent in recently-conquered territories. When you spoke, you mentioned separating families and communities based on cultural lines. What if there are no variant cultural lines to separate?"\n\nIt was a good question, Kohaku thought, before responding. "Then you look for other differences. Peasant and noble, farmer and factory worker. Anyone can conquer, but to ensure those conquests remain, you must divide. Cultural lines are the easiest to divide upon, but any division will work.""

 amur.6.desc: "There wasn't much in the way of soldier's comforts for those who were a part of the Vozhd's All-Russian Army. Harsh weather, harsh discipline, and harsh enemies were what a lot of the older soldiers claimed were the "Three Harshes" that all fascist soldiers had to overcome to become a true man. This wasn't entirely untrue - but it wouldn't be accurate to paint Rodzaevsky's army as an entirely draconian organization. Morale was high, higher than it had ever been. Individuals like Yuri Orlov, the sixteen year old who had lied about his age to join the army, were more than just unwilling conscripts. Orlov, who had lost his father during the war with the Renegade in Magadan, was an ideological fanatic who had been indoctrinated by both his father and his schooling to believe in the Russian Fascist Party and the Vozhd as the paramount temporal authority on Earth. Star struck, and soon after his sixteenth birthday, Orlov went to the recruitment office and signed up for the army. Not exactly the perfect physical specimen, Orlov was a little shorter than most, and certainly skinnier than what he should be, likely as a result of malnutrition. That being said, he was as ideologically motivated as the most fanatical Blackshirt - and he wasn't the only one.\n\nYuri found himself and his brothers, after training one day, with nothing to do - a rare moment in the rigorous life of an All-Russian soldier. While his brethren opted to go to Church and then head into the nearest town, Yuri decided to stay back in the barracks and read. He had attained a series of pocket versions of the Vozhd's work from his local Blackshirt political officer, including the Azbuka Fashizma and Contemporary Judaisation of the World or the Jewish Question in the 20th century. Both of the works were on the older side of the Vozhd's publications, but Orlov had wanted to start from the beginning. Having stored his rifle properly, in his casual dress, Orlov had laid back on his uncomfortable bunk and opened his pocket book. The sixteen year old, who had never been exposed to any other ideology in his entire life, was enamored by the topics covered, including the toxicity of Bolshevism and the dangers of the Jewish conspiracy. When his friends came back from their day in the town, he was excited to discuss with them all he had learnt from the Vozhd's writings."

They are the greatest enemy that the civilized world has ever faced, yet they feign the appearance of weakness - be not fooled by their numbers or appearance, for they will seize any opportunity to grow fat upon the blood of yourself and your family! When you find a Jew, you must not hesitate - be it man, woman or mewling spawn, act swiftly and without mercy! If you are outnumbered, report to the local RFP militia, for the Jews possess a low cunning that makes them dangerous in numbers!\n\nBOLSHEVIKS: A vile mixture of Jews and their grovelling servants, the Bolsheviks were the means by which the Elders of Zion laid low Holy Russia. Bolsheviks are easily recognised even when disguised, thanks to their tendencies towards distinctly Jewish behaviour. They are mad ideologues who will not hesitate to commit acts of theft and murder to further the aims of their masters. However, deception is second nature to them, and they will go to any lengths to obfuscate their true identities. If you suspect someone to be a Bolshevik, or influenced by Bolshevism, report them immediately to your nearest Russian Fascist Party representative!\n\nFREEMASONS: The most cunning and subtle of our foes, the Freemasons are agents of Judeo-Bolshevism who infest the circles of wealth and power. Any man of substantial means or intellect who has not sworn absolute loyalty to the Vozhd is a possible Freemason or agent thereof, and should be subjected to intense scrutiny at all times. Should a friend, relative or acquaintance begin to accumulate wealth without sufficient explanation, or a woman show interest in intellectual matters - inform a Russian Fascist Party representative. He shall begin a thorough investigation, to set your mind at ease and ensure the safety of your people.\n\nDo your duty for God, Family and Nation!

 amur.8.t: "A Holy Mission"
 amur.8.desc: "As the Gospel reading ended, the new Patriarch of Russia stepped forward to take the Deacon's place before his flock. The once-modest church in Zeya had been decorated from floor to rafters with gold and icons taken from Harbin. A great mass of blackshirts, soldiers and regular citizens packed the floor, pressed into every corner like sardines. Those outside crowded around half-open doors, eager to hear the hierarch's first homily.\n\n"Brothers and sisters in Christ," he began, his voice filled with the stern strength of a seasoned preacher, "we live in the darkest of days. The Lord looks down upon our holy land, and surely weeps. Where once there stood a nation of wise priests, humble peasants and pious soldiers, there is now little more than ash and ruin. His chosen people have been ravaged by war, famine, pestilence and strife. We all seek answers to soothe our souls, the greatest of which must be: Whom do we hold responsible? Who has brought the ruinations of Satan to Holy Russia?"\n\nThe church was silent for a moment, save for the soft whistling of wind through loose shingling. "The Sons of Cain!" the Patriarch suddenly bellowed, his audience thoroughly enraptured. "The murderers of Christ, who have survived in the home of the faithful for generations, as rats in the walls! The Disciples of Judas, who multiply with every passing year, sup on the blood of the Lord's children and make a gruesome feast of Holy Russia! Who shall deliver us from these parasites, my flock? Who will bear the torch of the true faith and wield the scourge of Christ to drive out the Jew?"\n\nThe Patriarch raised his arms to the heavens, the sweat of adulation dripping into his ashen beard. "The Vozhd, my children! His name is unspoken prophecy fulfilled; Constantine, reborn, come to deliver Holy Russia unto salvation! His will and vision, bestowed by the Holy Spirit, will illuminate the path for our brave Christian soldiers as they sweep aside Pharisaical Bolshevism and liberate our earthly paradise from the minions of the Great Deceiver! Soon, the Lord will smile upon us once more, and all Creation will know Christ's truth of National Socialism!""

 amur.9.t: "The Paranoid Vozhd"
 amur.9.desc: "Konstantin Rodzaevsky, Vozhd of all Russians and the true leader of the Russian Fascist Party drifted into his office in his traditional pseudo-military garb. Removing his hat, he set it down on his archaic oaken desk and ran a hand through his grizzled hair. "Another sleepless night..." he grumbled to himself as he sat himself in his chair, sighing as he did so. Reports of troop movements, suspected traitors, and production quotas had already been placed neatly on his desk, likely by some orderly or assistant whose name he couldn't be bothered to remember. They were all signed by his confidant - Bolotov - who had become one of his closest allies in the past decade. He didn't even bother with any of the reports except those regarding suspected traitors. Opening the portfolio marked "internal dissent", Rodzaevsky reviewed some of the names, muttering to himself. "Bogachyov... Tkachyov... " His eyebrows raised at the third name he read - Ryzhov. Mikhail Ryzhov had been an extremely loyal senior party official in Zeya, and Rodzaevsky had known him personally for a number of years, but it sort of made sense. About a year back, he had made a joke about the party's financial infrastructure in Zeya, and Bolotov had produced some fairly convincing evidence that linked him to the long-gone Zeya banker, Berezhnoy, who had attempted to hide his Jewish ancestry. The Vozhd grimaced. Replacing Ryzhov would be a pain, but if he had fraternized with Berezhnoy, what other company had he been keeping? He picked up the phone on his desk, and dialled his trusted security minister. "I've seen the new lists. Move on Ryzhov. Move on them all."\n\nThe truth was that Ryzhov was innocent. The only contact he ever had with Berezhnoy was when he verbally assaulted him for his Jewish ancestry. The Vozhd's paranoia had clouded his judgment but as long as Bolotov kept producing "traitors", Rodzaevsky's paranoia would be sated. Ever since the Renegade split the party and the united front fell apart, the All-Russian State was dominated by the Vozhd's suspicions."

 amur.10.t: "The Purge of the Supreme Council"
 amur.10.desc: "The Supreme Council met once a day, usually in the mornings, seven days a week in the capital of the All-Russian Government. The building they met in, a converted hotel, was made to look much grander than it really was. A giant, glowing swastika, akin to the one that Rodzaevsky had installed in the RFP building in Manzhouli decades ago, had been placed on the top of the old hotel. Ostensibly, the Supreme Council was a body of government that would determine laws, enforce ordinances, and help guide the Vozhd in his quest to reunite Russia. However, to any independent observer, it would seem closer to a king and his court than a council of equals. Truthfully, the Supreme Council wielded little power. Most members were the oldest thugs from the RFP, back when it was an exiled movement in Harbin, and for the most part, none of them dared challenge the policies of the Vozhd, especially in his current volatile moods.\n\nThus, the Supreme Council was more of Rodzaevsky's echo chamber than an actual functioning arm of the government. That being said, it didn't prevent the paranoid Vozhd from thinking that there were dissenters, even among his oldest and most trusted advisors. So when the Council met this morning, Rodzaevsky, Bolotov, and Okhotin stood at the end of the conference room and watched as one in every three council members were forced out of their seats by Blackshirts and arrested for anti-Russian activities. In the coming days all of those arrested would be publically trialled and hung, their names stricken from the party registry, and their memory buried.\n\n"Finally," Rodzaevsky would mention to Bolotov, "we've secured the highest echelons of our party's leadership."\n\nThe security minister tacitly agreed. "Of course, my Vozhd. They were plotting. I'm glad we're rid of them." Even Bolotov had begun to doubt the extent of his purges - how long before Rodzaevsky turned on him?"

 amur.11.desc: "Bolotov checked his watch nervously. It read 1:13 AM. Rumor had it that Rodzaevsky was typically up at this time, but rarely convened his advisors for any governmental needs. "But why has he called me in?" Bolotov had asked himself as he hurried to the Vozhd's residence. Had he finally outlived his usefulness?\n\nWhen Bolotov let himself into Rodzaevsky's study, he found the Vozhd with a bottle of vodka and a series of documents on his desk. Bolotov had recognized them immediately - they were the ones that he had given the Vozhd the evening prior. He had snuck in with the rest of his reports a dossier about the activities of Lev Okhotin, Rodzaevsky's longtime second-in-command. Embezzlement and bribery were the charges levelled towards him, and a faintly traceable path of the money was included in the dossier. As Bolotov let himself in, Rodzaevsky didn't even greet him.\n\n"Is this true?" he asked. The tone of his voice evidenced his exhaustion, but the look in his eyes showed betrayal - but more than that, bloodshot and with bags. The rumors were true; the Vozhd was an insomniac. Bolotov didn't even try to feign ignorance.\n\n"It's what the evidence shows, my Vozhd. I couldn't believe it myself. Lev's been stealing from the party for... well years maybe." There was a pause.\n\n"And what of the bribery? Can we look into those who took the money Okhotin offered?" Rodzaevsky asked. The security minister grimaced.\n\n"Unfortunately not, my Vozhd... You see the names there, Kvassov and Bogachyov, both executed for treason, the latter last week. Seems like we caught them first." There was a second, prolonged silence, Bolotov awkwardly standing in front of Rodzaevsky's desk. Rodzaevsky lethargically waved his hand.\n\n"Dismissed."\n\nAs Bolotov saw himself out, the Vozhd's mind raced. Could Okhotin have hidden this for so long? How could he have done this? Or was this just a play by Bolotov to remove competition?"

 amur.12.t: "Suffer Not the Traitor"
 amur.12.desc: "There had been much debate between Rodzaevsky and Bolotov over the nature of Okhotin's trial: the former had wanted a private trial, and the latter wanted to show the merciless nature of the Vozhd in regards to traitors, no matter their importance. Ultimately, the Vozhd's opinion won out. Despite Okhotin's betrayal, he couldn't bring himself to humiliate one of his closest friends and followers. He had stuck with him for better or for worse for decades. Lev Okhotin was quietly arrested following a Supreme Council meeting and taken to one of the many political prisons that contained those doomed for execution or deemed not important enough to kill. Once there, he was beaten mercilessly by the very Blackshirts that he had helped induct into the program, professing his innocence and dedication to the Vozhd the entire time. Eventually Rodzaevsky himself came to visit his old friend. As the door to the interrogation room swung open, the Vozhd and Okhotin stared at one another. One, a paranoid insomniac with sunken eyes, a grizzled look, and aged well beyond his years. The other, an older man, completely bald, skin mottled and pockmarked from years of alcoholism and harsh weather, beaten to a pulp. Both were radically different men than they were back in Harbin.\n\n"Get out", the command was quietly uttered to the Blackshirts who had been assigned to guard Okhotin. As they filed out, Rodzaevsky stopped the last one from leaving. "You, stay", he ordered. Rodzaevsky, coat hung around his slumped figure, approached Okhotin, tied to a chair in the middle of the room. He kneeled down to eye level with his friend. After a pause, Rodzaevsky asked, "Why? Why would you do this?"\n\nLev answered through swollen lips, "I've done noth-" the Vozhd cut him off.\n\n"Shut up!" he yelled. "You, kill him." He said to the remaining Blackshirt as he stood, who pulled out a pistol.\n\nOkhotin understood then - eyes widening, he began to speak. "I profess my loyalty to Russia and my Vozhd! For God, Nation, and-"\n\nA gunshot between the eyes cut Okhotkin off, killing him instantly."

 amur.13.desc: "One of the few remaining organizations within the Vozhd's territory with the intent to end the rule of Konstantin Rodzaevsky were the Sons of the Tsar, a minor group of monarchists who were sympathetic to Mikhail II's cause. They mostly occupied lower bureaucratic positions in the town of Rodzaevsk, previously protected by the incompetence of the Manchukuoan authorities and utterly cut off from the White movement in the east. They had been hiding in plain sight, so to speak. That was, until, one of their members had lost his nerve. Following an interrogation, standard procedure by the Blackshirts for rooting out traitors, he had decided to come clean. Approaching the party's regional office in Rodzaevsk, he told the officials everything he knew. Plans, meeting places, individuals involved and their degree of involvement. When he was done, the party officials laughed. One mentioned that they had taken down resistance movements three times as large as his. They promised him immunity from prosecution, but on his way out, he was promptly arrested.\n\nThe man, forced into a truck with a number of Blackshirts, was brought out and forced to bear witness as every member of his dissenting movement was rooted out. Each time, the Blackshirts made a big show of the man's role in the collapse of the movement, curtseying and bowing in the most sarcastic of manners, and thanking him in superfluous ways, patting him on the back and acting as if they were his best friend, all in front of his former compatriots who he had helped bust. As the last of the names on the list were ticked off, the man was taken to the outskirts of the city and shot, ultimately being left unburied. The rest were simply imprisoned in the work camps and relegated to forced labor - for while it may be terrible to be a traitor, there's nothing worse than being a traitor to the traitors, for no honor at all is spared."

 amur.14.t: "Ensuring Loyalty"
 amur.14.desc: "The Rodzaevsk Officers' Academy was far from a glorious building. In Zeya, the Vozhd had put a significant amount of time and money into restoring a building for the RFP's military officers to ensure that they would have a comfortable and prestigious place to train and learn. However, its sister complex in the Vozhd's hometown was a far cry from Zeya. A two-story converted schoolhouse, it was used both for official RFP duties as well as for the training and drilling of local officers before they were sent off to the fronts. One such use for the building was the implementation of the loyalty tests that Rodzaevsky himself came up with. In a classroom, about thirty members of the party were crammed into small desks to take these tests - from novice Blackshirts to aging Orthodox priests, it seemed that anyone even remotely tied to the regime was preparing to write the tests. At the front of the classroom, a grim-looking Blackshirt, perhaps in his late 50's stood, his sidearm intentionally very visible. He barked the instructions for the test as if they were slaves in a labor camp rather than party officials.\n\n"You get one hour! You must answer all questions posed. No questions are to be asked to either your neighbors or to me. Anyone caught cheating or attempting to cheat will be punished in a harsh manner. When you are done, bring your paper up to the front. After that, you will leave. Do not wait around. You may start."\n\nLittle did most of the test takers know, but the very man giving the tests in the first place just passed his the day before. Flying colours, of course, as that is what the Vozhd demanded out of each and every person who is associated with the party. For those who did not perform up to the standards set, consequences ranged from being stripped of their title and party role to being sent to the forced labor camps for the fear of traitors.\n\nAs Rodzaevsky would go on to comment to his Supreme Council, "All this to ensure the security of the party.""

He had forgotten when exactly he was brought to this camp. A month? Two? Four? He never had access to a clock, and the days all felt the same, and his muscles kept deteriorating. He felt like he would've gone insane at some point.\n\nThere was something keeping him grounded, however-- or, rather, someone. The voice snapped him back to reality and he felt his arms tire in carrying the barrow. Focusing again, he could make it out as Ilyanov. Turning to face the man, they exchanged warm smiles, and Pushkin felt immediately better. "Hello, Ilyanov." He said, beginning to push the barrow. "How are you?"\n\n"How am I?" He asked, letting out a chuckle. Ilyanov was thin, almost wiry, but he wasn't starved. Pushkin found that an attractive trait amongst many in him. "I should ask you that question! Come on, cheer up, we'll get out of this prison and make something of our lives!" Pushkin's breathing became a bit awkwardly paced. "... Did you just say our?"\n\nIlyanov's eyes narrowed, and he gave a sly smile. "I don't have to repeat myself, you know. In fact..." he began, walking closer and deciding to chat with Pushkin to pass the time until a guard noticed him. "It was your idea to begin with. A nice cabin out in the woods of Siberia. You always wanted to be a hunter." Pushkin gave a bit of a shaky grin. "W-well, I... I did say that, didn't I? But..." He looked around the camp once again. It was of a dreadful atmosphere.

A series of names were put forward by both the remaining members of the Supreme Council as well as Bolotov himself, each of them vetted carefully for potential loyalty issues, as well as examinations of their past actions as members of the Russian Fascist Party. Name by name was eliminated from the list; Andreev had a history of minor insubordination, Viktorov had too many friends in low places, and Isaev just wasn't really liked by the rest of the council. These were just a few examples. Eventually, however, a series of names were chosen. Loyal, skilled, and fanatical were the trio of traits that the decision was ultimately based on. The new Supreme Council, between the survivors of the purge and the new members, had become an incredibly loyal institution to Rodzaevsky - in reality, little more than an echo chamber for his thoughts and direction.\n\n"Repeat after me: I believe in the One God. I promise to serve the One True Vozhd. I will do so loyally and with complete faith and confidence in his decisions and beliefs. I believe in the Russian Fascist Party and its ability to unite all Russians under one banner. For God, Nation, and Labor!"\n\nThe ceremony for swearing in the Supreme Council was unannounced to the public and remained an austere occasion. Undertaken in the early morning, little decoration or celebration was given, but as Rodzaevsky had finished confirming each new member of the council, he gave them a tri-colored sash of black, gold, and white, adorned with a single, iron swastika. A short, curt welcome and congratulations were given by the Vozhd, before instructing them where they needed to sit and the various responsibilities that they would need to fulfill for their position. As the ceremony wound down, the morning ceremony progressed into a standard daily meeting of the Supreme Council. The new members, led by the old, filed into the conference room, where the Vozhd took his place at the head of the council. Sitting in his chair, he looked over his new council, their loyalty secured.\n\n"Shall we begin?" he asked, already knowing the answer."

For weeks, the city had been bustling - not only were people going about their standard lives, but they had also attended show trials, watched the executions of traitors, and snitched on their neighbours and loved ones. The past few weeks had been hard on everybody, and the fanatical pace at which both the purges and the subsequent executions had taken clearly had inflicted a collective toll on the capital's population. No more evident was this fact than in Konstantin Fedorov, a minor party official that had only narrowly escaped persecution himself by turning in his brother, Alexei, for "anti-Russian activities". Fedorov had been working late shifts to process extra paperwork, effectively pushing pencils for higher-ups who couldn't be bothered. It was often said that the Russian Fascist Party was a living, breathing thing and people like Fedorov were what kept it alive. Regardless, Fedorov had, with some skill, some betrayal, and a lot of luck, avoided the purges. And he wasn't exactly sure how he did, nor how he felt about it.\n\nFederov walked his standard after work walk back to the measly apartment that he shared with his deceased brother's wife and daughter, neither of whom knew that it had been Fedorov who had given him over to the party. Up one street, to the left, cross the street, and Fedorov found himself on his final stretch home - past the Zeya gallows. He distinctly remembered how, at the very center of the town, near the gallows, there seemed to be a persistent din, cheering, jeering, screaming, gun shots. He had become so used to it that the first thing he noticed while walking past the gallows was the complete silence. No one in the square, no one to be seen in the evening twilight, with what little light was left supplemented by the town's streetlights. Fedorov did something that he had not done in weeks: he stopped. And he listened. A smile crept across the junior bureaucrat's face. Silence. Complete, and utter quiet. As if a giant boulder had been released from his shoulders, Fedorov felt free. Were the purges over for good? Who cared, thought Fedorov, for right now, he was free. Free from guilt, free from threat. He offered a prayer to God before walking the rest of the way home, a skip in his step."

For God, Nation, and Labor!"\n\nToday, the Vozhd, Konstantin Rodzaevsky gave a rousing and impassioned speech in his capital and Zeya, followed by a grand military parade that featured both the regular armed forces and the paramilitary Blackshirts, marching interlocked with one another, as well as the ceremonious lighting of a number of effigies of the False Tsar and the Renegade in Magadan. The speech was incredibly well received, even among most of the common folk, who were "politely asked" about it. The speech was even broadcasted across the airwaves, and in an incredibly rare move, also televised, to the few Russians who had a television. The work, which would become known as the Zeya Balcony Speech, roused the armed forces and officially announced Rodzaevsky's intentions to reclaim the total leadership of the Russian Fascist Party and end the False Tsar's farcical regime in Chita. Compared to the state that the Vozhd had been in not a year prior, to see him reinvigorated and once again passionate against his enemies assuaged the fears of many in the Blackshirts and the military, who had begun to doubt his competency for leadership following his slide into paranoia."

 amur.19.t: "The Broken Crown"
 amur.19.desc: "Traitor. Pretender. Bastard. These were some of the kinder terms being yelled at Mikhail Andreevich Romanov as he was being led up to the Zeya gallows. Placed in the center of the town, the gallows had once been the location of the town's market, but had been repurposed once Rodzaevsky's terrors started. The RFP's officials had packed the square with Blackshirts and peasants with the promise of a banquet afterwards, in celebration of the death of the False Tsar. The crowd's mood had gone from quietly excited to raucous with the arrival of Mikhail and his escort of Blackshirts. Despite having been wearing prison clothes for most of his time in the city, he had been dressed up in his Tsarist regalia for the execution. It appeared as if the deposed "royal" had aged considerably since his capture. The Blackshirts forced a path through the crowd, and curbed the worst of the physical abuse that was being hurled at Mikhail, who was being propelled forward, a Blackshirt grasping each of his arms and forcing him to walk. The entire journey to the gallows, through the crowd, the False Tsar protested, begged for mercy, and pleaded with his escorts to let him go. This only played into the showiness of the event, and caused surges of excitement amongst the younger Blackshirts who were accosting him.\n\nAs he was led up to the gallows, alongside the executioner was the RFP-appointed Patriarch of the Orthodox Church of the East and the Vozhd himself. The Patriarch performed the Last Rites and performed a prayer for Mikhail's soul in the afterlife. Rodzaevsky remained silent the entire time, watching the process and reveling in the scene that Mikhail was making for himself. As he was being prepared to be hung, the executioner asked if he had any last words.\n\nTearfully, the False Tsar said, "I... I never wanted any of this... Please, just... I want to go home."\n\nThe gallows were dropped, and Mikhail's death signaled the end of the Eastern monarchist movement."

 amur.20.desc: ""...There is nothing worse than betrayal. I'd rather consider my own death than betrayal, but yet, that's what I've been dealt. And as such, I must react accordingly. I hereby condemn you, Mikhail Alexeyevich Matkovsky, the worst of the betrayers, the Renegade in Magadan, to death."\n\nEver since the collapse of Matkovsky's regime and his subsequent capture by Rodzaevsky's loyalists, the Renegade has remained nearly completely silent all throughout his imprisonment and torture. He would not even admit his crimes - splitting the party, Anti-Russian activities, breaches of morality and decency - either under duress or on the stand. It's clear that he's guilty, of course, but he isn't playing into the show that Rodzaevsky had hoped he would put on. Regardless, the execution would go forward; it had to.\n\nThe central square of Zeya, once the market that had since been transformed into the town's gallows for all of the Vozhd's ideological enemies, had been packed with a number of Blackshirts and senior members of the RFP. Each one had been picked based on their relation to the party and Matkovsky himself - they had either known him directly, or had been affected by the fallout of his splitting of the party. Losing friends or family to the split and the subsequent purges on all sides resulted in dozens of members of the RFP being more than happy to attend the execution. As Matkovsky was brought up to the gallows, jeers and insults were hurled at him by the crowd, all of whom had been roused to believe that the man was responsible for their hardships. Once he was brought up, Rodzaevsky himself was waiting there to greet him. Looking him directly in the eye, the Vozhd asked him: "Any last words?" Silence followed, as Matkovsky stared back, awkward seconds passing by. Frustrated by his silence, Rodzaevsky threw a punch, landing on his captive's cheek. He spat a single word at Matkovsky: "Bastard." Turning to the executioner, he gave him the official command. Thus ended the split."

 amur.21.t: "All Alone"
 amur.21.desc: "It was late - how late? Rodzaevsky wasn't sure. All he knew was that his security minister, Bolotov, and a pair of Supreme Council members, had insisted on meeting with him to brief him on the status of the party's reception in Chita, the city newly-liberated from the monarchists. But his head wasn't in the right place to receive the sort of news they were offering. Eyes nominally looking at reports, but glazed over, the Vozhd politely listened to the group, before dismissing them once he was sure that they had finished. As they filed out of the room, Rodzaevsky turned his entire attention to what was on his mind - the past decade of his life. From a fiery preacher-esque figure in Harbin, to the warlord of a pseudo-statelet in the Amur region, and finally his triumph over his enemies and the reunification of the Russian Fascist Party.\n\nBut he remembered too, quite well, a time when his enemies were not enemies at all - in fact, he had even called some of them friends. The atmosphere of Harbin and the scarcity of resources in their struggle made cooperation between the Whites and the fascists, both pragmatic and fanatically ideological, absolutely necessary. There were always arguments, but there were both good times and bad. Sharing dinner and a vodka with Ataman Semyonov, for example, or drunkenly belting out White Army songs with Matkovsky from his balcony into the chilly, Manchurian night. Rodzaevsky remembered - if only for a brief minute - that his friends-turned-enemies were more than just targets: they were humans. After all the work that the Vozhd went through, all the painstaking measures to dehumanize his enemies, he couldn't shake the fact that they were, after all, people. People, with some of whom he had once shared real connections with. He sighed, and glanced at the report left on his desk by Bolotov. Humans, maybe, Rodzaevsky thought, but still traitors. The Vozhd, with a strong mental push, dismissed his thoughts and reminiscences and picked up the report. He read it - every word, in fact - and found it satisfying.\n\n"Look at how far we've come..." he muttered to himself. Reminiscing on the past quickly transitioned into preparing for the future. He dropped the report on his desk, stood and walked to the map of the Russian Far East he had put up on a wall in his office, pondering his next move."

He tapped his foot for a moment, trying to think of the right analogy.\n\n"Like... rats, sir?" Pavel suggested.\n\nDmitri nodded emphatically. "Right, Private, like rats. You catch one by himself, you can squish him no problem. Choke him out, stick him with your bayonet, blow his head off, whatever. But if there's five, or ten, or fifty? They'll just overrun you, kill you with lots of little bites. Probably torture you first, though."\n\nPavel went pale. The teenager's eyes dilated in the orange glow of the brazier. "T-t-torture me?"\n\n"Oh, yeah," said Dmitri as he lit up another cigarette and took a puff. He paused for a moment to recall. "There was this one time, not long after we came here from Harbin. We were still probing the frontier at the time, trying to figure out where to set up the border posts. Well, some NKVD boys from Irkutsk must have got wind of us coming. While I was taking a piss, they grabbed my pal, Semyon. Found him tied to a tree with his privates cut off and shoved in his mouth. I looked around, but they'd fucked off already."\n\n"Damn, sir," Pavel mumbled. "Are they all like that?"\n\n"Fuck yes, they are! That's why we gotta hit back as hard as they do.

Bartender, switch that radio on!"\n\nThe bartender, who had paled at the sight of a Blackshirt appearing in his establishment, hastened to flick the switch and turn the tuner to the correct frequency. After a brief delay, drawing a suspicious look from the Blackshirt, the Vozhd's voice began to fill the dark, dingy tavern.\n\n"...why we must strike them down regardless of blood ties! Remember that while the Jew poisons the blood, the Communist corrupts the soul! There is no redemption in this life for a Bolshevik, even if they are a friend or family member. The only thing you can do for their wretched souls is hasten their journey to Hell, where they might find some spiritual redemption. By allowing them to continue living amongst us, you only damn more of your own Russian brothers and sisters! Every Bolshevik spared will turn countless children to worship of the Red Judas, Lenin, and turn your wives and daughters into whores for the Jewish pigs! Remember this lesson, and do your duty to God and your race! Glory to Russia!"\n\nThe radio fell into crackling static for a moment before someone in a broadcast station flicked a switch and started up the usual patriotic music. "The Vozhd has spoken, citizens!" bellowed the Blackshirt. "Glory to Russia!" He threw a salute, glanced around to make sure everyone else had followed suit, and departed without a word more."

All around him, crisp as birdsong on a summer morning, he could hear the crack of gunshots, the screams of the dying and civilians pleading for the lives of their enlisted kin. Even behind the blindfold, Sablin squeezed his eyes shut and gritted his teeth as the pained voices of people he knew personally drifted to him on the frigid wind.\n\nThe noisome chaos of the village soon faded from earshot as the truck picked up speed and began navigating a rough back road. An hour or so passed before they finally came to a stop and Sablin was roughly manhandled out of the truck's flatbed. Half-dragged, half-stumbling, he found himself thrown bodily against a wall. Someone grabbed him by the collar and ripped the blindfold away. He saw that night had fallen, and his captor's flashlights dazzled him briefly. Shadows moved beyond the edge of the light - shadows with rifles at the ready. Glancing around, he noted the blood and bullet-holes marking the cottage wall he had been put against. His eyes tracked downwards to the source, and Sablin's heart plummeted.\n\nBraun. Pechuro. Ulanovskaya. His close friends and a dozen more, slumped against the whitewashed surface with blood pooled about them, riddled with holes. "No," he whispered, voice hollow. "Fascist monsters." Someone prodded him with a rifle barrel and shouted for him to move. "Fuck you!" Sablin spat. "You and your sick excuse for a state will be buried in history! We'll be avenged - all of us! Your Vozhd is going to be strung up and die screaming by the people's hand!"\n\nSomeone punched him, hard, between the eyes. Half a dozen rifles clacked as their bolts were pulled back.

Dragged through the streets on a rope leash, every stumble was met with more expletives and vicious blows from the posse of eager Blackshirts who had been selected to bring him to the gallows. The citizens, called forth from their homes for the occasion, joined in with glee and genuine enthusiasm, for Yagoda's name was one cursed throughout Russia like no other. Stones, rotten food and feces pelted the bald, gremlin-faced NKVD chief throughout his agonizing journey to the center of town.\n\nBy the time he was dragged up a narrow set of stairs to a wooden platform in the town square, Yagoda was barely conscious. Blood ran from a dozen small cuts on his scalp and face. His uniform was sullied with both his own filth and that which had been thrown at him. "He's not dead already, is he?" someone shouted angrily. "If you've fucked up, I'll hang you next to him!"\n\n"No, my Vozhd! You see?" someone slugged Yagoda in the face, eliciting a whimper. "He's still alive, but we'd better do him quick!"\n\n"No," sneered the first voice. Yagoda found himself hauled upright before a face he'd become familiar with during his investigations of the Harbin exiles, albeit aged and grizzled: Konstantin Rodzaevsky. "Make sure that noose isn't too tight, Bolotov," the Vozhd remarked as a noose was roughly pulled down around Yagoda's neck. "These people came for a show."\n\nSomething clunked, and the floor fell out from under Yagoda. He was dangling in the air, the noose pressing tight around his throat - but not tight enough. He gasped and coughed, struggling to draw in air as the world darkened around him. It took Genrikh Yagoda twenty minutes to die, and Rodzaevsky savoured every wretched, stomach-churning moment."

From atop the armored car he had arrived in, he surveyed the carnage wrought by his forces and smiled.\n\nShots continued to ring out at a steady pace, each one marking the end of another communist rat's existence. The red banners that had once adorned the makeshift Kremlin were being torn down, shredded, pissed on, burned and otherwise desecrated in whatever way the Blackshirts saw fit. A thunderous boom rolled across the city as someone set off explosive charges and blew the great statue of Lenin to bits. Similar iconoclasm was being carried out all through the residential areas as portraits of the Bolshevik leaders were piled up and put to the torch in the streets.\n\nHe had seen this in his dreams. The end. A glorious inferno of vengeance and hate, scouring the world clean of the Judeo-Bolshevik abomination that had usurped Holy Russia. Just as the great Hitler had done in the west, Rodzaevsky had done in the east. He had been jeered at, mocked, persecuted for his faith in National Socialism during those years in Harbin. Matkovsky had abandoned him, the Whites had split off to follow their false Tsar, and the Reds had never ceased to plague him.\n\nNow there was only silence, save for the crackle of gunfire and the roar of the flames.\n\nAnd Rodzaevsky, Vozhd of the Russians, laughing to an ashen sky."

He continued to quietly pray through bloodied lips, pacing along as calmly as a monk going about his cloistered life.\n\nOnly at the far fringes of the crowd were voices heard; voices that whispered of the northern priest who had taken on a reputation that far eclipsed his humble form. Some spoke of his plain appearance, others of his supposed sorcerous powers. All were tinged by fear of what might come as a consequence of his demise.\n\nEven the Patriarch, avowed follower of the Church and the Vozhd, conducted the last rites with trembling hands. The Blackshirts standing alongside the condemned glanced around nervously and tapped their feet, wishing only for the sense of discomfort - of wrongness - to end. Men's quiet prayers wormed their way into the ears of those around him. There was no acknowledgement of the noose being fastened around his neck.\n\nThe lever clunked. Men's body dropped, ending his prayers instantly with a near-inaudible crunch. Bolotov, who had specifically tied the noose to strangle the priest to death instead, turned white as snow as he realised what had happened.\n\nThey all knew the truth in the depths of their souls. A terrible thing had been done, but none would ever speak of it again. The citizens present that day would forever live in silent fear of the judgement that now surely awaited them."

Finally, all is as it should be in our reborn Russia.\n\nThere remains much to do before we turn our gaze westward and begin the liberation of all Russia. With our immediate threats disposed of and the RFP secured, the Vozhd now has the opportunity to carry out his planned reorganization of the nation. We still want for many things necessary for victory: proper industry, modern agriculture and large-scale armaments production, just to name a few.\n\nBut no minor setbacks can stop us from fulfilling our destiny. We have risen from our Siberian backwater to claim the entirety of the Far East. Our enemies lie broken, burned and buried. Every foe we faced has been shattered by the iron fist of National Socialism - the same will be true for any other Jewish puppet who dares stand before us.\n\nThe skies darken - not with the gloom of defeat and destruction, but under the shadow of our glory, invigorated by God and given form in the Vozhd, saviour of Russia."

Rodzaevsky shivered and drew the heavy greatcoat closer around his shoulders, closing the fur lining around his neck to try and keep the warmth in. Only his face and hands were exposed to the chilly air of his makeshift headquarters, intense eyes tracing across the page before him as his numb fingers scrawled out a new addition to his manifesto of Russian National Socialism. The ancient clock on the wall chimed a single peal, signifying that 1 o'clock in the morning had come, as he reached the bottom of the page and downed his pen.\n\nIt was the third night in a row that Rodzaevsky had stayed up late to continue work on his magnum opus. He had thought it complete long ago, but the sudden collapse of Red authority and the mockery of Russia it maintained had changed the situation. Without the aid of the Japanese, he had gone from Harbin to distant Zeya on the river Amur in just a few short days. In that short period of time just a few years prior, the fortunes of the Russian Fascist Party had changed completely.\n\nThat hadn't lasted long, of course. The thought of Matkovsky's betrayal and the split of the RFP stoked the fire of hate in the Vozhd's gut, and he reached for the flask of vodka beside him to quench it. The taste, vile and stomach-churning as the betrayal, did little to soothe his temper, but he ignored it and took another deep swig - it would do its job eventually. In that, it was just like the assorted rabble that his statelet called an army. Crude, ill-formed, hammered out of whatever was lying around to make something functional. But it was his - it was Russia's. For only here was Russia to be found. Beyond Amur's borders, there lay only traitors, subhumans, and Reds, their collective boot on the throat of the Russian people.\n\nSomeday, he would have his chance.

In his capacity as 'Vozhd of the Russians', he demands in rather bipolar language the return of Blagoveshchensk, a region in the far north of Manchukuo which contains his hometown of the same name. The region is not particularly impressive in terms of its mineral wealth, and it is full of ethnic Russians whom we have no reason to displace.\n\nThe Manchurians expressed their profound indifference to the matter when it was brought to their government, so there's no need to bother getting them to rubber-stamp it. All other authorities concerned have made clear that they don't care about a frozen stub of land full of Russians, and Rodzaevsky is offering us rights to the resources in far-eastern Siberia once he secures the region. Though unlikely to happen, it would allow for some interesting investment opportunities should he succeed, so there's nothing to lose from ceding the lands in question. We may as well just send the request up the pipeline to the Diet and see what comes of it. We should hear back in a month or so."

This morning, a one-man Japanese delegation arrived by plane to formally hand over the territory, with the Vozhd putting his signature to the agreement in his Zeya headquarters.\n\nIn return for ceding Blagoveshchensk, we have granted the Japanese special rights to some of the natural resources in far-eastern Siberia. Once we secure those resources and unite the region under a stable government, the resultant trade and mining deals will no doubt prove extremely fruitful for our reborn Russian state!\n\nFor now, the Vozhd has publicly confirmed that he will travel to his hometown post-haste for a grand celebration now that it is officially back in Russian hands.

There, the mayor granted the Vozhd the keys to the city and led the crowd in a rousing rendition of 'Farewell of Slavianka'.\n\nThe Vozhd was visibly overjoyed to be back in his hometown, tears freezing on his cheeks as he addressed the enthralled crowd and the armed Blackshirts keeping guard.

He muttered to himself, as he swung his legs onto the chilly, wooden floor and sat up. He recalled that his briefings were expected by the Vozhd this morning.\n\nSlipping on his clothes, trimming his beard, and preparing for his day, Bolotov only had one thing in mind. As he finished his modest breakfast, consumed out of habit not hunger, he went back to his bedroom, and from under a false bottom in his dresser, he pulled out an ornate wooden box. Once open, Bolotov stared at the non-descript syrettes with a lustful stare: morphine. He carefully rolled up his sleeve after sitting on his bed and selected a syrette. Unsheathing its needle, he picked up the phone he kept on his nightstand and dialled Vladimir Golubtsov, one of his many scions. As the line rang through, Bolotov jammed the syrette into his arm. Almost immediately, his headache began to recede, and his muddled "brain fog" began to clear. Sighing blissfully, his moment of tranquility was interrupted by Golubtsov's gruff voice on the other end.\n\nAfter cursory greetings, Bolotov asked about his "informants". "We're still working on them pretty hard, boss" Golubtsov reported. "But don't worry, we'll get them talking." Bolotov, satisfied, reminded him that he needed the documents implicating another half-dozen party members at his office before he got there, and Golubtsov assured him that they were already there. After a sinister "don't make me come looking", he placed the phone back on the receiver, unrolled his sleeve, and went to leave.

Sitting at his desk, he pulled out two small, leather-bound books, one black, one brown. Opening the cracked spine of the black book, he looked at his appointments for the day to be sure that he wouldn't miss any. As he looked well into the afternoon, he grimaced. A conference with security minister Alexander Bolotov and the Vozhd himself. The Vozhd, he could handle, despite his leader's seemingly ever-increasing paranoia. It was Bolotov that he couldn't stomach.\n\nWith their lunge into Russia proper following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the RFP had a shot at forming a legitimate state, to abandon the thuggery and mafia-like tactics which had defined their stay in the city of Harbin. It wasn't the violence Shekherev disliked - it was the seemingly-mindless character that was associated with Bolotov's unique brand, as if he and those in his employ were rabid dogs. Bolotov, apparently, had no intention to ever depart from his ways, despite Shekherev's continued urgings. If Shekherev wasn't integral - and a good friend of the Vozhd - he was sure that he would have been shot by the morphine addict long ago.\n\nClosing the black book and opening the brown, he looked through his journal, meticulously-kept ever since the early days of his involvement with the party. He remembered his failed career as a teacher and a tinge of yearning for the days of Harbin. Looking at the faded pages, the leader of the Blackshirts resolved that he would serve, faithfully, in his post - both officially in the Blackshirts and unofficially as a force for civilising the party he loved."

It was Spasovsky's job to make sure they remained friendly to Rodzaevsky's aims, which usually meant agreeing with everything they said and signing where they wanted him to sign. None of them were really in a position to bargain with Japan, after all.\n\nSpasovsky thought back to his youth, when everything had seemed hopeful for the cause, when the Black Hundreds had been strong and he had been a member. Now their vision for Russia seemed like a distant dream, with Jews and Communists running loose all over Russia and spreading their filth. He hated all of them for that, without question. However, he was now not only old, but incredibly tired. There wasn't enough energy left in him to really care what happened, especially since he had a feeling that he wouldn't live to enjoy it.\n\nDeciding that he needed to focus just a little more, he put out the cigarette and picked up his pen, returning to his endless work on the foreign affairs of the RFP.

Screams rang out in the dimly lit facility, which Okhotin was touring as part of his official duties, but for a place like this you learned to make the cries for help into background noise. All of Amur had. Just once, he glanced into a chamber, and saw a broken man pleading in a hoarse voice for help; without a second thought, Okhotin turned away and left him to his fate. Whatever the man had been through, he undoubtedly deserved it. After all, the Vozhd willed it.\n\nOkhotin knew there was a great moral good to aiding Rodzaevsky's cause in spite of the seemingly gruesome nature of it, such as crushing the Bolsheviks that had driven them all out of their homes and the Jews that had guided that disastrous revolution. In any case, he knew that Rodzaevsky was doing the right thing, because he placed trust in his Vozhd just as he trusted him. That was the foundation of their friendship, a bond forged through a mutual hatred of the subhumans during the days in Harbin, and strong enough to resist any attempt by lesser men to poison it.\n\nAlthough, Okhotin thought as yet another pained scream filled the air, that last part might not be true anymore. With what Bolotov was capable of and willing to do, he feared the day his own name would be included among those the torturer whispered to Rodzaevsky, feeding the paranoia of the Vozhd that Okhotin believed in even now."

So much had changed since he left the city with his family in 1920: there were a number of apartments and unfamiliar buildings where once only houses stood. The roads were much better paved than he remembered, too. But some buildings, mainly landmarks like the museum and church remained the same.\n\nOkhotin tried to recognize any familiar faces in the throngs who walked among the streets. He turned his gaze to an old woman. That mark on her cheek, that could only have been Mrs. Yakhantova, who ran the store down the street from his house, and gave him and his friends candy for free. Okhotin was going to say something when Yakhantova realised he was looking at her. Turning white with fear, she hid her face and scurried away.\n\nAs Okhotin tried to pick up individual people in the crowd, more and more of them did the same: covering their faces in fear, trying not to catch his attention. He tried to call out to a man with sandy blonde hair that Okhotin recognised as his schoolmate Dmitry Lebedinsky.\n\n"Dimasha!"\n\n"How...? Please, I didn't do anything!" Dmitry cried out.\n\n"I..." Okhotin didn't know what to say as Dmitry fled. He felt like an idiot who said the wrong word to some passerby. Was he not? He thought as his heart sank with solitude, no longer the second most powerful man in the Far East, but just another man isolated on a crowded street."

 amur.38.desc: "The car containing the elderly Mikhail Spasovsky trundled along the streets of the city, its one passenger heading home from the Vozhd's residence. The foreign minister for the All-Russian Government of the Far East was visibly sweating, and raised a trembling hand to his forehead, dabbing it gently with a tissue as he recalled his most recent experience with the RFP's supreme leader.\n\nThe Vozhd had sent a letter to the Nazi government in Berlin, requesting recognition and wishing them well, explaining to them the success of the Russian Fascist Party in the Far East. He had expected a reply from the Germans, an indication of their willingness to cooperate, their congratulations, or even a placid diplomatic response that promised nothing. But that's exactly what had come: nothing. As days turned to weeks, and weeks into a month, Rodzaevsky lost his patience. Calling Spasovsky into his office, he demanded to know why the Germans had taken so long to respond. When the foreign minister replied that he had not an inkling, and that there still hadn't been a response, the fragile temper of the Vozhd exploded on the septuagenarian, as he proceeded to throw things at Spasovsky and scream about the injustices that had been visited upon himself.\n\nAs Spasovsky's car neared his residence, the elderly statesman tried to remind himself that the response was alcohol-soaked and will be forgotten by the next day, but the sweating only intensified as a dizziness overtook him. "I need to lie down", Spasovsky said to no one in particular. As his car pulled up to his house, his door was opened, but he had a hard time getting out. The dizziness seemed to have infested not just his mind, but his body as well. His driver tried to help him regain balance, but Spasovsky pushed him away. An intense tightness in his chest gripped him, and midway up the stairs to his house, Mikhail Mikhailovich Spasovsky suffered a heart attack and died."

 amur.39.t: "Tribute to the Ideologue"
 amur.39.desc: "The chilly morning in Rodzaevsk betrayed itself through the breath vapor released by all of the attendees of Mikhail Spasovsky's funeral. The funeral itself had been quite small, and included whatever Spasovsky had in the way of family, and key members of the Russian Fascist Party, including Rodzaevsky, Bolotov, and Shekherev. However, the subsequent RFP-sponsored march and public rally celebrating Spasovsky's life had been far from small. With citizens trained in from other places, and rural peasants brought in by the Blackshirts, the Vozhd of the All-Russian Government of the Far East took his place on a balcony overlooking thousands of his apparent devotees. Beginning to speak, he talked in a somber tone about Mikhail Spasovsky, apparently a good friend and one of the chief ideologues of the early Russian Fascist Party. "...Mikhail Spasovsky was more than just a party member. He was an inspiration, an anchor in a wanton storm. Throughout the early years of the party, he guided me and many others towards the light of true National Socialism. His wise and sage advice, earned - not bought - through his many years of service to the fight against the Jews and the Communists, enlightened many members of our party, guiding all of us, even to his last day." The Vozhd paused and swallowed, before continuing.\n\n"This man, the grey eminence of the Russian Fascist Party, the eldest of our wise, had always found himself dedicated to the fight against the Judeo-Bolshevik curse which has afflicted not just our nation, but the world at large. This dedication came from an early age: Mikhail had participated in the Black Hundreds, and when he came to us in Harbin, he readily volunteered to us his experience and inspired us to intensify and bring into focus our fight against those who plague Russia. His loss, a result of his resolute enthusiasm and continued commitment to his work despite his age, is one that resounds with all true members of our party. Today is a day of mourning, as we remember one of the men behind our movement.""

And also cleaning the blood of those inmates shot for not working hard enough or shot for passing out from exhaustion.\n\nEven if the Vozhd knew about that, he would hardly care. This is a glorious moment for the restoration of Mother Russia. Looking at the former Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya, now the Vozhd Konstantin Rodzaevsky, is like looking at the future of Russia that the Vozhd intends.\n\nWhat was once the Gangut of the Tsar, before decades of Judeo-Bolshevik corruption, will now serve the true Russia once more. There is only one thing left to do.\n\nRodzaevsky finishes his thundering speech, takes a cursory glance at the assorted smaller ships that had been equally refurbished and takes the bottle placed next to him. In a more civilised age, that bottle would have contained champagne, but for now local vodka will have to do.\n\nOne hefty swing and the bottle speeds toward the battleship's rump, hits it with a deep clong and then... doesn't break. An awkward silence follows. The Vozhd stares at the still intact bottle flailing intact near the hull. Then with barely contained anger draws his sidearm and shoots the bottle, so that at last vodka splashes his flagship.\n\nFor the rest of the ceremony, the rest of the guests make sure to be extra deferential.

It couldn't have been any better in his imagination. Last but not least were the inhabitants. Dirty, half-naked and emaciated with hollow eyes, they dared not look up at the Vozhd as he passed them by.\n\n"How's productivity?" he nonchalantly asked Steklov, who had averted his eyes from the slaves and held a handkerchief over his mouth. "The mining camps out in Yakutia have doubled their output in the past month."\n\nSteklov swallowed his bile before responding in a slightly quavering voice. How the Vozhd and the guards could simply ignore the stench of the open grave beside the factory was beyond him. "Ah, well, I'm happy to report that this facility is meeting the set quota, my Vozhd." He swallowed again before continuing. "I'm not sure if these people are capable of-"\n\n"These aren't people, Steklov," Rodzaevsky muttered, turning to his subordinate and finally noticing the man's pale, sickly face. "What, this bothers you?" He snorted before resuming his leisurely pace back towards the gates. "Get over it already. You don't see me fainting like a little girl whenever Mura swats a bug."\n\n"I'm fine, my Vozhd," Steklov lied. "Just a little under the weather today. It is as you say, of course."

 amur.43.desc: "Despite its proximity to the Japanese border, the city of Rodzaevsk had been considered the economic capital of Rodzaevsky's Far East for quite some time. Here, a number of prominent industrialists had met to discuss the future models of how they would run their massive conglomerates. A number of very prominent figures were there - all of them members of the RFP, having grown fat off of war profiteering during the first stage of the reunification.\n\nThese industrialists, while none of them prominent party officials, had been chosen to head the first of the Russian megacorporations that Rodzaevsky had envisioned - their ideological dedication to the cause, longtime membership in the party, or "donating" enough money all "qualified" them for the positions. As they convened to discuss the future of their megacorporations, they sat down in the conference room that would determine the economic future of Rodzaevsky's Russia.\n\nAfter some intense deliberation, an incredibly controversial idea was floated among the industrialists: the repurposing of forced labor for the purposes of vast and rapid economic growth by the megacorporations that the Vozhd had envisioned. Surely, not the most humane idea and one that emulated the German model of forced labor in their industrial sector, many of the industrialists took an initial distaste for the idea. However, as it was discussed more and more, almost all realized the benefits of what was being proposed: labor and manpower that was virtually free. While it would surely decrease the quality and quantity of the goods produced, it would also mean a net profit for those tasked with creating exactly that.\n\nAs the industrialists and their attendants indulged in coffee and luxurious, exotic foods imported from Japan, they barely thought of the thousands of lives they would resign to horrific conditions in the factories that they believed would ensure the Vozhd's victory."

He looked towards his chauffeur, before checking his watch. 08:15 - the Vozhd was late. This was far from surprising, knowing the proclivities of the Supreme Leader, but Vinogradov couldn't help but worry that the "meeting" he had been forced to schedule was little more than an opportunity to purge the nascent industrialist. However, as the Vozhd's all-black car came into sight, Vinogradov felt a sense of relief.\n\nAs the Vozhd stood from his car, Vinogradov moved to meet him. The pair of men met with a handshake: "Soratnik, it's good to see you" Rodzaevsky said to Vinogradov.\n\n"And you, my Vozhd." Vinogradov responded. Gesturing towards the brick-and-mortar factory behind him, belching black smoke upwards, he continued, "Shall we?"\n\nThe pair toured the facility, with Vinogradov giving the Vozhd the in-and-outs of how the factory worked. He had, truthfully, been worried about the Vozhd's reaction to the condition of the workers - the factory had them working virtually around the clock, with little to nothing in the way of breaks or food. The workers looked withered and sad; it was hard to tell which were slaves and which weren't, but Vinogradov aptly pointed out that slaves were given only the most dangerous jobs. The Vozhd took everything in, almost always silent, posing the occasional question. As the pair once again exited the factory, he stretched out his hand for a handshake. As Vinogradov took it, the Vozhd gripped his hand tightly. "Very good work, Vinogradov, very good.""

As our movement sweeps westward our party numbers surge, as all true Russians seek to serve the Vozhd. The splitters couldn't stop us, the communists couldn't stop us, and the Jews won't stop us. The Russian people hunger for fascism: not as the Nazis delivered upon us, with fire, steel and blood, but a fascism for the people, not against them. And I intend to bring to them just that: a system of harmonious class collaboration, where all Russians work together for the betterment of their nation and their race!\n\nRemember now, and remember always, my people: For God, Nation, and Labor!"\n\nToday, the Vozhd once again took to the balcony, the same one that he had used to announce the conquest of the splitters and Tsarists, delivering a fiery, rousing speech to his people, both assembled below and across the radio waves. He promised the people the beginning of a new era of economic prosperity and the creation of what he calls "class collaboration". Closely modelled on the Nazi economic system that Adolf Hitler had created and nurtured decades before, Rodzaevsky has promised to expand megacorporations and promote the cooperation of the lower, middle, and upper classes.\n\nWhile some international observers have had markedly negative reactions to the Vozhd's promises, comparing them to the beginnings of what would end up as the bloated corpse of the German economy. It seems that everyone within the All-Russian Government of the Far East is more than happy to go along with the Vozhd's plans, with those who were once willing to speak out either having been purged long ago or simply too afraid to publicly say otherwise."

Others were simply content to have security and income, even if the hours were demanding and the conditions harsh.\n\nThe Free Union of Far Eastern Workers, illegally formed by eighty arms factory workers in the wake of their comrade being shot for failing to meet quota, was not numbered among them.\n\nThey marched through Zeya's streets, the morning sun rising before them. Some citizens leaned out of windows to cheer them on in defiance of the regime. A few, finding their courage, rallied to the red bedsheet held aloft on a stick that served as their banner. When the crowd arrived at the town hall, now bathed in the warmth of the sun, it had swollen to over two hundred individuals.\n\nBuoyed aloft by group euphoria, chanting and singing for the liberation of workers against all odds, they didn't see the armed Blackshirts stalking them through alleyways. They didn't hear the distinctive clack of Maxim guns being charged in windows all around them. What they did notice, as the street suddenly began to fill with the dead and dying, was the sudden heat and pain of a leaden storm tearing into the strikers and snuffing out their hope like a fading candle."

Konstantin Rodzaevsky was anything but a lethargic man. Following his short dinner and copious amounts of liquor that came with it, he had secluded himself in his office, locking the door and drawing the curtains.\n\nStarting well into the evening and writing well into the crack of dawn, the Vozhd of all Russians sat at his desk, drinking and writing madly, a man in the throes of passion and inspiration. He was drafting another of his so-called "magnum opuses", this one on what he viewed was the perfect and ideal Russian society, a new society - and one that he will impose on Russia for the good of her people. As his office's housekeeper came to serve him breakfast in the early hours of the morning, the Vozhd, whose night had been fueled by a combination of liquor and caffeinated beverages, was finishing up his work.\n\nDelving into a hearty breakfast to temper the liquor and his oncoming hangover, Konstantin Rodzaevsky looked over his work. It was forty eight pages, single-spaced, and dealt with every single possible detail in his envisioned society. From the intensive use and integration of state-sponsored organizations like the Union of Fascist Little Ones and the Russian Women's Fascist Movement to the in-depth outlining of the way in which households functioning - with the man at the head of the house, of course - and the general militarization of society, every aspect of what he believed to be the perfect society was tackled.

Anatoly, the big Blackshirt there to protect them with his Japanese machine-gun, wasn't friendly at all. Fyodor didn't really get why they needed protecting in the first place. All the Jews in his town had been taken away and the fighting with the Reds was over, so why did Anatoly have to be there? All he did was bully them.\n\nAt night, they slept on thin mattresses with little more than rags to cover them. Even then, in the pitch-dark of their barracks, someone else watched them. Sometimes, the door would creak open so that someone could shine a flashlight across the room and make sure none of them were huddled together for warmth. Such behaviour bred degeneracy and femininity, their leader said.\n\nEvery morning came the overseer, rousing them before dawn with the clamour of a brass bell. The racket always signalled the same thing: another fourteen hours of splinters, bleeding fingers, broken toes and the harsh blows of the overseer's truncheon. The Vozhd was right, thought Fyodor; the path of righteous labor was full of hardships. Kolya and Sasha had 'washed out' already. Some of the others whispered about how the pair had tried to escape and were caught, but Fyodor knew the truth. They had failed their race, just like his cousin Tyoma. They weren't real Russians."

Devoid of any morality, love or faith, she ends her life as a ruined, dishonored and drug-addicted Jezebel. Such is how the Jews would have you, as well! To embrace Western feminism is to cast off all that makes a woman pure and godly.\n\nIn Russia, we understand that God has a place for us all.

No corner or alleyway is free of the eyes and ears of loyal party members, on the lookout for traitors to hand up the chain of command. And the most attentive of them are within the Party Congress. Dozens of supposedly loyal party members have been exposed as Zionist sympathizers in the past days, at the behest of the true loyalists.

The Blackshirts have served our purposes well, but they are lacking in organization and equipment. I suggest we create a newer, more specialized unit, with proper military training and advanced education on how to spot enemies of the state. The best, most loyal men we can find, on the model of the German paramilitaries."\n\nThe Vozhd contemplated this idea momentarily, then issued his judgement."
 amur.56.a: ""A strong proposal, Soratnik. Do it.""
 amur.56.b: ""The Blackshirts serve us perfectly well. Do not speak of this again.""

 amur.57.t: "Securing the State"
 amur.57.desc: ""You have all been selected as the most loyal examples of what an ideal Russian should be. The Vozhd has personally approved the creation of our new Security Assurance Squads to destroy the influence of Zionist traitors in our country. You will build this organization for us, and the Vozhd will supply you with what you need. I expect lists to be formed of good, reliable soldiers. You are responsible for their training and obedience."\n\nBolotov smiled as he addressed the first officers of the Otryady Obespecheniya Bezopasnosti. Under the nose of Shekherev, he had triumphed and received permission for his own power base. But there were still many obstacles. He would need weapons, uniforms, a network of bureaucracy to manage the lists, and many more resources.\n\nStill, his star was certainly rising. The trust of the Vozhd was rare, and it was common for it to ebb and flow on Rozaevsky's whim. This momentary success would surely not last, but Bolotov had clawed his way further up in status- and now possessed a knife which he could use to give the Vozhd's enemies what they deserved."
 amur.57.a: "We shall root out every traitor!"

 amur.58.t: "Bitter Disappointment"
 amur.58.desc: "The past two days were best left forgotten. After the Vozhd's refusal to create the OOB, Bolotv had been in an inconsolable rage, spending several hours locked in a room with a prisoner and a crowbar before he was calmed. Shekherev had been pouring poison into the Vozhd's ear, and now he had deserted his most loyal servant, casting him out onto the whims of Shekherev. Well, he would pay on the day the loyalty of the Blackshirts failed!\n\nNo, this would not do. It was not fitting for a Russian to behave in such a manner. The Vozhd would see reason, for if he did not, what hope was there for Russia? Rodzaevsky was the future, and he needed guidance- guidance that could not be provided by Shekherev. This thought comforted him, for the will of the Vozhd was strange but not entirely unpredictable.\n\nBolotov smiled. Another set of lists at the right time, and the Vozhd would see reason. He could not dare ask about the OOB again, but the paranoia of Rodzaevsky always manifested, and guaranteed a chance to bring himself back to his side and outmaneuver the Blackshirts, all by himself. It was time to return to work. He withdrew a stack of reports from his desk and began writing."
 amur.58.a: "Four more Soratniks suspected of Jewish ancestry. The Vozhd will be displeased."

 amur.59.t: "A New Day"
 amur.59.desc: "When Konstantin Rodzaevsky awoke, the first thing he felt was the familiar throbbing pain in his head. It was particularly bad this morning, and as usual Rodzaevsky could not recall exactly how he had spent the previous night. With a sluggish pace he opened his eyes and gave a half-hearted glance at the alarm clock on his nightstand. Rodzaevsky's sight was blurred, and he could not make out the time at first. After a moment, his eyes finally adjusted and revealed the hour: half past two in the afternoon.\n\nHis head still aching and his body still sapped of energy, Rodzaevsky clumsily rolled out of his bed and landed on the floor with a loud thud. He hacked out a few pained coughs and mumbled an obscenity, but was still too groggy to be fazed by the slight pain the fall gave him. When everything already hurts, what was a little more going to do? Pulling himself together, Rodzaevsky rose to his feet and opened the blinds to his window revealing the near-perpetually frozen city of Zeya. Light flooded into the poorly-lit room, and the sudden burst of sunlight caused Rodzaevsky to flinch. The vast view his third-story room had given him quickly reminded the Fascist leader of his recent accomplishments.\n\nThis land, from Lake Baikal in the West to Kamchatka in the East, was his and his alone. All of Rodzaevsky's enemies were either dead or wishing they were, and his dreaded armies had their boots firmly on the neck of the Russian Far East. This thought gave Rodzaevsky a great deal of comfort. Looking out into the distance, Rodzaevsky began to feel excitement for the future that he had not felt in some time. If these victories were to continue, he thought, all of Russia would be at his mercy, along with all of the "undesirables" hiding therein..."
 amur.59.a: "A great darkness arises in the East."

 amur.60.t: "Dear Germany..."
 amur.60.desc: ""To the Foreign Minister of the mighty Greater Germanic Reich...\n\nSalutations! As the leader of the esteemed Russian Fascist Party, it is my great pleasure to bring wonderful news from the Far East. Our armies have triumphed over the decadent Judeo-Bolshevik dogs who once soiled this land with their disgusting presence, bringing victory to the National Socialist cause and undoubtedly redeeming Russia in the eyes of the world.\n\nWith our presence here secured, I now extend my hand to you and your mighty nation in friendship and solidarity. As we are both nations who closely follow the tenets of the late, great Adolf Hitler, it would make a great deal of sense to reach common ground in diplomatic terms, no? Regrettably, our state still struggles to attain recognition amongst the nations of the world. No doubt this is the work of powerful Jewish elites who would like nothing more than to see our movement ground into dust before it can truly challenge their reign of terror over the world.\n\nGermany, however, is different. Your mighty people have rejected the Jew and their insidious plans for global domination, and it is because of this that I reach out to this great nation for recognition as the true heir to Russia's legacy, a legacy untarnished by the darkness of Judeo-Bolshevism. Although it is indeed true that our two peoples have not seen eye-to-eye in the past, perhaps we could use this opportunity to begin a new chapter for Russo-German relations, dutifully united as ideological brethren. I shall await your response with great enthusiasm!\n\nYours,\n\nKonstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky, Vozhd of Holy Russia""
 amur.60.a: "Perfect! Now to await their response..."

 amur.61.t: "A Strange Letter"
 amur.61.desc: "The minister's eyes scanned the strange letter's words a third time, completely incredulous as to what he was reading. Earlier that day, the Reich's Foreign Ministry had received a letter that would generously be described as the deranged ravings of a lunatic, and it had left all who had read it baffled beyond belief. The Foreign Minister himself found it tempting to read for himself, just to see what all the fuss was about. Now that he had read it a few times, he wasn't quite sure what to think.\n\nFrom top to bottom, the letter made little sense and seemed as though it was written by an incredibly disturbed individual. Claiming to be from the "Vozhd of Holy Russia", the letter explains that a certain region in Russia had been reconquered in the name of the "National Socialist cause". As the mad writings continue, this "Vozhd" states his intentions to seek recognition from the Reich, for he is of the belief that all-powerful international Jews conspire against his new state and seek to smother it in the crib. As he believes that German people have "rejected the Jew", the "Vozhd" considers the Reich to be his best bet at attaining international recognition.\n\nAfter some time, the minister came to the conclusion that the letter was some kind of poor attempt at a hoax. Throwing the crumpled letter into the bin by his desk, the Foreign Minister took this turn of events as a sign that perhaps the time had come for some new vetting protocols. The thinly-stretched Ministry's time was important, and wasting it on aspiring comedians sending them nonsense letters was simply not something they could afford."
 amur.61.a: "Do they really have nothing better to do?"

 amur.62.t: "Silence from the Reich"
 amur.62.desc: "The office of the Vozhd often had its furniture changed and moved around, seemingly erratically, by the order of Rodzaevsky himself, who often experimented with the best ways to lay out his desk, drinking chairs, and artwork. Presently, the desk sat in the middle of the room closer to the back window which looked out into [AMR.Capital.GetName]. Across the entire room, tucked away in one of the corners was a trio of drinking chairs and a small table in between them. While Rodzaevsky sat behind his desk, his foreign minister, Spasovsky, sat in the chair facing the Vozhd, quietly observing the temperamental dictator.\n\n"How many days has it been?" Rodzaevsky asked.\n\n"Seven, sir." Spasovsky replied, pausing before he spoke, the words only reluctantly leaving his mouth. Two or three seconds of silence passed as Rodzaevsky's temper grew and grew until it boiled over. He picked up his glass of vodka and threw it across the room, sailing at incredible speed until it impacted upon the wall just over the aging Spasovsky's head. The foreign minister winced as particles of glass and vodka sprinkled over his head.\n\n"SEVEN FUCKING DAYS?!" roared Rodzaevsky. "ALL OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE, FOR NOTHING?! HOW FUCKING DARE THEY!"\n\nSpasovsky was used to the Vozhd's volatile temper. He knew how to weather the storm: silence. His mouth formed into a curt scowl as he watched his master rage about. "I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HITLER'S FUCKING HENCHMEN," Rodzaevsky continued, "THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THEIR ROOTS..." Rodzaevsky paused for a second, catching his breath, before continuing. "... AND THEY WILL REGRET THEIR IGNORANCE OF OUR CAUSE!"\n\nThe tantrum would pass, and Spasovsky would be dismissed. As he went home, grateful that the Vozhd's rage was limited to his office, and not himself, he reflected on the cause of the outburst: silence from Germany following Rodzaevsky's outreach of friendship. Once home, he sighed, and reminded himself that he needed to find someone else to bring bad news to the Vozhd."
 amur.62.a: "The Germans have betrayed us."

 amur.63.t: "A Letter to Congress"

Do you really think you're accomplishing anything, gathering in your so-called Capitol Building like fat pigs to a feeding trough? Perhaps it would be more forgiving if you weren't feeding on the hopes and dreams of thousands of suffering Americans. If only they knew how many of their problems are caused by the all-powerful elites who claim to 'represent' them on one hand while pillaging their wealth and destroying their racial identity on the other.\n\nThe only thing I find worse than your blatant greed and suspiciously Jewish ways, is the decadent and broken system your 'congress' represents. Democracy? What a joke! I'm going to take this opportunity to call it like it is: a farce! You allow your people to vote, but you and I both know that this is all just smoke and mirrors. The powerful Jews who subtly pull the strings of your country are the ones who decide the next fool to lead America to its inevitable ruin, not the people. It's quite clear that America is a nation of blind sheep led by Jewish wolves.\n\nAmerica is destined to fail, and this is a fact. You allow women to hold powerful political offices, and yet you still claim that America is the greatest nation on earth? Such is the way of the Jew: once the Zionists get their way, inferiors will attempt to run roughshod over everyone else. The day will soon come, and I am sure it won't be long, when the American people will realize just how misled they really are and take matters into their own hands...\n\nRot in hell,\n\nKonstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky, Vozhd of Holy Russia""

 amur.64.desc: ""To the sneaky Jew who now claims to be President of the United States: Mr. Goldwater...\n\nHow appropriate that the largest engine in the global Masonic-Zionist machine now finds itself being controlled by one of the most corrupt and black-hearted Judeans of them all! With your victory in the election all but secure, no doubt this means the schemes of the Zionist elite in America have finally come to fruition. Do not think I am not wise to your tricks, Mr. Goldwater! You may have deceived the naive people of America, but the people of Russia are a whole different breed. They will not fall for your insidious lies so easily, and neither shall I.\n\nThe American people may think that you have been chosen by their mandate, but I know better: you and the rest of your malevolent co-conspirators carefully manipulated the corrupt institutions of the United States to ensure total Zionist domination over the entire country and its people! You Jews are all the same. You think of yourselves as untouchable, while the rest of us are nothing more than pawns in your sinister games. How very typical of a race with so many inherent racial inferiorities, to try and make themselves feel better by cruelly trampling on everyone else!\n\nYou are playing a dangerous game, Mr. Goldwater. Soon the American people will realize just how cruel living under Jewish oppression can be, and will be forced to take action. When that day comes, Mr. Goldwater, you can rest assured that I and the rest of Russia would gladly join them in their righteous crusade to overthrow your illegitimate Zionist regime! Count your days, Jew, for the world is already starting to learn how to stand up and defend themselves against you and your ilk.\n\nWith unimaginable contempt,\n\nKonstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky, Vozhd of Holy Russia""

 amur.65.t: "The Campaign Trail"
 amur.65.desc: ""Fellow Russians! Inheritors of the land divinely bestowed upon us by God Himself! There are those among us who only concern themselves with the goings-on of the nation, who care little about what happens beyond our borders. Commendable as devotion to Russia and Russia alone may be, it is the wise man who looks beyond his country to take into account the state of the world. This, in truth, is how one develops a sharp eye for detecting the many plots and schemes by the global Zionist elite to deny Russia its glorious destiny!\n\nAcross the ocean lies the decadent land of America, long corrupted by the influence of wealthy Jews who have shaped a once-prosperous nation into their greatest weapon for inflicting misery across the globe. Despite how gloomy this situation may sound, what if I told you, my loyal brothers and sisters, that there was hope for the United States? Indeed, it is true! There is but one man who holds the key to liberating the American people from their subhuman oppressors, and his name is Francis Parker Yockey.\n\nI encourage all Russians, no matter where you are, to give their support to this valiant man should it be within your ability to do so. With your help, we can continue to spread the Fascist cause to every corner of the globe, and eventually uproot the eternal Jew from his dark seat of power!" The Vozhd was known for his flamboyant speeches over the radio, but this one had been rather jarring to those living under the Fascist regime. Hundreds of thousands of Russians who had tuned in to listen that evening were left with a single question in common:"

 amur.66.t: "The Russian Vozhd Rebuffed!"
 amur.66.desc: ""Some believe it best to enlist as many as we can in our fight for a stronger culture, yet that has been the fundamental error of both American parties, who compromise to achieve the dilution of Western thought.

All of history can be seen as a conflict of cultural wills. The English and Pacific Wars of the 1940s demonstrate the defeat of a mongrelized United States, one that had fallen victim to cultural retardation and the failure of the Europeans to properly maintain their culture. The victory of Japan in the Pacific War represents the corruption of European culture in the Americas, and the victory of Germany in the English War represents the ascension of Europe to its rightful place in the world, above the primitive Slav and the vicious Japanese. The so-called Vozhd may be the most brutal of the thugs that rule the culturally desolate Russia, but his support is of no more value to me than the support of my dog! I do not ask for the support of barbarians of any kind, for they cannot escape the influence of cultural principles and are of no use to me."\n\nThe National Progressive Pact has found an unusual source of support today. Konstantin Rodzaevsky, the Vozhd of the newly-formed Russian State, has endorsed Francis Parker Yockey as the only choice to bring down the "web of Jews that control the American political system", an unsurprising turn of phrase for the new leader of Russia.\n\nHowever, Yockey has outright rejected Rodzaevsky's support, and it seems that the new Russian State will maintain a tepid relationship with the USA at best."

He held up the open photo album so that the bartender, standing across the bar from him with dull eyes, could see.\n\n"Uh-huh." came the bored-sounding reply. "Here's your pint, sir." A tall glass of foaming beer slid into view, but Kazimir was too deep in nostalgia to notice. He went straight back to flicking through the album, smiling a little at every notable photo and the memories it brought up.\n\nHe could still remember fleeing across Siberia with his father, an officer in Admiral Kolchak's army. First to Vladivostok, then to Harbin once the Reds arrived and started rounding up old Whites. His old man had died shortly afterwards, half-mad with grief and calling out to his lost comrades. With his last breath, he had implored Kazimir to find the Motherland's true defenders, join their ranks and fight to the death to reclaim their home. Now, seated in a bar in Irkutsk, Kazimir felt that he had finally succeeded in his quest. This - the peace of his home city, liberated from Reds - was what he'd been fighting for all these years. The street brawls in Harbin, the voyage on a rickety old Japanese destroyer, the bloody battles against splitters and communists - it was all worth it for this. For the glory, for the Vozhd, for Russia. He had his place in history, and was more than proud of it."

In particular, he has promised co-operation between his own soldiers and ours in rooting out bandits and partisans in the open and thinly guarded steppes of Manchuria. Though his old enemy Matkovsky is regarded as a more stable choice by some members of the Prime Minister's cabinet, the veteran fascist is at the very least on our doorstep."

For too long he had been forced on the run, always watching for traitors to the Russian people from the Bolsheviks and the Germans! No, no longer would he be another warlord among the rest. Some deals would have to be made with the Japanese, yes, but their recognition would bring any Russian on the Pacific Coast, even those American-backed pirates, to his side.\n\nHis men had spent decades along the Amur river, the bustling city was a sight they missed from their homes across the former Soviet Union. After a chauffeured ride to the center of the city, he arrived to the governor's home, where he, along with the Japanese Foreign Minister, waited at the door.\n\nKonstantin felt out of place among the refined aristocrats of Japan's bureaucracy, but he would have to charm them."

Japan had sought for a long time to avoid the madness in Russia, especially with a man as unpopular as Konstantin Rodzaevsky and his Russian Fascist Party. The Americans were already backing Matkovsky to a degree, sending him guns and supplies when the icy seas were warm enough. At least Japan could provide for its pick in the Russian anarchy via land - and Rodzaevsky would never renege on such a deal. After brief talks, the Prime Minister approved the action, and by the following days, it was made clear to Japan and her puppets across the Co-Prosperity Sphere that Amur was the legitimate Russian government."

With international recognition, and from the Japanese Empire no less, the All-Russian Government could achieve dominance over Eastern Siberia through the threat of Japanese intervention, not to mention the large quantities supplies and intelligence the Japanese would provide in turn.\n\nAs he returned back to Amur, he was greeted as the hero he was. Many felt despair since the split with those bastards in Magadan, the growth of communism once again in Russia, and raids from anti-Japanese bandits. But these would happen no more. No longer would he be another warlord, but Vozhd of all Russia."

The gold mines run deep in Amur, and geologists from Tokyo University have noted the possibility of uranium deposits in the mountains and hills of the region. In exchange for access to some of the mineral wealth, Rodzaevsky is asking for Japanese funding to develop industrial centers around the cities of Amur. His current proposals are far from fair, but enough discussions with the Vozhd will certainly change his mind."

Uzaki thought. He maintained his composure though. "Indeed, the shipment should be good to go, courtesy of the eternal friendship of our nations. You and your crew however will have to stop here and turn back however. Immigration laws apply, as unfortunately we don't have an exception for your government yet."\n\nThe Slavs face was priceless.

Regaining these lands would be a large propaganda win for us domestically and abroad, and the more Russian territory we hold the more legitimate we may appear.\n\nLet us approach Japan for the territory's possible reintegration into Russia. Sending an envoy headed by Rodzaevsky himself to Tokyo should hopefully do the trick. Surely they will be happy to give us the territory, we are on very good terms diplomatically.\n\nWhile we may have to give something in return, we expect nothing less than an agreement on equal terms from our diplomats. Rodzaevsky will even go personally to make sure both us and Japan receive a good deal. Why wouldn't Japan view us as equals?"

While Rodzaevsky's hunger for land seems never-ending, we may be able to get good terms from negotiating with him.\n\nThe territory is worthless to us anyway, more of a drain on our garrisons. The Manchurian government has been having bandit issues in the region for a while. It would help us to have it off our hands. Of course, we wouldn't mention any of it in the negotiations.\n\nHowever, the region is rich in iron, and we have a large mining operation in the region. If we give all of Outer Manchuria away, we could lose access to the vital deposits of the region. Although, we could make a deal with the Russians.

Skyscrapers, trains, and cars surrounded him as they drove through the busy streets. He hoped they would be able to find their hotel.\n\nOver the next week the negotiations for the return of Outer Manchuria to Russia would commence. Rodzaevsky was confident the territory would be returned. They had gotten this far, hadn't they? The Japanese wouldn't have invited such a large delegation to Tokyo if they weren't interested.\n\nHowever, Japan may ask for something in return. We have large deposits of resources now in our control, perhaps a share could be offered to Japan. Rodzaevsky would be happy to give anything just to regain more of Russia."

Our representatives decided to act first to get the upper hand.\n\nThe Russian delegation, seemingly knowing that we would never hand away the land for free, decided to offer a limited amount of resource rights in return for the territory. While Outer Manchuria may be relatively worthless to us besides the mines, Rodzaevsky and his government may do anything to reclaim their former territory, and we know that. Our representatives have requested full rights to the resources, not just the limited amount the Russians offered us.\n\nIn the end, we hope to receive a great deal from the Russians. They seem desperate to receive as much of their former land as possible."

Now the Japanese have requested the rights to all the resources, not just the limited amount we were ready to give.\n\nWhile Rodzaevsky is fretted by this, he has no choice but to agree. Outer Manchuria must be regained, and Rodzaevsky needs the support of the newly liberated territories in the Far East. Besides, giving Japan the resources would surely increase our relations even further and show that we can be diplomatic. Perhaps this would open up even more options for us with the Japanese in the future.\n\nSo, with reluctance, Rodzaevsky has decided to agree to the Japanese proposal. While it may hurt us now with the loss of such a resource-rich area, surely it will be better for us in the long run."

With the Russians are happy to have regained some of their former territory, we are happy to have access to even more resources for which to use. It seems the negotiations have gone well for both parties.\n\nHopefully the bandits and terrorists won't be much of a problem for the Russians, but we no longer have to care. Perhaps they will be even more used to dealing with them than we were. They spent fighting off bandits for a decade, a few more years won't hurt them."

The goal of a diplomatic victory has undoubtedly been achieved, and support for our regime has risen.\n\nThere have been far more boons than just the reclaiming of former Russian lands, however. Conducting a successful diplomatic negotiation with a superpower such as Japan has greatly increased our legitimacy on the world stage and within our own nation. More and more people are begging to support Rodzaevsky and the RFP government.\n\nUnfortunately not everything is perfect, and within hours of our ownership of the province terrorist activity has been reported. It appears while Japan has given us back our former territory, they gave us a bandit problem too. Our Blackshirts are already on the case, having dealt with multiple bandit problems in the past, and we believe the terrorists will be a small stint in our great reclamation."

 amur.82.t: "The Last of the NAJUA"
 amur.82.desc: "The small house just outside the lonely village didn't appear as the headquarters of a terrorist group, but then again, if it did, Kim Il-Sung would have been captured a long time ago. Once a high ranking officer of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army or NAJUA for short, Kim had risen to become the leader as Japan conquered China and Outer Manchuria, dashing his hopes of once again returning to Korea. Now he was a terrorist, hiding in bunkers and homes, and planning attacks on garrisons and railroads.\n\nAlthough, his successful campaigns were beginning to wane. Ever since the Russian government had taken over Outer Manchuria, the Russians were much more efficient than the Japanese at hunting down his group. Blackshirt raids on NAJUA hideouts continued to grow, and its members continued to dwindle.\n\nAs the sun set low over the horizon, Kim could no longer focus on his plans. What did they matter anyway? It's not like they had enough members to carry them out. The remnants of the NAJUA now hid out in this village, hiding in with the locals. Kim decided to head upstairs and maybe even get some sleep if he could.\n\nBut before he had even made it past the window, what he saw outside shocked him to his core. The Blackshirts had found them already! Dark trucks continued to pull into the village, emptying out large groups of Blackshirt soldiers, rounding up anyone they deemed suspicious. It would only be a matter of time before they decided to visit his home, and surely kill him on sight.\n\nHe had to escape while he still had time. Moving quietly out the back door, Kim ran into the deep forest just outside the village. Shouts came from behind him, but if the Blackshirts were chasing him, it was too late. Kim had prepared an escape plan just for this moment, and he already knew where the small safehouse miles deep into the forest was. But Kim knew he would never be able to reappear again. The NAJUA was dead, and another enemy to Japan's empire had fallen once more."

With it, five former Imperial Japanese Navy destroyers have been given to the Free All-Russian Navy, increasing the firepower of the Russian arsenal. The offer being accepted by the Japanese shows our growing interest with them, and the possibilities of friendship on the horizon.\n\nThe ships are to be added to the growing Russian fleet and will be some of the most advanced in our navy. While the hulls may be slightly outdated and the ships stripped of their missiles, they are still state of the art compared to the rest of our navy. Better weapons and equipment capabilities far surpass our own designs, and we believe these ships will continue to be reliable for us years to come."

 amur.84.t: "Of Fascists and Kittens"
 amur.84.desc: ""Go on," Rodzaevsky said to the tiny figure of a kitten before him, "drink." In front of it was a bowl filled with warmed milk. As his fingers touched its head, it hissed. Fierce kitten - when Rodzaevsky found him on the street of his new domain, it scratched its face. No man would dare mess with the little kitten, he thought, brave and courageous in the face of absolute danger. Its coat was a patchy and rough criss-cross of monochrome, but its eyes were bright golden discs: God's gift to the Vozhd of Russians.\n\nAn aide entered. Rodzaevsky did not even notice the footsteps. Russia could wait; the world could wait; the Jews could wait. The party, Matkovsky, Mikhail - none of it mattered. The kitten's hisses and snorts mattered more than the aide's report. Its little tongue lapping the white richness in front of it soothed Konstantin's heart more than anything else. The feel of its fur, coarse and dirty, dusty and grimy, did not repulse nor frighten him. At his touch was a new life, unsullied and unsoiled by the machinations of the world hostile to his ideas.\n\n"Sir?" the aide said, "Are you quite all right?"\n\n"Yes, moreover, what are you doing here?" Get out of here, Rodzaevsky thought. He was in no mood to send anyone to the firing line.\n\n"Nice kitty, sir."\n\n"No shit."\n\n"Have you thought of a name for it yet, sir?" The question troubled Rodzaevsky. He had not given it a thought. What would be a good name for a bold kitten such as this one?\n\n"Mura. He's Mura. Now get out." The aide promptly exited the room and left Rodzaevsky alone, with his new friend, his new companion through the decades to come."

Since his consolidation of power over Central Siberia, he had rejected sleep for regular midnight walks through the bitter winds of [AMR.Capital.GetName], his mind racing with visions of the future. He turned to his bed. Once it had looked so warm and inviting, a haven to rest his thundering head and ignore the crushing bleakness of reality. Now, it was just an empty little distraction in the corner of the room.\n\nThere was much work to be done. The Siberian National State had spread far and wide, crushing all resistance under the glorious expanse of his army. Communist scum had fallen under the treads of his tanks, petty warlords had been eviscerated by the onslaught of his air force and degenerates had been gunned down by his brave infantrymen. His grand vision had brutally forced its way from the tiny frozen wasteland of Amur throughout the shattered realm of Siberia.\n\nHe was the Vozhd of the Russian People. His stagger had transformed into a purposeful stride. His depressed grimace had twisted into a sneer of superiority. Men did not look upon him with apathy or pity, but genuine fear and respect. Throughout the unconquered plains of Russia, ethnic Russian looked towards his impending triumph with joy, while the Judeo-Bolshevik rats scuttled away in horror.\n\nAn enticing bottle of Vodka was waiting for him. He wrapped his numb fingers around it, raised it to his parched throat... and stopped. With a grunt, he forced himself to pour a small glass, which he downed in one gulp. And another, just for good measure. History would speak of the Vozhd's rise to power as greater than Hitler's, and the story of the Russian National State greater than that of the German Reich. For the first time in decades, the sting of vodka and bile did not infect his mouth. Only the taste of victory."

The lid closed shut. Ivana cried out and burst into tears. "Take her outside!" He called out to his wife, ignoring his daughter's wails and hurrying upstairs. How he wanted to comfort her, hold her in his arms, tell her it was going to be alright. But he couldn't. Time was of the essence.\n\nGeorgi was in the same armchair he had nestled in an hour ago, resting his wrinkled hands across his belly contentedly. Lev stared at him in horror.\n\n"I told you to pack!" Lev screamed. "We have to go! Now!"\n\n"If it's all the same to you, I'm about to have a nap." Georgi muttered, visibly annoyed.\n\n"Please, grandfather... they'll be coming soon, the Blackshirts will be coming..."\n\n"I'm old, not senile!" Georgi chuckled. "I have no doubt those fascist thugs will pay me a visit. Let them come! I've dealt with enough anti-Semites in my time." He saw Lev's desperate expression and sighed deeply. "Get out of here, child. Take the family. I will pray for your safety, but don't fool yourself into thinking I'm moving for anyone. I ran from the Bolsheviks. I ran from the War. I jumped from warlord to warlord. I'm tired of running." He winked. "Go on, grandson. Have a good life.""

A ragged man stumbled forwards and fell into the sloppy dirt, moaning in pain as a cacophony of cackles erupted behind him.\n\n"Get the fuck up!" one of the armed thugs roared. Their fat feet were stuffed into black boots. Their bulky torsos were straining against black shirts. Their square heads were squeezed into black military caps. The bloodied cluster of men they were escorting kept their heads to the ground. The more defiant had already been shot.\n\nSome of them were refugee Sablinites. Others were Black Army remnants. A few were democrats, hailing from the fallen Republic. All of them had dared to resist the new tyranny of the Russian Fascist Party.\n\nOne of the Blackshirts complained about the rain, and the partisans were quickly pushed up against a wall. They alternately cried out for freedom, for democracy, for the Revolution. Nothing could be heard over the pouring rain, except the gunshots that followed."

 amur.88.t: "Smoking Them Out"
 amur.88.desc: "The flames crept up the side of the houses, engulfing everything they touched. The fire danced in Igor's pale blue eyes as he watched on in satisfaction. The OOB officers were throwing torches through windows and on top of roofs, screaming slurs and chanting songs. Igor had no time for such unprofessionalism.\n\nThe reports had seemed trustworthy. Jews were hiding in the village, sheltered in cellars and under floorboards by traitors to the state. It had been a tiring day, and Igor had long since lost the energy to search every single house. Instead, he had given the order to smoke the rats out.\n\nAn old man staggered out of one of the houses, coughing violently. A young man leapt out of a window with a knife and was gunned down immediately. A pair of women fled from their burning house screaming, and were chased down by a few hooting officers. The flames illuminated the night sky, painting a pretty picture for those alive to see it."

 amur.89.desc: "The silence of the room was overwhelming. Party comrades shuffled their papers and coughed awkwardly as they waited for the Vozhd to speak. At last, Rodzaevsky cleared his throat and scanned his cruel eyes across the room.\n\n"My Soratniki," Rodzaevsky began. "The Second Congress of the Russian Fascist Party is now in session! Some of you may be wondering why I would call such a meeting. After all, has the Party not transcended to glorious new heights? Has unity and strength not brought Central Siberia to heel?" Sycophantic murmurs of agreement broke out throughout the room. "A house may look grand, it may look powerful, it may look unyielding. But what happens if the foundations are weak? It collapses in on itself." The murmurs grew louder and the nodding more vigorous. Rodzaevsky slammed his fist onto the table and silence fell across the room. "Do you think I'm a fucking idiot? Do you think me blind to the infighting between Bolotov and Shekherev?"\n\nAlexander Bolotov and Georgy Shekherev glanced at each other with pale faces.\n\n"Let me make one thing clear," Rodzaevsky spat. "I am the Vozhd. I am the Party. None of you are untouchable. None of you. If you threaten the stability of all we have achieved, your carcasses will be tossed into a frozen pit!" He pointed aggressively at the two men. "History will view you as heroes, or it will not remember you at all. You decide your fate.""

Yet the Party was not pure.\n\nDespite all that the Vozhd had achieved, dissent still festered in the upper echelons of the Russian Fascist Party like a disease that keeps the host weak and infirm. Those who had long doubted Rodzaevsky continued to scurry through the corridors of power, conspiring behind his back and plotting his removal from power. They wanted someone younger, someone safer, someone more pliable to their whims. The fact that he had tolerated such men for so long spoke volumes to his former desperation. Now, however, it was time for change.\n\nRodzaevsky had drawn up the lists with sadistic satisfaction. Bolotov had provided his own useful contributions, of course, targeting those who were allegedly plotting against the state. From the lowliest Blackshirt to the highest Council member, none would be spared the Vozhd's justice. Some of the executions would be brutal, of course, to strike fear into any remaining weasels on the Supreme Council fortunate enough to escape the bullet."
 amur.90.a: "Toss them into the pits."

 amur.91.t: "All Quiet"
 amur.91.desc: "The shouts of protest, the jangle of cuffs, and the crack of gunfire have fallen silent.\n\nThe paranoia of the Vozhd has been sated, and his enemies have either fled or been eliminated. Shekherev's Blackshirts relax back into their routines of suspicion and watchfulness, and Bolotov compiles new lists for the Vozhd to examine. In time, more will be put against the wall, and the Vozhd will find new opposition to fear among even his most loyal followers. But for now, the executions have dropped in number, and the Vozhd focuses on other matters."

The tireless efforts of my men have led to a general decrease in subversive activity, and the agitators have made their presence hidden for fear of our retribution. We are well-armed from the industry of Central Siberia, and preparations for the war for the west have begun."\n\nRodzaevsky was unimpressed. "You're sure? What basis do you have for this, Shekherev?"\n\n"The number of arrests has decreased. Reports of anti-state thought in the ranks are decreasing from the small numbers they were already at. Our reign is becoming more secure every day."\n\nAlexander Bolotov said nothing as the Blackshirt leader continued to extol his successes. Patience was critical, for the Vozhd had little to spare these days, even for his most trusted advisors.\n\n"Then why are you focusing your efforts on internal matters? Or have you forgotten there is a war to fight? The enemy no longer lies within, if you have done your job properly."\n\nSilence reigned over the office, before a whisper from the Vozhd.\n\n"Have you done your job, Georgy?"\n\nShekherev stammered for a moment before Rodzaevsky interrupted again. "Get me a report on the state of our armed forces. NOW!"\n\nA hastily stammered affirmation and a hasty exit later, Bolotov and the Vozhd were alone.\n\n"He still thinks we are in the old days, Alexander. The enemy within has been beaten down and cannot hope to dislodge us. The enemy to the west is a false and weak pretender to leadership of the Russian people. But even farther west, the Germans claim a legacy of National Socialism which they do not deserve! Their pathetic attempts to uphold their facade will fail in the face of the true heirs!""

 amur.93.t: "Retracing Our Steps"
 amur.93.desc: "How did we get here?\n\nThis question had been on the mind of the Vozhd for days. He had grown up amidst violence in Blagoveshchensk and fled from his home at eighteen. Now, after nearly fifty years of struggle, he had returned. He had thought that he would return in chains after betrayal by the Japanese, or Bolshevik sympathizers, or sold out by his own - like that traitor Matkovsky! But instead, he returned a Caesar, at the head of an army of the true!\n\nHe still fondly remembered the years in Harbin, waiting for an opportunity, sniffing out traitors and Jews to give them what they deserved. But age had dulled his desire for such indulgences, and the wild ambiance of Harbin had given way to the former Communist Party headquarters in Novosibirsk. The bitter cold of desolate Zeya had left as well, and the warmth of a heated office gave his aged body comfort in his duties. The struggles of those days, forty years in exile, made him stronger, and those who served with him. Bolotov, that violent and unpredictable sycophant, had also grown into an effective soldier for National Socialism through years of hard living.\n\nYes, it was the exile that separated the ones who would remain true to National Socialism from the self-serving power seekers, the Petlins of the world, the bastards who had set him back years, stolen his woman, and wasted thousands of Russian lives in a futile struggle against the inevitable rise of the one Vozhd. The struggle would have to continue, for Russia to survive.\n\nThe mewling of the cat interrupted his thoughts, and the Vozhd took it into his arms, stroking its soft fur as he thought of coming victories."

Typed documents cluttered the surface of the table, outlining troop movements and supply lines, but the Vozhd had given his attention to the map. The borders of old Russia, picked at by the vultures of Japan and above all, Germany. The western weaklings would fall first, then Moskowien and the borders would be restored. And then, perhaps they would march farther, and show the German degenerates how far they had fallen from the true path.\n\nThe Vozhd grasped for the bottle by his side, opened it with practiced ease, and then-\n\nHis thoughts raced. Memories of a half century in exile, the battles of the reunification wars, the end of the traitor Matkovsky, and knowledge of what he needed. Strength. He had been a weakened cripple, relying on the crutches of other fascists and alcohol to make it here. And as he had advanced, they had been kicked away by him one by one. Matkovsky, the traitor. The violent thugs Shekherev and Bolotov.\n\nAnd now, this destructive, pitiable habit, had become unnecessary. All self-doubt had left his mind. Traitors would quell before him and not dare to enact their plots. The army of the true would obey his command, marching to Moscow and maybe even onwards. The Vozhd stood alone, unflinching and imperious. The bottle gave a solid clink as he forcefully set it upon the table, and screwed the cap back on.\n\nNot today."

Today the airwaves across the State had been preempted for a speech by the Vozhd, Konstantin Rodzaevsky.\n\nAndrey had recently reached the age where he was required to join the Little Ones, and so he had been made very aware of what the Vozhd had done for Russia. For Russians. For Russians like him. It had been a political awakening, and Andrey had taken to it with great enthusiasm. Indeed, he was likely to become one of the youngest junior leaders in his section.\n\nAs the Vozhd spoke of yet more recent triumphs, Andrey could feel his chest swell with pride. This man, this visionary, had taken a stand against the mongrels, the traitors, the foreigners, and the parasites, and emerged victorious against them all. He had shaped a strong nation for boys like Andrey to grow strong in, and Andrey knew now that there was no greater figure to emulate, and no greater position to aspire to - even if there was only one man who could ever fill it.\n\nHis mother called him for breakfast, interrupting the Vozhd's words, and Andrey screamed at her to be quiet. He could not, would not, miss a word. The Vozhd spoke for them all, his senior leader had told him, and so it was their duty to always listen. Andrey would listen. Andrey would obey. Andrey would teach others to do the same.\n\nAnd, one day, Andrey would meet the great Vozhd. He would find a way. He would prove himself worthy."

He lost track after what felt like a couple of hours after overtime began. They were preparing to 'purify' Russia, upper management said, and the factory and its workers needed to 'sacrifice as much as they could for the Motherland' in the coming weeks, and so he spent the entire day and a good deal of the night supervising the increasingly exhausted workers in their labor. He stared out at the darkened streets, trying to remember which one was his and summoning all the energy in his legs to not collapse there and then.\n\nAfter an eternity of walking he got to his house near the edge of town. Stumbling into the door, he looked at the clock. 11:20 PM. Seventeen hours of work. He needed a break. Creeping into the kitchen, he opened the pantry and took out a bottle of vodka, and drank it straight from the bottle. How much more would he have to sacrifice for the Motherland?

Funny how that had worked out.\n\nHe passed the corner where the old pub used to stand where he and his fellow officer cadets used to drink on weekends. Now it was an apartment building. A shame, he thought. Maybe if he gets posted here he'll have it rebuilt.\n\nBut Tyrsin wasn't here to sightsee and reminisce about his youth. He was here on official business.\n\nThe car pulled up to an old apartment building- even this was still standing here, he thought. He and a squad of soldiers exited the car and headed into the building. He was told the head of a major spy ring lived here, and it was his job to collect him before he could be properly liquidated. According to the intelligence papers, the spymaster lived here. Apartment 129. A private busted down the door and a man with a light brown beard, pale wisps grey with age, stood shocked at the men. Akim? The guy who used to buy him drinks at the pub?\n\nAkim shouted, tears streaming down his face as Tyrsin read the arrest warrant, and the soldiers dragged him out of the apartment.\n\n"Please!

When they were finally over their shifts they had celebrated with a few shots before they started their walk home. However, their good cheer did not last long. As they turned a corner they passed by a bar frequented by soldiers of the All-Russian government. A small group of soldiers broke off from their position at the entryway and drunkenly stumbled their way in front of the group.\n\n"Loo' at these fuckin mongrels, thinkin' they can just walk by their bettas without payin the toll," a particularly burly man at the front of the group spoke with a heavy slur.

Me and my friends here are gonna make you wish you had never crawled out of your fucking caves."\n\n"Please sir, we are just trying to get home... please," Michil was nearing hysterics. If they lost what little money they had it was likely they would end up starving to death. Before he could continue, the man slammed his fist into his stomach. The air was forced out of his lungs and he fell to his knees as they laughed around him. Before the man could continue his beating, a loud whistle broke through the air.\n\nFrom down the street marched a grizzled and absolutely livid looking Sergeant. "What the fuck do you think you are doing, you fucking reprobates! Get your asses back to the barracks before I personally skin your hides!" The look on the man's face made it seem as if he was dead serious. Michil opened his mouth to thank him but it snapped shut when he saw the raw, undisguised disgust he had for him and his friends."

Even after the death of Comrade Sablin, the Red Army units under his command did not simply disappear. They kept up the fight in cells all throughout the fascist territory. Sasha and his men had been tracking this group of fascists from the moment they entered Buryatia, preparing to ambush them at their most vulnerable. As far as he knew, none of the remnants of the Red Army had sought shelter in the village below them. The people of the village were innocent of any collaboration, but that was never something that mattered to Rodzaevsky's dogs.\n\nThe bastards had gathered the men of the village in the central square. The women and children were nowhere to be seen, though they were probably hiding in their homes. Sasha would have called for an attack then if it weren't for the numerical inferiority of his forces. The fascists outnumbered them two to one and were better equipped besides. As a result, they could only watch as the men were lined up against the walls of the local temple and shot.\n\nWhen the last man fell to the ground the soldiers began pulling barrels of fuel out of their trucks. Barrels of oil were poured onto houses and shops as the innocent people within screamed in horror. Anyone who tried to run was shot before they got far. The temple was the last to be ransacked and prepared to burn. When all was ready, the soldiers set fire to every building in the village.\n\nCaptain Sasha Minikin could do nothing but weep as the winds carried the screams of the dying to his men. All around him men wept and wretched as the village burned. Sasha looked down at his uniform, at the rank insignia that rested there.

Be proud of yourselves, for at last, we can bring about a national rebirth and crush all those who brought us low!" Although some of those in the crowd looked hesitant, most cheered at this great accomplishment. After all, they reasoned, no government could be worse than the chaos they had gone through. Could it? A wild grin on his face, Rodzaevsky let them cheer for a minute, before signalling for them to quiet. "Now, some of you might be wondering just who it was that brought the motherland to ruin. I'll tell you who it was. It was, in part, the fault of those damned Judeo-Bolsheviks, there is no denying that. However, the ones most deserving of the blame, of our fury, are those corrupt fascist pretenders in Berlin, corrupted by Jewish whispers and the wealth of Zion! We will crush them, all of them, and take back the motherland for the sake of Russians, and Russians alone. Today, we rest. Tomorrow, however, we prepare to bring the fire of hell down upon every German who continues to obey the orders of Jews!"

With so much new territory, the capital had to be moved. Zeya had been useful for a time, but it was both too small and too provincial to serve as the centre of power for a resurgent fascist state. The move had to happen, and two choices had presented themselves for service as the replacement.\n\nThe first was obvious. Irkutsk was one of the largest cities in all of Siberia, possessed considerable infrastructure, transport and otherwise, and further was much closer to the border over which Rodzaevsky knew future campaigns would be launched. But that also meant that it was more exposed, and its previous status as the capital of the Soviet remnant state meant that saboteurs and communists likely remained, hidden among the civilian populace.\n\nThe other option was Chita, until recently occupied by the breakaway monarchists. It was smaller and more isolated - though still less so than Zeya - but that meant that it offered far more security than did Irkutsk. Its status as holding one of the Harbin Three also imparted some ideological and propaganda advantages. But its distance from future frontlines would impose an administrative burden, to be sure.\n\nBoth had strengths and weaknesses, but Rodzaevsky knew one had to be chosen. And as the unquestioned ruler of his state, he also knew the choice could only be his."

 AMR_rodz_econ_development_category: "Developing Our Realm"
 AMR_rodz_econ_development_category_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the reclamation of the §iPort of Magadan§! from the snake §qMatkovsky§! and the §Wgreat city of Rodzaevsk§!, we now have our windows to the outside world which will allow us to not only catch up with the petty warlords in the former §eUnholy Union§! and beyond, but surpass them as well. We will be embarking on an ambitious industrialization project the likes of which Russia has never seen. A product of the wisdom of §WKonstantin Rodzaevsky, Vozhd of the All-Russian Government§!, his grand vision calls for the rapid expansion of our strategic infrastructure and industrial base, both of which were sorely neglected by the §eJews§! that ran our Motherland into the abyss.\n\nWhile it may seem ambitious beyond our abilities on paper, we have several advantages that put us leagues ahead of the corrupt fiefdoms west of us. The ace up our sleeve is our relationship with the §fCPS§!, skillfully cultivated over the decades by the §WVozhd§! since our days in Harbin. With their industrial and technical expertise on our side, we will be able to leapfrog the development of our rivals. Furthermore, with access to the only working port in Russia and direct land access into Manchuria we'll have better access to Asian markets than all our rivals. Lastly, our recent liberation of Russian lands from the §eJudeo-Bolsheviks§!, §qKosher-Fascists§! and §OPlutocratic Tsarists§! has netted us more than enough of a surplus labor pool to achieve these goals in the timeframe envisioned by our economists and military leaders. While true Russians who cherish their Motherland will work honestly and reap the rewards of their efforts, those who brutalized our beloved Motherland and sought to feast on her corpse will need to pay their penance for what they've done to Russia. Rest assured, the Blackshirts under §WAlexander Bolotov§! will make sure that their debt to the nation is repaid in full.\n\n§WFor God, Nation, and Labor!§!"

 AMR_amur_gold: "Amur's Gold Deposits"
 AMR_amur_gold_desc: "The largest known deposits of gold in all of Russia rests beneath Amur itself. To the §eJew§!, this metal is only fit for vulgar displays of opulence. But with countless other applications within industry and electronics, the practical uses of these minerals alone make it worth the effort to excavate them. Given adequate equipment and Blackshirt supervision, we'll organize the mercenaries that fought with the snake §qMatkovsky§! to bear the brunt on this one."
 AMR_amur_highway: "The Amur Highway"
 AMR_amur_highway_desc: "The M58 highway project was scheduled to be a key road link as part of the Siberian Plan, linking the administrative center of the oblast with Irkutsk via Chita. Planned to span from Chita in the west to the city that bears the name of our §WVozhd§! to the east, like many other failures of the §eUnholy Union§! it never saw completion, but if it had been it would give us another strong land route for our goods into Manchuria. Originally, the §eBolshevik NKVD§! were planning to make ordinary Russians work themselves to death to build this stretch of road. God sure has an odd sense of humor, because now the same animals that were supposed to supervise this unjust act of slave labor are now rotting away in the very prison camps they once ran. Perhaps we should humor God further by making these prisoners finish the work they were so adamant that others would do for them?"
 AMR_all_russian_metal_union_amur: "The All-Russian Metal Works of Amur"
 AMR_all_russian_metal_union_amur_desc: "Despite a lot of Amur's metal deposits being accessible to us already, for too long the real bottleneck has been our inability to properly refine and work with these. Therefore, one of our first steps in bringing the region's economy back to life should be the construction of metalworks throughout the state. Their mighty chimneys will soar into the skyline of Zeya, allowing the city to start competing with the other industrial cities that remain in Russia."
 AMR_start_zeya_dam: "Start Building the Zeya Dam"
 AMR_start_zeya_dam_desc: "The Zeya River is an untapped source of boundless energy that will be pivotal in turning our capital into an industrial powerhouse. As this is a matter of complex construction engineering far beyond the scope of what we can do for ourselves, we'll contract the §fSumitomo Group§! to lay the foundations for this great feat of engineering. While completing the full hydroelectric facility to a point where it'll be finished will take many years, we should be able to see some early benefits soon."
 AMR_oil_for_food: "Oil for Food"
 AMR_oil_for_food_desc: "Given the underdeveloped state of our economy and access to resources, parts of our economy are currently not needed until we've developed our industrial base further. What we do sorely need is food imports to make up for the poor agricultural yields in our region. As luck would have it, our benefactors in Japan are willing to send us food supplies in exchange for some of our surplus fuel."
 AMR_Zeya_LJ_rail: "The Zeya-Rodzaevsk-Longjiang Railway"
 AMR_Zeya_LJ_rail_desc: "As important as our port of Magadan is, the inhospitable climate means that the port will be difficult to use for a large portion of the year as we lack the shipbuilding capacity to produce the amount of icebreakers we need to keep the port fully operational all year round. By rebuilding the old and neglected railway links with Manchuria, we'll be able to transfer high volumes of goods even when Magadan isn't able to operate at full capacity."
 AMR_yakutsk_working_undesirables: "Put Yakutsk's Undesirables to Work"
 AMR_yakutsk_working_undesirables_desc: "Unsurprisingly, after we brought Yakutsk back under full Russian control it turned out that its population is filled to the brim with undesirables, thanks in no small part due to their recent flirtations with plutocratic liberalism. Its old powerbase and its adherents need to be put into harsh, corrective labor. We'll relocate a sizable portion of the former republic's more rebellious elements to a more containable location and make sure that the remaining ones are put into harsh, corrective labor to cure them of their prior misconceptions."
 AMR_expand_Magadan: "Expand the Port of Magadan"
 AMR_expand_Magadan_desc: "We've laid the groundwork for a strong industrial export economy. Before we go further, we'll need to expand the port of Magadan, lest it becomes a bottleneck for our exports in the future. Magadan will be turned from a simple trade port to a regional trade hub, able to handle numerous freight ships and their cargo by expanding the port facilities and importing enough ice breakers from Japan to keep the port ice free even during the winters. Time is of the essence as we need to rapidly boost our capacity to meet our growth quotas, however. Who better to make sure the project gets completed on time, then, than the snake §qMatkovsky's men§! in captivity? Under the watchful eyes of the Blackshirts, they'll toil in their precious port until the end of days is upon them."

 AMR_has_completed_a_mutually_beneficial_arrangement: "Has completed focus §YA Mutually Beneficial Arrangement§!"

 AMR_road_of_bones_v2: "Another Road of Bones"
 AMR_road_of_bones_v2_desc: "The M58 connects to the M56 leading into Magadan. Built in the past decades, it's in a sorry state as §ethe Bolsheviks§! built it with forced gulag labor. The brutality of the §eNKVD§! left so many dead Russians in its wake that the final stretch of it is known as the "Road of Bones", yet for all that sacrifice it's barely functional enough to drive on, let alone transport large volumes of goods. In order to get our products to Japan and make better use of Magadan's expanded capacity, we must utilize our excess labor pool to improve the road links between it and the industries of our capital. It's only a fitting punishment that Yagoda's men finish the work they started here."
 AMR_break_Yakutsk: "Break Yakutsk"
 AMR_break_Yakutsk_desc: "Despite our best efforts to reintegrate the Yakut into the Russian state, they keep resisting our rightful rule of all Russians. §WThe Vozhd of all Russians§! is justifiably concerned with these developments and fear that there may yet be more §eBolshevik§! and §Oliberal agitators§! lingering in the state even after we cut the head of the snake that fed them the lies about democracy in the first place. Unlike the §eJews§! however, we'll grant them a chance to prove their worth to the Russian state through labor, unwilling though they may be to accept our outstretched hand of help.\n\nThis will be the most ambitious operation by the Blackshirts so far. Under the leadership of §WBolotov§!, Thousands of our loyal men supported by deputized Russian patriots will mount police operations in the former republic. Those deemed guilty of Bolshevik and liberal subversion will be relocated to various parts of our nation where we have a need for laborers. After constructing their new living facilities, they'll be made to work in our mines. A few years of honest work digging up the gold, silver, diamonds, nickel and iron ore we need to rebuild our nation ought to be enough to rehabilitate them."
 AMR_export_crops: "Export Crops to the CPS"
 AMR_export_crops_desc: "Amur itself is home to some of the most arable lands in the Russian Far East. For years, we've primarily focused on food crops for ourselves. Thanks to our expanding economy however, we should look into shifting some of our production towards more lucrative crops to the §fCPS§!. We'll return Amur to its former status as Russia's greatest producer of soybeans and export our crops to our benefactors in Japan by earmarking portions of the arable lands for this purpose. To make sure that no important segments of the population suffers from any potential food shortfall resulting from this shift in agricultural focus, our Department of Agriculture has drafted a plan to transfer some of the Buryat labor regiments to act as an extra labor force to till these lands until our system has adjusted to this change."
 AMR_Zeya_dam_P2: "Fire Up Zeya's Turbines"
 AMR_Zeya_dam_P2_desc: "Thanks to our good friends within the Asano and Sumitomo industrial concerns, we look set to have the Zeya Dam brought into a limited operational capacity in record time by importing and installing high quality components from Japan the likes of which no current domestic Russian industry can produce. Once the plant is operational, we'll not only boast an impressive electricity production capable of fueling our industries and ending the necessities for civilian energy rations, but we'll also be able to sell our excess power directly to fuel Japanese industries in Manchuria as well, bolstering our revenues even further."
 AMR_japanese_experts: "Japanese Experts To Magadan"
 AMR_japanese_experts_desc: "With our ever strengthening ties to our good friends in Japan, we now have the opportunity to bring in Japanese engineers and administrators to bolster the economic output of Magadan. As a fully fledged trading port brought up to Japanese standards, we can vastly increase our export volumes to Japan. With the port fully upgraded, we can finally declare that Matkovsky's former loyalists in the Magadan labor detachments can be declared redeemed through their labor to our nation. As a reward for earning the right to return to civilian life, they'll be given the privilege of serving the rest of their productive lives in the port of Magadan as laborers under Japanese supervision."

 AMR_ruthless_industrialization: "Ruthless Border Industrialization"
 AMR_ruthless_industrialization_desc: "From humble beginnings, we've reached the final stretch of §Wour Vozhd Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky's§! grand plan to revitalize the Russian economy and uplift the national soul of labor. It calls for a rapid industrialization of our border cities with the §fCPS§! to maximize our exports of metals, industrial components and other goods into the §fSphere§!. With victory near, our proud labor units stand ready to carry out this mission. Naturally, our Blackshirts stand ready to make sure their morale doesn't falter in the process."
 AMR_manchurian_pipeline: "The Manchurian Pipeline"
 AMR_manchurian_pipeline_desc: "The §fSphere§! craves energy and we shall provide. Utilizing and coordinating our remaining labor battalions across the stretch of the pipeline, we shall connect our gas fields around Irkutsk directly into the Manchurian energy grid, allowing Japan to quench its thirst for power with a steady stream of gas to power her industries. Naturally, we'll see a very healthy injection of income from this piece of strategic infrastructure."
 AMR_fujitsu_western_plants: "Stepping Stone Into the Future"
 AMR_fujitsu_western_plants_desc: "§mFujitsu's factories§! are in a constant need for components and we stand ready to comply. With our increased industrial capacity, we'll be able to have several of our major factory complexes in the west into dedicated plants for manufacturing key components required in Japan's electronics industries. In exchange for a healthy injection into our state finances, thanks to §mFujitsu's§! world-leading expertise in modern computing technology this will act as a springboard for any future efforts to modernize our own electronics industry."
 AMR_nissan_west: "Heavy Industry for a Stronger Russia"
 AMR_nissan_west_desc: "§mNissan§! is arguably the world's most successful automotive concern. It's therefore a sign of our tremendous progress that we're being allowed to turn a portion of our civilian industry into a dedicated force towards providing Nissan with components for the Japanese export economy, rather than just producing the resources they're made of. By becoming a key component provider for Japan's auto industry, we should be able to improve our own heavy vehicle industry as well thanks to this partnership."
 AMR_sphere_training_ground: "Sphere Training Ground"
 AMR_sphere_training_ground_desc: "Japan recognizes our value as an ally and the importance of us winning the war against our western foes. In light of this, we'll set up a new program under the guise of being a joint §fCPS§! training program where a certain number of recruits from smaller §fSphere§! allies get transferred to Amur in order to conduct their military service within our army. It wouldn't be the first time an Indian Legion fought alongside stalwart fascist soldiers to liberate Judeo-occupied lands, after all."
 AMR_oil_for_food_2: "More Oil For More Aid"
 AMR_oil_for_food_2_desc: "In exchange for a substantial proportion of the fuel resources extractable in the Far East, we can increase the amount of aid that we receive. Doing this will ease some of the burdens on the true Russian citizens of our state and allow us to focus even further on our rapid industrialization program."
 AMR_expand_Magadan_2: "The All-Russian Container Port of Magadan"
 AMR_expand_Magadan_2_desc: "With more and more territories of Russia liberated by our soldiers and ever greater industrial potential put under our control we will need to expand §ithe port of Magadan§!, our window into the outside world, one last time to meet the ever-increasing demand from our brothers and sisters in the §fCPS§!. Magadan will soon be known as one of the great container ports of Asia, a mighty monument to Russian diligence in labor and commerce. Our Swastika shall fly proudly, showing our might to every ship that approaches our sacred Russian lands."

 AMR_smash_Tomsk: "Smash the Jewish Interstate of Tomsk"
 AMR_smash_Tomsk_desc: "Tomsk is a truly repugnant den of self-proclaimed §eJewish Bolsheviks§! that rot our nation from within and §OMasonic intellectuals§! that poison the minds of the Russian people. Tomsk is their rotten capital in Siberia, a monument to all that is vile. From the so-called salons there was once nothing but a constant spewing of their degenerate filth unto the masses. It's time that we eradicated this mental and cultural pestilence once and for all.\n\nIn an operation that will make our treatment of the Yakut seem like the apprehension of a few petty criminals, the Blackshirts shall mobilize in force to crush them. Anyone corrupted by the blights of the salons will be arrested and put into labor camps. We shall construct new prisons throughout the region where these criminals will labor until they've repaid their debts to the Russian peoples. The worst and most depraved offenders, those who have harmed our nation the most, will be hauled off to the old Norilsk gulag facilities to fester away in the camps §ethe Jews of the Unholy Union§! originally built for Russian patriots. They will earn the privilege of paying off our final debts to Japan for their bountiful aid by toiling in the nickel mines until the mines run dry. §WFor God, Nation, and Labor!§!"
 AMR_erase_communal_legacy: "Erase the Communal Legacy"
 AMR_erase_communal_legacy_desc: "The nefariously scheming §eJew§! and the brute lured in by his lies are two sides of the same coin. Eastern Krasnoyarsk and the northern hovels of Mongolia were recently home of some of the most despicable excuses for men to have ever walked among honest Russians. The old anarchist communes and the bastions of failed military communism were testbeds for some of the most destructive social experiments to have ever taken place in our beloved Motherland. To this day, the influence of these repugnant ideologies linger on, rotting the heart of Siberia.\n\nNow that we've liberated these areas, we must step in and remedy this situation as quickly as possible. The Blackshirts will swarm upon the region to extinguish the last gasps of these ideological infestations. New labor camps will be established, and the worst offenders - those who truly despite all that is good and orderly the most - will be shipped off to Norilsk where Blackshirts and Kenpeitai will keep close watch on them."
 AMR_novosib_mitsubishi: "Mitsubishi's Stake in Novosibirsk"
 AMR_novosib_mitsubishi_desc: "One of the largest cities in Russia, Novosibirsk is a complicated case. A corporate-driven state with an economy driven by oligarchs. Though many of its worst features resemble those of liberal plutocracies, the city may yet be saved. Spearheaded by §mMitsubishi§! and various Keiretsu, the Sphere corporations will step in with their money, their resources, and the backing of the Japanese state to fill the vacuum left behind by the old corporate bodies that reigned over Novosibirsk. This should allow for a smooth transition back into normality for the city and allow it to become a productive and prosperous part of the new Russian nation. As an added benefit of having some of the foremost aircraft manufacturers in the world operate in Novosibirsk, we can expect to be able to use their expertise as a springboard for our future aviation modernization plans."
 AMR_sib_class_collab: "Siberian Class Collaboration"
 AMR_sib_class_collab_desc: "There was once a mad king that lorded over Kemerovo as his own decadent fiefdom. For all the corruption that his mind, body and soul had suffered, Nikolay Krylov was a man that at his core embodied a lot of the ideals of Russian fascism but fell short due to the §eJudeo-Bolshevik influences§! he'd suffered from. The idea of a traditional Russian head of state working together with the classes while maintaining what makes the nation strong isn't too far off from the party platform of the RFP, though he obviously fell short in making it come together due to his debilitating alcoholism and far a more destructive case of §OMasonic delusions§!.\n\nBe that as it may, as vestiges of support for his regime still linger in Kemerovo and Krasnoyarsk however, we'll have to make the best of things to ensure a smooth transition for these areas into the new Russian state. Affording them a gentler touch, we'll reinstate some of the union structures of old and have our propaganda ministry rehabilitate the legacy of the deranged king into something more in line with our party platform, if nothing else than to keep the factories humming along. Our Ministry of Labor has also suggested the possibility of giving a mostly symbolic position to his daughter Lydia in order to help get a class-collaborationist structure lest she wishes to see her father's legacy utterly upended while his descendents rot in exile or captivity, but these steps will suffice from now."
 AMR_finish_Zeya: "Finish the Zeya Dam"
 AMR_finish_Zeya_desc: "Years after the project started, the Zeya Dam is close to being complete. A huge undertaking, the project now sees us in possession of two of the great hydroelectric power plants of the Far East. While some foreign observers may call into question the enormous focus on what may seem like a relatively small city, to the Russian people the symbolism of the Vozhd's accomplishment is undeniable. Indeed, the dam itself is like a symbol for our own rise as we started out from humble beginnings to rise to greatness. Once the dam stands complete, it'll power our great industries and allow for a much greater production capacity. The long, cold days and nights of rationing energy and working under candlelight are long past us now."

 AMR_oil_for_food_dynamic_modifier: "Oil for Food"
 AMR_oil_for_food_dynamic_modifier_desc: "Due to the mostly inhospitable farming conditions in our core territories, we've requested food deliveries from the Sphere to ease any shortfalls in food that our focus on heavy industries and export crops has resulted in."
 AMR_Sphere_training_ground: "Sphere Training Ground"
 AMR_Sphere_training_ground_desc: "Due to Japan's recognition of our importance to the Sphere, we'll routinely receive conscripts from across the Sphere to help us fill out the ranks of our units."
 AMR_labor_unto_redemption_dynamic_modifier: "Labor Unto Redemption"
 AMR_labor_unto_redemption_dynamic_modifier_desc: "In order to win our struggle and unify the Russian nation under the Swastika, we all have to come together to work for the common goal of saving Mother Russia. Those ultimately responsible for Russia's sorry state will bear an extra heavy burden in the reconstruction of the Motherland. Under close supervision of the Blackshirts, these egregiously immoral enemies of all Russians are pressed into labor battalions that will give them a chance to earn a ticket back to civilian life by rebuilding what their masters destroyed. The few that make it to the end can be considered to have been redeemed in the eyes of God and the Nation through their labor."
 
 AMR_oil_for_food_tt: "Our poverty and growth rate will §Gimprove§! at the §Rexpense§! of our fuel!"

AMR.smuta.1.t: "The Salvation of Russia"
AMR.smuta.1.desc: "Through the glow of candlelight, Rodzaevsky peered towards the map of Russia mounted upon the wall. Sloppily shaded in with light brown, he gazed at his little corner of Russia, the corners of his mouth upturning, knowing that this territory he controlled was pure.\n\nA land now free of anyone who dare challenge him, free of any traitors who would undermine his will and the party's, and cleansed of any degenerates that could bring down his state, and corrupt the soul of the Russian people.\n\nBut this wasn't enough.\n\nRodzaevsky's heart sank, he looked outwards, taking in how little of Holy Russia was free of degeneracy—surrounded by the pseudo-communist kosher fascists in Magadan, and the impotent relics of the past that governed Chita. A dread of sorts swallowed Rodzaevsky's soul. There was so much to be done and so much standing against him.\n\nInstinctively he reached to his side, expecting to grasp a bottle of vodka. As he reached, he was met instead by a warm and furry feline who'd plopped herself down in front of the bottle. Mura purred as Rodzaevsky rubbed her stomach, his worries slowly fading as he evaluated the situation.\n\nRodzaevsky turned back towards the map. Yes, there was much to be done, but he had a strong party who would stand behind him and achieve his vision, whatever the cost they must pay it, even in blood. Russia will be saved, there was no doubt - and it will be by his hand."
AMR.smuta.1.a: "And the Vozhd would be Russia's salvation."

AMR.smuta.2.t: "A Forever Home"
AMR.smuta.2.desc: "Only footsteps and the clanking of chains could be heard as a group of four men were paraded down the streets. Kliment, the man in front - yanked out of his home only minutes ago, felt the eyes of the onlookers pierce through his skin. The crowd was dead silent, bar for one man hurling obscenities and yelling 'Traitor!' at the men.\n\nKliment didn't even know what he had done. Sure he said some unflattering things about the regime behind closed doors, but he was careful to do so with only those he trusted; people who he thought were friends. Kliment wondered who it was that turned him in - assuming that the party wasn't just throwing darts at a board to meet some arbitrary quota.\n\nBeing led like a blind sheep, or perhaps more appropriately, a lamb to the slaughter, Kliment had no clue what his fate would be. Death? By hanging or by gunshot? If this was his fate, he hoped for the latter. Would there be a trial? Of course not. The Vozhd had no time for those he deemed guilty to delay justice.\n\nAfter a brief train ride, Kliment began to see a clearer picture. A large archway stood ahead of the men, labeled 'God, Nation, Labor', between a fence covered in hastily placed barbed wire. Inside the fence were hundreds of men, many of whom were nothing but skin and bone, seemingly barely able to hold the hammers which they pounded the stones with.\n\nA group of guards greeted the men as they were handed over, "Welcome Home!" one of them gleefully exclaimed, as the rest chuckled to themselves. Reality finally set in, and Kliment now knew that he would never see his family again."
AMR.smuta.2.a: "Their fates lie sealed."

AMR.smuta.3.t: "Your Part, to Save Russia"
AMR.smuta.3.desc: "Vadim was not a particularly distinctive man. He did what his country asked of him but wasn't exceptionally committed to it. Whether that be the old Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, or this new peculiar statelet, he had found form around him. He paid little mind to Rodzaevsky's rise and continued on with his life, working, attending church often, and raising his children.\n\nYet recently, he noticed a clear shift in the atmosphere around Zeya. While they were always somewhat boisterous before - the Fascist Party seemed to have overtaken public life in very new, and obvious ways.\n\nJust the other day, his son came home from school, seeping praise upon the Vozhd and excitedly telling Vadim the tales of his conquests, such as how he personally led the long march from Harbin to liberate Zeya from the depravity and tyranny of Yagoda's government. The boy spouted words he probably didn't even understand, yet Vadim couldn't help but feel somewhat proud at how his son seemed passionate about the nation's affairs.\n\nThis particular memory came to mind, as walking out of church on a Sunday, Vadim was greeted by one of the Fascist Party's blackshirts, a distinctive, well groomed and well-spoken man who, after some small talk, and conversation about the service, offered Vadim a small book.\n\nHe felt obligated to accept - after all, the man asked him to 'Do his part for the salvation of Russia!' Vadim felt the man was genuine - after all, he had attended the service with him. Men of godly values were ones he felt he could trust. Once he returned home, Vadim settled down to read the book 'For God and Russia,' it was called.\n\nNo harm in learning more about the boss, Vadim thought to himself. He opened the book and began pouring over the pages, finding there was much in it to ponder over."
AMR.smuta.3.a: ""Y'know, he makes some good points!""

AMR.smuta.4.t: "Time's Up"
AMR.smuta.4.desc: ""Shit!" Tatiana exclaimed as she hastily tried to stop the spillage of milk over the counter. She couldn't stop herself from jittering. Her eyes were always darting to the window and back to the slightly out-of-place floorboards where she stored her most prized and ideologically non-compliant possessions.\n\nShe only had to hold on for a few more days and scourge up just a few more rubles. Then she could be slipped across the border to Manchukuo and never need to fear the RFP again. Knowing that she only had to lay low for a few more days brought some peace to Tatiana. She tried breathing slowly as she sat down to consume the flavorless mush she called 'porridge.' Finally, there was a moment of calm.\n\nTatiana was rudely pulled back into reality as the sounds of wood splintering alerted her to the six blackshirts entering her home. She tried escaping through the window, but was grabbed by the ankle before she could get anywhere. "Get up Jew!" The men shouted as they pulled her back to her feet, and paraded her onto the street. "You fucking spies think you can get away with anything," one of them muttered.\n\nThe events of the past weeks flashed through Tatiana's mind as she tried to recall how they could've discovered her heritage. Had the Fascists found a trove of government records? Did someone overhear her conversations? Then it dawned on her that one of her friends had almost certainly turned her in.\n\nTatiana didn't know whether to feel betrayed. After all - appeasing the blackshirts was a matter of survival - would she not do the same if it saved her skin? It was useless to ponder, as tears started pouring down her face, she knew that she might never live to see the outside again."
AMR.smuta.4.a: "Trust dies, but mistrust blossoms."

AMR.smuta.5.t: "Russia's Ascension"
AMR.smuta.5.desc: "Rodzaevsky's chest swelled with pride as he gazed upon the columns of soldiers in front of him, still as statues despite being battered by icy winds. They hung on every word he said, awaited his orders without complaint, and it felt glorious.\n\n"Russians! We are in the midst of another Time of Troubles, caused by the Judeo-Bolshevik menace who still lurks amidst us." Rodzaevsky declared. "They continue to corrupt the soul of our nation and its people. The German occupation of the heartland has served as a trial to weed out the weakest who burden us, one which we will emerge from as a stronger nation."\n\nHe raised a finger, his voice booming over the fields. "No more will the godless communist, liberal or Jew undermine us. Only through complete commitment to God, to nation and to your Vozhd can Russia free itself from the pits of degeneracy! You, our brave soldiers, will be the vanguard of which to propagate these values. You will be seen as heroes for centuries to come! Let us end this Time of Troubles - Today, we march for the Motherland!\n\n"Uraaaaa!" The soldiers shouted, a roar that echoed for several seconds, as they saluted Rodzaevsky. He basked in the sound, filled with the pride of what he had built, and what he had and would accomplish. Without him, these hooligans would be shapeless and directionless. He had given them a purpose - one which will see himself, and only himself, guiding Russia to greatness."
AMR.smuta.5.a: "If only he knew what they said when his back was turned."

AMR.smuta.6.t: "For God, For Russia, For You"
AMR.smuta.6.desc: "Rodzaevsky's eyes darted around the crowd, looking at anything out of the ordinary. Nothing seemed amiss for now - the blackshirts surrounding him and the perimeter of the rally made sure of that. The crowd around gazed at him with admiration and pride. Sure it was vetted to only hold the most dedicated of fascist party members. Nonetheless, he felt great satisfaction in seemingly ordinary people's dedication for himself and the fascist cause.\n\nRodzaevsky made an effort to compose himself for this appearance, not drinking excessively the night before and, shaving enough not to look entirely disheveled. Something that would look good for the cameras, at least. He personally shook the hands of several party members, rewarding them with 'Citizen Awards' for turning in dissidents and recruiting members, as well as announcing various promotions.\n\nHe took his place at a podium, continuing his speech, personally thanking all members of the Fascist Party for their service, working to strike a balance between glorifying him - and glorifying them. He told them they were the warriors who would lead Russia into the future, guided by his wisdom. That together, they would bring every real Russian the prosperity they deserve.\n\n"That is what we fight for! For God! For the Nation! For Labor! And for all of you here today!" The crowd burst into applause, and a smile appeared on Rodzaevsky's face. His words radiated through Siberia on the few televisions that picked up on the signal, and the radios across the Far East.\n\nAnd across the lands outside Amur, those who managed to listen, had a far different reaction to the cheering crowds before the Vozhd. However, such reactions meant nothing. All he heard were the cheers, and people shouting his name."
AMR.smuta.6.a: "I think that went pretty well!"

AMR.smuta.7.t: "The Grandest of Conspiracies"
AMR.smuta.7.desc: "Raisa watched as Papa switched on the television, the tiny black and white image blown up by the circular pane of magnifying glass. The screen flickered to life, eerie light illuminating their apartment and casting long shadows on the wall. "-and you swear under pain of death that everything you say is true?" The well-dressed man in glasses asked, standing behind the podium. Another man sat in a chair in front of him. Despite the grainy image, Raisa could still see the pain and sadness etched across his face.\n\n"I swear," the man replied, not looking up from the floor. He was slumped over like Papa after a day's work and a night's drinking. "My name is Isak Brodsky and I am part of an international Jewish plot to destroy Russia and Christendom." His words were slurred, consonants running into each other. "I was to infiltrate Amur as a tutor of goyim children and teach them atheism and liberalism. I was to aid my Jewish brothers in establishing a network of usury to devalue the currency of Amur and enslave it to the almighty shekel." The prisoner sighed, a shaky, unsteady breath. "I was to kill any goyim children who would not convert to atheism and anyone else who discovered my true nature." His head down, body empty of defiance, the prisoner nodded slowly. "I killed the Christian girl Asya Smirnova and used her blood to make matzo for my Zionist brothers."\n\n"I have heard enough," said the spectacled interrogator. "In the name of God and the Vozhd, I sentence you to death. May God have mercy on your putrid soul."\n\n"Raisa," began Papa, his face grave, "we do not live in a safe world. There are people out there who want to hurt you. If they could, they would make you their slave, and if they couldn't, they'd kill you. The Vozhd is making the world a safer place, and one day, the Jews won't be able to threaten us anymore." Raisa settled into her father's arms under the glare of the Vozhd's portrait. She felt safe."
AMR.smuta.7.a: "By defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord."

AMR.smuta.8.t: "Work Sets You Free"
AMR.smuta.8.desc: "Tarasov walked along the line of ragged men, naked contempt etched on his features. He didn't want to read the orders handed down to him, let alone implement them. These scum were fit only for labor, but orders were orders.\n\nAs the chill wind whipped around the assembled men, biting at their exposed flesh, Tarasov began. "Listen up! The Vozhd has decreed the following: any prisoner who completes their quota consistently, for a period of a year will be released as free men, for their debt to society has been repaid."\n\nA buzz of excited murmuring swept through the crowd, but Tarasov silenced them with a sweep of his hand. What would these reprobates do with freedom? He idly wondered. Surely they would return to terrorize the streets of Amur only to return to his care. Still, he had to find some assurance that the Vozhd had taken such concerns into account.\n\n"Work hard, and you may one day see the outside of the wire again," he finished. "Fail the Vozhd, and die here. It's that simple, scum. Dismissed." As the guards herded the prisoners back to their workplaces, Tarasov returned to his office and closed the door behind him.\n\nWhat a waste, he thought. He was always in need of workers, and slave labor had provided the required muscle thus far. Tarasov paused, deep in thought, as something occurred to him. The decree had been clear enough, but this was still his camp.\n\nHe took to his typewriter, clacking out the latest in his series of wildly unpopular labor policies. The quota would remain the same, but divided in such a way that each slave would be burdened with more work. Satisfied, he prepared the memo for distribution. The Vozhd may have made his decree, but this was still his camp."
AMR.smuta.8.a: "Freedom's carrot and necessity's stick."

AMR.smuta.9.t: "One in One Thousand"
AMR.smuta.9.desc: "Mitya listened in disbelief as the warden read, with some obvious hesitation and disdain, the proclamation from the Vozhd. "Work hard, and you may one day see the outside of the wire again," he finished. "Fail the Vozhd, and die here. It's that simple, scum. Get back to work, and dismissed."\n\nFiling away with the rest of the prisoners, Mitya could scarcely believe what he had just heard. When he had been arrested by Rodzaevsky's minions for his pro-democracy views, he never imagined he might one day see the outside of the wire again.\n\nNow, in an uncharacteristic spasm of mercy, the Vozhd was offering Mitya his freedom - or at least a path to it. Of course, Mitya hated the man and his Nazi ilk, but a chance at freedom was not to be scoffed at, no matter who was offering it.\n\nAs he swung his pick against the stubborn stone, Mitya was a man possessed. Focused on his goal, the democratic agitator became a machine. Swing, strike, lift. All that mattered was filling quota and the promise of life outside.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mitya collapsed into sleep, his dreams filled with images of open fields and warm breezes. It did not matter that only a few would actually achieve this promised freedom - he would be one of those who earned it.\n\nEach day, new slaves arrived, pulled from their beds or off the street. The camp was swelling in size, and Mitya wondered how many would die here. In his heart, Mitya promised himself that he would not be among them."
AMR.smuta.9.a: "Work will set you free."

AMR.smuta.10.t: "Numbers"
AMR.smuta.10.desc: ""...and that brings us to the end of our tour." The warden adjusted his cap, pulling it down, and bowed slightly. "I hope it is up to your standards."\n\nRodzaevsky took some time to think. He had expected this day to be completely ordinary, but what he found today was something rather remarkable. They - the ministers and him - were all at one of the largest labor camps in the town, one that had hundreds of people toiling away to produce gloves for the Army.\n\nA glove from the newest batch was in his hand at that very moment. In his hands it felt sturdy and solid: he wouldn't have guessed it was made from a camp at all.\n\n"You have done a good job here," the Vozhd said. "Your camp is efficient: it is because you treat the captives without mercy, as it should be."\n\nThe warden relaxed, but Rodzaevsky wasn't finished. "One important question. Your workers are tired, starved, weak. I've seen their faces - this group won't last much longer. How will you keep this operation going?"\n\n"Of course. I can assure you, sir, that there will be no issue with finding new workers. There are still many enemy soldiers and spies, after all."\n\nThe Vozhd was satisfied with that answer, nodding at the warden. "Don't hold back on them," he said."
AMR.smuta.10.a: ""If they must be worked to death to bring forth a new Russia - that is a price I will happily pay tenfold.""

AMR.smuta.11.t: "To Him, They Look. To Him, They Cheer"
AMR.smuta.11.desc: "From his balcony, Rodzaevsky looked upon the city of Harbin. A long time ago, the RFP was just a marginal organization in this very same city. But times changed. Now the Fascist Party stands as the sole overlord of the Russian Far East, with Rodzaevsky as the Vozhd of this new National Socialist hegemon. However, the rebirth of Russia has not ended. The godless degenerates in the West remain, and the nation's reunification will surely be a bloody ordeal. But for now, the Far East is enough.\n\nThe image of the Vozhd himself, once regarded as nothing more than a fascist joke, a sad reminder of the distortion of Russia itself, had also improved. People now looked to him as a guide, leading the nation into a new era. Thousands of men and women stood when he gave speeches, listening attentively and cheering. Posters were plastered on the walls of Magadan and Chita, representing Rodzaevsky as the great man sent by God to save Russia. He now had a mission, and people looked up to him. This thought alone made Rodzaevsky smile.\n\nThen, he felt something snuggle against his leg. It was his greatest admirer. Taking the feline into his arms, he petted Mura on the head, who started to purr gently. Amused by the curious animal, he brought her inside. The Vozhd had already begun planning his glorious reclamation, but Rodzaevsky was, for now, satisfied with the Far East under his iron fist."
AMR.smuta.11.a: "A farce no longer."
