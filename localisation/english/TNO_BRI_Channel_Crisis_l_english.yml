 USA_Channel_Crisis_buildup_desc: "What was once thought of as a faint hope has become a paradigm- shifting reality - Britannia, our old friend has come back to life, seeking to stand with the free world once more. But how Germany will emerge from the flames that still engulf Europe is a mystery, and with the Isles' status as the Pakt's Atlantic gateway any move could turn ugly fast. While we can only hold our breath for now, we have to be ready for whatever happens next."
 GER_Channel_Crisis_buildup_desc: "As if the problems in Africa and the east weren't bad enough, our hold over Great Britain has completely collapsed. A heinous group of Judeo-Bolshevik gangsters have toppled the government and seized the strategically vital bulwark, and with it our seaways into the ocean. No one knows for sure what they'll do next; there is no letting this happen. It is a shame we cannot respond yet with the Heer paralyzed, but we will prepare. It's only a matter of time."

Regardless of if this was the best course to take, we are now locked in a dangerous standoff admist growing unease in the White House. We cannot falter at this hour; a corner of the world that has finally witnessed dawn after a long night risks being plunged back into darkness. If we aren't careful, stopping it could plunge the globe into an even darker abyss."
 GER_Channel_Crisis_confrontation_desc: "The American puppetmasters behind the marauders in Britain have shown their true colors, and in a brazen act of insanity is now using the threat of annihilation to stop us from restoring order. They will regret ever doing so when we show that the might of the continent is not to be trifled with. Still, we must recognize that the situation is now highly dangerous. If attempts to force their retreat fail, we may have to resort to coercing as much as we can out of them..."

 CC_info_tt: "§WAs another nation yearns for its freedom, the §YChannel Crisis§! has become the latest flashpoint of the rapidly heating §YCold War§!. Both sides have strong reasons not to let §BGreat Britain§! stay in the hands of the other, and it is their ability to skillfully master brinkmanship that will decide its, and even §fEurope§! itself's ultimate fate.\n\nEach side's §OReadiness§! forms the primary element of the crisis. §OReadiness§! is the measure of each side's willingness and capability to defend their interests and stand their ground. Towards §Y100%§!, it means they will never yield to aggression; should it reach §Y0%§!, they will §Pblink§!, retreating with cold feet over the possibility of §xnuclear war§!.\n\nOnly our own side's §OReadiness§! is always known to us. Our opponent's §OReadiness§! is kept secret behind the Cold War's §Lfog-of-war§!. This is represented by §jUncertainty§! on our opponent's §OReadiness§! bar, an area where their last estimated §OReadiness§! could be. Decisions can steadily §juncover§! it.\n\nBoth sides must try to raise their §OReadiness§! as high as possible, and should things come to a head they must also try to lower their opponent's §OReadiness§! as much as possible. Certain decisions are more effective depending on what our opponent's §OReadiness§! is. Above §Y80%§! lies the §xRed Zone§!, in here, we can rest assured that we will never back down. §xThe same goes for the enemy§!.\n\nThere are many ways to end the crisis. When the time is right, §KNegotiations§! can be opened, and will end the crisis immediately if successful. But beware, for just how much your opponent is willing to concede is dependent on their §OReadiness§!, and terms will inevitably mean neither side gets everything they want. We can also take the approach of forcing our hated opponent to §Pblink§! by reducing their §OReadiness§! to §Y0%§!, and get everything we want out of the situation - if we can handle the higher risk.\n\nBut this cannot go on forever. At some point into the crisis, the timer will start ticking, and once §YBreaking Point§! is reached, the side with the lowest §OReadiness§! will §Pback down§! as if their §OReadiness§! hit §Yzero§!.\n§RThat is, unless we are §xboth§! stuck in the §xRed Zone...§!§!§!"

 channelcrisis.1.a: "why are you here?"

 channelcrisis.50.t: "A Victory and a Burden"
 channelcrisis.50.d: "Mr. Thompson hated the smell of nicotine, and though he'd long since become acclimated to its prevalence in the State Department, he refused to let even a single cigarette in any meeting he ran. Mr. Smith, the young teetotaller, did not mind; Mr. Doe, the old veteran, had to hold a pen between his fingers to simulate his stress relief. The news that brought them together was, to most people, a pleasant outcome - who could be unhappy about the liberation of Britain from fascism?\n\n"We can," said Mr. Thompson, who compulsively sipped from a coffee mug between sentences. "This is the biggest crisis in American foreign policy since the Aleutians."\n\n"With respect," said Mr. Smith, adjusting his glasses to better peer at the projected map of England, "isn't this the best possible outcome for us? The royalists love us, the leftists are closer to Progressives than Bolsheviks. Either way, we have a new valuable ally in Europe."\n\n"Oh yes, we'll win England. Except the Nazis..." Mr. Thompson sat down. Another, longer sip. "They'll see American-backed terrorists stealing a core vassal, one they cannot afford to lose under any circumstances. They'll respond with force, and any involvement from us they'll see as an act of war."\n\n"But Germany's still in utter chaos! If their troubles drag on any longer, they might collapse in a few months!"\n\nMr. Doe rose, staring at the projection. He brought his pen up to an unmarked spot in the highlands. "Willy," he whispered. "Landed with me in Glasgow, '44. Nazi bastard took off half his head with a sniper rifle. Thousands more along with him." He turned, picked up his case. "We maintain aid, we voice solidarity with the British. That is the least we can do, and I'll make it clear that we should be doing more...""
 channelcrisis.50.a: "...because this is worth gambling the world."
 channelcrisis.51.t: "A Relationship Most Special"
 channelcrisis.51.d: "If you were to ask Patrick Hemsworth what his opinion on international politics was, he'd tell you that he didn't really know. Patrick was busy, and he'd honestly rather be spending his rare free time out partying than focusing on politics. Which was how he'd ended up in the university cafeteria nursing a hangover headache and watching, ironically enough, international news to take his mind off it.\n\n'Our correspondents have confirmed a complete overthrow of the Pakt supported regime.' drawled the bespectacled man on the TV reading from his notes. 'The revolutionaries have proclaimed a provisional government, with the Reich Plenipotentiary having fled the country alongside the commander of the German Garrison.'\n\nHuh, thought Patrick. The idea of a free Britain existing was surreal to him, considering he'd been two the last time there'd been one. Throughout his life reminders of the status it once had still permeated everyone's understanding of the world, but it always felt more like a distant, fading legend. Until now.\n\n'We now go to a message broadcast straight from London itself.' continued the newsreader, with the broadcast suddenly changing from a newsroom to a city street, with the camera focused squarely on an old man smoking a pipe.\n\n'Thanks to the noble efforts of many brave men and women' he began, 'we Britons stand here today triumphant against want, fear, and tyranny. But the fight is far from through. Without support, we are alone against the pressures of oppression across the Channel. To our friends from across the Atlantic, from across the world, we urge you to stand with us to stem the tide of oppression.'\n\nPatrick was speechless. The man on the TV looked almost like his grandpa. It was one thing to know the Nazis were oppressing people far away, but seeing it from someone who looked just like him and spoke the same language as him was something else. What would happen if the President didn't do anything to help?"
 channelcrisis.51.a: "Finishing his breakfast, he resolved to pay attention to the news more often"
 channelcrisis.52.t: "Fourth Floor Diplomacy"
 channelcrisis.52.d: "Twenty years. That was how long it had been since David K. E. Bruce walked the streets of London. He had almost forgotten the fog and the cobblestones; stepping onto the tarmac at London Airport unlocked a million memories. Long nights with Frank Nelson, Colin Gubbins. Dreams of victory, dashed with his flight to Glasgow, to America. Defeated, humiliated. Now, at long last, redeemed.\n\nWell, not quite. He was on the fourth floor of the Macdonald House; an entire floor separate from the Canadian embassy, kept under lock and key by the CIA. One of their representatives was next to him, a man wearing a nebbish mask to hide the killer underneath. He said nothing, but wrote down everything. He was not what was important; the man in front of Bruce was, and the diplomat forced a smile as he waded his way through this ugly conversation.\n\n'You must understand, Mr. Knight, that I cannot promise the United States' full involvement at this juncture.' He dropped a cube of sugar into his tea, took a sip. 'Of course, we are committed to increasing our humanitarian aid, and Congress will pass a resolution voicing clear solidarity with the British people. But that is all we can offer right now.'\n\n'Mr. Bruce, I appreciate all that you've done so far.' Maxwell Knight had not touched his own tea since pouring it. 'But the Jerries are already planning to cross the Channel and slaughter us all. If we're going to survive, we need a guarantee of security from the OFN.'\n\nPrecisely, thought Bruce. You need us, and God, we want to help. And there were plans, both in his State Department and the meddlers over at Defense. But so many plans had been drafted, discussed, torn up and redone. All of them ran into the same problem, neatly summarised by a drunken Defense staffer all the way back in New York: 'if Germany rolls in, it's all fucking over for both of us.'"
 channelcrisis.52.a: "Bruce wished he could do more, but another Sealion, another war, haunted them all."
 channelcrisis.53.t: "The National Security Aviary"
 channelcrisis.53.d: "As the National Security Council convened in the Situation Room, the President felt like he was in an aviary. Hawks and doves flew around [USA.GetLeader]; squawking, singing. Laid out on the table was a map of Western Europe. To the north, a liberated and nervous England. South of it, a growing German force, a sword on a coiled spring.\n\nA hawk perched over his shoulder; "It's all bluster, Mr. President." He jabbed his sharp finger at the southern coastline. "Germany's military organisation is shot. High command is still bickering with each other even after the power struggle, and it's bleeding morale at all levels. They still have to deal with their colonies and their politics are in disarray. To speak candidly: They can't do shit right now. Send a few vessels into the Channel, and they'll back down."\n\nA dove flew around the President, sat down next to him. "Sir, Germany still considers England its backyard. To them, this is a jumped-up rebellion that got lucky. They'll never accept any escalation on our end - we'll turn this from an internal conflict to an external one."\n\nAnother hawk's finger flew onto the map, pointing directly at London. "Besides the fact that we finally have a chance to break into Europe, do you know how it would look if we abandon not just OFN-friendly fighters but a country we share cultural roots with? What happens when all our potential allies decide they're better off going it alone - or worse, with the Sphere?"\n\nThe bickering reached a crescendo; overlapping statements, orders, insults. "We have to help them!" "You'd risk a war!" "Then fuck it, let's just declare war!"\n\n"Enough!" called out [USA.GetLeader]. He folded his hands together, fingers digging into the skin. London's future - celebrations or fire, heaven or hell - was in his hands."
 channelcrisis.53.a: "Send them in."
 channelcrisis.54.t: "Rising Tensions, Rising Commitments"
 channelcrisis.54.d: ""Fuck" was the first word out of President [USA.GetLeader]'s mouth when he received the news. Just as the doves predicted, singing condemnations from their nest of olive branches, the Reich had doubled their efforts to snuff out freedom in England. Troop deployments in their Western districts, naval maneuvers, a hundred damning reports from the CIA's European office; all of it suggested that the Germans would not give up easily.\n\nHe needed a moment to think for himself, away from his aides and cabinet. When they left, he stared out into the Rose Garden, where a passing tour group walked between the hedges, oblivious to the turmoil inside the West Wing. He made the decision to escalate, to send ships into the Channel, and he did not regret it. He would have been a fool, a coward and a traitor to deny himself this one chance to light a torch of freedom in the European umbra.\n\nBut though Free Britain had lit a torch in that darkness, it was such a faint little light. If the shadows were to be forever kept away, they needed the OFN's torch. For the British, it was such a simple decision: the OFN should commit themselves totally to the defence of their isles. [USA.GetLeader] was cursed to see it a different way: to see the devastation an American escalation might bring if they failed to repel the Germans.\n\nA thought crossed his mind: perhaps words might work better here. Sit down with the Germans, figure out what price they might pay for the liberation of Great Britain. Surely they'll talk now. He felt like a traitor just thinking about it - yet treason felt like a lesser crime than the title history might bestow on him if this crisis got out of his hands.\n\nHe walked to the door and opened it, where his inner circle waited like children who heard the family car pull into the garage. They all looked at him with confusion, eagerness, and the most quiet pity a President might ever receive."
 channelcrisis.54.a: ""Come in, gentlemen. Let's talk next steps.""

 channelcrisis.60.t: "Report on the Emergency in Great Britain"
 channelcrisis.60.d: "OBERKOMMANDO DER WEHRMACHT\nAMT AUSLANDS UND ABWEHR ABT. III - F\nSTRENG GEHEIM\n[GetDateText]\n\nVeesenmayer has confirmed it - there is no longer any German or government presence within Britain. The island is lost, and is in the hands of the insurgents.\n\nMost senior figures within the British government have been confirmed as dead or captured, including the Prime Minister and the King, and the bandits have proclaimed their own 'provisional authority'. We do not know for certain how they will proceed next externally but their leadership is clearly and openly pro-OFN - comprised of a dangerous mixture of both leftists and sympathisers of the Ottawa exiles. This situation is unacceptable and presents a catastrophic threat to Pakt security. Not only does our continent face the risk of intrusion by our greatest enemies, they would then control our only secure seaway into the Atlantic. This must be prevented by any means necessary.\n\nUnfortunately, with the Wehrmacht in disarray due to the ongoing internal situation, we cannot respond as quickly or as effectively as we would wish. Compunding this issue is the present emergency in the Reichskommissariats that has formations actually in an acceptable state stretched thin. Nevertheless, it is only a matter of time. We must do everything within our power in preparation for the inevitable re-invasion, and ensure our Western security is restored.

 channelcrisis.62.d: "Within the network of command posts and tunnels buried deep beneath Germania, panic rippled through the air like electricity. Ever since reports on the successful English rebellion revealed their attempts to court OFN protection, and when other reports suggested that the Americans were now responding to these overtures, Wehrmacht high command was a flurry of activity.\n\n"It's the beginning of the end," said Ferdinand Schörner to a gathering of generals, draped in shadow with a large backlit map of the world behind him. "An American plot to finally launch an invasion directly on our shores, starting with the securing of this base to do so. We must act swiftly, decisively. Full mobilisation. Crush them now before it's too late."\n\n"With respect, Feldmarschall," said Hans Speidel, back straight and hands folded on the conference table, "our troops are presently incapable of an invasion on such short notice. We are still recovering from our own trials - and need I remind you, Schörner, that the east is still on fire."\n\n"Fuck the east," he hissed. "Slavs and Poles with hand-me-down rifles aren't of any use to the Americans. England is. If we allow them to win here, we'll be letting the OFN keep a dagger at our heart."\n\nSpiedel did not counter, but instead stared at the map. Beneath the stoic mask, ripples of dread flashed in his eyes. Despite the concerns, he silently conceded that this was a nightmare. Seeing his quiet approval, subordinates suddenly rushed Schörner with their own plans and orders for the immediate transfer of troops to meet this threat. He signed them all.\n\n"I want every available unit," he said, shoving the signed orders into his adjutants' hands. "Everyone not immediately preoccupied with the east or Africa must make their way to a western district base, pending further orders.""

 channelcrisis.63.d: "OBERKOMMANDO DER WEHRMACHT\nAMT AUSLANDS UND ABWEHR ABT. III - F\nSTRENG GEHEIM\n[GetDateText]\n\nEMERGENCY - The Americans have gone mad. In an outrageous act of aggression they have announced the deployment of naval and other military assets into British territorial waters in the Channel, officially at the 'request' of the Judeo-Bolshevik insurgents to 'peacekeep'. Reconnaissance has indeed confirmed a significant number of U.S. warships present around Southern England in positions that make invasion impossible without encountering them.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a blatant attempt to dissuade us and it is clear their next move now involves full OFN membership for Britain. We suspect this is a reckless bluff spurred on by irresponsible warmongers within Washington without a genuine commitment. They know full well what a hot war would lead to. Our Europe will be defended. Invasion preparations will continue and the American degenerates will cave when they realise this fact.\n\nUnfortunately though, this fact also hangs clearly over our own heads.

 channelcrisis.90.d: ""...while recognising the right for the English to have their concerns addressed, the Empire of Japan denounces the irresponsible conduct of both the OFN and the Einheitspakt in this ongoing issue. We urge for calm, caution and a measured response to the situation-"\n\nThe assistant pressed STOP on the tape player, and the tape's subject, [JAP.GetLeader], waved him away. He shut the door behind him, leaving behind a meeting borne of panic. Laid onto the table was a map of the English Channel, with estimated troop deployments drawn on both coastlines. Somewhere in the middle was another, more fluid boundary, with American and German ships on either side. It was a battle for the soul of England, and Japan could do nothing but watch.\n\n"What news from Europe?" asked the Prime Minister, turning to the head of the DTS.\n\n"Troops are ready to invade Great Britain, and the Kriegsmarine is on high alert in the Channel itself. They're mobilising, in large numbers despite their recent follies."\n\n"What follows," said the Minister for Foreign Affairs, "are displays of power and force, meant to cow the other side into recognising their claim over England. It's a prize worth fighting for in their eyes: the OFN want entry into Europe and to defend their kin, and the Pakt cannot afford to lose it lest their navy be cut off from the ocean."\n\n"And if they go to war over it, we'll be dragged into their mess." The Prime Minister ran his fingers along the edge of the table. To the Ministers for the Army and Navy next to him, he said: "Increase our state of readiness, but quietly." To the Minister for Foreign Affairs: "Continue to call for calm. Perhaps even offer to mediate - they won't accept it, but it'll make us look reasonable." And to the man from the DTS: "Ensure that our assets keep a close eye on this.""
 channelcrisis.90.a: ""Until then," said [JAP.GetLeader]. "all we can do is wait and watch.""
 channelcrisis.91.t: "Peace Returned"
 channelcrisis.91.d: "The news reached the Prime Minister in the afternoon, and upon hearing it he felt as if a great weight was lifted from him. German ships withdrew from the English Channel, and the Americans docked into London's ports as liberators. [ENG.GetNameDefCap] was now an OFN ally and their anchor in Europe. More importantly, it meant that the Channel Crisis was over, and the threat of another World War was over - or perhaps deferred was the more accurate word.\n\nBecause there was always something else, wasn't there? From a western window, [JAP.GetLeader] watched the sun fall below the horizon with a glass of sake in his hand. The sun always sets, and it's always back the next day. One crisis ends, but there's always another, ready to emerge.\n\nSomewhere, crawling in the back of his skull, there was a creeping awareness of what the next crisis would be. It would be closer to home, and it would involve the Americans. They would be drunk on victory now, waving their torch of freedom as it set fire to everything around it. The Sphere felt its fires twice before, in Malaya and the Philippines; and do these things not come in threes? His thoughts turned to a southern brother in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and he made a mental note to speak with his cabinet on the matter.\n\nThe Prime Minister took consolation in the fact that they had survived this crisis. Cooler heads had prevailed, and spears did not fall upon the world like rain. As for the outcome - well, had England ever been a great factor in Japan's foreign policy since 1945? Its secondary effects, the ripples cast by such a large rock dropped into the water, was what mattered, and [JAP.GetLeader] had a busy day of meetings tomorrow to address it all. He smiled, finished off his sake. The rest of his work could wait until he was ready for it. He took his briefcase and turned off the lights on his way out."
 channelcrisis.91.a: "[JAP.GetLeader] wondered if anyone truly knew how close they were to destruction."
 channelcrisis.92.t: "Order Restored"
 channelcrisis.92.d: "In truth, [JAP.GetLeader] thought that it did not matter too much who won England. When the news reached his desk that the Americans backed down and left the Channel, leaving England to another German invasion, the Prime Minister felt nothing but relief that the Channel Crisis was over. There would be a statement, a condemnation of Germany's overzealous security practices - but that would be boilerplate.\n\nThe news came towards the end of the day, and the Prime Minister stayed behind a few hours to react to the situation, mostly by delegating that reaction to others. Comms drafts were approved, a rapidly-organised interview was organised with NHK Radio 1, and emergency meetings were scheduled for the following morning. When the last paper was signed, it was past nine, and only a few pin-pricks of light in the black sky broke through the city lights. [JAP.GetLeader] had about an hour to himself before he had to get some sleep. Tomorrow would be a busier day with this news.\n\nHe spent that hour pouring and drinking a glass of sake, staring out through his office window towards the stars. Nothing had changed: England was always out of Japan's reach, and Germany's invasion brought things back to a familiar status quo. They still had their foothold in the south, one they would continue to court. But as he poured a second glass, he thought more of America than Germany. Americans rarely took humiliation well, and there was a growing fear in his heart that losing England would cause their eyes to turn to them. They would find some weak link in the Sphere and pursue that to console themselves. He suspected he knew where that weak link was: south, with their OFN neighbours below them.\n\nHe finished off the second glass and set it on the table. Ten o'clock, and his first meeting was at five. [JAP.GetLeader] walked to his bedroom, ready to hit the pillow and steal whatever sleep he could."
 channelcrisis.92.a: "At least the skies would not rain fire over something he was not involved in."

With a third and final click, the President shut off the television and began to rub his face in frustration. He let out a weary sigh.\n\n"Give me some time alone." After some shuffling of papers, and the shuffling of aides out the door to the oval office, the President finally was alone. Walking over to a decanter of whiskey near his desk, he uncorked the bottle and began to pour.\n\nThis could be all he was known for, he knew. It didn't matter what he did, or how he changed America. There was a very real chance that [USA.GetLeader] would solely go down in history as the President who'd taken the gateway to Europe and let the Nazis stomp all over it. He'd done it for a reason, he'd seen how close the world had come while teetering on the edge of the abyss. The public wouldn't see it that way though, and neither would the rest of the OFN.\n\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand had been muted with their condemnation, and "expressed their disappointment". Macmillan, the Prime Minister in exile, had torn into him, denouncing him on radio and television alike, in an interview that had probably been broadcast over and over across America by now."

 channelcrisis.101.d: "Britain, fucking Britain of all places. Josef remembered one time where he and the rest of his friends in the 53rd Luftlandebrigade had played cards and joked about where they'd be deployed first. Some of them had guessed the East, to go kill some bandits, Friedrich figured it'd be Africa. Not a single one of them had guessed Britain, but then again, that had been before the British Isles had exploded into chaos for a second time. And here they all were now, bunkering in an airfield along the Lower Rhine, just waiting for the signal to parachute into a British airbridge and unleash hell. Suddenly, the door to the bunks swung open, followed by barked orders from a voice he couldn't fully hear all the way across the bunk. Josef squinted at the bright light, leaning over to Friedrich.\n\n"What's going on? Are we moving out?"\n\nFriedrich grinned. It was a vindictive grin, without a hint of humor. "Looks like the Americans ran away. Time for some payback." He'd had a brother in the Britain garrison, Josef remembered. He nodded, pulling together his kit.\n\nNo less than thirty minutes later they were almost already airborne, slowly filing into the plane one by one. Josef gave a final look at the airfield behind him, and the faint sunrise creeping over the horizon. How long would it be before he got another peaceful view like this, in the hellhole that England was about to become? He could be in Britain for months or even years, for all he knew.\n\n"Come on, keep moving!" complained one of the other paratroopers behind him. Josef rolled his eyes and stepped onto the plane, his doubts gnawing at him. Still, he'd signed up to protect his Vaterland. Time to actually do it."
 channelcrisis.101.a: "The Fatherland commands, and its sons nod obediently."

 channelcrisis.110.t: "A Good Deal"
 channelcrisis.110.d: ""Mr. Doe?" asked Mr. Smith, who announced his presence by rapping his knuckles on the office door. Doe looked up from his pile of documents: diplomatic cables and reports, lit up by the warmth of a desk lamp. "The boys wanted to know if you're joining us for drinks."\n\n"Hmm? No, I'm alright, thank you." His head went back to the desk, and he signed another report. "Plenty to do before the night's out."\n\n"Come on, that can wait." Smith sat down at Doe's desk. "Meanwhile, we've got a party going on to celebrate England, and you're stuck inside... doing God knows what. Come on, Jack," rising up, "live a little."\n\n"I appreciate it, Mr. Smith, but I still have a lot left to do. I'll join you later, I just need to wrap things up here."\n\nMr. Smith shrugged, telling himself that he at least tried, and walked back into the light. Mr. Doe put his head back down. Another congratulations from the State Department, another heartfelt thanks from a British ministry. The negotiations had gone well for America and Britain; Germany walked away with few concessions and Britain was now free from the fear of another Sealion.\n\nIn truth, there was a part of Doe that never would have wanted to cut a deal. That part of him had bled on the Scottish highlands, seen hundreds of comrades die to vainly defend. When he advised the president to make the deal, he saw those comrades with bloodied faces and eight-ball eyes. They asked him why he chose to talk rather than fight. But they no longer had any sway over him; with nothing but a pen, he and his new comrades had kept Germany at bay."
 channelcrisis.110.a: "He told the dead that, if there had been no deal, the next war would have left no corpses."
 channelcrisis.111.t: "Signing Away England"
 channelcrisis.111.d: ""Well, that's it," said Hans Speidel, turning his head to the map of the world on the wall. All eyes in the war room turned to the map, and the British Isles on it, forever coloured with the same brush as the Americans across the Atlantic. "The Foreign Ministry contacted me an hour ago to inform us that southern England will be demilitarised. What's done is done, and now we need to-"\n\nSomeone slammed their fist on the table, the impact echoing. "Damn it all!" Ferdinand Schörner's fist clenched so tight that were it not for his gloves his nails would have drawn blood. "What the hell were they thinking? How much did they give away just so we can avoid a little war?"\n\n"Feldmarschall Schörner, not all is lost. The Americans were forced to recognise some concessions, and-"\n\n"Not nearly enough. You know who one of their leaders is? That Joseph runt, one of those English Conservatives? A Jew." He threw the word out with such acid that it could have burned the table he spat on. "Imagine it. A fucking Jew, commanding European territory."\n\nA confused, awed hush settled over the war room. "Worst of all," Schörner said, rising from his seat, "The OFN- God, the OFN" Speidel nodded, and a few of his lackeys followed suit. "These terms might as well just be a mere speed-bump to them. You tell me, Speidel, was that worth avoiding a war?"\n\nThough unwilling to so openly agree with Schörner, Speidel found himself nodding. Across the Channel, a jubilant OFN waits and plots its next move, emboldened by that fact they satiated the master of Europe with only a mininum. The war room was a club for impotent men that night, and among the officers there Schörner was the most frustrated, the most vengeful. But all he could do was glare at the map of the world through beady little eyes."
 channelcrisis.111.a: "We should have nuked them."
 channelcrisis.112.t: "A Fair Deal"
 channelcrisis.112.d: ""I suppose it all worked out, didn't it?" asked Mr. Thompson as he sat next to Mr. Doe on the plane to London, currently stationary at Washington Airport. The older diplomat put down his magazine, and offered a wry smile Thompson could never read.\n\n"I suppose so. Britain is free, and that's what matters, is it not?"\n\nThe plane taxied down the runway, and Doe stared out the window. The plane rose, and he watched the lights of D.C. at night. He recalled the jubilation after seeing the new leaders of Britain announce on the TV, before a crowd of journalists exercising their new freedom of the press, that the OFN and Unity-Pakt had struck a deal regarding the fate of England. In exchange for recognising Britain as a member of the OFN, a few concessions were given to placate a Germany that reeled from their loss. The terms seemed agreeable enough to all parties involved, and both sides walked away quietly proud that they had avoided war.\n\nThe plane disappeared into the clouds above; everything around it was a black void, the window reflecting Doe's stoic face. When there were no more lights outside, he returned to his magazine. Thompson brought with him a book, but his eyes kept flicking to Doe.\n\n"Be honest," said Mr. Thompson after an interminable hour of silence, "you're not happy we went to the table at all, aren't you?"\n\nMr. Doe slowly put down the magazine, and took off his glasses. When he turned to Thompson, the younger man saw he was not in the plane, nor in [GetYear]. He was somewhere in the highlands, watching a dear friend gargle out blood with half his face blown off. He was in a command post, holding a knife to a German officer his superior demanded be brought in for questioning. He was at the negotiation table, seeing that same officer smile as Doe put forth another compromise."

 channelcrisis.113.d: "Once again, Wehrmacht high command gathered in the bunkers underneath Germania, awaiting further news. The large map on the world glowed white and red, a faint shadow of the Adler cast behind the landmasses. Hans Speidel watched Ferdinand Schörner pace his around his table, back and forth, bouncing off the rounded walls with impatience and inner tension. At last, the ringing of the red phone broke that tension; Speidel picked it up.\n\n"Good evening. Speidel speaking. Yes. Yes, he's here too.. Mmhmm." He started to scribble down the other side's words in a notebook. "Yes. Yes, understood. We'll send through the order now. Thank you." He hung up the phone and turned straight towards Schörner. "Foreign Ministry has confirmed they have struck a deal with the Americans and British."\n\n"They gave up Britain, didn't they? The fucking cowards."\n\n"Unfortunately, yes. The Americans weren't budging. Still," passing over the notebook, "we were able to extract concessions."\n\nSchörner snatched the notebook and read through the list. "This is what we sold the gateway of Europe for? Fucking baubles!" He threw the notebook back to Speidel, scoffed and paced back to his seat, teeth grit and eyes flicking between his papers and the British Isles on the big board.\n\n"Feldmarschall, it's not nothing." Speidel closed the notebook. "Considering the Americans' reluctance to even come to the table, we've taken a fair amount from them." He paused. "Enough to address many points of contention."\n\n"It's a humiliation, Speidel. I thought you were smart enough to recognise that." Schörner sighed. "General, send the orders down." He rose from his seat, collecting his peaked cap."

 channelcrisis.114.t: "A Raw Deal"
 channelcrisis.114.d: "On the TV screen in the corner of the room, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Smith could see the impromptu festivities. While the footage was purely visual, the raucous joy in the pub was probably the same: cheering, chanting, singing patriotic ballads. The news that brought them together was, to most people, a pleasant outcome - who could be unhappy about the guaranteed security of a free Britain from Germany?\n\n"We can," said Mr. Thompson, slamming back his third pint of the night, his fourth dripping with condensation in front of him. "Fucking Germans. Fucking, fuck those goddamn-"\n\n"Easy, Thompson," said Mr. Smith, nobly taking the untouched pint. "Twenty-four hours from now, this mess will only be a memory, and you can tell your wife how her folks can go back to England." Despite himself, doubt creeped into his voice. They had been advising the president on negotiating Britain's freedom, and in the process had issued concession after concession. What could have been an insurmountable wall to contain the Germans was now a knee-high hurdle. Second-hand news which had drifted through suggested that quite a few people on both sides of the Atlantic were not happy about how much the Germans had received, but the ultimate outcome of these talks kept those criticisms muted.\n\n"Doe was right," murmured Thompson. "Should've gone all the way. Death or dishonour." He held his aching head in his hands. "Fuck, we should've got more. What the fuck did we do?"\n\n"You'll feel better tomorrow," Smith said. He looked at the TV again: patriots holding aloft newspapers proclaiming safety, old veterans with their medals gleaming in the lamplight, a young couple sharing an intimate kiss in a shop front doorway. Even if Thompson hated himself for giving too much away, Smith thought this sight made it all worth it. Britain was freed twice now: first from their own fascist government, then from the fascist empire across the Channel."

He grabbed a pen and a notebook, and scribbled down what the other side was saying. "Right. Mm. What? They gave that away?" Excited hands blurred the letters together. "OK. Understood, I'll issue the order." He put the phone down and let out a scoff.\n\n"News from the Foreign Ministry?" asked Hans Speidel, seated around the war room table, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"Speidel, we should have invaded. Fucking Americans wouldn't have done anything about it." He flicked over the notebook to his subordinate, who adjusted his glasses and read through the list. His eyes widened the more he read.\n\n"That's... quite a list of concessions from them." He looked up from the notebook. "Far more than I expected."\n\n"They were weaker than we thought. We could have crushed them into submission, if these paper-pushers didn't get in our way."\n\n"Either way, this is still a good outcome. They've been forced to bargain with us for England. At least we don't look weak." Speidel shrugged. "Whatever the case, we can refocus our efforts to the east."\n\n"Yes," said Schörner. "The Slavs are still a problem. Africans, too." He scoffed again, leaning back in his chair. "Send the order to withdraw our ships, per the agreement. Have the Kriegsmarine play Erika for the Americans on the way out, they'll hate that.

Additional intelligence reports confirm that Heer divisions have disengaged from their western buildup and appear to be moving east, most likely to reinforce weakening German control there.\n\nAs of now, the formation of a pro-OFN government in Britain is effectively certain. Files on all major resistance figures and returning exile politicians have been attached in pages no. 3 through 10, but British anti-German sentiment ensures the presence of a cooperative government for the foreseeable future.\n\nDetails regarding the concessions which were provided to the Germans can be found detailed in pages no. 11 through 13. Political blowback within the Reich is still expected to occur, but to a mitigated degree, and the Reich is expected to retain its dominant presence within Western Europe.\n\nOur success in Britain has also emboldened support from a number of OFN members, former commonwealth nations in particular, who have pledged fresh contributions. Domestic public support for the Channel intervention has also become near unanimous since successful negotiations, and the public may prove supportive of further international interventions.\n\nDespite our success, the aforementioned concessions will include the establishment of a demilitarized zone in southern England and restrictions on stationing nuclear weapons in the British Isles. Despite this, the presence of a nation fully aligned with the free world within Europe will serve as a permanent crack in the Steel Curtain, repudating the perception of unbreakable German hegemony. While future German goals are still unpredictable, this outcome may be regarded as a crucial turning point for the OFN."

A couple, older than most of the crowd, waltzed in the streets, smiling as if they were the only ones in the entire city. A journalist for the Washington Post tried his best to capture the delirious mania of Britain with such a small, antiquated looking camera - mumbling to himself the New York Times had better cameras anyway.\n\nPart of Eugene wanted to join in, wanted to scratch the surface of what he felt, let something out. The other part knew that even standing by the sidelines and watching the English cry out in joy was enough. He took a Camel and a faded, brass lighter featuring a hand gripping a great torch of flame. His father was always so proud of his time in the 2nd Marine Division. Even after he had lost so many of his brothers at Guadalcanal, he would have followed his men to the end. He found it in Manchester.\n\nHe had never been to Britain. Those roadside pulp-novels of heroic, tragic fighting in London had always sold well growing up. There was always a strange pit in his stomach when he passed the comic store in downtown Chattanooga where he grew up. The war was heroic, our weapons mighty and our soldiers were hardy - and we still lost. Everyone in the neighbourhood knew someone who had lost someone during Eisenhower's last, futile gamble. If the mask of quiet, desperate stoicism slipped, even for a moment, it would never be able to be fitted back on. Not with the amount of coffins that came home. Not with those that didn't.\n\n"We'll Meet Again" was playing in the background, from the impromptu PA system that the collabs had put on for announcements. Eugene put his cigarette to the flame and put his foot up against the faded, brick wall. This was kinda an announcement, he silently chuckled. One of his fellow privates was gyrating his hips wildly in some attempt to introduce the local Lizzies and Bettys to something that he promised was very cool and very hip back in the states.

 channelcrisis.121.a: ""There will be no more weakness, gentlemen. Not now. Not ever.""
 channelcrisis.122.t: "A Great Humiliation"
 channelcrisis.122.d: "Von Schirach had seen Bormann in terrifying moods before; the ones where he fell quiet were always more terrifying than his screaming matches. Yet he had surpassed that quiet rage and into an all-consuming fire which burned anything and everything around him. Hewel and Burgdorf were in a room with him, and they looked like they wished they were somewhere far away.\n\n"You backed down, you fucking cowards!" He slammed his fist on the table hard enough that the papers around him bounced up. "We had a plan, and you didn't implement it! You let them take England! Right on our fucking doorstep! You couldn't even get one concession out of them!"\n\n"My Führer," said a sweating Hewel, "the Americans- they wouldn't see reason. We can spin it, you see. They're encroaching in on territory that isn't theirs-"\n\n"It was ours to defend," said Schirach, glad to be on this side of the table. "Which you both failed to do."\n\n"And now look where we are." Bormann sneered. "Our Kriegsmarine can no longer access the ocean without them peering into our every move, thanks to you. They're a fucking glorified riverboat service now!"\n\nHewel and Burgdorf looked at each other like humiliated schoolchildren before the headmaster. Schirach almost pitied them - but this wasn't some minor diplomatic struggle. This was a massive blow, and though nobody would say it out loud, they all thought it was the kind of event that goes down in the history books as the beginning of a decline.\n\n"I could have both of you shot. Just like that." Bormann's voice hit a low register that chilled the room. "But I don't want the rest of the continent looking at this like a licence to steal. I want you two to put down any rebellion that pops up, West or East. And listen carefully...""
 channelcrisis.122.a: ""...if you fuck up again, I'll pull the trigger myself.""

 channelcrisis.130.t: "Into the Abyss"
 channelcrisis.130.d: "For the American sailors aboard the vessels of the USS Saratoga Battle Group, the Kriegsmarine ships facing them in the channel seemed almost inhuman, great gray monoliths staring back at them from across the cold, black water. They sat there with an eerie silence, the only sounds audible on the Anglo-American side being those of the waves and the wind.\n\n"You think they're scared of us as we are of them?" asked one sailor, struggling to light a cigarette between strong gusts of wind. Another shrugged.\n\n"Couldn't fucking tell you Walt. I hope so though, maybe if they are it'll keep them on that side of the channel. Pass the light?" The first sailor held up a hand gesturing to wait, and made several more attempts to light his cigarette. Finally he succeeded and let out a laugh.\n\n"There we go! Finally, took you long-"\n\nHis words were cut off by a great boom and the horrendous sound of ripping metal. He stared in shock at one of the nearby ships engulfed in flames. Moments later an even louder boom followed and one of the German ships was burning as well. The two men frantically fled downwards, the sounds of death and a call over the loudspeaker for all hands following them.\n\n"They really did it." said the second sailor, breathing heavily. "They're really going to do it. War with the A-bomb."\n\nAbove them, war raged, the once dark surface of the channel illuminated by explosions, burning wreckage and muffled screams. Were one to watch this carnage from above, they might wonder whether there had been any other course. Had this been inevitable, the only consequence of a defiant mad dash for freedom? Or perhaps the Resistance had been right, and the German tyrants could have been pushed back, had things been just a little bit different. This question, like so many others, would go to the grave unanswered, for the world's path had already been chosen."
 channelcrisis.130.a: "War, fire and soon after, nothing but silence."
 channelcrisis.131.t: "Götterdämmerung"
 channelcrisis.131.d: "When the call had come through, the U-boat navigator had paled so much he might've resembled a ghost. Korvettenkapitän Hinze for his part, had kept his composure, pushed the frightened little man aside to grasp at the wall mounted phone and pressed it to his ear. The voice on the other side was tinny, but one he unmistakably recognised.\n\n"Korvettenkapitän Hinze", the voice began. "Can you hear me?" He nodded, before realizing the Admiral couldn't see him.\n\n"I can, Admiral. Korvettenkapitän Hinze standing by."\n\n"Good. I had hoped this would not be necessary, but the Americans have refused any compromise. In the face of such overwhelming aggression, the Führer has authorized us to secure the British Isles by any means necessary. You are to commence launch preparations, and fire when ready." The line went dead. Without a word, Hinze hung up the phone and turned back to the scared sailors now crowding the control room.\n\n"Prepare to fire."\n\nHe could see his weapons officer hesitating. "Sir-"\n\n"Do it!" he barked, causing the officer to scurry away. Hinze folded his arms behind his back, leaving his men behind him. The other sailors could be heard muttering and whispering to each other, discipline completely abandoned. Normally Hinze would chastise them for it, but what was the fucking point now? It would all be over soon. He thought of the rare days where he'd been able to come home from duty and take his wife and daughter to visit his parents in Stuttgart. A city that would burn in nuclear fire, now. All because of the Americans.\n\nHe should've known this was how it would end. Ever since the Britons had abandoned the New Order and their European brothers, they'd stepped further and further into madness. All they'd had to do was stop, he thought, frustrated. Just stop for a moment, and think about what they were doing. This was their fault, all of it."
 channelcrisis.131.a: "Consumed by rage, he sat down and silently waited for the world to end."

 channelcrisis_nego.1.t: "Britain and America Propose a Deal"
 channelcrisis_nego.1.d: "The Reich-Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed us that the OFN wish to open a new round of negotiations. In exchange for our promise to recognise the new British government and not launch an invasion, the OFN may be open to concessions to address our security concerns.\n\nWith the current standoff threatening war with America this may be a sensible option to take, particularly if we can extract enough concessions from the Americans to alleviate the loss of England. However, this inevitably means not getting everything we want, and we risk gaining too little for this great loss.\n\nWe can also refuse and continue attempting to intimidate the OFN through superior force. If we succeed, we will strongly reaffirm our control over Europe, and terrorists across all corners of the Pakt shall know the price of treason. If we fail, however, we may be faced with a war from which we will never recover..."
 channelcrisis_nego.1.a: "Open negotiations. Let's see what we can get."
 channelcrisis_nego.1.b: "We will not negotiate with terrorists."
 channelcrisis_nego.2.t: "Germany Proposes a Deal"
 channelcrisis_nego.2.d: "We received a request today: a message from the Greater Germanic Reich, asking us to come to the table and peacefully settle the Channel Crisis. They would be willing to accept the new government in London, in return for concessions from us that adequetely addresses their concerns.\n\nIt is an offer that would avoid a likely to be catastrophic war. If we can do so while managing to grant Germany minimal concessions, then we'll all look like incredible statesmen. However, it is likely Germany will not give up England without significant concessions, the shape of which we may not fully understand yet.\n\nWe can also continue on our current course. If we can get them to back down through projecting force, Britain would be unquestionably free without the jailors of Europe having any more say over what happens. Of course, this assumes they back down. If they do not, we cannot imagine the horrors a new world war would unleash..."
 channelcrisis_nego.2.a: "Open negotiations. Let's see what we can do."
 channelcrisis_nego.2.b: "We do not negotiate with fascists."
 channelcrisis_nego.10.t: "Germany Refuses to Talk"
 channelcrisis_nego.10.d: "Unsurprisingly, Germany has refused our offer to negotiate the Channel Crisis. They seem committed to an invasion of the British Isles, and at this present time will not seek to bargain for a peaceful solution. However, this rejection does not mean they will not change their minds later."
 channelcrisis_nego.10.a: "Until then, we can only wait and strengthen our position."
 channelcrisis_nego.11.t: "Germany Comes to the Table"
 channelcrisis_nego.11.d: "We have received news that Germany has accepted our offer to negotiate the Channel Crisis. However, we cannot expect these negotiations to be easy. If they accept this new government, they will expect as many concessions from our side as they think we will give to make this deal palatable."
 channelcrisis_nego.11.a: "Let's see what they want."
 channelcrisis_nego.20.t: "The OFN Refuses to Talk"
 channelcrisis_nego.20.d: "Unsurprisingly, the Americans and their British lackeys have refused our generous offer of negotiations to bring this Channel Crisis to a peaceful close. While we must continue to project strength in our territory, this does not mean the OFN may change their minds later on the subject."
 channelcrisis_nego.20.a: "Until then, we cannot show weakness in the face of this threat."
 channelcrisis_nego.21.t: "The OFN Comes to the Table"
 channelcrisis_nego.21.d: "The Americans have seen reason and accepted our offer of a diplomatic resolution to the Channel Crisis. At a minimum, the Americans will demand that we recognise the new British government. This poses a grave security risk, one that we cannot accept without significant concessions. If we are to recognise an OFN government in our sphere of influence, it shall be on our terms."
 channelcrisis_nego.21.a: "If we must put away the sword, let us fight with the pen."
 channelcrisis_nego.3.t: "Diplomatic Checkpoint"
 channelcrisis_nego.3.d: "Our negotiations regarding the status of England continue apace, with both parties agreeing to another critical section of the deal. We are moving towards a peaceful resolution, and our efforts should be commended.\n\nShould negotiations break down later, we can restart from this point rather than negotiating the whole deal again. What we have now is currently reasonable to both parties, and should continue to be reasonable even if there is a break in these proceedings."
 channelcrisis_nego.3.a: "Continue on."
 channelcrisis_nego.40.t: "Germany Walks Away"
 channelcrisis_nego.40.d: "We have bad news from the Channel Crisis negotiations: Germany has walked away from the talks. Citing a lack of adequate concessions from the OFN, they have removed themselves from the negotiations and continue to threaten invasion in the current standoff.\n\nThough negotiations have fallen through, we can possibly try resuming them. Hopefully, they will see reason next time - if there is a next time."
 channelcrisis_nego.40.a: "Unfortunate."
 CC_negotiation_cost_increase_tt: "The cost to open negotiations again has risen by £political_power_texticon §Y100§!"
 channelcrisis_nego.41.t: "The OFN Walks Away"
 channelcrisis_nego.41.d: "As we could have predicted, the Americans and their British vassals have walked away from the negotiating table. They have decided that our terms - which were frankly generous, given what we are losing - are unacceptably high, and have stopped the negotiations, continuing the standoff.\n\nIf we are so inclined, we may be able to resume negotiations at a later date. Until then, the Wehrmacht shall continue their vigil, ensuring that the Americans do not encroach on our beloved fortress."
 channelcrisis_nego.41.a: "They will see reason, one way or another!"
 channelcrisis_nego.50.t: "Negotiations Succeed"
 channelcrisis_nego.50.d: "We have good news out of the line to Germania, they have agreed upon the concessions to be offered and have struck a deal with us to resolve the Channel Crisis. While we and Britain now have to follow the terms imposed and limit our impact to German security, the world can rest safe knowing we are heading away from nuclear midnight."
 channelcrisis_nego.50.a: "We did what we had to do."
 channelcrisis_nego.51.t: "Negotiations Succeed"
 channelcrisis_nego.51.d: "We have received news from Washington and London on our negotiations, we have come to an agreement on the concessions to be given to us in exchange for recognition of their government. While this means Britain is now out of our direct control, we did manage to get at least something out of it, and the world can rest assured knowing that we are no longer on the brink of destruction."
 channelcrisis_nego.51.a: "You won't get this chance again, Amerikaner..."

 channelcrisis.1010.t: "The Ghost of Führers Past"
 channelcrisis.1010.d: ""-yes, we've received the same reports from Portsmouth and Gatwick. Thank you. Understood." Clicking the phone back into place, Knight leaned back in his office chair and laughed, before reaching for his pipe. When the Americans had abandoned the channel he'd been certain that Britain would be forced to endure one last desperate fight for its existence before the darkest of ends. Yet no sooner had the Americans retreated, than it was as if every single German vessel and division had vanished into thin air, as if struck by an angry god. He couldn't make sense of it. Perhaps it truly had been God's judgment?\n\n"Nein! They just used console commands to compensate for their fat skill issue." Knight stared. Seemingly out of nowhere, a blue, floating ghostly looking Adolf Hitler had appeared in his office. The apparition continued to rage.\n\n"Oh ja ja, just open the console, ja? Why didn't Churchill think of that one! Schweinehund! I spent years building my glorious Reich and this is how you think to defeat it? Never!"\n\nKnight continued to watch the ghost rage, completely in shock. "What?" The ghost turned to him.\n\n"Not you, Dummkopf! The one behind the screen! Yes you. I don't know what you think you're up to, Free Britain doesn't even have any content yet. You're just going to break the game and turn this motherfucker into the Britain leader portrait forever." The ghost pointed at Knight, expression furious. "Come on, we worked very hard on the Joyce portrait. I know he's very unwholesome but just try it. Please?"\n\nGhost Hitler shook his head. "You know what? Fuck it. I'm just going to do it too now and make Germany win. How do you like that one, huh?""
 channelcrisis.1010.a: "A floating console bar appeared before the Führer."
