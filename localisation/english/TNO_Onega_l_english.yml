 ### Character Localisation ###
 ONG_Vladimir_Kirpichnikov: "Vladimir Kirpichnikov"
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KIRPICHNIKOV_DESC: "Before the Second World War, Vladimir Vasilevich Kirpichnikov was nothing more than an ordinary commander in the Red Army. Many thought he was destined to die as a hero of the Soviet Union, bravely fighting against the enemy, but that was not to be his fate. In the few months of fighting Russia experienced, before collapsing into chaos and warlordism, Kirpichnikov would lead the 43rd Rifle Division into battle against the Finns in the Karelian Isthmus. The superior enemy tactics would cause the Soviet front to collapse, and the 43rd Division was almost destroyed. Kirpichnikov was captured during the chaotic retreat, and would be interrogated and interned by the Finnish Army.\n\nThe major general would remain imprisoned, until the West Russian War came. Ever since the end of the war on the Eastern Front, Finland had been protected from the chaos in Russia by the Wehrmacht, but once the West Russian Revolutionary Front stormed the A-A line, Finland was in danger. Now, they could not simply trust the Reich to protect the frontier. To solve this problem, the Finns would gather the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard, a force composed of Russians in their territories and led by none other than Kirpichnikov himself. The promise made by Finland, which kept a tight leash on the Guard, was that should they drive the Reds out of Arkhangelsk, they could have the land to settle and be independent.\n\nNow, Kirpichnikov rules the small warlord state centered in Onega, and must stand up against the power that is the WRRF. The Finnish still maintain some control over it, but should Kirpichnikov's Guard liberate Arkhangelsk from the hold of the Communists, the Russians of Karelia might finally be free once again."

 ONG_modernization_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state of industry within the territory that we control is, simply put, terrible.

Instead of waiting, we will send our reports and representatives to Helsinki and urge an offensive response.\n\nNo matter the shape it takes, Communism is still an insidious threat, one only we can extinguish for good."

 ### Foci ###
 ONG_removetheradicals: "Remove the Radicals"
 ONG_removetheradicals_desc: "After the defeat and shattering of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the Finnish government of the Fifties decided, after the annexation of Karelia into Finland proper, to found the state of Onega. A pragmatic solution to contain the chaos of West Russia from spilling over to Finnish territories, it is the first line of defense should a power rise in the east, and threaten Finland itself. Staffed by Russian exiles from various parts of the former Union government, Onega only succeeds due to its political neutrality that ensures continued Finnish support.\n\nThis support must continue. The radicals from left and right must not be allowed to take power, lest they destroy the very foundations of the state it was created to contain. We must root them out from the government, from our political organizations, from our military structures. Perhaps then we can stand, not beholden to the left or the right, but ourselves alone."

 ONG_theendingstruggle: "The Ending Struggle"
 ONG_theendingstruggle_desc: "From the very beginning, Onega's mission as a buffer state is clear: to provide the first line of defense against the remnants of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, currently holed up in the cold northern Russian city of Arkhangelsk. Since its inception, it has been subject to raids, incursions, robberies, and attacks by the Front, in their attempt to gain more loot and resources to haul back to their lair. Against all the odds, Onega's struggle at containing the Front has been so far successful.\n\nHowever, the continued success of our policy is never guaranteed. The Reds right across our borders are not brutish enemies. On the contrary, they are vicious in their intellect and aggressive in ensuring that their revolution will survive to the present age. We shall update our policy of containment, and organize our men into labor battalions. It is time for us to make our stand as the last remaining beacon of free democracy in West Russia."

 ONG_ourfinnishbenefactors: "Our Finnish Benefactors"
 ONG_ourfinnishbenefactors_desc: "Without Finland, Onega would not exist. That is the simple truth of our circumstances. The current Finnish government continues the policy of disallowing Finnish citizens from serving in Onega and remaining neutral from all the chaos that emerges from West Russia, supporting no contender to power. Onega is a state of Russians, funded and equipped by the powers that be in Helsinki, and without their aid, we would have been just another territory absorbed into the Front.\n\nIt is not too late to better our relations with our western neighbors and benefactors. Russian diplomats shall grace their embassy in Onega, while Kirpichnikov shall send overtures and reassurances of continued cooperation personally. The fates of Finland and Onega are intertwined. If Onega loses, the dominant power in West Russia shall drag it into a war that it will not want to enter. If Finland cuts its support, there is no doubt as to what will happen to us."

 ONG_theredmenace: "The Red Menace"
 ONG_theredmenace_desc: "Before the Great Patriotic War, there existed a Union of workers and soviets that reigned from the Bering to the Baltic. Once the forerunner to fulfilling the dreams of the proletariat everywhere, the Germans have shattered this Union, and now warlords claim the pieces of Russia. As it stands, the largest remnant of Union authority in West Russia borders us, and, to put it mildly, they are not the friendliest neighbors by a long shot. Neither the people of Onega nor the Finns desire their breakthrough past our humble little state.\n\nAs such, we need to take measures to arm ourselves against continued raids and incursions coming from the Front. The sandbags shall pile high, and the men behind them will be prepared to open fire. Never shall they take what rightfully belongs to our people, and for every kilogram stolen, they shall pay for its weight in blood. Onega will endure, and outlive the specter of the lost Union."

 ONG_rootoutthebandits: "Root Out the Bandits"
 ONG_rootoutthebandits_desc: "Beyond Onega's frontline lies the West Russian Revolutionary Front: a terrifying foe, the most dangerous contender the old Union's legacy. However, behind the barbed wires and sandbags that dot our border with them is Onega's pervasive problem: banditry. Bands of armed men roam the wilderness, seeking to rob innocent men and women of their belongings. Occasionally, they chance upon an unguarded arms shipment, taking the rifles, ammunition, and various tools of warfare away from us.\n\nTo solve this problem, we have two approaches to pick: either the carrot or the stick. For the softer, less violent option we can bribe these vagabonds and outlaws into serving in our armed forces, in return for a pardon and a living wage. For the harder, more drastic option, we can increase our patrols, and finally root them out and crush them. Whichever we choose, the less effort spent on bickering amongst ourselves, the more room we have to fight against the Reds."

 ONG_promisethemdemocracy: "Promise Them Democracy"
 ONG_promisethemdemocracy_desc: "In our mission to guarantee stability to all that inhabit Onega, we have come upon an opportunity to legitimize us in the eyes of the public. Democracy is a strange concept to Russia: after centuries of imperial rule, followed by two decades of Soviet administration, the people of Russia have not yet truly experienced what democracy is and what it entails. Freedom of speech and expression might seem to an average Onega person to be pipe dream conjured from another realm.\n\nTo rouse the will of Onega to fight for its fate in West Russia, we can promise the implementation of full, parliamentary democracy, with legal rights that come with it. Once our long, seemingly-never ending struggle is over, the rule by the will of the people shall dawn upon Russia. Now that we have promised thus to the people, we shall herald a new era for Onega: where it fights not for ideologies or the will of foreign despots, but for liberty and freedom."

 ONG_wearefreedom: "We Are Freedom"
 ONG_wearefreedom_desc: "Our problem with the West Russian Revolutionary Front is apparent. However, if we were to take our eyes off them and glance at the regions of West Russia, we will discover that we are seemingly alone amid a sea of extremism. Communists, fascists, collaborators, monarchists, and followers of the German racial theory, surround us. West Russia was once a beautiful land, and now we stand within its ruins, a lone beacon of light and liberty for a people that has lost its purpose in the wars of the past.\n\nAll that reside in Onega, be they of Russian, Finnish, or Karelian origin, must know that we are freedom. Our Guards spill their blood in defense of ideas that others within Russia would not even stop to consider: liberty and democracy. Everyone else has taken the easy way out. In their pursuit of power, they have given no thought to the fate of the people. We are different, and we dare to defend it, to the final drops of blood if we must."

 ONG_expandcivilengineering: "Expand Civil Engineering"
 ONG_expandcivilengineering_desc: "During the times of the Empire and Union, the region of Onega only served its purpose as a middleman between the areas bordering Finland and the other, more industrialized parts of Russia. As such, the infrastructure that flows through it is sorely lacking, a holdover from the past. With the Finnish annexation of Karelia and the collapse and subsequent retreat of the Front into Arkhangelsk, Onega has taken the one place nobody ever expected it to claim: a strategic province that shields Finland from the horrors of West Russia.\n\nWith this new status in mind, Kirpichnikov has agreed to expand the civil engineering corps of the Guard. Throughout Onega, they shall build bridges, roads, and more general primary infrastructures throughout our territory to facilitate the quicker movement of troops and supplies to the frontlines. Should the Front or the other warlords attack, they shall not find the Guard wanting and unready."

 ONG_guaranteestability_desc: "Onega might very well be the last bastion of protection against the horrors of West Russia, and the West Russian Revolutionary Front in particular. We are a candle amid dark, our faint light illuminating the way for those who walk with us, a plank of stability in the middle of a raging sea. If we are to defend ourselves, our people must first feel safe, away from the dangers that the warlords of Russia present.\n\nWe must legitimize our claim to our lands. The Finnish, the Germans, and the Russians will know that we are the last, best hope for democracy in West Russia. No more shall the days of banditry disturb and harass the common man of Onega. He shall feel safe, for all that look to the north shall not see only terror and horror, but a hand clasping a torch of liberty. The other shall wield a sword, and all that desire to extinguish the torch shall bleed and die."

 ONG_watchtheborder: "Watch the Border"
 ONG_watchtheborder_desc: "To go east, into deeper parts of Russia, someone from Onega would need to pass through the territory of the Front. However, Onega and the Front have vested interests in not letting each other through. Our border with the Front is lined with trenches, riddled with wires, and blocked by lines and lines of sandbags. Occasionally, however, due to the shortage of personnel on the part of the Guard, a Red Army battalion will sometimes make it through our lines and wreak havoc on the villages within.\n\nWe need to be more vigilant. Kirpichnikov will tighten his Guardsmen's schedules, working them around the clock to ensure that no harm ever comes to people of Onega. For the Red Army prisoners that we capture, we shall ask them to provide information for the next raids or death. Though it might be barbaric for Russians to execute one another without a fair trial, these are desperate times, and we will take harsh measures if need be."

 ONG_watchthecitizens: "Watch the Citizens"
 ONG_watchthecitizens_desc: "While it might be difficult for outside eyes to appraise, the region of Onega does not consist solely of soldiers. The army as an organization would not exist without the recruits drawn from the populace, be they a refugee or a native. Yet, as of late, the more prominent members of the citizenry have displayed sympathies towards the Reds, and on some occasions, the support is not so much subtle as it is brazen and bold. We cannot allow this open defiance of our foundations to stand.\n\nWe will implant members of the army into the social life of our populace. They will go to villages, towns, and refugee camps, masquerading as yet another native or refugee. Then, they will mark certain demagogues who seek to ruin us and inform on them. After that, the Guard will take care that this individual is disciplined on the virtues of democracy, lest they disappear. These are dark times, and to live through it, we must take drastic measures."

 ONG_theanticommunistguard: "The Onega White Guard"
 ONG_theanticommunistguard_desc: "During the Finnish Civil War and the Winter War, there existed an elite unit of Finnish Army units specially trained to fight against the communist armies from Finland itself to Russia. Given their success in the Continuation War, the Finnish White Guard are a shining example of what to follow in constructing an army dedicated entirely to fighting the ideas of communism, and in turn, containing as well as isolating its influence from the broader world. The government of Onega has a thing or two to learn from the Finnish, yet again.\n\nWe will begin a selection process in the army, measuring both recruits and veterans. Those who prove themselves worthy will enter into the new Onega White Guard, who shall bear the honorable burden of protecting the people of Onega from the Red Menace. They shall train in the summer heat and the winter depths, to prepare themselves against the second coming of the Revolution's revenge."

 ONG_breakingtheice: "Breaking the Ice"
 ONG_breakingtheice_desc: "Ideally, Kirpichnikov would like for his ports to be open all year round. Sadly, in the cold northern Russian climate, the only ports that he possesses are liable to freezing in the harsh winters of the Arctic. As a result, for more than half of the year, Onega cannot receive aid from Finland and elsewhere without relying on railroads and other land-based methods of transportation. While such means are sufficient for now, it would perhaps allow for a larger volume of aid from Finland to enter all-year if the ports could be used.\n\nLacking options for expansion without angering either the Finns or the Reds, it is now time to consider stopgap measures. To our west, a lake separates us from Finland proper. We will attach icebreakers on both our seagoing and freshwater ship, and shatter the ice that has so long blocked us to the outside world. After this measure is done, traders will enter Onega in larger numbers than before, from Finland or elsewhere."

 ONG_welcomethekarelians: "Welcome the Karelians"
 ONG_welcomethekarelians_desc: "The Karelians are the people who inhabit Karelia, now known as Eastern Finland. Although sharing strong linguistic and cultural links with the Finnish, hundreds of years of Russian rule has made them more akin to us, a fact that the Finnish consider inconvenient. From year to year, many Karelians have been displaced by the Finnish government as Finnish settlers immigrated to areas that Karelians have inhabited for hundreds of years. Where do the Karelians go? Why, Onega, of course.\n\nWhile Onega is admittedly a less-than-ideal place for them, perhaps it is not the end of the world to welcome them here. From their refugees, we shall make them soldiers, artisans, factory workers, or even leaders. Once they step into Russian soil, they will become permanently Russian, another comrade in our struggle against the Front's constant waves of raids. Together, we shall reclaim our homeland, and forge a new one for this newly-homeless people."

 ONG_securetherailroad: "Secure the Railroad"
 ONG_securetherailroad_desc: "In the absence of warm water ports, rail routes to and through Onega has become an essential asset to Kirpichnikov's government. Supplies from Finland come mainly through trains, and securing more routes would guarantee a larger volume of support. To the north of us, the Reds hold a significant piece of the Onega rail network. They recognize the strategic value it holds for us, and are therefore doing all they can to keep us from reclaiming it.\n\nWith the formation of new Onega White Guard units, we are ready to tackle the Reds head-on. They may not wish to relinquish it from their hands, but if so, we are more than willing to take it from them by force. The White Guards will shatter their morale, using their superior training to compensate for their lack of numbers. Once the railway is in our hands, Finland will send us more supplies and aid, and as days go by, the Reds' hold over us will weaken."

 ONG_finnishadvisors: "Finnish Advisors"
 ONG_finnishadvisors_desc: "The Finns have proven the worth of their defensive doctrines during the Winter War and Continuation Conflict after that. Strong enough to endure the might of an industrialized Union at the height of its power, its value to the generals and officers of Onega are clear; Finland is the only power with whom we share a commonality of tactics and strategy, not to mention converging political interests. With these factors in mind, we need Finnish instruction - surely, our closest ally would provide them at a lower price.\n\nWe will send the best of our negotiators to Helsinki, to negotiate with the Finnish government. In place of Finnish soldiers fighting in Onega, they should be willing to part with a few instructors. Finnish blood, after all, must not be spilled at all costs. Once in Onega, we will have these advisors teach us the Finnish art of war. With Finnish equipment and training, we will be invincible."

 ONG_finnishindustrialaid: "Finnish Industrial Aid"
 ONG_finnishindustrialaid_desc: "The dependence we have on Finland is apparent to any outside observer. Without their support, perhaps we would have fallen into the hands of the Reds, or even worse. However, this dependence has not extended to our industry: the one sector in which the Finns have not aided, in the name of maintaining our autonomy and independence. Unlike Onega, however, Finland has a functioning economy, free from the terror bombing the Germans inflicted on the rest of Russia.\n\nIt may be wise to consider aid from the Finns regarding this matter at this juncture. We will go to Helsinki and ask the Finns for their help. We don't have much time: the new developments in West Russia have made it plain that soon a power will unite the fractured lands. The Reds, hard as it is to say, may not be the worst victor in the coming conflict. If the light of Russian democracy is to continue forever, a little submission to a foreign power should not hurt."

 ONG_finnishfreedomfliers_desc: "Due to the small nature of the industry in Onega, all production of war materiel must sadly boil down to the essentials of the infantryman. While we are technically capable of producing planes using borrowed Finnish designs, we are not prepared to wage a full-scale war in the air. Once again, we turn to Finland, our sole ally in a chaotic Russia possessed only by the bloodlust of war. We will not simply petition them for fighters or air support; some in Kirpichnikov's general staff have proposed a novel use for airpower.\n\nFliers. Simple pieces of paper tailored to serve a propagandistic purpose. We will request that the Finnish fly over the territories of the Reds, dropping fliers and demoralizing the Soviet soldiers stationed on the border or even beyond. Depriving the Reds of their will to fight will become our first step towards shattering them upon the lines of Onega: a day that rears its head closer and closer as the days pass."

 ONG_lastlineofdefense_desc: "The White Guard stands tall at the borders of Onega, ready to stop any intruder that brings the horrors and chaos of West Russia. However, there may come a time when even the stalwart Guard will fall. Kirpichnikov is keenly aware of the power disparity between the Guard and any power that manages to unify West Russia. He admits to his shame that perhaps even with Finnish aid, backing, and training, it all may not be enough. As such, we must prepare for contingencies.\n\nIf the border posts of Onega fall and the invaders pierce deep into our territory, we shall make them pay for every inch of land they take from us. Of our particular focus is our capital: the West Russians would march in, thinking that it is empty and unguarded, for the Guardsmen had routed in the field. We will subvert this expectation. We will defend it to the last: with machine guns and Zhdanov cocktails, with rifles and grenades, with fists and knives and teeth. They shall not pass."

 ONG_exploittheirfactionalism: "Status of the Communal Fisheries"
 ONG_exploittheirfactionalism_desc: "During the times of the Union, Bukharin's economic policies meant that every vital labor effort would be collectivized and co-opted. For the average worker, these efforts were nothing short of beneficial and revolutionary: living standards and wages rose following economic growth. However, due to the Reds across our border, this policy, with which the Government of Onega has a live and let live relationship, may inspire our workers to support the Front instead of the Onega White Guard.\n\nTo resolve this problem, we have called for a review of the collectivization plan. The most significant, and hence the first industry that the government has decided to tackle, is the communal fishery system. We must conclude this matter and fast. Whatever approaches we choose, the Union's old plan cannot survive. Without any Soviet policies remaining in our government, our workers should distance themselves from the Reds, and may even come to support us wholeheartedly."

 ONG_probetheirline: "Probe Their Line"
 ONG_probetheirline_desc: "Although they may look daunting, the Reds do not present a united front as of late. The West Russian Revolutionary Front is split into three: in Arkhangelsk proper, Ukhta, and Plesetsk. The Marshals in charge of Ukhta and Plesetsk are infamous for their rivalry in the West Russian War, and we might only wait for the Front to shatter on its own weight before long. However, Kirpichnikov reckons that this factionalism presents an intriguing opportunity for the soldiers of Onega and the White Guard to take the fight to the enemy.\n\nWe will test the Reds. Kirpichnikov and his general staff shall hand-pick and form recon teams from the best of the best. These teams shall attack the Red lines, giving us an estimate of their preparedness and unity. With the Reds dazed by a succession crisis that will inevitably happen after the death of Yegorov, they will not be able to respond with any full-scale attacks, a chance that we cannot hope to ignore."

 ONG_preparetheredoubts: "Prepare the Redoubts"
 ONG_preparetheredoubts_desc: "Industrial aid now flows from Finland into Onega, and the railways that secure this aid are in our hands. Perhaps it is time to bolster our defenses once again to repel any invaders that try to attack us. With Finnish technological advances in construction and the spirit of the people of Onega, we can now build new and improved defenses all along our border with the Reds: redoubts. Situated along with the more vulnerable parts of our fortifications, these will serve to block and break any advance the enemy will make in battle.\n\nOur soldiers shall form labor battalions to build these immediately. The material for these efforts shall come from none other than Finland, our closest ally to the west. With these in place, the Reds, or any warlord that takes their place, shall think twice before initiating a conflict with us. In these redoubts, they shall find their forces shattered, the pieces of their offensive used against them."

 ONG_ensuresupplylines: "Ensure the Supply Lines Don't Fail"
 ONG_ensuresupplylines_desc: "War does not begin and end with battles: every army marches on its stomach. Without proper infrastructure to ferry food and supplies from our factories and farms to the frontlines, our men, even the stalwart Guard, shall not stand even against the weakest of foes. Our civil engineering efforts have guaranteed a baseline for the efficiency of supply. However, with the war with the Reds fast approaching, we fear that it might not be enough after all.\n\nFor this, we shall prepare more roads, more railroad routes, more trucks, and fast runners to ensure that the front is well-catered. This infrastructural effort shall not stop at ensuring that our defenses will perform at an optimal rate, but to sustain offensives and attacks into West Russia proper. With Finnish aid and the dedication of our Guard, everything is possible. We have spent much of our existence on the back foot; perhaps it is time to move forward, and let the Reds cower in fear."

From the east come the Russians, from the west come the Finns and Karelians, all finding their rest in the refugee camps on the borders of Onega, a fertile breeding ground for the fostering of radical and extremist ideas. Some have even shown support for the Reds openly, and getting rid of these individuals can only do so much to contain the spread of communism.\n\nIt is time for us to seek structural changes rather than solely relying on intrigue. We shall kill two birds with one stone: our radicalization and labor problems. These refugees will wake to the sound of factories, fisheries, and farms throwing their doors open, welcoming our new workforce with open arms. Without the opportunity to think of their condition, these radical ideas shall die away, quietly and without fuss."

Kirpichnikov, however, sees in their suffering a new opportunity to ensure that they will be eternally indebted to the government of Onega: we will build for them cheap homes in our cities, villages, and towns. Whether Russian, Finnish, or Karelian, all are welcome to Onega.\n\nOur factories shall churn out the building materials required for this project. Meanwhile, the Guard shall form labor battalions and conscript the refugees into this effort. Once these are complete, the refugees shall no longer live out in the open, but in the bosom of Onega, to whom they shall remain eternally loyal. Dissent and rebellion shall fade away, as dark and dangerous ideas that one had embraced due to the desperation of the times."

 ONG_ourrighteousstruggle: "Our Righteous Struggle"
 ONG_ourrighteousstruggle_desc: "From the moment of its inception, Onega's destiny was clear: to prevent the Soviets from establishing a foothold and containing their influence from spreading farther into Europe. Rather than a dagger pointed at the Front's heart, it has always been a shield that protects Finland and Europe beyond it, from the contagious and virulent ideology of the communists. We may stand alone, but we do not stand without impetus, motive, nor reason: our struggle is righteous and without flaw.\n\nWe shall let the people know of our ideals and legitimacy. The papers, the radios, and all forms of media shall convey our legitimate claim to existence. Hearing of this news, our people will stride forward to the frontlines, in the factories, and on the farms, to stem the sweeping tide of the Red Army. If we fail, we shall not fail without honor. If we succeed, then all of Russia shall know freedom and liberty, and Europe shall be free from the communist threat."

 ONG_laythemines: "Lay the Mines"
 ONG_laythemines_desc: "Kirpichnikov and the White Guards do not go to war expecting defeat. However, due to the difference in power with the Front, a loss is a plausible possibility. Our offensives into West Russia, should we choose to execute them, are open to the likelihood of failure. As with all of our planning so far, the government has decided to plan for contingencies in case of a Soviet attack against Onega. The redoubts and forts will no longer be enough.\n\nMines shall litter the ground between our heartland and the border with the Front. While not enough to stop their advance entirely, we should be able to give our troops the time and space needed to regroup and reorganize. Once they are ready, they shall charge again into the thick of the fray, taking the Reds by surprise. We will inform the locals of our decision, but not seek their consent; all must carry Onega's burden on its march to the final victory against communism."

 ONG_bolsterthecivilguard_desc: "While the Army of Onega is not a force to be taken lightly, there is always a problem that has plagued it since its formation. Even the mighty and formidable Onega White Guards do not seem any less susceptible to it. We lack personnel. Onega has never been one of the most populous regions of Russia, and the influx of refugees has only alleviated this problem to a limited extent. If we are to fight a sustained war with the Reds, we are bound to be bled dry from a sheer lack of soldiers.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we shall form the Onega Civil Guards. Drawn up from the youngest to the oldest, all that can fight in the final war shall be given a rifle and a uniform. Whoever can lift a gun and fire it shall find their place in our armed forces. A drastic measure, to be sure, but one that is arguably better than letting the Reds run amok through Onega and into Finland. All shall bear their burden to assure our triumph."

If we fail at the posts assigned to us by the Finns, there is little doubt as to what would occur. The West Russian Revolutionary Front do not pose a threat to Onega alone, but to Europe as a whole. Their dream of world revolution shall not stop at West Russia alone. After the conquest of Russia, they will turn their eyes, to Moskowien, to Germany, and through that to the precipice of the Atlantic. If we do not stop them here, no one will halt their momentum.\n\nWe must destroy them. To merely kill them is not enough. We shall fight them in the redoubts, the trenches, and the forts; if they defeat us there, we shall fight in the marshes and the streets. We will fight to the last, our machine guns not halting their fire until they stop or we die. For the salvation and safety of Europe, no price is too small to pay."

The deed is done, however, and the Union lies shattered, its pieces melding and fighting with one another. Yet, the threat remains in Arkhangelsk, in the form of the West Russian Revolutionary Front.\n\nIt is the duty of all citizens of Onega to ensure the defeat of the Front, once and for all. All who can work in factories, farms, and fisheries shall labor for longer hours, exchanging sweat and tears for blood. The Civil Guard shall expand its operations to the whole of Onega. All shall bear their burden. For Europe to be free, every one of us must give their all. With our sacrifices, we shall ensure that Europe maintains its liberty and freedom through the ages."

 ONG_fortifykargopol: "Fortify Kargopol"
 ONG_fortifykargopol_desc: "Kargopol was never a particularly important place. The city rests on the bank of the upper Onega River, and that is what has brought it into prominence for Kirpichnikov's government - just across the river, one can notice a military outpost with the red-and-gold flag of the WRRF waving above it. Kargopol is a city right on the frontier, and as such must be protected from hostile incursions and the possibility of invasion. We know that, if it falls, then the communists will be able to control the trade along the Onega, and we cannot let that happen.\n\nNew fortifications will be built, and troops of the Anti-Communist Guard will be called in to assist in the defense of the town. A defense line will be formed on the banks of Kargopol, to ensure that no matter what, it will firmly survive any Soviet onslaught."

 ONG_defendtheriver: "Defend the River"
 ONG_defendtheriver_desc: "The Onega River is a crucial part of our territories. Flowing from the south until it reaches the White Sea, it happens to form the border between the Anti-Communist Guard's controlled territory with the remnants of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. As the communist stronghold presents the only credible threat to us at the moment, it would be prudent to further entrench our position on the Onega, which is a good natural defense line.\n\nShould it be lost, then we will be in dire straits, but that is all the more reason for reinforcing its defenses. With extensive Finnish aid, the barebones pre-existing fortifications will be built up, just in case the WRRF or anyone else gets the idea of invading. When they do, we shall be ready."

 ONG_fortifyonega: "Fortify Onega"
 ONG_fortifyonega_desc: "The Anti-Communist Guard unfortunately only has one major city it can reliably control right now - of course, that is Onega. Lying just across the WRRF military outposts, it is key to our goals, for if it is lost, there is nowhere to retreat to. Over the years, it has evolved into a hub of trade, as well as a station for all those who want to flee the oppressive Soviet system.\n\nIf and when the Front carries out its invasion, it is more than certain that our capital, resting so close to the unofficial border, will be a prime target. Thus, even though much of the Guard is already positioned in the militarized town to protect it, further reinforcements must be called in. From other villages and towns, as well as newly recruited troops, more men must come to ensure that our capital never falls."

 ONG_antiair: "Against Soviet Air"
 ONG_antiair_desc: "One might think that Onega, as a minor warlord state, could never hope to stand up against the air forces of other, much more formidable armies in Russia. The industrial bases of others, especially the West Russian Revolutionary Front, dwarf that of our state, which can only count on what few factories were recently built with Finnish aid by the Kirpichnikov government. We are behind in airplane production capabilities, but that does not mean it's impossible to make a difference.\n\nOnegan and Finnish engineers have been in contact over the last few weeks, discussing how to combat the effects of socialist air power. Anti-aircraft guns and technicians will be provided. Combined with our knowledge of Soviet Air Force tactics and their weak points from when we fought with them and against them, it should not be a difficult task to protect the skies of Onega."

Any threat presented to Finland was, by extension, a threat we had to deal with.\n\nFor once, we have come out victorious in the struggle against the rising power of West Russia, and the fate of the land is in our hands. While we may have achieved our mission, that does not mean all our problems are solved, however. Unrest remains, bandits roam the countryside, and we need to decide if we will act on General Kirpichnikov's promises for when victory was ensured. Will we restore democracy, even when it could pose a danger to the newly established order?"

 ONG_weregoingtohavetoact_desc: "We might have won the noble war against those who tried to invade us, but that does not mean that resistance to the newly declared North Russian Republic has magically halted. Dozens of small groups of bandits or former soldiers still resist our authority, hiding in the mountains and launching raids on towns and villages. Often, they are devoted to the same regimes we fought so hard to bring down. From now on, we cannot allow this to happen as the rulers of North Russia.\n\nThe Volunteer Guard's job, besides protecting the nation from the few external threats that exist, is dealing with these bandits. Increased patrols, a recruitment drive and utilizing local support will all be crucial in restoring order, and creating a sense of safety and stability."

All that is left now is for the actual system promised to make its return to the nation after almost half a century of the Bolshevik stain. Suffrage will be widely expanded to the standards of the modern Western world, and the final preparations for elections in the Republic will be soon completed.

While we don't want to end up as an authoritarian nation, especially considering all of what Russia's been through, we also don't want to end up just as radicalized as the warlords we have just finished ridding Western Russia of.\n\nAs such, unfortunate as it may be, some of these reformers have to go. We can retire them from the public light, give them very generous pensions - anything to secure our young republic."

 ONG_freethepress_desc: "With the beginning of stability on the horizon for the young republic, a number of the draconian measures that we once had to take to ensure continued existence and compliance with our vision are no longer necessary. The press has long been on our list for reform itself - during the days of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard, we were forced to censor the press and virtually control it as if it was an organ of the government, to prevent communist subversion and continue the image of the Guard as a force for good in Russia.\n\nNow, as the communists are vanquished and the people clamor for more liberties, we finally have the opportunity to give it to them. We should begin to ease our press censorship, and return more and more of their creative direction to civilians - as long as they don't advocate Bolshevism, of course."

 ONG_easethesurveilance: "Ease the Surveillance"
 ONG_easethesurveilance_desc: "Perhaps one of the most impressive things that the Guard set up, with Finnish assistance of course, was a pervasive surveillance state, where the Guard knew the loyalties of the vast majority of the citizens within our rule. This imposing system included a repressive diktat that banned all unions regardless of their political sympathies and the prevented public meetings. This had served its purpose quite well, and for a long time we were able to successfully fend off the threat of internal infiltration by communists and other radicals.\n\nBut as the republic liberalizes, many have brought into question the continued role of the government in surveilling their citizens, especially the economic issues of trying to do so across all of Western Russia. While the threat of the communists has not yet subsided, we should perhaps ease our operations a little - this way, we can save a bit of money and trouble, as well as assure the people that we're dedicated to a free republic."

Our republic cannot and will not have this happen.\n\nA wide propaganda offensive must be undertaken to show the people the issues and dangers associated with communism and the potential threat of communist agents.\n\nWe need to make sure that not just our administration, but the common Russian themselves, is on the lookout for communist sympathizers. We need to root out the remnants of the communists and ensure that they never again pose a threat to our young republic."

Even today, fascism oppresses out people and prevents our prosperity, as evidenced by the German occupation of Moscow. Some of the most dangerous warlords in Western Russia even professed fascism as a political solution to the issues that the Russian people faced - and it was scary how many of our people followed them.\n\nWe can't allow the extremes of fascism to leak back into our society and poison the foundations of the republic. A combination of well-thought out anti-fascist propaganda, forceful actions, and the targeting of key fascist figures and dissenters within Arkhangelsk and beyond will surely protect the young republic and those in its charge from the dangers of far-right extremism."

 ONG_themonarchistthreat_desc: "The Russian Revolution of 1917 saw the Romanov dynasty deposed, supposedly forever. The end of the monarchy was widely celebrated by our people - and with good reason. The Tsarist system was characterised by systemic political, economic, and social oppression, combined with an autocratic system of government. Of course, it was followed by something just as bad, but for a few months in 1917, it seemed as if the Russian people had a real chance at democracy and freedom.\n\nYet as insane as it might be, one of the very real possibilities that nearly occurred was the restoration of Imperial Russia under Vladimir III and his cronies. While he has since been dealt with, many of his sympathizers remain, causing continual issues for the North Russian Republic.

Some of the more reasonable leftists can be brought into the fold of cooperation if we're willing to grant them certain concessions, like the right to trade unions and limited working hours in a day.\n\nAt the very least, by doing this, we can appease the left-leaning parties and hopefully shut up the agitators who are too public, popular, or dangerous to silence otherwise."

 ONG_equalrights: "Guarantee Certain Rights"
 ONG_equalrights_desc: "What is a democracy without personal freedoms? Do we live in an age past, when Tsars and Khans dictated to our people the will of God? No! We live in a modern world, and we are building a free democracy. Thus, of course, like any good democracy, we must guarantee certain rights - civil rights, for women and minorities, to ensure that they have basic protection by the government against the harsh reality of what Western Russia has become after decades of German bombing.\n\nBeyond simple idealism, guaranteeing these rights will also buy us the much-needed support in areas beyond our typical power base - women in the cities and minorities outside of them."

 ONG_russianrepublicanism: "Russian Republicanism"
 ONG_russianrepublicanism_desc: "Our people have tired of decades of dictatorship and systematic oppression. No matter how much Bukharin posited that he was anything but, he was just that - a dictator. The Russian people have not known democracy, and those who remember, for the briefest moment, when Russia was a republic, are too old to do much now and constitute only a very small fraction of our population.\n\nWe need to promote the ideals of Russian republicanism among the people and garner support for our new government in the coming months to ensure that the people will back us and see our government and all those associated with it as legitimate representations and extensions of the North Russian Republic."

 ONG_russianmodernization: "Modernization"
 ONG_russianmodernization_desc: "The state of industry within the territory that we control is, simply put, terrible. No self-respecting government would let the people work in factories where the best equipment is a tetanus risk dating from the Soviet era, and the worst equipment is virtually falling apart. It's time to modernize our industry, so that we can catch up with the rest of the world and make it look like, for once, the Russians have their act together.\n\nThe republic knows that it's a mammoth task, but one that is necessary to ensure that the republic is best equipped to deal with the future, as well as any external or internal threats that may arise."

 ONG_disbandtheguard: "Disband the Guard"
 ONG_disbandtheguard_desc: "The Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard was one of the main apparatuses of the state that Kirpichnikov had set up with Finnish assistance. It comprised both the armed forces and the police, making sure that the communists in the regions that we controlled would not be able to organize or pose a serious threat to our power. For the past few years, it has certainly served our pseudo-state quite well in its capacity as both military and paramilitary and has served its purpose to satisfaction. However, after long deliberation, Kirpichnikov has seen fit to officially order the disbanding of the Volunteer Guard - in favor of the formation of an official civilian police force and a North Russian Republican Army, the NRRA.\n\nThis will ensure that a professional force - composed of many who were once in the Guard - will best serve the republic."

 ONG_pacifyvologda: "Pacify Vologda"
 ONG_pacifyvologda_desc: "The so-called Neutral Zone of Vologda was a problematic pseudo-state that professed that the area under their control was free from political interference from both the Germans and the Russians. In reality, however, Vologda was effectively ruled with an iron fist by the military, which left it in a conflicting, difficult state.\n\nOn the one hand, the population has little issue towards our rule. On the other, however, there are a number of military holdouts, some as gangs of bandits and others quite large that roam the countryside opposing our rule and generally generating severe issues with our attempts at administering the province. We need to use a combination of popular outreach and our armed forces to pacify Vologda and pave the way for our rule."

 ONG_pacifykomi: "Pacify Komi"
 ONG_pacifykomi_desc: "Perhaps one of the most troubling parts of our new territory, Komi was once the center of all things moderate... but also all things radical. From the most depraved of rightists to the most degenerate of communists, Komi welcomed everyone... and as such, was doomed to collapse. But just because their state has failed does not mean that the radicals within the area no longer pose a threat to our rule. In fact, if anything, they pose a greater threat than ever - the years of political maneuvering and posturing has left the more radical sectors of society quite well-equipped to stir the masses against our republic.\n\nThus, we need to compromise with what's left of the democratic center in Komi, and work with the local political elites to ensure our rule is one that is palatable to the population of Syktyvkar and beyond."

 ONG_pacifyark: "Pacify Arkhangelsk"
 ONG_pacifyark_desc: "Arkhangelsk - the former capital of the West Russian Revolutionary Front and the provisional heart of the communist movement following the West Russian War. Centered around some of the important passages of the White Sea, it now comprises our capital and its hinterland. Unfortunately, it's still rife with communist rebels, guerrillas, and dissenters, people who simply don't know how, or perhaps when, to stop their futile resistance.\n\nWe can put forward all of the propaganda that we can, we can talk of reforms and liberalization, but for those who won't listen or compromise, well, those are the people who pose the most danger to our young republic. We can deploy the armed forces to hunt down any communist holdouts, and the police will be able to handle those not brave enough to take an active, armed stance against our administration."

 ONG_pacifykotlas: "Pacify Plesetsk"
 ONG_pacifykotlas_desc: "Plesetsk, once the domain of the Red Napoleon, lays under our control. The effect that his rule had on the province is clear - a compliant population, used to a high degree of near-permanent military mobilization. This land is harsh and the people harsher, tempered by years of hardship and communist militarism. While some of the most die-hard communists still subsist here in Plesetsk, the people are practically begging for liberation under a new administration.\n\nLet's get to work."

 ONG_pacifyukhta: "Pacify Ukhta"
 ONG_pacifyukhta_desc: "Ukhta, once the princedom of Zhukov, was an administrative division of the Front before its collapse - in fact, it was one of the main economic regions that remained controlled by the Front following the West Russian War. While it has long been abandoned by Zhukov and his clique, the scars of war communism still show on those who live in Ukhta. Some communist guerrillas roam the countryside, but after decades of rule under a failed system, it seems that even they are beginning to tire of a cause that has long since been lost. It's time, however, to extend our administration in Ukhta, to repurpose the economic structure that had been so methodically put in place by Zhukov, and begin getting profit flowing once again from the region."

 ONG_protector: "Protector of Northern Russia"
 ONG_protector_desc: "The North Russian Republic has fought and bled for every inch of territory that we now control. From our humble origins as Finnish beneficiaries, our leader Kirpichnikov has brought our force from one that had struggled at the periphery of relevance to that of a dominant position in Russia - for that, we are eternally grateful. We have taken action to secure our position and deal with the remaining troublemakers who were incompatible or refused to cooperate with our vision. We have set up a number of client states that will help us extend our dominion over the rest of Russia that has been freed by us - but the North Russian Republic is the protector of the region, and never again will Russia fall to sectarian conflict and political radicalism."

 ONG_takeoutvorkuta_desc: "The old Vasily Blokhin, Yagoda's old executioner. Following the collapse of the Union, Blokhin established for himself the equivalent of a "gulag state" in the far north, setting up Vorkuta as his capital. The troops loyal to him, mostly gulag guards and a select few NKVD officers, have long been raiding deep into the territory that we control, disrupting our stability and killing the very people that we swore to protect from the likes of the Red Butcher.\n\nWe need to put a stop to these raids and prevent people like Blokhin from hurting those that we protect - for the good of the Russian people."

 ONG_pacifyvorkuta: "Pacify Vorkuta"
 ONG_pacifyvorkuta_desc: "With Blokhin dealt with, it's time to pacify the areas that he once controlled. By instituting a system of "work release" for those within the gulags and examining the nature of the prisoners there, even going so far as to release some of the less radical political prisoners, we can begin to heal the damage that the Butcher and his predecessors had done. Furthermore, we can extend our public outreach programs to the people who lived within the vicinity of the gulags - the few who do - as they had barely been governed by Blokhin during his tenure in Vorkuta."

 ONG_foreignpolicy: "Access to the Neighbors"
 ONG_foreignpolicy_desc: "While we have set up a large network of puppets, statelets, and client states throughout the areas of Western Russia that we cannot, or will not govern, there is little official or standardized interaction between our government and the rest of the statelets. Thus, we should work to contact each and every one of them to make sure that they understand what's expected of them - and what sort of rights we reserve over their local administrations. Rights, including, of course, the provision - no, the need - to have free and unrestricted movement and military access across the whole of Western Russia for the North Russian Republican Army and her scions to ensure the maximum degree of protection for both ourselves and those who serve us."

 ONG_guarantees: "Guaranteeing the Neighbors"
 ONG_guarantees_desc: "During our conquests of Western Russia, we delegated administration to a number of statelets and client states over large swathes of territory that we control. Make no mistake, of course, these client states are firmly under our thumb. However, we need to make sure that the leaders of these new states, as well as the rest of the world, are aware that they are under the thumb of the North Russian Republic and that we, as well as the North Russian Republican Army, are the primary defenders of these statelets, as well as the freedom of our young republic and those who serve it. We should announce that we are guaranteeing the independence of all of our new neighbors, who will do well to remember and serve the North Russian Republic."

 ONG_kirpichnikovspromise_desc: "Before the great struggle in West Russia, General Kirpichnikov had made promises to the people under his rule. If authoritarianism was defeated and peace established, he said, then grand reforms would be taken. A presidential democracy would be established, with regular and free elections. All the parties, movements and unions whose operations were limited, or even outright banned, would be free to act however they wanted.\n\nThese promises had been made by many ever since the fall of Bukharin's Soviet Union, but few have acted on them. With threats to the General's regime eliminated, and a Republic formally established, there is now nothing stopping us from complete reform. Kirpichnikov and his closest advisors are already taking care of that, by passing a series of key laws and even drafting an initial constitution. Soon, we will be a fully-fledged republic."

 ONG_defensepact: "Form a Defensive Pact"
 ONG_defensepact_desc: "Now that we have set up new regimes across the west of Russia, introduced the infrastructure of inter-state cooperation, we should work to make sure that the inter-state cooperation is deepened and primarily focused around the mutual defense of our new states.\n\nAlready, our delegates and representatives from these areas are preparing the local politicians and strongmen for our ultimate plan: the creation of a defensive pact throughout all of the statelets of Western Russia, to ensure that neither us nor the rest of our newfound allies are ever threatened by external threats again. Hungry hawks may target one state, but with all of us together, we will be a fearsome deterrent."

 ONG_afreerepublic: "A Free Republic"
 ONG_afreerepublic_desc: "With the political liberalization measures that we've taken recently, our political structure today looks completely different from what it was mere years - no, months - ago. Both internally and externally, with our state directly or otherwise controlling the vast majority of Western Russia, we have earned, perhaps accidentally, a degree of political legitimacy both among our people and the international community.\n\nOur leaders, wanting to capitalize on this, have since suggested that our North Russian Republic emphasize our democratic connections to the Russian Republic of 1917, the tragically short-lived attempt at Russian democracy. By drawing parallels, we'll help both our domestic and international image."

 ONG_astrongrepublic: "A Strong Republic"
 ONG_astrongrepublic_desc: "Our new territories and allies have finally been stabilized, and with the North Russian Republican Army well-established as the protector of not just our lands but the entirety of Western Russia, we can finally declare ourselves a strong republic, one that is not only interested in the preservation of the self, but also the order and nascent peace that our long and bloody conquests have netted us.\n\nWith no rest, and no peace, the Russian people suffer. But the order that we have brought to what was once anarchy will preserve our people for the foreseeable future."

 ### Events ###
 ONG.1.t: "The Victory"
 ONG.1.desc: "Vladimir Kirpichnikov walked down the central street of Arkhangelsk. Had they not been destroyed forever by the fierce fighting, the signs would inform him that he was in Krasnaya Avenue, which was once bustling with life, but was now completely quiet. The city was still in ruins; buildings had been torn down and crumbled, while others had been gutted by the fires. One structure that had surprisingly managed to survive was a government building that had housed the Premier of the WRRF and its Politburo, and which was often called "the Kremlin".\n\nAs he walked up the stairs of the building, all he could think of was the final victory he had achieved. Years of struggle in the desolate lands of Onega had gone by, but now, his people were at peace. He could remember his days as a prisoner of war in Finland, and the promise their government had made; should you defeat the Front, you will have your freedom.\n\nVladimir entered the "Kremlin", and saw all the communist symbols and flags, some of which he ripped down. Behind him, a small escort of eight men followed, watching out for any dangers. As he continued to walk in the building, he closely observed the floors, the rooms, and the offices. Everything there reminded him of the war he had just fought - but thankfully won - and what that had taken. Above all, he was glad that all the Karelian Russians, that seemed destined to be forever stuck in the freezing lands of Onega could now enjoy a good life thanks to his accomplishments.\n\nThe general turned around, and spoke to his soldiers. "The Guard could definitely use a building like this!" They all laughed together."
 ONG.1.a: "Major General Kirpichnikov, you have accomplished your mission."

 ONG.2.t: "Arrival of the Anti-Communist Guard"
 ONG.2.desc: "Great news has arrived for our country! It is no secret that the war against the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the "vanguard of socialism" in the region, has been a difficult struggle and one that has forced us to use everything we have at our disposal. After all, the Front is the remnants of the old movement from the days of the West Russian War, and it has finally decided to reclaim its place as a formidable power in the country. Thankfully for us, who have dared to challenge it, we have found an ally in this hostile environment, and it is the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard.\n\nToday, in one of the many recruitment centers we have set up to help in mobilization, over a hundred men appeared seemingly out of nowhere, requesting that they participate in the struggle against the socialists of the WRRF. When asked about their background, they made the situation much clearer: they are proud Russians from Onega, the warlord state famous for resisting the Front against all odds with Finnish support.\n\nIt seems that General Kirpichnikov's regime has been successful in cultivating patriotic sentiment. Of course, our government and the high command have welcomed the arrival of the Anti-Communist Guard, and a special unit of Onegans has been quickly organized and sent to the front. While it may not be much, it is still useful in this war."
 ONG.2.a: "Even the smallest help counts."

 ONG.3.t: "Red Flags in the Streets"
 ONG.3.desc: "Onega was not a particularly large city. At least, that was true before the Anti-Communist Guard came under Vladimir Kirpichnikov and established a warlord state there, bringing many Russians there. However, not all of them were loyal to the Onega regime.\n\nDespite all the hurdles the dictatorship had set up to end free and fair ideological expression, from censoring media to imprisoning political opponents, some could still have their voice be heard. One day, a few blocks away from their leader's residence, over two hundred citizens had the courage to make a democratic protest, carrying all sorts of banners and flags, that more often than not were painted red.\n\nThe first hours of the protest were the most glorious. The self-proclaimed democrats went around the city, rallying the support of other brave Russians who joined the movement, fanatically yelling messages against the warlord government. This exponential growth would soon come to an end, as the demonstrators reached the central city square and met approximately fifty police officers, all protected by armour and armed to their teeth.\n\nTear gas was thrown on the demonstrators, many of whom were students, but they kept going, dedicated to their fight for democracy and socialism. As demands began to be drafted and declarations prepared, the order was given to the police stationed in the city center: break up the protest at all costs. Soon, the first shots were heard; panic ensued, many fleeing or engaging in hand-to-hand combat with law enforcement. The police had no intention of stopping, and so continued firing on the civilians until the threat ended. By nightfall, there was no one protesting anymore; everyone had fled the bullets, or had been wounded by them. For the Guard, this was a small domestic victory, but for the socialists, the dream of democracy seemed more and more impossible to achieve."
 ONG.3.a: "We did what had to be done."

 ONG.4.t: "Last Walk Home"
 ONG.4.desc: "Matyev enjoyed walking home. It gave him a chance to clear his head, and the view along the foreshore of Onega Bay in the dwindling light of the afternoon was always spectacular. The last day he walked home was from a particularly bad day at the lumberyard. His boss, a pretentious, cruel little Finn called Kalle had chosen Matyev as his victim for that shift, berating him for hours about the efficiency of his work squad on the sawmill. Martyev had tried to explain to him that the efficiency at the sawmill was a matter of machinery, not of the operator, but Kalle would not listen.\n\nThe men that kidnapped Matyev drove up to him in a black van, speeding up along the foreshore. They jumped out of the still moving vehicle, three of them, masked in black and wielding batons. They were upon him before he realised what was happening, hitting him in the stomach and head so hard he passed out. When he came to, he found himself tied to a chair, his head throbbing and caked in dry blood. Directly across from him sat one of his kidnappers, his mask removed to reveal neat fair hair atop an angular, stern face. He spoke a phrase Matyev did not understand in Finnish to somebody behind, and suddenly he felt the cold steel of a gun against the back of his head.\n\nMatyev realised he was already dead. The man across from him would still be wearing his mask if they were not planning to kill him.\n\n"Slavik Matyev," the man opposite said, beginning what Matyev knew was his death sentence. "As per the Emergency Military Protocol of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard of Onega..."\n\nMatyev stopped listening, the droning of his executioner drowned out by a torrent of thoughts. Who had ratted him out? Probably that bastard Kalle. He had known that Matyev was a supporter of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Fuck. He should have been more careful. He should have just crossed the border and joined the Red Army like he had thought about so many times. Too late now. At least he could try to die with some dignity.\n\n"Would you shut up already?" he said, interrupting his executioner."

 ONG.6.t: "Guarding the City"
 ONG.6.desc: "Dimitri stood outside the armory and took out his lighter. The streets of Onega were quiet as he looked up at the overcast clouds. His job was to make sure no bandits or criminals broke into the armory. Of course, no bandit would ever be crazy enough to try and attack Onega. It would be suicide.\n\nSo most days Dimitri spent watching the people walk by, and on the off chance anyone else had to enter the armory, he got to talk to them. He used to have to ask for their authorization, but not anymore. He still remembered the day where he had a great time beating up one person who tried to break in. Of course, they were an important government official and didn't need to be authorized, but it was still worth it. So currently, his job was pointless. But if he got paid, he didn't care.\n\nDimitri put his lighter away and thought of home. Or at least, what was left of it. After the bandits raided his farm and murdered his parents, he had no home to go back to. That's when he joined the Volunteer Guard. Although, he didn't expect to have to sit outside frivolous places like barracks full of guards or a secure armory in the safest place in all of Onega. Why wasn't Dimitri allowed to get his revenge and have a little fun? The rest of the guard was busy hunting bandits while he had to enforce order and wait for the bandits to come to him. While it might not be fair, at least they gave him a home here.\n\nDmitri waited for the end of his shift which was still five hours away. Perhaps one day he won't have to stand here for hours and stare at the other building across from him. At least a cat came by once in a while that he got to pet. But who knows, there was always the chance he could be called in to attack some bandit hideout in some random forest. Hopefully, he would get his chance."
 ONG.6.a: "Who knew joining the Volunteer Guard would be so boring?"

 ONG.7.t: "Investigating the Cargo"
 ONG.7.desc: "All was quiet on the dark road outside the checkpoint. Barely anyone used this road, just the occasional transport truck heading to the nearby food storage and, even more rarely, someone that could actually afford a car in this god forsaken hellhole. It was just another day for Andrei, searching each vehicle that came through for smuggled weapons. Not much activity had been through today though.\n\nA few hours passed and a truck finally came to a stop at the checkpoint. The chief officer, Grigori, walked over to the driver as Andrei went to the back of the truck. Just another search. However, it was a bit strange for a supply truck to arrive at this time of night. They must be really behind schedule.\n\nThe driver kept arguing they didn't need a search, and they were already authorized to bypass this checkpoint. After too many complaints of them being late and that the food was going to spoil, Grigori gave up on the search and walked back to the checkpoint to let the barrier up. But that was against protocol. All vehicles needed to be searched by the checkpoint before they were allowed through. Andrei knew something seemed off about this.\n\nWary but unsure if it meant anything, Andrei took matters into his own hands and forced open the back of the truck. Three distinct human shapes were visible in the darkness, but before he could figure out who they were, a shot rang through his ears and a scream came from Grigori. Something swung towards his vision before he could react, and everything went black."

 ONG.8.t: "The Old Equipment Recovered"
 ONG.8.desc: "After an assault on a bandit hideout, we have captured a cache full of equipment before the bandits could escape. Our troops were able to recover multiple weapons and support equipment that will prove very useful for keeping our men armed and ready to fight. While not the finest of guns, they're better than nothing.\n\nPerhaps one day we won't need to rely on scavenged weapons and barely functioning rifles from Finland, but now is not that time. We need to make do with what we have, or the communists could break through Lake Onega in a day."

These bandits have been terrifying countless settlements and we believe them to hold communist sympathies. Our Guard should have no problem warding off these bandits but it is still critical we keep the railroad secure.\n\nThe railroad that could be attacked is our most important connection between Finland and Onega. It is how the Finnish are able to send us supplies and manpower, and the only suitable route to send troops through quickly. If it is damaged we could face serious consequences. The Guard must not let that happen.\n\nMultiple bases have been set up along the railroad and guards have been sent to secure the stations. We could also set up sniper positions atop areas we think they may strike. It might also be a good idea to place troops on the trains just in case. The bandits will never make it past our defenses. No more ambushes this time."
 ONG.9.a: "They will not let us down."

 ONG.10.t: "Assaulting the Hideout"
 ONG.10.desc: "It was a cloudy and windy day as the Volunteer Guard moved into their positions. The bandit hideout stood just up on top of a hill, overlooking a small lake. At first it was unassuming, just another home on top of a hill. But the guard knew, it was chock full of bandits. It was strange to see them just out in the open like this, almost as if they are waiting to be attacked. Shouldn't they be living underground in some dark and grimy cave instead of this beautiful, large white house? They should at least be smart enough to hide and lay low, but perhaps these ones aren't too bright. After all, bandits usually aren't the smartest.\n\nA shocking charge would do the trick, those bandits would surely be outnumbered. Once every man stood ready, the assault commenced. More than a hundred Volunteer Guards charged up the hill and the slaughter began. Machine gun bullets rained upon the attacking troops from positions in the windows of the house, striking them down as if they were little toy soldiers a child would play with and flick them over with their finger. This was supposed to be just another hideout with a few careless bandits with hunting rifles. Not a well-armed fortress full of bandits with large machinegun nests. How did the bandits have this type of weaponry? Not even Onega's garrisons are this well-equipped.\n\nAlmost as quickly as they had begun charging up the hill, the brave Volunteer Guard was fleeing down in terror. But it wouldn't end there, even as the Volunteers reached the bottom it went on. The barrage of bullets wouldn't end until they made it back to their camp, exhausted and covered in blood.\n\nThe dead and missing were accounted for and the Guard finally got a chance to rest. Later that night a communication was sent out to the next regiment commander.\n\n"We failed again, the soldiers acted more like scared little girls than fearless men. It's your turn now. They might have a weak spot towards the south, towards the lake. Fewer windows there. I just wish we could get some artillery here and bomb them to smithereens.""

While not enough to form an entire division, this still gives us a good amount of manpower to work with. This is about the number we were expecting to sign up, and anything to help our manpower shortage is greatly appreciated.\n\nTheir advanced training will begin shortly after we can get them all organized. Hopefully, they will fight just as valiantly for their motherland and against communism as the regulars do."

Still, it's better than nothing.\n\nWe need to make sure they are trained and organized well. They could become very useful as we will need to replace our losses.

The amount that joined could almost form an entire division!

 ONG.16.desc: "The door to the modest cottage flew open as a dozen Volunteer Guards rushed in. Desks, chairs, tables, all were knocked down in the search. No bandit was found. Only some broken bottles, a few guns, and some bullets. If there had been bandits here, they were long gone by now. They were too late.\n\nAlthough there is still something of use in the cottage. A certain someone, in fact. The woman that lived here lies crying on the floor. She could definitely serve a purpose. She has to know some secrets of those bandits. Perhaps she even knows another hideout's location. The woman might not have been cooperating fully with the bandits, but there were obvious signs that bandits had been here for a while. She could have been forced into housing them, but we have no time for empathy while bandits run wild.\n\nHopefully she'll be willing to answer our questions. She may need a little coercion, but by the end of the day, the Guard will know exactly where to go next."

 ONG.17.t: "Cleaning Up the Cave"
 ONG.17.desc: "This is it, the Guard has finally gotten their chance. Almost all the hideouts have finally been located, and the bandits' numbers continue to thin. This was one of the last major hideouts that had not already fallen to the Guard. It was almost a cave, dug into the earth and hidden with branches and leaves. To be honest, it was a pretty good hideout. It had taken forever to track down, even with directions on how to find it. But with the Volunteer Guard finally outside, those poor bandits had no idea what was coming for them.\n\nThe elite Volunteer Guard broke through the barriers before the bandits even knew what hit them. The Guard had learned a lot about the bandits, spending so long hunting them down that every volunteer was an expert in the bandit's tactics. Clumsy bandits had no chance compared to the best Volunteers in Russia.\n\nWithin a few minutes almost every bandit was either dead or captured, with few Guard casualties. Even more good news, the men recovered many stolen goods the bandits had captured. Money, personal belongings, and expensive commodities are now in the hands of Onega's best. Our leadership has to decide what to do with it all, give it back to the people, or keep it for ourselves. That is, of course, whatever the Guards don't decide to keep.\n\nBut for now, let's celebrate one of the first of many victories to come over the bandits. No more ambushes, no more dead Guards, and no more burning homes."

I am proud to announce that, not only has this process been completely smooth and was executed as intended, but that as per the latest results, I, Vladimir Kirpichnikov, have been elected as the first President of the country.\n\nThe candidates to have run in the presidential race were many, reflecting the open and diverse political climate cultivated here. With a difference of more than eight percent, the Republican Party of the Russian North has won, and as its head I will be inaugurated as President. I wish to thank you all for your political participation, and I promise to you that you will not regret this vote.\n\nI have stood for the Republic since its foundation, ever since we set foot on the banks of the Onega River and began the struggle for liberty. The Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard has made a valiant effort to liberate the region, and now that it has succeeded, the people seem to have considered its leader as a fit candidate for President. With these powers, it will be my first priority to uphold the principles of democracy that we fought for, and to begin the reconstruction of Northern Russia. Once again, it has been an honour.""

 ONG.19.t: "What Makes a Man?"
 ONG.19.desc: "Vladimir Kirpichnikov stood in his frigid capital of Onega, overlooking one of the many barracks within the town reserved for the troops of his Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard. The Guard had been his work - the creation, organization, and recruitment of soldiers into it; it certainly hadn't been an easy task. Truthfully, ever since his capture and imprisonment by the Finns, Kirpichnikov had missed organizing and commanding troops.\n\nBut even then, with the "gift" that they had bestowed upon him, he was reminded of the true nature of his post. He was well-aware of his being little more than a pawn to the interests of Helsinki. And he was just as aware that his actions in Onega and beyond had been more than mildly authoritarian. He was a military dictator, simply put, and one propped up by the Finnish government at that. It was a position that caused him great ambivalence; on one hand, he could protect those within his fiefdom and serve the interests of Karelian Russians. On the other, he only did so as a means to Finnish ends, and any dissension - especially from communist elements, wasn't tolerated. The stern look on Kirpichnikov's face as he looked down on his Volunteer Guard training betrayed few of the emotions that he felt. Ultimately, the ex-Soviet general thought to himself, his position as leader of the Guard wasn't one that sat right with him in his gut.\n\nA trumped up dictator based out of the small timber town of Onega was hardly a fitting or prestigious legacy for a Soviet commander. But Kirpichnikov had little love lost for the Soviets, under Bukharin but even more so under the military rule of Alexander Yegorov, who had treated the Russian people with all manners of cruelty during the German invasion. Snapped out of his thoughts by a subordinate's call, he banished his ambivalence to the background of his mind and began his weekly inspection."
 ONG.19.a: ""Alright, let's begin.""

 ONG.20.t: "A Faint Hope"
 ONG.20.desc: "The board within Vladimir Kirpichnikov's humble office was filled with maps, all of which were covered in drawings - offensive lines, fallback lines, predicted encirclements. If one was not well-versed in the reality of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard's situation vis-à-vis manpower and equipment, one would think that Kirpichnikov was preparing a real offensive eastwards. Unfortunately, most of what Kirpichnikov had drawn up was entirely unrealistic. His more cynical commanders would even suggest to one another, well out of earshot of their leader, that his planned offensives were little more than pure fantasy.\n\nBut what was the man to do, if not wargame? His Guard ran on autopilot - the result of his nurturing a strong and relatively independent command structure, and Kirpichnikov had never been a micromanager anyhow. But, as the leader of the Finnish satellite state often reminded himself, the Finns had promised him something: his freedom, and the freedom of a subsequent government, if he was able to take Arkhangelsk and end the West Russian Revolutionary Front once and for all.\n\nPerhaps it was the general's old guilt and ambivalence that translated into his ambition to take the city and end the Soviet remnant once and for all, thought many of his subordinates. To a degree, they were right. None of the Volunteer Guard's officer corps had any love for the Finns. But what the officers didn't know, is that Kirpichnikov was more motivated by a hope for redemption, rather than by guilt. Oftentimes, late at night, when sleep eluded the aging general, he would walk, in the cold night air and without any guards, to his office, and look over his plans, imagining the aftermath of his fictional victory. It was during one of these nights that, despite his ambivalence for his own role and weariness regarding the Soviets, he resolved that he would beat them or die trying."

 ONG.21.t: "Old Comrades"
 ONG.21.desc: "Kirpichnikov read the telegram he had received. And then he read it again. Looking up at the aide who had brought him the news, the first words out of his mouth were not what the aide expected. "How the hell are we hearing this from Helsinki, and not our own people?" the aide didn't have an answer - he, nor anyone else, had the heart to tell the general that the Volunteer Guard's spy network in the Front was notoriously ineffective. "Regardless," Kirpichnikov began, rubbing his right temple with his hand. "This news is... Yegorov... dead..." the general's mouth stretched downwards as he became lost in thought.\n\nThe pair of men had once been comrades, serving the Union and her people alongside one another. Things had been different then, Kirpichnikov reminded himself. But that didn't stop the general from reminiscing about his past, when he fought for, rather than against, the Soviet system. He barely muttered "dismissed" to the aide as he looked down at the neat typeface on the telegram. As he heard his office door shut, he reached down in his desk and opened a drawer, carefully pulling out a neatly-wrapped cloth. Unfolding it revealed a creased picture, well-worn with time. Kirpichnikov gently took the picture and unfolded it. Kirpichnikov could still make out the faces, the smiles. His one comrade waving at the camera. It was just after he had been named commander of the 43rd Rifle Division.\n\nHe looked at the photo for what must have been ten minutes, reliving the moment. The photo had begun to fade, but the memory was as crisp in Kirpichnikov's head as if it had happened just the day prior. The happiness he had felt, the sense of accomplishment. Things he hadn't felt for quite some time. Yegorov's passing may have presented both an opportunity and a change in the Guard's strategies, but Kirpichnikov decided that all of that could wait for one day."

 ONG.22.t: "Revolting Reminder"
 ONG.22.desc: ""What the hell is this?" the leader of the Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard yelled at the aide who had the misfortune of delivering the telegram to him. Kirpichnikov was red in the face, an unusual departure from his normal, calm-and-collected affect.\n\n"It's... it's a telegram, sir, from Helsinki." the aide responded, nearly shaking from nerves.\n\n"I know what it is... it was a rhetorical question." Kirpichnikov said, his anger quickly depleting. "Get out of here." he dismissed the aide in an abnormal, unprofessional fashion. "Damned Finns. How do they expect me to handle this?" The Finnish government had expelled another three villages' worth of Karelian Russians to his territory to make room for more Finnish settlers. As more Russian refugees arrived in Onega, they brought with them almost nothing, and needed a lot in return. Food, shelter, water, all things that were in short supply in the town of Onega and what little territory Kirpichnikov controlled. He cared for the refugees, as he would any Russian. But the rate at which the Finns were shoving them into his territory was becoming unsustainable. He sat at his desk and began typing at his typewriter. Angry letters, all capitals, addressed to the Finnish government and the head of the army enforcing the deportations, Karl Lennart Oesch.\n\nBut as he typed, Kirpichnikov's anger slowly left him. He was brought back to the days of his imprisonment, and the way the Finns had treated him. He remembered his personal "chats" with Oesch, at that time a mere general in the Finnish army. One memory burned brighter than most: Kirpichnikov had been starved for days, only being given food after posing for a photograph - lighting Oesch's cigarette. A coup d'état for Finnish propaganda. He couldn't go back to that. Ripping the page from his typewriter, he crumpled it up, and went to work finding resources for the refugees he couldn't support."

 ONG.23.t: "Old Wounds"
 ONG.23.desc: "Nikolai Omelin knew that there had been something familiar about this place. Standing in the ruins of the hospital in Sharya, not far from Vyakta, the old general looked down at the floor. Good God, was it really? Nikolai nudged some rubble with his boot, overturning the masonry to reveal the ash and dust covered tiles beneath. His eyes grew wide, it was! The hexagonal tilework with its alternating blue, yellow, and white hexes brought him decades back. He remembered clutching a shattered wrist, a wound from a Nazi bullet, his guts held in by his belt. Barbarossa had just begun, and Omelin's battalion had been rolled over by panzers, his comrades killed or scattered. Nikolai continued to walk the halls, listening to the stutter of jackhammers and the whining of drills.\n\nHe remembered the pretty nurse who helped stuff his entrails back in, the buzz of the lights and the shouts of the surgeons. A miracle, they had told him, almost impossible that he was alive. Young Nikolai should have been grateful, ecstatic, but he could only remember staring at those damn floor tiles.\n\nStrange, that fate had brought him back here. Strange, too, that his gut and wrist squirmed with remembered phantom pain. As the men of Onega worked to bring the bombed hospital back to working order, Omelin looked out west, towards where Germany lay. Such death and horror had spewed forth from Berlin, and it could again. Nikolai Omelin swore that such a nightmarish tide would never reach Russia again."

The pages tickled his calloused pads as the leaves slid under his hands, a thoughtful expression settling on his face. The dates above each entry were written in smudged black ink, reading from 1917 to 1922, a lifetime ago. Pyotr stopped on a random page, his old eyes flicking back and forth as he read. A smile crept over his creased face.\n\nThe entry in question described Pyotr's adventure deep into Red territory with his one-time companion, the spy Paul Dukes. Pyotr and the Brit had gotten along famously, and the two had embarked on numerous missions against the hated Bolshevik menace. Those had been days of heroism and daring, both thrilling and invigorating in equal measure.\n\nPyotr sighed, letting out a cloud of pipe smoke as he did so. He wondered what his old friend had been doing all these years. Was he a collaborator in the English government? Perhaps a brave freedom fighter in HMMLR? Who could say?\n\nPyotr eyed the journal in his hands. It was a shame to let such exciting tales go to waste in the mind of an old man. When this was all over, Pyotr resolved to himself, he would write a book about his adventures with the spy. Why not? He had all the information he needed in the book resting in his hands."

Whatever it had been, it was not what he had found.\n\nDespite the length of time he had served with the Volunteer Guard, he had not returned home in years, despite Povenets' location just over the Finnish border. In terms of appearance, he recognized much. The hill itself, of course, the spire of the town church, the strange wall that one of the more eccentric residents had built to 'protect' his garden from children such as himself.\n\nBut he quickly found that he no longer recognized the people. The eccentric resident was gone. As was nearly everyone else he remembered. Confused, he had demanded answers of those encountered, and in short order discovered the reason why he no longer knew his hometown's inhabitants. They had been, nearly to a one, replaced.\n\nSince his last visit, the Finns had displaced the Russians in Povenets, including his own friends and family, that had lived there since time immemorial. In their place were Finnish settlers, encouraged by their government to venture into Karelia and further secure it for their Republic.\n\nOmelin had been struck nearly speechless, and unsure of how to respond, had departed shortly thereafter. During the return journey to Onega however, he quickly found himself unable to feel anything other than disgust. Was this what he had been fighting for? So that Onega's 'protectors' could colonize it?\n\nAnd if it was, what could he even hope to do about it?"

 ONG.50.desc: "The foundation of the Anti-Communist Guard as a whole was built on the principle of safeguarding a corner of Russia from the evils of communism and radicalism. For years, we simply rested on the west bank of the Onega, protected by the Finns and safe from the wars of the region. That was, until the Guard was forcibly dragged into conflict when the rising power in West Russia decided it was time to show its power by invading us, and Finland as well. They thought victory was certain, but they were wrong.\n\nSoldiers of the Volunteer Guard march in Arkhangelsk, Vologda and Syktyvkar. The previous overlords of West Russia are no more, their leaders and generals having fled amidst the chaos. Now, it is up to us to pick up the pieces in the region, and create a new order clean of Bolshevik autocracy. As our men restore order and hunt down bandits in the war-ravaged territories that have fallen under our control, General Kirpichnikov has made a symbolic gesture and declared the North Russian Republic. From Arkhangelsk, the former stronghold of the WRRF, he made an address where he formally announced the creation of this state and made promises for reforms and democracy.\n\nIn the lands further from Onega in the south, imposing our control has been more difficult. Instead of struggling to do that and draining resources, satellite states have been established. Those deemed loyal to our cause have been placed as the warlords of these states, and it is their job to keep them under control."

The leading power just east of the Urals, in their quest to reunify the nation invaded us with everything they had. Yet, much like in the first war we waged in, the bulwark of republicanism engaged victorious, and yet another warlord state has been defeated.\n\nIn the place of West Siberia's authority, a new administration has been set up. Of course, the North Russian Republic has annexed some of the lands reclaimed, but the army is stretched to its absolute limit at the moment. Following the tried and successful system implemented in West Russia, the territories we are unable or unwilling to directly control have been placed under a number of puppet administrations.

Lavrov was a career military man, better suited to the front lines than the diplomatic service, but with the consolidation of the suddenly expanded territory of the NRR and as the commander of the North Russian Republic forces in the area, he was all they had on hand.\n\nLavrov had been in talks with the new leader of the Free City for hours now and, while they had made great strides in negotiating a treaty between the City and the NRR, the long negotiations were starting to wear thin for the both of them. Multiple times throughout the day Lavrov had thought of breaking off the talks and simply ordering his men to secure the city, but had held himself in check. Mostly because of the stiff resistance the populace would put up. Similarly, Katushev came close to calling things off multiple times by now.\n\nFinally, after a long lunch, Lavrov and Katushev presided over the signing of a treaty that would ensure the Free City's autonomy and mutual defense against outside aggression.

Ibragim was eager to secure a future for the people of the Republic, but he was very hesitant to put the lives of his people in the hands of those same men who repressed them in the old days. At the same time, he knew that the Tatar Republic could not survive alone.\n\n"Mr. Alexeevich, our talks have been very fruitful thus far, but before we continue I would like certain assurances," Ibragim was insistent. The talks had gone on for three hours by that point and, though much progress had been made, the hesitancy of the NRR to commit fully to Tatar autonomy gave him pause.\n\n"Name your terms, my friend. I will do everything in my power to see them done," Alexeevich was serious, not necessarily because of any high ideals but for the defense of Russia from extremist forces.\n\n"There must be assurances that your government will not attempt to infringe on Tatar autonomy. If they cannot, then all we have done here is waste our time."\n\n"I will do all that I can to see that your terms are met, you have my word," the bureaucrat said.

Alexandr was quick to take advantage of the engineer's naivety and inexperience in order to craft terms favorable to the NRR. Though the treaty that came from Ivanov's underhanded tactics was a somewhat plain grab for influence in the region, it still afforded the Assembly protection from threats to its sovereignty and ensured that they were insulated against untoward influence - aside from NRR influence, of course.\n\nAfter an hour of schmoozing, Viktor and his supporters were convinced on the contents of the treaty. With the swipe of a pen, the People's Assembly of Samara was afforded the protection of the North Russian Republic.\n\nOver the course of the next week, Alexsandr would ingratiate himself with Viktor and his people, promising shipments of luxury goods unseen in Samara for years.

You simply must take this gift." The Prince of Vyatka was a magnanimous man if one didn't test him, and he knew how to get what he wanted. Colonel Zyklov, the representative from Onega, came to Vyatka prepared to grant concessions, but he had been taken in by the Prince's charms. As a result, Boris was able to weasel more and more concessions from the Republic.\n\n"If you insist, your highness." The Colonel knew he was out of his depth. He had grown up in Onega and been fast-tracked to service with the Anti-Communist Guard. His whole life had been dedicated to fighting the Communists, with little thought to politics, of all things.

In the chaos of the West Russian War he had volunteered with the Finnish military to beat back the communists, and afterwards he had settled in Onega with the Anti-Communist Guard. Now, he put his education in the diplomatic arena to good use for his new homeland.\n\nOver the course of the next week, William and the recently elected leader of the Republic, Yakov Elizarovich Panteleyev, negotiated a treaty of trade and mutual assistance. Though Panteleyev had little experience in the political arena, he held his own. Foremost he held the interests of his people in mind, and had contested any terms that looked to shackle the Udmurt people.\n\nAt the end of the day, the North Russian Republic and the Udmurt Republic wanted the same thing, at least in the short term. It was a simple matter to ensure the sovereignty of the Udmurt Republic, as the situation in West Russia precluded any consolidated conquest of the region, and the Republic would become yet another member of the alliance network that would, hopefully, keep West Russia at peace.\n\nIn the aftermath of the treaty signing, William would find that he quite liked the people of Izhevsk.

His counterpart was a local man by the name of Faizrakhman Zagafuranov. He had been a supporter of Bashkir rights in the Soviet bureaucracy and had seemed a perfect choice for the North Russian Republic to place in charge of the reformed Republic. In Yuri's opinion the man did not deserve to shine his shoes, much less lead a secessionist party in rightful Russian lands.\n\nThe negotiations would last for a whole week before real progress was made, as the experienced bureaucrat pushed in just the right places. For much of the negotiations, Yuri refused to entertain the possibility of anything less than full subordination of the Bashkirs under the NRR. The very idea of Russian land under the control of Muslim dogs made his skin crawl.\n\nIn the end, Yuri would be escorted out of the building by his own guards, spewing racial slurs and demanding the annexation of the Bashkir lands. After a phone call from the NRR's headquarters, he was released from duty. In his place was an ethnic Bashkir who was much more amenable to the terms put forward by Zagafuranov. It would take only three more days for the treaty to be signed, and the Bashkir people were once again secure in their independence."

In truth, the sight of his childhood home in such a state was almost enough to bring Colonel Ivan Smirnov to tears.\n\nWhen the motorcade pulled up to the central government building in Perm, an imitation of the wasteful Volkshalle in Germania, he saw the first glimmer of hope for his old home. There, waiting at the end of the steps leading into the building, was a surly man who he had known for years. "Alexander, you old bastard! You're still alive!?" were the first words out of Ivan's mouth as he stepped out of his car. Ivan had known Alexander for years.

Last I remember, you would have sooner charged head first into German lines before becoming an officer!"\n\n"Times change, my friend, times change." It was true, in the old days he hated the officers more than anything, and yet here he was. A dedicated officer to a new Russian state.\n\n"All too true. Come, my friend. We have much to discuss.
