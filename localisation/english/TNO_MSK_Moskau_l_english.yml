One cell's destruction may cause the prison that is Moskowien to be §Jdestroyed§! - or for something much more §ecatastrophic§! to take place. Only §CDestiny§! knows how it will end."

msk_news_moskau_disturbance.1.desc: "Despite what little information the German Reichskommissariat Moskowien lets out of its borders, the news about its most recent failures in governance have spread well beyond the borders of the Einheitspakt.\n\nIvan Vorobyov, a former Red Army soldier and German collaborator turned partisan escaped from Moskowien's Lipetsk Prison in a bold breakout staged by unidentified forces. The broader Lipetsk region, formerly a hotbed of resistance, has since experienced a dramatic rise in insurgent activity, with many other regions reporting similar issues. Siegfried Kasche, the Reichskommissar of Moskowien, has already made several executive orders to quell the spread of disorder using his signature "methods". Germania has refused to comment.\n"

msk_news_moskau_dissapearance.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Moskowien's Dissolution"
msk_news_moskau_dissapearance.1.desc: "The death of Adolf Hitler has not yet ceased in causing havoc across the entirety of the Einheitspakt. Its furthermost eastern part, Reichskommissariat Moskowien, endured the crisis independent of its overlord for more than a month, however Hitler's conquests could not outlive him for long.\n\nCollected reports indicate that Siegfried Kasche, the Reichskommissar of Moskowien, has ceased his administrative duties as leader of the colony - the control over the systems of governance is, thus, in the state of a severe power vacuum. The sudden loss of central authority is already being labeled "Moskowien's Dissolution" by various media sources. Whatever the outcome of this "Dissolution", it does not seem that the 20-year old status quo will be restored by its end.\n"
