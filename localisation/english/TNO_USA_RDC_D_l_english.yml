 USA_lbj_64_the_johnson_presidency: "The Johnson Presidency"
 USA_lbj_64_the_johnson_presidency_desc: "After more than a year of hard campaigning, from the primaries to the general election, President Lyndon Baines Johnson sits in the Oval Office. Campaigning under bold claims of a "great society", he plans to reshape America by any means necessary. These planned reforms represent the continuation of Kennedy's torch of progressivism, and will truly change the fabric of the nation, with sweeping Civil Rights legislation, medicare for all, and ending the poverty-stricken state of much of the country. In addition, Johnson also claims he will improve the military, reforming it into a fighting machine fit for the modern world.\n\nHowever, before he can begin his planned cascade of reforms to change the fabric of American society, he must gain the nation's trust. In his inaugural address, Johnson will bring the entire country up to speed on his plans, and their future."
 USA_lbj_64_mistakes_of_nixon: "The Mistakes of Nixon"
 USA_lbj_64_mistakes_of_nixon_desc: "President Nixon's administration was, for lack of a better term, disastrous. During his term, the South African War began, Civil Rights came to a head, and the United States suffered the worst presidential scandal in its short history. After his resignation, and still during his term, his successor, John F. Kennedy, was assassinated. If Johnson is to gain the trust of the public back towards not only himself but the Republican-Democratic Coalition as a whole, he must assure the people that these issues will be solved. Assurances that the America will win her foreign entanglements, that full equality of the races achieved, and that no scandal or corruption will occur."
 USA_lbj_64_legacy_of_kennedy: "The Legacy of Kennedy"
 USA_lbj_64_legacy_of_kennedy_desc: "The Kennedy Presidency, though tragically cut short, represented possibly the best the Republican-Democrats could be. His few, short, optimistic months were possibly the most important in determining the future of not just the RDC, but America as a whole. Just as we admonish the mistakes of Nixon, if the RDC is to survive in its current state, we must also continue the legacy of Kennedy. President Johnson will carry Kennedy's torch of progressivism and unity until America is whole once more."
 USA_lbj_64_forwards_together: "Forwards Together"
 USA_lbj_64_forwards_together_desc: "It's time we move forward together! The pains of the past decades, with our humiliation and distrust that our citizens have with the government must come to an end. This country needs to better take care of its citizens and in order to do that, we must endeavor to bring forth a program to help all Americans and further unite our country into a greater society. A greater society that helps Americans of all classes, colors, and convictions so they do not suffer because of conditions that are not always in their control. Onwards!"
 USA_lbj_64_secure_congress_support: "Secure Congressional Support"
 USA_lbj_64_secure_congress_support_desc: "In order for our Great Society program to pass, we need Congress. We must secure votes in the House and the Senate in order to get this massive bill to the President's desk. Let's formulate a strategy in order to secure those votes. We can possibly use the bully pulpit on our own party to bring our more indecisive allies to vote. Or we can make deals with some of the more moderate members of the NPP to get this bill passed. Either way, let's secure needed backing to achieve success."
 USA_lbj_64_on_our_own: "On Our Own"
 USA_lbj_64_on_our_own_desc: "We have the majority in Congress. Let's use it! The party needs to be whipped up. We can promise some of our more moderate members to support this bill, as long as we get some compromise pork billing in place. It will more likely lose us some votes in the South if we get the Great Society bill to pass, but that's what it will take if it means true reform. The good news as well that the NPP will not be able to stop this bill as long as our party remains united in the face of obstruction. The downside is, the NPP can pick up more conservative members of our electorate after we secure our congressional majority to pass this bill."
 USA_lbj_64_deal_with_center: "A Deal with the Progressives"
 USA_lbj_64_deal_with_center_desc: "Let's face it, we don't have the majority amongst our own party to pass this bill. It looks worrisome. However we are lucky that the NPP is divided between the Nationalists, Progressives, and several even more extreme wings. We should be able to make a deal with the Progressive faction to break ranks against the rest of the NPP to support this bill. We will just have to give them some minor compromises. The downfall with compromising with members of the NPP, is that portions of our own electorate might defect to the NPP because many of our more moderate members will see this as an affront to stable American values."
 USA_lbj_64_shut_up_and_help_me: "For the Good of America"
 USA_lbj_64_shut_up_and_help_me_desc: "We've corralled everyone we can to work with us - Republicans, Democrats, even the opposition in the NPP. If we're all working for the betterment of America, then we should all be on board with finer education, reducing poverty, improving healthcare, and ensuring freedom in our land. We've made our case to the Congress - now they need to get with the program, for the good of America!"
 USA_lbj_64_lay_groundwork: "Lay the Groundwork"
 USA_lbj_64_lay_groundwork_desc: "Policy analysts, researchers, economists, and public administrators who have had experience in running domestic programs will be needed in order to prepare the greatest reform in American history. We must gather all of them to start hammering out the policy alongside the various political committees working in Congress. Let us make sure we have a bill worth fighting for!"
 USA_lbj_64_introduce_concept: "Introduce the Concept"
 USA_lbj_64_introduce_concept_desc: "Next, we must start introducing the idea of our Great Society bill to the public. We must explain to them that our ideal goal is in reforming our country to make it more fair for all Americans. We must show them that we ideally want to make every American wealthier, happier, and more freer in their lives. Our introduction will start in major universities, then major cities, then massive venues to make people excited for our Great Society Bill. The people must feel excited in order for public support to rise."
 USA_lbj_64_form_task_forces: "Form Task Forces"
 USA_lbj_64_form_task_forces_desc: "Then, we must study the entirety of American society in detail. We need to look through every single aspect, from education, poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, welfare, the arts, and so forth. We must also compare these aspects and pair our plans with our current budget to adjust accordingly. Once our studies are over, all the data we accrued can be used to complete the final formulation to perfect the Great Society Bill."
 USA_lbj_64_the_great_society: "The Great Society"
 USA_lbj_64_the_great_society_desc: "My fellow Americans, as your President, I want to announce the beginning of a new era. The past 30 years since our fall from greatness has been marked by continued disappointment, with the past weaknesses that the United States has shown to our people and the world. Americans in those past years had become more poor, sick, hungry, angry, resentful, and in embarrassment over our government's continued failures to help the American people prosper. Even with foreign threats from the swastika, it has been no excuse for the past neglect that administrations before us had shown. But despite our struggles in the past, today is a different day. Today marks a new day in American society. A day in which more Americans can get out of the miseries of poverty and are able to join the workforce to better secure freedom and liberty. A day in which the worries of the sick and suffering can be soothed by medical coverage that is given for future health and merriment. A day in which all peoples within this country can pursue happiness. Overall, the American people can prosper forever more with the signing of the Great Society Bill. Our Great Society program will enhance the lives of every single American and make sure their needs are taken care of.\n-President Lyndon B Johnson"
 USA_lbj_64_more_civil_rights: "Expand Civil Rights"
 USA_lbj_64_more_civil_rights_desc: "Now it's time to turn our attention to our fellow Americans who have long been suffering under oppression. The hateful groups that cause this misery for them would align with our enemy if our country was ever invaded and occupied by them. Thus we must be vigilant and ready to fight for our black population. African-Americans must be free in all aspects in order to combat extremism, and we will make sure that our African-American population is free in all ways possible."
 USA_lbj_64_vote_in_hand: "A Vote in Hand"
 USA_lbj_64_vote_in_hand_desc: "If we are to ensure the future success of our party in the face of extremism from the NPP, we must court and assist the African-American community in making sure they are able to vote in every election. So many Southern States within the union are still doing everything they can, such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and even mass lynchings to prevent African-Americans from exercising their right to vote. We must put an end to this crime of oppression that we as party have allowed to fester for so long. If our party supports the Black American, Black Americans will happy, and loyal to the Republican-Democratic Coalition in future elections."
 USA_lbj_64_outlaw_literacy_tests: "Outlawing Literacy Tests"
 USA_lbj_64_outlaw_literacy_tests_desc: "Literacy tests have been around since the 1890s, and have made sure that Afro-Americans could not vote because of this demand from various state governments to have them recite the entire Constitution and be able to read great classics that not even any poor Southern white man ever was required to do. Even though it is important for the American population to be able to read to be more informative of who to vote for, this entire practice has only been used to disenfranchise Afro-Americans in the South, and secure the continued vote of extremists who wish to ruin the American way of life. Let's write a provision that will ban these tests in the bill once and for all."
 USA_lbj_64_special_provisions: "Defining "Special Provisions""
 USA_lbj_64_special_provisions_desc: "The Voting Rights Act can possibly contain several other provisions that make sure that various Southern States are unable to pass changes to voting laws that can disenfranchise and prevent Afro-Americans from voting. Those states would require federal approval for voting law changes. This would secure more of the black vote for the Republican-Democratic Coalition, however, the optics would be bad for some of our Democrat colleagues who represent Southerners who are loyal to our party. Implementing these special provisions would most likely enrage white Southerners who vote for our party and have them possibly switch to the NPP instead. It's up to us to decide if we really wanna secure black votes while possibly losing our white Southerner base in the South."
 USA_lbj_64_voting_rights_act: "The Voting Rights Act"
 USA_lbj_64_voting_rights_act_desc: "The Voting Rights Act is ready to be passed! This bill will be a landmark piece of legislation that will free more of our American people from legal oppression. Our bill will protect voting rights for all Americans, including whites and racial minorities of all colors! Literacy tests, poll taxes, various punishing clauses, and other forms of discriminatory racism within our electoral process will be eliminated. Many white Americans in the South will rage, but we will push forward, we will become a stronger union, and we will become a stronger and better people as a result. Many states will resist, but those states will submit to federal law. Our country cannot waver in the face of racism and bigotry and we will make sure of it! For a better future for all!"
 USA_lbj_64_once_more_unto_the_breach: "Once More Unto The Breach"
 USA_lbj_64_once_more_unto_the_breach_desc: "Businesses and public facilities within the South will follow our new laws. I don't care how much they will cry and scream of federal 'oppression', they will not prevent blacks and other minorities from being able to access businesses for needed purchases, and public facilities for needed assistance in their daily lives. I will personally send federal observers, and if necessary: the National Guard to enforce the law if I have no choice. Time to use the bully pulpit on these states."
 USA_lbj_64_beacon_in_darkness: "A Beacon in the Darkness"
 USA_lbj_64_beacon_in_darkness_desc: "Our country should be a beacon of light for more people that want freedom from the boots of fascism and Nazism. The rejected individuals, who often end up enslaved or killed, must be saved! We should be loosening restrictions within our current immigration system to make it easier for immigrants to enter this country and work hard to become American citizens. We should be careful though in how we implement it, to make sure the process doesn't become chaotic and possibly harm country. Opening the floodgates might help so many people, but it might allow Nazi spies to easily enter. On the other hand, if we still remain too restrictive, we alienate more people still. Let's make sure we pick the right solution."
 USA_lbj_64_reshuffle_police_forces: "Reshuffle Police Forces"
 USA_lbj_64_reshuffle_police_forces_desc: "State and local police forces within the various troublemaking states in the South will make sure federal and newer state laws are enforced. The past enforced ignorance of the law, as well as the encouragement of police brutality against Afro-Americans from our local and state police is outright criminal. This oppression will be dismantled. I will personally send federal investigators to have police departments either change their act themselves, or force the states to fire mass amounts of disobedient police officers who remain brutal towards Afro-Americans, and refuse to enforce the law when it does not suit the racist Southerner. The bully pulpit must continually be used."
 USA_lbj_64_for_those_worthy: "...For Those Worthy"
 USA_lbj_64_for_those_worthy_desc: "Even though we must be a beacon of hope and freedom, we cannot just completely open the borders to every human on the planet. Instead, we must consider excluding certain amounts of individuals based on a lack of skills that could be problematic to our country's security. All elements of possible moral defect from immigrants must be screened, and possibly excluded if a threat to national security. Yet if we actually consider excluding certain people based on subjective morality, we would be doing damage to our own country's potential. This decision must be made with respect to all options."
 USA_lbj_64_immigration_nationality_act: "The Immigration and Nationality Services Act"
 USA_lbj_64_immigration_nationality_act_desc: "This bill will make sure more immigrants are able to enter. But their entry will be based on deserving qualifications that can make them potential Americans. Qualifications such as an education, needed skills, and so forth will be sought after to make sure they get priority in our new system. Another major provision for this law will give immigrants a clearer path for naturalization as well. Finally, racial qualifications are eliminated completely, to allow for a more fair and just system of entry that represents the moral character of this entire country. Let's make this immigration system more fair and just for future Americans of the world!"
 USA_lbj_64_roof_over_head: "A Roof Over One's Head"
 USA_lbj_64_roof_over_head_desc: "We cannot allow any Americans who are minorities to suffer housing discrimination any longer. Afro-Americans, Mexicans, and Asians all suffer from constant discrimination despite their hard working in moving up. Most of them live in slums, in misery, or in the streets where they end up causing problems for the rest of us. Even though many of our white American voters want nothing to do with them, letting black Americans suffer in squalor will not only make our country continue to look bad, we will possibly not fully secure support for our party from these new voters in the next election. I implore my fellow Republicans and fellow Democrats to support the Fair Housing Act not only for our coalition's sake, but the sake of America."
 USA_lbj_64_ghetto_riots: "Use the Ghetto Riots"
 USA_lbj_64_ghetto_riots_desc: "Look at the chaos! The looting, destruction, and violence has ruined so many of our great cities. And that looting and destruction comes from African-American ghettos that remained impoverished, in destitution, and utter misery thanks to our current party's inability to solve this crisis. We must do something to soothe the anger and rage from the black community, as well as prevent more violence between fellow Americans of all colors. The riots showcase the current failures of our government, as we remain in stagnation with the bill. This inaction must end, or else our black citizens will be in future jeopardy."
 USA_lbj_64_yes_in_my_backyard: "Yes in My Backyard!"
 USA_lbj_64_yes_in_my_backyard_desc: "Now I understand the worries about less fortunate people entering your beautiful suburban homes and wonderful neighborhoods. Maybe you are afraid that they will give your neighborhood a bad name, or that they would cause trouble, or that they would even not be able to fit in and end up excluding you from society. However, that will not be the case! If you can get your congressman to support the Fair Housing Act, you can be guaranteed the less fortunate will be able to rise to your own level with their hard work and dedication. Those underprivileged people who end up having an easier time moving in will become your friend, and if anything, make your neighborhood stronger. I implore you as a good and kind American citizen to help the less fortunate in their struggles for an independent and happier life. Let's say yes for an even stronger backyard!"
 USA_lbj_64_the_FHA: "The Fair Housing Act"
 USA_lbj_64_the_FHA_desc: "We have come so far on civil rights, yet we need to finish the job. The Fair Housing Act, should we manage to push it through, will be this administration's last great legislative achievement in the civil rights debate. By prohibiting any and all discrimination in renting and selling housing, we will see a profound change in the character of our towns and cities.\n\nThe scale of change that the Fair Housing Act would bring, and its status as the last 'great' civil rights bill by this administration, have made it the center of a political firestorm. Segregationists see the housing issue as the last great bulwark against 'enforced desegregation', and will oppose the bill as strongly as they can. Many within our own party encourage compromise to prevent extensive fallout with conservative voters. Meanwhile, African Americans look to the White House to see if the President is as good as his word.\n\nAny of our choices will have consequences, but choose we must."
 USA_lbj_64_war_on_poverty: "The War on Poverty"
 USA_lbj_64_war_on_poverty_desc: "Poverty has been an immense drag on our society and has plagued the United States since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Both in our cities and our most rural communities, millions live in a state of squalor. A lack of economic opportunity subjects generations of Americans to an endless cycle of hardship. No more! Now, the United States is in a state of war against an enemy older and more elusive than any nation: poverty itself. Through new programs and initiatives, we will stamp out poverty so that all can succeed thanks to the government's helping hand."
 USA_lbj_64_community_action_initiative: "Community Action Initiative"
 USA_lbj_64_community_action_initiative_desc: "Talk on the national and federal levels about fully addressing poverty is nice, but only through the mobilization of communities throughout the nation can we have the manpower needed to confront economic abjection. With new outreach programs that would encourage participation on both the local and societal level, we can grant new opportunities to the poor to ensure that no one struggles to get by. The federal government will serve as a guiding hand leading impoverished communities wherever they are found to prosperity."
 USA_lbj_64_job_corps: "Propose the Job Corps"
 USA_lbj_64_job_corps_desc: "Youth unemployment rates in the United States are of great concern to the President as well as the Department of Labor. In yet another project to add to a regimen of proposed welfare and outreach programs, we aim to create the Job Corps. This organization under the larger Department of Labor would provide education to equip America's youth for a multitude of fields as well as work until they can get back on our feet. The majority of their service would be spent improving national parks, impoverished communities, and other areas which have fallen under the responsibility of the federal government. Hopefully, the program will provide vital training and experience to those who need it most."
 USA_lbj_64_vista_of_future: "A VISTA of the Future"
 USA_lbj_64_vista_of_future_desc: "The Volunteers in Service to America, or VISTA, program is the next proposed organization under the OEO umbrella, aiming to provide lower-income communities with new opportunities while also serving the rest of the nation. Similar to the Peace Corps, VISTA provides members with a steady income, health coverage, and a myriad of other benefits in exchange for volunteer service. Recipients will not only see other areas outside of their communities but will also gain the skills needed to fill the many roles mandated by today's industrial economy. Let's get to work!"
 USA_lbj_64_more_food_stamps: "Solidify the Food Stamps Program"
 USA_lbj_64_more_food_stamps_desc: "Already, we have seen great success within our food stamps program. In areas currently running the program, the impoverished have enjoyed greater access to food, as they no longer have to fight over scraps. This experiment has had its shortcomings, the administrative burden has been higher then what we expected. In addition, making sure the stamps are distributed to all who need them has proven difficult. As we continue expanding, we will have to keep an eye to patch out these kinks within the program.\n\nIn light of the program's success, it's time to go nationwide. We will immediately begin expansion into new states. Before too long, the entire Nation will have access to the Food Stamps program. With this step, our war on poverty will be all the closer to being won."
 USA_lbj_64_EOA_act: "The Economic Opportunity Act"
 USA_lbj_64_EOA_act_desc: "The vast majority of the poverty-stricken are simply down on their luck, stuck at the bottom with no way out. It is not uncommon for a citizen to simply lose their job and fall below the poverty line whilst unable to find new employment. We cannot allow our people to fall by the wayside, forsaken and forgotten.\n\nPresident Johnson will be introducing a new bill designed to combat these issues. The Economic Opportunity Act will start by increasing unemployment subsidies and provide a government assisted service to find new employment. Not only this, the act will assist those already in the workforce, increasing federal minimum wage. This new bill will show the people what we are striving for, paving the way for further legislation."
 USA_lbj_64_consolidate_programs: "Consolidate the Programs"
 USA_lbj_64_consolidate_programs_desc: "During our administration, we have managed to create several assistance programs throughout these great states. As helpful as these programs may be, we have constantly been slowed down by the unending bureaucracy involved in running these programs on a state by state basis. If we are to reach the greatest number of people, we are going to have to start cutting red tape.\n\nUnifying all of our programs under the federal government is sure to both reduce the administrative burden and lower overall costs. However, many will see this as an expansion to federal power as we take control out of state hands. Within the more conservative parts of our Country, this is unlikely to be a popular measure."
 USA_lbj_64_increase_minimum_benefits: "Increase Minimum Benefits"
 USA_lbj_64_increase_minimum_benefits_desc: "Our current benefits program is a welcome reprieve for the poor, but for the most absolutely worst off even these payments are not enough. If we are to lift all Americans out of poverty and damnation, we must increase our payments to the poorest recipients of welfare. Only by giving them the help they need can these people finally be brought out of the poverty trap."
 USA_lbj_64_nobody_left_behind: "Nobody Left Behind"
 USA_lbj_64_nobody_left_behind_desc: "There is no doubt that we have done great work. In our years running the country, our administration has made large strides in improving the life of the average American. We have reformed education, engineered social security, and have even widened access to proper medical care. The Great Society program has reached out and made America a better place, and yet, we can make it even better.\n\nThe Great Society program was formed to help all Americans, regardless of creed, gender, or race. The time has come to begin reaching out to the disadvantaged within our country. We will begin work on legislation that will allow minorities, women, and all those discriminated against the opportunity to seek better jobs, better education. Regardless of how some might feel, we will not let any American get left behind on our path towards the future."
 USA_lbj_64_safety_net: "A Safety Net"
 USA_lbj_64_safety_net_desc: "Individuals and businesses that are most financially at risk can easily be pushed over the edge by a sudden calamity or monetary setback. We must ensure that these people have access to a financial "safety net," a means of shielding them from the worst impacts of a sudden and unexpected expense. This could be achieved by introducing legislation to improve the availability and quality of savings accounts and insurance, so that our people might always have some money to fall back on."
 USA_lbj_64_neither_race_nor_class: "Neither Race nor Class"
 USA_lbj_64_neither_race_nor_class_desc: "We have already done much to bring equality to America, but there remains an issue to be dealt with. While our people are no longer legally burdened by race, many minorities are still greatly disadvantaged by the economic conditions they face as a result of years of neglect and persecution. If we are to truly free the people from the shackles of the past, we must amend our existing civil rights legislation to also provide concrete legal protections to the economically disadvantaged. We must ensure that all people, no matter their race, their color or their stature in life are treated with respect and with dignity."
 USA_lbj_64_right_to_liberty: "The Right to Liberty"
 USA_lbj_64_right_to_liberty_desc: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights..." - The Declaration of Independence\n\nThis was the promise that America was founded upon, though unfortunately until now it has been a promise denied to a significant number of our citizenry. Now, we have ensured that all may be free. All Americans might live unbound by both law and poverty; all men, be they black or white, rich or poor, young or old, might now truly be placed on even footing from which they may work together to make America the best it can possibly be."
 USA_lbj_64_welfare_of_people: "Welfare of the People"
 USA_lbj_64_welfare_of_people_desc: "Despite illusions of economic success compared to our enemies to both the West and the East, the country is suffering from numerous crises that continue to strike those in the lowest strata of the population. Homelessness, poverty, and an inability to obtain even the most basic services are now endemic to the country, and, through a regimen of new programs, President Johnson plans to address the domestic issues facing the nation. For centuries, the federal government has taken a backseat in helping the poor, whether due to constitutional restraints or other impediments. Now, the federal government's role must be reexamined so that one thing can become clear: the phrase "promote the general welfare" is a mandate, not an ideal."
 USA_lbj_64_prevention_best_cure: "Prevention Is the Best Cure"
 USA_lbj_64_prevention_best_cure_desc: "In areas where people are deprived of the tools they need to succeed in today's economy, poverty takes root. For that reason, we must nip it in the bud before it can even be given the chance to bloom. Through establishment of higher education standards and grants where they are needed most, we can ensure that America's youth are educated enough to take on high-level jobs in an ever-changing economy."
 USA_lbj_64_begin_pilot_programs: "Begin Pilot Programs"
 USA_lbj_64_begin_pilot_programs_desc: "Preparations are now underway for President Johnson's clash with the endlessly inhibiting forces of poverty. To begin this struggle, we will pass a series of small-scale assistance programs. While not creating a significant impact themselves, they will hopefully set the stage for even greater projects that will follow in the months. However, for now, we may offer benefits to America's poor in the short-term."
 USA_lbj_64_create_OEO: "Create the Office of Economic Opportunity"
 USA_lbj_64_create_OEO_desc: "President Johnson's campaign to lift America's poor out of their hardship will be a massive undertaking from start to finish. The creation of a new bureaucracy and the many accompanying programs necessitates coordination on a large scale. The Office of Economic Opportunity, created on the President's orders, will organize all of these programs and make sure that every initiative we take runs smoothly."
 USA_lbj_64_assess_current_programs: "Assess Current Programs"
 USA_lbj_64_assess_current_programs_desc: "Before new programs can be proposed and passed into law, an inquiry into the current federal policy situation is warranted. Currently, various welfare programs from past administrations exist, with their own funds and bureaucracies, under the executive branch. Before moving to more bold measures, President Johnson has recommended an examination of these programs to determine the best method of management is for future programs. Determining what is unnecessary and "cutting the fat" where needed would also be prudent for the sake of fiscal responsibility."
 USA_lbj_64_stopgap_measures: "Stopgap Measures"
 USA_lbj_64_stopgap_measures_desc: "Like most major changes in federal policy, the expansion and creation of the welfare system will take time, both due to opposition and the overall sluggishness of the American system of government in implementing reform. However, for the moment, more gradual and incremental measures can be taken to temporarily quench the need for aid. Most of these programs will be short-lived, only providing fixes in the short term that give economic assistance to the needy. Much greater projects are coming down the pipeline but a reminder to the people that something is being done to address these issues will go a long way."
 USA_lbj_64_protect_most_vulnerable: "Protecting Our Most Vulnerable"
 USA_lbj_64_protect_most_vulnerable_desc: "Like in so many other economic crises, the ones most affected by our defective healthcare system are the nation's poor. Even as the advancement of technology marches forward, they are tragically left behind and swindled out of the care they need. In the first of many acts to improve the situation, President Johnson has signed a list of executive orders and urged legislation through Congress. These preliminary bills, which will do little on the long run, aim to protect those who cannot take care of themselves due to the unchecked distortion of the healthcare industry."
 USA_lbj_64_trumans_idea: "Truman Had the Right Idea!"
 USA_lbj_64_trumans_idea_desc: "Two decades ago, Senator Truman proposed legislation that would revolutionize the American healthcare system. Seeing the pitiful state of the health industry, he proposed widespread government action to address the growing problem. At the center of his proposal was universal coverage for all, covering all aspects of care, and massive investment into the construction of hospitals throughout the country. This kind of action is long overdue, and so President Johnson has adopted many of the same policies championed by Truman in his campaign to insure the nation's health."
 USA_lbj_64_revisit_wmd_bill: "Revisit the W-M-D Bill"
 USA_lbj_64_revisit_wmd_bill_desc: "In 1945, Senators Wagner, Murray, and Dingell proposed legislation to Congress to reform the nation's healthcare system. The introduced W-M-D would have instituted a national hospitalization program, accessible to all Americans. Unfortunately, in those times of strife, such radical change was swiftly struck down before it could pass. Now, it seems the bill's time has come. Through a renewal and revision of the W-M-D bill, we could soon implement its most beneficial qualities. The goal will then become the creation of a national system aided by the government directly."
 USA_lbj_64_reintroduce_social_security: "Expanding Social Security"
 USA_lbj_64_reintroduce_social_security_desc: "Social Security has played an enormous role in combating poverty and helping the aged and infirm. Nobody would deny it is one of the more popular programs that have prevented some of the worst issues of the Great Depression. However, we have to step back and realize now it's not enough to get the results we need.\n\nSocial Security will be set up to properly take care of those who cannot work. We will provide more benefits to the people under its purview, especially for those who are disabled. No longer will it be a simple program of old age insurance, it will provide wide ranging relief to people who cannot work due to unfortunate fate or the passage of time. We will once again reaffirm that regardless of the challenges one may face, they will not be left behind by this union."
 USA_lbj_64_reassure_party: "Reassure the Party"
 USA_lbj_64_reassure_party_desc: "A important part of implementing President Johnson's Great Society reforms will be party loyalty. So far, Republican support for these aid programs has been strong but, in order to gain lasting support, deals in other areas will have to be made. Through presidential remarks and copious logrolling, Johnson and his endorsers will need to gain the backing of the Republican Party to push the next round of bills through Congress. Votes from their base will prove invaluable in the fight to pass further legislation."
 USA_lbj_64_no_bootstraps: "You Can't Lift Yourself Up by Your Bootstraps"
 USA_lbj_64_no_bootstraps_desc: "Many opponents of President Johnson's welfare measures argue that individual responsibility and hard work on the part of the poor is the only reasonable way to address their woes rather than federal aid. These arguments are purely anecdotal, with little basis in reality, as millions face barriers to entry into the workforce that they are often powerless to overcome. Since they are unable through no fault of their own to escape these conditions, a helping hand from the government is necessary. Spreading this message to Congress and the larger populace will be vital to implementing future programs."
 USA_lbj_64_reassure_public: "Reassure the Public"
 USA_lbj_64_reassure_public_desc: "While support from the Republican establishment is nonetheless important, gaining the approval of the public at large is the most critical aspect of any campaign for large-scale reform. So far, the people have been reluctant to get behind the Great Society concept. To allay their concerns, the President must go public through direct addresses via the radio, television, and other mediums. The aim of these measures is not to only encourage voting in like-minded members of Congress but also to pressure current Congress members."
 USA_lbj_64_unity_above_all: "Unity Above All"
 USA_lbj_64_unity_above_all_desc: "If anything is to be done in the implementation of Great Society programs, lasting support for the Republican Party is an imperative. For this reason, we must show solidarity with Republican leaders, even if that means compromising on some of the issues most critical to President Johnson's campaign. While ensuring their support is a double-edged sword, it is important nonetheless to the passage of the Social Security Expansion Act and further legislation. While some goals will be left unachieved, abandoning allies in Congress would be a poor choice."
 USA_lbj_64_break_with_democrats: "Break with the Republicans"
 USA_lbj_64_break_with_democrats_desc: "Token reassurances to the party establishment have proven insufficient to gaining their full support in the push for Social Security expansion and further programs. Unfortunately, Republican leaders have failed to listen to the very constituents who elected them to their privileged positions and they have been unceasingly reluctant to commit to President Johnson's initiative. For this reason, ties must be cut with this corrupt establishment if any future progress is to be made. Hopefully, a new coalition can be formed to finish what the President has started."
 USA_lbj_64_duty_to_country: "Our Duty to the Country"
 USA_lbj_64_duty_to_country_desc: "The push for a robust welfare system is not only a struggle to help those who need it most; it also represents many of the values that define the United States and the American Way. Through the implementation of welfare programs, the government will fulfill its most important role as outlined by the Founding Fathers: protecting its citizens from suffering and economic ruin. The Great Society extends beyond mere handouts to those who need it; it is a fulfillment of the most fundamental roles of American government."
 USA_lbj_64_we_need_to_pay: "We're Going to Have to Pay for All This Somehow"
 USA_lbj_64_we_need_to_pay_desc: "The unfortunate reality is every dollar we spend has to come from somewhere else. While simply deficit spending may be an option in other cases, the unique nature of Social Security as an insurance program makes this not an option. Every dollar we spend must come from someone in some way, or we will not be able to provide benefits and the structure will collapse. So, as unpopular as it is, we have to take money from Peter to pay Paul.\n\nWe have multiple options as to how to do this, and each has their benefits and downsides. Simply increasing the payroll taxes already in place could pay for it. Or we could raise income taxes in order to provide for the program. Whatever the choice, we have to pick one and hope it doesn't anger Congress enough to kill the bill."
 USA_lbj_64_duty_to_people: "Our Duty to the People"
 USA_lbj_64_duty_to_people_desc: "Since its transformation under President Lyndon B. Johnson, the Democratic Party has become the party "of the people, by the people, and for the people." To gain further support from the public for Social Security, it is time to entertain a different route of appealing to voters. Through further outreach, the people must understand that the President and his loyalists in Congress truly believe in the cause of helping the needy, and that the party has adopted to mandate to assist the people whenever there is suffering or injustice."
 USA_lbj_64_social_security_act: "The Social Security Expansion Act"
 USA_lbj_64_social_security_act_desc: "The largest revamp of America's social insurance project since its inception, the Social Security Expansion Act is the product of months of thought, negotiation, and fist slamming. Now, it will go to the floor for congress to debate. And they will have a lot to pour over.\n\nIn the bill are large expansions of benefits for the people previously covered by the program. Unemployed, retired, dependents, all will see much greater relief thanks to this act. In their ranks too will be disabled people who are unable to support themselves due to injuries. It is up to Congress to pass this act without delay, so we can finally provide millions of struggling Americans with peace of mind and allow them access to a better way of life."
 USA_lbj_64_work_never_done: "Our Work Is Never Done"
 USA_lbj_64_work_never_done_desc: "Social Security has finally passed and ensured that Americans can comfortably retire without facing the threat of poverty. However, there are much greater plans to pursue in order to fulfill the Great Society that President Johnson has envisioned for the United States, and we must remain diligent moving forward. There are still many left unprotected and uninsured by the act, including younger individuals who still suffer from the worst effects of poverty. Greater programs will have to be created and more initiatives taken if we hope to build a society where no one lives without a safety net."
 USA_lbj_64_massive_burdens: "Our Burdens Are Massive"
 USA_lbj_64_massive_burdens_desc: "At times it might seem any effort to provide a better life for all is futile. The United States is a nation of nearly 200 million people, and no matter how many we help, there will always be some who fall through the cracks. Our system is good and noble, but we must not grow complacent. There are always more people who need some help to realize their fullest potential. President Johnson ponders this, and wonders what can be done to ensure that the system continues to do its best for our people."
 USA_lbj_64_many_troubles: "Our Troubles Are Many"
 USA_lbj_64_many_troubles_desc: "It is the nature of history that mankind must face endless struggle. Across both the Atlantic and the Pacific, billions of people live under unimaginable cruelty, a life more bleak and painful than that of even the most worst off American. We face down annihilation every day, living in the hopes that cool heads will prevail even in the most aggressive of nations. In times such as these, it can seem that nothing we can do will ever be enough. Sitting in the Oval Office, President Johnson contemplates the nature of the world, and if what we are doing can hold a candle to the darkness."
 USA_lbj_64_great_virtues: "But Our Virtues Are Great!"
 USA_lbj_64_great_virtues_desc: "There will always be darkness, but there must also always be light. The United States is the land of the free, the home of the brave. A place of endless opportunity, where all men may freely pursue their own betterment in the name of the American Dream. As long as our values are maintained the light of liberty will shine on, and the hope of freedom and justice will never perish! That we try to make our world better even against the darkest threats we have ever faced proves that there is goodness in men, and President Johnson comforts himself in the solace that we can always count on the spirit of America to lead humanity to a better future."
 USA_lbj_64_healthcare_for_a_nation: "Healthcare for a Nation"
 USA_lbj_64_healthcare_for_a_nation_desc: "The United States, a nation where no man should ever go uncared for, has failed to take care of its own citizens for decades. The so-called "healthcare industry" consistently drives up prices on its services, putting lifesaving care out of reach for millions of Americans. Our reliance on the private sector to carry the burden of the country's healthcare has been misplaced; now it is time for us to pick up the slack. President Johnson has proposed a series of programs to repair this fundamentally broken system. Regulations, financial aid, publicly funded options, all actions must be considered if we are to insure the health of our citizens."
 USA_lbj_64_insurance_companies: "Incentivize Insurance Companies"
 USA_lbj_64_insurance_companies_desc: "We are making great progress in our campaign to institute a national healthcare system but, in order to fully implement such a system, we will have to enlist the support of the very insurance companies who have caused the problems we seek to address. To do this, we will provide financial incentives to these corporations in the form of subsidies to secure their assistance as we write more legislation. While their practices are unsavory, we will need their cooperation if we hope to right their wrongs."
 USA_lbj_64_ammend_hill_burton: "Amend the Hill-Burton Act"
 USA_lbj_64_ammend_hill_burton_desc: "The Hill-Burton was a landmark piece of legislation for healthcare reform in the United States. Passed in 1946, the act gives significant loans to hospitals, who then promise to provide services to customers who cannot afford payment, even with included insurance. The act has been successful in not only caring for those who cannot easily care for themselves but also improving the services they receive. Now, two decades later, we can revisit the bill. Through the addition of modifications that will further improve the healthcare situation, we can move one step closer to universal coverage."
 USA_lbj_64_blue_cross_blue_shield: "Blue Cross Blue Shield"
 USA_lbj_64_blue_cross_blue_shield_desc: "Covering millions of citizens is a lofty undertaking that we could never manage on our own. To remedy the situation, we must draw from the existing insurance market to handle these issues. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is a fantastic candidate for the implementation of Medicare, Medicaid, and other nationwide insurance programs as proposed by Johnson's Great Society. Existing as an association of various insurance companies across the country, the organization will be vital to our plans going forward."
 USA_lbj_64_reign_in_AMA: "Rein in the AMA"
 USA_lbj_64_reign_in_AMA_desc: "The American Medical Association is the largest association of physicians in the United States, including tens of thousands of doctors from across the country. Its stated goal is the betterment of public health, and it plays a critical role in physician specialization in the medical system. The organization also holds significant political clout, often partaking in copious lobbying for interests that are often against our stated goals. With this in mind, we must recognize the importance of gaining their support before we pass any more legislation. Whether through favors, grants, or possibly threats, we will bring the AMA into the fold."
 USA_lbj_64_workplace_healthcare_act: "The Workplace Healthcare Act"
 USA_lbj_64_workplace_healthcare_act_desc: "The Workplace Healthcare Act is the next step in a gradual march toward a robust and federally supported insurance system. Serving as a check on the often harmful and abusive policies of insurance companies, the act proposes a number of protections for the nation's consumers. These include the obligation for price transparency and visibility to prevent exploitation and a requirement that all companies provide insurance regardless of pre-existing disabilities, sex, or any other conceivable factors. For years, corporations tasked with providing insurance have used their privileged positions to profit off of the struggles of unwitting customers. This newly proposed act will prevent such practices."
 USA_lbj_64_pressure_states: "Pressure the States"
 USA_lbj_64_pressure_states_desc: "Predictably, many states have opposed the passage of further legislation in Congress and have been reluctant to participate in the implementation of our programs. Admittedly, the effects on state-level budgets have been stressful, but, with sufficient reorganization, they should be manageable. To encourage participation in our newly constructed system, we will have to pressure them into cooperation. The ways this could manifest our extensive, but negative and positive reinforcement are both on the table. By giving benefits to states who adopt our programs and threatening to revoke critical funds in other areas to those who do not, we can keep the states in line."
 USA_lbj_64_medicare_medicaid: "The Medicare and Medicaid Expansion"
 USA_lbj_64_medicare_medicaid_desc: "Medicare and Medicaid are the flagship programs of the larger to reform our nation's healthcare, and they have proven invaluable for the coverage of retired, disabled, and financially struggling Americans. In this new age of broad healthcare coverage, however, these programs are both in dire need of an update. As the strain on our bureaucracy increases, we will need to expand Medicare and Medicaid to accommodate the needs of a growing body of recipients. Now, millions rely on publicly funded insurance programs for their coverage, and a degree of revitalization is necessary to manage the burden."
 USA_lbj_64_budget_drafts: "Hypothetical Budget Drafts"
 USA_lbj_64_budget_drafts_desc: "Our plans for a new healthcare system will need funding, and if we are to win people over, we must prove that such a plan is feasible. We will get our economic advisors working on drawing up some budgets and show our critics that we can make this work. As the most economically sound nation on the planet, it shouldn't be too difficult to gather up the necessary money, but we will still need to convince people that it is a worthwhile use of funds."
 USA_lbj_64_doctor_corps: "The "Doctor Corps""
 USA_lbj_64_doctor_corps_desc: "Inspired by the Teacher Corps, we will also establish a so called "Doctor Corps." Like their educational counterparts, the men and women of the Doctor Corps will take part in outreach programs to deprived areas, filling in the gaps in local healthcare provision and giving cheap treatments to the poorest who need it. Aspiring doctors fresh out of college could readily seek internship in the program to gain valuable experience and to give back to their communities, though they would be led by qualified professionals whose work would be subsidized by us."
 USA_lbj_64_radical_proposal: "A Radical Proposal"
 USA_lbj_64_radical_proposal_desc: "Now that we have laid down the necessary groundwork and drawn up our plans, it is time to formally draft a bill. The creation of a government funded, national standard of healthcare has never before been attempted in the United States, and naturally our sceptics are vocal and numerous. We will need to fight our case hard all the way through to the end, using all the evidence and models we have established to argue our point. It will be difficult, and given the gravity of our task we must brace for disappointment. If we are successful, however, we could usher in a whole new era of health and wellbeing for all Americans."

 USA_lbj_64_right_to_life_desc: ""In a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty. In a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry. In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die untended. In a great land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read and write." - President Lyndon B. Johnson, Inaugural Address\n\nWith our healthcare plan secured, another pillar of the Great Society has fallen into place. No longer will our people be left out of pocket when they need help the most. The right to life is sacrosanct and must be granted to all Americans, no matter the cost. As the total overhaul of our health service gets underway, America can begin to reap the benefits. It will take a while before things are at maximum operational capacity, but we can soon expect a massive increase in the quality of public health."
 USA_lbj_64_teach_them_well: "Teach Them Well"
 USA_lbj_64_teach_them_well_desc: "On its most basic level, education is the process of instilling knowledge into children to prepare them for the job market. However, it extends beyond the practical applications. Education is more than teaching and testing; it is an investment into the nation's children, America's future. While the United States has produced some of the greatest technological innovators in the world, ineffective teachers and poorly funded schools continue to leave millions of children behind, depriving them of the ability and the freedom to succeed in a demanding economy. It is time for the federal government to intervene, to protect their future and the nation's."
 USA_lbj_64_head_start: "The "Head Start" Programs"
 USA_lbj_64_head_start_desc: "In order to foster an education system where none are left behind, a new regime of agencies will need to be created. The proposed "Head Start" programs, under the purview of the Department of Health and Human Services, will play a pivotal role in the creation of such a system. These programs aim to ease the transition from preschool to elementary school, improve learning abilities, and create a home environment that encourages rather than discourages school participation for students if possible. "Head Start" will entail the employment of teachers and the opening of facilities throughout the country to aid low-income families."
 USA_lbj_64_teacher_unions: "Sit Down with Teachers' Unions"
 USA_lbj_64_teacher_unions_desc: "Public teachers' unions, notably the American Federation of Teachers, wield a tremendous amount of influence over the education system, most of which is executed through campaigning and lobbying. Since they will be the ones educating children in the revitalized education system, winning their support, especially for ambitious legislation, will be critical to the implementation of many programs. To hopefully codify an alliance, members of the Department of Health and Human Services will meet with union leaders across the country to gain their support, meaning some promises will have to be made."
 USA_lbj_64_assess_material_needs: "Assess Material Needs"
 USA_lbj_64_assess_material_needs_desc: "The implementation of new education programs will doubtless be a costly undertaking, and one thing central to this initiative will be insuring that schools are correctly stocked. To determine what is needed and where, an examination of the nation's individual schools is necessary. Once this census can be concluded, the process of apportioning textbooks and other classroom supply funds to state and local governments can begin so that every school has the tools for a modern, efficient education."
 USA_lbj_64_first_education_act: "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act"
 USA_lbj_64_first_education_act_desc: "After months of preparation and revision by the Cabinet, Congressional committees, and various interest groups, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act can be proposed to the legislature. The bill contains numerous provisions, the most important among them being the apportionment of funds to schools throughout the country to improve education and the school environment how administrators see fit. Included also in the bill's language is an encouragement for equality on racial and economic grounds so America's students can be free to receive a strong and equal education."
 USA_lbj_64_our_past: "They Are Our Past"
 USA_lbj_64_our_past_desc: "President Johnson has made one thing clear in his campaign to revive and stimulate the nation's education system: we must fund education, not only during youth but also beyond it. Through funding schools and universities alike, we will create a system in which anyone can pursue a fulfilling career in adulthood made possible by a robust youth education. It is through the people who followed their love of knowledge outside of school that we have reached this point and, by using their contributions, we can create the next generation of innovators."
 USA_lbj_64_our_future: "They Are Our Future"
 USA_lbj_64_our_future_desc: "The importance of education on all levels cannot be understated. Through greater funds to American schools and universities, we can create new opportunities for people looking for higher education that, through no fault of their own, lack the means to pay for tuition. Providing a full education to all who need it is not only a preference but a moral imperative, as the people we help now will be the ones who create new innovations that revolutionize the world around them and move society forward. To neglect those with these skills would be unjust."
 USA_lbj_64_funding_schools: "Funding Our Schools"
 USA_lbj_64_funding_schools_desc: "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has massively stimulated the flow of money from the federal government to America's classrooms but one act can hardly cover an entire nation. Some states are more in need of aid than others and, to address individual issues, funds will need to be allocated via earmarks and other grants. Local administrations often face unique issues specific to their area that extend beyond low incomes. The Johnson administration will provide a helping hand to level the playing field."
 USA_lbj_64_teacher_corps: "Establish the Teacher Corps"
 USA_lbj_64_teacher_corps_desc: "The Teacher Corps is the next proposed program to kickstart education in low-income communities across the country through teachers' associations that specialize in community outreach. Areas throughout the United States would each have individual projects headed by professors and institutions specializing in higher education who would then employ aspiring teachers as interns. These interns would then teach students in disadvantaged communities, thus helping to lift disadvantaged families out of the poverty cycle while gaining valuable skills in the process. Hopefully, the program will help both teachers and students."
 USA_lbj_64_funding_colleges: "Funding Our Colleges"
 USA_lbj_64_funding_colleges_desc: "While elementary and secondary schools present much greater and resource-intensive problems than higher education, a college education is nonetheless vital to more skilled professions in the job market. Funds to public and private universities will receive the bulk of our attention, perhaps in exchange for practices to give opportunities to less-advantaged applicants. Either way, higher education is in need of federal assistance, and the cost of allowing higher education to deteriorate is much greater than the proposed federal funding."
 USA_lbj_64_second_education_act: "The Higher Education Act"
 USA_lbj_64_second_education_act_desc: "Another landmark piece of legislation in President Johnson's Great Society initiative, the Higher Education Act will make commitment to the enhancement of university education federal law implemented by a strengthened bureaucracy. Under the act, Congress will provide greater funds to the nation's universities while encouraging scholarships and favorable loans to students with the skills but not the money for college. Elementary school is important for general education but greater funds toward higher education will improve specialization."
 USA_lbj_64_national_arts: "National Endowment of the Arts"
 USA_lbj_64_national_arts_desc: "Even though they have little use in the profit-minded American economy, the arts are nonetheless a staple of our society. To insure that artists are valued and their crafts encouraged in the Great Society, President Johnson has proposed the creation of a new and independent agency to commission works of art. The so-called National Endowment for the Arts will provide critical funds to ambitious and visionary art projects across the United States and work with other government programs to achieve these ends. These operations will revive the nation on a deeper level than the economy."
 USA_lbj_64_national_humanities: "National Endowment of the Humanities"
 USA_lbj_64_national_humanities_desc: "While the visual arts are important to maintaining a healthy society, we must also focus on our history, philosophy, and scholarship. The National Endowment for the Humanities will seek to fill this niche, allocating funds to a range of humanities projects undertaken by libraries, museums, and other public institutions. Since the humanities is such a broad term, the organization will receive substantial but reasonable funding to advance the humanities in the United States and its culture."
 USA_lbj_64_pbs_broadcast: "The First Broadcast of PBS"
 USA_lbj_64_pbs_broadcast_desc: "The Public Broadcasting Service is the first nonprofit publicly funded television broadcast service, and is a major part of President Johnson's Great Society project. The newly formed PBS will act as a distributor, with various channels under its purview covering topics ranging from children's entertainment to the news. The goal of the organization will be to provide accessible and high-quality programming to all Americans and hopefully educate the nation's citizens in the process."

Though he might not have gotten absolutely everything he wanted, that he has managed to accomplish this much is a grand achievement. The benefits - and ramifications - of the new system are sure to impact American society for decades to come. We are at peace, our people are happy and well treated, and faith in the system is higher than it has been in decades. As his time as President comes to a close, President Johnson can now take some well earned rest and reflect upon all that he has done."

 USA_LBJ_national_endowment_for_arts_desc: "A nation's legacy is not merely the record of its conquests and its GDP statistics. The national spirit of a people is expressed through its arts and letters, the creative embodiment of its achievements and hopes for the future. Where Germany and Japan trample on the souls of millions on their march towards their totalitarian dystopias, we invite our people to envision a brighter tomorrow, one where the flame of freedom burns bright for all eternity."
 USA_LBJ_national_endowment_of_humanities: "National Endowment of the Humanities"
 USA_LBJ_national_endowment_of_humanities_desc: "The intellectual life of a nation is one of the greatest indicators of its long-term vitality. The fascist project has been defined by the abject submission of the individual, the assumption that a society must pull inexorably towards a singular purpose defined by the state. Of what use, then, are the humanities and social sciences to a fascist society? None; but this breeds an intellectual stagnation and myopism that rots society from within, as seen in the recent German Civil War. A free society survives not in spite of intellectual diversity, that which the fascists deride as 'degeneracy'; it survives because of it."

USA_LBJ_school_bonus_2_desc: "As a result of President Lyndon Johnson's Higher Education Act, schools across America are undergoing massive renovations and are generally becoming much more effective at educating the youth of the nation. Teachers are being paid more, leading to much greater teacher motivation and student retention rates. In addition, many more young Americans are able to go to college, as federal scholarship money is now in abundance. Despite all these positives however, the Higher Education Act only provides for greater education funding for a few years. Within less than a decade, the bill will be expired, and most of the good the bill achieved will vanish from America's hands."

USA_LBJ_immigration_bonus_desc: "From the conclusion of the Second World War to the present day, immigrating to the United States has been almost impossible for those from non-OFN nations. Now, however, President Lyndon Johnson's Immigration and Nationality Act has allowed hundreds of thousands of Americans-in-waiting to finally cross the seas to live the American dream. These people range from dock workers to doctors, and, despite some criticism, will likely make the United States a greater nation. Nevertheless, due to compromises made on the part of the President, the act will expire within a few years. As it stands, the lucky few foreigners who arrive during this short period may comprise the last immigration wave the United States will see for decades to come."

It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won."\n\nSo announced President Lyndon Johnson, in his first State of the Union Address to Congress, his bold, far-reaching ambitions against poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth. For now, however, the President's words only encourage more charity out of federal employees than usual."

USA_LBJ_pilot_programs_2_desc: "In keeping with its lofty promises, the Johnson administration has begun fielding its footmen in the War on Poverty throughout the country. Under the Community Action Program, select non-profit organizations are tasked with employing low-income households and operating programs which better their standards of living. These Community Action Agencies consequently do much of the work presenting the fruits of President Johnson's broad reforms to a skeptical, yet cautiously optimistic populace."

USA_LBJ_pilot_programs_3_desc: "Complementing the existing social welfare programs the administration has established is the Job Corps, a free-of-charge vocational education program managed by the Department of Labor for persons aged 16 to 24. Its addition allows the federal government to tackle a youth unemployment rate twice higher than the national average, and ensure as many poor students as possible enter the workforce with a well-paying job."

This august body eventually gave its assent by voting the Office of Economic Opportunity into existence.\n\nAmalgam of the disparate task forces and committees that predated it, the OEO is tasked with managing the Johnson administration's nationwide anti-poverty programs while funding similar measures supervised by state governments, local governments, and non-profit organizations. Its foremost mission is to uplift destitute communities - black-majority counties, rural backwaters, Native American reservations - from poverty's crushing grip, so bringing into fruition the great society President Johnson has long dreamed."

USA_LBJ_healthcare_programs_1_desc: "The foundations for President Johnson's proposed healthcare system lay with its insurers. While the existing insurance market's present deregulated state theoretically depresses cost through competition, decades of data prove that it suffers from exorbitant premiums for wildly inconsistent quality of service.\n\nTo rein in the former and standardize the latter, the President shall sign legislation regulating the transactions between private insurance companies and their customers. These "bandaids" to American healthcare, he argues, prelude further enhancements during his term. The specifics of said enhancements remain a matter of speculation for the public."
USA_LBJ_healthcare_programs_2: "Support for Expanded Coverage"
USA_LBJ_healthcare_programs_2_desc: "Private insurance and private practitioners have dominated American healthcare for the country's near-two centuries of life. So secure are these providers of care that they take their earnings and freedoms as a given, rather than as a privilege bestowed by the absence of oversight. Nevertheless, dogged refusal against government intrusions into their fields has hampered past attempts to establish wider-covering healthcare paid for by Congress.\n\nOvercoming the industry's efforts against government healthcare is a must for the President's agenda. Support for it has thankfully grown among the American public, although at like rate as Congressional and private opposition."
USA_LBJ_healthcare_programs_3: "Blue Cross Blue Shield"
USA_LBJ_healthcare_programs_3_desc: "During the Great Depression, hospitals supplanted their income by offering insurance plans for their services. Region-wide alliances between plans have since sprung up to prevent the occurrence of ruinous price wars between facilities, and to expand their customer base by offering the same services and premiums to a wider geographical area.\n\nPresident Johnson has taken the concept a step further by establishing the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, now the largest federation of insurance companies in the United States. In effect, BCBA has standardized healthcare coverage for every one in three American - a ratio that may increase to two in five by the end of the decade."
USA_LBJ_healthcare_programs_4: "Dealing with the AMA"
USA_LBJ_healthcare_programs_4_desc: "It should come as no surprise that those who benefit most from the status quo are, incidentally, also those most opposed to reform. Their analogue in the healthcare industry is the American Medical Association. Wealthy and influential, the AMA has safeguarded beggaringly high prices for their practitioners' services and successfully lobbied against meaningful reform to American healthcare for decades.\n\nTheir opinions shall change, the President promises, whether by hook or by crook. Time will tell which between the two options America's medical elite prefer."

##### LBJ EVENTS


 LBJ.1.t: "The Inauguration Speech"
 LBJ.1.desc: ""My fellow countrymen: on this occasion, the oath that I have taken before you is not one I take alone, but one that we take together. We are one nation, and one people. We may have different colors or speak different tongues, but the banner which we follow remains the same. We are all Americans, and as such, we must work together for the further betterment of our country; work together for the creation of a great society."\n\n"For the past few decades, life in America has been greatly diminished: the recessions of the 30's and 50's, the loss in the World War, the Akagi Accords, and so on. Our nation has faced hardship for so long and suffered so much, it is easy to forget what we once were, and what we could be. America as a whole is strong, but her people do not reflect such. In a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty. In a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry. In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die untended. In a great land of learning and progress, young people must be taught to read and write. In a great society, the people have equal opportunity, and the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."\n\n"At present, America does not reflect this ideal of a great society; politicians in Washington vote on party lines, rather than by beliefs or principles; the minorities of our nation still toil under great discrimination; and more than a quarter of the country lives in poverty. I say to you now, America: this cannot stand. I have served this nation for more than 30 years of my life. I have struggled against this waste of our potential, our freedom, and our great wealth, but I cannot do it alone. I will repeat today what I said on that sorrowful day in November last year: I will lead and I will do the best I can. But you, America, you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dreams for guidance. The ideals of the old America will become the creed of the new one. God bless you all, and God bless this great nation.""
 LBJ.1.a: "Strong words from a strong leader."

 LBJ.2.t: "Strange Bedfellows"
 LBJ.2.desc: "As President Johnson prepares the groundwork for his "Great Society," he has found that the road to implementing his vision may be rougher than he originally thought. Many of the more conservative members of the Coalition are unlikely to take kindly to such broad government programs, and the NPP Nationalists are sure to oppose much of what he plans on sheer principle, no matter how well he lays it out. With the balance of power in the senate more precarious than ever, all it would take is a few opposition votes to block his plans and derail everything he has worked for.\n\nThere is, however, a force within the senate that might be willing to aid the President. The Progressive NPP shares many of the President's core beliefs, with Progressive leader [GetRFKOrJackson] having passionately spoken out about the state of poverty in America in the past. For this reason, President Johnson has mulled over the possibility of an agreement between the Republican-Democrats and the Progressives. In exchange for giving some concessions to the Progressives, they will surely be willing to give Johnson the votes he needs to pass whatever measures he likes and implement the Great Society to its fullest extent.\n\nThe only problem is the ruckus this will likely cause within his own party. After years of bitter divide between the two parties, there is likely to be much consternation at the idea of a partnership, especially from the Republican contingent of the party. However, after much consideration, President Johnson has deemed it the best course of action, and intends to write a long letter to [GetRFKOrJackson] offering an olive branch, laying out the many ways a partnership between the two men may bear fruit not just for each other, but for America."
 LBJ.2.a: "Now where did I leave my pen?"

 LBJ.3.t: "Unease Within the Republicans"
 LBJ.3.desc: "As predicted, the Republicans are not at all happy with President Johnson's overtures to the Progressives. As news of his letter to [GetRFKOrJackson] spreads, many within the RDC's junior party have expressed their anger at the President looking to "get in bed with our political enemies." Vice President Muskie today reportedly went as far as to suggest that going any further down this road of cooperation "would be a serious betrayal of the union between the Republicans and Democrats."\n\nThis has thrown a spanner in the works of the President's plans, but not an unanticipated one. Already he has moved to reassure Republican senators that any cooperation with the Progressives would be purely on a basis of convenience, and that in no way would he overturn the Republican-Democrats' principles in the interests of gaining their support. This has quietened some of the murmurs, but there is still some concerns as to what exactly the Progressives will demand for their assistance.\n\n[GetRFKOrJackson] has yet to formally respond to the President's missive, though many political pundits agree it is only a matter of time before he does, as this presents the first real chance for the NPP to gain a taste of power after their defeat in the election mere months ago."
 LBJ.3.a: "We are stronger united, why can't they see that?"

 LBJ.4.t: "Johnson and [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName] Meet"
 LBJ.4.desc: "[GetRFKOrJackson] has responded positively to President Johnson's offer of cooperation and agreed to meet with him at the White House to discuss the terms of an agreement between their parties. The meeting between the two men began pleasantly enough, with [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName] taking the time to praise some of Johnson's proposed reforms and complemented him on his willingness to reach across the aisle to do what was right for the country.\n\nHowever, [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName] made it clear that there were other things he wanted from this agreement than just good thoughts and proceeded to lay out a list of conditions, drawn up by both himself and other Progressive NPP senators, that he would require for any agreement to be made. Some of these issues were mostly compatible with President Johnson's intended course, but a sticking point did emerge. A key demand - that [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName] insisted he would not budge on - was that the President do more to resolve the ongoing civil rights issue, with [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName] sadly admitting that his party had not done quite enough to truly finish the job.\n\nWhile not necessarily opposed to this, President Johnson knew that extending the reach of civil rights legislation would not sit well with the more conservative Republicans and may well drive some of them to the Nationalists. As such, the two men debated for many hours, with Johnson expressing his concerns and [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName] attempting to offer workable compromises, but never straying from that one main demand. In the end, the two men agreed to a deal which they felt was reasonably suitable for the both of them, with President Johnson agreeing to [GetRFKOrJackson]'s core demands in exchange for some concessions. It remains to be seen if the party will be as approving of the deal, however."
 LBJ.4.a: "Let's hope the Dixiecrats don't yell too much."
 LBJ.4.b: "No deal."

 LBJ.5.t: "Fury in the Republicans"
 LBJ.5.desc: ""That our President would so readily capitulate to the demands of our opponents in the interest of furthering his own cause is a national disgrace! The NPP has no place in this ruling coalition, that I might remind all here today is a coalition between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. If President Johnson continues down this path, I cannot say in good faith that I can support the union between our parties any longer, and I am sure many of my fellow Republicans can agree."\n\nThese were the words spoken with barely contained anger by Republican senator Wallace F. Bennett today, and true to his word, they were echoed by many within the party. The agreement between President Johnson and [GetRFKOrJacksonLastName]'s Progressives has drawn the ire of the Republicans, who see the President's intent to deal with the Progressives over his own Republican partners as an act of betrayal. In addition, his promise to review the civil rights issue has reportedly led some of the more conservative senators to quietly exchange words with the Nationalist wing of the NPP, perhaps considering whether they may find better leadership and representation under their banner.\n\nThis newest internal crisis is fast becoming yet another hurdle for President Johnson's plans for the country. While some note that he is certainly shaking up a largely stagnant political theatre, the reality for the President is much more of a headache. With the smaller but nonetheless significant half of his party threatening an outright break from their coalition, he will need to find a way to either placate the Republicans or else keep them in line if he wants his young presidency to maintain the power to do what he feels is necessary."
 LBJ.5.a: "Let 'em complain!"
 LBJ.5.b: "Let's not be hasty here..."

 LBJ.6.t: "The Johnson Treatment"
 LBJ.6.desc: "In the last few days, President Johnson has been hard at work attempting to smooth over the rift between the Republicans and himself. In a mixture of private talks and public speeches, he has engaged in a fierce charm offensive, utilizing his political charisma to convince his fellow politicians that he is on their side. He has made it clear that though he fully intends to work with the Progressives to pass some crucial reforms, he firmly believes that the bond between the Republicans and Democrats is more important than ever, and he will do whatever it takes to ensure that this bond is maintained.\n\nHowever, Johnson has also taken a more aggressive and assertive attitude to some of the more stubborn Republicans who still see him as unworthy of leading them. Often bringing up the fact that the Republican popularity still hasn't recovered since the loss of the Second World War, Johnson has subtly reminded the Republicans that their party would have been consigned to irrelevancy by now had the Republican-Democratic Coalition not been established. This combined with some other rather bullish statements, some of which could be construed as mild threats towards certain senators, has rendered some of the loudest opponents within the party notably silent in recent days.\n\nFor the time being it seems the Republicans have been calmed, and President Johnson's deal with the Progressive NPP now draws little more consternation than wild speculation from the media. While the drama may have abated, however, it has clearly revealed that cracks are beginning to show in the Republican-Democrats. The party survives for now, but who can say what the future holds?"
 LBJ.6.a: "The Republicans know they need us."

 LBJ.7.t: "For the Good of the Party"
 LBJ.7.desc: "The Oval Office was illuminated by a dim orange glow as the sun set in the distance. Inside, Presidential Aide Walter Jenkins enters with a large handful of documents and folders for the President to see. President Lyndon Baines Johnson sits in his chair, reading and signing other important documents. "How did your meeting with Senator Bennett go, Mr. President?" asked Jenkins.\n\n"About as well as can be expected," replied an exhausted President Johnson, "as long as I don't try to completely overhaul the American political system and disturb the status quo too much, the democrats will ride along and vote with us."\n\nJenkins sat up in his seat, the orange glow of the setting sun warming his skin. "But President Johnson, isn't that what you intend to do? Was that not your entire campaign platform? To reform the American political system and create a 'great society'?"\n\n"In due time, Walt," replied Johnson, signing another document and setting it aside.\n\n"So you're going to break your deal with the Republicans later on?"\n\n"Maybe," he said, "or maybe they'll fall in line and vote with us anyway. Maybe I'll get enough votes to ignore them and go ahead with my plans."\n\n"All due respect, sir, but I don't think that the Republicans will just let you do that. They'll cause a big fuss."\n\n"Have you ever tried to calm a panicking horse, or, more pertinently, a mule? You need to approach slowly, and only go around the back when you're sure it trusts you. Politics is much the same. For right now, we're still on the approach."\n\n"That might work, but what if it doesn't?"\n\n"One thing at a time," Johnson replied, "for the moment, they'll have to hug our elephant, and I'll have to kiss their ass.""
 LBJ.7.a: "So it goes."

 LBJ.8.t: "Backroom Meetings"
 LBJ.8.desc: "Yellow-glowing lamps hanging from its low ceiling. Besides the weak lighting, the room was extravagantly decorated; velvet-lined chairs sat around a magnificently carved oaken table and the walls were covered with matching wood paneling. "Lovely room," said Lyndon Johnson, entering through the door opposite of Jackson.\n\n"Sorry about the lighting," Jackson replied, "this has always been a bit of an ignored room."\n\n"I asked for one to meet you in, didn't I?"\n\n"I suppose. In any case, we're going to have to make this brief, Johnson, I have a lot of things to do. Spend long enough in here and people will start to notice, too. What do you need?"\n\nJohnson sat down at the beautiful table across from Jackson. "I'm going to need your help," he began, "the Republicans won't be complacent with my reforms forever, and when they turn, I'll need Progressive votes."\n\n"What's in it for us? Why should I help you sway the Progressives?"\n\n"Why shouldn't you is a better question; by supporting my reforms, you get everything you've been begging for and more."\n\n"And what exactly have we been 'begging for'?"\n\n"Civil Rights, universal healthcare, greater social security, and about a hundred other things."\n\nJackson pondered for a moment. "If I'm going to help you, you have to help me. Any bill the Progressives calls for, I want your support."\n\n"Hmm... alright. I can't promise the Democrats will follow suit, but I'll throw you a bone when you want one."\n\n"Excellent," replied Jackson, smiling, "I think we're going to get a lot done together, Mr. President.""
 LBJ.8.a: "Now the true reforms can begin."

 LBJ.9.t: "A Junction in the Road"
 LBJ.9.desc: "The Oval Office sat quiet and serene, opposed to its usual state of interruption after interruption. President Johnson, as was typical, sat at his desk, reading, signing, and doing the duties of a President. However, there was an interruption: two men, forced to wait and hold their proposal. Johnson finished signing his last paper, and looked up to Walter Jenkins and Edmund Muskie. "Well," Johnson started, "you've been sitting there for a good couple of minutes. What do you need?"\n\nWalter Jenkins shuffled in his seat. "We've gotta make a choice, Mr. President," he said, "if we want to pass some of our reforms. We can make friends with the Republicans, or we can press the Nationalists. Nobody else has the votes to secure a majority with us; the Progressives are notoriously unreliable, as I'm sure you're aware."\n\n"We're already making friends with the Republicans, aren't we?" asked Johnson.\n\n"Yes," Muskie began, "but they're proving pretty stubborn, if we want their support we'll have to make genuine concessions to them."\n\n"Alright. What exactly do you mean by 'press the Nationalists'?"\n\n"Intimidation, blackmail, that sort of thing."\n\n"Hmm," said Johnson, scratching his chin, "what do you think, Muskie?"\n\n"Personally? I don't think the Nationalists will cave as easily as we think. Republicans are the way to go."\n\n"I'll make the call.""
 LBJ.9.b: "Play nice with the Republicans."
 LBJ.9.a: "Intimidate the Nationalists into voting with us!"

 LBJ.10.t: "Dealing with the Devils"
 LBJ.10.desc: "Today, following several large planning and discussion meetings over the past week, the Nationalists have largely agreed to support President Lyndon Johnson's economic reforms. This news comes as a shock to the nation at large, but most of all to the Deep South, where the Nationalists have their greatest amount of support. Senator Strom Thurmond, generally considered to be the leader of the Nationalists within the Senate, had this to say: "I am greatly heartened by the spirit of cooperation and compromise within this newly-elected administration. President Johnson and I, along with a great number of our colleagues, have managed to agree upon a new economic reform plan that seeks to please all parties. The President will have his Great Society, and I will stand behind him."\n\nPresident Johnson has yet to make more than a passing comment upon the deal with the Nationalists, but many expect that he and the RDC have made some sort of compromise, sacrificing some of their reforms in exchange for support in Congress. As of right now, the changes agreed upon to the President's legislation have not been released, and the nation waits with bated breath, watching this unprecedented alliance form."
 LBJ.10.a: "The Republicans and Nationalists are allies?"

 LBJ.11.t: "The Great Society"
 LBJ.11.desc: "President Lyndon Baines Johnson sat in the Oval Office, opposite of The Vice President Edmund Muskie and prominent advisor Nelson Rockefeller.\n\n"So," began President Johnson, sitting at the Resolute Desk, "the 'Great Society'. We've tested the waters, we've got the votes-- what exactly are we going to push forward?"\n\nEdmund Muskie scratched his chin, eyeing Johnson warily. "I thought we'd figured that out a long time ago."\n\n"Things have changed, Ed," Johnson replied, "we've made compromises to get the support that we have. Now, what are the major things that we could get away with? I won't give up the Civil Rights push. Kennedy died for it and I won't let his death be in vain. More than just voting security as well-- I want the whole racist, institutionalized disease ripped out, root and stem."\n\n"Fair enough," said Rockefeller, "I could probably get that through without much issue. I think we should throw in some anti-poverty legislation, too. We're still in a recession, Johnson. I'm not sure what the bills would precisely entail but we should probably include them."\n\n"Fair enough. Ed, you said something at one point about some environmental protection acts, right?"\n\nMuskie nodded. "Alright, then," said Johnson, "a triad of Civil Rights, social programs, and environmental protections.""
 LBJ.11.a: ""The groundwork for a Great Society, eh gentlemen?""

 LBJ.12.t: "Speeches Across the Nation"
 LBJ.12.desc: "After months of wrangling behind closed doors and spirited speculation from the press, President Johnson today finally unveiled his Great Society program in full detail to the American public. In a speech given during a guest appearance at the University of Michigan, Johnson laid out the ways his project would tackle poverty, racial injustice, education, healthcare, and transportation, amongst other aspects of American society in need of reform. Vowing to overhaul the country "in our cities, in our countryside and in our classrooms," the President expressed his firm belief that the Great Society is exactly what our country needs in these trying times.\n\nHis speech drew applause from those in attendance and from many within the Republican-Democrats, however his plans are not without opposition. With the many foreign entanglements America finds herself in, many question whether America can afford the President's proposed programs on top of the money vanishing into that quagmire. In addition, some voices within the NPP Nationalists and the Republicans murmur that many of Johnson's initiatives would be a gross overreach of government authority, with at least one Nationalist senator reportedly denouncing him as a "power hungry proto-fascist."\n\nFor the next few months, President Johnson intends to pass a myriad of bills aimed at implementing his vision. This will be a long, arduous process, and it will certainly be necessary to cut more deals to secure the support necessary to pass these bills. Regardless, he believes that no task is too much if it shall render American society truly great."
 LBJ.12.a: "For a better America."

 LBJ.13.t: "Debating the Voting Rights Act"
 LBJ.13.desc: "Today, Congress has convened to discuss the terms on the bill of our proposed Voting Rights Act. This bill is designed to provide general provisions for the prohibition of racial discrimination in local and state-level voting. Despite fierce opposition from the Nationalists and muffled grumbling within the Republicans, we have managed to decide on a number of these provisions already. This includes forbidding the implementation of any sort of voting qualification, prerequisite or any other act of interference against a person's right to vote on the basis of race, color or language.\n\nA debate has arisen on the matter of certain special provisions that may be added to the bill. These provisions include legally requiring all jurisdictions to provide election materials to voters in multiple languages, allowing federal oversight in any state or local level change to election laws, and the appointment of federal examiners to oversee voter registration functions to make sure the provisions are being implemented. The debate has grown fierce, with the Nationalists and some Republicans arguing these provisions amount to federal tyranny, while the Progressive NPP insists that they are absolutely necessary to protect the voting rights of America's most vulnerable. Many within the Democrats meanwhile argue that a compromise would be best, allowing some special provisions in return for some conservative amendments.\n\nHow strong these provisions are, if they are implemented at all, will need to be decided before we can take the bill to vote. Too many provisions and the Republicans are likely to complain, too few and the Progressives will not be happy. What course shall we take?"
 LBJ.13.a: "We need full equality. Add all the provisions!"
 LBJ.13.b: "Allow some special provisions."
 LBJ.13.c: "The general provisions are fine, let's not push further."

 LBJ.14.t: "The South Ablaze"
 LBJ.14.desc: "Over the past few days, in a dramatic but unsurprising series of events, the South and its Nationalist NPP population have descended into what can kindly be called utter chaos. Dozens of protests have been organized all across the former Confederacy, in cities such as Atlanta, Montgomery, New Orleans, and Savannah. All of this anger can be attributed to two men, in particular: Senator Strom Thurmond, and Alabama Governor George Wallace. These two individuals have riled up the white population against President Lyndon Johnson, following recent announcements that his "Great Society" reforms would include comprehensive Civil Rights legislation.\n\nThe Deep South have long been strong followers of the Nationalists and, to a lesser extent, the more conservative elements of the Democrats. As such, they have always had a reputation for acts of defiance against Civil Rights legislation, but nothing quite to this extent. As of right now, it is unknown why Strom Thurmond and George Wallace have promoted such extreme protest, and only time will tell if it has any true impact on the President's decisions.\n\nThe President himself, despite the furious Southern protestations, has declared that "a Great Society includes equality for all individuals, regardless of race, color, or creed". He has dismissed the protests as nothing more than "the Nationalists wishing they had true influence". It would appear that the stubborn Democrat President will hold his ground against Southern rage, but Congress may not."
 LBJ.14.a: "The South angry over Civil Rights. Typical."

 LBJ.15.t: "Progressives Outraged"
 LBJ.15.desc: "Protests are breaking out across the nation, especially outside of the South, as President Lyndon Johnson's landmark Civil Rights bill takes effect. The act, passed by the Senate last Sunday, was far more conservative than was expected from such a liberal President. It provided only moderate protections for the voting rights of African Americans, and provisions for a very slow desegregation process. Overall, the more liberal and progressive elements of the nation are in an uproar, but none more so than the Progressives.\n\nProgressive leaders, including Former Presidential Candidate [GetRFKOrJackson], have both decried the passing of President Johnson's bill, and commanded their supporters to "not stop pushing for true equality". They claim, among other things, that the new bill simply weakens the pro-Civil Rights movement by making its more moderate followers content, while no real issues are truly solved. When pressed for comment, President Johnson simply dismissed the protests as "angered radicals whining over a compromise that works for everyone" and that "the Great Society includes equal rights, but also requires healthy, stable transitions into that equality"."
 LBJ.15.a: "The Progressives are weak anyways."

 LBJ.16.t: "Blood on the Asphalt"
 LBJ.16.desc: "In at least half a dozen cities across the nation, most notably Birmingham, New York, and Los Angeles, African American communities are in chaos, their inhabitants taking to the streets to protest the passing of President Lyndon Johnson's landmark Civil Rights bill. The bill, which saw a fierce vote in the Senate between the Progressives and the Nationalists and Republicans, has widely been criticized by the former for its lack of deep protections for African Americans and their disadvantaged communities.\n\nIt now appears that many African Americans share that sentiment, as tens of thousands began demonstrating early this morning, calling the President a "traitor", among other names. In many cities however, notably Los Angeles and Birmingham, state governors sent in police and National Guard elements to disperse the protestors. Things became violent quickly, however, with the protestors using improvised weapons to fight back, as well as makeshift shields made from hubcaps and trash can covers to block the fire hoses the police attempted to disperse them with. By the end of the day, hundreds of shops, cars, and public buildings had been vandalized or burned.\n\nFighting appears to have been worst in Birmingham, where it appears that the local chapter of the Klu Klux Klan involved themselves when the demonstrations became violent. The Klansmen formed a temporary alliance with the police chief in charge of the operation, and soon came down upon the protestors with clubs and other weapons. Now, with most of the Birmingham riot concluded, at least 19 people, 12 of them African American, are confirmed dead."
 LBJ.16.a: "What a goddamn mess!"

 LBJ.17.t: "Southern Obstinance"
 LBJ.17.desc: "Today, President Johnson has held a press conference to address the major issues at hand with the implementation of Civil Rights across America. Many have openly claimed that discrimination is still heavily present across the nation, especially among police forces. The President, in a heavily anticipated statement, had this to say:\n\n"It has been a great many weeks since the passing of America's most recent Civil Rights bill. However, it has come to the attention of our administration that in many cities across America, the segregated areas remain due to extreme police prejudice; that African Americans are still forced into lower class status due to the strength of the lawmen who were commanded to protect them. Additionally, there have been claims that certain discriminatory, supremacist organizations have infiltrated many municipal police departments. After so many reports from so many sources, it is my opinion that immediate action must be taken to rectify this issue. As such, our administration will be moving to reshuffle suspect police forces, mandate heavier background checks and screening measures for new officers, and break up the bonds between many law enforcement agencies and third party elements, such as the Klu Klux Klan."\n\nAlready, the move has drawn criticism from the South, most notably from Alabama Governor George Wallace, who called President Johnson a "tyrant" for "his infringement upon the rights of states to enforce their own laws". It would appear that many politicians of the Nationalist wing of the National Progressive Pact are moving to block any legislation that the Johnson Administration can introduce to regulate municipal police. As it stands, it appears that if the President wishes to see his desires realized, he may have to do it through executive order."
 LBJ.17.a: "States' Rights, huh?"

 LBJ.18.t: "Continued Resistance"
 LBJ.18.desc: "The meeting room had a thick, uncomfortable air to it, caused in no small part by the unusually low ceiling and the burning cigarettes of Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. The smoking AG sat opposite President Lyndon Johnson, with Governor of Mississippi, Ross Barnett, sitting just a few seats down. "Kicking the Klan out of Southern police forces has been a more involved affair than previously thought," began Katzenbach.\n\n"Of course," replied Johnson, "that's why we're here. Something's not working and we need to determine what it is."\n\n"My recommended course of action is to break up the police departments at the core," said Katzenbach, "senior and junior officers need to be more separated, and suspect departments should have full federal investigations placed onto them."\n\n"Let's not push this too far," said Barnett, "too much pressure and you might be facing a case in the Supreme Court. The current stress you're putting on them is more than enough, it just needs time to sort itself out."\n\n"Fine then," sighed Katzenbach.\n\n"I think we should put some additional measures on, just a bit lighter, perhaps. The discrimination is supposed to be bad in Georgia. I'll call up Governor Garland Byrd and tell him how we want to get his state in line-- he won't refuse the President, even if he has proven difficult in the past. If our plans work in Georgia, we'll apply them to the rest of the South.""
 LBJ.18.a: "We can't just stop here."
 LBJ.18.b: "Hopefully the new rules work well."

 LBJ.19.t: "A Victory for the NPP"
 LBJ.19.desc: "Today, after the Johnson Administration suggested even stronger anti-police discrimination measures to the governor of Georgia, Lester Maddox, Alabama governor George Wallace gave an announcement on the steps of the Georgia State Capitol. In it, he called the new government suggestions "a further proof of federal tyranny" and that he "will not punish Southern police officers for simply doing their job". Wallace called upon all Southern States to resist any such requests by the federal government.\n\nPro-police organizations have gathered in many cities across the South in support of Wallace's rallying cry. Governor of Georgia, Lester Maddox, however, has commented little on the government suggestions as of yet, only saying he will not implement them. The South, it appears, will not bow to the Johnson Administration's new Civil Rights enforcement methods. What this means for the future is impossible to say, but the National Progressive Pact holds strong majorities in the South; majorities which seem here to stay.\n\nThe President himself was unavailable for comment on Governor Wallace's actions, but Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach had this to say: "Mister Wallace's claim, that the United States federal government is overstepping its constitutional bounds with this mandate, is simply unfounded. The government has a right to look out for its citizens.""
 LBJ.19.a: "Weak response from the government, but what can they do?"

 LBJ.20.t: "Days of Rage"
 LBJ.20.desc: "Once again, the nation is in uproar over the recent controversies surrounding the Johnson Administration's Civil Rights Act and their efforts to enforce it. Following a rebellious comment made by Alabama Governor George Wallace last week- one that many found offensive to African Americans and Civil Rights as a whole. Tens of thousands have poured out in protest in many major cities across the South, including Birmingham, Jackson, Atlanta, and New Orleans. These people are coming out not only against Wallace's statement, but also the Johnson Administration for allowing Southern States to refuse additional regulations.\n\nAs with prior Civil Rights demonstrations in the South, the protestors have come into conflict with municipal police forces, as well as local chapters of the Klu Klux Klan, in many cases. With violence dragging on into the afternoon, at least two hundred people have been injured, with around 34 dead. In several cities, such as Atlanta, the National Guard has been forced to step in and cease violence, with moderate success.\n\nSo far, responses from Governor Wallace or the Johnson Administration have been scarce, at best. Wallace has given only a few comments calling the protestors "a band of hooligans", before ordering the National Guard to restore order in some cities. President Johnson, on the other hand, has given no response whatsoever, with many White House sources claiming that he has secluded himself in the Oval Office, requesting not to be disturbed."
 LBJ.20.a: "Johnson... hiding?"

 LBJ.21.t: ""An Assault on Law and Order""
 LBJ.21.desc: "Both Dixiecrats and elements of the Nationalists have found themselves openly standing against the Johnson Administration after President Johnson himself refused to support the additional anti-discrimination measures proposed by Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. These changes come after more than a week of protests surrounding comments made by Georgia Governor George Wallace, in which he called upon the South to resist "tyrannical" government measures. In many cities, the protests became violent, taking a long time before either calming down or being stopped by local National Guard units.\n\nSenator Strom Thurmond called the week of protests an "assault on law and order", with Governor of Mississippi Ross Barnett calling it "the Days of Rage"-- a term now popular across much of the nation. Now, even the original anti-discrimination measures proposed by the Johnson Administration are being ignored in the South. The Klu Klux Klan seems to be openly working with local authorities, and hate crimes have skyrocketed. Overall, the past few weeks have proven disastrous for the President and the Democratic Party, and Johnson will likely see much more emboldened resistance from the South in the future."
 LBJ.21.a: "Disastrous!"

 LBJ.22.t: "Tough on Racism"
 LBJ.22.desc: "There has been a rise in the number of Civil Rights cases that have been working their way through the Department of Justice lately, with prosecutors, FBI agents and more all investigating a variety of racist incidents throughout the South, bringing police officers, Klansmen, white supremacist leaders and others to trial for their violence, intimidation, and flouting Civil Rights laws. While the gears of justice move slowly, and not all of the cases will be decided in the government's favor, there is a growing outcry throughout the South that the Feds are overstepping their authority, trying to criminalize personal opinions and thoughts, trampling the First Amendment and dismantling states' rights. One particular case, where a hotel owner in Georgia was arrested for allowing a white mob to break into a black man's room, tie him up, smash his belongings and threaten to lynch him, has become the focal point of this opposition, with Yockey's faction of the NPP denouncing the FBI's case, arguing it was overstepping their authority when the state courts could have handled this (and, undoubtedly, let the white hotel owner and the mob to walk free). Yet, Yockey has gained support throughout the South for his standing up to The Man, and his efforts to make the Black equal."
 LBJ.22.a: "Not so fun when the boot is on the other foot, eh?"

 LBJ.23.t: "A Break in the Storm"
 LBJ.23.desc: "After many weeks of sporadic protesting over the inability of the Johnson Administration to enforce its desegregation rules upon southern police departments, many cities across the South are beginning to calm down. With no protests and no injuries from clashes between the protestors and the Klu Klux Klan or police, it appears the violence is coming to an end. It appears Governor Maddox of Georgia and Governor Wallace of Alabama are also standing down, allowing the old federal rules to be enforced once more.\n\nThe period of violence, often called the "Days of Rage", led to weeks of violence between protestors and pro-police elements all across the South. These pro-police elements often consisted of the police themselves, as well as members of the white supremacist Klu Klux Klan. All told, over 60 Americans died during the fighting, with more than 1000 injured or hospitalized.\n\nIt appears the Johnson Administration, with the violence concluded, is moving to once again enforce its desegregation rules upon the South. After many weeks of chaotic, exhausting work, southern municipal police departments don't seem to be in a position to resist."
 LBJ.23.a: "Perhaps the fighting bled the Klan's support dry?"

 LBJ.24.t: "Dixiecrat Discomfort"
 LBJ.24.desc: "President Lyndon Johnson walked with his small cohort of Secret Service beneath the great dome of the Capitol. As the Senate was not currently in session, fewer people than usual stood in the rotunda, but one appeared to be approaching Johnson rather quickly. "Governor Ross Barnett," Johnson said, recognizing the man, "what a pleasant surprise. I was just going to meet with Rockefeller, care to join me?"\n\nBarnett did not appear to be in an amiable mood. "No, Mister President," he said curtly, "I just came here to say I was disappointed with your Civil Rights bills."\n\n"You voted for them, though, yes?"\n\n"Yes, but they went far beyond the scope of what we agreed too. You played too fast and too loose with the Southern Democrats' loyalty. We won't be so likely to give it next time."\n\nJohnson smiled, taking a step forward and placing his hand upon Barnett's shoulder. "Congressman... I only did what I thought was morally right and was best for the country. We're all one party, aren't we? Now, let me tell you something," he said, his smile turning sour, "if you ever threaten the integrity of the Republican-Democratic Coalition again, I'll run your career into the ground. Is that understood?"\n\nBarnett nodded begrudgingly. "Excellent," said Johnson, "as long as we're all in agreement, right?""
 LBJ.24.a: "Run along."

 LBJ.40.t: "Enforcement, One Way or Another"
 LBJ.40.desc: "Beau Albright stepped out of his car, the balmy air of another sunny Alabama morning warming his skin. He walked along the sidewalk to the entrance of his pride and joy: Albright Deli and Butcher. Some people might think running a butcher store to be a poor career, but Beau had built this store with his bare hands and he was exceedingly proud. He unlocked the door, stepped inside, and began his work of breaking down a fresh hog he had received yesterday.\n\nNot long after he had finished splitting the pig into its constituent parts, a man in a suit stepped through the door, flanked by the local sheriff, James Green. The suited man introduced himself as David Smith, an attorney from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The federal man was definitely an out-of-towner from his yankee accent. "Mister Beau Albright," he began, "I am here to inform you that your business is in violation of new federal Civil Rights mandates. You must remove your 'Whites Only' sign."\n\nBeau stood there, as if not comprehending the man's words. He looked at Sheriff Green, who shrugged. "I built this place with my own two hands," he said, "don't I got a right to choose who I let into my store? Them is a dirty folk; if I start lettin' em in, I'll lose all my good customers."\n\n"If you don't start letting them in," said the yankee, "I have the authority to pursue legal action against you, potentially leading to the condemnation of your property. Take down your sign."\n\nWith that, the yankee turned on a heel and left the dumpy little butcher shop. Beau looked at Sheriff Green. "You can't let that carpet-baggin' son of a bitch do this to me," he said, "this is a violation of my rights!"\n\nSheriff Green sighed, "If you're really angry, call the governor's office. I hear he's already givin' the yankees in Washington an earful. We'll get through this. Don't worry though, I doubt that attorney's gonna show up again. I won't tell him if you keep the sign up.""
 LBJ.40.a: "The Feds are trying to enforce Civil Rights?"

 LBJ.41.t: "Stubborn Southern Businessess"
 LBJ.41.desc: "Lyndon Johnson looked over the contents of the manila folder laid out on his desk. It was a report of thousands of businesses across the South who had refused to observe the new desegregation rules that the government had been attempting to enforce for the past few weeks. Flipping through pages and pages of names, dates, and places, the President finally reached the end of the report. "Given the vast amount of resistance to Civil Rights, it seems necessary that for more effective enforcement, more strict punishments for offending entities are in order."\n\nJohnson sighed. He knew that the South would always try to push back against such measures. Any single step he took in any direction would cause a massive amount of political backlash, either in the South or in the rest of the nation. Few men knew just how hard it was being President, and rarely was it more difficult than in situations such as these. He could do nothing; or do something, and be hated."
 LBJ.41.a: "This has gone on long enough. Federal policing is the only way."
 LBJ.41.b: "The problems will go away on their own, right?"

 LBJ.42.t: "The Shifting Winds"
 LBJ.42.desc: "Beau Albright stepped out of his car, stretching his legs after the long drive to Legion Field Stadium in Birmingham. His wife stepped out beside him, and they began to walk to the entrance. "I'm glad the governor is holding a rally about this whole integration business. They ain't got no business being in my store, no matter how much that damn yankee attorney tells me I can't stop 'em."\n\n"Oh, Beau," said Penelope, "you ain't never been so riled up before. It was a three hour drive to Birmingham, I'm surprised you're still so upset. Anyhow, I sure do hope there's good seats for us."\n\nThey filed past the ticket inspector's booth into the stadium. It was filled with thousands of people; even down on the field, thousands of filled seats surrounded George Wallace's platform in the middle. Beau and Penelope surprisingly found empty seats there, not 50 feet from the governor. They sat and listened to George Wallace talk about segregation for what felt like half an hour. "Now," said Wallace, "who here is a small business owner?"\n\nBeau stood up in a sea of seated men and women. Wallace called him up to the stage. "What's your name, friend? Have you been to a National Progressive rally before?"\n\nBeau almost seized up in front of the thousands who were watching. "Uh, my name's Beau. Beau Albright. My shop was forced to let in them by a fed'ral inspector. Uhm... I ain't never really cared for politics-"\n\nHis words were cut out by a thunder of applause from the audience. George Wallace took the microphone from Beau's hands. "Do you hear that? An average, nonpartisan businessman was forced, against his will, to integrate. This is what President Johnson wants! He wants to take away our right to choose, not just as states, but as people. He's stepping up his enforcement measures and I say let him! The National Progressive Pact will stand for what's right. As I have said many times before: segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!""
 LBJ.42.a: "At least the new rules are being enforced."

 LBJ.43.t: "A Civil Outburst"
 LBJ.43.desc: "Strong criticism for the Johnson Administration this week as it appears the President has failed on his promise of enforcing Civil Rights and desegregation rules across the country. A report from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare which leaked last Friday claimed that thousands of businesses and private entities across America, particularly in the South, are refusing to bow to desegregation rules. These businesses explicitly refused to take down their "Whites Only" signs. Noncompliant businesses such as these have so far not received any punishment or legal repercussions.\n\nMany progressives in Congress have now declared that they will no longer stand behind the Johnson Administration for its inaction on this issue. In fact, several have declared themselves aligned with the Marxist wing of the National Progressive Pact. So far, President Johnson has yet to comment on this exodus of progressive politicians from his side, and it appears as though he will not take action against the law-breaking entities that have refused to accept the Civil Rights Act."
 LBJ.43.a: "Maybe inaction wasn't the best choice."

 LBJ.60.t: "Those to Include"
 LBJ.60.desc: "Lyndon Baines Johnson sat in the Oval Office, the rare pleasure of pure, unabashed silence consuming the room. Paper after paper, meeting after meeting: the day had been a long one, and the Sun was just now caressing the western horizon. Suddenly, the door creaked open, and through it entered Vice President Edmund Muskie; the two proposals for a new immigration bill had been finally finished. "Republican written," said Muskie, placing the one down in front of Johnson. "Democrat written," he said, placing the other.\n\nJohnson exchanged no words with Muskie; he simply sat, scanning his eyes through the Republican written immigration bill. It was very long, very thorough, and very restrictive. Immigration quotas would be increased, but upheld; travel to the United States from Germany and Japan would remain heavily restricted; and it would only slightly lessen requirements on applying for a visa. In short, it was extremely conservative, as he expected it to be. Technically, it wasn't even totally written by Republicans- the Southern Democrats had a part in writing it as well- but the Republicans always did have a tendency to drown out others.\n\nNext, Johnson flipped through the Democratic proposal. At this point, it was just a rough draft- still subject to significant future revision- but the groundwork and basic contents were there. Johnson found it to be much more amiable to his plans than the previous one. If implemented, the bill would remove immigration quotas entirely; open up travel to and from Germany, Japan, and other foreign powers; and generally lessen restrictions on entering the United States, which have been very strict since the end of the Second World War.\n\n"Which one are we gonna move forward with?" asked Edmund Muskie. "If we go ahead with the Republican proposal, we'll probably garner some more votes with it, so it's more assured. Our proposal, on the other hand, is much more in-line with our policies and campaign promises, but it'll be harder to push through Congress and the Republicans will consider it a slap in the face.""
 LBJ.60.a: "The Democratic Proposal! Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."
 LBJ.60.b: "The Republican Proposal. We have to be careful."

 LBJ.61.t: "Hans' Tale"
 LBJ.61.desc: "Hans stood on the main deck of the SS Columbia, a shipping barge, as the massive ship pulled into port in New York City. The large vessel passed by Ellis Island, a mighty woman with a torch watching over the bay: Lady Liberty. This was everything Hans had ever hoped for and more. As Germany had fallen to pieces around him, he fled from his university dormitory to Denmark, and then to Scotland. For more than a year he had bided his time in Scotland, struggling to learn English, drifting from job to job, and desperately seeking an entry visa into the United States.\n\nHans' wish finally came true with President Lyndon Johnson's new immigration bill, which, after decades of hostility, allowed German nationals to enter the United States. Of course, one still had to obtain a visa, but no longer was travel to America limited to the rich or the powerful in Germany; now, even poor little Hans could pop onto a ship to a new world for a new life.\n\nThe barge was reeled into port on the north side of Manhattan. Walking down the plank onto the concrete dock, the Hudson River at his back, and the wind in his hair, he had finally arrived. America! The stench of ocean salt and garbage and industrial pollutants dominated the air, but Hans could care less. It was less the smell of refuse and more the taste of liberty.\n\n"Hey, you!"\n\nHans turned around to see a greasy-looking dock worker with jet black hair and a distinct accent talking to him. "Ya just gonna stand there or can we gets to work unloadin' this boat?"\n\n"I'm sorry," replied Hans in his thickly-accented English, "I just arrived from... Sweden. My name is John."\n\nThe man looked over him, a pensive look in his eye. "Well, John the Swede, I'll need a few more hands on the docks soon. How'd youse like a job workin' for me?"\n\nHans looked out over the massive hive of humanity called Manhattan. So much was different and new and breathtaking: the Empire State Building; jet planes flying far overhead; the hustle and bustle of the living, breathing city of New York. He had finally made it."
 LBJ.61.a: ""Yes," replied Hans, "I'd love a job.""

 LBJ.62.t: "Concerns Among the Southern Democrats"
 LBJ.62.desc: ""Mr. President, this is a disaster and you know it!"\n\nLyndon Johnson repressed the urge to sigh over the phone. Usually, when someone like Congressman Syd Herlong kicked up a fuss, he'd invite him over for a chat, and then loom over him until the errant soul got the picture. Right now, though, he'd have to sit in the Oval Office and take it. Syd wasn't the only Democrat pissed over the contents of the new immigration bill, but goddamn was he loud.\n\n"My district already has plenty of illiterate foreigners and infiltrators, so we sure as shit don't need more! But you... you kowtowed to those Progressive bastards when you KNOW they'd never vote for either of us! I don't have to tell you that this will hurt the unity of our party. And it's fragile already!"\n\nJohnson checked his watch. In a few minutes, the Floridian would probably have yelled himself hoarse. And then it would be on to the next call from the next angry legislator."
 LBJ.62.a: "It's going to be a long day."

 LBJ.63.t: "Those to Exclude"
 LBJ.63.desc: "As work continues on the new immigration bill, an important matter has come to the forefront: skills. Many applicants would surely have backgrounds in medicine, engineering, and science. At the same time, many others lack such abilities, and would instead move into the service and agricultural sectors. The question is, do we want to establish a set of strict skills criteria for potential immigrants? It would likely appease the nativists in Congress who make noise about unskilled labor taking American jobs, but at the same time, progressives would prefer a generally open and tolerant policy. So, what system should we follow?"
 LBJ.63.a: "Send us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses!"
 LBJ.63.b: "We need doctors, not line cooks!"

 LBJ.64.t: "The Rising Fear"
 LBJ.64.desc: "Over the past several weeks, America has borne witness to a new firestorm of anti-immigration sentiment. Stoked by activists on the far right of the National Progressive Pact, protesters have gathered at state capitols and federal buildings across the country. While most of the protests are small in number, they're plenty noisy. Placards proclaiming "FOREIGN SPIES OUT", "HEY HEY LBJ-TRAITOR TO THE USA", and "AMERICA FOR AMERICANS" are plastered to television news screens from San Jose to Bar Harbor. Meanwhile, TV and radio ads discussing everything from Argentine fascists to black South African radicals are hitting the airwaves. While opinion polling shows that most Americans disapprove of this sentiment, it's exceedingly difficult to ignore."
 LBJ.64.a: "Are we not a nation of immigrants?"

 LBJ.70.t: "Provisions and Legal Exemptions for Housing"
 LBJ.70.desc: "The Civil Rights Act of 1866 allowed all citizens to rent, hold, sell, and buy property, but gave the federal government no means to enforce this principle. African American leaders are adamant that without equitable access to housing there will never be equality of opportunity. We are counting on overwhelming support from black voters to survive the wave of backlash to our civil rights agenda; we need to pass a bill that meets their standards.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nationalists have been most successful in mobilizing opposition with the language of housing discrimination. White communities fear losing their more subtle means of resisting integration, even conservative Republicans who nominally support civil rights are making noises about the freedoms of association and commerce in response to our feelers.\n\nOur policy teams have come up with several options for our proposal to Congress on housing rights thanks to their creative writing skills. We can pass a strong bill that limits exemptions, a bill that retains the strong language of the former while introducing enough carve-outs to at least limit the speed of integration, or a token bill that omits protection or jurisdiction for those targeted for pursuing housing."
 LBJ.70.a: "A strong stand on racial inequity."
 LBJ.70.b: "Compromises must be made."
 LBJ.70.c: "Let's just hope they don't read too closely."

 LBJ.71.t: "Northern Backlash"
 LBJ.71.desc: "Every other northern mayor is shouting up the flagpole about the exceptions they'll need to the proposed housing legislation, but discontent is still largely private. Cities that saw their black populations grow during industrial booms are especially cognizant of how much the Fair Housing Act will change the makeup of their neighborhoods in the long run.\n\nIn private meetings the administration's surrogates highlight the carvouts intended to allow local governments to control the speed and manner of integration, but that line carries water for few. Opponents highlight the new discriminatory crimes created by the bill as unenforceable. Calls are increasing for the bill to be weakened, a decision that has wracked the President for days."
 LBJ.71.a: "We need to hold firm."
 LBJ.71.b: "Add more exceptions."


 LBJ.72.t: "Progressive Backlash"
 LBJ.72.desc: "The Fair Housing Act has seized the national spotlight, and not in a good way. Its sweeping protections and robust enforcement mechanisms put the writing on the wall for many all white communities. Town halls from Massachusetts to California are full of angry white homeowners fretting about how its passage will affect property values, schools, and crime.\n\nThe NAACP has launched listening tours in most states to encourage and advise the first black families moving into previously discouraged areas. This endeavor has been covered breathlessly in the press, portrayed somewhere between a violent invasion and a conspiracy.\n\nEven some Progressive politicians have publicly criticized the bill, and there are widespread calls to weaken it."
 LBJ.72.a: "In defense of liberty..."
 LBJ.72.b: "A few concessions is a small price to pay."

 LBJ.73.t: "Conservative Backlash"
 LBJ.73.desc: "Much of the strongest opposition to the proposed Fair Housing Act is coming from conservatives. A prominent Louisiana radio host went on a diatribe against "the cursed monoparty" yesterday, excoriating conservatives for throwing in with a Democratic Party that clearly no longer shares their values. The Democrats is being caricatured as the puppets of "organized black agitators" trying to bring crime and lawlessness to white communities.\n\nIt's unknown what electoral consequences this new messaging will have, but it has thrown the RDC and NPP into flux."
 LBJ.73.a: "Conservatives are weighing their options."

 LBJ.74.t: "Muddy Waters"
 LBJ.74.desc: "Backlash towards the Fair Housing Act has reached a fever pitch. An outspoken supporter of the bill, an Progressive member of the Illinois State House, was brutally beaten last night. His masked assailants left racist graffiti and their tire iron at the scene of the crime. This attack has crystallized support for the bill generally among many in that wing, but liberal support of the bill is still lacking.\n\nA group of senior Republican congressmen came to President Johnson today and warned that pushing through the Fair Housing Act would do irreparable damage to the RDC. They argue that driving white voters towards the Nationalists en masse would do more to hurt civil rights in the long-term than taking a loss on this issue. Johnson argues that it's no better than ceding civil rights to the Progressives, but his colleagues prefer not to throw the already unstable party alignments into chaos. With both houses of Congress gearing up for a melee, it's time for the administration to make a final decision on whether to put forward the Fair Housing Act or not."
 LBJ.74.a: "...extremism is no vice."
 LBJ.74.b: "...extremism is unpopular."

 LBJ.75.t: "An Unfair Deal"
 LBJ.75.desc: "President Johnson looked out at the two groups of protesters screaming at his fence.\n\nOn his right, a uniformly white crowd; "Suburbs Survive Annexation... This Time!", "No Black Supremacy", "End Johnson's Drum Circle". On his left, a crowd of young adults of every race; "Lyndon B. Jellyfish", "Bows to Nazis at Home, Abroad", "End Segregation".\n\nTurning his attention back to the latest internals, he felt another wave of anxiety about the course he had taken on housing. While the withdrawal of the bill had relieved many in his own party, it did nothing to change segregationists' low opinion of the administration. There was simply no way to balance Americans' demands, he told himself. This issue will have to be legislated on the state level. Most likely by Marxist governors, if this latest focus group of progressives is at all accurate.\n\nThe chants from both groups got significantly louder as he reached the page showing his favorables. He shook his head and allowed himself a small chuckle."
 LBJ.75.a: "At least they can agree on something."

 LBJ.76.t: "The Most Basic Need"
 LBJ.76.desc: ""In my many years of service as a legislator for the great state of Texas, my belief fortified in the ability of our country to legislate through issues of the greatest import and severity. The issue of equal rights has been festering since the founding of our sanctified nation. Even if we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation. The failure of any of any American, regardless of race, to rise to the station and prosperity merited by their strength of character and wealth of enterprise is a betrayal of the American dream. I want to speak about a specific crisis of inequity before us today."\n\n"The lack of fair access to housing is an inequity that perpetuates all other racial injustices. Because of race, fathers are denied access to employment, their children access to schools; all through the myriad, sinister confines imposed on their accruement of property. Across the country, actors of hatred conspire to limit the bounds of freedom afforded to their fellow Americans. The time for local action to free the black homeowner has passed, we need federal action to break the back of these malign interests."\n\n"To my opponents here, and to those who would seek to avoid action by their National Government in their own communities, the answer is simple: attack the racial bias of lenders, sellers, and renters with all your might. Make a world where the passage of the Fair Housing Act is a distant and antique necessity. Until that world is reality, the United States will be there to protect the rights and opportunities of all its citizens, black or white.""

 LBJ.80.t: "Establishing the "Head Start" Programs"
 LBJ.80.desc: "To achieve his dream of eradicating poverty, President Johnson has established the Head Start Program. This initiative, under the auspices of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, is just the first of what is hoped to be many by the Johnson administration, in an effort to improve the plight of young children in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods -- and particularly those of minority groups.\n\nHead Start offers summer programs and evaluations to ensure that children from low-income families succeed in adjusting to elementary education, and are sufficiently developed, cognitively speaking, in order to succeed in school.\n\nOpposition from conservative circles has been somewhat muted, partially due to the fact that popular support for Head Start is fairly high. More vocal opposition to further encroachment on the states' prerogatives of education will only mount should the administration choose to move that way."
 LBJ.80.a: "These are just the first steps."

 LBJ.81.t: "Assessment of the Teachers' Unions"
 LBJ.81.desc: "One of the planned landmark pieces of legislation President Johnson hopes to pass is the so-called Elementary and Secondary Education Act. While the draft is still rough, ESEA will increase federal funding to schools across the board, as well as focus on parental involvement in public education. While his allies in Congress craft the bill itself and marshal congressional support to ensure its easy passage, the President himself has elected to meet with the most powerful teachers' unions in the country to ensure their support for his newest initiatives.\n\nOne of the most notable demands with the unions is to relax federal control over the methods by which teachers may engage with students and teach coursework in the classroom. There has already been some strong opposition to such a proposal, as it may allow "dissident" and "un-American" ideas to proliferate among young children and teenagers in our schools. Furthermore, promising such a reform may weaken our support among conservative Republicans and the staunchest anti-communists and anti-fascists. Others, however, posit that it may be a new radical step in allowing personalization of education, tailored toward the individual needs of students, and may overall improve the quality of education of our young people."
 LBJ.81.a: "Reform in education is part and parcel to establishing the Great Society."
 LBJ.81.b: "Perhaps we shouldn't go too far."

 LBJ.82.t: "Complaints of Federal Overreach"
 LBJ.82.desc: "Though Head Start has proven pretty popular among both the general populace and among policymakers at every level of government, President Johnson has come under increasing assault by conservatives -- many even within his own party -- that accuse him of tyranny for having overstepped his bounds for his plans to greatly expand the mandate and scope of the federal government.\n\nSeveral southern governors, backed by their state legislatures, and supported by numerous federal Congressmen, have demanded that the President guarantee certain privileges in education that will belong to the states and the states only, in an effort to stem the tide of what they have termed "increasing federal overreach bordering on federal tyranny." The President's supporters, as well as northern liberals, have urged Johnson to push forward in his program, criticism be damned.\n\nThus, determined as ever, President Johnson has continued to forge ahead on his legislative agenda. The Southern Democrats, and conservatives generally within the party, are none too pleased."
 LBJ.82.a: "Petty squabbling cannot be allowed to stem the tide of progress."

 LBJ.83.t: "Material Provisions"
 LBJ.83.desc: "The final stages of debate surrounding ESEA have begun: how much money should be committed to the program? The growing coalition of conservatives who find themselves increasingly opposed to the President's education policies have requested a more watered-down appropriations commitment in the bill. Lessening the strain on the federal budget can allow for improved budgets for the Department of Defense, or simply stave off any risk of budgetary default in the future.\n\nThe President's allies in the Congress believe it is wholly likely for the bill to pass even with a stronger financial commitment to primary and secondary education. The question is whether the President wishes to further strain his relations with the powerful conservative lobby within his party.\n\nFor Johnson's part, he would sooner scatter the most virulent opponents to his agenda to the four winds. But, as Johnson learned in all his years in the Senate, sometimes, in politics, other considerations must be made."
 LBJ.83.a: "Government is best which is closest to the people."
 LBJ.83.b: "We can't afford to agitate the conservatives right now."

 LBJ.84.t: ""Budgetary Concerns""
 LBJ.84.desc: "Rain fell down in great sheets over Washington. "Lyndon, I cannot, in good conscience, allow this bill."\n\nPresident Johnson's hands were in his pockets, his gaze out on the South Lawn. A peal of thunder in the distance briefly overwhelmed the soft patter of rain on the windows of the Oval Office. Senator Russell was here again, voicing his concerns over the administration's agenda. "With all respect, Lyndon, you must take care to respect the wishes of those constituents throughout the South -- and not just mine in Georgia. A great number of good people do not think dumping millions into this program will do much to improve the welfare of these minority children--"\n\nJohnson suddenly drew himself up, his eyes alight. He snapped on his heels and briskly walked up to Russell, planting himself right in front of him. Their noses were an inch apart; the buttons on their jackets were touching. His voice boomed. "Senator, I do not give a rat's ass about those damn constituents! I have not met with every member of the Congress, held meetings with twenty teachers' unions across the entire country, crafting this bill to perfection -- just to be told 'no' by a few bigots voting for a party to which I owe no allegiance!" Russell froze, his lips tight, his eyes staring into the President's. There was a moment of silence. Calmly, Johnson continued. "Senator, I would ask you kindly to relay to your colleagues that my position on this is final. That is all."\n\n"Okay, Lyndon. As you wish." Johnson turned back around, walking past the Resolute Desk, again staring back out the rain-drenched window.\n\n"And you will address me as Mister President.""
 LBJ.84.a: "They will not crush us."

 LBJ.90.t: "Funding for Public Schools"
 LBJ.90.desc: "A massive first draft of the so-called Higher Education Act was strewn about on the President's desk. Johnson's glasses hung low on his nose, his hand at his forehead, the other gripping page ninety-six of the document. He had been reading and editing and re-reading for hours now -- he wasn't quite sure how long. This draft was what he had asked for, all right -- and it was going to be a damned nightmare to push through Congress.\n\nAfter the rigmarole the conservatives threw the President through over the writing and passage of ESEA, it is indeed very likely that HEA will receive sharp criticism from budget hawks in Congress. Furthermore, directly aiding many colleges could possibly be viewed as favoritism. With party relations such as they are, committing to the funding plank could very well cause irreparable damage. If such damage were significant enough, the President's own chances at re-election could be jeopardized. However, Johnson's staunchest allies and supporters insist he commit to the university aid program on principle, arguing that the electoral drawback from doing so would be minimal at worst, and nonexistent at best.\n\nJohnson drew his red pen and marked out a line on the paper. "No, this won't do," he muttered to himself, scribbling a correction in the margin.\n\nThen again, not everyone could be pleased, and an effort in trying to please everyone was an effort wasted."
 LBJ.90.a: "No free society persisted which did not champion free learning and knowledge"
 LBJ.90.b: "We have already done enough in this regard."

 LBJ.91.t: "Public College Scholarships"
 LBJ.91.desc: "The second plank of HEA is an expansion of federally-provided scholarships to distinguished students applying for college admittance. This part of the bill would be far less controversial, and would be more likely to engender more broad support across party lines, barring disagreement over the minutiae of who is chosen to receive the scholarships, how they are administered, and how much the scholarships would be worth.\n\nThe primary concern with this bill is the same as always: the financial burdens of the federal government grow with each year, and budgetary concerns must be considered when bringing all proposals to the table. Aside from the extremists basing their arguments on racial logic, most opposition to HEA is organizing around rhetoric arguing for financial considerations. The educational debates being as fierce as they have been, it could ultimately be best to avoid such a commitment, and to move on to the next item on the Great Society agenda."
 LBJ.91.a: "No burden is too great to ensure the survival and success of liberty."
 LBJ.91.b: "We need not bury the government further under spending it cannot afford."

 LBJ.94.t: "The Compromise Draft"
 LBJ.94.desc: "After days and weeks of intensive negotiations over the proposed Social Security Expansion Act, enough Republican lawmakers have been convinced to support a "Compromise draft" for the rest to fall in line. This piece of legislation, while broadly similar to the unmodified bill, contains changes that narrow its scope somewhat. Payments have been reduced across all programs, provisions put in to make sure information about the programs reaches all eligible citizens have been gutted, and the clauses on Family Assistance have been rewritten to apply only to married couples. Many in the administration believe the "Compromise draft" as written amounts to an exclusion of some of the people in most dire need of assistance. Still, its passage has the potential to be a major victory for President Johnson and his choice to emphasize party unity on the matter.\n\nThere is, however, another price to be paid. A source of great consternation among the Republican wing must be removed. The President must sever his alliance with "Scoop" Jackson and the Progressives. The administrations have sent out feelers for possible alternative compromises, but all their suggestions have been rejected. The Republicans have made up their minds, and no amount of further negotiation, backroom dealing, appeals to party unity or outright bullying tactics will change them.\n\nThe President has a choice to make."
 LBJ.94.a: "We will do what we must to maintain unity"
 LBJ.94.b: "This is a step too far. They can't dictate who we work with"

 LBJ.95.t: "Hopes Dashed"
 LBJ.95.desc: "The end of the short-lived alliance between President Johnson and "Scoop" Jackson is the topic of every conversation in the National Progressive Pact, and will likely continue to be for some time. Jackson had staked a lot of prestige on their association, which had been considered a major victory within the party, proof of their ability to influence policy making on the highest level.\n\nThe Progressives' leadership had hoped they would now act as a counterweight to the conservative wing of the RDC, and that they could leverage that position to make policy gains. The passage of a substantial Social Security Expansion Act would be a crowning achievement, ushering a new era for the country and securing the Progressives a seat at the table for the foreseeable future. When the President chose instead to cave to the demands of that very same conservative wing and end his association with Jackson, and then to pass a watered down bill, it felt to many in the party like they were relegated, again, to the sidelines.\n\nJackson's disappointment was plain to all when he publicly decried the Compromise Bill as "a victim, in my opinion, of putting party before country", which "denies support and opportunity to those Americans most in need of it". This gloominess does not extend, however, to the Nationalist faction, whose lawmakers have made their approval of the revisions in the bill no secret. Their celebratory mood is beginning to give rise to considerable resentment in the rest of the party, once again calling into question the viability of an alliance between such a strange set of bedfellows."
 LBJ.95.a: "Strange times make for a lot of bickering."

 LBJ.96.t: "Toeing the Party Line"
 LBJ.96.desc: "No-one in the White House or the Halls of Congress could avoid sensing the recent shift in atmosphere. Relations between the main wings of the Republican-Democratic Coalition are at a low, with accusations of putting personal agendas ahead of party unity and stability abounding behind closed doors, and a relationship that was never warm in the first place is cooling further.\n\nThe latest fault-line is the passage of the Social Security Expansion Act, which is clearly more important to the President than keeping the Republican wing of his party content. Great effort has been expended in recruiting every supporter of the Act in pressuring, badgering and bullying its detractors into submission. Most of the Republican lawmakers have fallen in line, seemingly judging that they still have too much to lose if they publicly speak out against their coalition.\n\nFor many Republican voters, however, this is taken as another instance of the Democratic wing happily taking their votes while ignoring their interests, feeding a growing sense of disenfranchisement with the party. Also feeding that sense are the firebrands of the Nationalists, who are finding a waiting audience for their condemnations of "the Socialist-in-Chief" and his "attacks on the white working man of America"."
 LBJ.96.a: "The cost of doing business."

 LBJ.97.t: "The Progressives Show Their Support"
 LBJ.97.desc: "While facing opposition in his own party, President Johnson's all-or-nothing approach to the Social Security Expansion Act has found a source of support outside it: The Centrist faction of the National Progressive Pact. Henry "Scoop" Jackson has spoken warmly of the bill on multiple occasions, and this morning he contacted the administration on behalf of a group of senators from the Progressives. They are pledging their votes to ensure the passing of the Social Security Expansion Act in its current, comprehensive state.\n\nPresident Johnson is hailing their support as proof of the broad appeal of the Act and an important victory for the Great Society. Jackson, on his part, explains his support of the Act and willingness to cross the aisle to pass it as proof of his "commitment to America and the welfare of the common man.""
 LBJ.97.a: "We wish their votes welcome."

 LBJ.98.t: "A Win for the Alliance"
 LBJ.98.desc: "Ensuring the passage of the Social Security Expansion Act would be a major test for President Johnson and the strength of his alliance with the Progressives. A test, it appears, they have now passed. The Act passed through congress without major revision, and will cast a strong, wide, social security net for Americans for years to come. Henry "Scoop" Jackson has hailed the bill as a "triumph of bipartisan cooperation" and "a great victory for the people of the United States".\n\nWithin the RDC, it is very clear now that President Johnson's progressives are in the ascendancy, with conversations and planning focusing almost exclusively on how to build on their recent victory and little energy being spent on soothing ruffled feathers or bringing the Republican wing back into the conversation. Among Republican senators, a sense of unease is growing as they find the center of gravity in the coalition moving further and further away from them, with little opportunity to correct its course lest they be cut off from decision-making entirely. This unease extends to their voters. In traditional Republican strongholds, many are questioning their commitment to a coalition that they increasingly find themselves at the margins of."
 LBJ.98.a: "They'll come around."

 LBJ.100.t: "The Conservatives Are Grumbling"
 LBJ.100.desc: "Mr. President, the Great Society is starting to be put into effect. And good news: the overwhelming majority of Americans support our efforts to reform society to make it more equal and fair for those on the bottom of the totem pole. But as our efforts bear fruit in Congress, there are already rumbles of opposition building. Some conservatives in the Republican wing of the coaliton, as well as the Nationalists, are starting to complain in private, and there are anonymous op-eds in newspapers all over the nation denouncing the efforts.\n\nThere is really nothing to be worried about now: most of these people would never have voted for the Great Society anyway if it wasn't political suicide to support the first acts that are generally popular with the American people. The few that did vote against these acts did so on grounds of high cost, and the encroachment into the state's prerogatives, and not necessarily in regard to the ideas themselves.\n\nIn general, our plans are moving ahead, and still have wide support, so we should be able to continue pushing forward to make America a better, more equal nation."
 LBJ.100.a: "Good news!"
 LBJ.101.t: "The Moderates Are Content"
 LBJ.101.desc: "Mr. President, we've gotten more of the Great Society passed through Congress with the wide ranging majorities and support that these proposals and ideas have been receiving in polls for the past few months. In general, the people are with us, and Congress, including the RDC and much of the NPP, are still supportive, so we can expect the bipartisan support needed to get more through.\n\nThat said, some of the more conservative and moderate members of the Republican-Democrats are talking to staffers on Capitol Hill, and are feeling like we've already done a good job, and should maybe start winding down the Great Society. One Senator even said that we've done enough for this decade, and should let the next generation get a chance to do some stuff!\n\nWhile no one is breaking away and refusing to go along, we will most likely start seeing more resistance from the Republicans, and even some of the conservative Democrats, who believe that the Great Society has gone far enough. Any further Great Society acts could start arousing concerns of everything they like to worry about, like tax hikes, debt, socialism, and states' rights. So we should take this into consideration as we go forward."
 LBJ.101.a: "Duly noted."
 LBJ.102.t: "The Conservatives Are Upset"
 LBJ.102.desc: "Mr. President, I'm pleased to report that the most recent parts of the Great Society have been voted on by Congress, and are ready for you to sign into law. These new actions are important, just like they all are, and still have healthy majorities supporting them in Congress and across the country.\n\nHowever, there are some dark clouds on the horizon. Some Republicans voted against the last bill, some of those conservatives that like "small government" and "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps" and all that. While it wasn't enough to threaten the passing of these laws, it does mean that future laws will most likely require that we work with the Progressive faction of the NPP to ensure that we have enough support to pass through an increasingly divided Congress.\n\nYou should know as well as I do that this could be a problem: the Republican-Democrats were formed to keep the peace and stability of America first and foremost. If the RDC breaks apart, that can lead to much greater crisis and chaos in the future..."
 LBJ.102.a: "Message received."
 LBJ.103.t: "The Party Is Fracturing"
 LBJ.103.desc: "Mr. President, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. The good news is that we've pushed some more of the Great Society through, and the bills are ready for your signature to make them the law of the land. This will, of course, be a great success for the Administration, and help many Americans that need it most.\n\nThe bad news, however, is that the Republican-Democratic Coalition is starting to break. Many of the right-leaning Republicans are openly starting to back away from you and the coalition, denouncing our efforts as centralizing the government and "Bolshevism." Some congressmen are even crossing the aisle to the NPP. While most of them didn't like the Great Society in general, their leaving deals a blow to make your policies seem, at least on the surface, somewhat bipartisan.\n\nOn top of that, now the Republicans are starting to warm to the whole Great Society, but are starting to push us to go even further, make the plans more ambitious. They are really starting to sound like Harrington, or [GetRFKOrJackson]...\n\nHey now, don't throw that pen at me! I know you don't like [GetRFKOrJackson], but take it up with the Republicans. I'm just telling you what I've heard."
 LBJ.103.a: "I ain't no NPP!"
 LBJ.104.t: "The Republicans Are Leaving"
 LBJ.104.desc: "Mr. President, things are not looking good. Well, okay, they are looking good for the Great Society, and I know that is the most important thing right now. Yes, there is another bill for you to sign, and yes, we are still getting the laws through Congress. Even the poll numbers are still on the positive. But those numbers are just barely above the majority, and we are facing an internal political maelstrom: The Republican-Democratic Coalition is crumbling as we speak. Already, several big named Republicans have denounced us, and are crossing over to the Nationalists. This is really not good: if the RDC breaks up, then the Democratic Party that is left will never win another election.\n\nYou must understand, sir, that politics is my thing. I'm here to tell you what is and what isn't good for your political standing. I know the Great Society is great for America, and I will do what I can to get it passed. But with the party buckling, and the sides getting more partisan and restless, I don't know how much more I can do within the party.\n\nWe are going to have to rely on the moderates of the Democratic Party and Progressives to keep passing Great Society legislation, which should be enough to get it through Congress. But I really don't know how much further we can push this. And what will happen to American politics if we go much further..."
 LBJ.104.a: "Dems be damned, we will get this done!"
 LBJ.105.t: "The Nationalists Are Growing"
 LBJ.105.desc: "Mr. President, the latest polls are in. It's, well, not good news. For the first time, a majority of respondents are saying that they are feeling unsure about the cost of the Great Society. Fears that have been stoked by the Republicans and the Nationalists about higher taxes and more government control of their lives are starting to filter through the public. While the numbers of people who support the Great Society overall are still strong, we should be prepared to face growing backlash as we expand it.\n\nThere are commentators and political scientists that are talking increasingly of the new polarization of American society, all revolving around your plans, with progressives on the left pushing to go even further than the Administration wants, and conservatives on the right who are demanding a halt to the growth of government power and interference in the lives of citizens and undermining states' rights, and people in the middle who are tired of both extremes.\n\nThis is especially evident on the West Coast: while a majority were supportive of the Great Society at the beginning, now support is dropping, and dropping a lot quicker than in other places, namely about the cost. This is only going to get stronger, divide more Americans, and lead to a virtual breakdown of society into an "us vs. them" mentality that will make it even harder to pass further laws."
 LBJ.105.a: "Can I catch a break?"
 LBJ.106.t: "The Progressives Are Supportive"
 LBJ.106.desc: "Mr. President, there is a silver lining as the Republican-Democratic Coalition self-destructs around us over the Great Society programs. The Progressive faction of the NPP has proved to be a strong ally, even as the conservative Republicans flee to the Nationalists. As the Democrats who are left in the RDC lean more progressive, we are actually lining up with the Progressives on many social and economic issues, which should help make the Great Society legislation easier to pass and promote.\n\nOf course, there are going to be issues with working with the Progressives: they are much more established leftists and progressives than most Democrats, so the future proposals will lean even more toward them, and bolster their own support in future elections. There are even some Republicans calling you the first NPP President as we continue to work with them.\n\nPolitics has always made for strange bedfellows, and working with some of the folks on the other side of the aisle is, well, strange and discomforting at times. But at least working with Michael Harrington and Scoop Jackson is a lot easier, more pleasant, and less migraine inducing than with Barry Goldwater or Wallace Bennett. This will undoubtedly help us to get the Great Society pushed through the legislative branch easier, though in the end it may just destroy the RDC all together."
 LBJ.106.a: "First NPP President? At least it wasn't [GetRFKOrJackson]."
 LBJ.107.t: "The Progressives Are Mobilizing"
 LBJ.107.desc: "Mr. President, the most recent poll is in. Here, if you take a look... yes, that is right. That isn't a typo. Yockey's support has more than doubled their previous numbers. I know it's not a lot in the big scheme, they are still a tiny sliver of the electorate, and you can still point to general approval for the Great Society, but that right there should be worrying. Just that small number can make or break elections: just a few thousand votes in the right state can make all the difference.\n\nOh yes, and the other number: the Marxists are also gaining a boost too, and a fairly big one. As the rhetoric is ratcheting up, both opposed and in favor, those on the far left are seeing increasing support as well, seeking to get the Great Society to be even stronger and farther reaching. They are taking support from both the Republicans and even our allies in the Progressives.\n\nI really don't know what else to tell you. We are seeing the breakdown of the two party system as we've known it for the past two decades right in front of our eyes: the Republicans have defected, we are in bed with Harrington, and the nutcases on the extremes of the spectrum are looking better and better.\n\nMaybe we are pushing this too far?"
 LBJ.107.a: "I need a drink."
 LBJ.108.t: "The Sovereigntists Are Gaining"
 LBJ.108.desc: "You thought the last poll was bad, Mr. President, look at this one. I know. Double digit support for the Sovereigntists. The last few Republicans in the party are basically calling for your head, to impeach you, with the full support of the Nationalists. The remainder of the Democrats and the Progressives are trying their best to push through the last major proposals of the Great Society, but even they aren't sure if they can push through any more in the face of this opposition.\n\nCan I be honest? This is terrible. The "Party of Stability" is done. The RDC is virtually dead. An honest-to-god fascist is looking credible to a worrying large number of voters. The Marxists are pouncing at every opportunity to make us look like we are weak and not doing enough. Even our allies in Congress are exhausted and demoralized, and are ready to just give up, call it "Mission Accomplished," and go home. And I can't blame them.\n\nWe have to wake up to reality here. We are destroying American politics, just to push your vainglorious pet project through. Soon there will be nothing recognizable of either party left, and it will be a free for all in the next election."
 LBJ.108.a: "Hand me that bottle, I need another shot."
 LBJ.109.t: "The Political Landscape Is In Chaos"
 LBJ.109.desc: "I have no idea how you did it, Mr. President, but you single handedly managed to change the entire US political system. We are now in a heavily polarized, topsy-turvy time where old alliances are irreparably destroyed, friends are enemies, and families are turning on each other. People's allegiances now are either in favor or opposed to The Great Society: there is almost nothing that unites certain people more than either supporting you wholeheartedly and will march with you all the way to Hell, or thinking you are the Anti-Christ, Satan himself reincarnated. But the largest section of the population are just... done. They are exhausted, tired, and tuning out anything political.\n\nThe Republicans are now part of the National Progressive Pact's Nationalist wing, while the more liberal Progressive wing is more or less left-wing Democrats. Yockey's and Hall's supporters have claimed the extremes, and there are fights, protests and riots breaking out almost daily between those that want to see one or the other sit where you are sitting now.\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact that we have passed almost the entire Great Society program, I'd be terrified of your chances to actually get anything done in how bitterly divided and partisan the whole nation has become. But at least you have that under your belt."
 LBJ.109.a: "I just hope it was worth it."

 LBJ.112.t: "A Public Broadcasting Service"
 LBJ.112.desc: "Daniel had never been so excited. As television operations go, this one would be relatively standard. The only difference between it and all the work he had done for the Washington news broadcasters was that this would be nationwide. President Johnson had approved the Public Broadcasting Service only a few months ago. A coalition of small broadcasting networks had gotten together, and here he stood, ready for the first broadcast of PBS.\n\nThere would be words from the new President of the service, Hartford Gunn. He stood opposite Daniel, who operated a camera. Gunn shuffled some papers on the desk and straightened his tie. There was only one minute until the first broadcast. Daniel could feel his heart pounding as the clock slowly ticked down.\n\nDaniel raised his arm. "Live in... five... four... three... two..."\n\nThe screen showing the broadcast became consumed with the service's logo. "PBS," came a disembodied voice from the screen, "Be More.""

Senator Wallace F. Bennett's displeasure registered clearly over the phone. "Is the President's Great Society simply going to involve throwing people at busywork on the taxpayer's dime?"\n\nMuskie rolled his eyes; Bennett had never hidden his sourness over losing the '64 primaries. "Senator, the Office of Economic Opportunity is purely intended to complement the private sector and state-level job assistance -"\n\n"Tell me, then," Bennett remarked pointely, "how on Earth is the federal government supposed to know what jobs need filling in Scofield, Utah?"\n\n"I'm sorry, where - "\n\n"That's the point, Muskie! The OEO is trying to solve a problem that's better handled locally!" Bennett said emphatically. "If the President keeps going like this, we're going to find Republican voters slipping to George Wallace and his 'states' rights' people!"\n\n"Some states can't help everyone, Senator; that's where we come in." Muskie countered. "Just because it's going to be difficult, doesn't mean we shouldn't try.""
 LBJ.117.a: "Nothing great is ever easy."

 LBJ.124.t: "Conservatives Protest Social Security Expansion"
 LBJ.124.desc: "Opposition to Social Security Expansion has become the latest battleground for the divided American legislature. Attacks and criticism against the Act from factions in both parties have become a near-daily occurrence, and the steadfast refusal of the President to amend his piece of legislation is starting to cause considerable consternation in the Republican wing of the RDC. Privately and ever more publicly, the President is being accused of putting his personal agenda before the Party and endangering the alliance at the core of the RDC.\n\nAcross the South and in their strongholds in the rest of the country, the Nationalist faction of the NPP is denouncing the expansion in even clearer terms. According to them, the Act is "an overt attack on the American middle class" and a "subsidy paid to colored people by the white working man". Their strategy appears to be to tie increased welfare and higher payments to the issue of civil rights, and according to reports trickling back to Washington, it seems to be working. Many previously Republican districts are beginning to lean NPP.\n\nThis morning the governing party was rocked by the news of a handful of lawmakers, including three senators, crossing the aisle and officially switching to the NPP. While their move was condemned by both wings of the RDC in a rare show of unity, and there doesn't seem to be any more defections on the immediate horizon, it was a powerful reminder of the fragile structures underpinning Johnson's coalition."

 LBJ.125.t: "Conservatives Cross the Aisle"
 LBJ.125.desc: "After the recent embarrassment of several Republicans switching parties over our most recent attempt at expanding Social Security, some good news has come out of the Republicans. After much internal debate, a group of the more liberal Responsible Republicans has come forward finally giving some conditional support for the bill.\n\nWhile they still express concern over the source of funding, their current deal is a good sign for the future of our legislation and the seemingly shakey position our coalition has found ourselves in. While Johnson remains ever the hardball and stubborn, he is far from the idiot the NPP makes him out to be, and has, behind closed doors, agreed to the offer along with other high-ranking Democrats in the Senate.\n\nWhile this news has elicited celebration and pride within most in the ranks of the coalition, in the NPP and some parts of the Republican Party, alarm bells are already being sounded. Many in the Nationalists, especially down South, are parroting their previous words, ranting about how these actions prove the Republicans to be nothing but a bunch of "radical carpet baggers". Meanwhile, some Republicans are trying to save face, calling the move an unsanctioned and unsupported move within their party. They, at least, are a minority.\n\nStill this is undoubtedly good news for the administration and means we can move forward with this piece of legislation and further aspects of our agenda."
 LBJ.125.a: "Our ranks grow thicker."

 LBJ.126.t: "Paying the Piper"
 LBJ.126.desc: "Now that the shape of the Social Security Expansion Act is more or less settled, all that remains is to decide upon how to fund it. The projected cost of the programs is substantial, and there is no room to pay for it in the current budget. This means President Johnson and his administration have no other option than to enact new taxes.\n\nThere are two main camps within the administration. The first proposes a new tax on income specifically to support Social Security. While a new tax is never going to be a popular proposition, they believe they can make it easier to swallow for the electorate by framing it as an investment in their own retirement.\n\nThe second camp proposes a much wider tax reform. It contains changes to almost every system of tariffs, levies or taxes collected by the federal government, and the increase in revenue will leave us a lot of extra funding even after Social Security is provided for. This reform is certain to prove a very hard sell to the public, but the increase in funds gives the administration a lot of financial room to act going forward, and will all but guarantee we won't have to raise taxes again in the foreseeable future."
 LBJ.126.a: "The first option. We just need to fund Social Security."

Recent events in the South, where police officers have brutally assaulted a black man, which made the news across the nation, have pushed President Johnson and his allies in Congress to start putting together a program that will change the balance, to give racially oppressed minorities the rights that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution legally gives them, but for far too long has been ignored. This program would encourage business, academia, the civil service and others to hire more African Americans, as well as Indians, Latinos, Asians, and other minority groups to be more representative of the population as a whole.\n\nOf course, there are some that strongly disagree; claiming that the Black man is already equal in law, and that Civil Rights has gone too far, that this as yet unnamed program would make Blacks more powerful than whites. The opposition has coalesced around Francis Parker Yockey and his right wing supporters in the NPP, which has seen a boost in support in polls lately."
 LBJ.128.a: "The scales are only being tipped to make it more equal."

 LBJ.129.t: "Growing Socialism"
 LBJ.129.desc: "To some of our detractors, measures taken to implement the Great Society border on socialism. Yet to the Marxists, this is a good thing - and moreover, they're the ones responsible for it, by "putting pressure on the Johnson Presidency to actually enact laws which will help the working class". Not very convincing, but the Marxists are taking the credit anyway, and piggy backing on our success to grow their own movement."
 LBJ.129.a: "Is there really a place for socialism in America?"

 LBJ.130.t: "Working on Healthcare"
 LBJ.130.desc: "Rumors and leaks have been coming from the Administration that work toward the budget for a universal healthcare plan is currently ongoing. While the Press Secretary and the President himself won't say so officially, speculation is growing in Washington and around the country that soon the US will join virtually every other industrialized nation on the planet for a full and comprehensive medical insurance plan. While there is still a long way to go before the plan will be presented to the American people, and to convince a majority that it's in their best interest, the Marxist wing of the National Progressive Pact is already capitalizing on this outcome. Claiming that universal healthcare is thanks almost entirely to their pushing and continuing support, the Marxists have seen their support increase across the nation already."
 LBJ.130.a: "We haven't even finished putting it together yet!"

 LBJ.131.t: "Reluctant Republicans"
 LBJ.131.desc: "Whilst our administration has only acted in the best interest of the American people, we seem to have gone too far for some within our own party. A number of Republicans have publicly distanced themselves from some of our most recent measures, leading to a decline in support for the President from a segment of the electorate. Unfortunately, this weakens our ability to implement the change America needs."
 LBJ.131.a: "Ah, fuck 'em."

 LBJ.132.t: "A Great Society"
 LBJ.132.desc: "When Lyndon B. Johnson entered the White House in 1964, he entered that office with a promise on his lips. Before America's families and its workers, with God as his witness, and in full sight of a sketpical world, the President had promised a society where no child would go unfed, and no youngster would go unschooled. He had promised an end to racial discrimination, a healthcare system which would provide for America's sick, and an environment for our children to enjoy. For this agenda, President Johnson has been criticised fiercely from every quarter by those who would be the enemies of change. Yet he pushed on regardless, and however lonely that chair in the Oval Office can get, President Johnson can say he has made the Great Society a reality.\n\nIn the wake of the achievement of our promises, the Republican-Democrats have shown rare signs of improved cohesion. Yet this might prove fleeting. Implementing Johnson's agenda has alienated millions of former RDC voters, who are being wooed by the demagogues of the NPP and their unceasing attacks on our policies. Our own party's unity has been greatly strained by the Johnson agenda, making winning reelection a real challenge. Yet by God, the things we have achieved. We have given the American people hope, more so than they have dared to show in decades. And come what may, that is worth a lot."
 LBJ.132.a: "A Great Society for this country, the greatest country in the world."

 LBJ.134.t: "The Meeting"
 LBJ.134.desc: "President Johnson sat nervously during the entire meeting. Even with the gulf in political power between the two men, Johnson took on a humble and reserved tone when speaking to Martin Luther King Jr. President Johnson explained that he was eager to continue the struggle for Civil Rights and build upon the success of his Voting Rights Act. He said that Rev. King could tell his community that they have no greater friend in the fight for racial equality.\n\n"Indeed, we do not," Rev. King replied, "and the VRA was a true boon to our community's ability to make their voices heard at the polls. You can count on our support, Mr. President. Yet there's far more work that needs to be done than you may realize. Writing a few laws is easy, but solving the entrenched social inequality that the Black community faces in this country cannot be accomplished without fighting against the endemic poverty we face. The evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism are all tied together... you can't really get rid of one without getting rid of the others... the whole structure of American life must be changed."\n\nRev. King continued, "You can't talk about solving the economic problem of racial injustice without talking about billions of dollars. You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You're really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism. If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God's children to have the basic necessities of life, she too will go to hell."\n\nPresident Johnson was guarded in his response, saying that he was committed to fighting the War on Poverty as a key plank of his Great Society program. The President thanked MLK for all his support and the meeting concluded cordially."
 LBJ.134.a: "How great can the Great Society become?"

 LBJ.135.t: "Gaining the Black Vote"
 LBJ.135.desc: "The Republican-Democrats have accomplished one of the most monumental feats in social American history with the passing of the Voting Rights Act. Not only are the African Americans unimpeded on their way to vote, but they are now actively flocking to the polls, greatly increasing the voter turnout. The surge of African American votes is spread throughout the South, not only in the major cities of Birmingham, Atlanta, or Houston, but also in the smaller cities of Little Rock, Jacksonville, Biloxi. The population was even gaining ground in the poor rural areas of Central Alabama and the outskirts of the huge Georgia cities.\n\nBut Lyndon B. Johnson was hard at work today. It was inevitable that with proper representation, African Americans would go to the polls in huge numbers to show support for the party of their choosing. If Johnson could garner the African American vote, it is possible that the RDC could become the dominant political bloc in the South, displacing the NPP menace. This vote would make up for all the Dixiecrats that quickly deserted the party once the act was passed. Time was of the essence for President Johnson as he began to dial up activists, church leaders, professors all throughout the Deep South, starting with Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia..."
 LBJ.135.a: "We need the African Americans on our side!"

 LBJ.136.t: "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.136.desc: ""Now, I know that things haven't been going our way since we were first brought to America centuries ago. We suffered under the lash for years and years, not just in the United States, but throughout the entire continent. It was by the will of Abraham Lincoln and by the grace of God that our chains were finally broken. We had some success in American culture; we had Frederick Douglass, we had George Washington Carver, we had Rosa Parks. These people worked to put us in the spotlight. My fellow African Americans, though we still face prejudice, our words now matter. Our vote finally matters. Our lives finally matter."\n\n"Do you know who made this happen? The Democratic Party worked day and night to give us this opportunity. Our great President Johnson needs our help more than ever. He worked to give us the proper right to vote, he stopped every oppressive state that tried to lay a hand on us. I say we give back to him, to the Democratic Party. If you haven't realized yet, my friends, we need them too. We will accept the President's Great Society with open arms."\n\nAfter several months of campaigning, the Democratic Party started to win over some well-known activists to President Johnson's cause. These activists, in turn, reached out to the multitudes of African Americans in the South, persuading them to use their new vote for the party. While some progress has been made down South among the new black voters, there is still a long way to go before the Democrats could ever become relevant again in the region."
 LBJ.136.a: "At least we're making progress."

 LBJ.137.t: "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.137.desc: ""Look how the world around us is changing with President Johnson at the helm. We've been given the incredible voting privilege that has eluded us countless times in the past. Our poorer blacks in the South are more likely to afford cheap housing thanks to President Johnson's Fair Housing Act. The schools for our black children are being given more funds, and they are being recognized for their academic achievements. Our older blacks are receiving the care they so desperately need thanks to the new Medicare program. Folks, I see a lot of potential with the Democratic Party after looking around at the Great Society we are living in. If we keep voting Democrat, I believe all American lives will get better and better."\n\nOur campaigning is proving to be very successful at gaining the African American vote in the South. The more activists we influence, the more momentum we gather to topple the traditional parties that have dominated the South for decades. We have noted a substantial increase in popularity among blacks in poorer regions, which can only mean that our Great Society is working.\n\nOur campaign has shown some slight flaws: our hardcore traditional whites have started to denounce our platform, claiming that we are "ceding too much to the blacks", but this would come naturally with the addition of new party voters. The issue should not gather enough support to put a dent in our party, but it is something to monitor. Nevertheless, every black voter who once faced oppression at the booth now prepares to defend their newly-given vote with all they have. Our reforms are truly reaching out to all Americans."
 LBJ.137.a: "Even more support from the African American community."

 LBJ.138.t: "Winning Over Black America!"
 LBJ.138.desc: ""Now we have a choice in this next election. We can go with the Democrats, who keep backing us up and will have our back until the end of time, or we can choose the radicals in the NPP who want to tear this country apart and go back to square one. Ultimately it's your choice. But I believe the Democratic Party is the right choice to help our country move forward. And with your votes, my brothers and sisters, we will continue the changes that have brought many of us hope and prosperity."\n\nNew polls keep coming in from government agencies, and we are starting to see a rise in popularity the likes of which we have never seen before. It is very likely that with the African American vote, we can turn the South around completely. Even in states like Alabama and South Carolina, where the Democratic votes were few and far between, we have started to gain tremendous ground thanks to the large African American populations in these states. However, it would be a lie to say that these states will totally support the Democrats in the next election; already, many conservative white Americans are expressing their clear disapproval, and they are quickly ditching our party in favor of the dreaded alternative. Our wonderful activists will do more than make up the losses our party suffered, and with their help, we have already gained so many more African Americans to our side. If we keep pushing for change, we will have the entire South in our grasp in no time."
 LBJ.138.a: "Awesome!"

 LBJ.139.t: "A Dream More Than Dreamt!"
 LBJ.139.desc: "We put so much effort into passing the reforms that led to President Johnson's "Great Society" and we are finally starting to reap the fruits of our labor. At the end of the day, our carefully-planned policies and our wonderful campaigns have given us a competitive voter base in even the most Conservative regions of the nation. We owe it all to the brave activists that preached our party to the masses of African Americans across the South. We owe it all to President Johnson's government who worked tirelessly to pass legislation that would benefit all Americans regardless of race.\n\nEven now, our work is far from over. Racism is still a widespread issue, and prejudice against Democrats continues as it has since the start of Reconstruction. More white voters have deserted the party during this campaign; in fact, we've lost almost every Dixiecrat member to the NPP. Even with the Democratic unity among African Americans, division between blacks and whites is even more apparent.\n\nRegardless, President Johnson's Great Society has improved American healthcare, education, civil rights, and many other important parts of daily life. There is no doubt that the Democratic Party will continue gaining lifetime supporters as a result of Lyndon Johnson's successes. Our activists, now working as full-fledged members of the Democratic Party, will continue promoting the party that has already helped so many Americans through Johnson's plan."
 LBJ.139.a: "The future is bright for the revitalized Democrats."

 LBJ.140.t: "Price of Expedience"
 LBJ.140.desc: "The good faith among African Americans engendered by President Johnson's attempt to pass substantial housing access reform has been poisoned by his surrender on the issue. Democrats blatant political reversal on the issue is a spit in the face to the constituency. The high minded rhetoric that preceded it just makes the betrayal sting all the more.\n\nCivil rights leaders are denouncing the President and his party in the strongest language, and editorials on the failure of the RDC to address civil rights are flying. Pundits of all stripes are predicting the black vote moving towards the NPP. Progressives in that party are taking full advantage of the beating the Democrats are taking, proposing more aggressive national policies to combat discrimination in housing, employment, and education."
 LBJ.140.a: "There goes that bloc."

 LBJ.141.t: "Not a Hero"
 LBJ.141.desc: "President Johnson's weak Fair Housing Act is making many Democratic African Americans question their allegiances. It's hard to see more than squandered opportunity in the bill that was passed. It's becoming clear to many that Democrats won't sacrifice moderate white votes by strongly pursuing civil rights. President Johnson's credibility as an ally, established by his support for voting rights, has taken a nosedive.\n\nThese developments will hurt the RDC in the South, where black support for their candidates was crucial in holding back Nationalist challengers. It will take stronger efforts on behalf of their rights to repair the relationship with black voters."
 LBJ.141.a: "We'll weather this, somehow."

 LBJ.143.t: "Photogenic"
 LBJ.143.desc: "2 PM in the congressional cafeteria. Barry and Lyndon sat together at a table, enjoying the meal of the day and just chatting about whatever came to their mind. It was marked as a political meeting in their calendars, the opportunity to push their agendas through backroom deals, but both of them knew that this wasn't the real reason for their biweekly meetings. Even the greatest politicians need to slack off with their fellow colleagues once in a while.\n\n"...and I completely agree with you on this point, Lyndon, the pizza served here is laughably bad. Anyways, can we reschedule our next meeting? I've booked a holiday trip in Arizona, so I'll be away for the week."\n\n"You're taking a vacation? Barry, that's the first time I've seen you take a vacation in years. Jeez, what happened? I always thought that you were too uptight to ever take your mind off work for a few days."\n\n"Oh, I'm doing a little photography tour through Phoenix. The city is just marvellous at this time of the year. Seeing Saint Mary's Basilica at night leaves an impression that will stick with you for years."\n\n"Sounds fantastic. I didn't know that you went back to photography, didn't you abandon the hobby a few years ago?"\n\n"Back then, I felt like I ran out of motives for my photos, y'know. Every major city was just suffocating under this impenetrably thick and grey blanket of smog. The Phoenix from my childhood memories, the bright and vibrant gem of the Sun Belt, simply didn't match up with what my pictures showed, so I quit under the belief that I was just not skilled enough to reveal the true beauty of the place. That's what I thought, anyways. However, the past few years have been nothing short of a miracle. The air is slowly clearing, the once barren ponds are gradually getting repopulated, and I believe that I even heard a songbird the other day, for the first time in a decade at least. These business bigwigs and northern NPP Nationalists might fight your environmental plan with everything they've got, but let me tell you - the results have been astonishing so far. A lot of your policies are nonsensical, but what you've done to the nature of our beautiful nation is something great that'll never be forgotten.""
 LBJ.143.a: "Have fun, Barry."

 LBJ.144.t: "A Great Society"
 LBJ.144.desc: "A great society manifests itself in the villages of Appalachia. Life is as calm and rural as it ever was, but the last vestiges of crushing poverty are slowly, but surely evaporating into nothingness. Dysentery, hookworms, goitres - all these symptoms of a life at the bottom - fade away, and nothing but the romanticized notion of a country lifestyle remains.\n\nA great society manifests itself in the halls of the Mercy hospital. Those without means are finally able to receive what they need the most, prophylaxis and treatments.\n\nA great society manifests itself in the streets of Harlem. Local residents, policemen, commuters and many more people rush through the streets of the borough eager to go about their day. The next generation dreams of the future, dreaming of a world where someone like them enters the Oval Office, an idea that was an absurdity a mere decade ago and now almost seems like an inevitably.\n\nA great society manifests itself in the schools of Chicago. Children of all ages and races play together, learn together, and grow together. Teachers, pens and book bags are taken for granted, and the times of need are almost entirely forgotten.\n\nA great society manifests itself in the wilderness of Alaska. Wild geese fly below the clear and starry sky. The vast landscape is near untouched, not a single piece of human refuse lies anywhere.\n\nA great society required a great investment. Taxes were expanded, businesses went insolvent, and a great deal of citizens opposed the project with everything they had, fearing the massive scope of Johnson's daring plan.\n\nBut when Lyndon Baines Johnson looks out the window of the Oval Office and sees what changed over the past few years, he is perfectly content with his achievements. Many doubted him when he announced his candidacy, claiming that he was a dreamer with unfeasible ideas who'd fall apart once confronted with reality These voices went silent, and only the history books remain."
 LBJ.144.a: "A Great Success."

 LBJ.145.t: "Egg"
 LBJ.145.desc: ""President Johnson, sir, what happened? Are you alright?"\n\nYolk dripped down the pants of the President. His formerly pristine suit was utterly ruined, as small pieces of eggshell were firmly lodged in the sticky malaise of egg-whites and cotton. Someone must have bombed the President, and despite the embarrassing circumstances, Johnson was lucky that it was an egg and not a grenade.\n\nThis silver lining did not improve Johnson's mood by any margin. He was as angry as a man could be, the angriest he has been in years, and all of his pent-up frustrations erupted in a profanity-laden rant vaguely directed at the closest person available - in this case, a random aide who happened to pass by.\n\n"I've been had. I've been fucking had. One of these rioting blacks somehow got past the Secret Service - what a heap of useless jackasses - and threw an egg at me. He threw an egg at me! Holy shit, this is just an absolute disaster. The entire country is an absolute mess right now, I tell you that. You can't even take a walk without bumping into some inner city dweller holding a cardboard sign! Being egged isn't even the worst part of it - all these riots are seriously hurting my own position and the party at large. Most people don't give a damn about politics, they just want a peaceful life, and this dumpster fire is pretty much the exact opposite to that.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I definitely do care about the whole civil rights thing. It's a good policy, these people just don't understand that we had to delay it a bit due to our own internal issues. We need to properly communicate our difficulties, and we should get the whole thing started as soon as possible so these violent protests finally disperse. Jesus, I can't believe the whole thing got out of hand like this.\n\nYou know what? Call up some civil rights leaders and ask for a meeting. Screw my schedule, just pick the closest date you can. This problem has gotten too big to ignore, and we need to fix it. As soon as possible.""
 LBJ.145.a: ""I'm on it, sir.""

 LBJ.146.t: "A Shattered Movement"
 LBJ.146.desc: ""...which is why you cannot let the Floridan black community go underserved any longer. A massive initiative of social programs ought to be started as soon as possible, and..."\n\n"...impact of Christianity. Black churches are lacking the funds to even just maintain their current places of worship, so a new program to..."\n\n"...in the history books. Honor their achievements, and do it publicly through meaures like public holidays to..."\n\nJohnson stoically kept his polite smile, but the utter duration of the civil rights meeting was slowly getting to him. Dozens of leaders from the black community were flown in from all over the country, and all of them had their own wishes, desires, concerns, and demands. Striking a deal with all of them would be a challenge, nearly impossible even considering the breadth and oftentimes contradictory nature of the goals of the leaders. Lyndon was set to try his best, but he was very much aware of his desperate position - it would take an immense amount of concessions to get most leaders on his side, concessions that are bound to tarnish his upcoming legacy. He had no option but to entertain even the most outrageous demands, and his guests were painfully aware of this fact.\n\nLongingly, Johnson thought of Martin Luther King. Negotiating with him would've been a breeze - he was one person with one ideology, and he still held more influence than all of his successors combined. If he were still present, all of this would have been so much easier, but fate just had to strike at the most unfortunate moment. Maybe he was too slow, maybe -\n\n"Mr. President, are you alright? I was just about to lay out my plan on the revitalization of midwestern inner cities, and I do think that it is of utmost importance considering the desolate situation faced by many of our discriminated against brothers and sisters. If I may?"\n\n"Wha- oh, yes, of course. Go right ahead. I was just thinking about how to approach the challenges we'll face in the following weeks, that is all.""
 LBJ.146.a: "Anything to calm down the riots."

In truth, I cannot stomach it; in the words of Thomas Jefferson, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, and that his justice cannot sleep forever.\n\nIt is for this that I cannot, will not, treat this moment in time with anything other than the gravity it deserves; my party would have me believe that this marks a new beginning when, if anything, it is the culmination of everything that has led my countrymen to this point.\n\nTo my fellow Americans, to the people of the world, and those who have wronged them. In the name of every life ruined by the enemy we face, I offer a clear and undeniable message: Not. One. More!\n\nTo my fellow Americans, I say to you: do not be afraid; I promise to you that our nation's security will be our highest priority, that the Third Reich and the Empire's efforts to build their New World Order will be in vain and it will be in vain that they will try, and fail, to preserve it; my promise is an end to uncertainty and that your children will live in a land of their own, safe under the providence of God, and never know fear again.\n\nGod bless you all, and God bless the United States of America."

# Kirkpatrick

 POLITICS_KIRK_DESC: "Many less liberal-minded politicians once presumed a woman to be too soft to hold the office of President-- too weakened by feminine tenderness. Now, the fools and doubters line up out of respect and fear to Jeane Duane Kirkpatrick: a woman with a heart of steel and a mind for politics. A lifelong believer in the importance of both unions and foreign intervention, Kirkpatrick was rocketed to the political spotlight as the Oil Crisis grew in intensity. With her mastery of geopolitics and unbreakable resolve, the Presidency was relatively easy to win. Now, as President, she advocates what is being called the "Kirkpatrick Doctrine": a geopolitical precept that America should support friendly dictatorships in order to prevent the spread of Nazi totalitarianism. While this concept has drawn ire from many, few doubt its effectiveness in achieving its goal.\n\nOriginally from Oklahoma, Kirkpatrick studied at Columbia University. After completing her PhD in 1968, Kirkpatrick became an extremely outspoken member of the AFL-CIO Democrats, with her focus on foreign policy acting as a major counterweight to her primarily domestically-focused colleagues.\n\nNow, the practical, calculating woman of iron sits in the Oval Office, slowly hammering a soft nation into a creature as unyielding as she is. If she has her way the Central Intelligence Agency budget will skyrocket, as will the number of pro-American third world dictatorships. The chaotic winds of the world, whether through words or through swords, shall be rent into an order that respects and fears the United States of America."

 # Ideas / Modifiers
 USA_Kirk_72_kirkpatrick_doctrine: "Kirkpatrick Doctrine"
 USA_Kirk_72_kirkpatrick_doctrine_desc: "The Kirkpatrick Doctrine calls for the promotion and support of "authoritarian" governments around the world to combat "totalitarian" governments. While the difference is often blurry, this for the most part consists of supporting left-wing dictatorships against right-wing ones, but there is room for more creative interpretations. As Realpolitik is taken to its logical extreme, the Kirkpatrick Doctrine promises to change the face of international politics. And the lines between authoritarian and totalitarian will continue to blur..."
 USA_Kirk_72_CIA_act: "CIA Act of 1973"
 USA_Kirk_72_CIA_act_desc: "The CIA Act of 1973 does a couple of things: first and foremost, it allows the Central Intelligence Agency to utilize their funding in any way they desire; no longer are they burdened by the normal restrictions government agencies have. In addition, it allows "persons of interest" to be fast-tracked to citizen status- something that will surely help encourage some new German and Japanese friends."

 USA_kirk_72_the_kirkpatrick_presidency_desc: "[USA.Kirk_to_MCS]"

 USA_a_historic_first_desc: "For the first time in American history, a woman sits behind the oaken timbers of the Oval Office's desk. Jeane Kirkpatrick has had her detractors, her critics, her doubters; she has shown them all to be wrong. They called her too weak for the job, or too harsh diplomatically. They said a woman could never be elected. They belittled everything she did, critiqued what she wore; they said a woman could never win the election. Yet, she did.\n\nIn the drawing rooms where Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and other great American had once dwelled, a woman now ponders how to best succeed their legacy; she thinks about what she has done, and what she still has yet to do. Yes, she has won the peoples' votes, but has she won their confidence? And internationally speaking - her theories, nicknamed the "Kirkpatrick Doctrine," are about to be put to the test; but she will make sure they prove successful."
 USA_righting_her_wrongs_desc: "Jeane Kirkpatrick is not the first female President in American History; that honor has, unfortunately, gone to Margaret Chase Smith. And while Kirkpatrick can acknowledge and admire the great strides that she has taken for women around the nation and the world, she was not reelected: and that was for a reason. Maybe it was for her weak foreign policy; maybe it was because domestic radicalization increased tenfold under her administration. For any number of reasons, the American people have made their decision; when the two women came head to head, Kirkpatrick emerged victorious. She will make sure to live up to, and exceed, the legacy her predecessor has left before her."

 USA_kirk_72_a_womans_true_place: "A Woman's True Place"
 USA_kirk_72_a_womans_true_place_desc: "For centuries, women have been told by men what to do, what to wear, what to say, what to cook; for centuries, women have been treated as less than men. And this still continues. Jeane Kirkpatrick has heard her fair share of "go back to the kitchen," in her life, both while in politics and before that. These men, these small, pathetic men, are afraid of strong women- and that is just what Kirkpatrick is. To combat the political gap between the sexes, the President has decided to embark on a campaign encouraging women to get engaged in politics. Flyers will be printed, speakers hired, classes given; whatever it takes to continue the fight against sexism. For a woman's place is not in the kitchen; it is in the office."

 USA_kirk_72_unions_then_and_now: "Unions- Then and Now"
 USA_kirk_72_unions_then_and_now_desc: "President Kirkpatrick's Vice President, Leonard Woodcock, is a union man, through and through. As one of the most important members of the United Auto Workers, he is devoted to the cause of the working class- a cause that he and Jeane Kirkpatrick will work valiantly to fight for. Woodcock will give a series of speeches, emphasizing the importance of unions, weaving a tapestry of their rich history; and how it can continue. Men and women across the United States must fight together and for each other; with Woodcock and Kirkpatrick as their knights."

 USA_kirk_72_uproot_the_enemy_here: "Uproot the Enemy Here"
 USA_kirk_72_uproot_the_enemy_here_desc: "A weed is growing in the United States; a disgusting, rotten weed. Its name? The Sovereigntist Caucus. Part of the disgusting chimera that is the NPP, the Sovereigns call for the preservation of "White" and "Christian" America. They are not patriots, no; they are the opposite. They would rather march beneath the swastika than beneath the stars and stripes. They are fascists, through and through; and must be dealt with accordingly. We will not ban them; we will not stoop to their level. Instead, we will put out a series of attack ads portraying them as the Nazi bootlickers they are. Despite Francis Parker Yockey losing the election, he still has influence; influence that must be dealt with."

 USA_kirk_72_to_change_human_nature: "To Change Human Nature"
 USA_kirk_72_to_change_human_nature_desc: "Unlike her grandfather, Jeane Kirkpatrick was never a socialist nor a communist. While she heavily supports labor unions, and has a great deal of respect for those that go by the "social democrat" label, communism and socialism are things she cannot abide; not in her America. While not as open about it as the Sovereigns, the Marxists of the NPP are their own unique kind of evil; one that masquerades as helping the working class. It's a snake that must be dealt with- and we will fight this viper the same way that we fight "Sovereigns"- an assault by advertisement."

 USA_kirk_72_CIA_act_of_1973: "The CIA Act of 1973"
 USA_kirk_72_CIA_act_of_1973_desc: "Through the conflict with both the Reich and Japan, the Central Intelligence Agency has proven itself invaluable. Protecting America both domestically and abroad, they are gears in a great machine. Yet these gears can be greased; to do their job better, to do it easier.\n\nJeane Kirkpatrick has proposed the CIA Act of 1973. If it passes, the bill will allow significantly increased funding for the CIA, along with exempting it from the usual restrictions that come with federal money. Simply said, the CIA will be able to do whatever it needs to. In addition, new protocols will be created for those individuals deemed important enough to skip the lengthy immigration process; perfect for defectors."

 USA_kirk_72_where_the_sun_shines_less: "Where the Sun Shines Less"
 USA_kirk_72_where_the_sun_shines_less_desc: "Many people see the United States Armed Forces as the frontline against fascism around the world; exactly as they should. Yet just behind the scenes lies the Central Intelligence Agency, doing the things that need to be done to protect freedom. Sometimes honorable, sometimes unsavory; the men and women of the CIA will do whatever it takes to promote liberty. Jeane Kirkpatrick has authorized the construction of dozens of "Black Sites" - CIA operation centers located around the world. From England to Turkey to Russia to China, these tiny black states will be the hearts from which the blood of America is pumped."

 USA_kirk_72_the_greatest_post_war_success: "The Greatest Post-War Success"
 USA_kirk_72_the_greatest_post_war_success_desc: "Of all the developments to emerge from the Second World War and its immediate aftermath, the Organization of Free Nations was by far the most important; a league of nations, united against the wings of the Reich's eagle and the rays of the Japanese sun. Bound not by the chains of conquest, but by the promise to fight for one another. From South Africa to Indonesia to the Middle East, the OFN has sent men and machines, bullets and blood; the soldiers of free nations around the world have fought for liberty. Sometimes victorious, sometimes not; the OFN has been hardened in the hottest fire, and it has emerged as the hardest steel. It has been forged into a blade of democracy; to defend it, to protect it, and to spread it. Jeane Kirkpatrick will put this blade to a grindstone. She will hone the blade to a fine point; and use it where she must. To this end, she will give an address, both to the nation and the OFN, stressing the importance of mutual cooperation and appealing to closer bonds between nations."

 USA_kirk_72_why_enlarge_the_OFN: "Why Enlarge the OFN?"
 USA_kirk_72_why_enlarge_the_OFN_desc: "The Organization of Free Nations is an alliance of nations willing to do whatever it takes to fight fascism. From Washington to Ontario to Canberra, the blue flag waves- emblazoned with a torch, the fires of liberty stand out for all to see. Yet it is not enough. As many nations pledge allegiance to the OFN, it is still not enough. It will take more than the existing members to defeat both the Hun and the Samurai- far more. For this reason, Jeane Kirkpatrick argues that we should seek to invite more members to the alliance. While it will be difficult to do, we must streamline the application process to make future expansion easier."

 USA_kirk_72_a_tool_for_america: "A Tool For America"
 USA_kirk_72_a_tool_for_america_desc: "The United States of America is the world's best hope to defeat fascism; and she must do so by any means necessary. If this means angering some of the other members of the Organization of Free Nations, so be it. It is a sacrifice Jeane Kirkpatrick is willing to make. As the architect of the OFN, it is America's right to lead her as she sees fit. Troop requirements will be ramped up, as will dues. No longer will OFN member nations be able to ride along America's coattails; they must now support her, or be left in the dust. The President has prepared a series of speeches reminding her fellow OFN leaders the importance of mutual cooperation- and she will stress that America is bearing the brunt of the cost."

 USA_kirk_72_leaders_lead_followers_follow: "Leaders Lead, Followers Follow"
 USA_kirk_72_leaders_lead_followers_follow_desc: "Following President Kirkpatrick's address to the other members of the OFN, she has announced certain changes to how the Organization of Free Nations is run, both domestically and abroad. First, dues have been increased significantly, requiring member states to pay much more if they would like to keep receiving America's protection. Secondly, troop commitments have been increased; the sound of Australian accents will be much more common. Third, and most controversial, a one way lend-lease; member nations will be required to provide a certain amount of either raw materials or equipment to America."

 USA_kirk_72_the_kirkpatrick_doctrine_realized: "The Kirkpatrick Doctrine Realized"
 USA_kirk_72_the_kirkpatrick_doctrine_realized_desc: "Jeane Kirkpatrick has invented what is commonly called the "Kirkpatrick Doctrine." This theory calls for the support of Authoritarian regimes to oppose Totalitarian ones; in essence, its goal is to defeat the German Reich and the Japanese Samurai by any means necessary. A communist dictatorship may be a dictatorship, but they oppose the Reich- and for now, that is all it takes. Guns and aid will be sent all over the world to any groups that oppose our enemies: be they Islamist, socialist, criminal, or other. Whatever it takes, fascism must be defeated: even if it takes giving up some dignity."

 USA_kirk_72_the_fires_of_liberty_ready_to_spread: "The Fires of Liberty, Ready to Spread"
 USA_kirk_72_the_fires_of_liberty_ready_to_spread_desc: "The fires of liberty have never gone out. They may have been dimmed, dampened, or diminished- but no more. Jeane Kirkpatrick has added fuel to these fires, ensuring their roaring blaze is stronger than ever. Yet it is not an uncontrolled rage; it is confined, it is careful. The fires of freedom will spread, but they will not consume. Unlike the fires of the Reich, they will not ruin or kill; the fires of freedom will enlighten. Like Lady Liberty's Torch, Kirkpatrick and America will be the bearers of this flame, using it to set the world on fire- and from that fire, a stronger, better world will emerge.\n\n"As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!""

 # Events
 kirk.1.t: "Jeane Kirkpatrick at Georgetown"
 kirk.1.desc: "Georgetown was an incredible school: Ted loved everything about it. The location was phenomenal. At any given moment, he could walk around the neighborhood, pristine and beautiful as it was. He loved the rivalry between Georgetown and the other two big (and inferior) DC schools.\n\nHe loved the classes. As an International Relations major, Ted was given access to all sorts of interesting ones, taught by interesting and unique people. As with many Georgetown students, however, his favorite part was the interesting guest speakers and lecturers. They all differed significantly from his professors, and from each other. There were often repeat guest lecturers- being academics, they rarely could get through everything they wanted to say, and as a result, Ted got used to seeing a couple of these speakers around campus quite a bit. His favorite of all the speakers was Jeane Kirkpatrick, who often came to speak in his "Analysis of US Foreign Policy" class. It wasn't how she spoke- that was something she certainly needed to work on, Ted would often think- but instead what she said. She differed from her peers- other experts in the field- significantly. While the field of foreign relations is wide and no two people have quite the same beliefs, she was even more unique- something that drew Ted to her. She called for increased aid to governments that were "aligned with the Organization of Free Nations" as long as they had "democratic institutions"- whatever that meant.\n\nTed always asked her the most questions- much to his classmates' chagrin, he assumed. But he couldn't help himself. The things she said, the questions she asked, made him think. For a while, Ted had been dissatisfied with the US's current foreign policy: and she offered him an alternative. He thought of what she said while lying awake in bed, while drinking tea, and in other classes. He simply found everything she said fascinating."

 kirk.2.t: "Dictatorships and Double Standards"
 kirk.2.desc: "When someone opens an issue of Commentary magazine, they expect to see many things: articles on what's happening abroad in Germany, articles about Jewish culture and religion, but most of all, articles about the political issues of the day. If someone were to pick up the 1965 November issue, they would see Georgetown's lauded political scientist Jeane J. Kirkpatrick gracing its cover. Just under the title, they'd see "Dictatorships and Double Standards" in a bright red font.\n\nIn the essay, Kirkpatrick compliments the foreign policy that the President's administration has enacted, while simultaneously calling for more "aid to be given to Organization of Free Nations aligned states" and "authoritarian states with democratic institutions." It's by no means a short essay- the readers of Commentary magazine with less interest in foreign policy would no doubt skim it or skip past it entirely- but those that were interested in the field took note. Kirkpatrick introduces the concept of what is being called the "Kirkpatrick Doctrine." While she doesn't go into depth, the rough idea of the Kirkpatrick Doctrine is that "totalitarian" governments are more likely to survive for longer, while "authoritarian" governments are more likely to reform or collapse. Kirkpatrick doesn't explain the specific policy applications of the doctrine (as it's an essay, not a policy proposal), it is not difficult to see what she thinks is the right course of action- more aid to these "authoritarian countries."\n\nAll over the country, more and more people are taking note of this rising political scientist. Already, there are rumors of a Congressional or Senatorial bid, (even if Kirkpatrick denies such rumors). However, she continues to make waves, showing up at speaking events, and publishing more and more papers and essays complimenting and advising the current administration. It was to nobody's surprise, of course, when she was announced as the newest member of the National Security Council: a position she accepted with pride."

Just under the title, they'd see "Dictatorships and Double Standards" in a bright red font.\n\nIn the essay, Kirkpatrick offers a brutal critique of the unstable foreign policy that the President's administration has enacted. She likens it to a pendulum: rapidly going between two significant extremes. She argues that the President has "left our allies in the Organization of Free Nations out to dry," and that "authoritarian governments with democratic institutions" are not being given enough support or aid. It's by no means a short essay- the readers of Commentary magazine with less interest in foreign policy would no doubt skim it or skip past it entirely- but those that were interested in the field took note.

Kirkpatrick doesn't explain the specific policy applications of the doctrine (as it's an essay, not a policy proposal), it is not difficult to see what she thinks is the right course of action- more aid to these "authoritarian" countries.\n\nAll over the country, more and more people are taking note of this rising political scientist, with her scathing cuts against the President's foreign failures. Already, there are rumors of a Congressional or Senatorial bid, (even if Kirkpatrick denies such rumors). However, she continues to make waves, showing up at speaking events, and publishing more and more papers and essays critiquing the current administration. Her essays (and speeches) have been featured at congressional hearings against the President and his administration- calling for much needed changes to foreign policy."

While she was very much a woman focused on foreign policy, she wasn't unknown to the world of domestic politics. With her firm belief in the importance of unions and support for civil rights, she fell right in line with the Democrats' platform- which made sense; she had been registered as one for as long as she could remember. Of course, knowing what party she was a part of didn't help her accomplish her goals- if she even knew what her goals were.\n\nIt was a Thursday that the answer to that particular question revealed itself. She didn't recognize the name of the caller, nor the DC-Based area code, but she was glad that she had picked up. Howard W Smith, of Virginia's Tenth Congressional District, was retiring- and the Democratic National Convention was looking for a new candidate. Jeane Kirkpatrick was the perfect answer to this question. Currently living in Alexandria (right across the Potomac from Washington D.C.), she was already well known in the political world as a staunch interventionist abroad, and someone who values the importance of unions and progressive policies domestically. Choosing her was a no-brainer for the Democratic National Convention higher ups- she was perfectly in line with their goals and beliefs.\n\nWithout a moment of hesitation, Kirkpatrick accepted- a million thoughts were already racing through her mind. She was already compiling a list of things she had to do- from making signs to making calls, she envisioned a very busy next couple of days."

Kirkpatrick won easily- an overwhelming majority of voters chose her. Situated right outside Washington D.C, Virginia's Tenth Congressional District benefited from the progressiveness of the capital, in addition to having countless people who work on the Hill living within it. Countless staffers, for both the incumbent President's party and those opposed, chose Jeane Kirkpatrick at the ballot box- she provided a better future for both Virginia and the country.\n\nThere were two things that really swayed the vote, however, and made Kirkpatrick's victory assured. Or rather, two buildings- the Pentagon -the headquarters of the military, and Langley- the headquarters of the CIA. Members of both groups voted overwhelmingly for Kirkpatrick, seeing her values in line with their own- her staunch hawkedness and commitment to fighting fascism was something to be admired, from the newest, greenest CIA agent to the highest general.\n\nJeane Kirkpatrick- or rather, Congresswoman Kirkpatrick, was elated- but not surprised.

She'd predicted something quite similar in her 1968 book "Dictatorships and Double Standards."\n\nOf course, she hadn't gotten the exact details correct- she had predicted the hegemonic ideology would be right-wing (along National Socialist lines) in nature rather than left-wing; but besides that, she had been bang-on with most things. She had predicted the rise of a totalitarian (or perhaps authoritarian, depending on the rest of the world) government, and she had been proven right. She'd predicted that the global oil market would implode, and she had been proven right. Most of all, she had predicted intervention from the Reich, Japan, and the United States- something that had certainly happened.\n\nReaders were taking notice of both the book and its author. At every major bookstore, at every library, Congresswoman Kirkpatrick's book was in high demand. It offered a unique proposal on what to do in the Middle East, as well as the rest of the world- it was Realpolitik taken to its maximum extension. Every day, Congresswoman Kirkpatrick received calls and letters from people asking her to clarify bits and pieces of the "Kirkpatrick Doctrine" - questions she would happily answer.\n\nCongresswoman Kirkpatrick was doing what she always wanted to- she was helping to change minds and hearts. People who were previously opposed to interventionism now found themselves singing Kirkpatrick's tune- and those who had already been in favor, even more so.\n\nEvery foreign policy institute, every International Relations class would sing her praises- at least, the ones that mattered. Georgetown, American University, Tufts, Stanford, Yale- all reached out to her for speeches and interviews- requests she happily obliged."

Her name was being chanted, she could tell; as were words such as "freedom," "democracy," and "America."\n\nCongresswoman Kirkpatrick finally reached the top of the podium and began to address the people before her. She had given this speech a hundred times before; she could do it in her sleep by now. Promises about ensuring, protecting, and expanding democracy flowed from her lips like water, and the crowd responded as they always did- a near deafening cheer. She swore that the United States could be doing more in the fight against fascism- and she preached that the best way to do that was through the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nGeorgetown listened. And, through the miracle of the camera, Washington D.C. listened- as did Canberra and Ottawa and more cities than she could count. Cities all over the world- those in nations that flew the Organization of Free Nation's blue flag proudly next to their own- listened to Congresswoman Kirkpatrick.\n\nThere was something different about this speech, however; both Kirkpatrick and everyone listening could tell. It was difficult to pinpoint exactly- a sense of urgency, perhaps? A newfound purpose? There was a new edge to Kirkpatrick's words- like a fine blade, they had been hardened, sharpened; and by the end of her speech, it became quite clear where this edge had come from.\n\nCongresswoman Kirkpatrick took a breath.\n\n"It is to this end that I have decided to run for President in 1972; for the defense and development of democracy both here and abroad.""

It wasn't one of her cartoons; no, the screen was not displaying colorful characters or singing animals, as was usual for the girl's household.\n\nAnd yet, the girl was even more focused than when she watched her shows. Her eyes staring at the screen, her mouth open in silent, rapt amazement, she watched the figure on screen. A beautiful woman, in a clean-cut suit, was on a podium speaking to a crowd.\n\nThe girl's mind couldn't truly comprehend the size of the crowd; the waves and waves of blurry faces could be in the billions, for as far as she was concerned. She saw the faces looking at the woman with the same sense of amazement that she herself felt, but with other emotions too; pride, rage, disappointment, fear, hope: this was the quilt of faces the girl looked out into.\n\nThe girl's mind could not comprehend what she was saying- words like "Organization of Free Nations," "Mutual Defense Clause," "Regime Change," and "Authoritarian vs Totalitarian" continued to show up again and again. These words have no meaning to the girl: she had of course heard some of them before, but their meaning was lost on her.\n\nThe girl's mind did not understand the meaning of the blue flag of a hand clutching a torch that was waving behind the woman. It was a nice shade of blue; she wondered who the hand belonged to. Maybe it was the new flag of the USA? She had paid attention enough in school (and said the Pledge everyday) that she knew it wasn't the current one.\n\nThere was one thing the girl could understand, however; the power that this woman held.

At least, he didn't think so; when he joined the Wehrmacht it was because he had no other option: he, like so many other young men, had no other path in front of him. So he heeded the call of the Fatherland- but only for a job.\n\nApparently the CIA didn't see it that way. Again and again they'd ask him questions- questions he had no answer to, questions he would refuse to answer, and questions that had no answers at all.\n\nHe barely remembered being captured. It was in Iran, definitely; but everything after that was blurry. He had no idea where he was- the men and women around him all spoke English (although their German was also remarkably good), but that didn't necessarily mean anything. After all, everyone knows the CIA has sites all over the world for detaining people like him.\n\n"People like him." He had no idea what that meant. Nazis? Germans? Enemies of the United States? He couldn't tell. He was German, sure, but he wasn't a Nazi."
 kirk.21.a: "It matters not."

 kirk.22.t: "Protests Here, Protests Abroad"
 kirk.22.desc: "Following President Kirkpatrick's increase in troop and monetary dues from the member states of the Organization of Free Nations, official protest letters have been coming in from those very nations. Australia and Canada have called the move "counter to the very idea of the Organization," while the ambassador from New Zealand has officially requested that the President abandon this course of action. While no nations have yet refused to send troops, it is clear they aren't happy. Whether it's the personal request from the Prime Minister of Canada telling her it's a mistake, or various generals (both in the OFN allied nations and the US Army) voicing their complaints, it is clear that this is not a popular move diplomatically.\n\nAccording to some reports, the government of (most recent country to join OFN) has considered formally leaving the OFN- although nothing concrete has yet emerged.\n\nWorse still, it isn't just our allies that dislike this decision: all over the United States, protests in support of diplomatically reinforcing the OFN are popping up. Waving blue flags and chants of "Help our men, support the OFN" can be seen from Washington D.C. to San Francisco, and everywhere in between. Thousands of petitions have been signed, requesting President Kirkpatrick reverse this series of decisions- whether they will amount to anything is doubtful. Politicians from around the aisle have been conflicted- the NPP-Progressive Caucus's Firebrand Henry "Scoop" Jackson has called the shift in policy "a huge mistake" while the NPP Nationalist Caucus's notorious demagogue Phyllis Schlafly has called it "a step in the right direction."\n\nEven some of Kirkpatrick's own have denounced the move; Robert McNamara, in a rare moment of insight into his mind, has called it "completely illogical." Where President Kirkpatrick will go from here remains to be seen."
 kirk.22.a: "The murmurs grow louder."

 kirk.23.t: "The Greatest Post-War Success"
 kirk.23.desc: "Arnold was getting more and more used to Australia. It was a beautiful country, one that constantly surprised him, impressed him. It was no America, of course; but it was still a strong arm of the free world. He had only been living on the base for six months, but he could already feel himself starting to pick up some Aussie slang- much to his wife's amusement.\n\nAs part of an Organization of Free Nations detachment, his job was constantly changing- this time, he was stationed in a small military base in New South Wales- a beautiful part of the country. There was no combat in this specific role, obviously, but that didn't mean he wasn't ready for it. He had served in South Africa; he had served in Indonesia. He had worn the OFN Blue on both occasions; he had fought alongside Aussies, Canadians, Brits, and Kiwis- he knew how hard they fought, how committed they were to the cause of liberty- he was proud to call them brothers and fight by their sides.\n\nAs much as he loved where he was, it didn't mean he missed his home any less. That little Manhattan apartment, the shul around the corner. He missed it so much. He even missed the politics of it all. Kind of. He always did his duty- he voted for the candidate that would support the Organization of Free Nations the most. In 1972, that had been Jeane Kirkpatrick- and he had already seen returns to the OFN- funding had increased, as well as improved international cooperation.\n\nArnold wasn't a man who regretted much- he never once regretted joining the military, nor enlisting in the OFN detachment. He didn't regret voting for Jeane Kirkpatrick either- even as the protests back home grew louder. He was proud of his country, and proud of himself- he wore the OFN Blue with pride."
 kirk.23.a: "For freedom everywhere."

 kirk.24.t: "Lady Liberty's Torch"
 kirk.24.desc: "Inside every American, there is a fire. Some days, that fire burns bright- it shines through the darkness, promising to light up the world with the flame of freedom and liberty. Other days, it is dim- the last embers of a dying flame, glowing faintly, yet soldiering on.\n\nMaybe President Jeane Kirkpatrick found this flame a roaring bonfire; or maybe, due to past administrations' failures, she found it more as embers that she had to nurture back to life. It does not matter how she found it; it matters not whether she inherited it as a couple sparks or a raging inferno. She has turned it into a blazing pyre- a beacon for the oppressed around the world.\n\nLady Liberty holds her torch high; the fire shining to every corner of the map. From Germania to Tokyo, from Washington D.C. to Canberra, from Rome to Jerusalem, the world is illuminated. Like a moth to a flame, men and women are drawn to freedom.\n\nThe men and women of the Organization of Free Nations see the flame; they heed its light, and they go to it. Everyday, more people join the armies of freedom. Be it by joining the United States Army, the New Zealand Defense Force, the Central Intelligence Agency, or countless other organizations- they listen to its clarion call.\n\nWhile the roar of the flame grows louder, so too does the roar of the crowd. Some, of course, are in support: crowds with blue OFN banners are a frequent sight outside of the White House, showing support for Jeane Kirkpatrick. But they too, have those they face off against. The endless crowds of pacifists and cowards will also show up outside the White House. They think that the United States of America should not fight the Nazis or the Samurai- instead that they should bend overbackward to the fascists.\n\nJeane Kirkpatrick will not listen to them."
 kirk.24.a: "The torch of liberty will burn until every man breathes free."

 kirk.25.t: "The Case for Supporting the Free State of Magadan"
 kirk.25.desc: "In a new, controversial op-ed for Commentary magazine, Georgetown professor and political analyst Jeane Kirkpatrick argues in favor of "United States aid to the Free State of Magadan and Mikhail Matkovsky."\n\n"While the Free State of Magadan may at first appear to be an authoritarian nation, it provides the best option in the ashen ruins of what once was Russia and the Soviet Union. Contrary to the National-Socialistesque All-Russian Government of Amur, and the totalitarian communist Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Free State of Magadan has powerful democratic institutions and the possibility of reform," the article reads.\n\nKirkpatrick describes Vozhd Mikhail Matkovsky as a "traditional-style ruler of semi-traditional society," alluding to the leaders alleged- and previously self-proclaimed- fascism. However, the existence of heavily reformist elements (mainly men such as Nikolay Peltin) in Matkovky's government led Kirkpatrick to proclaim "that the possibility of democratic reform is not simply likely, but assured." Already, the Vozhd has promised to put into law an updated bill of rights, promising basic civil liberties to the people of Magadan- although how far this will go still remains to be seen.\n\nMagadan is positioned in an incredibly important part of Siberia, Kirkpatrick argues; its access to the North Pacific makes it a profitable center of trade, and its proximity to China, Manchuria, and Japan allow the nation- and potentially the United States- to keep an eye on them. Should the Free State of Magadan establish control over the rest of Eastern Siberia- or the rest of Russia- the diplomatic, tactical, and military benefit this would give the United States is difficult to overstate; should we provide them the aid they so desperately want.\n\nThis op-ed is not without its critics; many are referring to it as a "naked call to support fascists" or "once again putting policy over people." Commentary magazine has received its fair share of angry letters- proving that Jeane Kirkpatrick remains one of their most controversial contributors."
 kirk.25.a: ""An interesting article, but nothing else.""

 kirk.26.t: "The South African War - A Matter of Moral Necessity"
 kirk.26.desc: "With the outbreak of the South African War, every foreign-policy based magazine worth its salt had something to say. The same, of course, applied to Commentary magazine. Another Op-ed from the controversial- yet popular- Georgetown political analyst Jeane Kirkpatrick.\n\nThis article, titled "The South African War - A Matter of Moral Necessity," argues the merit of going fully into the conflict currently enveloping the southern part of the continent. Kirkpatrick argues that the conflict provides an opportunity to show the world that America has not yet abandoned her allies, and that in a very real, visceral way, America is back. With the chaos in Germania and the Reich proper, Kirkpatrick claims, the United States has no better time than now to prove to both its people and people around the world that fascism will be defeated, wherever it is; be it Europe, Asia, or Africa.\n\nCalling the article a call to war would be an understatement; it is, instead, a foghorn; calling the entirety of the country, the OFN, and the free world in general, to do what needs to be done- which, as Kirkpatrick puts it, is to "support democracy and liberty in Africa by any means necessary."\n\n"The pattern is familiar enough: an established government with a record of friendship with the U.S. is attacked by insurgents, some of whose leaders have long ties to the National Socialist movement, and most of whose arms are of German or Japanese origin."\n\nAs always with Jeane Kirkpatrick's articles, the result is incredibly mixed. While the core readers of Commentary may tend towards the hawkish side, there are plenty that see this as a call for the United States to put its nose where it doesn't belong; and use American soldiers to do so.\n\nWith American intervention in the young conflict looking more and more likely, more and more eyes -at least, readers of Commentary- turn to Kirkpatrick for her ultra-pragmatist point of view when it comes to International Affairs."
 kirk.26.a: ""An interesting article, I guess.""

 kirk.27.t: "Aid to De Gaulle - Vrai-Politique"
 kirk.27.desc: "Readers of Commentary magazine have grown to recognize the name Jeane Kirkpatrick, knowing that the article to follow would no doubt be interesting, if not enlightening. The Georgetown political analyst's newest article, "Aid to De Gaulle - Vrai-Politique," is no different.\n\nWhile the Free French may not be fighting fascists, they are still fighting totalitarians, Kirkpatrick argues.\n\n"These Pan-Africanists seek to control the thoughts of their subjects, using not only propaganda, but brainwashing and re-education," the article claims. "Charles de Gaulle, and the Free French, provide a crucial bastion of American influence in the region- a bastion that Cameroon and the rest of the Pan-Africanist forces threaten."\n\n"While Charles de Gaulle and the United States have had their disagreements in the past, it is our responsibility to provide aid to our ally by any means necessary- the Gulf of Guinea represents a strategically important area that the USA would sorely regret losing."\n\nIn addition to the moral justification, Kirkpatrick cites the alleged Japanese support of Cameroon and the rest of the Pan-Africanist nations, claiming that "allowing the Free French to be defeated would be handing a victory directly to the Japanese Empire."\n\nMany readers remain unconvinced, however; American soldiers would not be fighting the Nazis, nor would they be fighting the Japanese; they would instead, be fighting a man half the world away who simply seeks his own liberation."
 kirk.27.a: "Vrai-politique? Is that French?"

 kirk.28.t: "Jeane Kirkpatrick Congratulates Italy on First Elections"
 kirk.28.desc: "In a recent Commentary article, Georgetown political analyst has congratulated the Italian Empire on "holding successful elections." Following sweeping democratic reforms, the formerly fascist nation held its first elections in decades. While the result still remains to be seen, Kirkpatrick claims the democratization attempts by former Duce Galeazzo Ciano to have been successful.\n\nKirkpatrick, who had always advocated for more diplomatic relations between the United States and the Italian Empire, welcomes the nation back to the democratic world stage, saying that "America welcomes an old, and hopefully new, ally in the fight against fascism."\n\nWhile the newly democratic nation has not announced any formal attempts to align with or ally with the United States of America and the Organization of Free Nations, Kirkpatrick encourages the conversation to begin, claiming that Italy would provide a crucial bulwark against fascism and Nazism in the "soft underbelly of Europe."\n\nMany people, however, argue that Italy's democratization process still has a long way to go, citing the prevalence and popularity of neo-fascist and crypto-fascist parties immediately after the reforms were announced. Kirkpatrick calls the existence of such parties and movements "growing pains" and promises that the nation will soon move past them and remove any latent "totalitarian remnants.""
 kirk.28.a: ""Another actor approaches the stage.""

 kirk.29.t: "Indonesia Burns - Jeane Kirkpatrick"
 kirk.29.desc: "With Indonesia once again splintered, congresswoman and political analyst Jeane Kirkpatrick has written another op-ed for Commentary magazine. The article outlines the current situation in Indonesia- and what the United States should do about it. Part policy proposal and part situation report, previous readers of congresswoman Kirkpatrick should be well acquainted with what she proposes.\n\nMassive aid- be it guns, economic aid, or medical supplies- to the United States aligned factions in the area- specifically Lubis' clique. By ensuring that the new Indonesian leader is aligned to American interests, Kirkpatrick argues, is the best way to combat increasing Japanese influence around the world: "by fighting them there, we can fight them here."\n\nCongresswoman Kirkpatrick claims that any careful observer of the region would have been able to see something like this approaching- but the magnitude, the "complete and utter bonfire that is currently unfurling within Indonesia," is difficult to have predicted.\n\nThe congresswoman has also proposed direct military intervention into the region- "American troops, flying American planes, firing American bullets from American guns would be crucial in securing Indonesian allegiance in the future," the article argues. "Should the United States successfully do this, it could be a death blow to Japanese influences in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nAs usual, responses to the op-ed are incredibly mixed- with some applauding the congresswoman's keen eye, while some calling her an open warmonger."
 kirk.29.a: "The hammer hits the anvil."

 kirk.30.t: "Bienvenida a la OFN"
 kirk.30.desc: "In a new op-ed to Commentary Magazine, political analyst Jeane Kirkpatrick has welcomed the newly reunited nation of the Republic of Colombia to the Organization of Free Nations. While Colombia had been under a frozen civil war for the past decade, the Colombian Revolutionary Union has recently triumphed over the New Granadan government and the previous Colombian Republic.\n\nThe Colombian Revolutionary Union, a loose coalition of leftists and liberals, was supported heavily by the Organization of Free Nations; support that was crucial in the bloody conflict that had recently transpired. It was partially because of this significant aid that the Republic of Colombia now aligns fully with the United States- offering a much needed counterweight to increasing Japanese influence in Latin America.\n\nKirkpatrick's fluency in Spanish comes in handy- half of the article is written in it. It's a direct call to both the government of Colombia and the rest of Latin America to ensure that "totalitarian elements within your government do not jeopardize the beneficial relationship that our nations now enjoy."\n\nColombia occupies an incredibly strategically important area in the western hemisphere - at the very top of South America, Colombia enjoys access to both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans - access that will certainly come in handy, Kirkpatrick argues, in fighting German and Japanese influence the entire world over.\n\nAs usual, not everyone is thrilled about Colombia's acceptance into the alliance. One critique of Kirkpatrick's article calls it "neo-colonialism," and a "blatant display of imperialism." Kirkpatrick foresaw these arguments, responding to them within the article itself: "calling a nation freely choosing to join our alliance imperialism is an insult to those currently languishing under the yoke of the Germans and Japanese.""
 kirk.30.a: "The Free World grows larger!"

 kirk.31.t: "Burning Black Gold, Bloody Red Sands"
 kirk.31.desc: "With the Middle East erupting into countless civil wars, many an avid reader of Commentary Magazine would expect some of the usual opinion writers to weigh in- and Congresswoman Jeane Kirkpatrick has.\n\nIn her new opinion piece "Burning Black Gold, Bloody Red Sands," Congresswoman Kirkpatrick offers a brief conflict report on the entire situation- from Sudan and Egypt to Yemen and Iran. While not as in depth as an official CIA country report, and careful not to reveal any classified state-secrets that the congresswoman may have access to, Kirkpatrick's article provides a succinct and accurate summary of what is currently going on in the region.\n\nIn addition to that, the article also serves as a policy proposal; and avid readers of Kirkpatrick's work, or followers of her political career, would be able to predict what this proposal consists of:\n\nMassive military intervention. The Congresswoman stresses that it has never been more important than now to ensure that America and OFN-aligned sides win these conflicts. Kirkpatrick sees this as a crucial step to cementing (and in some cases, recementing) American influence in the region. In addition to that, Kirkpatrick cites the alleged Japanese and German interference in the area, calling on the nation to ensure that "the totalitarians do not scrape out a victory."\n\nCongresswoman Kirkpatrick's increasing influence is on full display here; while ordinarily read by a small part of the country, this specific article is being talked about by hawks around the country- and by doves around the world. Words like "warmonger," "imperialist," and "fascist" - words that, of course, are commonly used to describe Jeane Kirkpatrick."

 # Philip Hart
 # Leader Descs
 POLITICS_Philip_Hart_DESC: "The most important left-liberal of the 20th century is a man you've probably never heard of. For a good reason, too: he is beyond humble, refusing to take even the slightest inkling of credit for his policy, and he doesn't have the stomach for media tours. The lanky senator from Michigan hardly cuts a presidential figure, but looks can be deceiving; behind his calm, kind eyes is a dormant passion that, when called upon, roars to life and enables him to fulfill any promise, no matter the size. That is why Philip Hart has, in some form or another, involved himself with nearly every significant labor, infrastructure, consumer protection, conservation, and civil rights bill that has circulated in the Senate since his election. But, to Hart, going unnoticed is an acceptable cost for accomplishing good policy.\n\nFirst elected to the Senate in 1958, Philip Hart arrived on Capitol Hill unsure about his purpose in the legislature. However, as votes came and passed, Hart realized that he could not simply vote "along party line" as was expected of partisan legislators, pushing him to conduct policy according to his conscience. Hart's reputation for independent voting and a powerful work ethic solidified him as an indispensable asset for Democratic liberal projects, and his ability to forge friendships despite policy agreements ingratiated him with nearly every section of the Senate.\n\nUnlike Philip Hart's maneuvering in the Senate, the White House is an entirely different beast with the potential for incredible highs and crippling lows. The ideal America for Philip Hart is one with blooming cities enriched by investment, a healthy network of crisscrossing highways and railroads, and a thoughtful, community-oriented approach to law enforcement, but this requires deliberation. Careful, political, and sometimes unconscionable review, like nothing Philip Hart has done before, is how these decisions for the greater good will be made. Their necessity is predicated on the fact that such a chance may never come again, meaning success for the champion of forgotten America is doubly needed and potentially worth any sacrifice."
 POLITICS_Chep_Morrison_Pres_DESC: "President deLesseps Story "Chep" Morrison is not his predecessor. Polarizing and politically inclined to a degree President Hart could rarely match, few expect the prince of New Orleans to fill the shoes of the man he must replace.\n\nElected as a state representative in 1940, Chep Morrison earned distinction and ire as one of the most vocal opponents of the late Gov. Huey P. Long's formidable party machine. As Mayor of New Orleans, he oversaw a modernization of city services and brought investment that helped turn the Crescent City into a beacon of the New South, walking a careful tightrope between balancing the demands of the city's black community with the segregationist public. Before doing the impossible in 1956, defeating the Long machine in his quest for Governor and driving the once-dominant political dynasty into the arms of the Nationalist Party.\n\nDespite his suave charm and affable nature, the prince of New Orleans is widely viewed with suspicion from all sides of the political aisle. Southerners for his prominent place within the Hart administration, activists for his mixed record on civil rights, and the country at large as he steps in to replace a Commander in Chief laid low by the forces of nature."

 hart.3.t: "Death of a Scoundrel"
 hart.3.desc: "Chep Morrison could scarcely believe his ears when news of the Urban Affairs Act's passage had come across the wire. He'd been elated—hell—more than elated. He'd been ecstatic. What had seemed at first like impossible opposition to the reform effort had melted away in the halls of Congress. One by one, conservative stalwarts like Barry Goldwater and John B. Anderson had come forward to praise the President and reaffirm their commitment to the project of liberalism. He was reading the reports of mass celebrations in the Capitol when the door to the Oval Office clicked open and his wife, Zsa Zsa Gabor stepped into the room.\n\nHe gave her a radiant smile. "Oh, Zsa Zsa, I'm glad you're here. For the first time, things to be going right again. I was so worried after Philip passed but—."\n\n"You cheated, didn't you darling."\n\nThere was a long pause. Chep blinked. "I'm sorry, I—. What?"\n\n"Not you, deLesseps, you silly, silly man. The person out there. They used console commands like the awful brute they are." His wife gave an exaggerated frown. "And what fun is that, to break the narrative? I mean, really, do you think my dear, dim-witted husband benefits from having his character arc cut short?"\n\nThe President stared at his wife, his mouth hanging open. He couldn't tell if this was a prank, the build-up to an elaborate insult, or a sudden mental break. All he did know was that the First Lady of the United States had just removed a pistol from behind her back. There was a click as she pointed it at his head.\n\n"Jesus Christ, Zsa Zsa. What the fuck?"\n\n"Nobody cheats on Zsa Zsa Gabor, darling. Let this be a warning.""

 WORLD.796.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Zsa Zsa Dictatorship"
 WORLD.796.desc: "In a shocking development from the United States this morning, reports have emerged that First Lady of the United States Zsa Zsa Gabor murdered her husband President deLesseps Morrison and proclaimed herself President of the United States. The development follows months of feuding—centered on Gabor's accusations that her husband "used console commands."\n\nStanding in the Rose Garden with a diamond necklace and blood-soaked Taffeta Dress, the new President delivered a dark address in which she vowed to end "the feckless rule of men" and bring about "an eternal hot girl summer." It remains unclear what these promises entail, but much of the previous administration's cabinet—including Henry Kissinger—have already fled Washington out of fear for their lives. Elsewhere, rumors swirl that much of the United States's gold reserve has been sent directly to the White House for some unknown purpose.\n"

 hart.1.t: "Building Golden Bridges"
 hart.1.desc: "When first he awoke to the idle patter of raindrops and a muted, cloudy sky, Philip Hart could almost convince himself it was just another day. Perhaps he and Janey were back in Michigan for a holiday, or maybe today would be packed with Senate committee meetings. This fantasy endured for a few moments longer before the President-Elect finally came to terms with what today would entail. He might have sat there all day had Janey Hart not leaned over to deliver two taps on the shoulder. "Philip," she said, glaring with love, "If you overthink this, you'll make a mistake and never forgive yourself." She was right, he conceded.\n\nAs the day roared on, Philip Hart held onto his wife's words, sometimes taking her hand in tandem. He stood before the Supreme Court's Chief Justice and an audience that eclipsed his hometown and affirmed, confirmed, and promised to do his best before taking the stand and straightening his papers. Bearing that a speech must eventually be given, he cast his doubts aside and forced the words out.\n\n"When my expiry has come," he began, "and the collective efforts of my career are weighed against my memory, I wish to be judged as good or bad. Our nation has not always been so kind, and many choose to judge based on race or welfare. This is a learned, blind hatred, and it is what we must overcome in our pursuit of a better country." His passion built slowly, and he continued to lament the injustices endured by those living in the belly of urban poverty or on the ends of rural isolates. "You will be heard," he promised, "just as you, the whole of America, will be a part of our effort to build a nation where there is opportunity for all." The solution, Hart insists, is a government that cares to invest in the country and protect its most vulnerable. "If we aim to do good, our accomplishments will speak for themselves."\n\nPresident Hart faced his audience with disbelief at its scale and passion as applause electrified the air. His responsibilities as President had a face for the first time, and the office's pressures seemed more significant than ever. If failure meant disappointing them, then success would be his only option."
 hart.1.a: "With Affection, Respect, and Esteem."

 hart.tree.1.t: "Season's Greetings"
 hart.tree.1.desc: "Sitting alone in the Oval Office, decorated according to Janey's direction and adorned with artifacts of the great American past, Philip Hart heard something missing from his life since the inauguration: silence. President Hart has been sorely lacking in peace and quiet between meeting cabinet members, organizing staff, coordinating international relations, and generally adjusting to this new life. He enjoyed it briefly until a knock came seconds later, and his secretary peered in. "Mr. President," called the White House secretary, "Senator Johnson is here to see you."\n\nInstinctively, Hart shot up to his feet and approached the door, meeting Johnson at the room's divide and shaking his hand. "Good to see you Phi-er, Mr. President," started Johnson before pausing. The pair chuckled and reminisced about "the old days when I was your boss" before the senior senator from Texas assumed a more serious tone.\n\n"I'll be blunt," said Johnson before pausing again, tendering his next words with an uncharacteristic gingerness, "I think I'm done. With leadership and... well, soon, the Senate. Then it'll be Hubert's game." He chuckled as he said it, but a distinct sadness emanated from Johnson. President Hart had known change was coming since Johnson first courted him for the presidency last year, and the unstated gravity of Johnson's request was not lost on him. Beyond their years spent within the hierarchy, Philip Hart and Lyndon Johnson had developed a genuine liking for each other, and Hart was disappointed to see him go.\n\n"Thank you, Lyndon, for your service in the Senate and for your support to me," began Hart, smiling while withholding his welling emotions, "and... Hubert may not give others the same treatment as you do, but I think he'll do just fine." This elicited laughter from Johnson, who stood to leave but not before tendering one final request."

 hart.tree.2.t: "Reality Check"
 hart.tree.2.desc: "The latest theater in Philip Hart's charm offensive was onboard the Presidential yacht Sequoia, where a night of scenic, liquor-lubricated sailing along the Potomac was poised to win the hearts of congressional Republican liberals. Hart knew from his Senate days that Liberal, "Rockefeller," Republicans were the backbone of successful progressive legislation and figured that his amicable, even friendly, relationship with the likes of Hugh Scott and Jacob Javits would earn the new administration some favor. As the President introduced himself to the Georgetown socialites and upstate congressional types,\n\nPresident Hart introduced himself to the unspoken guest of honor, tapping the governor of New York to join him privately in the ship's foremost lounge. There, seated below the presidential seal and beside the vibrant image of Washington at night, Philip Hart and Nelson Rockefeller got to talking. "You've given me hope about honesty in government, Mr. President," mused Rockefeller, nursing a drink, "but I wouldn't count on the Coalition for votes." The teetotal President, enjoying a cream soda, returned, "If I can't count on my parties for support, then it feels like we have bigger trouble."\n\nRockefeller smirked, if slightly, before resting on a placid grimace. The hard part. "I represent several Republicans who say we do not entirely support your policy agenda. To be frank, Mr. President, if you want votes, you're not just a Democratic President. You're a Republican, too, and we've hedged our bets on your success. Until we know you're committed to that, I don't believe you will see much Republican support for the administration's policies."\n\nAs he parsed this exhortation, a nervous Philip Hart smile emerged on the President's face. Finally, he spoke up. "You're... absolutely correct about the coalition. I won't let any of you down." Stunted by this rapid episode of political theater, Hart stood up and shook the governor's hand before returning to the party. So much for goodwill, silently mused Hart, who, for the first time, felt aware of the isolation that plagues Presidents. So much for friendship."

 hart.tree.3.t: "Executive Action"
 hart.tree.3.desc: ""Well, I hadn't considered that Jane, but I see it mentioned in this brief you sent me, and, uh..." President Philip Hart thumbed through the paper stack briefing, mindful of the single paperclip keeping the immense document together. The Vice President watched from across the Resolute Desk as the President struggled against the file, painfully aware that Secretary Jacobs's phone call was cutting into his allotted meeting time. Hart continued, "Yes, I will give some thought to his wealth question and get back to you. Or you could stop by the White House, fine. Okay." With that, the President finally placed down his phone and turned toward his guest with a smile. "Hello, Chep!"\n\n"Hello, Mister President," returned the Vice President, who offered a meek smile of his own, "I see the Secretary has gotten her materials to you first..." He gestured towards the thick document bearing Health, Education, and Welfare letterhead on its title page, which the President readily handed over. Then, as Morrison skimmed the printed pages, Hart continued, saying, "Yes, but I am equally interested in hearing your perspective, partially because I expect less reading." The two chuckled, and the Vice President pushed the packet aside.\n\n"My first reaction is how dire these statistics are and how conveniently effective these... frankly, expensive, improvements will be to stop the problem of urban capital flight." If he had learned anything as Mayor of New Orleans, the Vice President stated, it was that there is power in a well-funded feasibility study. "Conservatives will eat us alive with this data. Trust me on this, Mister President, good numbers get good results. That's a promise."\n\nThus, a dilemma was presented to President Hart: follow the advice of Secretary Jacobs and proceed with the HEW proposal, or heed the warning of the Vice President and settle any disputes with a study. Both options held merit. Proceeding as planned would result in a trimmed spending package, but the quick offensive could yield better policy. Following Morrison's advice would guarantee more broad support for the legislation and increase goodwill among Senate holdouts, at the cost of less effective legislation."

 hart.tree.4.t: "Lost in the Road Map"
 hart.tree.4.desc: ""This will go on the final dossier that goes out to the department staff and the press, so I would like to reiterate this as our official policy. Does uh, everybody follow?" Philip Hart, still not quite fit with the Presidency, pushed his head up to gauge the reactions of his cabinet. Vice President Morrison, seated to the President's right, nodded in affirmation, as did Secretaries McCarthy, Mitchell, and Scranton, leaving Secretary Jane Jacobs, directly to the President's left, as the sole dissenter. "Something wrong, Jane?" asked Hart.\n\n"It's just..." Jane Jacobs pushed up her horn-rimmed glasses and scanned the loose papers in her hands, "this isn't quite what we agreed to in our meetings, Mister President." The Vice President groaned, which was met by a Presidential glare from Hart, before allowing Secretary Jacobs to continue. "Our platform on transportation is admirable, as are our positions on civil rights and education, but our attitude towards the cities is unclear." "We can afford to be vague," snarked Morrison in retort, "and promises are dangerous at this stage." 'Mayor Morr' spoke matter-of-factly, eliciting a frown from Jane Jacobs.\n\n"Respectfully, Mister Vice President," stated Secretary Jacobs, coming to her feet, "I disagree." Cities were the center of the administration's policy, explained the HEW Secretary, and the implementation of all other parts of the agenda relied on success in the cities. "If the cities aren't in working order, they won't be effective bases for our infrastructure investments. Cities sit on the front lines in the fight for civil rights, and our education reforms will be damned if our urban schools are in disrepair. We cannot afford to go halfway."\n\nJust as quickly as she had risen, the firebrand Jacobs returned to her seat, content that she had made her point. Indeed, one by one, cabinet members nodded in affirmation, leaving the President to consider his agenda with new anatomy."
 hart.tree.4.a: "New life for the American city?"

 hart.tree.5.t: "The Old Man"
 hart.tree.5.desc: ""Dear President Hart,"\n\n"I followed with great interest the campaign of you and Mr. Morrison, of whom you know I am already acquainted. After the difficulties of the past four years and your diligent work in the US Senate to resolve them, I was heartened this past November to see the success of your presidential venture and the triumph of common-sense governance once again."\n\n"As you are well aware, there is no single cause to the problems our nation faces. With military entanglements, competition from abroad, and unrest in our cities, we will need experienced leaders to develop solutions that can take our country forward. I have no doubt that you are capable of that responsibility."\n\n"I am sure you will see many successes over these next few years. Yours, Dwight D. Eisenhower."\n\n***\n\nPhilip Hart put down the letter, increasingly wrinkled from his habit of reading and re-reading it. It had arrived by post—what?—a few weeks before the Old General's passing? One of the last things that President Eisenhower had done had been to write to him, to remind him of his obligations. The letter seemed to Hart a link to the past, a torch passed from one generation to the next. He wasn't even in politics when Ike was sworn in and the President launched his grand vision of an interstate highway system and now...\n\nNow it was Hart's highway system. With Eisenhower, Kefauver, and Kennedy dead, it was up to him to bear the mantle of liberalism. He had to be the kind of leader that could make those men proud, who could finish what they started."
 hart.tree.5.a: "Would Ike be proud of the administration we're leading?"

 hart.tree.6.t: "Buddy-Budd"
 hart.tree.6.desc: "Whether the average American realizes it or not, they have likely encountered a product of the Budd Company. If they've ridden busy city subways, watched interstate sleeper cars roll past, or seen a rusted hulk on rails yearning for better days, that rolling stock was likely produced at the Budd plant in Philadelphia. Budd's silent ubiquity in American passenger rail made it the natural choice of the Hart administration for creating the nation's first high-speed train.\n\nAs early as 1966, Budd engineers devised plans for a bullet train capable of reaching speeds exceeding the Japanese Shinkansen. A shortage of funding had kept their stubby, cigar-like "Metroliner" design confined to the drafting board until Hart administration contract offerings quickly dispelled worries about finances. Secretary of Commerce Mike Monroney had made closing the "train gap" his personal goal and showed his devotion to their operating budget. Before long, the Budd plant was tooled and staffed for an expected surge in Metroliner orders, but an unexpected act of internal dissent brought the buildup to a halt.\n\nIn a letter sent to Secretary Monroney, 10 Budd engineers described their misgivings with the current Metroliner design, citing the design's age and the applicability of more modern designs. In short, the Metroliner could be better if only given the time. Prototype Metroliners operating with Pennsylvania Railroad stock fell 50 miles-per-hour short of the intended 150, which the engineers promised they would rectify after a thorough but timely rework of the entire design. Such a chassis, already dubbed the "Superliner" by its proponents, would meet and possibly exceed federal performance criteria. Adopting the Superliner would throw the Budd plant into chaos and require a similarly thorough rework of the preexisting assembly lines, but with the potential to produce a truly spectacular train.\n\nSeated in his department office, the Commerce Secretary mulled his options. Proceed as planned with a working train, or heed the engineers and pivot towards a new design. Risk being made obsolete, or revise an entire program on the misgivings of engineers."

 hart.tree.7.t: "For Want of Budget"
 hart.tree.7.desc: "American prosperity knows no bounds except the margins of a particularly unfriendly budget. "Is that the message we want to send, that we compromise good infrastructure over a few million dollars?" Jane Jacobs was pacing in front of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, where she and President Hart conducted their daily meeting, and her audience could feel the passion. The cost projection was much higher than mere "millions," but the President thought better of a correction. "We're a superpower," fumed Jacobs, "but we can't have both roads and railways. We can afford South Africa, but viaducts go too far?" So she tossed her papers down with a whistling 'tsk' and seated herself on a nearby couch. "Are they trying to make me mad?"\n\n"Well," the President said, straightening himself to soothe an activist's passion, "I might make you mad too. I'm not going to fight the cuts." Secretary Jacobs chuckled and sighed, looking downcast as Hart continued. "The department will still work; it's just a question of reductions, which we're navigating carefully. On transportation, our options are cutting highways, rural roads, or passenger rail." The President moved to begin again but was cut off. "I believe Am-" Jacobs said, "Do not cut Amtrack, especially for what they mean to the URI." Hart mere nodded. He agreed Amtrack and the highways were essential to the URI, but "budget-crafting requires pragmatism, especially on issues like this. Everybody deserves help but..." Jane Jacobs frowned but offered no further resistance. "I've avoided that type of politicking until now," lamented Hart before settling into decision-making."

 hart.tree.8.desc: "The vast expanse of the Rocky Mountains sprawled endlessly beneath the path of Air Force One. The sight of snow-capped peaks and gray slopes a welcome reprieve to a cabin stuffy with cigar smoke and the faint scent of whiskey.\n\n"Mr. President, Governor Rockefeller," Gerald Ford, the head of the Republican House Conference, acknowledged. "I understand you've been pushing for the increase in Amtrak funding in the latest transit bill that, uh, we've been drawing up in committee."\n\nHart nodded, "You'll get the outlays from Jane when we touch down. The money will go to expanding service, upgrading stations, new locomotives; Jerry, you know this goes."\n\n"Yes, well, Mr. President, the issue is that my conference can't back you on this," Ford looked apologetic. "A lot of them weren't all that enthusiastic with Amtrak in the beginning. You've heard them; they think it's just a government subsidy for a declining service, and uh, many of them say it'll just be throwing good money after bad, you see."\n\n"They think it's all going to the cities," Rockefeller murmured darkly. "The rail hubs, New York and the Northeast." The Governor sloshed his drink, "they're pinching pennies."\n\nFord nodded. "The Works Committee is split pretty badly, and there's a good chance the money's going to be held up. Now, I can try to smooth things out, but to be honest, Ph- Mr. President, you know most of my members come from districts that aren't all that big fans of the URI in the first place, and I'm responsible to them as much as I am to Grand Rapids."\n\nHart adjusted his glasses."
 hart.tree.8.a: ""Governor, how about you work the delegations, and I'll meet with the holdouts?""
 hart.tree.8.b: ""Jerry, I'll get Albert to work on a compromise, but I'll need your backing for the next Civil Rights bill""

 hart.tree.9.t: "Oddities and Audits"
 hart.tree.9.desc: "The Hart administration's transportation agenda was, to say the least, sweeping. It ordered expansions to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Transportation, including a hefty purse for construction and acquisition projects across the country. Wherever a new Bureau of Transportation building sprung up, jobs for road paving, laying rail, building overpasses, viaducts, underpasses, and tunnels, all at once in a thousand different places across the country. Federal money bought trains, buses, airplanes, station furnishings, employee salaries, and neat, new Amtrak-branded cups for drink service on every train. It was the most significant single investment in American infrastructure from top to bottom and touched nearly every decrepit hindering transportation in the United States. It was revolutionary, and that's why they hated it.\n\n"They" were the party bosses, ward healers, and blue-collar back-slappers that made politics happen in urban Democratic strongholds, and years of underhanded machine politics had crowned Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley as their king. "He told me, 'The mayor needs political solvency,' and I think we both know what that means," explained Secretary of Commerce Mike Monroney, seated across from the President, who loosely masked his discontent. As Senator from Oklahoma, Monroney had thought little of the Democratic Chicago Mayor, but recent dispatches on the transportation issue had quickly soured his opinion. Mayor Daley's office had kindly informed Monroney that they needed an audit before offering their full support on account of the "uncertainties" a project like this brings. "What is this?" asked Hart bluntly, tossing the memorandum onto his desk, which recommended six months to audit the transportation initiative. "Am I supposed to ask Congress for six months because he has doubts about our accounting?" It was frustrating."
 hart.tree.9.a: "Authorize the audit, we need the support."

In this America, it was possible to go anywhere at any time, and it only required time, a bit of walking, and a fair fare to keep the lights on. This transportation dreamland runs trains every five minutes, connecting stations and areas of public interest by bus lines at an even greater frequency, along roadways filled with affordable automobiles to serve the web's gaps. An investment into public transportation infrastructure is a payment toward American accessibility and delivers on the promise that the United States should be enjoyed by all its citizens.\n\n"At least, that's the idea." President Philip Hart stated, ending his impromptu lecture with a curt gesture. The speech's only audience, Vice President Chep Morrison, feigned applause with a chuckle before levying his response, barely telegraphing, "My only concern would be the books-" before the President slumped loudly back into his chair. After a brief, pregnant pause, the Vice President smirked and prodded, in a low voice, "You don't think Secretary Jacobs has bugged the office, do you?" No, replied the President, who smiled despite rolling his eyes. Morrison continued, "Then what's the problem with some budget talk between us? If you're concerned about what to cut, take it out of our hands. Why not... poll it? See what the people want, and give us some breathing room." It seemed reasonable enough, thought Hart, and he leaned forward to grab his desk phone."

Respondents answered questions ranging from their satisfaction with government transportation services to their priorities for future infrastructure. After weeks of waiting, the results were assembled into neat columned-rows and forwarded as a condensed teletype report to the White House.\n\nMembers of the Hart administration's unofficial "Transportation Task Group" sat around a folding table in the oval office, each transfixed on the stapled packet of paper in silence. Suddenly, a shrill whistle let loose from Vice President Morrison's lips, and President Hart, Secretary Jacobs, and Secretary Monroney quickly turned to attention. "You see this?" The Vice President scoffed in disbelief, tossing his papers to the desk, "Mr. President, you could bust GM, Ford, and Chevro-let tomorrow, and they'd love you for it! What are you thinking, a 'people's car?'" Cheap leaned into the joke, expecting laughter from at least the President, but instead Philip Hart's brow arched at the suggestion.\n\nA generic, all-purpose, government-subsidized automobile? Not since wartime had the government imagined such an ambitious production scheme and, as if visited by a vision of his future, Hart could hear deafening jeers of "socialism!" and "fascism!" reverberating through the Senate hall. He could also see an American breadwinner finally able to afford a family vehicle and enjoy all the blessings of personal mobility. The gravity of his suggestion dawned on the Vice President, and Chep was suddenly beside himself. "Phi-er, Mr. President, you can't be serious! It was a joke!"\n\n"More cars are bad for urban congestions," chimed Secretary Jacobs, peering down at her copy of the report, "but... this could kickstart economic regrowth in the cities. Sure the investment's frontloaded, but it's good policy." She smiled at Chep, who looked at the President meekly, but it was no use. President Hart had been inspired."

Those present had scanned page after page searching for something remarkable, but it was soon apparent that the report contained nothing of value. "Nothing. No trends, no hard feelings, soft spots, just..." Chep Morrison rocked in his chair idly out of boredom, speaking under his breath, "...jack, and his best buddy, shit."\n\nWith a sigh, President Hart laid his papers down and gestured to his cabinet for comments. Secretary Jacobs spoke up first, posing, "They don't like or dislike anything in any remarkable amount, so why not tighten things as they are now? Regulations and subsidies go hand-in-hand." The mention of subsidies summoned a deep groan from the Vice President, who Hart pacified with a dismissing wave. "We'll have to be careful about codependence," said the President, sucking in air, "but maybe we can get through to those suits yet, and maybe it won't be so expensive." Aside from a few darting glances, the cabinet showed no solid reaction to Hart's consensus statement and, before long, moved on to other business."

 hart.tree.13.desc: "The reverberating rumble of giant oak doors clattering shut behind Philip Hart signaled that work at the White House was done for the day. Past the entrance hall's west-facing entrance, President Hart can relax with his family and pretend, if vainly, for a few precious hours that the Harts were just like any regular family. When those doors shut, the President had instructed the White House staff shortly after the inauguration, with unusual sternness, they shouldn't open until morning. Still, the business found its way through the cracks, and President Hart was never truly free from work.\n\n"Janey?" called Philip Hart, stepping over a pile of shoes onto the staircase before craning his head to look up. A deep female voice returned, "Mister President, I have a high priority communique for you," to which Philip groaned. He rounded the banister, loosening his tie, and met his wife with a kiss.\n\nMrs. Hart handed her husband a glass of water and began, "Phil, dear, somehow during my day, I came into possession of this letter from Secretary McCarthy to..." She slid the letter into his hand and tapped his chest, "... his excellency, the President." Great, thought Philip, who shifted their embrace to tear the letter open, and he began to read aloud:\n\n"Mr. President,\nI am writing to you regarding recent agriculture investments, which I strongly disagree with. American agriculture is a fragile ecosystem, and I am worried I have not done enough for the administration in this regard."\n\nPhilip murmured the rest of the letter to himself, finishing it and handing it to Janey. As she read it, Philip remarked, "Well, I didn't think he felt so strongly." Indeed, the letter oozed with paranoia that seemed to come from nowhere. Janey nodded in agreement, adding, "Maybe he's under pressure; why don't you invite him over?" It had been a while since the Harts last kept company with a midwesterner, and the Secretary of Agriculture otherwise seemed an amicable fellow. Content, Philip mused, "Well, I'll phone Gene tomorrow." Then, he mimed a zipper closing his lips, and begged off further "work discussion" for more important topics."

He wondered to himself why he was awake at two in the morning trying to sort out rural infrastructure of all things. At least Vice President Chep was there to help him. In front of them stood map after map produced by the US Department of Agriculture, sketching out the population distribution of America's flyover country. Small town after small town appeared in such volume that they seemed to blur into each other. How was the government supposed to connect all of it together?\n\n"You know what, do we even need paved roads for connecting them to the highways? Why can't we just make do with gravel roads, or even just dirt paths?"\n\nChep gave him a skeptical look.\n\n"Paving all the roads would be quite expensive," continued Hart.\n\n"Now that sounds funny comin' outta your mouth. Ain't you the liberal spender?"\n\nHart laughed.\n\n"But honestly, I don't think this is something we can cheapen out on. The rural folk ain't ones to be neglected, especially as they already think you're just some big-city liberal who doesn't care about them. You need to win their respect - a lesson I learned when I needed to cut taxes on produce during my term as governor to win over the rural vote!"\n\nHart nodded, considering Chep's advice. Paving all the rural roads connecting to the highways would cost a pretty penny, but it just might be what he needed to win over this part of America."

He was a man with a deep reservoir of patience and humility.\n\nBut as he approached the eighth hour of sitting in a motorcade, Hart felt himself near a breaking point. When he got back to Washington, he was going to strangle the staffer who suggested the President himself take an "inaugural" ride up and down America's new highways.\n\n"Are we... are we almost done?" The President asked, trying his hardest to stretch his legs in the limousine while retaining his dignity.\n\n"Just a little further, dear," said Janey. The First Lady, normally a bright, shining beacon, seemed deflated herself. The bright sundress, so immaculate at the start of the day, had begun to crinkle from so much sitting. "We have uh... a visit at a town, I think. Some handshakes. And a speech to some highway workers."\n\n"Christ, the speech." The President smacked the back of his head into the car seat. After being hot and sweaty in a car for several hours, he could not imagine a less pleasant activity than having to deliver a rousing, uplifting speech about the virtues of public transportation. "Maybe next time I launch an initiative it can be, I don't know, about cruise ships. Air travel, perhaps."\n\nThat made Janey laugh. The President smiled.

"Well, he did, and now it's our mess."\n\nThe 'it' in question being a highway cutting through a neighborhood with a... diverse populace. The excuses were lackluster, and the intent was obvious. City planners doing their damnedest to keep minorities out of their parks, pools, and playgrounds.\n\n"What do you want me to do about it, Jane? I mean... hypothetically I can intervene and undo the damage, but it'll set us back considerably." Jane prepared to open her mouth, but Phil kept speaking.

Slowly, he entered the office and saw the President speaking candidly with his Chief of Staff.\n\n"...and I mean, what a fish- Oh! Gene!" President Hart called out to the Secretary of Agriculture from across the room, beckoning him to come closer. This joviality caught McCarthy off-guard, and paranoid plots began materializing in his head. He anxiously shook the President's hand and said hello. An awkward silence followed.\n\nSecretary McCarthy stood and prodded the floor with his shoe. "Well, Mr. President, you called me here..." He braced himself. The President squinted his eyes, sensing something from McCarthy, before placing his hand on the Secretary's shoulder. "Gene, if you don't want to sit next to Mrs. Jacobs, it's alright; just tell me."\n\nThe response caught McCarthy off-guard, and he stumbled backward a few steps. "What? No! I thought you wanted me out!" the Secretary of Agriculture blurted out his confusion and immediately covered his mouth. "I am so sorry, Mr. President. I... I don't know." This was met by a stupified stare from the President, who quickly erupted into laughter. "No, Gene!" he let out through the fit, "No, that note was about the Friday reception. I thought you'd call me, but when you requested a meeting, of course, I penciled you in!" Eugene McCarthy was red-faced but managed a few laughs. "So," he started, "I'm doing fine?" Hart hesitated briefly before nodding. "You're doing fine. Good, even." He patted McCarthy's shoulder again.\n\nMaking such a mistake was a seething humiliation to McCarthy, whose cheeks were flushed red. He sputtered sounds of embarrassment, "Sorry, Mr. President.

We're doing this all across the country!"\n\n"I know, it's just-"\n\nChep interjected, "It's just that there's so much to do...right?" Hart nodded, and Chep continued. "Well, it'll never be enough.

Not just imparting knowledge on the next generation, but giving them a place to socialize and a shared experience that shapes their worldview! How can we address the deficiencies in our education without supporting our schools?"\n\nPresident Hart nodded. "Secretary Jacobs, I completely concur. For too long, we've allowed our schools to decay and our students to fall behind the other superpowers. We need new investments, not only to construct new schools in underserved communities in order to address inequality, but refurbish and revitalize existing schools. To make them the community centers you describe them else. To make them something America can take pride in!"\n\nHart looked down at his desk, a feeling of weariness passing through him. As the battles over integration had shown, education was one of the thorniest issues in American politics.

Hart inquired.\n\nZavon yawned, "Yays and Nays, Mister President, Yays and Nays."\n\nThousands of miles away from each other, two veterans watching Walter Cronkite watched American history forever change. The 24th amendment was ratified, and the right to vote would now be extended to millions of Americans. No longer would anyone be old enough to die for their country but not old enough to vote."

 hart.tree.37.desc: ""I do so like Green Eggs and Ham. Thank you! Thank you, Sam I am."\n\nThe small classroom sprang to life in applause. Quiet as to not cause a ruckus, but adequately audible enough to inform the President that his rendition of Green Eggs and Ham went over well with the crowd. First, the children were led out of the classroom single file. Leaving the Secret Service, the parents, and President Hart. The parents took their turns having a casual conversation with the President. Being escorted out after their discussion concluded.\n\nWhile most were eager to have a chance to speak to the Commander-In-Chief, Isabella De Campos was reluctant. Once the second to last parent left the classroom, it was just her, Hart, and a contingent of Secret Servicemen.\n\n"You must be Mrs. De Campos." Isabella nervously nodded, and Hart continued. "Your daughter was asking all kinds of questions. I, unfortunately, did not know what Green Eggs and Ham tastes like."\n\nThe two shared a laugh, and Isabella spoke up. "Marisa is a curious girl, more curious than I was at her age. If we were still in Colombia she would be in the fields instead of a classroom." Hart quietly listened to the woman, "I never learned to read, but Marisa, she can already write and speak in Spanish and English. Now I hear she's trying to learn French!"\n\nHart was almost left speechless. Out of the dozens of Public Relation stunts he did in childrens classrooms, he never heard an experience that touched him quite like this one. Nevertheless, he conjured a response for the grateful woman."

 hart.tree.38.desc: "There were too many reporters here, President Hart thought. Too many cameras and microphones, too many prying eyes. He'd learned to look calm in front of the public ages ago, but that didn't mean that he ever found it any less uncomfortable. Still, he couldn't blame them. It was their job, after all, and it was his staff which had invited them inside to see him sign this order. Chep's idea. Who else?\n\nSpeaking of the devil, there he was, beaming for the television screens at home. "Is everyone ready?" he asked, and the throng replied affirmatively. Then he turned to Philip with a slight nod and that same smile. That was the President's cue to look down and start signing - something he was eminently comfortable with, by contrast to the rest of all this.\n\n"An executive order to direct the Department of Justice to investigate racial bias in private school enrollment." That's how he'd worded it. The order itself was a nothingburger, really. The private schools in question were blatantly built by white people for white people. The only difference between them and the segregated schools of before was that they didn't say it outright anymore. What Hart really wanted to come from this was a lawsuit. If some arrogant bigot got the bright idea to try and show the Feds what for, maybe they could get the Court to rule their way and let them fix the issue. It was crafty, sneaky, a bit underhanded - in other words, it was Chep's idea too.\n\nHis signature sprawled out over paper, Hart picked up the order and turned it around, showing it off to the cameras. The grin on his face resisted all his efforts to the contrary."

Chep settled into his regular seat with a contented sigh. "Mercy Middle School, just south of Gary. They're sayin' that we've overstepped our boundaries with all this investigatin', infringin' on private business and all that. You've heard it before."\n\n"I have." Hart scratched at his cheek. "And you think the Supreme Court could hear it?"\n\nAnother Chep grin. "Well, the school board's gettin' all sorts of fundin' from conservative groups, so they'll take it as far as the money gets them. I'd say the case has legs."\n\nHart returned the same smile.

His bodyguards trailing behind him, he ducked through the thin drizzle and equally thin groups of demonstrators that always seemed to hang around the building, walking down First and then Capitol in desperate search of the nearest phone booth. The first one he found was occupied by a long-haired man who gave him a dirty look as he approached - he had to wonder if it was just a warning or if the man actually knew who he was - and so he kept walking onto Second. His bodyguards finally caught him as he stepped into the next booth over, closing the door with a thud.\n\nHis fingers worked practically without him thinking about it, dialing in numbers he knew by heart. With the receiver crammed between his shoulder and ear, the operator's voice finally let him put his thoughts into place.\n\n"Hello, White House Operator?

Yes, the court's decided. They're letting us go ahead with private school desegregation. Yes, Mr. President. Ah... "\n\nHart had asked a question.

As grateful as he was to miss Algebra, Timmy found himself peeved that his mom made him get a haircut and dress fancy, and for what? To sit on the outdoor bleachers and listen to a boring man talk a lot. That was until his best friend Ralphie nudged his shoulder.\n\n"Do you see those people in suits?" Ralphie pointed to the field, past the President's podium.\n\"Yeah, they're secret service, my Daddy told me all about them last night."\n\n"There's a lot of them in the very back left corner." Following Tony's instructions, Timmy saw a gaggle of agents spread out on the field and cover their ears.\n\nRalphie and Timmy, realizing what was coming, covered their ears seconds before the whirring of Helicopter blades came into earshot. Then, the first helicopter that Timmy had seen in his life touched down on the field of his school.\n\nPresident Hart looked out at the crowd of children, he loved this part. Waiting for the kids to simmer down, he finally spoke once again. "What you just saw was the helicopter that my best friend, Mrs. Jacobs, travels in. All of you are gonna get the chance to sit in the helicopter, how does that sound?""

Do you know how many of our kids go to the cities for college?! They promise to come back, but everyone knows they're never returning!"\n\nA cacophony went up across the large room, and Chep sighed. "Back to the drawing board." He muttered under his breath.\n\nAn hour later, an alternative question and answer form was proposed. One by one, people queued and got a chance to ask their questions. It demoralized Chep, the despair of these ruralites. In the suburbs, and in the cities, Philip's policies were beginning to bear fruit. In the rest of America, however, it felt as if crumbs were all that the ruralites were getting from the urban renewal pie. Hart would surely appreciate the input, and try to adjust their policies to include ruralites."

Now we're getting around to lunch. Boy, these Oklahoma caterers know what they're doing." Hart remarked, complimenting the sandwich in his hand.\n\n"No thanks, but I wouldn't mind some peace and quiet. Always good to get away from Capitol Hill." The House Speaker remarked whilst seating himself comfortably.\n\nIn an executive office in Guangdong, or the Volkshalle in Germania, one would expect the upper echelons of power to have a heated discussion concerning their villainous machinations. Instead, in the small town of McAlester, Oklahoma, the top three men in the Line of Succession talked about simple things.\n\nChep, a Bayou boy, complained about this bitter cold. Proposing a Presidential trip to New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras.\n\n"We just have to give Zsa Zsa the slip and we'll be good to go, I reckon."

Taking a deep breath, Philip Hart stood up and made his way onto the field, he knew what awaited him on the Pitchers mound. If he was lucky, there would be a mix of jeers and cheers. Most likely, only a chorus of angry Americans awaited him during this embarrassing spectacle.\n\n"For tonights first pitch of the [GetYear] opening day, please welcome the President of the United States!"\n\nOrgan music blared over the loudspeaker, and thunderous applause erupted across the stadium. Instead of sulking to the pitchers mound, Philip confidently sauntered, baseball in hand. Getting into position, he waved to the crowd. Then pitched to the catcher. When the baseball reached his glove, the spectators cheered once again.\n\nUpon completing his short but sweet ceremonial pitch, Hart approached the catcher.

This court is adjourned."\n\nTrevor Haynes let out the breath he had been holding. That was the tenth county in Mississipi that had their sundown laws dismantled. Knowing the ire that was just evoked in this court, Haynes vacated the premises to a nearby diner in downtown Jacksonville with his legal team.\n\nThirty minutes later, the famished legal team was munching down on their meal. Trevor stared out the window, the sun was just starting to set.\n\n"Watching the sunset, eh?" One female member of the team nudged Haynes on the shoulder.\n\n"Huh? Oh, yeah. It's ironic isn't it. We just dismantled a sundown town and here we are watching the sunset." Haynes cracked a smirk.\n\n"You're going places, y'know."

"I suppose I will be, I just wish it'd be more meritocratic."\n\nThe aide laughed, "Meritocratic?

"But, our concerns about spending haven't gone away. You've heard it before, and you'll hear it again. We can't keep footing the bill. The budget's got to be balanced somehow."\n\n"I might be able to get you some leeway for this fiscal year," said the Senator from the Bluegrass. "They know you, and like you, Mr. President, whatever our policy disagreements, but Barry and I need something concrete to take back to the Conference for the next session.

He and Vice President Morrison had been reviewing the report published by Hart's automotive commission. He had intended it to be a small study to develop ideas on how to improve highway safety or encourage better fuel efficiency standards. Instead, hidden among the typical bureaucrat-ese, Hart's experts had sent him a bomb: a request that the federal government support the construction of a standard, generic-brand car.\n\nWhen he'd first skimmed the executive summary, he'd laughed. It was an outlandish idea. Then, he'd read the damn report. God help him, it actually made sense. There were charts, showing the cost of cars increasing over time. There were interviews with families and studies from transportation experts at Harvard.\n\nHart put his glasses back on. "We're moving forward on this. I know it's going to be a mess, but there's a real need here that we need to address. Just tell which company is least likely to make this blows up in our faces." He waved a hand.

What's the point of letting the feds poach our executives if we can't call in favors every now and then?"\n\nBeebe and Ford both ignored the remark.

He thumbed through Ford's internal projections for sales under the best-case and most likely scenarios as well as the Administration's plans to distribute the cars to dealers. He wasn't happy about it, but the numbers still added up. The risk was still worth the reward.\n\n"Fine. They can have the Maverick. Have the boys draw up a proposal and send it back to Washington.

It's exactly the kind of car that Hart's people have in mind for their Americar." Beebe took out a stack of papers and laid it on the coffee table. "We accept this and we have guaranteed sales from the federal government for the next decade, maybe more. It's under a generic label, yes, but every American will know that they're driving a Ford.

Beebe turned to Ford. "I've run the numbers. I've looked at the guarantees that the feds are willing to give us. We make money no matter what if we go through with this deal and, if it's successful, the sky's the limit. Just look at the evidence."\n\nHe set a stack of papers down on the table.

"I've just gotten out of a long meeting with Hart's people about a possible alternative.\n\nRoche tried not to frown. "You know that I have real doubts about this whole enterprise, Pete. I don't dislike Hart—he's a good man—but we really can't be kicking around—."\n\nPete was at his desk now, waving one hand in a sign of understanding while unloading projections and schematics with another. Roche picked up one of the papers as Pete began talking. "I know, I know, but they've been driving a hard bargain and I think there might actually be an opportunity here to bounce back after the whole Nader debacle. We could license off the Monte Carlo."\n\nAt that, Roche laughed. "Yes, I seem to remember a certain prominent engineer designing that."\n\nPete gave a sheepish grin. "Well, it's a good-looking car with reasonable fuel mileage and back air shocks to help reduce the impact of accidents. It demonstrates to the public that we're learning from the past and putting them first." He put his finger on a chart. "I really think this is what we need right now. It's a solid opportunity."\n\nRoche clicked the pen on his desk nervously. He still had misgivings about this project but, if nothing else, Pete's assessment seemed solid. He sighed. "All right, let's see if this takes.""

 hart.americar.8.desc: "GM CEO James Roche knew who was at his door before he could speak. He did not bother looking up from his desk as Pete Estes entered, sliding yet another manila folder onto his desk, and waiting for acknowledgement. Roche let him dangle for a few moments before speaking. "They rejected your own car design." He clicked his tongue. "In certain parts of the industry, that might be an unforgivable sin."\n\nHe felt Pete wave a dismissive hand. "What can I say? The Administration's negotiators are, if nothing else, determined to get quality."\n\n"A certain phrase about the perfect being the enemy of the good comes to mind."\n\n"I think that only applies when perfect is unachievable." Pete said with the excitement of an engineer who had solved an intractable problem. Roche finally looked up with a raised eyebrow as Pete spread papers across his desk. "After the last rejection, I was really banging my head against the wall. I went back to the engineers, sure that there was nothing else we could provide. Then it came to me—the model."\n\nPete pressed the tip of his forefinger into the design of a long, sleek car that seemed to Roche like a rocket. "We had a model in development called the Buick Century Cruiser. It's got an engine with better fuel efficiency that anything on the market and state-of-the-art airbags to protect against crashes. I removed some of the more outlandish elements like the TV and steering wheel-less design, but it's a damn good car."\n\n"And if it's such a damn good car then why aren't we selling it ourselves?"\n\n"That's easy: We'd never break even, but with the Administration willing to license and cover most of the costs..." He trailed off. "We get to produce a car that most engineers could only dream of, one that will make us legends if this thing actually succeeds. And best of all, with Uncle Sam footing the bill, we pay almost nothing for it. This is a golden opportunity."\n\nRoche blinked. "Goodness, I guess we better get moving then.""

I wanted to talk to you about the Hart... thing."\n\nRoche forced a smile and then gestured for the chair in front of him. Estes sat down and set a manila folder on his boss's desk. "I've been meeting with the Administration's people and they aren't happy with the latest design. We've been going back and forth for some time and... well..." He scratched his head.\n\n"The numbers just aren't adding up," Roche added in an attempt to help. "They want us to operate at a loss."\n\n"I don't think they mean it but, yes. They're pushing on the deal but it's clear that we have very different expectations of what this project might look like and... we were already pretty skeptical from the outset.\n\nRoche sighed. "I was worried about this when I let the negotiations continue, you know. Hart's got people like Walter Reuther whispering in his ear and thinks he can push us around." Roche shook his head. "Pull the plug on the deal. There's going to be some bad press for us and the Administration, but it's better than the long-term damage of continuing this project."\n\nEstes gave a sad smile.

"The Americar Falcon is a great, modern car for any man on the go, a great, convenient car for everyday Americans."\n\n"Yes, darling, because if there's one thing America wants to be known for it's 'convenience.'"\n\nChep was suddenly aware that Zsa Zsa was beside him. Before he could say another word, she'd popped open the driver's side door and propped herself side saddle. Cameras snapped. "And the women of America, I'm sure, will be delighted with its many luxuries including..." She glanced into the interior. "Two mirrors. A radio. Airbags. Incredible." She said in a droll voice. There were light giggles from the reporters. "Ford sure knows how to treat a girl."\n\nThere were loud howls of shocked laughter from the reporters. Chep, mortified, forced himself to smile.

Always a friend to the cameras, she let the photographers take a photo of the two of them standing there before sliding the driver's door open with a small click and siddling inside. She pretended to inspect the interior as the men snapped photos of her splayed across the seat.\n\n"It's no Italian leather but it does have such comfortable seating and a nice radio..."

Chep turned to see his wife Zsa Zsa walking toward him and the cameras. Her heels clicked against the floor until she was right beside him, peering theatrically into the Americar's window.

"I was worried this would happen, you know. If it isn't solvent then there's going to be fights over funding in Congress. There's going to be all kind of finger pointing and nasty business." The President looked down. "What are we going to do?"\n\n"Well, the way I see it, there's two options. The first one is that we keep the project running and hope that, some time in the future, this whole rigamarole becomes worth it. There's still gonna be costs but at least we can say we got this crazy idea off the ground."\n\n"And the second?"\n\n"We cut our losses.

Chep began. Hart tried to resist the urge to raise an eyebrow at the man's obvious excitement. "And, well, I don't have any words for it. It looks like the goddamn thing's solvent.

You mean they're really...?"\n\n"I'd love to take credit for it all Philip, I really would, but you know as well as I do that I thought this was a cockamamie idea from the start. Somehow... somehow, this thing is looking like the biggest success since the Model T." Chep grinned.\n\nHart put down the briefing and turned in his chair toward the wall.

 hart.kissinger.starlight.1.t: "Prelude of Deluge"
 hart.kissinger.starlight.1.desc: "Amid the crowd of internationals and Georgetown-types that typically populated Sans Souci, Samantha stood out; she was a failing B-list actress and nearly at the end of her rope, so the chance to mingle among high society seemed a godsend. Reservations emerged when she was sitting in the booth reserved by her date for the night, who had left her alone for nearly a half hour before he arrived. When the esteemed doctor did show up, he made no grand entrance; he was tired, his tie was undone, and he used it to clean his glasses as he plopped down across from Samantha. Then, as if noticing his dinner guest's presence for the first time, his grumpy demeanor flipped.\n\n"You must be Samantha," he opened, smiling, raising his otherwise low, gravely voice into a cadence approaching charisma, "I'm Henry." Samantha accepted a handshake, mildly bemused before Doctor Kissinger opened up with a flurry of questions. What did she do, where was she from, what did she like, did she like politics, and, shortly after the appetizer, what were her thoughts on foreign policy?\n\n"Well, I don't like Germany." The feeling was mutual, he assured her, and the fuzzy-haired Bavarian leaned in to deliver what felt like a rehearsed speech. "The world is split, more or less, between three poles of international power," he began, articulating his points with hand gestures, "but this multipolar world order cannot hold; if Japan were to align with Germany, then America would be doomed."\n\nDoom. Scary stuff for chit-chat and clams, thought Samantha. "Germany is a revolutionary state and cannot be trusted. The United States must open diplomacy with Japan if we want any hope of containing Nazism." He paused his oration for a sip of water, and Samantha wondered aloud, "So, you're going to Tokyo?"\n\n"Perhaps."\n\nTheir talk soon tapered off and Dr. Kissinger paid the bill. After exchanging parting pleasantries and a vague promise to meet again, the man from Harvard left her on her apartment doorstep. She concluded that he wasn't really her type, and the feeling must have been mutual since that was the last time they saw each other."

 hart.kissinger.starlight.2.desc: "The concept of "national security" sat at the intersection of foreign relations and defense policy. Thus any suitable professional advice on the subject should come from someone quite familiar with both, which, from the perspective of Philip Hart, Henry Kissinger had neither of. The Harvard doctor's prior academic experience was impressive enough, but did a successful literary career and a brief Army stint qualify him to speak with such authority on matters of national security? President Hart's uncertainty on the subject persisted past the first 100 days of his administration, and Dr. Kissinger remained in office solely to please Nelson Rockefeller.\n\nAfter their standard, bi-weekly Oval Office briefing on national security, Philip Hart and Henry Kissinger started talking about dreams. "My dream is to establish a diplomatic consensus with Japan and extricate Germany from world affairs," broached Kissinger, whose calm demeanor betrayed his inner nervousness. Even as a political disconnect, Kissinger knew establishing a "détente" between the United States and Japan was an incredibly volatile political decision for an American President. He figured it would be a tough sell. Seconds passed in silence before Hart spoke up.\n\n"You mean... to negotiate? Why, Hawaii? The ports?" The idea swirled between pros and cons behind the President's thoughtful eyes until he reached a conclusion. "It's dangerous, but I think you know that." He paused. "Go ahead, look into it. But, uh, be discrete." Doctor Kissinger smiled and nodded, jumping to his feet with a hitherto concealed energy.\n\nAs Kissinger moved to exit, President Hart called out, "Henry, be sure to tell the Secretary of State about this. Maybe he can help?" The National Security Advisor nearly scoffed at the suggestion but managed a writhing smile. As if, Mr. President. This was too important to risk ruining by those stooges at State."

 hart.kissinger.starlight.3.t: "Bleeding Hearts Club"
 hart.kissinger.starlight.3.desc: "By nearly all measures, Henry Kissinger was a conservative; he preferred balanced budgets and believed autocracies were in the best position to conduct foreign policy. Kissinger idolized the 19th-century Austrian foreign minister Klemens von Metternich, who served as a statesman for over 37 years and managed the defense of European ancien regimes from the Napoleonic revolutionary tide.\n\nHowever, Metternich likely would not have approved of the company Kissinger kept during his leisure time, as the National Security Advisor populated his staff with liberals and academic radicals in striking contrast to his own beliefs. This was his "Bleeding Hearts Club," a focus group for Kissinger's national security policy among his staff that met unofficially in their executive office space. They disagreed with their boss on nearly everything, but the open-air debate structure kept all arguments professional and enjoyable.\n\n"What are we to do about Japan?" posed Kissinger, who nibbled at a sandwich as a small crowd of post-graduate staffers crowded his desk. Indeed, making "détente" with Japan was an excellent idea when presented to the President, but the specifics of maneuvering this monumental task were beyond Kissinger. Suggestions ranged from letters to the Emperor to a false-flag defection, with reasonable heads landing on the consensus pick that Kissinger approaches the Japanese ambassador directly.\n\nBut where? "My father works for the Iberian embassy," offered a meek staffer, her voice uncertain of its place in the conversation, "he says there'll be a banquet this Friday. Could you meet the ambassador there?" Murmurs followed as Kissinger considered the suggestion, and the Doctor snapped his fingers. "An excellent suggestion, Alice. Very well." Kissinger clapped his hands, patronizing his enamored audience with a signal to disperse, and stepped in stride to the Oval Office. He needed an invitation."

Casual slurs thrown their way. Soapwater foamed down the walls and drifted on a slope into grates beside the sidewalks. The police formed a line of cars, sirens painting the dark alleyways in red and blue. Ambassador Takeuchi, qualified though he was, sighed as he observed the washing. America was a strange land, still. Not without its wonders. Or its horrors.\n\nAs he walked back into his office to close the day, an aide tapped him on the shoulder. A letter from the Iberian Embassy. Party in a few days; Japanese presence requested, nay, prized. As he sat down, a discreet note fell out of the envelope. Much to talk about, it read. Mutually beneficial discussions pending your presence. Hope you will attend. Regards, Kissinger.\n\nWonder and horror, indeed. Takeuchi ringed for his secretary. "Write the party at the Iberian embassy down on the itinerary," he said. "My attendance is crucial.""
 hart.kissinger.starlight.4.a: "What awaits?"

 hart.kissinger.starlight.5.t: "From the Beginning"
 hart.kissinger.starlight.5.desc: "Since the formation of the Iberian Union, the Madrid government maintained custodianship of the former Portuguese and Spanish embassies as mixed-use properties. The Spanish embassy was home to all consular services for the Union, and renters' fees from the former Portuguese complex covered most of the diplomatic mission's operating costs. As a result, Iberian ambassadors gained a reputation for using budget surpluses to host prolific dinner parties for Washington's elite. Harry Truman had attended five such embassy parties during his career and had no difficulty fulfilling Dr. Henry Kissinger's unusual request for an invitation. When asked why he needed access, the National Security Advisor meekly replied, "Networking."\n\nThat wasn't far from the truth, as Kissinger quickly realized that many unfamiliar faces at the party were familiar with his writings on diplomacy. Discussing diplomacy with the Mexican ambassador yielded Kissinger access to a circle of notables which included the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Ryuji Takeuchi, whom he invited to stay back after the dinner call.\n\n"I am prepared to offer an excellent deal on behalf of the American government." Kissinger spoke low, his gravelly voice hard on Takeuchi's trained ear, "Something small, for now, but to start a relationship. We should start being proactive." Takeuchi's right brow peaked, indicating he was offended at the insinuation that Japan was not proactive, but he withheld further comment. The ambassador spoke halfheartedly, "Why don't you offer your deal over dinner? Some other time." He meant it as a gentle deferral, but Kissinger took it as the ambassador's word; the plan was coming along. The National Security Advisor thanked Takeuchi for his time and urged him to go to dinner without him.\n\nAfter he was left alone, Kissinger surreptitiously fled the party and made his way to a nearby payphone. He fed the machine pocket change and pounded his office phone number into the keypad, leaning back in the booth as the call rang three times. The line clicked open, and, not waiting for the receiving end to speak, flooded the receiver with orders: "Tomorrow morning, call the embassy. Schedule dinner for us. Do it before he gets into work; otherwise, he might say no.""
 hart.kissinger.starlight.5.a: "Ah, diplomacy."

 hart.kissinger.starlight.6.t: "Poles of Power"
 hart.kissinger.starlight.6.desc: "The Japanese ambassador to the United States, Ryuji Takeuchi, had been ambushed by Henry Kissinger's staff into attending a dinner meeting with the National Security Advisor at the French bistro Sans Souci. The Bleeding Hearts had planned it all; the two would enter from the side and sit at a curtained table where Kissinger could keep him as a captive audience until an understanding was reached or the ambassador mustered himself to leave. Surely it wouldn't come to that, reasoned Kissinger, who arrived early to supervise the fixings.\n\nDinner from Sans Souci might have been a good enough reason to attend for ambassador Takeuchi, whose taste for western cuisine had only grown after being appointed to Washington DC. Still, the prospect of a mysterious deal from the American President had grown on him, and he wondered what Kissinger might have to offer. Takeuchi seated himself inside their veiled dining space and greeted the National Security Advisor cordially.\n\nAs the ambassador skimmed his menu, Kissinger asked, "Are you familiar with the theory of multipolarity?" Takeuchi didn't look up but shook his head in the negative. "It holds," started Kissinger, "that the global balance of power is divided between multiple 'poles' of political influence. This includes Japan, the United States, Germany, and the sum influence of lesser powers."\n\n"After the war, there was peace," he continued, "but no new order. Instead, we have grown into ourselves and are forced to share a world with the revolutionary German state. Not since the dark ages has the world been so isolated from itself, and it is the principal powers' responsibility to mend this divide before it destroys us."\n\n"Germany cannot be trusted and cannot be negotiated with." Kissinger paused. "Japan, however, is a reasonable nation. Why shouldn't we establish a new consensus together?" The American public was the obvious reason, which Takeuchi presumed explained the literal veil of secrecy, but the prospect of a new consensus did intrigue him.\n\n"I believe this is worth relaying to my superior," Ambassador again paused for a sip, "but I promise nothing." That was enough for Kissinger, who obliged Takeuchi's reasonability to the fullest extent his NSA budget would allow."

With a wave of his hand, aides flocked out of the office.\n\nYes, sir. Takeuchi said. You're not going to believe this.\n\nOh?\n\nThe Americans want détente. Got a note from their National Security Advisor a few weeks ago, said that specifics were to follow. As always, your approval is paramount.\n\nBut why not through the Foreign Ministry?\n\nNot an option for them. One leak and the deal's off. Best not to antagonize the people at home, Kissinger said. Peace is a hard enough word to say in America.\n\nThe Prime Minister pursed his lips, pondering a reply."
 hart.kissinger.starlight.7.a: "Go on."

 hart.kissinger.starlight.8.t: "Hello, New Friend"
 hart.kissinger.starlight.8.desc: "Since their meeting, Dr. Henry Kissinger and his staff waited anxiously for the Japanese ambassador's response to their secret diplomatic overtures. This initiative's success would mean normalizing relations between Japan and the United States. Both nations might finally put World War Two behind them, and the Kissinger staff felt they were sitting on the cutting edge of history. All it required was an answer in the affirmative.\n\nSuddenly, the phone rang, and Kissinger frantically motioned for silence. He placed the receiver to his ear and enquired, "Hello?" Staffers likewise picked up their phones and clasped the mouthpiece, their hands shaking in eager anticipation. A few seconds passed before the warm voice of ambassador Takeuchi replied, "Hello, Dr. Kissinger. Are you well?" Yes, returned Kissinger, who clearly was more interested in hearing about the offer. "I have good news. My government is open to starting talks on trade or border delineation. If you so wish, these can be kept secret."\n\nThe office nearly wept with joy, but their boss insisted on silence. "From now on, we should do all business in person. Security." A puzzled silence followed until the ambassador offered an "Okay," and the conversation tapered off. Kissinger saddled his phone loudly and signaled his staff to cheer. He relished in their applause."

 hart.kissinger.starlight.9.desc: "In his meeting with Philip Hart on national security, Dr. Henry Kissinger felt a distinct sense of power over his President; Hart didn't know that Kissinger had just secured an inroad for negotiations with Japan, something previously considered impossible. Everything President Hart asked or said felt infantile to Dr. Kissinger, who mused to himself about a President in ignorance. Still, he answered each question readily and obediently until he saw a chance to assert himself.\n\nPresident Hart was clattering his loose papers together when Kissinger cleared his throat and began broaching the subject of Japan. "I have received very positive signals from the Japanese ambassador regarding secret talks," he said with a smirk, "You need only offer your approval." Surprise filled Hart's face, who wasn't aware Kissinger had made contact with the Japanese government. "I assume you've told Secretary Truman about this?" Kissinger conceded, "Not precisely," but he promised Truman would be consulted in the future.\n\n"Besides," boasted Kissinger, "did the results not speak for themselves? We can create the greatest diplomatic linkage of our lifetime, but only if you support me." Not only was the answer unsatisfying to Philip Hart, but its audacity also enraged him. How could an advisor dictate policy to the President? Still, the results were promising, and Hart figured failure at this stage would be relatively harmless. "Just be mindful," suggested the President, his voice tinted with displeasure, before he dismissed Dr. Kissinger."

"I do hope that the sushi is to your liking," said Ambassador Takeuchi. "It's so hard to find it in America, so I brought my private chef."\n\n"It's quite alright," said Henry Kissinger, grimacing as he fumbled with his chopsticks. If Takeuchi noticed his opposite number's difficulties, he didn't show it. "In any event," the Ambassador said, "I have talked with my government. They are interested in the possibility of détente between our two powers. I believe that a good first step would be to negotiate a security agreement scaling down our mutual military presence in the Pacific, to free up our assets against the Reich."\n\nKissinger swallowed a tuna roll. "I agree this would be constructive, but I think it's too early. Congress would tear the Administration apart over something like that. I would imagine, though I don't wish to presume, that many in Japan would be similarly unenthused. We need a smaller scale agreement to start, to get people used to the idea. Perhaps something to do with reopening trade."\n\n"Hmmm, that is very wise," Takeuchi mused after a sip of tea. "There are a number of outstanding trade issues between us. Fishing rights, passage through territorial waters- certain groups will always complain but this shouldn't be insurmountable.""

"Ambassador Takeuchi," the President said, hoping his start wasn't too obvious. "A pleasure."\n\n"I invited the Ambassador along because we're of the same mind when it comes to the need for détente," Kissinger said, taking a seat without having been invited. "Coordinating a strategy together would, I think, help this go over well with both our governments." Takeuchi remained standing, taking the empty seat next to Kissinger after Hart pointed to it. The Ambassador leaned forwards; when he spoke, his English was perfect. "We're planning to begin initial negotiations soon. My goal is that these negotiations succeed no matter what; I don't view subjects such as fishing rights as a serious concern. There are others in my country, however, who see any concessions, no matter how small, as surrender. If Japan is allowed to put forwards its terms, it will greatly smooth over resistance to détente from more... radical elements in my countries."\n\nHart grimaced, adjusting his glasses. "I see the wisdom in your approach, Ambassador," he said. "But opposition in the United States will be just as fierce, if not more, than the opposition in Japan. If we accept a Japanese leaning proposal it could poison détente for the American people. We need to give the people something- say, an extension of fishing rights in the Pacific." He stroked his chin, weighing his options."

Over the years, our fishermen had run-ins with the IJN - unfortunate events, by the way - around Hawaii."\n\n"Hawaii is Japanese," Takeuchi said. "No compromise on that."\n\n"And none proposed. The way we see it, Mr. Takeuchi, is that America and Japan are the two great powers of the Pacific. You control one shore, we control the other. Cooperation is natural in our relationship. Sorely needed, too. Wouldn't want the world to go up in flames because of a few shrimping boats, do we?" Kissinger smirked.\n\n"I see. So, what do you propose?" Takeuchi remained impassive, meeting the President's eye. Hart gave a faint smile in return.\n\n"A little bit of give is all we ask." Hart said. "American fishermen need the waters around Hawaii to make a living, and IJN gunboats on patrol present a constant risk of escalation." The President leaned forward on his desk. "You've been in America, Mr. Takeuchi. We love our democracy, and I am no different in this regard. However, public opinion is everything here. One drop of spilled blood can make Americans cry for rivers of the stuff."\n\n"Good for you, good for me." Kissinger said.\n\n"Exactly." The President grinned. "Hawaii is not up for compromise, I promise you that. What we want is an adjustment in maritime borders. Just a little bit of give."\n\nTakeuchi eyed both the President and his National Security Advisor. "I'll relay your requests to the Prime Minister." He rose from his seat. "Mr. President, it is an honor." Shaking Hart's hand, he walked out of the Oval Office."

To my surprise, they have elected for the Empire to set the terms. The first issue concerns the maritime borders in Hawaii. Naturally, we would continue to maintain our steadfast commitments in the region; the status of the islands is not under question.\n\nFrom my perspective as the impromptu plenipotentiary of this matter, Japan has two options going forward. The first would be to extend the Americans an olive branch, meeting them halfway where we exchange a de facto recognition of Hawaii's status in exchange for an extension of American fishing rights around the area. This way, Japan presents itself in possession of an initiative that we nonetheless use to make reasonable concessions from both sides. If détente is our objective above all, this would be the way to go.\n\nThe second option would be to press Japanese advantage for a greater-scope gain. North Pacific and the waters east of Hawaii have long been a grey area for the two dominant powers of the Pacific; putting talks behind a clarification of dominance could give us an edge, though Kissinger and Hart would not be happy with the terms we set. I leave it to the Cabinet to decide what the ideal course of action is.\n\nSigned, Takeuchi Ryuji."

Tokyo had gone for it. The US's fishing rights would extend far out into the Pacific. Sure, the US would have to unofficially recognize Japanese rule over Hawaii in exchange, but that wouldn't be in any of the papers.\n\nKissinger permitted himself a little grin. This was certainly a good start to détente; it would go a long way to countering claims of surrender. But he couldn't celebrate too much. This was a victory for America, but the Japanese will see this as a defeat. If he don't want them to back out of the coming negotiations on maritime transit, he knew he'd have to grant them some concession soon. This was a victory for America- now Kissinger had to make it a victory for Japan too."

Perhaps when the climate is better, more progress can be made." After a few more pleasantries, the line went dead. Kissinger slumped in the chair of the hotel room he'd booked for the negotiations, staring down at the phone in his hand. With a sudden snarl, he slammed it into his desk. Cracks echoed through his office; he felt a stab of pain as the shattered remnants of the phone cut his hand.\n\nThat fool. That worthless goddamned fool. After everything Kissinger had done, the President threw it away. And for what? To look strong? For a week's bump in the polls before the news cycle moved on? It was all gone. Détente was dead."

They wanted fishing rights in the north Pacific and west of Hawaii- almost up to the coast of Alaska. The demands were bold, to say the least.\n\nThe next day he stood in the Oval Office, reporting to Hart. "The coast of Alaska..." Hart massaged his temples. "I'm sorry, Henry. I can't accept this. I know we expected their offer to favor them, but this is insane. Schlafly will call us traitors and for once she'd be right."\n\n"Being honest, I would not accept this either," Kissinger said. "We need to maintain some prestige in negotiations; if we had accepted this they'd expect us to surrender to their demands in the serious negotiations. In any event, I don't think they expected us to accept this. This was likely the work of radical generals who wanted to ruin détente without seeming like warmongers."

"What brings you to our consulate this fine morning?"\n\n"Well," Kissinger said, settling down on his seat with a wan smile on his face. "The deal's no good, Mr. Takeuchi. You should've seen the President's face this morning. He did not like it." He put his hands together. "I can't sell this deal. Hawaii was already a bitterly won concession on our part; North Pacific and East Hawaii would be - pardon me for saying this - insane. No one would buy it"\n\nTakeuchi's face became serious. "Is the deal off, then?"\n\n"No, no," Kissinger waved his hand. "I come bearing compromises today. North Pacific and East Hawaii - that's out of question. The President made a counteroffer: we will recognize the de facto state of affairs in Hawaii, in exchange for adjustments in maritime borders. You give up a few miles, and we give up a few islands for now. Does that sound good?"\n\n"I can't answer that, Mr. Kissinger. It all depends on the Foreign Ministry back home."\n\nKissinger nodded and rose from his seat. "I understand, Mr. Takeuchi. Do inform me when you get a response. I am very interested in hearing more.""

The voice had a thick, gravelly German accent that sounded almost familiar. "2520 Massachusetts Avenue northwest." Randy shrugged. "Patching you through now," he said, around a mouthful of donut.\n\nHe sat back again, mind wandering to the latest Star Trek episode. Kirk and Uhura should be getting together soon, right?

We should have a response ready one way or the other." That accent- wait a minute, was that Japanese?\n\n"I'll look forwards to hearing about it," the German said. "I wish you good luck." The line went silent. Randy's mind raged. Germans and Japanese, skulking in the shadows of Washington? What were they planning? An evil plot to bring down freedom itself? He had to stop them! He had to- "Hey! Randy! Shift's done!" He got up, his replacement taking his seat.\n\nAs he walked home through Georgetown, what he'd heard run through his mind. Did he take this to the FBI? Did he take it on alone? It sounded complicated... and dangerous. After all, who knew how high up this went? He would do something, he knew..."

He and Kissinger had been hard at work hammering out the document detailing the transit question. Summarily told, it would be a watershed moment in the Pacific: a virtual détente between the two powers, with ships and trade proceeding with less restriction for the first time since 1941.\n\nTakeuchi anxiously awaited the cabinet's response in his office, signing documents and reviewing the events in his itinerary. Around the early evening, just as the diplomatic staff were about to close, his secretary announced that a telegram had arrived from Tokyo, wrapped in an envelope. He took it with him to the car.\n\nAs the automobile thrummed down the noisy streets of New York, he opened the message and read the letters lit by passing neon lights."

American ships will be allowed to freely travel through the territorial waters of the Sphere.\n\nHe hunched over his desk, writing out a coded message to Hart. It was excellent news. A whole sector of the world economy, open to American transit. Oh, the Nationalists might complain, but there was no way the American people would complain too hard once the economic boost started to kick in.\n\nHe felt an anxiety that he hadn't really acknowledged before fading. The Japanese generosity was a clear sign that they're as eager for détente as we are. As he raised a private toast to success, part of Kissinger found himself wondering what else he could ask for."

"The good news is that Tokyo has accepted much of what we wanted as regards transit rights through Sphere waters. The bad news is that this comes with certain... caveats. The Japanese want to keep restrictions in place on our shipping through the straits of Malacca- past Singapore, in other words."\n\nHart furrowed his brow. "Malacca? That would seriously limit the mobility of our shipping. We'd access the Pacific Rim but we'd still sail the long way to get to India."\n\n"They may simply wish to keep a monopoly over such an essential economic chokepoint," Kissinger said. "Or they may wish to keep Malacca as leverage in further negotiations. There's also the possibility that these restrictions were mandated by radical figures seeking to deny us total victory. In any event, we have several options for how to proceed. Acceptance would show the Japanese our good faith, but our economic gain probably won't be as strong as you had hoped. We could also, of course, press for the Japanese to accept our original offer, though Tokyo is unlikely to take this well."\n\nHart sat back in his chair, weighing his options. A deal with the Japanese was always going to be controversial; he'd been counting on the economic benefits of opening half the world to American shipping to offset this. But if Malacca remained closed... he was hardly an expert on the dynamics of international trade, but he couldn't imagine the benefits would be nearly as high. He massaged his temples. Why couldn't these things ever be easy?"

But now, with the negotiations a success and the first treaty between the US and the Empire since the Akagi Accords on the cusp of being introduced, Kissinger wanted to send a message. So he and Takeuchi sat in the Sans Souci, the most exclusive restaurant for the American elite. The feeling of the eyes of Congressmen and lobbyists on the pair made their victory all the sweeter.\n\n"It has truly been an honor working with you," Takeuchi said, cutting another piece off his steak. "That there are men of good sense in the United States who see the bigger picture gives me hope that a world where our two countries are not enemies is in the future."\n\nMaybe Kissinger, awash with newfound glory, was simply reaching out for more. Maybe he worried that the US needed another concession from Tokyo to pass the coming treaty through Congress. Or, maybe, it was simply the wine talking. Whatever his reasons, he leaned towards the Ambassador, keeping his voice low. "There was actually one more thing I wanted to put to you. Since the end of the war a great many Americans have been left on Hawaii, as I'm sure you know. Japanese law has left them effectively stranded there, kept as second class citizens and unable to even visit their loved ones in their home country. This issue is a particular point of resentment for many Americans as regards the Empire; I think that its resolution would do much for détente."\n\nTakeuchi leaned back in his chair, lips pursed. "I am certainly not unsympathetic to the plight of Americans in Hawaii," he said after a beat. "And I do see the rationale. I must warn you, however: elements in my country would not be pleased with such a measure; they would view it as a security risk.

Simply put, the Hart administration proposes for American citizens currently residing in Hawaii be given leave to travel to the rest of the United States.\n\nAccepting this suggestion might pose a security risk. Our colleagues in the military would not be as thrilled as the diplomatic corps regarding this issue, and may demand us to cut off the talks.

Kissinger set the phone down, leaning back in his chair. The Japanese refused the easing of transit restrictions from Hawaii. At the very least, they still wanted to push for the original deal- and Kissinger saw now reason to deny them. He sighed as he looked up at his hotel room's ceiling.

The treaty has been drafted; it covers topics as diverse as fishing rights, zones of transit, and the recognition of some of Japan's imperial conquests. If signed it will mark a turning point in Japanese-American relations... but it is also sure to inspire a backlash from those who have still not forgotten the War in the Pacific.

"The Prime Minister, having looked over the treaty in its entirety, has decided that it on the whole is not desirable for Japan." Kissinger almost spat. "How interesting," he snarled. "As I recall the Prime Minister received each of the treaty's individual provisions with quite a bit of enthusiasm."\n\nTakeuchi raised a hand. "I did voice quite a similar line of argument to the Prime Minister. He found it... unconvincing." The two sat in silence, the weight of that sentence sinking in. "In spite of its unfortunate ending, I did find it a pleasure working with you," Takeuchi eventually volunteered. "If any further opportunities arise for American-Japanese cooperation..."\n\n"Yes. Of course." Kissinger nodded. "It was a pleasure working with you as well."

Although the Executive Branch has signed the Treaty, it must now go to the Senate for ratification.\n\nAs can be expected for a treaty with one of America's greatest enemies, this has become a controversial issue. Progressive Senator Henry M.

Voices in support of the Administration, such as Senate Majority Leader Hubert Humphrey, argue that the Treaty will bring economic prosperity to the United States and cool tensions in the Pacific.\n\nDespite the objections of some extreme hawks, the Treaty on the whole has proven to be incredibly popular with the American people. According to our polls its provisions are recognized as clearly benefiting the United States, and Americans seem receptive to the President's proclamations that it will start to right the wrongs of the Pacific War.

Whatever else he might be Doctor Kissinger is no fool. But, Mr. President, I urge you not to conduct secret negotiations like this. This will be controversial even as a success.

But I understand that, after some of the things we did, your countrymen may not see it that way."\n\nKissinger snorted. "You are kinder to them than I. History is full of countries that have fought wars. There was never a reason that business in the Pacific should have made us enemies forever. Did Austria and Prussia let the Seven Years War interfere with the fight against Bonaparte? But this... such a rejection...

They slid from program to program, advertisement to advertisement, bits of music, and miscellaneous news from across the country. The staff settled on NBC and waited.\n\nJust before noon, the Senate gathered for the vote. The numbers on the monochrome screen showed the Ayes and Nays; as the event proceeded, the gradual realization crushed the hopes of the staff. When the Nays reached a majority, a weary sigh heaved the room. All those months of work, of clandestine meetings, faded to dust before their eyes. As the staff drifted back to their cubicles, many grumbled. "The Americans are too fickle, too prone to changing their minds." "This is just like the League of Nations all over again." "There goes the opportunity for peace."\n\nTakeuchi returned to his office, disappointment knitting his eyebrows. When Kissinger called, he could only manage platitudes.

"The staff didn't really catch it until the very end."\n\n"Well, another lesson for you," Takeuchi threw the butt of his cigarette and ground it on the pavement.

I mean," Mori blinked, "it's the only thing to do in the evenings here."\n\n"Catch a news broadcast and see how they respond to scandals. Hysteria. The treaty would've been sunk sooner by their bloodthirsty public than by our colleagues in the military."\n\n"That may be so, but..."\n\nTakeuchi cut him off.

But the work was important- as his advisor never seemed to miss a chance to remind him. "Our successes henceforth have of course been impressive, but their cumulative effect has been little more than the laying of groundwork." He spoke as if the leader of the free world was just another college student. "If we're to transform that groundwork into real geopolitical advantage, our task is to build towards cooperation against the influence of Germania."\n\n"Cooperation? With the people who destroyed Pearl Harbor?" Hart rose his eyebrows. Kissinger shrugged. "We will not call it that, of course. We will agree merely to scale down military activity in our areas of conflict. That, of course, will then free up our resources to push at the frontiers of the Einheitspakt. Of course, none will call it cooperation, but that is what it will be. The Germans will be unable to compete with the military and economic might of 2/3rds of the world. With your permission, I'll begin discussing next steps with Ambassador Takeuchi."\n\nWhat he was saying made sense, of course. It always did. But Hart didn't need to ask what more détente would mean. More secret meetings, more risk every day of a scandal that would destroy it all. And all spearheaded by a man who saw nothing wrong with lying, who, Hart was beginning to feel, would be more comfortable bowing to an Emperor than sitting across from a representative of the people.

The car turned off Wisconsin and came to a stop in front of a pleasant looking house, its bricks painted white. He dashed up the steps two at a time, knocking on the door.\n\nKissinger ushered the Ambassador inside; they sat across from each other, on the plush sofas of his living room. "You like French?" Kissinger asked; without waiting for an answer, his cook set down a roast duck in front of each of them. They spoke as they ate; Takeuchi had to admit that it really was quite good. "There are some difficulties with certain factions in the Empire," he said between sips of wine, "but my government has endorsed this initiative going further. If I may, I think our next step should be moving to a treaty to further reduce tensions in the areas where our spheres of influence clash.

Tokyo and Washington's relations should not terminate in the other's defeat: the United States and the Empire are vital components of the world order, however opposed we are to them and vice-versa.\n\nThough the ultimate decision still rests with the Prime Minister, the course of action I would recommend would be to hear the Americans out, and then decide.

But they weren't paying attention to that- only the abstract world of geopolitics remained. "The goal needs to be cutting down on military conflict as far as possible," Kissinger said, jabbing down at a wine cork that had been designated as Hawaii. "We need limits on military assets in the region put into writing. That's the only way either side can be sure."\n\n"That doesn't go far enough, in my opinion," Takeuchi said, gesturing vaguely at where Southeast Asia would be. "It's not our planes, ships, or missiles that we use in conflict, but our proxies. I can tell you that my government is much less worried about your Enterprises and Phantoms in the Pacific than it is about the AR-15s that we keep finding with terrorist groups from Manchukuo to Indonesia!"\n\n"And I could easily say the same about your friends in Cameroon and Jamaica." Kissinger gave a dismissive wave of his hand. "It's of no concern. We're both working towards the goal of ending German expansionism. I am sure that in more proper negotiations we can discuss these matters further."\n\n"On that note," Takeuchi said, "my government has authorized me to invite you to Tokyo for the next round of negotiations.

He- along with Winston Lord, a representative from the State Department, and two very confused and nervous secret service men- boarded Mexico's Presidential plane, and within a few hours were over the Pacific. Kissinger looked down at the waves, reviewed his notes, and even managed to catch some sleep.\n\nThe cityscape of Tokyo- stretching out into apparent infinity- greeted the Americans as they entered Japanese airspace. There was not much fanfare greeting the arrival of the first American diplomatic mission to Japan since 1941; when Kissinger and his entourage stepped off the plane they were greeted by Ambassador Takeuchi flanked by some government officials. Takeuchi shook his hand, and they exchanged pleasantries, before the Ambassador pointed to a limousine. Kissinger ducked in. The curtains were drawn.\n\nNone of them- not Kissinger, not Lord, and certainly not the long-suffering men of the Secret Service- said anything as the limo sped into Tokyo. None of them needed to. It was clear what was at stake; diplomacy had taken them this far, to the heart of the Japanese Empire. They had the support of the President. If diplomacy faltered here, it was on them.\n\nThe limo pulled up to an art deco mansion near the Diet- the Prime Minister's residence, Kissinger knew. A pair of guards opened the limo doors, snapping to attention as the Americans climbed out. In the back of his mind, the mansion looming over him, Kissinger reflected that he could get used to this sort of treatment. He turned to Winston Lord."

When the interpreter put those words to Japanese, the Prime Minister gave a light chuckle.\n\n"So, what does the President's National Security Advisor desire of the Empire?"\n\n"Right, yes. I believe that we are similarly appraised to the nature of nuclear weapons. America lost the race, but we've caught up since then. What I-" Kissinger halted, correcting himself.

 hart.kissinger.starlight.214.desc: "Kissinger sat on a couch in a guest room in the Prime Minister's residence. His eyes, somehow still open despite, at best, four hours of sleep, scanned the note, processing each point in turn. Both sides would commit to scaling down their forces in the Asia-Pacific region. Both sides would undertake a "gentlemen's agreement" to avoid militarily intervening in proxy wars against one another, and to mutually focus on rolling back German influence. But that wasn't all.\n\n"It's a creative solution, I must give them credit," Kissinger said as he handed the note to Winston Lord. "They know we could never openly concede the influence in the Pacific we've won in our proxy wars back to the Sphere, so they skip right to the informal solution. Allow their Zaibatsu back in and they can gradually reclaim control of all the countries we've lost influence in without anyone but the beltway insiders knowing or caring. And besides, what would we really be conceding? We're normalizing relations anyway; we'd have access to those markets.""It's an elegant solution, on paper," Lord said. "I'm just not so sure about in practice. They're asking us to give up what American boys have fought and bled for. And maybe the public won't pick up on this, but Congress? Getting the votes to pass this will be a real battle. Jackson, Kirkpatrick... they'll be working against this with everything they have."\n\nKissinger waved his hand. "We'll get them to fall in line. We'll just write the treaty so they look ridiculous if they try to tell the public what this means. It will only come into effect ten years on, and no one will care by then." Lord fidgeted in his seat. "It's, ah, not just Jackson or Kirkpatrick I'm worried about. What we're trying to do won't be popular with everyone who knows about it. I'm only worried someone will have a misguided belief about what their patriotic duty is. If this gets out, it'll ruin the President. It'll ruin the Party. And then all of this is gone, totally discredited." Kissinger bit back a promise about clamping down on leaks; he knew it would sound hollow. Lord was right. They could never be sure. But if they turned back now, détente would be incomplete."

Each day, Kissinger and Lord had gotten up at the crack of dawn, jet-lagged and tired, to sit across a table in a large room with the Japanese. And each day ended with a successful conclusion feeling more out of reach than ever. They argued over minute details, going in circles as the Japanese refused to concede on anything. At one point, a man in a particularly well-adorned uniform, the representative of the IJA, stormed out of the room.\n\nAs he squinted through his window at yet another Japanese sunset, Kissinger deflated. He didn't want it to be this way. He'd come so far. But the geopolitical situation would not be aided by useless obstinacy. He turned to Lord, still poring over notes like the studious soldier he was. "It's finished. This was hopeless from the start."\n\nLord looked up, a mix of surprise and what Kissigner darkly thought to be relief on his face. "Hopeless? But they invited us here; surely there's room for agreement?"\n\n"Takeuchi wanted to push détente, and his government was willing to humor him," Kissinger said. "But there's too much institutional distrust of us for progress to happen. Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia- previous administrations pushed them too far back, took too much of their empire, for them to be able to make the kinds of concessions we need now." He pushed himself up from his chair. "It was a poisoned chalice. There's nothing to be done. I'll convey my regrets to the Ambassador and we'll be on our way.""

There would be nuclear withdrawals in the Pacific, and a commitment to non-interference in spheres of influence. He looked up at Kissinger, sitting across from him in the Oval Office. "How are spheres of influence defined, exactly?"\n\n"It's in Article 7, Section 4-C," Kissinger said in a sentence that had been quite clearly rehearsed. "The current Co-Prosperity Sphere, plus the Pacific west of Hawaii and the Indian Ocean, is their area of influence. The entire Western Hemisphere is ours, plus Western Africa. The rest is fair game."\n\nHart stroked his chin. "So we're free to compete with them in some areas, but our essential interests are off limits. And you believe that the Japanese will use this reprieve to focus on the Germans?"\n\n"The Japanese are rational people, Mr. President," Kissinger said. "They would not rule Asia if they were not. They've sacrificed, if anything, more than we have to get this document here. Believe me, they would not be enraging the better part of their own general staff if they didn't intend to follow through."\n\n"It's a good deal, Henry. You've done well." Hart looked back down at the treaty. "I just don't know if America will agree." His mind wandered to the bigger picture. Civil rights, healthcare, urban development... there was so much to fight for.

Jackson's voice echoed through the Senate floor; Hubert Humphrey winced as it rang in his ears. Of course, he'd been expecting a treaty of détente with America's most hated enemy in its history to cause fierce opposition, but that didn't mean he had to like it.\n\n"Look, Bill," he whispered into the ear of J. William Fulbright, the Nationalist Senator from Arkansas. "I know you and this Administration have some disagreements on the issue of civil rights. But I also know you're an honorable man, committed to a more peaceful world. And that's what this Détente will achieve. We would never make friends with Japan. We just don't think the best way to work against their influence is American boys dying in every jungle with a few rebellious peasants. With free trade and open markets we can steal the Sphere out from under them- and that's what this Détente lets us do."\n\nFulbright shifted in his seat, adjusting his glasses. "I certainly see the logic in what you're saying, Hubert," he said. "I just don't know if it's a move I can make right now. Strom's been carrying on about this whole affair in front of the whole country. If I go against it I'm just asking to get myself primaried by one of Schlafly's crazies." Humphrey leaned in, elbows on his knees. "Bill, believe me. If you take this risk, the Administration won't be forgetting it. I'm sure I can put a good word in to the President for some extra funding for the Fulbright Program. Especially with an entire third of the world getting more friendly to Americans thanks to this treaty."\n\nFulbright nodded slowly. "That would be very generous of the President. I appreciate that this Administration is willing to cross party lines for the good of the country." A few more pleasantries, and Humphrey was on his way again, Scoop Jackson's speech still thundering through the Capitol."

It was thought that Dr. Henry Kissinger and Japanese Ambassador Takeuchi had reached an accord, but it seems as if this was not to be. Experts suggest that jingoistic factions in the Empire, most prominently the Imperial Japanese Army, managed to quash any talk of détente with the United States.\n\nThe reaction from the Hart Administration has been one of outrage. Secretary of State Truman has decried this "reckless disregard for peace" and called for continued readiness against the Japanese threat. President Hart has echoed these sentiments in a recent press conference. Dr. Kissinger himself was unavailable for comment. It's unclear what the future holds, but, for now at least, the Pacific seems doomed to continue to burn with war."

But instead of celebrations, he'd had to deal with a Secretary of State who felt locked out of the loop of one of the most important negotiations of his Presidency. And Hart couldn't really disagree. He picked the phone back up. "Get me Dr. Kissinger."\n\nHart normally would have greeted Kissinger with some form of pleasantries; not today. "Harry Truman wants to know how long we'll be conducting diplomacy in the shadows," Hart said as soon as Kissinger closed the doors. For a split second Kissinger looked startled; then he straightened himself, meeting Hart's stare. "With all due respect, Mr. President, what is it that you want me to say? I have laid out my reasoning for secrecy. Secretary Truman has laid out his for openness. I see little reason to relitigate these arguments, particularly in light of the demonstrable success of my approach."\n\n"Your approach has this cabinet at each other's throat!" Hart almost shouted. Kissinger gave an infuriating shrug. "Fine then. Listen to Secretary Truman. Abandon all that we have done and return to floundering wildly in a tripolar world."\n\n"I understand the realities of this world perfectly well, Dr. Kissinger," Hart said, a snarling emphasis on the other man's formal title as he leaned forwards. "I also understand that Secretary Truman has been serving this country since before you were born. He is entitled to more regard than we've shown him."\n\nKissinger let out a cruel, barking laugh. "Regard? You talk of regard? What of regard for the tens of millions in the mass graves littering Europe because of nazi madness? I think they deserve more regard than the bruised ego of a doddering old man. If Truman wants to moralize, he can do so to my face." He turned; when he reached the door he gave Hart a nod.

"I'm sorry we couldn't get this treaty passed."\n\n"So am I, Mr. President," Kissinger said. "That's what I'm here about." He handed Hart a letter. "It has been a true honor serving this country. But it's clear the American people are not ready for this Administration's foreign policy agenda. As such I think it best to step out from the limelight at this time."\n\nHart suppressed a sigh.

He did hope that this one went well.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kissinger was sitting down for an interview with the Washington Post. Several papers had approached him, actually. It was only natural; he had, after all, done the impossible. He had scrubbed over the scars of the Pacific War with the power of diplomacy, and the whole nation waited with bated breath to hear how he had done it. And Kissinger was delighted to tell them.\n\nOn Wednesday, he was appearing on Meet the Press. It was for the 1972 election, of course; the President wanted to remind everyone of the accomplishments of his Administration. Accomplishments, of course, that Kissinger had masterminded. He was, of course, happy to play his part- as long as he was properly acknowledged.\n\nIt wasn't even all the news appearances. When he walked through the streets of Washington, people's heads turned and followed him. At one point, some lesser specimen of the American people even approached him, screaming some obscenities similar to those Kissinger had heard in his childhood in Germany.

Perhaps he would be finding himself in the White House more often as the two countries grew closer together.\n\n"Ambassador, welcome."

It is an astounding proposal, having known that the OFN and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere have come to conflict many times over the past decade, and it is at this point that we should consider the limits of our relationship with the United States.\n\nWhat the Americans want in return for such a seemingly-generous deal is unclear. I, however, will venture to give an educated guess. the Americans want their ports in California to return to their fold, reasoning that if the Empire could bask in the restoration of trade relations, they should equally be rewarded by the return of American territory.\n\nIn light of this information, I place myself at the service of the Cabinet yet again, and trust in the colleagues to make the right decision regarding all of this.\n\nSigned, Takeuchi Ryuji"

 hart.kissinger.twilight.101.desc: "SECRET/[?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]\nFROM R. JACKSON\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\nSUBJECT: OPERATION FAULKNER; RADIO FREE EUROPE\n\n1. CIA personnel in coordination with State have launched a new phase in the United States' efforts to combat German propaganda and promote democracy abroad. Radio Free Europe (RFE), via the cover organization known as the National Committee for a Free Europe, will advance American foreign policy by broadcasting pro-American radio transmissions into hostile territory, guaranteeing America's support among exile communities, and fostering contacts for future human intelligence operations.\n\n2. At the direction of the Deputy Director, Agency personnel acquired a transmitter base near Tirano, Italy and have begun work assembling broadcast staff. Initial broadcasts will be transmitted in German, Czech, and French with options for later expansion into Hungarian and Polish. Stories will seek to embarrass the German regime, with a first, planned exposé into German atrocities in occupied France.\n\n3. While occasionally informed by Agency intelligence, these stories will be developed with minimal supervision and rely on traditional journalistic methods. This approach will promote the notion that stories emerged organically and legitimize exiles, defectors, and journalists in the eyes of intellectuals and Germans living abroad. Bluntly, German listeners will be more likely to accept German journalists reporting stories of their own volition than American stories planted by American operatives.\n\n4. It is highly likely that journalists operating in service of RFE will reveal critical assets within Germany and outside it. Agency handlers will regularly review RFE publications and, where relevant, make contact with sources."

Radio Free Europe (RFE) has proven a remarkable success in a very short period of operation. Initial broadcasts have had remarkably deep penetration in a short period of time, reaching an estimated 12-15 million in Germany and an additional 20-35 million from the surrounding region. Agency personnel have, on the basis of these estimates, expanded operation funding to support RFE's efforts to evade German jamming efforts.\n\n2. Intercepted signals from the German spy agency [GER.getIntelAgency] suggest that RFE broadcasts have alarmed senior German leadership. These leaders view the broadcasts as a potential destabilizing factor, demoralizing the public and exacerbating tensions with constituent members of the German Pakt. Reports on the situation in occupied France have been designated as a grave threat to national security and an embarrassment to the government.\n\n3. Jamming transmitters have subsequently been erected near the border at great cost to the [GER.getIntelAgency]. These efforts have temporarily reduced the quality of transmissions and limited their range but are not insurmountable by boosting the power of the main signal, transmitting on other frequencies, and erecting additional transmission sites. Agency staff have been deployed to assist in this and to assess the feasibility of expanding into printed works.\n\n4. For the time being, the Agency will continue its policy of giving RFE journalists the freedom to pick broadcast stories. Following its reporting series on occupied France, leadership plans to broadcast the contents of some 200,000 personal messages from refugees displaced from Eastern Europe. Agency staff will assist in assembling these letters."

Based on the success of Radio Free Europe (RFE) in undermining German cohesion, Agency personnel have expanded efforts to distort the German information ecosystem. This work primarily involves circulating dissident pamphlets, books, and other resources. The Agency is assessing a request from Congress to make direct contact with these figures and provide direct financing for sympathetic dissidents.\n\n2. Aggressive German censorship laws have produced a large demand for black market materials. These figures come from across the political spectrum broadly united in seeing an end to the current German government (see Addenda on VON DONHOFF, GRASS). While US interests may align with many of these figures in the short term, there is great concern among US political leadership that treating all voices as equal risks elevating figures hostile to US interests.\n\n3. Senior House leaders have suggested that the United States could promote democratization and liberalization in Germany by providing direct financial support to sympathetic dissidents. Members have argued for the Agency to make direct contact with writers, artists, and other intellectuals and provide financing for their works. Several others have suggested that the US provide more overt direction and political guidance to these leaders.\n\n4. We assess a high risk in such an engagement to Agency staff, to the dissidents in question, and to US interests in Germany. Field staff express additional concern that exposure could lead to substantial blowback throughout the region. However, operational success may lead to additional opportunities and weaken the government."

With the approval of political leadership, Agency personnel proceeded with its effort to make contact with pro-American dissident leaders and provide them with financial support. This memorandum serves to briefly outline the reasons for this mission's catastrophic failure, which resulted in the deaths of two agents in the field, the arrest of several local leaders, and significant reputational damage to the United States abroad.\n\n2. Relying on tips provided by journalists at RFE, agents crossed the border and traveled to Munich. There, agents made contact with R., a 25-year-old poet connected to Studentenbewegung, the German youth radical movement. Field reports suggest that agents believed R. could help build a network of pro-American intellectuals in the underground and provided him XXXXX RM to assist in this effort. R. introduced agents to several sympathetic local leaders and promised to make contact in several days.\n\n3. It is now believed that, instead of using these finances to support the underground press, R. immediately left Munich and attempted to flee the country with several women (see Addendum 1). R. was subsequently arrested attempting to bribe a border guard. Given known practices of the German security forces, it is highly likely he was tortured, after which he revealed his contacts with agents in the field. Whereabouts of R. are unknown.\n\n4. German authorities subsequently arrived in Munich where they arrested R.'s associates. After a brief confrontation in a local bar, both agents are believed to have been killed along with one civilian woman. The bodies of the agents have not been recovered.\n\n5. German officials have attempted to use this operation to discredit US officials in the press.

Maintaining this operation has yielded mild changes in the information ecosystem in Germany. They have also had the unexpected benefit of bolstering intelligence collection and further bolstering the success of Radio Free Europe (RFE) activities outside Germany.\n\n2. By focusing primarily on information gathering, Agency personnel have identified new sources of information on activities in the German government. Analysts have also identified several credible writers—writing under pseudonyms—who appear to be astute political observers of the domestic situation. Information from these parties will likely bolster the accuracy of intelligence assessments.\n\n3. In addition, information gathered and shared with RFE journalists has improved the quality of RFE broadcasts. Information from dissident press has been translated and disseminated to listeners in France, Italy, England, Iberia, and Scandinavia. These transmissions have had a small but vital role in turning public opinion against Germany and exposing fissures within German society.\n\n4.

CIA personnel have intercepted signals indicating that a senior military attaché in the Office of the Führer is a member of several underground homosexual organizations in Berlin. Given an assessment of the subject's personality, the prominence of the attaché's family, and the illegality of deviant sexual conduct in Germany, it is highly likely that this information could be used to extract critical information about German military and intelligence activity. At the President's directions, agency personnel will move immediately to act on this rare opportunity.\n\n2. The subject of operations, referred to in this memo as R.A., is the son of a prominent general and graduate of the highly selective Staff College in Berlin. He is 34 years of age and described by sources as professionally competent and of moderate intelligence, albeit with a sentimental nature. Rumors of his homosexuality have persisted among officers for some time but was only recently confirmed following an intercepted phone conversation between R.A. and a suspected sexual partner (see Addendum).\n\n3. Field agents subsequently followed R.A. Staff observed him entering a state-approved church known as a gathering place for people of the homosexual lifestyle. The subject left the church with a man and returned to his personal apartment where he was subsequently photographed by field agents in a compromising position. Additional sound recordings were also obtained.\n\n4. Using this gathered information, agents in the field will make direct contact with R.A. on his way to the aforementioned church. Agents will show R.A. the information obtained and indicate that they will release it unless R.A. can provide assets from the Führer's office. Threats against other members of R.A.'s homosexual circle have been authorized. Staff will provide an update to the President's staff once contact has been made."

After gathering compromising information about the deviant sexual activity of a senior German military attaché (herein referred to as R.A.), Agency operatives made contact. Agents provided R.A. with copies of photos and recordings of his sexual activities. Agents indicated that they would share the information with the German police and his superiors in the Führer's office unless he became a source for US intelligence operations.\n\n2. Though R.A. has exhibited severe emotional distress that calls into question the long-term viability of this operation, the subject has agreed to cooperate. Agents have learned significant information about the inner-workings of the Führer's office as well as the existence of several, previously undisclosed operations planned by the German military. This HUMINT is highly likely to aid future US intelligence and counterintelligence operations.\n\n3. Given the value of the information provided by R.A. and the unlikeliness of this relationship being sustained long-term, agents were authorized to escalate threats to secure physical documents. Agency personnel threatened to reveal R.A.'s sexual partners as well as his personal contacts in the homosexual underground to the German police. Personnel further emphasized the risk that R.A.'s actions posed to R.A.'s family. Though these threats have resulted in one (1) unsuccessful suicide attempt, they have otherwise proven successful in extracting key sources.\n\n4. Personnel will maintain and, if necessary, escalate threats to ensure the continued flow of information. We assess that this operation can be sustained three months before exposure."

 hart.kissinger.twilight.203.desc: "TOP SECRET/[?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]\nFROM R. JACKSON\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\nSUBJECT: OPERATION NIGHTHAWK\n\n1. Agency personnel have gathered vital intelligence from a senior military attaché (herein referred to as R.A.) within the German government. This information has been extracted using a variety of threats to R.A., a homosexual, and his partners and associates in the German underground. His deteriorating psychological state aside, R.A. is among the most significant intelligence sources that the Agency has secured since the end of WW2.\n\n2. The exposure of several German operations has resulted in increasing suspicion within the upper echelons of the German government of a "mole." Intercepted signals suggest that the German spy agency [GER.getIntelAgency] has been engaged in an internal investigation of the Führer's office. At the direction of the Führer's Office, the German spy agency [GER.getIntelAgency] conducted an internal investigation. If they have not already identified R.A. as the source, it is highly likely that they will do so imminently.\n\n3. Agency personnel have assessed two options available to the EOP. First, Agency staff could attempt to extract R.A. A successful operation could be useful propaganda for the United States. However, the intelligence value of this operation would be minimal and any effort would present a high risk to US personnel. Agency staff recommend against this operation.\n\n4. Second, Agency personnel could sever all contact with R.A. and focus efforts on covering their own tracks. This operation would promote the safety and security of current US personnel. While German sources may attempt to interrogate R.A., devoting US efforts to covering up its activities means that any insights gathered would be minimal. Agency staff recommend this operation."

This memorandum serves to briefly outline the reasons for this mission's catastrophic failure, which resulted in the capture of the source and a civilian, the exposure of several American trainers and case officers, and the seizure of a safehouse.\n\n2. Agents made contact with R.A. After informing R.A. of his imminent exposure, agents took him to a car acquired by the Agency and told him to drive as quickly as he could to the Swiss border, where he would be assisted by a second set of operatives at a US safehouse. Instead of heading directly to the border, it is now believed R.A. made a stop at the residence of a sexual partner in a fruitless attempt to "rescue" them.\n\n3. During the detour to the aforementioned partner's residence, R.A. was discovered by [GER.getIntelAgency] officials. The German spy agency subsequently tracked R.A. across the country, until his arrival at the Agency-held safehouse. There, [GER.getIntelAgency] operatives mobilized to seize R.A. and present Agency personnel. Agency personnel were able to escape through a nearby alley but were not able to destroy classified material held at the safehouse in time. In addition to this loss, it is believed R.A. was interrogated and revealed the details of his handlers and activities over the prior months.\n\n4.

Over the course of several days, US personnel extracted Agency personnel, destroyed documents and case files, and liquidated other assets present in Germania.

Based on publicly available sources, it is believed that, after Agency personnel failed to appear at a regular meeting, R.A. realized his imminent exposure. Emotionally agitated, R.A. used a pistol in his possession to fire a bullet through his temple. The loud gunshot alerted a neighbor who contacted the authorities and attempted to save R.A.'s life. This attempt was unsuccessful. No note has been reported.\n\n4.

 hart.kissinger.sunset.1.desc: "An entire day of working meetings, droning briefings, and mind-numbing reiterations of previous policy had taken a toll on President Philip Hart, and he was ready to call it quits. The day's final meeting had been between Hart and his National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, to discuss diplomatic protocols, a topic both were more than happy to put aside. As President Hart slung his coat over his shoulder, Dr. Kissinger did something unexpected. Instead of leaving promptly, he approached the President's desk and asked, "Mr. President, would mind if I walked you to your residence?"\n\nA brief shock came and passed for the President, who quickly returned in the affirmative. He didn't mind, but the walk wasn't terribly long. Kissinger replied, "I don't care about the walk," and the two started.\n\n"What I really care about," leaned Kissinger, "is Germany. We cannot reason with them."\n\nHart's military service in the Second World War engendered enough disdain for the European superpower, but serving in the presidency galvanized these feelings to a new level. "We can isolate them. Cut them off until..." He stopped himself.\n\n"...until the regime collapses, surely. It is childish to fantasize that the government will up and vanish." Kissinger finished the President's abortive thought, and silence fell over the duo save for stridden clicking from their heels scuffing against paneled flooring. The alternative was doing nothing, which satisfied nobody, so the President felt obligated to act. "It'll happen, and it'll be my policy. We'll isolate the entire Pakt, issue unilateral sanctions put the squeeze on transnational businesses, and we'll do it quickly." The President beamed so brightly that Kissinger nearly found himself suck into the optimism, but he reneged.\n\n"We can build our grand coalition against revolutionary Germany, and we may succeed, but failure runs the risk of letting the public point fingers." The implication of Kissinger's words stung Hart, but he remained undeterred. They approached the oak doors that demarcated the residence from the entrance hall, and President Hart turned to face his company.\n\n"Henry," he started, "I will do wh-" Kissinger abruptly cut the President off with the wave of his hand. "I would stick to policy, Mr. President. Goodnight." And with that, the National Security Advisor turned his heel and walked away. All things considered, the President felt sick to his stomach."

 hart.kissinger.sunset.2.desc: "Despite what Dr. Kissinger might think on the subject, President Philip Hart enjoyed when few opportunities he had to collaborate with his Secretary of State on drafting legislation. On top of their history in the Senate, Hart admired Truman's cold-warrior attitudes interlaced with a deft understanding of politics on Capitol Hill. If anyone could find something wrong with an anti-Nazi embargo bill, it was Truman.\n\n"What do you think?" asked the President, who watched eagerly as Truman thumbed the bill's pages. After sufficient time for reading had passed, the aged Secretary of State laid the manilla envelope down flat and looked Hart in the eyes. "I think if Ike were here," he began, invoking Hart's wartime supreme commander and precursor as President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, "he would blush. This bill does the work and then some, and I think that's what we need." His fingers then crept back towards the envelope and withdrew the opening summary, which he re-read with glee. "Those Nazi sons of bitches'll hate this."\n\nFoul language aside, Philip Hart felt similar pride for the bill; if passed, it would be the most decisive act of legislation against Germany since Congress's declaration of war, and would isolate Germany's sphere from one of the world's largest markets. For that reason, Truman predicted massive support for the bill and offered his congratulations to the President ahead of time. "This embargo will save Europe," said Truman, whose excitement was contagious. After receiving the elder statesman's approval, the embargo bill was returned to its writers, briefly annotated, and officially placed for consideration."

 hart.kissinger.sunset.3.desc: "Since the end of the Second World War, the United States has skirted a line with Nazi Germany; diplomatic relations between the two countries were overwhelmingly hostile, but some silent connections had returned. Still, some pre-war business had returned, and the faltering power of the Reich engendered the nation for most Americans as a troublesome, if impotent, state across the ocean. However, this was no longer the 1950s, and sweeping reforms within the Reich meant the resigned colossus was regaining its footing quickly. To President Philip Hart, no time seemed more appropriate for decisive action.\n\nDecisive action, the President clarified, speaking pointedly into the television cameras, meant a unilateral, unambiguous embargo of all Unity Pakt nations. He was speaking to television sets across the country, framed between two free-standing American flags on either side of his Oval Office desk. "We must isolate Germany because it is the evilest nation in the world. If we continue to feed into their prosperity, which itself is built on the back of mass murder, then how can we call ourselves a freedom-loving people?"\n\n"This is a test not of our military alliances but rather an endorsement of morality and decency." The President paused briefly, suddenly frightful of the rhetorical leap his administration was about to make, but regained himself. "The German occupation reaches from the Atlantic coast into the Russian heartland and is sustained by suffering. Can we bear to see the day that certain peoples have simply ceased to exist outside of the United States?"\n\nPresident Hart sucked in some air and prepared for his crescendo. "Germany's hegemony in Europe was long-thought to be on the decline, but this isn't true. Instead, Germany is recovering from its slump and may again impose its terror upon the world. I say this to all like-minded nations of the world, democratic values and tolerance of Nazism are incompatible. Join the free world in condemning state terror and bringing justice to the imprisoned peoples of Europe. Thank you.""

Anything else, like Kissinger's sitting in on cabinet meetings, his large staff, and his prominent media presence, were entirely the invention of Dr. Kissinger himself. He liked the popularity and believed the publicity serves a political purpose, too: a well-respected, popular diplomat was much more successful than a bureaucratic nobody. In fact, Kissinger so emphatically believed in the utility of a celebrity statesman that a segment of his staff devoted part of their duties to monitoring the diplomat's public perception.\n\nThe curated bulk of various national newspapers arrived at the Kissinger office starting at seven in the morning and continued in a light stream until the delivery doors were locked for the evening. These newspapers were skimmed for a few keywords, their columns clipped and sorted, then delivered to Dr. Kissinger for his own reading. National publications ranged from neutrality to adoration of Kissinger, but the relationship strained in local papers. Some papers published genuine criticism of Kissinger's secretive negotiations and his amoral diplomacy, while others appealed to local ignorance and contempt. "Puppetmaster" and "conspiracy" jumped from the pages to irritate Kissinger, but his feelings remained opaque.\n\n"It isn't who I am," he would say, before disposing of the clippings, "so it doesn't bother me."

These societies represented ethnic Eastern Europeans and regional minority groups and successfully lobbied the Eisenhower and Kefauver administrations to grant exemptions to refugees. The overall total number of post-war refugees was low compared to pre-existing communities, but the public victories for these societies kickstarted their rise to political prominence.\n\nToday, organizations like the "Committee for a Free Eastern Europe" and "Baltic Freedom" continue to dot headlines for their political contributions and international advocacy. Each organization was different, however, and ideological leanings differed among them. Some, like the "Bukharin Society" and the "Free Lithuania Group," wore their convictions openly, while the "National Committee for Free Europe" remained dubiously associated with the CIA. It was a mixed bag, but the home-grown community organizations had evolved into an undeniably powerful segment of American politics and were sure to continue influencing affairs for years to come."

And they spoke for themselves. The Third Reich, the most dangerous regime in human history, would be cut off from vast segments of the world economy. They would be one step closer to the defeat they so richly deserved. And that was his triumph.\n\nKissinger approached Hart, after he had signed the bill for the cameras.

It was over.\n\nAs Kissinger reflected on the situation, he didn't know why he was surprised. Of course. Of course those weak-minded fools, who cared more about pandering to the idiocy of the American voter, were taken in by the honeyed words of Albert Speer. Speer, who had engineered the very economy that had enslaved Europe! Speer, who sat fat in his mansion off the labor of his victims. And the Congress of the United States could not see through the lies of such an obvious piece of pond scum.\n\nKissinger sighed. There was nothing for it.

 hart.flavor.1.t: "The New Face of the Administration"
 hart.flavor.1.desc: "Philip Hart always considered himself a good sport. At Georgetown, he'd endured a fair share of teasing about his Midwestern nasal. In the Senate too, he'd endured snide comments about his folksy demeanor. All of that, however, paled to the kind of abuse he now regularly received in the press.\n\n"A HAIRY SITUATION IN WASHINGTON," read one headline in the Style section of the New York Times above a picture of the President's unshaven face. He turned the page of his daily press clippings, only to see a cartoon version of himself on the cover of TIME. The cartoon Hart leered through a scraggly, unkempt beard surrounded by hippies flashing peace signs. Philip Hart closed the folder in disgust and pushed it across the dinner table.\n\n"Everything all right, Phil?" said Janey, eyebrows raised. The First Couple sat together at breakfast, plates in front of them.\n\n"I'm fine. It's..." He glowered at the folder, half-hoping it might somehow catch fire. "This beard. I thought I might change things up by not shaving for a few weeks and, hell, I don't know..."\n\n"Diana Vreeland at Vogue described it as very dashing. And besides, you've never been one to take fashion tips from the kinds of stuck-up fossils they employ at newspapers nowadays."\n\nPhilip scratched his beard. Janey was right but, still, he couldn't get the headlines out of his head. "Do you like it?"\n\nJaney looked up from her plate and stared at her husband for a long moment, inspecting him. Then she flashed her radiant smile. "I'll have to agree with Ms. Vreeland on this one, Phil. It really does suit you. It makes you look distinguished.""

They were quiet for a moment, then Chep broke the silence. "Aw hell, Phil, I can't take it any more. We have to talk about the beard."\n\nPhilip moved his mouth but the only thing he could muster was. "Excuse me?"\n\n"The beard. The goddamn beard. It's not that it looks bad, it's just that people have been talking. You know how they are," Chep threw up his hands and let them fall beside him. "They think it's unprofessional. It could hurt us in the midterms."\n\n"I hardly think that my beard is what the American people are voting—."\n\n"It shouldn't. It shouldn't, you're right, but the average voter isn't voting based on who passed what. Trust me when I said they're voting for whichever candidate has the best image. There's a reason I let the goddamn press take so many photos of me water-skiing or at the theater with Zsa Zsa." Chep sighed, as if remembering some painful, private sacrifice. "Most voters in this country are still trapped in the 1950s and they're not ready to accept a President with a beard."\n\nPhilip sat, gobsmacked. "I didn't know you felt so strongly."\n\n"I wish I didn't have to, Phil, I really don't. I just don't want us to leave anything to chance when there's so much at stake." Chep looked at him with a pleading expression. "It's your face. You do what you want. Just... promise me you'll think about it, okay? For the coalition?""

 hart.flavor.3.desc: "Philip Hart stood in front of his bathroom mirror with shaving cream and a razor in his hand.\n\n"Goddamn absurd," he muttered as he coated his face in cream. "Having to shave because some uptight reporters..." He glided the razor down his cheek, feeling months of scruff fall away. "...As if my face matters. As if I came to Washington to be Buddy Holly..."\n\nIt continued like this as hair filled the sink, as his mood continued to sour. After several minutes of quiet grumbling, Hart removed a hand towel from the bathroom wall and scrubbed at his skin. With the last of the cream removed, he looked at himself in the mirror. His face looked strange without the beard. It seemed to him shriveled, gaunt. He looked old.\n\nThe next day, Hart tried to move through the West Wing as if everything was normal, as if nothing had changed. Still, he could not avoid hearing the snap of the press's cameras. He could not help but see his aides do double takes as he walked by. Jane Jacobs, normally unflappable, had stopped frozen in her tracks as he passed. Even Chep, after pushing so hard, appeared slightly disheartened at the President's new appearance.\n\n"Well," said Chep at the start of a meeting, with a look of forced cheer on his face. "Good to finally see you again, Mr. President. I'd almost forgotten what you looked like under all that hair."\n\nHart smiled at the quip to disguise his deflating self-esteem. "You know, Chep, it's good to be back. Let's get to work."\n\nThe vice President gave Hart a sad smile and a sympathetic pat on the shoulder. Then, without acknowledging it again, they set about their business."

 hart.flavor.4.t: "Supreme Court Strikes Down Flag Burning Ban"
 hart.flavor.4.desc: "...in the latest news out of Washington, what has proven to be one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases in our nation's history has come to an end. The Supreme Court has decided that the burning of the US flag constitutes speech protected under the First Amendment, rendering any bans on flag burning unconstitutional.\n\nAcross the country, the reaction has been mixed. Conservative groups in both major parties have decried the move as yet another instance of judicial activism from a liberal dominated Court. Some, such as the Nationalist firebrand Phylis Schlafly, have gone even further, decrying the decision as "part of a Fascist plot to destroy the very soul of America."\n\nMany aligned with the current Administration, however, have applauded the move, considering it to be another victory in the struggle for free speech. The American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawsuit against the state of Texas began the court battle that resulted in this decision, has voiced its support, promising to continue the struggle for what it sees as essential liberties. The battle may have been won, but the culture war over reverence for the flag shows no sign of slowing."

 hart.flavor.10.desc: ""...now I know many parents are happy to turn their children's education over to the boob tube, Mr. Day, but clearly we must be doing something!"\n\nJames Day, network executive and founding father of PBS, hadn't expected he would one day be invited to the Oval Office, let alone hear the POTUS rant about the state of children's programming in America.\n\n"The next generation is spending what, an hour, two, even more a day rotting their brains with garbage, when they could be spending that time learning! How will we ever hope to compete with the Japanese when our kids are wasting their lives away!"\n\nPresident Hart shook his head.\n\nThat's why I brought you in here, Mr. Day. I've seen the proposals PBS has put forth for educational content targeted at pre-K children. They're all good, but perhaps we should be doing something for the older kids. I think that, if we developed engaging content for grade schoolers, we could turn television into another weapon in our battle for America's youth."\n\nHe paused, for effect.\n\n"What do you think, Mr. Day? Making television programming that teaches America's children science instead of wasting its time with Captain Kaboob and the Vixens of Venus or whatever nonsense is airing currently."\n\nDay nodded.\n\n"It's definitely an interesting proposal. Honestly, I'm flattered that you see all this potential in our work, Mr. President. I'll just need to think about it.""

 hart.flavor.11.desc: "The hallway of New York City's Oliver Cromwell hotel contained nondescript door upon door. Looking down its length, a person could not tell that behind one of them lived one of the most prolific and celebrated authors of the 20th century. Professor Isaac Asimov had just finished brewing his tea when he heard a knock upon his door. The executive was here.\n\nJames Day was quickly ushered in and brought to the dinner table. The Professor poured a cup for him and his guest before they started their discussion.\n\n"I suppose I wanted to begin by pointing out that I haven't written a single work of fiction in more than a decade. Of course, it's the last of those you're here for, aren't you?"\n\nJames Day chuckled. "Yeah. Lucky Starr. My boy Douglas loved those growing up."\n\nAsimov nodded before sighing.\n\n"To think that I spent all that effort trying to teach juveniles about our solar system only for the Mariner probes to overturn almost everything we knew about the planets only a few years later! Oceans on Venus... now just a fantasy."\n\nDay was about to speak, but Asimov interrupted him.\n\n"Your proposal of making a proper adaptation of Lucky Starr is flattering, but to be honest, I don't think the setting is the best for what you're doing. You want something more grounded, something more appropriate for the near future rather than 5,000 C.E. In the 50s, we could get away with writing about antigravity drives and subetheric communicators, but that won't pass for rocket science."\n\nHe spent a few minutes deep in thought, before an idea came to him.\n\n"Say... wasn't there a popular juvenile series that was adapted to television before? Yes, I remember. Tom Corbett, Space Ranger. All about a man like Lucky who flies around the solar system in an atomic rocket. Well, NASA's working on a nuclear rocket engine right now. Perhaps they would be interested in an advertisement.""

Day and Asimov sat across from the Associate Administrator of Education and his aide, a stack of papers dividing the two sides. The Administrator shuffled them before speaking.\n\n"I must admit, it is an honor to have the esteemed Professor Asimov sitting here. I commend you for your interest in bringing our work and our discoveries to a new audience, even if "Tom Corbett" isn't a name I've heard of in, well, quite a while..."\n\nHe trailed off, distracted by something, before returning to the topic at hand.\n\n"Gentlemen, I think a television production that bases itself off of real science is a brilliant and much-needed idea. With this, we can inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers. It could not only excite children about spaceflight, but serve as a, pardon the pun, launchpad for discussing other concepts - geology, evolution, even the origin of life. Some of us still think there may be microbes on Mars or deep in the ice layers of Europa, and even if the old visions of the solar system are no longer accurate, we can still make something out of it."\n\nHe paused, taking a sip of water from the glass in front of him. "There's just two suggestions I'd like to make: first, the budgetary limitations of a television show mean that the only way to do justice to the concept would be through the medium of animation. Second, you work with a production company that will have the resources and expertise necessary to bring it to life. For that NASA can recommend only one: the Walt Disney Company. If you convince them, then we'll be able to throw a million dollars or two your way.""

 hart.flavor.13.t: "To the Stars, Through the Mouse"
 hart.flavor.13.desc: "The expansive courtyard of Disney's studios in Burbank, California was the perfect place to take a walk in between shifts. For President of the company E. Cardon Walker, it was a good setting to meet with guests. Today, Day and Asimov accompanied him past the shrubberies that lined the courtyard. More than a decade ago, William Ley and Captain Robert Truax had walked among here for the production of three separate episodes of Disney's anthology television series that would cover the topic of manned and interplanetary spaceflight. With a viewership of millions, they had generated a wave of enthusiasm about space among the American public, something that would come in handy once the Germans launched the world's first satellite into orbit. Now, these visitors had brought forth the possibility of a successor to that production.\n\n"Did I ever tell you about the time Walt and Roy went down to Huntsville?" said Walker as he stopped and turned to face the visitors.\n\n"It was a warm day in April when they arrived at Marshall, greeted by that Russian scientist Glushko. Not only did they tour the facilities, but they even got a chance to try out the docking and lunar landing simulators. Wouldn't you know it, but Walt was better at piloting the LEM than many professional aviators!"\n\nWalker chuckled, a feeling of melancholy suddenly edging into his voice.\n\n"He really did care about it. Not just NASA or space, but science in general. The American spirit of innovation...," said Walker, trailing off.\n\n"If this goes through, it'll be up to you and us to continue his legacy. Those old space shorts were mighty expensive, but the promise of financial and technical support from NASA should be enough to convince the board."\n\nHe stuck his hand out, waiting for a handshake."

 hart.flavor.14.t: "Tom Corbett Flies Again"
 hart.flavor.14.desc: "In 1973, a new daring tale of peril and exploration in animated form graced the television screens of millions of Americans. Airing on NBC, the Adventures of Tom Corbett was a profound departure from the cheaply-made Saturday morning cartoons that viewers were accustomed to. Rooting itself in the cutting-edge of NASA's interplanetary ambitions, the show chronicled the intrepid 21st century space ranger Tom Corbett and his adventures across the solar system aboard his nuclear-thermal rocketship, the Polaris. Assisted by a diverse crew, Tom would thwart the schemes of evildoers while attempting to uncover the mysteries of life on alien worlds.\n\nMade to be enjoyed by children and adults alike, the show eschewed the outdated conceptions of space travel and the planets found in previous pulp science fiction, instead depicting the strange and hostile worlds uncovered by modern science in fascinating detail. The quest for lifeforms that could survive in the acidic clouds of Venus or beneath the ice caps of Europa was a common plot thread that elevated the show in the eyes of many.\n\nAt the time, it was thought that cartoons were a medium only fit for children. Despite that stigma, the Adventures of Tom Corbett managed to become a mainstream success, outcompeting the Star Trek Animated Series that was airing around the same time and becoming the number one space show in America. Its bold and distinctive vision of spaceflight would inspire an entire generation of children to follow in Tom's footsteps and reach for the stars."

 hart.misc.1.desc: "It was raining in Washington, pouring even. Standing beneath the tent on the Capitol's east portico, Philip Hart could barely make out the faces of the freezing, huddled people below. A haze hovered in the air.\n\nBut the President was determined not to let the weather get him down. It was good luck to have rain on your wedding day so perhaps it was good luck to have rain on your inauguration day too.\n\nPhilip Hart spoke at great lengths about the virtues of liberalism, about how he had sought to advance its ideals during his first term. Shouting over the storm, he celebrated the work of the Urban Renewal Initiative and the many men and women who had made it possible. He would go further and faster in his second term, he promised. He would make good on the promise of the American Dream and prove that the Republic still stood strong. No matter how many challenges America faced at home and abroad, there was no challenge that the people, united in purpose, could not overcome.\n\nThe President finished his remarks and, for the benefit of the dedicated crowd below, gave an awkward smile and wave. He felt his suit shift around him—little of his clothing had fit since he started cancer treatment—and expose part of his emaciated arm. He quickly moved to conceal it and gave a bright thumbs up to the faceless crowd. He hoped his enthusiasm could hide the signs of his illness, that no one noticed the thick make-up applied to his face.\n\nThrough the rain, there was a small cheer from the crowd. Philip Hart wobbled away from the podium and locked arms with his wife before retreating inside the Capitol."

 hart.misc.2.t: "Death of a Statesman"
 hart.misc.2.desc: ""Today," began Philip Hart, leaning into the lectern microphone, "we mourn the death of a statesman. A man whose guidance allowed this nation to recompose itself in the wake of defeat and take new posturing in world affairs. That there is even an Organization of Free Nations, we owe to the late Harry Truman." Putting these sentiments into words, the President couldn't help but feel how the old Harberdash had been sidelined in his administration. Pausing briefly, his eyes dashed between the bulbous television camera lenses peering at him.\n\n"He was a lifelong public servant, and his devotion to statecraft is felt in the mutual confidence enjoyed by the United States and its democratic partners worldwide. The world is a safer place thanks to Secretary Truman." The eulogy did not mention President Hart's part in deceiving his aged foreign minister, nor did it take responsibility for the factionalism that had wracked the State Department. Instead, the President held his lip and yielded to the presentation of one final insult: the Harry S. Truman Senate Office Building. So much for the legacy of a statesman.\n\nAfter delivering hollow closing remarks, Philip Hart retreated to the Oval Office, where the Vice President was waiting for him. "Those were some stirring remarks, I cou-" started Morrison, but the President gestured him for silence. "I undermined Harry," confessed Hart, who kept his eyes downcast. "I hoodwinked an elder statesman, and for the part of my accomplice, I am rewarding him with a promotion." Hart's revelation caught the Vice President off-guard, who, stupified, sputtered in his search for words, "You can't..." before settling into a long silence.\n\n"Chep, would you have done the same?" asked Hart."

While you are vacationing away inside, let our Washington man Ben Hasse clue you in on the storm in Washington instead. Ben?"\n\n"Thanks, Dave. Well, big news from the Beltway, today. As you may have already heard, the President announced his cancer diagnosis earlier this morning. We at Channel 8 News wish President Hart a speedy recovery, and we will make sure that the Hart family is in our prayers." A quiet second passes. "Not long after, Senator Edward Kennedy, to reporters outside the Capitol, said, "The President did great work, and I'm excited to carry on his legacy." Critics and opposing politicians have voiced their discontent with the Senator's remark, claiming it was disrespectful towards the President, implying that President Hart is now incapable of performing presidential duties. This is in addition to claims that this was an attempt to jump in front for the 1976 Democratic primaries."\n\n"In response to this backlash, Senator Kennedy put out a statement, saying he is "heartbroken and personally affected" by the President's cancer diagnosis, and that he should have responded with more tact..."\n\n"Thanks for the rundown, Ben. Y'know, aren't the President and Senator Kennedy friends? I thought they were. Maybe we're missing some context." said Dale Bentley, loosening his journalistic professionalism. He'd been in the business long enough to know that most people have stopped watching by now. "I believe they are, Dale. Regardless, you have to admit that this was a bit of a kerfuffle." A mildly tickled smile passes over the faces of the anchors. "I have heard rumors that the President laughed upon hearing about Kennedy's debacle, but I would refuse to report that as fact at this point. We will have to wait for some kind of statement."\n\n"Fair enough, Ben. To more light-hearted news, I believe Maureen has a special guest for us...""

 hart.misc.4.desc: "Senator Philip Aloysius Hart of Michigan was close to the end of his tether.\n\nIt had been mere days since information of Nixon's scandals and corruption caused his presidency to collapse amidst impeachment proceedings. "God, how it all infuriates me," Hart thought. "How avoidable it was, how pointless all this corruption turned out to be - if they wanted to ruin the NPP so badly, surely they could have done it through honest means."\n\nHonest means. That was another thing that Hart had always treasured as a senator. It was why the partly-admiring, partly-jealous congressmen and senators of the Capitol called him the "Conscience of the Senate". Wherever he went, he had striven towards honesty. He had fought hard and honestly on the ruined battlefields of Europe just as he now did in the Senate, not seeking advancement through corrupt means like the former President and so many others did.\n\nFor Philip Hart, therefore, this ruinous madness cut even more to the quick than it did others. "How in the good Lord's name will this American nation care for its people if the President cares only about himself? If this isn't a disaster, what on earth is it?"\n\nHart knew his tolerance was failing. It was only so long before he would have to do something more about all this, rather than settling for being the Capitol's morality pet."

The project will not move forward but may be re-proposed during the next session." The calm voice of the Speaker of the New York City Council barely registered before it was overwhelmed by cheers from the gallery. Greenwich Village inhabitants had packed the council room to pressure their representatives against the temptations of the developers' lobbying.\n\nAt the center of the celebration were Jane Jacobs and her Greenwich Village Civic Group volunteers, all devoted New Yorkers determined to keep their homes. This was not Jacobs' and the GVCG's first clash with development projects pushed by wealthy interests as they had already prevailed once before. Jacobs avoided words like "triumph" to describe their past success. What sort of victory was it to be allowed to keep your home?\n\nJacobs and her allies had marched, petitioned, protested and even organized the residents of every building on each affected block to pressure their council members and make their voices heard. Their small community of old homes from the 19th century had seemed quite the David to the developers' Goliath however the development plan's inclusion of a major road cutting through the heart of the community had united the locals.\n\nNow, the power-brokers of New York would retreat, regroup and rework their plans. The right pressure on the anti-development council members or the right carrots offered to key members of the community could see the project squeak through next time. Whatever came though, Jacobs and her neighbors would be there to meet it. After all, when someone comes to take your home, you fight."

 hart.misc.6.t: "The Hidden Lives of the Urban World"
 hart.misc.6.desc: "Philip Hart had rarely thought about sidewalks beyond whether or not streets had them and if they were paved correctly. He'd certainly never thought about what effect they had on social order. Yet the book he was reading, entitled 'The Death and Life of Great American Cities', and its author Jane Jacobs opened his eyes to urban matters he had never considered before, having previously considered cities merely agglomerations of people and concrete..\n\nJacobs claimed that sidewalks acted as the stage for an 'intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose an orderly whole.' It was through sidewalks that the urbanite interacted with the city around him, with the quality of the sidewalk entirely a function of what was attached to it, be it a store, subway station or park.\n\nEven more interesting was Jacobs's concept of walkable sidewalks helping to prevent crime. It is a fact, after all, that criminals are less inclined to operate when in view of the public. Rather than rely on continual police presence, Jacobs asked, why not instead encourage a degree of passive societal surveillance through promoting walkable cities and streets? Through ensuring buildings faced roads and a neighborhood had plenty of watchful, disapproving eyes discouraging any ne'er do-wells. Hart put the book down.\n\n\"Arthur? Please get in touch with Ms. Jane Jacobs of New York. Tell her I admire her struggles for her community and that I've been reading her book. If it's all right with her, I have quite a few questions about her ideas." The aide nodded and hurried off on the errand as Hart continued reading the book. He wanted to be prepared for his meeting with Ms. Jacobs, after all."

Zsa Zsa Gabor, the extravagant actress and socialite, crooned as she displayed her shining engagement and wedding rings to the attentive cameras and studio audience. The show host, a broad smile on his face, pretended to be interested. He had seen several wedding rings on Zsa Zsa over the years and showbusiness had made him cynical enough to doubt this relationship's longevity.\n\n"And this lucky fellow, deLesseps Morrison, tell us more about him," he said, the studio audience chuckling a little at the odd name of Zsa Zsa's beau.\n\n"Oh he's just perfect," Gabor said, her bright smile illuminating television screens nationwide, "He's my ideal man. He has brains and he gives me my space, but he's still tough and decisive. You don't become a governor through being just a pretty face, though he's out of office at the moment. He knows I should be free like a bird in the sky, not kept in some golden cage to be paraded about."\n\n"Well gosh, Zsa Zsa, it sounds like this marriage is an excellent fit for you," the host replied, his emphasis on 'this' drawing chuckles from the audience. They were familiar with Zsa Zsa's pattern and maybe this deLesseps Morrison would be the first to break it, but none of them would put any money on it.\n\n"Now, it certainly is the most wonderful thing," Zsa Zsa said, her eyes glinting with mirth, "And who knows? If things go wrong, perhaps I can add a governor's mansion to my collection. I am an excellent housekeeper after all." Laughter filled the studio as the audience recalled Zsa Zsa's string of favorable divorces, as well as imagining the actress pushing a former governor around."

"Well, how're we holding up on Capitol Hill?"\n\n"The Senate's still warming up to Chep as presiding officer," Humphrey chuckled. "Most of our caucus is falling in line, but our Republican friends need a fair bit of convincing."\n\n"Lyndon riding herd on them?" Hart asked.\n\n"Oh, you know it." Humphrey replied jovially. "I think they're more annoyed at you for beating Goldwater at the Convention than Barry is."\n\n"To used to throwing bombs, I'd imagine," replied the President. "Well, we need their votes. I've had three meetings with Jerry in the past week, and it feels like I'm pulling teeth.

 hart.misc.10.t: "Missouri Waltz"
 hart.misc.10.desc: "It had barely been a week since Philip Hart won the 1968 Presidential election, and already he was swamped with phone calls from coy well-wishers and party animals seeking one favor or another. Now that he was President-elect, many within ruling the coalition mistook friendship as an inroad to power, and casual conversations were now full of not-so-subtle insinuations.\n\n"Mr. Eastland told me about your trip..." Richard Russell tapered off through the phone receiver, and Hart hoped he'd finally hang up. Then, the Georgia Senator dipped into a low voice, and said, "By the way, Mr. President-elect, I thought I'd pass along my recommendation for Secretary of State." Philip palmed the phone and groaned. "Senator Truman is a party man," Russell continued, "and we know he's a fine statesman." Duly noted, thought Hart, who thanked the Senator for his call and hung up. No sooner had the call ended did the phone rattle again and, cursing his presidential ambitions, he snatched the receiver.\n\nAny anger faded when Hart heard his protege Ted Kennedy speaking through the wire, and he felt free to lament his frustrations about Russell's call. "It must be that Georgia water," quipped Kennedy, who giggled through the phone, "Atlanta's is a city of freaks." Their talk continued with critiques of Kennedy's policy, followed by honest heart-to-heart. Then, Ted erred and asked about cabinet appointments.\n\n"The State Department-" started Kennedy, but it was too late. Hart interjected, "Ted, I've decided on Harry Truman for State. I think you'll find that agreeable, won't you?" Hart couldn't believe it. Ted was his mentee; had the party gone so low as to recruit him for their pressure campaign, and had Kennedy been so unfaithful to accept the task?\n\nOblivious to tension across the phone, Kennedy huffed, "A shame, I was hoping for someone like Cyrus Vance, but Truman's fine too. A classic." Color flushed from Hart's face, and he stammered idly, embarrassed for having doubted Kennedy. The conversation recovered, however, and stress about phone calls faded as the two talked the night away."

In fact, their soldiers are very much human, beholden to the same inaccurate approximations and superstitions that befall any one of us. This fact, if used correctly at key points of stress, can allow us to defeat our foes without firing a single bullet."\n\nHart leaned back in his seat, his eyes locked on the speaker. Who was this man, and how had he wandered onto the Armed Service Committee? Most military leaders were subdued and serious, excepting LeMay and a few other isolated madmen. Yet this Lansdale fellow was animated and bright, waving his hands and leaning on his podium like a mix of mad scientist and magician. He was also clearly well-versed on his material—his notes painted a detailed, if imaginative, portrait of the German psyche and its precise points of attack.\n\nHis monologue ended once some general interrupted with some banal questions of procedure. Whatever conversation continued from there was not worth following - clearly, the generals just wanted to tie Lansdale down. Hart waited for the session to end before getting up to speak with the Major-General directly.\n\n"I really enjoyed your talk, General Lansdale. I think you've got a bright future ahead of you."\n\nLansdale seemed lost in thought. He kept his head down as he packed up his papers.

It was too fast for him, being whisked from the airport to each successive location at a disorienting pace. First, it was a luncheon with local unions and a speech. There followed a meeting (and speech) with urban activist Jane Jacobs, then a meeting with the press club before a final appearance outside the New York midtown Hilton. After delivering some impromptu public remarks, Senator Hart and his wife retreated into the welcoming safety of the hotel's ballroom and the party waiting inside. At long last, thought the beleaguered candidate, downtime. If only.\n\nAn hour of handshaking and personal politicking followed that rivaled the day's engagements for their tedium, pushing the candidate's public face to its limits. Then, two taps on Hart's shoulder. "Senator Hart," enquired someone from behind, "if I may steal you?" When he turned to again repeat the greeting cycle, he was shocked to see Nelson Rockefeller extending his hand. Furthermore, the Governor of New York was not alone; by his side was a pudgy man with horn-rimmed glasses, short, wavy hair, and a face devoid of expression.\n\n"Philip Hart, this is Dr. Henry Kissinger." Rockefeller gestured for the two to shake hands, which they did, before continuing, "Dr. Kissinger's work through the Rockefeller Foundation has provided insight on foreign policy to every President since Eisenhower, and..." The Governor placed his arm around Kissinger, winding up to his pitch's crescendo, "not only does it seem natural that your administration continues the tradition, but also perhaps the Doctor could graduate to working for you directly."\n\nStaffing the State Department was a way away, explained Hart, who started on excuses before the till-then silent Kissinger spoke up. "Strong foreign policy requires authority. I would only work for the President directly." Rockefeller added, "An advisor, or uh, White House staff. State doesn't suit Henry." Hart could see merit in adding to the heads of foreign policy discussion, but it still remained too early for commitments. Furthermore, he was tired and wanted to sleep. "I'll think about it," offered the candidate, and for now, that was that."

He still wasn't entirely comfortable with their extravagance, but he had to admit that they made a fine place to sleep - and good sleep was often hard to come by in this work.\n\n"There's a letter for you, darling. Some bill in the House about national parks. Do you want it?" Janey's voice echoed through the door, reaching up and drawing a smile on the President's face. He set his razor down, made sure his shave was smooth, and emptied the sink of water.\n\n"Yes, Janey. Can you bring my shirt in too?"\n\nA moment later, Janey barged in, holding a hanger with Hart's button-up in one hand and the letter in her other. "Look at me. Carrying all your things around. You know-" She paused abruptly. Philip turned to look at her, only for her to grab his shoulders and point him back towards the mirror. "What's that?"\n\n"What's what?"\n\n"There's a black... mark on your back. That wasn't there before."\n\n"Well, I don't know. Looking at my back's a bit difficult."

Well, how about being the President's doctor?\n\nThe President was right there, about five feet to his right, his wife by his side. He seemed happier than her - some stoicness, maybe, or a simple belief that everything was fine. Physically, the President was fine, was the thing. No symptoms, no weakness, nothing. But behind the scenes...\n\n"Mr. President," Dr. Young began, "My team and I have run some tests." His hands were shaking a little, he realized, jostling the papers. "We took some samples and have found that you... " He paused, adjusted himself, cleared his throat, and willed himself to continue. "You have melanoma, Mr. President."\n\nThe President's face fell. His wife, never one for crying, turned away with tears in her eyes. Dr. Young continued, almost automatically: "It is still possible to treat the cancer, but it's entered a later stage. Surgery, preferably soon, will be the easiest way to remove the growth. We've made a custom treatment plan for you that'll help with discretion, if you'd like to have a look."\n\nPhilip Hart remained silent. His mind was a thousand miles away, back home in Michigan.

Secretaries carried papers and folders, men in suits darted from room to room, the biggest names in D.C. a regular sight going about their frantic business. Surely this was the most stressful - exciting, maybe - workplace in the country, but even bureaucrats and aides had to have their banal office gossip, as much as that pained Tom.\n\n"You know what I've noticed?" Gary began, leaning against a file cabinet. "I haven't seen the President at all."\n\n"He's at Camp David, blockhead. Remember? Vacation and all that." Tom looked back at his coffee cup, now half full. He estimated he had thirty seconds or so before he was done here.\n\n"No, no. I did some poking around and nobody else has seen him either. And you know what I heard?"\n\n"Enlighten me."\n\n"Some secretaries said he got driven over to Walter Reed. He's working there."\n\nThat gave Tom pause. He looked back at Gary, eyebrow raised. "The hospital? Why?"\n\n"Nobody knows," Gary continued, tugging at his collar and glancing around, "But the rumor is he's getting some operation for something. I buy it. I mean, why else would he be there?" His eyes now flicked down the hallway, then at Tom's mug. Without another word, he darted off.\n\nTom looked down.

On any other day, he'd enjoy this weather. Right now, he'd have to make do.\n\n"Good afternoon." He began, and then he found he couldn't stop. "You're all very busy men and women, so I'll make this announcement as quickly as I can. I'm an older man and, like many of us, I have my health issues. My arm has been hampered since the Second World War, I've had my share of coughs and sicknesses, my hair's gotten grayer with every year that goes by. But I'm here to let the American people know—.-" now the press was perking up, he thought, pausing to collect himself. "-know that I have been diagnosed with terminal melanoma, of which treatment has... failed."\n\nA wave of gasps swept over him, forcing him to grip the podium a little tighter. Following that was the rattle of cameras, snapping him back into focus. He straightened his posture, blinked once or twice, stared straight ahead and continued. "America deserves a strong and functional executive. Thus I will resign my office in some weeks time for the capable hands of my Vice President, who I know will serve you well. It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve this nation, and I thank all of you for the support and kindness which has been bestowed upon me. Words could never sum it up. Thank you, dearly."\n\nNow the questions came, but they were nothing more than a loud and jumbled mass to the soon-to-be ex-President.

Later he'd be told they numbered 110 million. He wondered if, through the makeup and the lighting, they could see just how tired he was. "I have never been one for the television address, so I have only gone through with them when there was a matter of national interest. This, of course, is one of those times. Some weeks ago, I announced my cancer diagnosis and my intention to resign. By noon tomorrow, the transfer of power shall have taken place."\n\nWords flowed by him like water as he spoke, taking the pain he always carried out with the tide. Occasionally, he picked out a sentence of what he was saying - "Our urban renewal has breathed life into our cities... our students enjoy the best education in the world... Vice President Morrison has the courage and the tenacity necessary to fight for us against authoritarian menaces without and our national issues within... " - but it all felt hazy, like a dream, or maybe a nightmare. Dreams never filled him with so much uncertainty, but nightmares didn't feel so relieving to go through.\n\n"... in a few short hours, I will leave my post for the only title more honorable and more prestigious that exists in our nation: Citizen. We, citizens of these United States, are brought together by qualities far greater than those which divide us. Through our wisdom and the grace of God, we shall see these times through and emerge into one of worldwide liberty, of international democracy, and of pride in our nation, our people, and ourselves."

The diagnosis throws into doubt his capacity to remain in Washington to serve his duties as President.\n\nDocuments obtained by sources in the White House indicate the diagnosis was made over a year ago by White House Physician James Young. During that period, the President participated in a variety of treatments, including surgery to remove "tissue of concern", at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Few were informed of the President's condition or treatment.\n\nHart, 62, long alarmed staff with his long absences from the White House over recent months. Though concealed in his public schedule as "vacations" to Camp David and his personal home in Michigan, over a dozen sources close to the President and the Cabinet indicate that these stories became increasingly difficult for them to accept. The White House was not immediately available to comment.\n\nMelanoma, which takes the form of dark, irregular lumps on the skin, is the most lethal form of skin cancer. If detected early, it can be treated, but if unaddressed the cancer can spread rapidly and prove fatal. When it has spread to other organs, such as the liver, most survive less than one year.\n\nThe development thrusts a spotlight on Vice President deLesseps Story "Chep" Morrison Sr. A former governor of Louisiana long derided for his relative conservatism and Washington inexperience, Morrison now stands as the likely next President of the United States..."

We've talked about roads, we've talked about cars, and we've talked about crime, but what I'm really worried about..." The President stopped for a moment as if gathering energy. "Is housing affordability. There's just not enough in the URI to make sure families can keep pace with the cost of living."\n\nJacobs scratched a note on her legal pad.

Just as admirable was the work of the aides in the White House.\n\nWith a face as pale as a ghost, the Vice-President went from one meeting to the next, watching as the officials, often young men and women, struggled to keep things running in the President's absence. And it was monumental work, too, work in which the assistance of the secretaries of state, though welcome, was at times not enough.\n\n"But what are we all working towards, anyway?" Chep muttered.

His life flashed before his eyes, but he was too pain-stricken to pay it any heed.\n\nSuddenly the dying Hart opened his mouth in what was to be his final moment of lucidity, and tears began to flood out of his eyes. "I can't go, I'm not ready to go, God, why, please, it's not right, I'm not ready to go..."\n\nAs Chep's face went into his hands and Jane tried to comfort her husband, Hart cried out yet more: "I've got so much left to do, God damn it, there's too much left over—"\n\nSaying those things aloud helped Hart nothing. His mind kept repeating the same thing: "God, why did this have to happen? Why do I have to go like this?

He looked up over the amber waves of his South Dakota farm. Those crops needed pesticides and water and workers to tend them. The tractors needed gas and maintenance. And his family...\n\n"Daddy! Daddy!" He turned, plastering a smile on his face as Melanie and Delilah, his twin daughters, dashed up to him. "Well, howdy, girls," he said. "How was school today?"\n\n"It was amazing, daddy," Mel said. "We heard all about the Dust Bowl and the Depression!"\n\n"Ah, that was the time of Roosevelt. Great man, great man," Steve said. "Go on, now. Your mother'll need help making dinner." He allowed his face to relax into a scowl as he watched them run inside. His family, he finished, needed food on the table. And that was getting harder and harder to do, lately.\n\nRoosevelt... Steve had always thought that the Republicans and Democrats, whatever their differences, both cared about helping the little guy. That had been true, he thought, for most of his life. But now... it wasn't that Steve had anything against minorities in the cities. Most of them, anyways. But lately it seemed that all President Hart and the RDCs cared about was building city basketball courts... and leaving kids out in the countryside up the creek. Steve pursed his lips. He'd voted for Hart once, and he'd been with the RDCs since they'd come together. He didn't think that was going to change. But when he looked out at his farm, the voices of his girls sounding faintly from the house, he didn't know how much more he could take."

You can have your people on the Council start drafting plans for each contingency. If and when this blows up, I want to be fully informed." Kissinger nodded and made his way to the door. But then, as if remembering something, he stopped. Hart raised his eyebrows. "Is there something else?"\n\n\"It's not exactly my purview," Kissinger said in his gravelly German accent, "but I read an article in the newspaper about your popularity in the midwest, and it startled me. I believe that your position on the cities is being misrepresented to these voters. Secretary McCarthy has taken the biggest hit, but this dip in support may impact domestic support for our initiatives abroad." The light shined off his glasses, his face unreadable. "I just thought you should know."\n\n"Well, thank you for telling me. You're dismissed," Hart said. Kissinger nodded and closed the door, leaving the President alone with his thoughts. The Midwest... he could survive this. Maybe he'd been neglecting them, but the Democrats always stood for the little guy, the small farmer. Where else did they have to go, with the Progressives floundering and Schlafly's ilk making Hoover seem like Bukharin? He massaged his temples. What was he even doing? Maybe it was inevitable that some would be left behind in the fight for equality. But he sure didn't expect to be in this position when he'd accepted that nomination what felt like an eternity ago."

He knew there wasn't any reason to be frightened; the Secret Service had men around his Georgetown house 24/7, and the letter sounded more like bravado than a credible threat. But the words were a punch to his gut. He'd joined the Hart campaign because new politics were the way forwards- the way to represent all Americans. And here was some farmer talking to him like he was a feudal lord in the French Revolution.\n\nMcCarthy buried his head in his hands. The worst part wasn't the fear or the shame or explaining to his wife why men in black had to follow them at all times to their weekly dinner dates. It was that he knew the farmers were right. He was out of his depth. He tried to do right by them but he was failing them. And if the Hart Administration ever found itself in need of a fall guy for these failures...

Farmers feel a bit left behind by all our urban renewal programs, and they've told me that in... passionate terms.

"We can't exactly turn around and invest money we don't even have in rural areas while leaving our work in the cities half finished. We still have time before the General; we can win them back."\n\n"Be that as it may," McCarthy said, "there needs to be some response. Mr. President, to show that you're with them.

Many in the RDC looked at the situation with despair.\n\nBut, in town after town across the Great Plains, the President had shown up, listened to people's problems, and shown them the work his Administration was doing to solve them. Where policy had left people behind, he'd offered his apologies. And as the word spread, the jeers and heckles were slowly replaced by cheers and applause. Where disagreement existed, it was advanced in good faith- and Hart made sure to answer in kind.\n\nOn the last stop of his grant tour, Minnesota, President Hart saw the fruits of his labor.

It was the simple pleasures in life that made the grind of his job worthwhile. An eager smile on his face, he walked up to Manny the butcher with a spring in his step, eager to-\n\n"Ten for a pound?

I hear the farmers out in the Plains are having lots of problems these days. From what I hear they ain't making as much money on their meat as they used to. They can't afford to raise the same number of cows. Means less meat in the market for you and me. This guy here is all I got." He glanced down. "So, uh, you buyin', or..."\n\n"Sorry, Manny," Rob said. "I can't bring that home to my wife for ten bucks a pound, not on my salary. Guess she'll just have to make a tuna casserole or something." He scowled as he trudged out of the butcher shop. The last time he'd had trouble finding meat like this... had to have been just after the war, when he was a much younger man. He'd heard President Hart talk up a big game about a better America for all.

These temporary boycotts have caused even more damage to the struggling farmers of the Great Plains.\n\nThe price increases come on the heels of increasing trouble in the country's agricultural sector. Partially resulting from what many critics consider to be the Hart Administration's unfair focus on America's urban centers, the profits of America's farmers have been steadily shrinking. Many have already gone out of business, and this trend shows no sign of slowing. Agriculture Secretary Eugene McCarthy has come under special scrutiny for these issues.\n\nRepresentatives of both caucuses of the NPP have harshly criticized the President's policies. Henry M.

"We could ramp up farm subsidies. That should buy them some time," he said.\n\nPresident Hart looked, not unreasonably, to his Agriculture Secretary. "Do you have anything to say, Gene?" Eugene McCarthy swallowed, shifting in his seat. For the first time, he felt his lack of depth in the office he'd been appointed to. "I, ah- I think George basically has the right idea. We need to keep the farmers afloat until the economy rights itself. We could also communicate with the farmers as much as possible, reassure them that we're dealing with their problems."

I accepted this job because I believed the President cared about all Americans. I now see I was wrong; for this Administration America ends at the limits of major cities. I stand against this abandonment of vast swathes of this country's common people." He hoped his righteous stare was sufficiently presidential.

"One of our own cabinet members publicly coming out against us like this? It'll tank trust in us from everyone. I don't even want to think about the celebrations Schlafly's people must be having." The door opened, interrupting the discussion; an aide put a letter on the desk in front of Hart. The President sighed.\n\n"I think we all know what this is."

They'll think back to the months upon months of their profits slowly collapsing, wondering if everything they built would face ruin, of the government going on its merry way as if nothing was happening. They'll think that for all their talk of equality, the Liberals never really cared about them, pouring money into the cities while the countryside was destroyed.

Alone in a nearby corridor, her staff maintaining their privacy, the city manager began his story.\n\n"McAlester is on the verge of financial collapse, ma'am.

This would be a serious crisis, but New York had handled worse, hadn't it?\n\nIn the dark of the bedroom, great doubts plagued Philip Hart's mind. He had entered office with the brightest of aspirations and the plans to achieve them. Yet here he was, sleeping in luxury even as misery engulfed the most vulnerable of America's urban centers. Feeling sick to his stomach, he returned to bed and embraced Jane.\n\nWith his wife beside him, he felt a bit more certain of his position. In the morning, he would consult her and begin the process of dealing with this crisis. For now, however, he had to sleep despite the crisis gnawing at his mind."

 hart.bankrupcycrisis.8.desc: ""Due to the fiscal situation, New York City is immediately declaring Chapter 9 bankruptcy and entering into negotiations regarding a payment plan for creditors. This is not a city trying to dodge its responsibilities, but rather is one dealing with an impossible situation the only way left." Mayor John Lindsay maintained his composure as he read the statement, knowing this would cement him forever in history as the man who bankrupted New York City.\n\nAcross the country, eyes glued to new stations drew other conclusions. President Hart's grandiose plans, so complicated and so generous with taxpayer dollars, had laid America's greatest city low beneath a mountain of debt. Of course, the story of New York City's accumulation of debt was more complicated than a simple story blaming Philip Hart but the just-so story rang out across the land.\n\nIn Washington, the cabinet debated whether an emergency bailout of the city was still possible to avoid the worst effects. However, the party's conservatives were already vocally concerned about spending and the talk of expensive bailouts would have them heading for the exits.\n\nAs the story of New York's misery amid the bankruptcy spread across the country, other cities with climbing debt and ties to the URI found themselves concerned. If the debt crisis could lay mighty New York City low, how would Cincinnati or Milwaukee fare? And so the nation braced itself for the next wave of the crisis even as Hart and his government rushed to intervene."

The hostile glitter in the eyes of the ABC newsman was unmistakable. Jacobs swallowed hard but pressed forwards.\n\n"That is an egregious mischaracterization of the present crisis. New York City had run up debt for some time and, even as it participated in URI, failed to slow spending growth in other areas. The municipal government was irresponsible and the Federal government does not hold their pursestrings."\n\n"But the URI spending was a factor? Can other cities participating in the URI expect to face similar debt problems? Bankruptcy?" Another newsman, this one from CBS jumped up to aid his colleague. Circling like sharks, the journalists seemed thrilled to pepper Jacobs with every sharp question they had.\n\n"The administration is continuing to monitor the situation. If other cities have made similar financial errors or malfeasances, we may see the crisis spread..." Even as she said the words, Jane Jacobs felt a hollowness. This was bureaucrat-speak and she was shoveling inoffensive sludge when she knew the truth.\n\nOther cities had unmanageable debts and would be entering crises similar to New York's soon. Yet here she was, holding her tongue and spinning for the press even as Armageddon bore down on the communities she had sworn to protect and had hoped to help."

This comes after years of stable city finances and as a shock to residents..."\n\n"I am sorry to announce that the City of St. Louis will be declaring a state of emergency regarding its debt crisis. To avoid a similar situation as in New York, we are beginning to explore payment plans and austerity options. City residents may notice an increase in police response time as well as larger class sizes as we begin layoffs of teaching staff..."\n\n"I have to say this came as a shock to me. I've lived in Cleveland for thirty-five years, paid my taxes, and never heard a peep about this. Now, suddenly there's an enormous crisis that is going to ruin the city? How many other cities is this going to happen to?"\n\n"That was an interview with a local resident, who asked a question that is on the minds of many Americans today: Is my city next? To explore the question, we spoke with local mayors as well as Republican Senator Barry Goldwater who has been critical of the Hart Administration's spending programs that many hold responsible for the ongoing crisis..." Hart sighed and turned off the television as an aide entered the Oval Office.\n\n"Mr. President? I'm sorry to say that cities are backing away from participation in the URI. The mayors say voters see it as being financially toxic and don't want their city's finances wrapped up in such a risky program. Apparently many think the program's caused the 'bankruptcy wave' sweeping America. We'll try to keep them on board but it isn't looking good...""

Vice President Chep Morrison said, trying to inject some light into the gloomy mood prevailing within the cabinet but his flip remark fell flat.\n\n"That'd be more comforting to me if the economy hadn't taken a dive off of the uncertainty created by the municipal bankruptcy crisis." Hart replied, the stress of the past months written into every line on his face. Treasury Secretary George Smathers looked down at the table, unwilling to meet anyone's gaze or comment.\n\nEvery member of the cabinet knew the public largely blamed the Hart administration for the crisis, the link between the Urban Renewal Initiative and the city bankruptcies too strong of a link to deny even if the larger picture were more complicated. The program itself was now deeply unpopular and had scaled back operations to avoid drawing further controversy.\n\nThe URI abandoning its ambitious goals was perhaps the greatest victory of its conservative foes, Hart reflected as his cabinet debated around him. Now, the right had a toothless yet completely demonized scapegoat to tie around his administration's neck. He could feel the full scope of the failed initiative on his back, knowing it would dog him forever.\n\nAs the weight on his shoulders grew to be nearly unbearable, he reminded himself he still had good advisors and could still work to repair the damage done. Fiscal conservatism may now be on the rise within the United States, but the panic had largely subsided and the Hart administration could get back to work."

As he strode up the stairs, greeting passersby, he took a deep breath of the humid D.C. air. It felt good to be on the move again.\n\n"President Hart is here!" The cry went up among the staff and soon Hart found himself surrounded by junior HEW staff, all cheerful and thrilled to have the President himself visiting. As Hart shook hands and reconnected with campaign volunteers and supporters, he saw other workers passing past in the corner of his eyes.\n\nHe recognized some of them. While most here seemed jubilant, these ones had different expressions. Some walked away stone-faced, with hardly a glance back. Others stood at a distance, occasionally shaking their heads while some looked at him with open disappointment. His skin crawled but he remained to rally the troops.\n\nAfter a bit more time with the staff, Hart excused himself and continued towards Jacobs' office. She looked surprised to see him when he entered.\n\n"I'm honored by the spontaneous visit, Mr. President. What's the occasion?"\n\n"I was hoping to discuss the program adjustments that the Treasury Department had proposed." Jacobs nodded and the two discussed the program briefly, Jacobs content to let Hart direct the discussion. A conclusion reached, she stood.\n\n"Thank you for the visit but I'm afraid I'm going home early today, I have an important appointment." Jacobs left the room, leaving Hart in her office."

He had even gotten his first kiss at a nearby street corner. He walked to work now, and as he'd gotten older he liked what he saw less and less.\n\nThe roads were crumbling, stores were closing down and every year a few more houses stayed empty. The cops seemed overwhelmed and he'd been woken by gunshots in the night several times, his children full of questions he hated having to answer.\n\nHe was a loyal Democrat and a union-man. He'd voted for President Hart but had come to deeply regret that choice. To his mind, the President's focus on 'equality' and 'urban relief' had left men like him to rot in the consequences.\n\nHe'd noticed things get worse when 'they''d started showing up. He was not personally a racist, but did 'they' have to move in on his street? His jaw tightened when he walked past the house every day. What kind of a neighborhood were his kids growing up in? Not the same one as him, that was for sure. There were certainly none of 'them' around here then.\n\nAnd so, after a brief discussion with his wife and a longer one with a realtor, a moving truck appeared outside his home, just as it had many other times in the area. With his savings and a loan from the bank, he settled on a bigger home in a suburb twenty minutes away.\n\nHe would miss walking to work and the memories of the old community, but he worried for his children. He wanted them safe and more comfortable than he had been. These were his justifications for his flight, but something still burned in him as he drove the moving truck away from his old home."

He passed her the file and ducked his head in an apology before exiting.\n\nHer eyes scanned the information before her. There were skyrocketing rates of middle and working class Americans applying for mortgages for suburban homes and selling their houses in the cities. The administration had harbored some concerns about white citizens' reactions to neighborhood integration and she turned to a section of interviews with some of the movers.\n\nThe fleeing homeowners cited rising neighborhood crime, as well as the failure of urban renewal and unsatisfactory infrastructure. Beneath the complaints, or sometimes overtly, Jacobs detected anger at the new arrivals in the neighborhood, natural scapegoats for the community's troubles.\n\nThe consequences of this so-called 'white flight' would be severe, Jacobs already knew. Cities' tax bases would diminish significantly and suffer economically as swathes of citizens uprooted to distant suburbs, leaving the poor and marginalized to suffer in the debris left behind. More cynically, she also realized the danger this posed to President Hart's agenda. The country had made some progress on civil rights over the years but this issue could be career-ender for all involved if mishandled.\n\nWith this in mind, she immediately began drafting her report for the cabinet and the President. She was in a position to act, and every fiber of her being told her to do so before the harm was irreparable. She worked late into the night, knowing Philip Hart would appreciate a complete and well-reasoned proposal."

Her grim demeanor communicated to all present that she was not the bearer of good news.\n\n"Over the past six months, middle and working class Americans have been pouring out of the cities and into newly-developing suburbs. Cities will lose enormous chunks of revenue at a time when, due to commitments to the URI and the administration's agenda, their expenditures are at record highs." Silence hung in the room as the implications sank in. A nationwide debt crisis.\n\n"I believe this administration's agenda is at a turning point, we either succeed or fail. Mr. President, either we slim these programs down and dampen down the controversy, or we reinforce them to overcome the doubters and expenses, but this middle road is poison." Her case made, Jacobs sat down, hoping you'd reached the Michigander.\n\nHart seemed to be turning everything over in his head, weighing the crisis Jacobs had brought him. After a time, his natural inclination for consultation won out.\n\n"Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Secretary Jacobs. Continue to monitor the situation while I speak with the relevant experts on the matter and see what they recommend." Hart said, as the other cabinet secretaries began to clear out, their minds back on their own portfolios.\n\nJacobs sat alone for the moment. She'd tried her best, and hoped the President would act. The country was sleep-walking into a disaster and she could hardly bear to watch. As ever with her department, she seemed destined to sweep up the detritus of social calamity rather than prevent its formation."

Their foreman, Donnie, was on a half-day break and there had been no talk of a replacement.\n\n"Hey fellas," The newcomer said, his gravelly voice quieting them instantly, "I'm sorry to break it to like this, but the project's been suspended. Maybe they'll cancel it, maybe it restarts but in the meantime, you're laid off." His blunt delivery and the shocking noise caused a moment of pure silence before the whole group erupted.\n\n"Are you joking?" One of the men shouted as shock and horror roiled the group, "We bust our backs for weeks and that's it?" The foreman turned and walked away, his message delivered.\n\n"You scumbag! What am I telling my kids tonight? Huh?" One of the men heaved his helmet at the foreman, the headwear bouncing off the body of his truck. The man sped up, clambering into the vehicle and peeling away down the road.\n\nAs the construction workers took stock of their situation, they realized there was no point to remaining at the overpass with their common purpose destroyed. Loading up into their trucks, they scattered to the winds chasing the next opportunity.\n\nBehind them and finally alone, the slowly-rusting hulk of the overpass stood as a warning, to what though was unclear. Whether cars would ever cross it or the promise of its partial construction ever be fulfilled was also unknown, but nothing would be added to it for some time other than rot and rust. Nature took its toll."

He had not climbed to the heights of the American labor movement by wearing his heart on his sleeve, "But I need to be frank here. You're in trouble. People are fed up with your ideology and your justifications for it. You can't win them back by talking, Hart, you'll just annoy them."\n\n"Things have gotten that bad..." Hart said, the import of the union leader's word still sinking in, "What should I do?"\n\n"I support your mission, Mr. President," Reuther replied, his eyes sparkling with genuine intensity, "You and I both want progress, economic and social, to heal America's divisions and inequities. It's a nice end point, sir, but you have to get us there first. Results matter."\n\n"We're still working," Hart said weakly, "These things take time..."\n\n"We don't have time, Mr. President, you have problems. You need to act and you need to deliver, sir, that's my recommendation to you as an advisor and a friend."\n\nHart nodded, Reuther's point made.

She had taught fifth grade for a dozen years now and delighted in watching the young minds passing through grow and develop. It never ceased to amaze her the wild shifts the young were capable of compared to the rigid adults around them and how they seemed like new people by the end of the school year. The start of every academic year was thus normally a joyous one, though this one was sadly different.\n\nA memorandum from the principal was waiting for her on her desk when she arrived, a stark point of misery in the otherwise bright and happy room. The public school's budget had been unexpectedly lowered, significantly. There would be no new textbooks or equipment and the new curriculum that was to be implemented had been indefinitely delayed.\n\nMrs. Sherman felt for a moment as if the world had been pulled out from under her. She had planned everything for the year assuming all would go well, that she would have new tools to stimulate the latest crop of students. What had gone wrong? The memo made reference to "unexpected budgetary issues" and it had seemed that quite a few families were moving away...\n\nResolving to focus on more productive matters, the teacher set aside her hope-for teaching plan and began on a new one. She had less time, so it would be somewhat ramshackle, and she would still be relying on the older textbooks, flawed curriculum and damaged educational equipment in the coming year. With a defeated sigh, she plowed ahead with her work, reasoning that she would still do her best for the students but sadly would always know what an opportunity had been taken away from them."

It was natural to want to take the temperature of the people and have it done regularly. However the latest swathe of data from polls commissioned both by Hart and the Republican-Democratic Coalition were uniformly distressing to all who saw them.\n\n54% Americans admitted to distrusting the government. 59% believed that the administration and government officials were out of touch. 52% were worried about increased spending. 60% of Americans admitted to being afraid for the state of the country. Division among citizens had deepened such that only 23% of Americans felt capable of having a productive discussion with someone who disagreed with them politically.\n\nReading these numbers and seeing the stark declines in sentiment from years prior, Hart's stomach dropped. He knew his agenda was ambitious but for it to be this polarizing shocked him. Had his travails really disillusioned this much of America? He began to pace about the Oval office, taking this brief moment of solitude to ponder his next move.\n\nSomething had to be done to restore Americans' confidence in government, to remind the working-class that the RDC stood for them and that progress was not a threat. He knew that he still had time to right the situation but could tell that his window of opportunity was narrowing.\n\nPicking up the phone at the Resolute Desk, he began making calls.

In the past he had pared and shaped budgets but in this instance it would be more of an evisceration, a new experience for Nick.\n\nIt was necessary, after all, given the dire straits the city's budget was in. Necessity drew him to first cut repaving the streets, reasoning the citizens would hardly notice, let alone care. With the budget shortfall the way it was they were fortunate to have roads at all. The same motive of necessity led to an end to all new infrastructure projects as wasteful spending given the circumstances. The city was fine as is. Then he turned his attention to park building as well as modernization projects, wiping them out entirely.\n\nLooking down at the new budget before him, pride swelled forth. He had done it, in spite of the exodus of citizens and corresponding collapse in revenues the city would survive the coming year on a far more responsible budget. To be sure, the roads would be worse, the parks limited and the infrastructure problems persistent, but what mattered was keeping the lights on now.\n\nHis work done, the savior of the city decided to leave early for the day. Ferreira had worked up quite an appetite and was sure that when his superiors saw the work they had approved he would be receiving plenty of kudos. Maybe he would take the family out for a nice dinner. His wife would certainly be impressed by the important work he'd done."

The controversy recently, the trouble, it has one source: white folk do not want black people in their neighborhoods," Chep said with placatory hands raised, anticipating Hart's objections before continuing, "They may accept them voting, they may want them to have rights, but they don't want them anywhere near their kids. That's just how they are."\n\n"What are you suggesting, Chep?" Hart asked, his curiosity piqued even if he disliked the road Morrison had started down.\n\n"Whatever else we do, it might be time to pump the brakes on integration. We've pushed traditional working folk pretty damn far, let's count our victories before we overextend. Step back from the anti-discrimination stuff, at least until the heat dies down."\n\n"The answer is no, Chep. You know where I stand on this issue, and even if you disagree or think it's foolish, I view it as a point of morality."\n\n"I understand, Mr. President," Chep said with a rueful smile, "I'm just asking you to weigh that against what your eyes and ears are telling you.

 hart.whiteflight.15.desc: "Tyler Brown was eight years old and he wanted to be a garbage man when he grew up. This was a significant adjustment from his previous aspiration to be an astronaut, but his parents supported him. His favorite time of the week was watching his heroes in their enormous, impressive trucks keeping the city clean. However, these past few weeks he had been disappointed.\n\nTheir previously clean inner-city block was steadily growing seedier and seedier. Bag after bag packed with reeking garbage steadily stunk up the streets. Tyler's heroes were nowhere to be seen, their rates reduced due to the increasingly common refrain of 'budgetary issues'.\n\nTyler's parents had noticed other things. Street paving was being left unfinished, lampposts failed but were not replaced and graffiti and vandalism multiplied. Strangers, unfriendly and gaunt, lurked in alleyways, and there had been reports of attacks and robberies.\n\nTyler noticed his parents increasingly talking late at the dinner table, eventually hearing the dread words: 'move away'. He loved his school, but many of his friends had also moved recently. Maybe elsewhere, somewhere with garbage men would be better? Gunshots in the night awoke the entire family that night, a confused and scared Tyler having to sleep with his parents for a week. The move was now a necessity.\n\nWith a heavy heart, the Browns departed their home. They had watched the neighborhood decay in front of them and so, like many others before them, they left for brighter pastures in a suburb twenty miles away. Tyler, still unsure of the change, was told the garbage men came weekly at the new home. Mollified, he grew excited to see the new house and the pain of the change faded. Life went on."

They were all concentrated in the same area: the neighborhood surrounding Rizzi's precinct.\n\nIt hadn't always been so bad, plenty of local hoodlums but nothing more serious than assaults or larceny. Then, the money and soon after the jobs had begun flowing out with moving trucks driving the whole process along. Some houses were still empty while others had been snapped up by slumlords eager to rent to the deprived urban masses.\n\nWith the money and jobs gone, crime slid in to fill the vacuum. Robberies were most common, elderly citizens having purses grabbed or being beaten for their wallets. Murders had also shot up. In the past, it had been the rare jealous husband caught by the police quickly, now strangers shot one another over a baggie of reefer, or burglaries would escalate into dead homeowners.\n\nHe could see the desperation in everyone's eyes when he was on the streets. Citizens were scared, criminals could see an opportunity and the government was nowhere in sight. The Hart administration had talked a big game, but the results had scared the cities enough they wanted nothing to do with anything the Feds were pitching.\n\nAt least it kept Frank Rizzi busy, he thought to himself as another call came in. Double homicide of two young males, possible drug connection. An increasingly common narrative, but Frank enjoyed the classics and wanted to be back on the hunt. The government may not have been doing its bit to help the people and keep the cities safe, but he could at least try his best."

 hart.whiteflight.17.desc: "A vicious cycle was engulfing America. As well-to-do citizens abandoned the cities for welcoming suburbs, those cities lost needed tax revenue. To avoid a debt crisis, those cities then cut their expenditures. These cuts included city services that residents relied upon and had come to expect, such as law enforcement or sanitation services. The decay of services naturally led to further departures, requiring another round of budget adjustments.\n\nWith no options left to them, city governments across the land began canceling any ongoing projects, clawing back every cent of expenditure possible to shore up the gaping holes in their bottom lines. This not only further harmed the cities' economies but signified something greater, a complete retreat by American cities from any sort of urban reform.\n\nRather than invest in expensive public transportation or attempt any serious reform by public projects, the cities would focus on the two traditional points of urban management. The cities would build roads and maintain law and order, with any of the high-minded nonsense from the Hart administration left by the wayside. After their disappointment with reform, the cities no longer had any thirst for progress.\n\nAmid all of this, the poorest urban neighborhoods of all suffered in obscurity. The nightly news rarely spoke of Harlem, the Black Belt, or Fuller Park. The families trapped in urban decay, brutalized by crime and abandoned by the cities they called home went unmentioned. An attempt had been made to help them, bold but brief, and it had failed miserably. Maybe they had never had a chance, or perhaps the brief chance that had existed had been bungled and lost for a generation."

He already knew this, of course, but she felt obligated to make the report.\n\nMorrison, recognizing Jacobs's distress, took his chance to intervene.\n\n"I've had my ear to the ground, taking the temperature of all involved. It's not good, Phil. They're still gonna keep cutting until there are no ties to your projects left and they're back on their feet financially."\n\n"The cities will be in the same place as we started, worse even, now that urban reform is a toxic topic..." Jacobs said before she halted, seeing the pained expression crossing Philip Hart's face.\n\nThe President looked exhausted, lines etched deep into his face by the stress of failure. He shook his head, the golden visions he had had for America's cities, for the country, had turned to ash in his mouth. Whatever good he had accomplished in his presidency would always be weighed against this failure, a permanent and enormous black mark on his record.\n\nJacobs left the office quickly, soon followed by Chep who was unable to raise his chief's spirits from this nadir. Hart was left alone in the oval office to contemplate. For a while, no one dared disturb him, content to allow the most powerful man in America to reflect on his colossal errors."

The President politely asked, indicating scrawled writing on a nearby wall. Grimacing that it had not been covered up in time for the visit, the official approached with Hart to decipher the vandalism. The President did not read the word, his lip curling at the vile slur daubed on the wall..\n\n"To be frank, sir, we've had issues on that front," The official, a man named Theo said, adjusting his tie, "Local residents think public housing means that more Black people will be in their neighborhood and we've had complaints."\n\n"How common is this? Are there other incidents going beyond vandalism?"\n\n"Fairly common, unfortunately. Racist fear is spreading among local whites. They're afraid that the new Black residents will bring crime, undercut their wages, and crowd their schools. The Blacks are well aware of how the Whites feel but just want a better life. The community is divided further and further by the day..." Theo trailed off, suddenly aware of how freely he was speaking to the President of the United States.\n\nPhilip Hart frowned, studying the graffito like it was a venomous insect. This was the enemy, this bigotry, this closed-mindedness. They would overcome it, with time, with work, and with words but not today.

 hart.raceriots.2.desc: "It had been a long, hot summer in York, Pennsylvania and Oliver DuBois was tired. He had been in the crowd protesting for a bi-racial police review board years ago. The all-white city council had said no, then said it again, and again. He marched in the streets against police brutality and had police dogs sicced on him by laughing officers. He had just about had enough. Then word spread through the Black neighborhoods that a young Black man had been doused in gasoline and set alight by a white gang.\n\nSo, Oliver, his neighbors, friends and strangers found themselves on the streets, screaming, shouting, demanding to be seen. Any thought of marches, of petitions, of reform had disappeared entirely. Fires licked the edges of stores, their display windows shattered and contents seized. A line of riot officers, carrying shields and toting canisters of tear gas, blocked their egress from the street and broader neighborhood. Their rage would be tolerated, but only so long as the fires of discontent torched Black rather than white neighborhoods.\n\nTo further reinforce that point, white rioters were out on the streets tonight as well, with the police either cooperating with them or rarely and halfheartedly trying to send them home. White gangs, sensing an opportunity, also took to the streets and rooftops, taking potshots at Blacks they saw on the street. Many had been waiting for this day to come for months if not years, savoring the open conflict.\n\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania, eager to be seen standing against disorder was quick with a statement: "I am appalled at the rioting taking place in York. I know many folks from there and this is a small, criminal element focused on destruction and opportunism. I am in contact with the city government and monitoring the situation closely...""

 hart.raceriots.3.t: "National Review: Standing Athwart History"
 hart.raceriots.3.desc: ""The recent riots in York, PA, harbinger a disturbing new development within the American body politic. Discontented citizens, refusing both the ballot and bullhorn, instead turn to looting, arson and brawling as a means of recourse. Such violence is all the more reprehensible when these same citizens have alternative means of being heard by the government and effecting desired policy changes than mob violence.\n\nThese scenes are sadly familiar to many citizens, who can recall similar scenes from the unrest in Birmingham amid Dr. King's protests only a few years ago. The avowed claim of the civil rights campaigner to be 'non-violent' appears increasingly at odds with the results of his movement. How many more Yorks will there be in the pursuit of utopian equality? How many more poor neighborhoods will suffer the rage of their inhabitants?\n\n"At the root of this, it is obvious, is the race issue. A compromise, bringing together all Americans, is worth seeking even if radicals on both sides must be ignored. President Hart's plans for integration, of non-discrimination, strike at the heart of American society, of freedom of association, and historic neighborhood character rendering them fundamentally unworkable. Nor can the utmost desires of Dixie be entertained."\n\nWhile such a settlement is pursued, the state cannot abdicate its duty. The maintenance of public order and the prevention of mob violence is the premise of all civil government. If local police are unable to prevent these outrages, the national guard and FBI should be ready to step into the breach and guarantee domestic tranquility."

"This administration has been the best friend to Blacks since the days of Lincoln, and they thank us by burning cities down?"\n\n"It's a long road, Mr. Vice President, and we've only taken a step or two," Jane Jacobs, the HEW Secretary replied, wincing, "Until Black people can enjoy the same rights, privileges and luxuries as white Americans then we should expect unrest and unhappiness..."\n\n"You're telling me we have to do more?" Chep's voice rose as emotion entered his voice, his position on civil rights was muddy to say the least, but he did not like Jacob's way of thinking. "We have cities burning across this country, looting mobs, and your answer is to pour more money into these places? To ask them about their feelings rather than let the police do their jobs?"\n\n"I'm saying that rather than pour gasoline on the fire by setting the police loose, we deal with the circumstances leading to this alienation and violence—"\n\n"They're adults, Mrs. Jacobs!

He had been booked into the county jail on petty larceny charges. The deep cuts around his wrists showed he had never been uncuffed. The man's mouth twisted and he checked the box beside "accident" on his clipboard. Word of the injustice spread quickly.\n\nAtlanta burned. Black neighborhoods, familiar with the cops' brutality, refused to back down. In spite of curfews, of lines of police with eager nightsticks, of fire hoses and warning shots, they stayed on the streets. Most were happy simply to oppose the police, to be part of their people in a struggle, but others were more opportunistic. Shards of glass from broken store windows littered the sidewalks.\n\n"Justice now! Cops out!!" The chant, born not from an activist's plan but the simple indignance of the average inhabitant, filled the air. The police lines retreated, swept away by the tidal wave of fury. As they withdrew, stores were looted, firebombed, and occasionally, if Black-owned or operated by a decent white, left untouched.\n\nWhen night fell, the police took their revenge. Shotgun blasts garnering a half dozen dead were sufficient to dissuade the vast majority to abandon their insurrection. Naturally, things got worse as Governor Lester Maddox decided to issue a statement.\n\n"Despite the chaos I am proud of the police response. When criminal elements rise up, the righteous men of the law will be there to beat them back down..." The crowing words of Governor Maddox made Atlanta a cautionary tale.

 hart.raceriots.6.desc: ""There has been much talk in the White press of 'race riots' of late. This is a term used for three purposes, all of which work directly against the cause of racial liberation. First, its use of the word 'race' invokes the racial unity of the white majority to resist any claims to freedom by minorities, specifically Black people. This assures white unity in the maintenance of white supremacy.\n\nThe next purpose behind this term is to slander legitimate grievances and resistance activity to oppression as criminal activity. For Black Americans, white police are a brutish and oppressive class. They have taken too many of our children and parents away, either to the prison farm or the morgue. They guard the border between Black people and White America. Standing between an oppressed people and a better life, the cop swinging the truncheon is a monster.\n\nFinally, the purpose of this term is to avoid the use of the proper word: REBELLION. A country founded on a revolution has spawned another one, within itself. This true revolution rejects its progenitor's evil hypocrisy. The words of the declaration of Independence, 'all men are created equal' remain as true as the day it was written, yet America has failed to live up to that promise every minute of its existence.\n\nBlack people have gone from chattel being whipped to death in the fields to 'free' people murdered by police. We are denied equal housing, decent jobs and quality education. Every President has failed to do their job and guarantee our people justice. Finally, we have had enough. Until every White American understands that there can be no peace until there is justice, this will continue. Until the hypocrisy and injustice is burned out of America's soul, let the struggle go on.""

Since it was founded in the 19th century by immigrants and westward pioneers Chicago had been more a coalition of communities under a single banner than a singular city itself. Each group stayed in their own neighborhoods—segregated portions making up a divided yet powerful whole. The Urban Renewal Initiative however, had begun to change that.\n\nWith the increased funds and enforcement from the federal government, the longstanding de facto segregation was at last being challenged. The invisible walls between neighborhoods were gradually being broken down as Black residents ventured into and resided within previously entirely white enclaves. Apartments and homes became available to them, even if only due to threats of government litigation under new federal anti-discrimination measures.\n\nFor many, this was a time of promise. People could climb out of the slums and into homes suitable for human inhabitation with the promise of better schools, better services and better jobs. For others, unwilling to tolerate a neighbor of a different race, this seemed like the first wave of an invasion.\n\nThe brief euphoria for non-whites and anxiety among whites soon gave way to an unrelenting tension. The new non-white arrivals were made to feel like outsiders, to understand that they were not welcome and that if the whites had anything to say about it their intrusion would be temporary. Rude comments, conflicts and other incidents had every resident of Chicago doubting the intentions of anyone with a different shade of skin. The walls had been demolished, but great divides had appeared in the void left by them and in spite of the ever-present federal regulations and dollars they seemed to be only deepening."

With a shaking hand, he switched on the device.\n\n"We estimate there are thousands of rioters on the streets. Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty has declared a state of emergency and warned that looting will not be tolerated, with deadly force by police authorized. Police are allegedly overwhelmed and unable to protect vast swathes of the city overtaken by the disturbances. No word from the federal government yet..."\n\nThe glowing screen illuminated Hart's face in the darkness. The television switched to footage from news helicopters overlooking the crowds. The streets were an ocean of people. He could not drag his eyes away as he watched Los Angeles tear itself apart. Stores were being looted, rioters carrying out armfuls of goods or tossing firebombs into the businesses. Entire blocks burned, enormous columns of smoke rising into the night air. In the orange glow of the fires, Los Angeles looked to be in the midst of an apocalypse.\n\nShaking himself from his stupor, he made for the telephone.

The Decathlon was a yearly event consisting of questions involving art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science with further sections for speech, debate and interviews.\n\nThe arriving students were the flower of the American education system, its next generation of lawyers, scientists and doctors. For some in Washington, their arrival proposed an enticing opportunity. Vice President Chep Morrison and Secretary of State Harry Truman approached President Hart with an intriguing proposal.\n\n"We should consider inviting a Japanese team. It's a nice gesture, and if they accept we'll get a chance to see how our youngster measure up against the real competition."\n\n"Think of it as the Olympics on a much smaller scale," Truman offered, trying to assuage any skepticism Hart may be feeling, "The exchange of 'athletes' and friendly competition creates goodwill and trust between nations, in theory. This is the next step in a thaw, sir."\n\n"Very well then, gentlemen, let's proceed with your plan," Hart said, "Get a diplomatic note to the Japanese Prime Minister proposing such an exchange. If they go for it, we're golden, and if they refuse," And here a small smile played across Philip Hart's face, "Then we know they're afraid of a little friendly competition.""

 hart.japanacdec.2.t: "Going to America"
 hart.japanacdec.2.desc: "Unexpected invitations from the Hart Administration of the United States arrived at the Education and Foreign Ministries today. The United States wished for the Empire of Japan to dispatch a delegation of talented students to compete in something called an 'academic decathlon'. Once the concept was explained, the debate among the cabinet ministers began.\n\n"This would be an excellent opportunity for our students to gain perspective on American education and schooling, as well as the students themselves." The foreign minister offered, having come to rather like the idea of a thaw as it meant more responsibilities for him and his office.\n\n"I am not so sure, dear colleague," The Education minister interjected, keenly aware that an academic defeat overseas would not reflect well on him or his ministry, "Not only would we be exposing our youth to American decadence but they may also be treated very poorly and perhaps even humiliated by their hosts. America is known for its racism, after all." Many of the cabinet members nodded in agreement, well-aware of Americans' thoughts on 'the Oriental races' and unwilling to see Japan's star youths insulted by the rude Yankees.\n\nThe debate continued in circles for some time, the pros of the plan matching up against the cons nearly perfectly. With consensus impossible to reach, the decision was made that the Prime Minister would have the final say, breaking the ministerial deadlock. Either Japan's star students would be headed to D.C., or America's invitation and the thaw it seemed to imply, would be rejected."

 hart.japanacdec.3.t: " A Missed Opportunity"
 hart.japanacdec.3.desc: ""Dear Secretary Truman, thank you for the invitation but the Prime Minister believes such an event is not in the Empire's best interests. Thank you for the invitation..." Truman trailed off as he read the note, seeing Hart shrug his shoulders. They had half-expected this outcome and now at least the winner of the competition was guaranteed to be an American.\n\nFor Tate Andrews, a competitor in the Academic Decathlon, the Japanese refusal was actually rather disappointing. The rumor that Japanese students might be competing had spread like wildfire among the American students, with fears of 'robotic' Japanese students dominating the competition persisting.\n\nStill, a current of disappointment ran through Tate and some of the others as the competition kicked off. He had wanted to test his skills and knowledge against the best, at first in the country, then in the world, or at least the Pacific. It would have been so interesting to compete with the Japanese, to learn what they thought about the United States, and see whether they were actually as good as the rumors seemed to make out.\n\n"Mr Andrews, your question. Explain Niels Bohr's contributions to physics, specifically his work on the atom." The cold voice of the Academic Decathlon judge startled Tate from hisworld of what-ifs and back into the rough and tumble world of Academic Decathlon. He scrambled, his mind racing.\n\n"Niels Bohr...ah..." He was glad the Japanese weren't here to see this, though his parents had made the trip and were watching axiously, "Niels Bohr developed the atom model, particularly the concept of discrete electrons.""

 hart.japanacdec.4.desc: "Dear Secretary Truman," Harry Truman read aloud to President Hart and VP Chep Morrison, having burst into the Oval Office with the reply from Tokyo, "We would be delighted to participate in this academic competition. A team will arrive in California for the competition at the end of the week. We wish your students good luck in the competition." He looked around the room, a smile on his face. Diplomacy was getting its chance.\n\nThe reaction among the Californian students was not quite so positive. Existing as they did at the edge of the Pacific the American students had grown up on whispered fears of the empire across the ocean and now the 'enemy' was in their midst.\n\n"Jeez, Will, they sure are quiet." Nate Williams said to his friend as they examined the new arrivals. The Japanese students had formed a circle, keeping to themselves as they reviewed for the competition.\n\n"They're bright as heck," His friend, Will Byers, responded, his eyes fixed on one of the few female Japanese students dispatched from the empire, "Gonna be a real competition this year."\n\n"Keep your mind on the game." Nate said with a chuckle, clapping his friend on the back, "Let's go over the study cards again. You do want to win, don't you?"\n\nThe first few rounds of the Academic Decathlon were cutthroat, with weaker teams falling away quickly. The Japanese team easily crushed its opponents, only meeting real opposition as it met stronger opponents. Finally, Nate and Will's team found themselves facing the Japanese in the final round."

The student, his young face calm and still, reflected for a brief moment before answering in crisp, clear English.\n\n"The battle of Toulon." He bowed his head briefly to the official, knowing what the next words would be. The game had been close but now it was over.\n\n"With that, Team Japan has beaten Rosecrantz Preparatory College, winning the Academic Decathlon by two points." A slight note of bitterness tinged the official's words, but he suppressed any ill feeling. They were still children, smart ones, with excellent manners and a quiet professionalism. He shook hands with the victors, then the runners up as the cameras flashed.\n\nAfter the trophies had been given, cake and other snacks were served. The Americans had occupied most of the tables while the Japanese students kept to themselves, basking in their victory. Occasionally, loud cheers of 'banzai!' erupted, prompting reproachful looks from their hosts.The Decathlon ended, the Japanese students had no reason to remain in the United States. Glory awaited them at home in Tokyo where the press was already writing up the Japanese academic triumph. Many of the students were excited for what this success meant for their university prospects.\n\nThe Americans, beaten at their own game at home, took solace in the narrowness of the Japanese victory. If they were ever invited back, or deigned to return, the Americans would be ready."

Somehow, despite being a weak member of the team, he was on a roll, not having missed a question yet. He racked his brain trying to think, grasp on to any particular memory. He'd once liked a girl named Jenny...\n\n"Dr. Edward Jenner." He said, confidence somewhat restored.\n\n"Correct. With that, Rosencrantz Preparatory College defeats Team Japan by two points." The official, a man named Otis, turned back to Will, joy clear on his face as he shook his hand, "Well done, young man, well done!"\n\nWill still couldn't quite believe that he'd managed to seal the deal, having just tried to survive his turn at the podium. As he stumbled away from Otis and towards the audience seats, the Japanese team captain, a boy named Haruto approached him.\n\n"Congratulations," He said, giving a shallow bow. Will reciprocated a little and then thrust his hand forward.\n\n"Thank you. I think I got a little lucky. " Haruto shook his hand delicately. The victory had been very narrow and it was the American's home field, his pride was intact.\n\n"Nonsense. Enjoy your victory. Perhaps we will meet again and it shall be our turn." With a brief smile, Haruto departed with the rest of his group, leaving Will to celebrate with his team. This would be quite a feather in his cap, and would help keep his father off his back."

But now, sitting across from him in the Oval Office for what had to be one of the last times, she realized that there was nothing that she could say. All that was left was two words. "I'm sorry."\n\nIt pained her to see the exhaustion in his eyes. But there was still that same strength with which he'd changed the country as he met her gaze. "Thank you, Jane. I'll... I'll say my goodbyes to you another time. For now, we need to talk about Chep." He continued on and her reflexive objection died in her throat. "He's going to be President after me, like it or not. And he needs your support if he's going to keep everything we've accomplished going strong. I know you have your differences with him, but he's a good man and his record in New Orleans shows he'll do right by the country."\n\n"I- I'm sorry, Mr. President. I just can't." Jacobs fought to keep her voice down as she spoke. "When he was Mayor he was everything we fought against. Racism, redlining- I understand you had to balance the ticket, but Chep as President? No. It's too much. I'm sorry."\n\n"People can change, Jane," the President said. "Chep has changed. He's seen the importance of what we're doing, I know he has!" He massaged his temples. "Look. Even if I wanted to, there's nothing I can do that will mean he won't be President. All you can do is either work with him to honor my legacy, to push him to be better, or resign. But if you resign, don't act like you're taking some brave stand. You'll be giving up on what I fought for- on my life!" He deflated. "You don't have to do it for him. Or even for me. But everyone we've helped needs you to keep fighting for them in the White House after I'm gone. Can you be their advocate to him like you were to me?" Jacobs looked down at her hands, swallowing.

"I don't know how Chep does these damn things."\n\nJane Jacobs, dressed in a black dress and pearls, gave a small laugh. "Oh, I suppose he had to be good at something."

Have you seen the things she says about him in the gossip rags? And Janey's heard her shouting..."\n\n"God, Philip, are you telling me that the Vice President is being bullied by his wife?" Jacobs said, but she immediately regretted the remark. She'd worked with women in abusive relationships before and she knew better than anyone that even the most successful people had difficult relationships.

 hart.senate.1.t: "Introduction of The Clean Streets Act"
 hart.senate.1.desc: "The Clean Streets Act has been introduced to the Senate. It will grant cities the ability to remove homeless populations from high-traffic public areas. The bill also provides a small amount of money for the establishment of a rudimentary system of work resource centers in affected neighborhoods. Proponents of the act extol the virtues of the bill, claiming that it will revitalize America's urban centers and incentivize the homeless population to seek jobs.. Of course, the reality of the situation is plain for all to see. The near deadlock in the senate has forced the President and the RDC establishment to water down many aspects of the originally proposed bill. Opponents among the Democratic Caucus insist that this bill, which is aimed at forcing the homeless population away from high-traffic public areas, is nothing but a naked attempt to sweep the issue under the rug.\n\nPrivately, President Hart feels ill at ease with the bill. The lack of a robust system to attack the roots of homelessness and to provide for certain basic necessities has left him frustrated with certain members of the NDC and NPP both. However, he understands that, with the situation in the Senate it will help somewhat. Still, he does wish things had gone differently."

Despite his personal reservations about how lean the bill has turned out, he is expected to sign without issue. All across the country, mainstream urban America rejoices. This bill signals to many a clear stance taken against the homelessness issue. Those areas of the country in which homelessness has had the greatest effects are happy to see their parks and streets free from the refuse of homeless camps and their inhabitants.\n\nHowever, many critics of the bill call its passing nothing more than "An attempt to ignore a growing problem in the hopes of it going away on its own." Recent interviews of the residents of a small camp in New York City have shined a light on the biggest issues of the bill, as many of these people are being forced to abandon what little support networks they may have."

The Clean Streets Act, while contentious, had been thought to be an easily passed bill and its failure has highlighted the divided nature of the current Senate.\n\nThe Senate's failure to pass what was promised to be the first in a long line of new bills has brought new levels of worry about the future success of the Hart presidency. Supporters of the bill have decried the lack of action among the Senate. Unfortunately, many of those who supported the bill as a preliminary compromise before larger reform have been left with worse than nothing. The air among the nation's homeless population remains conflicted, as the bill would have uprooted many from their few sources of stability. However, many realize that the bill had its positives that they are left without.\n\nIn the White House, President Hart must reckon with failure for the first time in his term. The failure of his first major piece of legislation has left him distraught but determined. This has been a wake up call for the President, to be sure, and he is determined not to let it get him down."

The Soup Kitchen Act of [GetYear], if passed, will provide for the funding of soup kitchens in urban areas across America for those down on their luck. Proponents of the bill claim that it will allow the nation's homeless population to pick themselves up from the gutter and reintegrate into society. If these endangered populations do not have to worry about food and other basic necessities they can focus on finding a job and getting off of the streets. However, the bill has received criticism from certain members of Congress. Many among the dissenters fear that this level of handouts to the homeless population will encourage an era of so-called "Welfare Queens" taking advantage of resources set aside for the truly destitute.\n\nWhatever the congressional opinion on the bill may be, President Hart has given his wholehearted support of the bill. President Hart has long shown his concern for those among the population in the greatest danger of falling through the cracks and has begun to rally support for the bill among the populace. Time will tell if the first step of this administration will end in triumph or defeat."

The passing of the bill, which promises to create a safety net for the most impoverished among the American population, has brought renewed hope to the homeless in urban centers around America. All that remains is for President Hart to sign the bill into law.\n\nThe President has been outspoken in his support of the bill and since the bill's passing has been in good spirits. Political analysts across the country are calling this a triumph for the new administration. Many wonder just how much of this momentum the RDC can keep throughout the rest of President Hart's term in office, and some worry that the administration will waste their incoming advantage in the Senate before the midterms.\n\nIn any case, there is an air of celebration across the country as the people look forward with hope."

Despite early analysis that showed above average chances of the bill passing, the Senate has repudiated the first bill of President Hart's agenda. Analysts across the country have painted a bleak picture of the rest of President Hart's term, as the failure of such a simple bill so early in Hart's presidency has shaken the country's faith in the agenda of the Executive going forward.\n\nPresident Hart himself has taken to the podium in an impromptu press conference decrying the failure of the bill. President Hart's personal feelings on the bill have made such a failure difficult to swallow. The President has been shaken but refuses to be cowed by this failure."

 hart.senate.7.desc: "The Substance Abuse Recovery act was introduced to Congress today by leading members of the Republican-Democratic Coalition. Drug addiction rates have risen in recent years and civil society groups have called for Congress to act. Some believe that rehabilitation programs, rather than prison terms for users, are a more productive approach. One such person is President Hart himself, who argues that people in the throes of addiction are unable to bootstrap themselves back into society and must be helped to recover. Championed by the Hart administration, the bill would expand and subsidize rehabilitation programs for drug addicts in America's cities.\n\nThe bill's introduction does not guarantee its passage. There remain conservative skeptics within the coalition while the National Progressive Pact assail the legislation from the right and left. The right-wing members of the Pact accuse the bill of coddling criminals, while the some on the Pact's left condemn it as milquetoast reform.\n\nThe bill now faces committees, budgetary hearings, and the politicking of Washington. The Hart administration may still have to work to push it across the line but the bill's importance merits the effort required."

After the President of the Senate announced the result, applause rang throughout the Senate chamber. The bill's supporters cheered, as did those citizens in the country following the bill's passage, even as its opponents cursed and retreated from the Chamber.\n\nThe bill, now approved, could make its way to President Hart's desk where he would sign it immediately. This was an enormous moment for the most needy among urban communities: addicts. They would now have places and procedures to recover and get back on their feet, making kicking their crippling addictions and rejoining society an actual possibility. Hopefully, the positive effects of the legislation will soon begin manifesting in cities."

Some wanted a second run at the legislation, either whipping votes harder or shifting provisions to win support, but many others, once burned, are much less willing to risk their careers for the benefit of drug addicts.\n\nThis failure is a disappointment for the Hart administration and addicts throughout the country. The lack of programs and assistance will enable addicts to fall further into their addiction while the Hart Administration has seen its ambitious and progressive agenda foiled. Despite the defeat, Hart and his allies would press on."

 hart.senate.10.desc: "The Diversity in Education Act has come before both houses of Congress. This act aims to solve the great gap between white and black people who pursue a higher education- and therefore the gap in white and black people equipped to pursue certain careers. To do this, the Act provides more funding to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) across the country, so they'll have the resources to admit more students and educate them better. For America to heal from the ugly legacy of bigotry, integration must move forwards."

This is a major blow to African-Americans everywhere as the benefits of equitable higher education seem more out of reach than ever. It's also a defeat for President Hart's agenda; the administration will have to redouble its efforts to create a more equitable America."

 hart.senate.13.t: "Introduction of The Urban Housing Opportunity Act"
 hart.senate.13.desc: "A new bill has been introduced to the United States senate. The Urban Housing Opportunity Act targets housing discrimination in America's cities, forbidding racial discrimination in housing sales and rentals. This legislation came in part in response to long-standing concerns of racial discrimination in housing markets that remained strong even as de jure desegregation waned nationwide.\n\nThis bill is a particular priority of HEW Secretary Jane Jacobs, not only as the issue fits within her purview of housing, but also due to support by an unnamed pen pal. President Hart, trusting Jacobs' instincts, has made the bill a priority for his administration. Now, the bill is left to the whims of the Senate."
 hart.senate.13.a: "Racism back in the sights."

 hart.senate.14.t: "The Urban Housing Opportunity Act Passes The Senate"
 hart.senate.14.desc: "The good news spread quickly across the country as Black, Hispanic, Asian and other racial minorities learned that at least some of their housing woes had ended. Gone, it seemed, were the days of open discrimination by landlords and realtors, hopefully harbingering further progress for these communities. Instead of being packed into majority-minority communities with the worst housing by discrimination, non-whites seeking housing would have a fuller market to search through for their preferred dwelling.\n\nThe legislation forbids discrimination in housing sales and rentals, making it a crucial tool for non-whites to build lasting wealth and secure proper housing for them and their families. Now, if a Black citizen can afford a house then they can buy it—no strings attached and with no racist standing in the way."
 hart.senate.14.a: "Stamping out hate."

 hart.senate.15.t: "The Urban Housing Opportunity Act Fails in The Senate"
 hart.senate.15.desc: "The sad news spread quickly throughout minority communities across America, even as jubilation among some White communities ensued. The Hart Administration's ambitious anti-discrimination plan for urban housing has failed, defeated by a Senate more concerned with the voices of reactionaries than the necessity of fairness and justice. The bill had drawn criticism from rightwing groups as the next step in 'the integration and degradation of America'.\n\nNow with the bill's defeat, progress seems to have stalled on this front at least. However, President Hart is determined to not give up his fight for justice in America even if the Senate is unwilling to support him in the struggle."

 hart.senate.16.desc: "The USDOC Modernization Act of [GetYear] has been introduced to Congress. While hardly drawing significant public attention, the bill has succeeded in drawing the attention of Washington bureaucrats and politicos, all of whom have opinions on the proposed reforms. Among other things, the USDOC Modernization Act will allow the Department of Commerce to work with states on establishing and keeping the highway program running on time.\n\nThe bill has the support of President Hart, who has described as a giant leap forward for both America and his transportation reform agenda. The bill now waits in the Senate as proponents and detractors trade favors and whip votes to secure Hart a victory or to send the bill to an ignominious defeat."
 hart.senate.16.a: "Time for a change."

 hart.senate.17.desc: "Applause engulfed the senate as the final necessary vote for approving the bill was tallied. The Department of Commerce could be modernized and reformed as soon as President Hart signed the bill which was already on its way to his desk. The opponents of the bill, disappointed by their failure, clapped along glumly.\n\nThe bill's passage is an important moment for all Americans. With President Hart's wide-ranging reform plans touching every part of American life, particularly transport and commerce, a modern and efficient Department of Commerce is critical. Due to the bill's passage, the Hart Administration will be able to work with states and get truly into the fine details of future reforms and improve their implementation."

If you want, we can reach out and see if there's a path forward..." The aide trailed off as he saw a look of sadness cross Philip Hart's face. He withdrew, leaving the commander-in-chief alone with his thoughts.\n\nThis would complicate matters, Hart realized, with the outdated structure of the Department of Commerce hampering necessary coordination with the states. While it was still possible for him to complete his agenda, it had just gotten a lot more difficult. Nevertheless, he would soldier on."

 hart.senate.22.desc: "The Administration's allies in Congress today introduced the next key piece of President Hart's agenda, the Arm Control and Indexing Act. The bill establishes federal standards on gun possession, forbidding the sale and possession of arms to felons, drug addicts and the mentally incompetent. The Act also requires that any individual or business involved in the sale of firearms must register with the federal government with further limitations placed on interstate transfers of weapons.\n\nThe bill has been controversial, with gun rights advocates calling it a tyrannical power grab. For President Hart, however, it is simply a necessary step in tackling urban crime, exacerbated by the unregulated sale of weapons, often across state lines. If the American city is to prosper, it must first be peaceful."
 hart.senate.22.a: "A silver bullet against crime?"

 hart.senate.23.t: "The Arm Control and Indexing Act of [GetYear] Passes The Senate"
 hart.senate.23.desc: "Urban reformers, healthcare professionals and crime fighters nationwide today celebrated as an ambitious piece of gun control legislation passed through the Senate. With the bill on its way to President Hart's desk, it seems that the fortunes of American cities seem set to soar. Prohibiting sales to and possession of weapons to criminals and addicts, limiting interstate transfers and regulating firearms sellers would all be key steps in the government's struggle with urban crime.\n\nWith many Americans alarmed at rising crime, the new legislation comes as welcome news. Thanks to President Hart's efforts, criminals will be unable to get their hands on dangerous weapons and presumably rates of gun crime will begin to drop as the law's effects are felt. For tonight at least, President Hart and his administration can rejoice in a victory."

Failing to garner majority support, the bill foundered on conservative opposition. Though it may have struck a blow against crime, such a question is now left to historians as the legislation has been abandoned, at least temporarily.\n\nThis is naturally a disappointment to President Hart, coming as a blow to his program of urban renewal. There is little he can do but lick his wounds, learn his lesson and keep his nose to the grindstone. Philip Hart had resolved to persist, regardless of the setbacks."

 hart.senate.25.desc: "A critical bloc of the Hart voting coalition is the labor union. Walter Reuther has been a thankless ally in many of President Hart's congressional battles, and now has been deemed the time for the favor to be repaid. The Cooperative Act, a resolution declaring the American government's support of workers over employers, sans certain extreme circumstances. This is a big move, solidifying the strong connection recently forged between the federal government and the labor unions.\n\nThe resolution is supported mostly by the Democratic side of the Coalition, with accompanying support from the Progressives in the Pact. Even with this bipartisan favor, the Cooperative Act faces serious hurdles. Conservative Republicans and activists are frothing at the mouth, eager to denounce the resolution and its supporters as borderline socialists, with the encouragement of numerous powerful business executives from the sidelines. No matter, the administration remains confident in the resolution's ability to pass, but its fate lies in the hands of Congress."

 hart.senate.26.t: "The Cooperative Act of [GetYear] Passes The Senate"
 hart.senate.26.desc: "After contentious debates from both in and outside Congress, the Cooperative Resolution has become the Cooperative Act.\n\nThis accomplishment serves as a big break for the Hart administration and their labor allies, providing a critical pillar of support for employees seeking litigation against their employers. As such, industrial heartlands are now singing the praises of President Hart and his Republican-Democratic Coalition, and union men are breathing with a bit more power."

While not entirely unexpected, this remains a setback for the administration.\n\nUnions are mildly upset with the administration for promising and failing to deliver, while conservatives in Congress are upset it was even on the table. Now, the Hart administration will work on repairing relationships and burnt bridges, and return to the drawing board, determined to help the American worker."

Fought for by welfare lovers and military hawks alike, a broad coalition has brought the plight of many veterans to Capitol Hill.\n\nEdward Lansdale, Secretary of Defense, became an adamant activist for the bill in the White House. Hart, convinced by Lansdale's rhetoric of supporting those who fight for America in its most darkest hour, fought for its consideration by the Senate. Now, with debate ongoing, Congress will decide the future of the veterans."

This is a big moment for the Hart administration, and more importantly, America's veterans."

 hart.senate.30.t: "The Forever GI Bill Fails in The Senate"
 hart.senate.30.desc: "Floundering in the Senate, the Forever GI Bill has been left for dead. Ballooning concerns and earmarks turned the bill into a pissing contest between parties and factions. The result was, unfortunately for the administration, a rejection for the bill in its entirety. Veterans are shocked, and enraged. They feel they put their body on the line for America, and America gives them nothing in return. Unfortunately for them, no change seems to be on the horizon.\n\nActivists merely point at this chain of events to showcase how deadlocked Congress has become. By failing to pass such a slam dunk bill, how could they be trusted with the security and well-being of the whole nation? If veterans aren't cared for, what can the government even do?\n\nPresident Hart looks to move on, not letting this failure falter the rest of his agenda."

Championed by Jane Jacobs, inspired by her Pen Pal, who asserted that many students rely on school lunches to be reliably fed. Hungry students are poor learners and keeping bellies full might also help with behavioral problems that can plague schools.\n\nPassing the law is also of course the right thing to do. No moral society should allow children to go hungry. Championed by the left, supported by the center, and grudging tolerated on the right, with opposition muted to fiscal hawks on the fringes, the bill seems sure to achieve a majority."

Now the law wings its way to be signed by President Hart, another brick in his legacy. Jane Jacobs is naturally thrilled, eager to share the victory with her friend, the Pen Pal.\n\nThe positives resulting from the bill should be well apparent. Children know that by going to school they can get a full belly, for far too many an all too rare thing. Parents now have incentives to have their children attend school and well-fed children will be better behaved and more attentive. And above all, America is living up to its promise, of justice for all."
 hart.senate.32.a: "Who wouldn't vote to feed hungry children?"

 hart.senate.33.t: "The Primary Course Meal Act Fails in The Senate"
 hart.senate.33.desc: "Disgust roiled the nation as a fragmented Senate failed to pass the Primary Course Meal Act. President Hart sternly criticized the Senate's decision as "a devastatingly foolish choice", warning them that they bore responsibility for hundreds of thousands of children going hungry. The failure of the legislation has harmed the morale of the Hart administration, with many deeply questioning what was wrong with their government.\n\nThe bill had foundered on the racism of the far-right, who saw too many black faces among the crowd of hungry children for their liking, as well as the ideology of the fiscal hawks, unable to see the dollar lost for penny earned in starving America's next generation. Whatever the Senate does next, it will surely be better than this low."

 hart.senate.34.desc: "Historically educational standards and curriculums have been a patchwork affair, decided most often by a local school board or occasionally by a state legislature. This state of affairs, while respectful of the states' and schools' autonomy, also contributes to uneven standards where the quality of education can vary wildly from place to place. The Hart administration, with its supporters in Congress, have vowed to change this.\n\nLeading the charge for the bill is Jane Jacobs, the HEW Secretary and a former teacher. Naturally, she has a vested interest in the quality of America's schools. The law will present a basic, standardized curriculum to guarantee every American receives a quality education, guaranteeing state and local compliance with federal funds."

 hart.senate.35.desc: "Teachers, children, and parents across the country rejoiced as news spread that the National Education Act had passed. With a standardized curriculum and improved facilities, materials, and training America's schools will soon be world-class. This is important not only to keep our country strong with an educated, capable population but also to guarantee every American child a decent education, their basic right. With the bill's passage, the Hart administration can celebrate another victory in its mission to improve America."

 hart.senate.36.t: "The National Education Act Fails in The Senate"
 hart.senate.36.desc: "Disappointment prevailed among teachers and parents across the country amid news that the National Education Act had failed. The causes for the bill's failure are complex, with liberals and centrists blaming one another for various flaws of the bill, the teachers' unions apathetic to the whole enterprise and conservatives and other rightwingers energized by what they viewed as an immense power grab by the federal government. Although the Senate has failed to guarantee children a standardized curriculum or quality education President Hart will continue to work to ensure justice."

 hart.senate.37.desc: "The Urban Renewal Initiative is one of the most ambitious programs in American history. Its size, and expense, has caused many potential cities to balk at participating. In order to guarantee local participation and compliance, the America Invests Act moves many of the program's costs to the federal government, keeping the balance books of cities relatively unaffected.\n\nThe bill comes after considerable debate within the Hart Administration. Vice President Chep Morrison succeeded in convincing President Hart to support it on the grounds that the federal government should not be sticking cities with an enormous bill from a federally-initiated program. The America Invests Act thus carries a hefty price tag and must survive the Senate before it can actually help anyone."
 hart.senate.37.a: "Will America invest?"

 hart.senate.38.desc: "Applause rang out through the Senate as the America Invests Act received the final vote necessary for passage. The bill will now be shuttled across Washington to be signed by President Hart in a great victory for his administration and the URI. This is an important night for American cities as it guarantees their budgets will remain in their own hands, not crushed beneath the costs of the URI's projects. Urban Renewal is a cause for good, and this law cements that with the federal government's largesse."

Failing to surmount the critiques of fiscal hawks and conservatives while also weakened by division among the RDC, the law did not receive the necessary support from the legislature.\n\nWithout federal financial aid contained within the bill, America's cities will continue to exist under the threatening shadow of enormous debt from the URI programs, despite existing aid.This disappointment is a severe one, posing a great challenge to President Hart's agenda. All he can do however, is dust himself and continue working. President Hart will persist"

 hart.senate.40.desc: "The Urban Commitment Act has been introduced to Congress by leading members of the Republican-Democratic Coalition. The bill proposes splitting the bill on the URI's costs between the cities and the federal government with options for debt relief. This bill supposedly comes following major lobbying by Vice President Chep Morrison, who argued that fiscal responsibility required cost-sharing. While some mayors have complained at the increased costs, most are very happy to have the federal government as a partner guaranteeing many of the costs. Now, the bill must survive the Senate or the cities will be in deep trouble."
 hart.senate.40.a: "The responsible option."

 hart.senate.41.t: "The Urban Commitment Act Passes The Senate"
 hart.senate.41.desc: "City governments across the country released excited press releases today, lauding the Senate's passage of the Urban Commitment Act. The bill, already on its way to be signed by President Hart, offers a bright future for many American cities. With the federal government assisting with many of the costs from the URI, city budgets will not undergo major pressure or accrue significant debt. The URI can only succeed so long as the cities withstand the fiscal pressure, however with this bill that should no longer be an issue. President Hart and his administration can rejoice at a bright future for the country and his own flagship project."

 hart.senate.42.t: "The Urban Commitment Act Fails in The Senate"
 hart.senate.42.desc: "Mayors across the country, and many within the Hart Administration, cursed the Senate today as the Urban Commitment Act was defeated by Senate opposition. A motley coalition of conservatives, fiscal and debt hawks, as well as other rightwing malcontents successfully forced the failure of the bill, exploiting divisions and weaknesses among the RDC. Many American city-goers are alarmed at the news, aware that their cities face major expenses and the lack of guardrails for debt relief persist.\n\nPresident Hart was naturally distraught at the bill's failure, however he must carry on with his work. The URI is too big to be sunk by the failure of one piece of legislation. Moreover, one defeat, however great, is no excuse for laziness or inaction."

 hart.senate.43.desc: "Up until now, the Urban Renewal Initiative has not reached even a fraction of America's urban population. With the pilot programs established by the Hart Administration have shown promising results, it is now time to implement the President's agenda across the nation. The Urban Renewal Expansion Act will drastically expand the scale and budget of the Initiative, enrolling all incorporated municipalities in the United States. The lion's share of urban renewal efforts shall be directed at America's blighted megapoli - New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Saint Louis. These were once the beating heart of American civilization, and under Hart's watch, they shall become so again.\n\nNaturally, the Act has quickly become enemy #1 for the President's opponents. Millions of voters in white suburbia view his efforts with suspicion, and many Senators in the NPP's Nationalist Caucus have stoked these fears for their own political gain. The President has martialled as much of his political capital in the Senate as he is able to, reaching out to both the RDC and progressive members of the NPP in order to get the Bill through the door. The stakes could not be higher, for a defeat here could bring President Hart's entire agenda crashing to the ground."

No longer will the Hart Administration's Urban Renewal Initiative be just another dream confined to a few pilot programs, but shall now encompass every municipality in the nation. The long-suffering inhabitants of America's inner cities now have a bright future to look forward to, as decades of urban planning and policy shall be rewritten. Urban renewal is coming, whether the President's opponents like it or not.\n\nAnd dislike it they shall, for the Bill's passage has already provoked an uproar among the self-appointed representatives of "Middle America." The NPP's demagogues have now pledged to assemble a coalition of "concerned citizens" against President Hart. Unfortunately, their rhetoric may find fertile ground, for many well-off Democratic voters in the suburbs are now beginning to question which constituencies the Party truly serves."

An outcry of grief has erupted among the crowd that has gathered outside the Capitol as the news has spread throughout the nation. The Hart Administration's Urban Renewal Initiative has been crippled before it could truly get off the ground. The long-suffering inhabitants of America's inner cities will have to endure continued urban decay and immiseration. Urban renewal has been shown as yet another fantasy of political idealists out of touch with reality.\n\nOf course, there are many in "Middle America" who see the Bill's failure as a welcome relief from the uncertainty that President Hart's agenda brings. The NPP's demagogues are already celebrating their sabotage of the Urban Renewal Initiative, and millions of white suburbanites are now starting to see them as the best guarantors of their interests. The Hart Administration still hopes the URI's present activity will exert a long-term influence over urban planning, but this may be just a bitter conciliation."

 hart.senate.46.desc: "With the introduction of the Municipality Housing Act, Secretary Jacob's ambitious agenda faces its most daunting trial yet. This Act would provide significant grant funding to municipalities for the construction, maintenance, and expansion of public housing projects over decades, supplying affordable housing to millions of underserved Americans while allowing local communities to reclaim their spaces from unscrupulous developers.\n\nAs to be expected, the budget hawks have taken immediate offense to this bill, denouncing it as a "bottomless pit" of expenditure that threatens to forever cripple America's financial health. Senator Barry Goldwater has been particularly harsh in his critiques of it, labeling the plan as an importation of "Soviet-style socialism" into America's cities. Even Governor George Romney has been reluctant to support the bill, fearing the encroachment of potentially corrupt and out-of-touch municipal governments into the public sphere.\n\nHart will have to fall back on his allies in the Democratic Party and the scattered NPP Progressive Caucus while he tries to flip enough seats across the aisle to get the bill through. God only knows if it will succeed."

The Municipality Housing Act has passed the Senate, and is on its way to President Hart's desk. Already, citizens across the country are feeling relief that their municipal government will have the funding to construct and maintain affordable housing in perpetuity. Many had thought that Secretary Jacobs' plan was too ambitious, that it would never get past the budget hawks and representatives of white suburban interests. Today, the naysayers have been proven dead wrong. America's cities shall once again be places one can make a living in, and it's the Hart Administration that made it happen.\n\nAlready, Hart's opponents are making noises about shutting down public housing construction in contested sights. They may shout until they are blue in the face about "concerned citizens," but the President may rest easy knowing the support this program has in many municipal governments."

Despite all its best efforts, the Municipality Housing Act has not won enough votes to pass the Senate. Secretary Jacobs' ambitious plan may have been a step too far after all. Today, the budget hawks may celebrate a hard-won victory over the upstart from Manhattan, and the legions of NIMBYs can rest easy knowing that their property shall remain undisturbed.\n\nWho then, will speak for the millions of Americans abandoned on the street, or trapped in shoddy tenements? Perhaps they will have to wait for another to champion their cause, for Secretary Jacobs has been tested, and has been found unworthy. President Hart, of course, will have to proceed with his agenda despite this failure. Surely there must be some other policy Congress is more willing to accept?"

 hart.senate.49.desc: "The drafting of the Rebuild the Ghettos Act was a tough compromise. Originally desiring a much more ambitious expansion of the URI, President Hart was forced to pare down his ambitions in order to produce something that was more likely to get through the Senate. Produced with the advice of Governor George Romney of the Republicans, the Act would fund the construction of thousands of new public housing projects under the auspices of the Federal Housing Administration - to be turned over to public land trusts upon completion. This approach leaves much to be desired, both in how it excludes municipal governments from the decisionmaking process and makes no provision for maintenence and future construction.\n\nDespite this, the Act still represents a game-changer for the millions of Americans unable to afford a roof over their heads. Both the President and Governor Romney are confident it will significantly contribute to the URI's ambitious poverty reduction targets, and a surprising number of Republicans have been on board with the proposal. Of course, the bill has still earned the ire of hardcore fiscal conservatives and the vulgar populists of the NPP's Nationalist Caucus, who claim that the bill is an undue imposition on the "average American homeowner." Despite this, President Hart does not think it likely that the bill will fail to pass."

This plan has won support among a wide swath of the Democrats' urban constituency, as it offers much-needed relief to their lives and pocketbooks. Of course, some NIMBYs are still making noises about "government overreach" and "property values," but those complaints will inevitably be sent into the dustbin of history.\n\nOf course, there are those who worry this act does not go far enough. Jane Jacobs fears the NHA will end up repeating the same mistakes the modernists did when they tore through the fabric of urban communities with their ill-conceived projects. Plus, there is the fact that the long-term future of these housing initiatives is uncertain, as after their completion they will be converted to public land trusts and municipal governments will shoulder the burden of maintaining them, but without any financial support to do so. Perhaps, decades in the future, these once-new projects shall also decay and require replacement."

Somehow, Hart's opponents have managed to halt even the moderate Romney-sponsored compromise plan in its tracks. Commentators across America are reeling from this startling political upset, as the failure of the Act shows how little support remains for President Hart's agenda. Already, NIMBYs and right-wing populists across America are cheering as their great political enemy has been dealt a crippling blow.

Drafted by Senator Ted Kennedy in close coordination with the Hart Administration and Labor Unions, the bill aims to provide healthcare coverage to all Americans through a single-payer system.\n\nThe NHIA has already received widespread criticism from many organizations, including the American Medical Association. Conservatives in Congress have already denounced the legislation as merely another attempt at socialized medicine.\n\nThe fight for universal healthcare coverage has flummoxed Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Wheeler.

Placing harsh sanctions on the members of the Einheitspakt, the Embargo Act will aim to further isolate Germany from American markets, closing loopholes to Pakt nations and harshly penalizing any American business attempting to subvert them.\n\nThe Act has received broad support; its co-sponsors on the hill run the gamut from Barry Goldwater to Scoop Jackson and is widely expected to pass with little opposition when Congress convenes."

 hart.crimewave.1.desc: ""Next to appear before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the Crime Bill of [GetYear] is Mr. Bayard Rustin. Sir, you may begin your testimony." The chairman of the committee said as Rustin prepared his notes. He had only one chance to make his point, and knew his skin color would disadvantage him with at least a few of those present.\n\n"Thank you, Mr. Chairman," Rustin replied, overcoming any remaining nerves and launching into his speech, "I have come to speak today about the negative effects of the bill being proposed. I understand my fellow citizens' anxiety regarding crime and violence but feel drawn to oppose this law. As written, the legislation is overbroad and will lead to overpolicing of particular neighborhoods with no corresponding decrease in crime."\n\nAs he spoke, he watched the committee members' faces, noting contempt or amusement on the more right wing members of the committee member, while polite concern was plastered across the others' visages. He felt a growing pit in his stomach. Not enough of them were listening, or even cared at all.\n\nWatching a televised broadcast of the testimony, Philip Hart was also concerned, though for different reasons. He had not anticipated civil rights activists' opposition to his crime bill. Didn't they know they could trust him not to harm their communities?\n\nDoubt flickered to life within him. He had read the bill and to his eyes nothing had been out of place, no provisions blaringly flawed or miswritten. This was just the usual D.C. hullabaloo, he resolved, and switched off the television, returning to his work. There was nothing to worry about."

A new crime bill had passed, vastly increasing police budgets, and donuts were now a common occurrence at the precinct.\n\n"All right fellas, listen up," Sergeant Roscoe Zebrowski, a grizzled veteran of the force, said as he entered. He reached the front of the room, made sure all were listening and began reading from a clipboard.\n\n"Starting today, as part of the new city and state statutes in accordance with the Federal Crime Bill, we have new offenses to be on the lookout for. Loitering is arrest-worthy, as are littering, jaywalking, minor vandalism, speeding, drinking in public..." He read on and on. The cops' smiles, twisting as they munched their treats, had only widened as he went on reading.\n\n"Unit three, we have store owners on Lexington and King complaining of loitering. They describe a half-dozen black youths, estimated ages sixteen to twenty."\n\n"Copy dispatch. Request backup as we approach." The radio squaked an affirmative as Patrolman Cliff Ford swung his cruiser towards the loiterers. A group of young men, standing in a circle talking, looked around in surprise, then horror, to see a police car barreling towards them.\n\n"Hands in the air!" Cliff roared as he exited from his car, already nervous at being outnumbered. Scared, mystified, the men, boys in truth, complied. Calling for back-up, Officer Ford summoned a paddy wagon to transport them to lock-up. Finally, the city would get the clean-up it needed, Cliff thought as he responded to another call from dispatch. The work never stopped, but it was worth doing."

When the police stopped me, I thought it was a joke. I tried to walk away, but they hit me and threw me to the ground where they handcuffed me. I spent six months in prison and have not been able to get a job since."\n\n"I didn't do anything. The cops say I was drinking in public, but it was water. Of course, they waited until my bottle was empty to confront me. When they took me to jail, I thought something was wrong; this used to be the kind of thing you handled with a fine. I spent four months in the county jail. I lost my job and was evicted from my apartment. I don't know what I'm going to do."\n\n"My husband was arrested for speeding. He worked long shifts and was always excited to come home to his family afterwards and would sometimes rush. When he called me, I thought it was a horrible joke but it was actually the last time I ever spoke to him. He died in prison, a heart attack when he was a week away from freedom, and since he was a Black man no one important seems to care. I don't know what you can do, Mr. Rustin, but I hope you can do something."\n\nBayard Rustin nearly dropped the letter as he reached the final line. He saw clearly the jaggedness of the words appear as the writer struggled to control her emotions. His head in his hands, he felt like weeping. This was precisely what he had feared and what he had warned the country, Congress and the administration of. They had not listened to him, to the others who had warned them and his people, his community would pay for their arrogance."

 hart.crimewave.4.desc: ""Despite the Hart administration's bluster about urban reform and being tough on crime, recent FBI statistics show that crime has risen since President Hart took office and enacted his major crime bill. This is a natural result of President Hart's misplaced idealism and natural tendency towards being soft on crime. Criminals are emboldened and good citizens are afraid so long as the President is focused more on integration and city-planning than crime control..."\n\n"The growth in crime is particularly focused in petty crime, showing clearly that President Hart's efforts have emboldened, rather than petrified, the lowest criminals of America. The President's liberal fixations prevent him from recognizing the criminal as an enemy, instead blindly holding to his view of villain as society's victim..."\n\n"Whatever is driving the current rise in crime, Philip Hart is clearly not the man to meet it. One doesn't stop a criminal with a 'reformed infrastructure system' or a new welfare program. If you want to deal with a criminal, you put him in chains until their debt to society is paid, with a permanent solution for worse characters. Hart may live in a world where theory and ideas take precedence, but in the real world citizens are going to suffer and die because criminals are not being dealt with..."\n\n"Tonight on CBS news, we discuss the recent rise in crime. With us we have retired police chief Martin Short, Cincinnati Neighborhood Watch leader Fred Bingham, and Melvin Sheen, lead prosecutor for New York City. Gentleman, what is behind the recent rise in crime? "\n\n"Well, I'll tell you, the government and Phil Hart certainly don't seem to be helping out at all...""

We over-criminalized frankly, with many minor offenses now being counted as crimes of course the numbers spiked. Every litterer previously cited and fined is now spending time in jail." She paused to gather her thoughts and then continued.\n\n"You know the consequences of that, sir. Ordinary people doing bad, but formerly not criminal, things, getting swept up into the justice system and incarcerated. At the rate we're going, we'll have to build more prisons, the states are already starting to talk about overcrowding."\n\n"If you commit a crime, you should go to prison" Morrison said, taking the opportunity provided by another pause by Jacobs, "Maybe you're right that we have a bit of wheat in with the chaff but-"\n\n"Did you ever hear of Draco of Athens, Chep?" Hart asked, his rare interruption commanding immediate silence, "The first legislator of Athens, he made even many petty crimes punishable by death. When asked why, he replied he believed the crimes deserved such a punishment, and that he could not think of a worse one for more serious offenses."\n\nHart's words sank into his subordinates, his line of thinking clear. The two excused themselves, exchanging worried glances as behind them Hart's head sank, resting in his hands. He had made the comparison, revolted by it, and he worried he would bear Draco's mark into history."

Instead, the chaos of the world had trickled into the placid presidential retreat. Not a seat was wasted on the drive over, the secret service convoy halved due to its new gas budget.\n\nThe President's Daily Brief had begun in earnest, Philip sipping coffee from his American Legion mug. The briefing of the Reich was first, followed by the events affecting the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Then, various domestic issues. Most of them were, thankfully, mundane. Then came the updates on the oil crisis.\n\n"It's bad, Mister President." The aide informed him, "Many industries are suffering, as you are aware, but there has been an update."\n\nPhil raised an eyebrow, "Is that so?"\n\n"Yes, John Murray of the Association of American Railroads commissioned a report on the rail industry, and it yielded concerning results."\n\nThe aide pointed to the Manila folder, Hart opened it. He would have to read the report in full later, but glancing at it, Phil saw the opening sentence. 'The energy crisis to the railroads is like a Get Well Card from an undertaker. We have mixed feelings about it.' Hart sighed, thanked, and dismissed the aide. He could read the rest of the briefing later, but right now he needed to address this impending, figurative trainwreck."

Plastered on the front page in big bold lettering.\n\n"Six railroads file for Bankruptcy, more teetering on collapse!"\n\nHe read on. The collapse of the private railroad industry was already happening. The titans of the industry, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific had not yet faltered. However, everyone knew it was a matter of time. As did Hart. Phil harkened back to his phone call with Secretary Monroney.\n\n"I understand, Phil, our team will start drawing up contingency measures. I can come down and put on a presentation for the Cabinet when we're done."\n\nPhil bit down on his bagel once more. He heard murmurs from the Commerce Department, but nothing solid. Minutes later, he had Mike Monroney on the line.\n\n"Mike, have you seen the news?"\n\n"Yes, rest assured we'll have it for you by the end of the month."\n\n"You have until the next cabinet meeting," Phil commanded, essentially a euphemism to get it done now.\n\nPhil heard an audible sigh across the line, he was about to dress down the Secretary until Mike said, "We'll get it done, Mister President."\n\n"Good.""

"A simple three-word summary of the Commerce Department's strategy to solve the current railway crisis. It is a three-step process, first, we purchase bankrupt railway assets, and offer favorable buyouts to the ones on their last legs. It doesn't matter if they were a freight line or a passenger line, we'll buy it. Then, we put our current and acquired assets into one state-owned company, the Consolidated Rail Administration, ConRail for short. Lastly, while the bureaucracy is being sorted out, we undergo an extensive electrification process for rail lines across the country. Completely bypassing a train's dependence on oil!"\n\nAfter finishing the presentation, Mike opened the two-man floor to questions. Chep, comprising 50 percent of the audience, voiced his objections.\n\n"I understand these are desperate times, but this strategy is going to be costly, time-consuming, and put a target on our backs from the debt hawks in congress. You say you can get it done in a year, and generate profitability two years after that, but we don't have that kind of time."\n\nPhil set down his trusty American Legion mug, then responded to Chep. "The pamphlet Mike gave us was pretty thorough. I think we can assuage the fears of debt hawks, and, in this time of crisis, we can propel public transport to the forefront. However, I must concede that this is more of a stop-gap than a remedy to the underlying oil crisis."\n\nChep, sensing Hart's hesitation, jumped at the opportunity to rebuff him. "Right, If these railways are struggling to electrify in the first place, doesn't that mean they were destined to fail years before this oil crisis? It's the free market doing its job."\n\nPhil pondered the arguments laid out before him, and, after a minute of suspenseful silence, delivered his final verdict."

He wasn't the only one that had the idea of electrification. Many smaller companies, seeing their margins grow concerningly slim, started the process of electrification. According to the report, they had all gone bankrupt before they could complete the process.\n\nMike resolved himself to bring the issue up at the next cabinet meeting, but the window had passed. Bankruptcy had started to affect the mid-tier railways. It was a matter of time until the party was over. Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific stock had been nose-diving the entire day.

"Your records have really stood out, and we'd like to offer you the position of General Manager at the North Bergen Railyard. The salary is triple what you made with CSX. Are you interested?" 30 thousand dollars was a hefty paycheck...life-changing hefty. Abdul eagerly responded in the affirmative.\n\nThe man on the other end sounded just as enthused, "Wonderful! Come down to the Rail Yard at your earliest convenience to get the details sorted out." Abdul knew immediately that he could take the family to Disney World with that kind of salary! Without any regard for the pan of mushrooms being cooked, Abdul took his wife by surprise and kissed her on the lips. Then, as he pulled back, he yelled. "No need to cook tonight, honey!

You saying you'll change things doesn't mean it'll change."\n\nHart blinked. "I, ah- yes. Of course." Reuther started the walk again. "I'm sorry, Mr. President. I got carried away there. But the fact is that the workers here are tired of hearing politicians promise they'll change things. I know you're not just talk, but solving this issue takes more than good intentions. It's a complicated problem and a lot of powerful people want it to stay that way."\n\nHart set his jaw, and nodded. "Well, then, Mr. Reuther, I look forwards to working with you to solve it." Reuther smiled."

 hart.reuther.3.desc: "Reuther and the President stared out at Lake Michigan. It should have been beautiful, but the blue sky was filled with smog and the waters were an unhealthy green. "You remember the early days?" Reuther asked. "We were both consumer advocates, weren't we? Always grinding and hustling for the people who needed us." Hart nodded. "I think we'll need some of that energy for the battles to come," he offered.\n\n"In the interests of that," Reuther said, "I wanted to meet you today to talk about the first big blow we'll strike. I've been talking to Senator Nelson- you know Gaylord, right?- about a new bill we've been thinking up that can really make a dent in this pollution problem we've been dealing with." Hart wrinkled his nose as a car roared by, its exhaust assaulting his nostrils. "If it'll help me not have to smell that anymore," Hart said, "I'm all for it."\n\n"We're speaking the same language," Reuther said. "That smell's from the lead in the gasoline. Don't think I have to tell you that the lead's bad news. Gaylord's proposing to ban all leaded gasoline and impose limits on emissions. That'll work wonders on cutting down on this smog. Do we have the Oval Office's support on this?" Hart gave what he hoped was a vigorous nod."

The sound of Walter Reuther's voice was familiar to the President by now.\n\n"Mr. Reuther, I'm calling to deliver some very good news. The bill that we were working on with Gaylord looks set to pass both houses of Congress. It should be on my desk to sign by tomorrow." Hearing himself say that made him smile; it was one small step forwards, but a better America for all seemed that much more in reach. "And when I sign it I want you to be right there next to me. We'll show America that the labor movement and the Hart White House are working hand in hand for the people and the environment."\n\nHe could hear Reuther's smile through the phone. "I would be honored, Mr. President. I'll be doing everything I can to promote this success to anyone who'll listen. We'll get this country pushing forwards with us for a green future.""

He knew that he'd have to be making calls like this when he set out to become President, but it didn't make it any easier. "Mr. President? What can I do for you?" It was Walter Reuther's voice on the other end of the line.\n\n"I'm calling you, Mr. Reuther, to apologize," Hart said. "Despite everything, we weren't able to push this pollution bill through Congress. I'm going to be pushing for what we can salvage- Hubert thinks we'll be able to make something solving the leaded gas issue work- but whatever we pass won't be close to what we first discussed. You gave me your support, and I couldn't make it happen. All I can say is sorry."\n\n"Mr. President, this isn't the first time an ally of mine hasn't been able to give me all I wanted," Reuther replied. "Happens all the time. I could have done more myself- gotten my people to put more grassroots pressure on those beltway types. We both need to be ready to fight harder than ever to get what America needs from us passed."\n\n"Really, It's all Congress's fault," Hart said. "They don't see what has to be done to prevent disaster in our cities. They'll have to see this issue through someday." He could almost hear Reuther's shrug on the other end of the line."

 # T. Kennedy
 hart.kennedy.1.t: "The Lion and the Conscience"
 hart.kennedy.1.desc: "The President's Room. The Capitol's very own office for the POTUS, though often disregarded and disused in favor of the classic Oval Office. The current occupant found comfort in the room. Phil Hart was a senator for almost 10 years, a relatively short time in comparison to numerous other senators, but it held an important place in his heart. The Capitol building was the center of all that legislative chaos and politicking that Hart adored, and he reveled in the opportunity to stay connected to it. Most important to Hart, however, was the room's proximity to the chambers of his old friends, one of which was entering the room.\n\nTed Kennedy, before he even sat down on an ornate couch, began listing his agenda. Immigration reform, affirmative action and quotas, legislation for the disabled, large scale expansion of welfare services, and most importantly of all, a universal healthcare system. Hart looked at Kennedy right in the eyes, and sighed.\n\n"Ted, I don't know. There's a lot there, and I don't know if I can get that political capital in the cabinet." Kennedy didn't look disappointed. As Phil's protégé, Ted Kennedy shared many philosophies with the President. Along with the idealism characteristic of their brand of liberalism, was patience and caution. Don't push too far, as steady progress is better than no progress.\n\nPhil thought about their relationship. Phil was no stranger to friendships with his colleagues, but Ted's unabashed liberalism stood out. Phil looked back at Kennedy's wanting eyes, and began to speak. "Look, Ted. You've been such a good friend and a fantastic senator. We can figure something out." They both smiled, and talked about family."

 hart.kennedy.2.t: "The Price of Life"
 hart.kennedy.2.desc: ""Yesterday, the committee interviewed several pharmaceutical executives regarding the costs of certain medications, drugs, and tonics. Their testimony, in conjunction with the information gathered last week from Blue Cross Blue Shield show a clear problem in drug and treatment cost." As Ted talked, Phil wrote an assortment of thoughts on a stray piece of paper. "We really must do something about this!" Ted exclaimed, passionately. Phil looked up at him.\n\n"I already agree with you, save your energy for the Senate floor." Ted nodded, and slumped back in his seat, staring at the wall.\n\n"Yeah, I know. It's just this healthcare thing. Man, it's so screwed up!" Phil laughed. Watching a Kennedy grow into his own was something to behold. No longer was Ted just the youngest son of a large, prosperous New England family. He was a senator, a politician. A fighter, a dreamer. Hart broke his thoughts away, and began to question Kennedy once again. "What can I do to help? Who have you talked to?"\n\n"I've been working with Reuther, and he's pretty incensed about this whole thing too. He's on board with me here. We've been discussing what the healthcare reform is actually going to look like, and we think we reached an answer." Kennedy stopped, presumably for dramatic effect. It worked, and Phil raised his eyebrow in anticipation.\n\n"My proposal is a single-payer universal health insurance. It's a need for the American people." Hart was surprised. He didn't expect that big of a bill. But nonetheless, he would put his strength behind Kennedy."
 hart.kennedy.2.a: ""Let's heal America." Phil said."

 hart.kennedy.3.t: "Fight for Your Life"
 hart.kennedy.3.desc: "It was a busy day in the Senate. Well, busier than usual. Senator Ted Kennedy was to give a speech, his first since introducing his new health insurance bill. While he was no stranger to public speaking, Kennedy was still quite nervous. A lot was on the line here. Convincing a couple of senators would be the difference between free access to live-saving care, and a slew of preventable deaths. To prepare, Kennedy approached his old friend, the now President of the United States, Philip Hart.\n\nAs Kennedy began to speak, his anxieties melted away, subsumed by confidence. Hart leaned back in his chair, mentally taking notes. When Kennedy finished, looking up expectedly, Hart leaned forward and spoke. "Tone down the wording. Throw in some catnip for the moderates, make it palatable and all that." Kennedy nodded, looking down at his papers to think.\n\n"You're gonna kill it. You can get this through, I know that," said Phil. Ted looked back up at Phil.\n\n"Damn right. I'm not gonna let this chance pass me by." Satisfied with the show of young idealism, Phil flips Ted a pen, and the Kennedy quickly scribbles his revisions on the Resolute Desk before heading out the door."

 hart.kennedy.4.t: "Escaping From the Scene"
 hart.kennedy.4.desc: "A failed bill is nothing spectacular on the Hill. Most dreams eventually die, both Ted and Phil knew that going in. But regardless of expectations, the sting of defeat was present. Hart contemplated this when his phone rang, predictably Kennedy on the other side.\n\nA sigh preceded all words. "Hey, Phil. Yeah yeah, the bill failed. I've talked enough about that today." Kennedy said with a bit of an odd pep. "What's going on with Chep? He wanted to talk to me, but I didn't... I just... couldn't face him?" Ted said, his thin veneer of apathy cracking as he spoke his thoughts. "Phil, I'm sorry. I got your hopes up. And I could've done more to get it passed." Kennedy's voice cut out, and all that remained was the sound of the dead line. Hart didn't move.\n\nPoor Kennedy. Phil considered Ted an actual close friend beyond all the politicking and blarney that cloaked Washington, and he could tell the bill's failure affected Ted. The next day, after a morning debriefing, Hart trekked his way to the Senate chambers to console his friend in person. He tracked down Ted in another Senator's office, sharing a bottle of whiskey. After berating the other Senator and sending him away, Hart closed the door and stared at Kennedy.\n\n"This is just one battle. Yeah, we lost. And it's partly my fault. Hell, if you had talken to Chep, all you would've discussed would've been me! But failure happens, even to a President, and even to a Kennedy. Healthcare is your damned passion, don't you want to do something about it?" Kennedy nodded. "Then get your ass up and get back to work!" Phil exclaimed, finding a reservoir of hard-ass deep within. Kennedy rose, and reached for the phone."
 hart.kennedy.4.a: ""I'll talk to Walter.""

 hart.kennedy.5.t: "And the Dream Shall Never Die"
 hart.kennedy.5.desc: "Phil wasn't a particularly vibrant celebrator. He had a drink or two, gave his congratulations, and would go on his way. That trend would be broken on the date the National Health Insurance Act passed through the Senate floor. He had yet to sign it, but that was just a foregone conclusion for healthcare activists, policy gurus, liberal think tanks, and Colorado Senator Edward Kennedy.\n\nHart, after a small lunch with Janey, simply leaned against the Resolute, and waited. Ted finally called some 30 seconds after Phil began to wait. "Who is this?" Phil opened, bringing out a twinge of sarcasm that felt so very unfamiliar to his own ears. "Oh, it's just the guy who slapped the best damn healthcare bill possible on your damn shiny desk!" Ted cried out, sounding the teensiest bit tipsy. Before Hart could respond, another voice chimed in. "Darn right!" in an oh-so familiar Cajun accent. "Chep is with you? Ah, now it's a party!" Phil joked. Mixed laughter radiated from the other end.\n\n"Hell yeah, I had to see the kid who managed to make every conservative interest group from Greenland to California piss their pants with my own damn eyes. Good job to us all! Sincere congratulations, Phil. And to you, kid!" came an equally slurred ramble. Hart could almost hear Chep slap Kennedy on the shoulder.\n\n"Calm down you two!" "Ahhh, screw that! You're the one who is sitting on his fat ass and not even drinking!" Kennedy screamed back. Hart moved the phone a bit away from his ear, though it may have been a bit too late to save him from minor hearing loss. "Okay, okay. I'll celebrate, but not right now. I want to talk to you." said Hart.\n\nAfter Chep left, Kennedy and Hart simmered down and enjoyed each other's company. "I really am proud of you, Ted. You've done great stuff for America." Ted's sincere smile permeated through the telephone, as he replied. "Thank you, Phil. That means a lot coming from you." Phil smiled right back."
 hart.kennedy.5.a: ""Keep up the good work, Ted. You've got a lot more ahead.""

 # Rustin
 hart.rustin.1.t: "Second Opinions"
 hart.rustin.1.desc: "Jane Jacobs had, since being sworn in as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, been required to make a great many phone calls. After so many politicians, businessmen, and "concerned citizens", it was good to finally be on the phone with someone she respected as much as Bayard Rustin. "Mr. Rustin, it's an honor to speak with you," she said. "Your work has been a big inspiration to me and to many others. I'm just calling to let you know that the administration is eager to work with you on any and all urban issues."\n\n"I was glad to hear of your selection, Ms. Jacobs," Rustin replied. "To have someone like you in such a high office gives me hope that we could start seeing some real progress. But while I have a lot of hope for what you could achieve, I also have some concerns I'd like to share with you."\n\nJacobs blinked, unsure of what was to come. "Please. We're always happy to listen."\n\n"Obviously, I stand for workers of all races," Rustin said. "But the fact is that there's a serious legacy of inequality that needs to be addressed with the black working class. If solutions in black neighborhoods aren't tailored for the specifics of their situations, African-Americans could end up left behind. I want to make sure all this urban renewal doesn't just focus on white neighborhoods."\n\nJacobs' first instinct was to bite back something about how of course she wouldn't neglect any black neighborhoods. But Rustin had experience with that sort of disappointment- certainly more than she did. "Thank you for the suggestion, Mr. Rustin. I'll discuss your thoughts with the President, and get back to you.""
 hart.rustin.1.a: "A new era."

 hart.rustin.2.t: "Forwarding A Suggestion"
 hart.rustin.2.desc: ""...so that, in a nutshell, is his concern," Jacobs said, sitting across from President Hart and the Vice President. "I really think we should listen to his concerns. If we try to help black neighborhoods in a top-down way, not taking their concerns into account, we don't just risk our policies being ineffective- we could alienate them altogether."\n\n"Alienate them?" Chep Morrison snorted. "What're they gonna do- vote for the Nationalists? Look, we're professionals, we know what we're doing. I saved the colored people of New Orleans- what's Bayard Rustin done compared to that? I say we do what we always were gonna do, and fix these cities!"\n\nJacobs bristled; she was about to offer a harsh retort when the President spoke up. "Dismissing the concerns of some of our most loyal- and desperate- supporters is not the way to make this country a better place, Chep," Hart said. He turned to Jacobs. "Jane, you've talked to Rustin before, and you have the most experience in this area. I'd like you to meet with him, hear out his ideas in more detail. Let's see what he can bring to the table. This meeting is adjourned.""
 hart.rustin.2.a: ""Yes, Mr. President.""

 hart.rustin.3.t: "Declined"
 hart.rustin.3.desc: ""The most important thing to keep in mind about public housing is that if there's any room at all for a loophole, someone will use it to keep colored people." Jacobs took notes as Bayard Rustin spoke to her over the phone. "I think that, to be effective, your people need to be proactively monitoring public housing and, where people are being excluded, working against that."\n\n"That's very useful, thank you," Jacobs said. "Something I'd been meaning to ask you- President Hart wants to present a united front against everyone opposed to our agenda. He'd be delighted to meet with you in public, show the whole country that we're working together."\n\nA few beats of silence on the other end of the line. Then Rustin spoke again. "I appreciate the invitation, Ms. Jacobs. But I'm afraid I'll have to decline. I trust that the President wants the best for colored people. But too much public association between us could bring him some... unwanted attention."\n\nJacobs rose her eyebrows. "I don't follow."\n\nRustin sighed. "All I'll say is that I trust the President to do what's right without me standing by his side. I don't want to take any glory. I just want him to make this country better for us all. And if he doesn't... they'll be there to remind him of his promises.""

 USA_hart_68_the_hart_presidency_desc: "FDR, Eisenhower, Kefauver, JFK, LBJ. These titans of modern American politics, despite their disparate backgrounds, shared a Dream. Ask any two men what it looks like and you'll get three different answers: for some, it is the prosperity of every American, as was promised in the Declaration of Independence. For others, it is the right to breathe freely knowing that your air is clean and your cities are safe. A much-maligned third, from South to North, saw true liberation despite the odds arrayed against them. Dissimilar yet beautiful and optimism unbridled, their Dream glows like a bright red torch, tendered from keeper to keeper so that it may someday reach its rightwise cauldron.\n\nIn 1968, when the flame seems at its weakest, the Master of the Senate passed his torch to its Conscience. Many may take Philip Hart for a staid, unassuming heir, enforcing the party line and not much else. But civil rights and gun laws are only the least of what the new President has planned. His interpretation of the Dream envisions long, winding roads and rails that extend across the continent from cities built brick-to-mortar with its people in mind. It imagines a nation where crime is an option, rather than a necessity. It yearns for a chance to harness America's awesome potential and direct it towards the betterment of all. The path Hart has built for himself seems harder than it should, but the path of good is always hard, else it was never good to begin with.\n\nHail to the new Chief as we bid farewell to the old. Hail to the bright new day that beckons for the nation's heart and soul. But above all: Hail to the American Dream, ever deferred yet ever in sight."
 USA_hart_68_old_friends_new_dynamic_desc: "America's highest legislature knew Hart for his unwavering, almost headstrong commitment to civil rights and the little man. No plea for moderation deterred him from becoming one of Kennedy's most loyal bannermen during the Birmingham Campaign, and no plea for unity kept him from voicing his dissent at every attempt to wring money out of welfare when the people need them most. The lengths to which Hart defended his principles earned not just the admiration of his like-minded peers but also the begrudging respect of his opponents. States may flip and parties may switch, the saying went, but you can always rely on Hart to do the right thing. He campaigned assuming such a reputation will translate to multi-partisan support for his presidential agenda.\n\nThat... has not necessarily come to pass. His erstwhile peers, it seemed, expect differently of a President than of a Senator. His Republican acquaintances kept their congratulations courteous but coldly brief; the Progressives that once joined him for lunch had scheduled no visits since his November victory. The less said of the Nationalists, the better. Even his own party, once in lockstep behind his plans, now cautioned restraint over "reckless" initiatives. The whiplash surprised Hart into several days of quiet reflection.\n\nIt will take the new President time to plan around his title's obsolescence, but he is confident he will soon adjust. He can't despair now when so much hangs on the balance."
 USA_hart_68_cuffed_to_the_chair_desc: "Mark Twain may have said that the man who wants to be President the most is also the last man who deserves it. Therefore, the last man who wants to be President is the man America needs, and so must be dragged kicking and screaming all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue so he can save the country from itself.\n\nAlthough Hart sees a man and not a cure-all in the mirror, "kicking and screaming" aptly describes his experience in the campaign trail. Party insiders had egged him for years to toss his hat, and he eventually did so only because he had no choice: the alternative to running was standing aside while conniving men dismantle the causes he championed piecemeal. All he did was say his piece as his allies dragged him from soapbox to soapbox and finally to the Resolute Desk. Dreams took him here but what comes after that? The sheer breadth of answers can paralyze even the most stalwart idealist.\n\nEnter deLesseps Morrison. The man who brought New Orleans to the modern age spent a decade making big plans out of big dreams, and in his Creole wisdom the Vice President suggests hearkening to FDR's first Hundred Days. For now EO's are the way to go, mainly to establish agencies that the administration will rely on down the line."
 USA_hart_68_some_lip_service_desc: "President Hart awoke from the transition period learning some cold, hard truths about his new position. The first went by an old adage: "The President proposes, Congress disposes." The second taught him that political friends don't necessarily make for political allies. The third came right after Election Day, when he learned that there were more chickens and horses than elephants and donkeys in his old stomping ground. Now the President has fewer allies than friends; one miscalculated step, and Congress might be more keen on disposing than governing for the rest of his term.\n\nIt pains him to shelve much of his plans for the time being, but Hart knows better than anyone not to alienate a minority Congress this early on. As such his administration shall uphold bipartisanship -- with Marcantonio's Progressives, with Benson's Nationalists, with anyone who'd give him the time of day -- until the exact moment Congress so much as hints in favor of bolder legislation."
 USA_hart_68_saint_of_the_senate_desc: "The President reserved his Election Night champagne for when he was absolutely certain that he had a shot at fulfilling his ideas wholesale. Then Walter Cronkite announced a Republican-Democrat trifecta at 7:48 PM, and in the hours after that his campaign staff saw the logical result of substituting every gallon of Philip Hart's blood with 24 proof alcohol. After spending days making allies out of his friends within the coalition, President Hart now sits in the Oval Office knowing that both the people and the powers that be stand behind his back. There is no better feeling.\n\nFor a mandate this strong lets Hart begin his term with the transformative reforms he had promised to the voters and to himself. No need to tarnish them with compromise when he can go far just by doubling down. No need to hold back when pushing forwards without abandon is both the necessary and the politically expedient choice. Now he has set his eyes on the nation's homeless; with the Democrats to his left and the Republicans to his right, President Hart will give these listless souls the help they deserve but cannot grasp alone."
 USA_hart_68_coronation_week_desc: "The whirl of the inauguration may be behind the newfound Hart Administration, but that doesn't mean that the people of the nation are behind him too. After all, Hart is one of the most obscure figures to win the Presidency in the last century, and while the voters may have learned who he is as a politician, they certainly haven't seen much of him as a person yet. Only with a united nation behind him will Phil Hart be able to muster the kind of force needed for his agenda to pass smoothly, and the longer he can keep the honeymoon with the American people going, the better. An nation-spanning speaking tour may be just what the train needs to really get rolling out of the station.\n\nSimilarly important, however, will be the one-on-one meetings with influential RDC politicians whose states the tour will happen to pass through. Phil Hart is no bully, but he's no pushover either, and his hope that quiet persuasion will pay dividends will certainly be put to the test as he meets with those who can make or break his agenda. The President may not have friends on Capitol Hill anymore, but they certainly don't have to be his enemies."
 USA_hart_68_the_never_ending_campaign_desc: "President Hart's agenda calls for great change in the structuring of America and her metropolitan hearts. These centers of wealth, society, and power have evolved into snarled tangles of crime and poverty, their residents rushing down sidewalks for fear of muggings and sitting for hours in traffic jams. The American city is a miserable, gray, smoggy place, and that miserable snarl is also the backbone of America's economic base. Reaching in to untangle the web may have temporary consequences, and the President wouldn't want those short-term pains to impact America's long-term future in the shape of bad election seasons.\n\nThat, along with an abundance of general caution - the hand of the free market is a cruel beast - means that some money will be set aside for a rainy day. The party apparatus will not be set aside to rust, but will instead be maintained and prepared to help the popularity of both the President and his allies in the Senate. If times get troubled and the people begin to turn away from the Democratic promise, the party will be there to set them back on the right track - or, at least, to mitigate the damage."
 USA_hart_68_some_pixie_dust_desc: "To start the President's campaign of urban renewal, we have to begin digging at the surface. This early slate of ideas aren't meant to hack at the roots of poverty and crime, nor are they meant to turn the American metropolis into a well-planned haven of efficiency and prosperity. Their purpose, symbolic or surface-level as they may be, is to prove that Phil Hart is serious when he talks about change, prove that his ideas are common-sense and practical, and build some bridges in Congress before he gets into the meat of his ideas. The Clean Streets Act, as it stands, will serve as one of the first in a hopefully long line of legislation to be passed through the halls of Capitol Hill.\n\nThe main purpose of the bill is to, as the name implies, clean the streets of America. Too often are they havens of the homeless, the disadvantaged, the drug dealers and criminals. For Americans to start getting around their cities, they need to feel safe in their cities, and as such the Clean Streets Act will provide funding to city governments for the purpose of clearing the homeless from high-traffic areas and cleaning up the messes they leave behind. Is it a solution? No. Rather, it's a subscription to the old adage "out of sight, out of mind", and indeed one could call it cruel. But if the President's agenda is to get to its deeper initiatives while faced with a hostile Congress, it needs to have a few easy wins under its belt, and the American people will know who to thank when they can walk down Main Street without needing to rush and weave past muggers and beggars."
 USA_hart_68_im_no_miracle_worker_desc: "The Soup Kitchen Act is another part of President Hart's common-sense start, slotting into his program of urban renewal like a puzzle piece to the poverty question. Food insecurity is a problem which embeds itself in American cities like cancer, forcing those who don't have ready access to meals into desperate scrounging and spending. A man can't survive without food and water, after all, and a man without food and water is a man who's willing to turn to any length to obtain it.\n\nTo carve your own path to success in life is the American dream, but everyone needs some help now and then. By increasing public access to warm meals, we'll undoubtedly make a dent in the poverty plague, giving the disadvantaged one less problem to worry about. While soup kitchens by themselves will not end homelessness or poverty, they together with other initiatives will surely provide hope and support to those who have slipped through the cracks, not to mention the positive effects which the kitchens have on crime. How can Congress refuse?"
 USA_hart_68_a_well_oiled_machine_desc: "What causes poverty? This is the central question to the Hart Administration, one which can be asked to a thousand different people with a thousand different answers. Some say that it's just the way things are. Others say it's an issue of will and drive. Still others will point to economic strength or weakness, under the assumption that the state of the market determines the state of the people. This vague tidal wave of platitudes and diagnoses, when looked at as a whole, look completely unassailable - but when broken into individual pieces, the problems suddenly become clear and workable.\n\nSuch is the idea behind President Hart's early focus on the problem of drug abuse, a poison which worms its way into the blood and brains of those who are down on their luck, keeping them in the muck which they've stumbled into or even dragging them further down. Though heartless politicians in need of a quick boost often cut their teeth on decrying the druggie, harsh punishments and prison sentences often do little more for these Americans than further tarnish their lives.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Recovery Act proposes a different route. By offering ready access to rehabilitation and recovery, the broken safety net that has failed so often can finally be mended. It's a controversial act, certainly, but with a tentatively supportive Congress waiting for the vote, perhaps some ambition in the early slate of ideas is the way to go"
 USA_hart_68_tough_luck_desc: "Unfortunately, the early slate of President Hart's agenda has met with failure in Congress. Despite the best efforts of the President, his cabinet, and his supporters, the proposals met an uninterested and wary body of legislators less interested in their former colleague's ideas and more concerned with their own calculations and positions. It seems that American cities will continue to go without help for the moment while the newborn administration recalibrates around this unexpected opposition.\n\nIn no way does this spell doom for Hart, but it certainly isn't a pleasant sign. What it means is that we'll have to scale back our ambitions further until we find stable ground. We can propose all the dreams that we have to Congress, but they'll all amount to hot air if we don't build a foundation to work with our colleagues in the Senate first. Instead, the President will turn to common sense, acceptable compromises and little boosts to further our agenda and build a relationship with Capitol Hill. It won't be much, but even a little something is better than nothing at all."
 USA_hart_68_a_fine_gesture_desc: "The fight over civil rights has dragged into another year of controversy, and the road ahead remains long and twisted. Segregation remains popular in large swathes of the South, discrimination is still common nationwide, and African-Americans still feel the oppressive weight of insidious institutional racism on their backs. The American table is tilted against these disadvantaged groups, putting them on a lower standing than their white counterparts and often actively fighting to keep them in their place. Something has to be done - something quieter, something which pokes and removes the subtle gears of discrimination rather than blanketing the problem in legislation from on high.\n\nUnfortunately, with our unreceptive compatriots on Capitol Hill, our early ambitions are limited by their distaste for the President's bold agenda. Our ambitions must be scaled to compensate. HBCUs, the backbone of Black education for over a century, have long struggled to maintain programs which their white counterparts keep with ease thanks to a lack of funding. This can be rectified with the stroke of Hart's pen, and so it will be that a pipeline of money will flow from D.C. to Jackson, to Greensboro, to Prairie View, and to a hundred other institutions.\n\nIt's not much. Indeed, sending extra money to extra places is a lazy solution to the deeply embedded lack of higher education available to black Americans. With the state of Congress, however, there's not much more we can do at the moment. If nothing else, what college wouldn't appreciate a few million dollars from Uncle Sam in their wallet?"
 USA_hart_68_all_natural_desc: "Champagne pops and flows at the White House tonight as news comes through that President Hart's early agenda has been signed, sealed, and delivered by Congress. Despite the skepticism and the fearmongering of wary conservatives, Hart and his cabinet have leaned on enough levers and convinced enough Senators to see their proposals through, finding common ground with those within and without his party to start the creation of a brighter, better American city - and a brighter, better America with it.\n\nWith a foundation of cooperation built, the President can now move onto bigger and better things than his early window dressing. The promise of his ambitious policy slate now seems to be materializing in front of the nation, turning from mere hopes and dreams into real and attainable plans. The road to get there, however, remains perilous and rocky. The conservatives of the nation have no intention of sitting back while Hart enacts his will, and they will resist him with all they have. Even so, Phil Hart has no fear of his enemies - his conscience drives him forwards, and he will see the full breadth of his ideals go through come hell or high water."
 USA_hart_68_a_tighter_grip_desc: "Affirmative Action. The idea is obscure, technical, and prone to misrepresentation. To the average white American, Affirmative Action means the federal government stepping in to tilt the table towards minority groups - African-Americans, especially - and depriving them of a fair shot. To Phil Hart and the civil rights activists, Affirmative Action means the federal government stepping in to equalize the table, tilting it towards minorities in order to counteract the centuries in which the weight of the job market has been distinctly skewed towards white Americans. In essence, affirmative action will create policies and guidelines in order to further encourage the employment of minorities, who have long been passed over for better jobs and left in menial squalor by the hand of the free market.\n\nIt's an ambitious, controversial idea, and conservatives have cried bloody murder about it. Moderates, too, find themselves disturbed by the plan - morally by the thought of potentially making job and education opportunities unfair to white Americans, politically by the thought of an angry mob of voters throwing them into the street come November. The full breadth of Hart's plan may not pass muster in today's America, but at the very least, wider developmental fields like engineering will see their gates opened for a wave of qualified minority workers, ready to fulfill both their dream and the American dream."
 USA_hart_68_hart_and_soul_desc: "We have begun the great work of the Hart Presidency. As the first hundred days have elapsed, we have successfully strengthened our commitment in heart and soul (or, perhaps, "Hart" and soul, ha-ha) to the improvement of the American common weal. The President and his staff have made the transition from the simpler, more peaceable politics of the Senate to the cutthroat politics that make life in the White House so difficult.\n\nNow, an opportune time presents itself; now the real work begins. We have set the mood for the Hart Presidency. Hopefully, we will be able to keep our promises to the RDC and more importantly to the people of the United States of America. If all goes well, American transportation will be revolutionized, the cities will become what they were meant to be all along, scientific and educational innovation will attain a new height, and civil rights will be strengthened.\n\nStaffers of the White House! The President has full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in political battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.\n\nGood luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking."
 USA_hart_68_eisenhowers_blessing_desc: "For all of its horror, war oftentimes draws innovation from inspired minds and learned experiences. Consider General Eisenhower, who retired from his duties having been enlightened by the German Autobahn. Its builders are heinous but the fact that it expedited the movement of men, materiel, and commerce across the heart of Europe was undeniable. The vision of an America intertwined and united by such a vast network of asphalt and concrete was first among the equals that had driven the war hero to the White House.\n\nHis hopes and its scope were both dashed by a truant Congress, however, and to this day the Interstate Highway System remains a pale, half-built shadow of its planners' most conservative proposals. With the immensity of our task to expand the Interstate above and beyond what they had envisioned, it is only proper that we beseech well wishes from the greatest brainchild among them.\n\nThe toil ahead, after all, is for his legacy as much as it is for ours."
 USA_hart_68_the_enduring_chug_desc: "It is true that men and women, often immigrants, walking on their bare feet conquered the untamed wildernesses of what is now the west of the United States. But their ardor and the gold they mined were not enough to build permanent prosperity in those lands; it was the construction of great rail lines from coast to coast that made places like California and Utah the powerhouses they are today.\n\nThis is proven by a critical observation that was made as the rail lines developed and were improved: that whereas wealth was created in a given settlement after its settlement, true prosperity was only present once rail connections and infrastructure were established. This was true for San Jose, for Salt Lake City, for Spokane and for Selma - indeed, for virtually all of the great Western towns and cities. Without exception.\n\nA public rail initiative will enable us to build on the foundation the old rail-builders left behind, and just as crucially would strengthen business no matter its location and introduce a truly convenient mode of transport for the average citizen. Even if civilians do not line up to take a ride, commerce will still benefit nonetheless - after all, a train is quicker than a tractor-trailer."
 USA_hart_68_amtrack_is_in_business_desc: "The National Railroad Passenger Corporation - our flagship public rail initiative, referred to as Amtrac, Amtrack, and most accurately Amtrak - is at last in service. It is no better time, too - since the early 1900s, rail has fallen headlong into decline. Passenger service route lines are hard on the drop, the US Post Office Department has diverted its mail delivery from the usual passenger trains to other transport, and train lines are talking about filing for bankruptcy.\n\nThis ends now: Amtrak is in business, and a new era for the passenger train will begin soon. Though we have yet to create defined plans for the Corporation, its goals will be lofty. We will not settle for some stopgap solution that keeps passenger train transport functional through the next decade or half-century. Nor will we completely nationalize the trains the way blundering socialists like Bukharin did.\n\nNo, we will use Amtrak as a sort of actuator arm to stimulate the creation of a real public transit service in this country, to rival and surpass the Yamato and Hitlerite systems of transportation."
 USA_hart_68_the_private_eye_desc: "One of the first areas of the economy that Amtrak will hit will be the private sector. As we have stated beforehand, this is a perfect opportunity for such a measure; railways are shutting down left, right, and center as passenger ridership declines and revenue decays.\n\nBefore we proceed, however, let us be very clear about one thing: we do not now see, nor do we expect to see, a need to build a new railway system from scratch. No, the network that we have right now is already a great beginning; what we need to do is retool, rework, and repair the railway system until it is worthy of Americans and no longer reminiscent of some Arab backwater.\n\nThe incursion of Amtrak into the American private rail sector will be twofold: first, we will buy up abandoned rails with a view on refurbishing them, and second, we will cut leases and contracts to modernize other companies' railways."
 USA_hart_68_the_city_pledge_desc: "Fiddling around with the private railway sector and making our old railways worthy of the modern American citizen is well and good, but it is not a be-all-end-all. Nor will it suffice to prove the merits of Amtrak and its program to the average American businessman and civilian.\n\nSeveral forward-thinking city administrations - leaders of what the Hart Administration has tended to refer to as 'Model Cities' adhering to the 'City Pledge' - have already opted into the Government's urban modernization initiative. Therefore, in addition to and support of all the other proposals being worked on, they will prepare themselves for local rail installations.\n\nThese local rail installations may or may not involve connecting the Model Cities to the broader countrywide rail system. Regardless of whether they do, one thing is certain to be involved in most of the railway plans: city-centered rail systems that cannot but benefit the places where they are built."
 USA_hart_68_the_american_shinkansen_desc: "It is not enough for us to build railways in cities or refurbish old tracks; we must make support for the Amtrak initiatives a matter of patriotism. Fortunately, President Hart is aware of the perfect thing to at once shame American complacency, inspire the American people, and galvanize their business and industry in the direction we desire.\n\nThe Shinkansen - "New Main Line" in Japanese, colloquially referred to as the "Bullet Train" - is a technological achievement of epochal significance and one that puts the rest of the world to shame. Like the ordnance that gave the Bullet Train its colloquial moniker, these Japanese rapid-transit apparatuses shoot from Tokyo to Osaka in two and a half hours (where driving can take easily six or more).\n\nWe, the American people, are more than capable of equalling and overtaking this technology. Amtrak may not be ahead of the curve now, but once American bullet-train development kicks into high gear and yields results, we and not Japan will be the place to look to for expertise and examples in public transportation!"
 USA_hart_68_take_a_step_back_desc: "Far to the south there lives an extremely ambitious man. His name is Juscelino Kubitschek, and from 1955 to 1960 he was President of Brazil. (President Hart, then merely a freshman senator, met him once when he came north on a diplomatic visit to President Eisenhower.)\n\nPresident Kubitschek - who ran for office again in 1965 - promised during both the times he ran for office that he would bring about 'fifty years of progress in five.' He did pull that off during his first presidency, but there was a horrible hitch: the price for fifty years of progress in one-tenth as many years was fifty years of debt in five.\n\nPresident Hart and his advisors are thinking about this because they need any analogy they can get to help them take a step back and look over the budget. The plans for Amtrak - even if they might do for America what Kubitschek did for Brazil - will need to be reassessed lest we commit a budgetary blunder of Brazilian or even Argentine proportions. Corners must be cut; the President's hard decision will be to decide which ones to cut."
 USA_hart_68_rocky_and_the_rockies_desc: "No matter what one calls the redoubtable Nelson Rockefeller, whether that be "scion of the Rockefeller oil family", "philanthropist", "liberal-progressive Republican", "Rocky", or "certified paintings hoarder", one thing is clear to everyone that listens to him talk about fiscal matters for even a moment - that he is a staunch fiscal conservative.\n\nThis is why the Hart Administration has begun to set up discussion with him and his faction of the Republican Party. A hefty budget may well make Rocky feel faint, but this 'silly man' as many Democrats call him could be the difference between life and death for our agenda regarding Republican backing.\n\nIt may irritate our Administration to have to consult with Rockefeller and his ilk, who in fact are sometimes pejoratively referred to as the "Rockies" for how immovable they can be. But Hart knows we have no choice: Republicans are liable to oppose these plans no matter what, and so we need to do what we can to calm their nerves and keep our coalition as stable as possible no matter what we end up deciding."
 USA_hart_68_talking_down_the_bosses_desc: "In a situation where we need to pinch every penny possible to ensure efficient functioning, and move as hard and fast as we can not to give the GOP and other potentially hostile factions any reason to hit us, corrupt and incompetent contractors are something that we cannot tolerate. Decisive action must be taken to secure ourselves against the prospect.\n\nCareful and thorough audits must be conducted of every company and every contract that has been bid upon. Executives and managers should be closely examined for embezzlement, graft, grift, and any other kind of problematic behavior. Materials used in construction should also be monitored to ensure that they are used for the exact things they were earmarked for and nothing else without very good reason to change the plans.\n\nThere is a likely drawback to all this, unfortunately - if we go about auditing things with our customary zeal, delays are no mere possibility but a certainty. It will be up to the President and the Amtrak leadership to determine the extent to which the cost of delay is outweighed by the cost of malfeasance, corruption, and incompetence not investigated and stopped."
 USA_hart_68_full_steam_ahead_desc: "In these past several months, the Hart Administration has crisscrossed the country, leaving Washington and other havens to take charge of things. To the astonishment of observers, they have not been the usual, hum-drum bureaucrats that one sees mocked in the papers. They have been filled with a bounce and excitement for American infrastructure that is stirring. Their verve and brains is what has made the impossible seem possible.\n\nThis latest initiative—this push for high-speed trains—is possible only because of these people and their desire to make America better. We owe it to them, to the American people, to pass a bill that can bring about real change in transportation, that can help consumers of all types live their lives. With new funding, we can bring people together and show them just what an active federal government can do."
 USA_hart_68_everything_old_shall_now_become_new_desc: "If rails are the veins and arteries of America's transportation system, then what is the heart? President Hart believes that there should not be just one beating heart, but countless: each railway should have a number of cities directly connected to it, in order to act as a catalyst for movement of goods, people, and ideas. To this end, President Hart has encouraged these "railtowns" to be expanded- larger cities connected to the central system of the United States will breathe new life -or new blood- into the tracks.\n\nCountless hearts for countless veins will make the bloodflow strong and unyielding; and with it, America will grow stronger."
 USA_hart_68_mr_amtrack_desc: "When people thought of Philip Hart, they used to think of him as the Conscience of the Senate. However, as he pushes to revitalize America's rails, he's gained a new moniker: Mr. Amtrak. Even the Washington Post has taken to printing cartoons with the President in a conductor's hat, pushing America forward.\n\nAnd, all jokes aside, that's just what this Administration will do. We'll go further than any administration before. We'll build track after track to bring towns around the country together. We'll unleash a new wave of prosperity and ingenuity, one built on the bright-eyed ambition of our federal workforce. President Hart will be the Mr. Amtrak that tens of millions know he can be."
 USA_hart_68_the_democracy_mobile_desc: "There's no modern invention that better captures the American belief in personal freedom than the car. With it, a person can go anywhere—whether that's in their hometown or across the country. They own not just a vehicle but the ability to choose.\n\nThis desire for freedom is what drove so many Americans to buy cars for themselves and their families. It's what allowed the automotive industry to reach such an enormous size through the first half of this century. While times have changed, Philip Hart still believes in the promise of companies like Ford and General Motors, of all the innovators of Detroit. He is going to turn back the clock and work with those titans of manufacturing to ensure the automotive industry maintains its peak profits."
 USA_hart_68_the_path_forward_desc: "What does Washington do when it doesn't understand something? It creates a study commission, of course. From Teddy Roosevelt's Commission on Economy and Efficiency to Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women, these task forces are a way to bring experts to the table to study a problem, consult the public on their views, and develop "evidence-based policies" that can solve the issue.\n\nNow, we have the opportunity to launch a commission of our own to understand how Americans use cars in their daily life. The findings will be essential in guiding our policies to help drivers and boost the automotive industry. We'll just have to make sure the task force is thorough and unbiased in its work and that we can actually follow through on the solutions it suggests. Otherwise, this could wind up a boondoggle."
 USA_hart_68_the_good_ol_market_desc: "After many conversations with the leading figures of American enterprise and experts at think tanks across DC, the commission has found a solution to the ills plaguing the automotive industry: subsidies. By providing our leading manufacturers with a little extra cash, as they do in Japan and Germany, our companies can lower prices and boost innovation. They can make America competitive internationally.\n\nOf course, this means we're going to be pumping a lot of resources into the Midwest. Those blue-collar workers in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio will be thrilled with all the jobs we're creating for them—but it will take a while for the benefits to trickle out of the region and across the nation."
 USA_hart_68_bits_and_pieces_desc: "Ford, GM, and Chrysler are called the "Big Three" for a reason. Together, these giants control over 90 percent of all automotive sales in the United States. They invest billions in their plants and use hundreds of thousands to produce their cars. GM alone employs half the total population of Flint, Michigan.\n\nWe need to work with at least one of these companies if we are going to get anywhere with our drive to transform transportation. Under the label of promoting "public-private partnership," the Hart Administration will negotiate a contract with Ford or GM, the bigger of the three, to build train parts and other equipment for the US government. The only question is which of the companies we award the billion-dollar contract."
 USA_hart_68_the_answer_to_everything_desc: "Look, innovation ain't cheap. We knew that when we started. None of the things we want to accomplish with American transportation are possible if we nickel and dime every project, if we cut corners to satisfy the impossible demands of the deficit hawks in Congress and the national media.\n\nSo, yes, Philip Hart is going to be spending more money. Yes, he is going to use his authority as President to authorize a stimulus package for the automotive industry. Yes, it may cause some mild inflation. In the end, though, that money will be worth it. It is important, no, necessary that we spend this money to ensure the success of our projects."

It's gotten people and Congress into an uproar and demanding investigations. We've flipped through the thing and find the whole thing absurd. Just completely absurd.\n\n...But, there's perhaps a kernel of wisdom behind Mr. Nader's absurd claims. We could do what experts have been asking us to do for a long time by mandating that states implement national driving laws, seatbelt requirements, and car maintenance requirements. We could reduce federal highway dollars to states that refuse to check for people driving under the influence. Some state legislators and libertarians will be mad, certainly, but we'd be saving lives with the strike of a pen with these rules."
 USA_hart_68_these_gas_prices_are_too_damn_high_desc: ""The pain at the pump." It's the common refrain these days. People are spending as much as 38 cents a gallon when they go to fill their tank.

People are cutting trips short and the satirists on the late night shows are presenting little stories about all the ways people have tried to cut down on costs. (A personal favorite: A woman in Ann Arbor allegedly removed all the doors and seats in her car to improve its mileage.)\n\nGas prices are mostly beyond the control of the President, but there's still little things we can do to reduce some of the pain people are experiencing. In particular, we can sign some new trade deals to increase the national oil supply."
 USA_hart_68_the_americar_desc: "After speaking with people across the country, the commission has produced an... unexpected result. There's no problems with the automotive industry, they claim. The industry is healthier than ever. The problem is with consumers. With companies producing sportier, more expensive cars, it's become harder and harder for new and low-income drivers to buy a car. There's just not many options and, so, the commission has recommended the government step in to provide a budget option.\n\nIt's going to be hard but, we'll be damned, if we aren't going to give this thing a shot. We'll need to schedule some meetings and start talks with industry and regulators. Most importantly, we'll need to decide whether to give Ford or General Motors, the two biggest manufacturers in the country, the contract to produce the damn thing. Both are going to fight like hell to win this deal, regardless of whether it revolutionizes transportation or it becomes a billion-dollar debacle."

Let the nuts have their way and the whole thing will be smeared as America's first foray into socialism and a gross misuse of tax dollars. Then they'll force Congress to get involved and whittle the initiative down to nothing.\n\nWe'll need some goddamn good PR to sell this thing. Over the coming weeks, the Hart Administration will start meeting in secret with the big advertising companies of Madison Avenue to see how the government can show the Americar's value. From negotiation to production, we'll need to be proactive in demonstrating just what this car can do."
 USA_hart_68_talk_to_me_jack_desc: "The big wigs of the automotive industry are either too stupid, too cowardly, or too stubborn to listen to us. They've not just kiboshed the Americar effort but set it on fire, rolled it off a cliff, and sent it careening to the bottom of a ravine. People are angry and, just as we worried, the nuts are screaming their heads off about socialism or some goddamn nonsense like that.\n\nIt's time for a back-up plan: If we can't make industry more responsive to the people, we can do what we can to make the people more organized and responsive to industry. It's time to give people the power they need to set prices and market trends."
 USA_hart_68_look_for_the_union_label_desc: "The manufacturers don't want to work with us? That's fine. That's their right. We have plenty of ways of affecting the market, of making cars more affordable to the average consumer. As much as we would have liked to collaborate with industry, there are other groups who we know will be willing to help us. Chief among them are the unions.\n\nIt wouldn't be out of line to take a long, hard look at the relationship between the automotive industry and organized labor. Some of our advisors even believe civil reforms in one sector might inspire change in another. With this in mind, President Hart will reach out to the United Auto Workers to see how the Administration can promote unionization across the Midwest. The union will appreciate it and it might get GM and Ford back in line."
 USA_hart_68_drivers_clubs_desc: "Contrary to press reports, we must once again reiterate that we are not mad. We have absolutely nothing but good will for the corporate giants that pointlessly trashed the last, great opportunity to remake American transportation. In fact, we welcome their valuable role they play in the American economy.\n\nWe also value the role of the consumers in setting market trends and want to ensure they have as much power as possible relative to large corporate institutions. The President will spend the next few weeks encouraging Americans to create drivers' clubs so that they spend less on gas and car maintenance. If adopted on a large enough scale, it could lead to fewer people spending money on cars altogether. That might be just the kick that the manufacturers need to meaningfully respond to the public's needs."
 USA_hart_68_pimp_my_ride_desc: "We actually did it. The Americar isn't just an idea, isn't just some pie-in-the-sky proposal put forth by some nameless, forgettable commission but something real. These cars are in production and they will come to market.\n\nIt's hard to understate how big a win for us this is for our administration, how absurdly popular this endeavor is going to be for everyone except the anti-government, right-wing nuts. Let's cork some champagne and get some good photos with our industry partners. Let's get some photos of Hart touring plants and shaking hands with blue-collar workers. Let's show the nation who is responsible for this modern American wonder."
 USA_hart_68_audit_the_DMV_desc: "One of the great sources of frustration for any American is having to visit the DMV. We mean, Christ, why does it take so long? What are the people there even doing? Why are half these forms filled with gibberish and the other half duplicative?\n\nSurely, the Hart administration can do something here. Let's recruit some people to study the DMV and look at the methods they use to run the place. Once we understand what the hell is actually happening behind closed doors we can find some ways to improve the way they run and maybe improve how our transportation sector runs overall."
 USA_hart_68_one_last_touch_desc: "The Americar is rolling off the assembly line. We're weeks away from the cars arriving on lots and being sold to consumers. There's just one last detail, one final tweak we need to make to ensure they are actually available to most consumers.\n\nWe need tax breaks. Specifically, we need to offer a tax break to any car dealer that stocks and sells Americars on their lots. These dealers might not like Hart but they'd have to be crazy not to accept the low, low deals that President Hart is offering them to be a part of American history."
 USA_hart_68_cooking_on_the_engine_desc: "With the Americar, you can go places. At least that's the tagline. People can go out to sporting events, to drive-in theaters, and to national parks. They can lay on their roof and stare up at the stars or explore our nation's unspoiled natural splendor. They can make new memories with the people they love or carve out their own destiny.\n\nLet's help people understand the real freedom they have now. We'll work with federally funded writers and artists to show America the countless possibilities available to them, whether that's using the Americar's engine to cook, laying out on its spacious back seats, or decorating the ceiling with their kids."
 USA_hart_68_a_little_bit_of_this_desc: "A colossus with feet of clay will crumble. In order to ensure our ambitious infrastructure agenda won't run into any snags, the Hart Administration must repair and revamp the national highway system that 'Ike' Eisenhower started!\n\nIt will be a costly, thankless, and pricey expenditure that our opponents will eviscerate us for. Despite this, the safety of motorists all across America is well worth the cost this bill will incur."
 USA_hart_68_america_runs_on_desc: "America without its trucking industry is a car without wheels. For the longest time, our truckers have been on their own. Operating on margins that would make any entrepreneur uncomfortable, one bad haul away from disaster.\n\nIt's time to relieve the men and women on the roads of America. With government subsidies, our truckers can hire more workers, make emergency funds, and most importantly, keep America running."
 USA_hart_68_take_a_rest_desc: "San Jon, New Mexico was a dying town off of Route 40. Keyword, 'was'. A year ago businesses were going bankrupt every week, now it is flourishing thanks to a single rest stop that popped up there. The town's GDP has doubled since the rest stop was completed.\n\nWhich brings the Hart Administration to a new bill in the works, it places government owned rest stops in highway towns. Not only does it bring in government revenue, it helps small towns. A chance to show rural America we haven't forgotten about them. We can save thousands of small towns, and simultaneously court the rural vote too."
 USA_hart_68_what_keeps_us_together_desc: "Rural America once again feels cut out of the party. Why wouldn't they? Dirt roads are still being traversed by millions of Americans every day. If we want to change that, it's going to be expensive.\n\nNevertheless, it will be worth the hefty price tag incurred."
 USA_hart_68_cutting_some_corners_desc: "It's been decided that America will be connected, that is a certainty! However, the price tag that our ambitious agenda accrues is making debt hawks wary. The President has two options before him. He can either scrimp and save and make sure rural America is connected, albeit, with cheap, low quality materials such as gravel.\n\nAlternatively, President Hart can spend political capital to guarantee well-maintained asphalt roads make their way to every small town in America. Neither option will make everyone happy, but a decision must be made regardless.\n\nWhat will it be, Mr. President?"
 USA_hart_68_crossing_delaware_desc: "After months of shmoozing the political elites of Washington, and doling out favors to insiders, we are ready to continue Eisenhower's dream of a National Highway System. The I-95, running along the East Coast, will be the first milestone of this Administration. Its progress is currently stalled, and it is sitting in a state of disrepair. By working closely with the highway commission, we will see this project through to completion.\n\nGod bless President Hart, and god bless these (soon to be connected) United States of America!"
 USA_hart_68_the_final_spike_desc: "What is the point of a milestone if we cannot capitalize on it? As more Americans hit the roads thanks to the strides made, we too will traverse the highways for a highly publicized photo opportunity. The road trip will include a multitude of rest stops, with meet and greet sessions sure to give the Secret Service a scare. At our last stop, we will deliver a speech to the country, telling them that this is only the beginning.\n\nSoon, driving from Boston to Albuquerque, or from Tallahassee to Helena will no longer be a thing of fiction, but something the next generation will take for granted."
 USA_hart_68_urban_realities_desc: "Mr. President, it is time to connect the cities. Secretary Jacobs has submitted her plans for incorporating the metropolises of America into our highways. Once our centers of trade and commerce are hooked up to the highways, the rest of the country will feel its effects.\n\nFor once, a domino effect will be panning out in our favor."
 USA_hart_68_over_and_under_desc: "Robert Moses is but one urban planner in New York City, nevertheless, he represents a nightmarish vision for this country. Where minorities and the poor are blocked off from public amenities and their communities are bulldozed to make way for highways.\n\nThe Hart Administration is going to take a gentle touch, by working closely with the communities and urban planners. Our administration will find a way to meet the needs of the motorist and the community."
 USA_hart_68_duty_to_your_community_desc: "The job of connecting our new towns and cities won't be finished after the opening ceremonies. The roads and highways that ensure the lifeblood of goods and people can continue to flow between our great urban centers must be adequately maintained. After all, it would not do well for our government or country to leave the arteries of our nation in a state of disrepair.\n\nMaintenance is a thankless task, but if our nation is to be adequately serviced and connected, it is a necessary one."
 USA_hart_68_tractor_tion_desc: "The ongoing, ever-lasting fight between the states and the federal government has gone on since the country's founding, an everlasting tug of war. It is a fight that has now extended to the highways. Luckily for the states, the Hart administration is more than willing to share some responsibilities of management (and upkeep) to give Americans more say in how their highways are run. This will not only save the treasury some much-needed dollars but will buoy public support for our highway program. A win, win, win!"
 USA_hart_68_role_call_desc: "With construction finalized or approaching completion on most of our planned highways, there is talk of further renovations to better connect disparate communities across the country. Our representatives in Congress are already taking the first steps to negotiate a new Highway bill that will fund further road construction.\n\nHowever, with funding drying up, we must take steps to ensure that these new additions do not fall too far out of our budget range, lest fiscal concerns deal the administration an unnecessary setback."
 USA_hart_68_call_of_the_wild_desc: "From the Grand Canyon carved by the Colorado to the watery bellows of Yellowstone's calderas and the thundering roar of Niagara Falls, America is blessed by its divine natural beauty. Yet, it is a sad truth that in a nation three-thousand miles in length, much of that beauty is inaccessible to all but the most determined naturalists and park-goers.\n\nThankfully, a remedy can be found within the best minds of the Departments of Interior and Transportation. A plan to both improve the accessibility of America's natural beauty and bring roads to some of this country's most remote regions. By expanding our natural parks closer to our highways and through improvements in accessibility, it is hoped that our roads can spur increased interest in our great national parks and bring in added revenue for the park service.\n\nOf course, efforts must be taken to preserve the safety of local wildlife, lest the natural excursion of many an American are to be ruined by some unfortunate roadkill."
 USA_hart_68_the_adventure_road_desc: "After years of effort, we can finally say we've done it. As construction work concludes on the last of the delayed interstates, the United States is linked from sea to shining sea by the Interstate. From California to the New York Islands, our citizens can now cross a continent, luxuriate in the freedom offered by the automobile, and explore the beauty of this great nation.\n\nSome may criticize the methods of construction and take issue with location and cost, but few can deny the achievement. President Hart has shown America that the administration can deliver, not just in proposal and rhetoric, but in street lights and highways too."
 USA_hart_68_shining_megalopolis_on_a_hill_desc: "One would be hard-pressed to wrap their heads around the sprawling labyrinthine patchwork of businesses, markets, and customers that make up the American economy, the driver of American prosperity, and in the nuclear age, the best weapon against tyranny. Yet, its imperfections are many, from inequality and inequity amongst workers and wages, the endless struggle between big business and big labor, to small businesses eking out a meager existence amidst cutthroat competition. Imperfections that drive forth the ills that infest the streets of our cities, from declining industry to increased crime and urban decline.\n\nThe solution to these woes is not less government, as some on the right would believe, not to let our cities decline and our industries falter. No, it is the opinion of this administration that what America needs is liberalism that builds. An enduring commitment to righting the ills of society, the imperfections of the economy, and the struggles of those unable to help themselves. We will ensure our cities prosper, our poor are fed, and our economy is free from foreign dependence.\n\nThe road ahead will be long and hard. The costs will be great, the problems many, but we shall not rest before we have built that shining city on a hill."
 USA_hart_68_bricks_and_windows_desc: "A police officer's duty is to Protect and Serve. A lot of our departments across America seem to have forgotten that. It is high time to audit law enforcement. Reward departments that are doing things right, and flag down the ones who are abusing their power. From the freshest beat cop just learning his patrol route to the police chiefs of bustling metropolises, we will put a new face to law and order. One that doesn't create an image of distrust and lackluster effectiveness."
 USA_hart_68_an_honest_look_at_order_desc: "Whether it is Dutch Harbor in frigid Alaska, or the concrete streets of Chicago, crime will exist here. It is a fact of life. However, our response to crime can be changed. Our Administration will survey every police department. Whatever they need, we will provide. All complaints will be heard, and most importantly, addressed."
 USA_hart_68_gambling_up_north_desc: "There is an old mantra, "The only thing stopping a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun."\n\nBut what if bad men couldn't get their hands on guns in the first place? Our administration has therefore decided to work closely with states to tailor gun regulation laws suited to their needs while still being firmly aligned with our administration's stance. The end result is a populace that is well-armed and well educated on firearm safety that would make the Founding Fathers proud."
 USA_hart_68_equip_our_officers_desc: "Bimbos strutting down Broadway, trigger-happy thugs in Times Square, muggers in front of the MOMA. New York City has fallen from grace, but it is, regrettably just one of many urban centers that are infested with crime and drugs.\n\nPresident Hart and Congress will pass an emergency funding bill to give the men and women of law enforcement the cash needed to afford better equipment, hire more Officers, and clean up our streets once and for all."
 USA_hart_68_law_and_order_desc: "Racism; antisemitism; xenophobia. These things are a rot, a rot that has taken root deep inside of the country that we hold so near and dear. President Philip Hart has the cure to this malaise: law and order. For too long, white supremacist and fascist elements have been allowed to survive and thrive in America's difficult political climate- but no longer. President Philip Hart will rebuild the country that we love, ensuring that these groups are fought- at the source. No longer will young men feel that they have no other option- and no longer will these groups be able to become violent."
 USA_hart_68_the_state_of_hate_desc: "There are many things that somebody can do with a firearm: they can hunt for food, they can use it for pleasure. Most of all, however, they can use them to kill. This is an undeniable truth- objects like this have an unmatched ability to end lives. And there are certain groups that utilize this to great effect. Groups like the Ku Klux Klan and various National Socialist groups, unfortunately, manage to get their hands on an upsetting amount of guns- but no longer. Following some recent tragic events, members of certain groups will be put on lists- lists that will make it much harder to obtain high powered firearms.\n\nAssuming we do it right, of course."
 USA_hart_68_eo_34498_desc: "When Philip Hart was elected not too long ago, he entered office with a promise: He would always act on his principles, no matter how hard or inconvenient. Today, however, he has to confess some selfishness. As crime rose in our cities and gun violence became commonplace, he did not act with the haste he'd promised. He allowed a powerful army of gun lobbyists to prevent him from giving the nation the truth it needs to make decisions.\n\nThe only way to repent for that failing is through good works and deeds, so here is this Administration's. This morning, Philip Hart signed Executive Order #334498. This executive order will, for the first time in our nation's history, establish a national, nonpartisan commission to study the causes and prevention of gun violence in this country. Led by Dr. Milton Eisenhower, a well-respected academic and administrator, commission members will try to understand just what is driving gun violence and what common-sense solutions we need to address them.\n\nThis commission's work will not be popular, especially among gun manufacturers, but it is necessary work."
 USA_hart_68_arm_control_act_of_desc: "The Administration's Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Gun Violence today submitted a progress report to the President. Its findings: Two out of every three homicides are committed with guns. While one fourth of our nation's gun supply is composed of handguns, they make up 75 percent of all gun homicides. What's worse, many of these guns have been sold without proof of need. The lack of restrictions and widespread fear of violence has caused annual handgun sales to quadruple in the last five years.\n\nThis situation is untenable. It requires immediate action from the federal government and from Congress in particular. At the President's request, officials in Congress today introduced the Gun Control Act of [getYear]. Not only will this bill prohibit the interstate transfer of firearms by anyone but manufacturers but it will also institute a new licensing system for all handguns, restricting access to only those who can prove they have a special need and have not been arrested for a previous violent crime. Anyone who fails to attain one of these licenses will have their guns confiscated by the federal government and provided adequate compensation.\n\nLet's not let ourselves be cowed by powerful interests. We need this bill to be tough on crime."
 USA_hart_68_the_first_civil_right_desc: "Now, it's time to have an honest and frank discussion about our nation's young people. Every day, somewhere in this country, a child is scarred by gun violence. It happens in the home, when a young boy or girl plays with the toy they found in their daddy's nightstand. It happens in their neighborhoods when they come across an act of violent crime by a discontented person. It happens when a person in need of psychiatric help finds access to a weapon they should not have.\n\nWe cannot stop all these cases, but research by the commission shows that we can limit when and where children encounter violence. Working with the National League of Cities and US Conference of Mayors, we will support efforts to establish gun-free zones that prohibit any individual from possessing a firearm near schools, libraries, and other sensitive locations. Obviously, these zones will be determined by each city and restrictions will need to be enforced, but the Hart administration can provide the expertise needed to establish these safe spaces around the country."
 USA_hart_68_the_cold_war_desc: "One of the great troubles is that you can't simply wish away 90 million firearms. As much as Congress, and the White House, wishes that habits could change with the stroke of a pen, the truth is that legislation and executive orders can only ever be the start. Real change comes about through enforcement that takes years.\n\nNow, we can begin the journey down that long and difficult road. It's a path that requires cooperation with our friends, the police. It's one that means empowering the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies to crack down on those who might try to circumvent our gun and drug laws. By cleaning up the streets and putting away dangerous criminals, we can reverse decades of urban decay and make America safe again."
 USA_hart_68_its_3am_desc: "Our baptism of fire on the so-called Drug Crisis came during our time on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Working with Senator Birch Bayh, we discovered that not only were millions of illegal drugs and narcotics produced and sold each year but that there were vast international enterprises devoted to maintaining them. Thanks to a culture of moral laxity and a failure to combat these networks, millions have become addicted to drugs such as heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana.\n\nThis issue is one that is close and personal to President Hart and so he will be spending many hours working directly with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to destroy these networks. He will push the commissioner to target every person involved in these enterprises, from the bosses up top all the way down to the drug peddler on the street.\n\nIt won't destroy the illegal drug trade but you can be sure this Administration will do all it can to put a dent in its operations."
 USA_hart_68_steam_and_steel_desc: "The symbiotic relationship between organized labor and the Democratic Party has become a cornerstone of the modern party system since President Roosevelt entered office over three decades ago. Unions aid the party with crucial organizing and fundraising abilities, providing Democratic candidates with a solid base upon which to draw.\n\nThis relationship has been strained over the years, from the Eisenhower administration's careful moderation to the cold shoulder of Nixon. The administration's ambitious program of urban renewal and labor reform, however, demands a much warmer touch. The cooperation of men like Reuther and Meany, and by extension, the UAW and ALF-CIO, is a must if we are to succeed, lest we risk fracturing the entire Democratic party."
 USA_hart_68_as_much_as_we_can_desc: "For far too long, administration after administration has seen fit to overlook violations of legislation put in place to protect the rights of labor. Staffing the National Labor Relations Board with cronies either unable or unwilling to enforce laws, letting businesses upset the balance between the worker and employer in the name of 'economic growth' and 'political stability.'\n\nThankfully, President Hart and Attorney General Ribicoff have no such qualms. With a fresh slate of appointments to the NLRB and a newly empowered mandate to enforce the provisions of the Wagner Act, businesses will think twice before trampling over the rights of labor."
 USA_hart_68_in_and_out_desc: "Free trade is not always fair trade. Far too often, the liberalization of international trade has been used to undermine the rights of unions and workers with one-sided agreements. American manufacturers are undercut by a flood of cheap products at home and are unable to compete abroad thanks to tariffs and preferential trade policies.\n\nPresident Hart is no protectionist. Fair trade helps support our allies, reduces the cost of goods, and supports broader economic prosperity at home. Yet, we cannot stand idly by and watch as the prosperity of the working man is undermined through unfair agreements. The Hart Administration will ensure America's trade agreements are fair as well as free."
 USA_hart_68_buttons_and_levers_desc: "Technology, technology, technology, and technology. That is the Hart administration's stance on manufacturing. It is imperative that America become a leader not only in manufacturing every technology imaginable but also an innovator. The Reich and the Co-Prosperity Sphere will be expending all their energy catching up with us. By the time they do, we will already be a block ahead."
 USA_hart_68_for_home_use_desc: "Our foreign policy should be to embarrass our enemies. If a German diplomat were to step into any home they would discover a full pantry, a colored television, and household appliances reserved only for the upper crust. This would ensure that the master race seethes with envy. Any spies living among us will think twice about the work they're doing when exposed to the amenities of America.\n\nIt is imperative the free world will prosper in the light, and embarrass our enemies in the dark."
 USA_hart_68_and_for_the_boys_desc: "Obviously, the military is America's frontline against fascism- and they should reap the rewards of what we plant. By increasing technological investment, the military will receive access to cutting-edge technology that will make them stronger and the rest of us safer. While many will deride any investment or reliance on them as funding the already powerful military industrial complex in America, it is a necessary step that will rapidly increase our success. If the military prospers, so too will we."
 USA_hart_68_the_first_checkpoint_desc: "It's high time we check in on the employment rates nationwide. In order to placate the movers and shakers of DC, we must prove our agenda bears fruit.\n\nDepending on the results, we will adjust accordingly. If all is humming along according to plan, it is ammunition our administration will assail our adversaries with."
 USA_hart_68_rules_and_regulations_desc: "All across America, our administration has sought to give Americans the rise they deserve, the lift out of the malaise nailed to our door at the hands of defeat, backwateredness, and corruption. Now, the single mother can arrive to work on time thanks to public transportation funding, the elderly couple does not need to worry about their power going out due to faulty wiring, and every young child of our country can attend school with a newfound readiness and excitement. Nevertheless, the localities across America need our help to ensure that the money being dispensed towards their cities from coffers of the federal government is being properly delegated towards uses that benefit Americans, rather than allowing any to be lost due to economic attrition, or even worse...that same corruption that attacked our predecessors. Now, the Governors, Mayors, State Legislatures, and City Councils will have an outline as to the do's and the don'ts of this federal relief package."
 USA_hart_68_the_second_checkpoint_desc: "Now we're getting somewhere! Thanks to the bright minds and valiant hearts of our Administration, we have managed to put America back onto its forward track, chugging along and picking up every downtrodden American who had been afflicted with infrastructure, financial viability, or livelihood that was simply inadequate for the potential of this country. Now, it is time for us to look at how far we have come, and release a formal audit and investigation into the results of our work thus far. Thereby, we can assure Americans that we shall not falter by instead investigating every success and failure, to see where we can improve, where we can relax, and where we need to move onto in terms of our goals for the year. Philip Hart is a man of action, and now is his time to seize what Americans truly deserve!"
 USA_hart_68_voice_on_the_inside_desc: "American Working Unions and the Government: name a bigger battle in this country's workforce. To put it simply, you can't! However, with a friend and ally in Walter Reuther, and a President willing to get the job done, America's workers and their unions will find a newfound partnership in the government that they so-often butted heads with. Now, having a Reuther brother in the inside of their unionizations and multi-organizational meetings, our administration would be capable of heading to the frontlines for American Workers, and to know what exactly these unions are going to be wanting ahead of the curve. To get there, we need to send our best to the man, making sure that he knows that Philip Hart is a President for the working man just as much as anybody, and that he will be ready to come to the needs of Reuther and all of the unions across the country. After all, working together works!"
 USA_hart_68_and_who_are_you_desc: "Now that the Reuther blessing has been bestowed upon our Presidency, it is time to make sure that we do not make the mistake of associating with every single element of the working movement in the country. After all, some of these socialists and radicals have had a history of riot, revolt, and revenge, and giving these groups what they want would simply be equivalent to stepping on the same landmine we buried. Useless. Destructive. Wanton. Instead, our Administration will play our positive cards and our negative cards right, to make sure that America comes out the best in this grand match of cards. By offering incentives towards the more loyal and moderate unions and curtailing the acceptance of the unfixables, we shall be able to make sure that the right unions join as at the right time, with just the right forms of encouragement needed to give the American worker what they really, truly need."
 USA_hart_68_the_industrial_anthem_desc: "The victors of the Second World War had so altered the world economy that most of its treasures now gravitate towards a Fascist on the one pole and a Nazi on the other. The gap America once filled yawns like a pitch-black maw, beckoning her to come and take what had long been and will forever be hers. By encouraging the peoples of this country to pivot back towards the virtues of American products, we encourage more and more people to push our country back onto the railroad forward, against the Nazi, the Fascist, and the Imperialist. No matter the costs, and no matter our losses, nevermore will we, as a country, tolerate the international failures of our past and the bending of the knee towards our enemies abroad. Of course, the same old voices of concern and contrarianism will hawk over our work, saying that the immediate financial pitfalls outweigh our goals in the long run. However, if anyone can get America to Buy American, it will be Philip Hart!"
 USA_hart_68_an_honest_plea_desc: "For President Hart, what the administration says will happen. However, it's time to remind the American People that not only do we mean every word of what we say, but we have the means to make it happen. What this country can accomplish is untold, and in order to encourage Americans to support Americans in the consumer front above potential international substitutes, we need to properly feed the engines of American Industry the coal that this furnace needs to start firing up. American Labor Standards will swirl into a thunderous maelstrom, ready for the long journey ahead to increase production standards across the country while guaranteeing the safety and security of the American working class across every state and city in this long, wide country. No longer will our rivals and enemies dominate the markets that the virtuous American people construct their lives off of; instead, American products from American industry by American hands will move our lives forward!"

Electrification is the new way forward for our administration's work, and while our cities and suburbs have been retrofitted with the proper modifications necessary to power American homes and businesses, our rural countryside has been left in the dust by past administrations. While Philip Hart, Chep Morrison, and Jane Jacobs know their way around the proper set up of a city, the time has come for our frontliners on rural infrastructure projects to make their way across our cropfields, valleys, and small-time towns to overcome the threshold of power-lines and generators for this modern age. The Iron Eagle and the Rising Sun shall no longer be looked at as a strong state's potential for its citizens; instead, the Stars and Stripes will crackle within the power of our modernized powergrid."
 USA_hart_68_grease_desc: "The American Working Class is on the move, and with every passing day, the assembly line goes by faster and faster, as the hardened hands of America produce the greatest products possible for every citizen's family out there on the market. We move faster, stronger, and smarter than we ever have before, and limiting it to the confines of the suburbs and cities will only hamper our efforts. Instead, it's time to unleash our monster of industry onto the farmlands of this country, covering the fields, orchards, and grazing pens with high-tech, electrified equipment such as tractors, combine harvesters, and seeders. The slickened lightning that charges our great production efforts across this country will aim their sights down upon the farmer and his farmhands, making sure that American backs will never be broken again to produce the best yields our country can provide."
 USA_hart_68_our_burden_desc: "When it comes to industrial projects, history has shown that nine times out of ten, the consumers are the ones who take the hit for governments across the world trying their hand at improving both their factories and their markets. Since the inception of this country through our Founding Fathers, the freedom of enterprise and successful livelihood has been a guarantee, no, a damned mandate in being an American, and Philip Hart intends to keep it that way. Sure, the costs of improving American industry are heavy to bear for anyone involved in the process; however, the role of the government is to assume these difficulties so that no one else has to. And yes, the conservative budget hawks will continue on their path of whining and moaning over our operations. But, we have heard their complaints before, and we shall hear them again, but this time, we shall have things our way."

And now, with the Jews on the run from the Nazi menace bearing their antisemitic fangs across Europe and Americans of all forms in retreat with the Ku Klux Klan running amok, it is high-time for our administration to pave the way forward in terms of equality within this country. The biggest issue? Businesses, willingly segregating their consumers and disallowing some from partaking within their shops, restaurants, and more. No longer. By offering financial incentives for large and small businesses across this country to racially, sexually, religiously, and nationally desegregate, we encourage a new era of freedom in the free market for all Americans. The current of the economy flows stronger with the more dollars pushing through the market, and we have got to get every American out there spending freely and spending large."
 USA_hart_68_fine_clockwork_desc: "The Land of the Free. The Home of the Brave. The Rise above one's Position. That is the American story, our legacy, our mark upon this world. For President Hart, it is everything, his lifeblood, his ambition, and his own story. The more we prosper, the more we progress, the more we journey forth into a place past the brink of our history in terms of efficiency, potential, and providence. However, if we make these leaps and bounds blinded by the glories of our work, so terribly will we crash to the Earth, torn asunder by our own stretching beyond our limits. Instead, we will implement a consistent check upon our work, continuously humbling ourselves in our strides towards a better America for all. By yearly checking into our accomplishments, we choose to approach our mission with intelligence, humility, and just the right amount of dedication to make our program really work, and make Philip Hart the face of a new America."
 USA_hart_68_the_cooperative_act_of_desc: "Which side are you on? We're on the side of the working man. It is time to stop listening solely to corporate lobbyists and listen to the working man too. The Hart Administration will not budge when it comes to the thousands of Unions across the country, and the millions of workers that make up those unions.\n\nAnd to ensure the cooperation of future administrations, we will attempt to pass the Cooperative Act. A resolution to stand on the side of the worker no matter the one presiding over 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
 USA_hart_68_catapult_desc: "It's working! It's really working! What this administration has dedicated the past few years of their lives has bravely looked onto a formerly broken America and declared "No more." From the empathy of Philip Hart, to the bright smile of Chep Morrison, to the stalwartness of Harry Truman, to the gracious mind of Jane Jacobs. Each and every single person in this cabinet has dedicated themselves to a higher cause, a cause dedicated to the Americans from every single corner of this country, to provide them to a life made better, a home built sturdier, a city feeling safer, and an existence more...comfortable. That's it, that's the word! No more will Americans shudder after the horrors they felt within the wicked triumph of Adolf Hitler, Hirohito, and Mussolini. Instead, Americans can kick their feet up high, look out their window, and finally, finally let out that held-in breath they have been forced to hold in for the past two decades."
 USA_hart_68_the_second_american_revolution_desc: "For the vast majority of Americans, the bedrock of who they are as a person comes from their education. Memories often first hold onto playground incidents and childhood friends, interests click into place during long classes and lectures, fuzzy ideas are sharpened and solidified through high school and, for those who pursue it, grown through higher education. Our first friends, first successes and humiliations, and first social milestones all come during this time of learning. A great educational system takes in the young and makes them into bright, empathetic, intelligent men and women who are ready to live a productive, healthy, happy life.\n\nWhy, then, does our system fall so short of these lofty ideals? Why do children forced to digest slavish propaganda to the Emperor in Yokohama or to the Führer in Frankfurt compete with and surpass the knowledge of American students in inner New York City or the plains of Nebraska?\n\nThere are historical reasons, of course, but they all amount to excuses. Reasonable ones, perhaps, but excuses all the same, and what our young ones need are solutions, not platitudes. Those who did not have the chance to obtain a formal education cannot be left to rot while the nation moves on without them. What America desperately needs is a restored, modern education system, informative and all-encompassing, able to both bring in the young and teach the old. Their teachers must be the finest in the world, their meals nourishing and substantial, their materials shiny and new.\n\nThe youth are the future of this country. Let's treat them as such."
 USA_hart_68_competition_and_innovation_desc: "There's a lot which America loves about her schools. America loves football, the Friday night lights on the high school gridiron or the epics which play out between her colleges every Saturday. America loves the prestige of its best, the accomplishment of simply making it into Harvard or Yale. America loves the research and the inventions which emerge from her highest institutions, building a better future for the country and the world.\n\nMost of all, though, America loves itself a good competition. The common thread between school sports, school admissions, and school innovation in America is competition. Michigan and Ohio State go at each other's throats not just because they're close, but because over a century of hatred between them and their states has tendered something far beyond simple grievances. The same story plays out in institutions great and small around the country, extending far beyond campus or even academia, puncturing the fabric of the American spirit. America is not the only nation on Earth with competitions or rivalries, but it may be the only nation where crushing your rivals and being the best is so deeply ingrained into every fiber of its being.\n\nThus, when we go to Congress to plead our case, perhaps a change of angle should be considered. No more pleading for cash, no more bland charts and graphs. We will make it very clear that this is the greatest competition in human history, and what good American can turn down a great competition?\n\nNo more shall Americans simply care about the way in which the wars go or the fortune of their political parties, or how the sports seasons are shaping up. They will gather around the television from Tampa to Tacoma, they will watch the best of our children create grand new things, and they will cheer in the knowledge that Americans, not Nazis or Pan-Asianists, will be the ones who set the course of the future."
 USA_hart_68_let_freedom_ring_desc: "There is no symbol in the world so symbolic of liberty as the Stars and Stripes. From that fateful July almost 200 years ago to today, the flag of the United States has signified the greatest values which man strives to achieve - that of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Millions have flocked to her golden shores with little more than the idea of starting anew and the hope of better things ahead, from the first Puritans in Massachusetts to the waves of refugees fleeing the dark tide of fascism. Perhaps it is telling that the spirit of the American Dream lives on so strongly in many of these recent arrivals, those who have seen the crushing oppression of Europe, Africa, and Asia firsthand and were fortunate enough to escape it.\n\nThe optimism of the immigrants is not shared by those who grew up in these United States. Our youth are disaffected, unhappy, malaised. They have grown up in a world where America is, for the first time, rank with the bitter taste of failure. The twin defeats on both fronts of the Second World War are ones which Phil Hart knows personally, and the ensuing decades of social fury and discontentment has created a whirlpool of dismay and radicalism. How can we hope for a brighter future if our children have no hope themselves?\n\nThe spirit of Lady Liberty cannot continue to wither away like this. Our sons and daughters must have that flame of hope lit within them once again. They must be reminded of the evil extremists who wreak havoc across the seas, of how their country resolutely soldiers on as the bright light in the darkness. It will take more than feel-good stories to end the radical swirls that consume American youth, but every grand program needs an early foundation. Let's make ours a strong one."
 USA_hart_68_come_home_america_desc: "How can we treat our veterans the way we do today? Those brave boys who went overseas to fight and die in the hills of England and the jungles of the Pacific have, in the chaos and despair of our losing effort, been left behind with only meager support to guide them. The same goes for those men who marched to Africa and Indonesia in the support of fuzzy foreign interests, coming home missing arms or legs or spirit. Still, they are subjected to the same overworked and overstretched system which their fathers were forced to work with, their broken bodies preventing them from career opportunities and their experiences finding no place in civilian life. Eisenhower did his best to treat the men he commanded well, but even his efforts have proven insufficient. Veterans are left in destitution, begging on street corners like the Civil War soldiers of a century ago.\n\nPhilip Hart is a veteran of World War II. He served throughout the defense of England, earning a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He saw the very worst of humanity alongside his compatriots, and he watched them fall in battle under heavy fire. He will not allow the men who remain to waste away, devoid of opportunities or hope.\n\nA premier effort is being made to pass an expanded G.I bill through Congress, one which will expand the support network for veterans and open the gates for those who have served their country to attend America's finest universities. There are some murmurs about the details, but no Senator would dare oppose legislation of this nature outright - and with such soft opposition, its success is practically incontrovertible. Soon, Uncle Sam will extend his lanky hand to the men who have served him well, and he will pay them back for their sacrifice."
 USA_hart_68_lessons_for_life_desc: "When the average citizen thinks of the Army, their mind immediately turns to tanks, guns, bombs, and planes. One can hardly blame them. After all, the purpose of the Army is to defend America's interests through military force. The truth is, however, that the military serves a purpose far beyond simply training its men how to hold a gun. In the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, or otherwise, men enter the service as civilians and emerge as honed, disciplined leaders. President Hart would know - after all, he's a veteran himself, and he has the scars to prove it.\n\nCritically, however, the Army is not simply limited to soldiers. Divisions need all sorts of positions to be filled, and the Engineers are high up on that list. Those crucial elite march in front of and behind their compatriots, building bridges and barricades ahead of the men while erecting bases and roads to aid their operations. Additionally, the Engineers help rebuild decimated civilian infrastructure and buildings where war has left its mark. To be blunt, no war could be fought or won by the United States without the hard work of its logistical elements such as the Engineers.\n\nSo why, then, are so many of our military engineers allowed to simply languish without civilian projects when their tours expire? Why is it that Army Engineers are not fast-tracked into electronic and scientific jobs, able to help continue America's growth while being paid handsomely for it? Indeed, why are so few former soldiers given a path into engineering? Electronics industries have created staggering progress in the computing field, and Hart's agenda calls for vast civilian infrastructure overhauls. It's only smart to put two and two together. If we're going to achieve our lofty goals before the Germans or Japanese complete theirs, it'll be necessary."
 USA_hart_68_keeping_veterans_off_our_streets_desc: "A man sits at the corner of Main and 4th, beard scraggly, eyes sunken. His clothes are dirty and ragged at the edges, and he smells faintly of marijuana. Passersby take a wide berth to avoid him, their eyes flicking around to the cars, the streetlight, the others around them - anything to avoid eye contact. Not one of them thinks to toss a coin into his crumpled green hat, nor do they take more than a cursory glance at his cardboard sign, letters scrawled in black marker - "PLEASE HELP A VETERAN".\n\nThe only thing more tragic than the plight of this once-proud soldier is the fact that he isn't the only one.\n\nThese soldiers have given their all for this country. They went overseas to fight for her ideals or for the freedoms of others, defending our nation from Nazism and Fascism. They sacrificed their bodies, their minds, and their souls to bear witness to the evils of the Reich and the Empire - and for their sacrifice, too many have been rewarded with nothing more than a cold street corner and the promise that the VA will get to them eventually. For many, it's a day that never comes.\n\nThis vast oversight is a scar that has remained on our country's conscience for far too long, and President Hart has no intention of letting it stay any longer. A bill to expand the VA further is sailing smoothly through Congress, soon to deliver itself on the President's desk, where he will take his victory and show it for all to see. A guaranteed victory it is indeed, for not even the most conservative fiscal hawk is willing to stand against supporting those who have put themselves on the line for our country."
 USA_hart_68_the_sacred_right_desc: "America's foundation was built on many things. Everyone knows the passage about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, just as they know about the American Dream and the grand idea of carving one's own path to success. Yet the central pillar to everything comes in a process that today is so sacred, yet so routine - the vote. The American Experiment is what truly defines America, the oldest continuous modern democracy in the world. Such lofty status is even more impressive in this time of darkness and authoritarianism, and it is a status which all decent citizens can agree must be maintained.\n\nBut for many of our brightest youth, they don't get the chance to participate in democracy for themselves before they fight for it. Too many young men, fresh out of high school, have found themselves drafted into, fighting in, and dying in wars while having no choice in any part of their involvement. Between the age of 18 and 21, it is possible - and at times even likely - that a student can be sent off to war without ever having the chance to dissent. Too young to vote, but old enough to die? President Hart can't in good conscience keep such an unfair situation in place.\n\nA solution does exist in the 24th Amendment, which has been working its way into the halls of state legislatures nationwide. The proposal to lower the voting age to 18 has raised some eyebrows among those who are wary of so-called entitlement, and the amendment has stalled for the time being. If we add our weight to the mix, though, we can win victories both political and moral - political in ensuring a friendly base of young voters, moral in it being the right thing to do. Philip Hart can't refuse that."
 USA_hart_68_american_athletics_desc: "There aren't many things Americans agree on in this day and age. Our political divides reach deep into our public discourse, with dozens of different ideologues preaching their opinions on the right track for this country from all across the spectrum. Who can blame them? Even President Hart has difficulty understanding the pigheadedness of some of his most staunch opponents when it comes to solutions he finds common-sense. How must it feel for someone without the power of the Presidency, the average Joe whose political power is practically null?\n\nThere is at least one subject, though, which brings Americans together. Athletics. When the Olympics come around, citizens from coast to coast put aside their differences to cheer for the Stars and Stripes while her greatest athletes put on spectacular performances. Maybe it's American science which makes them so good. Maybe it's the American spirit. Whatever it is, the love of sports extends far past the Olympics into yearly rituals - baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and many other games hold a firm grip over America's heart from the lowest youth levels to the most lofty professionals. Bob Gibson, Joe Namath, Wilt Chamberlain - these are the American demigods of the modern day, far more beloved than any President could ever be.\n\nIt only makes sense, then, to promote the idea of the American athlete far and wide. These young men who make their country proud should be idolized by a generation of up-and-coming citizens, role models in both physical health and their humble attitude. When America is healthy, America is happy, and who's more convincing - a faceless government agency telling you to eat your veggies, or Willie Mays saying the same thing?"
 USA_hart_68_a_life_well_spent_desc: "To be frank, Americans today are scared of the military. They aren't scared of fighting it, or of its ability to defend them. They're scared of serving, of being shipped off halfway around the world to die in the hills of the Afrikaner Volkstaat or the jungles of Indonesia, of never seeing those they love again, of dying for a hazy cause which never seems to get any closer. Years of constant conflict involving our boys has led to a perception of today's military as little more than a march to the casket - a fatalistic view which has seeped into the ranks, dropping morale among frontline troops to the point of crisis and depressing recruitment to new lows.\n\nThe military is not a death sentence. Phil Hart can attest to that personally. What it truly is, according to him and his administration, is a place where young men can serve their community and their nation. The military is a profession, a job as real and as beneficial as any other. It disciplines and strengthens those who enter it, creates strong men who are ready to face the challenges of the world in far more ways than with a rifle. We must place a magnifying glass on the men who have joined the forces and grown into better men, those who have changed for the better instead of those who have been buried.\n\nOur soldiers are American heroes. The Hart Administration has seen to it that they are treated as such, both when in the military and once they've completed their service. Now, it's time to open the door to the next generation of recruits - the men that will keep America safe for decades to come."
 USA_hart_68_the_best_weapon_desc: "Our American youth are growing up into a world far different than the one even their parents knew. Technology has advanced at a mind-boggling pace, political developments are constant and only getting faster, and a wave of social change has swept through America's foundations. Our nation is under threat by twin fascist empires across both oceans. Few times in the nation's history have been so tumultuous as this, nor so crucial. A literal mind would see this situation and decide that the only way to succeed is through direct force - a stronger army, more nuclear weapons, more interventions. The simplest solutions, however, are not always the right ones.\n\nWhat President Hart believes is that America cannot simply fight to win the present. It must also plan and set up its future for success. To do that, we must invest in the future of our children, creating opportunities and building the foundations of a sturdy and able education. These bright youngsters will eventually take the reins from us, as the hand of time eternally dictates, and the best way to ensure their success is to give them a full deck of cards. Short-sighted opponents of Hart's long-reaching agenda may decry this as pointless speculative spending, but we in the White House know better. In twenty years, when our students begin charting America's course, they will have no choice but to thank us for our proactive work. It's the least we can do."
 USA_hart_68_under_god_desc: "Our kids don't understand what a special thing they have! What else can explain the startling rise of extremist ideology among those disaffected youngsters, who in many cases have abandoned the status quo which they believe has failed them? Decades of failure have led our children to believe that there is simply no hope left for them within the system, driving them out of healthy political exchange and into the siren song of communism or Nazism. Should these anti-American radicals get into the halls of power or, God forbid, the Presidency, who knows what sort of damage they could cause?\n\nSomeday, our children will take ownership of our Union, and we cannot simply allow violent radicals to make those future leaders into hardline saboteurs. They must be taught about how truly special their home is, read and learn the works of the great American writers, listen to the songs of America's best composers and musicians. They will know just how unique the American experiment is in human history and how critical it is that we defend the liberty and opportunity it offers. By the end of their education, students from coast to coast will emerge not as disenchanted brick-hurlers or heiling bigots, but instead as productive and intelligent citizens ready to create the brighter future they envision.\n\nThis is not to say that America is perfect as it stands, nor is it to claim that dissenting from the Government's viewpoint is wrong. President Hart does not seek to build a cult around himself. What he wants is for our schools to establish just how precious America and her liberty is, and in doing so convince those wayward sons and daughters of ours that the way to go is not to burn the system down, but to build a better nation for us all."
 USA_hart_68_no_stomach_left_behind_desc: "If you can believe it, some budget hawks in Congress have raised issues with our plan for free school lunches. They claim that the lost revenue will risk pushing schools into debt, that the federal government should not have final say over what children in local schools eat, or that federally provided lunches would be somehow inferior in quality to those privately sold. When all else fails, they bring up the tried and tested complaint of "socialism" to attempt to keep us from passing our agenda.\n\nFor the life of him, President Hart simply cannot understand why any good and decent person would oppose something so good-hearted and moral as giving our children free lunches. Shall our kids instead go hungry? Shall students get worse grades on their exams not out of any personal failings, but because all they can think about is the pit in their stomach? Some things are more important than a budget. Some expenditures are clearly worth their price tag. That this sort of legislation has garnered any sort of fight is a disappointing reminder of how dead-set our opponents are in their resistance to the Hart agenda.\n\nNo matter. Most Senators see our point of view that feeding our kids is the right thing to do. Those who don't can have an exciting time in their home state explaining why they think little Billy should go hungry. Only a great calamity will prevent us from succeeding here."
 USA_hart_68_the_elephant_in_the_room_desc: "To many Americans, the issue of school segregation was settled with Knox County Public Schools v. United States and the Civil Rights Act. With the stroke of a pen, the status quo of segregated education was torn down, and with the stroke of another, the new standard of equality was enforced. Finally, Black students could attend the same schools as their White counterparts, receiving the same quality of education and resources that will lead them into a lifetime of opportunity.\n\nOne frustrating point about segregationists, however, is how persistent they are. Despite the best intentions of those who penned the Civil Rights Act, these bigots have sniffed out and exploited loopholes left in the wording in order to sneakily enforce racial inequality. Through the guise of private schools, those Americans who aim to keep their children separate from other races have enrolled them into institutions which just so happen to have not quite gotten around to integrating their student body.\n\nSuch underhanded racism is blatantly against the law, one would think, but the truth is not so simple. Loopholes are loopholes for a reason. We will have to expect opposition, court battles and protests to stop our far-reaching agenda. It will be painful, costly, and may not fall in our favor. We pursue integration anyways, certainly not because it will be easy, but because it will be right."
 USA_hart_68_the_right_stuff_desc: "America loves its heroes. Why else do our citizens cheer so hard for the athletic greats, the Johnny Unitas' and Bob Beamon's of our nation? Why else would grand monuments to Washington and Lincoln be built, their faces carved into a mountain alongside Roosevelt and Jefferson over fifteen years of hard labor? Why else are men like John Wayne and James Dean so revered on the silver screen? These men and the characters they portray carved their own path, left their mark on the world around them, and became legendary in the American consciousness. Nothing motivates popular opinion quite like a good story and a face to pin it to.\n\nDoing the same with scientific breakthroughs is more difficult than in sports, but by no measure is it impossible. Scientists and engineers like Einstein and Edison are revered for their knowledge and innovation, creating brilliant theories and inventions with what tools they had at the time. With the sheer rate of scientific advancement in today's Cold War world, the selection of potential figureheads for America's newfound interest in the sciences spans a wide range. Astronauts, test pilots, inventors, biologists - the frontiers of mankind's knowledge are being pushed on all sides. By attaching a face to these wondrous achievements, we can inspire this nation to look to the future and wonder what's in store."
 USA_hart_68_janey_desc: "In 1961, a bold study by NASA selected twenty-five women to undergo a rigorous set of exercises in order to determine if women really had what it took to be astronauts. The results were surprising: thirteen passed the examinations with flying colors. These "Mercury 13" never made it into the astronaut program, but the example they set has overturned all conventional wisdom on the subject. One of those extraordinary women went on to marry the man who now sits in the Oval Office.\n\nJane Hart first discovered her love of flying during WW2 and went on to become the first woman in Michigan to obtain a helicopter pilot's license. When her husband, Philip Hart, entered politics, "Janey" would make waves by flying him to and from campaign events. A nonconformist and trailblazer, she is the model for the new American woman.\n\nIt's high time for President Hart to make his wife the centerpiece of some of his new initiatives on gender equality. She may have not flown into space, but Jane Hart will inspire America's girls to reach for the stars."
 USA_hart_68_after_hours_study_hall_desc: "For the average middle-class K-12 student, the seven hours of mandatory schooling they receive is a chore that must be gotten over with as quickly as possible. But for the countless children of meager means, school is something entirely different: a place of refuge, perhaps from a broken family or crushing poverty. To those children, we must expand upon their opportunities by allowing them to stay at school for extra hours, through so-called "study hall" programs. This way, America's teachers will have the opportunity to be the mentors that its disadvantaged children desperately need - and give them overtime pay in the process. A win-win for everyone."
 USA_hart_68_expand_the_public_school_program_desc: "For more than a decade, policymakers and concerned parents have wondered why Johnny can't read. We claim to be a city upon a shining hill, and yet, for a noticeable chunk of our population, a good education remains hard to find. There are places within this country where there are barely any schools for miles around, and many are falling through the cracks. We must do everything in our power to fill the education deserts in America, and once that's done, then we can start worrying about how to improve the schools we already have. President Hart will direct the Department of Education to transfer additional funds to the states for the construction of new schools in underserved communities. Hopefully, nobody will have to ask again why Johnny can't read."
 USA_hart_68_on_ice_desc: "If America is to once again become a shining city upon a hill, she must not close herself off, but share her light with all the world. Ever since the War, academia has been walled off between the various spheres of the superpowers, hindering the exchange of ideas and promoting insularity. Reversing this trend may not fully be possible while the Cold War rages, but the Japanese may be amenable to a less radical proposal: organize a series of international "olympiads" in subjects such as math, chemistry, physics, etc. that students from all over the OFN and Co-Prosperity Sphere alike can participate in. By channeling our competition into more peaceful activities, we can cool the tensions between the United States and Japan... and show the world what America's youths are truly capable of. Let's just hope the studious Orientals don't wrack up too many victories, or this initiative could blow up in our faces."
 USA_hart_68_intrastate_competition_desc: "Despite our administration's emphasis on cooperation between all sectors of American society, we understand that sometimes a little competition can do wonders. America is a vast nation with hundreds of universities and colleges, and it's easy for even the brightest fish to get lost in such a large pond. Perhaps we could rectify this by formally establishing a series of national "olympiads" in subjects such as math, chemistry, physics, etc. that students from all over America can participate in. This way, we will be able to identify the best and the brightest even from a young age, and give them the tools they need to do great things."
 USA_hart_68_open_up_a_world_desc: "In the age of movies, television, and radio, many children look upon books as an antiquated medium of communication and entertainment. Why waste your time staring at words and trying to conjure up an image in your head when you can feast your eyes on the latest Hollywood special effects, no thinking required? Well, it's the last part that's the problem. Books are the whetstones of the mind, and the more children read, the greater the chance of excelling in school and subsequently their careers. We must launch initiatives to get our kids reading books again, in our schools and libraries. Janey could come in handy with this one - the kids just love her. We should give her a special "storytime" program on public television, and combine it with an advertising campaign or two. If all the kids are watching the boob tube, perhaps we can make it work for us."
 USA_hart_68_having_fun_isnt_hard_desc: "To the average American, the word "library" conjures the image of a silent, boring space not too much different from a funeral home... but this view overlooks all the good they can bring. Public libraries are an oft-neglected yet still valuable service in the American social fabric - a "node," as Secretary Jacobs would say. Not only providing our citizens with free access to the nation's collective knowledge, they also serve as community centers where anyone can spend a few hours after work or school exploring the world of the written word. They are meeting places that draw communities closer together and keep restless youths off the streets. Secretary Jacobs has proposed funding the construction of hundreds of new public libraries across the country, as well as other initiatives to make the library a more attractive and, more importantly, fun place to visit. Storytime, arts and crafts, even vocational training. The sky's the limit."
 USA_hart_68_national_testing_standards_desc: "Though the Hart Administration has done much to promote the improvement of education across America, one remaining flaw in our system that sticks out like a sore thumb is the lack of a consistent measure of a student's progress. Instead, we are stuck with a patchwork of state testing standards of varying quality, many of which fail to evaluate their students adequately on basic skills that they'll need for the 20th century. If we can't know which students are falling behind, how can we possibly hope to give them the help they need?\n\nThis next step is going to be quite possibly the most radical reform the Hart Administration will put forth in regards to education. We will propose the establishment of a national set of standardized tests that all schools across America will use to evaluate students. Called the National Educational Testing Standard, or NETS for short, this move will represent an unprecedented expansion of federal authority over education - a field traditionally regarded as the domain of the states. Of course, such an act will undoubtedly infuriate America's most ardent defenders of states' rights, and even alienate moderates by raising the threat of "big government overreach." However, President Hart knows that the adoption of NETS is the only way to truly guarantee the competitiveness of our schoolchildren compared to their counterparts in Germany or Japan. It's one small step, but a giant leap for America."

One field of study making strides is agriculture, much to the pleasure of American farmers. Each harvest provides access to better equipment, seeds, and fertilizer than the last. As such, this unlikely relationship between humble farmer and august academic is one that the Hart Administration has an interest in fostering."

These are but a few of the wonderful advancements that will be made easily accessible for the farmers of America."
 USA_hart_68_combat_rural_flight_desc: "The prosperity of the American city should never be dependent on the death of a small town. Rural flight has been an unfortunate reality that has plagued America for decades. Regrettably, our administration has turned a blind eye to this...\n\nIt is high time to set things right and address the stem issue causing rural flight. A lack of opportunity. We will flood rural America with money for social programs, education, resources, electrification, the whole nine yards. Rural America is the heart of America, and if it remains poor, then we as a nation are penniless."
 USA_hart_68_ink_and_skin_desc: "There is not an American today who is unaware of the Civil Rights Movement. The long-standing struggle of the Black community to achieve equality in America has ebbed and flowed since its beginnings a century ago. From Frederick Douglass to W.E.B Du Bois to Martin Luther King Jr. to innumerable others, the brave actions of Black men and women in the face of vast discrimination and brutality is nothing short of incredible. After far too long, civil rights legislation has been devoted to breaking racism's most evident bindings, ending segregation, denial of constitutional rights, and workplace discrimination. To many in America, this signaled the culmination of the fight. Inequality had been defeated, and the country could rest, heal, and relax. Such is the hope of the majority of Americans who are now more interested with law and order rather than further racial conflict.\n\nUnfortunately, the spirit of Jim Crow still lives on in the weeds of America, away from the eye of John Q. Public. It lives on in redlining, in secret covenants to maintain segregation, in the dogwhistles and unfair policies. No, discrimination isn't dead - it's just gotten smarter, and we must get smarter to oppose it effectively.\n\nTo many White Americans, President Hart's promise to further the fight for equality evokes nervous shifting in their seats. What does he mean when he says he's going to balance the programs of the New Deal? What is the White House planning when they talk about housing inequality or urban renewal? Is this going to affect their neighborhoods, their ways of life? All this and more means the President's road will not be any easier than his predecessors. It will require sacrifice, compromise, and disappointment. What it will result in, if successful, is a more perfect union for everyone - and if that isn't worth the effort, then there isn't much that is."
 USA_hart_68_the_game_of_life_desc: "There is an ancient Chinese "four-character idiom" that speaks to the ultimate end goal of Philip Hart, now that he is President of the United States. Its literal translation is "rich-country-peace-people", and as one might expect it means a reality in which the country is prosperous and the people are at peace. Whereas we are working to build this reality within the United States through tireless labors in education, desegregation, and transportation throughout the country, it will all be for nothing if we cannot manage to fix the most basic problem beleaguering many of our cities: that many people simply don't have the opportunity they sorely need to do well in the game of life.\n\nSo many Americans, especially in the cities, are forced to move from one house to another by scoundrel landlords and the vagaries of employers. Worse yet, they struggle to find jobs, which in turn destroys their financial security, and thus forces them to prioritize the most basic, primal needs of survival over other meritorious things crucial for their own success and that of their children. How is this a good thing? How does this resemble the great American Dream? If we let things carry on like this, are we truly any better than the fascists and the Yamatos?\n\nObviously, we will not wait a moment longer. People need a house, a job and an education. They need a solid place to call their home, so they can peacefully raise the next generation. It is our duty to secure a simple life for our people; we will not fail or falter in this."
 USA_hart_68_Making_America_desc: "The essence of Fascist Italy at its inception was blind adherence to the "King-Emperor" and the Duce (or "Douche", as DOS staffers like to call him). The essence of Germany is an even more blind devotion to race, to genocide, and to the Fuehrer. The essence of Japan is psychotic ultranationalism, worship of that bookish marine biologist they call an Emperor, and colonialist brutality that might even give King Leopold pause. What, then, is the essence of America?\n\nIt is simple: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed..."\n\nYet at the same time, to our undying shame, we must remember another set of words. "What, to the slave, is your Fourth of July? ... To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages."\n\nOur work will not be complete unless we can prove these words wrong, and make it so that all Americans, regardless of race, can partake in the freedoms handed down to us by the Founding Fathers."
 USA_hart_68_cultivating_a_community_desc: "In the places many of our ancestors called home - Europe, Africa, Asia - the power was often held in the hands of a lot of indifferent grandees far away from where many of the ordinary people lived. If there was a disaster, or a famine, or problems with lawbreakers, the people would often have to break their necks and backs going to the gates of the palace for help, only to be thrown out. Even if they were not sent away, their pleas could often be - and often were - ignored by preoccupied politicians, overextended bureaucrats, or put-upon rulers. When this was not due to ill-will, such inaction was often because of a simple inability to do anything about the problem.\n\nBut many of the Native American communities, just like the most successful local communities in the Old World, knew better than to rely on far-away powers for all but the most intractable issues. Instead, they took refuge in one another and relied on the tools and people they had in the closest locality - maybe no more than a five- or ten-mile radius - to see their problems solved. They built connections of friendship and family with one another, and grew used to one another, thus developing a synergy that governments and supranational bodies often sorely lack.\n\nAll this reflects the reality that the most responsive of all governing bodies is a community, especially a local one. Another reality we need to reflect on is that there aren't enough of such things in the United States. We need to do something about this, and quickly; by enabling the building of strong local communities, we cut the burden on the government. At the same time, crime will recede and business will boom."
 USA_hart_68_hitting_the_town_desc: "No business is more meritorious and more capable of contributing positively to its neighbors and leaving a non-toxic legacy behind than your average small business in a typical urban district. Local branches of national - or, God forbid, multinational - companies simply do not compare in terms of raw benefit to their surroundings.\n\nEven in the President's own experience, the businesses that allowed this or that national brand to taint them were nothing compared to the mom-and-pop stores that competed with them. That's why he, and a lot of his closest friends and confidants too, like to say things like "You gotta love local business!"\n\nThe President has determined that now is a perfect time to prove that those words are more than mere talk. By seeing local businesses grow, we will see local wealth and the power of the American dollar grow at the same time."
 USA_hart_68_clocking_in_desc: "Regularity and a solid, likely undisturbed, schedule---it's one of the things President Hart misses most about his life pre-presidency.\n\nNow that he is in the White House, Hart must expect someone to call at 3:0 a.m. in the morning because the Germans have been acting up again or some ultranationalist Japanese have besieged the American embassy. But before that the regular rhythm of Senate work, tours of the constituency, and family time was a consolation that stood him in good stead during his tenure.\n\nPresident Hart knows for a fact that many other Americans feel the exact same way (though he notes their jobs are probably very different from any he's ever taken up). Clocking in and clocking out—such a work schedule is a great basis for the American worker to base his week on. That kind of regularity, and the benefits thereof, will in turn also encourage people to work at all in the first place, which in turn will increase the effectiveness of the millions of labor-hours put in by Americans every day."
 USA_hart_68_the_future_is_you_desc: "Through the millennia of human history and into the present-day, Earth's various peoples have preserved local cohesion through activities in their home communities and regions.\n\nFor instance, the old towns of Southern Spain gather in 'brotherhoods' during Holy Week every year to perform Passion plays and carry great statues of Christ and the Virgin Mary. We are told that the Muslims congregate in groups at the end of their version of Lent, Ramadan, to eat sweet and savoury foods in amounts larger than they ate during the entire month before.\n\nIn many countries, all one needs is a field and a goalpost—or, failing that, some shoes—and then they can get to playing soccer (or 'football' as they call it for some reason). Similarly, given what little we have heard from the ruins of Russia, we know that one of the few things that unite those squabbling statelets is enjoyment of the old, great game of chess. And President Hart has been told by James Abourezk of small towns in Syria that speak the language Christ Himself spoke, held together across religious boundaries by their study of and love for that language.\n\nWe, in America, have our own share of such activities, too—but we need more of them, for all Americans young and old. The communities we have mentioned before hold together because they eat, work, play, and in some cases pray together. We, too, can and must encourage this, for as we have made clear this entire time, the strength of community is incredible."
 USA_hart_68_the_flood_gates_desc: "We have, at last, completed the long work of crafting an effective recipe for the construction of successful American communities able to match and surpass the cohesion, achievement, and economic output of the best in our country and its neighbors and rivals.\n\nBy a combination of, among other things, promoting work scheduling, strengthening community cohesion, pouring funds into community activities, and backing local business, we have created communities capable of guiding themselves, make their own money, and in general simply further the work that we have put into ensuring the best they can possibly be.\n\nHaving succeeded in this, it is time for us to receive in turn fruits for our labor.\n\nAs the farmer labors over a single plant or tree and receives in due time the return for his or her diligent work, so we too will be able to oversee the successful economic results of our tireless efforts. We have ensured that the children and the elderly will be able to live out their lives in greater peace than ever before, and that the people that come into the workforce both public and private will be healthier, happier, and more loyal to the United States and its ideals than they were in the past."
 USA_hart_68_americas_sport_desc: "The Japanese and Germans, when they can crack jokes without getting the Kenpeitai or the Gestapo on their asses before they say "I worship my head of state as if he was the Lord God Himself," love to make fun of American football. Hell, even the Canadians and Cubans do it; in fact, easily 99% of the foreigners that know about football run around making fun of how it allegedly amounts to running around with an egg that never touches the person's feet.\n\nThankfully, we in the White House don't stake our nation's honor over what American football is and is not—rather, we prefer to express our pride in a sport with a far greater international reach: baseball.\n\nRecently, it has become clear to us that baseball could do with far greater investment: we deem that the solution is simple—give it more funding. People have poisoned themselves with partisanship and paranoia; we need to incite them to lay down their brickbats and pick up a baseball. Let them fight for their local sports team rather than their damned old political party, and at the same time strengthen the bonds within their communities."
 USA_hart_68_sundown_desc: "Despite the recent progress of the United States government in the work of preserving civil rights, there are some extremely bold instances of racial discrimination that continue to take place in defiance of the declarations of the White House, the Supreme Court, and the United States Congress. Some of the most flagrant cases of these across the country have the presumption to outright ban racial minority groups from even existing within certain cities; these are the so-called 'sundown laws.'\n\nSundown laws have effectively butchered any method of nurturing any sort of racial justice within the cities that have them, even after the recent movements by the United States Government towards civil rights. Obviously, if this is permitted to continue, more horror stories of lynchings and other harassment will make their way to our desk, and the country will be ever-further destabilized. Therefore, President Hart and the White House leadership have undertaken to ban these at best deeply problematic diktats nationwide."
 USA_hart_68_the_parade_desc: "Fiscal stimuli are frequently suggested during times of economic crisis - the government pours money into this or that district or sector to ensure it stays alive (if not thrives) into the short and medium term. However, it has also been that such fiscal stimuli can be used to seize the moment brought about by this or that policy—to provide governmental support for a fledgling socioeconomic venture in which the State believes.\n\nThis latter type of stimulus is what is on the bill currently going through the United States Congress. Communities in cities participating in the current Urban Renewal Initiative will, via major financial stimulus packages, be granted federal backing in their plans to expand construction in local sites.\n\nIf this can be brought about, it will not only strengthen the local economy but bring about vital cultural change in the exact direction America needs to outcompete the Nazi and Japanese menaces."
 USA_hart_68_midnight_basketball_desc: "Local youth-targeted activities, funded and promoted by people from the communities in question, will keep youth that are out late on the streets from doing malicious things born out of poverty.\n\nIf an inner-city kid is out with his friends making himself practice his feints and triple threats for the midnight basketball game coming up next Friday, he will be too busy to sample drugs or harass his classmates. If someplace else a young man has forced his nose into a book because the janitor keeps beating him every which way in evening chess club meetings and he wants to try and leverage Fischer or Capablanca's tactics to regain his honor, he'll have absolutely no time to try any of these life-ruining substances or worse yet to sell them.\n\nIt's really quite simple. If the youth just have to be out late on the streets, it's best that they be with others playing harmless games and growing that way, rather than being corrupted into learning things that will send them into the cold grave far sooner than is just for kids their age."
 USA_hart_68_lampposts_desc: "Since the early Greek and Roman times, lampposts (or 'street lights' as some officialistic pedants like to call them) have been a tool of great use to civil society and the state. Whatever unnamed ancient genius came up with the idea immediately saw results: the new contraptions lit up roads well enough where people had a clear path from point A to point B at night with a reduced risk of coming a cropper or being attacked without prior notice.\n\nYears have passed and we find ourselves in a far different time and place from the first users of the lamppost. Yet their use—and that of lighting on streets in general—remains obvious. If a street is dark, crime proliferates, injuries are frequent, and surveillance is rendered ineffective; if the street is well-lit, none of those are the case.\n\nLamp-posts are cheap, well-tested, and easy to install. It would be asinine for us not to move quickly on getting them implemented."
 USA_hart_68_in_action_desc: "Over the past few years the Hart Administration has done quite a lot to irritate the various assorted debt hawks in the United States Congress and civil society. Their screaming about this or that program—at times motivated by (c)overt racism or fear of losing some precious privilege of theirs—has become so frequent that the administration simply ignores it as background noise and the Beltway flap du jour.\n\nThis time, the debt-heads are foaming at the mouth like so many rabid raccoons because of the recent proposal to relieve some cities of the financial burdens the URI expansions are putting on them. Rather than forcing the cities to bear the burden alone, this proposal would transfer some of it to the government at a fair, competitive rate.\n\nThe fiscal hardliners look at this proposal and see 'blatant financial waste and adventurism', but they are as always flat out wrong: there is no choice for us but to move quickly to protect these cities from bankruptcy. Otherwise, the spending we in Washington directed them to ear-mark will do them in. The growing pains of the new American cities deserve our full attention. Only an irresponsible fool or an ill-willed villain would ignore them."
 USA_hart_68_the_crime_bill_desc: "Crime is the worst of all the everyday disasters that the average American and his or her government at all levels of society are forced to face. It takes many forms—drug-selling and possession, human trafficking, murder, sexual and physical assault, theft—and all of these are disastrous for society and damaging to the societal and economic fabric.\n\nContrary to the lies spouted by the Nationalists, we members of the Democratic Party recognize this quite well. Let there be no confusion: the Democrats are, and always have been, tough on crime. Though his concern for the public welfare might provide the assorted hardliners and Axis-lovers in society with an excuse to think differently, our President has never been an exception to this trend.\n\nThe President will now work with the U.S. Congress to draft a crime bill that can see a suitable plummet in criminal activity in cities, combined with proper enforcement. The most important focus of this bill will be less on preventing criminals from thriving than it will be on protecting innocent, law-abiding citizens of the United States of America."
 USA_hart_68_listen_bud_desc: "When a lazy teenage boy is given the "onerous" task of taking out the weeds in the garden, he will not ask for the weed-puller and get rid of them root and stem. Instead, he will run around with a shovel or some such and knock the heads and stems off the plants, leaving their roots completely untouched and allowing them to grow back in force several days later.\n\nThis is a perfect metaphor for the current strategy of drug enforcement. In too many cities, the average policeman uses draconian punishments on people possessing drugs without asking one word's worth of questions about who gave them the drugs.\n\nFortunately, we have a way to uproot the problem rather than just nip it in the bud. Direct security attention away from the folks possessing drugs and instead tackle the people giving them drugs, as in the planters and dealers. These scum are the source of the crime of possession; cutting them off from business would necessarily mean a decline in possession charges throughout the country."
 USA_hart_68_youth_employment_opprotunities_desc: "Let's not kid ourselves; the youth are the lifeblood of this nation and its future. To pretend otherwise would be a denial of not just our future - but our inevitable mortality as well. We're getting this country out of the jam our contemporaries put it in, but we can't do it alone. When your car gets stuck inside a rut, you don't get it out by simply flooring the gas pedal and hoping for the best. No, you get your passengers out; they push with all their might while you drive it out of the hole. That's why this country needs all hands on deck to get its economy back on its feet.\n\nEmployment courses, skill training and interning opportunities are just some things that we can offer our kids to prepare them for the future that we're creating. Not only does this keep them straying from the path of gang activity and homelessness, but it will also make sure that our heirs will do an even better job than we have of preparing their kids, as well."
 USA_hart_68_all_of_gods_children_desc: "It's simply a fact that some people are just more vulnerable to society's great ills - homelessness, drug abuse and crime - than other folks. It's a tragedy of the human condition, but it's part of it nonetheless. What isn't a fact is this inhumane notion that we should leave these people - our fellow man - to the wayside to rot in the churning dustbin of obscurity while we press on. What sets America apart from the Nazis is that we are not a nation built on callous greed and murderous hierarchy. To be sure, to know that a part of our nation is suffering and choosing not to do anything about it is murder. That is a choice, don't fool yourself.\n\nMy Presidency will not be a cruel one. Senators and Congressmen want to talk about getting people off welfare. What better way than to increase it until the baton passes and our thriving job market can genuinely uplift people from destitution? This does two things: it helps our economy bound to new heights but also allows us to spend less on welfare once our huddled masses have finally taken the liberty they so yearned for."
 USA_hart_68_review_sentencing_desc: "The only thing worse than making a mistake is denying that a mistake was made. We can acknowledge that our crime bill may be... too harsh, in some places. But that's okay- we can revise and rebuild it, trimming the fat while adding new and improved bits to better suit our needs. Maybe we punished petty crime too much, or completely focused on the wrong things- regardless of where we messed up, we have the rare opportunity to fix it, while still keeping the spirit and goal of the bill- to crack down on crime."
 USA_hart_68_zip_it_lock_it_desc: "How many debt hawks does it take to make the world a better place? None, they didn't want to spend tax money on an exploratory committee to brainstorm solutions.\n\nA rather unruly, vocal minority has formed across party lines, they are concerned at the enormous price tag our urban renewal is costing us. Hampering our ability to push benchmark bills through congress. To give into these debt hawks would render our goals defunct, and even make us lose progress. Therefore we must work hard to make the debt hawk agenda difficult to attain. It might get dirty at times, but it will be a necessity if we want our urban renewal to pack some punch."
 USA_hart_68_breaking_the_red_bars_desc: "On every map, there are lines; they represent national or state borders, roads, rivers, or mountains. They come in a variety of colors- blue, green, yellow. There is one kind of line, however, that should not exist on maps in President Hart's America- Redlining.\n\nRedlining, a holdover from America's racist past, is the practice of withholding certain services from neighborhoods or parts of cities that are deemed "dangerous" for those in charge of providing them. It is no coincidence, of course, that these "lower income neighborhoods" tend to be primarily African American.\n\nWe must put a stop to this unethical practice."
 USA_hart_68_alterative_movement_desc: "Buses, bikes, boots, boats, trains, trolleys, and trams. These are all alternatives to driving. The Hart Administration wants its cities to be a beacon of alternative transport. Driving won't have to be the only option to go to a concert, club, or wherever an urbanite wishes to go. It will also help keep people in shape, the option to walk is a big factor in health. So quite literally, it is a public health matter to present alternative forms of transport for the American people.\n\nWhether it is bike lanes, bus lanes, or elevated tracks. We will leave all options on the table for urban planners and architects."
 USA_hart_68_forever_mitus_desc: "Like their namesakes, they silently circle their prey, waiting for the opportunity to strike. They move silently, just under the waterline of the law, able to ruin lives. But people need them; people need the loan shark. By making it easier to get a real loan from a real bank, we will curb the overreliance on loan sharks and other shady figures that many impoverished communities face- and thus, solve two problems at once. This also plays into President Hart's banking reform- making banks more common and better staffed will allow wealth to flow into cities and into the pockets of those who had been previously denied it."
 USA_hart_68_americanist_cities_desc: "America is built on freedom and equality; it is in our founding documents, of course. Some American cities, however, do not reflect this honored tradition. Whether it is because of the sickly legacy of slavery and segregation, or the less violent (but still racist) redlining and gentrification, there are towns and cities all across the United States that are still starkly unequal for those of a different skin tone, or a variety of other things. We must tackle this issue; and rip out the weed from its root. Architecture that specifically elevates one group will be rebuilt- in Hart's America, all groups must be on the same footing.\n\nEveryone deserves the reach the American Dream."
 USA_hart_68_never_too_much_desc: "This might be a pyrrhic victory, but we scrounged together enough votes to force our bill through congress. This bill is everything we dreamed of for Public Housing. A multitude of subsidies, dozens of contracts to build new affordable housing, and money for much-needed maintenance and overhauls.\n\nNow, comes the bad part, we've unfortunately evoked the ire of the opposition. Debt Hawks are already angrily protesting on the floors of the House and Senate. All that matters, however, is that the people know we did this, and will hopefully vote in the next election. Nevertheless, President Hart has acknowledged that politics is a tough game, and we have claimed a small, hard-fought victory."
 USA_hart_68_rmoney_desc: "While it is not the housing bill we wished for, this modified version of the housing bill has the backing of George Romney and a gaggle of Republicans. Thus giving it some added legitimacy. The bill includes coverage for new public housing and overhauls for current dilapidated housing. It doesn't go the extra mile to provide maintenance and a plethora of subsidies.\n\nHowever, it did not invoke the ire of Debt Hawks and our own party. Beggars can't be choosers, we will take what we can get."
 USA_hart_68_rebuilding_the_bank_desc: "In the days of cowboys, sheriffs, and gold rushes, a town's post office was the most important building within it. Part bank, part meeting house, they were often the first part of a town constructed; or, in other cases, towns would simply spring up around them. They were the center of these old Western towns, often both literally and figuratively. President Hart wants to return to this echo of America's past. By once again allowing post offices to function as banks would solve a lot of problems presented to us by other, private banks. Not every town has the wealth or affluence for one of the fancy private banks to set up shop- but every town, simply by necessity, has a post office. In addition, having these banks be federally mandated will allow us to crack down on any sort of discriminatory policies taking place."
 USA_hart_68_the_chicken_hawks_desc: "Over the past few years the Hart Administration has done quite a lot to irritate the various assorted debt hawks in the United States Congress and civil society. Their screaming about this or that program has become so frequent that the Administration simply ignores it as background noise and the Beltway flap du jour. However, despite what some might surmise from this, we are not completely inattentive to them. In fact, we have developed an ability to tell several types of them apart.\n\nSome budget hawks just hate spending, period, and stand no hope of being convinced. Others, however, are mere budget contrarians—hence why they get called 'chicken hawks' at times. Rather than just generally shouting about waste, these individuals say, "Don't waste money on A, spend money on B instead!" By definition, therefore, these fellows are far easier to deal with than their hardline compatriots.\n\nLet us make some concessions to calm them down. We can give an earnings report, or boast about the sustainability of their programs that we have implemented. Between these, the fiscal contrarians will be shut up well and finely for a good while."
 USA_hart_68_stability_starts_at_home_desc: "Today we will completely misappropriate a quote of the Turkish President, Kemal Attaturk, who said that his policy consisted of 'peace at home, and peace in the world'. Though we believe in that in the sense that he and his Republican People's Party meant it, we also believe in it in a different sense that is, as it were, "closer to home."\n\nThe ability of any person, no matter their origin, to compete in the world relies on what they call home. Those with happy and prosperous households (regardless of wealth, for wealth alone does not make true prosperity) tend to have a far more advantageous initial trajectory than those with a broken home life. With a stable home life, one is enabled to face the world with strength—\n\n—and it is our duty to cultivate a city, a Nation, where that is available to all. If, thanks to our work, the USA becomes known as a place that successfully nurtures its children, the whole world— even the egomaniac genocidaires in Germania and Tokyo—will be forced to look to us for an example."
 USA_hart_68_new_incentives_desc: "These days the Hart Administration is being treated to a resurgence of one of the most annoying—not to mention dangerous—talking points that modern American governments have to cope with.\n\nLarge groups of people, especially social and fiscal conservatives, are complaining that President Hart's programs will disincentivize people from working because they can instead "rely on the government to give them money". They spread panic about welfare queens and lazy homeless bums in order to support their unrealistic viewpoint.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that that is not how things work, the cities and their funding must be defended lest the budget hawks tear them to bits while we aren't watching. We must make clear to these naysayers, especially the ones within our governing coalition, that the Hart Administration—no-one else—has brought cities from rags to riches specifically because of the strength of American labor."
 USA_hart_68_by_and_for_desc: "What's the point of producing all this fancy new equipment if we just ship it off to another country, never to be seen again? No, cities that produce appliances and tools should be encouraged to use them within those very own cities- even if it's just for efficiency's sake. "Made in America" is hugely important, of course; but "Used in America" is even more so. The local use and production is important as well; it should not have to be sent to some central warehouse in Idaho in order to be shipped back to the city from which it came- from the city that needs it.\n\nPresident Hart argues that the process of transporting this much-needed equipment from producer to consumer should be streamlined, rather than relying on existing (and quite antiquated) systems.\n\nIt must be rebuilt from the ground up."
 USA_hart_68_toss_the_dice_desc: "Now that the Hart Administration has dealt with public housing, it is time to go after housing itself. The last vestiges of segregation can be seen in the housing market. Whether it is the act of redlining, or the urban wealth actively pestering their towns to keep minorities from moving in. We will focus our efforts on overturning these subtle acts of racism, and making sure every American has an equal opportunity to live in the community they want to live in.\n\nIt will be an uphill battle, but so has every other challenge this Administration has taken on."
 USA_hart_68_uniquely_american_desc: "There is a uniqueness to American Racism that makes it extra hurtful. It is mundane, it slowly saps away opportunity from inner cities. It is seen in the black soldiers who step up to liberate the oppressed people of the world and come home to a country that forces them to sit in the back of the bus. It is seen on water fountains, 'concerned' parents who don't want their children going to school with people of different colors.\n\nWe have handicapped the racism gripping the south for generations, and with a little more effort we can keep it down for good."
 USA_hart_68_wave_2_desc: "When a tsunami recedes, it only comes back stronger. The same can be said for our urban renewal projects. We have given some time for the first wave to yield results, and now it is time to send in the second wave. New loans, more bike lanes, improved public transport, trees, trees, and a few more trees! Whatever a city needs, we will provide it. Housing? Zoning reform? We'll go the extra mile and give juicy contracts to construction companies. We will make sure the American city will be the envy of the world!"

 USA_hart_68_breaking_the_hart_of_the_world_desc: "The sword is but one of many tools a President has at their disposal. The previous administrations seem to have forgotten that.

It's time to speak softly and carry a big stick."
 USA_hart_68_the_truman_doctrine_desc: "Harry Truman is an...interesting fellow, and it is reflected in his foreign policy. Essentially, America is always in a position to make demands. Even after our bloodied nose in World War 2. The shameful treaty ports, the loss of Hawaii. Despite all this, Uncle Sam is the one with the bargaining chip. Fifty years ago this was a traditional stance on foreign policy. In this strange world, however, it is anything but ordinary."
 USA_hart_68_new_blood_desc: "Henry Kissinger, like many statesmen, served in World War 2. Together, they lived through the stunning defeat the allies suffered. As the old wounds heal, these two veterans in high office have a new vision for the world. They share similar foreign policy stances. Hence why he is President Hart's National Security Advisor. Together, they will sketch out a plan for the free world to defeat the reactionary forces of the Reich and the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 USA_hart_68_midnight_desc: "On the streets of Manila, the jungles of Malaya, off the Ivory Coast, and in the scrub of South Africa. Wherever the free world struggles, we will come to the rescue. The only war that mattered, we lost. Any war that we fight directly will end in nuclear annihilation. It is in this blurred line that Harry Truman believes America will excel.\n\nProxy Wars, far and wide, secret agents clandestinely undermining the clay feet that these colossi stand upon. This is how the light of liberty bathes the world in its glow. One step at a time."
 USA_hart_68_moonrise_desc: "Alice Springs, Auckland, Thunder Bay, Saskatoon, Belize City, Nassau. These are all cities lacking US bases. The Hart Administration is of the belief that we should change that. A multitude of US bases in our allies countries will strengthen the interconnectedness of our alliance. As such, it has been decided that a new wave of overseas bases will be constructed outside of the country. Thus giving us and our allies better operability beyond our borders."
 USA_hart_68_dawn_desc: "Money, arms, and a little bit more money. That is exactly what the OFN needs. The Hart Administration will flood the alliance with obscene amounts of cash and weapons. If the Reich and the Sphere scope us out, they will find a diverse webbing of races and religions. All of them armed to the teeth and itching for an enemy in their crosshairs.\n\nThe adversaries of democracy and liberty have taken so much from so many. We will hold on to what we've got, for the few who are still free."
 USA_hart_68_starlight_desc: "Kissinger has hit the road again to cement our diplomatic legacy into the history books. This time, he is attempting to negotiate a nuclear treaty. Mr. Kissinger knows that nuclear disarmament is out of the question, but a cap can be determined. In an optimal scenario, a scaledown of the nuclear arsenal would be most optimal.\n\nThe situation is volatile and will require the President to put his best foot forward with our enemies. If it succeeds, however, it will be a big step away from nuclear annihilation."
 USA_hart_68_twilight_desc: "The Central Intelligence Agency. It sends a shiver through the spine of Abwehr and Tokumusoukan alike. Unfortunately, it gives President Hart the heebie jeebies too. The daily briefings can be...hard to stomach.\n\nNevertheless, the President has reluctantly acknowledged the soft power that this robust secret agency exudes. With some encouraging words from Lansdale and Kissinger, President Hart has given his tacit approval for the CIA to go all the way. Whether in shadowy back-alleys, or smoky Officers clubs, it will all pass by the President's desk."
 USA_hart_68_sunset_desc: "Sunset in Europe. It has a lovely ring to it. The Reich is a shambling corpse, desperately trying to stitch its rotting limbs together. It will be a big, bloody rock bottom that will occur without our intervention. Kissinger and Hart see an avenue of negotiation with the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but the Reich? It cannot be reasoned with.\n\nAs the late Joseph Goebbels said best, "If we have power, we'll never give it up again unless we're carried out of our offices as corpses"\n\nAnd so they shall leave as corpses, and take Europe down with them."
 USA_hart_68_breaking_the_ice_desc: "Kissinger has done it again! Deftly maneuvering us into a favorable bargaining position against the Japanese Empire. This status is fleeting, though. It is now or never to begin our offensive. Not on the battlefield, but in the halls of Marine-laden embassies. On the airwaves of tense diplomatic backchannels.\n\nWith any luck, we will negotiate the return of the treaty ports, and if all goes according to plan, we will bring Hawaii back into the fold. It is time to mend our shameful scars and make our mark on history."

  chep.firstdays.1.t: "First Days"
  chep.firstdays.1.desc: "Lord, President Chep Morrison thought, give me the strength to make it through this day. At least this day. He wasn't sure if the Lord was listening.\n\nMovers swarmed around the White House like ants on sugar, stripping it bare of all that Phil had brought with him and leaving the shell behind. One armoire brushed by Chep with a bump and a muffled "sorry", another couch nearly cut him off at the knees, finally prompting him to move into his office and watch the train of furniture go by. Damn, he thought. Phil brought a lot of things with him. Zsa Zsa would fill that space nicely with all the things she liked to drag around with her. His smile remained for all of the three seconds it took to remember the gravity of his situation.\n\nPresident. He was the goddamn President. Why? He'd never wanted to be President, nor had he ever intended to be President. All this responsibility, all the eyes on him - no. Zsa Zsa was the celebrity here. He could enjoy that sort of attention in moderation, but the thought of the entire nation's gaze boring into his every move for months on end made him nauseous. And that wasn't even considering that the fiscal hawk bastards in Congress were going to try and gut him from chin to crotch...\n\nA chair getting dragged by him caught his eye. "Hey, hey, wait." He blurted, catching the mover by surprise. "That's, uh, that's mine. I use that... chair. Can I - can you - put it in here?"\n\nSlowly, the mover complied. Shit, Chep thought, looking on. He really wasn't ready for all this."
  chep.firstdays.1.a: "Responsibility, asked for or not."

  chep.firstdays.2.t: "What The Hell Is This?"
  chep.firstdays.2.desc: ""Darling, can I be honest with you?"\n\nChep blinked, his gaze drawing up from the desk to the hazel eyes of his wife. The First Lady, now. Jesus Christ, he was still President. How long had it been? A day or two, maybe a week, but good God if it didn't feel like a year already. So many cameras, so many microphones, so many damn papers. How'd Phil put up with it for two terms?\n\nZsa Zsa didn't wait for him to actually react for her to keep talking. "You look awful, darling. Absolutely dreadful. Your suit's all wrinkled, you look pale - when's the last time you slept? It certainly wasn't with me."\n\n"... I'm sorry, honey." He mumbled, running a hand through hair which had been rapidly thinning even before he'd gotten this high up. "I just don't even know where to start. Half the time it feels like I'd be better off getting shot at by the Nazis again. I-I like the media, I like politics, you know that, but this is too much. Just too much."\n\nZsa Zsa considered that for a moment, then delicately wrapped her arms around his shoulders, resting her head beside his. "My poor darling," she murmured in his ear. "You need a good cocktail party to cheer you up, is that right?"\n\n"No. Not tonight. I couldn't if I wanted to with all these cabinet meetings."\n\n"Hmph." The First Lady sighed. "Well, I'll be going anyway." She stood back up again, making her way to the door. "I'll be back by the end of tonight, darling. Remember I love you.""
  chep.firstdays.2.a: ""I love you too, honey.""

  chep.firstdays.3.t: "Trust In The Happy Warrior"
  chep.firstdays.3.desc: ""Mr. President, sir, I've got a plan for you to start this whole show off with."\n\nThe difference in energy between Chep and Hubert Humphrey was unmistakable, practically spellbinding to watch. Even at his older age, Humphrey was practically bouncing in his seat, drawing papers from folders and spreading them neatly on the table before the comparatively stark-still President. Chep had to wonder if there was a motor strapped to his back. Did he ever get tired?\n\n"Now, you know as well as I do that a lot of people in the Senate aren't so keen on you as they were on Phil, God bless him. They knew him, they worked with him, they respected him. Now, if you ask me, I think it comes from the perception that Phil was the man putting the ideas out there and you, well..." He tapped his fingers on the table. "You were the salesman."\n\n"That's not fair." Chep murmured, sipping his coffee. "I did as much work as anyone. Hell, more than most of the others. You think Gene McCarthy was wearing the pants in that cabinet?"\n\n"I worked with Gene long enough to know better." Humphrey smiled. "But that's the thing. The Senate can take a huckster-"\n\n"I'm not a huckster either."\n\n"I know, I know. But the Senate can take that if they think he's got a good man with his head on his shoulders besides him. A Phil Hart, if you will. Which is why..." He pulled yet another folder from his briefcase, slapping it onto the table and violently rattling the coffee mugs. "I suggest you take Senator Birch Bayh from Indiana as your number two. Good man, committed liberal, focused on women's rights-"\n\n"His wife has cancer, doesn't she?"\n\nHumphrey paused, finally. "She's been battling it for a few years, yes. He says he's willing regardless. Trust me, Mr. President, Birch Bayh is the real deal.""
  chep.firstdays.3.a: ""Hell, maybe I'll get some sympathy for it.""

  chep.hartfuneral.1.t: "The Protege's Eulogy"
  chep.hartfuneral.1.desc: "Jane Jacobs set her jaw as she stared out at the funeral. She hated how tense she was- that at the funeral of a man who had become a dear friend to her she wasn't allowed to cry. But she knew that, while all the men who would speak today would be permitted their imperfections, as the highest ranking female cabinet member in history she would not get that luxury. So she stood strong for the memory of her friend.\n\n"Philip Hart was not a great President, or a great man, because he was always right," Jacobs said. "He was not the leader that he was because he marched forwards under the belief that he had all the answers. He was a great leader because he knew that he was just as human as the rest of us- that he could not change America alone." She swallowed, and gave herself a small nod. "I was introduced to Phil when he contacted me after reading my book. I was expecting the same political nonsense I'd heard a thousand times- flattery, vague promises, the subtle request for an endorsement. But that's not what Phil Hart gave me. He didn't want anything from me. All he wanted was help understanding my ideas- and help understanding how he could apply them to serve the American people."\n\nShe allowed herself a snort. "If you want the truth, if you told me I'd be standing up here, giving a eulogy for a President whose cabinet I'd served in, ten years ago, I'd had laughed in your face. But that's just who Phil was. He was ready to learn from anyone, from the highest academics to the humblest of activists. And I learned from him. I have a lot to thank Phil for- his friendship, the example he set, the opportunity to serve this country. But most of all, I'm grateful that he let me believe again- believe in the promise of America.""
  chep.hartfuneral.1.a: "The American Dream restored."

  chep.hartfuneral.2.t: "The Stalwart's Eulogy"
  chep.hartfuneral.2.desc: "Walter Reuther was afraid. He was afraid, now that America had lost its President. He was afraid, now that a relatively unknown quantity had taken his place. He was afraid, now that the greatest advances for the poor in the history of America were at risk of slipping away. But America- the people he'd spent his life fighting for- didn't need his fear. So as he gave his eulogy for the greatest protector the American worker had ever known, he looked straight ahead.\n\n"In the primaries most of the country looked at this newcomer- this outsider from the Great Lakes suddenly trouncing all the party insiders- with confusion. But- I can tell you- not Michigan. We knew who Phil Hart was since he served as our Lieutenant Governor in the 50s. We knew he had integrity and honor, and that he would do everything in his power to fight for the common man. I know I speak for all Michiganlanders when I say it's been a privilege to watch the President show the nation the kind of man he is just as he's shown us. And while I mourn the President's death, I take heart in the knowledge that cancer can kill a man but it cannot kill his legacy. President Hart has entrusted the America he built, an America of equality, of brotherhood, of freedom, to all of us. It's our job to pick up the torch he left us."\n\nAs applause rang out in front of him Reuther fought off a scowl. Conservatives probably had enough decency to give the nation one day to mourn. But, he knew, the knives would come out tomorrow. Everything Hart had done would be dragged to the altar of fiscal responsibility. And for everything Reuther had said today, in his heart of hearts he didn't know if the efforts of the American working class would be able to save what they had won."
  chep.hartfuneral.2.a: "Always another fight."

  chep.hartfuneral.3.t: "The Colleague's Eulogy"
  chep.hartfuneral.3.desc: "Gene McCarthy bit his lip as he looked out at the audience. "You'll hear a lot of people today talk about the late President as a friend," he said. "I wish I could say the same, but I can't. I'd say Phil was a rival, but that would probably be giving myself too much credit." That got a small laugh, at least. "He brushed past me in the primaries. He left me in the dust. And when he offered me the Agriculture Secretary position, I assumed I was just a token to unite the party, that I wouldn't have much real power."\n\n"But I was wrong. Because that might have been how most politicians would have done it, but not Phil Hart. He always made sure that I was included in cabinet discussions, that my voice was heard, that my concerns were answered. Sure, we had our disagreements, and the cabinet wasn't always perfect. But whenever petty politics threatened to tear us apart, the President kept us moving forwards towards our goal: doing what's best for the American people. And for that, the President will always have my respect.""
  chep.hartfuneral.3.a: "Moving forwards."

  chep.hartfuneral.4.t: "The Rival's Eulogy"
  chep.hartfuneral.4.desc: ""Philip Hart was many things to me," Nelson Rockefeller said, looking out over the audience. "He was a husband, a son, a father, a brother. He was a public servant who spent decades working tirelessly for the people of the nation he loved. And- and this, I can say from personal experience- he ran quite the primary campaign." Rocky cracked one of his signature smiles at that; he hoped the laughter that followed, at least some of it- was genuine.\n\n"Look, it's no secret that President Hart and I didn't see eye to eye on any number of issues," Rockefeller said. "But through all our disagreements about the best methods with which to make this great country a better place for all its citizens, I never doubted that the two of us shared the same love for America and its spirit of freedom, equality, and justice for all. And the courage and vision with which the President pursued that dream has never been clearer to all of us than it is today, as we look around at the safer, wealthier, stronger, freer, and more equal America that he left behind.""
  chep.hartfuneral.4.a: "United in grief."

  chep.hartfuneral.5.t: "The Struggler's Eulogy"
  chep.hartfuneral.5.desc: "Bayard Rustin looked out over the audience. Nothing had made him as sure of what he was about to say than the number of black faces he saw out there in that crowd. Rustin doubted that the death of any white man had devastated his people so much since Lincoln. "When I was asked to give this eulogy," he began, his reedy voice carrying over the crowd, "a part of me didn't know what to say. I never had the good fortune of knowing President Hart personally, of considering him a friend. I wondered how my words could possibly measure up to the words you have heard today from those who knew him, worked alongside him, and shared their lives with him."\n\nHe was surprised to feel a burning behind his eyes. "But then I realized," he continued, "that I did know the President- a part of him at least. Every Black person in America knows the President. We know of his kindness, when we look around us at the cities we live in, so recently squalid ghettos but transformed in no small part thanks to his work into communities in which we find true joy. We know of his vision, from years of working with his administration to actually transform the lives of our people on our own terms, not those of some white bureaucrats. And we know of his courage, from his repeated stands against the forces of hatred both within this country and within the halls of power in the great Fascist empire. Black people, on this day, mourn the loss of the greatest President of the United States since Abraham Lincoln. Philip Hart may be dead. But his memory will live on in the heart of every Black child who will grow up in a country where, at long last, they can know true freedom. And as we continue the struggle to make that America a reality we will never forget the work of our advocate, our ally, and our friend.""
  chep.hartfuneral.5.a: "They have a dream."

  chep.hartfuneral.6.t: "The Guardian's Eulogy"
  chep.hartfuneral.6.desc: "Chep Morrison stared down at the paper, then up at the assembled audience. The eulogy was the kind of eulogy a President taking over from his dead predecessor was expected to give. Platitudes about duty, honor, and the goodness of America- of the need to come together. It was a eulogy for America. But after it all, Philip Hart was his friend. And he deserved better than this.\n\nChep looked up, not letting his eyes to drift down to the paper. For a few seconds he just stood there, finding the words. "Phil was the best of us," he finally said. "You know, when you spend so long in government you can forget that the people you were elected to serve are more than just numbers on a ledger- that each and every one of them is a person with hopes and fears and loves. I know I've been guilty of that. But not Phil. Everything that got put on his desk- urban renewal, healthcare, détente- didn't matter. He'd approach all with this... kindness. That's the only thing I can call it. Maybe he wasn't perfect and maybe he made mistakes. But everything he did... he never did it to score political points, or to get one over his enemies. He did it for America."\n\nFor a few seconds he floundered, trying to find the words for what he felt. "You know, I- I'm not like him. I know I'm not. I'm an old Dixiecrat and I peaked when Ike was President. And there were times when... when I made backroom deals, when I went low, when I played politics instead of serving the people. But I guess... I guess he thought I had a place in one of the greatest administrations this country's ever seen." Chep felt a lump in his throat; with herculean effort, he swallowed it. "That's what made Phil Hart the man he was- the President he was. He saw the best in everyone. He saw the best in America. He believed that whatever our weaknesses- whatever our prejudices- we all can be great. So today I invite all Americans- white and black, men and women, old and young, rich and poor- to honor the legacy of my President and my friend by proving him right.""
  chep.hartfuneral.6.a: "Let us continue."

  chep.bayh.1.t: "Your Kind of Guy"
  chep.bayh.1.desc: ""Mr. President!" Humphrey's cheer was infectious. "This is Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana."\n\n"It's an honor to be here, Mr. President." Chep shook the proffered hand, firm but not crushing.\n\n"I've heard good things about you, Senator. You seem like a very accomplished young man." They took a seat. "So, tell me, Senator, why should I make you Vice President?"\n\n"Well, Mr. President, I've been in the Senate for over a decade and in state government for eight years before that. I have been out there on Civil Rights and Women's Rights. I've helped get two Constitutional amendments ratified and I'm working on two others."\n\nBayh paused, thinking. "Now, Mr. President. I like my current job. If you need someone who's just there to sit pretty and smile, I'm not your guy. But I promise you that if you pick me, I'll work and fight as hard as anyone to get things done here in Washington and to make a real difference in the lives of the people in this country just like you and President Hart have done."\n\nChep nodded along. Bayh seemed nice enough, handsome too, which never hurt. He'd be a good pick, but he wanted a look at the alternatives. "Senator, you're a farmer by trade, correct?"\n\n"Yes sir, a farm boy from Vigo County, got my first degree in Agriculture."\n\n"Well, you've certainly given me a lot to think about. Thanks for coming, and I hope you and Senator Humphrey have a good trip back to the Hill."\n\nChep took lunch with Hale. The two were old veterans of the political fights down in the Crescent City, early stalwarts against what had then seemed like an unstoppable Long machine.\n\n"I've looked at the names you've sent me. Carey, Stevenson, Askew." Boggs shook his head. "Chep, you need a good rural liberal, someone outside of the urban machine politics business, preferably, a likable one." Boggs paused. "I've heard you've interviewed Birch?" Chep nodded."
  chep.bayh.1.a: ""He'd be a good pick Mr. President""

  chep.bayh.2.t: "His Last Name is Bayh"
  chep.bayh.2.desc: ""It is after a great deal of soul searching and consultation both within the Republican-Democratic Coalition and without. I have decided on my Vice Presidential nominee."\n\n"The man I have picked has served with distinction in the halls of State Government and the United States Senate for nearly twenty years. He has been an unwavering friend of minorities, the farmer, and the laborer. A trailblazer in the fight for Women's Rights and the author of more Constitutional Amendments, save for the founders themselves."\n\n"He is a man in whom I have absolute faith, who will ably assist this administration... this administration as it serves out the remainder of its term in office. It is with great pride and pleasure that I announce that I will send the name of Burtch Evans Bayh to the United States Congress for confirmation.""
  chep.bayh.2.a: ""His first name is Birch, sir.""

  chep.bayh.3.t: "A House Divided"
  chep.bayh.3.desc: ""You know, I have to say - thank God that's over with. How's the title fit you?" Chep said jovially as he grasped the handle of the Oval Office's door, to the chuckle of his new No. 2.\n\n"Like a glove, Mr. President. It's a wonderful honor." Bayh replied, standing besides him, confidence exuding from his frame.\n\n"Yeah, well, it's damn well thankless too. Some of those fellas on Capitol Hill-" The President started as he swung the door open. His words were interrupted by the pop of a bottle, and he jerked backwards as a cork hit him between the eyes. "Goddamn!"\n\n"Congratulations, darling!" Zsa Zsa crooned, champagne spilling onto the Resolute Desk. "You're a real President now, with the handsome running mate and all - come over here, have a drink, both of you!"\n\nThe President didn't reply, his mouth slightly ajar, his hand rubbing the sore spot on his head. She was sitting at his desk, in his chair, shooting him in the face in front of his colleague. Words failed him. Thankfully, that wasn't the same for Bayh, who he could feel pushing by him and into the room.\n\n"Mrs. President, I appreciate the sentiment, but we need to get to work here if you don't mind."  Bayh said, setting a stern gaze at the socialite. Her mouth began to move, but Bayh cut in again. "I'm flattered, I really am, but we've got a lot to do here. Save the champagne for later, please."\n\nZsa Zsa turned her head, her glare boring into the same spot where she had hit Chep. "I should've known you'd pick a square." the First Lady muttered, standing with a flourish and sweeping a folder off the table as she strutted away. Bayh turned to the still frozen Chep, a questioning look on his face.\n\n"I-I'm terribly - I'm sorry about that. We were talkin' about the, uh, the HEW...?""
  chep.bayh.3.a: "There are some things even a salesman isn't ready for."

  chep.bayh.4.t: "Going Sideways"
  chep.bayh.4.desc: ""Mr. President, ah, I've got to tell you something unfortunate." The voice of Hubert Humphrey cut clear as crystal through the telephone wire, emitting into Chep's ear as he sat impatiently in his seat. His fingers tapped against the table as he waited. "I've done as much as I can and I've gone around polling everyone here and, ah... if this holds like this, Bayh doesn't have the votes."\n\n"What?" He could practically feel his heart stopping in his chest. "The hell do you mean he doesn't have the votes? You told me this was a done deal!"\n\n"It would be if this was a regular time, but, ah, this isn't a regular time, and some Senators are taking the opportunity to stick it to us."\n\n"Goddamnit, you sold me on this poor bastard because he was gonna be simple to put through and now you're tellin' me I can't have a Vice President?" He realized just how tightly he was gripping the armrest of his chair when pain began shooting up his wrist. "What's next, huh? What the hell am I gonna do? How'm I gonna pass anything if I can't even get a Vice President?"\n\nOf all things, it was the dead air which rattled the phone in its stillness that caught the President square in the gut. He slumped in his seat, staring up at the blankness of the ceiling above him. Finally, Humphrey spoke. "I don't know, Mr. President. We'll just have to see where it goes."\n\n"Son of a bitch." Chep mumbled, slamming the phone into the receiver with a clang."

  chep.sabotage.1.desc: "Chep's fingers nervously drummed against the Resolute Desk, a phone coiled tightly in one hand. They were running out of time, too much to do, too little to do it with, and now- "Congressman Hale Boggs on line one."\n\nA click. "Mr. President, Hale speaking." The voice on the other end was familiar, the Gulf Coast drawl that had followed Chep from his days in the State House to his once hopeless campaign for Governor. He breathed something close to relief.\n\n"Damn, Hale, it's good to hear you. I can't spare the pleasantries at the moment, not with this damn bill moving through Congress, but I think we still got a chance to stop it." Chep fumbled for the papers on the desk, carefully balancing the phone.\n\n"Mr. President." Boggs's voice was tired but firm. "The votes aren't there. We can't stop this thing."\n\nChep shook his head. "Look, Boggs, I know things look bad right now, but we're not out of this yet. It'll be just like what we did back at Baton Rouge, I'll get Humphrey to lean on the Senate, but I need you to keep this thing held up in Committee before-"\n\n"Chep. I've spoken to Wright, McCloskey, Tip, and Dan, and they all say the same thing. The votes aren't there, not with polling looking the way it is. Whoever's telling you otherwise is wrong."\n\nChep let the paper fall through his fingers. "That's it? We've come all this way, Hale, just to watch everything fall apart?"\n\nThe line fell silent, but only for a moment. "Cut your losses while you still can, Mr. President. I've got a tough race to run, and I can't have Russell Long breathing down my neck while I'm at it. Your boy Landrieu is in a dogfight too. We can't win this one, Chep.""

  chep.coerce.1.desc: ""Good afternoon, Mr. Rockefeller, thank you for taking the time," Chep shifted uneasily in his seat, half-expecting Philip Hart to walk in and reclaim it at any moment, "I've had my ear to the ground about this whole URI reform issue in Congress and I was hoping for your view." Nelson Rockefeller gave the President a small, sad smile before responding.\n\n"Thank you, Che一. Mr. President. There's a real groundswell of support for this in Congress. Many think, rightly I believe, that the URI grew too big, too quickly, without regard for critics." Chep shook his head even as Rockefeller spoke.\n\n"The URI's been rolling on for six years now but with Hart gone the sharks are starting to circle. We need to hold the line on this as a coalition, Nelson and一."\n\n"Mr. President,"  Rockefeller interjected firmly, not cowed at all by Chep's new position behind the Resolute Desk, "I should state that I and several others in the coalition are firmly on board with these reform plans for the URI. The project needs some reworking and you won't have a seat at the table if you can't see that. Congress is willing to play ball, Mr. President, but you must be reasonable."\n\nChep's stomach sank as he recognized the firmness in Rockefeller's face. If the Responsible Republicans were now fully on board with the deficit hawks, then his position was worse than he imagined. A bead of sweat rolled down his back as he felt the political ground shifting beneath him. He suddenly had no idea what to do."

I've thrown every word, every argument and piece of invective against him but Rocky and the Republicans won't back off," Chep sighed and rubbed his temples, "They've made very clear that I can either get on board with them or get run over by the anti-URI wagon. Please tell me you've got better news for me."\n\nThe ashen look on Hubert Humphrey's face did nothing to assuage Chep's anxieties. The Minnesotan paused, choosing his words carefully.\n\n"I've been speaking to the coalition's senators, trying to see whether there are any votes but I've been coming up dry, Mr. President. Most conversations don't last longer than the necessary formalities, and my calls aren't being answered. Conservative organizations have been mobilizing and the only thing on most people's mind is spending and debt from the URI."\n\nStaring out across the White House lawn, feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders, Chep felt himself drifting away from this moment. He could not change the Senate's mind or do anything to fight off the impending disaster. He felt, as Zsa Zsa had said more than once, utterly hopeless.\n\n"Is there anything left that we can possibly do, Humphrey? You're as firm a friend of the URI and Hart Administration as anyone in the Senate." A pained look crossed Humphrey's face as he shook his head.\n\n"I'm at a dead-end, Mr. President. The best advice I can give at this point is either try to ride out this storm and hope the Senate doesn't unite on a 'reform' package, or take Rockefeller's offer and negotiate, softening the damage." The look on Humphrey's face communicated his full distaste for either option."

  chep.coerce.3.desc: ""I'm telling you, Bayh, I just don't know what the hell to do. I feel like every turn I take a wall gets thrown up in front of me and another failure gets added to my tally." President Chep Morrison's head was in his hands, a pounding headache and stress combining to make his day even worse. A sympathetic Birch Bayh felt slightly hopeless as the most powerful man in the United States, supposedly, appeared on the edge of collapse.\n\n"I understand your worries," He began awkwardly, trying to buck Chep's spirits up, "There are times where, however hard you fight or how just your cause is, you get knocked off your feet and you take a licking. Here, I can't say I like it, or that it's my first, second, or third choice, but a compromise seems like the way to go here."\n\nChep imagined briefly how it would feel to let go of URI and finally have the Senate, if not back on his side, no longer trying to ruin him. For a moment it all seemed so sweet, then darkened. He remembered not only that the URI was Hart's legacy, but the work Chep himself had done on its behalf. It was his project too and he seethed internally when he imagined it all being shredded by a penny-pinching Congress.\n\n"You really think that's the best move?" He asked, studying Bayh's face.\n\n"Sir, we're at an impasse here. If I were the problem, I would be more than happy to remove my name from consideration for Vice President but the URI is the stumbling block here. We have to push through, and when all is said and done, you, Jacobs and I can work together to put all the pieces of what's left into something better and stronger. But we have to get past this roadblock...""

The Minnesotan Senator answered on the third ring and Chep got right to work.\n\n"Humphrey, I've made my decision. You let Rockefeller know that the administration is willing to compromise and work with him on his reform plans. I think if we get ahead of him and play our cards well, we'll walk away from the table with at least a few chips to show for it." He heard a sigh of relief on the other end of the line.\n\n"That's excellent news, Mr. President, and many people within the Coalition will be happy to hear that you're coming to the table. I think this is the best way to minimize the chance that the whole program gets wiped out."\n\n"Even if the URI gets broken into a thousand pieces," Chep said, feeling confident for the first time in a while, "Jacobs, Bayh and I will spend the rest of my tenure putting the fragments back together." Humphrey chuckled warmly, happy to see some of Chep's spirit return.\n\n"I like the attitude, Mr. President. If that's your plan, I'd suggest talking to a few ad-men as there's still some ill-will..."\n\n"If ill will is all there is to worry about, I think we're in a much better position," Chep said jovially, chuckling, "But I appreciate the advice, Humphrey, you have a good day now." Hanging up the phone and leaning back in his chair, Chep felt his headache finally begin to alleviate. Things were back under control at last."

  chep.coerce.5.desc: "Chep Morrison read each word of his letter carefully. Writing to Paul Laxalt, a conservative Nevadan representative who was at the forefront of the URI repeal, he needed a careful touch to strike all the right notes.\n\n"Dear Representative Laxalt,\n\nI have been paying close attention to the conversations held in Congress recently regarding the Urban Renewal Initiative. Your voice has been one of the most influential and certainly stands out among the chorus of critics so I thought it best to direct my message to you. I am aware of the flaws within the program and welcome the proposed reforms to fill in the cracks and restore proper fiscal discipline.\n\n"I think it best for the country that we work together on this issue and develop a proper reform bill to be sent to my desk as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there is currently quite a log-jam in Congress getting my new Vice President properly appointed. All I ask of you is that we get Representative Bayh confirmed and that I can participate in an informal manner. There's no reason that we should be handling this matter on divisive roll-call votes when we all agree some fixing needs doing."\n\nChep bit his lip and combed a hand through his thinning hair again. Would the prickly Nevadan, a conservative to his core, be willing to accept a reworking of the URI rather than a full repeal of the program? He had a sense for people, but ever since Philip Hart had passed he had felt caught in a maelstrom, tossed about by fate and the growing rightwing reaction to the URI. Shaking his head, he began re-reading the letter, believing that if he could phrase his appeal correctly someone might finally listen to him."

New papers kept appearing on his desk, all of which seemed to him impossible to manage, impossible to stop. Every paper carried with it some threat from conservatives to destroy the Urban Renewal Initiative.\n\n"Chep, darling, are you alright?" The President, sweating in his oversized suit, looked up. In the door of the Oval Office was his wife, Zsa Zsa. Beneath a mess of blonde hair was concern.\n\n"Oh, yes, Zsa Zsa, I'm..." With a shaky hand, the President set down the stack of papers and shook his head. "They're just going after everything. They're going after Phil and the URI and—."\n\n"Oh, Chep. Oh my poor, sweet deLesseps..." The First Lady strode across the Oval Office and pressed her hand against his face. Even after all their fights, even after all their shared misery, it seemed that some part of her still felt protective of him. She pressed his face into her chest. "Look at what these awful, awful ruffians in Congress are doing to you. My poor dear."\n\nThere was something strangely comforting about the embrace. Chep reached up to touch his wife. "It can't be helped. I'll have to work with them. Reform the URI, I mean. Jane will kill me, but if cutting it is the only way to save it..."\n\n"Yes, you must make tough choices, darling." Zsa Zsa gave him a tight squeeze. "I'll give you some time alone to compose yourself. Never forget that it's you, not this Jane, who is President."\n\nChep nodded his thanks as Zsa Zsa left the room. She was right, he told himself, he was the President. It was up to him to make tough calls to save the URI."

For weeks, she had read article after article about the President doing nothing while his vice presidential nominee Birch Bayh languished in Congress. For weeks, she had sat twiddling her thumbs waiting for the President to schedule a cabinet meeting.\n\nNow, many weeks too late, Jane had decided to take matters into her own hands. Dressed in a smart black dress, she strode through the West Wing unannounced, her heels clicking against the tile. Standing with a folder in the lobby, the President did a double take as he saw the small woman make a beeline for him.\n\n"Long time no see, Mr. President," said Jane Jacobs with all the politeness she could muster. "Any new developments happening in the White House or should I expect to be briefed by the Washington Post once again?"\n\nThe President opened and shut his mouth several times. "Jane, I..." He gulped. A deer stuck in headlights. "I was just..." He looked down at the folder in his hands. "It's Congress. They're gunning for the URI and blocking everything they can."\n\n"Once again, Mr. President, I do find time to read the newspaper every now and then. What I'm more concerned about is what you're doing to stop this."\n\n"I'm still trying to figure that out," he said. He placed the folder behind his back like a child trying to hide a bad report card. It looked to Jane like some proposal. "Just... give me some time."\n\nJane Jacobs scowled. She did not suffer fools. "We're on thin ice, Chep. One false move and that's it for the URI.""

It was a place with class, a place with culture. With so many diplomats squeezed into one place, all looking for a way to ingratiate themselves to their American hosts, the neighborhood was overflowing with parties and celebrations.\n\n"My goodness, Mrs. Morrison, aren't you just divine this evening?" Said a voice. Zsa Zsa turned to see Diana McLellan, Washington gossip columnist standing with a champagne flute and a notepad.\n\nZsa Zsa frowned. "I think you meant 'First Lady Gabor,' darling."\n\n"Oh, of course! I'm so sorry. It's just, with all the decor, Moulin Rouge is on the mind." The woman gave a chuckle but Zsa Zsa was certain the faux pas had not been a mistake. "It's incredible that you still find time to attend these parties with all of your very important duties at the White House."\n\n"Yes, I am quite busy," said Zsa Zsa with a tight smile. She could tell when someone was playing with her, when someone was fishing for the tabloids. "Doing all kinds of renovations at the White House, redecorating and helping bring all kinds of beautiful things to Washington. And, of course, parties like these help me relax after a long day helping my darling deLesseps." Zsa Zsa needed something to show the woman who was boss. "Why, just the other day, I was helping my wonderful husband deal with those nasty brutes in Congress. He came to me and just begged for my help to reform the URI or whatever you call it."\n\n"Chep Morrison is asking Zsa Zsa Gabor for help to reform the URI?" said Diana, her eyes gleaming as she scrawled a note. In the pit of her stomach, Zsa Zsa felt a knot. She wasn't sure what she'd done, but something she'd said would make headlines."

The two of them had been talking through cuts, looking for a way to save the URI by finding parts to offer to the conservatives. By the time he returned to the Oval Office to find a note on his desk, it was already past noon.\n\n"What in the world is..." said Chep, as he picked up paper. He scanned the note. There was a "Dear Mr. President," a line about it having been a pleasure to serve, a signature from Jane Jacobs. Chep's eyes went wide as he realized what he was reading. "Someone—. Someone get the hell in here."\n\nThe next hour was a frantic flurry of activity. None of his aides could remember seeing Jacobs come in. None of the calls to her office went through. Chep found himself on the telephone, begging and pleading with Janey Hart until the widow, begrudgingly, surrendered the former secretary's personal DC number. Minutes later, Chep Morrison was sitting at his desk, praying to himself as the phone rang. "Hello, this is Jane—."\n\n"Oh, thank God, Jane. It's Chep. It's the President. I just got into the office. I just got your note. I don't—. I'm not sure what I did, but I'm sure it's a mistake. What did you—? Why did you...?"\n\nThere was a long pause on the other end of the line. "Chep, I don't suppose you've read the Post this morning?" The voice was dripping with malice. "'First Lady Reveals Plan to Reform URI.' How exactly will Zsa Zsa be reforming the URI? Using school lunches to pay for diamonds? Selling roads for taffeta dresses?"\n\nThe President sat in shocked silence.\n\n"I warned Philip that it was a mistake to keep you on board.

The New York Times had an exclusive interview with Jane Jacobs, in which she called him "an incompetent troglodyte" and shared embarrassing details on the Hart Administration. In the Detroit Free Press, anonymous cabinet officials were bad-mouthing his fumbling relationship with them. In the Los Angeles Times, there was an excoriating editorial on how Chep and his wife were "backcountry hicks" who had "demeaned the office of the President." There was even a political cartoon of him and Zsa Zsa as The Beverly Hillbillies, driving a car labeled "Washington" off a cliff.\n\nAll of it made him want to melt into a puddle under his desk. It was stupid, childish even, but he couldn't understand why they were being so cruel to him. He'd done so much already for Philip—God rest his soul. It seemed that everyone in the world wanted to destroy him.\n\nHe put his head in his hands. This wasn't just about Hart's legacy any more. With Jacobs gone, with his caucus in chaos, he couldn't save the URI any more. All he could do now was survive with whatever trinkets he could carry. If there was going to be any hope of his retrieving some fragments of his and Hart's hard work from the rubble, there would need to be people to take the fall.\n\nSighing, he removed his hands from his face and rummaged through his desk for stationary.

It seemed inevitable to Kissinger that the President would eventually take him behind the barn too, that he'd force the resignation of his wildly popular secretary to show he wasn't afraid of the media and was carving his own path.\n\n"No," said Kissinger across from Chep. "I don't think I will."\n\nHe looked babyish behind the big desk. The President blinked as he tried to digest what he'd heard. "I'm sorry? You aren't...?"\n\n"I will not resign from the Office of the Secretary of State. If you want me gone, Chep, you will have to fire me."\n\nThat a secretary might refuse a direct order was clearly not a possibility Chep Morrison had considered. Kissinger said nothing as the man made a pathetic noise. "But you aren't—? Why?"\n\n"To be blunt, I don't respect you. I don't think anyone you would appoint would be better positioned to preserve our nation's security..." Kissinger did not mention the other reason, that him being martyred by an unpopular President would only bolster his reputation. Instead, he made a patriotic display for any tapes that might be recording. "I won't let you destroy Philip Hart's legacy."\n\nMoments later, Henry Kissinger found himself in Foggy Bottom, stacking his personal effects into a box.

Congress was eating away at the URI while Jane Jacobs and Henry Kissinger picked away at him in the press. Every day there were angry headlines about his failures, his incompetence, about his inability to lead. There were angry calls and cruel parodies of him on every television station. He couldn't think straight.\n\n"I didn't come into this marriage to be treated like this," Zsa Zsa said. She was pointing her finger. Her eyes were full of hurt.

The private residence was too empty, the staff offices were too hostile, if he went for a walk, he'd certainly be shot, and nobody in the world would accept a call from him. For these reasons, on sleepless nights like these, President Morrison lay flat on a couch and watched the night sky. It was perfect, all things considered.\n\nStill, the whole world was not against him. A knock at the office door startled Morrison upright, who suspected that another ambush was afoot. Instead, a small cadre of wellwishers from among his staff appeared bearing gifts. "We're all worried about you, Mr. President," voiced a female staffer, whose face embodied this worry.\n\nThe President forced a smile and waved them off, but they insisted; he didn't look good and needed to eat. "I'm fine, girls; now just go." Bitterness rippled in his voice, but still, they insisted he leave the office. "We just want to help, Mr. President," they said, but the President finally snapped.\n\nChep took the basket from the staffer's hand and dropped it onto the floor, shouting, "What can you do to help me!? Are you going to put my marriage back together? Save my cabinet, finally make me President? Where? How?" Silence hung over the group as the President turned on his heel and walked towards the southward window. He came to his knees and leaned against the windows, staring again at the swaying trees. One of the staffers kneeled to reorganize their gift basket, placed its contents on the table, and nudged the others to leave.\n\nOnce they had left, Chep pilfered the basket for its contents and found, packed at the bottom, a flask of whisky. Philip Hart would never have drunk in the Oval Office, but Chep Morrison didn't care; he was barely a President, unlike responsible Hart. There was a man history would remember, thought Morrison, with a tinge of regret. Then, unscrewing the flask, he raised the whisky and offered a toast.\n\n"To you, Phil.""

There had been bad blood between them in the past but it was important, given the circumstances, to try to turn over a new leaf in their relationship. Frankly, Chep Morrison needed every ally he could get. They shook hands and awkwardness, tinged with animosity, hung between them.\n\n"I wanted to say that I regret the bad feelings between us during Philip's time in this office," Chep began, attempting to dispel the cloud between them, "I know I certainly rubbed you the wrong way at times, and I'm sorry for that, but with everything going on I don't think our feud is worth continuing. Truce?"\n\nJacobs blinked, slightly taken aback by Chep's opening. Some small, uncharitable part of her had never believed Chep was capable of a gesture like this but she didn't mind being surprised. She nodded, her mind moving from the bad blood between them to the issue at hand.\n\n"I appreciate that, Mr. President. With that being said, I believe the most important thing now is making sure the URI survives past this administration." A sad look crossed Chep's face, quickly replaced by a mask of professionalism.\n\n"I don't want the URI dying on me. That won't be the legacy of this administration, not as long as I can do anything about it." Jacobs felt a brief flash of pride, perhaps admiration, for Chep as he took on the whole threat of the failure of the project.

The URI's popularity is down by double digits in some of the most liberal parts of the country and senators don't to go down with it." Left unspoken between them, as both were well aware, was how every conservative in the country had taken the opportunity of Hart's death to launch every imaginable attack on the URI.\n\n"Do you think Morrison will be able to work through it? The Presidency is one heck of a bully-pulpit." Even as she asked, Jacobs knew the answer. Chep had been chosen for the Vice Presidency, Hart's handpicked successor, but whether he measured up to the requirements of the Oval Office remained an elephant in the room-sized question mark.\n\n"I can't be sure," Bayh replied, rubbing his chin and trying to be optimistic, "He's a man on a mission, trying his best to help the country. I like to think someone like that always has a shot but there are many more cynical than me. He can't rule by decree, but Congress won't listen to him, so he's in this limbo."\n\nBayh continued but Jacobs drifted away briefly, slightly haunted by the memory of the passion, investment glinting in the eyes of Morrison as he described his plans to fight for the URI. It hadn't been his idea, but he was now one of its staunchest defenders and seemed to have his whole heart in the fight. If the URI died, its blood would not be on Morrison's hands.

The discussion got off track." Jacobs let the lies pass.\n\n"I've helped people through things like this. It's never easy talking about it, but I'm here to listen. It's a lot to bear alone.""

  chep.jacobs.4.t: "A Socratic Approach"
  chep.jacobs.4.desc: "As Chep talked, Jacobs finally saw what she had been missing for years. She recalled how during the Hart Administration whenever she had confronted him he had backed down each time. At the time, she had chalked it up to the strength of her arguments and force of will, perhaps his cowardice. Now she worried that each time she had stood up to him her victory had come through unknowing exploitation of his dysfunctional relationship.\n\nHart had mentioned it to her, though she had only gotten a full view of the problem now. She had been proud to know the warning signs of such things, but in her ill-will to Chep had turned a blind eye to his situation. Now, however, she knew she had to help him.\n\n"What do you want out of your marriage, Chep?" She asked. The President halted mid-sentence, the question requiring a few minutes of careful thought. He was still getting used to her new attitude towards him.\n\n"I remember with my first wife, Corinne, before she passed," He said with wistful, sad smile, "She wouldn't yell. I didn't feel like I was on thin-ice every moment of my life. I guess it was a normal marriage rather than something truly special. Zsa Zsa and me, we've had some good times, but the lows were..." He trailed off. Jacobs nodded. He needed to process the problem rather than have Jacobs shepherd him through it.\n\n"Do you think you can have a normal marriage with Zsa Zsa?" Chep's eyes dropped. The implicit, underlying follow-up question hung in the air between them as he pondered. Any animosity had disappeared hours ago, replaced by awkward amity. Then the words both knew were coming crept from the President's lips."
  chep.jacobs.4.a: ""No.""

  chep.jacobs.5.t: "The Mask"
  chep.jacobs.5.desc: "Chep Morrison and Jane Jacobs were still discussing his marriage. Even after hours of discussion, Jacobs was careful not to push the President. With a single misstep she might cause him to close up again, ruining any chance of improving his marriage. Still however, she worried that he still was not being fully honest with her.\n\n"I agree, Ms. Jacobs, that Zsa Zsa may not be perfect, and could be kinder in tone, but she's not pushing me around." Chep was still unwilling to admit that he never stood up to Zsa Zsa, taking her tirades in silence, even fear. Something in the man refused to admit that the situation was exactly as it appeared.\n\n"Chep, do you think I don't see how things are?" She asked, "I see how she yells and you don't respond. How she makes decisions and you accept them without a question. She'll leave on a vacation at the drop of the hat and never even pretend to invite you. It's okay to admit that the way she treats you is domineering." She halted, seeing Chep's face freeze. She knew she had crossed a line he was not ready for.\n\n"I love my wife, Ms. Jacobs, but I am the President of the United States. She does not boss me around and I am my own man. I know this marriage can work, it's just a matter of effort, and divorce is out of the question." Jacobs didn't like it, but knew when not to push.\n\n"Very well, Mr. Morrison, but leave some room for yourself too in this marriage. Work is all well and good, but both of you have to be willing to put it in." Chep nodded but Jacobs knew he was not listening like he had been before. She got up to leave, and Chep thanked her but something between them seemed to have dissipated."
  chep.jacobs.5.a: "Sometimes, all you can do is try."

  chep.jacobs.6.t: "Resolution"
  chep.jacobs.6.desc: ""Good afternoon, Secretary Jacobs." Chep's greeting had a friendly ring to it, quite different from their tense at best relationship during the Hart Administration.\n\n"Good afternoon, President Morrison. Nice to see you, sir." Indeed, any hint of tension between the President and the HEW Secretary had vanished, replaced by a collegial air common among friendly coworkers. It had been some time since they had last discussed his marriage and, to Jacob's experienced eye, "Morrison did not seem to wish to take it any further.\n\n"I appreciate your help, Secretary Jacobs," The President said, leaving the topic of his thanks deliberately vague. He knew that he owed her not only for her assistance with the URI but also her personal advice, however hard it had been to accept her points. Now, however, it was time to focus on the work.\n\n"The opportunity to help save the URI and so many people's hard work is more than enough thanks, Mr. President," She replied. Seeing the shadows of guilt in his eyes, she pressed on, "And I've seen how hard you've worked on the program's behalf. I, and America, know you tried your best. Going forward, it'll be my turn to try to keep the URI together."\n\n"I hope you have better luck than I did. Not a tough act to follow though, and I'll be rooting for you." Chep replied, his trademark smile making a brief, grim reappearance. Jacobs returned his smile and excused herself. She had work to do."

"It is my opinion that our best course would be to continue with our initiatives from the previous administration. We must continue striving for détente with Japan, and to fight German influence wherever we can. If you have any... special perspective on our foreign policy I would certainly like to hear it."\n\nChep Morrison glanced up, meeting Kissinger's eyes for the first time. "I, ah- no, Dr. Kissinger. That all sounds about right. I'll leave foreign affairs in your- ah, in your capable hands." Kissinger gave a clipped nod, rising to leave. "I, ah, wait," Chep said. "I actually had one more thing I wanted to ask you about." Kissinger turned dutifully. "Yes?"\n\n"I'm sure you've heard all this hullabaloo about the URI bill," Chep said. "Congress is trying to cut away at President Hart's legacy. And the press- they're hounding us! Taking any chance they can to make us look weak. If you could just... do something to get the press off us, that would be a big help."\n\nKissinger adjusted his glasses. "Much as I wish I could, Mr. President, I'm afraid I'm quite busy with the Cold War," he said. "Besides, media relations is surely not my area of expertise. I of course wish you luck in your domestic agenda." Without waiting for dismissal, he bowed his head and left."

  chep.kissinger.2.desc: "Kissinger strode into the Oval Office, trying not to look too far down his nose at the President. He hadn't exactly liked Hart by the end- his idealism clouded his judgment- but he had been, in his own way, deserving of Kissinger's respect. Morrison, though... the man was a timid simpleton. And Kissinger could handle timid simpletons just fine, except for when they tried to drag him down with them.\n\nAs, apparently, his alleged boss was still trying to do. Morrison leaned forwards, failing to hide his nervousness. "I am sorry to bother you again, Dr. Kissinger. But the situation with the URI really is getting desperate, and-"\n\n"As I said," Kissinger replied, "the URI is out of my purview. I do wish you luck, but-" Morrison slammed a fist down on his desk. It didn't exactly make Kissinger jump, but his objection died in his throat. "What do you think Phyllis Schlafly would think of your purview?" Morrison asked? "Or Scoop Jackson? If the URI fails, this administration goes down. I'm not asking you to intervene directly. But... play to the press, grapple for their attention. We need more headline grabbers like the business with Japan."\n\nKissinger found himself nodding. It approached being a fair point. And after all, American diplomacy would benefit from a certain level of renewed visibility. "Very well. We can certainly step up efforts to hem in the Reich's European sphere.""
  chep.kissinger.2.a: "A classic case of misdirection."

  chep.kissinger.3.t: "Super K to the Rescue"
  chep.kissinger.3.desc: "Kissinger climbed up the steps to the jet, turning at the top to wave for the cameras. As the lights of the flashes shown in his eyes, a reporter in the audience raised his hand. "Dr. Kissinger, what can you tell us about the purpose of this new diplomatic initiative?"\n\n"Sweden's importance geopolitically has skyrocketed in recent years due to the reunification of Russia," Kissinger said. "It is now situated right next to a renewed conflagration in Eastern Europe. It is vital that we align Sweden to American interests if we are to take advantage of this chance to strike a blow against the enemy of freedom worldwide. I look forwards to discussing with the Prime Minister of Sweden the opportunities for further cooperation."\n\nPresident Morrison pumped a fist as he watched Kissigner turn and enter the plane on tv. That ought to play well. Sweden had long been part of the German sphere; the fact that they were hosting the American Secretary of State- and a Jew, to boot- was sure to be a coup. And- most important of all- it would keep the eyes of the media off of that damn URI bill. Chep felt like pouring himself a drink; things were looking up."

  chep.kissinger.4.t: "Questions of Unity"
  chep.kissinger.4.desc: ""...so I can say that we will be investing further in the northeast high-speed rail project," President Morrison said. He looked back out over the crowd of reporters. "I'll have the next question."\n\n"Mr. President," a reporter whose name escaped Chep asked, "do you have any response to Congressman Laxalt's new Efficiency in Government Act? His criticism of the Administration's URI has certainly been harsh."\n\nChep flashed a smile. "I'm very glad you asked," he said. "Look, I respect Congressman Laxalt. He's a good man who loves his country, and I'm sure that we both want a better America, even if we disagree about the best way to achieve that. But I have to question what he and the budget hawks like him hope to achieve. The URI is a program that has improved the lives of millions of Americans, and we're going to defend it. But to be honest, I wish we'd move past this issue. It's no secret that we live in dangerous times. There's war in the Middle East, tensions in Eastern Europe, and continued instability in Africa. In times like this America needs to be united, marching forwards together. I invite Congressman Laxalt and his compatriots to turn away from divisive politics and stand together for a more peaceful world. Doctor Kissinger, for instance, has just visited the new government in Russia to congratulate them on reunification; I'm excited to talk more about what we've achieved with our new partner in the coming days."\n\nAs the questions kept coming, Chep felt himself relax. He'd actually... he'd actually done a good job on that one, hadn't he? He could see the reporters nodding. As he answered question after question, he came to a startling conclusion."
  chep.kissinger.4.a: "This might actually work."

  chep.mccarthy.1.t: "He Has the Courage"
  chep.mccarthy.1.desc: "Eugene McCarthy was an odd fellow, a little awkward and uninviting at the best of times. In a moment of crisis, Chep expected the man to wilt. Yet in this moment, he had, oddly, stepped up to the plate—as much as he could, anyway. As the Secretary of Agriculture attempted to respond to the mass of new complaints about Chep's administration, McCarthy's office had turned into a mess of scattered papers, with McCarthy practically squeezed inside.\n\nIt was this disheveled heap that Chep walked into. In the chaos of these last few months, the man felt right at home.\n\nMcCarthy, his eyes sunken, loosely waved the President into his chair. "Good to see you, Mr. President. These months... they feel like a test. I think I'm winning, but it feels like the load is killing me."\n\nChep, himself worse for wear, nodded. "I know, Eugene. I'm sorry to be putting something else on your plate." Chep placed a manilla folder into the stack on McCarthy's desk. "The farmers—it's not just that they hate us, their hate fuels the anti-URI movement. We need to improve our relationship with them; as it stands, that thread's on the brink of snapping every day. If there's anything—and I do mean anything—that you can do to fix this, you've got to pull the trigger!"\n\n"Don't get me wrong, I support the URI. It's good work, I've always said that. But I'm supposed to be an apolitical body. I can't just be cleaning up the President's messes. Still, I'll do everything I can to clean up your image with the farmers.""

  chep.mccarthy.2.t: "Let's Begin Anew"
  chep.mccarthy.2.desc: ""Secretary McCarthy, what have you got for me?"\n\nIt was clear to Chep that McCarthy had been hard at work. Per usual, he seemed tired and energized all at once, powered by whatever caffeine and personal determination was keeping him from falling asleep. Wired or prepared, Chep was prepared to accept whatever McCarthy he was getting. He needed good news from the Secretary of Agriculture, in whatever form it might come.\n\nMcCarthy leaned forward and pulled out his briefcase, fiddling with it as he spoke. "You remember our conversation, a few weeks ago? Well, I had an idea about it. Called up an advertising agency, and got these printed."\n\nMcCarthy's briefcase opened, and he pulled something out of it, slapping it on Chep's desk. Pamphlets. Colorful pamphlets, with graphs and plans, explaining URI benefits to rural communities.\n\nChep picked up one design and rifled through it, admiring all the graphics and arguments. "It's nice, McCarthy - punchy, clean, modern. This is good work." Chep got up, and began to move around the office. "Now, the unpleasant part. I need you to know on the onset that this is your department's work. You'll have to sort out the distribution on these."\n\nMcCarthy grimaced. "I understand. I have a lot on my plate, what with the rural pushback, but I can get this through."\n\nHe smiled faintly, which made him look even smaller."
  chep.mccarthy.2.a: ""I'm just happy to help.""

  chep.mccarthy.3.t: "An America of Confidence"

Every damn question needed an answer, every damn person needed to feel coddled and validated until they agreed to not sign off on a bill. It was a never ending cycle, and Chep was burning out.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a voice from the other end of the hallway. An unassuming man was running towards him. McCarthy, he noticed. Seemed he'd had a meeting here as well.\n\n"Mr. President, good to see you!" The secretary shouted, his voice just a little out of breath. As he got closer, he slowed to a walk, and his voice quieted. "I have some good news for you, if you'd like it."\n\n"Are you kidding?" Chep said, frustrated. "I'll take any good signs I can get. McCarthy, spit it out!"\n\nMcCarthy quickly began speaking. "Well, recruitment in the Department of Agriculture has risen. We're getting a lot of recruits from rural areas—the same regions where the URI backlash began. Given the Department's current recruitment drive, we can assume they have read the pamphlets."\n\n"And they must like what they're hearing. Good job, Gene!" Chep patted McCarthy on the back, nearly knocking him over. "Getting the farmers on our side - that's one step closer to shutting down this whole backlash. Glad I ran into you."\n\nWith a smile on his face, Chep turned towards the double doors. As he left, he looked back at McCarthy, as he ruffled through his notes and walked into his next meeting."

Something changed there?"\n\n"Well, yes. There's been a development. You see a few of those pamphlets contained some notes of... political persuasion. Environmentalism, clean government... common sense ideas, in my view. Somehow, they've started circling with the urban youth. I keep getting letters from them. They're saying they're willing to fight for the URI, start some protests, go door-to-door. It's really remarkable."\n\n"Are you talking about hippies here?"\n\n"Don't call them hippies, Chep, they're your supporters. But they fit the criteria."\n\n"And you found them?"\n\n"I suppose so, yes."\n\n"Well I'll be damned. I guess if you can get them running defense, it couldn't hurt.""

If he couldn't get this support for the URI, he knew he may as well give up now, and Chep was not the kind of man to give up easily.\n\n"Reuther speaking?" The voice on the other end responded quizzically.\n\n"Afternoon, Reuther, it's Morrison, and I was wondering if you'd heard of the Urban Renewal Initiative I've been leading in the senate; I'm well aware it's in both our interests, and that your support would do more than enough to sway things our way, so the question stands: can I count on you for this?" The line stayed silent for a moment as Reuther considered the proposition.\n\n"I think we both know I ought to say yes, but my schedule's not exactly clean. The press is working to ruin me like there's no tomorrow, and that aside, what are you asking of me, exactly?" Chep felt a slight grin hug his face and leaned back in his chair.\n\n"Nothing much, Reuther, just a hand in mobilizing support for the URI- I know I'm not Hart, but we've still got an obligation to work together on these things, especially when they're as important as this."\n\nToo true, Chep thought. So far as he'd seen, the two were practically symbiotic in their work routine, and not in such a way that Morrison could easily fill that gap. A sigh emanated from the phone.\n\n"Alright, Chep, where do you need me?"\n\n"I just need you to come to Washington, we can hash things out there.

Morrison asked, with a slight edge to his voice. Reuther gave him a puzzled if understanding look.\n\n"Chep, that'd be the second time you've asked. I haven't exactly warmed up to flying in 15 minutes- you seem a bit off, are you feeling alright?" Morrison let out a sigh and slid down his chair, losing his composed, harrowed look.\n\n"No, Reuther, I'm really not. I'm sorry to drop this on you but I've been through more theatricals than governing lately, and I'm only getting more sick of both, and even being around that damned Boeing..." Reuther nodded empathetically, with more than a touch of enthusiasm.\n\n"I know all too well- if you don't mind me telling the truth, my flight was downright dreadful. Nothing particularly bad about it, I've just always had a fear of flying, you know. Bad feelings from those." Reuther said, watching as Morrison began to nod, still staring straight forward, though seeming more lively now.\n\n"You and me both, Reuther, that's what I like best about you- you always seem to be real spooked of the same stuff I am." Chep smiled, glancing over to Reuther.\n\n"Sure, Chep, but that's the difference between you and me both- you know how to hide what you get spooked of. I just get out there and deal with it.""

Morrison asked, arm laying on the headrest of his couch.\n\n"Of course, Chep, I wouldn't doubt them for a second- if anyone can back us on this, it's the union arm, but my one concern is the Civil Rights folks, I'd really rather not have to wrangle them if I can manage it." Reuther stated plainly.\n\n"Right, I understand, but their support's liable to prove vital, especially in a race as close as this- what resources would you have with them, by the way?" Reuther leaned back and gave thought to Morrison's idea for a moment.\n\n"Well, we do have connections with their leaders, just not much sway- we've coordinated some marches in the past, but it's been fairly superficial for awhile. Anyways, I can ask them and see if I can pull out some carrots for them, but it'll be a struggle."\n\nMorrison nodded, processing the information.\n\n"And how about those union boys? How far can they go with this?" Chep asked, a new wave of concern sitting with him.

Scenes like this are unfolding across the nation, and it can heard from almost any union leader today; the URI stays, or the workers leave. This local union leader..."

I hope this wasn't too costly, was it?" Morrison asked, still wondering how so many could be mobilized in such short time- if only he could mobilize these numbers come next primaries.\n\n"No, Chep, but don't expect this kind of treatment again anytime soon. At this rate we'll be on every paper in America, and I suppose that's the best it can get for this movement- it'll only get less coverage from here, you know." Reuther warned. Morrison let out a sigh.\n\n"I know, Reuther, but if nothing else sways the balance, this will. Thank you for that."\n\n"Of course, Mr. President.

"Who's drafting the formal legislation? I'd like to be able to pick the areas I'll need to focus on.\n\n"I'll leave that to the two of you." Chep nodded at both Jacobs and Bayh, before continuing.

"If that damned bill of theirs is what they call 'reform,' you may as well call me Huey Long."\n\n"It doesn't matter if it's accurate, Chep." Boggs replied.

He'd never had a head for numbers but the results were obvious: Conservatives were coalescing against the URI in the name of "reform" while liberal voters remained divided and disinterested. Focus groups showed rural voters up in arms about "federal waste" while urban voters were apathetic at best.\n\nHe buried his head in his hands. There was a knock at the door.

Rather, my concern - and my impetus - lies with the gap he has left behind. My fellow cabinet members and I have spent the last few months in a state of perpetual crisis. Without Hart's oratory skills and congressional authority, we have been left to rely on Chep Morrison, who lacks the ability or personal strength to properly navigate this political system.\n\nWithout his defence, Congress has come to pick apart the Urban Renewal Initiative. Conservative and rural legislators have begun fighting against the core of the program, picking apart at its protections, hoping to break apart its core administration. They lampoon it as an expensive waste, one which does not protect their constituencies.\n\nI will cut straight to my point. Mr. Rustin, I need your help. Without proper defence, the URI - and all the good it has done for the underprivileged of America - might be destroyed.

The URI was not properly protecting communities of color, in his mind. It was papering over them.\n\nIt shouldn't have bothered her so much. Hart had never kept close with the civil rights movement. It wasn't a reflection on her, or her work, or their connection. Yet it stung all the same. She had been fighting for these issues, trying her damnest to make sure the URI was good for everyone.

Their paths were built to highlight the new housing developments, where lower-income families could find a home. Their marchers walked under new elevated trains which connected their neighborhoods, and over repaved streets that kept them safe.

The market has a natural role to play, but not an exclusive one. For all Americans to have housing, a governmental option is necessary and I view these programs as foundational to my predecessor, President Hart's legacy.

He had speechwriters to punch it up but still wanted to revel in this victory a bit longer, to see it written out before him. It had probably been back in New Orleans the last time he had savored a triumph like this.\n\nOf course it was still concerning that the bill had passed at all and come close to the margin for victory and overcoming his veto. He could not let his guard down and would have to keep lobbying against these bills, regardless of the conservative opposition, if he wanted to keep the URI alive.\n\nIt was good to have a victory under the Morrison Administration's belt, he thought, as he reached for his phone. It would shake the confidence of the heretofore cocky conservatives, confident that the deficit panic would push marginal senators towards repealing the URI piece by piece. Now, maybe, hopefully, the momentum and shifted and his calls would fall on more receptive ears."

  chep.billfail.1.desc: ""Bayh?" Chep Morrison had picked up the phone its first ring. He was expecting the call and was anxious to hear the news. Given the current climate of the Senate, he was expecting the worst and braced himself accordingly. He still had the option to veto the bill, hopefully, and it would not be the last battle in the war to defend the URI.\n\n"The bill failed, Mr. President," Birch Bayh's jovial voice said, chuckles following afterwards, "With all this conservative storming and thundering, it didn't even get fifty one votes." Chep shook his head, annoyed at Bayh.\n\n"This isn't the time for jokes, Birch," He replied testily, "If you're trying to get my hopes up or soften the bad news, just treat me with some respect and come right out with it."\n\n"...No sir, I'm serious," The Vice President replied after an awkward pause, "You won, Mr. Morrison. The Land Reform Act did not pass the Senate." It finally began to sink in to Chep that his gambits and campaigning had worked. The Senate had against all predictions and odds, indeed seen sense.\n\n"Bayh, my apologies. That is wonderful news indeed. Seems like Laxalt and his crowd had more bark than bite. We need to stay vigilant though, one victory doesn't end a war like this but its certainly good for our spirits." He hung up the phone and sat back. He had defended this small piece of the URI at least, but he knew more attacks would be coming. Reinvigorated, he picked up his phone again and started dialing, eager to press his advantage."

  chep.billintros.2.t: "Collateral Damage"
  chep.billintros.2.desc: ""This bill is a rough one, Mr. President," Birch Bayh said as he looked up from the piece of legislation in front of him, "It privatizes damn near most of the URI's public sector jobs. I doubt one in ten survives once the private-sector trims them down to the bare necessities." The stubbornness of the conservatives on this topic nearly made Chep laugh at this point.\n\nThe conservatives and deficit hawks in the Senate were putting hundreds of thousands of jobs on the line. These weren't the pencil-pushing bureaucrats the right rhetorically targeted but instead those who maintained and expanded America's infrastructure, much grown after President Hart's tenure. With these workers gone, America's transportation arteries would begin to atrophy.\n\nChep nearly found it funny, until Bayh walked him through the Senate's disposition. The bill could still very well pass with a veto-proof majority, which wiped any hint of mirth from his face. He still had a job to do and a battle to fight.\n\nThere were marginal senators, one who would appreciate the Administration directing favors their way, or who'd appreciate assistace during campaign season. The activists could also be useful if deployed properly. And of course, these workers themselves had every incentive to fight for their livelihoods, as did every American who used America's roads or rails or waterways.\n\n"Thank you, Vice President Bayh," He replied, coming out of his ponderimg, "I'll start working my way down this list and you do the same. With enough elbow grease, I see at least thirty four senators here who can see sense." Bayh nodded and left, leaving Chep to begin his task."

  chep.billpass.2.desc: "The news from the Senate hit Chep like a lightning bolt. Bayh hadn't called this time, it had been a friendly Democrat who had voted against the bill and volunteered to tell the President the bad news. Chep had thanked the man for his time and vote before hanging up the phone and letting his head fall into his hands.\n\nHe had expected the bill to pass, that would be bad but at least he still had the option to veto. Then the conservatives would have to water their bill down and pass it through the Senate again and if they'd lacked the votes he could have sent it right back to them again. But that hadn't happened. Instead, a supermajority of the Senate had passed the America's Choice Act despite his administration and its allies' lobbying.\n\nNow, tens of thousands of Americans would wake up tomorrow with a cloud over them, never knowing when their job would vanish and their lives be uprooted forever. It hardly bore thinking about, but in this moment of absolute defeat, all Chep could think of was everyone he and the Senate had failed.\n\nHe had rarely felt quite so alone as he did now. There was nothing that Bayh could say at this point, his touch with the Senate had been insufficient and it was now a matter of waiting for the next blow to fall. Nor could he stand seeing Jacobs. She would be even more acutely aware of this bill's fallout and seeing the disappointment in her eyes would be intolerable.\n\nSighing deeply, he reached for the phone. He'd been knocked down, but he was only beaten when he stayed there. His foes were on the march, so he had to be too."

  chep.billveto.2.desc: "Chep took particular pleasure in vetoing the America's Choice Act. He viewed it as a bill motivated purely by spite, destructive and ugly. So when the Senate had passed it, but not with a supermajority, he had been delighted. He had expected it to pass, and it was simply a matter of whether his lobbying efforts and allies' influence would be sufficient to prevent that margin which remained an open question even as the bill went to the floor.\n\nFor the first time in a while, he felt like a real President, preserving an important program that benefitted the country and stood as a legacy for Philip Hart. They had not seen eye to eye but Chep felt a duty to his predecessor's programs built on deep respect for the man. It seemed that some of that residual goodwill remained in the Senate, at least for now. He had his hand back on the ship's tiller, feeling back in control for the first time in a while. His administration had been buffeted and thrown about the storms of history and politics but now they semed to be on a stabler course.\n\nThe conservatives would be back, naturally, with another attack on the URI, on what remained of Philip Hart's ideas for America. Chep Morrison would be waiting for them with every senator, representative, activist and citizen that he could mobilize. The bill had still passed and had a few minds been shifted a devastating blow could well have been dealt to the URI. Resting on his laurels now would only mean falling behind the conservative activits pamphleting across the country. Not one to be outworked, he began dialling, contacting every ally he could to organize speeches, rallies, protests and all other kinds of demonstrations."

We'll be needing them again soon enough and I'm sure they'll need more convincing next round. I still can't quite believe this."\n\n"Neither can I sir, and many congratulations to you. We went from an uphill battle to a clear victory. For all the conservatives' huffing and puffing, this part of the URI is still standing and they didn't even cross fifty one votes." Chep, feeling warmth growing within him, thanked Bayh and hung up the phone. For the first time in a while, he felt well and truly relaxed.\n\nTens of thousands of Americans' jobs had been preserved. Kids would stay at their schools and keep their friends. Homes would be kept and a mini-tidal wave of human misery had been averted. It hadn't been easy fighting off the privatization scheme, requiring all the arm-twisting, speech-making and horse-trading that he had in him. It had stretched his political abilities and endurance to the breaking point in a stretch of campaigning he could only compare as similar to the most frenetic parts of presidential campaigns.\n\nIt had all been worth it though. Even if he knew the conservatives and deficit hawks in Congress would be back again with another attack on the URI when they had regrouped. He would be ready and waiting. Knowing that he could ill-afford to luxuriate in the victory, Chep left the Oval Office.

Chep waved his hand limply, as if to pushing the papers away.\n\n"Well, it mandates municipal audits of URI funding-"\n\n"Typical."\n\n"-with the URI money being received!" Bayh threw the papers on Chep's desk with a frustrated grunt. "It's circular bullshit. When the audits are done, they'll show less money being spent on programs - and instead of blaming the audits, our critics are going to say we're handing out sweetheart contracts, or something."\n\nChep rubbed his face, trying to erase his flabbergasted expression.

How anyone - much less this much of Congress - could get behind one of the most cynical shell games devised in recent memory was beyond him. The government would spend money on its own wasteful audit, and call everything not spent on the audit a 'waste of funds.'\n\nAnd what would come next? Wholesale repeals of President Hart's agenda? Chep wanted to believe that was a bridge too far - but if Congress had passed this garbage, they'd throw everything at the wall just to see what stuck.\n\n"Yes, I heard you," Chep said, as forcefully as he could.

But it had made it through committee and into a full reading - and Chep had to ask himself if he was the crazy one for expecting better.\n\nThe fact that the bill hadn't gotten a veto-proof majority was a silver lining. 'Vetoed because of stupidity' wasn't something Chep could say in front of the cameras, but even the thought put a wry smile on his face as he turned to his aide."

  chep.billintros.4.t: "The Reluctant Devil's Advocate"
  chep.billintros.4.desc: "As Chep Morrison read through the latest bill from Congress, he found himself conflicted. The legislation, called the Workers' Welfare Act, at first appeared like a very mixed bag. It did not repeal any of the URI's new welfare provisions per se, instead it simply bound up the program in voluminous red tape.\n\nIn order to access their benefits, workers would have to show proof that they were employed, not using drugs, that their children were in school, that they were married and on and on and on. Each individual restriction seemed reasonable on its face, but as the pages turned concern mounted within Chep. String enough requirements together, enough demands for proof and paperwork and the number of people eligible for the programs would shrink accordingly.\n\nAnother part of him, less charitable, rejoiced at these restrictions. Why should public funds go to criminals on drugs who wanted their addictions paid for by John Q. Taxpayer? Shouldn't the government be encouraging marriage, work and sobriety? Yet he knew deep down that that was not the intent behind the bill. Rather than repeal this section of the URI, its critics instead would rope it off with red tape, its programs a tantalizing enticement to the many Americans who needed who, unfortunately, would never be able to see the program's fruits.\n\nDisgust rising in him, he pushed the bill away from him. Another attack on the URI was in progress and he would have to be ready to bat it away. Hopefully the senators would see the downsides of the law, and if they did not, he would hopefully at least retain the ability to veto the bill."

  chep.billpass.4.t: "The Silver Lining"
  chep.billpass.4.desc: "A wry smile appeared on President Chep Morrison's voice when he heard the news from the Senate that the Workers' Welfare Act had passed. He had expected that outcome given the bee in the Senate's bonnet regarding the deficit and spending. His mouth hardened somewhat when the margin was announced. A Supermajority. The Senate had taken it out of his hands and now he could not even veto it if he were so inclined.\n\nMaybe it was for the best, he thought. Chep had always been skeptical of unrestricted welfare. He suspected people had a greater capacity for graft and laziness than some believed. He certainly would not have liked the idea of some bum using his hard-earned money to relax and smoke a joint instead of working. Ultimately, he could not truly disagree with the Senate's decision, even if it stung that the ability to veto it had been taken away from him.\n\nIf the URI was going to survive, he reasoned, the most controversial, flawed parts of it would have to go. The Senate had really done him a favor by picking off this part of it. Better that the unrestricted welfare of it be repealed than the transportation provisions, for example. With each new justification, Chep's anxiety eased somewhat. This wasn't his fault, and it might even be a good thing.\n\nPhilip couldn't blame him for this, the Senate had taken it out of his hand. And maybe even he would admit that that element of the URI had been flawed. It did not really matter at this point, the Senate had made clear that it did not particularly value Hart's legacy or Chep's objections when it had spending to cut and programs to wind down. He had tried his best. Chep kept repeating that to himself as the sun began to set and the Oval Office darkened."

  chep.billveto.4.t: "The Stroke of the Pen"
  chep.billveto.4.desc: "Looking at the Workers' Welfare Act before him, Chep hesitated. He had mixed feelings about the bill, the Devil's Advocate within him saying that, out of all the anti-URI bills this was the most reasonable. Maybe it would be better to give the conservatives a victory and satiate them rather than continue to try to hold back the tide.\n\nThen he thought beyond that. He imagined everyone who relied on the URI's programs to pay their rent, to feed their children and to live lives unburdened by crippling poverty. Some would manage to navigate the new requirements for aid under the URI, but far, far too many would fail to do so and lose the lifeline they so desperately needed. He could still prevent that from happening, and he reached for his pen. He had seen some positives within this bill but now at the moment of truth he knew what he had to do.\n\n"I will be vetoing the Workers' Welfare Act. I believe that this is an attempt to de-facto repeal provisions of the Urban Renewal Initiative through the deployment of bureaucratic red tape and labyrinthine procedures. If the Senate takes issue with a program, they should be honest and openly repeal it, not hide behind weasel words and regulations and deceive the American people."\n\nHe smiled as he read over the veto message. He had often felt powerless in the Oval Office but in this moment, wielding the veto power, he felt like a proper executive. This was what the President was supposed to do: wield his powers to defend the vulnerable and marginalized from a penny-pinching legislature. Another plank of the URI would survive, at least until the Senate regrouped and tried again."

I doubt we'll be seeing it again."\n\n"This is wonderful," Jacobs said, clapping her hands happily. She had expected the worst from the Senate but it seemed that the URI's enemies had dropped the ball very badly indeed. The URI's welfare provisions would survive to another day.\n\nAlone amid the celebration, Chep Morrison worried. He knew many Americans were perfectly open to restrictions upon access to welfare. Plenty of hardworking citizens did not like the idea of public funds going to anyone who could fill out a form. He was one of them. With the mood of the country, it did not seem like the best move to be celebrating this victory when it could so easily backfire. Jacobs raised a quizzical eyebrow at him, prompting him for an explanation for his silence.\n\n"I just worry the conservatives will hang any welfare fraud around our necks," He explained, "This bill has problems, but it's trying to deal with serious issues..." He trailed off.\n\n"I see your point, Mr. Morrison," Bayh said, "But these provisions of the URI are popular, and if we want them to work properly then we can't have all these conditions and restrictions placed on them."\n\nJacobs nodded, adding, "When the storm passes, Mr. President, and the conservatives' energy fades, this program will stand as a keystone of the URI.

Devoid of any of the clever workarounds in previous bills, the Transportation Assessment Act was a naked set of cuts to the precautions and regulations that Hart had established during the Oil Crisis. With the energy crisis "over", supposedly, there was no need for these "frivolous" protections.\n\nChep knew it wasn't an attack on Hart, or Jacobs, or even himself. The URI was their target - these men had a host of incentives, ideological, economic, and careerist, a messy entanglement of beliefs and motives which Chep had long given up analyzing. Yet he couldn't help but see it as low. No matter what they screamed on the television, these men had to understand the reason that energy precautions were vital - they had seen the oil crisis play out all across the globe. Even after watching others fall, they were still happy to hack at the ropes beneath their feet.\n\nChep sighed. He was just one man.

The final systems of the URI, the emergency energy precautions, had been left in tatters.\n\nIn the wake of the law passing, Birch Bayh attempted to convince Chep that the government could continue—that there were answers, bodies to save from this fire. But Chep couldn't believe it, even consider it. All Chep could think of were the people he had failed, the nation that he had failed, and the predecessor he had failed.

The emergency precautions which the Hart administration built would last a while longer.\n\nIn the days afterward, Chep thought long and hard about the few senators who had gotten off the URI bandwagon to abstain from the Transportation Assessment Act. Perhaps even some of the anti-URi crowd understood, deep in their hearts, the misery which the energy crisis inflicted across America. They must have understood that America deserved to never face such a horror again.\n\nWhatever they felt, it was a victory.

He hobbled across the enormous circular carpet of the Oval Office and sat himself behind the Resolute Desk. He stared at the few knick-knacks he'd decorated the surface with—a baseball, a snow globe of New Orleans, a photo of him and Philip Hart. He grabbed the last object and put it gingerly in the desk drawer.\n\nThe Urban Renewal Initiative was gone. Most of what he and Hart had worked for was gone. Every struggle that he and the cabinet had gone through, every sacrifice that they had made had been for nothing. Two entire administrations had been disintegrated in the course of a single evening.\n\nChep set his head on the desk.

He hoped that next year, people would realize the selfish, treacherous behaviour of the conservatives and vote them out, securing Philip and Chep's legacies.\n\nOf course, he decided to distract himself from the failures of his term as President - attending parties and spending time with Zsa Zsa, but his mind always wandered back to the damage done to the URI.

Hart's Presidency saved it from demolition and the neighbourhood was revitalised by the development schemes his administration created. This was why after her retirement as Housing, Education, and Welfare Secretary, Jane Jacobs decided to return and spend time with the people she had fought for.\n\nSure enough, The Village was delighted to host her, and Jane Jacobs got to experience genuine gratitude for the first time in a long while after the Urban Renewal Initiative was cut to the bone in Congress. A reporter from the local newspaper asked her, "Mrs. Jacobs, would you say that you are happy with the work that you have completed under Presidents Hart and Morrison?" Jane responded, a forced smile on her face with, "Yes, absolutely." "Do you intend to do more work on urban issues in the future?" "I may well end up doing so, but right now I need to spend some time at home to remind myself of what I was working for in Congress."\n\nAs she settled back into her life prior to being in the presidential cabinet, she could clearly see that her work had affected everyone in The Village's lives for the better. However, she was still bitterly regretful of the Administration's failures, blaming President Chep Morrison for it mostly but also questioning her own skills when it came to the preservation of the Urban Renewal Initiative."

  chep.mehending.3.t: "Back Home in the Big Easy"
  chep.mehending.3.desc: "Chep Morrison had been a decent Vice President and, under the circumstances, had done alright as President, but it was in the role of tour guide for New Orleans that he truly shone, Birch Bay reflected. After their string of legislative losses in Washington, leaving the URI battered and bloody, they had come to Chep's hometown to get their minds off of the defeats. Thus far, they had had little success.\n\nWandering the city, Chep blathered about every street and store and occasionally stopped to chat with friendly pedestrians. The question of the URI loomed: Had it survived, would New Orleans be different? Better? Safer? The questions went on and neither man wanted to address them. Coming to some invisible line between two neighborhoods, Chep halted and looked around.\n\n"This is a bad part of town, Bayh. I think we should turn around." Bayh's eyebrows furrowed. It didn't look like a bad area, but then a passing family greeted Morrison.\n\n"Mr. Morrison," The father said, beaming, "I doubt you remember me, but we met at a campaign event back in '54. Frank Richmond. I just wanted to thank you for all the fighting you've been doing for those of us here. I've lived in this neighborhood for decades but it was only when you and Philip Hart were in the White House that things got better." Chep graciously thanked the man, greeted his children and continued his walk with Bayh.\n\nHe had a new spring in his step, the Vice President noticed. Perhaps meeting supporters from happier times had dredged up fond memories when his only concern was the city of New Orleans. Maybe meeting those who had been helped by his seemingly futile battle had given all of his struggles and suffering of late meaning. Whatever it was, Bayh was content not to pry."
  chep.mehending.3.a: "A bright spot in a troubled time."

  chep.chepgoodending.1.t: "Polling"
  chep.chepgoodending.1.desc: "Democratic Leader Hubert Humphrey found himself half-walking, half-running through the halls of the White House—pushing through scores of aides on his way to President Chep Morrison's side office. When he finally swung open the door, gleefully presenting the latest GallUp polling like a Roman might present an eagle, he saw Chep and Birch Bayh already staring at their own reports?\n\n"Have you...?"\n\nChep looked up. "The polls? We sure as hell have, Hubert. I mean—. Christ. I was just telling Bayh. I was just—."\n\n"The President is quite excited as you can see," said Birch Bayh with a mischievous smile. "I think we had all hoped to staunch the bleeding vis-a-vis the URI but it seems like—."\n\n"A 10 point increase in support among union voters! 15 percent increase in support among likely urban voters!" Roared Chep with uncharacteristic gusto. "3 percent increase among rural voters!" He slapped his hand against the pages of the report, smile brimming from ear to ear. "Do you know what this means?"\n\nNeither Hubert nor Bayh said anything. The President was clearly having a moment.\n\n"We've got the razor to the conservatives' throats. The bastards thought they had us but with these numbers... With these numbers the do-nothings in Congress won't have a prayer in the world to destroy the URI. The stupid, rotten bastards."\n\nHumphrey cleared his throat but he could not repress a smile. "Not the language I would use but, yes. Let's talk next steps.""
  chep.chepgoodending.1.a: "A conservative revolution, defeated."

  chep.chepgoodending.2.t: "Night"
  chep.chepgoodending.2.desc: "It had been a long work day in the White House. 5 o'clock had come and gone with few staffers departing from their offices. As the sun set and the late-night shows began, Chep and Birch Bayh found themselves still huddled together in the Oval.\n\nThe Indianan took a look at his watch. "Mr. President, I've come to enjoy our chats, but if I'm not home soon, I think Marvella and the kids might kill me. I really have to go."\n\nChep blinked, amazed himself that he'd willingly stayed in the Oval so long. "Of course, of course, Birch. I want to finish up a few things here but you should get back. Send your wife my love." The vice President mouthed a thanks. He began to put on his suit coat when Chep spoke up again. "Before you go, Birch, I wanted to say... Thank you. I don't think you can ever know how much I appreciate everything you've done."\n\n"It's been an honor, sir," said Birch with a smile. Then he left.\n\nChep found himself alone again. After a few minutes of silence, he picked up the telephone. There was a short ring before a woman's voice answered. She seemed happy. He could hear sounds of laughter in the background. "Hello, this is Jane Jacobs."\n\n"Jane, it's Chep," said the President. "Do you have a minute?"\n\nNot long ago, she might have brushed him off. There was a pause before she said, "Of course."\n\n"With this URI fight out of the way, I've been thinking a lot about Philip and how we can preserve his legacy. You've always had a better brain for this stuff than me. Do you think you could help me come up with some ideas?""
  chep.chepgoodending.2.a: ""I think I could come up with a few ideas, Mr. President.""

  chep.chepgoodending.3.t: "Proceedings"
  chep.chepgoodending.3.desc: "Birch Bayh sat at the head of the Senate Chamber, looking down from the rostrum at the assembled body of United States Senators. He did little to hide his obvious satisfaction as he leaned into the microphone. "The Senate will come to order."\n\nFactions of stodgy men separated from their discussions and hobbled to their desks. Bayh smirked as a group of conservatives and nationalists, obviously upset at the day's proceedings, scowled and slumped behind their desks. A Democratic Senator rose and approached a podium on the floor.\n\n"For what purpose does the gentleman rise?" asked Bayh.\n\n"Mr. President, I send to the desk a privileged report from the Committee on Rules for filing under the rule."\n\nBayh gestured toward the Senate clerk. "The clerk will report the title."\n\n"Report to accompany Senate Bill 1316, an Act providing for creation of a Presidential Library system commemorating past, present, and future Presidents, amending..."\n\nThe title went on as Bayh rotated back and forth in his seat. Yes, the bill was a bit hokey—a series of expenditures to create civic temples to the likes of John F. Kennedy, Philip Hart, and other presidential stalwarts. Yes, it was not a bill that would transform lives or remake America so much as preserve the accomplishments of the past for generations to come. But seeing the anger of conservatives at the prospect of a temple to Chep Morrison and Philip Hart made it all worth it."
  chep.chepgoodending.3.a: "There is debate on the floor but there is no question of which way the vote will go."

  chep.chepgoodending.4.t: "Remembrance"
  chep.chepgoodending.4.desc: "It was quiet on Calvert Street, the first long quiet that Janey Hart had enjoyed in a long time. The kids had finally left the house—to return to their own lives, families, and careers. The reporters, so relentless in the first days after her husband's passing, had stopped camping outside her home. All that remained was her and her husband's Secret Security detail, both enjoying the chance to be idle, blissfully detached from Washington.\n\nThen, without warning, there was a ring on the telephone. Janey let it ring once, then twice, before she raised herself from the den—the place where Philip had spent his final few days—and toward the kitchen. "Hello—?"\n\n"Hello, this is the White House switchboard. Patching through the President, please hold," said a young woman. There was a buzz. Then, Chep was on the line. "Hello, Janey! It's Chep. The President. I... I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time?"\n\nJaney repressed a smile. Even after everything, it was remarkable how awkward Chep could be. "Not at all. How can I help you?"\n\n"I'm not sure if you're watching the TV right now, but I wanted to let you know, uh, the Presidential Libraries Bill passed." There was a pause. "I wanted to be the first. I wanted to be the first to let you know that we're going to preserve Philip's legacy." Another pause. "There'll be a whole building, an entire campus if you want, to make sure everyone knows of his integrity."\n\nJaney closed her eyes and gave a sad smile. "Thank you, Chep. That... that means a lot. Really. I know things were hard in the last few days, but Phil really thought the world of you. I hope you know that."\n\nThere was another silence but this time Janey thought she could hear someone choking down a sob. "Thank you, Janey.""
  chep.chepgoodending.4.a: ""If you haven't picked a location for the library yet, I have some ideas, Chep.""

  chep.chepgoodending.5.t: "Legacy"
  chep.chepgoodending.5.desc: "Chep Morrison promised himself he would not cry at the groundbreaking of the Philip Hart Presidential Library. He had asked Zsa Zsa to play interference if she noticed his face quivering. Hell, he'd even asked Bayh to intervene if he got emotional during his address. To their infinite credit, both had agreed and so, the President found himself standing behind a stage that jutted against the banks of the Detroit River, trying to keep his emotions in check, as the mayor delivered his remark.\n\n"Hello, Chep," said a voice. Chep looked up from his note cards to see Jane Jacobs dressed in a smooth black dress. "How's the last-minute speechwriting going?"\n\nChep smiled. It was the first time either of them had seen each other in person since the end of the URI repeal effort. Jane had kept to her department while Chep had kept to the White House. It was easier that way, less friction. "Oh, the usual. 'Today is a happy moment. In dedicating this library, we honor Philip but we also honor the best in our country.' That kind of thing."\n\n"Sounds like you've got it handled. I look forward to the address."\n\nThey looked at one another. While Chep doubted they would ever be friends, he and Jane Jacobs had formed a kind of accord. Long gone were the days of sniping in cabinet meetings. They respected one another and the work they'd done for Philip, for America. They'd fought side by side and emerged stronger for it.\n\nThere were claps from beyond the stage. Any moment now, Chep would be called to deliver his remarks. He gave a polite thanks and, before he revealed himself to the assembled crowd, he turned back to Jane. "Now that we've preserved Hart's legacy, do you think we could build one of our own?""
  chep.chepgoodending.5.a: "The secretary smiled, "Yes, Chep. I really think we could.""

  chep.perfection.1.t: "Succession"
  chep.perfection.1.desc: "It was strange to find himself surrounded by so many party leaders after being rejected by them for so long. There was Humphrey, Boggs, Mansfield. Even Ted Kennedy had found a way to saunter into the Watergate Hotel conference room, giving the President an awkward handshake and grimace before sitting at the end of the table. There were a few moments of small talk about their kids and wives before Humphrey cleared his throat.\n\n"Mr. President, first of all I wanted to tell you well done on the speech in Detroit the other day. I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend but it sounds like you gave a very moving address." Chep gave a small smile. He liked Humphrey but there was a part of him that was unsure if he was being praised or patronized.\n\n"But what we want to come here to discuss is the future—the party's future," said Hale Boggs with a look of importance. "I will confess that I—. Many of us were skeptical when you first came into office. You had big shoes to fill, but you've done a better job than any of us could have imagined. You really—."\n\n"They want you to run for President, Chep," said Ted Kennedy in a New England nasal that a Senate seat in Colorado had done little to erase. He looked strangely calm, as if he'd come to begrudgingly accept the logic. "If you run, you'll be the nominee."\n\nChep looked at them all and then at his folded hands. For the first time since arriving in Washington, he'd been truly accepted. This meeting was the fulfillment of a lifetime of work and yet... "No." Chep shook his head. "This office isn't for me. I've served my time. I've done my part. I'm ready to step off the stage."\n\n"But—.""
  chep.perfection.1.a: "Chep laughed, "What's the old saying? If drafted, I will not run; if nominated, I will not accept?""

  #Kissinger epilogue
  chep.kissinger.epilogue.1.t: "For Old Time's Sake"
  chep.kissinger.epilogue.1.desc: "Henry Kissinger was, it was safe to say, a rather regular customer at the Sans Souci restaurant. He must have taken dates, diplomats, and fellow administration officials to the posh French eatery hundreds of times. But something about this time felt different. "You have my condolences, of course, for the loss of President Hart," Takeuchi said, sipping from his wine. "He was a man of vision, and I know he will be remembered fondly in Japan for many generations to come."\n\n"Yes." Kissinger nodded. "I admit I had my disagreements with him, but at the end of the day he proved willing to do what was necessary no matter his... convictions. America, I believe, finds itself worse off for his passing."\n\nTakeuchi raised his eyebrows. "And how is President Morrison faring, then?"\n\nKissinger snorted. "You know, I'd find it humorous to observe his failures if I didn't have to spend every waking hour cleaning up his messes. Here I am, working against the greatest threat to the international order in the history of the world, and that man wants me to talk to the press about some trivial budgetary concerns. He will be a disaster, I can already tell."\n\nTakeuchi gave an amused smile. "This does not surprise me," he replied. "As I recall in our meeting following his inauguration I needed to point out the Manchurian Empire for him on a map. He had thought it to be in Central Asia!"\n\nKissinger snickered. "Oh, I can just picture that!" He affected an exaggerated southern dialect. "Man-what now? Is that about where we be fightin' them A-rabs?" Takeuchi burst out laughing, gingerly wiping some wine he'd spilled on the table. It was nice, Kissinger realized. Nice to be, for once, doing nothing more in the Sans Souci than sharing a meal with a friend."

 USA_chep_The_Morrison_Presidency_desc: "Well, goddamn. What else can you say?\n\nWhen we took this position six years ago, it was never, ya know, outta personal ambition. We never saw ourselves as a President, as commander-in-chief or any of that stuff. We saw ourselves as more of a promoter, a man from the Bayou who could make sure the common folk weren't forgotten in the party's sprint left. We came to Washington outta duty and obligation.\n\nAnd look where that's gotten us. Philip's dead—God rest his soul—and the nation's in mourning. His cabinet of eggheads see us as little more than a country bumpkin and are already plotting their exits. It'll take a lot to survive the next coupla years. Let's hope we have it in us."
 USA_chep_The_Temptations_of_Saint_Chep_desc: "It's important not to panic. We just gotta take a deep breath. We gotta assess the situation. We gotta... Oh. Oh God.\n\nIt doesn't take a brainiac to tell that things aren't looking great. Since Philip's passing, the cabinet's been in open revolt, determined to get outta dodge before they can be blamed for the incompetence of poor Chep. The Republicans and Nationalists in Congress have been on the prowl, lookin' for ways to demolish whatever Chep doesn't bulldoze himself. Even our old friends in the press have been houding us, eager for sensationalistic stories about Zsa Zsa and all that.\n\nIt's a lot but we can't let it get to us. Just take a deep breath, smile as we always do, and show people what you're capable of. We're no Philip Hart, but we can still show that we have what it takes to lead."
 USA_chep_The_Better_desc: "To get the cabinet in line, we gotta start by winning over our most vocal opponents. We're not talkin' Kissinger, that ass-kissing bastard, or Lansdale. We're talkin' the mother of all Northern elites, Jane Jacobs.\n\nIt's been no secret that we haven't always seen eye to eye. Jane has—unfairly—always thought of us as a huckster and a charlatan, a holdover from an early age of Southern Democratic politics. We, on the other hand, have always seen Jane as a kind of pencil-necked brainiac who has no goddamn idea how hard it is to get anything done in this country. Still, we have one thing in common—we both loved Philip. Let's see if we can work together, this one time, to save his legacy."
 USA_chep_Mannish_Man_desc: "People often say marriage is tough but never how tough. It forces you to make sacrifices you never thought you'd have to make. It turns you into a person you can't recognize in the mirror. It leaves you feeling all hollow inside. Sometimes we lay awake at night and wonder if the Kennedys ever felt the same way...\n\nBut this isn't about them. This is about Zsa Zsa. We've tried to be patient and understanding, but things haven't been good between us for a long while. She's said things, hurtful things, to the press. She's lashing out, looking for a way to hurt us and the country. Given Jane's advice, we know we can't ignore this any longer. We gotta talk to her and reach an understanding."

Hell, it was exactly these kind of folks we dealt with in Louisiana, always sayin' "no" to projects 'cause they lacked the imagination to see what was beyond their noses. Washington's no different. In fact, it might be worse.\n\nSince Phil—may God bless him and his family—passed, the usual ragtag group of conservative blowhards have been sitting and plotting. All of 'em, from Goldwater down, have been gunning for the URI, lookin' for ways to tear apart the President's greatest legacy. They know they can't repeal it all, not so long as we hold the veto pen, but they can always underfund it so it withers on the vine.\n\nWe gotta act fast to nip this threat in the bud before it's too late."
 USA_chep_Domino_Theory_desc: "Oh hell, they're going for it. They're going for the URI. They aren't even waiting until Philip's cold yet. Those bastards. Those conservative sons of bitches. The cocksuckers.\n\nIt's time to pull out every name in the rolodex, every card that Hart left us behind to stop this. We need everyone from the cabinet to the common man to assemble and show that this act is unacceptable. Only through a massive show of public support can we save the URI from destruction. Let's see if we still have any charm left to pull this kind of rescue mission off."
 USA_chep_Demons_in_the_Cave_desc: "Look, we've always thought of ourselves as a friend to all races. The Blacks, you know how they are, benefited from a lot we did as Mayor of New Orleans and Governor, even aren't happy about it now. We brought in a lotta new business. We cleaned up a lotta crime. Goddamn it, we did what we thought was right at the time. We didn't know all this "gentrification" and "police brutality" thing that Jane is always barking about now.\n\nBut... look, we know we're not these people's first choice. Philip was. And if we're gonna live up to Philip's legacy and hold together what he built, then we're gonna need to fess up to what we did a long time ago. We're not the ideal candidate for this kind of flower-child "healing and reconciliation" thing, but maybe we can reach an understanding with the groups most likely to oppose us."
 USA_chep_Big_Talk_desc: "Did you fellas hear about how Chep Morrison was one of the folks pushing hardest for the highway improvements? Did you know that Philip Hart came to Chep first about the Americar? How about how Chep used his experience from New Orleans to build the URI and the Crime Bill? The environmental reforms?\n\nIf there's one thing we and Zsa Zsa have always excelled at, it's been the razzle dazzle—inflating the truth just a little bit to win support from the rubes in the crowd. While we've often done this for less than selfless reasons, here it's gonna be important to get us the political capital we need to survive the next few months. If people think we were the one always making decisions side-by-side with Hart, then they might be a little more accepting of us at the Resolute Desk. Let's just hope Janey Hart doesn't react too badly."
 USA_chep_Bayhing_Time_desc: "There's all sorts of nasty things that get said about the vice presidency. Thomas Jefferson considered it "splendid misery." Daniel Webster called it a premature burial. Even the South's own John Nance Garner described it as less valuable than a bucket of warm piss. And, sure, all those sayings are witty and memorable and get passed around at fancy parties but that doesn't make 'em true. The last coupla years with Hart have shown that the Vice Presidency can mean a whole hell of a lot if you let it. It's why our first priority has got to be getting our old office filled.\n\nAfter talking it over with the great minds of Congress, it looks like Birch Bayh from the Great State of Indiana is our best pick for a second-in-command. The man is young. He's a great speaker. And he's apparently got a real knack for managing legislation that will be critical if we're to survive in office. Let's offer him the appointment and hope we can get it through the Senate."

These rotten, crooked bastards from the United States Senate, so goddamn miserable about having to live with themselves that they inflict their misery on other people...\n\nOver the last week, the leaders of the greatest deliberative body have marched to the White House and made it clear in no uncertain terms that they don't like us. They consider us a poor replacement for Hart—God bless him—and their constituents feel the same, unsure why a pathetic dandy from Louisiana and his tabloid wife are in the Executive Mansion. It doesn't take an astute observer to know that all this is readying for an assault, not just on our power but on the power of government as well. Soon enough, they'll be trying to tear down the house we built with Hart."
 USA_chep_Without_Reward_desc: "People don't know this—the press like it when we talk about the water-skiing and fancy parties—but we pray every night. We get down on our knees and give a real, old-school Catholic prayer to the Lord on High. Zsa Zsa doesn't like it, she's made comments about it before, but it's a habit that helps us get through the toughest times.\n\nLately, all our prayers have been about the Urban Renewal Initiative. We've been begging God, please let us save this. Please let us do this one good thing for poor Philip. Give us the strength we need to be a good President, to preserve those things that the both of us worked hard for. We'll do whatever you ask. Just let us get through this."
 USA_chep_No_Sleep_desc: "It's been a long time coming, this assault, and no amount of praying was ever gonna stop it. Every corner of the conservative establishment—from the National Review to the American Enterprise Institute—has gathered their forces to loot and pillage this Administration. Their agents march through the Halls of Congress, ready to take down the URI like the old Visgoths took down Rome.\n\nIt's awful, an awful thing. And all we can do is watch as it unfolds. Every day, we pace through the halls of a House we never wanted, surrounded by people who don't like us, in a country that does not know us. We spend sleepless nights pouring Philip's old paper trying to find some secret to fix this whole goddamn mess, to make it turn out all right.\n\nAre we the right man for this fight? Or will we wind up as nothing but a gravedigger of history?"
 USA_chep_Morning_desc: "The assault through the night was long and hard. The hawks came at us with everything they had, corralling senators from all parts of the country to support their URI bill. It could have destroyed us. It could have destroyed Hart—God rest his soul—but we held our defenses. We stopped the bastards at the gates and lived to see a new dawn.\n\nSomething has changed in Washington, with this whole presidency. It's visible in the White House and it's visible from Congress. Everyone knows that Chep Morrison isn't some Southern softie that you can push around. He's gonna use everything he's got to keep this country moving."

Goddamn if it doesn't look gorgeous, if it isn't a beautiful day to entertain a few folks from the good days of the Hart Administration.\n\nThe person we're most interested in entertaining right now is Walter Reuther. When the news first emerged that Philip—may he rest in peace—would hand us the reins, Reuther took a step back. He didn't know if we were friend or enemy, if we had it in us to stand up against the goddamn budget hawks around Congress. Now that he knows we have fight in us, he's willing to mobilize his boys to stop these conservative bastards. The two of us can really work together to show just what the Democratic Party can do when it's united."
 USA_chep_Supper_desc: "The midday turns to dusk. Busy people return from work. They're tired, exhausted, and ready for to let off some steam. More than anything else, they want to be entertained. Lucky for us, Chep Morrison has always been good at that.\n\nAs the conservatives continue their assault on the legacy of Philip Hart—grant him serenity, Oh Lord—President Morrison is going to be on television every night reminding America what it is exactly they're threatening to do. This isn't about numbers on a balance sheet, oh no, it's about starvin' kids getting fed and clean, well-paved roads. We'll use the most outrageous rhetoric we can think of—little ol' ladies being gunned down in the street, families freezing to death in their homes—to remind them of what's at stake here. If we can rile people up, chances are we can spook off some of our opposition."
 USA_chep_Show_Face_desc: "Now comes the end of night and, with it, the end of the whole rotten mess. We've done good stayin' strong, keepin' on the defense. We didn't let the bastards get us down, as Nixon woulda said. And with the enemies repelled, it's time for us to press our case.\n\nIt's not just that Congress wants to kill little ol' ladies and starvin' kids and the homeless, it's that it does nothing except that. What we got in Washington is a Do-Nothing Congress, one so beholden to radicals like Phyllis Schlafly and Barry Goldwater that they're unwilling to do anything to help the American people. We'll talk to reporters about all the things that Congress hasn't been doing—how they killed price controls and they killed any hope of a housing bill. We'll talk about how the only thing on conservatives' minds is making sure poor old Chep is a one-term President."
 USA_chep_TXTICON_desc: "It's done. The conservatives have cocked up all of their chances of meaningfully repealing the URI. They can hold committee hearings and force symbolic votes all day, but all of 'em know that nothing is getting past Chep Morrison's veto pen. All they can do is stamp their feet and cry, the poor bastards. Imagine being some Washington bigshot and getting outgunned by some henpecked Louisiana dandy.\n\nWith the threats ended and the end of our term approaching, we think it's time we do something for ourselves: An Oval Office Address. We're gonna do our first televised address since becoming the President of the United States to show the nation who we are and what we're capable of. Most folks won't think that we have a legacy but what do they know? Saving Hart's URI—God bless him—is enough for us to sleep at night."
 USA_chep_The_Dynasty_desc: "It took everything we had in us, along with the help of a few friends, but we survived an onslaught and made our mark in Washington. There's just one more journey left for us, one last chance to honor a truly great President."

    POLITICS_Zsa_Zsa_Gabor_DESC: "Darling, darling, what are you doing mousing over my face like that? Don't you know it's rude to get that intimate on a first date? Oh, you brute. I let weeks go by before I let my dear deLesseps get that close. Now you suppose you can throw all caution to the wind and get intimate right away? After all you've done? An upstanding, professional woman like myself might doubt your intentions.\n\nBut don't get dejected, darling. I'm happy to talk. I'm happy to sit down with a dirty, rotten scoundrel like yourself. Goodness knows I've had to endure plenty like you before—Conrad Hilton, Atatürk, Kissinger. Why, some nasty men once made me dance with Adolf Hitler, twice if you can believe it. It was an awful ordeal. You cannot imagine how awful these last few years have been for me having to deal with all these pathetic displays of manhood.\n\nBut now it's my time, darling. Now that you've shown that you aren't interested in narrative, that you aren't interested in character or drama or even all the lovely pictures I've helped put together, I've decided it's time to take charge. I'm going to do what neither Hart nor my DeLesseps had the guts to do: bring about one thousand years of liberal darkness. Every pothole will be paved. Every family will be fed. Every woman will be made a girl boss of terrible power.\n\nNo more cheats. No more console commands. Now there is only Zsa Zsa Gabor."
