  ship_hull_carrier_1:1 "Early Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "The dawn of the carrier was the Second World War, and those which survived it are old but dangerous beasts nonetheless. Few expect those that remain to see combat and survive however."
  ship_hull_carrier_2:1 "Basic Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "The 50's were an age of experimentation for the proponents of carrier-based warfare. Improvements and redesigns mark the carriers of this era as more prototypes than weapons in and of themselves."
  ship_hull_carrier_3:1 "Improved Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the tensions of the world rising, the 60's mark an increase in the number of carriers built worldwide, ones without the weaknesses of their ancestors. These vessels will be the backbone of any war fought at sea."
  ship_hull_carrier_4:1 "Advanced Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_4_desc:0 "Where the 60's were an age of expansion, the 70's are an age of fortification. Carriers built to withstand more punishment and dish out more than their worth in return. These vessels were built to last."
  ship_hull_carrier_5:1 "Semi-Modern Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_5_desc:0 "The carrier of the 80's is something built for a world it is not likely to see. Amidst the tensions and disasters, these titans of the waves sail on to their duties regardless."
  ship_hull_carrier_6:1 "Modern Carrier Hull"
  ship_hull_carrier_6_desc:0 "In the era of new and advanced designs, the carriers of the 90's might not be as numerous as those which came before but they can also quite likely destroy three or four of their ancestors without issue nor complaint."

  submarine_4_desc:0 "Submarines have only gotten deadlier with age. Active/passive sonar guided torpedoes have been introduced, and their accuracy is dazing. Counter measures, such as noise makers and coatings that reflect sonar have been developed to counter new threats. Paired with smaller, more efficient power plants, submarines are deadlier than ever."
  submarine_5:0 "Semi-Modern Attack Submarine"
  submarine_5_desc:0 "From the literal bottom of the ocean to the surface of any waters, submarines can go virtually anywhere with impunity. Their propulsion systems have been nearly perfected, meaning subs can move faster underwater without cavitation. Towed sonar arrays are now a common feature on most submarines, and many even come with their own radar systems."
  submarine_6:0 "Modern Attack Submarine"
  submarine_6_desc:0 "With virtually unlimited endurance, only limited by fresh food and water on board, these submarines are cutting edge in every way. Torpedoes with ranges of nearly 40 kilometers and unmatched detection systems means unwary ships could be hit without any warnings, any time, anywhere."
