 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_TROFIM_LYSENKO_DESC: "Trofim Lysenko was once hailed by the Soviet Union as the golden child of socialist science. At last, a humble proletarian scientist who was dismissing the reactionary "education" propagated by bourgeois institutions! A man who has proven that the principles of Marx apply not only to human societies, but to the very fruits of the earth! His theories will revolutionize agronomy and transform the Soviet Union into a global agricultural juggernaut! Darwinism is the past, and Lysenkoism is the future!\n\nAt the very least, that was what he promised.\n\nWhile his results were far more disappointing, the convenient arrival of the war saved him from facing serious consequences. Lysenko and his clique of loyal scientists were evacuated east by the 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD as the Soviet front lines collapsed, to prevent his "vital research" from falling into fascist hands. When the Union disintegrated, Lysenko found himself without patronage and the 22nd found themselves without orders, so an alliance was struck between the two groups. He swayed the 22nd's leaders into believing that his research was still necessary to continue for the good of the Union, even if the Union had ceased to exist as a coherent state, and that a new research facility was necessary. After working for (and eventually leaving) the West Russian Revolutionary Front, they found a haven in the abandoned industrial city of Magnitogorsk, turning the once-derelict Black Mountain into a hub of research and scientific innovation.\n\nLysenko, however, never abandoned his pseudo-Lamarckian view of evolution, however, and continued to pour time and resources into proving it right. And with the Union in such dire straits, there might be military merit in proving that his theories apply to humans as well..."

 POLITICS_STEPAN_BUNKOV_DESC: "Stepan Mikhailovich Bunkov, the irreplaceable commander of the 22nd NKVD Motor Division, faithfully served the Soviet Motherland even after it was crushed by the German tanks. Little is known how exactly his paths intersected with the path of Lysenko, but it is commonly believed comrade Bunkov was tasked by the Kremlin right before the fall of Moscow to evacuate the scientific and technical intelligentsia to the Urals so they could labor for the benefit of the country even when the heart of Russia succumbed to the invader. In their travels, unrequired by every other self-proclaimed successor of the Soviet Union, Lysenko established his control the exiled scientist clique and turned the NKVD division into his weapon of suppression and terror.\n\nSince their arrival in Magnitogorsk, Bunkov took a part in numerous atrocities overseen by Lysenko, putting his faith in Lysenko's best judgment. However, as the experiments of Lysenko became more and more brutal and insane in their nature, Bunkov grew more skeptical and opposing towards the Magnitogorsk scientific elite, to the point of considering Lysenko a liability to the restoration of the Soviet ways. Bunkov took the initiative against his former master and overthrew Lysenko to take his place. During his short rule, Bunkov finished with many of the Lysenkoist nightmares and put forth attempts to rebuild the old Soviet institutions, putting an end to anarchy that reigned under Lysenko. But as his grip over the country holds tight, it wouldn't be reprehensible to assume that we can resort to no less brutal measures to keep the dissented population in line."

 MGN.142.a: "Communique Over"

 MGN.1.t: "Dirlewanger's Raid"
 MGN.1.d: "When we agreed to work with Dirlewanger and his band of crazies, Comrade Lysenko agreed to turn a blind eye to a raid or two within what is technically our area of influence. After all, we have ingenious experiments to keep an eye on and better uses of our forces than protecting turnip farmers. Besides, the population Dirlewanger has promised us from later, greater, raids will more than make up for what we lose during the impending attack reported by our patrols. Dirlewanger's bandits are descending upon a helpless village, but we have taken anyone of value from it already. We shall not interfere."
 MGN.1.a: "We will allow this... for now."

 MGN.2.t: "The Deal Changed - Lysenko's Response"
 MGN.2.d: "Our relationship with the bandit scum Oskar Dirlewanger has been going perfectly thus far, his numerous raids providing a steady stream of live specimens for our experiments. In return we simply give him the old equipment we no longer particularly care about, which seems to keep them happy.\n\nThat seems to have changed, however. This morning Dirlewanger's slavemaster arrived with the latest batch of captives, but claims the deal has changed. Apparently Dirlewanger is of the mindset that he is doing all of the work, and so he deserves a bigger piece of the pie than he is currently getting.\n\nAs we have ongoing experiments which require these specimens to continue, a decision must be made."
 MGN.2.a: "Dirlewanger makes a fair point."
 MGN.2.b: "That scum will get nothing!"

 MGN.3.t: "Dirlewanger Demands Double"
 MGN.3.d: "That degenerate Dirlewanger has apparently been launching new raids of late, striking a 'mighty blow' against one of his enemies. We don't really care which one. Yet as a result, he has slave pens full of captives and as per our agreements is ready to send them over to us.\n\nBut being the swine that he is he claims that the losses they took in the latest raids demand more than the previously agreed upon amount, having the gall to demand double!\n\nHanding over more of our technology isn't a big deal in and of itself, it is more the principle that these thugs think they can bully us into doing whatever they want. Every time we give Dirlewanger an inch, he takes a mile. But on the flip side, the more equipment we give them the more eager they will be to do their little raids and even greater attacks on Orenburg and the League. The more fighting they do, the more of them die as well as our joint enemies. How shall we respond?"
 MGN.3.a: "Authorize double payment."
 MGN.3.b: "Half the original amount will teach him."

 MGN.608.t: "Excerpts from Experiment Report 2.25.034"
 MGN.608.desc: "Objective: Create a viable specimen adapted to low-level oxygen conditions, with an emphasis on survivability against chemical weapons.\n\nSubject: One (1) male, aged 16. Extracted from XXXXXXXXXX, near Svetlogorsk.\n\nProcedure: Subject's oxygen supply was reduced over the course of ten hours, at a rate of 7% per hour. Subject was initially calm after being placed in the testing chamber, though after two hours began to show signs of distress. This distress can likely be attributed to a lack of human contact and anxiety stemming from confinement. After four hours, subject began to complain of lightheadedness and fatigue. Around the six hour mark, subject shifted repeatedly between consciousness and unconsciousness, and preparations were made for the second stage of the test. Subject fell unconscious after roughly XXX hours (Although XXXXXX was observed in this state), and did not resume consciousness until retrieved from the chamber. Afterwards, subject was exposed to a nominally lethal dose of phosgene gas. Subject reported symptoms in line with baseline exposure and subsequently expired 26 hours after exposure. Autopsy of the subject revealed the lungs to be filled with fluid, in line with nominal exposure to phosgene gas.\n\nResult: Experimental regime failed to create a specimen capable of surviving common chemical weaponry. Notify XXXX Department of XXXXXX findings."
 MGN.608.a: "Report 2.25.034 over."
 MGN.608.a.tt: "233 subjects were rendered unrecoverable by the experiments.\n\nLysenko's sanity has improved.\nThe NKVD is increasingly worried by Lysenko's experiments."

 MGN.51.t: "Communiqué 07.j"
 MGN.51.d: "Investigation of Magnitogorsk armory storage facilities, and subsequent testing of equipment discovered within, has indicated that weapons stored within protected locations (Depots, Armories, Caches) prior to the collapse of the USSR remain in working condition for the most part. Out of 320 recovered Mosin-Nagant 91/30 rifles (See weapon profile summary 1-c), 278 were still usable and the remainder require only minor maintenance to be restored. Though not as well preserved, ammunition within the armory still remained usable, with a survey estimating that of the 4,500 7.62x54mmR rounds recovered, 3,200 are still usable.\n\nOperating under the assumption that the conditions of the Magnitogorsk arsenal are similar to those of other Soviet era weapons caches, it is probable that there are large numbers of functional military-grade weapons and support equipment unaccounted for within our territory. The location and retrieval of these items has been made a class b priority (see priority ranking document) and teams have been dispatched to likely locations (see accompanying map below) to search for the depots. Soviet records on file, especially document 45380 (report on military installations in the Southern Urals region) and the 1938 army census have been used as the primary information sources to determine probable caches, though it it is important to note the dated nature of these sources (see addendum 1)."

 MGN.51.b: "Scavenge in the southern regions."
 MGN.51.c: "Scavenge in the central regions."
 
 MGN.52.t: "Communiqué 09.b"
 MGN.52.d: "Recent missions to Soviet caches and arsenals have uncovered some stores of military equipment, though not as much as initially estimated. Several hundred guns and a few thousand rounds of ammunition have been recovered (refer to attached unit reports at the end of this document for exact numbers and specifications) and are being sent to Magnitogorsk to be issued to the army. The primary causes of the low returns are: weather damage in exposed caches, and stolen supplies that were probably taken shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union (for list and map of breached military locations please see the attached report). Comrade Lysenko has scheduled a meeting with the officers responsible for the searches to thank them for their efforts, and has ordered a review of the predictive processes that overestimated the amount of recoverable supplies (see predictive algorithm procedures summary). The weapons that have been recovered will prove useful in keeping our field operatives well equipped in the event of an unanticipated production delay."

 MGN.53.t: "COMMUNIQUÉ 09.a"
 MGN.53.d: "Recent missions to Soviet caches and arsenals have proved extremely successful. Several hundred kilograms of various munitions (refer to pg. 15 of the attachment for exact numbers cataloged) have been cataloged and shipped back to the NKVD for repair, retool and reuse in all further outreach, containment, clearance, and retrieval missions. Comrade Lysenko has expressed his appreciation of Retrieval Team 16 (see DAILY BULLETIN 2988.d for congratulation notice) and has listed all personnel assigned to Retrieval Team 16 for the Order of the October Revolution, for awarding at a time when the Soviet Union has defeated its enemies in the present conflict (see medal handbook for supplementary information).\n\nThe various weapons will prove instrumental in all further field engagements, and numerous experimental devices have been recovered for further reproduction in processing plants."
 MGN.53.a: "COMMUNIQUÉ 09.a OVER"
 
 MGN.54.t: "A Shadow Arrives"
 MGN.54.d: "Black Mountain, the pseudo-communist pseudo-scientific state led by Trofim Lysenko has approached us. Sending a heavily armed ambassadorship in starched uniforms, they declared themselves the rightful successor to the Soviet Union's science program, a tenuous link seemingly fueled entirely by the madness of a man who does not believe the Union ever fell, and demanded that we give them a tithe of men, women and children. After inquiring why, they stated that the people would be serving the Soviet Union, their rightful government, in advancing the cause of "socialist workers everywhere, by ensuring the continued advancement of Soviet science and advancement for use against the great enemy in Germany". When further pressed to elaborate on what that actually meant, the soldiers, seemingly members of the NKVD, admitted this meant that they would be participating in 'scientific experiments' in order to make them stronger. To better fight the Germans.\n\nWhile these demands are patently ridiculous, and while any sane leader would refuse this outright, the soldiers of 'Comrade' Lysenko seem quite formidable. Still polishing the buttons on their khaki uniforms twenty years after the last order was given to do so.\n\nWe could refuse, should we choose, but are the lives of a few peasants truly worth such conflict?"
 MGN.54.a: "Just give them the people."
 MGN.54.b: "We will not let them take our children!"

 MGN.55.t: "[From.GetLeader] refused tribute."
 MGN.55.d: "CLEARANCE LEVEL: a\n\nAfter the creation of the Peaceful Subject Extraction (P.S.E) program by Comrade Lysenko, we have sent numerous large envoys equipped to proper loadouts as listed in Uniform Code 32.b (Combat Uniform C) of proper height and stature to neighboring proto-states in an effort to establish a mutually-beneficial 'tributary' system with them.

In this instance, three guards had been found organizing plans to steal and hoard supplies before they were to flee to those anarchic hovels to the west. They have been shot already of course, though their plans were extensive and seemed too ambitious for three guards. A security advisor proposed an investigation be opened into the loyalty of the NKVD, with aims to root out the disloyal elements before they could poison the entire organization. Another advisor simply stated that the NKVD could handle this themselves, saving the Central Planning Committee the effort."

Stepan Bunkov, Commanding Officer of the 22nd, ordered Comrade Lysenko to be seated and for his attendees to be thrown in shackles, the Comrade's protests were met with enforcement of Bunkov's orders by the agents. Comrade-Lieutenant-General Bunkov read out a list of accusations against Comrade Lysenko, including numerous counts of crimes against humanity and treason against the long-dead Soviet Union. In addition he listed the demands of the NKVD in order to maintain a status-quo, nigh unmeetable terms that effectively neutered Comrade Lysenko's ability to perform research or command anyone outside of his close circle.

The news of Comrade Lysenko's arrest was made public, the NKVD had valiantly removed the despot from power at great risk to their own lives, but his trial was a serious matter, the people were assured, and there could be no mistakes in gathering all the evidence. The NKVD junta had no second thoughts over Comrade Lysenko's fate, they didn't care for a beaten-out confession or to torture the creature, no matter how justified it would be. No, the NKVD simply wanted the monster gone and dead in a ditch, the thousands dead at his twisted hands would not care for any false mimicking of a trial. Indeed, his execution would be a just and noble act, perhaps the first the NKVD would perform in decades. With a brief discussion, ultimate responsibility for the execution was passed to Comrade-Commissar Smorodinskii, who gathered a firing squad within the hour.\n\nTrofim Lysenko was dragged into the cold, silent prison courtyard. He mumbled incessantly into the sack over his head, a request from the firing team who feared the deranged eyes of the monster. With little ceremony, the presiding officer quickly rattled off the crimes of Trofim Lysenko, and the punishment meted out by the Transitionary Council. When the officer finished he nodded to the five men gathered before him and granted them permission to fire. The Madman of Magnitogorsk, Trofim Lysenko, howled at hearing his fate but was brought silent as his body was rattled with five precise shots from the firing squad. One of the shooters spat in the direction of the limp corpse that hung from its post, a final farewell to the lunatic that had done so much harm to all those he encountered."

 MGN.102.t: "Armament Planning"
 MGN.102.desc: "One of the biggest weaknesses that our army has is a lack of equipment and ammunition to fight the Ural League and Orenburg Commune. This is also coupled with the fact we even have to ask the bandits of Dirlewanger's Brigade for help. That fact has been an utter embarrassment for the proud scientist. With war coming ahead, NKVD commanders along with Lysenko have come up with Armament Plan C as the newest Armament Plan alongside the highly censored plans A and B.\n\nArmament Plan C, unlike past plans, will be made known to all soldiers in order for them to work together. Plan C will ensure that every soldier within the NKVD is not only able to fire their weapons, but also to make their own weapons in order to be the best army in the Southern Urals. Every battalion will be required to work to make weapons together. Lysenko's reasoning is not only to make the best soldiers, but to make the best camaraderie and strengthen efficiency as they work together in ideal Soviet unionism.\n\nArmament Plans A and B, however, will be Lysenko's main plans which only the highest officers in the NKVD know. He has demanded that if any officers break censorship and have these plans leaked, they will be subjected to experimentation and then executed for treason after their tongues are cut out. As Lysenko sees it, everything must go according to plan, or else state morale will fall apart."
 MGN.102.a: "Plan C is the optimal choice."

 MGN.103.desc: "Change was such a fickle thing, especially in the technocratic realm of Lysenko and his entourage. Seemingly from one day to the next, the overworked and mistreated factory drones that powered the scientist's small empire saw themselves and the Soviet-era capital they were working with completely reorganized and restructured. New guidelines, rules, regulations. Away with waste, away with unnecessary breaks, away with mismanaged logistics.\n\nSudden new orders from the former NKVD guards began to work them worse than any nightmare story they had been told by their childhood bedsides of the old days of emperors and tsars. As one wave of workers was permitted to go home once their torturous shift was done, another was brought in with sullen, broken faces. The thick, cancerous smog, now never retreating from the city no matter the time of day, was beginning to have its effects too. Some wondered if this was what it felt like to be exploited by the Germans, a thought whose utterance would land you a one-way ticket to the mountain complex they all toiled for. This great restructuring of the industry that was proving to be the lifeline of his work had been conceived by the ominous technocrat who ruled almost like the great dictators of the West, moving the populace around like his little chess pieces, maximizing potential value.\n\nFrom the vast array of former scientists that Lysenko had brought with him to Magnitogorsk, a small, efficient minority had now been chosen to head the Supply Production Planning Committee. These management and industry experts were in the process of radically transforming the industrial output of the still ruined city, with its many factories and plants, with the intent that all necessary factors of production for their unbalanced economy, whether that be land, capital, or most importantly, labor, could be utilized to the utmost. Whatever they may cost, innovation and progress were the only things that concerned the former Soviet intelligentsia."

Of these two months, two weeks are to be dedicated specifically to training with advanced weaponry. This is to prevent any further incidents of improperly trained troops mishandling and damaging valuable military equipment.\n\nAll field officers are to spend an additional month being trained in how to command their soldiers in a variety of combat and non-combat situations. Topics to be covered will include leading raids, acquiring test subjects, scouting unknown territory, defending research sites, and others to be detailed in further communiqués.\n\nTest subjects who have been designated for combat training will be subjected to this new regimen as well as any ongoing experiments that they are taking part in. In the event that the requirements of an experiment conflict with part of the standard training regimen, the experiment shall take priority. This includes denying living essentials to test subjects in training, issuing prototype weapons to test subjects in training, and inducing the copulation of test subjects in training.\n\nField officers are now permitted to use capital punishment should they deem it necessary. Infractions considered deserving of capital punishment include, but are not limited to, deserting a post, disobeying the order of a superior officer, compromising the integrity of an experiment, and inspiring cowardice or disloyalty among the men.

The Ural Guard is annoyingly attempting to obstruct our research efforts by hindering acquisition teams, preventing them from retrieving the necessary test subjects. In order for our vital experimentation to continue as scheduled, this obstacle must be removed.\n\nThe 22nd Motor Rifle Division carries superior equipment compared to the Guard, but predictive exercises indicate that our force is of insufficient numbers to launch a sustained offensive against the Ural League. One possible method of augmenting the number of troops at our disposal is diplomacy. An alliance with the Dirlewanger Brigade seems the most likely solution if this route is pursued. The Brigade is highly undisciplined and unpredictable, yet they do possess numerical superiority over every other force in the region. They should have enough men at their disposal to defeat the Ural league, especially if our units are acting in support. Intelligence indicates that Dirlewanger's primary goal is to loot Orenburg, but harassment by the Ural Guard has prevented him from achieving this. The elimination of the Ural League would be mutually beneficial to our two parties.\n\nIf this course of action is not desired, there is an alternative.

He had gleefully read about his brave bandits partaking in vomit-inducing acts of degeneracy whilst on duty. Despite the constant stream of reports, Dirlewanger never ceased to find pleasure in the misery of his subjects. The Oberführer was expectant, having heard rumors of a horse-bound messenger to arrive. Suddenly, a tremendous bang echoed throughout the Oberführer's chamber, as the imposing oak doors came to rest still on the skull ridden walls. Two aging and disheveled men dressed in worn-out Waffen-SS uniforms aggressively dragged another man across the stone floor towards the 'Bandit King'.\n\nThe two men violently ceased their manhandling of the poor gentleman and moved to either side of the Bandit King's throne, in a protective stance. Clearly, they were ready to brutalize their 'guest'at a moments notice. The quivering envoy slowly rose to his feet, identifying himself as a representative of Lysenko. The envoy then exposed a neatly sealed envelope. His hands shook uncontrollably as he reached out to hand the message to Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger promptly snatched it off the envoy, causing the man to stumble back and wince in fear. The Bandit King ripped apart the envelope to expose its contents, a mere letter. Nothing but a lousy pathetic letter. Despite his unjustified rage, he began to study the contents of the letter, it was noticeably written in quite a technical dialect. He commenced reading the letter before pausing, looking over towards the envoy and grinning menacingly. Finally, Dirlewanger burst out into a deranged fit of uncontrollable laughter. The envoy looked on in astonishment at Dirlewanger, who signaled to his guards to have the man escorted out of his chambers.\n\nA few hours later, the Bandit King called a meeting of his most trusted comrades, to decide what to do with Lysenko's offer. They bickered and bantered, exchange graphic tales of rape and plunder whilst indulging in excessive blood-red wine, sipped from their tin goblets. Eventually, Lysenko's offer resurfaced in conversation. Dirlewanger's now heavily intoxicated inner circle aggressively rambled to one another over the deal. The proposal itself seemed to be positive on the surface. Lysenko offered the Dirlewanger Brigade potential access to Magnitogorsk's industrial facilities and a further promise of potential armaments and munitions supply if necessary. The debate continued well into the early hours of the morning, following further intoxication and a lengthy discussion on barbarism, Dirlewanger and his comrades eventually decided on whether to accept or reject Lysenko's offer for alliance..."

A representative of the Dirlewanger Brigade, one -REDACTED-, had been sent in an ill maintained truck, in a manner identical to our own. This behavior is noted to be due to the lack of a diplomatic history from the 'Dirlewanger Brigade'. The letter of approval from the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' was notably written in a curious manner, seemingly penned on the opposite side of Comrade Lysenko's letter. The handwriting is remarkably consistent with studies on individual performance while intoxicated. Regardless, they will be used as a tool to aid in our destruction of the Ural League.

Comrade Lysenko's letter effectively used persuasion and flattery techniques (for further information on the techniques used, pg. 52-89 on persuasion and flattery techniques in espionage handbook.) to masquerade any possible indication of current plans to abduct Oskar Dirlewanger and his band for research purposes. The 'Dirlewanger Brigade' has sent a response envoy, one known as -REDACTED- to confirm the approval of the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' in cooperating with our forces.\n\nImmediately, the envoy was told to return to Oskar Dirlewanger with a second letter, also penned by Comrade Lysenko, informing Oskar Dirlewanger on a location to have a personal meeting for what is described to be regarding the exchange of weapons and discussion of tactics, along with standards for using the technological facilities of the Black Mountain. Unknown to Oskar Dirlewanger is Comrade Lysenko's immediate order to set up positions for the quick capture and extraction of Oskar Dirlewanger and anyone he deems fit to bring with him. Probability of the successful capture of Oskar Dirlewanger in this maneuver has risen to a high 72.4%. Preparations will begin for the capture upon the distribution of this public communique."

Dirlewanger himself was lured to the venue as indicated in previous communiques. However, he has evaded capture by existing military assets on the ground, summarized in addendum 27.b.ii, and his men appear to have dispersed in methods familiar to senior military advisors. The latter observation suggests that methods of evasion are concurrent with the tactics used by Dirlewanger's Brigade veteran training techniques. Capabilities of our current operational assets in capturing Dirlewanger have fallen by 43 percent.\n\nEnvoy -REDACTED- has been liquidated as per Protocol 569E, concerning personnel with potentially compromising evidence involving classified domestic military operations. A request was personally submitted for his liquidation for failure to conduct successful diplomatic activities by the Committee.\n\nHowever, significant strategic opportunities present themselves regardless. Significant reduction in military activities and concentration in Dirlewanger's territory (see strategic report 3.c.iv) has been observed, and military assets outlined in -CLASSIFIED UNDER NKVD DIRECTIVES- are operational and ready to secure territory. In addition, efforts continue to secure Dirlewanger himself, who has an estimated 7 percent chance of surviving more than 48 hours of continuous pursuit. The Committee awaits further data."

BREAKING OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY WILL RESULT IN LIQUIDATION.\n\nThe abduction of Oskar Dirlewanger and his 'Dirlewanger Brigade' has ended in failure as per original mission parameters. Oskar Dirlewanger accepted Comrade Lysenko's proposition to personally meet for what he assumed to be strategic purposes, with Operational Team 12 preparing an ambush. Dirlewanger and twenty of his soldiers appeared in a convoy for their meeting with Comrade Lysenko. Upon arrival, suspicion was displayed as to the whereabouts of Comrade Lysenko. Comrade Lysenko did not attend due to the substantial risk involved in this operation. Regardless, Oskar Dirlewanger proceeded into the meeting place, setting himself up within a 4.2% difference of planned destination. When Dirlewanger was informed that Comrade Lysenko would not appear, he immediately began egress preparations.\n\nIt appears that Extraction Team 12 was not skillful enough to properly prepare for such an event, as the Extraction Team moved with undue haste to abduct Dirlewanger. Their movements revealed themselves at an improper time, leading to a firefight between the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' and Extraction Team 12. Seventeen of the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' members escaped, with casualties unknown at this time. Dirlewanger himself was shot in chest four times (refer to attached autopsy brief), causing Dirlewanger's death shortly after. While this will certainly lead to the collapse of the 'Dirlewanger Brigade' (refer to Assessment on Dirlewanger Brigade Stability, paragraph 3), the members of Extraction Team 12 are to be promptly liquidated for their complete failure of the mission. The escaping seventeen members have the potential to rally a revenge assault against Comrade Lysenko, and a double increase of patrols along the southwestern border are to begin."

A select few deemed worthy of preservation are transported to Lysenko for aid in his experiments.\n\nThe following week, NKVD guards track the resource exploitation abilities of civilians and begin resource maximization experiments to be carried out on the local level. Those who are incapable of meeting resource quotas are disposed of, buried in mass graves. If experiments are successful in inducing improvement, officers are rewarded with promotions. Those who fail are deemed unworthy and replaced in a manner similar to civilians.\n\nHuman capital demands unique treatment.

As an additional measure to ensure all cooperation is terminated, all members of the 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD are henceforth to refrain from engaging in any communication with any bandits associated with Dirlewanger or his subordinates. This can be overruled for specific interactions sanctioned by a Brigade commander or higher ranking officer.\n\nIt has been concluded after extended observation that the southern bandits are too undisciplined to be controlled and too unpredictable to be allowed to continue operating within the region. All Divisions will be receiving new orders in the next four days to reposition along the frontier of the bandits territory.

He then abruptly talks about himself and others in the division going through and rebuilding the facility with thousands of various materials and mentioning the number of men and the quotas made, while emphasizing the number of soldiers enough to help with their morale. Then, after briefly mentioning the history, he goes over the casualty report (heavily censored) to showcase the few losses the division suffered versus other factions such as the Ural League, with a factual (exaggerated) report on the amount of casualties they suffered. He also mentions all the equipment they have that make them the best, from their various up to date rifles (outdated, but better than most other factions' rifles) to their explosives and their few vehicles. Lysenko goes on and eventually talks about the defenses of the facility and how all the traps and various nests can stop every attack from the enemy.

 MGN.200.desc: "The Committee's findings are summarized below. For a more in depth analysis of the background of the personnel concerned and disciplinary action inflicted on their units, refer to the attached disciplinary report.\n\nWeapons and military equipment secured by NKVD personnel must be requisitioned for use in training and storage. However, it has come to our attention that violation of this rule has been more widespread than previously believed. The incident on -DATE REDACTED- involving 130 NKVD personnel, a company in strength, has shown proved our initial estimations have been wrong. A communal punishment-rehabilitation is currently being carried out in holding facilities across our controlled lands. we are confident that more incidents will be revealed to us.\n\nSoviet-era military facilities, as noted in earlier reports, have recorded reduced yields from scavenging activities. It is now clear that this is due to widespread personal acquisition of equipment on a level beyond the individual. In some cases entire stocks of explosives and ammunition, sufficient to arm a battalion for a week, have been siphoned off for personal use and profit by NKVD personnel.\n\nMost disturbing is the testimony of Private -REDACTED-, involved in the incident mentioned above, on whom disciplinary punishments were carried out concurrent with questioning. According to him, his company received explicit sanction from an officer to carry out pilfering activities. This has disconcerting implications on the decay of morale within our own ranks, and structural reforms and disciplinary actions are recommended to ensure adherence to regulations in future events.\n\nFor a list of proposed disciplinary actions, refer to addendum 1.a.viii.

Some argue that the breaking of uniformity makes us no better than the Bandits, that the NKVD stands for something greater than simple killing. Others have more pragmatic arguments, specifically that the implementation of small arms with differing specifications will make squad-based combat less coordinated, with requirements of officers to consider the ability of individual soldiers' weapons rather than the whole squad.

 MGN.300.t: "The Elimination of the Southern Obstruction"
 MGN.300.desc: "Reports of resistance from forces identifying as the Dirlewanger Brigade (a.k.a the Black Bandits) have been steadily decreasing following the total collapse of their central leadership in the face of our offensive. Since the initiation of hostilities the unorganized nature of the bandit forces made them vulnerable for well coordinated assaults (for more information see after action reports on operations l-438 and z-19). This allowed the forces of the 22nd Motor Rifle Division to halt their attempted offensives with an 82 percent success rate and launch their own counter offensives into bandit territory. Bandit resistance increased measurably as they retreated further south, in all likelihood due their increasing proximity to their power bases and centers of command. This increase in resistance peaked during the fighting around Orsk (see population center file: Orsk) the unofficial capital of the bandit territory and the site of Dirlewanger's personal headquarters. Conflict was particularly intense within the urban center, but the disorganization of the bandit forces still proved their downfall as the city was surrounded and all resistance within was isolated and eventually terminated.\n\nWith the exception of several hit-and-run raids by isolated bandit groups (see patrol reports 1235, 7532, and 0192) all resistance within the region has come to an end and order is being reestablished. Members of the bandit command have been detained and are scheduled for transport for Magnitogorsk where they will be quarantined assigned to special testing procedures (see special test subject experimentation protocol guidelines). The remaining bandit prisoners are to be held until they can be examined to determine their suitability as potential test subjects. Though heavily damaged by the bandit occupation, the industrial resources of Orsk and the surrounding region will make useful additions to our own industrial base, and reconstruction is scheduled to begin soon."
 MGN.300.a: "Understood."
 MGN.301.t: "Removal of the Western Obstruction"
 MGN.301.desc: "Despite significant initial resistance, the Ural League has been eliminated as a source of opposition within the region. Following the efforts of the Ural Guard (see opposition force information files 7 and 12) to obstruct the retrieval of testing subjects from the western population centers, their removal was deemed necessary to continue pursuing multiple vital avenues of research. Due to their advanced training (see sub file 12-1 for details on Ural Guard training regimen) and the unfavorable combat conditions of the Ural mountains (see attached elevation map) the initial offensive operation did not prove as successful as hoped, with only 48 percent of units reaching their designated targets within the opening weeks. However, the superior manufacturing base and greater manpower pool of the greater Magnitogorsk area (see most recent census documents) proved decisive, as the Ural Guard were unable to keep their forces sufficiently reinforced and resupplied in periods of extended engagement. As the conflict progressed they were forced back until eventually all significant population centers in the southern Urals were secured and the Guard lacked any functioning command structure.\n\nThe newly acquired territory is low in both population and industrialization. The capture of large numbers of former Ural Guard members has made the conflict a net gain, despite heavy losses (see casualty record filings and equipment loss reports). It has been observed that the average Guard member displays significantly higher strength, stamina, and dexterity than the average inhabitant of the region(see experiment 1961-4-i for specifics). These qualities make them ideal testing candidates for many of the most important experiments being conducted at the Black Mountain involving physical and genetic manipulation. Already approximately 12,000 former Guard members have been identified and detained for transport to testing facilities. Acquisition teams have begun searching the former territory of the Ural league, as it is probable that large numbers of Guard remain in hiding."
 MGN.301.a: "Understood."
 MGN.302.t: "Acquisition of the Southwest Population Center"
 MGN.302.desc: "Resistance within the region surrounding the city of Orenburg (see population center file: Orenburg) has been successfully terminated following the defeat of the militias within the city itself. Despite numerical superiority of opposition forces, the equipment and experience disparity between the communal militias and the 22nd Motor Rifle Division made most attempts at resisting our advance towards the city futile, with 92 percent of offensive operations succeeding in meeting 50 percent or more of initial objectives. (See report collection z-81 for reports of successful defensive actions by communal forces during the conflict). Upon approaching the city, large-scale defensive measures were encountered, including conscripted peasants and hastily constructed barricades and trench networks. These measures, while effective in slowing the offensive by 33 percent, proved insufficient to halt operations entirely; the city was secured shortly after the former government disbanded and fled. Acquisition teams have been dispatched to locate and secure prominent members of said government (see specific testing subject objective list: Orenburg).\n\nThe city is the largest population center in the region (see population estimate files pending replacement by a census), and will allow for a much greater number of testing subjects to be acquired relative to previous measures. This is expected to allow for at least a 45 percent increase in overall testing due to increased subject availability. Additionally, the manufacturing and infrastructure of the region will prove a significant asset to the production capabilities of Magnitogorsk and the southern Urals as a whole as soon as integration and redistribution programmes are completed."

Subjects were exposed to the following conditions: immersion in water at following extremes for XXXXXX on end, alternating between these for 10 sets; 66 degrees Celsius, followed by -XX degrees Celsius. Following this, the subjects were induced to run 40 meter sprints in a closed environment, and do jumping jacks in counts of 5. They were then injected with tetanus germs. Two months later, the experiment was carried out again. For the control group, no tetanus was injected.\n\nRationale: Muscle contractions and spasms are known to be great sources of strength; see attached our Medical Group's research on the phenomenon of tetanus cramps and their possible utility in our own physical experiments. It is theorized that if exposure to tetanus accompanies physical challenges, this will result in improvements to the physical capabilities of the subject due to the bacteria being induced to cooperate with physical systems while retaining its own capabilities to enhance temporary physical strength.\n\nResults: Following the 1st experiment, 2 subjects died of complications traceable to hypothermia and/or exposure to extreme temperatures. Following injection of tetanus, remaining subjects followed predicted physiological behaviors associated with early-stage as documented in medical research journals retrieved from existing research corpus, i.e. involuntary muscle cramps, paralysis, choking and so forth.

Researcher XXXXXXXX was initially shocked to find that the two subjects began to successfully answer questions that had only been asked to the other subject after only XX weeks of the process. Researcher XXXXXXX was preparing to declare success until an audit found irregularities in the actions of the two subjects. It was eventually discovered that they had somehow convinced the NKVD security guard assigned to the experiment to bring the questions from one subject to the other - he did so by listening in one room, writing down the question on a small piece of paper and then quickly passing it to the subject in the other room by slipping it under the metal door as he pretended to tie the laces of his boots. The experiment was ended, and the guard stripped of all ranks and volunteered as a research subject."

What are your findings?\n\n-REDACTED-: I do not mean to bring any alarm, but... (hesitation) upon reconsideration of what we have reclassified as inconclusive it appears as if there is a startling lack of occasions in which our hypotheses have been supported.\n\nLysenko: Are you suggesting anything, -REDACTED-?\n\n-REDACTED-: No, not at all! This is all from our own files.\n\nLysenko: Interesting. The thought that some readjustment of our physique enhancement program is needed has been lingering... (brief pause) How often have our experiments ended with fatalities?\n\n-REDACTED-: From my readings, no less than sixty percent from the sample.\n\nLysenko: Statistic noted. What if... (another pause) no... it can't be. When Columbus proposed that the Earth was a globe, they mocked and jeered at the visionary. My ideas, my great theories, they may be seen the same now, but the centuries will pass, and they will become common biological knowledge.

Declining level of combat readiness in the Brigade combined with the death of subject Dirlewanger have rendered the remaining asset unfit for combat duty. Field teams have retrieved as many brigadiers as possible for -REDACTED- type experimentation.\n\nNKVD commanders assert troop preparation of Magnitogorsk security personnel adequate for maintaining the perimeter indefinitely. War plans Eudoxia and Isaiah have been put forward as most likely methods of dealing with continued League interference. Projected losses regrettable, but within agreed upon security policy.\n\nEnemy "Ural Guard" units judged as biggest threat to continued scientific progress of Comrade Lysenko's development team. High enemy morale and projected use of advanced small units tactic make the use of well reinforced strong points crucial to bleed experienced soldiers from the opposition.

Topics to be addressed shall include the performance of our forces against the enemy, the performance of the enemy forces against our own, the overall effectiveness of our strategy and what improvements could have been implemented, and most importantly what objectives have been secured (acquisition of testing subject reserves, establishing stability within the region, successful testing of military experiments during the conflict, ect.) It has also been advised that comrade Lysenko read the report before a live audience, and his words be broadcast over radio transmitters to all who can hear.

Recommended talking points include a renewed commitment to important research topics such as guided evolution and genetic manipulation, a new safer and more prosperous future for the inhabitants of the southern Urals, a promise to rebuild the areas damaged by the fighting in a new, more efficient manner to further integration with Magnitogorsk.

All current data suggests that improvement and recovery shall continue for the foreseeable future barring any unexpected interruptions.

 MGN_NKVD_Triumphant_desc: "At the order of Comrade Lieutenant General Stepan Bunkov, the 22nd Motor Rifle Division of the NKVD has mobilized against their former master, Trofim Lysenko, and assumed control of Magnitogorsk. This puts a final end to the reign of the mad scientist and his lackeys, as the men of the NKVD have already arrested and executed most of Lysenko's entourage, setting up a new chain of command controlled entirely by men loyal to Bunkov. As a new day dawns over the Black Mountain, the inhabitants of Magnitogorsk have cheered the death of their hated former master, but as the NKVD isn't exactly well liked either, the most pessimistic among them wonder if this is really a change for the best - some even insinuate that one day they might even remember fondly the days of Comrade Lysenko..."

 MGN_NKVD_pushback_from_locals_desc: "Despite all that we have done for the villages of the Black Mountain after the fall of Lysenko it appears that they are starting to get somewhat, let's say, 'disconcerted' about our ever strengthening presence here. We should do what we can to keep them in line, lest something unfortunate were to occur to the level of security we have granted the region."

 MGN_NKVD_justice_for_dead_desc: "The body count from Lysenko's madness remains unknown and the full extent of his destruction has not been tallied.

 MGN_NKVD_rebuild_local_communities: "Rebuild Local Communities"
 MGN_NKVD_rebuild_local_communities_desc: "Thanks to Lysenko our infrastructure outside of the mountain is at best on the verge of collapse and at worst non-existent. Most of the communities affected by his reign of terror are unable to get access to clean water or lack shelter. It is no secret that because of this the locals have a sharp sense of bitterness against our rule. But there are ways to redirect this hatred to scapegoats while creating a positive impression of the 22nd. If we commit ourselves to the reconstruction of Magnitogorsk, we may be able to distance ourselves from Lysenko. Let us begin with constructing roads and rebuilding some of the smaller structures throughout Magnitogorsk."

Our citizens and comrades can finally embrace the warm and sweet tenderness of their wives - many others will be able to experience the warm laughter, innocence, and energy from their children. Never again shall we destroy the lives of those who look towards us for protection. Never again will such brutality tear apart families in Magnitogorsk. Never again shall innocents know the evil touch of Lysenko's madness."

 MGN_NKVD_peace_and_order: "Peace and Order"
 MGN_NKVD_peace_and_order_desc: "The change in management in Magnitogorsk has, predictably, caused some instability in the neighboring regions, the areas controlled by the Black Mountain. Bandit activity is on the rise, and that might become a serious problem unless we tackle it immediately. Comrade Bunkov has ordered the deployment of several NKVD units to key areas of Magnitogorsk's countryside, tasking his men to secure the region and enforce peace. We simply can't afford to have the region to slip back into anarchy and chaos, and the 22nd Motor Rifle Division of the NKVD is the only force capable of maintain peace and order around the Black Mountain."

 MGN_NKVD_intelligentsia_purges_desc: "The intelligentsia, the teachers, professors, scientists, and researchers plague our nation like bacteria in a well. They plot against our very existence while pretending to raise our youth and create our weapons. Bygones of Lysenko's corrupt technocracy, they have no place in a civilized communist society like ours. No place in destroying our political fibers and teaching our youth the ways of Social Fascism and other seditious ideologies. We must make a decision, however. Do we waste our precious resources upon exterminating this disease, or do we simply let them go free as they corrupt our children?"

 MGN_NKVD_bandit_connections: "Bandit Connections?"
 MGN_NKVD_bandit_connections_desc: "Lysenko's regime was not the totalitarian state he claimed or attempted to make Magnitogorsk. It was a nation full of corruption and holes in the wall, holes that kept the terrible spirit of banditry alive. Those in our government and among our people who benefited and associated with bandits and criminals or were bandits themselves, whether through fraternization, deserting, treason, or otherwise will not be given a spot in our government and our world. Kill them, or worse, ostracize them."

 MGN_NKVD_approved_texts: "Approved Texts?"
 MGN_NKVD_approved_texts_desc: "The literary works built by the intelligentsia and the technocrats that flourished under Lysenko do not fit into Marxist or Leninist ideals, and therefore do not fit into our society. These texts that are bound to create unrest and unsatisfaction with our noble regime must be destroyed and burned. They will be replaced with a grand new pantheon of government-approved texts. From science fiction to agricultural biology books, no genre or style will be left out of the most entertaining, informative books in Magnitogorsk. Written by the top government and people-friendly writers in Russia, no peasant will go without reading our books."

 MGN_NKVD_we_were_misguided: "We Were Misguided"
 MGN_NKVD_we_were_misguided_desc: "As the new leader of Magnitogorsk, Comrade Stepan Bunkov has issued an official statement, broadcasted by radio to the whole region. With a clear voice, he began to denounce Lysenko's crimes, while at the same time explaining the reasoning that brought him and his men to support him at first, before removing him from power. The pursuit of the NKVD was noble, Bunkov said, as they were convinced they'd aid the cause of science, progress, and socialism - however, Lysenko, a traitorous dog who went mad with power, turned the endeavors of his scientists and soldiers against the people, in vile crimes against the people of Russia and the communist cause. Bunkov closed his statement by announcing that his rule would be first and foremost devoted to mending the wounds caused by Lysenko's heinous actions, and to restoring prosperity and peace to Magnitogorsk."

 MGN_NKVD_new_dawn: "New Dawn"
 MGN_NKVD_new_dawn_desc: "In the eyes of our neighbors and even of our own people, our image is, to say the least, tainted. After all, it was men of the NKVD who stormed villages and hamlets at night, stealing away people, never to be seen again. For this reason, if we hope to maintain a peaceful and stable rule over the region, we must convince everyone that we do not intend to follow Lysenko's footsteps. Our rule will be just, fair, benevolent - we saved Magnitogorsk from Lysenko. We are the protectors of the people, of the proletariat and of the communist cause in the Southern Urals - we carry on the torch of Lenin and Bukharin in the struggle for freedom, equality and peace for all. A new dawn rises on the Black Mountain, and Comrade Bunkov wants everyone to see the red light."

 MGN_NKVD_elimnate_bad_science: "Rid the Mountain of Heinous Science"
 MGN_NKVD_elimnate_bad_science_desc: "In every dark corner of the Black Mountain, monstrosities wait in the darkness, heinous crimes against mankind. Horrendous experimental machines that resemble torture devices, parts and remnants of human beings hideously deformed and mangled by Lysenko's inhuman experiments, entire archives filled with data and methodologies that beggar human belief. This stain will weigh upon Bunkov's new government as long as any trace of Magnitogorsk's vile recent past exist. Officers of the NKVD have received the order to collect and burn the vast majority of Lysenko's disgusting creations, turning them into nothing but ash and smoke. If the people of Magnitogorsk hope to build a new future for themselves, then they must deal with Lysenko's legacy, and this is the first step in doing so."

 MGN_NKVD_liberate_test_subjects: "Liberate the Test Subjects"
 MGN_NKVD_liberate_test_subjects_desc: "The bowels of Magnitogorsk still echo with the cries of innumerable captives, prisoners and test subjects, captives to Lysenko's foul pseudoscience. In many cases, these men, women and children have been kept locked up in dark, cramped cells with poor hygienic conditions, scarce food and brutal treatment. Now that Lysenko has been dealt with, we must free the poor souls imprisoned in the Black Mountain, providing them with the medical assistance they deserve and preparing to deliver them back to their home. No more shall the Black Mountain be a prison of the innocent; no more shall our hands be stained with their suffering."

 MGN_NKVD_constructive_science: "Constructive Science"
 MGN_NKVD_constructive_science_desc: "Although Lysenko's project was rotten to the core, that does not mean that there can be nothing that can be salvaged from it. Some of his experiments could provide us with some genuinely useful insights that can improve the lives of our people, although some of them were obtained with methods best left undescribed. At the same time, many of the scientists who worked with him were neither mad nor evil, and would be more than willing to resume their activities without having to answer to a madman. Comrade Bunkov has formed a small pool of scientists tasked with recovering the "clean" parts of Lysenko's projects, putting them into service for the people of Magnitogorsk."

 MGN_NKVD_benevolent_rule: "Benevolent Rule"
 MGN_NKVD_benevolent_rule_desc: "As another round of purging Lysenko supporters is finally over, their corpses already incinerated in the blast furnaces of the Black Mountain, it seems that the situation in Magnitogorsk has finally stabilized and Bunkov's grip on the region is now fully established. As men of the NKVD patrol the industrial facilities and the outlying villages, with soldiers and trucks moving back and forth to discourage banditry, our commissars' reports are starting to come in from the population. While many are glad that Lysenko is gone, there are others who don't fully trust us. It seems that some subversive elements are even openly agitating against us. They may even be potentially planning an insurrection against us. While few of these reports can be confirmed, we should still keep a close eye on our own people, unless we want the situation spiraling out of control."

 MGN_NKVD_bring_back_lists: "Bring Back the Lists?"
 MGN_NKVD_bring_back_lists_desc: "Currently, the Black Mountain's archives hold a wealth of extremely detailed information regarding the vast majority of anyone who has ever lived in Magnitogorsk in recent years, collected under Lysenko's orders for experimental and surveillance purpose. With our grip on the state threatening to become weaker, we could easily create a very pervasive network of surveillance and control of our population using the data collected in the archives as a starting point. Some in the NKVD command have argued that such a measure would be unethical and would a step back towards the reign of Lysenko - but it could be necessary to provide our people with the protection they so desperately need..."

 MGN_NKVD_spies_in_communities: "Spies in the Communities?"
 MGN_NKVD_spies_in_communities_desc: "The largest threat to stability and peace in Magnitogorsk is not located on the Black Mountain itself, where our forces are concentrated, but in the outlying villages and towns. The workers and peasants living there have often shown to resent our rule, and in many cases would rather opt for independence or autonomy. Infiltrating spies and agents of the NKVD into such communities would provide us with eyes and ears on the ground, granting us the ability to react to dissent before it becomes a problem. While this move could be helpful, it could easily backfire, since if our spies are discovered the population will not take this kindly."

 MGN_NKVD_village_commissars: "Village Commissars?"
 MGN_NKVD_village_commissars_desc: "The government of the territories surrounding Magnitogorsk is, at present, somewhat disorganized. Several of Bunkov's advisors have proposed setting up a network of local political commissars stationed in villages and hamlets under our rule, appointed by central command. They will act as representatives of our authority over all of our territory, and will be provided with all the resources and men they need to ensure peace, security and stability in their assigned jurisdiction. However, the villagers and peasants are likely to resent this further layer of bureaucratization and centralization, and there's a few of Bunkov's close officers who feel that leaving the communities a degree of autonomy would be in our best interests."

 MGN_NKVD_remind_them_about_lysenko: "Remind Them of Their Savior"
 MGN_NKVD_remind_them_about_lysenko_desc: "For years, Black Mountain created atrocities and committed cruelties beyond the wildest dreams of even the Black Bandit. After the collapse of the mad scientist, we have filled the power vacuum his collapse left and gave the residents of Magnitogorsk a peaceful life. Lysenko's collapse was instigated by his cruelty towards his subjects, and after we liberated his poor lab rats, they showed us nothing but contempt, biting the hand that fed them. We will remind them of why we are here. Expeditions into Lysenko's old lair will be carried out in order to remind them what they escaped a fortnight ago. Fear will keep the local population in line, fear of the Black Mountain. Dissected peasants will be publicly displayed, grisly experiments paraded through squared, and Lysenko's diaries will be read out for the whole world to hear. The horrors of Black Mountain will be remembered for generations, and more importantly, who was there to save the survivors."

 MGN_NKVD_remind_them_about_bandits: "Remind Them of the Bandits"
 MGN_NKVD_remind_them_about_bandits_desc: "The shield of the NKVD does not only shield the people of Magnitogorsk from the atrocities of Black Mountain, but from the unknown terrors of those that lie beyond our borders. The ghost of Lysenko will not harm them anymore, we have seen to that. The very real, and very present danger are bandits. Our guns will smash the raiders and our bayonets will pierce their rotten heart. When the people's fields will be salted, their sons' skulls crushed, and their daughters enslaved, we will be the ones who will stand firm to defend them. If they couldn't defend themselves from Lysenko, what chance do they hold against the monsters to the south? Perhaps, the mind of a man is forgetful and needs to be reminded of the past, and grounded in reality. The people must acknowledge our role in their survival and security, through love or through fear."

 MGN_NKVD_league_connections: "League Connections?"
 MGN_NKVD_league_connections_desc: "From the other side of the Urals, the League is a constant threat to the survival of Magnitogorsk, while we trust the power of the 22nd to defend the common people, we don't trust the common people to support the 22nd. In order to defend our territory effectively we must evaluate our people's loyalty. How can our people expect us to just sit there while Uralic parasites roam our streets freely? Magnitogorsk will know that we do not tolerate betrayal."

 MGN_NKVD_remind_them_about_duty: "Remind Them of Their Duty"
 MGN_NKVD_remind_them_about_duty_desc: "Despite our greatest effort, the people wouldn't embrace us. We cannot sustain our rule without cooperation and support. This is not a matter of stability, this is a matter of our very own survival. We might have rescued them from the horrors of Lysenko and the bloodshed of the bandits, but we didn't rescue them from themselves. We conquered the Black Mountain, and now we will conquer the people's spirit. And for that, we need to reevaluate our craft."

 MGN_NKVD_mass_propaganda: "Mass Propaganda?"
 MGN_NKVD_mass_propaganda_desc: "Our issue was neither the attitude of our subject, nor rogue elements within our society. The true issue was our unwillingness to truly commit to our cause. In order to truly express our good intentions to our people we must extend our propaganda, and support the morale of the people. The workers, peasants and farmers will come together under the Black Mountain."

 MGN_NKVD_science: "NKVD Science"
 MGN_NKVD_science_desc: "The pseudo-science cult built by Lysenko poisoned the people of Magnitogorsk and wasted valuable resources and manpower on cruel experiments that achieved nothing. Worse yet, hundreds of men, women, and children were taken from their villages in the name of intellectualism. The NKVD and Bunkov soundly reject these heinous crimes against our people! Our new, "Rehabilitated Science" will continue searching for the secrets of the universe and the secrets of humankind, but in a way that is safe, ethically sound, and not based on false assumptions. True intellectualism will be revived under the glorious rule of Bunkov!"

 MGN_NKVD_centralize_authority: "Centralize Authority"
 MGN_NKVD_centralize_authority_desc: "The most important government reform yet to be achieved is a massive push for centralization across Magnitogorsk. The NKVD's current government is weak, as regional leaders often spearhead true government reform instead of our central government lead by Bunkov. When these centralization reforms are over, the entire government apparatus will be based around the decisions of one man and one group. Bunkov and the NKVD."

 MGN_NKVD_cult_of_bunkov: "The Cult of Bunkov"
 MGN_NKVD_cult_of_bunkov_desc: "Stepan Bunkov, the hero of Black Mountain, has given us everything we have. As Bunkov climbed the black mountain he pulled all of us with him, and the prosperity we now have is only here because of the guiding hand of Bunkov. Does the peasant think he could have toiled his fields without Bunkov? Does the soldier think he could have defended his family without Bunkov? Our only way of surviving in the harsh environment of Russia is to join together under the guidance and care of our leader, and we love him for that. We will help the people love Bunkov as much as we do at any cost, through the words on our papers, or through the barrel of our guns."

 MGN_NKVD_portrait_in_every_home: "A Portrait in Every Home"
 MGN_NKVD_portrait_in_every_home_desc: "Maintaining a connection with the leader is essential in order to lead a well-functioning life. People need to remember their place in their relationship with the leader and the gratitude they have for him, they need to feel their leader's presence in all aspects of their being, and they need to feel his warm gaze in every moment of their life. We will help them feel, and we will help them understand the true meaning of loyalty and love. After all, why wouldn't you want to see your leader every day? Do you dislike your leader?"

 MGN_NKVD_cult_of_commissar: "The Cult of the Commissar"
 MGN_NKVD_cult_of_commissar_desc: "Since its creation in 1917, when the throes of Red October still shook Russia, the NKVD has been the first line of defense of the Russian proletariat against class traitors, enemies of the people, counterrevolutionaries and other such dangerous threats. Even after the disaster of the Patriotic War, we men of the NKVD are still holding the line here, in Magnitogorsk, protecting the population against all those who might harm them. All should salute and cheer the men of the NKVD as they march, for they are the true heroes of the Black Mountain - may their glorious colors fly ever more proudly!"

 MGN_NKVD_venerate_NKVD: "Venerate the NKVD"
 MGN_NKVD_venerate_NKVD_desc: ""NKVD" stands for "People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs" - we are an organization of the people, and we work for the people. Our rule is justified by the fact that we do not rule in the name of impersonal ideologies or grand projects - we rule for the cause of communism, the cause of the people, and the people must always be exalted above all. We should always make it clear the Magnitogorsk is a state fashioned by Lenin's ideals, the same ideals of freedom, justice and equality for all, that we hold dear today."

 MGN_NKVD_no_cult: "There Will Be No Cult"
 MGN_NKVD_no_cult_desc: "The NKVD commissars are more than simple military and bureaucratic officers - they should be a source of inspiration for all. Their devotion to the socialist cause and to peace, progress and stability should be admired by everyone, and similarly, everyone should know that when commissars are forced to interrogate, detain or even execute people it is only for the greater good of the Revolution, and to eradicate enemies of the people and traitors to the State. We shall foster admiration and reverence for our brave commissars among the people, and make sure that everyone is constantly reminded of their patriotic duty towards them and the NKVD."

 MGN_NKVD_exalt_peasants: "Exalt the Peasants"
 MGN_NKVD_exalt_peasants_desc: "All things considered, we simply can't blame the workers, peasants and families of Magnitogorsk for not being too enthusiastic about our government, considering our role in Lysenko's regime. However, we are confident that soon, they will come on their own to the realization that we are working for their sake and for their sake alone - silently and without much pomp, the men of the NKVD will watch over them and protect them. In time, the NKVD will regain all the respect and admiration it deserves - the same respect and admiration we had lost in collaborating with Lysenko's evil schemes."

 MGN_NKVD_are_we_the_baddies: "Are We a Cancer?"
 MGN_NKVD_are_we_the_baddies_desc: "We still don't know if we've won the hearts of our people, even though our efforts were many. Some in the NKVD command are starting to suggest that this simply doesn't matter - if they do not want to love us, then let them hate us. Our mission, our duty towards Russia and towards communism, goes above the appreciation (or lack thereof) of uneducated peasants and half-drunk workers. Yet, there are still many idealists who insist that it is for their sake that we must endure in our struggle. As Comrade Lieutenant Bunkov retreated into his room this evening, he took a long time to ponder about what is to be done..."

 MGN_NKVD_A_Beacon_of_Progress_desc: "Now that the worst of the storm has passed, with the remnants of Lysenko's regime reduced into ashes, it is time for us to look outwards. Comrade Bunkov, alongside his most trusted officers, has decided to draw up plans for restoring peace, stability and prosperity to the whole region in order to further advance the communist cause. It is imperative that we deal with the bandits currently scourging the region once and for all, while attempting to entertain diplomatic relationships with Orenburg and the Ural League. Once the whole region is under our protective wing, we might even be able to look outwards."

 MGN_NKVD_Consolidate_Our_Gains: "Consolidate Our Gains"
 MGN_NKVD_Consolidate_Our_Gains_desc: "We have established ourselves firmly as one of the major powers of the Southern Urals, but our position is still far from being secure. We still don't know how much we can rely on the villages and communities that lie within our borders - some of our territories are still vulnerable to bandit raids and incursions - and although Lysenko's cabal of deranged scientists and technocrats has been dismantled, some of them might still be lurking in the shadows of the Black Mountain. If we do not consolidate our position now, all of our future efforts might be in vain."

 MGN_NKVD_the_villages_trust_us: "The Villages Trust Us"
 MGN_NKVD_the_villages_trust_us_desc: "The night has been dark and wrought with fear for so long, and while to many around Magnitogorsk the NKVD is not truly a sunrise, it at least represents a few rays of light in the gloom. The terrorized commoners around the Black Mountain would have accepted essentially anyone over the mad scientist Lysenko, probably even Adolf Hitler himself, and so the NKVD is far from the worst they could have asked for. While the villages may not be happy with NKVD rule, they more or less trust their new rulers, and believe that at the very least these people will refrain from kidnapping them under the cover of darkness and will do their best to protect them."

 MGN_NKVD_the_traitors_fear_us: "The Traitors Fear Us"
 MGN_NKVD_the_traitors_fear_us_desc: "We have seized the day! Lysenko and his men have been driven from the mountain once and for all. Fireteams are mopping up the remains and rooting out any lingering resistance. For so long the Black Mountain has been a monument to mankind's sins, but no longer. A full purge is in order, and the traitors who supported the mad scientist will be treated as they treated us."

 MGN_NKVD_the_urals_respect_us: "The Urals Respect Us"
 MGN_NKVD_the_urals_respect_us_desc: "As the chaos of the coup dies down and order begins to return to Magnitogorsk, it appears that our neighbors are finally accepting that the technocrats are gone for good and the NKVD has achieved full control of the Black Mountain. With the chances of a counter-coup diminishing by the hour, the local powers of the southern Urals have reached out, some in the interest of normalizing or re establishing diplomatic relations, others just to inform us that Magnitogorsk will still be destroyed, regardless of who is running the show. In either case, this informal international recognition can help us solidify our legitimacy and secure our rule."

 MGN_NKVD_the_dirlewanger_issue_desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger must die. He and his Black Brigade have been nothing but a curse since he escaped the jaws of death in the West Russian War. He and his Brigade have done nothing but kill, maim, rape, and pillage their way across the motherland sinec their arrival. Oskar is the black stain of Nazism personified, inflicting a plague across the scattered and scared Russian people The Urals have suffered blow after blow with each attack going unquestioned and unanswered. If we are to ensure justice is done, we must finish what the Nazis tried to do so many years ago. In the name of God Almighty, the Soviet Union, and the Human Race, we must kill Oskar Dirlewanger."

 MGN_NKVD_an_unexpected_ally_desc: "The Orenburg Communes are a disorganized, intentionally anarchic mess of a nation lacking anything resembling a central authority. However, they remain dedicated to the Revolution and the liberation of the proletariat, and in this way they are our ideological brethren. We also share common adversaries in the authoritarian reactionaries of the Ural League and the deranged sadists that follow Dirlewanger. Perhaps the Communes would be open to an agreement of mutual protection to safeguard the revolutionary cause in the Southern Urals. After all, as the Internationale says, we will live together or we shall die alone."

With a fellow Marxist-Leninist in control of the city, it is only natural that we should seek to ally with him, in order to ensure the whole region can be set on the path of progress, and that the counter-revolutionary forces may be defeated for good. However, we must remain ever so wary. As we all know, ideology is a fickle thing, and we can yet put our full trust in Malenkov."

Thankfully, we are not the only people he has chosen to incite: he has long been a pestilence on our brave comrades in Orenburg. Feeble-minded as he may be, Malenkov nevertheless should be able to comprehend just how much of a threat the Brigade is to the continued survival of socialist thought in the Urals. It is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\n\nA group of ambassadors have been sent to Orenburg to negotiate with Malenkov and his underlings directly, hoping to draft some kind of official strategy as to how we will both work to contain and eliminate the Black Brigade. Negotiations, however, have been slow-going. Malenkov agrees that the Bandit King of the Urals needs to be dealt with at some point in the future, but he has been reluctant to fully surrender strategic control or give command primacy to NKVD troops in the field. He is an idiot in many regards, but at least he is smart enough to guard what power and sovereignty he has. We must be content with vague promises and empty handshakes for now, and focus more on finding ways to fully alleviate Malenkov's doubts about us."

It is highly likely that the bandits are intercepting radio communications in the whole region, and we simply cannot risk them becoming informed about our defensive plans and the locations of our troops and fortifications.

 MGN_NKVD.1001.desc: "It is evening when the NKVD Guards squad finish their work in another village. They know what they are doing is just; taking census results for healthcare and rehabilitation, and promoting local grassroots movements, is a perfectly innocent agenda. Never mind the sullen faces, the whispered remarks, the gnawing fear on the face of anyone, adult or child, who gets close to the Guard. The Revolution is not always welcomed, but it has always been necessary, at least in their eyes.\n\nThe squad gathers its men, pools information, and prepares the necessary material; the report to Central Command will be expected to be of a certain caliber, or there will be... consequences best left unspoken. After all, Lysenko's death didn't dissolve army discipline.\n\nA shot goes off in the night. The squad members look around in panic, all save one - their leader, who falls in the dirt. The squad, tired, ill-equipped, disoriented, makes what is referred to as an "improper command/autonomy decision". Shots ring out in volleys, punctuated by shouts, screams, some of children.\n\nBy the time the squad hurries out of the ruins the next morning, there is no evidence that the village - and all 246 civilians in it - was ever there, save in the endless lists in faraway Black Mountain. And even those are easily purged."

Hence, Bunkov, like the socialist comrade he is, has decreed that our rule will be characterized by healing the wounds Lysenko had driven into Black Mountain, physical and spiritual alike, and uniting us as a society against our enemies. All who fear us tremble, but many must be given reason to love us instead. Consolidation in this front will boost our legitimacy - we are a recent regime, after all, and our hold could easily slip if the villages so chose\n\nFor now, the issue of the Bandit King wearing the uniform of the fascist and the smile of the jackal confronts us.

That means we have done our job. We can only survive if our enemies fear our every move, if they constantly look over their shoulder, and if they realize that they have no place to hide. Our rule is terrible because it must be; we have no other options. If the idealist democrats protest at this, then so be it; let our enemies subvert us. But we are not interested in losing to bandits and reactionaries.\n\nNKVD shall act as the shield against the arrows thrown at Russia. She is at her weakest, and we must do everything to save her.

They want some sort of compensation for these awful things.\n\nThe value of the lives lost is incalculable, but the people demand we calculate it all the same and give back to those who have been affected. Grieving wives and husbands, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, they have united and put forward several official requests for various forms of compensation.

The people who remained struggled to survive with most of their able-bodied laborers abducted and vanished forever into the labs, and supplies of food, medicine and other essentials remained chronically low as a result.\n\nHoping to show the people that they were on their side, an NKVD squadron visited a village living in the shadow of the mountain earlier today. They brought with them packs of pre-war medicine, tinned goods, assorted clothes and other supplies that would help the traumatized village to rebuild itself after so much horror. With the hope of a new beginning for the troubled region, the soldiers approached the outskirts of the settlement slowly and with their weapons holstered. As they reached the outskirts, the commanding officer called out to the people "NKVD, we are here to help!"\n\nThe crack of a gunshot broke the quiet as a bullet narrowly whizzed past the head of one of the men. A small but extraordinarily angry mob of residents began to emerge from the town, hurling abuse at the soldiers. They called them monsters and collaborators with Lysenko, and demanded to know what had happened to their loved ones. The commanding officer desperately attempted to calm the crowd, until a second shot caught him in the shoulder.\n\nLosing their nerve, some of the other soldiers drew their weapons and began firing warning shots over the crowd. The assembled mob quickly dispersed in panic, but the assorted gunmen in their hiding places began to pick up their assault. Through pain-gritted teeth, the commander ordered his men to fall back.

The boy struggled to make his way through the breadline that, like a long snake of people chattering, coiled around a building - at a corner, a uniformed guard holding a rifle broke up a fight between two drunkards. Kirill waved to a girl he recognized, who smiled at him while holding her coughing mother's hand. The building used to be a storehouse for industrial materials - after the NKVD took control of the Black Mountain, it became a centre for distribution of food and medicines to the people who couldn't afford it. The walls were now adorned by the hammer, the sickle and the sword of the NKVD soldiers' uniform. Kirill crossed the street and turned left, passing by two soldiers laughing and smoking cigarettes. Behind them, a freshly glued poster picturing Bunkov watched over them; the solders didn't seem to mind the silent observer. Finally, Kirill walked along the footpath before reaching his home. He knocked and was greeted by his mother and little sister. Just a few metres ahead, a soldier standing on a watchtower turned to look at them, before sighing, adjusting his blue cap and going back to look towards the sunset.\nThe sun would dawn again, and another soldier would still be there, on the watchtower - and when the sun would fall again, someone else, still wearing the same uniform, would still be standing on that watchtower, observing Kirill returning home after school. Being watched by the NKVD is something the people of Magnitogorsk are getting used to, and soon enough living under their watchful eye became a habit. In time, most would never have experienced life without frequent visits from commissars and soldiers. Still, some say that it doesn't have to be like this, that it shouldn't be like this - but those who say such things too carelessly usually don't last very long."

While defenses are necessary to our survival, especially in Russia, there is a point where they devolve into mad paranoia. Soldiers of the NKVD are forces to walk down the mountain in complicated serpentine patterns to avoid landmines or stake filled pits, and navigating the deeper recesses of the mountain require us to trace our route with string like the Theseus of legend, lest we get lost in the purposefully winding labyrinth of the structure.\n\nDemolition and dismantlement has begun, with engineer teams carefully trying their best to ensure the safety of every man who dares walk down the mountainous slopes or steps out of his barracks to relieve himself.\n\nAlready, six have died in the efforts. Either from poorly constructed traps and explosive devices releasing and detonating at the slightest touch, or by stumbling upon traps that had been long lost to record. Several traps seem to have even be constructed at some point by those outside of the NKVD, and without our knowledge, seemingly built explicitly to kill any poor fool chosen to disarm others.\n\nProgress is slow, but it is sure.

A missed detail - no, censured hastily. The name looks familiar. Here a vowel, there a consonant. He fits what he can together. It sounds like an old friend of his. And he realizes -\n\nNothing.

Being one of the oldest men in the 22nd, he had been proudly serving since the organization's formation, and even before that in the OGPU. He had seen the Union's glorious rise and marched with it even after its ignoble fall. He had seen the best and the worst of humanity, and now he wondered on which side of that spectrum he stood on.\n\nThey had served evil, he knew that, they all did. But unlike those young men who looked up to him, he did not pretend as if it was Lysenko who had made them the monsters. He had personally shoved men into the back of trucks to send them to gulags, shot prisoners as a part of some grand political game, and had looked away as Lysenko and his cronies stuck children with all manners of pricks and needles. He had served for over thirty years, but he did not know if he could be proud of that anymore. Was there a part of him anymore that truly believed they could become better? A part that-\n\n"Deda!", he heard a voice behind him laugh. "Old man, we're all heading in for a game of cards, your shift is over. Are you coming?"

The platoon's role was to visit local villages that were previously raided in search of test subjects for Lysenko's pseudo-scientific experiments and lend their people a hand, inform them that the NKVD is their friend.\n\nCommissar Georgy ordered his men to dismount from their ZIS-5 truck and proceed on foot through the village handling leaflets to the population. When the platoon was in the middle of their task they were hit with heavy rifle fire coming from all directions, the Chekist shot back but soon it was clear that the situation was unsustainable and a retreat was ordered, the village narrow streets become a trap, turning the soldiers into easy prey and leaving most of the platoon dead before they could leave.\n\nCommissar Georgy reached for the Maxim machine gun installed back of the truck, just like the Tachankas of old, and started firing at the attackers that were mowing down his men, he hoped that he could at least save a few of them but it was soon clear that those who were not killed in the streets were getting shot running on fields, when his last round of ammunition was spent he knew that he could only save himself. Taking opportunity from a break in the fire coming from the village, he tried to get the truck running but the old machine wouldn't start, and slowly people from the village started gathering around it.\n\nThe commissar got out of the vehicle and desperately started talking with one of the men "Listen Comrade, I am a commissar of the NKVD, we are here to help you, here take this..." and gave the man his canteen.\n\nThe Commissar's body was soon found hanging from a tree with a sign that read "He will never take our sons again"."

While this has yet to result in any partisan action or violence against our men, having little local support is somewhat worrying.

He was reminded of mornings learning how to hunt with his father, and Christmas mornings playing outside in the snow with his sister. But now, on this sunny, idyllic day, he was being hunted like the rabbits he ate. Out of the corner of his right ear, he heard the shot of a handgun, and then a scream. Then, to his left. Another shot and another scream. His hand shook so much as to drop the old revolver he held in it. He would not go silent into that good night. Back in the years before the war, his loving father had been taken by the NVKD. He would not fall to the same fate. His own bullets would go into his own brain before he let himself surrender to those mongrels.\n\nIt had all begun when a beggar on the street threw to him a small booklet. What he had expected to be a little pamphlet calling for prayer was a scathing criticism and expose on the nature of the new NKVD ruled government. It must have been intended for another man, a braver man. But the man who hid in the thorn bushes was intrigued. He stayed up reading it all, the little booklet printed on thin paper and held together by flimsy rings. Then, he hid it as deep as he could under his bed.\n\nThe next thing the man knew, he had become a member of a small resistance group. Fighting for the freedom of his settlement and from the tyrannical government that lorded over him, he distributed leaflets, set traps, and generally undermined authority. Everything seemed to be looking up, until the ambush began.\n\nNow, the man's friends and comrades were dead, and he had reverted to his cowardliness. His last thoughts were not of desire for freedom, but of his own failure."

 MGN_NKVD.1055.desc: "As we have already ascertained for the short time we were given to rule over Magnitogorsk, the common folk of Russia grew tired of the tyranny imposed on them by anti-Soviet extremists and megalomaniacs for more than two decades. It became especially clear during the times when Lysenko waged an open war against his own people for his anti-humane experiments. Even though Lysenko is gone, the people are still reluctant to obey the governmental orders and continue to regard any state interference as an act of violence towards them.\n\nIt is clear that in such situation we can't afford to rely on terror and coercion as measures to keep the population in line with our order, as long as the memory of Lysenko's nightmare is still fresh in memory. Thereby, we give to the residents of Magnitogorsk all liberties they need but were deprived of for so long a time. We won't allow the situation in the countryside to ever fall to the anarchy of the past as long as we stand, and we shall not interfere with their lives as long as they faithfully perform their duties and do not stand against us. Seeing our benevolent nature and convincing themselves in our well-meaning intentions, the population of Magnitogorsk will cease its attempts to topple our rule and will be dutifully working for the good of their new nation.\n\nWithout a glance at the lands of milk and honey of Orenburg or the safety of the League, they instead will be laboring to build a better future here, around the Black Mountain. Given with necessary freedoms, the people will grow to respect the governmental institutions that they themselves have created, and will rebuild the society shattered during the reign of Lysenko."

During the operation, some of our men reportedly engaged in excessive displays of violence, and acted in ways unbecoming of an NKVD soldier.

In every settlement, from the hamlets of the countryside to the cities on the riverbanks, small groups plot against the government. Most agree this is because of an easing of restrictions on civilian populations, and some suggest not letting the peasants roam so freely. Reintroducing lists that would state civilian names and would serve to limit freedom of movement within our territory and generally restrict civilian life to those on a list. While some urge strongly against a return to Lysenko's insane tyranny, others state that to maintain the safety of not just the leadership, but the civilians, these restrictions must be put into place. The upside about these lists is that we could use remaining infrastructure from Lysenko's reign, and introducing them would be of low cost. Still, such a great recession in civil liberties will not be popular among most."

They would find themselves far better off under a higher power, a unifying power, a power such as ours. Such a heavy burden falls onto our weary shoulders, consolidating Orenburg will be long and arduous task. However, there are multiple ways in which we could control the communes apart from a direct annexation. The first and easiest option, as well as the one the communes will be more likely accept, is honoring the strength of our alliance by culminating our diplomatic relations into a friendship agreement. The other is offering the communes autonomy within our greater state and letting them keep their anarchist lifestyle in their settlements in exchange for troops and taxes. The second option is better for us, it would mean not having to deal with the problems of annexation and would provide more benefits than a friendship agreement. Of course, the Workers Council will not be so welcoming of this request, our move being too similar to the one the one many had warned the Guards would take. We have a choice, annexation, limited autonomy or seeking to better relations, I hope you will choose correctly, sir."

As Bunkov's personal little politburo crowded around him with their pathetic, arse licking faces, giving him banal advice and recommendations of how to proceed from here, he was lost in deep thought. This agreement could pave the way for the downtrodden people of Orenburg and Magnitogorsk to finally live better lives, utilizing the heavy industry of his realm and the commercial industry of the Urals cornucopia to forge a common future of socialist solidarity. Finally, the Russian people would be able to show the German swine, who still sometimes fly overhead in their metallic monsters, that they could live a prosperous and peaceful life despite their differences. The noisy din of the politburo dragged him back to a reality where he still however had to work for this dream, at least it was not an impossibility anymore.

One such way is through instituting a list of approved texts that are cleared for the locals to read (if they can even read in the first place).

To ensure that the local population becomes and remains 'well-read', it seems that it will be necessary to get rid of all these unsavory and frankly barbaric texts and replacing them with only high quality, NKVD approved masterpieces of literature. After all, any and all traces of Lysenkoism in the system must be destroyed to ensure that nothing like him ever comes out from the depths of hell.

 MGN_NKVD.1077.desc: "The threat posed by Dirlewanger's brigade is enormous; an insane group of lunatics more unhinged then even our previous dictator is something rarely found. If we sit still any longer without taking action towards the existential threat posed by those fascists, we risk perishing ourselves. Therefore, it is imperative that we take action as soon as possible to repel, or, more optimistically, destroy Dirlewanger and his Nazi bandits. The high command has discussed a number of battle plans that have been constructed in an effort to settle on one military action that can be taken, even seeking a possible alliance with our neighbors to deal with the issue. Currently, a strong spearhead into the chief camp of the Brigade seems to be the optimal option, but even something like this could fail in the face of Dirlewanger's hardy bandits. For now, we can do nothing but wait and plan as fascist rats fester on our borders."
 MGN_NKVD.1077.a: "Our time will be coming soon..."
 
 MGN_NKVD.1078.t: "The Enemy Of Our Enemy"
 MGN_NKVD.1078.desc: "The 22nd motor division might be one of the strongest professional army divisions left in the former Soviet Union, but to face down the accursed Dirlewanger brigade it might not be enough. We lack the manpower to both defend Magnitogorsk itself from a possible invasion by the Germans and their pet Russians and also deploy men in the field to defeat the Brigade decisively.\nIn the west stands the loose confederation of communes centered onto Orenburg city. The local don't stack up very well to a proper army, or even to veteran bandits like Dirlewangers men, but the communal militias are certainly numerous and quite desperate. If we could ally with even a fraction of the communes we would have the men to cut off any easy path of retreat west of the Ural to Dirlewanger. If the city of Orenburg itself was to join other communes in an alliance with us, the combination of our army with Orenburg's guard and a bunch of smaller militias could be just enough men on the ground to defeat the black brigade.\nAs the Ural League has learned to its frustrations, the people of Orenburg are skeptical of centralized groups in general, especially a well armed one such as ourselves. Negotiations to get them to fight with us will be difficult...But Magnitogorsk is not without a certain quantity of resources that various factions and political groups in Orenburg city covet. A deal might still happen if we play our cards right."
 MGN_NKVD.1078.a: "Let's see what these anarchists have to offer us."
 
 MGN_NKVD.1079.t: "Our Friend Malenkov"
 MGN_NKVD.1079.desc: "It seems that we are not as alone in the Urals as we once thought ourselves to be. Georgy Malenkov, a politician of prominence back in the days of Bukharin, has come to power as the premier of Orenburg, and it seems that he is of a far more centralized mindset than his comrades. While hardly a great luminary of the Soviet era, he can nonetheless be of great use to us as an ally. And seeing how we are surrounded by degenerates and counter-revolutionaries on all sides, we will need all the help we can possibly get, so we cannot afford to be too selective.\n\nPreliminary ambassadors have already been sent, and discussions have begun concerning things like military equipment and material that we could generously donate to them. They seem to be receptive to the idea, though it very well might be that they're simply desperate for whatever firepower they can get their greedy little hands on. But what other choice do we have to win them over?"
 MGN_NKVD.1079.a: "They have chosen the right person."
 
 MGN_NKVD.1090.t: "The Traitor Burba"
 MGN_NKVD.1090.desc: "Aleksander Burba was not the man we wanted in charge of the Orenburg Communes. He does not believe in Communist values, nor is he aligned with the interests of the NKVD. After all, we didn't overthrow Lysenko simply to bend to another degenerate technocrat's will. However, with the growing strength and aggressiveness of Dirlewanger's brigade, we may be forced to align with Burba, at least temporarily, in order to destroy the bandit "king" and euthanize his pack of rabid animals.\n\nWe need to decide quickly, lest we give Dirlewanger the chance to strike first. Do we preserve our integrity as the true protectors of Communism, or will we sacrifice our values for the sake of survival and the Orenburg peasantry?"
 MGN_NKVD.1090.a: "This was not the outcome we wanted."
 
 MGN_NKVD.1091.t: "The Dirlewanger Question"
 MGN_NKVD.1091.desc: "Oskar Dirlewanger and his gang of fascist bandits continue to be a thorn in our side, raiding our border territories and slaughtering villages there for their own profit and amusement. Thankfully, we are not the only people he has chosen to incite - he has long been a pestilence on our brave comrades in Orenburg. Feeble-minded as he may be, Malenkov nevertheless should be able to comprehend just how much of a threat the Brigade is to the continued survival of socialist thought in the Urals. It is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later.\n\nA group of ambassadors have been sent to Orenburg to negotiate with Orenburg directly, hoping to draft some kind of official strategy as to how we will both work to contain and eliminate the Black Brigade. Negotiations, however, have been slow-going. Malenkov agrees that the Bandit King of the Urals needs to be dealt with at some point in the future, but he has been reluctant to fully surrender strategic control or give command primacy to NKVD troops in the field. They are an idiot in many regards, but at least they are smart enough to guard what power and sovereignty he has. We must be content with vague promises and empty handshakes for now, and focus more on finding ways to fully alleviate their doubts about us."
 MGN_NKVD.1091.a: "Better than nothing."

 MGN_NKVD.1092.t: "The Science"
 MGN_NKVD.1092.desc: "In the aftermath of Lysenko, we have to find something to do about the madman's so-called "science", and the science of the Black Mountain.\n\nTwo choices are presented to us. For one, we could throw it all away, getting rid of all the mad scientist's disturbed beliefs and outright untrue and harmful "socialist" beliefs in the field of science. This would result in a subsequent purging of all of the documents of Lysenko, and all of his advisors, we must\n\nSecondly, we could make our way through all these documents in an attempt to find something that will be of use. This will probably end as a useless waste of time, but will result in Lysenko's comrades getting out alive. What should we do on the matter?"
 MGN_NKVD.1092.a: "There's no use in his foolish escapades."
 MGN_NKVD.1092.b: "Perhaps, under all the failure, there is truth."

 MGN_NKVD.1060.t: "Wake Up Call"
 MGN_NKVD.1060.desc: "Perhaps a gun can defend a man's family. But a starving man can't hold a gun, and a gun can't build itself. Our workers and peasants must know their vital role in our society through any means, we will not tolerate provocative behavior that would risk our workers' morale and motivation to work and produce for their people. We will impose harsher quotas, and promote productivity within our society by setting up commissars and bureaucrats in the workplace and establish proper control and order in the fields and in the factories. It's time to deal with "demoralizing" elements of society more accordingly."
 MGN_NKVD.1060.a: "This should motivate them..."
 MGN_NKVD.1060.b: "No. We have faith in our people."

 MGN_NKVD.1061.t: "The Trials"
 MGN_NKVD.1061.desc: "Since we rescued former League citizens from the terror of Lysenko we have brought a potential danger into our newly liberated society. We can't walk in our own streets knowing that some of our very own citizens and comrades are conspiring with the man across the Urals. To secure our people from these traitors and traitorous sentiments, we must work in an unconventional, yet familiar manner. The 22nd will work swiftly and efficiently. Conducting secret trials, Interrogations, exiles and executions on suspected "League associates" will assure the loyalty and cooperation of our citizens in the face of Uralic aggression."
 MGN_NKVD.1061.a: "Back into the cage."
 MGN_NKVD.1061.b: "They suffered enough already."

 MGN_NKVD.1062.t: "The Speech"
 MGN_NKVD.1062.desc: "A poster at every street corner, at every factory and at every train station. Radio stations will be set up, buzzing with speeches from Stepan Bunkov. The common man of Magnitogorsk will be flooded by depictions of the NKVD's brave struggle against the bandits and Lysenko, by bombastic speeches and by parades in the streets. The people must hear the word of their friends and guardians, and as long as a single man could go through a day without seeing, reading or listening to our message, we have failed our mission."
 MGN_NKVD.1062.a: "Turn on the printers!"
 MGN_NKVD.1062.b: "This is unnecessary..."

 MGN_NKVD.1063.t: "The Fate of the Communes"
 MGN_NKVD.1063.desc: "We press ever forward, and now that the communes are under our watch, we have encountered a dilemma. Orenburg being the largest city in the Southern Urals, we now have a large and unruly populace unaccustomed to our... variation of rule. Our choices are simple. We imprison the angry masses, execute the dissenters, and send our own settlers, or we spare the people, brave the storm, and create unity between the mountain and the city."
 MGN_NKVD.1063.a: "They cannot be controlled."
 MGN_NKVD.1063.b: "A solution for the future is in order."

 MGN_NKVD.1064.t: "Adjustment"
 MGN_NKVD.1064.desc: "Life under NKVD watch isn't as different as some would have thought. There are trucks of soldiers roaming the streets, and rationing is a little stricter, but other than that, life is fine. There are even new civilians from the east moving in. I think that, eventually, we can learn to coexist with these people. Unless, of course, you're a dissenting opinion."
 MGN_NKVD.1064.a: "And so, life goes on..."

 MGN_NKVD.1065.t: "Internment"
 MGN_NKVD.1065.desc: "They come on trucks, in bands of 5 or 7. They wear black wool masks, with a red star on their olive green rags. They knock, they enter, and they take. Nobody asks questions because they fear they will be taken too. If there is no response on the other side, they enter anyway. Nobody knows where they come from or where they go. They take, and those taken do not return. They are relocated, but to where is uncertain. Some say they are shot out of town. Some say they are used as slaves. But nobody truly knows."
 MGN_NKVD.1065.a: "We did what was necessary."

 MGN_NKVD.2000.t: "The Red Dawn - Dirlewanger's Fall"
 MGN_NKVD.2000.desc: "Some fights happen once. Others are reflected once and twice and thrice, down the narrow alleyway of history, in scuffed mirrors and twisted reflections. This is the price of a broken world; endless fights for justice that smolder on, even when the fire gutters out.\n\nSome of the last remaining operational units of the Red Army's internal security and intelligence division have managed to destroy a group of bandits by the name of "Dirlewanger's Brigade", one which clings to the Organization of an SS Brigade.\n\nThe NKVD's victory over Dirlewanger sends both good and ill omens to the citizens under the reign of the New Red Black Mountain. On one hand, the psychopathy and outright madness of Dirlewanger shall no longer be a threat to all who cowered under his heel, and his banditry and the many crimes of his cronies shall be brought to justice. On the other hand, the NKVD is an ominous black space, even if it shrouds itself with the insignia and symbolism of the Red, and who knows how far Lysenko's shadow has been purged from its system?\n\nThe Urals tremble. A new Red Dawn descends upon the old hills. Little knows what it might bring."
 MGN_NKVD.2000.a: "Impressive."

 MGN_NKVD.2001.t: "Red Dawn - Ural Eclipse"
 MGN_NKVD.2001.desc: "Many said it was inevitable; the militarized, interventionist Ural League and the militarized, revolutionary NKVD in Black Mountain would eventually be at each others' throats. Even so, it was shocking to see how quickly relations between the two powerhouses degenerated into terrible conflict.\n\nNow the Red Flag flies on the remains of Ust-Katav and the League is scattered to the hills. The struggle has concluded. Menviks himself is nowhere to be found; NKVD statements and press reports claim he is dead, but the rosary he was known to carry was not found on the battlefield they claimed he fell on. Given the huge amount of respect and affection he received from his citizens, it is likely he was smuggled out to some other obscure corner of Russia to spend the rest of his pious days. Perhaps a hooded county priest will look up from his duties every so often and think of the land he once called home, weeping.\n\nAs for the fate of the former League's inhabitants, no one can say for sure. The NKVD has taken great pains to paint a reassuring palette of its policies, portraying itself as a Great Vanguard bringing civilization and revolutionary justice, but no one forgets their complicity in Lysenko's atrocities, and the question of just how much iron lies behind their silken rhetoric is something no one likes to think about.\n\nNo matter what the future holds, one thing is clear; the Red Dawn now kisses the Ural Mountains themselves, and the balance of power is forever changed. The Revolution smolders on."
 MGN_NKVD.2001.a: "One bear has clawed another to death."

 MGN_NKVD.2002.t: "Red Dawn - Left Unity"
 MGN_NKVD.2002.desc: "The Communes of Orenburg were always a contradiction, a state built around an ideology requiring its dissolution to be fulfilled. And there were many problems with how it was run, and the endless tightrope of popular consensus it had to navigate to get legislation into the books. But as the gunfire from the last militia outposts dies down and the Councilors scurry into exile and anonymity, it is clear that this experiment, flawed or successful, is now over. In its place stands a new Red Vanguard, and the bloody truism of Socialist Unity.\n\nThe Communes have fallen apart utterly; their Council (and Chairman) scattered, their local infrastructures supplanted or destroyed by purge, the ramshackle system which supported Orenburg is now gone, and over Orenburg itself a new red flag now flies. Lists are being drawn up with the methodical, scrupulous brutality inherent to the NKVD, and slowly those deemed as Revisionists and Traitors to the Socialist Cause are interned, tried and rehabilitated. Some disappear off the lists entirely, and it is best not to think too hard (or loudly) about their fates.\n\nIt is unclear if the residents of the Communes will acclimatize to their new Socialism, run from Black Mountain, and if they prefer their new Commissars over their old fractious Councilors and representatives. The NKVD reports are all positive in their confidence, of course; and they will continue to stay positive. No matter what. Time will tell if the residents of the ex-Communes feel the same.\n\nAnd observers in neighboring lands shake their heads sadly, knowing the old truth; that the Red Banner, in spreading, will always smother its own."
 MGN_NKVD.2002.a: "All Power to the Soviet."

Chiefs in hamlets as small as a dozen people wield more power then anyone should have the right to.
