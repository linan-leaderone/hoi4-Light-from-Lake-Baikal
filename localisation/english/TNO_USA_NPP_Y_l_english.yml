USA.1705.t:0 "The Yockey Inauguration"
USA.1705.d:0 "The nation stands in shock, riot police line the streets of Washington D.C., and Francis Parker Yockey climbs the steps of the United States Capitol building to be sworn in as President of the United States. Flanked by uneasy Secret Service agents, the new leader of the National Progressive Pact strides to the podium, brimming with confidence. Against all odds, his plans have come to fruition, and America awaits his words.\n\nThose surrounding the podium are of less distinction than expected for an inauguration of such importance; the RDC has boycotted his swearing in, and much of his own party refuses to attend. Foreign observers are also notably sparse, with the exception of a small delegation from the Reich, making the guest list mostly composed of his most avid supporters. Lois de Lafayette Washburn, Yockey's campaign manager, smiles for the cameras as the enigmatic donor Harold Keith Thompson deftly avoids them. The newly sworn in Vice President Louis Byers shakes hands and signs autographs for brown-shirted well-wishers, reveling in his candidate's victory, while Press Secretary Willis Carto and freshman representative Fred Huntley make conversation and Admiral John Crommelin's imperious gaze scans the crowd for signs of danger.\nThe crowd is composed in three parts. First, there are those whose sympathies lie with the underdog candidate who has overcome decades of struggle to reach this moment and wish to see America molded in his vision. Second, those who have turned out to exercise their First Amendment rights, fearing that they may be stripped away before the next inauguration. Finally, a thin line of Capitol Police divides the two groups. Shouts of protest and acclamation rise over each other, struggling to be heard.\n\nAs Yockey ascends, the din only grows into a storm of discontent, rising with the wind that flutters through the pages of his speech. The chief justice extends the book to the speaker; Imperium, Yockey's masterpiece of geopolitics and culture theory.\n\nIgnoring the contemptuous look of the defeated judge, one hand upon the book, he repeats the oath.\n\nThe President retracts his hand, turns towards the crowd, and begins to speak."

#Leader Description
POLITICS_YOCKEY_DESC:0 "Francis Parker Yockey is a man that few ever expected to be clothed in the powers of the Presidency. Now, however, after one of the most contentious elections in American history, an outspoken fascist sits in the White House. Originally an author and philosopher, Yockey became enthralled with the authoritarian and fascist movements occurring across the world during the 1930s. He took a particular interest in the works of Adolf Hitler while studying to become a lawyer, embracing the Nazi ideals of anti-semitism and ultramilitarism. Following the publication of his self-described magnum opus, "Imperium: the Philosophy of History and Politics", Yockey fathered a new movement in American politics by founding an ultra-far right section of the National Progressive Pact. Originally calling their wing of the NPP the "All-American National Vanguard", Yockey and his followers were quickly abhorred by the rest of the American political spectrum and simply dubbed "Sovereigntists". However, through the failures of his enemies and sheer providence, his faction now stands triumphant over the American political system.\n\nThe election of Yockey as President has stirred more than a few rats from the woodwork. In many cities across America, mainly in the South, it is not uncommon to see men wearing the hooded white robes of the Klu Klux Klan. Similarly, there is open talk of repealing landmark Civil Rights legislation of the past 20 years. Increasingly common lynchings of Black Americans go unnoticed and uninvestigated. In short, hate is being normalized across the United States, and many within and without the political establishment are terrified where this authoritarian wave might go.\n\nYockey, despite being the leader of the most powerful free nation on Earth, has been unclear and contradictory on his opinions of liberty. Many believe that, regardless of whatever outward show he makes of keeping American liberties intact, he is still a fascist, and will do everything he is able to strengthen the office of President. Yockey himself simply decries "culture-distorters" and claims to safeguard Western Civilization. Exactly what Yockey is protecting it from remains unclear, but with a cross and a star-spangled cloak, Francis Parker Yockey sits in the Oval Office, ready to execute his will upon America."

USA.yockey.1.desc:0 ""This is the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite..."\n\n"Good evening, tonight, the United States Senate has taken robust measures in ensuring the confirmations of the Cabinet of the President, a maverick of his time as the first member of the NPP's American National Vanguard to reach the Presidency. The day went as follows:"\n\nTaking a deep breath, Cronkite continued, "Firstly, Vice President Louis T. Byers spoke to the Senate, declaring that, 'Today is a great day for Americans across the country, as we don the mantle of security for our statehood and autonomy against the threat of the Zionist, the Communist, and so many other dangerous actors lurking in the shadows as they reach out to brainwash the youth into this deranged and accursed Leftism which has come to dominate us today!'" Cronkite's face furrowed, as he continued to readjust his glasses whilst he spoke, as a pang of fear tore at his heart.\n\n"After a rousing confirmation for Secretary of State Revilo P. Oliver, Treasury Secretary Harold Keith Thompson, um, addressed the Senate, announcing that 'I have been, within the wise prerogatives of the President, chosen to take the mantle of managing the American people's economic strength. No one has said that it will be an easy job; however, while some may want to tear it down, I, with the President, armed with Vice President Byers' fire, Secretary Oliver's boldness, and soon-to-be Secretary Crommelin's strength, will bring this nation to unity and strength!'" Cronkite's hand wiped across his face slowly, as the black, crackling of the screen was met with silence on the acclaimed reporter.\n\n"And, finally, we, we saw Rear Admiral John G. Crommelin take his stand to the, the Senate, today. As he said, 'It is with many thanks that I find myself approved to take action as Secretary of Defense over this fine nation's military. Jews and liberals have shaken our structure to the core, and it is with hope that the President and I can work together to, um, bring security to us all.'"\n\nCronkite stared long and hard to a space unseen by the rolling cameras brightening the living rooms of Americans, now shrouded in the night's darkness. As a tear befell his cheek, the iron-willed reporter found his throat crushed, unable to speak any but eight more words..."

Ten digits in ten seconds - if Regulus Philips wasn't worrying himself sick, he'd have averaged half that for a number he'd been calling for five years straight.\n\nOne second became two, then three, then ten. The man gripped the cherry red receiver a little tighter before someone picked up. Sighing he said, "Sarah, Reg. I'd like to get boss Evan on the line; something's come up and the Board's gotta act soon."\n\n"And who's this supposed to be?"\n\nEyes widened. The voice wasn't Evan's secretary's. Hell, it wasn't even a woman's at all. "Oh- uh. M-Mr. Regulus Philips, sir," he stammered. "I was told this is the landline for Commissioner Evan Winters' office. May I speak to him?"\n\n"Winters? The race traitor?" Thick and twangy chuckles carried through the static. "Fella won't be bothering nobody no more, I'll give you that."\n\nIce crept into Philips' veins as the voice drawled out his enlightenment. "So that's how it is. Well let me tell you something, Bubba: whatever burning questions y'got, the answer's probably yes. Ballot drop-offs are being shut down across Cook County. Gangbangers are getting their votes taken from them.

Thomas Gravois pondered such a question as he continued to breathe the ocean of New Orleanian humidity into his lungs, as he felt the sweat drip down to his hand, clasped hands with his girlfriend, Lily Babineaux. The brewing stormclouds above proved no use to uplift Louisiana from the terrific heat that struck down upon the South.\n\n"First vote, first vote, good lord, gonna be fun! I know we missed this past Presidential election, but hell, voting for a Congressman can't hurt, can it, Lily?" Thomas said.\n\nLily nodded, and smiled, as she felt happy, but the pangs of worry continued to dawn in her, as she saw more and more whispering couples heading towards the booth.\n\n"I mean, just think of it, we got Republicans, Democrats, all sorts on the NPP, I mean, I know that President Yockey's not the most popular between us, and I'm not meaning to force you to vote for anybod-" Gravois said, before being cut off by a rushing police car, blaring its siren.\n\n"I don't know, Thomas, are we sure today's going to be a good day for participating within this here election? I know it's important and all, but something just ain't right about all of this, I bet you can feel it too." She says, as the rumble of thunderous stormclouds rolled within the distance. Sweat continued to bear down the couple's foreheads as they stopped for a brief moment.\n\n"Now, sweetie, I know it's nerve-wracking and all, but we gotta do what we can for our country, both our fathers served our country back in-"\n\n"Thomas..." Lily whispered.\n\nThe two looked forward, and none of the cheery election seasons of the past prepared them for the sight. No barbecues, no pins and stickers, no cheers and laughs from the crowds, but only the roaring of helicopters and armed guards roaming about. Between each booth laid an officer in riot gear, bearing the symbols of the American National Vanguard, as the crowd was moved forward with police on each side. Loudspeakers, sirens, all blared out, as lines were monitored, people were monitored, for God's sakes, each vote was monitored. The young couple looked at one another, wanting to back away and run all the way back home, but the shining glimmer of an officer's badge, lined up next to a patch for the Vanguard, shone into their eyes, as he beckoned them forth."

USA.yockey.4.desc:0 "There had been so much hope, last year.\n\nThe Congressional Caucus meeting would have been overwhelming enough for any freshman representative; it was worse for the few new Progressive delegates. Jackson's defeat in the primaries had shattered the party and caused a slump in turnout, and the center had suffered the most. Pat Schroeder of the Colorado 1st had barely won in the recount, with a split vote between her, the RD candidate, and her primary opponent who had refused to acknowledge his defeat. The right had given warm welcomes and firm handshakes, but the Vanguard congressmen had not- despite being far from firmly controlling the party, they seemed to be in no hurry to reach across the aisle.\n\n"In these halls of Washington where conspiracy and scheming against the West has become the order of the day, we have removed the corrupters from the levers of power, and now bring them out to the observation and scrutiny of all clear-minded American observers."\n\nThe President had been speaking for some time. A title ill-suited for an unimposing man with a pompous and arrogant manner of speech, but an unmistakable knack for telling people what they wanted to hear. He almost looked fearful as he spoke, despite his power, as if one slip of the tongue might bring his regime crashing down. They had no majority without the party. They needed every vote they could get.\n\n"And we hold this truth to be self evident, that after a long train of abuses and usurpations, an usurpation of our own has become necessary, and with your support, we have achieved it! Regardless of what the legalities imposed on us by traitors demand, we shall no longer dictate to our Southern brethren how they ought to enforce their laws!"\n\nAnd the furious sound of applause echoed through the halls, and hope was extinguished."

You stay here, you're supporting the White House in destroying democracy.\n\nWITTENFIELD: Calm down, Harry, you don't want to be saying those sorts of things here, not so loud anyway.\n\nKESSLER: You think they've started spying on the bureau already?

Nevertheless, such distractions failed to rip the steel-eyed gaze of President Francis Parker Yockey away from the report on his desk, as the bushled face of his Vice President came in, unannounced.\n\n"Well, it looks we have some good news coming in this morn-" said Vice President Byers.\n\n"I understand. The true first step into the cull of the Culture-disease has begun, Vice President Byers. This engine of liberalism, this distorter of the morally-superior, finally, shredded apart amidst the powerful claws of Western Civilization, like the muck it is." President Yockey declared, monologueously, as he scrapes a piece of dirt from beneath his finger with his sharp thumbnail. "Vice President Byers, I implore you allow yourself to be seated for the world's next-spun few minutes, and listen towards the successes of the American National Vanguard against the likes of the tumors of Democracy." The words floated around the mind of Vice President Byers, and while his superior's rhetoric typically left him with a sense of pride pinned by a dosage of dread, he used the opportunity to listen in, as President Yockey flipped open the radio signal. The crackling emitting throughout the silence of the two men only fell broken by President Yockey's next words.\n\n"Commanders of the Police Units stationed across the Country, I hereby, under the powers vested within me by the Spirit of America, under which our Congress has granted me legislative authority unto declaring, authorize for the execution of Order 2237, allowing for the sinceforth enforcement of the Safeguarding America's Fundamental Exceptionalism Act against all potentially law-breaking degenerative media-sources from across the country.

Nonsense, Vice President Byers, you fail to understand me if you misconstrue my soul's perturbedness if you construct it into the childlike frustration felt like men such as Secretary Crommelin, and all of the inbred 'patriots' scurrying about the Midwest and South, Vice President. Rather, this Judeo-Bolshevik machination, this rebellion-child sprung from the seeds of Democracy, Liberalism, and the Constitution itself, this instigates not Child-like tantrums within my soul, but a greater understanding as to the frustrations to be held in reshaping this world. The Vanguard is prepared to mantle the mission of establishing National Socialism in the likes of this damned Country, no matter if the socialist, Jew, or otherwise soulful-degenerate is unwilling. The Safeguarding America's Fundamental Exceptionalism Act is aborted, Vice President Byers; however, our future soul-destiny is not quenched beneath the suffocation of virtue that liberalism exists as."

One series of numen in particular poisons the American mind: E Pluribus Unum. That Unum has been destroyed by the many.\n\nThis was no accident.\n\nThe disease of culture-distortion that afflicts America is a construction, an archaic Grecian statue marred by those who subtly disfigured her face until it became indistinguishable from that of a beast. She is Western Civilization, the ultimate manifestation of the High Culture. President Yockey is the sculptor that will polish, chisel, and carve away until she is restored to Her glorious perfection."

Our power in Congress is greatly limited; even the majority of the staunch segregationists have decried the election of President Yockey. An entire legion of culture-distorters has been shocked into extreme anti-Western negativist measures by our swift rise to power, and will do their best to obstruct our path to supremacy. However, we possess the stronger will-to-power and remain free of the by-products of Rationalist thought that have poisoned the minds of America's political class.

There are no publications in America addressed solely to the intellect; a Culture-distorting regime rests on its invisibility, and independent thinking by strong individuals is ipso facto hostile to such a regime. Nor are there any publications which purvey only facts. Any facts, and any viewpoints, are coordinated with their presentation into the ruling propaganda-picture.\n\nIt is imperative that the danger of these publications be brought to the forefront of the Western culture-mind apparatus.
