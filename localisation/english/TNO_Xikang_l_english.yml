POLITICS_LIU_WENHUI_DESC:0 "Liu Wenhui was born in 1895 and was a thoroughbred soldier. He graduated from the Baoding Military Academy in 1916 and, upon returning to Sichuan from Baoding, joined Liu Cunhou's Sichuan Army. After joining the Kuomintang in 1926, he quickly rose through the ranks within the National Revolutionary Army, being promoted to commander of the 24th Army and appointed as the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government in 1929. Sichuan was highly unstable due to the presence of numerous warlords. Through distant alliances, close attacks, conspiracies, and military intimidation, Liu Wenhui successfully stabilized his absolute position in Sichuan. However, in 1934, he was driven out of Sichuan by his nephew, Liu Xiang, and fled to Xikang, where he served as Chairman of the Provincial Construction Committee. Liu Xiang's relationship with Chiang Kai-shek was as shaky as Sichuan's relationship with Chiang—he even refused Chiang's orders on several occasions.\n\nDuring the War of Resistance, Liu Wenhui remained steady, not allowing his troops to advance recklessly. When the Japanese reached Sichuan, Liu Wenhui, though the last major warlord in Sichuan, chose to gather his troops and retreat to Xikang, camping in the small town of Xichang. Liu Wenhui refused to surrender to Japan, and the Japanese deemed the small mountainous province insignificant, finding it unnecessary to expend resources attacking it.\n\nDecades after the Japanese conquered Sichuan, Liu Wenhui remains one of the last independent warlords on Chinese soil, isolated and helpless. Sichuan, right next to Xikang, may be under the direct control of the central government, but it has once again fallen into turmoil, with various forces vying for control. Liu Wenhui longs to see a free China, but his subordinates strongly oppose him. They believe that fighting Japan is tantamount to suicide. Perhaps only a miracle can allow Liu Wenhui to take up arms once again…"

POLITICS_XUE_YUE_DESC:0 "§YPosition: Deputy Commander of the Ninth War Zone, Republic of China§!\n\n§YMilitary Rank: General, First Class§!\n\nAt the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, the Jurchens invaded the south, and the country fell… But the men of the Han people still had loyal bones, and the men of Jing and Xiang gathered under the banner of Yue, fighting the invaders to the north, becoming famous throughout the land… Time has passed, a thousand years have gone by, yet the scenes of the late Qing Dynasty resemble those of the Song—the central authority of the dynasty is trampled by foreign invaders, and its wealth is coveted. Smelling the scent of blood, the great powers pounced, with Japan being the most bloodthirsty and savage among these wolves.\n\nAt the moment of signing the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki, a father named his son "Yangyue," hoping he would grow up to be a great hero who would help the weak. Years later, the father finally saw his wish fulfilled—once again, the Chinese nation faced a moment of life and death, and his son became a general, standing on the walls of Changsha, leading the men of Jing and Xiang to resist the Japanese invasion. In the three battles of Changsha, Xue Yue repeatedly thwarted the Japanese attempts to invade Changsha using the "Heaven Furnace Tactics" of using the terrain to delay, flank, and encircle the enemy.\n\nBut no matter how valiantly the soldiers fought, no matter how skillful the generals were, victory grew increasingly distant. The cause lay with the inept rulers, just like the Song court that hindered Yue Fei's northern expedition—before the enemy even arrived, they had already panicked, and a single fire almost reduced the entire city to ashes—such cowardice, such disregard for human life, that it would be hard to find another example in the annals of history. Finally, during the fourth battle of Changsha, the Japanese concentrated their superior forces and broke into the city, connecting the north and south, allowing them to quickly transfer resources and troops from the northeast to Singapore by rail and water.\n\nWhen the city fell, the remaining Nationalist troops were in disarray, and Xue Yue, unable to regroup his forces in time, had to retreat west. His troops suffered heavy losses due to disease, and he was wounded by a stray bullet, with shrapnel lodging in his bones, leaving him unable to raise his right arm again… When he finally broke through the enemy's encirclement and returned to Chongqing, the situation had already deteriorated beyond repair. Along the Yangtze River, the Japanese forces were closing in on Chongqing. The head of the Kuomintang, the self-important and indecisive Chiang Kai-shek, gently took Xue Yue's hand and entrusted him with the defense of the area around Chongqing.\n\nIn the battle for Chongqing, Xue Yue, with a trembling hand, wove a fragile defensive line, directing a weary army in what became the final bloody symphony of World War II. But it was all in vain… In 1962, this broken general led a broken army, holding on to a corner of the land. He began to envy Yue Fei's fate—though it was absurd, at least Yue Fei did not have to witness the devastation of the nation and the fall of the country…"

After assisting his nephew Liu Xiang (seven years his senior) in crushing the forces of Yang Sen, Liu Wenhui reached the pinnacle of his power—dominating half of Sichuan, controlling over 70 wealthy counties, and commanding an army of 120,000 soldiers. Theoretically, there should have been no major issues with the Liu family dividing the land of Shu, but no matter the blood ties, two tigers cannot share one mountain, and a rift gradually formed between the two Lius, eventually becoming irreconcilable. Although Liu Wenhui was powerful, age brought wisdom to Liu Xiang, who not only managed to divide and co-opt Liu Wenhui's subordinates but also formed an "encirclement" against him, rallying the warlords of eastern and northern Sichuan to march on Chengdu. After weeks of resistance, Liu Wenhui was forced to flee north, retreating to Ya'an, hoping to defend along the river, but by this time, the "An Sichuan Army" had grown in strength, and Liu Wenhui's foundation had already crumbled, with his subordinates either defecting or fleeing, leaving him with no strength to resist.\n\nWhether out of kinship or to mock the defeated, Liu Xiang spared Liu Wenhui's life and recommended him to the central government to govern Xikang—a land of ethnic diversity, chaotic security, and endless trouble. Having lost his territory, Liu Wenhui had no choice but to accept the appointment. In office, he worked diligently, revering Buddha, governing, and promoting education, eventually bringing some semblance of order to the area. Liu Wenhui thought he could settle quietly and gradually build his power, but in 1935, the Red Army arrived. Under the urging of Chairman Chiang's telegrams, Liu Wenhui tremblingly led his troops to hold the strategic points, thinking he was safe due to his advantageous position, only for the Red Army to break through at the Dadu River and Luding Bridge, causing heavy losses to his forces.\n\nFor years, Liu Wenhui hid his edge, keeping a low profile while diligently carrying out his duties. He dealt with the Nanjing government with superficial politeness but was not averse to accepting the olive branch extended by the Communists. Though not adept at navigating both sides, he managed to establish a foothold in Xikang.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems heaven sought to repeatedly take away what had been given to him—as the War of Resistance broke out, the National Government had to relocate westward, and Xikang was no longer a remote backwater but a region close to the "emperor," leaving no room for Liu Wenhui to dominate. Watching as central military officers were successively appointed, Liu Wenhui helplessly relinquished his power… until the fall of Chongqing, when the defeated soldiers, like he once had, fled west. Liu Wenhui lacked both the ability and ambition to seize power and reorganize the retreating troops, having long since grown weary…\n\nNow, Liu Wenhui sits alone on the chairman's bench of Xikang Province, surrounded by people, yet none of them care about his fate…"

At the age of 18, he chose to join the military, hoping to make a name for himself. Company adjutant, division staff officer, regiment adjutant, chief of staff… During these years, while China saw no major wars, internal conflicts were constant, providing ample opportunities for military achievement. Zhao Zili steadily built up his credentials, and by the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army engineering corps.\n\nIn the early stages of the war, the Nationalist Army suffered heavy losses, and with the urgent need for expansion, there was a growing shortage of senior officers, leading to Zhao Zili's rapid promotion. He was appointed chief of staff in the Ninth War Zone under Xue Yue. In many respects, the two worked together seamlessly, understanding each other intuitively. During the first three battles of Changsha, Zhao Zili cooperated with Xue Yue in flanking enemy forces, intercepting supplies, and encircling the enemy, perfectly executing the "Heaven Furnace Tactics."\n\nHowever, the good times did not last long, and as the war dragged on, a rift developed between the two. Zhao Zili criticized Xue Yue's tactics as too conservative and rigid, arguing that while the "Heaven Furnace Tactics" appeared flawless, if not adjusted, the Japanese would eventually find a weakness. But Xue Yue, confident in his belief that the Japanese, engaged in multiple fronts with a battle line stretching from East Asia to the Pacific, would not have the capacity to launch a major offensive, insisted that the enemy along the Xiang River would be primarily on the defensive and would not be able to muster enough forces to advance on Changsha…\n\nEvents soon proved Zhao Zili's prediction correct—when the Japanese amassed 200,000 troops and once again advanced on Changsha, the Ninth War Zone had no time to prepare; when the Japanese deployed heavy artillery and destroyed the artillery positions on Mount Yuelu, the Chinese army had already lost the initiative; and when the Japanese finally advanced in stages, counter-encircling the Nationalist forces, Xue Yue realized too late that the "Heaven Furnace Tactics" had been broken, and Changsha was doomed.\n\nHaving issued an early warning, Zhao Zili was sidelined and, upon returning to Chongqing, was labeled as having "failed in command" and stripped of his military rank… After the fall of Chongqing, he followed Xue Yue to Xikang.\n\nXue Yue still regards Zhao Zili as a trusted aide in the Ninth War Zone, but Zhao Zili has grown contemptuous of this "Yue Fei" who lacks both ability and vision, though he has no choice but to temporarily serve under him as he lacks military power of his own…"

Yang Sen came from a humble background, but he managed to ride the waves of the times, steering his course—he joined the Sichuan Army during the Qing Dynasty, then went to Yunnan and participated in the National Protection War. Yuan Shikai—this tyrant of the people—was forced to abandon his imperial title, but the curtain had only just risen on the warlord conflicts. Yang Sen seized the opportunity, breaking away from the Yunnan Army and entering Sichuan, and at the height of his career, he once controlled both Chengdu and Chongqing, commanding over 70,000 private soldiers, becoming the dominant power in eastern Sichuan.\n\nBut even the most careful plan can go awry. In 1927, as Chiang Kai-shek launched the April 12th coup, the Northern Expedition failed, and the Central Plains once again descended into war. Yang Sen, confident in his strong forces, thought he could profit from the chaos but ended up suffering a crushing defeat, losing his elite troops outside Sichuan, while his old enemy Liu Xiang made a comeback. Years of accumulation were lost in an instant, and Yang Sen fell from the heights of the times, but he did not give up. Instead, he held on to his territory, quietly governing the people.\n\nWhen the Japanese invaded, Yang Sen was ordered to lead his troops out of Sichuan, serving under Xue Yue. The battles of Shanghai, Wuhan, and Changsha… the Sichuan Army displayed incredible tenacity and courage; in every harsh battlefield, the Sichuan Army stood firm. But after the defeat at Changsha, fewer than one in ten of the thousands of private soldiers who had left Sichuan remained… The situation had long since deteriorated, and all Yang Sen could do now was lead his soldiers back home. After enduring a grueling journey, the Sichuan Army returned home, only to find the enemy following closely behind. With their backs to the Yangtze River, the Sichuan men fought valiantly, but Yang Sen survived.\n\nYang Sen has fought battles all his life, never lacking the courage to face the enemy or the wisdom to retreat, and he holds absolute admiration and loyalty for General Xue Yue. The only thing holding him back is his age. The old general often looks east, thinking of the ups and downs of his life, and can only sigh at the thought of being buried in a foreign land."

As one of the veterans who, along with Chiang Kai-shek, followed Sun Yat-sen in the Northern Expedition, Jiang Dingwen made a name for himself on the battlefield against warlords, known for his tactical flexibility and daring. During the Central Plains War, he further demonstrated his mobility, charging back and forth, flanking and turning, earning the nickname "Flying General" throughout the country…\n\nHistory is full of people who, despite their merits, have fallen into infamy due to some quirk; Jiang Dingwen's reputation (if he ever had one) was destroyed in a particularly pure way—in the 1930s, as the national civil wars subsided, he began to indulge in gambling and drinking. When the War of Resistance broke out, he was appointed Chairman of Shaanxi Province. As the de facto leader of the northwest, sitting on the front lines of the resistance, he engaged in rampant corruption, embezzlement, and indulgence, without sparing a thought for the war effort.\n\nJiang Dingwen's dereliction of duty ultimately led to the collapse of the front lines. He was demoted and transferred to Henan, only to find himself in the path of the Japanese main offensive. The Nationalist Army collapsed like a mountain, losing 38 cities and over 200,000 troops in a month. Jiang Dingwen fled back to Chongqing, where an exasperated Chiang Kai-shek removed him from office and placed him under investigation, leaving him to oversee the rear… But with the Japanese advancing, what "rear" was there to oversee?\n\nIn the flames of Chongqing, the "Flying General" once again took flight, leading the remnants of his forces to the forgotten corner of Xikang. In the face of national collapse and the loss of millions of lives, has he changed? Just take a look at his greasy smile, his round belly, and the herpes beneath his belt, and you'll have your answer!"
