 # 2.1 - LEADER BIOS #
 #####################
 POLITICS_ERICH_KOCH_DESC: "This is what Erich Koch has been left with. This is what he deserves.\n\nAt his peak of authority, Erich Koch was a thug upon a throne, brutal even by the standards of the Third Reich. His colonial policy was an endless cycle of exploitation and repression, designed to beat the Ukrainian people into submission. Under his watch, the Hunger Plan left the native population starving in fields of amber, and his quotas reduced them to slavery. In his mind, he had forged the very picture of lebensraum: a blood diamond in Hitler's crown.\n\nIt could not last, of course. In the wake of the West Russian War, the Reichskommissariat was left with far more problems than Koch could comprehend. Above him, an army of administrators demanded more and more, hoping to prop up the Reich's ailing economy with further blood from its breadbasket. Below him, a crowd of natives screamed, demanding freedom from the abyss he had created. For the first time, Erich Koch was faced with problems which could not be solved with whips and hammers. The Reichskommissar was finally lost.\n\nRather than attempting major changes, the Reichskommissar has let the colony stagnate beneath him, even as terror rises and profits slow. Deep down, Erich Koch may be aware of some solution, but the man lacks the energy to change Ukraine's fate. In the name of profit, the Reichskommissar ground his colony into sand - now, he watches it blow away."

 POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_KUBIYOVYCH_DESC: "An age of oppression, barbarism, and bloodshed has crushed the will of many men and women to take a stand against foreign imperialism, and even fewer ordinary people would dare openly call for independence. However, Volodymyr Kubiyovych is not most people, as a lifetime as a soldier, a geographer, and a politician has shown. However, the many lifestyles of and bureaucracy surrounding Kubiyovych will not stand in the way of the one, true goal which has always persisted in the mind of the Polish-raised Ukranian, with the image of cheering Ukranians in a free state of their own.\n\nA life of study and teaching would not prepare the intellectual for the Nazi invasion of the Polish land he had lived in for most of his life, spurned by diaspora and, now, another invader of his home. Thus, Kubiyovych delved into the fire of his scorn to establish one of the few social programs on the face of Europe, helping thousands of Ukranian men, women, and children affected by the war. Meanwhile, the former cartographer chose to stand against the infamous Hans Frank in his desired slaughter of Ukranian peasants, allowing just a bit more success for his homeless people. However, as the Nazi victory came, all Kubiyovych could do was encourage the growth of the Galician Waffen-SS to use as a foundation for a pseudo-army to protect against further Nazi persecution.\n\nHowever, in the age of darkness Ukraine has found itself in, a light dawns on the horizon for Kubiyovych and his companions. Men may stand against him, clawing at him to strike down his attempts for independence. But such botherations and sins against the Ukranian people shall not stand against Kubiyovych's work with the Reich. Nothing will."

 POLITICS_GEORG_LEIBBRANDT_DESC: "In his years as deputy, Georg Leibbrandt had always dreamed of a moment like this. To see Koch killed by his own hubris, to see every folly of the old regime laid bare, the concept of such a dramatic collapse had come as a spiteful fantasy to the deputy. Yet his dreams always ended with his domain as stable and functional, a product of his scientific reforms. They never ended like this.\n\nShoved into the twisted throne of Erich Koch, Leibbrandt never realized the degree of mismanagement at every level of the Reichskommissariat. Yes, the deputy had seen the Ukrainians as natural allies, but the scale of their insubordination outmatched even his most dire scenarios. Where he imagined himself the sole reformer of Koch's broken system, he now must share power with two fellow "visionaries", who shoot down every one of his proposals. Even now, he hears talks in the halls of the hopped-up deputy who will be swept away as soon as the war is over. Insubordination, it seems, has outlasted even the Reichskommissariat itself.\n\nThere is no time for reform. There is no place for change. As Leibbrandt looks around his dying colony, he can only think one thought, twenty-three years. More than two decades of badly formulated plans, ill-conceived rhetoric, and petty infighting have left Ukraine in this moment. Woe to the man who is left to pick up the pieces."

 POLITICS_GEORG_LEIBBRANDT_WIN_DESC: "How long did Georg Leibbrandt languish? How long did he let the pages of his plans yellow and crumble, left in their notebooks while Herr Koch was allowed to rampage unchecked? How many loyal Rosenbergites died driftless, believing a better system could never come to pass?\n\nNow unquestioningly in power, Leibbrandt still cannot help but think of these questions. The Reichskommissar has been left with a nation of rubble, but Ukraine should have been a nation of peace and dignity, its noble, simple citizens already uplifted by the gracious German state. Instead, Leibbrandt now must prove his worth to the world, in the midst of the worst of conditions.\n\nAs his plans emerge from dusty binders into allied hands, all can tell just how grand the Reichskommisar's vision is. Leibbrandt wants a transition to an independent Ukrainian state, yet a state perfectly designed at the onset to preserve a slavish German loyalty. To Leibbrandt, it is a victory for rational governance. The Ukrainian people are not so certain.\n\nLeibbrandt has written a script for his nation, one in which he is the hero to a vast and needy people, one in which Ukraine is freed and transformed by his powerful dictums. He has already found his actors, his crew, and his stage. So long as Ukraine can be trusted to follow, Leibbrandt's legacy is already secured."

 POLITICS_HANS_OTTO_BRAUTIGAM_DESC: "While Bräutigam never doubted himself for a second, the rise of such a committed reformist to the position of Reichskommissar astounds even him.\n\nWhen the power of his uncle's pull gifted him a job as Representative of the Foreign Office in Ukraine, Hans-Otto Bräutigam first felt lost in such a foreign land. He could only despair at what seemed like a dead end, but in this eastern colony, he found his calling as ineptitude became abundant. His calls for extreme reforms to the status quo attracted those who looked to his ideals as a cure to the chaos.\n\nA network of contacts, an unwavering belief in reform and luck crafted the magic formula to turn him into the Reichskommissar of Ukraine. Political freedoms and support for the long-suffering natives are in the spotlight as Bräutigam's ideals can come true. But his road is not an easy one. His faction is but a lone lighthouse battered by waves of rigid orthodox attitudes. Even his allies wonder if he is going too far with his proposals.\n\nBut if Bräutigam were to succeed in his reforms, hope may soon rule the day in all of Ukraine once more..."
 
 POLITICS_OTTO_OHLENDORF_DESC: "Otto Ohlendorf is everything that the SS seeks to create in a man. He is independent, a free-thinker in his every manner. He is dutiful, a bureaucrat who chooses to live his life by the mechanical spirit of Bismarck. He is violently willing to enforce Nazism, and is utterly uninterested in the lives and minds of those he deems lesser.\n\nUntil now, the SS have hated him for it. Ohlendorf took the logical extension of Nazi ideals seriously, and viewed the state of the German economy as a tragedy for the Aryan Volk. He wrote down what he saw - a decaying, increasingly unequal society that was failing to use its violent dominance to provide for the everyman. He wrote of a decaying party with an honest pessimism, and the SS saw that opinion as an annoyance. They have punished him ever since.\n\nNow, Ohlendorf has a chance to reverse that slight. Reichskommissar may still not be his ideal role, but if Otto Ohlendorf can economically transform this backwater, he may have a chance of showing Germania just how proper his methods could transform the entire Reich. In his years of study, his years of economic work, his years of violence, he has built a wealth of expertise and connections across every facet of his government. Now the time comes to wield them."

 POLITICS_PETER_KOZHEVNIKOV_DESC: "Peter Kozhevnikov has been made President of Ukraine, its paramount leader. According to official sources, he has played a vast role in freeing Ukraine. This is not strictly false. The best performances contain a hint of truth, after all.\n\nYet Kozhevnikov hardly liberated his nation on a bayonet's edge. He liberated it with a German stamp of approval, with handshakes and smiles, with Leibbrandt standing beside him. Now, he gets to rant on whatever fascistic subject he likes, while radios blare it across every city in Ukraine.\n\nSuch a story is common in the Ukrainian National Republic. Many Ukrainians have had precipitous rises, their stories blared across every channel as a sign of the times. Freed from bondage, Ukrainians can now enter school, even join upper management. It can feel as if they can do anything.\n\nIn truth, many things still lie behind the curtains, away from Ukrainian hands. The economy still rests with German industrialists, the military with Wehrmacht troops. Even Leibbrandt remains in Kiew, an "advisor" in name only. Yet there is a sense of hope in the air. For the first time in decades, the Ukrainian people see a way out. It may not feel like a true home, but it just might suffice."

 UKR_a_bitter_harvest_severe: "A Bitter Harvest - Severe"
 UKR_a_bitter_harvest_severe_desc: "The food situation in the Breadbasket has become stretched to the absolute limit.\n\nWith story after story of soldiers pressuring population centers into 'donating' large swathes of their food reservoirs, it is just short of a miracle that the army is able to march with enough food at all. A significant portion of civilians are down to mouthfuls, crumbs of food. This is becoming untenable and if things persist in this manner, the whole of Ukraine will become the seat of a humanitarian crisis."

 UKR_a_bitter_harvest_famine_desc: "What had been the Breadbasket of Europe has become a dominion of the Black Horseman, the carnage of the civil war reducing Ukraine to widespread famine.\n\nWhere the army is not plagued by desertion and dissent, they march half-starved. The villages unraided by our soldiers have been reduced to veritable ghost towns, either gunned down by our own or starved to death.

 UKR_supply_inefficient_desc: "The lack of action to address the allocation of our supplies has caused many stockpiles to go missing due to ineffective organization, allocation, and logistical handling.

Whilst our consumption is down, our state may find difficulties operating in prime condition due to the cuts that we have imposed, but it is no matter. We are in a war of attrition, and it is better for us to save our supplies for whenever we may need them most, as they are finite and nigh unproducable, considering the circumstances.

 # STARTING BIOS
 UKR_Georg_Leibrandt_hog_desc: "§Y"The Eastern Ministry's Exile"\nDeputy to the Reichskommissar for the Ukraine\nHead of Main Department of Administration\nRosenbergian Tendency§!\n--------------\n§LGeorg Leibbrandt is Ukraine's student and its teacher, a man who has studied the nation for half a century and has returned with a clarity few feel in its darkest hour. In his notes, his dream is laid bare, a Reichskommissariat which is guided by scientific rigor over militaristic brutishness, where the foolish Hunger Plan is finally laid to rest. For now, however, it is mere paper, while Ukraine burns around him.\n\nThe Deputy Reichskommissar is not a powerless man, but his reforms require an authority beyond his means. He may be a savior to the Collaborators and exiled bureaucrats, but to the Wehrmacht and SS he is a weak civilian and to the hardliners he is a laughing stock. For now, Leibbrandt and his followers can only quietly work while Ukraine crashes, to cushion the landing - or reap from the chaos that follows."

 UKR_Richard_Wagner_eco_desc: "§Y"Colonial Exploiter"\nHead of Main Department of Food and Agriculture\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LIn 1944, Richard Wagner, an agrarian administrator in occupied Belgium, was fired by the military on grounds of sexual harassment. It could have - should have - destroyed his career. But Wagner was an SS man. His organization found him new work, and by 1950 the scandal was largely a footnote.\n\nThe ordeal taught him a crucial fact - the NSDAP has the answer, and there's no use in whining. Therefore, even as Wagner has racked up promotions and accomplishments, he has never deeply involved himself in party disputes. His main opinions remain firmly rooted in the agrarian sector, which he operates in Ukraine - it was him who has largely completed decollectivization, against Darré's wishes. As for the rest, so long as Germanization continues, Wagner is more than happy remaining in the shadows."
 
 UKR_Hans_Otto_Brautigam_for_desc: "§Y"The Voice of Conscience"\nRepresentative of the Foreign Office\nReformed National Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LHans-Otto Bräutigam is a young man with big dreams and a lot to prove. Despite receiving his position after just a bit of nepotism from his uncle, Hans-Otto has not become complacent like other young men given cushy jobs by their family in the elite. Behind a facade of adhering to National Socialist ideology, Bräutigam dreams of a new, free Germany in a new, free Europe.\n\nHe wonders if his dream, moving on from National Socialist tyranny and building a future of freedom, is even possible. He wonders if it is even possible to make things right. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. But that won't stop Bräutigam from trying to do the right thing and make Ukraine a better place, even if he has to sacrifice his greater ambitions."
 
 UKR_Otto_Ohlendorf_sec_desc: "§Y"The Self-Righteous Prussian"\nSupreme SS and Police Leader in Reichskommissriat Ukraine\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LIf you wish to understand Ohlendorf, one must know just how much he is willing to do to see his project implemented. All NSDAP functionaries learn quickly to internalize an acceptance of violence, but Ohlendorf executed that violence; in his time heading the Einsatzgruppe D, he saw some hundred thousand "subhumans" shot and shoved into unmarked graves. He has seen the calculus of nazi bureaucracy made real, and he did not blink.\n\nThis is not the goal of his career - his dream work would be heading an economic ministry in Germania. Yet despite his obvious credentials, time and time again his brutal honesty and stubborn attitude have gotten him branded unhelpful and sent to the East.\n\nPerhaps he was always too honest, too comfortable with presenting the realities of National Socialism, to make headway in Germania. But those realities don't truly give him pause. They only give him a chance to make things more efficient, more streamlined - and here in Ukraine, he may find an opportunity to make those changes."

 ### LEIB MINISTERS
 UKR_Peter_Kozhevnikov_for_desc: "§YNaturalized National Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LIn all of the bluster and blare of the Reichskommissariat's propaganda machine, one might hear Peter Kozhevnikov's name a hundred times and yet never know a thing about him. Though he has been present in Ukrainian politics since the Russian Civil War, the man has a scant history, only made notable by his dedication to a decidedly western mode of fascism. Yet some twenty years ago, he fell into the sphere of Leibbrandt, and firmly remained there ever since. It seems that has made all the difference.\n\nNow, Kozhevnikov has been promoted to Chairman of the Ukrainian National Council, a title once as irrelevant as any other, but increasingly important in Leibbrandt's Ukraine. Though Kozhevnikov is hardly a man of conviction or talent, he is a man of loyalty. For Leibbrandt, loyalty is all a Ukrainian needs.§!"

 UKR_Emil_Meynen: "Emil Meynen"
 UKR_Emil_Meynen_hog_desc: "§YRosenbergian Tendency§!\n--------------\n§LEmil Meynen, Leibbrandt's "scientific advisor", has claimed that he values science over all else. Tune in to any station and you will hear his soft-spoken speeches, explaining the intellect and vision behind Leibbrandt's policies. He sounds reasonable. Even sane.\n\nHis maps of the German people came with demands for foreign annexation. His maps of Austria helped lead the Wehrmacht through its blitz. His maps of the Soviet Union gave Einsatzgruppen a birds-eye view of the Final Solution. He is a beast of this machine, like any other ally of Leibbrandt. Meynen merely knows how to best play his part.§!"

 UKR_Peter_Kleist: "Peter Kleist"
 UKR_Peter_Kleist_sec_desc: "§YRosenbergian Tendency§!\n--------------\n§LPerhaps no one but Leibbrandt truly sees his vision for what it truly is. Meynen hesitantly follows it as part of his training. Schlotterer sees it as a vessel from which his models can be inserted. Kozhevnikov clambers up it for whatever power he can get. Only Peter Kleist, the hardened bureaucrat, comes close.\n\nA success story from Rosenberg's Ostministerium, Kleist first grew to prominence organizing Lithuanian collaborator armies. Now, he does just the same in Ukraine - but on scales his younger self could not even imagine. Kleist and Leibbrandt envision an army of collaborators on a scale comparable to the German garrison, organized under one command. The Wehrmacht is unsupportive - but for Rosenbergites, it is their dream made reality.§!"

 UKR_Gustav_Schloterrer: "Gustav Schlotterer"
 UKR_Gustav_Schloterrer_eco_desc: "§YNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LLeibbrandt's plans represent an enormous threat to the stability of capital. Plantations are soon to go under scrutiny and regulation on a scale unheard of in the Reich. It is Gustav Schlotterer's goal to make sure that the Ukrainian economy - and the systems which it is built on - survive such hardships.\n\nA deputy to Walther Funk and an intelligent economist in his own right, Schlotterer's plans are not the bombastic measures of Leibbrandt - they are the antidote. Schlotterer uses softer measures to force Ukraine towards the Reich, pushing the economy towards agrarian export over all else.\n\nMake no mistake, this is to Leibbrandt's liking. Certainly, the Reich can restore its reputation in Ukraine - but above all, the Reichskommissariat must remain functional.§!"

UKR_Peter_Kleist_for_desc: "§YRosenbergian Tendency§!\n--------------\n§LA learned polyglot, Dr. Peter Kleist knows English, French, Swedish, Polish, and Russian but has never forgotten the most important one of them all - German. First earning his doctorate in law, he would join the NSDAP and SS in the early thirties, soon becoming a vital part of Ribbentrop's staff for Poland and later the wider Eastern European sphere.\n\nPost-war, he would find himself in a variety of diplomatic posts before Bräutigam's unceremonious recall required Kleist to return east. He now serves as the Foreign Office representative for Ohlendorf's administration, a position he will dutifully serve in without the devious and politically motivated scheming of the reformist that preceded him.§!"

UKR_Gustav_Schloterrer_hog_desc: "§YNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LDr. Gustav Schlotterer earned his title with a paper on Marx's concept of the primitive accumulation of capital, an irony for a man whose life's work can be defined by the topic. A member of the NSDAP since it was unbanned and a senior civil servant, his lifetime has been mired in economics, from a journalist in the papers to the planner of a pan-European trade policy.\n\nIt is why his colleague Otto Ohlendorf has called upon him, knowing his expertise as the chief engineer of Germany's economic machinery within its Eastern territories, making him his de facto number two. Schlotterer understands his role well - the economy will take precedence in this colony from now on - everything else is but a secondary matter.§!"

UKR_Erwin_Weinmann: "Erwin Weinmann"
UKR_Erwin_Weinmann_sec_desc: "§YNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LFloating into the NSDAP under the wing of his older brother, Dr. Erwin Weinmann is the product of Nazi student activism in Tübingen, a zealot of the SD - a cog in Germany's Eastern exploitation regime. His young age was no factor in the swift accumulation of appointments and posts that would fill any Nazi careerist with envy.\n\nWeinmann's first assignment in Ukraine saw him head Sonderkommando 4a, previously responsible for the Babi Yar massacres. He returned as the Commanding Officer of SiPo & SD in Ukraine, a role that has made him a crucial part of Ohlendorf's cabinet. But as the main voice of SS orthodoxy in Ukraine, his hardline tendency contradicts Ohlendorf's own, making him dysfunctional if necessary for future ambitions.§!"

 UKR_the_herzogs_rage_desc: "Reichskommissar Koch is an exceptionally busy man, with political duties in the Reich proper, and therefore cannot reasonably be expected to spend considerable time in Ukraine. This has been true since before the West Russian War. Yet, the multitude of problems affecting the state cannot be denied, and so his presence is required for stabilization purposes.\n\nDespite his desire to be less involved, and his clear anger at being forced to attend our administration, he is here. As such, just like in years prior, we can expect problems to be decisively addressed."
 UKR_fuel_the_breadbasket_desc: "The purpose of Ukraine, of our administration as a whole, is to provide resources to the Reich. Coal, steel, and much besides yes, but above all of this lies grain. Ukraine feeds Europe, and as the continent grows ever-hungrier, so must we take steps to increase production and grain yield.\n\nThe result is not in dispute - the only question is how to accomplish it. From all corners of our government there are ideas, varying in intensity, dedication, and thoroughness. We will evaluate them and choose the one best suited to accomplishing our goal."
 UKR_mechanization_in_dnieper_ukraine_desc: "The agricultural lands of Ukraine in and around the Dnieper are, unsurprisingly, some of the most valuable and productive. The great river provides ample irrigation and, in turn, the lands provide nutrition for millions of the Reich's citizens. But they operate on farming principles of centuries past, and must be modernized if output is to increase.\n\nThey will be. Those farmers that accept the gifts given will be amply rewarded, and those who do not will be swiftly - and uncompromisingly - replaced."
 UKR_finish_off_communal_farms_desc: "None can deny that the communal farms - disgusting vestiges of communist practice though they may be - are very important to the agricultural sector of Ukraine. Until now, practicality has forced the administration to permit their existence - but no longer. Reichskommissar Koch has made his policy clear, and it will be enforced.\n\nWhat communal farms remain will be converted - forcibly if necessary - into cooperatives along the new models identified. These lands will, shall, and at long last, be brought up to orthodox standards."
 UKR_skip_noc_holdings_desc: "As the campaigns of modernization, reform, and improvement of Ukrainian agriculture - for the betterment of the Reich - continues, decisions must be made on where to allocate resources. These decisions are simple. The NOC, operating as it does, does not need state funds to create improvement, and thus will not be given them.\n\nThe cooperatives are, will, and must be the focus of the administration's efforts for they are, at least, directly controlled by it, which is something that cannot be said about the NOC."
 UKR_blood_from_a_stone_desc: "The many reforms and improvements necessary within Ukraine are, unsurprisingly, very expensive to implement. It is both unrealistic and unfair that the Reich be expected to pay for them, and so this 'burden' will be placed on the Ukrainians themselves - after all, are our actions not being undertaken to benefit these lands and their output?\n\nThere will be reasonable exceptions of course, as the Reich is nothing if not merciful. Sick, elderly, and disabled persons will be exempt - but everyone else will pay, and that payment will be enforced."
 UKR_thatll_keep_the_deputy_busy_desc: "Leibbrandt, for all his skills and connections, is a most difficult and tiresome individual, and Reichskommissar Koch has had enough. If the man cannot reasonably be removed or returned to Germania, he can at least be retasked in a more optimal fashion - and with tasks far from Kiew.\n\nThe agricultural reforms have been continuing, and who better to oversee them than such an experienced administrator such as he? There are many regional inspections and decisions to be made, and we can be sure that Leibbrandt will perform excellently in this capacity."
 UKR_reap_the_harvest_desc: "Ukraine hasn't always been the most manageable territory to pacify, but the rewards have been worthwhile! The cities are secure; the natives know their place, our enemies are irrelevant, and our men are determined. Generalplan Ost proceeds smoothly and on schedule, and none of it would have been possible if it weren't for the efforts of our wise, attentive, and noble Reichskommissar Erich Koch! Considering all he's done for us, we can all agree he deserves a nice, long vacation to East Prussia.\n\nHave a safe trip, Reichskommissar! When he returns, we can get the real fun started with a bang!"
 UKR_reinforce_the_strongholds_desc: "As it has for decades, the fight against banditry and lawlessness continues. We must support it by ensuring firm control over the regions that we do hold in strength. Places where the Wehrmacht and Ostdeutsche have established themselves, and where shipments of weapons and supplies can be trusted to be properly used.\n\nRowno, Kiew, Nikolajew, Hegewald - these are places from, when reinforced, we will radiate out from, crushing the bandits like the criminals they are. In doing so we will, finally and at long last, move to restore final order."
 UKR_support_the_gendarmerie_desc: "Unfortunate as it may be to rely on such subhumans, we cannot rule with Aryans alone. The Schuma, our native auxiliary police, are necessary to maintain order in the vast oceans of Slavic subhumanity existing beyond our few Aryanized strongholds. A steady string of defections, desertions, and losses to bandits have steadily chipped away at their number, but this will be no problem. We do not need to ask for recruits, we may simply take. The only thing standing between order and lawlessness is the Gendarmerie, and every subhuman auxiliary killed by bandits is an Aryan that did not have to be in his place."
 UKR_finish_up_the_third_phase_of_gpo_desc: "Our administration owes its fundamental existence to the auspices of Generalplan Ost, having been organized to execute its stipulations in Ukraine, and so we must adhere to the directives imparted to us. Our actions in recent years have held true to this and we are, at long last, able to move towards finishing its third phase.\n\nFinal administrative goals will be completed, suitable reports will be made, and in so doing we will prove the success of our mission. We will prove that Ukraine has held true to the Reich's goals - above all others."
 UKR_remind_diplomats_of_hitlers_decree_desc: "None would deny that there are many problems in Ukraine - not the least of which are the fractures in our administration brought about by political indecisiveness. The creatures from the Foreign Ministry think to give instructions to officials, and thereby confuse any response.\n\nBut no longer. The Führer decreed, decades ago, that the political direction and organization of Ukraine was solely the business of the Eastern Ministry, and we will remind them of this. As forcefully as is required."
 UKR_but_humble_the_selfrighteous_prussian_desc: "It would seem the haughty posturing of the Schuttstaffel is an issue even all the way out here, among the fields and crops of the Reich's Breadbasket.\n\nOhlendorf seems to have ideas in his head reaching far beyond his station, convincing himself that he was instrumental to the success of a settlement campaign during the GPO's third phase. Such a thing was only possible due to the providence of our dear Reichskommissar Erich Koch, not that the effeminates of the SS are ever wise enough to recognize this.\n\nIt would be very much in the best interests of Ohlendorf that his real responsibilities be... insisted upon; There is, after all, plenty of honors to be won in the culling of partisans. Or at least, enough to shut him up that he does not try to steal credit for Koch's triumphs out from under him."
 UKR_crack_down_on_the_termites_desc: "Despite years of effort at securing Ukraine, it remains a truth that bandits still infest the forests, swamps, mountains and, yes, cities, of the state. Displaced soldiers, rebellious peasants, abject criminals, and more flee justice and pillage the countryside with impunity. This must stop, and there is one man who can be considered to be responsible.\n\nOhlendorf, and the SS units under his command, must be charged with organizing police operations to fight and suppress these bandits and return order to the countryside. Otherwise, what is their purpose?"
 UKR_the_committee_in_our_grasp_desc: "Only a fool would ever think it possible to displace the Ukrainians entirely from some form of governance over this land - there are so many of them, after all. The Ukrainian National Committee will always exist, and should be empowered - but it will not, cannot, operate independently.\n\nThe Security Police and SD will be tasked with maintaining oversight and overwatch, cultivating informants, and otherwise ensuring that we are well aware of the Committee's actions and intentions, which we will provide to them regardless."
 UKR_this_is_not_enough_desc: "Every bandit killed, every Bolshevik rat's nest unturned, every UPA fanatic extinguished, every sentimentalist bureaucrat assigned to nowhere - all of it will be for nothing. Koch has seen the truth for what it is. Simply too much of the administration is staffed with the weak - Leibbrandt's weak-willed Rosenbergites, clinging to the old fool's dream from 20 years ago, Ohlendorf's sneering SS men, Bräutigam's treasonous suits; all of them fail to realize the Slav - "Ukrainian", "Russian", or otherwise - understands only violence.\n\nAnd yet, they cannot be removed at this time. Koch has seen the writing on the wall; he must receive approval and support from the Reich itself to restore true National Socialist governance to Ukraine, or the colony will soon perish. Fortunately, much of the Party, not to mention Hitler himself, shares such views.\n\nAll he must do is travel there..."
 UKR_a_visit_for_old_times_sake_desc: "Erich Koch was not always the Reich's principal authority in Ukraine; before he pacified this savage land, he was the Gauleiter and Oberpräsident of Eastern Prussia, titles which he still holds to this day. Indeed, Koch was quite fond of visiting his old stomping grounds; in some years, even spending more time in his Gau than the Reichskommissariat. And then those filthy Slavs invaded Moskowien...\n\nJust how many years has it been since he last saw Königsberg? Too long! The third phase of Generalplan Ost has been coming along just fine; his men can handle things on their own for a little while. Sure, some are worried about trouble back in Germania and here in Kiew, but it shouldn't be anything to worry about, and we can resolve the concerns once he returns."

 UKR_the_melt_of_rot_desc: "Reichskommissar Koch lies comatose in Kiew, and the state is assailed - from all sides and from sources too numerous to count. The natives shriek in rebellion as their partisans strike out at our soldiers and installations, factions within the Party bicker and sabotage each other, and both news and resupply from the Reich is increasingly scant.\n\nIt is clear that the progress of the rot that so many have said infests Ukraine is reaching its terminal phase. Decisive action in all spheres must be taken. We, and the state as a whole, must be ready to do anything, to sacrifice anything, in order to survive."

 UKR_politics_cant_be_silenced: "Politics Cannot Be Silenced"
 UKR_politics_cant_be_silenced_desc: "The petty squabbles of Party factions in the Reichskommissariat must stop! If we are to endure, we, the Party, must be united in purpose, and these artificial divisions must, will, be erased. Ohlendorf and Bräutigam will surely understand the need to put aside their opposition for the good of the Reich.\n\nShould they not, encouragement will be given through political concession, ensuring proper concern and review is given to the most critical parts of their future agendas. After the crisis is resolved."

 UKR_degenerates_amok: "Degenerates Run Amok"
 UKR_degenerates_amok_desc: "The weakness of the state can no longer be hidden, and our many foes are wasting no time in taking advantage. The Culturalist movement, the UPA, more violent fringe groups, and more are growing rapidly, and instability is growing just as quickly. Despite desperate need elsewhere, this problem can no longer be ignored, and so the SiPo will be empowered and funded to the degree necessary to combat them.\n\nThis will not solve the problem overnight and, at least initially, they will not be engaging the movements directly. But they can fight them indirectly, and we can avoid falling any further behind in this secret war."

 UKR_crumbling_throne: "The Crumbling Throne"
 UKR_crumbling_throne_desc: "As the state falls around us, one man and one position of power remains strong, if challenged. Leibbrandt, and his office, have the potential to centralize crisis response, but he and it are beset by numerous bureaucratic shortcomings and other myriad issues. They will be corrected through direct executive action, immediately, and his office will be empowered.\n\nIt is true that taking such action will elevate Leibbrandt himself, and expand his control - overt or otherwise - over the apparatus of government, but this must be accepted. There will be no government to fight over if the state collapses entirely."

 UKR_spears_below: "The Spears From Below"
 UKR_spears_below_desc: "While Ohlendorf, Bräutigam, and Leibbrandt are easily among the most influential parties in the state, there are others, and collectively those others hold far more power than many think. The SS, with their incessant demands for land, purity, and iron control. The collaborators with their pushes for ever-greater Ukrainian rights and autonomy. All of whom have goals that demand the allocation of resources.\n\nThose resources are, however, becoming increasingly scarce as time passes, and the worse this gets the more likely it is that they will consider taking alternative actions. We must be ready. We must be watchful."

 UKR_nats_west: "The Nationalists Westwards"
 UKR_nats_west_desc: "Though there are countless sources of instability in the East, we cannot afford to ignore or overlook the nationalist movements in the west either. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army are just as much a threat to national security as any of the other countless movements, and so reassigning some state security focus towards them will correct oversights far too long in existence.\n\nDigging out double agents, false collaborators, radical resistance cells, and the like should help us endure through these dark times. Once these times are past, true suppression can begin."

 UKR_bol_east: "The Bolsheviks Eastwards"
 UKR_bol_east_desc: "Despite the state's best efforts, over many years, the degenerate cancer that is Bolshevism still endures in the partisans and other insurgents that infest the eastern provinces. They have pillaged, raided, burned, and interfered with transits to the Reich for far too long, and must be crushed like the vermin they are.\n\nSending large contingents of security forces eastwards should, when combined with a suitable campaign of propaganda, allow us to finally eradicate them. Peace will be returned when these remnants are destroyed - if only because there is no-one left to break it."

 UKR_expand_kampfgrupe_ohlendorf: "Expand Kampfgruppe Ohlendorf"
 UKR_expand_kampfgrupe_ohlendorf_desc: "During the great crusade against Bolshevism, liberalism, and degeneracy, various SS forces coalesced into Kampfgruppen. Such units proved useful in an ad-hoc capacity on all fronts, supplementing the efforts of other forces.\n\nThey can be of use again. Ohlendorf shall assemble a new, expanded Kampfgruppe: Kampfgruppe Ohlendorf. This would assist the state greatly in prosecuting and protecting the upcoming trials. So it shall be done, regardless of what Leibbrandt and Bräutigam may have to say about Ohlendorf expanding his influence."

 UKR_revive_civil_authority: "Revive Civil Authority"
 UKR_revive_civil_authority_desc: "The extensive security crackdowns are causing backlash in our large urban areas, with increasing reports of civil unrest and general agitation. This cannot be allowed to continue - we simply do not have the resources to pacify major cities should they revolt, and so we must crush this sentiment before it grows.\n\nIncreasing police resources should help us in maintaining order, and further assist the SiPo in discovering and eradicating the influence of resistance movements within major population centers as well."

 UKR_sipo_infiltration: "The SiPo's Infiltration Tactics"
 UKR_sipo_infiltration_desc: "If we are to root out the degenerates, the insurgents, the partisans, and the outright criminals, we must do more than just attack them. We must infiltrate them, monitor their networks, determine what influence they possess, and only then rip them out, root and stem entirely.\n\nWe can order the SiPo to focus upon these tactics, using their 'uniforms,' cultivating double agents, encouraging defections, eliminating influence networks, and more, and in so doing ensure that we comprehensively annihilate them in the long term."

 UKR_consider_industrialists: "Consider the Industrialists"
 UKR_consider_industrialists_desc: "It is no secret to many that the state's relationship to the Industrialists has always been tempestuous at best, and outright hostile at worst. Their greed knows no bounds, and often interferes with political objectives. Yet, given the circumstances, we cannot afford to create more internal enemies, and we need all the help we can get.\n\nThus, the state will call in every favor it has with them, and provide every concession, in order to ensure increased production of military equipment and hardware - at least for the time being - and so ensure continued survival."

 UKR_our_most_important_tool: "Our Most Important Tool"
 UKR_our_most_important_tool_desc: "Without our collaborators, we would be dead in the water. Some may denounce this state of affairs, but as of now, it is how things are. Our long, tangled webs of collaborator mayors and policemen are the greatest tools in our arsenal in our war against banditry and madness.\n\nWe will augment these tools, creating new, loyal police units, replacing disloyal mayors, and putting a close eye on all of our collaborators. Once they are properly strengthened and on a tight leash, our task of bringing stability to this mess of a Reichskommissariat will become much easier."

 UKR_break_hierarchy: "Break Apart Their Hierarchy"
 UKR_break_hierarchy_desc: "We cannot hope to destroy the many partisan groupings within the state if we cannot dismantle their chain of command. Currently, we know far more about the eastern groups than the western, and so we can split resources accordingly in order to make the best use of them.\n\nIntelligence assets will be sent west, to further understand and discover those exact leadership structures, and direct action assets will be sent east, to liquidate those that we do know of. We will have to convince the SiPo's leadership that this is the best course of action, but that should not be difficult. They very much enjoy their job, after all."

 UKR_a_corrupted_system: "A Corrupted System..."
 UKR_a_corrupted_system_desc: ""The Breadbasket of the Reich! The Flawless Cog that feeds the New Europe!" is what we would proudly proclaim, our smiles rigid and tight as we desperately ignored the decaying, broken machine that is our colony's leadership. The old blood are too busy engaging in pointless hobbies, and the new blood argue about a problem and offer dozens of different, wild solutions to our political system.\n\nWe stare at a blue sky and argue about the semantics and what color that blue really is. Perhaps, if we can get the main players to sit down, we could reach an agreement? Not quite a peace treaty or a conclusion, but at least something that makes the tensions lower enough for us to settle the matter?\n\nWe're all civil people, after all. No one wants this discussion to become bloody."

 UKR_but_whos_to_blame: "...But Who's To Blame?"
 UKR_but_whos_to_blame_desc: "That being said, what is even common ground? We do not have a unified ground, the newcomers blaming all our woes upon Koch's system, a system whose veterans engorge upon and make sure it never changes to their advantage. They have the leverage but lack the momentum and the rabble-rousing the new generation has. An unmovable wall meets an unstoppable object, and until we find a unified enemy, we'll only be left to watch the fireworks."

 UKR_rot_within: "The Rot Grows Within"
 UKR_rot_within_desc: "Though there are countless external challenges facing our administration, the real danger is the systemic corruption corroding it from within. Native collaborators ignoring bandit activity, incompetence and graft on the part of officials, and rapacious exploitation for personal benefit rather than for the Reich are but a few of its expressions, and all threaten our control. If we are to maintain stability, we must take action to purge this disease."

 UKR_walk_eggshells: "Walk the Eggshells"
 UKR_walk_eggshells_desc: "Factionalism within the Security Council grows, and chaos within our administration grows along with it. Each fiefdom refuses to collaborate with the others, and is quick to react to any favoritism shown elsewhere. While this needs to be resolved, we must for now focus on what matters - keeping the state running - and to do that we must walk a tightrope, and maintain a balance of appeasement. We must keep the wheels turning."

 UKR_orthodoxy_kills: "Orthodoxy Kills"
 UKR_orthodoxy_kills_desc: "There is a vision for a purified Ukraine. But it shall have to wait. The security situation is nearing untenable, and it cannot be denied that current racial policy - informed by ideology and enforced with all the tools available - has united the general public against us. We must concede, compromise, and offer concessions in order to win them back. This will, of course, require negotiation with some of the administration's hardliners. But they can be won over. After all, when the bandits are weak and the security situation rectified, the policies can always return."

 UKR_the_unavoidable: "The Unavoidable"
 UKR_the_unavoidable_desc: "Europe careens towards disaster. It is not just us - every facet of the Reich has struggled in the wake of our Führer's sickness. Moskowien's death has been set in motion. Polish dissidents appear ready to spill over at any moment. Germany may soon fall prey to its own darwinistic excesses. Yet even if all of them make miraculous recoveries, one thing is clear - none of them are going to save us.\n\nWe must free ourselves from our delusions. A great battle is coming, and our goal - our only goal - is to make sure we survive. It is a subtle shift in policy, yet all at once a seismic change. No longer can we imagine a rosy future where the criminal class of Ukraine succumbs to reason. Partisans surround us - our only goal is to stomp them down until they have no more strength to fight."

 UKR_dial_other_brautigam: "Dial Up the Other Bräutigam"
 UKR_dial_other_brautigam_desc: "The Reich has abandoned us. It is hurtful to frame the cruelty of our leaders so bluntly, but it is a truth we must accept. Their lines of munitions run thinner and thinner by the day, dropping below even our dimmest projections on what they can offer. While we can't ascertain their reasoning, we are certain that their meager offerings will soon not be enough to stem the tide.\n\nHowever, our men on the inside might be able to propel us a little further. Hans-Otto Bräutigam's uncle is actually a respected diplomat in Germania. While armaments are certainly not his department, he might be able to pull a few strings and get us a little more. It won't be much, but it will be a lifeline. At this point, we take what we can get."

 UKR_take_more_no_cost: "Take More, No Matter the Cost"
 UKR_take_more_no_cost_desc: "The survival of the state is the only important task left to the Reichskommissariat. The welfare of the populace will surely be ruined by an all-out civil war - whatever we drain from them is far less than what Bolsheviks or deluded extremists will do if given the chance. Thus, we shall take. The Kampfgruppe will cross the nation, finding materiel to force into our war machine. Many powerful men will be angry, furious even, but there are few options left."

 UKR_last_calls: "Last Calls"
 UKR_last_calls_desc: "Ukraine must now be exhausted. Black markets can be called up, Moskowien smuggling rings can be activated, whatever we need, whatever we can. We must wring our government dry for connections, for wealth, for ideas. Anything that gets us another gun, another bullet, is worth it. Nothing is too small. Nothing is too risky. We are deep within a pit, and we will pull in as many guns with us as our fingers can reach. We are long past shovels - the only way we escape is if the hole fills with blood."

 UKR_more_everything_all_time: "More of Everything, All the Time"
 UKR_more_everything_all_time_desc: "It may be true that there comes a limit to what we can take. We have squeezed all we can out of Germany; it may simply have no more to give. Luckily, our creativity is an asset with no such limitations.\n\nIf we cannot get our firepower through smuggling or stealing, then it shall come from us - our own hands and our own factories. We will build these things with whatever we can manage, and whoever we can find. Temporary weapon production studios will be placed across whatever territory we might find some control, hoping to build enough supplies before a German boot comes to crash them. Even as we exhaust the last of our supplies, we will have a way of getting more."

 UKR_high_time_steel: "High Time to Steel Oneself"
 UKR_high_time_steel_desc: "It all ends tomorrow. The conclusion of the Polissian Guard's fight is one last battle, a struggle for life and death that may spell the end for the Ukrainian people. There is no more planning left, nor even organizing. The operation is over. The battle will now begin.\n\nInstead, we steel ourselves. We look over our work, and see that it is complete. We see our armies, standing calmly in a sturdy lockstep. We see our weapons, piled as high as we may need. We see our allies, all standing at our side or cowering with assorted devils. We see the cards we have been dealt, and can at last understand the odds of our survival.\n\nIn this moment, it seems we may have a chance."

 UKR_the_depth_of_decay_desc: "The Führer's death has generated shockwaves of instability across the Reich and its hard-won conquests, and our administration has been no exception. Mismanagement, incompetence, and treason have brought the Reichskommissariat to its knees; bandits run rampant across the colony under the banners of the old communist state, the mad mongrels of the UPA, or the rats of the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army, traitors to even their own cause. This must not stand.\n\nThe future of the Aryan race in the East and its conquests, the future of our very Lebensraum, depends on no one but us. It is not a time for reflection, or moderation, or weakness. The Slav must once more learn to know his place, or we shall perish."
 UKR_regroup_our_forces_desc: "Our commanders admit no contingency plan had predicted the sheer volume of bandits assailing us, and as such our men are dispersed across the countryside. As the uprisings of the 1950s showed, these isolated detachments are vulnerable to bandit assaults, and already many units have broken contact.\n\nCaptured, destroyed - or worse, defected; no one knows, but we cannot win a war like this. Concentrated in large formations, our troops will crush any force the bandits can muster; we must do so as swiftly as possible. The Wehrmacht has known nothing but victory in the east for twenty years, and that will not change here."
 UKR_our_lifeline_cut_desc: "Our calls for aid from Germania go unanswered, no matter how many distress signals we send back to the Reich or other Reichskommissariats. Our Fatherland has abandoned us, and we cannot rely on them to send us supplies or men to assist against the bandits. We are alone.\n\nOur men will have to steel themselves for a fierce campaign; this will be a much more challenging task than the revolts in the fifties. But, one way or another, we will return the Reich's order to this lawless land of degenerates and traitors."
 UKR_shelter_the_settlers_desc: "The fundamental goal of any Reichskommissariat, the reason we're here in the first place, is to settle the land with proper Aryan settlers in place of the various criminals, bandits, and other assorted subhumans squatting herein. Therefore, their livelihoods are our greatest priority, far above that of any mongrel collaborator.\n\nThe current wave of attacks against Aryan strongholds cannot be tolerated. We will now devote massive resources to protect our settlers; garrisons, armaments, trenches, walls, and fences, nothing will be considered inadequate. If we can get hold of some extra men from among the settlers we have saved, that will be all the better."
 UKR_restore_order_to_the_countryside_desc: "Ukraine is in abject chaos. Fortunately, the cities under the control of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine are still stable, since previous Reichskommissaren were at least able to successfully settle them with proper German colonists and secure those colonists' lives and liberty with strong police forces dedicated to their protection. But the countryside has lately been plunged into anarchy.\n\nThis has happened because various bandits have deluded themselves into thinking that Ukraine is anything other than a province of the Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation. This cannot be tolerated, nor permitted to remain as anything more than a mere slight setback. We will deploy our forces and make the bandit subhumans remember the fear we taught them during the glorious Operation Barbarossa."
 UKR_rebuild_the_government_desc: "That is not the only problem that we have. It helps us nothing that, because of the nature of our government, large parts of our administration are in the German Reich itself—which, thanks to this chaos, we have been cut off from seemingly indefinitely. The result of this is that many of the posts ordinarily staffed by people operating in Germany proper are effectively vacant even if the records claim otherwise.\n\nIf we are to have any hope of surviving this year without a collapse, we have no choice. We must find the few loyalists we still have and choose men from among them to fill these posts and allow our administration to continue operating until the connection to Germany is restored and the traitors are extirpated from these lands."
 UKR_to_the_strongest_desc: "From the outset in 1919, as our Führer Adolf Hitler taught us, the National Socialist system was always built on strength. It was this strength that sustained us through 1933 as the decadent liberals were thrown aside. It was this strength that invigorated us in our great war against degeneracy in 1939, and in our defence against the communists in 1941 and the 1950s.\n\nIn these experiences, the outcome was always the same: those without strength—degenerates, liberals, Bolsheviks, subhumans—were always cast down by the might of the Aryan people. This has not changed. It never will. There is only one man that can direct the will of the Reich in Ukraine—the Reichskommissar.\n\nAnd he will be whoever is strongest."
 UKR_utilize_spare_divisions_desc: "The Luftwaffe are an air force, not an army, so it makes sense that whatever field divisions they have—if you can even call them such—are many things other than competent soldiers. Others, less loyal to the Reich than we, say this in our ears day in and day out. They say we are better off putting our faith in that SS opportunist Ohlendorf.\n\nAre they mad?\n\nWe cannot give that man any more power than he has, 'lest he seize control of Ukraine and go off on his own merry way. The bandits shall be crushed and the spare troops the Luftwaffe can give us will be of great use. These troops' weaknesses are beneath our notice."
 UKR_mobilize_the_kampfgruppe_desc: "We are not completely without resources in the Reichskommissariat. Ohlendorf has prudently used the months before the complete collapse of law and order to expand his personal Kampfgruppe unit to deal with the growing bandit threat. These units have already shown some ability in combating the assorted criminals and bandits causing trouble in areas where Ohlendorf is active.\n\nSeeing as how the Heer cannot provide a realistic alternative, it is time for us to bring Ohlendorf's units into full action in our fight to restore order to the Reichskommissariat. He is to have all resources that he needs in bringing as many Kampfgruppe men to the front as he needs, no matter what the Wehrmacht might have to say about it."
 UKR_hungerpolitik_desc: "Not all has deteriorated in this Reichskommissariat since we took control over it from the Judeo-Bolsheviks. For one thing, the methods used in the First Hunger Plan that Backe drafted took care of any potential need to reshape the local demographics in the 1940s and 1950s. This frees us, therefore, from the need to modify policies across different types of Slavs, degenerates, and Slav degenerates.\n\nIn this new plan, which we might call the Second Hunger Plan or the New Hunger Policy, we will therefore have maximum leeway for control over food distribution. Useless communities occupied by pro-bandit forces will have food redirected to those who matter: Aryan soldiers and settlers. Obedient Slavs might get a little too, should they continue to serve their betters."
 UKR_bandenbekmpfung_desc: "Subversion abounds, and our rightful rule over the Ukraine is defied left, right, and centre. Across the lands of this our colony, assorted degenerates in the pay of foreign powers and global Judeo-Bolshevism rise up, slaughtering Aryan settlers and reimposing their 'ancient right' upon the land. Calling themselves "partisans" and "freedom fighters", they shake their fists at us and at the Reich.\n\nBut these "partisans" are little more than bandits hopped-up on one last power trip. No matter how much they might cloak themselves in "democracy," "communism," or "nationalism," we see who they really are. We have no patience for bandits and criminals, and we refuse to believe their lies about their innate "nobility" and the "justice of their cause". We will treat them as scum among scum, and use whatever means are necessary to return law and order to the Reichskommissariat."
 UKR_useless_mouths_desc: "We are surrounded by useless mouths here in our rightful land. These Ukrainians—God alone or the Führer knows where the hell they came from—still think even after twenty years of our enlightened dominion that they have a place in this country. The vast majority of those that remain oppose our agenda at every turn, and are a stumbling block to us no matter what role they play.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Ukrainians have confirmed themselves to be useless to our agenda. Supporting bandits, partisans, traitors, and degenerates at every turn, they consume valuable food and resources. But what if they didn't?\n\nWhat if we took their precious food that they "need" to survive and teach them a lesson they are not liable to forget? Some—even in our own administration—might call us monsters or fools. But our victory matters more than the opinions of cowards."
 UKR_the_good_ukrainians_desc: "We are surrounded by useless mouths here in our rightful land. But just as some microbes, a minority of a minority among so many nuisances and lethal threats, are said by the scientists to have a positive use, so it is that we have some loyal, useful Ukrainians under our rule. These sensible men, knowing the price of defiance, have instead chosen an elevated path. They have helped prop up our rule and even loyally obey their betters.\n\nWhile they are still a minority of their people, perhaps we should show them just a tiny amount of leniency, a miniscule concession made more tolerable by how few of them there are. Of course, we will still take what we need. But if they have more, then they can keep it. If they stay loyal. Hell, when all this is back to normal, we might even be able to give them back a little. But not too much. They are still subhumans."
 UKR_starvation_desc: "In the RK Ukraine we have succeeded in building a pure, National Socialist homeland for those that cannot find space in the Centre. Or at least that was the case before everything went to hell in a handbasket and traitorous bandits that we thought we had successfully eradicated started popping up everywhere again like returning boils on a body.\n\nReports flow in telling of ghost towns, their streets lined with piles of emaciated corpses. They say entire villages have been depopulated. Crops needed to feed thousands are instead being taken to feed the Wehrmacht. Even German settlers—for whom we began this entire enterprise!—are beginning to see the effects of this chaos. Ukraine, the alleged breadbasket, is starving to death, and we are why that is happening.\n\nSo long as we win, it does not matter. But that needs to be soon."
 UKR_destruction_desc: "Some time ago, reports flowed in telling of ghost towns, their streets lined with piles of emaciated corpses. We were told that entire villages have been depopulated, groups of ten or more going silent at a time. Crops needed to feed thousands were instead being taken to feed the Wehrmacht. We thought this was bad when we heard of it. Somehow it has gotten worse.\n\nVillages are literally gone, burned to ashes where at least there were structures before. Their inhabitants have been slaughtered or forced to flee, whether German or Ukrainian. In several regions there are mass graves far as the eye can see.\n\nDeath. Destruction. Ruin. The cities are not safe, and the wilderness is no improvement. There is no refuge for anyone, not even for our own people. There is only the light at the end of the tunnel—the light of victory. Whatever else we need to do to reach it, let it be done—no matter the cost."
 UKR_peace_in_a_million_pieces_desc: "Were we in a position to look at the situation in our own lands dispassionately, we might say, "Chaos umpire sits, and by decision more imbroils the fray by which he reigns: next him, high arbiter, chance governs all." As it stands, we have no time for philosophizing—all we can do is confront the fact that §xwe have failed ourselves, the Reichskommissar, and the Führer.§!\n\n§VEverything has gone wrong. Reichskommissariat Ukraine, backstabbed by its own alleged servants and subverted by Slavic degenerates in the service of Judeo-Bolshevism, is on the verge of total collapse. We can barely supply our forces, let alone our subjects. Our own settlers that we brought here cannot even eke out a living anymore, and our soldiers' situation worsens minute by minute.§!\n\n§eWe have been shattered into a million pieces.\nAnd more and more, it looks like we cannot put ourselves back together.§!"
 UKR_directive_no_46_desc: "On the 28th of October 1942, our beloved Führer, Adolf Hitler, issued a Führer Directive, his forty-sixth. Declaring that "in the entire eastern territory the war against the partisan"—that is, bandit— "is a fight to the complete extermination," he insisted correctly that "utter brutality" was needed. In those days, Koch and all those underneath him took to the Führer's commands with alacrity, to impressive effect.\n\nToday, with the Führer dead and Koch wounded, we must return to that old elevated and correct path. We must throw off the gloves and do whatever it takes to exterminate these pests according to the Führer's will. Either they will die, or we must—there is no room in this Reichskommissariat for us to 'coexist'."
 UKR_a_second_operation_hannover_desc: "Sometimes, a bandit does not think twice before defying the Reich to its face. Seized by some foolish notion of bravery, as if they were Götz von Berchlingen or some lesser local folk hero, they decide that they have to attack German forces head on. Obviously, they pay a price—and that is Operation Hannover in a nutshell.\n\nOperation Hannover was one of the Reich's main successes against partisan bandits. The degenerate fools sought a direct confrontation against our superior forces. They were obliterated by the Wehrmacht for their trouble, and partisan operations in the Smolensk region were rendered nonexistent for several years. If we manage to get the partisans to fight us directly rather than hiding away like the animals they are, victory cannot but come quickly."
 UKR_panacea_desc: "The food situation is unsustainable. We cannot feed a force adequate to crush the uprisings with our current allocation of resources, and what food we have is disappearing daily due to sabotage and banditry. The military situation is untenable—with bandits and subversives everywhere we look, how would it not be?\n\nBut we have a cure.\n\nIn the leadup to the Reich's great triumph against Judeo-Bolshevism, Herbert Backe and Georg Thomas devised a great plan to ensure that our forces could be fed and extraneous populations could be eliminated. Taking food from the unworthy, giving it to the stronger, the better to guarantee their survival in preference to their inferiors. With some changes, we can apply this to our situation and rescue ourselves from the pit."
 UKR_you_dont_get_to_choose_desc: "We have made ourselves abundantly clear, explaining the situation as if our Slavic interlocutors were five years old, but some men apparently still fail to understand the situation. These people somehow have deluded themselves into disagreeing with hard, cold reality—that the luxury of choice cannot be afforded while barbarians continue to knock down the gates.\n\nLet us say it to them once more. We will... remind the Slavic subhumans in our lands of their servitude to the Reich, and of their only choice—obedience. They have but one alternative to this: death. Weak though we are, we can provide that to them if they shout for it loudly enough."
 UKR_expand_the_una_desc: "The rebellion continues and the assorted traitors continue to make gains at the expense of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Bandits have proliferated left, right, and centre; our Ukrainian Wehrmacht cannot hope to sustain the fight against them on its own. It helps nothing that Germania, itself in chaos, cannot hope to take action or send us anything but 'fraternal National Socialist greetings'.\n\nIt galls us, but we have only one real alternative—the Ukrainians. We will move to bolster the Ukrainian National Army; not so much so as to become a tangible threat, of course, but just enough where it can be of use to us in our fight to pacify Ukraine."
 UKR_were_all_in_this_together_desc: "From the outset in 1919, as our Führer Adolf Hitler taught us, the National Socialist system was always built on unity of the Aryan people. It was this unity that sustained us through 1933 as the decadent liberals were thrown aside. It was this unity that invigorated us in our great war against degeneracy in 1939, and in our defence against the communists in 1941 and the 1950s.\n\nWhat does this lead us to conclude? There cannot be any response to a crisis but collaboration. Had the Volk not cooperated in its struggle against degeneracy and Bolshevism, how would it have triumphed? The administration of this Reichskommissariat is in its darkest hour. If we fight among ourselves to see who is strongest now, those weak bandits that call themselves 'liberators' shall triumph.\n\nThis cannot be allowed."
 UKR_silence_the_sentimentalists_desc: "We have done so much in Ukraine, building a pure, National Socialist homeland for those that cannot find space in the Centre. One would think that after such progress we would have been able to root out sentimentalism and demonic concepts of sympathy for the subhuman enemy that we are rooting out.\n\nBut no! It seems that not everyone is on board with our plan. Some weaklings bow to delusional concepts of "morality" (as if there was any other morality other than that which the Führer handed down to us), or of "winning over the populace" (as if there is any use winning over subhumans), and other such nonsense. We are National Socialists; letting these things hold us back is the height of folly.\n\nThis fact will be made very clear to the head of this gang of sentimentalist near-traitors, Hans-Otto Bräutigam. That man is on thin ice; the rest of the Security Council will not tolerate his endless ramblings condemning our policies. Best we warn him and give him one last chance—after all, he is still a German."
 UKR_corruption_desc: "We have done so much in Ukraine, building a pure, National Socialist homeland for those that cannot find space in the Centre. One would think that after such progress we would have been able to root out sentimentalism and demonic concepts of sympathy for the subhuman enemy that we are rooting out.\n\nOne would think that, despite this not being the case, our warnings and incentives to swear loyalty to the command of Führer and Reichskommissar would have sufficed. One would have thought—or, perhaps, hoped is more accurate—that we would have shut them up and purified the dross from National Socialism in Ukraine. But we hope in vain.\n\nNational Socialism is being corrupted. Rumours spread of quiet dissent to our handling of the war—worse yet, the people sent to rebuke them come away doubting our views. Sentimentalist sentiments, that we thought we had extirpated, are spreading like cancer throughout the administration.\n\nWe are diseased.\nVictory is the only cure.\nIt must come fast."

 UKR_a_flag_above_ashes_desc: "As the flames of the civil war die down, only one flag has emerged from the ashes of Ukraine: the flag of the glorious Reichskommissariat. Though the mongrel partisans tried to destroy German dominance of the East, the indomitable will of National Socialism allowed us to triumph over what seemed like an impossible force. With our newfound military experience, we must ensure that such a grave error must never occur again.\n\nWhile we may have declared victory over the rebels, the Breadbasket of the Reich is now a smoldering ruin. The plantations have been burned, the fields have been salted, many prominent German leaders were killed or forced to flee, and partisan remnants still lurk in the outskirts of the colony. Worse still, most of the infrastructure that made Ukraine into the breadbasket has been destroyed or repurposed into something entirely different, and it will take time to restore what was lost. While Ukraine may have returned to rightful German hands, it will take much dedication and effort on the part of its masters to restore the colony to its former glory."
 UKR_begin_hunting_the_partisans_desc: "While the Reichskommissariat has a clear hold over the cities and their surrounding lands, most of the partisans that were left behind have begun to hole up in their traditional hiding spots. This cannot stand. The partisans are beginning to train the next generation of Ukrainians to fight against their masters, and only the Wehrmacht can uproot and destroy these partisan cells before they begin to fester. The Wehrmacht may be tired, but it is their duty to the Fatherland to ensure the prosperity of Aryan colonies for present and future generations, which the partisans will threaten with continued existence."
 UKR_bring_back_the_breadbasket_desc: "Before the civil war, Ukraine was the Breadbasket of the Reich, producing millions of bushels of wheat for Germany and generating countless wealth for the owners of these plantations. During the civil war, however, plantations inside partisan territory were largely ransacked and looted. We must begin to reorganize these plantations for the benefit of the Reich and our administration. What exactly we will remake them into has been up for heated debate, with Leibbrandt, Bräutigam, Ohlendorf, and their supporters each having differing ideas on how to best rebuild Ukraine's best source of income."
 UKR_problems_in_the_field_desc: "The Wehrmacht, when under the leadership of competent and talented generals, is a force to be reckoned with, efficiently crushing all of its enemies under its heel with brutality and dedication to the National Socialist ideal. This is... not the case for Ukraine's Wehrmacht. The leadership is divided and orders are contradictory, which consequently means that the Wehrmacht does not know where to go and who to eliminate. This has made the anti-partisan campaign toothless and horribly ineffective, and the three men in the Council are of course bickering amongst themselves. While all three recognize the need for collaborators to help iron out the flaws, the real question being tossed around by the Council is which group of collaborators to send. Leibbrandt, Bräutigam, and Ohlendorf all have separate groups that they back, and have come to an unhappy stalemate in the Council. For Ukraine's sake, we must hope that they make up their minds on who to send, and soon."
 UKR_matters_of_priorities_desc: "Reconstruction has hit immediate snags as the bureaucrats are forced to stretch their miniscule budget to the breaking point in order to rebuild this vast colony. Most areas of Ukraine have barely felt the effects of the Reichskommissariat's reconstruction efforts, and this lack of progress is both angering German settlers and feeding the partisans with new recruits. With the Council once again unable to come up with a comprehensive plan that appeases all parties involved, they have instead decided to give a sole bureaucrat an extremely limited version of this power, in order to let them decide how to best rebuild Ukraine without fear of Council stalemates. The question is simply: who?"
 UKR_something_is_broken_desc: "A critical impasse has occurred between Leibbrandt, Bräutigam, and Ohlendorf. Slavery, the UNC, and the economics of the Reich, the resolutions of which are crucial for the future of the Reichskommissariat, have remained unresolved, and to the Council, are practically unresolvable. The three men have come to the conclusion that a truly comprehensive revival plan is an unfeasible goal, and now each of them has taken to resolving the issues of Ukraine in their own way: through pitiful, meaningless, and often contradictory emergency dictums. These dictums often cause more problems than they fix, and are worthless in the face of the multitudes of maladies that the burning Reichskommissariat is suffering from."
 UKR_a_corpse_on_the_throne_desc: "Andriy Melnyk, the Chairman of the Ukrainian National Committee, is dying. Though this fate eventually comes to all men, the timing of it, in this instance, is highly problematic. Under normal circumstances the Reichskommissar would force a successor, but with the current state of instability none can be agreed upon.\n\nMelnyk himself refuses to make a decision, and as he declines further, those in the state administration must ask themselves why they are serving. Leadership is required, and if the Council cannot give it, it will be sought elsewhere."
 UKR_a_task_left_unfinished_desc: "Despite best efforts, the partisan problem has not only not been contained, but indeed has grown. The respective failures of the Wehrmacht, the SS, and the UNA have allowed the formerly leaderless extremists to regroup, rearm and, most dangerously of all, reorganize.\n\nThe groundwork has been laid for an insurgency that could last years, or longer, and those men of the Reich who have families here fear for their future. They also, worryingly and increasingly, cast blame upon the Council."
 UKR_a_pile_of_directives_desc: "As the dysfunction within the state continues, so too does it affect the bureaucracy. Conflicting 'emergency actions,' delivered by opposing parties, have paralyzed general administration and governance to such an extent that the Reichskommissariat seems to many to have been efficient in comparison.\n\nThere is no solution as of yet, and the collective anger of thousands of bureaucrats, directed towards the Council that they blame for not having yet solved this problem, continues to grow. There appears to be no end in sight."
 UKR_a_land_left_scarred_desc: "Continued devolution in governance has all but incapcitated both the plantations themselves and even the basic infrastructure they rely upon for operations. Low revenues have rendered them unsustainable, and there appears to be no plan - or no ability - to save them.\n\nThough the state's industrialists all agree that a solution is needed, in order to salvage their fortunes and livelihoods, none can agree on what that solution is, and time is rapidly running out for all."
 UKR_a_nation_without_kings_desc: "The country is exhausted. By conflict, by disorder, by famine, and by much more than that. Above all, what the people want is stability. Peace. Yet none can be found. In Kiew, every element of the government is divided, quarreling over issues large and small alike, and the violence only escalates.\n\nThe Reichskommissariat must have rule of law restored to it, and as long as the Council reigns, it is now evident that this restoration will be near-impossible."
 UKR_grinding_to_a_halt_desc: "It is over. All attempts at reconciliation between the factions within the state have failed, any deals possible have either been made or fallen through, and any possibility of further cooperation has been exhausted. There is no longer any action that can be taken.\n\nAs the apparatus of state seizes up, and then fails, all that can be hoped for is the sudden appearance of competent leadership.\n\n§RBefore everything falls apart.§!"

 # Koch Mini-Chain
 UKR_intro_chain.1.t: "A Glimpse of the Past"
 UKR_intro_chain.1.desc: "Erich Koch lingered in his office, surrounded by the folders and maps he had not cared to examine. Outside, scattered footsteps rang out. The day was done, and Koch could leave at any moment. Yet he could not help but examine a single photo of his desk. A picture of the Reichskommisar on the first day of his assignment. Where was he now?\n\nThe Reichskommissar that fateful day, when a train ripped him away from his native Prussia to serve in Rosenberg's newest colony. How hideous the land had seemed as it smeared past his cabin window. Yet when the train arrived, the air was crisp and clean; verdant fields filled his view. For a single moment, it almost felt like a home.\n\nIt was shameful. How long had he strung himself along on that fleeting moment? How had he allowed this land to deceive him, to let him believe he could sculpt it into an Aryan paradise? No native starvation nor partisan massacre ever managed to bring back that sensation. When Koch came home that day, he would arrive in the stiff bed of a foreigner. Perhaps that was why the office brought more comfort.\n\nTwenty years later, the Reichskommissar remembered so little of that day. Year by year, Koch had let that world slip through his hands, as the true nature of his colony crushed him. Now, he could barely bring himself to work at all. In that moment, Koch had felt like the Earth was his to conquer. That violent, hopeful energy was gone now, and gone forever.\n\nAt the end of the day, Koch only wished he had done more. He wished he had found every Ukrainian who dared to speak, every liberal who dared whine, and ripped their throats from their necks. If he had known then the world of dogs that he was being shuttled into, he wouldn't have spent a moment in that dream. He wouldn't have dared let himself be fooled. Two decades of meaningless violence, and all Koch could think of was wading further into the blood."
 UKR_intro_chain.1.a: "As if the blood didn't surround him already."

 # Bräutigam Event
 UKR_intro_chain.2.t: "A Bureaucrat's Bureaucrat"
 UKR_intro_chain.2.desc: "Hans-Otto Bräutigam unlocked the door to his office and walked in. It was dark, the only light coming from the rising sun's dim rays that slipped through the aluminum mini blinds. Hans slid his hand across the wall, looking for the light switch, flipping it upwards as he found it. His office now illuminated, the young bureaucrat sat down at his desk, placing his coffee upon a coster and pulling up his sleek new typewriter. For the next few hours, only the sound of work could be heard from Bräutigam's office. While other older officials in the Foreign Ministry office arrived late, chatted with secretaries for hours, and left for long lunches, Hans never left his desk.\n\nThe name "Bräutigam" is not a new one in the Reichskommissariat. Hans' uncle was the previous Representative of the Foreign Officer, having left the colony for a more lucrative job as one of Theodor Oberländer's allies in the Reichstag. As he left, Georg Leibbrandt rose to the position of Deputy, leaving the post of "Representative of the Foreign Office" open. Wanting to keep a finger in the Ukrainian pot, Otto recommended his nephew to the position. Nepotism at its finest.\n\nExcept while most relatives of an elite given a job in the bureaucracy would laze about their post, Hans worked feverishly. In his mind, he had a lot to prove. He had been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a change in the Reich's troubled breadbasket. A change his uncle was too cowardly to make himself. Hans finally allowed himself to take a break, standing up to stretch his legs. He hooked a finger on the window blinds and pulled down, looking into the smog-choked skyline of Kiew. The young Hans, approaching his 31st birthday, imagined that eventually, he would become head of this colony. Probably not anytime soon, but someday. After that, he'd show Germania that the people of Ukraine are worth more as brothers than slaves."
 UKR_intro_chain.2.a: "A good man or a naive fool?"

 # Leibbrandt Mini-Chain
 UKR_intro_chain.3.t: "Master and Servant"
 UKR_intro_chain.3.desc: "The old manor of Georg Leibbrandt lacked the corrupt decadence of his fellow bureaucrats, but it held a splendor all its own. Facing the northern shores of the Black Sea, the manor was beautiful and stark, a symbol of the Bismarckian standard of bureaucracy which Leibbrandt held himself to at all times. Leibbrandt so rarely took days off that the manor had become a sort of vacation home for him, a space to clear his head when the meagre stresses of deputizing grew too great.\n\nIn the past months, Leibbrandt required such escapes increasingly often. The Reichskommissariat was failing, and no matter how many desks he pounded on or people he yelled at, few of his subordinates rose to even basic competence. Seeing his old house reminded him of better times, both real and imagined, in the face of an increasingly grim future.\n\nThe deputy took a moment to admire the sweeping fields of his estate. Ukraine, his homeland, stretched out beyond him. National Socialism should have saved it, purged it of all of its racial deficiencies and Judeo-Bolshevik masters, lifted it into a new age. Instead, unthinking beasts like Erich Koch forced it back into squalor. Leibbrandt had so many plans, so many ideas, and he would likely join his country in the dirt before a single one was enacted.\n\nLeibbrandt sighed. As he approached his front door, a group of Ukrainian servants skittered about, preparing for his entrance. Leibbrandt turned to one and snapped. "You - do you feel that there is something wrong with the Reichskommissariat? Answer honestly."\n\nThe servant froze. "Of-of course not, Herr Leibbrandt. Hitler has saved Ukraine, made it... pure."\n\nLeibbrandt scoffed at his servant. "If you're not going to tell the truth, take my coat to my office. I'll be writing.""
 UKR_intro_chain.3.a: "The servant obeyed, relieved that the situation did not escalate further."

 UKR_intro_chain.4.t: "Deputy and Führer"
 UKR_intro_chain.4.desc: "Drafts of a letter piled around Deputy Leibbrandt's desk, the result of hours of feverish writing. Finally drained of his endless urge to write, he had turned to a decaying atlas in his shelves, aged from almost thirty years of use. Slowly, reverently, he admired the twenty-third page - a map of Ukraine.\n\nIt was in this book that Leibbrandt, heading the Ostministerium decades prior, first conceived of the Reichskommissariat, of its divisions, its demographics and its leadership. In his plans, it was supposed to be a transitory stage towards something better, more stable, more free. Instead, Leibbrandt was rejected, and his delicate system was transformed - or more accurately, allowed to degrade - into a system as unstable and brittle as the Soviet Union that preceded it. Even now, when given a second chance, Germania seemed doomed to make the same mistake.\n\nIn his hands, Leibbrandt held the latest draft of the letter he had been endlessly rewriting. At the header: "Letter Of Resignation." It gave him a perverse joy to consider the thought. He imagined Koch fuming as his hands filled with the drudgery which Leibbrandt always did in his stead, regretting ever having dismissed this vital piece of the Reichskommissariat. Leibbrandt, happy and healthy, finally at rest-\n\n"Rest." A great wave of guilt came to Leibbrandt, waking him from his fantasy. To even consider a resignation was shameful, a disgrace to his race and his intelligence. National Socialism was his savior, leader, and master. He would show his utility to the Third Reich, no matter how much it protested, complained or fought back. It was his duty."
 UKR_intro_chain.4.a: "For Ukraine had to be saved."

 # Ohlendorf Event
 UKR_intro_chain.5.t: "Under a Shadow"
 UKR_intro_chain.5.desc: "Rarely would Otto Ohlendorf venture beyond the comfort and sanity of his own office, for he knew exactly what awaited him outside the scattered bastions of National Socialism he called home; memories. This, however, was very important. It was imperative that Ohlendorf was here, even if every fibre of his being demanded he return to sanctity.\n\nGunfire echoed through the street a block away, far from Kiew. How the UPA managed to get a foothold in a city like this was simple, though the "authorities" surrounding him assured that they couldn't have known how something like this would come to pass. Now, they controlled two apartment complexes and were taking potshots at police. Kriminalpolizei, specifically. Apparently, it was the SiPo's off day, and it was starting to show in the four wounded men crying on the street. The shared pool of blood which soaked their clothing continued to spread along the filthy concrete, and the sporadic gunfire from the windows sparked a rotting feeling in Ohlendorf's guts. Of course, it had come to this. Had his ethics been followed by Nosske, then perhaps such things would not be happening within his jurisdiction. Of course, such a word as "ethics" had never found its way into that stain of Ohlendorf's Einsatzkommando.\n\nRaising his binoculars, Ohlendorf made out the silhouettes of three rebel riflemen, all clad in black fatigues and red-black patches. It seemed fitting that wherever Ohlendorf fled, the SS lurked close behind, like a bad memory he just couldn't shed.\n\n"Herr Untersturmführer? Place riflemen in those windows there-" Ohlendorf pointed to buildings opposite the complexes. "-and eliminate the men with caps before those with helmets.""
 UKR_intro_chain.5.a: ""And tell the Orpo to get its shit together.""

 # UNRA/Republic Mini-Chain
 UKR_intro_chain.6.t: "Lighting the Torches"
 UKR_intro_chain.6.desc: ""You wanted to see me?" Ivan Dziuba's voice was wary as the door gently fell shut behind him. The corridor of light from the hallway closed with it, leaving him and Yuriy Horlis in the dim glow of his desk lamp in the unassuming office. He offered a half smile and nodded.\n\n"Yes, come in. I think we both know what this is about," Horlis answered. With the last few words, his smile faded. "I believe it's time to make our move. This is the perfect storm we've been waiting for," He tried not to look pleased at the prospect of his proposal. He certainly wasn't giddy, but the thought of progress still brought him satisfaction.\n\n"I was hoping this would be about that. In fact I was about to suggest the same - rarely do we get a situation where the people are so angry and the government is so weak. Others have been talking about it, too. I suppose they've been getting tired of just taking bites out of the fascists."\n\n"Most don't sign on with a resistance movement to not resist anything, and I have to share the sentiment. Well, rest assured they'll be getting their revolution soon."\n\nBoth men went silent, trying to reconcile the gravity of the matter with the gratification of finally finding their chance to strike. It certainly wasn't a dour occasion, but anything above would be in poor taste. Not to mention the fear of failure that always tagged along behind hope for success. Dziuba tapped his knees with his fingers, then said, "So what's next?"\n\n"Pack. We head to Brest to inform the rest of the leaders, make sure it's unanimous, and then get organizing.""
 UKR_intro_chain.6.a: ""I'll be there.""

 UKR_intro_chain.7.t: "Answering the Call"
 UKR_intro_chain.7.desc: "Vasyl Stus examined the sheet of paper in front him, which was as blank as his stare. He'd been trying to write something down for the past hour, but focusing was virtually impossible between the chill of the room and the surfacing news. His head had been swimming, drowning more accurately, ever since Horlis had made his intentions clear and the word spread to Galicia and the UNRA in whispers. It was time for them to act, and Stus to lead. The future had never felt so immediate, and even if the future was one he was looking forward to, the steps to it were unclear and uneven. Putting his thoughts on paper usually helped him, that was his profession after all, but he was too caught up in his own mind. He was too distracted with his work, or lack thereof, to notice Taras Borovets' third knock at his door. Nevertheless he gave it another go, which startled Stus back to attention.\n\n"Right, come in," He said, shuffling his papers to the side. Borovets stepped inside. His brow furrowed as he registered Stus's anxious expression.\n\n"Nerves?" He asked as he claimed a seat, "I expected you to be excited, frankly, the firebrand you are. Come, let's see how we can be of use to the cause."\n\nA bit of fire returned to Stus's eyes, "I figured we'd up recruitment and strengthen the propaganda front, get the people ready to act and save Ukraine. I trust you have plans for the military side of things?"\n\n"Some. Higher recruitment like you said and more aggressive actions, perhaps set to work with some proper military discipline..."\n\n"Seems like there isn't much need for discussion, then. I'll meet our organizers, you meet your men, and we'll set to waging our little war.""
 UKR_intro_chain.7.a: ""Simple enough.""
 
 UKR_intro_chain.8.t: "Laying Out the Welcome Mat"
 UKR_intro_chain.8.desc: ""Are you sure curtains are enough, Oleksander?" asked Volodomyr Bahaziy as he closed the aforementioned blinds, the grey Brest street outside vanishing behind the cloth.\n\n"Curtains, Volodomyr? I'd like to think you're not reducing my efforts to curtains. I've found the most secluded meeting room in the building, and found the rest of the movement back doors to get in," replied Oleksander Ohloblyn, "So I wouldn't call it just curtains. I think we'll be fine."\n\n"It still doesn't feel all that covert to be doing this in a Reichskommissariat meeting room. In the heart of Brest, no less!" contested Bahaziy.\n\n"Bah, those Germans are too busy with their squabbling and the riots to notice a little meeting like this. You really don't need to be as cautious as you are, old friend, I-" Ohloblyn was interrupted as a small gaggle of resistance leaders filed into the room followed by several more until just about every man was there, exchanging greetings from the curt to the friendly. The room was consumed by the dull murmur of conversation. Most esteemed of the guests, earning many handshakes and warm welcomes was Yuriy Horlis.\n\nThe men settled into their seats around the table. The room was certainly showing its age, from the peeling wallpaper to the coffee stains on every surface. Still, expressions of hope rested on the faces of the gathered, between the occasional glare or cough. "Good evening gentlemen," said Horlis, and in an instant there was silence, "I'd like to thank you all for attending, and our friends Volodomyr and Oleksander for prepping this room, because the time has finally come. The time has come for action, for the return of prosperity to Ukraine..." With that, he began to spin his yarn to deliver a speech, with hope and a plan enclosed."
 UKR_intro_chain.8.a: "Here's hoping both become a reality."

 # U-SSR Mini-Chain
 UKR_intro_chain.9.t: "A Purpose Unending"
 UKR_intro_chain.9.desc: "Outside of Kharkiv, there was a sorrowful grouping of dilapidated factories, empty and deemed hazardous and unusable by the German authorities. Most of its workers were dead: killed by the many famines the city had experienced, fled west or into the swamps, or simply went as most did into the hollow and emaciated remnants of the city. Anything useful had been pilfered, leaving the rest to rust and crumble, to be viewed only from a distance and as yet another meaningless ruin amongst what was once a bustling metropolis. Within these snow-covered structures, where must was the smell and the empty coldness of a tomb was the sight, lay the last remnant of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic.\n\nOleksandr Shumskyi's face was only illuminated by a single gas lamp, while his 'office' of iron sheets and curtains remained dark and obscure. Shumskyi's eyes slowly moved to the next paper in his pile. He missed music, that would make it better, enlivening this dungeon and lightening the rhythmless drudgery. Shumskyi picked up yet another paper, a report.\n\nScenes of devastation; charred bodies, crushed skulls, burning homes, and burning churches; a retaliation expedition, the report said. Shumskyi had seen it all, and not just in pictures. He hated to admit it, but he thought it all stale now. Women and children - even that note could not break his heart any further. What had the raid that had prompted this massacre accomplished? A few rifles and boxes of bullets, already at the cost of ten men. Shumskyi felt his surroundings grow colder. This couldn't go on. Recruitment was nonexistent, and the younger generation cared more for their next handful of bread than freedom.\n\nNo. Shumskyi straightened. The raid may have ended in massacre, but that only proved that if their oppression continued, death would be their fate. Those men hadn't died in vain, those bullets would pierce the brains of the murderers of their countrymen, Shumskyi was as sure of that as he ever was."
 UKR_intro_chain.9.a: "All we have is hope."
 
 UKR_intro_chain.10.t: "The Old Commissar"
 UKR_intro_chain.10.desc: "Andriy Richytskyi had been anxiously waiting at a safehouse near the border with German-occupied Mykolaiv for hours before a frenzied announcement of success from the partisan detachment in the city came over the radio. When the operation had been suggested, at a spur of the moment, most of the Central Committee had been apprehensive about it, except for him, and its success had seemingly vindicated his view - that, for all its material advantages, the German occupation administration was vulnerable.\n\nWith a new confidence, he turned to his secretary Vasyl Drozdenko. "Send the word." Drozdenko quickly went to work, compiling a list of the dizzying array of underground partisan groupings, clandestine exile circles, and secret factory cells that would need to be contacted in order to reconvene the party as a cohesive organization capable of commanding a new revolution. He saw a bit of himself in the younger man - Drozdenko was not particularly sophisticated in his understanding of Marx or Lenin, but he had the devotion, the energy, and the willpower required of the professional revolutionary.\n\nNot that Richytskyi lacked those qualities. He was old now, but the past twenty years had done nothing to dim his convictions. From his own time in the USDRP organizing revolution against the puppet Hetmanate in the closing days of the First World War, to forming the UKP out of disgust at Petlyura's increasing conservatism, to the lessons Lenin and Skrypnyk had impressed on him, to his fights with Russian chauvinists in the Union, Andriy Richytskyi had come to view his life as singularly devoted to one task. There could be no decay, no compromise, no corruption of the goals of the Revolution. He would ensure this, at any cost."
 UKR_intro_chain.10.a: "Our Party, like any other political party, strives after political domination for itself."

 UKR_intro_chain.11.t: "To Never Again Lose a Generation"
 UKR_intro_chain.11.desc: ""Laying our hopes down to some sort of collapse is the exact line of thought which lost us Filkov and Petrovich and countless other young men! The Reich is as strong as ever, their units are replenished regularly, and we can't even harass supply lines anymore!"\n\nMaksym Korniychuk thought the meeting was going swimmingly, as in it hadn't already ended, which most in the room seemed to want.\n\n"We have nothing, then! We can't feed our troops, defections are rising, and the people here don't even speak Ukrainian! There is no national feeling at all it seems, much less class consciousness! Raiding is the only thing that excites the men!"\n\n"Probably because all of your 'men' are common murderers and bandits wearing old uniforms!"\n\n"That's enough!" Korniychuk stood above the other commanders, who all immediately yielded. "We all know our failures. We stare them in the face daily. How many countless times do I wish Filkov had lived, and I had not ordered him to raid Kharkiv? Those photos of Petrovich dangling from a tree still haunt me. We all have made mistakes, that is the only thing I know surely. Our failure hangs over every village we plundered for a few chickens while the whole nation starved. It hangs over every city ringed by ruins. It hangs over the graves of men we ordered to their deaths. It hangs over me, heavier and heavier with each passing moment!"\n\nThe whole room was silent now. Not a man averted their gaze from Korniychuk's steely visage.

 UKR_intro_chain.12.t: "He That Rages"
 UKR_intro_chain.12.desc: "Late at night the Vozhd of the Ukrainian Nation, one Dmytro Klyachkivsky by name, sat alone in front of a desk stolen from the office of a German official. Years of plans and reports lay in front of him—the past, the present, the future all reduced to handwriting and the odd printed manuscript.\n\nKlyachkivsky's mind wandered. The Azhdaya that was the OUN had come far since those early days of being backstabbed by the Polish scum—and then taking the golden opportunity provided by the German invasion to avenge themselves forevermore, as was their right. But for seventeen years or so now, the father of Klyachkivsky's movement, Stepan Bandera, had not been there to watch their progress—\n\n—for the German bastards had taken him to a concentration camp, never to return.\n\nThe Vozhd wondered: what would Bandera feel about how the OUN, no, the UPA, had done since his departure? Would it give him pride? Hope for the future? Or would there be merely a sense of disappointment—or, worse yet, anger and rage?\n\nDmytro Klyachkivsky would never think of admitting it to anyone, but such thoughts disturbed him beyond belief. Sometimes, they even made him wrathful."

Whereas, Stetsko knew, Klyachkivsky might take the opportunity conferred by such a setting to succumb to intrusive thoughts about what Bandera's corpse thought of him, Stetsko had better things to worry about.\n\nWriting out strange diagrams and the ideological screeds for which the UPA knew him best, Stetsko wondered about how best to test out the loyalty of his seeming allies, Piasetsky and Maivsky. Would it be prudent for him to take them aside someplace, or to meet with them in his own home? Would it be more opportune to rather secure others' loyalty, the loyalty of Piasetsky and Maivsky's confidants, then look into winning them over?\n\nFor that matter, Stetsko wondered, then how would he deal with the rest of the UPA, if and when a breakdown or a conflict took place? Shaking his head vigorously, he focused on the specific things he was planning.\n\nThe pen shook in Stetsko's hand as he scribbled out the latest plans. There was something big in the man's mind, and he was very clearly eager to see it brought to completion. If someone were to peer into the room, only one thing was clear—"

Wounded soldiers groaned around Shukhevych, and only a few looked likely to recover. A doctor, himself repressing tears or rage, had just told him that a majority of them—if not all but the strongest—were certain to succumb to infection unless resources that definitely could not arrive in time were present.\n\nHow it disgusted him. What was the point of anything if the soldiers that were to fulfill the goals of the UPA were falling down like so many flies?\n\nHow it enraged him. So long as incompetence and ideological hair-splitting remained a priority, what choice would the soldiers of the Insurgent Army have but to fall down dead?\n\nThose thoughts oscillated back and forth in Shukhevych's head; by their repetition, they forced him to begin to resolve that something had to change."

It was at Leibbrandt's insistence that the Reich's anthem played before each official meeting - as good a reason for backroom dealings as any. Horst-Wessel-Lied was an ugly, tired march, an ode to a man who died a thousand miles from Kyiv. Yet every note was drilled into the Chairman's head.\n\nIt was an embarrassment. How had Melnyk become so weak, so able to fall in line? Konovalets' OUN took independence as its first principle, its first demand. It had a spirit that appeared untamable. Under Melnyk, it had lost everything - its beliefs, its independence, even its name. Subsumed by the Ukrainian National Committee, the OUN was left a mere faction, doomed to eternally rubber-stamp whatever whims Leibbrandt most felt deserved an audience.\n\nSome of his followers still maintained a degree of control. Sushko's influence in the UNA made him irreplaceable. Stsiborskyi's plans envisioned a free Ukrainian nation that most had long forgotten. Shtul fought for the Ukrainian people in ways that the rest of Melnyk's followers were too cowardly to attempt. None escaped their station. At the end of the day, they still listened to the same anthem.\n\nAnd then, one by one, they threw their hands in salute - to the Reich, to the Führer, to every soldier who tried to slay the Ukrainian people. An ocean of hands, rising above a doomed nation."

 UKR_intro_chain.16.desc: "Usually, the Reichskommissariat kept Shandruk and Ohloblyn far away from each other. Ohloblyn, as mayor of Brest, worked only a few miles from Ostland's borders. The UNA was never deployed so far west - its handlers feared defections to the Banderists or democrats, probably correctly. Thus, the meetings between Shandruk and Ohloblyn were short and irregular - unusual punctures in two disconnected monotonies. That is why Ohloblyn's request for a meeting in Brest seemed unusual.\n\nThe discussion started out nicely. Shandruk and Ohloblyn walked through the isolated forests, talking about their lives, their posts, and most importantly, their woes. There were few times a Ukrainian in the employ of Germans could complain; Shandruk felt a sense of ease finally talking to someone he knew was a friend.\n\nIt was only after they were deep in the forest that Ohloblyn's mood suddenly shifted. "Have you considered the possibility of... working with outside parties?"\n\nShandruk paused, visibly uncomfortable. "So that's why you wanted to meet outside. I certainly see myself retiring someday, if that helps," the general said wryly, uncertain if such a thing was even possible. "If the world permits it, I'd love to return to a life of memoirs instead of, well, this. But while I can - and, I think, do - implore Kyiv to do better, I can't jeopardize whatever progress I've made here by venturing off on heroics."\n\nOhloblyn turned towards the general, disappointed. "You could save Ukraine, you know."\n\n"Or I could kill it. I'm in my 70s - I'm too old to be making rash decisions."\n\n"And I'm 63. A better Ukraine isn't going to fall into our laps.

It didn't matter. Most things didn't matter anymore. He had stopped counting the number of times he had been sold and transferred after his last comrade from before the war got purchased by a different master. The last vestige of the joy he had experienced as a free man had been ripped away. Now, it was replaced by the broken mentality of a slave, fighting to stay awake as he worked just so he might live for one more day.\n\nA nameless farmhand carved through the fields of grain, gathering food that he wouldn't be allowed to eat. Instead, his German master would take enough to turn a profit before handing the rest over to the tax collectors. Every now and again the slaves would get the decaying scraps of the previous season's harvest, but more often than not they went hungry together. He accepted his new life and didn't resist, because he knew not to bite the hand that fed him, even if it was his hand that fed the Germans.\n\nA nameless secretary collected together a stack of papers on his desk into a pile before handing it off to the man in the black uniform leaning over his desk. "For the Herzog. It's the report he requested on the different attempts on his life over the past months."\n\n"I still don't think it's good for Koch to stress over this.

Adolf had been struggling to keep up with the quotas since the last time they were raised. Being asked to make more was out of the question, even for a farm the size of his.\n\n"Sir, with all due respect, I don't think you understand. This farm can only produce so much grain, and I'm making as much as I can. I'm already working my slaves half to death trying to get them to meet the current demands, with the native farmhands not far behind. What you're asking for is impossible."\n\n"I'm sure that you'll manage to meet the quotas, the same as everyone else," the official said, looking down at his clipboard and scribbling a quick note. He looked up, giving Adolf a glassy-eyed stare. "Is there anything else?"\n\n"Officer, I simply can't make these new quotas. If I push my fieldhands any harder, they're going to start dying in the fields as they work-"\n\n"Then I suggest that you find some more." The officer clicked his pen and abruptly extended a single arm, offering a handshake while smiling coldly.\n\nAdolf took his hand, knowing better than to refuse an offer from a party official. "Sir, I really think-"\n\n"It was a pleasure seeing you, Herr Adolf." He gave Adolf's hand a quick, steel-gripped shake before straightening his suit and walking down the front steps of the porch, returning to his black Volkswagen.

 UKR_intro_chain.19.desc: ""Where do you think you're going, whore?!"\n\nKyi bit back a curse as he instinctively ducked into the mouth of a nearby alleyway. Down the street, the usual group of Hitler Youth thugs were once again harassing some poor girl. He had attempted to time his trip to the bakery well enough to avoid them, but now they were standing in between him and his home, plus they were bullying this woman. He tucked the bread into his coat and picked up a hefty stone that fit nicely in his hand. Peeking out of the alleyway for a moment and aiming for the biggest kid he could see, Kyi chucked the rock at him and ran for it.\n\nHe sprinted down the alley, dodging trash and hopping puddles before ducking down a side street, finding himself in a dead end face to face with a towering wooden fence. If there was any way he was going to get away, this was it. He clambered over, doing his best to protect the bread by landing squarely on his back.\n\nKyi heard the clattering of boots passing by, but was too transfixed by the sight in front of him to think about it. He found himself in a courtyard littered with posters, notices, and graffiti. "Workers of Ukraine, unite!" "Live and die for the republic!" "A Ukraine ruled by Ukrainians!" One poster fluttered off of the wall and towards the ground, but Kyi rushed forwards and snatched it out of the air. Printed across the front of the sheet was simple black text: "Imagine a free Ukraine."\n\nKyi tried to do just that. What would a free Ukraine mean? Would it mean a Ukraine where he's free to eat a meal every day, rather than splitting his loaf of bread with his sister? Would it mean a Ukraine where his sister was free to go to the store by herself without being harassed by the Aryan thugs every day? Would it mean a Ukraine where he could leave Kyiv whenever he pleased, instead of being stuck here for the last 15 years of his life? Kyi wanted to find out."

He decided to look for something about the Ukraine that he was never taught, but Kyi soon found himself wandering in circles, unsure of where to look for such a risky item, or even if such an item existed anymore. As Kyi grew more sure of the futility of the search, an old man pointed at him and beckoned him over with a gnarled, twisted appendage that, many years ago, must have been a finger. At wit's end, Kyi shuffled over to the old cripple, who he knew as Taras.\n\n"Looking for something, Kyi?" he croaked, keeping a steady eye on his prospective customer. Kyi spoke, slightly louder than a whisper.\n\n"I'm looking for anything about..." He looked around, apprehensive to sharing his quest with a stranger. In hushed tones, he continued, "About the history of Ukraine. I want to know what happened before the Germans. What was Ukraine, before all this?" He gestured around vaguely, perhaps towards Kiew, perhaps towards Ukraine. Grinning a half-toothless smile, Taras hobbled over to a nearby trash heap, dug around for a moment, then hobbled back over to Kyi, carrying a dusty brown package. Kyi held out the stolen pack of his father's cigarettes, which Taras took as he placed the package in Kyi's hand.\n\n"Slava Ukraini," Taras whispered. "Now get home, before you get both of us shot!" Taras chuckled dryly, as he leaned back to watch the young lad sprint off towards home. Needless to say, this was all highly illegal. As soon as Kyi returned home, he hid in his room and tore the packing to get to what was inside: a book. On the cover, in soft grey lettering on a dingy yellow background, the words "The Complete History of Ukraine and Her People" shined through the grime. Kyi spent the night, and a better part of the next morning, reading intently through the old tome."

What people had been before him, what great men and women shaped the land he called home? Such questions in a schoolroom would end with his family being enslaved - or worse - and any attempts to pry the information from his Father had ended in stern dismissive platitudes about a son's duty to his family and the price they could all pay for young Kyi's curiosity. His questions would remain unanswered over a supper of bread and cabbage stew.\n\nSulking silently in his bedroom, Kyi was thinking of ways to learn the truth when he heard shouts from outside. Quickly, he stowed the book under his bedding, and peeked his head over the windowsill to view the commotion outside. To his horror, an Opel Blitz had parked in front of a neighboring building. However, to his great relief, the unloaded soldiers headed instead to an adjacent warehouse, far away from Kyi and his treasonous thoughts. After a moment, and as suddenly as Kyi could duck and cover behind the wall, a series of shouts, a cacophony of gunshots, and the hollow din of a small explosion filled his buzzing mind with ringing.\n\nNot more than half of a minute had passed before everything was still and quiet again. Kyi, after much consideration, peeked his head back above his cover, only to gaze upon the remains of a dozen German soldiers, laying bloodied and ravaged in the dirt streets, lit only by the dim glow of a distant streetlamp. The Opel Blitz was gone, and not a soul was to be seen.\n\nKyi wondered, with a still rapidly beating heart, what he had just witnessed, and who would dare to be so brave as to assault a garrison. The thought of Ukrainians fighting for their homeland against an oppressive regime filled Kyi with a new feeling, one he could not remember feeling for a long, long time: hope."

After finishing the book for the second time, Kyi went out for a walk. It was well past midnight, and the patrols were scarcely a concern under the cover of a moonless night. Even if they were, Kyi only thought of the partisans he saw the other day, and of his role in the great story of a future Ukraine. He found himself at the banks of the Dnieper River, pondering what he could do, not knowing what he could do, let alone what he wanted to do.\n\nAs he began the trek home, a familiar voice called out to him. Taras, from under a nearby bridge, had once again beckoned him near and tried to compel Kyi to confide in him. Ceaseless questions regarding the book, his thoughts, his desires, his worth. Kyi dodged all the questions, tactfully giving curt and vague answers, revealing his inner confusion. Then, as he tried to leave again, Taras shouted out to him.\n\n"Remember your people, Kyi! Remember your mother!" Kyi had never known his mother, and his curiosity once again got the better of him. Now, it was his turn to ask question after question. However, Taras was not so timid in his answers, and told Kyi about his mother's torture, rape, and murder. He went on about the screaming, the whimpering, the wrenching sobs, and the gunshot. He did not enjoy telling the truth, nor did Kyi enjoy hearing the truth. By the end, Kyi had made up his mind. He didn't yet know who he would throw his lot in with, but he knew that he must fight against the Germans in any way he could. As Kyi started home for good, Taras yelled one last bit of encouragement:\n\n"Never forget your roots! Never forget your people's history!"

However, Koch's secretaries would soon realize the cause of his joy when he sent them a message: he would be leaving for East Prussia in the next few days and would spend a few weeks up there.\n\nAs he furiously packed his belongings, a smile remained plastered on his face. Koch had spent the past 20 years stuck in this miserable position of Reichskommissar of Ukraine and having to deal with the natives and his fellow Germans alike. All of them seemed ready to pounce upon him and eat him alive like vultures at the slightest showing of any sort of weakness. Now though, now he could go back to his adopted home. Memories of his time as both Gauliter and Oberpräsident of East Prussia filled his mind as he continued to back.\n\nBack in those days, before Barbarossa, before being appointed to this backwater of a Reich, he had been the one in charge of the region and second only to the Führer himself. He had purged his domain of poverty and unemployment, and East Prussia had become a beacon of prosperity for the entire Reich.\n\nAs he finished packing his things, he looked towards his desk and thought of something. Perhaps this vacation of his could be an opportunity? Perhaps the Reichskommissar could pull some strings to not only be able to resign from his position, but to get his old titles back in East Prussia? Erich's smile grew ever wider as he prayed to God that what he plotted would come to pass."

However, just like beer from a broken mug, information seeps outside of where it was supposed to stay.\n\nOn any other day, with any other secretary, or with any other Reichskommissar, it might have been a different story. But on this day, a patron walked out from that bar, finished his drink, and mumbled something about how even Koch was abandoning this hellhole.

Despite his elation that the day of departure had finally arrived, Koch curtly informed the chauffeur that he would be driving his own car, and that he only needed his bags moved. The chauffeur left, and Koch excitedly leapt as quickly as his age would allow after the young man, eager to become airborne.\n\nAside from the increasingly warm disposition of his office staff, nearly nothing had happened in the office since he had announced he was leaving. It was slowly driving Koch mad, but he kept his composure knowing that soon, very soon, he would be aloft and away from this miserable place. Happy thoughts were on Koch's mind as well; the cliques he lorded over abstained from their typical bickering, the Resistance Activity Reports had slowed to an insignificant crawl, and partisan activity was gleefully minimal. Had it been any other day, Koch would have noticed these quiet discrepancies and would have been disturbed. However, in a mere 45 minutes, it would no longer be Koch's problem - not until he eventually returned from Ostpreußen.\n\nOn any other day, Koch would have noticed the small crowd that had gathered to see him off, but he was beyond caring. As soon as the trunk was shut, Koch had shut his door and began to reach for his keys. On any other day, he might have waited for a brief moment to relish in his delight. On such a day, he might have heard the hushed ticking of a timer, mechanically counting away at the seconds and minutes and hours since it had been set. Alas, today was not such a day. Instead of hearing his car turn over, Koch heard the sharp click of the ignition, followed by the deafening sound of a bomb igniting."

 UKR_koch_bombing.4.desc: "Kiew did not have time to grieve for its dying leader, nor Ukraine time to cheer. New oppressors arrived in a mad dash, breaking apart the crown of their king and building new empires from his bones. The Reichskommissariat, dying but orderly, was suddenly thrust into madness.\n\nIt started with the deputy. Leibbrandt wasted no time in taking Reichskommisar Koch's place as best he could, spewing the empty puffery that constituted his typical leadership. Citing "precedent", citing "order", he donned the uniform which had never been meant for him.\n\nYet decades of irrelevance could not be overturned in a day. Leibbrandt was a useless, vestigal figure, and had been for half a decade. For Bräutigam, Leibbrandt's reforms were hollow, ready to be pushed aside by a new generation. For Ohlendorf, they were actively damaging to the threads of German society. To both, and to many others in their factions, life under Leibbrandt seemed simply intolerable.\n\nSo, forced together by circumstance, the diplomat and the policeman forced Leibbrandt's hand. Together, they came to the deputy with a plan to share power, as leaders in a temporary "Security Council". Leibbrandt would head the government, but now as head of a larger body of leading German officials, of which a considerable number would be on the side of his newfound enemies.\n\nLeibbrandt did not even have time to panic. He simply smiled, winced, and signed off on the papers.\n\nThis was how Ukraine came to be conquered by all, yet governed by no one."

 ## 7.3.0 - PRE-UCW FLAVOR EVENTS NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED ##
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.1.t: "The Father"
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.1.desc: "From his first days on this earth, Pieter van Norden had been raised to believe that the purest life was the thoughtless life, and that a pure life was all that matters. Born in Amsterdam just a year before the war, his childhood was molded by a world of radio programs and Hitler Youth counselors. A blitzkrieg of propaganda crashed through the walls of his mind, and day-by-day holding onto the past became harder and harder. By the time he landed in Moskowien with a rifle on his back, he had firmly taken the easy way out.\n\nYet grasping those fascist values was an act done for more than mere convenience, as unthinking as it was. Pieter's German fluency, his Wehrmacht rank, his growing kill count, all these gave him a meaning that his family and friends in Holland could not match. Those in his community were losers, chained to a corpse. Pieter was the perfect Aryan soldier, contributing to a Reich that would long outlast the failed state it had absorbed.\n\nEventually, Pieter's service ended with a shot to the shoulder, and he was asked to begin a new task: settling Ukraine. It was a new ideal to aspire to, and Pieter jumped at the opportunity. Quickly, he found himself a wife in an old flame from secondary school, and rushed off to a homestead near Kiew to begin once more.\n\nNow, he has found his new routine, tilling and harvesting, waking at sunrise and sleeping at sunset. It is far from his urban life in Amsterdam, but Pieter does it all the same. Perhaps if he stops, he might realize how far he has drifted from all that he knows, how lonely and empty his new land feels. But he will not stop, for thoughtless momentum is the way of the Reich, and Pieter van Norden is the Reich's favorite son."
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.1.a: "Work and Work Forever."

 UKR_VanNordenIntro.2.t: "The Mother"
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.2.desc: "In appearance, Antonia van Norden was a distinctly Aryan woman. Her eyes were a pale blue, not striking but always pleasant. Her hair grew blonde and straight, a shining waterfall when it was not forced into a bun at the top of her head. Her limbs were long and slender, elegant and worthy.\n\nIn a past life, it was a beauty that had brought her a life of her own. Before the market crashed, Antonia spun in a whirlwind of suitors and adventures, an endless party on the streets of Amsterdam. It all ended with Pieter, the one man strong enough to finally pin her down.\n\nUkraine was a new life, a quieter life. It was calmer here. She woke up, kissed her husband good morning, and began to cook a hearty breakfast. She walked into town to buy some supplies, and returned in time to help with the weeding. She read a story to Markus, kissed her husband good night, and crashed into her bed.\n\nYet deep in her mind, Ukraine was destroying her. Her hair was growing faded and frizzy, her eyes beginning to sink into a web of crow's feet and bags, and a thin layer of muscle growing from all the time she spent in the field. She spent far too long in the bathroom, staring into the mirror. She could feel herself rotting."
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.2.a: "Before she slept each night, she prayed her family could not tell."

 UKR_VanNordenIntro.3.t: "The Son"
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.3.desc: "Markus van Norden was a lovely child, with a button nose and curly blonde hair. He was quiet and helpful, adept at following orders like his father and skilled at avoiding discomfort like his mother. His heart was wide and shallow, ready to be filled by those around him. He only rarely cried.\n\nAntonia often worried he may soon grow sullen. She nervously scouted the neighborhood for possible friends, and found few children that Pieter would accept. She looked into Markus' eyes, and saw a great abyss, and one which needed to be filled as soon as the family could allow.\n\nPieter fretted over his weakness, over the child's small arms and wobbling step. The Reich had great expectations for its children, both their role and their abilities. Markus could not be left behind by his nation. When he saw his child cry, Pieter could barely exist in that moment. He could only imagine the grave emptiness of a man who cannot serve their nation, or aid their family.\n\nMarkus understood none of this. He looked up to his family, and saw them as pure - he could see no other possibility. He fussed with his toys and ate his dinners, and took little note of the nervous glances his parents always seemed to share."
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.3.a: "Only years later did he come to understand his years in that farmhouse."

 UKR_VanNordenIntro.4.t: "No Updates"
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.4.desc: "Out of the dining room and into the kitchen, the last notes of the NSDAP anthem blared through shrill speakers, an assault on the eardrums. Pieter van Norden sat in an old wooden chair, his head bent towards the radio. His whole face was caked with sweat. He could not help but look down, in a mix of shame and fear.\n\nOut of the radio came the news: bandits, likely aligned with Judeo-Bolshevik forces, had attempted an assassination of Reichskommissar Koch. He had not perished - the newscaster said that he was far too strong to die. Yet the NSDAP officials refused to clarify Koch's current state. It was a clear sign of an awful fate, and a source of endless, undying concern.\n\nAs the day passed, Antonia watched as the news crumpled her husband. It had left the man unfit for labor on a crucial harvesting day, and impervious to any consolation. Koch was a good man, she tried to assure him, but the Reich has many more to send. Pieter only responded with a harsh command to leave him and begin dinner.\n\nPerhaps it was a kind of trauma, Antonia thought to herself. Despite herself, part of her worried it might be a more fundamental weakness. As she worked over the burning oven, Markus at her side, a thought remained in her mind:"
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.4.a: "Pieter could not stay with Koch forever."

 UKR_VanNordenIntro.5.t: "A Children's Story"
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.5.desc: "Markus was sent off to meet in a classroom many miles from the farmhouse. It was always exciting to go to class, to meet his fellow Germans, even if class was mostly long and he didn't get to play as much as he wanted to.\n\nThis class was history, and Markus felt very good at history. His dad loved to tell of history, a long and circular story of exciting wars and boring empires. But today's lesson was special, for the teacher promised to tell the class about Ukraine. It seemed this class was very important.\n\nYet the class made little sense to Markus. His teacher told the class that Ukraine was a province of the Reich - once full of Ukrainians, but now full of healthy, Aryan Germans. Yet Markus had seen many Ukrainians near his house, and there were no Germans nearby for him to play with. Why had he been forced to live with the Ukrainians? The Ukrainians were no fun - Papa seemed to think they were barely humans at all. Could he move to where all the other Germans were?\n\nMarkus wanted to ask the teacher about all the Ukrainians near his home. But he knew what a teacher might do to a child who spoke out of turn, and thus he said nothing."
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.5.a: "Yet the lesson never felt right."

 UKR_VanNordenIntro.6.t: "Markus's Kingdom"
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.6.desc: "As his mother and father argued over the finances, their eyes slipped from dear Markus and set him free. He slipped out of a crack in the front door, and jumped into the wheatfields surrounding his home. His adventure began.\n\nThe boy explored the land like a new continent. He felt everything within his senses - the air, the dirt, the insects, the grain. He claimed it all for himself, and claimed more with every step.\n\nMarkus's flight lasted only a few minutes. Antonia soon noticed her son's absence, and saw the door idly bending in the breeze. She shouted his name from the porch, and saw him as a shifting form in the rolling wheat, near the forests where some said partisans lay. She leaped upon Markus, and pulled him back into the farmhouse.\n\nBut he recalled those fields that night, and for many nights after. He dreamt his bed laid in that field of amber, and that the flies and beetles swirled around him, a crown for their master. He dreamt of bending the stalks in his hands, and of his bare feet pressing into the dirt."
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.6.a: "A kingdom, waiting for his return."

 UKR_VanNordenIntro.7.t: "The Target"
 UKR_VanNordenIntro.7.desc: ""Pieter?"\n\nPieter van Norden was bent down into the fields around his home, a rifle shaking in his hands. The wind was blowing hard, and stalks of grain blew in and out of his view. He stared down the barrel of the gun, and took a shot at the haystack.\n\nIt whizzed past the haystack and into the forest beyond - a bad shot. A murder of crows burst from the foliage.\n\nPieter began to speak, his hands still firmly pressed around the rifle. "My aim is weak today... my skills have dulled since the war, Antonia. The partisan threat is real - I need to hone my skill once more. Do not distract me."\n\nAntonia bent towards her husband, frowning. "Pieter, this land isn't safe. Without Koch and Hitler to contain the Ukrainians, they are forming armies - the Council is considering evacuating this entire region. You must know that your riflery cannot save this farm. You could be the best shot in Ukraine, and that still couldn't-"\n\nFinally, Pieter's eyes gave a slight glance towards his wife - as if a housefly. "Antonia, that is enough," he said coldly. "This is far beyond your station. A Wehrbauer is a settler, an Aryan individual with the will to move mountains. I can do all that the Reich requires - or I deserve nothing."\n\nHis feet shifted in the muddy dirt below him. He turned towards his target and fired off another shot."

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.2.t: "Art Is Dead, and They Killed It"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.2.desc: "Halyna, hunched over a box in the cellar, read the last two words of the poem, the signature of the author. Ironically for a poet, it was messy chickenscratch, but Halyna already knew what it said by handwriting alone. Danylo Nosenko. She abandoned what had initially brought her there, a search for an old sewing kit, and headed back up the stairs, leaving the basement turned upside down. Grinning, she approached her husband with purpose she hadn't felt in ages. He was characteristically buried deep in a book in the kitchen. He lowered the tome slightly to get a look at his wife, who presented the poem to him. "You wrote this, Danylo?"\n\nDanylo gently took the crinkled old paper and ran his eyes over it. His lips curled into a bittersweet smile, "You liked it, then?"\n\n"Liked it? Danylo, it's one of the greatest I've ever read," replied Halyna.\n\n"I never thought it stood out from the rest of my work," said Danylo dismissively, placing it aside. He could tell what his wife was getting at just by the look in her eye, and braced for the coming words.\n\n"I just think it's powerful. Have you thought about contacting one of your old friends in the underground? Getting it published? People need to hear this now more than ever!"\n\nDanylo removed his glasses, shutting his eyes to rub his nose, visualizing the lifeless faces of dozens too idealistic to live. Shame, fear and grief boiled in his chest. "I'm sorry, my love, but I can't risk it. Don't you remember what happened to Maksym? The Reich kills men for things like this, we have to face that this world they've created is no place for art."\n\n"They would never know, Danylo.""
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.2.a: ""Someone always does here, Halyna.""

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.3.t: "Shovels"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.3.desc: "The shovel was heavier in Halyna's hand than she was used to. She wondered to herself if that meant she was getting older or hungrier. Probably both, she thought. Buying new equipment for the farm was always a pain, stealing her scant savings away from her and sending her on an unwieldy trek home.\n\nHer day continued to worsen, not just from the relentless, icy rain that turned the dirt road home to muck but additionally the flock of people crowding one of the few paved roads in town. As she neared, she heard a sound that made her blood boil. A German marching tune, coupled with the malevolent growl of truck engines, the ominous grinding of tank treads and uneasy, scattered applause from the wary crowd. With no way around, she waded through the throng to the curb where she could see the rather pathetically sized parade: four of five tanks, perhaps two platoons of men, a few outdated and rusted old trucks, and a military band that was struggling to breach the noise of the vehicles. Around her the crowd was clapping, some with genuine intensity and others with stilted insincerity. A man behind her nudged her, encouraging her to join in. She shook her head, gesturing to her shovel.\n\nUnable to leave, her anger only further simmered. It was nothing but a march of walking memories of waking nightmares. Their pace evoked the first march into the little town so long ago, the way they'd let the curtain fall on her home and suffocate it in misery. Their faces reminded her of the way they had spat on her and her people every day of their lives. Such hate and yet such pride. Worst of all, the trucks reminded her of Danylo's rare stories of the camp, before some old friend turned collaborator had bailed him out. She thought of his scars, like an abused animal. She was glad he was at home, not here. Obscenities tried to climb up her throat, so she bit her tongue. Violence crossed her mind, how satisfying it would be to let Nazi teeth fly with her shovel. She couldn't do that; she couldn't make Danylo a widower. She was all he had. Instead, she grinned until the last man passed, and walked home muttering."
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.3.a: ""Scum...""

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.4.t: "Security Matters"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.4.desc: "A series of knocks made both of them turn their heads. Danylo frowned as he stood, while Halyna warily turned her attention to the door. A few explanations entered Danylo's mind - none of them good. They weren't expecting any guests, and the only possible visitors were ones who spelled trouble.\n\nIt was why he wasn't surprised to find a police officer on the other side of the door. It was an older man, with a square face, grizzled features, and of a large physique. "Good afternoon, officer," Danylo said, keeping his voice polite. "How can I help?"\n\nAlways be proactive. Always be cooperative. Give nothing but compliance. It was the only reasonable approach when it came to law enforcement. The officer nodded slowly. "We are tracking partisan activity in this area, and require any information you have about their whereabouts. We've had reports they've been seen around this residence."\n\nDanylo didn't know if it was a trick or not, but it didn't change his answer. "I try to avoid trouble, officer. If there are unknown people around my house, I know as little as you."\n\n"You are certain you have no knowledge at all?" The officer pressed. "Many partisans are not just in the streets. They hide among civilians, obscure their politics-"\n\n"Yes, officer, I am certain," he interrupted. "Both my wife and I eschew politics, and have no desire to involve ourselves in them. We'll let you know if we see anyone suspicious, but I'm sorry, I can't tell you what you want to know."\n\nThe officer pursed his lips, obviously dissatisfied with the answer, though he seemed to realize that he wasn't lying. However, it didn't stop him from giving one final warning as he turned to leave:"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.4.a: ""We take security seriously, Mr. Nosenko. The moment you see something, tell us - or there will be consequences.""
 
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.5.t: "Black Nights"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.5.desc: "The best nights were ones where there was little to no natural light. These nights only occurred when the moon was dark, or clouds covered it. Halyna had learned to watch for such nights, and when they happened, to take advantage of them. They didn't know when the next one would come.\n\nShe'd remembered concern and fear she'd felt the first time she'd snuck out. Not for herself, but what might happen if Danylo woke up and feared the worst. Fortunately, he was a heavy sleeper, and she was less nervous when she slipped away into the night now. Not that she was gone for very long.\n\nThe package she clutched tightly wasn't large. It was mostly canned goods she'd hidden away over the course of a couple weeks, along with a few loaves of bread. It wasn't much, but she knew the local resistance needed every little bit. She knew she wasn't the only one who was giving them such packages either.\n\nAll of them needed to do their part; herself included.\n\nShe kept in the shadows, keeping a keen ear open in case she heard any cars or German patrols. Eventually, she turned into a small alley where one of the partisans was waiting; a young boy who knew to meet her when the moon was dark. She didn't know his name, she didn't ask, and she didn't want to know more.\n\nAll she did was hand him the package, which he quickly took, giving her a quick, quiet, but heartfelt "Thank you." He quickly slipped away; she did the same and didn't let her guard down until she was back in bed with her husband.\n\nHer sleep afterwards was always better, as she knew that more packages like hers were being delivered across the city. She was glad that the resistance would last just a little longer because of her help."
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.5.a: "Liberation would come, one donation at a time."

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.6.t: "The Weight of Guilt"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.6.desc: "The dinner before him was tasteless, and his appetite nonexistent. Danylo had wondered if he would feel better in the hours after the encounter with the youth, but if anything, the feeling of guilt and regret had only entrenched itself further. He wasn't doing a good job of hiding it either, and it seemed like his wife was finally going to ask.\n\n"Do you want to tell me," she finally said, putting her fork down. "Or do you want me to guess why you're been moping all day?"\n\nHe picked at his meal, his voice halting; as if confessing. He supposed that was what this was. "There was a young man. Trying to hide from the police. A partisan I think, at least that's what he looked like. He wanted to come in." He didn't look his wife in the eye as he finished. "I told him to move on."\n\nA heavy silence fell over the dinner. Danylo finally looked up at Halyna, whose expression was upset - but mostly disappointed, which only made it worse. "You shouldn't have done that," she finally said quietly. "Even if we can't hide him... you could have given him a meal."\n\n"I know," he said quietly. "I should have done something."\n\nHalyna's face softened, and she took his hand. "There is nothing that can be done now. All we can do is pray that he is safe. We can do that much."\n\nPrayer was perhaps something that was too late now, but perhaps it was not. Perhaps a miracle could happen, and perhaps a prayer would assuage the guilt. Both of them bowed their heads, and offered a prayer for the young man - wherever he was."
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.6.a: "Neither expected to ever know if their prayer was answered."

 UKR_NosenkoIntro.7.t: "One Single Spark"
 UKR_NosenkoIntro.7.desc: "There was a spark in the atmosphere that Halyna hadn't felt in a very, very long time. At any other point, Danylo would tell her she was just being jittery. But everything was different now. Everyone had heard about Poland - and everyone knew what it could mean.\n\nThe atmosphere everywhere was charged. Fear and uncertainty in the eyes of the Germans; excitement and hope in the eyes of everyone else. All of Ukraine was holding their breath, waiting to see what would happen next.\n\n"You know what this means," she told Danylo over breakfast. "If Germany has lost control of Poland... if their stranglehold has broken there, then their power is broken and they know it."\n\nShe couldn't help the excitement spilling out of her voice; emotions long-suppressed rising to the surface. "Ostland, Ukraine... even Moskowien... they're afraid that it might be over. If there was ever a time the Reich could fall..."\n\nShe trailed off, as if finishing the sentence would somehow prevent its manifestation. There was still a hesitance; a fear that this would end in doomed futility, and this hope was an illusion. Yet the expression on her husband's face was almost serene, and without a hint of uncertainty. He smiled.\n\n"It's 1917 again," he finally said, his voice musing. "Even if it ends the same as before, I don't think there is a better year to repeat. Tyrants cannot be unchallenged forever."\n\nShe strongly agreed, and hoped that Poland was the first domino that would send the German empire crashing down. And if it fell, perhaps something better could finally rise in its place. Throughout the rest of the day, her smile never faded. The faint embers of hope had been fanned-"

 UKR_BohdanIntro.1.t: "The Gunman"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.1.desc: "From behind the crest of the hill, Bohdan crouched, ready to take the shot. Behind him, two other partisans stood waiting for the kill. A car, painted black and adorned with German symbols, had just appeared.\n\nIt was close enough now - Bohdan fired. The glass of the car cracked, and the slumped, bloodied head of the driver smashed into the steering wheel. The car careened off the road, and the other partisans moved to finish their work.\n\nFrom his vantage, Bohdan could not see what his compatriots did next, but he heard the fire of their guns and the high-pitched crash of shattering windows. The mission was complete.\n\nAs the rest pulled the bodies from the vehicle, Bohdan walked towards the car, now a wreck on the side of the road. His eyes met with the driver's vacant stare. His face was bloody now, his skull cracked. He wore civilian clothes, with a watch on his arm.\n\nHad a small patch on his lapel, designating his race. He was a Ukrainian.\n\nBohdan turned away, filled with an ugly mixture of disgust and shame. This man was no comrade, of course, but he was no settler. A world of possible lives flew into Bohdan's head, possible realities of the man he had killed. Possible reasons he might have ended up a fascist's servant.\n\nBohdan turned from the car and began marching back up the hill, ready to return home. Germany's roots are growing, he thought to himself. No matter how many died, their replacements only seemed to grow more comfortable, dug further and further into the soil."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.2.desc: "The sun had set hours ago, and the fire was going out. The other soldiers had returned to their encampments - but Bohdan had been ordered to stay. He wasn't sure why. He watched the last embers fall, and waited for his next command.\n\nOut of the darkness, The division's commander spoke, his voice powerful yet only as loud as needed. "Bohdan, I am concerned about your recent conduct. Your comrades have complained - you've been eating little, and rarely speaking with them. They say you seem to have forgotten the cause."\n\nBohdan took a long time to speak. "I'm fine, I promise. I remain dedicated. I have devoted myself to our every mission, and I'm as accurate with a rifle as ever."\n\n"Bohdan, I am no zealot, but I do believe a man has a soul - I've seen it burning in the heat of battle. A soul cannot survive off of pride in one's work alone. It needs hope. If you do not truly believe in the cause, sooner or later your soul will fail you, and you will waver."\n\nBohdan spoke quickly. "I would never betray the cause, commander. I promise."\n\nThe commander gave a slight smile. Even in the last glimpse of light, Bohdan could see his commander's weariness. "I believe you. But when the light returns tomorrow morning, take some time to read Lenin. A good soldier knows what to fight for.""

 UKR_BohdanIntro.3.t: "The End"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.3.desc: "Deep in the forest, between scattered and hidden fortifications, a small fire roared. Around it, Bohdan and his fellow partisans quietly ate their fill. It was a disgusting meal, watery yet overwhelmed by the taste of buckshot, but Bohdan had come to accept such long ago. His commander stood above them, less imposing than usual. He had a look in his eyes - a slight squint. It flickered into Bohdan's view, then faded away just as quickly.\n\nAs the fire began to fade, the commander called his men to attention. "Comrades, I have received some unpleasant news. The hideout of our fellow division, a few miles north of here, was uncovered by the Fascist government yesterday evening. We have received no word since. It is likely the worst has occurred."\n\nIt wasn't the first time the commander had been forced to give such news. They'd heard the same story far too many times now. A simple fact was emerging, one that Bohdan knew the danger of internalizing fully: they might be dead tomorrow.\n\nA silence fell over the soldiers, only broken by their spoons and the occasional crackle of the fire. As the last gasps of the fire illuminated his comrades' faces, Bohdan could see that each was, in their own, quiet manner, grappling with the same fears, the same story."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.3.a: "And casting it aside."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.4.t: "The City"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.4.desc: "Despite himself, Bohdan was always frightened of the city. Yes, some part of him knew that these places had been built decades ago, even centuries. They were Ukrainian, same as the fields and forests he fought for every day. Yet for all his life, they had been German, outposts of state control and settlement with German names and a German way of life. Intellectually, he knew that was mere fiction. In the moment, standing between swastikas and police officers, it felt horribly real.\n\nBohdan still sometimes had to enter the city, however. Today, on the orders of his commander, he was in the heart of the Reichskommissariat - Kiew - looking to buy supplies for his fellow soldiers. Bohdan hoped that the captain's assignment didn't mean anything, given the risk of this mission. He feared that the man may have given up on him. Trust, he repeated to himself. Trust.\n\nFinally, he found the right house. He gave a knock on a back entrance, and a man appeared, thin and wiry with an odd expression. Bohdan ducked inside. For all his fears of the city, the room was small and unimpressive, and so was the deal. Some bandages and medicine for a king's ransom of foodstuffs. A bad deal, but a deal he was authorized to take.\n\nAs Bohdan left, the seller asked him why he bothers with these missions. He didn't know how to respond."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.4.a: "Bohdan mumbled something about liberty, and slipped into the night."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.5.desc: "Bohdan proceeded at an urgent pace, driven by a bubbling mixture of anxiety and exhilaration. The small village wasn't the safest place to be, but it was better than where he had just been a few days ago, a city crawling with police, looking for him or at least men like him. It was an unfortunate necessity to pass through the town. When he'd tried the way he came, he'd seen Feldgendarmerie on patrol, examining every grain of wheat. He'd barely slipped away, with a wavering hand kept close to the pistol on his hip. They were likely already all over the region by now, and he had a sinking feeling they'd find the outpost in due time. Not before burning countless homes and fields, of course. This backroad, seemingly overlooked, would have to do. He'd only be here an hour, at most, he reasoned to himself.\n\nThe village was idyllic, in a dystopian way. It was surrounded on all sides by miles upon miles of farmland, but rising smoke sullied their beauty. An ugly Wehrmacht convoy in the distance did not ease his worries. The cobblestone streets and single story homes and businesses called back to a simpler time, but they still bore the scars of the occupation. The people were thin and clad in threadbare coats no better than wool sacks. There was a one armed, shivering man begging with a lost war playing out in his eyes. Lastly was a newspaper stand, much of its wares printed in German. Bohdan knew better than to interact with anyone, but he was tempted to learn how the plan had gone.\n\nHe dug a karbovanet out of the deep pockets of his coat and handed it to the man, who accepted it graciously in a strong German accent. Bohdan claimed a state-run rag of drivel, and scanned the front page. 'Reichskommissar Koch in Critical Condition After Bombing'\n"Suka..." He muttered. He had every policeman and soldier in Ukraine on his heels because of this operation, and the man wasn't even dead.\n\n"Tragic, isn't it," said the German vendor. Bohdan blinked and gave a dazed nod."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.6.t: "Flame, Lead, and Grief"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.6.desc: "As soon as Bohdan crested the hill and saw the fires, he knew what had happened. The hateful flames devouring that familiar patch of forest were hard to misinterpret. Nor were the tire tracks scarring the ash-laden mud and snaking off into the distance. He nearly broke into a sprint, but he knew better. Instead, he unholstered his sidearm and began to walk at a steady pace as the fire died down. By the time he was there, there were only cinders and the skeletons of trees.\n\nHe waded through the smoke, traversing the hellscape in search of the wooden bunker. He hacked phlegm into his sleeve as he choked on the smog. His foot caught on something and he wretched as he looked down on the charred face of a German trooper, his flesh chipping like bark. It brought him cold comfort that at the very least his cell had taken a few of the rats with them. He glanced over to the bunker's entrance, the way the wood had splintered and the structure had buckled, it looked like a maw of broken teeth.\n\nLurking closer, he stepped over the corpses of two partisans, too burnt to make out their identities. There was no doubt in his mind that they had been his friends, and he was forced to shove down his grief to proceed. The inside of the bunker wasn't much brighter, although the sun now shone through holes where the logs and earth had given way. He counted each body he saw, and with each one the despair was harder to ignore.\n\nIt all came to a head when he found his commander, the man who had taken him in and tried so hard to give hope to his lost soul. Now he was just another body, recognizable only by his uniform. Bohdan couldn't take it, falling out of time as he sobbed into his arm. There was nothing in or around him but pain. Eventually he remembered where he was and stood up, blurry eyed but purposeful. He retrieved a shovel from against the wall and dragged his commander out to a proper resting place - then the rest, until he was the last of his cell above ground."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.7.t: "Rubies in the Rough"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.7.desc: "In defiance of his legs' protests, Bohdan pressed on through the fields. The pain in his stomach far outweighed that in his limbs, even after hours of walking and burying friends. The full moon provided its gentle silver glow, painting the wheat grey. The light glinted off of grain silos and warehouses, turning them to frosted silhouettes. He noted a dormant tractor. He'd passed many that day. The countryside was all tools, no people, and plastered with the names of German companies.\n\nThe tractor was safe from this fate, its make showing it predated the occupation. Had he found the solitary family farm in these corporate plains? His aching stomach twisted like a vice. A family farm meant a farmhouse, a farmhouse meant a garden, and a garden meant real food rather than just endless grain. He moved further up the road, spotting a home.\n\nHis hopes fell when he reached a German sign at the edge of the property. Bohdan turned, clenching his fists. He'd have to find another garden. Looking around, he still only saw storehouses. He faced the house again, noting the tomato vines a ways into the perimeter. His gut churned, spurring his feet into action as he inched forward. He crawled through the farm like a pest, his heart pounding. Eventually he found a clutch of ruby red tomatoes and shoved them giddily into his pockets. Then, a light flicked on inside. He saw the shadow of a man with a rifle and immediately stood up, breaking into an agonizing sprint.\n\nA flashlight cut through the dark, just missing Bohdan as he tumbled over a short fence, sprawling flat on his stomach in the mud. Recovering as quickly as he could, he scrambled through the grass until the windows were dark again. He fell onto his back, now caked thoroughly with muck. His breaths quieted as he stared at the ink black sky, waiting for the stars to stop spinning. Gingerly, he retrieved a surprisingly pristine tomato from his coat. Shivering, he took a bite of the best tomato he had ever tasted."
 UKR_BohdanIntro.7.a: "Perhaps he was lucky after all."

 UKR_BohdanIntro.8.t: "Charity's Dead"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.8.desc: "The farmhouse was a sight for Bohdan's sore eyes. As well as his sore arms, sore stomach, sore legs and sore back. The tomatoes, divine as they had been, hadn't lasted him more than a few hours before his gut was pleading him to find something substantial. He felt he was in luck, however, as the warehouses and silos had begun to give way to humble, if somewhat desolate, homes. Most importantly they seemed to be Ukrainian homes from the occasional sign on the side of the road, so Bohdan approached the one before him in hopes of charity.\n\nHe took a deep breath, as if he were preparing to plead his case to the Reaper. He tried to make himself presentable, but there wasn't much he could do. Every inch of him was muddy, bloody or grass stained. He resolved to try to pat his wild hair down and button his coat, although in the process he realized a few had come off, then rapped his bruised knuckles against the door. His heart pounded for several seconds and he brushed his hair back once again. Slowly the door crept open and the bespectacled face of an old man emerged.\n"Yes?" He asked in a soft, yet defeated, tone. His left eyebrow arched as he observed the state of the ex-partisan.\n\nIt occurred to Bohdan that he hadn't even thought of what to say. Hunger clouded his mind as he stumbled over his next words, "Good afternoon, sir. I've been walking for..." He paused, "Several, days. My home was burned in a German raid, I have no food or a place to sleep-"\n\n"I'm sorry, young man, but we've barely any to spare for ourselves," the aging man replied.\n\n"Please, I could work on your farm! I can sleep outside," He pleaded as the man began to close the door. "Please, don't," Bohdan scrambled for some half-hearted appeal to nationalism that he simply didn't have, "we have to stick together -" Suddenly the world felt colder for Bohdan as the door fell shut. "For Ukraine...""
 UKR_BohdanIntro.8.a: "On to the next?"

 UKR_BohdanIntro.9.t: "Respite"
 UKR_BohdanIntro.9.desc: "Bohdan dipped his head into the creek. The cold water stung, but there was relief in the pain. He pulled his head free and watched the muck and blood slip downstream. The feeling of cleanliness was liberating, but he still could not help the worry that there was a gun trained at his back. He began moving back to the tree where he had laid his coat to dry. As he began to wipe his face with the sleeve, birds fled the trees of the glade at the sound of rumbling engines.\n\nHe hunched down, hoping the sparse canopy above him and the slope of the hill beyond the stream would shield him. His hand crept towards the pistol at his hip. The roar grew louder, heavier, and fiercer. Between the branches and over the hill Bohdan saw a military truck grinding down the road, festooned with the macabre heraldry of the Reich. The sight alone was enough for him to draw his weapon free and press himself against a boulder. The pounding of his heart joined the cacophony of mechanical noise, and for minutes he listened.\n\nHe hazarded a glance beyond the rock, allowing himself to stand to his full height and see more than a dozen trucks and armored cars on the move. He knew he was quite the public enemy, but surely they were not sending that much against a fugitive? His question was answered as they passed him by the same way they would the rest of the countryside. He fell back behind the stone, mortal fear receding in the face of confusion. He let the noise fade before slipping out, inching toward the hill. He winced as he left safety and came into full view of the road. A few hundred feet ahead was the last of the largest Wehrmacht convoy he'd seen in years, moving with urgency toward the horizon. He breathed a sigh of cautious relief and slid back down. Putting away his gun, he noted that his hands were shaking.\n\nThe only thing that shocked him more than this moment, one he'd spent years preparing for, was that he had no idea what to do."

 ## 7.3.1 - RK PRE-UCW EVENTS ##

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.0.t: "The Calling"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.0.desc: "A meeting for the Security Council concluded, another day of butting heads. The words "Ein Volk" never felt so false - the three leaders only found their visions and each other's dreams. Each quarrel was a petty obstruction to another man's ambitions.\n\nGeorg Leibbrandt read reports alone in his lamplit office on his Ukrainian National Council pet pupils. They suffered the same as he did, watching a land they cherished descend into decay. On the face of it, he was meant to be the most powerful in Ukraine, but insubordination haunted him at every step. Ohlendorf and Bräutigam had to be put in their places.\n\nOtto Ohlendorf finished compiling another list of recommendations - another set of initiatives Leibbrandt would dismiss or subvert. He was a weakling, grasping at concepts that he would hammer together as part of his grotesque fantasy for Germany's lands. What had he done to deserve being under that oafish Rosenbergite mind of his? It was a situation that had to change.\n\nHans-Otto Bräutigam worked through the night. He couldn't afford to take a break when his colleagues had already entrenched their positions. Leibbrandt promised reform and would deliver it in its barest form, and Ohlendorf promised his own brand of reform, but worryingly, he could deliver it to Ukraine in full. These natives deserved better, a young man with new ideas. They deserved Bräutigam.\n\nFrom heights far above their Earthly realm, Destiny watched over all of them, having contemplated their visions for long enough. Their plans seemed so tiny and insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but perhaps one of them was worth favoring, just one."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.0.a: "Leibbrandt's reveries will turn into reality."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.0.b: "Ohlendorf's orders would not go to waste."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.0.c: "Bräutigam's plans shall see the light of day."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.1.t: "Meeting of the Security Council"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.1.desc: "The news of Reichskommissar Koch's collapse had seized the entire Reichskommissariat in a paralyzing grasp. The state's executive was, by very design, almost wholly dependent on his power and direction, and without it nobody knew what to do. But the bandits and rebels moved nonetheless. Someone had to take charge.\n\nThat someone was Georg Leibbrandt.\n\nUnderstanding the seriousness of the situation, he quickly worked to gather every senior official he could, and in this he surprised many. His well-known infuriating fashion for rational argument was dropped in favor of what could be called a plea, a plea that the state could not stand still. Not when its enemies were moving decisively. None could argue with that, at least, and before long the Security Council, as it had been so dubbed, was having its second meeting.\n\nA tense atmosphere hung over the event. Each fiefdom, carefully created and jealously guarded, felt that Leibbrandt was attempting to weaken them, centralizing power in himself. But they all understood that if they fell, they all fell together. Metaphorically as well as at the end of a bandit's rope. Soon agreements started to be heard.\n\nFirst from Bräutigam, who spoke with increasing confidence about the Council as a method to advance reform. Then from other functionaries and officials. Even, finally, from Ohlendorf, who broke silence several times to agree with the route of cautious reform - and the maintenance of order.\n\nSlowly, the wheels of 'government' began to once again turn."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.1.a: "Disaster averted. For now."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.2.t: "The Fissures Widen"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.2.desc: "There was a growing tension throughout the highest levels of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. One that everyone perceived, but none were openly willing to acknowledge yet. The bombing of Koch, and the loss of his leadership had ended an undisputed chain of command, and presented opportunities that no one was willing to overlook - even as it risked further instability.\n\nThe ongoing war against the Ukrainian partisans continued to intensify, but it was no longer the only war that mattered. Within the Reichskommissariat administration, there was another, quiet war for influence beginning. The seeds had been planted long ago, and the bombing had brought them to bloom. Everyone appeared to realize their time was now - or never again.\n\nMany ranking officials and officers had aligned to, or rallied themselves around the three most important men in the Reichskommissariat - Georg Leibbrandt, Otto Ohlendorf, and Hans-Otto Bräutigam. Conventional wisdom had those looking from the outside-in believe that Leibbrandt had a clear advantage in this battle for influence as the Acting Reichskommissar.\n\nThe reality was not so certain.\n\nEach man had their own collection of allies, friends, and opportunists who sought to align themselves with the man they bet would emerge from this struggle victorious. Many others in the Reichskommissariat remained on the sidelines for now, unwilling to throw their support behind anyone until there was a clear frontrunner.\n\nOnly one thing for all of them was certain - the years of tension, rivalry, and ambition were coming to a head, and with Koch indisposed, it could not be stopped. Each man believed themselves the heir to the Reich's Breadbasket, and the only one who could lead it through the storm that had befallen them."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.2.a: "Time would soon reveal a victor."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.3.t: "Pinned"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.3.desc: "Johann pressed himself against the wall, feeling the cold concrete against his trembling back. The old prison had been built to last but that didn't mean it would. He heard another crack of rifle fire and his heartbeat quickened. As they got closer, they got more frequent, like a coming thunderstorm. He checked the ammunition of his own weapon, with not a single bullet fired. Despite ages of drills for this exact scenario, Johann could barely remember where he was. He had fled the second the tenth partisan emerged from the woods and the fourth bullet tore into Anton's chest, until this moment where he hid in some hallway nestled in the cold heart of the prison.\n\nHe listened to his radio crackle. The other soldiers likely wanted to know where he was, but every second there were fewer. They all stopped around the same time as the gunfire. The silence of the grave smothered him. He carried on, slowly retracing his steps. As he began to ponder surrender, he heard a voice behind him.\n\n"Getting what's coming to you, then?" A man spat from behind the bars of his cell. Johann had stumbled into the main ward and the whispers and venom had already begun to echo off the desolate walls. He turned on his heel, looking upon the emaciated ex-partisans. Their pleased grins contrasted their miserable condition, lending them the appearance of vengeful ghosts.\n\n"Quiet! You're still prisoners of the... the Reichskommissariat. I'll have you all shot!" He declared with less than certain conviction. All he got in return was laughter.\n\n"Where's the rest of your little gang?" Hissed the man from before, "Did they all get killed, or did you abandon them?" Soon, voices were calling out down the hall. Johann's Ukrainian was rough, but he knew they were coming for him. He braced himself as guilt and mortal terror seeped into his heart. Perhaps this was what he deserved, but he knew it was far too late for penance as fate's punishment arrived in the form of a bullet."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.3.a: "A just one at that."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.4.t: "Burdens of Authority"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.4.desc: "Officer Gabriel Korsch disliked the predicament he found himself in.\n\nAuthority was something sought by many, and when the chain of command was clear, and the superiors aligned, it was a useful thing to hold. It was far less appetizing when one was caught between competing interests and motivations.\n\nResources were in short supply in Ukraine, especially right now. The partisan problem was proving resilient, and while one might expect the various militant interests in the Reichskommissariat be aligned, they were not. With the resources they'd recently been able to require, demands had quickly come from both the SS and Ukrainian National Army.\n\nThus, a dilemma emerged.\n\nThe UNA were, ultimately, collaborators, and while Korsch knew that they were important to the overall strategy for the region, he couldn't help but hold some wariness at arming Ukrainians further, especially with the partisan problem worsening.\n\nLoyalty concerns was the primary reason the SS was demanding the resources be allocated to them. Even if it wasn't strictly following protocols, there was no doubt that the SS were loyal to Germany, and Germany alone.\n\nAt the same time, this wasn't a choice of personal preferences - The request to supply the UNA came directly from the Deputy Reichskommissar, while the SS had made it clear that they were acting in Germania's interests. While defying the instructions of the Deputy Reichkommissar was almost unthinkable - potentially making an enemy of the SS was almost as bad.\n\nUnfortunately, he needed to make a choice, and throw his lot in with one side or the other."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.4.a: "Better to ensure Germany's interests are fulfilled. The SS will have what they need."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.5.t: "Aim and Infiltrate"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.5.desc: "So many threats, and not enough resources.\n\nSuch was the dilemma facing Sören Kling, an officer of the Ukrainian Security Police. In his office, numerous papers and reports detailing the situation facing the Reichskommissariat were spread across his desk. He had been reviewing dossiers, threat assessments, and contingency plans, all to ensure he made an informed decision on a heavy question.\n\nWhat was the biggest threat facing the Reichskommissariat?\n\nThere were only three groups of real concern. There was the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, small in number, but fanatical Ukrainian nationalists who clung to the long-dead Bandera's dream. They were dangerous terrorists, but their minimal numbers made him wonder if it was worth the hassle.\n\nThe UNRA was more interesting to him - they were also Ukrainian nationalists who sought to create a republic, and were widely viewed as a more 'moderate' alternative to the radicalism of the UPA. As a result they had a wider base of support, though weren't as active, and the members weren't as fanatical.\n\nThen there were the remnants of the Ukrainian Red Army; communists hiding in the east who had survived like the cockroaches they were, despite continued efforts to quash them. Kling understood they retained some popular support, but as to their strength? He was doubtful it was enough to truly threaten the Reichskommissariat.\n\nIt was better to focus resources on one of these groups then spread his people too thin. He was confident that his men would be able to infiltrate, and build networks against any of these groups. He only had to give them a target. Finally, after hours of consideration, Kling knew exactly who his target would be."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.6.t: "Donning an Iron Glove"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.6.desc: "It was clear that action was demanded. Ohlendorf knew very well that Leibbrandt and Bräutigam would be unhappy with what he was about to do, but unfortunately, the security situation had reached a point where their complaints fell on deaf ears. They knew it needed to be done, and that they no longer had sufficient reasons to risk stopping him.\n\nStanding before a small crowd of officers and state media, Ohlendorf cleared his throat. "Due to the security situation, and the state of the security forces in the Reichskommissariat, I am officially announcing the expansion of the Kampfgruppe to properly address the partisan threat, and ensure the safety of the citizens, and our soldiers."\n\n"Additionally," he continued. "The Kampfgruppe will assume control over existing security forces, and coordinate efforts to protect critical resources and infrastructure, and conduct offensive operations against the partisans. I am confident the situation will stabilize in short order."\n\nIt was short, to the point, and after a few more words, he concluded with a 'Heil Hitler' and departed without questions. The announcement had been a formality, as already Kampfgruppe officers were assuming control over the police forces, and preparing operations. Ohlendorf expected that there would be some kind of retaliation from Leibbrandt - as it was a clear challenge to his authority.\n\nStill, Ohlendorf doubted he could do much about it. Bräutigam was even less of a concern, as the influence the Foreign Office had over security matters was inconsequential. The worst he'd have to fear was the man's disapproval - and that was something he could live with."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.6.a: "He had what he needed. Order would be brought to Ukraine, one way or another."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.7.t: "An Idea"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.7.desc: "Heerema sat on his porch, reclining as he considered the view in front of him. His home was a little way outside of Charkow, close enough that he could get back into the city should his presence be required, but remote enough that he had some peace away from the hustle and bustle of urban life. Ukraine, he mused, was a rather flat country. It must be rather unnerving to be a German here, used to the towering forests and the impenetrable Alps in their homeland. The seemingly endless plain was comforting to Heerema, though, reminiscent of the lowlands of Holland on which he lived as a boy. Perhaps he would buy an estate in Gotenland; the warm sea air would certainly bring no small amount of comfort in his daily life.\n\nA servant came to where Heerema was reclining, carrying a stack of papers and reports that signaled an end to his brief moment of idle leisure. Wordlessly grabbing the reports, his face fell into a slight frown at the sight of the numbers. Production values across the colony were stagnant, if not regressing. It was a death knell, one that had been sounding for quite some time now. Funding always seemed to make its way towards agricultural subsidies or combatting the rising bandit threat rather than his factories, leaving them underperforming compared to the rest of the Reich. He would be meeting with the acting Reichskommissar later in the week and had prepared a report that would be sure to show him that increased funding to the colony's burgeoning industry would result in greater returns for everyone involved.\n\nShooing the servant away, Heerema grabbed the open bottle of wine sitting on the table next to him and poured himself a glass. He raised the glass to the heavens in a silent salute, something that one might even call a prayer. A prayer to industry, a prayer to progress, and a prayer to the future of the Aryan race. He raised the glass to his lips and grimaced."
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.7.a: "The wine had gone sour."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.8.t: "An Insult"
 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.8.desc: "The office was rather plain, befitting neither Heerema nor the man that he was scheduled to meet. It contained, to his understanding, just five objects of any note, barring the two doors that marked both the room's exit to the hallway and to the office further within. There were, in order, a row of chairs upon which Heerema was sitting; a desk, with a little telephone, behind which sat a diminutive secretary paying him no heed; a small houseplant seated next to the desk; a singular clock face by which he was telling the time; and a painting that broke the monotony of the beige wall that surrounded it.\n\nThe painting was what Heerema had been focusing on in the past few minutes in a vain attempt to stave off madness. It was a simple thing, a landscape commissioned by some self-important bureaucrat to some self-important artist, and it did little to soothe the anger that had been building inside. He had been sitting in this small waiting room for the better part of an hour, waiting for a meeting that had been scheduled for quite some time ago. His grand entrance, carefully planned to arrive just as the clock struck, had been stymied by the unassuming secretary sitting in front of him. "Please, take a seat," he had said, sanctimonious and polite, "the acting Reichskommissar will be with you shortly."\n\nFinally, a buzz broke the monotony of the ticking. With a feverish gaze, Heerema watched the secretary bring the phone to his ear. "Yes?" he asked. He gave a wordless nod, and hung up the telephone. "You can go in," he said.\n\nStiffly, Heerema shot up, papers in hand, and walked past the secretary with his signature smile reasserting itself on his face. He threw open the doors, ready to sell his proposition as he had sold hundreds before.\n\nThe sight before him froze the smile on his face. It wasn't Leibbrandt. It wasn't even someone he recognized, just another sniveling man in an ill fitting suit. "I'm sorry for the delay, sir, but the acting Reichskommissar will be unable to make it to the meeting today."\n\nHeerema turned on his heels, ramrod straight, and walked swiftly out of the building."

 UKR_pre_UCW_RK.9.desc: "Stepan Ordhonets sat at his desk, motionless. His suit was done up tidily. His papers were shredded, their bits and fragments lying all around his desk like snow dusting. He was pale, beads of sweat forming on his brow. His eyes were fixed on the door, every thud of the pipes or pitter-patter of mice in the walls made him jump slightly.\n\nFootsteps in the hall, Ordhonets held back his tears, slowly getting up.\n\nThe grey-uniformed men greeted Stepan with a cold salute. He invited them to sit down, but they refused, towering over him as he sank into his chair.\n\n"Mr. Ordhonets, we have received some rather disturbing reports of some of your conduct." One of the men, taller and lankier than the others with giant spectacles, began. "You are a sterling mayor by all accounts. You have been an advocate of publicly hanging Banderites and scouring them. You have even personally ordered the deaths of at least five particularly dangerous individuals. You can imagine our shock, our outrage when this report hit our desks."\n\nOrdhonets' mouth was dry. "I-I don't follow." The bespectacled man smirked, his almost comical bug eyes flaring.\n\n"You have been credibly accused of treason, Mr. Ordhonets." The man crowed in his reedy voice.\n\nOrdhonets steadied, he had been obviously shaking since the aide rushed in with the tip-off an hour ago, and now he was still. "You have just stated why that very reason is impossible. Why would I jeopardize everything, everything to commit treason against the legitimate government of the Ukraine? Please enlighten me!" The bespectacled man drew back, as if surprised by this last-ditch defense.\n\n"I apologize, sir, we can never be too careful. Take him away!" Stepan was lifted out of his chair and slammed to the ground. "Ordhonets, Stepan, arrested for treason with incontrovertible proof of his collaboration with Judeo-Bolshevik elements. Such a fall from grace, such a shame!"\n\nOrdhinets kicked and screamed pathetically. His subordinates' doors were all shut and locked. "I swear, I swear, I swear you will regret this! Kiew will have your heads! You have no evidence!"\n\nA few denizens of the city looked on as their mayor was thrown into a car like a defiant, spoiled toddler. They all shook their heads.

Did German men not fight for the right to hold it in their own hands, to farm it, form it, and raise future generations upon it?\n\nThey did, and we do. But every death blow is restricted. We hear the chitterings of the traitor Ukranians as our administrators tear us away from victories, chastising us for destroying the enemy. Those men do not rule, they merely administer. They are bribers, placaters at heart, those men in Kiew. If only Germania knew the extent of their wrongdoing, their falsifications, their lies, and obfuscations.\n\nOnly yesterday fifteen farmers were executed in raids. Thousands of dutied peasants have fled their lords. Crime, petty and grand, has increased tenfold in only the last few months. Illegal border crossings between the General Government and our western frontiers have become common and unmanageable. What has been the response of the Kiew administration? Enablement, a sickening capitulation to the demands of obviously compromised local elders, Schuma, and journalists. Men who have been connected to the OUN menace have been allowed to write pithy and trite denunciations of partisan violence in state papers!\n\nI promise you, Germans of the Ukraine, that my single purpose in the coming months shall be the destruction of Judeo-Bolshevism, the scattering of the western bandits, and the complete reformation of the bureaucracy in Kiew.

That day, a major bandit raid occurred, resulting in the death of nineteen brave soldiers, seven officers, and eight high-ranking officials. We must all remember their sacrifice in the name of the Vaterland."\n\n"In the name of the Vaterland, of course. It is insane to think that the unjust treatment of entire nations became a sacrifice in the name of my country. Young German men now die here in a fight they didn't choose. It is even more insane to think, however, that the majority here, in this room, aren't willing to do anything about it, despite claiming to care about our brave sons and brothers. Can't they see that it is impossible to simply extinguish the will of the people to be free, as Ohlendorf believes, or expect that they will obediently accept oppression, as Leibbrandt hopes? The right way - the only way - is to allow the Slavs to join us in a quest to rebuild and heal this land. I will make sure we follow that way. We must."\n\n"This, I believe, has come as a result of the absence of real reforms, which should've been implemented - at least, partially - by the Security Council, leading to anti-Reich sentiments among the local populace in the Reichskommissariat grow. Only meaningful, fruitful reforms can ensure that one of our Führer's greatest conquests remains stable. I hope that my concerns will be heard. Thank you.""

Maybe he could still get six hours of sleep if he went home now. It wasn't meant to be, however, as three thuds could be heard on the other side of his door before a distinctive Dutchman entered his office.\n\n"Bräutigam, we need to talk." The German could feel the desperation on Heerema without even having to look at his face, wracked with sleeplessness that had his beat. "You may not like it, but we both have a common predicament. The political landscape is slowly moving underneath our feet, soon to sweep us off our feet. We both need support."\n\n"So why are you coming to me? Is it because Leibbrandt or Ohlendorf have no use for a failed entrepreneur? What makes you think I want a scavenger like you on my side?" That's what Bräutigam's heart wanted to say, but his brain seemed to halt the words from leaving his mouth. Instead, something more fitting for a politician came out.\n\n"I understand where you are coming from. If you can convince the settlers to support me, I might be able to back you up in the council." Heerema's face first turned to shock and then relief. "I need to see results first, of course. We will discuss this more tomorrow."\n\n"You can trust me." That was a lie. "I have your back, and you have mine." That was definitely a lie. "I'll see you become Reichskommissar. Leibbrandt and Ohlendorf won't see us coming, goodnight." A piece of truth must have accidentally slipped from Heerema's mouth.\n\nBräutigam knew that those two were full of themselves and that Heerema and him were incompatible in every way. But they both wanted power, so if these means justified Bräutigam's ends, why not?"

Recently, the situation in Ukraine became less and less manageable, resulting in rising discontent among officials and rumors regarding "inefficient" governing, with some even suggesting the soon collapse of the Reichskommissariat. Along with that, infighting among various factions of the German government in Ukraine had also seen a drastic increase, leading to a more heated power struggle within the colony. While their concerns may be a big overreaction to controllable problems, it's an undeniable fact that the stability of the Nazi rule over Ukraine became much, much weaker.

It was true that the Reichskommissariat was in a rather difficult situation, so calling for help would only be smart, for without it, all of his efforts to change Ukraine would be useless. As he started to dial up the number, he just prayed that there would be something other than silence on the other end of the line.\n\nAround a week later, he was walking through the halls of one of the administrative buildings in Kiew on a cozy evening. He was again thinking about his current position. The call didn't change much - of course, some help did arrive, but it was only token assistance, just the needed minimum. It wasn't enough to improve the Reichskommissariat, but the right amount to stay afloat. It wasn't an achievement, no, but it was better than nothing.\n\nOther than some aid from the metropole, the call had other, more productive results. For the past few days, the negotiations between Bräutigam and other administrators had been going surprisingly smoothly, and even the most stubborn of officials were willing to work out deals with him. Of course, Bräutigam wasn't an idiot. He quickly realized that the call made him more respected - after all, it's nice to see someone who actually does work, right?\n\nJust as he was thinking about that, he decided to stop by a big window, from which a spectacular view of Kiew opened up. He loved that place; for some reason, it meant something special to him, and stopping by every time he was in that building felt like a must - especially on evenings like this one. Then, to his pleasant surprise, he noticed something new."

The assembly line, barely visible in the poor lighting of the factory and Ihor's blurry vision, was like the gnashing maw of a steel giant, devouring materiel and sweat and spitting out bullets. The giant roared in heavy clangs, agonized groans and metallic grinding. Its breath reeked of blood and cinders. Ihor stopped to hold his aching shoulder, biting his dry, cracking lips. "Hey! Back to work!" Barked the foreman from a catwalk unseen. Ihor complied with gritted and rotten teeth.\n\n"This has to be a numbers error," muttered the supervisor from his desk chair in his office nestled safely in a far corner of the building. He was looking over the newest letter from the higher ups.\n\n"No, sir, I called the offices. They really want a 50% increase," replied the aide standing before the supervisor's desk.\n\nIhor loaded another hunk of metal, his grunts of pain coming out scratchy from his blisteringly dry throat. He tried to make sense of the time, which blurred together like a fevered nightmare, and pleaded to God voicelessly that he could have his nightly sip of water soon.\n\n"That's impossible! We're already working well beyond our means, this place will start falling apart! On whose authority? I bet they're just trying to intimidate us, that's it!" Ranted the supervisor. In the factory room, the foreman was checking the time for when he'd deal out the workers' paltry rations.\n\n"The SS, sir," murmured the aide, as if he was afraid the very word would summon them.

The men were tall, strong, and fit, and their weapons were in good condition. There were no unnecessary emotions, only a sense of loyalty and dedication. Everything seemed perfect. Yet, something was unsettling Ohlendorf. It wasn't something about the combatants; rather, it was a sense of fear. He never allowed fear to take control, but now, it was almost overpowering, and not without reason. Otto felt that something significant was approaching, something big, and he didn't know what that would be. He despised when he couldn't predict what was coming next as it left him with only silent prayers to himself - not something he trusted much.\n\nGeorg Leibbrandt crossed out another phone number on his list. He called each high-ranking official, officer, and businessman - anyone willing to talk. The Reichskommissariat, day by day, was displaying more signs of instability and chaos, and Leibbrandt needed all the men, all the help, to salvage the system from collapsing. Despite always hearing reassurances of support, deep inside, Georg knew that it wasn't enough. The clock was ticking, time was running out, and the noose was tightening.\n\nHans-Otto Bräutigam returned home after an interview with reporters from a Ukrainian newspaper loyal to the German administration. It was his first interview, and surprisingly, it went quite well. The reason he had never participated in such press engagements, even though the newspaper had always been loyal to the regime, was simple: why bother? In this land, the rule was force and bureaucracy. However, times had changed; the price of people's support had drastically increased. Bräutigam only hoped that it was for the best."

He had succumbed to the intimidation of the SS, ignored orders dispatched by Leibbrandt, and dispersed the resources he had control over to the SS itself instead of the UNA, almost fatally weakening the newly recruited UNA collaborators. Without those supplies, it was a near-certainty that many of them would run straight back to the insurgents, and those who remained would be almost completely combat ineffective.\n\nIt was a significant setback, indeed. There were other resources that Leibbrandt knew he could arrange for the UNA units, but it would not equal what was lost. Far worse, however, was the thought of Ohlendorf's face, a smug image that Leibbrandt could not keep out of his head.\n\nHe moved to file the dour report away, but not before making a note to reassign Officer Korsh. An administrative region far from Kiew, where he could do no harm, and where his career would die. It was what the man deserved, after all."

They would serve well, and take casualties that would have otherwise been suffered by German units.\n\nIt was a significant victory. The collaborator units were no longer paper tigers and would fight. Their losses would then keep them weak and dependent, and make their fighters loathe the insurgents of all flavors. Most importantly, however, was the loss of both face and strength on the part of the SS. They had been outmaneuvered, and everyone knew it.\n\nAt that thought, Leibbrandt added a smile to the nod, imagining the look on Ohlendorf's face. He also arranged a major promotion for Korsh.

The local security police officials had been very intelligent indeed, both in exploiting the situation and in cleaning up afterwards.\n\nAs always, it had been driven by collaborators. By traitors. Ukrainians who, though once collaborating with the German administration, had defected to the UNRA. Who realized that, despite their actions, they would never be accepted by their supposed countrymen, and who were always placed in the most dangerous situations. Who defected again, back to the Reich, and eagerly sold out their supposed comrades in order to avoid the hangman's noose.\n\nThe offer was of course accepted, as local security officials roused the garrison and swept through the bandit camps, killing all who were found and destroying large caches of equipment. It was a great victory, made all the greater when the officer in charge then turned the machine guns on the two-time traitors. They were useful, yes - but a traitor was a traitor always, and could not be trusted.\n\nThey had at least escaped the noose, to be sure. Ohlendorf agreed that a bullet was far better."

UPA bases hidden in the forests there had been exposed (even if that exposure had come from the local Poles who, though frequent collaborators, were still destable in every way) and completely destroyed.\n\nIt was also a victory, he knew, for interservice cooperation. The forests had been burned by the Luftwaffe, dropping napalm canisters in regimented fashion and the UPA fighters, left only one causeway out of the conflagration, had followed it out of desperation. The SS garrison had of course been waiting, and the slaughter had been near-total.\n\nThe UPA was badly hurt, and would not be undertaking operations anywhere near Volyn for some time. Ohlendorf knew that now was the moment to redirect resources to other insurgent regions, but not all. He knew well that the UPA was like a hydra. It would in time recover, and there would be many more fights to come."

A number of major bases, staging points, hidden cadres, and camps of other types had been identified, located, and utterly annihilated, with the end result of drastically impeding the Communist war effort in and around Charkow.\n\nIn his mind, Ohlendorf could see the ultimate result, if only similar victories could continue to be obtained. If only the security police could continue their patterns of efficiency and success. He could see the Communist menace completely crushed, their so-called 'People's War' destroyed once and for all. All attributable, of course, solely to his own efforts. His own leadership.\n\nYes, he could see that possible future, and he knew he would work to attain it.

He was their collective father, in a way, and the rock on which the waves of the surrounding chaos could only lap impotently. His environment was of calm, cool collection, data, science, and rationality in what seemed to be a veritable madhouse of conflicting personalities. The men who congregated in that stuffy meeting hall were less the bureaucrats who ran a colony, and more the footsoldiers of a prophet, being rewarded for good works with the deign of their beloved leader's presence.\n\n"Of course, there are very few easy solutions to these problems, as some of our... critics would have our supervisors believe. We need to maintain synergy with the various administrative arms and Ukrainian organizations. We need to exploit the natural bounties of Ukraine, not just of the soil, but the rivers and estuaries. Our economy must industrialize to meet the needs of the European community. We can only realize the vision of the Führer with the input and dedication of every administrator.

The sallow light of the lantern highlighted their hollow cheeks with dramatic shadow. "So, what have you got for us this week, Oleksiy?" Asked one man, rubbing his hands together.\n\n"Our benefactor has been kind," Said Oleksiy, a man with a greying beard and tired bones, laying out a set of books and scrap paper, "The library in town got raided for carrying Ukrainian literature, so they dumped what they could in a field. Our good man Mykyta just scooped it up and brought it here."\n\n"Spare the details!

The inked letters on the yellowed page were faded, the poem had to have been at least a decade old.

He turned back to the horizon and saw a German armored car, its silhouette wreathed the flame, where once farm trucks had peacefully rolled. He heard the crack of rifles in the woods beyond the fields as a war raged in silence where once there were tweeting birds. He smelled the putrid scent of the chemical plant's emissions, where once was the smoke of hearths. He felt the cold bite his skin and sink its teeth into his bones, where once there was strength.

He gathered Bahaziy and all those in the administration that had silently pledged their loyalty to a free Ukraine. They were his chess pieces in a game of deception.\n\nIn the following days, Brest witnessed what seemed to be an administrative shuffle. Ohloblyn, with a subtle touch, began removing the Reich's pawns. Some were reassigned to insignificant roles. Others were conveniently transferred, their replacements always ready, their true loyalties hidden behind impassive masks. The German officials, swayed by Ohloblyn's charisma and the facade of bureaucratic efficiency, suspected little. And so, piece by piece, the city's administration was quietly overtaken, a silent coup unfolding under the Reich's unsuspecting watch.\n\nBrest lay in wait for the first signs of rebellion, and when the signal would come, supply lines would be blocked, communications severed, and backs would be stabbed. The liberation of Brest would happen in record time. Ohloblyn would make sure of that."

In his long life, he had seen this cycle repeatedly. Soldiers come, demanding grain to eat, men to fight, and women to take. For the past year, it was the UPA doing the plundering, protecting their motherland by stripping it bare. As the village's Solty, it was his duty to treat these newcomers.\n\nSoon a knock sounded at the door, and a well-dressed young man entered the hall. The Solty motioned for him to sit, placing a plate of stale bread on the table, the first tribute of the day. The man introduced himself as Ivan Dziuba, a representative of the Polissian Guard. The Solty forced a smile. "Our village greets you sir, but I regret to say that we hardly have enough grain to feed ourselves nor do we have much in the way of money or weapons."\n\n"You need not worry about the Banderites any longer, Dziuba replied with a knowing smile. I haven't come to ask anything of you or your people today, instead I would like to know what we can do for you."\n\nStruggling to contain his annoyance he snorted. "Why I'd like four suckling pigs and thirty kegs of vodka to start, then we can talk about repairing Artem's fence..."\n\nThe young man chuckled. "Perhaps that could be arranged in time. Please write down all of your concerns and I will see they are at least addressed. I will be meeting with your villagers in the meantime."\n\nWhen Dziuba returned, he was met with a long list of demands and concerns. Most reasonable, and nearly identical to a dozen other villages. Except for one: Russian alien, squatting on land, must leave, it read. His lips pursed. The other requests would not be actionable in the short term, but this nuisance..."

He'd almost assumed he'd gotten the time wrong, when he noticed Father Fedir and a collaborator he'd met not long ago huddled, talking, around the altar.\n\n"Ah, Artem, I was beginning to doubt that you'd come! Any patrols give you any trouble?"\n\nAleksandr's smile shone through the darkness of the night sky lingering in the open air. Artem chuckled, trying his best to ease his own nerves as he tried to shrug off the feeling of dread that began to tug within him. "Oh, why, did you send them specifically after me, or just in my general direction?"\n\nThe Father held a more solemn mood, rubbing something clutched in his right hand. Upon closer inspection, Artem identified it as a black leather notebook. After meeting eyes with him for a moment, Father Fedir leaned closer towards Aleksandr. Artem overheard nothing but "...Certain?"\n\n"Well then, I believe we're ready for the ceremony. You know, we only do this with governors. You should count yourself special!" Father Fedir pulled a worn leather book out from his pocket, this one more worn and deeper in color than the notebook.

They had used the adverse weather to ambush a camp of UPA outside the town, and the attack had been a resounding success. Most of the defenders were slaughtered before they could pick up a gun, and the rest were shot as they tried to flee for reinforcements. Their victory had been so complete that the soldiers paraded into the town like victorious conquerors, in a column with their heads held high.\n\nWhen the soldiers first began to enter Kryvukha, there were only a few civilians out in the street. Some of them appeared confused at their presence, a few others took off their hats, and the rest just stared in shock. They must've never believed they would ever be liberated, the Sergeant mused to himself with a subtle grin. As the troops marched deeper into the city, more civilians came out of their homes to watch the spectacle. The Sergeant noticed a mother herding her kids inside before slamming the door shut, while another few civilians sobbed at their approach. The column's advance was stopped by an elderly man in a tattered military uniform, the only recognizable bits being medals from the war against Bukharin. The old man took a deep breath before his rasp sounded over the downpour.\n\n"What has happened to our defenders? Our brothers, our fathers, our sons?" the old veteran cried out.\n\n"They were defeated in a skirmish," the Sergeant replied, his grin dissipating into a frown as he made the connection, "you and your people are now under the protection of the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army. You will have nothing to fear." The old man gave a pensive look before hobbling off the road. The Sergeant ordered his march continued, leaving the old man behind.

Commander Andriy, a seasoned UNRA partisan, squinted at the motley group through the pale light. His eyes, hardened by years of struggle, held a firm gaze that seemed to penetrate the layers of uncertainty surrounding the new arrivals.\n\n"You've heard our call," he said, his voice echoing through the silent camp. "You've seen the strength of our cause. But to fight alongside us, to wear the badge of the UNRA, requires a sacrifice."\n\nHe let his words sink into the men before him. "You must renounce your past allegiances, every action you took to harm the Ukrainian people, denounce fascism, and pledge your loyalty to democracy. This isn't negotiable."\n\nHis words were met with a palpable tension. The defectors looked at each other, visibly uncomfortable. Yet, one by one, they voiced their agreement.\n\n"I... I renounce fascism. I pledge my support to democracy," stuttered a burly man in the front row, his eyes fixed on the ground.\n\nThe rest followed suit, their declarations varying in the conviction they carried. Some echoed the pledge firmly, their voices steady, while others looked to the ground and stumbled on their words.\n\nCommander Andriy listened to them all, silently measuring the depth of their commitment. He knew that not all were sincere; a few were bound to flee, perhaps even sabotage the uprising from the inside - he would keep his eye on them.\n\nYet, as he watched the group of defectors standing before him, he saw a glimmer of potential. There was a risk, but it was one that was necessary. There would be no free Ukraine if everyone with questionable allegiances were forbade from assisting the cause. Given enough time, these men would represent a valuable asset in the fight against the occupiers.\n\nWith a curt nod, he accepted their pledges.

They had won, but what were they to do now?\n\nThe wrath of the Reich was as sure as the sunrise. Stories of brutal reprisals in response to such acts of defiance were common. Whole villages razed, families torn apart, indiscriminate executions - the Reich's retribution was legendary in its brutality.\n\nAs this realization settled, the mansion's grandeur took on a more sinister appearance. Every shadow seemed to hide a German soldier, every gust of wind carried the echo of marching boots, and every moment of silence was a countdown to their impending doom.\n\nSome started murmuring about escape, their voices laced with fear. Others suggested a last stand, their determination wavering but not extinguished. Yet a third faction thought of reaching out to the UNRA for aid.

The UNRA delegate offers a handshake, to which the U-SSR delegate turns down. "No need for formalities, there are urgent matters to discuss." The meeting is already off to a rocky start.\n\nNot letting the communist get the first demand in, the UNRA delegate speaks. "Right. As we both know, the occupation will soon crumble under the weight of happenings back in Germania, and until then, I believe it would be in our best interests to focus our resources on the forces of the fascists, namely the Nazis and the UPA, instead of each other."\n\nThe U-SSR delegate responds. "Our organizations' interests, sir, are diametrically opposed, so no promises can be made. However, it would only be logical for the U-SSR to focus on the forces of fascism for now, seeing as they pose the serious threat."

As soon as he got the order, Petro began what he was trained to do: he shouted his orders to his men, "Open fire."\n\nPetro always found his unit's "Ukrainian Orchestra," a motley mix of mortars, a peculiar thing, used by the Nazi beasts, taken by the Banderite thugs, and now under the control of his unit. He often wondered how many times these Orchestra pieces fired at communists before his unit captured them, he guessed probably at least a thousand rounds.\n\nAs the assault wore on, Petro could see the bloodbath unfolding. Communist fled from the structure, running out into the forests surrounding the encampment. Petro noticed a unit of the Reds held up in the last standing building, attempting to shoot their way out. With the situation at a standstill, Petro gave the order to level the building.\n\nThe tower was smashed from above, as if God himself crushed it with his fiery palms, killing soldiers from each side.

Dziuba moved in to take the lead from here.\n\n"Ukrainian peasants have toiled our lands for decades, passing from father to son in the natural order, only for it to be blighted by foreign newcomers."

Playing away in the little apartment was incredibly risky, Vasyl knew that, and his friends with him especially knew that. Playing a slower rendition of "Dance of the Knights", Vasyl thought back to his tutor, back when the world made some semblance of sense. It was maddening that the world had practically ended, and all Vasyl could do was survive it, and yet moments like these kept him calm, calmer at least. Looking to those around him, they weren't half as calm, the aura beyond the music was very clear that they could be rendered by a German raid at any instant.\n\nVasyl was nearly halfway through his song, and everyone could feel it. The mood shifted, the emotions changed. There wasn't any traffic outside. The chatter outside the apartment calmed disturbingly fast like the world was about to end, and in a sense, it was. The steps outside in the hall hadn't diminished, if anything they got less hectic and heavier. You could almost hear a pin drop if it weren't for the violin, and the Germans' knives being sharpened.\n\nVasyl took a breath. His friends took their handguns and machine guns out from under their coats or their suitcases and pointed them at the closed blinds or locked doors. Almost absentmindedly, Vasyl still played, and yet he got a bizarre feeling. He wouldn't be able to finish his song. He grew tense, primed, but he couldn't shake the feeling.

Everything was going wrong, and they were on the verge of being surrounded.\n\nWorse, he was cut off from his battle group, most of whom were behind the truck they'd arrived on, or the other side of the street. None of them could communicate with each other, not unless they regrouped, and to do so right now would be suicide.\n\nThey needed covering fire, but they had no one coming. Something had to be done, and if no one acted, they'd be killed for sure. He took a deep breath, clutching his rifle tightly - It might as well be him.\n\nHe sprang up after one volley finished, aimed his rifle in the general direction of the Germans, and opened fire, while dashing towards a nearby alley. The German response was immediate, even as they were forced to take cover. In the empty alley, he leaned against the wall, panting as he felt something wet and warm running down his arm.\n\nHe put his fingers to it, and was surprised when they came back red. Fuck. He risked firing a few suppressive bursts from his position to keep the Germans away, while he pulled out his bandages before the wound worsened. He was wounded, but his position was better now. More gunfire sounded, and realized that it was coming from the other side of the street.\n\nPylyp smiled widely as he saw the other half of his battle group pushing forward, even without him. He quickly added his suppressive fire to the mix, and it was now the Germans who were on the defensive. It was a bad start, but it seemed they'd turned it around. If they were making progress here, he could only imagine how the rest of the uprising across the east must be going."

Sitting on the radiator above an apartment block overlooking all of Luhansk, Volodymyr's gear sat around him like an infantryman's picnic. His pack sat open, its contents spilled across the concrete rooftop. Home-cooked rations, stolen German rounds for his hack job rifle, and homegrown hand grenades, a buffet of neo-soviet weapons, none of which he could be prouder of. These streets, however, filled with German soldiers wandering on their patrols, or traitorous "policemen" in imposter's clothing, covered his psyche like mold on his bread, and he took aim with his rifle at those below him that would never know their lives could well have ended that night.\n\nStacking his equipment back into his bag, Volodymyr clambered down the sides of fire escapes and drain pipes before he nearly felt his shins shatter on the concrete below, flecks of water splattering on his work shoes with leather sewn into them. Walking down the streets of his home city, Volodymyr took a look around himself, seeing nobody around save for a street urchin half laying in an alleyway. Another victim of National Socialism.\n\nOpening the sewer grate below him, Volodymyr slid down the ladder rungs and found his feet splashing in liquid waste. Clambering onto the path he'd used prior, he wandered down the sewer homeward bound. Taking out his notebook, Volodymyr began to write down the thoughts he'd had for the day, a difficult task and slipped it back into his back pocket. After what felt like hours of trekking, Volodymyr stepped into the light from a pipe just large enough for the resistance fighter to break out of. For a moment, Volodymyr wondered what it would take for him to walk the streets like a man- a Ukrainian. One day, he might not need to only love his city from the sewers or the heavens; but from the city itself."

He and his squad had been young, bold, and eager to prove themselves, each dreaming of medals and honors for their heroism. The war turned dreams into nightmares, throwing them into the jaws of hopeless battles and churning out heavy losses. The men who hadn't fallen in battle fell in spirits; after too many disasters and victory over the invaders slipping out of reach, many had deserted well before the war ended. He cursed them as cowards when they fled, bitterly clung to his rifle, and hid amongst the wilderness.\n\nWhen the German army marched on Moscow and drove the Union across the Urals, he still hoped that National Socialists could be driven out. Most of the other men hadn't. It's over. It's pointless. Hasn't there been enough death? It was words that he was all too used to hearing from the cynics, the quitters, the men who gave up. Even still, he kept up the fight.\n\nWhy did he keep going? The following decades seemed to have proven all of his old compatriots right; the Germans seemed unstoppable. He was an older man, and what did he or any of his squad have to show for it? He found his answer as he glanced at the young men in the stolen German vehicle they were watching over a road with and saw the fire in their eyes.\n\nTo give up would admit defeat to evil itself. It would mean accepting the destruction of countless innocent lives. And deep within themselves, they knew that if they gave up and refused to do good, they would never forgive themselves.

Now, however, his very life's work was a crime, punishable by execution. Oleksiy never saw it as that, he saw it as a birthright, an eternal burden to bear, and a responsibility he would never allow himself to forego. Fortunately, the Red Army gave him the paper and ink he'd need to fight for freedom.\n\n"Oleksiy, new posters are coming out, sketches are on the way- did you hear about that weapons seizure last week down from Lysychansk? I heard two cargo containers, but Petro's got money on it being three- what do you think?" The commissar with the pair of manilla folders leaned against the wall nonchalantly as Oleksiy thumbed through the folders.\n\n"Probably two- did they say what dimensions this would be?" Oleksiy asked, to which the commissar held a thoughtful look for a moment.\n\n"No clue. Try the other folder? Anyways, I figure that the cargo's probably rifles or automatics, maybe ammunition? So I figure-" Oleksiy found the paper, stuck to the backside of a page he needed to peel off. "-it'd probably hurt the Germans more than help us at this point, but I see it as more the psychological effect, y'know?"

When the Nazis came to his hometown, the city once marked on its signs as Kryvyi Rih, he was thirteen, and twenty years of occupation left him thin and cynical. The factory he toiled in was rusted and miserable, and the men around him were much the same; even the Germans assigned to them wore bored and tired expressions. He'd been here almost as long as the Germans had been in Ukraine and suspected he'd die long before they left. He had been lucky enough to have caught the eye of a German supervisor and promoted into the factory's limited native administration; it had saved him from a likely premature death from brutal working conditions, but watching the machines chew up dozens of young men just like his younger self would leave scars on his conscience for the rest of his days.\n\nDistantly, he could hear a couple of his fellow supervisors murmuring behind him, sounding a bit more animated than usual. "Found some communist propaganda lying around - the usual; calls to action, please come die for our cause; tore it up and tossed what was left." Andriy couldn't recognize the first man's voice, nor cared to.\n\n"Good," Came a terse reply; Andriy recognized Krystiyan's voice; he was one of the few older men still at work. "I can't believe Shumskyi's gang are still going; are they trying to get us killed? The Germans aren't ever letting us go; they'd kill us all first." Andriy thought he was right, but as he turned his eyes toward the Germans milling around the assembly lines, he couldn't help but notice how dreary and tired they all looked. None looked ready to fight, not for a job they hated. Thinking it over, they weren't even doing their jobs right; the only reason the propaganda wasn't floating around the shopfloor was because of his co-workers. His mental gears clicked into place. The Germans wouldn't die for Ukraine; they would run. The Ukrainian people could win this fight. They could be free. Andriy's eyes became steel, his mind resolved with purpose."

Leaning down to pick up the first aid kit while stumbling, Ivan hit the corner of the doorframe to the decrepit washroom, and felt the tear open even further; from a small crack on his left side, to an ever-widening chasm. Sitting on the ground, forcing himself to stand, Ivan slammed the kit onto the sink's rim, tore its contents open into the sink bowl, found the morphine, and started drinking from the eye-drop container.\n\nGasping while sitting on the wooden board floor, Ivan barely caught himself from blacking out. Looking at his wound, he began pouring a bottle of vodka on his chest, then wrapped bandages over the wound. Pulling himself up with the sink, Ivan limped to the window of the safe house, and only then noticed the dilapidation of the apartment. The furniture had been covered in plastic sheets, the floorboards were rotting, and things seemed to break apart with every step he took. Peering out the yellowed window, Ivan caught the sight of local police Volkswagens racing down the streets, and noticed that the streets were cleared of civilians. Common sense hadn't died yet, apparently. Ivan looked around himself and noticed what seemed to be a radio which stood out solely for its flawless condition- as though it was tuned the day before. Turning it on, it came to a horrendous clamor of static. Turning the volume down, Ivan realized it was most likely to cover some illicit conversations. Tuning it to the Reichskommissariat's local channels, it came on exactly as expected.\n\n"...All are to stay indoors in Vossenitz. Ongoing terrorist activities have been recorded..."

He had been making good progress on writing the manuscript lately, and had even sparked interest from the communist underground as far abroad as Italy. The intellectual environment and resources available in Romanian-occupied Odesa were a far cry from that of Kyiv before the war, but Rozdolskyii had already dedicated four decades of his life to the study of Marx's work, and circumstance would not be sufficient to stop him.\n\nHe thought back to the times before 1941. How straightforward it had all seemed in those days; skipping classes at the Lviv Gymnasium to attend meetings of the illegal Drahomanov Circles, the days of the IRSD and demonstrations against the barbarity of the Great War, the Communist Party of Western Ukraine and the struggle against the Polish authorities - the sense of utter clarity in purpose and infinite revolutionary potential was intoxicating. The reunion of Western Ukraine with the East in 1939 had felt like a crescendo: the mission the KPZU dedicated its existence to achieved at last. How tragic it was that only two years later the Germans would invade, and plunge Ukraine into two decades of unrelenting horror.\n\nStill, though, he kept the fire in his heart. Someday, all humanity would be free. Free from capitalism, free from the nation-state, free from politics, free from capital, wage labor, monetary exchange - all the imposed burdens of bourgeois civilization. This would not be achieved in his lifetime, or perhaps many future lifetimes; but Rozdolskyi felt that he, the Communist Party, and Ukraine in general had, however small or short-lived, some role to play in getting there.\n\nThree knocks on the front door and the sound of someone running away snapped Rozdolskyii out of his reminiscing. He went to the door to find a small, twisted piece of paper shoved under it with a hastily-scrawled message and a hand-drawn red-blue-yellow flag identifying it as legitimate: ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON KOCH SUCCESSFUL - REICHSKOMMISSARIAT IN CHAOS - ARMED STRUGGLE TO RESUME - PARTY ORGANIZATION TO RECONVENE AT DESIGNATED MEETING PLACE.\n\nThe old revolutionary smiled.

Ukraine lies in ruins, and there's no one to clean them up and rebuild our country to the glorious days of the past, to the days of the Union. The young generation, though continuing the fight for the sacred ideals our nation once stood for, among many other brotherly nations, is untested and idealistic - they're doomed to fail, they don't stand a chance in the face of the German occupiers. So I ask, beg you while it's not late - flee Ukraine. There is no hope of ever breaking our chains. I can sense the war coming, the great war we've not seen since the 40s; and while we still have our fragile peace, you should run away from this place.

Resistance, if often sporadic and ineffectual, had begun during the invasion and hadn't stopped since. They lurked beneath the eyes of their oppressors, biding their time until the right opportunity presented itself.\n\nIt was his job to coordinate the movement of supplies. To ensure their partisan bands possessed enough weapons, munitions, and food to last through another day, another week, and another month. That the tenuous lines of supply maintained through sympathizers and smugglers from which food, parts, and bullets flowed were kept open in the face of German crackdowns and 'pacification' operations.\n\nOne day the Ukrainian people would rise against the yolk of their fascist oppressors, break the chains of tyranny, and take their rightful place among their fraternal socialist brethren. All he could do was make sure that they were prepared when that day came."

"We will strike at the heart of their operations and leave them unable to mount any effective resistance."\n\nBut not everyone was convinced. Stetsko spoke up.

Both times the light of Ukrainian freedom was stamped out by Hungarian boots, both times Klochurak had failed his people.\n\nWhen the UPA courier had arrived at his farmhouse door asking to speak to the leader of the Carpathian resistance, Klochurak almost laughed in his face. What resistance? A few old men sharing a bottle of vodka at Christmas and singing songs of times long gone. No, there would be no uprising here, the dream of Carpatho-Ukraine was long gone. And yet, perhaps, Ukraine was not lost. Maybe the partisans in the east could succeed where he had failed. There were still a few stockpiles of guns hidden away in the dirt, and surely he had enough sway to gather some volunteers.\n\nAs he approached the eastern border, the mountain shadows behind him, the old man sat down to make camp, and began to ponder his next destination. Klochurak was still savvy enough to know his support may very well tip the scales in the divided UPA.

They are aware of our needs, and are willing to supply us with weapons and equipment for a substantial price.\n\nThese are businessmen who have minimal sympathy for our goals. They can and will charge as much as they know we can pay, not just for equipment, but also for the movement across national borders. That it is within Pakt territory will result in additional fees.

He and his family were killed by the group that man works for."\n\nShe suddenly went still, the truth about her uncle's death unknown before now. The sweets were forgotten, and her voice was small. "...Why?"\n\n"Because your mother is Polish," he said gently. "They hate Poles, and anyone related to them. Promise me that you'll stay away from him. You aren't safe around him." She swallowed, but nodded sharply."

 UKR_pre_UCW_UPA.13.desc: "The man in Kovel had been but a boy when the world had changed. When his country had fallen under new, German, management.\n\nIn the many years since he had seen the rewards that those who accepted the change could earn. Wealth, land, and influence over their fellow townspeople. He had similarly seen the punishments given to those who did not - there were always a few of them swinging softly in the town square. Each and every one of whom had thought they would be the liberator.\n\nAs he had grown older, the man had therefore chosen the path of reward over the path of punishment. While more than one of his old friends had swung from the bar in the square, he had gained a nice house. A beautiful wife and family. Fertile land to till, and a senior position in the local native administration besides. Life had been kind to him, or as kind as it was possible to be in Ukraine, indeed.\n\nSo when he returned home that day, having just helped organize yet another of the endless searches for contraband and partisan sympathizers, exhaustion turned to elation at the wide smiles of his wife and daughter. It had been hard work, and his wife knew he needed cheering up. Entering the large kitchen, he saw her attempt on the table - a large gift that had been received in the mail, no doubt from the local government commandery. Exchanging a kiss, he smiled again as he opened it, wondering what reward awaited him.\n\nThe explosion destroyed the house entirely, and when investigators found what they thought were his charred remains, they recovered eighty large nails from it. Of his wife and daughter, no trace was found.\n\nNone spoke of the event, of course. There were too many ears around. But the next morning an empty noose appeared on the town gallows. The message had been sent. Clearly."

Straightening, the shadow emerged into the moonlight, and the young man, a new UPA recruit, looked around to see if anyone was watching.\n\nNone were. That was good - the instructors would demand that he return to sleep and, though he was in truth exhausted from the day's activities, he could not sleep. Taking position on the edge of the grounds - the start of the obstacle course - he began running. The course was hard, had been hard even during the day, and was doubly so at night. But yet he ran.\n\nEvery time he slipped, fell, or thought of stopping, he could only see their faces. Hear their screams - mother, father, and little sister all - as the Germans loaded them into the trucks, bound for the massive Reichswerke plants in the west. He didn't know if they were still alive. But he did know that he would stop at nothing to find out.\n\nTo do so, however, he needed to pass training. So he ran. Day in, night out, and at every point in between. He would succeed. He would find them. He would kill any German in his way."

Imports were, after all, unlikely in the extreme. As the man spoke, however, the farmers cast knowing - and worried - glances at each other.\n\nThe officer was explaining how valuable their stocks of fertilizer were for explosives creation. Of how easily they could make improvised bombs and other explosives devices. Of how many Germans, and collaborators, they could kill. All agreed these were correct and good points. What they did not agree upon, though, was how much to use. The fertilizer was critical for crop yield, and many remembered the famines of years gone by.\n\nMuch argument was had back and forth, as the sun fell in the sky and afternoon gave way to evening, but in the end the officer was successful. It was true, he relented, that they risked starvation if they all used their fertilizers for explosives stock. But they risked far worse in reprisals if the uprising occurred and failed.\n\nIt was now or never, he said, and every resource had to be leveraged. Every tool had to be used.

"Give me what the orders you received are."\n\nBoth men presented short papers; short documents detailing where to send the artillery once it was collected. One of them was to send it to a forward outpost, another was to deliver it to a cache, where it would be transported elsewhere. Meanwhile, Rostyslav's orders had been to deliver it to a nearby unit to integrate into their forces.\n\n"And you received these from officers," he questioned further.\n\n"Yes sir," one of them said. "He insisted that it be done without delay. I thought you knew."\n\n"Funny," the other said, shooting him a look. "Mine said that these were to supersede any other orders. I also was under the impression you were aware."\n\n"Enough," Rostyslav lifted a hand wearily. "Clearly, there was some miscommunication. There are three different orders, and apparently everyone assumed I knew." Unfortunately, he didn't think this was a mistake. All of this was very intentional. As much as he hated it, this had all the signs of factionalism.\n\nThat was something that wasn't supposed to be in the UPA, yet here they were. The two men remained waiting.

Watching the soldiers grow more and more excited, agitated, awed - nothing could prove more aggravating.\n\n"We do not take up arms with the hope that the German might scamper away on sight. Never. The pulling of the trigger - that is the act that saves Ukraine. To spill a German's blood is to remind his race that their exploitation of Ukraine was a deadly error. When we meet the Germans tomorrow and inflict that pain a thousand times over, we tell them that message so loud they cannot help but hear it. We were born at the perfect hour to teach such a lesson."\n\nThe crowd erupted into phrenetic applause. Shukhevych and Stetsko stood with the rest of the crowd, a controlled rise in a sea of men jumping from their seats. Their smiles were soft and measured, their legs locked, their eyes narrowed upon Klyachkivsky. Their mechanical motions only faintly hid their attempt to read the man who led this crowd.\n\nBut if anyone noticed, none cared. All they could think about was the battle to come, the day ahead, the war that would someday be won. Their minds hummed, not with the thoughts of tactics or ideology, not even of the battlefield. All they could think of was the glory of victory, and how soon it might come to them all."

 UKR_pre_UCW_UPA.23.desc: "As Klyachkivsky sat in his office, poring over the latest intelligence reports, he couldn't help but think back to the early days of the permanent revolution. He recalled them fondly - fighting against the Poles alongside Shukhevych and the massacres in Galicia and Volyn. For Shukhevych, these massacres had been out of necessity to appease the Germans, but for Klyachkivsky, ideological fervor alone was more than enough justification. Still, both men had fulfilled their duties regardless.\n\nShukhevych had always been a more pragmatic man, willing to do whatever it took to survive and advance the cause. Klyachkivsky admired this aspect of him to a degree -but ultimately believed that this pragmatism would make the OUN forget its ways.\n\nWhen the UPA fractured, and new challenges arose, the once-strong relationship between Klyachkivsky and Shukhevych began to deteriorate. Klyachkivsky's power-sharing and eventual seizure of the organization's leadership had left a bad taste in Shukhevych's mouth, who had assumed that he would become leader, given his years of service and close relationship with Bandera.\n\nKlyachkivsky pondered the tumultuous time of the previous decade. Interfactional disputes in his mind threatened the army and needed to be cleansed. Shukhevych had, of course, disagreed and was more open to a diverse set of views. The bungling of this situation that caused more conflict within the UPA, in Shukhevych's mind - had only furthered the rift between them.\n\nIt was not the time to dwell on the past, though. Any differences between the two men might boil away at the opportunity of a massive uprising against German rule. Both men knew this could happen any day now - and Klyachkivsky secretly hoped this would bring him and his old friend back together and rekindle their camaraderie."

Dmytro Myron and Stepan Lenkavskyi had insisted that they needed to meet with him immediately - and with him alone. A few possibilities ran through Klyachkivsky's mind. Spies? Traitors?\n\nHis answer was in the form of a leaflet, handed to him by Dmytro. "We found several boxes filled with these, hidden well. We immediately confiscated them, and are searching for more as we speak."\n\nKlyachkivsky's face hardened, and disgust filled him as he read the leaflet. A leaflet that was explicitly anti-Banderite, encouraged his overthrow, and championed liberty, democracy, and freedom. He crumpled the leaflet in his palm, as he faced his subordinates, his voice cold.\n\n"How severely have we been compromised?" He demanded slowly. "Communists? Republicans? Do we have a lead?"\n\n"Yes, we do - to a degree," Stepan said slowly. "My Vozhd... these were found in an armory. In a location where the other groups have not been spotted. Loathe as I am to admit it... this isn't being disseminated by an outside force. This is coming from within the UPA."\n\nKlyachkivsky froze in place at that, as possibilities ran through his mind; questions with disturbing answers filling his thoughts. Such treason from within? It couldn't be - not like this. Yet...\n\nHe looked at both men, and knew that they would not intentionally mislead him - they knew the consequences for that. However, this was a very bad sign. And it meant that he had many enemies - ones with resources and influence. Perhaps they were already preparing to move against him. He once more fixed the men with his cold stare, and gave his orders."

Halasa wasn't surprised, as he knew that Klyachkivsky had indicated he wanted to meet about something. "Yes, what can I do for you?" Halasa asked.\n\n"I have a task for you," Klyachkivsky said. "When victory is achieved in the coming war, I am aware of the devastation it will leave behind." One corner of his lip curled up. "The Germans are bastards, but they are keeping the nation afloat economically - and we will need to do the same once we succeed."\n\nIt was something that Halasa was acutely aware of, which made him choose his words carefully, uncertain where this was going. "I certainly agree with that. The economic outlook initially will be... poor."\n\n"And we must act decisively to restore it," Klyachkivsky nodded. "A jumpstart will be required. I want your plans to achieve this."\n\nHalasa kept his face blank, as a sharp alarm surged through him. He was no economist. He could ascertain some basics, but trying to chart a path through a guaranteed economic crisis and reconstruction? That wasn't even close to his role. He couldn't exactly say that, but he was confused why Klyachkivsky was asking him. "I can certainly think of some suggestions - but I believe that Horbovyi is far more qualified to answer this."\n\nKlyachkivsky smiled; a dangerous one. He walked up, and rested a hand on Halasa's shoulder, his eyes boring into him. "I have confidence you will give me the ideas I ask for," he said. "Do not disappoint your Vozhd.""

"That could be a cause for some concern."\n\nKlyachkivsky raised an eyebrow, turning to his subordinate. "Explain."\n\n"Some of the units are no longer reporting to me alone, especially ones recently formed," he answered slowly, calmly. "I wanted to confirm this before I brought it to you, but I am certain now. Some of these officers are also reporting to Maivsky. I don't need to tell you the concern I have."\n\nNo, he did not. Maivsky was an associate of Stetsko and Shukhevych - especially of late. That this was taking place was... disappointing. Expected, perhaps, but disappointing all the same. He wondered what both men were thinking, perhaps they believed him a blind, foolish old man. They would realize their errors in time.\n\n"Keep a close watch on them," he instructed Medvid.

You I can trust, there are others who are... less reliable."\n\nHe paused his pacing, one corner of his lips curled up. "While I wish it were otherwise, it is necessary that each of you be watching for those who speak of treason, or intent to betray us. If such behavior is noticed, you will report it to me immediately."\n\nThere were sharp nods at that, as the officers hung on his words, careful not to miss a single syllable. Halasa opened his mouth, to ask a question all of them had. "Are there any in particular who you would say are... unreliable?"\n\nKlyachkivsky smiled.

Admittedly, there were a few aspects of this meeting that were out of the ordinary, but he was certain the man would do as he instructed. Maivsky was no fool. He could see where Klyachkivsky's leadership would lead, and that he would eventually be a victim of Klyachkivsky's paranoia. He needed an out, an alternative, and Stetsko knew that just by dangling one, the man would seize it.\n\nHe greeted him warmly, as a friend, and while Stetsko exchanged some pleasantries, he didn't take long before getting to the point. Maivsky knew he wasn't here to simply talk. "I need your help, Dmytro," he finally said. "How many of the generals do you trust?"\n\n"I-" Maivsky coughed, apparently taken aback as he took a moment to answer.

The sheer amount of work the man managed was incredible, and few understood the land, or the logistics needed to navigate it, as much as he did.\n\nThus of course, Klyachkivsky had seen fit to ignore the man, for reasons Stetsko could not fathom. Piasetsky was clearly unhappy with where he was, and knew when he was being sidelined. Hard to come to any other conclusion when cronies and sycophants received promotions from Klyachkivsky and not hardworking men like him.\n\nStetsko had no intention of making the same mistake as Klyachkivsky, and was not going to ignore the opportunity it presented. He met Piasetsky one morning, who was doing his usual work, bringing a small gift. It was a trifle for him, but gifts showed someone they were valued - and Piasetsky had taken notice. With a few compliments, expressions of appreciation, and the man was nodding along.\n\nNow to reel him in. "It's a pity you are still stuck in this position," Stetsko finally said.

"The obvious question being who is the right man."\n\n"An administrator, a speaker; a man who can rally the people and bring our vision to life," Stetsko said. "A citizen Vozhd, ideally. One who possesses the skills for such a role. The people will accept one who speaks and acts like them more than a soldier."\n\nRebet nodded slowly. "I do wonder - is a Vozhd necessary at all? Perhaps the position itself is unsuited to our state. An elected Provid would accomplish the same task, with less risk of civilian backlash."\n\nStetsko was taken aback by the suggestion, looking at Rebet with open confusion. Abolish the Vozhd entirely? Allow an elected head of state? What kind of madness was that? He'd assume from anyone else it was a joke, but nothing in Rebet's voice indicated it was. His discomfort only lasted a few seconds, before he laughed. "This is why I like you, Lev. But let's be serious now, shall we."\n\nRebet also chuckled, but he sounded a bit stilted.

Lebed's assessment was blunt, but it wasn't necessarily a cause for alarm yet. It could be a smart precaution in case Klyachkivsky attempted to remove him. Still... "If he's doing this, he may not back us when the time comes."\n\nLebed raised an eyebrow, as if surprised Stetsko had thought any differently. "Of course he won't, and I would dismiss any delusions to the contrary. If he does, I am certain it is temporary. He does not want Klyachkivsky to lead - but he does not want you either. We would have known if he thought differently."\n\nHe knew that Lebed was correct here, but there was a part of him that hoped that this wouldn't be the case. That there was infighting in the UPA was problematic, necessary as it was, but three men vying for control risked much, and could fracture the movement if they weren't careful.\n\nHowever, it was growing clear that no matter how Klyachkivsky was dealt with, he would eventually come into conflict with Shukhevych - which made him nervous. The man would not hesitate to eliminate him if he judged it necessary, and his charisma and competence would lead to many flocking to him.\n\nHe was a very real, and very potential threat.

And in the end... he simply found himself ill at ease. Vasyl was one of the few men he could speak of these feelings to. Though he was not expecting to hear what came out of Vasyl's mouth.\n\n"All of this is because we're clinging to the vision of a long-dead man," Vasyl said, before realizing what he'd said. He hesitated, then finished the thought. "One who might have been wrong."\n\nShukhevych stiffened. This was not something said, even privately. "He was not wrong. Bandera knew what was best for Ukraine. No one else knew what had to be done."\n\nVasyl shrugged tiredly. "Then why does what we do seem to hurt the people we are trying to save? Is this what he wanted us to do? Is this what had to be done? Do you believe this is all we are supposed to be?" He shook his head. "I don't think it is. And I don't think you do either. Otherwise we wouldn't be here where no one else is listening."\n\nShukhevych exhaled, wanting to move past this. The sun was setting, and it was time to leave. "It's time to go. And I would not share what you said with anyone else." Vasyl didn't argue, and both of them left. Though he'd rebuked Vasyl, Shukhevych didn't feel right. Instead he was listening to what Vasyl said, a dangerous question that wormed its way through his mind."

"Bad day?"\n\n"Worse than a bad day. An injustice," Horbovyi complained. "Do you remember the Andriy boy?"\n\nShukhevych shook his head. He didn't remember every boy the UPA conscripted. "Did something happen to him?"\n\nHorbovyi went strangely silent. "He had a grandmother, an ill, starving one by his account. Boy had no family but her, and you take care of your family, no? He tried to get some extra rations for her and was refused. So he steals them, and gets caught." He looked up. "Roman, what would you do with him?"\n\nHe considered. "Lash the boy for theft, but feed his grandmother something. We have some food to spare."\n\n"That's what we'd do in a just world," Horbovyi shook his head. "He was executed this morning." The atmosphere in the room became heavier. "I understand the need to maintain discipline, but this isn't justice. It isn't right, no matter what Klyachkivsky says. I..."\n\nShukhevych continued listening as Horbovyi continued his lamentation, remaining silent as the thought of the executed boy being executed filled his mind."

That was, at least, how the meeting started out. Time passed, they soon wrapped up, and the conversation shifted to something more relaxed.\n\nFamily. Specifically, their children. Each of them had children of varying ages, and parenthood came with no shortage of tales and stories, which each of the men could relate to. Fatherhood was certainly a trying, frustrating, but ultimately rewarding experience.\n\n"I don't know if I'll have another," Voloshyn said, more seriously than they'd been talking previously. "It was hard enough raising one child, and Ukraine is...not the best place to raise a family."\n\n"For now," Shukhevych said firmly. "When we are victorious, other parents, and our children, will be able to raise their children as they deserve."\n\nThere was a short pause in the room. "All I want is for my children to grow in a country which is free, prosperous, and safe," Pozychanyuk said after a moment. He looked between both men, and sharply inhaled. "...I do not know if that is what we are building, even if we are victorious."\n\nThere was a stillness in the room; something spoken which many would have remained silent on. Voloshyn broke the silence.\n\n"Aye," Voloshyn said after a moment, softly. "It is what Klyachkivsky claims, but the longer this goes on..." He looked around the room, as if wondering if he could trust them before he finished. Everyone knew what he wanted to say, and Shukhevych slowly nodded.

He could tell that the people who had gathered weren't fully sure why they were here.\n\nHe wondered if he should feel some doubts, hesitations, or fears. He felt none of those. There came times to make choices, and he had been accepting of how things were for too long. He had been passive. He had been servile in the name of an ideal that was revealed to be an illusion. No longer. There would be no hesitation about what must be done.\n\nBut he couldn't do it alone.\n\nKuk. Horbovyi, Pozychanyuk, Voloshyn, all of these men were ones he could trust with his life. He was doing so once again by placing it into their hands. If he was wrong, then so be it. If he was right, then there was still hope for Ukraine. He waited only a little longer, and began speaking.\n\n"Klyachkivsky has failed us," he said flatly, gauging the reactions. A few widened eyes, and stiffened spines - but none of them seemed surprised. "He has failed the UPA. He has failed to embody Bandera's vision. He has failed Ukraine, and will bring it to ruin if he remains in power. I will not allow him to ruin all we have worked towards."\n\nHe exhaled, his voice steel. "I intend to deal with Klyachkivsky at the earliest opportunity and I will not succeed without your support. That is what I ask from you tonight. You are good men - and I will need such men for what is to come. What say you?"\n\nThere was a brief pause - but he did not have to wait long for an answer.

 UKR_UCW_startup.1.desc: "The solution was simple, obvious, evident - and yet clearly a decision would not be made. No response was coming. Georg Leibbrandt simply could not believe it. Could not believe the stupidity that such inaction implied.\n\nUkraine was disintegrating. It was obvious to any intelligent observer, untrained or not, and the implications of that disintegration, should it be allowed to occur, were staggering. Economically, militarily and, most importantly in Leibbrandt's eyes, ideologically. Ukraine was a proof of concept - it could not be allowed to fall.\n\nYet that is precisely what he saw was about to happen. He had sent his missive to Germania, carefully worded and well-supported by exhaustive empirical evidence, as to why he should, without delay, be appointed Reichskommissar. In order to, of course, stave off the coming darkness.\n\nNo reply had been forthcoming.\n\nWhat had been forthcoming had been reports from all over Ukraine of bandit uprisings and the wholesale slaughter of settler communities. Of disappearing equipment, deserting auxiliaries, and demoralized garrison forces. Of disorder. Of impending systemic collapse. Things were getting much worse much more quickly than anyone else but he could see, and he had to act to correct it before the experiment of Ukraine failed entirely.\n\nHe sent the message again. There was no answer."

 UKR_UCW_startup.2.desc: "At first, the administrators in Kiew thought it a temporary communications outage. Infrastructure as a whole across Ukraine was deplorable, and telephone lines were always cut by the partisans and then replaced in turn.\n\nThen the first motorcycle rider, frantic with energy, reached the city.\n\nHe spoke of a general uprising, far larger than any possible bandit attack, that was overwhelming the entire Donbass. That had already overtaken the regional headquarters in Vossenitz. He said he had only just escaped. He was at first discounted - such was patently impossible, of course. The bandits did not have the organization or the numbers to accomplish such a feat.\n\nBut then other reports arrived of massive revolts, attacks, and ambushes elsewhere in Ukraine. Of entire units being overrun - or simply never reporting at all. No inquiries to Vossenitz were returned. No messengers returned either. Some attempts were made to control this knowledge, but such was simply impossible, and so the panic spread.\n\nAll in the administration knew what the bandits would do to them, knew they had to get out, and efforts at response were thus further weakened by internal dysfunction. The storm was coming, it was clear, and as the picture became more dire, pleas for assistance traveled westward."

 UKR_UCW_startup.21.t: "Bandits No More"
 UKR_UCW_startup.21.desc: "The plan was finally in motion, and the suits in Kyiv, much less their masters in Germania, didn't even know it. U-SSR Partisans who had once assumed the moniker of bandits thrust on them by the media and the government did what they always did, cutting telephone lines and harassing the moving parts of the occupiers' machine. When the lights went out across Donbass, not a single official would bat an eye, even as they were being blindfolded and gagged in preparation for the revolution.\n\nThe cities were suddenly in flames, leftist rebels armed and unarmed wreaking havoc across them in a caustic mixture of galvanized riots and paramilitary operations. Scrambled troops were overwhelmed by the sheer mass of the people's anger, and those that fled found themselves in a countryside so hostile to their very existence that perhaps they would have been safer among the furious rioters than the well-armed, bitter partisans. They at least had more luck than the administrators of the various cities, who called and called to the men in Kyiv to send help but might as well have been screaming at a brick wall with their communications cut. Perhaps one or two slipped away in the fog of war, but the government would still be slow to act, even as Lugansk burned.\n\nTime passed and more and more information escaped the blackout in brief cries for help. Finally, it would seem the Reichskommissariat officials pulled their heads out of the sand once the violence began spilling out of Donbass and into the rest of Ukraine, and faced reality. These were no mere bandits and these were no mere raids, this was a revolution."

The SS officers among him lacked the Prussian demeanor. They were frightened and young, unable to hold their own, blown here and there by any gust of change.\n\nSo they turned to him, a problem solver. Bräutigam and Leibbrandt may preach reform and practice their base politicking, but they never had to put a bullet in a communist once in their lives. As his men continued to look at him expectedly, Ohlendorf rose to deliver his verdict:\n\n"We are already stretched to the brink for men. Tell the garrisons to hold out until we can reinforce their positions, but..." Ohlendorf tapped Kiew's spot on the map as if it were a hidden clause "...our attention must be focused on the core, lest it succumb to opportunistic outbursts of revolution. If we lose that, we will lose our most critical administrative base, leaving our men to be picked off like flies."\n\nThe faces among the officers were mixed. Some could only mourn the inevitable losses their detachments would suffer. Some were just relieved to have the hard choice made for them. But a lingering question remained. "What now?"\n\n"Consolidate our control over the center. If anyone dares to make a move in Kiew, put them into the dirt. Twenty years of work has gone into maintaining our Lebensraum; if it fell, the shame will follow us all and our families into the grave even if we survived.""

Despite our best efforts, it has not been re-established, with only a few frenzied telegrams coming from various Heer garrisons stationed on the border with the General Government being delivered to Kiew. The Generalkommissar of the region has fled. His whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nWhat we do know is fairly basic; various UPA bandit units have seized villages in the northwest and proclaimed a "Ukrainian State". This declaration, which was broadcast on hijacked radio to much of Ukraine was mostly a re-iteration of the Banderite version from 1941, with a few references to the tyranny of Germany and the looming threat of Bolshevism. These new rebels have been exceptionally brutal to the scattered settlements and depleted Heer garrison they have come across, slaughtering hundreds and sending thousands fleeing west through the embattled General Government to a vain hope of safety in Germany, or east towards us and an uncertain future.\n\nBandit military units seem to be made up of hardened guerrillas who recently defected to Schuma. They lack major ordinances but do contain enough manpower to pose a significant threat to our operations in the west. Defense operations by more organized Heer units have yielded some successes in scattering probing attacks directly on our border, but by and large, there has been no stopping the advance.\n\nLocal opinion on the matter seems to be mixed. Bolshevik presence in the area has always been sparse, but it is large enough to provide something of a fifth column to the Banderites. Locals have never exactly taken kindly to the bandits and have reacted by and large with apathy towards the recent uprising. What few popular actions the Banderites have taken have been mere re-distributions of land."

The police could not hold them for long, even when they so hastily resorted to gunning down the rebels and rioters that preceded the well armed UPA troops emerging from the woodwork, furious and determined.\n\nThe cities became battlegrounds, and morale broke under the pressure in an instant. Many of the Ukrainian police could not bear to fight their brothers, laying down arms and joining the nationalist revolutionaries. Those that could retreated in terror or died on the pavement.\n\nAs refugees fled the horrors and messengers crawled back home, command was able to piece together a sitrep. One that read that it was too late. They scrambled troops in vain, but they could not breach the region that rejected them like a virus. Those that were lucky escaped, or at least found a shallow grave quickly. Volhynia was falling, and as much as each of them tried to deny it, the Reichskomissar and his men knew there was little they could do."

Uprisings in the east and south were terrible, yes, but they could in time be suppressed. In the west, however? All knew instantly that the severing of the train and road links to Germania meant that reinforcements, if they were to come at all, would be blocked. Supplies would be interdicted.\n\nAnd though nobody spoke the words, all thought the same - that escape was now almost impossible.\n\nWorst of all were scattered reports that Ohloblyn had actually defected to the bandits, taking both Brest itself - a rail hub crucial beyond all measure - and the local police with him. If such was true, the administrators knew, then how could the reliability of any other units be counted upon? What of their own guards, of the forces around Kiew itself?

Throughout both Brest and Podillia, they had rapidly overrun logistics centers, garrisons, towns, cities, and more, growing in strength and fanaticism with every step and with every victory.\n\nMost important of all was the bloodless capture of Brest, that fortress city, where all had feared they would meet a brutal fight indeed. But through whatever means the upper leadership had devised, Ohloblyn had realized the futility in continuing collaboration, and convinced his compatriots of the same, disarming those few holdouts and opening the gates for them.\n\nIt was an uneasy meeting, indeed, and many within the Guard wanted nothing more than to hang Ohloblyn and his confederates, but the leadership refused.

He'd taken to humming tunes, mentally composing letters and counting cracks in the wall all while pretending he was listening for word from Vossenitz. Such boredom felt grimly out of place in such a tense situation, but he figured being bored was better than the unending stress he'd been consumed by previously, wondering just what terrors were going on in Donbass.\n\nThe radio stuttered a faltering, static hiss. A low voice was straining to break through the veil but was so far unsuccessful. His heart leapt, shocked back into reality by the noise and lifted by reckless optimism. Nearly getting out of his seat, he opted to stay and listen while calling for his superiors. Quickly, a gaggle of Reichskommissariat officers and administrators had gathered around.

Unfortunately for them, the military was occupied, and they got nothing but the dregs even as the fires rose higher in the west. Instead, troop convoys traveled with stilted haste toward Volhynia.\n\nWhat had once been an intelligence black hole was now the undisputed territory of the UPA, whose troops were emerging to meet the growing response. Sources told that they had pushed from Volhynia to Shitomir, painting the gray lands with flame and blood. Before long, the rioting populace was under their control and communication lines had gone silent, abruptly ending a death rattle of urgent cries for help that could not adequately be answered. In the burning cities and ichor-soaked fields, battle lines were forming. From the lowliest soldier digging into the mud to the generals scanning reports, they all knew this was turning from an insurgency to civil war.\n\nRefugees crossed these lines, despite the scorched fields and the cracked roads, patrolled by hateful soldiers or roadblocked by bitter steel and sandbag walls. The growing volume and frequency of gunfire did little to deter them, Ukrainian or German. Neither army was making much distinction in their drive to form a frontline before the situation could escalate.\n\nThe most determined, and shaken, emigrants were Germans, who reported only further violence in their tales of the fall of Hegewald colony to the UPA. They painted a grim picture of the fate of the colony in both haunted tales of violence, and the dead and mutilated they brought with them.

The administrators had been hanged or shot, the police had joined the ranks of the UPA or the dead, and the military had begun to scramble to meet a liberated Ukraine's expanding borders. Word spread in the mouths of fleeing refugees, and with it spread further chaos as dozens of towns burst into the same level of vicious infighting that Volhynia had. The beleaguered collaborationists were stretching thinner and thinner as the UPA advanced on Shitomir, and at that point they could not resist. The battle was brief and bloody, revenge exacted on the defenders by rifle or blade, and the rioters liberated or the same.\n\nA particularly bold advance had been made into Hegewald colony, the UPA wasted no time doing what they deemed necessary and just to the German settlers. All became targets when the irregulars fell upon the land, and few who didn't flee in time remained alive. Those that escaped would stagger with their wounded back to government-controlled territory and tell their tales, of terror in fields that were now empty and scorched. The region, save for the patrols, was as quiet as the grave it was.\n\nThe same could not be said of where UPA territory ended. Fortifications were dug and barricades raised as on the horizon could be seen the reaction of the government, sending in what few men they could spare from the chaotic mess the rest of the country had become. With control within Volhynia and Shitomir established, and the UPA's expansion finally reaching an object of resistance, it was clear the battle lines were being drawn.

The fact was, that across Ukraine, they had lost significant authority. Beyond most of the larger cities and rural settler regions, they might as well have no presence.\n\nA problematic situation, but the cities were the most important.

Several things had happened in quick succession following their unveiling to the nation.\n\nThey had quickly gained the support of Ohloblyn, as well as fully seized Vinnytsia after some brief skirmishes. In a matter of days they'd established themselves as firm opponents to the false government, gained momentum politically and publicly, and were well-positioned for the war to come.\n\nThis was all the easy part.\n\nYuriy knew very well that things were not fully in their favor. While the Germans had lost authority across vast swathes of Ukraine, they still held many of the cities, as well as the German settler-populated rural regions. They were certainly weakened, but they were definitely not helpless or incapable of responding.\n\nMuch of what happened next depended on how well the Nazis were able to organize themselves. With any luck, they would tear themselves apart trying to vye for power in Koch's absence. Otherwise, he would need to rally as much support, men, and resources to the Republic.

 # 7.3.9 - Post-Koch Chaos Chain

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.1.t: "Partisan Activity Skyrockets"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.1.desc: "It is now obvious to all that the attack on Reichskommissar Koch was not an isolated incident, but was rather the commencing action in a wider campaign of destabilization.\n\nReports have reached us of an explosion in bandit activity throughout the state, occurring not only in contested areas but in regions previously considered pacified, suggesting a disturbing level of both planning and subversion. Garrisons are being overwhelmed, and there are insufficient forces available to affect immediate reinforcement.\n\nWorse yet, calls for assistance - to Germania or otherwise - are not being returned, and supplies are beginning to run low. There can be no doubt that the state is now engaged in a struggle for existence, and it is far more likely that the situation is going to get worse before it gets better.\n\nWe must prepare ourselves, as best as we are able, for what is to come."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.1.a: "Dark days begin."

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.2.t: "The Communist Resurgence"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.2.desc: "Reports have arrived from the few garrisons that have managed to defeat initial and vigorous bandit attacks. They have identified their assailants as communists - previously thought all but exterminated.\n\nThis in itself would be grave news, but far worse than the identity of the attackers is the location of the attacks, which occurred not only inside but also beyond the Donbass. They have spread their poison without discovery, and are now exploiting the lack of preparation of 'secured' areas to cause immense destruction.\n\nMore attacks are reported every day, and their complexity and effect are only increasing. Worse, the intensity of those operations appears unaffected by the severity (or lack thereof) of the anti-bandit operations decreed for any one area, a phenomenon not seen since the West Russian War.\n\nThis is a terrible portent for both stability and serenity, and we must expect attacks to continue to increase in intensity until a resolution can be found."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.2.a: "The Communists are still here?"

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.3.t: "The Ukrainian Hydra"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.3.desc: "For decades, the primary threat to the state from the Ukrainian republicans was the UPA. The dedication, extremism, and absolute hatred for our administration ensured that, despite their status as bandits, that they were a dangerous and enduring foe.\n\nRecent republican attacks, however, have increasingly originated from other, smaller organizations. The organizations of both Borovets and Horlis have exploded in both size and capability - missed by the security services - and should be considered just as or even more dangerous than the UPA itself. What's worse, they have proven surprisingly well equipped, having acquired or otherwise stolen German equipment from an unknown source.\n\nWhile we must be ready to engage them at a moment's notice, the one reprieve we have been granted is an apparent disunity between them and the UPA at large, with reports of intercine skirmishes between them at multiple locations. This divides their efforts, blunts their effectiveness, and saps their respective strengths.\n\nWe must take advantage of this, where able."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.3.a: "There is no end to them..."

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.4.t: "A Reborn Nightmare"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.4.desc: "Following the so-called 'Second Struggle,' it was believed that the UPA had been essentially destroyed through the actions of both the state's security services and local garrison-based anti-bandit operations. Clearly, this belief was in error. Grave error.\n\nUnder Klyachkivsky's leadership, the UPA has been reinvigorated, has recovered much of its strength, has obtained significant quantities of arms, and has planned a coordinated offensive against both the administration and its ideological enemies. Going by the reports of our field commanders, it has been very successful in this.\n\nAttacks have been observed against all groups the UPA brands as enemies: democrats, communists, Germans, and even the remaining Polish population. The attacks themselves have been vicious and terroristic in nature, and the only positive thought that we can extract from this is that such a universal offensive wins them no friends and many enemies, blunting their effectiveness towards us and dividing their focus.\n\nWe must exploit this, for they are possibly the single greatest threat to the security of our regime, and were they to emerge victorious, there would be scant mercy towards any of us."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.4.a: "They were only waiting..."

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.5.t: "Chaos Near Mykolaiv"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.5.desc: "Despite the state's best efforts, banditry continues to increase across Ukraine. While there is of course a massive increase in the general level of chaotic action, the current focus of the security forces is the Mykovaiv region.\n\nThere, the forces of the UA-SSR - a mockery if there ever was one - have risen, and are far more organized than any in the administration previously thought. Local security commanders have of course taken action, and reprisals against the bandits have increased tenfold. This has been responded to by a number of assaults upon our garrisons, ambushes upon our patrols, and other crimes on the bandits' part.\n\nGiven the surprising intensity of the conflict, it is not yet clear whether the bandits or our security forces will emerge victorious. We can only hope for the former. Should an alternative occur, it would spell disaster for any stabilization efforts in the future."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.5.a: "For the sake of the Reichskommissariat, we hope that doesn't happen."

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.6.t: "The Battles of Shitomir"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.6.desc: "Perhaps nowhere else in the country is more reflective of the anarchy than Shitomir. There, nearly every flavor of bandit clashes with both state security forces as well as each other. RK, UNRA, UPA, and UA-SSR all are present in great numbers, and casualties among all sides increase by the day.\n\nSo too does the intensity of the violence. Bandits of course know no limits on brutality, and security forces are required to not only respond in kind, but also to escalate in response. This cycle has continued for some time, and despite the shocking atrocities inflicted upon the population by so-called 'freedom' fighters, there appears to be no end in sight.\n\nMany claim that the Reichskommissariat is on the verge of collapse but as the fighting here - in the most volatile region - shows, state security forces remain committed to protecting the integrity of the administration. Reinforcements have been dispatched, and support to the garrisons has increased, but as of yet none can say whether such aid will prove decisive.\n\nAs hard as it is to do so, we must wait for the final reports."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.6.a: "And hope that order emerges victorious."

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.7.t: "Eastward Flight"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.7.desc: "The vicious bandit attack upon Reichskommissar Koch was, we now know, but a portent of things to come. The explosion in bandit activity - clearly preplanned - has forced the state to take drastic action.\n\nOne of the most consequential of which is in the western regions. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else corruption, bandit subversion, and general malfeasance has led to countless reports of treasonous activity. Desertions, defections, and outright betrayals by auxiliary units abound, and drastic action must be taken in response.\n\nWe will, for a time, withdraw the most unreliable portions of the state apparatus eastwards. Auxiliaries, Ukrainian support staff, and others of questionable loyalty will be evacuated to more secure regions. Those of unquestionable loyalty - namely Wehrmacht garrisons and SS troop detachments - will remain, and be empowered with an even freer hand for operational discretion.\n\nWe must have victory over the bandits. Once that is achieved the auxiliaries can return. Minus the infiltrators we will dig out of them."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.7.a: "Untrustworthy swine."

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.8.t: "The Crackdown"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.8.desc: "Finally, and after much loss and withdrawal, the counterattack against the bandits begins. Led at the vanguard by Ohlendorf and the SS units present within the state, they have moved decisively to retake control and stabilize the situation.\n\nThough much has already been lost, the recent days and weeks of desperate fighting have at least allowed sufficient time for the state to mobilize new formations of auxiliary troops - tested for loyalty and confirmed to be so - and reform regular Wehrmacht units to act in support. Operating at Ohlendorf's instruction, they have retaken many areas, rearward and otherwise, and stabilized many areas previously invaded by the bandits.\n\nThere are, however, many reports of extremely aggressive action and reprisals taken against bandit-supporting civilian population concentrations, with casualties running into the many thousands. Given the circumstances, these have been deemed necessary and reasonable. Such actions have pacified the areas, regardless of the severe anger displayed by the Ukrainians.\n\nThey will have to live with it."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.8.a: "It will do. For now."

 UKR_post_koch_chaos.9.t: "The Aftermath"
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.9.desc: "The state's counteroffensive has been successful. Mostly, inasmuch as the core of the state can be considered stabilized and we are in no danger of imminent collapse.\n\nBut we are far from victorious. Far from forgiven.\n\nLarge swaths of the countryside, and more than a few urban areas, cannot be considered to be under state control, and the war against the bandits is in no way close to completion. Violence is sure to increase, even past the heights to which it has already ascended, and despite the necessity of reprisals, such actions are sure to swell the bandits' ranks.\n\nBeyond such considerations also lies, of course, Germania. Terse communications have indicated that the Heimat is giving the state space and time, but this is not unlimited - and the grain quota must still be fulfilled. It will be. Continued support demands it.\n\nThe fight will continue, and though our victory will likely be one over a much reduced country, one of severe devastation and destruction - the bandits will ensure it - it will be a victory. The state, and its lands, can be rebuilt.\n\nAfter all, we have done it before."
 UKR_post_koch_chaos.9.a: "Twice, in fact."

 ## 7.4 - UCW EVENTS ##
 # DESIGN PENDING
 UKR_UCW_RK.1.t: "Shotgun Solidarity"
 UKR_UCW_RK.1.desc: "The conference rooms of the RK in Kiew had been nothing better than dens of intrigue for years. These were not the rooms in which great decisions were made, empires made and lost - these were smoke-filled backrooms, where government officials greased their way to power through corruption and petty plotting.\n\nNow, though, with the enemy at the gates, the smoke had dispersed like clouds in sunlight. Leibbrandt, Bräutigam and Ohlendorf sat together, pale as ghosts, where they once would have been whispering away to their associates in some dim corner of the room. Across from them sat a bevy of generals, Weinmann chief among them - not here, for once, to beg for rations or call in some dirty favor from the party men. One could almost imagine Metternich and Napoleon sitting in this room, deciding the future of a continent.\n\n"How much of the country is under our control?" asked Leibbrandt, beginning proceedings. His voice had an unusually thick edge to it, like he was trying to choke down food while speaking.\n\n"Most of the east and the Donets Basin is controlled by the communists," Weinmann replied. "The west is split between the Polissian Guard and the Banderites. The Dnieper, for the moment, remains under our control. But we need to decide on a plan of action. The partisans can be counted on to fight each other, yes, but they will undoubtedly annihilate us if given the opportunity."\n\n"We must have a full mobilization," Ohlendorf interjected. "This situation demands all of our efforts. This is not just some local disturbance - this is a fully fledged rebellion."\n\nOnce upon a time, Bräutigam and Leibbrandt might have argued, for no better reason than not to let their rival have his way. Now, though, with their lips drawn tight, they merely nodded."
 UKR_UCW_RK.1.a: "There can be no squabbling, not anymore."

 UKR_UCW_RK.2.t: "Deafening Silence; Crackling Static"
 UKR_UCW_RK.2.desc: "The only thing worse than the static was the silence.\n\nAgain Commander Alexander Conrady tried to make contact with Germania.\n\nAgain there was nothing.\n\nHe spoke into the static regardless, in the vain hope that the connection would fix itself; that someone, anyone, would pick up. "This is Military Commander in Ukraine Alexander Conrady with an emergency message to Germania. We are under attack, and facing multiple coordinated partisan uprisings across Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Repeat, we are under attack and require immediate support."\n\nAnd still there was nothing.\n\nNo one knew what was going on in Germania now. The entire Pakt appeared to have exploded at the same time. From Ostland to even Poland, the entirety of Eastern Europe seemed to be engulfed in violence and chaos, of which Germany itself was not immune to. And still he continued trying to raise Germany for what seemed like hours.\n\nEach time was met with static or silence.\n\nHe continued trying, repeating the single message until his voice became dry; the single plea for support, while privately wondering what they would do if no help came - as seemed more likely with each passing second. Would they be able to put down this uprising? Did these insurgents truly pose a threat?\n\nCertainly not, but he was concerned about how much damage they would inflict before they were put down. Eventually, he was forced to accept the cold, unforgiving truth. No one was coming to save them. Germany was silent."
 UKR_UCW_RK.2.a: "They were on their own."

 UKR_UCW_RK.3.t: "Anabasis"
 UKR_UCW_RK.3.desc: "Tired, hungry, and abjectly terrified, the settlers emerged from hiding the morning after the insurgent assault on Shepetivka.\n\nThey had spent an eternally long night huddled in their shelter, wishing they had been brave enough to fight as they heard the screams of their neighbors. Hoping they would not be found as those screams ceased, one by one. Seeing the devastation around them that morning, they gathered what they could and left with haste.\n\nBut the forests had no succor to give. Safer than the roads, perhaps, especially after they saw what the partisans did to those they captured upon it, but no haven, indeed. At first they had thought the swaying figures to be animals - and then they drew closer, and the horrible truth was revealed.\n\nThe father recognized one of them - a man from the village, who clearly had the same intention as they. He had been gutted before being strung up from the tree, as. As had his wife and children, though more tortures had been practiced upon them. The family looked closely, said nothing, and trudged on, eschewing food or sleep in pursuit of progress towards safety.\n\nEventually, after several days and many more horrific sights of bandit retribution, the city appeared on the horizon, and when they saw the Stahlhelms of the checkpoint sentries, every member of the family broke into tears of relief.\n\nKiew was freedom, for now. But the father, even as he comforted the others, could not but reflect. The last atrocity had been only twenty minutes away."
 UKR_UCW_RK.3.a: "How long before they are here as well?"

 UKR_UCW_RK.4.t: "A Reorientation of Forces"
 UKR_UCW_RK.4.desc: "The longer this discussion dragged on, the more impatient Ohlendorf became. He didn't know they were ignoring clear solutions out of incompetence or self-destructive pride, but he was not going to keep silent much longer. Not when there was a clear solution to the partisan threat that no one was proposing.\n\n"There is a practical solution here," he finally said when there was a lull in the conversation. He intended to be brief and present it with as little bias as he could muster. He disliked he had to coach his suggestions in such a way, but both Leibbrandt and Bräutigam would view any suggestion that relied on another as a power play. "We redeploy my forces from the east to the north."\n\nAs he'd expected, that got the attention. "And why would your men make a difference?" Bräutigam asked. Ohlendorf resisted the urge to scowl, not sure if the man was being intentionally dense or not.\n\n"Because unlike our regular divisions, my men have experience with anti-partisan warfare - successfully at that," he answered. "The partisans can fight in the east forever, and it wouldn't matter. Kiew is their prize; it is a symbol, and so long as we hold it, they cannot claim legitimacy."\n\nLeibbrandt considered it for a moment, then nodded. "I agree. Disrupting any efforts to liberate, or even threaten, the capital is a better usage of our limited forces."\n\nOhlendorf gave the Acting Reichskommissar a short, thankful nod, glad that he could see some reason. "That will be what we do," Leibbrandt declared. "Ohlendorf, mobilize your men and ensure that these partisans cannot threaten the capital. Let them burn themselves out in the east."\n\nOhlendorf nodded sharply. "It will be done.""
 UKR_UCW_RK.4.a: "Revolution thrived on symbols and victory. Denial would starve them into irrelevance."

 UKR_UCW_RK.5.t: "A Tour in Gotenland"
 UKR_UCW_RK.5.desc: "Since his return to Ukraine, Otto Ohlendorf rarely managed to get back to Germany. The work of suppressing the subhuman was endless and taxing, especially when having to deal with the broken pluralism of the Security Council. Though his prussian sense of duty would never allow for a proper vacation, a visit with the Gauleiter in Gotenland was welcome, and so Ohlendorf eagerly accepted the task.\n\nUnfortunately for Ohlendorf, this cordial talk had soon turned into little more than another inspection. Maierhofer, desperate to return confidence to his region, wasted no time in showing Ohlendorf all kinds of preparations. To some extent, such "pleasantries" were a part of diplomacy. But when Germany's fate was on the line, Ohlendorf hardly had patience.\n\nThings became worse once Ohlendorf began taking the inspection seriously. The military was split between several different commands, leaving soldiers on the ground confused. The lines of fortifications would crumble once a single weak point was found. Maierhofer, unwilling to commit to Ukraine, was going to waste his last resources on trifles.\n\nAs the truck carrying the Gauleiter and Ohlendorf pulled into the NSDAP Taurien headquarters, Ohlendorf felt he had to voice what this tour had truly made him think. "I will be blunt with you, Herr Maierhofer, because I have to be. All of these preparations are just bluster in the long run - they can only survive as long as our administration remains in control. Your Gau cannot survive an onslaught from the Ukrainians. All these men and guns would be better spent on the front lines.""

 UKR_UCW_RK.60.desc: "Ohlendorf's driver began crossing the Dnieper. The police chief stared over the note he had managed to secure from Herr Maierhofer, considering how he might use his new gains. The final agreement was long and a little tedious - Gotenland was, unsurprisingly, anxious about every detail - leaving a surprisingly thick stack of pages to examine.\n\nDespite all the detail, the core was summarized in the first line: "For the purpose of securing the territory of the Reich, the Gau of Gotenland will provide a shipment of supplies, primarily military in nature, to be utilized by the Reichskommissariat Ukraine and its Wehrmacht forces as they see fit."\n\nAnd then, it continued into an itemized list of charges: money, some guns, minor support across the board. It wasn't truly what Ohlendorf had come here for - if he had his way, Gotenland would be sending its entire army rather than trying its own separate defense. Yet the conversations with Maierhofer made it clear they weren't willing to go further. These gifts would be about as much as Ukraine could hope for."
 UKR_UCW_RK.60.a: "Hopefully, even these crumbs could help turn the tide."

 UKR_UCW_RK.61.t: "Gotenland Turns Its Back"
 UKR_UCW_RK.61.desc: "Ohlendorf's driver began crossing the Dnieper. The police chief fumed to himself privately, facing towards the window so that his driver could not see his frustration. This visit had ended as a humiliation, and with hours left on the cautious ride back to Kiew, Ohlendorf had a long while to let that feeling simmer.\n\nNo agreement in his hands. No deal.\n\nIt was ridiculous. Ohlendorf did not think of himself as quick to anger, but to leave without even a gun from the Gotenland government made it clear that they had no respect for their past, let alone any aptitude for planning. Gotenland was ultimately an appendage of the Ukrainian project, one designed and enforced by RKU planners. Now, that Crimean set was willing to bet everything on their own defense, before their forces had even seen combat. They were letting Ukraine die, and all it would buy them is a few more days if the Reichskommissariat fell."

 UKR_UCW_RK.70.desc: ""Dear Representative Bräutigam,\n\nI was moved by your government's efforts to contact me, and I have decided with consultation from my ministers of Staff and Foreign Affairs that a small amount of assistance can be arranged. Consider it a gesture of good faith between our great nations, a strengthening of the alliance that holds Bulgaria and Germany together. Ukraine is a beautiful land, one I visited on a vacation to Theodorichshafen just two summers ago. It cannot be overrun by the madness of extremism.\n\nYours,\nBoris III, King of Bulgaria"\n\nHans-Otto Bräutigam held the letter in his hands. It wasn't perfect - For one, the assistance was merely small shipments of excess guns and foodstuffs; for another, Boris III seemed not to know that Theodorichshafen was not actually in Ukraine. Nevertheless, it was certainly better than nothing. Bräutigam had found himself a win, and Ukraine could last a few days more."

I wish, truly and deeply, that I could prevent the revolution happening in your midst - alas, a similar conspiracy exists within my own borders, and both my vigilance and my government's assets are entirely tied up in this separate anti-partisan activity. In order to preserve the integrity of my own nation, I must decline. Nevertheless, best of luck to you, and may we meet in person under more pleasant circumstances.\n\nYours,\nBoris III, King of Bulgaria"\n\nHans-Otto Bräutigam held the letter in his hands. It seemed that the Kingdom of Bulgaria would not provide any kind of assistance. No great loss - Bulgaria was always the biggest longshot, even if the rejection still stung a little.

"We have a notable number of men in the Luftwaffe who are, practically speaking, useless," Conrady was saying. "There are enough of them to form several divisions, which we can use to stabilize our front in the east."\n\nLeibbrandt was, for some baffling reason, seriously considering this as he nodded thoughtfully. "Shoring up the front lines is essential to regaining control. The divisions appear to be experiencing... problems."\n\n"Precisely, Reichskommissar," Conrady said - and Ohlendorf didn't fail to note that the man was intentionally avoiding calling him 'Acting' in any capacity. "What the men need-"\n\n"What the men need is better training, equipment, and leadership," Ohlendorf interrupted, his voice even as the frustration was close to boiling over. "The issue with the divisions is not one of manpower, Commander, which I would expect you to know. Morale is non-existent; service is seen as a punishment. Nothing you propose addresses the action problems we face!."\n\nConrady stiffened, glaring at Ohlendorf. "I know well the state of our military, Ohlendorf. And I know what must be done. The east cannot be lost, and this allows us to hold it."\n\n"While your concerns are noted, Ohlendorf, I agree with the Commander," Leibbrandt finally said. "We need divisions and men in the field. Any further issues can be resolved when order is restored. Commander, execute this initiative." Ohlendorf quietly fumed, as the Commander nodded, apparently pleased with the decision."

To actively state his supremacy on topics of enforcement was legal and just, yet still a move so fiery as to make Leibbrandt pause. At the end of the day, the deputy liked writing, convincing. He was not one to strong-arm.\n\nBut it had to be done. A nation was a complex thing, but a party was simpler, a collection of humans who had the same foibles as all of humankind. Even the strongest Aryan still felt the pull of the group, moving them towards whatever positions seemed most defensible. Even Rosenberg, in weaker moments, began to hesitate and allow himself to be convinced by the pull of others- perhaps that is what allowed the SS and so many other plotters to take him down.\n\nLeibbrandt had tried to find unity, but talking had proven ineffective. Bräutigam and Ohlendorf were not interested in following orders - at the end of the day, they were biased by their own self-interest. Common ground was not worth finding with a group that would not even support their own Reichskommissar when Ukraine itself was collapsing. Common ground was a fiction that had destroyed Rosenberg, along with so many other brilliant minds left as "radicals." To save a nation, to save a mindset, the right move was a bold play."

He had seen it in the economic office, not with his own victories but with the failures of others, and even himself. The vicious, controlled Ohlendorf won political battles, improved the economy, and enforced Nazi ideology with fire and bullet. The compromised, watered-down Ohlendorf watched Ukraine burn. His duty was to his nation and party, but his trust could only extend to those who supported true National Socialism, not dogs like Leibbrandt and Bräutigam who sought to dismantle it.\n\nOhlendorf had sat in on so many meetings, listened to so many proposals for "unity", for "an answer." At first, the idea was worth considering. Later on, it was at least worth putting on a show for the wider party. Now, not even the most dedicated acolyte to the party line felt any loyalty to the wider systems.

Instead, it seemed he would be taking whatever connections he could and attempting to build his own power base.\n\nBräutigam hated being cynical. His work was in reform, in salvaging the mess of a nation that had been destroyed by prior administrations - an idealist drive defined his very government. Yet with time, it was becoming clear that Leibbrandt and Ohlendorf had enough strong connections to prevent any real change. They could, and were, holding the system back, allowing only their own opinions to be seen as "right".\n\nNow, after the last attempt at some kind of "unity-building" ended in destruction, there was no reason to pretend that an easy solution was possible.

He caught a glance of a cameraman giving a thumbs-up to Ohlendorf - they had captured enough footage of the army - it was time for their proclamation.\n\nOhlendorf, Bräutigam, and Leibbrandt walked onto the stage, with the former two lining up on either side of the podium with their own microphones before Leibbrandt stood to speak. Brux felt confused, he thought it was just going to be Ohlendorf doing the proclamation, likely a result of some political intrigue detached from his purview.\n\n"In recent days, we have seen new heights of terror inflicted upon us by the wretched." Leibbrandt's tone was well-rehearsed, and a conscious effort was made to sound like an authoritative leader instead of a quixotic professor. "The peace our glorious armed forces have brought to this land is faltering thanks to this outbreak of instability and so, our people suffer-"\n\n"The Germans suffer, but so do the Ukrainians..." Bräutigam's comment blindsided both Leibbrandt and Ohlendorf. A few whispers emanated from the crowd between soldiers. "This chaos harms everyone, the sooner it is dealt with, the better."\n\n"Yes... thank you for that interjection Herr Bräutigam." The words barely broke free from his mouth as Bräutigam politely smiled. "We call upon you, protectors of the natural order, to keep this hallowed peace-"\n\n"To forever cull the pervasive threat of Judeo-Bolshevism!" Ohlendorf seized the moment for himself to rapturous applause from the men and halted clapping from his two adversaries. The speech would continue in this back-and-forth farce.

Careerists demanded extra scraps for their various interests. Reformists, as usual, voiced a torrent of endless complaints in a variety of deaf ears. After a dozen arguments, a plan was agreed upon, and quietly sent off to those administrators who remained on Ukrainian soil.\n\nA German would get 2100 calories a day, around what the doctors advised for an Aryan diet. They were needed, after all, as the bedrock of German rule. Should they perish, a half-dozen settlement campaigns, the very essence of the Four-Year Plan office, would be for not. It was only logical that Ukraine's most vital citizens - the Germans - receive its greatest bounty.\n\nUkrainians would be divided into two camps. For those who required energy to serve in the war effort, they could be afforded 1500 calories - not enough to live comfortably, but enough to remain active over the long time-span expected of the war. Those without purpose to the German cause would receive only 1000 calories. This would cause within them a meager condition, leaving them incapable of working towards subversive ends.\n\nPrisoners of war would be afforded just 500 calories. As enemies of the state, their welfare ran contrary to the Reich's cause.\n\nFood smuggling and hoarding would be strictly forbidden, and for Ukrainians, punishable by prison sentence or death."

His men did the same - miserable it was, but it would be their only meal for quite some time. Even forcing the Ukrainians to starve didn't create enough food to go around.\n\nAt some point, the bowl before him sat empty. The spoon dangled listlessly from his hand. The candle on the table was mesmerizing, dancing and fluttering like some exotic insect. Heinz stared into it, watching the movement, sinking deep into it, as the world around him dissolved into...\n\n-\n\n"Bed!" Heinz shouted, lurching to his feet. Christ. How long had he been just sitting there? How long had they been sitting there? Now all his men were staring at him. Shit.\n\n"Get to bed," he continued, steadying himself with one arm on the table. "You're dismissed. Move!"\n\nFirst lesson in staving off hunger. Sleep is a state of reduced metabolic activity.

Banditry had been a serious problem for decades, yes, but the majority of Ukrainians remained passive and though slow, reform and development increased every year. But years of careful work had been undone in only weeks.\n\nHunger was universal. A hungry man would do anything to eat, and would not forget what had caused that hunger. Such was the case now. Bandit populations were only growing, and the policy did not, would not, and could not ever do anything but worsen the situation. He had to make them understand.\n\nWorking through the day, he was interrupted by Leibbrandt, himself departing from a functional meeting on the policy. Reading the memo, the man gave him a curt nod and told him that a memo to the same effect had been sent by Bräutigam's own uncle many years prior. They had not listened then, he said, and they would not now. 'A waste of paper,' was Leibbrandt's evaluation, given before he departed.\n\nBräutigam sat for a long time, deep in thought.

Not Ukrainians. When your comrades were doubled over with stomach cramps, retching and crying, what kind of man wasted food on animals?\n\nThe man - Hempfner, that's what his name was - he was so terribly thin. The skin pulled tight around his skull as he looked up at Heinz, silent pleading in his eyes. Did Heinz look like that too? It had been so long since he looked in a mirror.\n\nHe'd been feeding the Ukrainians out of his own rations. In another world, Heinz might have sympathized. But now? When every bite of gravel-bread had to be taken at gunpoint, there was no room for humanist impulses.\n\nProtocol dictated that he make a speech at this point, telling Hempfner why he was going to do what he was going to do as his commanding officer, such and such and such. But Heinz really didn't have the words in him right now, and it wasn't as if Hempfner didn't know why he had to die.\n\nSo, with a sigh and a pitying gaze, Heinz pulled his pistol from his waistband."

Or they'd be having breakfast, and you'd be spared the effort of looking under dressers and in hay bales for bites of rye bread.\n\nThat being said, though, they weren't the only ones resupplying. As Heinz surveyed the village through his binoculars, all he saw was devastation. Smoking wrecks of houses, ashes blowing through the streets - someone else had been here, and recently. Heinz's stomach raged at the thought of another hours-long trek to the next village over.\n\nWith a sigh, Heinz handed the binoculars back to the orderly and rubbed his gloved hands together. His greatcoat flapped around him in the wind - had it always been that big on him? He murmured for a map, and spread it across the ground as the first sunrays broke over the horizon to the east.\n\nThere. A few miles to the north, another village. Would it still be standing? Or would whoever had burnt this village down be lying in wait for them there, ready to give them a quick end to this nightmare?\n\nHeinz refolded the map and gave it back to the orderly, and sat on the ground for a moment. He spent a little while watching his breath mist up in front of him in the frigid morning air, before slowly getting to his feet again. Without a word, the company moved off."

No matter how much he stole, how many houses he and his men tore apart in search of grain, it was never enough to keep the specter away.\n\nHe traced the outlines of his bones, standing ever starker against the flesh as the weeks went by. His hair, once a fine coal-black, began to turn rust-colored and dry. And still he marched ever onwards, taking just enough bread to live another day, and occasionally firing a few shots for good measure. Some days, he could barely remember who he was fighting.\n\nThe men of his command dwindled. Some simply sat down and refused to get up again - those they left. Others tried to run - those they shot. Weren't they supposed to be shooting someone else? His brain was so fogged up these days.\n\nHeinz could encircle his waist with his two hands now. He laughed manically as he did so, his eyes brimming with tears.\n\nHe had lived in Germany once, hadn't he? He had, let's see... a brother? No, he was dead. Parents?\n\nThere was no way out. Where would he run to? Even if his men didn't kill him, the Ukrainians certainly would. And why would he run? He was too hungry for such nonsense.\n\nHis damned gun was jammed again. As he fiddled around with the chamber it slammed shut on his thumb. Heinz howled in pain, and sank to the floor. The warm blood soaked through his gloves and dripped out onto the ground. Heinz raised his eyes skywards. Surely he hadn't done enough to deserve this?\n\nHe had a son. Heinrich. At home, with his wife.

Fires had been set, and Zhdanovs thrown as the terrorists had tried to burn whatever they couldn't kill. The streets had been filled with corpses, and the sounds of gunfire as rain had poured down, turning the streets into muddy misery.\n\nYet against the odds, they had stopped the initial attack. His face scarred from a Zhdanov, and caked in dirt, Franz was not deterred, but eager for payback. Their attempts to kill him had failed, and he'd successfully regrouped his forces - and set them against where the terrorists were hiding.\n\nBe it overconfidence or simple incompetence, the Ukrainians hadn't truly bothered to hide their camp, which they had retreated to after their initial failed attack. Some of his men told him to hold in place, to wait for support or reinforcements, which Franz had ignored. He knew that no help was coming anytime soon, and doubted men could be spared regardless - so they had to make do with what they had.\n\nThe Germans descended on the partisan camp, breaking the meager defenses with an ease even Franz was surprised by. Their uniforms solided, ripped, and bearing the markings of battle, they dismantled the camp, and subdued what Ukrainians hadn't been killed in the initial assault. Leaders and officers were taken away to be interrogated, while the remaining soldiers summarily executed.\n\nAs more rain fell, Franz was sure more attacks would come - but the advantage the partisans had enjoyed was lost.

The administration had demanded it, and so the attempt would be made. But this was Ukraine, and all knew very well what that meant.\n\nThe meeting began, agendas were set, and the first roadblocks were hit. All agreed that the Council offered the best venue for unity, and indeed slow progress was made on the articles desired, but then questions were raised about how the forum would work - and so began, identified by those members with long experience in Ukrainian dysfunction - the undoing.\n\nOne member raised the question of authority. Was the Council's mandate absolute, or was there some other power? This resulted in two opposing proclamations by other members, who were soon supported by factions around them. Arguments subsequently grew, and before long the 'debate' occupied all remaining time, with nothing of note being accomplished.\n\nAs they left, those with wagers either rejoiced in profit or suffered in loss, their fears being well-founded.

Alas, it does not bear further contemplation, hopefully, it teaches Ukrainians what happens if they forsake us.\n\nKlyachkivsky, Shukhevych, Stetsko, and the rest of the leadership that led their men to attempt to reach for an unattainable folly will be executed, they are all too dangerous and unpredictable to be kept alive. I'll need to remind Ohlendorf to make the affair as quick and quiet as possible. Those loyal Ukrainians among our ranks hold respect for those delusional romantics, no need to alienate our collaborators by turning the half-mad into martyrs.\n\nAs a show of our magnanimity, we will spare those low-ranking members who have not been indoctrinated enough by the false prophet Bandera.

On the count of three, they busted through the door - Shukhevych attempted to fire upon them was struck down with a bullet wound to the chest. His son lunged towards the men in blind rage only to receive a rifle butt for his troubles as they marched towards the grand Vozhd. Klyachkivsky was sitting on a chair nearby, with a gun to his temple and his right hand shaking. Stetsko wasn't there; he must've fled with the others, but the soldiers didn't care.

According to the document, all units must cease their operations until disarmament, and Shumsky, along with the most important figures in the Soviet resistance, was allowed to leave Ukraine and move to another neutral country.\n\nHe didn't try to comfort himself with the thought that it wasn't his fault; he had no interest in fooling himself. He felt responsible for the failure of the communist ideal and for letting down all the people who had worked so hard for the re-establishment of Soviet Ukraine. The workers and peasants of Ukraine would never truly be free. The fight was lost this time. The dreams of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Bukharin would never be realized. His dream would never be realized.\n\nStill, Shumskyi thought, it wasn't all that bad - after all, it wasn't the Wehrmacht that extinguished the communist fire, but the somewhat reasonable Horlis and his UNRA. Deep in his soul, he knew that Horlis wasn't a bad man; he just had other ideas, and the fact that the leader of the democratic resistance agreed to a treaty rather than outright destroying the Soviet partisans was already worthy of respect. It was an honest fight - and a loss in such a fight is a dignified loss.\n\nDuring his inner monologue, Shumskyi and the soldiers passed a flagpole near the theater, and he saw the flag of the Ukrainian SSR being taken down.

Each method was soundtracked to a medley of once-forgotten Ukrainian music, a celebration for reclaiming what was theirs.\n\nShukhevych today was one of the countless revelers, taking his rifle to a righteous slaughter with his comrades as part of a firing squad. Each one of the German dogs faced him, he carefully picked his target. A Melnykite lackey whose luxury came from the oppression of his very own people. He readied his rifle at the dog's head before a call to fire was given, painting the wall behind him with grey matter.\n\nHe and the rest of his vermin collapsed onto the earth, soon to be taken away and burnt. Shukhevych took a break from the revels, one that was interrupted when an adjutant brought him a special prize, Deputy Reichskommissar Georg Leibbrandt. The crestfallen academic kneeled before him, bloody and broken. He dismissed his aide before he got lost in thought.\n\nOnce, he was in the same position as the man he had just killed. In another life, he could have stayed with the 201st Schutzmannschaft Battalion, maybe he would have been one of the Ukrainians who stood up against the wall. Do the others still know of that past? His thoughts were interrupted by the babbling of a bureaucrat.\n\n"You know, we have a lot in common. Granted, I would have gone about independence differently but there are many in Germany like me. If you people keep me alive, I could help negotiate-" Leibbrandt's useless words were silenced with a bullet through his temple, alongside the patriot's concerns regarding his collaboration."

Dmytro Klyachkivsky, his visage etched with a tumultuous blend of triumph and rage, strode across the desolate landscape. Wearied by the relentless battle, his soldiers diligently carried out their grim task of cleaning and cataloging the fallen comrades. The air, heavy with the lingering scent of smoke and gunpowder, bore witness to the countless lives that had been consumed by the relentless violence.\n\n"Sir, we found the traitor's body!" a soldier's voice rang out, shaking the ground beneath their feet. Klyachkivsky's gaze sharpened, his steps quickening towards the fallen leader. Slumped and lifeless, Shumskyi lay-a casualty of a sniper's bullet. Flames of fury surged within Klyachkivsky, a tempestuous storm raging beneath his stoic exterior as he stared upon Shumskyi's body, a testament to their bitter rivalry. "Rostow's town square," he commanded, his voice dripping with chilling resolve. "An example must be made."\n\nThe soldiers exchanged silent glances, fully aware of the formidable force of their commander's anger. With unwavering loyalty, they swiftly moved to fulfill his orders. Coiling a rope around Shumskyi's neck and securing it to a nearby jeep, they prepared to drag his lifeless body through the desecrated streets."

 UKR_UCW_capitulation.10.desc: "It was about four in the morning when Johann heard a twig snap, off in the woods but no more than a few meters away. He hadn't slept in days, and he was regretting it now as he laid on his back soaked with the freezing dew. He was chilled to the bones with no fire. He couldn't risk the light and smoke. Perhaps there were a few moments where he slipped just below the surface of sleep, experiencing brief dreams of the last few days. The fall of his garrison. The retreat order, surely part of a mass surrender. The prison he'd been guarding in flames. His failure to lead his men, instead fleeing when the first statue of Hitler fell to a vengeful bombardment. His mad fly into the forests toward a far away border that he wasn't even sure existed anymore.\n\nAnd now the logical conclusion. Hushed whispers in the brush, behind the cover of the ancient forest. It was as if he was surrounded by angry ghosts. His mind scrambled for any kind of option, as he was no exorcist. He ached too much to move, his ammunition was spent, his throat begged for water and he had no plan for the last week apart from 'run'.\n\n"Who is there?" He croaked in what little of the local language he knew.\n\n"We got a live one!" Shouted a voice, although he could not understand its tongue, "An officer, I think!"\n\n"The one from that fort? I see him!" Returned another. Johann didn't get a chance to respond before there was a deafening crack and the forest floor turned red. Five seconds of pain, then oblivion. The partisans emerged from the wood, two men and a woman. The woman knelt down and claimed his Luger with a smile, "Shame we couldn't capture him."\n\n"I've got a better idea... anybody have rope? Town's not far, we can make an example of him.""

His uniform, once a rugged yet proud garb marking him as a nationalist partisan, was a costume of rags marking him as a traitor. In the dark, he navigated solely by the stick in his hand to avoid stepping through barbed wire or straying from the path. His heart pounded, terrified of what lay ahead. Yet longing drove him forward. His fellow partisans had been run off into the woods by the communists and were content to fight their entire lives. Ivan was not. The Germans were gone and the war over. He just prayed that the reds would accept his surrender, knowing weeks ago he wouldn't have accepted their's.\n\nSergiy knocked on her door before wincing and drawing his hand back. The cuts and bruises on his knuckles and arms remained from the weeks of fighting practically hand to hand in the urban war that had ended the populist struggle. A few had healed, but others were fresh from resisting his captors. Imagine his surprise when they held him for just a week and sent him home. After staring at his hand for a solid minute it occurred to him that nobody had answered. He wondered if she had even lived. Or if she knew he had lived? Or if she had found someone new? Or if...\n\nThe door swung open and Sergiy immediately found himself in her embrace. Somewhere far away, Ihor's cell door swung open.\n\nThey'd found his file. It was only a matter of time. He'd been living in fear ever since they threw him in a dismal prison bloc with the rest of the collaborators, even despite his service to the resistance. The only thing that hurt more than the beatings was the knowledge he deserved many of them. Every day someone was escorted out to be judged and then killed, humiliated, released or sent back. "It's time," Said a voice. He prayed as he was bodily dragged out, and smelled the smoke of burning fabric somewhere outside. Yellow and blue corners curled, then turned to ash."

He reminisced about the smell of the brisk, chilly air, and to be greeted by a warm cup of tea from mama back home.\n\nToday, however, was not the same. The Vozhd had come and gone, but the fires had not. Andriy recalled the scent of freshly baked bread, fried lard and tea in the city centre, but those once fresh smells had subsided, with the smell of burnt wood and rotting flesh left in its wake. Green-clad men with star-emblazoned caps marched the grey-uniformed, self-described "rebels" down unpaved roads where an unsettling, indescribable stench wafted from the end. Occasionally, other men in green would throw things at them. Horse excrement? Bags of urine? Vomit? Only God knew. Where were those men going? What was causing that foul scent? Andriy didn't want to know—he had tried to relate the scent to something else, but it was truly unlike anything he had known. The smell and the screams kept him far away.\n\nAndriy once more recalled the crackling of his home's cosy, warm fireplace, though the crackles and pops in the streets weren't only of burning wood. The books and pamphlets the "rebels" in grey left at each door withered and shrivelled in the flames, along with those once-omnipresent posters of that bald man—Pantera, was it? Andriy had already forgotten. And that statue installed in the town square of Klyachiki or whatever his name was, now beheaded, and a red flag - though without that black stripe, hung from its shoulders."

 UKR_UCW_characters.1.desc: "Bohdan Antonenko huddled around a small fire, deep within the woods. The remains of small game he'd caught nearby, his meal for the night. His concern was not on food, but instead what to do next. For now he hid, as Ukraine collapsed into violence; stories and rumors of what was happening swirled in his mind.\n\nHe heard of Ukrainians who'd risen up, and had taken over half of the country; he'd heard of partisans who'd supposedly assassinated swaths of the Reichskommissariat apparatus; he'd even heard that more soldiers of the former Ukrainian Socialist Republic had emerged.\n\nHe suspected most were exaggerated or untrue. The Germans would never let Ukraine fall so easily, not even if the wildest rumors were true. Yet there was no doubt that the hold the Germans had held was broken.\n\nBohdan watched the fading fire, struggling with what to do. His conscience told him to try and find his comrades among the communists. After what he'd done, they'd welcome him back as a hero. If he returned, he wouldn't be an aimless partisan, but have something to higher to believe in.\n\nIt seemed obvious at first, yet he hesitated as the fire dimmed, and another cold Ukrainian night began.\n\nThings were no longer the same since he had almost killed Koch. He wasn't special, or a hero, and didn't even know how he'd find them again since being cut off. He also knew that he didn't fight now for state or socialism. His mission, once so clear, was now anything but. Socialist, partisan, freedom fighter, none of those seemed right anymore.\n\nHe knew he could not stay idle, but the fire that had burned in him had dimmed; no cause fulfilled him as it once had. For now, he decided, he could only keep going."

 UKR_UCW_characters.2.desc: "Fiery fury and passion surged through Pieter van Norden as he drove through the Ukrainian countryside towards the city of Kiew. He gripped the steering wheel tightly, his knuckles white as he seethed with indignant rage.\n\nHis focus wasn't on the barbarians who were infesting the countryside and sabotaging, stealing, and killing the incompetent Germans. No, it was on the German officer who had come to his farm, and had the audacity to order him to evacuate. It was "too dangerous" they said; it was "for his safety."\n\nHe could have stayed. Pieter knew that he could have remained and defended his land from the bandits, partisans, and degenerates that were apparently too much for the Germans to handle. Unfortunately, the German officer had resorted to ordering him to leave, and while furious, he knew better than to refuse a direct order.\n\nHe glanced towards the back seat, where his wife and son were seated, and had fallen asleep. A sigh escaped him as he returned his focus to the road. Antonia had insisted that they listen and leave when the family learned how dangerous the partisans had become. She'd been afraid for Markus, forgetting that it was his job to protect the family. To just leave everything was...\n\nIt didn't really matter anymore, now that they were on the road.\n\nHe was afraid that he would return to a ruined home, stripped and looted with no one to protect it. God knew the Germans certainly wouldn't. For now, all that the Van Nordens owned was in the back of this truck. For now, it would have to be enough."

 UKR_UCW_characters.3.desc: "With a rhythm, the sound of boots stomping boomed from somewhere outside the home. At first, the Nosenkos were certain it was the Germans on parade - an attempted show of strength in the face of collapse. But then, through their window, they caught glimpses of blue and yellow, fluttering.\n\nHalyna flew from her bed to the window. There they were - a battalion of UNRA men, marching to town. Above them waved the flag of Ukraine.\n\nShe hadn't seen that flag since she was a child.\n\nHalyna turned from the window and rushed down the stairs, her legs swinging at a feverish pace that matched her youthful stride. As she swung her door open, Halyna could at last see the men properly. A band of liberators marched along the dirt road, waving to the farmers. She wanted so badly to wave back, and yet she could not bring herself to do so. The moment was simply too grand, too powerful. No motion could mean enough.\n\nDanylo remained in his bedroom, waiting for the men to leave. If they all died tomorrow in a hail of German bullets, what use would this memory have? He would see those faces in his nightmares, mixed in with all the other fallen he had known and lost. Better to turn over, Danylo thought to himself. Better to sleep."

 UKR_UCW_characters.4.desc: "The faint hope that Bohdan held upon seeing the farmstead in the distance had faded the closer he got. There were signs with each closer step of what he would find. When he saw the churned mud of tire tracks, dozens of bootprints, the burned fields, and complete lack of life, he probably should have left and saved himself the time.\n\nBut the choice wasn't his to make, not when his stomach reminded him that he needed food, and if there was a chance there was some left, he had to take it.\n\nHe searched the sheds and silo first, small as they were. There was almost nothing in them, and what remained was useless. Mostly broken farming tools, torn bags, and rotten straw were all that was left. There was a small chicken coop that was also empty, with not a single egg or hen to be found.\n\nThe home had been forced into, and the doorknob knocked clean off the door itself as Bohdan approached. He didn't dwell too long on what had happened to them; the happiest ending was that they hadn't been home at all. He found the home as ransacked as the sheds had been. Plates smashed on the floors, silverware scattered, chairs overturned, and cabinets ripped open.\n\nIt was as though a pack of rabid animals had stormed through.\n\nBohdan searched the home as thoroughly as he could in the fading daylight, ignoring the broken picture frames and remaining mementos of whoever had lived here. To his delight he found a half-loaf of bread that had fallen behind a chair; apparently lost in the frenzy. It was stale, dirty - and better than nothing.\n\nWith it in hand, and the sun falling, he turned and quickly left. There was nothing more for him here."

 UKR_UCW_characters.5.desc: "The Van Nordens were hardly the only family who had fled to Kiew, and Pieter had spent a long day dealing with a very overworked German official to give them an official place of residence. By the end of it, the official had practically shoved the residence papers into his hands, without so much as giving directions.\n\nThe disrespect chafed at him, but at this point, he just wanted to settle down - the papers had calmed him. All they would need to do is wait until the Germans got their act together, and crushed these partisans.\n\nThey eventually reached their apartment. Pieter wrinkled his nose at the smell of the city, and noted that the apartment was not exactly 'new.' He failed to see the dismay in the eyes of his wife and son and they entered the dreary apartment of only a couple rooms, all of them in poor condition.\n\nHis wife opened the window to bring in some air as they began to unpack. As Pieter took out his belongings, he noticed something missing that alarmed him. "My medals!" he quickly turned to Antonia frantically. "You saw my medals? I know I grabbed them!"\n\nThe entire family quickly began searching for them. Pieter searched through all they had frantically, refusing to accept they weren't there. No, no, no, he couldn't have forgotten them. Alarm turned to fear, and fear to horror as he realized that if the Ukrainian barbarians looted his home, they would find them - or worse, wear them. The image of some filthy, toothless Ukrainian wearing his medals in a mockery to his service made him feel ill.\n\nHe breathed heavily, as his wife placed a hand on his shoulder, speaking comforting things to him to try and calm him down, while his son stayed in the corner, not wanting to come closer. He barely heard the comforts of his wife, thinking only of what had been lost."

 UKR_UCW_characters.6.desc: "Normally, excursions into town were a standard chore for Halyna, necessary from time to time to acquire those things the farm could not provide. This time was different.\n\nShe hadn't seen the UNRA attack personally, but she had heard the outcome whispered by her fellow farmhands, and discussed by her husband and his friends over cards. The town had been liberated - German garrisons far from their home could put up little fight.\n\nToday, one could see the scars of that battle clear as day - burnt homes, covered bodies, and the ruins of the local fountain left broken in half by tank fire. Yet just next to that rubble was a burning pile of objects, surrounded by soldiers and local Ukrainians. As Halyna rushed to see what it was, she recognized a wooden swastika, installed by the Nazis in the center of town. Already blackened, one arm crumbled and fell.\n\nHow warm this fire feels, Halyna thought to herself. How lucky I am to be alive today."

 UKR_UCW_characters.7.t: "A Taste of Hope" #Bohdan Event 3
 UKR_UCW_characters.7.desc: "The city was small, but from the moment Bohdan had wandered into it, he'd instantly felt a difference. For one, there were no Germans here, and he struggled to recall a time when that had not been the case. Without their presence, everything seemed different. It was lively and hopeful; emotions that had been alien to him for so long.\n\nHe'd been so used to being in the background; an invisible person on the fringes of society; keeping himself small to avoid the Germans from paying attention - not that they looked for people who looked like him; for Ukraininans were subhuman in their eyes. Here... it hadn't been the same. One of the residents, a middle-aged Ukrainian woman, had spotted him in dirty clothes and missing a few meals, and quickly brought him into the small camp for refugees.\n\nHe wasn't the only one to wander in. There were other stragglers who'd found their way, and while there wasn't a lot, all of them got some fresh clothes, food, water, and small comforts he'd previously had to scrounge for. The soldiers watched them closely, but there was surprisingly little suspicion.\n\nIt was too much for him to deal with after a certain point. Bohdan knew that all of this was temporary. The Germans were going to return, and he couldn't let himself believe things would change. To do so was dangerous, even if he wished he could embrace this community who had taken him in without question.\n\nHe didn't deserve it; it should be for someone who truly needed it. He could survive on his own; he could endure when the jackboot came crashing back down. Other people deserved the hope. Those who could truly believe it.\n\nIn the middle of the night he snuck out of the city, and back into the woods. He did not look back, for if he did, he might have changed his mind."

 UKR_UCW_characters.8.desc: "Antonia felt the comforting heat of the warm sun fall upon her face and heard the sounds of birds in the air. More sounds reached her ears, ones of a city that she instinctively knew was Amsterdam. She slowly became aware that she was floating down one of the canals, but why, she did not know.\n\nAnd she could not move.\n\nAt first she was not alarmed, sedated and comforted by both the sun and water, the latter of which felt like a protective cocoon as she floated. Above her, she saw the homes and buildings of her childhood home; she saw people walking down the streets, over bridges, smiling; laughing, but seemingly unable to see her floating by.\n\nShe tried to call out to them, but her mouth refused to obey.\n\nThe water began turning colder, and the bright sun became obscured by clouds. The comforting warmth faded, and rain took its place. The familiar sounds of the city became fainter, and were replaced by the sounds of the Ukrainian wilderness, interspersed with distant gunshots. She saw a glimpse of Amsterdam behind her, becoming smaller and smaller as she was swept out into the North Sea.\n\nShe screamed for someone to help, to save her from where she was being dragged - and to her surprise, she was finally able to.\n\nAntonia shot up in her bed, panting heavily as the vestiges of the dream faded, and she awoke in the small, cramped, and cold room which was now their home. An apartment with paint chipped off the walls, uneven floors, and a wet stench that didn't seem to go away. Their new home. She laid back down, her eyes wet as she struggled to return to sleep."

 UKR_UCW_characters.9.desc: "The first weeks had been filled with hope for Halyna and Danylo. Then reality began to sink in. No war, no matter how just or righteous, comes without a cost. For the Nosenkos, they paid that cost in foodstuffs and supplies. The Nosenkos had relied on a broken and exploitative economy, but in the harsh center of war, there was no economy. They simply had to fend for themselves.\n\nAnd so, in the quiet dark at the end of the growing season, the two sat around the table and marked off rations, quietly considering what they had left. For hours, they methodically marked off what they'd gathered this season, and for how long it would need to last them.\n\nThen, an odd comment came from Danylo, as a slip of the tongue. "I hope this is all worth it."\n\nHalyna looked up from her work, indignant. "You must know it is."\n\nDanylo shook his head. "I do not. I have hope, but I know nothing."\n\nHalyna put her notes down and turned to Danylo, her eyes burning with an intensity that cut through the darkness. "If we die tomorrow, it still will have been worth it."\n\nThe room was silent for a moment.\n\n"I don't want you to die.""

A sharp wind cut through even coats, and muck and mud clung to boots and clothes. Bohdan observed the soldier from within these woods, watching as he stumbled along the torn-up road.\n\nHe didn't know where the soldier had come from, but it was unmistakably a German. Their uniforms were easy to identify, even though it was torn, and grime that covered it. The man was in poor shape; his movements were sluggish, his feet dragged, and his back slouched. He held one arm gingerly, with no weapon to be seen.\n\nThe soldier was young, thin, small, and with sandy hair. Maybe a boy from the invading settlements; maybe a conscript from Germany itself. It didn't matter. Bohdan watched silently, his own rifle in hand. He heard the voice of his commander, as clear as the day before his first battle.\n\n"When the enemy is in your sights, you will not hesitate. You will kill them, unless you want them to do the same to us."\n\nThere was only one fate for Germans. He mechanically aimed, inhaled, and fired.\n\nThe soldier fell to the ground with a scream, writhing in agony from the shot to the back. Another shot rang out, and the soldier went still. Bohdan only lowered the rifle once he was sure the man was dead. He remembered how he had felt when he'd killed his first German. Elation, pride, satisfaction.\n\nHe felt none of that now, only a cold dispassion. One more German was dead, but there were thousands remaining. A drop in the bucket, but every drop counted. He stripped the body of what little it had, and once more vanished into the woods."

Even at seven years old, he still hesitated about asking her for something. She smiled at him, letting him know it was ok. "Come here, Markus, what is it?"\n\nHe came closer and sat down beside her, biting his lip before asking: "When will we be able to go home?"\n\nHer chest tightened at the question, one that she didn't honestly know the answer to. Nor where home even was for them anymore. Where they had lived in Ukraine, Or where she had been happy in the Netherlands. Her smile faltered only slightly, as she kept her voice light.\n\n"When all is well, which will be soon," she promised. "And when it is, I'm going to take you to a beautiful place. Do you know Holland?"\n\nHe nodded. "Where you grew up?"\n\nShe smiled fondly. "Yes. A beautiful place, with green landscapes, clear streams, clean cities. I can't wait for you to see it yourself," she leaned in a bit closer, as if sharing a secret. "Your father won't admit it, but between us, I think he'd want to visit it too."\n\nHe smiled at that, as if he too wanted to go to a land without trouble, but there was something in the smile that Antonia knew was forced. She painfully knew it was not the first time she had made such promises, and in this awful place they were now, perhaps reality was already coloring her young son's outlook."

It was Halyna's idea - take a chair out to the fields, find a change of scenery from their increasingly decrepit above. It sounded ludicrous to him - nothing seemed more mundane than the freshly harvested field, an empty expanse that spread in every direction.\n\nYet it was capturing something for him. Here he could see nothing, and yet everything - his home, his fields, and even in the far distance his town. Thinking further, it struck Danylo as a great metaphor - was this not what Ukraine had become? A great field, harvested into oblivion?\n\nHe stopped himself. This field was not destroyed - certainly, years of German demands left it overharvested, hobbled by its status as a monoculture and the constant need for ramping production. Yet this land was arable still. Next year, should Danylo and Halyna last another year, they would grow another harvest, and see a field of grain once more.\n\nPerhaps a more optimistic metaphor for Ukraine, yes, but fatalistic at its core. This field was built for harvesting. Danylo had to pray that Ukraine was not the same.\n\n"As I have done, as I will do, as always seems to come.""

Bohdan could never tell, even as a child when he watched them surface after a good rain shower and he stared at them endlessly, deprived of anything to really do besides that.\n\nThe dark made it difficult to see much outside of the ditch he had hidden in, only the ghostly outlines of the trees. The sun was gone, and he could not risk lighting a fire so close to the German camp. He felt as if he was floating in space, with only two companions - an earthworm and a dead sentry. He felt a deep loneliness, for not even his cause could comfort him now, dead and buried like all the cliques he'd bounced between since the defeat. The German was younger than him, which gave him the odd feeling of years passing in minutes. It used to be that the Germans were his age or older. He'd spent so much time fighting that time didn't pass, but here he was: a man sitting next to the corpse of a boy.\n\nBohdan winced, feeling as if he'd been stabbed in the stomach. His hunger pangs were worsening, and he couldn't tell if the pain from his bad leg hurt less or more. Last time he tried hunting he'd been spotted, tumbled down a hill and injured his leg. Luckily the German he was wrestling broke his skull. Sentries and camps were everywhere, stealth was no longer an option apart from taking bites out of camps. If he wanted to eat he'd have to ambush the scout camp or eat the earthworms.\n\nHe reckoned he could do it, but his leg might give out completely. So once again he asked: did the leg or the hunger hurt worse? Each one was just delaying the inevitable, for tomorrow his caved in belly would still be empty regardless of if he ate the camp's paltry food or the worms. His leg would still be useless regardless of whether he stayed put or not. He'd still be dead by the end of the year regardless of whether he fought or not - but three more Germans would be dead if he did."

The town she could once call her own was no more.\n\nThe Ukrainian flag that once stood so proudly, flying ever since the UNRA came to her town, had been torn off from its perch. Halyna watched it lie bleeding with gasoline alongside other banners of hope and Ukrainian writings. The German soldiers poured the last of their Jerry Cans onto it and lit the match as the crowd surrounding it cheered with jubilation for their German saviors. The crowd was thinner than usual. So many lost.\n\nA German propaganda van crackled in a language that Halyna was unfortunately familiar with - but could barely make out what it was saying. "Ukrainians citizens, today... Judeo-Bolshevism... eradicated from your land... the Reichskommissariat has restored order..."\n\nThe people around her were not full of anger or rage - they just kept clapping on blindly. She wanted to scream in the face of every last supposed Ukrainian around her, "Stand up and fight - we can't let the Germans win!"\n\nBut they had already won - it was far too late. All she could do was go to her hovel before despair claimed her whole."

She told her son that they were home, finally home, stared into his eyes with a gaze that felt both weak and demanding. She held his hands tightly.\n\nAs the Van Nordens entered, they were shocked to see the house so full. Rugs and furniture remained in their places. The fireplace had logs still inside it. A mass of objects stood before them, things they had never seen.\n\n"It's just like the officer said," muttered Pieter. "Bandit occupation." he stared at the furniture with a grimace, as if verifying it. He grabbed a small carved eagle off the floor before a look of horror fired across his face - the carving had caught him. He dropped it. "It all needs to go."\n\nMarkus stared at the little carving, and grabbed it. This was something he could own, would like to own. It was not sleek or slender - the individual slices could clearly be seen. Yet it had been carved with its wings so wide and outstretched that you could truly imagine it flying. As Markus turned the eagle onto its back, he saw a name had been written in a script he could not understand.\n\nAntonia plucked the carving from Markus and placed a hand on his shoulder.

Despite his age his face was haggard, with a patchy beard and shaggy dark hair. He was rail thin, his communist uniform hanging off of his bones like the clothes of a scarecrow. He was giving a crack on the wall a heavy lidded stare.\n\n"That's what he said. I always pictured him a bit... scarier," Replied Chief Zelenko, "The news treated him like a boogeyman. Psychotic, conniving bastard cloaked in mystery."\n\n"I thought he'd be younger. Some kid who didn't know what he was getting into," Added Officer Dudnyk.\n\n"When I ran with the UNRA they lionized him. We all wanted to be the man who almost killed Koch," Returned Usenko, "Thought he'd be taller."\n\nBohdan didn't say anything, even as the cops spoke about him. He instead sat down on one of the cots, listening to the conversation and looking at the policemen. He didn't look afraid, or sad, or angry. He looked tired. After a bit more chattering amongst themselves, one of them finally acknowledged the prisoner, "Why even turn yourself in? You could've hid easily, or kept fighting us."\n\nBohdan looked him in the eye for the first time, his voice hoarse, "I've been hiding for years. Killing Germans was the only thing that made the hiding worth it. Now who am I fighting? Ukrainians. I can't do that."\n\n"You know they might kill you," Said Usenko.\n\n"And?" Asked Bohdan.

What a low opinion on our great nation!"\n\nThe banter continued as Halyna began serving dinner. Since the start of the electoral season, the Nosenko household had been abuzz with these debates, each hawking their own favorite party. Each also helped campaign for their side as best they could - Danylo with reading sessions and Halyna with a door-to-door campaign.\n\nAs Halyna placed banush on the dinner table, Danylo looked up at her with a delightful smile. How much brighter he looked now, she thought to herself, active and open after so many years of closing himself tighter and tighter. Even his face, once so tight and perpetually concerned, seemed loose and expressive. He was older than ever, but she'd never seen him so alive. What great days for the both of them."

Since the war ended, Pieter van Norden hadn't known how to explain the failure to his family, and Antonia was too busy worrying about what the Republic might do to them. The family was in limbo; their home in the countryside was long gone, and their temporary residences might be taken by the state at any moment.\n\nYet once Pieter dismissed his family, he rushed down to the apartment's lobby and waited. For a solid half-hour, he sat and fiddled, praying both that the man would arrive and that he would be spared the humiliation of his presence.\n\nHis first hope was granted, the other quashed. The man arrived shortly after, wearing a refitted Ukrainian auxiliary uniform and a grin. He spoke German, but only a stilted German. His lapel had blue and yellow hastily sown in. This was a Ukrainian man, and some bitter part of Pieter's soul mocked his every fleeting kindness towards the man. This is the creature that ruined your country.\n\nStill, Pieter needed stability, needed safety, no matter how far he had to wade. Small talk was made - money exchanged for protection. The Ukrainian called the bribe a "donation to the Spivators." Pieter had no choice but to smile and agree.\n\nAfter the man tipped his visor and disappeared, Pieter stumbled back to his apartment in shame. Praying to a force he could not define, he thought with pride of the destruction a German invasion might bring."

Yet this intruder was respectful, moving through the foliage without harming a twig. But perhaps this was done not out of respect but fear.\n\nExiting from the dense gaps between trees, Bohdan found himself stranded in a glade. It would only be a brief interlude from the covers of greenery that surrounded, if one that would leave him feeling exposed, easily captured by the bare eye. As he attempted to move swiftly, his fear took hold of him when he heard the quick rustle of leaves approaching behind him.\n\n"Don't move!" A deep yell from within the forest paralyzed Bohdan. His brain screamed to him with every fiber of his being to run for the hills, but his legs only moved to kneel on the grass - hands above his head. "If you attempt any sudden movements, we will open fire."\n\nOne of them walked into Bohdan's line of vision, attired with a plain red band on his arm. "Wait." Bohdan rapidly fished through his pockets despite his fear - grabbing onto a medal as the partisans' weapons trained on him. He returned his hands to the air as his red star slipped into the blades of grass. A partisan picked up the keepsake to inspect it.\n\n"Bohdan Antonenko?" Bohdan nodded, hoping they would not call him a thief or a liar. "You are a hero." That was a word he did not expect for him to be described as. "How the hell did you manage to survive so long? Come back with us on the truck. We will bring you back to civilization." Bohdan followed the men back. To where he did not know, but it was certainly better than here."

A battalion of some ten or twenty olive-coloured soldiers climbed out of the compartment and made their way to the home of the Nosenkos. Poking his head out the porch, Danylo peered his eyes towards the source of the rhythmical stomping of boots, and caught sight of the red banner on the truck.\n\nThe flag was not the same one he had known twenty years ago, but it was abundantly clear that it was the same people flying it this time.\n\n"National liberation"? "A new life under communism"? He had been conscious enough the last twenty years to know that not only were their promises untenable under the threat of an inevitably resurgent German hegemon, but that nothing but misery had came from that same red flag the last time it flew over the golden fields of Ukraine. Rather than to waste his own time with their drivel, he took his leave and went back inside.\n\nHalyna, rising from her wooden chair, stood and watched the band of soldiers approach them. Mesmerised by their dream for a free, liberated Ukraine, she waited as they came to her, bearing pamphlets and gifts. Was it the youthful optimism in the young woman leading her team of liberators that convinced her otherwise? The determination in the young leader's gaze was too moving, too powerful was the devotion of these young fighters to their cause, that it shook a feeling she had not felt inside of her in a very long time."

Markus, confused, though beyond the cognitive maturity needed to comprehend the abnormality of the ongoing events in such extraordinary circumstances, and though vividly aware that Ukraine and thus his home were on fire, never he would find his family at the mercy of these rebels. Here in the internment camp, they were so far from home, so far from safety. The hastily erased swastikas on the walls of the living quarters and stains where German signage was once nailed clearly identified the site as a former slave camp, though the leaking pipes on the ceiling had active maintenance crews repairing them.\n\nFrom the chatter and murmur from the other captives, it could be made out from the distinctive Germanic tongues that the camp housed Dutch and German farmers, just like the Van Nordens themselves. Before his mother could sugarcoat her response with enough white lies to keep Markus docile, the commissar in the camp gathered the attention of the inmates, announcing in heavily accented German:\n\n"You are gathered here until further notice, while the lands you once settled have been liberated and are now to be reorganized for denazification. Until we deem it is appropriate to release you, you shall remain to be re-educated."\n\nPieter's face was pale as a ghost. From his mouth came the fatherly instincts, pacifying promises that the Vaderland was behind them. That it was only a matter of time before the Wehrmacht returned, and restored order. That they would be rescued from the clutches of the thugs. Yet, he could not bring himself to believe it entirely, and soon went silent, leaving Antonia consoling Markus quietly in Dutch.\n\nPieter could only shuffle around the perimeter of the gates, watching as the olive men scorned and scowled at him as he passed by.

It was more of a discarded car side mirror he'd recovered and braced against a tree. The old scrap of metal made a poor razor, but it had to do. Once the shaving was done, he splashed a few drops of water from his canteen onto his shaggy hair and ran his fingers through it.\n\nHe cast a sideward glance at his UA-SSR patch and uniform jacket on the ground, shoving some dirt over them with his boot. Oddly, he fit in more with the coat he'd worn as a fugitive than the one he'd worn as a soldier. Turning back to the mirror, he almost looked like a different man. He recalled with a shiver what had happened a few nights ago. He'd found a fellow partisan, a man about his age named Andriy, and they'd walked for a few nights together, pooling resources and swapping stories. When their stocks began to run short, Andriy took a foolish risk and approached a patrol, ready with a faulty story of being a lost hiker. They didn't even give him a moment to speak. They were too gleeful at the act of killing a communist to notice Bohdan running into the woods.\n\nThere was no fighting left to do. No matter where he went he was a wanted man, and there was no longer an occupier to drive off. Just his own countrymen, possessed by some twisted vengeful spirit. His gaze wandered across the soon to be harvested autumn fields to a farmhouse, the first of many that dotted the fields surrounding the broken skyline of a city rebuilding itself. One of them had to need a farm hand, he thought to himself as he approached, leaving behind the shallow grave of Bohdan the partisan.\n\nHe waded through the grain to the front door, walking up the creaking steps and tapping his knuckles against the gnarled wood and chipping paint. The door crept open and he faced an aging farmer. "Hello sir, I'm Artem," Said Bohdan."

At least the following order was not in German as it had been in his nightmares. Cold comfort. He stood up, not just to answer the door but to stop Halyna from doing so first. She remained on the sofa, trying desperately to keep herself from scrambling for a weapon. The knocks continued, each sending shivers Danylo's spine as he braced himself. The door swung open the moment it was unlocked, and a man in a OUN-B sergeant's uniform entered. He offered a chilling smile to the couple as his squad filed inside, armed, wordless and grim.\n\n"Danylo Nosenko?" Said the officer. He didn't wait for an answer, continuing, "Nothing to worry about, just a routine search. UNRA activity in the area. Can't be too careful." One of the military policemen opened a drawer with such force that it nearly fell. Danylo placed a hand on Halyna's shoulder to keep her still and sat down beside her. She offered him a pleading look that he could only return with a shake of the head.\n\n"You know, I thought I recognized the name. Did you write poems back in the day?" Asked the sergeant. One of the men knocked a glass off of the table as he turned, taking note of a creaking floorboard. Danylo held Halyna's hand. The sergeant continued talking, "I think I read some. I might even call myself a fan. Beautiful prose, strong meaning," Two of the troopers began prying at the board until it snapped, scattering splinters across the Nosenkos' living room.\n\nThe leader settled in uninvited while the others lamented that they had found nothing so far. "I felt sometimes they were a bit soft, though, treating Ukraine as a dove. Ukraine is more a lion, I say." A soldier slipped a necklace into his bag with a gentle clink.

The land debates had begun cordially enough, but the Poles awaited his delegation's proposal, and his envoys looked to him to endorse their ideas.\n\nThe Culturalists wanted the complete and immediate return of Galicia. It was a radical approach that was sure to immediately sour the negotiations, especially with the more nationalistic elements of the Polish delegation. However, the people back home shared his dream of a free Ukraine, and they would expect him to fulfill that promise. Was Ukraine's integrity more important than peace?\n\nThe United Strugglers alternatively proposed that they let the Poles make the demands instead. Giving the Poles control over the land negotiations would be the foundation of peace between the two nations, but they could always abuse the generosity offered to them, and the people at home wouldn't like submitting either. What would he be willing to sacrifice for cooperation?\n\nFinally, the Spivavtor unveiled their proposal, a continuation of the status quo. They were the only ones who appeared to care about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, offering to add a land-trade clause to placate their fellow envoys. Their history of collaboration and willingness to work with the Germans, though, could sink negotiations almost immediately. Was compromise even worth the risks it entailed?\n\nHorlis got up from his chair with a light groan. None of his options were particularly attractive, yet he couldn't stay to watch over the delegation personally. The elections back home in Kyiv required his attention, so he had to make a choice.

To his right, Ivan Leshchenko inspected his tie, before loosening it with a slight smirk. The tranquil quiet of the room was interrupted as the chief diplomat, Vasyl Stus, burst through the door and took his empty seat.\n\n"President Horlis has demanded of us that Ukraine's sovereignty be maintained, and thus all of Galicia shall be returned to us effective immediately," Stus declared as he removed files from his briefcase. Turmoil filled the room, as delegates murmured to each other. The light of the room's chandelier momentarily dimmed as a score of cigarettes lit up. Savchuk grimaced as he bit into his own cigar.\n\n"There's no way the Poles will agree to this. All this will accomplish is more bloodshed," Savchuk muttered.\n\n"I have to agree. I'd love for our comrades to embrace us again, but this seems... brash," Leshchenko added.\n\n"Nonsense friends! Think of Poland and Galicia like..." Bondarenko piped before pausing, "a mouse and its cheese! We want as much as we can get, but if we ask for too little, we'll only get a little. The mouse will either leave the cheese entirely for us out of fear, or part with enough to make us happy.

Leshchenko sat next to him with his hands covering his face.\n\n"This can't possibly be reality," Leshchenko breathed, "how did we convince the Poles to agree to this?" He removed his hands from his face, revealing his bright smile and his wide dimples. Savchuk noticed that Leshchenko's eyes glistened with tears, but he couldn't tell whether it was out of relief or jubilation.\n\n"I'm glad you're feeling better, Ivan. Why don't we get you a drink to celebrate?" Savchuk said, before slinging his arm around the younger man before they both rose from their seats.\n\n"Hey Vladimir, do you know you act like my father? He would always find something to celebrate to take my mind off of things. I'm sure you and him would've been friends."\n\n"I'm sure we would've. Two fathers worrying about their troublesome children," Savchuk responded with a slight, sad grin. The two men were greeted by Bondarenko, who had been laughing with his fellow Culturalists at the drink table.\n\n"What did I say, Vladimir? The mouse gave us the cheese because it knew it couldn't beat us. And to think you worried about the Poles being rats with diseased claws ready to slice us apart! You need this drink more than me, my friend," Bondarenko boasted before handing his drink over to Savchuk. He took a sip, letting it wash away his stress, even if it was just for a fleeting moment."

As Stus sputtered out his last words, the room erupted into chaos.\n\nThe Culturalists were incensed, their representatives' faces red as blood as they cursed the Poles. A few of their more zealous members called for an immediate ultimatum, and the faction began to rally around the call of "Galicia or war." This rhetoric immediately provoked a response from the United Struggle and Spivavtors, who declared the Culturalists warmongers who had sabotaged negotiations straight from the beginning. In their own corner of the table, Bondarenko and Leshchenko fought their own battle amongst themselves.\n\n"Vladimir was entirely right about the Poles being rats, Bondarenko! We've declared our intent to take the cheese, and now they hiss like they're the cats hunting us! I want Galicia back too, but this was too much!" Leshchenko raved. The elderly statesman took a deep breath before responding.\n\n"Mice and rats are smart creatures, Ivan, and considering the Polish response, they're more like mewling insects. They've made it clear they don't want to negotiate, so we'll have to stomach the loss and take what we want by force, as regrettable as that is," Bondarenko reasoned.\n\nSavchuk eavesdropped on his friends' conversation and mused to himself.

The Moderate Culturalists, as well as the United Struggle and the Spivavtors, declared their support for the offer, urging their counterparts to accept the perfect compromise. Savchuk and Bondarenko lit their cigarettes as they discussed the development.\n\n"Well, I can't say you were wrong, Volodymr; the Poles really did end up being mice in the end," Savchuk said with a chuckle.\n\n"Life in the army taught me a valuable lesson. People become quite reasonable when a gun is pointed at them," Bondarenko explained, "and if they're still stubborn, you point another gun at their friend. Eventually, you get a thousand guys pointing guns at each other, and everyone is so tired of it that they go drink vodka together. " The two envoys laughed together, telling jokes in between puffs of their cigarettes.\n\nLeshchenko sat alone at the round table, pondering his options. Despite the common cause of the three factions, the upcoming vote on how to respond was still on a razor's edge. Logically, he should vote for the compromise, but his thoughts kept drifting to the Ukrainians still left under the Polish boot. Could he forgive himself for leaving them behind?

 UKR_POL_relation.1300.desc: "The Poles have made their position clear - if we want this land, we are going to have to pay for it. In some hard currency, yes, but primarily in terms of economic investment and cooperation, two things in very short supply in the Poland of today.\n\nThe benefits of such an agreement are many, of course, including not only the land itself but the promise of the closest thing to a proxy against the Reich that is possible. That and, of course, the likelihood of Polish acquiescence to any later demands we may choose to make. After all, it will not be as if anyone else is investing, and they are going to grow dependent very, very quickly.\n\nHowever, German intervention - and victory - in Poland is all but certain in the indeterminate future, and many claim that to 'invest' in such a doomed state is fallacy.\n\nThe choice, however, remains ours."
 UKR_POL_relation.1300.a: "It is worth it. Collect the funds."

 UKR_POL_relation.14.t: "As Quickly As Our Arms Open..."
 UKR_POL_relation.14.desc: "Negotiations with Poland, over the lands desired, have broken down. We have failed to come to an agreement satisfactory to their government, and there does not appear to be a path forward.\n\nAccording to our delegation, there are minimal talks occurring now, even fewer scheduled for the near future, and the Poles have seemingly withdrawn many of their envoys for supposed 'internal military discussions.'\n\nOur envoys will continue with their attempts, of course, but they do not report any confidence in eventual success. Many in the government claim that this should be taken as a lesson for future negotiations, as an example of overreach.\n\nIf, of course, there are future negotiations."
 UKR_POL_relation.14.a: "Very unfortunate."

 UKR_POL_relation.15.desc: "News from the delegation to Poland has arrived: Success! Poland has agreed to the exchange of Galicia for the terms and items so far agreed upon, and has stated that the transfer of administrative control can happen in the immediate future.\n\nThis is a tremendous accomplishment for the state and our government, and at a stroke has secured vast lands, populations, and resources for us to use instead of Reich, who will no doubt be returning to Polish lands very soon.\n\nWe will, of course, need to be wary of their actions and intentions in the future, but for now we may celebrate - Galicia can now be called Ukrainian!"

 UKR_POL_relation.16.desc: "Ivan sat back in his chair, staring at the wall of his office. There were many things to be discussed, and he was going over his first steps. The border was going to be the main topic of discussion for now, and everyone seemed antsy to get their two-cents in on the conversation. Two options laid in front of him, but the indecision was killing him from the inside. On one hand, he could try to push through some changes at the border. Both of them could benefit from this, and splitting it up ethnically would probably prove successful in the long run. The arguments he had heard for it were totally logical, but would it even last once they began talks with Germania?\n\nOf course, there was always the option of leaving the borders unchanged. Many had told him that there was nothing to gain from shifting the borders like that, and in the end both groups would probably migrate back home. This sounded good to him, especially if he could get the Poles on board. It'd definitely be easier than pushing for changes, right? Besides, there were totally more advantageous things to discuss other than the border.\n\nHe glanced up at the clock. How long had he been here? He could feel the weight of inaction weighing on him. Sweat was forming on his forehead, and the more he tried to rationalize either side the more he squirmed in his lavish chair. He needed to choose, and he'd need to make it quick."

Borders.\n\nOur negotiators, at governmental direction, offered the Poles the current border lines as future demarcations, but they have refused, instead insisting that the regular borders be honored both now and in the future. While the issue may seem trivial, to the Poles it is anything but, and opinion in the government is split.\n\nSome of our officials believe it to be a necessary concession to ensure that Poland remains at the table, while others argue that to surrender this point would be far too great a sacrifice. Still, a decision must be made, and our envoys are awaiting the government's decision.\n\nWhat shall they be told?"

 UKR_POL_relation.19.desc: "A group of them, both Poles and Ukrainians, had gone out for drinks. To say it was needed was an understatement, and the first drink between all of them was shared in comfortable silence. There was a look of tired accomplishment on all of their faces, but even after an exhaustive few days of constant deliberation, they all still had the energy to debate around the table on their breaks. Spirited debates on policies that were barely related to either of their countries seemed to ebb and flow, and by the end of the night many of them had become greater friends than their kinsmen.\n\nThe border deliberations may not have gone to plan for either side, but at the same time it seemed to have renewed both of their spirits. There was no animosity, no scheming, no ridiculous demands, just a rather fair border. Not perfect, but there was nothing stopping them from coming back later and hammering it out. For now, they would all share drinks, and enjoy the night ahead of them."

He did not have any real expectation of reaching it, however. He must have underestimated himself, because somehow his weasley grin and silver tongue had bought him the easiest deal of his life. He had gotten pretty good at talking around the Germans, but a deal like this only came to him once in a lifetime.\n\nThe Poles had been especially complacent with their bargain, and he exchanged glances with the other Ukrainians in disbelief. The only "deliberation" was them explaining the details to the Poles. Ivan's whole demeanor had changed, and after the Poles had gracefully accepted the deal he leaned back like he was sitting on a cloud. He beamed with confidence across the room, yet all could see the slight uneasiness behind his eyes. What would the next problem hold? How hard would things be from here? Ivan couldn't know, but he could simply hope."

We've been going over the plans and there are some concerns we had, if you don't mind?"\n\nVolodymyr sighed for a moment, but caught himself in the act. There was nothing saying that the Poles understood this was more than a mere misunderstanding. He just needed to pull this through, right? He tugged at his shirt collar, and he wasted no time trying to crack a joke.\n\n"Skewed? It's just those glasses of yours, I can tell they're real German quality lenses. I assure you, there is nothing wrong with the map. They're drawn along ethnic groups in the region. It is a completely fair and legitimate way of forming the border."\n\nThere was silence for a moment, and the cold stare of his Polish adversary was not helping him in the slightest. A tough crowd couldn't hold him down of course, but Volodymyr was a little worse for wear here. There were only two real options laid in front of him. He could either admit that the map was skewed and try to save face by rectifying it, or he could double down and push this farther. His better judgment screamed for him to just admit it, but why would he let these people walk all over him like this? He had followed along with the plan until now, there was no sense in not sticking to it, right?\n\nThe decision had loomed over him for the few seconds of silence between the two. There was only so much time he could have spent sitting there. He loosened his collar, there was no avoiding it. The decision was his, and only his."

There was no denying the red faces, the beads of sweat, and the terrible quiet that seemed to follow in the wake of such a catastrophic argument. He watched as the poles got up, and all silently filed out of the room.\n\n"Well..." he said, shakily.\n\nHe was at a loss for words, and as his hand glided through the little hair left on his head. There was no denying that the debates were over. He tried to reason with himself, reason that it was the fault of the poles, not them. He wouldn't admit how hard he pushed this proposal, and he certainly wouldn't admit fault for any of this. Nobody around him was paying attention, few had run after the poles, and were now trying to reconcile with them. It reminded him of when he watched a farmer scoop ashes of his burnt crop off the ground, and pile them together feverishly. Except, all was not lost. Some of the Poles seemed to stick behind, talking to the delegates that they had come to agreement with over the course of their stay.\n\nHe thought ahead, to the future of both of their nations. What was there going to be in five years time? A tense border, but there would still be their link. They were forced together, and to survive both would have to cooperate. He hoped, and prayed to himself that things would reel back from where they were. Still, there was no use in praying if Volodymyr wouldn't participate. He stood himself up, and brushed off his jacket."

 UKR_POL_relation.27.desc: "Vladimir's cigarette was crushed into the ashtray, and with a heavy sigh a stack of smoke filled the room. He immediately took out another cigarette, and looked at his fellow delegates. Volodymyr sat silent for a moment, before setting himself straight. It was a strange sight to see, but it was probably expected. There was no helping it, of course. They were there to settle things with Poland as amicably as possible, and Vladimir himself was happy with what they came out with. It wasn't great, sure, but it was definitely fairer than they could've got. Poland got some land they wanted, and Ukraine got to settle things on good terms with them. What was there really to lose? Of course, he'd get an earful later about how they let the Poles walk all over them, but he was prepared for it. He could rest a bit easier now, knowing this issue was solved for now.\n\nHe had gotten up and left for a brief break, and the fresh air was just the refresher he needed. There were still things to be done, and even if this single issue was finished, he still had work to do. There was no time to waste, and back at the table he felt they had already started arguing."

You ceded all the negotiating power to the Poles and that power went to their defective brains, which means these negotiations were pointless to even attempt!" Bondarenko yelled.\n\n"Do you honestly think I wanted this? All I wanted was for there to be peace, since neither of us benefits from shooting each other. Clearly, you don't understand the concept since a decade of war made your brain so addicted to violence that you wanted to do exactly what the Poles are doing now!" Savchuk roared in reply.\n\n"Could you two please stop yelling at each other and listen? What's the point in being angry at each other?" Leshchenko tried to reason, but it was to no avail. All of the diplomats had turned on each other, and had there been any of the Polish delegates in the room, they would've been torn to shreds by the mob of angry Ukrainians.

He felt a hand lightly grasp his arm and looked over to see a Polish delegate offering him a cigar.\n\n"It's probably too strong for your tastes, but it's better than nothing, yeah?" the Pole teased. His gravelly voice was oddly calming to the young envoy.\n\n"I've smoked cigars before, old man. I simply found something I liked more," Leshchenko smirked as he took the cigar.\n\n"Perhaps you're not as soft as you look. I thought my fellow diplomats were lions, but they became submissive house cats in the face of the smallest adversity."\n\n"I think I understand what you mean. Your demands were fair, but my associates didn't see the value in something so minimal."\n\n"And mine lacked the spine to stick to their convictions."\n\nThe two diplomats smoked their cigars in silence. Whereas the negotiations were ultimately a waste of time, Leshchenko thought to himself, at least he found a new friend who shared his disappointment.

His furrowed brown revealed deep wrinkles as he attempted to mask his agitation.\n\n"We gave the Poles the right to make demands, and we found the demands unreasonable, so we tried to negotiate down to the status quo," Stus replied, looking away from the revolutionary's stare that seemed to peer into his soul.\n\n"And after that?"\n\n"The Poles refused."\n\n"Might I inquire about something, Vasyl? If the entire plan hinged on the Poles making the demands so they would be satisfied with the results, why would you negotiate so far to give them nothing?"\n\n"I..."\n\n"Don't answer that question. The answer should be quite obvious," Horlis interjected, "I'm disappointed, Vasyl, though I acknowledge the delegation most likely forced your hand. Go outside. Take the rest of the day to reflect. I promised my daughter I'd help her find a gift for her mother's birthday today, so I'd like my mood to not be soured by any more bad news you have yet to tell me."

Bondarenko, Savchuk, and Leshchenk stood near the bread table discussing the development.\n\n"It looks like the wounds of the past have healed friends, the Poles understand how valuable a partnership with us is," Savchuk exclaimed.\n\n"I'm glad they share our sentiments, Vladimir. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that the Poles would take advantage of us," Leschenko added.\n\n"I wouldn't celebrate just yet," Bondarenko demurred as he grabbed bread from the table. "There are some that have their doubts." The other two diplomats raised their eyebrows, surprised by Bondarenko's objection. "The demands are so minimal that some of my associates believe that there's no point. They say it's a waste of resources, as we'll be left with the same situation with a different border. Effectively, nothing will change except a new hole in our budget." Savchuk and Leshchenko were silent, as Bondarenko took a bite from his bread.\n\n"Except, Volodymyr, we gave the Poles the right to make demands. Asking for the status quo will make us look like fools," Savchuk objected, but there remained lingering doubt within his mind. Would anything truly change, besides the smiles of a few diplomats?"

Nothing had come to a boil yet it seemed, but the tension was definitely felt throughout the room. Little had been agreed on in the few hours they had been here, just that both sides should benefit. He had felt in his gut that this would devolve into a shouting match, but as the room seemed to come close to a climax one man stood up. The man raised his voice, got the attention of the room, and all was silent.\n\nHorlis and Nil both looked surprised, and he couldn't be sure which side he belonged to. It did not matter though, as his trade proposal was the most thought thing to be proposed that morning. It seemed to shift the mood of the room when all of the others began to silently nod and agree with each other. Of course, there were objections here and there, but it wasn't anything that couldn't be ironed out. Things were beginning to look up, and Vladimir saw the two old delegates smile between each other. Another day of this and they'd have a robust economic plan between the two of them."

 UKR.consumption_cycle.a: "Understood."
 UKR.consumption_cycle.a.exploitation_deficit: "\nA §Rdecrease§! in grain output has been recorded across the regions due to the §Rresistance§! levels of each region."
 
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_1_1: "Further mechanization of agriculture, balancing the needs and output of the native Ukrainian farmers, alongside generally fair weather conditions, have been responsible for meeting Germany's grain export quota incredibly successfully. The Reichskommissariat will attempt to further these successes to the next cycle- they likely will need to, as the success now may only increase German expectations of future output."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_1_2: "Despite attempts at further mechanizing agriculture and balancing the needs and output of Ukrainian farmers, the increased productivity was nearly inadequate. The Reichskommissariat will have to redouble their efforts to ensure they meet future quotas, as the Germans will have increased expectations after this close call."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_1_3: "Despite efforts to modernize agriculture and meet the needs of Ukrainian farmers, these efforts proved to be inadequate in the face of Germany's mammoth quota. The Reichskommissariat must take immediate action to address this shortfall, as they can expect increased pressure from Germany in the future. Ukraine lies at the cusp of German intervention, and the necessary further disregard of native Ukranians leaves them agitated and ready to revolt at any moment."
 
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_2_1: "The higher productivity of this cycle and the management of grain distribution has led to local needs being met comfortably, and the natives are now relatively well-fed, productive and healthy. This will likely further grain production and make regional development and exports easier."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_2_2: "The current cycle's productivity and management of grain distribution have only barely met the local needs, leaving the natives barely fed and some borderline malnourished. This will likely hinder grain production and make regional development and export quotas more challenging to meet."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_2_3: "The current cycle's productivity and management of grain distribution have failed to meet the local needs, leaving the natives malnourished and struggling to survive. This will likely hinder grain production and make meeting future regional development and export quotas extremely challenging."
 
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_3_1: "Regional development in the current cycle has been incredibly successful, vastly exceeding the expectations of those back in Germany. With Germany having more faith in the administration's future, more investment will likely flow into Ukraine, bolstering the Reichskommissariat's further prospects. More settlers too will move into the territory - bringing with them wealth as well as more loyal German citizens, drowning out the effect of any unruly Ukrainians."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_3_2: "While regional development has met German expectations in the current cycle, it was through the skin of the administration's teeth. Ukraine still is burdened by the risk of not meeting expectations in the next cycle - which could potentially lead to future inadequate further German investment and the associated decrease in German settlement."
 UKR_consumption_cycle_desc_section_3_3: "Regional development in the current cycle has not met the expectations of those in Germany. Many in the administration fear that heads will roll if this inadequacy continues. Germany's unfavorable view of the colony will likely shrink their necessary investment and jeopardize the stability of Ukraine. The Reichskommissariat will also receive fewer settlers as word of the administration's problems spread..."

In other words, power exists to be wielded, and it can only be held by one.\n\nThose within the Security Council are already aware of this reality. Already, three leading figures - Braütigam, Leibbrandt, and Ohlendorf - are preparing to wield the Führerprinzip and take over completely. Yet without any orders from the Eastern Ministry, the choice of leader will come from within the Security Council and its backers.\n\nTo take power, a candidate for Reichskommissar is going to need the blessing of at least two of the four leading RK institutions whenever the time comes, likely once the immediate security problems are resolved. This will require maintaining more support within these key institutions than opposing candidates. If they have the most support, that institution will be displayed as aligned to them for the moment, though this can always change."

 UKR_GPO_law_0: "§OThird Phase§! of §oGeneralplan Ost§!"
 UKR_GPO_law_desc_0: "§oGeneralplan Ost§! exists to prepare for an eventual §rGerman domination§! of all of §BEastern§! §YEurope§! through §Vethnic cleansing§!. The §OThird Phase§!, beginning in the mid-fifties, has focused less on utilizing mass murder to create this demographic shift, instead using contraception and poor health through limited care to induce a decline in Eastern Europeans. It also has granted increased latitude to local £UKR_bureaucracy_texticon §rReichskommissars§!, who have taken the policy in varying directions - unsurprisingly, Koch has been §Vhardline on the topic.§!"
 UKR_GPO_law_1: "§VFinished§! §OThird Phase§! of §oGeneralplan Ost§!"
 UKR_GPO_law_desc_1: "Generalplan Ost§! exists to prepare for an eventual §rGerman domination§! of all of §BEastern§! §YEurope§! through §Vethnic cleansing§!. The §OThird Phase§!, which began in the mid-fifties, continued the process through settlement and limitations on Ukrainian livelihoods. With its completion, the £UKR_bureaucracy_texticon §rReichskommissariat§! has met its goals for §jGermanization§! over the last five years, capping off fifteen years of fruitful service from the §rReichskommissar§!."

Since that time, the UNC has fallen into §girrelevance§!, with §rReichskommissar Koch§! refusing to allow it any degree of importance.

With an ascendant §BLeibbrandt§!, the UNC is now allowed limited advisory and even §Gdiscretionary action§!, though intense §rReichskommissariat scrutiny and pressure§! makes it continue to serve as a German mouthpiece."

However, following the §qdeath§! of Andriy Melnyk, the organization now is §Vunable to proceed§! with even basic duties, and §sSecurity Council§! gridlock makes replacing the leader §xnear-impossible§!."

 UKR_Bandenbekampfung_law_desc: "Under §xBandenbekämpfung§!, The £UKR_military_texticon §sGerman garrison§! is currently empowered to take extreme action against so-called "Bandits", essentially meaning any §mpartisan§! forces. This included not only free reign to kill any suspects without process but also freedom to §qpillage and destroy§! villages in §Vpartisan controlled territory§! as needed. At present, there are functionally §Vno limits§! to §sGarrison§! action in the field, so long as it is done under these pretenses."
 UKR_National_Symbols_Forbidden_law: "§MNational§! §YSymbols§! §RForbidden§!"
 UKR_National_Symbols_Forbidden_law_desc: "The §rReichskommissariat Ukraine§!, despite the name, is not a §sUkrainian institution§!. As such, statements of §BUkrainian§! §Ynationalism§! are §fforbidden§!, and this suppression extends even into the visual; symbols of Ukraine are §Vforbidden§! in public. Even £UKR_collab_texticon §Qcollaborators§! are limited to the designated symbols for the UNA and UNC.

 UKR_Land_Management_Company_Ukraine_law: "£UKR_industrial_texticon §LLand Management Company Ukraine§!"
 UKR_Land_Management_Company_Ukraine_law_desc: "Though much land has been sold off to important and connected German £UKR_industrial_texticon §Lindustrialists§!, a great wealth of Ukrainian territory is still held by the £UKR_bureaucracy_texticon §rEastern Ministry (Ostministerium)§!. With their proxy in the Land Management Company Ukraine, the Reichskommissariat holds much of the former §xSoviet§! State farms and agricultural machinery, repurposing them to aid the German economy.

 UKR_SC_law_desc_0: "Formed as a temporary measure following the §Vincapacitation§! of Erich Koch, the §sSecurity Council§! serves as a collective body which functionally operates the government. Composed of leading members of the £UKR_bureaucracy_texticon §rbureaucracy§! from all ministries and factions, the Council operates through consensus of its membership, functionally checking the power of the Deputy Reichskommissar - though §BGeorg Leibbrandt§! is himself a member."
 UKR_SC_law_1: "§RDivided§! §sSecurity Council§!"
 UKR_SC_law_desc_1: "Formed as a temporary measure following the §Vincapacitation§! of Erich Koch, the §sSecurity Council§! serves as a collective body which functionally operates the government.

 UKR_SC_law_3: "§VFactionalized§! §sSecurity Council§!"
 UKR_SC_law_desc_3: "Formed as a temporary measure following the §Vincapacitation§! of Erich Koch, the §sSecurity Council§! serves as a collective body which functionally operates the government. As conditions grow worse, existing informal divides have turned into §xoutright factions§!, loosely organized but clearly delineated. As the security council was never designed for such a government, effective policy has been made more difficult, though political mobilization has never been easier."

 UKR_Dnieper_Mech_law: "Dnieper Mechanization"
 UKR_Dnieper_Mech_law_desc: "The region of Southern Ukraine near the Dnieper has seen a renewed modernization drive, bringing its agricultural machinery into the decade. This new investment, made to satisfy the rising grain demands from Germania, should allow for higher yields in the region in coming harvests."
 UKR_Decollectivization_law: "Decollectivization Completed"
 UKR_Decollectivization_law_desc: "Following an edict by Erich Koch, planned decollectivization has been completed, taking the remaining state farms and reorganizing them as locally-ran cooperatives.

 ### 10.3 - A little something extra ###

 UKR_nuke.1.t: "The Celebration"
 UKR_nuke.1.desc: "Yuriy and Natasha lived together in a large apartment complex in Kyiv—a complex that they jokingly called the ugliest building in the entire city. Hastily erected during the old Soviet days, with only half-hearted repairs made by the Germans to stop it from collapsing, the ramshackle building seemed like a dirty smudge against the horizon. Yuriy joked that the grime was the only thing keeping the walls glued together.\n\nBut these were minor problems. Yuriy and Natasha were living in an age of miracles. Ukraine's hardscrabble militias had pushed further than anyone thought possible. After many weeks of waiting for some great calamity and encountering none, the two had agreed to celebrate.\n\n"The stew smells wonderful, Natasha," said Yuriy, as he flattened a lace tablecloth against their pockmarked table. The cloth, along with a set of chipped glass goblets, some of the few possessions they'd succeeded in hiding from the Nazis.\n\nThere was a laugh. Natasha poked her head from their kitchen. Through the window behind her, he could see a beautiful clear sky marked with a single streak of cloud. "Oh, hush. You only say that because you've only had war rations for the past year."\n\n"I'm serious!" He insisted. "Any moment, we're going to hear banging on the door from our neighbors, demanding a bowl!"\n\nShe rolled her eyes, ready to impress him with more of her glittering wit. It was then, however, that something strange happened. The day behind her seemed to be glowing brighter. Long shadows streaked across the room. There was a terrible rumbling, as if the neighbors truly were breaking down the door, and then a shrill, high-pitched screech that drowned out his wife's last word. "Yur—."\n\nThe window exploded. The goblets shattered. The tablecloth erupted in flames. Yuriy heard screaming and then a feeling of weightlessness as the building collapsed around him."
 UKR_nuke.1.a: "They were the lucky ones."

 UKR_nuke.2.t: "The Survivors"
 UKR_nuke.2.desc: ""The flash was so bright. It was brighter than any flash bulb, brighter than the sun. I could feel the air around me growing hot and my body lifting into the air. And then it all went blank. When I woke up, my flesh felt like it was burning from the inside."\n\n"I saw a young boy—maybe six or seven—stumbling through the street. His skin dangled off his body in little strips. He kept repeating the phrase, 'Water. Water. Water.' I wish I'd had something to give him, but I didn't. I kept walking."\n\n"Our apartment complex had been damaged in the explosion and, every few minutes, I could feel it swaying in the wind. When I had gotten down to the ground floor, I saw an old man by the name of Mikhail digging through the rubble. I tried to get him to leave with me, but he kept saying that his wife was buried in the rubble and he wouldn't leave without her. He wouldn't go."\n\n"We ran into the Dnieper. Anything to stop the burning. Anything to get away from the carnage. It was so cold and the water moved so fast that we had to hold onto each other to make sure we wouldn't get swept away. Until I die, I'll never forget how cold the water was, the soft, sticky feeling of our flesh."\n\n"'Mama! Papa!' The little voices were everywhere. They were coming through the floor from the basement classroom, which had collapsed. Another teacher and I tried for what felt like hours to get them out, but we couldn't get through. Eventually the voices stopped."\n\n"Those of us nurses who could stand tried to help as much as we could, but it was too much... There was so much pus. Sticky yellow pus. It oozed out of them and soaked the bandages. We knew we had to conserve what supplies we had but they were in so much pain."\n\n"'Look,' I said after hours of walking. My sister and I looked back for a moment at what had once been Kyiv. All the tall buildings were gone and, on the wind, you could hear the wailing.""
