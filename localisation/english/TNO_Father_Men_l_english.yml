 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_MEN_DESC: "Alexander Vladimirovich Men never asked to be a shepherd to so many, to have his flock's lives entrusted in his care, or to feel the weight of Heaven upon his shoulders - and yet he is all of these things, the Father of the North.\n\nAnd yet this was not always so. A Jewish child baptized as an infant, Men's father was taken from him when he was six years old, dragged to the Gulags by the NKVD on false charges, leaving the young boy with a strong conviction against the fear and tyranny so many throughout the world felt. Despite the dangers of underground worship in the Union, Men remained a devout Christian, albeit a very unorthodox one. A firm believer in equality transcending class, sex, race, and even faith, Men's ideas were almost an unknown within the Church, or even the Union as a whole.\n\nIn the dark times following the death of the Union, Men found himself in the frozen north, comforting the struggling peasantry, offering them God's love - and his own words if they did not accept the Lord's. He told them of his hopes for a land of truly freed men and women, a land of egalitarianism, a place of communes and villages where all would be unchained.\n\nHis beliefs and actions began to gather support among the isolated communities of Siberia. Slowly at first, then all at once, the isolated villages of the north pledged their belief in their Father.\n\nToday the North marches against the chaos that has inflamed the Holy Motherland for so long, and with their Father's watchful gaze, they will bring deliverance and salvation to all who suffer."

 POLITICS_GURZHAP_OCHIROV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "For as long as he can remember, Gurzhap Vanyushkeevich Ochirov has lead a life on the wrong side of the law. In his early life, he was a mere bandit, preying on traders who ventured far away from civilization as they knew it. Then, his fortunes had transformed after a desperate Yagoda recruited him to lead a band of Buryat men to garrison the out-of-the-way village of Aldan. When the Bolsheviks regained control of the settlement, Ochirov found himself recruited by a wayward soldier named Sudoplatov. While his superior dreamed of forging a united Russia under the banner of Father Men, Ochirov held no true loyalty but to his homeland - Buryata.\n\nNow that his commanding officer has betrayed the Father, Ochirov has emerged from the shadows, returning to the town of Aldan and gathering a band of patriots for the liberation of Buryata. His opponent, Gomboev, claims to be building a new future for the Buryat following Men's example, but Ochirov sees through his lies. He knows that the Christians could never be a true friend to his people. He will no longer tolerate any foreign occupiers or pathetic collaborationists. Ochirov will secure a future for the Buryats, or he will die trying."
 
 POLITICS_LEONID_CHERNYKH_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Leonid Nikolayevich Chernykh's expedition marks the second time White Army forces have crossed the Amur into the wild, untamed lands of post-Soviet Russia. Chernykh's aims, however, stand in stark contrast to those of his comrades-in-arms in decades prior. In contravention to the few principles that the White Army once held close to its chest, Chernykh has submitted to the authority of a Communist: Pavel Sudoplatov.\n\nThe near-destruction of the White Army and their return to exile was a sobering experience, and Chernykh debated on whether or not the White movement in Harbin even had any grounds to continue existence. The collapse of Alexander Men's so-called Divine Mandate would cause a radical shift in the White remnants' thinking, and Chernykh was suddenly being begged by his remaining officers to march north once again.\n\nUpon his return to the Far East, however, it became clear to Chernykh that his forces were in no position to undertake any serious military operations. He was quick to send a message to Sudoplatov and the NKVD, offering his forces' help in stabilizing the region in exchange for food and supplies. Leonid Chernykh is a man with few hills left to die on. He cares no longer for the restoration of the Tsar, nor the dream of a White Russia. Chernykh only looks to shield his people from the uncertainty of anarchy."
 
 POLITICS_ZHAMBAL_GOMBOEV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Zhambal-Dorzhi Gomboev, Soviet loyalist, Buddhist, and war veteran, had never thought that he would one day follow the banner of a man of Christ. He had begun his career as a mere lackey of the NKVD, appointed by Yagoda as a token representative of the Buddhist population of the Far East. When many of his Buryat countrymen had joined the ranks of Sablin's mad rebellion, Gomboev had remained by Yagoda's side - perhaps out of a sense of loyalty.\n\nWhen word came of a Christian peasant uprising to the north, Gomboev rallied his co-religionists against the Father, for his people had a long memory of how the Christians had treated them. But when the Father cast down the Bolshevik remnants, Gomboev had been approached not with hatred, but with mercy. Father Men, out of a desire to accommodate those of all faiths, renewed Gomboev's position as the chief representative of Buddhism in Russia.\n\nAfter the Father had been betrayed, Gomboev had cleverly played Yakunin and Sudoplatov off, diverting their attention from his attempt to build a Buddhist socialist nation for the Buryat people, only to be evicted from his home by the partisan Ochirov. Now, he and his project fight for their very survival against a man who is unlikely to show willingness to compromise."
 
 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_IVANOVSKY_COLLAPSE_DESC: "The Pacific Fleet was never the most important arm of the Red Navy, but it had been a glorious and fearsome armada compared to the vestigial fleet of rusted hulks that now sit derelict in the harbors of Kamchatka. Nikolay Stepanovich Ivanovsky is the admiral of this ghostly flotilla, sending out the few seaworthy vessels he still commands to search for plunder in the frozen waters of the Arctic.\n\nAs the Divine Mandate disintegrated, a desperate Pavel Sudoplatov was keen to find any allies he could get his hands on. Sensing a potential friend in Ivanovsky's local pirate group, Sudoplatov aided his return to power in Kamchatka in exchange for mutual protection. However, Sudoplatov did not realize that Ivanovsky was distrusted even amongst his comrades in the former Pacific Fleet regime. A prior demotion for "gross violation of military discipline" served as proof of their lack of faith.\n\nTrue to his nature, Ivanovsky did not even wait a second to stab his partner in the back, denying any knowledge of an alliance and declaring Sudoplatov's forces to be fair game. The admiral has no illusions of a return to normalcy. To Ivanovsky, Communism is a fools' errand compared to survival, and to survive, the Pacific Fleet must seize whatever they find, from whoever they encounter."
 
 POLITICS_PAVEL_SUDOPLATOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Pavel Anatolyevich Sudoplatov was once a follower of Father Men, or at least he claimed to be. He in fact drew near to the Father and to God with his lips while his heart was far away from them. Seeing without perceiving and hearing without understanding, he deluded himself into thinking that his leader was a mere naïve idealist who needed to be kept in check and acted accordingly.\n\nBy the Mother of God, how wrong he was.\n\nNow Sudoplatov is denounced as a new Judas, as a betrayer of the late Father's vision. Though he attempts to rebuild, the foundation is built on sand and collapses more and more day after day. Though Sudoplatov cries out to God, "turn not Thy face away from me, and withdraw not from Thy servant in Thy anger," it matters not; from Heaven as from Earth no help is forthcoming. All the universe has turned away.\n\nEven his so-called followers, those who were with him in the NKVD and so on, no longer trust him. They exploit his meager power for their own ends. But Pavel Sudoplatov no longer rejects any of this. All hope is dead within him. He will not unify Russia. No, he will die one day or another, and be remembered as what he was: a treasonous assassin who destroyed a movement forever.\n\nSudoplatov, prostrating in guilt at the grave of the holy man he betrayed, could not agree more."
 
 POLITICS_IVAN_NIKISHOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Ivan Fedorovich Nikishov, director of the Kolyma Developmental Zone, is in over his head.\n\nWay back in the when, Nikishov was a leader of General Directorate of Construction in the Far North. When the Directorate fell flat, replaced by the Divine Mandate, Nikishov was assigned to the north by Sudoplatov in order to develop the historically impoverished region. Nikishov, unimpressed by Sudoplatov, had only one plan: to plunder it as he had the first time around.\n\nBut Nikishov had only ever known the region as docile and dependent. Now, they hoard guns and stage raids, snapping the thin threads that hold Nikishov's illegitimate rule in place with little to no effort or casualties. The despair brought about by Sudoplatov's foolhardy treatment of the Father has not dampened their Christian zeal against "oppressors" such as Nikishov.\n\nNikishov dares not say it aloud, but he knows the reality of his situation all too well. Though the Fraternal Union of Father Alexander Men is no more, destroyed by a too-clever-by-half imbecile of a spy chief, its effect - that of inciting the people of the Far East to hope for a better reality - has not faded, and will have to be reckoned with for the foreseeable future. Its most immediate consequence may well be the fall of Nikishov's government."
 
 POLITICS_GLEB_YAKUNIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Father Gleb Pavlovich Yakunin is no stranger to fleeing for his life. In youth, his entire family had been relocated from Moscow to Irktursk ahead of the advancing German forces. When Yagoda seized absolute control of the Presidium, Father Yakunin vanished into the woods with his mentor, Father Men, to escape a cruel fate at the hands of the NKVD. He found temporary shelter in the true believers of the far north, but Father Men's divine mission would once again drive him forward.\n\nNow, Father Yakunin has made what he hopes will be his last journey. He does not know how he alone managed to evade Sudoplatov's thugs - only God could have saved him. He finds himself in Magadan, surrounded by the last remnants of Men's vision. He leads a flock of his own, preaching that hope still remains for the believers.\n\nBut these words ring hollow, for Father Yakunin is not the visionary and reformer that Men was. His interpretation of the Orthodox Faith is far more like the Tsarist Church - whose sins brought the wrath of God upon her. No matter his skill at oratory, Father Yakunin will never unite the Motherland. To the world, he is nothing but a sad reminder of the movement that could have redeemed the soul of Russia."
 
 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KUROEDOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Vladimir Alekseevich Kuroedov was selected by Sudoplatov to lead his 1st Army in the aftermath of the collapse of the Divine Mandate. It was Sudoplatov's desperate hope that Kuroedov's personal experience in religious administration would help him mollify the locals and win them over to his side.\n\nInstead, the old commander has been acting increasingly strange. Rather than acting like a general or a Holy Synod bureaucrat or anything else one might have expected, he has taken up a new public persona - that of a scheming, zealous preacher quoting from Scripture and the Apostolic Fathers and draping himself in the ways of the old Father. While few take this garish display at face value, its intent is obvious.\n\nAs order in the Far East becomes an ever more distant memory, and Kureodov increasingly refuses to follow reports from Amur, it is clear to all that the Protection Committee's likeliest challenger already lies within its walls."
