 BRI_Party_MainImage_tt:0 "The British People's Party's existence as the sole legal political party has forced it into becoming a crowded house of different voices, each desperately trying to push the party to its ideals. These voices come in two sounds usually. One belongs to the Pragmatists, a mixture of genuine democrats, technocrats, and those of a vaguely reformist tendency. The other belongs to the Ideologues, diehard fascists who wish to undo the half-measures and turn Britain into a beacon of the New Order like Germany or Italy. Grouped among the second bunch include the Old Guard, the new establishment politicians primarily loyal to the beliefs of Domville and Chesterton, alongside those of a more abstruse variety.\n\nThese groups fight for influence over four separate sections of power: the Peers, the German Corporations, the German Garrison, and the Party as a whole. Using the methods privy to them, they attempt to influence each of these sections to their side, hopeful for their support in securing control over the BPP. Of course, support is never to be taken for granted, as influence slips from week to week. And if influence is divided between these two factions, the only victor is chaos, whose progress can only be undone to certain degrees. Chaos is in the interest of no one, bar one. If it wins, everyone else loses."

 TNO_BRI_Party_Butler_tt_delayed:0 "Throughout the History of Britannia, the United Kingdom has seen many traitors, from Anthony Babington to Guy Fawkes to Carl Hans Lody and, the newest and perhaps foulest of them all, his Majesty's loyal Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rab Butler. Born in Colonial India to an Imperial administrator, Richard Austen 'Rab' Butler attended Marlborough college, eventually dropping out to tutor kids in Britain and France. Following this, he went back to Cambridge, studying there for four years, taking a fellowship before resigning to run for parliament.\n\nElected to Parliament in 1929, Butler would be a key supporter of appeasement, going further than most in even arguing for an alliance with Germany in 39, going as far as advocating Britain back off its alliance with Poland; despite this, he would remain a key part of the wartime government. Yet, with Germany's conquest of the Isles in WW2, unlike many of his fellows, he chose to do the unthinkable, collaborate with the Teutons. As Chancellor, Butler has charted a §spragmatic§! course of economic recovery, helping Britain to recover from the devastation of the blitz and Sealion.\n\nNow, he is the head of the §spragmatists§! of the BPP, the greatest opponent to BUF's successor, the §Uideologues§! of the BPP. Many in the BPP are mistrustful of Butler, seeing his involvement in the wartime government as a showcase of his lack of loyalty to the new Britain, with the §UIdeologues§! in particular seeing him as nothing more than a political snake. Yet Butler remains, his support critical for any prime minister, his support from moderate collaborators unwavering and perhaps the last remnant of the old, free Britain.\n\nThe £GFX_BRI_pragmatists §sPragmatists§! currently hold [BRI_Party_GetPragmatistInfluence] influence."

Born at the close of the great war in Norfolk, he grew up in his Family's ancestral home, Narfold Hall, his Father was Vice Admiral Charles Fountaine, who had been Naval ADC to George V. He was educated at the Army College in Aldershot, going to Cambridge University studying natural sciences.\n\nFighting first for Franco's Nationalists, he would go onto enlist in the Navy in WW2, fighting admirably in the Pacific, returning home to a New Britain. From there, he rapidly rose through the ranks in the BPP with his unrepentant support for Fascism. He would eventually act as the face of the Fascist §UIdeologues§!, becoming the biggest opponent of Butler and the §sPragmatists§!, while earning, unlike so many of his fascist contemporaries, the distinct trust of the House of Lords, leading him to the role of Home Secretary. Now as one of the most powerful men in Britain and the right hand man of Domvile, Fountaine finally has the opportunity to implement the fascist social and cultural policies he saw in action 30 years ago, and to make Britain strong again.\n\nThe £GFX_BRI_ideologues §UIdeologues§! currently hold [?BRI_Party_InfluenceTotal|W1%%] influence."

The resistance, §RHMMLR§!, is planning to open up a new front in the Isle of Man - a normally forgotten countryside - that has turned into Washington's potential pipeline of supplies to our enemies. If we're to stand any chance of victory, we must defend the landing fields at any cost.\n\nThe resistance will attack any one of five different spots on the island, the job of our §lcounter-intelligence service§! is to make sure that they don't attack where we're most vulnerable. Our §nweaponry§! is the amount of weapons and supplies that we've invested into Mann to prevent a breakthrough by §RHMMLR's§! forces. Be warned, the more we invest in the island's §Jdefence§!, the costlier it shall become - potentially diverting from other fronts of the war.\n\nAs each sector comes under attack, devoting weapons to the effort will hold them back, but it's up to you, Prime Minister, to prioritise which area needs weapons the most.
