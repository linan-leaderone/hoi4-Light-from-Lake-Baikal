  GUC_Angelo_Almeida: "Ângelo Nolasco de Almeida"
  POLITICS_Angelo_Nolasco_de_Almeida_DESC: "Admiral Ângelo Nolasco de Almeida has achieved many prestigious positions during his long career in the Brazilian Navy, but he never expected to be the Military Commander of the Allied Administration of Guiana-Cayenne. His actions during the Estado Novo period and especially in repressing the Constitutionalist Revolution in 1932 brought him closer to Getúlio Vargas himself, which led to his appointment as Vargas' aide-de-camp in 1939. During the War, he acted as a military attaché to the Brazilian embassies in Argentina and Uruguay, later taking part in the invasion that brought Guiana-Cayenne into Brazilian occupation.\n\nAfter the fall of the Varguist regime, Almeida occupied many administrative positions in the Navy, always aligning with the Armed Forces' Constitutionalist faction. In 1961, President Lott honored the Admiral with an appointment to lead the Administration of Cayenne. The former French colony had been in an administrational limbo ever since the end of the War, with the detachment of Brazil from the Allies and the Americans' insistence in keeping it as a bargaining chip for a future French ally.\n\nHowever, this is not what Lott wants. The President has tasked Admiral Nolasco de Almeida with integrating the economy of Cayenne into that of Brazil, encouraging immigration, and creating new jobs. The Admiral has served the Brazilian state all his life, and he will do everything to accomplish this mission."

  GUC_International_Ambiguity: "The French Legacy"
  GUC_International_Ambiguity_desc: "The legacy of being a French penal colony for so long affects Cayenne to this day. With a sizeable French exile population, clashes with natives and Brazilian occupational forces are recurrent.\n\nThe invasion of Cayenne in the final days of WW2 has set the current stage of the region: the Allied Administration of Guiana-Cayenne is administered by the Brazilian state and Army, with diplomatic support from the US. However, the Americans wish to keep the Mandate's international status ambiguous and vague, so as not to anger a potential economic partner in either the French State or Free France. With the Vichy regime tied down by the Germans and de Gaulle's state tied up in its African entanglements, Brazil's aim for integrating Cayenne into its economy has prevailed."
  GUC_Brazilian_Immigration: "Brazilian Immigration"
  GUC_Brazilian_Immigration_desc: "While immigration between Brazil and French Guyana has always happened, its rates increased sharply after Lott's integrational policies started in 1960. Governor Ângelo Nolasco de Almeida has encouraged the creation of many jobs to pursue Lott's goal. This immigration has caused a population shift, with Brazilians emerging as a sizeable minority in Guiana-Cayenne, though not without clashes with the French and Creole populations."

  # Ministers
  GUC_Pauxy_Gentil_Nunes_hog_desc: "A sportsman in his youth, Pauxy Nunes entered politics at the behest of his brother Janary, the first governor of the territory of Amapá. After serving one term as governor from 1958 to 1961, he received an invitation by Admiral Nolasco de Almeida to head the Cayenne Administration's civilian government.\n\nDespite being a member of the PSP, Nunes has pledged to work towards Lott's goal, seeing the economic integration as a boon to his neighboring territory of Amapá. Nunes has fostered the creation of agricultural colonies and model farms in Guiana-Cayenne, advancing the region's food production."
  GUC_Luis_Mendes_da_Silva_eco_desc: "A military man, Luis Mendes da Silva has been selected by Admiral Nolasco de Almeida to lead the process of the economic integration of Cayenne. Mendes da Silva has been tasked with overseeing the building of highways to connect Cayenne and the territory of Amapá, furthering the economic ties and easing migration.\n\nWhile Mendes da Silva has connections to Castelo Branco and the Sorbonne faction of the Armed Forces, he is ready to work towards Lott's goal of integration, even if this means collaborating with the local French elites."
  GUC_Helio_Pennafort_for_desc: "Hélio Pennafort has dedicated his life to his career. A journalist, writer, and radio personality, Pennafort was a political commentator in Amapá and a major figure in the territory's media and culture.\n\nWhile his appointment to the government of the Allied Administration of Guiana-Cayenne came as a surprise to some, to him it is merely a way to make the people's voice heard and to properly communicate with the Brazilian government, and ensure that Cayenne gets whatever resources it needs. So far, he has done an effective job."
  GUC_Fernando_Belfort_Bethlem_sec_desc: "Fernando Belfort Bethlem has a thankless job.\n\nEntering the Military in 1932 he went on to become an aspiring and rapid rising Cavalry officer before the war. Promoted to Captain during ww2 he went with the Brazilian Expeditionary force to Britain. Fighting with Henrique Lott against the Germany tides and despite their defeat, Fernando for his valour received further promotions. Throughout the 50s Fernando continued to gain new titles before in 1961 being promoted to General by Henrique Lottm where he was immediatly deployed to Cayenne the death of all Brazilian generals careers.\n\nNow in Cayenne Fernando struggles to keep order with the limited cavalry troops he has, having to use the Brazilian garrison to stop clashes between the native French, Creole and immigrant Brazilian populations. While Fernando has kept order so far and lasted longer than some other generals in his role, he worries that one day there will be a battle too big for him and his limited garrison to win."
