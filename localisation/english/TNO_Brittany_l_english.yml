 BRT_Olier_Mordrel:0 "Olier Mordrel"
 POLITICS_OLIER_MORDREL_DESC:0 "To say Brittany's relationship with the Pakt is... complicated, is perhaps one of the greatest understatements one can possibly make about the Reich's little entente. Originally named an autonomous zone of France, Mordrel found himself continuously annoyed by the fact that years on from the war the Bretons were still forced under French yoke.\n\nWhen the Reich forcefully tore what is now Burgundy away from France, Mordrel saw his chance. Proposing that a free Brittany, loyal to the Reich in all ways, would be far more useful to the Reich than the now decrepit French state. Within weeks of the formation of Burgundy, Brittany was declared independent as well in a conference attended by thirty nations. None of which were France.\n\nWhen the Reich tumbled into destitution in the 50s however, Mordrel reluctantly decided to begin importing food from abroad despite the embargo between the United States and Germany. Illegally smuggling in goods to keep Brittany afloat, the Bretons soon realized the value of selling the food to the starving and needy of the Reich. This situation only expanded, for as the Black Market expanded, Germany became more and more powerless to stop it and more and more reliant on its goods.\n\nNow, a decade later, Brittany stands as the staple port for illegal goods crossing into the Reich with Mordrel as its kingpin. While he has never professed any love for the Reich, they have so far kept the black legions of Himmler out of his affairs, and the pipeline of food, media, and much more illicit goods have certainly made Brittany as strong as he had once dreamed, even if the methods were a tad unexpected..."
 BRT_Raymond_Delaporte:0 "Raymond Delaporte"
 POLITICS_RAYMOND_DELAPORTE_DESC:0 "While Mordrel, Delaporte and Lainé were once brothers in arms and founders of the Breton National Committee, time has a way of causing all things to crumble. Time brought the Reich low, time ended the old order of Europe, and time too ended a partnership that saw Brittany rise from a forgotten footnote in history to the first European state to achieve its independence since the Second World War.\n\nThe true destruction of the friendship arose from the increasing differences in ideology, even while Brittany prospered and expanded. Mordrel became increasingly obsessed with his illegal trading, believing it to be the only way to a strong Brittany, and had become convinced that he could somehow play the various powers of the world against one another for the Breton good. Lainé had become disgusted with what he saw as Brittany growing weaker by the day and his two companions were increasingly worried by his growing hardline stances and the rapid militarization of the Bezen Perrot.\n\nDelaporte, however, saw his path in the opposite direction. An intellectual, he believed that democratic values and a denouncement of extremist sentiments would be the only possibility for a lasting Breton state. The abomination that is the Black Market had to be killed, and responsibility had to be taken for the horrors Brittany sold to the world, and the Bezen Perrot had to be shut down as the final step towards true freedom. Delaporte's denouncement of the Perrot was seen as a shock to the others, and his increasing declarations that liberty would need to spread to Brittany finished the deal.\n\nDelaporte cares little about whether these virtues will improve the world, but they will improve Brittany. Can any true patriot wish for anything else?"
 BRT_Celestin_Laine:0 "Célestin Lainé"
 POLITICS_CELESTIN_LAINE_DESC:0 "Boots marching across Europe, tanks rolling over the ancient regimes and a single strong leader ruling over it all. The Reich showed the world true strength when it trampled upon its enemies and it inspired in Lainé the true strength that a strong and spirited military and a stronger leader could provide.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war and even more rapidly after independence was achieved, Lainé militarized the Bezen Perrot into his own personal force of stormtroopers, in every way modelled after the German SS. Seeing strong ties to the Reich and especially Burgundy as a necessity to maintain Breton strength, Lainé has numerous times called for Brittany to select the customers of the Black Market more carefully, and even declare itself a 'brother state' of Burgundy.\n\nAs he has increasingly radicalized over the years and his group of militants have increasingly turned into a private army, Lainé and his two former companions-Delaporte and Mordrel-have fallen increasingly apart. Whether it is Mordrel and his constant degenerate actions that actively harm Brittany's greatest allies or Delaporte's treasonous assinuations that Brittany should abandon the very ideals that gave it life, his two former friend's downfall was long foretold.\n\nWith his old companionships broken, Lainé let his tears be shed in private before marching out and preparing his men for the final step in Brittany's greatness. So what if friends will betray a man and old comrades leave him in the dust? Hitler himself was once nothing besides a struggling pauper. Lainé too will show the world what he is capable of, he will show his former 'friends' the insanity of their beliefs, and he will show Brittany that only he can keep her safe."
 POLITICS_GOULVEN_PENNAOD_DESC:0 "Born in 1928 and originally known by his French name Georges Pinault, Brittany has always been close to Goulven Pennaod's heart. A Breton nationalist from a young age, for a long time Pennaod's life revolved around the cause for Breton independence. Being too young to take part in the war efforts during the Second World War, he instead joined one of the many youth movements connected to Breton nationalist groups, and served with distinction.\n\nPennaod's claim to fame arose after the war, as he joined the armed forces of the newly established Breton state. With practiced skills he became the bane of French partisans seeking refuge and hideouts in Brittany, ensuring the continued stability of Brittany. In 1960, his efforts were recognized as he became the youngest general in the equally young Breton army.\n\nDespite the large influence Bezen Perrot held in the army, Pennaod never felt compelled to join the group, seeing his first and only duty being towards Brittany herself. In time, and especially after his promotion to general, this stubborness created friction between him (And his fellow non-BP officers) and the officers loyal to Lainé.\n\nAs the foremost officer still loyal to Brittany, it fell unto Pennaod to secure the state after Delaporte's revolution. But despite his good intentions, Delaporte bit more than he could chew, and risked the wrath of the Burgundians by flirting with the leftists. Pennaod and the Military Clique had to step in, to save Brittany from herself.\n\nNow in charge of the young democracy, it remains to be seen if Pennaod will succeed where Delaporte failed."
 POLITICS_YANN_FOUERE_DESC:0 "Jean Adolphe Fouéré was born in Aignan, southern France, on the 26th of July, 1910. From a young age, he would come to know firsthand the oppression of the Bretons under French rule, as Breton culture was suppressed in public life around him. In time, Yann Fouéré came to despise the situation, and effectively turned to Breton nationalism.\n\nHaving served a distinguished career in various Breton newspapers, Fouéré was also active in Breton politics. While a Breton at heart, he became a supporter of federalism as laid out by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and has been advocating for it in his numerous newspaper articles. For a long time, there were merely his own musings, as necessity demanded an alliance of all democrats in Brittany, and for all to look past their differences in order to guarantee the success of the revolution. Now, things have changed.\n\nAfter taking control of the so-called Moderate Wing of the SAV, Fouéré was free to spread his federalist ideas to his comrades. And as evidenced by his election of the president of Brittany, his ideas had struck a chord.\n\nWith the way clear, Fouéré is free to chase his dreams. While not yet announced, he has been crafting a theory of a federalist Europe, where Europe is redrawn according to regional borders, forming ethnically homogenous states. These states would then from a pan-European federation of nations, an Europe of a 100 flags.\n\nIt remains to be seen if such radical ideas will strike the same chord among his supporters as his previous ideas."

 BRT_breton_national_committee_desc:0 "Founded during the Congress of Pontivy on July 3rd, 1940, the Comité National Breton (Breton National Committee) is the governing political body of Brittany. Ever since its inception, the BNC has been dominated by Olier Mordrel and the Strollad Broadel Breizh (Breton National Party), but winds of change are beginning to blow.\n\nOn the one hand, Raymond Delaporte, one of the founding members of the BNC, has distanced himself from the SBB, yearning for democracy for the Bretons, and has organized the supporters of democracy into the Strollad ar Vro (Patriotic Party).\nOn the other hand, Célestin Lainé, the leader of the Bezen Perrot, not impressed with Mordrel's leadership, has been making moves in the shadows cast by his troops.\n\nShould the BNC fail to remain united, the future of Brittany may look very different from what Mordrel has imagined."

 BRT_the_bezen_perrot_desc:0 "The official date of founding for the Bezen Perrot (Perrot Unit), 11th of November, 1943, is celebrated annually throughout Brittany, even if the paramilitary organization has deeper roots in Breton nationalism. Named after Jean-Marie Perrot, a Breton nationalist assassinated by communist partisans, the unit saw much action in their anti-partisan duties during the war. With Germany victorious, the Bezen Perrot had played a crucial role in achieving what countless Bretons in the past had only dreamed of: Liberating Brittany.\n\nToday, the Bezen Perrot has grown from its Waffenverband days into a considerable force, having considerable influence over the armed forces and the defense of Brittany. However, the Bezen Perrot is still considered to be the armed wing of the Strollad Broadel Breizh (Having ousted the Bagadoù Stourm from its position as the SBB's paramilitary force), and therefore has much say in the politics of Brittany.\n\nThis fact has not eluded the leader of the Bezen Perrot, Célestin Lainé, and with the recent friction between Lainé and Mordrel, the Bezen Perrot may be aiming to gain a majority within the SBB."
