 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC: "Many groups speak of oppression, of their struggle to assert their independence in a world overrun with violent imperialists. Yet, they are blind to the ways they oppress others, to the violence they inflict in the name of their so-called "revolutions."\n\nMustafa Barzani understands this fact more than most people. He was weaned inside a prison after Turkish forces imprisoned his entire family. His childhood was punctuated by executions of his grandfather, father, and brother. As a teenager, Mustafa both fought in and led rebellions against British forces and the newly established Iraqi monarchy- actions that led to his exile. When he finally returned to Kurdistan after the Golden Square's revolution, he found his entire home destroyed and his people starving. His pleas to Baghdad for aid were met with crackdowns, interrupted only by a Turkish invasion in 1959 and a second war between Iraq and Turkey a few years later. Despite it all, Mustafa Barzani never stopped fighting for his people.\n\nWhile Mustafa Barzani respected Qasim and humored his promises of a multi-ethnic republic, he never surrendered his hope for a free Kurdistan. He sees the Oil Crisis as the best opportunity to end centuries of oppression for himself and his people. While there are quiet grumblings about his leadership- mainly stemming from accusations of arbitrariness and rumors of corruption- all are willing to put aside their grievances to support him lest they be forced into the mountains and forced to fight for yet another generation."
