  SUR_1947_Constitution:0 "The 1947 Dutch Constitution"
  SUR_1947_Constitution_desc:0 "Talk of constitutional reform was already commonplace during the government's exile in London; however, when the government was forced into further exile in the Caribbean, there was no choice; the constitution was reformed.\n\nThe new Constitution of 1947 is not too different from the previous one in its underpinnings: it espouses the fundamental values of freedom and democracy, under a constitutional monarchy. However, it is different in one major thing: it provides ample autonomy to the various remaining Caribbean colonies, which have become constituent democracies within the democracy that is the exiled Kingdom of the Netherlands."
  SUR_Poster_Boy_OFN:0 "Poster Boy of the OFN"
  SUR_Poster_Boy_OFN_desc:0 "Being one of the last standing members of the old Allied Powers, the exile-government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Suriname is a member of the Organization of Free Nations. However, because of the obvious difficulties presented by being a government exiled to a rump portion of its former colonial empire, it is heavily reliant on extensive loans and other assistance to keep itself afloat.\n\nAs a result of the flow of aid to Suriname, the country has become known as the poster-boy of the OFN, a democracy kept alive and made to flourish by the extensive assistance of its free, democratic allies. While this has led to a strong economic situation, that strength is in fact fragile, as the country is quite strongly dependent on OFN assistance."

  SUR_queen_wilhelmina:0 "Queen Wilhelmina"
  SUR_queen_wilhelmina_desc:0 "The only child of King Willem III of the Netherlands and Emma of Waldeck-Pyrmont, Wilhelmina of the Netherlands became queen at the age of 10. After taking charge of the government after a regency, Wilhelmina was popular for maintaining Dutch neutrality during the First World War and helping to solve many of her country's industrial problems. Her business ventures made her the world's first female billionaire; she went on to ensure that her family was one of the few European royal houses remaining in existence. But all that went to hell when the Nazis came.\n\nFollowing the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Wilhelmina fled to Britain and took charge of the Dutch government-in-exile. The fall of the United Kingdom to the Germans was a just as grave a blow to her as the loss of her homeland, and she had to flee to the Caribbean. Shortly after her arrival in Suriname, Wilhelmina tried to abdicate; however, the government refused to permit it, as the government in exile was in no condition to take such a strain. However, it was later agreed that her daughter, Crown Princess Juliana, would take her place in events and ceremonies while she remained queen.\n\nIn the 40s, Dirk Jan de Geer left, and was replaced by Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy. Later Gerbrandy too retired, utterly exhausted by the strains of governance; he was replaced by the mild-mannered Aat van Rhijn. But it changed nothing: Wilhelmina, as always, remains at odds with the government."

  SUR_queen_juliana:0 "Queen Juliana"
  SUR_queen_juliana_desc:0 "Queen Juliana of the Netherlands is the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She received a private education and studied international law at the University of Leiden. In 1937, she married Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld; with him she had four daughters: Beatrix, Irene, Margriet, and Christina. During the German invasion in the Second World War, the royal family was evacuated to the United Kingdom; eventually, Juliana and her children went to Canada while Bernhard and Wilhelmina remained behind; when the United Kingdom was invaded, the rest of the family joined Juliana in Canada and then went to Suriname, where the Dutch exile government had at last settled down.\n\nSince the decline of her mother in the late 40s, Juliana has been essentially de-facto Queen-in-exile of the Netherlands, replacing her mother at ceremonies and events. Despite the apparent strength of the Hitlerite tyranny over the Kingdom of the Netherlands, she remains optimistic that Amsterdam will be liberated someday. Even if that does not take place, she refuses to despair; in that case she will most willingly join her exile government in entering into formal agreements with the Caribbean colonies to form a real country, evolving beyond this transitory state of affairs."
 
  SUR_surinamese_independence: "Surinamese Independence"
  SUR_surinamese_independence_desc: "In the days before Suriname became independent—or perhaps that should be "independent"—the present economic privations were regarded as commendable, and a sign of the Organization of Free Nations' benevolence to the country. To the Republic of Suriname in the present day, however, they are nothing if not a burden.\n\nThe Dutch are nominally 'gone', but private Dutch funds still own the entire Surinamese economy. Meanwhile, the Netherlands-in-exile and the United States, having failed to keep Surinamese citizens under their direct control, instead satisfy themselves by making them reliant on limited, insufficient deployments of foreign aid."
  
  CUR_Exiles_in_the_Antilles: "Exiles in the Antilles"
  CUR_Exiles_in_the_Antilles_desc: "It would be good to believe that this banishment is only temporary, that good will triumph over evil and a day will come when the exiles leave this foreign shore. One can almost imagine that day, in some far-off future, where men and women stand crowded on the deck of some great ship, wiping tears from their eyes, as they return home. They gaze upon the beaches, the dykes, the dunes. They arrive to a pristine Amsterdam, restored to its ancient glory, and are given flowers and laurels to welcome them back to a nation reborn.\n\nBut this dream is a lie. It is a delusion. There will be no restoration of the Netherlands. There will be no return from exile. There will be no smiling faces or brotherly embraces or happy tears. On the arid beaches of Aruba, there is only rot and desolation for a kingdom that once ruled the waves and controlled global trade.\n\nSo the Queen and her court will continue to huddle in their brightly colored palace, clinging to their selfish fantasies as the world passes them by. They will issue edicts heard by no one, as rescued Rembrandts crack in their frames and Vilsco fabrics bleach beneath the cruel sun. And they will shut out the growing anger and frustration from those they have displaced in Aruba. They will ignore those who curse their names and pretensions of noble sacrifice until it is too late and the dream that was the Kingdom of the Netherlands finally vanishes for good."

  SUR_1971_Constitution: "1971 Constitution"
  SUR_1971_Constitution_desc: "Amsterdam was lost, and the rolling fields of Holland would never again grace the exiles' eyes. But they were once able to comfort themselves with the fact that they were at least still free and democratic as their fathers had been since the defeat of the Spanish rule.\n\nNo more. The new coup-installed military government, claiming to be "preserving hope and strength for the Dutch people," wrote a constitution that has essentially cracked down on five hundred years of democratic tradition. Previously democratic institutions have been restricted in a manner that might give a Somoza or a Morínigo pause. Colonial autonomy and the rights of citizens of the colonies have been destroyed.\n\nThe military men may convince themselves—or more accurately try and fail to do so—that by engaging in what is legitimately being called sacrilege they have saved what is left of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. But in reality these jackboots have created a hollowness and conflict in the last of the free Hollanders, a wound that will not be healed even if somehow the Netherlands are freed, and the Royal Standard flies from Paleis Amsterdam once more."

  SUR.skeleton.6.t: "March of Suriname" # For america about the upcoming referendum

  SUR.skeleton.6.desc: "On the third pass over the royal compound in Dutch Aruba, the pilot of Girard Dawson's unmarked helicopter concluded the palace had no space suitable for landing such a large aircraft. Dawson, the FBI's bureau chief in Paramaribo, asked what the alternative would be if they couldn't land. "We return to Oranjestad," offered the pilot, "or you take a dip." Without hesitation, Dawson began strapping himself into a life jacket and pointed the pilot towards a yacht berthing.\n\nOnce the helicopter was low enough, Dawson hopped into rotor-whipped waters and began swimming to shore amid the torrents. Once he waded onto solid ground, the soaked FBI agent caught sight of his contacts, Prince Bernhard and a cohort of Royal Army generals, running towards him. One car ride and a warm shower later, Dawson was with the group sipping port wine on a nearby veranda when General Frans van der Veen broached an ugly request. "As you know, the Estates of Suriname has recently voted for a Surinamese independence referendum," said the General through his cigarette-pursed lips, "and we want to stop it." Snickers and glass clinking filled the air.\n\nThese old kingpins of Dutch reaction held Surinamese autonomy in contempt and sought American support in "securing" the Kingdom's future. The Estates of Suriname was de facto the legal parliament of the Netherlands, and thus American involvement in overthrowing an OFN member government would violate the OFN's charter. Conversely, an independent Suriname would certainly exist outside the OFN. Dawson mulled the request and its implications."

  SUR.news.1.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]The Death of Queen Wilhelmina"
  SUR.news.1.desc:0 "Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, exiled in Suriname, has died of cardiac arrest in her makeshift residence in Paramaribo where she has stayed since the government-in-exile's decampment to the Caribbean. The death came as no surprise: Wilhelmina had long been ill, forcing her daughter, the now-Queen Juliana, to assume more and more of her duties.\n\nThe Dutch Caribbean - at times plagued by disagreements - unites to mourn her death; mourning has even been reported in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. At the late queen's request, the funeral was performed in white vestments rather than black in reflection of her Christian belief that death was merely the beginning of eternal life. Due to the circumstances, a special cemetery has been built in Paramaribo to house her remains; however, government sources indicate that if Amsterdam is ever freed, she will join her ancestors in the Royal Crypt there.\n"

  SUR.news.2.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Reformation of the Dutch Basic Laws"
  SUR.news.2.desc:0 "Recent actions by the Dutch government against Surinamese autonomy have sparked protests in the capital city of Paramaribo following revisions to the colonial Basic Laws. The mostly vacant Dutch legislature passed legislation that reduced the exile government to a ceremonial position and established voting privileges for exiles in Suriname. Queen Juliana's advisors then advised her to dismiss the Surinamese Prime Minister and appoint the Dutch Prime Minister, thus further unifying the Dutch realm.\n\nThe move has sparked outrage among the Surinamese population, who view this move as a violation of prior autonomy agreements with the Dutch crown. While the current Surinamese National Assembly will continue to stand until the next elections, the new Basic Laws have produced a rift between the exiles and Surinamese populations.\n"

  SUR.news.3.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Reorganization of the Dutch Realm"
  SUR.news.3.desc:0 "From Paramaribo, the Dutch government-in-exile has agreed with the Estates of Suriname regarding the Kingdom's political future. In exchange for increased crown control over the Surinamese government, the Dutch government-in-exile has decided to dissolve itself and grant Suriname status as the Kingdom of the Netherlands's primary constituent country. This deal comes after months of negotiations and integrates the old Dutch political system into the Surinamese government.\n\nWhile the agreement has received the endorsement of Suriname's United Hindustani Party and a minority of its National Party, nationalists in the Estates have decried the laws as a usurpation of Suriname's sovereignty. Furthermore, the inclusion of Dutch constituencies in Suriname's upcoming elections points towards a double standard in the new government uncomfortable to autonomists.\n"

  SUR.news.4.desc:0 "Protests in the Surinamese capital of Paramaribo have halted the city as anger against corruption in the government of Prime Minister Jo Meynen continues to pour into the streets. Demonstrations remained nonviolent, but students and factory workers conducted political demonstrations for Meynen's dismissal in swelling numbers. In response to the protests, Queen Juliana dismissed Meynen pending new elections in June.\n\nWhile the ordeal is unlikely to produce an investigation, the Prime Minister's dismissal has been hailed by the National Party as a victory for Surinamese democracy. The upcoming elections are already hard-fought, with campaign debates over independence and the royal prerogative polarizing voters.\n"

  SUR.news.5.desc:0 "A political confrontation between Queen Juliana and the government of Surinamese Prime Minister Johan Kraag has led to Kraag's dismissal pending new elections. The dispute originated over the 1969 budget proposed by Kraag and his National Party, which ballooned benefits and state investments with a steep deficit. While Kraag has argued that growth and OFN aid would counteract the accrued debt, conservatives nonetheless have secured his dismissal.\n\nKraag's removal has since caused an uproar in the Estates of Suriname, and members of the National Party are increasingly campaigning on pro-independence platforms. While independence supporters lack a majority in the Estates, issues of the royal prerogative have polarized the upcoming election.\n"

  SUR.news.6.desc:0 "Protests against government corruption and Dutch nepotism have afflicted Suriname for weeks following further revelations about abuses by the Jo Meynen government. Demonstrations remained nonviolent but spread beyond Paramaribo into peripheral towns and the Netherlands Antilles. Fearing this unrest could lead to a revolution, officers of the Royal Netherlands Army seized upon the demonstrators and began a rapid crackdown on anti-government figures and organizations. Prime Minister Maynen has since resigned, apparently unwillingly, and Lieutenant General Frans van der Veen has replaced him as head of a junta.\n\nThe military government has reiterated that "the Kingdom of the Netherlands" would return to democracy, though the junta has yet to provide a timeline. For now, autonomy and democracy in Suriname were suppressed by force.\n"

Dutch polling experts and international observers had long estimated Suriname would remain in the Dutch realm. Still, recent anti-government demonstrations and rallying support for nationalist parties pushed voters toward independence.\n\nPro-independence sections of the National Party have praised the results as an expression of democracy, while the Dutch Christian Democratic Appeal has begun evacuating its organs to Aruba. Surinamese independence has reduced the Dutch crownland to the Netherlands Antilles, now the only remaining country in a once world-spanning Kingdom.\n"

  SUR.news.8.desc:0 "Hours after polling stations closed across Suriname, voting returns confirmed a majority of Surinamese had voted against independence. This was not surprising to the Dutch government, who had long expected the vote to fail, but still, Queen Juliana issued a note of reconciliation to the independence camp. In Paramaribo was a mood of relief, disappointment, and scattered bursts of anger, but life moved on.\n\nWhile Surinamese nationalist parties vowed to continue lobbying for independence, representatives of the United Hindustani Party supported the results as a basis for further national autonomy. Animosities over past wrongs remain in recent memory for many Surinamese, fueling the continued independence movement. For now, however, the nation has chosen to stay with the Kingdom.\n"

  AAT_VAN_RHIJN_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Dr. Arie Adriaan "Aat" van Rhijn, a civil servant and politician, was born in Groningen in 1892; he studied at the universities of Utrecht and Groningen and served in various functions - for company associations, employee associations, five or six different ministries, and so on - until his appointment to Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries mere days before the German invasion.\n\nFleeing to London, and then from there to Ottawa and Paramaribo, van Rhijn watched as the Kingdom of Netherlands fell to a low from which it has only slightly recovered since, as the Nazi jackboot gouged into the Netherlands and the Yamato 'anti-colonialists' 'liberated' the Dutch East Indies. Van Rhijn was able to come through the last twenty years more or less sane, but others - such as Prime Ministers Dirk Jan de Geer and Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy, to say nothing of Queen Wilhelmina - were less well off; van Rhijn had to watch in sadness as so many people he knew and respected declined into misery, sickness, and decrepitude.\n\nGerbrandy, exhausted beyond belief, stepped down in the mid 1950s, choosing van Rhijn to take over; the far-flung people of Suriname have come to consider him a good fit for the job. A competent statesman, administrator, operating as a moderate Protestant conservative with significant respect for non-Protestants and the labor movement, Aat van Rhijn strives to stay the course, reforming only with common consent, for fear of upsetting the modus vivendi created in this country of exiles, immigrants, and colonists."
