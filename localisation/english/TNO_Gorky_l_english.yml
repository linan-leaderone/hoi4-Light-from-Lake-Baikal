 ### Ideas ###
 GOR_state_of_perpetual_warfare: "State of Perpetual Warfare"
 GOR_state_of_perpetual_warfare_desc: "Gorky has been at war since the fall of the Soviet Union, and has no intention to cease its status as a front city, and key military organ in the eternal war against Germany. The city is a fortress, the Red Army highly trained, and the economy entirely devoted to outputting as much war materiel as possible. Raids against Moskowien are a common occurrence - and the Control Commission has no intention of ending combat operations."
 GOR_growing_malaise: "Growing Malaise"
 GOR_growing_malaise_desc: "The combat operations of the Red Army, and the over-industrialization of Gorky, are rapidly burning through the resources immediately available to the Control Commission. Going by all measures of production and available resources, if the bombings do not end soon, or the rule of the Front is not restored, the days of the Control Commission are numbered - and the collapse of the military-industrial apparatus ticks closer each day."

 ### Character Loc ###
 GOR_Ivan_Chernyakhovsky: "Ivan Chernyakhovsky"
 POLITICS_IVAN_CHERNYAKHOVSKY_DESC: "Ivan Danilovich Chernyakhovsky has had his soul snuffed out by the blaze of the Russian Anarchy - yet he can count himself among the lucky ones. This wasteland has done far worse.\n\nHis transformation began during the West Russian War, when Ivan Chernyakhovsky commanded the Eighth Army. In those days, Chernyakhovsky was a cheerful commander. When Gavrilov began his retreat, Chernyakhovsky pulled back to Gorky, tearing across the rising chaos of Russia.\n\nYet the nation he returned to was as lost as the territory he escaped. The people had become deluded with reaction, jeering at the Red Army. Communists were tearing the stars off their suits and goose-stepping with fascists and capitalists. By the time he reached Gorky, there was nothing left in Chernyakhovsky but anger - towards the Germans that destroyed his home, and the Russians that betrayed it.\n\nTrapped in Gorky, all that guides Chernyakhovsky is bitterness and duty. With Russia lost, he has focused his attention on weakening the Reich with his remaining forces. The battle with Germany is the last hope for Communism - it must be continued, despite the cost."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_AVERIN_DESC: "Know, oh listener, that after the fall of the Soviet Union and its armies, as the lands of Russia trembled under the German might, there was an age undreamed of, when warring states lay spread across Russia like blue mantles beneath the stars - Vologda, Onega, Arkhangelsk, Komi with its fledgling democracy and its struggling paramilitaries, Samara with its collaborators guarded by Germans. But the proudest state of all was Moskowien, reigning supreme over the Russian West. Hither came Nikolay Stepanovich Averin, from Gorky, black-hearted, sullen-eyed, gun in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic ambitions and gigantic mirth, to overwhelm the Nazi garrisons of Moskowien under the treads of his tanks.\n\nThe master of terror in Western Russia, Averin first became infamous among the Germans in the time of the West Russian War, as he led the fiercest tank army under Yegorov's command. In the chaotic days following the conflict, Averin gathered the bulk of what was left of the Russian armored forces for a last stand near Gorky, where he repelled the assaulting Wehrmacht to allow the remaining Russian troops to retreat safely. After the collapse of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, Gorky was left standing, and Averin stood with her.\n\nOver the years, Averin's tank fleet has been both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness. To keep it operational, he soon had to resort to large scale raids into German territory, reaping from the vast and overstretched territories of the German settlers all the fuel, parts and prisoners he needed to keep his army operational. Soon, Averin started to enjoy his new life as a raider, and soon all ideological pretense was lost - the only thing Averin cares about now is to crush the Germans, see them driven before him, and hear the lamentations of their women!"

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_KATUKOV_DESC: "Mikhail Yefimovich Katukov is a deservingly proud Soviet soldier. A loyal Soviet soldier, not a match for bandit traitors with who he once served along. A distinguished tank officer since the days of the Great Patriotic War, he first made his fame in the inglorious and tragic 1941, when he managed to hold the onslaught of the German Panzer divisions under Tula, greatly impressing Heinz Guderian, the general who commanded them. The will of one man was not enough to save the Union from the tread of the Fascist beast, but even in the wake of the Soviet defeat, Katukov refused to surrender.\n\nAlong with General Averin, he spearheaded the tank wedges of the Red Army during the West Russian War, successfully driving the occupiers out of the Gorky Oblast, but his great victories were to no avail, as his divisions were cut off from the military government in Arkhangelsk by reactionary insurgent forces and his men found themselves isolated in the newly reclaimed city. While the rest of the forces stationed in Gorky under Averin found their new calling in piracy and debauchery, Katukov and his men abstained from their activities, waiting for their opportunity to come.\n\nOnly when the bandit warlords were forced to succumb to the whims of the begotten urban bourgeoisie of Gorky, the aged Soviet general saw his last chance to serve the Soviet Union. Bringing with himself every loyalist he could gather, Katukov dealt a swift blow against the weak and capitalist government, raising the Soviet banner over Gorky once again. And this time, the sacred Red Banner will not fall to the enemy, nor it will be disgraced by the crimes against the Soviet people, as long as the faithful sons of the Motherland will not perish."

 GOR_ONG_Konstantin_Katushev: "Konstantin Katushev"
 POLITICS_ONEGA_KONSTANTIN_KATUSHEV_DESC: "Much like most people in the city, the life of Konstantin Fedorovich Katushev was definitively shaped by the Gorky Automobile Plant. Even in his childhood, he lived near the factory, while his father had worked there for almost his entire life. No one was surprised when Konstantin grew up to become a leading engineer of GAZ, designing and perfecting plans for new and better vehicles.\n\nTruth be told, he was never satisfied with who he worked for. The warmongering tank pirates of Gorky were no fit for a quiet and intelligent man like Katushev, and neither were the new rulers of the city.\n\nHowever, the Northern Russian Republic proved to be the perfect match: combining the newly found stability with the capabilities of GAZ, Katushev now proudly runs not only the factory, but the entire city, bringing many profits to the Republic, and achieving his life's dream."

 #Literal tankies
 GOR_Pyotr_Nikolaevich_Lashchenko: "Pyotr Lashchenko"
 GOR_Pyotr_Nikolaevich_Lashchenko_hog_desc: "§YFirst Deputy Commander-in-Chief\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\nFocus. Scrutinous labor. The unwavering Pyotr Lashchenko perceives the same value in these pillars in battle as he does administration. In the face of isolation from the larger First Guards Tank Army, facing the iron wrath of the Wehrmacht, neither he nor the Ninth Mechanized Corps were vanquished. Deprived of a united motherland, his loyalty has fallen to the Control Commission in Gorky.\n\nHowever, boisterousness invariably fetters diligence. Consequently, Pyotr is content to remain quiet, to let his colleagues within the Control Commission bicker over political scraps. In his new function as administrator, he toils away, tending to the basic function and fabric of administrative work."
 GOR_Mikhail_Efimovich_Katukov: "Mikhail Katukov"
 GOR_Mikhail_Efimovich_Katukov_for_desc: "§YHead of the Communication Department\nStratocratic Communism§!\n--------------\nEvery fire within a man's soul will one die out. It is with this in mind that one ought to look up to the men whose hearts burn so brightly that they keep the fires of those around them burning. And there is no fire as fierce in Gorky as that of Katukov, commander of the legendary First Guards Tank Army. Katukov is a man whose iron will and commitment to socialism have never faltered no matter the times.\n\nHis many distinctions during the Great Patriotic War and the West Russian War ensured that even as the front collapsed, he held firm near the frontline city of Gorky. His many accomplishments would even turn him into kingmaker of the city, facilitating Chernyakhovsky's rise to Chairman.\n\nNowadays he remains as the city's contact to the outside, constantly in communication with the Front's leadership and the many partisan groups in Moskowien. If a man keeps the war alive even today years after its supposed end, it is Katukov."
 GOR_Boris_Mikhailovich_Golovchiner: "Boris Golovchiner"
 GOR_Boris_Mikhailovich_Golovchiner_eco_desc: "§YHead of the Economic Department\nStratocratic Communism§!\n--------------\nIn a land of sorrow, it is such a terrible thing to even feel a modicum of responsibility. Boris Golovchiner, once Chief of Staff of the Eighth Army, now holds the important task of ensuring Gorky's autarky. Thankfully, the impromptu economist has a talent for resource management. Such is his skill that it is common knowledge in government that they owe him a great debt.\n\nSo why does his chest not fill with pride? Smiles and thanks for the appreciation is what Gorky sees, but his mind speaks a different truth. His policies have won no warm feelings from the workers or civilians, for his policies have won them no warmth. Every day, this truth crushes the Socialist Soldier more and more."
 GOR_Mikhail_Alekseevich_Shalin: "Mikhail Shalin"
 GOR_Mikhail_Alekseevich_Shalin_sec_desc: "§YDeputy Commander-in-Chief for Civil Administration Affairs\nUltramilitarism§!\n--------------\nThe Front shattered. Battered in its fight against the Nazi hordes and betrayed from the inside, it was unable to keep fighting. Or at least that was what many believed. For others the fight was never over, simply entering a lul. Former chief of staff of the First Guards Tank Army, Mikhail Shalin was one such man.\n\nAs the front halted, he refused to head to the relative safety of the north. Instead, he scoffed at it and all those who escaped the frontlines. Mikhail chose that he would remain in the very front till dead tore him away. It was this iron will that left him as the chief of the Front's Main Intelligence Directorate, working tirelessly from dusk till dawn to ensure that Gorky remained fighting."
