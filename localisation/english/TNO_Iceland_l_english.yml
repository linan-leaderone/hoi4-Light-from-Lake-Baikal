 ###IDEAS###
 ICE_icelandic_indpendence: "Icelandic Independence"
 ICE_icelandic_indpendence_desc: "It is inadvisable to speak too deeply about how precisely Iceland attained its independence, for Icelanders still feel some sympathy over the misery Denmark has been subjected to since the war. But the outcomes of that situation are an interesting conversation that is discussed hundreds of times a day.\n\nIceland has a unique leverage within the Organization of Free Nations. Though the country lacks a standing army, its defense is provided for by law—by the United States. Furthermore, the United States also intervenes in Iceland's favour during international disputes.\n\nSubjects such as these are a long, lively, and often positive line of discussion. But the discussion is just as readily poisoned when one thinks of the not insubstantial disadvantages to Icelandic membership in the OFN."

 ICE_special_relationship: ""Special Relationship""
 ICE_special_relationship_desc: "Iceland and the United States of America have a special relationship, though what is meant by 'special' depends on who has been asked.\n\nTo some people, Iceland-US relations are special in a good way. These point at the defense of Iceland's interests, which the United States often take upon themselves to defend, economic benefits in the capital due to the presence of soldiers, and the preservation of stability provided by allied troops.\n\nTo others, the relationship is special in a uniquely bad way. They complain that the country has effectively been occupied by OFN forces, and that local Icelanders are unable to use and benefit from large parts of their country due to military appropriations. To some particularly hyperbolic people, the boots on the ground might as well be Nazi jackboots with how omnipresent and out-of-touch they are.\n\nRegardless of one's own convictions, the relationship is and remains special—but which way it will go, is America's and Iceland's to determine."

 ICE_tensions_at_keflavik: "Tensions at Keflavík"
 ICE_tensions_at_keflavik_desc: "The closer one gets to Keflavík Airport, the more anger one hears at the presence of Americans in Iceland. This is no surprise given the fact that Keflavík, the largest airport in Iceland, is the nerve-centre of the never-ending American presence in the country.\n\nNo matter what might be said about protecting diplomacy and promoting relations between free countries, to people that have to deal directly with the Americans at Keflavík or any other place they have occupied it is often a terrible nuisance at best. The Americans are at best patronizing and at worst straight-out oppressive.\n\nFor now, it is tolerable—but it is anyone's guess how long that tolerance will last as tensions slowly rise."

 ## Proxy
 fopo_name_tab_131: "1971 Icelandic Elections"
    ICELANDPROXY_Explainer_tt: "The §Y1971 Icelandic General Elections§! are driven by the nation's relationship with the §DOFN§! in the wake of their murder of a student activist and its subsequent cover up. While §Eanti-OFN sentiment§! had been brewing on the island since its entry to the alliance, the §DOFN§!'s abuses on the island have caused many to bring in to question §MIceland§!'s position on the global stage.\n§MIceland§!'s major parties have made their stance on the §DOFN§! a primary issue of this election, leaving the fate of §MIceland§! in the hands of the coalition that will govern the Althing.\n\nEvery §Lmedia cycle§! we will air our message to the people of §MIceland§!, our rhetoric will consist of §Y3§! values.\n\n§iReputation§! will influence our ability to court §dIndependents§!. This will especially be useful towards the end of the campaign as in the event that our side does not have a governing majority, we will rely on §dIndependents§! to help form a governing body.\n\n§PTone§! of the campaign will influence both the effectiveness of our message. If we remain positive, we may influence voters off of good will alone, however if our §Oopponents§! are negative we will not be able to defend ourselves, this of course works both ways. If the campaign is dragged to the gutter with both sides running negative attacks, very little progress will be made that cycle. If we run too many negative attacks then our reputation will be severely hindered and we will begin to lose support.\n\n§gAppeal§! of our campaign determines if we will attempt to win over §dIndependents§! or attempt to undermine the base of our §Oopponents§! by converting them to §dindependents§!. We may also go for a broad message which can achieve the goals of both options at a noticeably smaller rate.\n\nAlthough we may run our campaign without considering our §Oopponent§!'s, if we would are to get a leg up we can work to §Eroute their campaign§! and receive advanced information of their plans to adjust our plans for the cycle accordingly. If we are to rely on this strategy we must remain aware of the potential that our ties to the campaign may be §Rexposed§! and §ediscredit our side§!."

 # Iceland Events
  ICE.skeleton.3.t: "Swelling"
  ICE.skeleton.3.d: "It started, like all these things do, with the little things. Some Icelandic teenagers, their rebelliousness getting the better of them, flashed a Nazi salute at some American troops on patrol. An American tells his buddies what he wants to do to a beautiful Icelandic woman as she passes by; the woman can do nothing but pull her coat around her and avert her gaze. A few student radicals gather outside American bases and offices each day, chanting their slogans. All this, though unpleasant, was to be expected. All this was normal.\n\nBut, of course, normality can only last for so long before it starts to wear thin. And with each passing year, the Americans grow more arrogant, the protestors become more numerous, and, perhaps, in the depths of their minds, the salutes of the teenagers become something more than mere rebellion.\n\nThere's a fire burning, under the veneer of normality that is Iceland. No matter how both sides try to ignore it, it's there. And, like the volcanoes that make up the land of the country itself, no one is really prepared for the eruption."
  ICE.skeleton.3.a: "It all comes to a head."

  ICE.skeleton.4.t: "Thanksgiving Murder"
  ICE.skeleton.4.d: "Olaf sat back in the office of the Reykjavik Gazette, eyeing the pretty young woman sitting cross-legged in front of him. She was trying- and clearly failing- to keep the makeup running down her face from being too noticeable. Olaf made a mental note to emphasize that in his article- always helped with the sympathy. "So, Sigrid," he said, leaning forwards. "Just to review..."\n\n"We were at the bar, a few nights ago," she said, an imposed steadiness to her voice. "Me, my boyfriend Arni, and his friend Sven. It was a normal night, we were just talking and laughing. But then these four Americans came up. They'd obviously had too much to drink. Probably from Thanksgiving. One of them couldn't keep his eyes off me. He wouldn't take no for an answer. You know how it is. I tried to move away, and he..."\n\nShe swallowed, wiping her eyes. "Arni... he tried to get us out of there. But Sven wasn't having it. He threw a punch, and they were on him, and- and- and Arni put himself in front of me. And one of them punched him, and he went down. And they just kept... stomping. He was yelling at first, then he was whimpering. But it was the silence that I'll never forget. And when they were done, they just... left. Without a word." All the time she spoke to him, she never looked away.\n\nOlaf, when he realized she was done, nodded. "Right. Well, thank you for your courage in telling your story. This paper will do all it can to achieve justice." She rose with a nod. Olaf grinned as the door closed behind her. There had been tensions building for a while, but the murder of a local... if the Gazette broke this story, it would put his paper's name on the map. Olaf turned to his typewriter and got to work."
  ICE.skeleton.4.a: "Lust and greed."

  ICE.skeleton.5.t: "Riots in Reykjavík"
  ICE.skeleton.5.d: "By the time the White House received the message from the U.S. Embassy in Iceland - 'there's a problem' - the riots had already gathered in force in front of the Althing and the Embassy itself, bearing a copy of the day's Morgunblaðið with a damning headline:\n\n"AMERICANS DEMAND CLOSURE OF MURDER CASE INVOLVING OFN SOLDIERS"\n\nThe notes taken in an in-confidence meeting between the Icelandic government and the American ambassador had been printed in full, with the prosaic details of the various 'incentives' Washington was prepared to offer - if this 'little matter' could be resolved. What was worse was the revelation that it was too late to do anything - the prisoners, two airmen arrested for running over a child while drunk, had already been remanded to American MPs.\n\nHelplessness and humiliation quickly morphed into indignation and irascibility, and the populace of Reykjavík vented their frustrations en masse. The Althing went into an unscheduled recess as politicians huddled in interior rooms, away from smashed windows and the roar of the crowd. The street in front of the American embassy had turned into a debris field, littered with the husks of burnt-out cars and spent projectiles.\n\nWhile the violence subsided in the days after, the protest marches - and manifestos - continued daily. Organized under the banner of leftists, nationalists, students, and pensioners alike, Iceland's society found common cause in their disgust with America - and with the OFN writ whole."
  ICE.skeleton.5.a: "A coverup as bad as the crime."

  ICE.skeleton.6.t: "Paralyzed"
  ICE.skeleton.6.d: "The crowds gathering at the security cordon surrounding Keflavik Airbase grew larger every hour, forming a wave that crashed against the barrier of American MPs with a rhythmic, pulsing beat. From the air traffic control tower, the Air Force technicians could clearly make out the protest banners and slogans carried by the protestors, separated from their building by a thin patch of ragged tundra: "NO OFN, NO PEACE."\n\nThe protests themselves were a regular occurrence, but every MP stationed at the Icelandic base prayed that their tour of duty would end without incident. The crowds had been growing larger for months - riding a wave of momentum that showed no signs of cresting, with the government doing little to stop them. Maybe that was the point - it might have been impolite for Reykjavík to say so directly, but the voices of the people surely would be heard.\n\nRocks flew, forcing the MPs to take cover under battered shields. A few MPs screamed, their shields clattering to the ground as they cradled their heads from a projectile that struck home. A whistle blew out from within the crowd, a thin keening that was then taken up across the protest line as the protestors surged forth, seeking a chink in the MPs' lines.\n\nOn cue, the row of armed officers behind the frontline raised their grenade launchers, firing teargas grenades behind the melee. Several trucks - repurposed from fire trucks at the base itself - turned their hoses on the demonstrators, pushing them back into the clouds of billowing tear smoke.\n\nThe airmen in the tower breathed a sigh of relief as the protestors fell back. They wouldn't have to destroy their own equipment and burn documents today - but nobody knew if that would hold true forever."
  ICE.skeleton.6.a: "Iceland's people seethe with smoldering fire."

  ICE.skeleton.7.t: "Stirring the Pot"
  ICE.skeleton.7.d: "The election of [ICE.GetLeader] to lead Iceland was already bad news for Washington, but [USA.GetLeader] had hoped they'd find a peaceful way to resolve the political impasse in Reykjavík.\n\nInstead, they were making things worse - deliberately.\n\nNight after night, protesters took up positions outside the U.S. Embassy and the perimeter of Reykjavík Airbase, chanting familiar slogans that denounced the American and OFN control over their country's affairs. The police - which had used to keep a respectful cordon around the American facilities - had shrunk back, the space allotted to the protesters growing until they pressed up against the gates of both facilities.\n\n[ICE.GetLeader] had taken to the airwaves every week, noting that the negotiations with the OFN were progressing, slowly - but that Iceland was willing to wait until its demands, the demands of its people, were heard. The OFN, they said, had no right dictating terms to Iceland like Germany dictated terms to its Reichskommissariats, and until the OFN understood this there could be no productive basis for further negotiations.\n\nThat was all well and fine, and the media lapped it up. For the State Department, however, there was only one conclusion to be had:"
  ICE.skeleton.7.a: "The government was egging the mob on."

  ICE.skeleton.8.t: "The Icelandic Domino Teeters"
  ICE.skeleton.8.d: ""The Icelandic government's collapsed, sir."\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] took a moment to digest the news in the daily briefing, followed by a long, labored sigh. For a country of its size, Iceland had been on everyone's mind for weeks, as images of burning cars and debris in the streets captured the imagination of OFN capitals from Washington to Canberra.\n\nNobody had expected the Icelandic government to stay in power much longer. All that mattered now was managing the fallout.\n\nA caretaker government, even if led by the previous Prime Minister, would have no authority to meaningfully govern Iceland and its critical military contribution in the North Sea - and might even lead to protests threatening the safety of Keflavik Airbase. Even if America called for calm, it might not work - it might even backfire, throwing more fuel on the fire.\n\nAmerica was caught in a contradictory bind - the most powerful state in the OFN, unable to exercise its power in Iceland for fear of worsening the situation. It was a prospect that sat unwell with almost everyone in Washington, even as [USA.GetLeader] set to work with the minimal official tools he had."
  ICE.skeleton.8.a: "Maybe Canada or Australia will sway them?"

  ICE.skeleton.9.t: "Rekindling"
  ICE.skeleton.9.d: "When Christmas came, Iceland retreated into its homes and hearths to celebrate the coming of a new year. Another year of trouble and tribulation had come to an end, and they could take a moment to rest ahead of the year to come.\n\nThe Americans, after all, had the thankless task of standing watch against the Germans - and if that was their lot in life, it was surely well deserved when they were occupying foreign soil.\n\nDays passed, and when [GetYear] dawned, the students left their homes and returned to the streets, passing by the classrooms without a glance. There were more important things to do than study history or mathematics - there was a battle for the soul of Iceland, and it was theirs to fight.\n\nBut while the diplomats at the American embassy braced themselves for another year of protests and riots, they studiously reviewed the newspapers and gossip sheets, searching for any advantage in the fight that mattered most: the upcoming elections in the Althing.\n\nThe students knew this too, and soon the streets were plastered on posters and slogans praising and slandering the OFN and Iceland in turn."
  ICE.skeleton.9.a: "[GetYear] would be a pivotal year for Iceland - and the world."

  ICE.skeleton.10.t: "Icelandic Campaign Season Begins"
  ICE.skeleton.10.d: "Even as the posters and propaganda had blanketed Reykjavík for months, the official start of the Althing election of [GetYear] was met with a grim, knowing resolve in the State Department.\n\nEver since Iceland had erupted in anti-OFN protests, policymakers in both Washington and Germania knew that a turning point was coming to the North Atlantic. With Iceland's future in the OFN consuming all the political oxygen on the island, the election campaign had become an effective referendum on the OFN - a vote that America could not afford to lose.\n\nEven if Iceland was not going to break away from the OFN entirely - Iceland had no love for the Nazis - a chink in the OFN's armor was a victory for Germania anyway, on the doorstep of Germany's European fortress. Even if politics was a game of nuanced ambiguities, geopolitics was zero-sum competition - and Iceland was now center stage in the Cold War.\n\nThere would be speeches. There would be meetings. There might even be a couple of 'charitable' campaign contributions. It would all be worth it in the end - or so the Americans told themselves."
  ICE.skeleton.10.a: "Defeat is not an option."

  ICE.skeleton.11.t: "Icelandic Campaign Season Begins"
  ICE.skeleton.11.d: "Even as the posters and propaganda had blanketed Reykjavík for months, the official start of the Althing election of [GetYear] was met with a grim, knowing resolve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nEver since Iceland had erupted in anti-OFN protests, policymakers in both Washington and Germania knew that a turning point was coming to the North Atlantic. With Iceland's future in the OFN consuming all the political oxygen on the island, the election campaign had become an effective referendum on the OFN - a vote that Germania knew was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nEven if Iceland was not going to break away from the OFN entirely - the OFN would never let Iceland go entirely - a chink in the OFN's armor was victory enough for Germania, opening up crucial breathing room on Europe's maritime doorstep. Even if politics was a game of nuanced ambiguities, geopolitics was zero-sum competition - and Iceland was now center stage in the Cold War.\n\nThere would be clandestine meetings. There would be agent provocateurs. There might even be a couple of 'local' campaign contributions, even if the recipients were socialists of the worst kind that would not be tolerated elsewhere in Europe. If they helped expose the OFN from within, then it was a price worth paying."
  ICE.skeleton.11.a: "We will not let this opportunity go."

  ICE.skeleton.12.t: "Anti-OFN Government Wins in Iceland"
  ICE.skeleton.12.d: "When the election results were announced in Iceland, the plaza outside the Althing exploded in dazzling color and incandescent cheer.\n\nPride, exuberance, jubilation - all could be seen on the faces of the protesters and activists that had gathered to celebrate their moment of triumph. There was hardly any showing from the other camp - and they were right to have stayed home, for their views were hardly welcome in the new political reality of Iceland.\n\nThe people had spoken, and the OFN was no longer welcome in Iceland.\n\nThe new government's inaugural press conference, broadcast to the entire island as dawn broke, spoke about the desire to maintain 'good' ties with America and the OFN. But they insisted that Iceland would be equal - and that Iceland would never countenance being a military fiefdom of Washington, a dumping yard for their worn-out toys and washed-up GIs. The American ambassador had been summoned, they said, and soon the divorce from the OFN would begin.\n\nWhile the crowds milled about in Althing Square, still savoring the taste of their unexpected victory in the spotlight of the world, a few began to question what came next.

  ICE.flavor.1.t: "Frelsisgöngu [GetYear]"
  ICE.flavor.1.d: "It's six in the morning, and a crowd gathers at Klambratún, Reykjavík's largest and newest public park. Three hundred huddle in the morning darkness, chanting and singing to warm their spirits. They carry placards, candles and pleas for a different world, one where they are not burning under the torch of the OFN. Organisers recite speeches over loudhailers, congratulating the patriots of Iceland for standing up to foreign interference. It is the yearly protest against the foreign bases, what the locals have come to call the Frelsisgöngu: the Freedom March.\n\nFrom Klambratún they walk west along Route 49. People watching on the sidewalk say nothing to them. Some join in, others let them pass by. At the four-way they turn south along Route 40, follow until it merges with Route 41 in Hafnarfjörður. Someone screams 'Nazi-loving scum' at them from a lightless house. Then begins the long stretch, approximately 35 kilometres of road between them and their destination. Organisers pass on words of encouragement and bottles of water to the marching crowd. A British exile walks beside them, photographing the year's march. The craggy rocks of rural Iceland remind him of the surface of Mars.\n\nIt's six in the evening, and the Frelsisgöngu reaches Keflavik Airport. By now their numbers have broken five hundred, having collected stragglers and observers on the long march from Reykjavík. If the journey tired them, they don't show it; their chants grow louder and fiercer when they see the airport, and the MPs in riot gear stationed to halt the advance. "Americans, Leave!" "OFN Is The Enemy Of Peace!" "No War For Iceland!" It is a disparate chanting, a cacophonous expression of dissatisfaction, and it shall come every year so long as there are a few hundred Icelanders who balk at the presence of American guns in their land."
  ICE.flavor.1.a: "America comforts itself knowing it is simply a loud minority."

  ICE.flavor.2.t: "The Ripple Effect"
  ICE.flavor.2.d: "Eldon Knarrarson warms himself with a flask of tea, jealously eyeing the American military base across the road from the office. Through the rain-soaked window he can see the lights on and the silhouettes of soldiers in their mess halls, cold bottles of beer consumed in abundance. He'd tried the stuff before, didn't like it - leave that swill to the Danes, he thought - but he always resented the Americans for being able to flout the prohibitions established by their nation.\n\n"Shit," mutters his deskmate, who puts down his phone. "There goes another one."\n\n"Uruguay?"\n\n"No," says Lyngar Damonsson, "Argentina. Apparently our aluminium's too much for them these days." He sighs. "I think we have to call America, see what price they'll offer." Eldon frowned and screwed the cap on his flask; Lyngar stroked his fingers along his balding scalp. "Fucking Yasuda."\n\nThat was the new phrase on everyone's lips, a phrase which had superceded the more ubiquitous "fucking Americans" in Iceland. Though it had no direct links with the Co-Prosperity Sphere, Iceland's export-focused trade policies saw many of its goods directed towards the Americas. South America was, in their eyes, a better partner than their northern brethren: they paid better, they wanted more and they had connections to other markets. Perhaps they had too many connections, for the economic crisis in Japan was forcing the nations of South America to downsize their foreign trade - and Iceland, a minor aluminium producer and fishmonger, was among the first nations to have their exports re-evaluated.\n\nEldon looked back at the army base next door. An American soldier had opened the window, holding a bottle of beer in his hand. He drank half of it, and poured the other half on the ground, just before the threshold of a dry land."

  ICE.flavor.3.t: "Feeding The Multitude"
  ICE.flavor.3.d: "The fishing boats of Iceland set out in the early morning and returned with the water's great bounty. Hundreds of cod are lifted up from the ocean depths and brought to land, where they are collected and processed by fisheries. For the Icelandic diet, haddock and flatfish are common staples, but the waters around their island are so blessed with life that there is always a surplus on the Icelandic market.\n\nBut where to sell them? Foreign bases remind Iceland of their embargoes against mainland Europe and Asia, where cod might sell for more than cents on the dollar. The only markets available to them are in the Americas and, where permitted, the Mediterranean - both regions of the world with competitive fishing industries with whom Iceland cannot compete. No amount of creative advertising can carve a greater niche for local fisheries in foreign markets.\n\nIn Grindavik, a southern coastal town, six fishing boats rise early and travel south for the daily catch. There used to be more, and there might be more still, if fishing was more profitable. But when they return, nets laden with squirming haddock and halibut, the revenue is barely enough to cover operating costs. One captain takes a look at the paltry earnings he's earned from the day's catch and figures it would be easier - and more profitable - to sell the boat instead of sailing on it the next day. Another looks across the Atlantic and pictures an entire continent where his day's catch might be worth ten times its current value - if only they were not separated by a US Navy blockade."
  ICE.flavor.3.a: "And as a result, the fisheries often breed anti-OFN sentiment."

  ICE.flavor.4.t: "Frelsisgöngu [GetYear]"
  ICE.flavor.4.d: "It's six in the morning, and a crowd gathers at Klambratún, Reykjavík's largest public park. Before they've even set off on the next Frelsisgöngu, the crowd has reached over a thousand people, and threatens to swell up even more once they begin their march. As the years pass by, as the frozen tensions between America and Germany begin to thaw, as woe after woe befalls an already weakened Icelandic economy, the Frelsisgöngu grows a little bigger. By now, it's reaching a peak that its organisers could only dream about a few years ago.\n\nThe marches are a bit more organised now. Gone are the days of independent chanting; now there are coordinated calls and responses, representatives from the People's Alliance and more local anti-OFN groups giving words to a people's frustration over foreign occupation. There's drums and megaphones and banners proudly waving over the march as they make the long march from Reykjavík to Keflavik Airport.\n\nBefore they can leave the city, however, they are met with an equally-unique sight: a smaller, but fierce counter-protest. Their line is simple and vitriolic: the Frelsisgöngu is fascist apologia masquerading as anti-imperialism, a pathetic display of weakness against a totalitarian threat. They try to surround them, but their ranks are thin and easily broken; the Frelsisgöngu absorbs it all in stride and continues the march down to the airport.\n\nBecause they don't care. The German eagle has stood atop Europe for over twenty years now, approaching thirty. Iceland has been forcibly separated from the rest of the continent, and for what? Army bases with lecherous, angry, bored soldiers lording it over the locals? Economic ties with a continent that holds little interest in Iceland's exports? As the years pass by, more of its citizens imagine the OFN's presence as not the warming fire of liberty, but chains weighing down the nation."

This move after the island's chaotic Reykjavik Riots, a rallying of anti-OFN sentiment following the death of an innocent child at the hands of American soldiers, a sentiment which culminated in the recent elections.\n\nThe current predicament of the island is somewhat complicated; while the Americans will still be obligated to the defense of Iceland in the case of invasion, and will be maintaining some bases on the island, Iceland holds no obligations to the OFN, and has no need to provide military support to the rest of the OFN in any case. This unprecedented loss for the OFN has led to a renewed call of anti-OFN sentiment across the North Atlantic. Sources say Germany couldn't be happier.\n"

But no grandiloquent designation of 'pater patriae' is needed to make clear that the young Reverend Jonathan Motzfeldt is a man with a rich background.\n\nFar in the north, while wars raged and the old order fell apart, Motzfeldt finished his education at the teachers' school in Ilinniarfissuaq. Then he went south to Canada, to study theology and receive pastoral ordination—and there he saw not merely the Word of God but something more worldly: the political world that Greenland sorely lacked.\n\nWorking with Moses Olsen and Lars Emil-Johansen, the Siumut party successfully promoted home rule for Greenland—a pipe-dream a mere decade ago. The first elections brought victory for the Siumut, and the promise of a humane democratic socialism with greater autonomy for Greenland and increased US support for the arctic island.\n\nThere may be difficulties, and Motzfeldt must take heed to his own big personality lest he sideline other vital figures in Siumut—but as it stands, Greenland is free, and shall remain so, no matter what others might have to say about it."

Today, however, with Denmark gone and Iceland moving on, it is the reality that Greenland's people face.\n\nWith it comes a youthful, somewhat fractious two-party politics: democratic socialist, regionalist Siumut cadres debate their more conservative, pro-OFN Atassut compatriots. Everything is subject to debate now, and the Greenlandic population is dizzied by the impact of hitherto unseen freedom and liberty.

The snow would come year after year, disrupt people's lives, and reduce their standard of living; the fact that Greenland was ruled first from Copenhagen then from Reykjavik made things even worse.\n\nNow, however, Greenland is master in its own house, and the departure of Iceland from the Organization of Free Nations makes it the rebound target for Western investment. Though things remain difficult, the influx of foreign funds has made the long winters that much more tolerable."
 GRN_the_arctic_puzzle_piece: "The Arctic Puzzle Piece"

These days even the old Viking explorers and the contemporaneous indigenous peoples against whom they fought for control would be surprised at the value foreigners place on the land Erik the Red called 'Greenland'.\n\nThe reason for this sudden focus on Kalaallit Nunaat is simple: the Thule Base is all-important to the OFN if it wishes to maintain control over the North Atlantic and especially the Arctic. Therefore, with Iceland out of the picture, the OFN has begun to flood funds and personnel into Greenland with a twofold purpose: to maintain Greenlandic loyalty and to ensure the safety of Thule."

  US_Greenland.1.t: "A Horrible Anomaly"
  US_Greenland.1.d: "To Derek Bronson, the day he heard he would be assigned to Greenland was the day his hopes withered. The day he actually got there, they died. Derek did always have a flair for the melodramatic, though, and figured he ought to give the frozen, barren, isolated, horrid island a chance, and he was glad he did. It didn't take long to realize the island was closer to home than he thought, difficult as it was in the frigid, relentless cold. Walking down to the small town adjacent to the airfield was something of an exercise that Derek had grown used to, and he never minded the walk- there had always been a certain appeal in the military equipment he'd been provided; the extreme cold gear was certainly among the more comfortable pieces of clothing which he'd worn in service, and the leather Extreme Cold Weather mask had its own way of growing on those who used it, even if it gave off a distinctly "serial killer" look to it. Walking into the town's restaurant, Derek could for a moment imagine that he was back home in Illinois, and it wasn't very hard. The town was founded on the backs of American families whose husbands and fathers were stationed in Greenland, and the town was built on the American values which everyone there had been protecting- and it wasn't just the case in the airfield's town. Even the biggest cities like "Nuuk" had grown a certain American flair from when Derek had occasionally had the opportunity to visit them. While reflecting on this, Carlos, a fellow soldier, sat down at the table, opposite Derek with a half-smile, concern clearly on his face. After exchanging greetings and pleasantries, Carlos had a somber look grow across his face.\n\n"Derek, have you heard about Jerry?" Derek responded by shaking his head. "He... He locked himself inside his bunk for a solid day, nobody saw anything of him until he was in the emergency room. You fuckin' believe that?" Carlos asked.\n\n"God, man." Derek murmured, feeling sick to his stomach. He pushed his cup of coffee aside. "But that's Greenland, man. Fuck, first Calhoun, now this?""

  US_Greenland.2.d: "Lars' first registered thought of the day was that he would be thrilled when it was over. His second thought was that he would have nothing to eat for breakfast, and so with that, Lars set out for the day. Living on the outskirts of Nuuk, Lars had always found difficulty getting into his work at the other edge of the city, and things were not getting easier. For as long as he could remember, American troops had been pouring into Greenland, and contrary to what one would think, this had only made things more difficult for Lars and his family. Houses along the coast -where Lars worked- were all snatched up by American families moving in, and the only place affordable to Lars' family was a 6-room hovel on the outskirts of the city. Lars normally would not mind, had the walk not been constantly pockmarked by freezing beggars with lost hands and feet, not to mention the constant threat of snow and hail.\n\nFinally making his way to the docks, Lars lit up a cigarette and dressed up in the everyday garb of a fisherman- a haphazard amalgamation of borrowed-turned-bought coats sewn together into one Frankenstein's monster of clothing, hanging over mangy undershirts and suspenders that had long since lost the notion of "cleanliness". His fishing vessel was close to finishing the last preparations for setting off to sea by the time Lars got there, and while most men had already been there for some time, they nonetheless welcomed Lars, late as he was; he was the only one among them who still lived with his parents so far from the dock, and none of the men minded the extra work.\n\n"Lars!" One of the men shouted, "Get your ass in here! Don't want you left behind!"\n\nLars smiled, and jogged down to the pier. It was only on the Atlantic that he felt safe, free from the bonds of Greenland, of America. As Nuuk grew fuzzy, fading into the distance, Lars was free.

While a supply run to Greenland would often be relegated to the back page of most copies, Bernard didn't mind- again, peace came with a hint of isolation. As their ship came to dock in Nuuk, that notion of peace began to fade in the chest of the lone reporter.\n\n"Sweet Mary, mother of..." he murmured, and it took a moment for the soldier adjacent to him to notice what they were both staring at.\n\n"My God...

Right, sometime last month one of the residential sectors burnt down- not that it made much of a difference.

Pseudo-Colony? That in and of itself highlighted the problem. It wasn't as though Greenland was an empty plot of land - there were people there, even if there weren't many of them.\n\nAt the same time, things weren't exactly codified, and the people really hadn't had a choice in permitting the American presence not. All the same, that, in Sullivan's view, made Greenland their responsibility - a sentiment which also applied to some members of the press who'd turned attention to it.\n\nThe New York Times, and a few smaller papers, had run several stories on the state of American management of Greenland, and it wasn't flattering. Apathy, incompetence, and mismanagement were highlighted in embarrassing detail, with the country's questionable relevance and high unemployment only worsening the picture.\n\nThus, he'd been tasked with addressing the concerns.\n\nThe good news was that it wasn't difficult to determine some solutions. Fishing was the only industry that was established enough to alleviate some of the issues, which would suffice. He planned to propose a large expansion of that industry to not only ease unemployment, but also make it more relevant to American interests beyond a glorified military base.\n\nAt the same time, the numbers were very clear - this wouldn't bear fruit for years to come, and it required a sustained American investment. The most immediate impact was going to be assuaging concerns that the United States was doing something positive for the country - and for now, that had to be enough."

As much as he enjoyed his time here, he couldn't deny a longing to return to the island he and his fiancee Elisa called home. The feeling had only intensified in recent months.\n\nIt had never sat right with him what his home had become. It was little more than a military base for the Americans at best, and a dumping ground at worst. It was a strategic piece of land for them, and the people who'd been living there were just in the way. They hadn't even bothered to treat them as a colony, or even a territory.\n\nIt was an occupation, He'd become more comfortable using that terminology over the course of his studies. Iceland and Greenland were similar in that regard - though one had their nominal independence, and his homeland did not.\n\nDid it have to be that way? He didn't think so.\n\nThe natives of Greenland were hardly a movement or political force - but then again, had they ever tried to be? If such a force emerged, would the Americans be so confident in occupying Greenland without consequence?

  US_Greenland.8.d: "The political scene in Canada was far more interesting than Jonathan Motzfeldt would have expected before coming for his studies. He suspected that few would have thought that a man studying theology would take an interest in the political matters of the day, especially as a visitor from Greenland. In that regard, he was somewhat unique.\n\nSometimes for better, or for worse depending on who asked.\n\nIn between his theological studies, he'd spent a good amount of time learning what he could about the Québécois and their struggle for independence. Every Canadian had an opinion on Quebec, and he'd learned the hard way that it could become contentious very quickly. All the same, he couldn't help but resonate with their goals, as he saw parallels with his own homeland.\n\nQuebec was seen as an integral part of Canada, and while Greenland didn't have the same importance to the United States, they were effectively an unofficial territory. Was it possible that one day they would be their own nation despite this? No doubt the Québécois wondered the same thing, and even though their situation was more difficult, they were still trying.\n\nIt inspired him enough to renew the fight. He knew that Greenland would never receive independence until the issue was forced. They just needed people to start demanding it. No one really filled that role now, but he knew supporters existed. Once he finished his studies here, he resolved to pursue this.\n\nHe saw a future where Greenland was free of foreign control. If his experiences in Canada had shown him anything, it was that it was going to be a long and difficult road, but nothing worth doing was ever easy."
  US_Greenland.8.a: "They just had to push forward."

  US_Greenland.9.t: "A Wedding in Sisimiut"
  US_Greenland.9.d: "Moses Olsen had been waiting for this day for a very long time. Weddings were always stressful affairs, but despite all of the difficulty, frustration, and tiny mistakes, it all melted away when he saw the woman he was to marry being escorted down the aisle, while their family and friends watched on with smiles on their faces.\n\nHis life-long friend, Jonathan Motzfeldt smiled at both of them, having just completed his religious education and Canada, and returned a fully-ordained priest. He had been adamant that his friend would be the one to marry them, even if it had meant a delay on their marriage. A decision he was glad he had made.\n\nMotzfeldt began the ceremony proper, reading through the liturgy, and giving a short sermon where he shared a few short humorous anecdotes from their friendship. Then they finally reached the vows.\n\nBoth of them had wondered what it would be like to reach this moment; they'd imagined their lines over in their head hundreds of times before, but it was different to now speak them, and publicly pledge themselves to each other. When they were finished, hands held, and rings exchanged, Motzfeldt smiled. "I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride."\n\nTo the applause and cheers of those in attendance, the newly wed Moses and Elisa Olsen kissed and exited the isle to what would be an evening of food, dance, and celebration. Each of them knew what the days ahead had in store. Since Moses had returned home, they were both committed to working towards a better future for their homeland.\n\nTheir days would be spent working towards a future independence, one certainly difficult goal. But those were worries and goals for another day. Right here, right now, they had each other, and that was more than enough."
  US_Greenland.9.a: "Congrats to the newlyweds!"

  US_Greenland.10.t: "To Stop the Spiral"
  US_Greenland.10.d: "In the best of circumstances the Greenland Provincial Council was treated as a formality. The United States had appropriated the existing Danish colonial structure when they'd taken over the territory and combined the two existing councils, introducing elections in the process. Purportedly, this council was responsible for administering Greenland, and providing the Greenlanders some representation.\n\nThe reality was less glamorous.\n\nFormally, the Provincial Council had actual power. It was the singular legal and legislative organ in Greenland that was acknowledged by the United States, but historically had mostly been used to provide basic administrative services and rubber stamp anything that was "requested" from American civil or military officials.\n\nHowever, they were looking to change things. Many saw Greenland's standard of living spiraling downwards, especially for native Greenlanders, and resolved to take action. There were a number of gaping issues in Greenland, from the abysmal state of education, to severe inequality between American guest workers and native Greenlanders.\n\nFor the first time since their founding, the Provincial Council met not to conduct formal, ceremonially, useless meetings - but to actually exercise their authority in a tangible way. They weren't certain to the degree they could address the issues - but it was worth trying. There was some initial excitement - which was swiftly crushed.\n\nThe moment that the United States had heard what the Council was attempting to do, a slew of people representing American interests within Greenland began pushing back - who didn't hesitate leveraging their economic stranglehold over the territory. Even the minor reforms proposed were soon abandoned by the Council, as it was clear the Americans opposed them."
  US_Greenland.10.a: "They'd tried, and that was the best they could do right now."

  US_Greenland.11.t: "The Only Ones Who Matter"
  US_Greenland.11.d: "Working within the Greenlandic Education system was a depressing experience, no matter how one cut it. Lars Chemnitz often felt like he was screaming into the void. One would think that being the School Inspector of Illulissat - the third largest city in Greenland! - would give his word some weight. Yet no matter how many reports he wrote, no matter how much he highlighted the abysmal state of Greenland's education...\n\nIt always seemed it was for nothing.\n\nIt wasn't as though people didn't care - some members of the Provincial Council had expressed their thanks for the work he'd done, and had pointed the finger squarely at the problem. A problem which was obvious to anyone paying attention.\n\nIt was why he'd perked up when he'd read the news that the Provincial Council had actually tried taking steps to fix the problems facing Greenland, which had lasted until news of their failure followed. Officially, it was because they 'Lacked the necessary support for reform.' He found the wordplay clever.\n\nIt wasn't that there wasn't public or popular support. Oh no, everyone in Greenland knew reform was desperately needed, but they didn't have support from the only one who mattered - the Americans. The Americans had likely pressured them to drop the attempts, and the Council had complied.\n\nIt frustrated him. Even from a pragmatic standpoint there was nothing to lose from supporting Greenland. He had to imagine that the United States simply wasn't aware of what their interests here were doing. If there was ever a time to give Greenland some leeway - it was now.\n\nHe hoped the United States would reconsider their policy, otherwise he feared things were only going to worsen."
  US_Greenland.11.a: "The Americans could be better than this."

  US_Greenland.12.t: "The Thule Accident"
  US_Greenland.12.d: "MEMORANDUM ON THULE AIR BASE ACCIDENT\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: On the 21st of January, 1968, the Thule Air Base reported that pilots flying a B-52 bomber as part of Operation CHROME DOME (an ongoing air operation to deter a German or Japanese first strike) were forced to evacuate the bomber.\n\nAs mandated by CHROME DOME, all Stratofortress bombers are armed with nuclear bombs, and the pilots were unable to attempt safety measures to mitigate risks before ground collision. The Stratofortress crashed a short distance from Thule Air Base, and low levels of radiation have been confirmed, likely caused by explosions from conventional munitions. There is confirmation that none of the four nuclear bombs on board detonated.\n\nAll of the pilots survived and are in recovery. Thule Air Base teams are currently assessing damage, degree of local contamination, and environmental impact. We expect it will be several weeks before results are published.\n\nIMPACT: This incident has already received widespread media attention. There is significant outrage from the native Greenland population, who have condemned both the United States and the Organization of Free Nations for what they perceive as a gross mishandling of the situation, and called for stricter regulations, or a cessation of CHROME DOME entirely.\n\nGermany has released a statement condemning the 'irresponsibility' of the United States and OFN, and similarly echoed calls to end the deterrence operation. While the actual damage is minimal, this has attracted negative international attention. The 'Thule Accident' has already been coined in reference to this incident, and we assess that both the US and OFN have taken a minor reputational hit."
  US_Greenland.12.a: "At least the damage was minimal."

  US_Greenland.13.t: "A Future of Independence"
  US_Greenland.13.d: "The danger might have passed, but Lars Emil-Johansen still freshly remembered the initial fear, then outrage when the first details of the Thule Accident had emerged. Yes, as the experts had said, it could have been much worse - but no one seemed to want to acknowledge the problem was American nuclear weapons on Greenland in the first place.\n\nIt was this sentiment, or which he would call anger, that had brought him to this lecture today.\n\nHe may have been studying to be a teacher at Ilinniarfissuag, the 'Great Learning Place,' which constituted Greenland's primary teaching college, but he had heard a little about the two men who'd appeared to hold a surprise lecture, and was intrigued. Moses Olsen and Jonathan Motzfeldt were rumored to be doing something unprecedented - calling for autonomy.\n\nHe wasn't the only one who was interested, if the packed lecture hall was any indication. After some greetings and pleasantries, the two men began to speak. It was a conversation on what their future could be - not as an American colony, but a true, independent nation. Both men made passionate arguments, painting a vivid future that captivated Emil-Johansen, and many in the crowd.\n\nAfter the lecture, both men took some time to speak with students, Lars among them. They said that they were part of an organization that intended to pursue exactly what they had called about. It was called Siumut, a new, and loosely-organized, and the first of it's kind. Emil-Johansen knew his next year would be occupied with schooling - but he resolved to keep an eye on this movement the two men were part of."
  US_Greenland.13.a: "He saw a future he wanted to be part of."

  US_Greenland.14.t: "A Step Towards Autonomy"
  US_Greenland.14.d: "Lars Emil-Johansen knew that he was not exactly on the road he had started out on. After graduation, most expected that he would begin his teaching career. Instead, he was at the Upernaviarsuk Research Station, where everything was going to change.\n\nHe'd kept tabs on both Johnathan Motzfeldt and Mosus Olsen's Siumut Movement, and after graduation, reached out to them. They'd enthusiastically responded, and invited him to an upcoming congress where they said they would be taking a major step in the fight for Greenland's autonomy. They hadn't been exaggerating.\n\nTo the delight of the crowd in attendance, both men announced the Formation of the Political Party Siumut in Greenland - the first political part devoted to home rule. Olsen and Motzfeldt explained that the core tenants of the party would be Greenland's autonomy and freedom, and the implementation of a humane democratic socialism. They concluded with a call to everyone in attendance to join and help the movement succeed.\n\nA questionable, perhaps insane idea had formed in Emil-Johansen's mind as he'd listened to the outlined vision. There were going to be elections for the Greenland Provincial Council in the next year, and anyone could take part. So - why not him? He was educated, he was willing to fight, and he wanted to make a difference. Why not like this?\n\nAfter signing up, he decided to stand in front of the gathered crowd - and declared that he would run in the Council elections, and called on others to do so as well. It was met with cheers, approving applause, all to the clear delight of the two men who had begun this movement. Emil-Johansen beamed as he heard the cheers, and at that moment, it seemed certain that they would succeed."
  US_Greenland.14.a: "Independence was inevitable."

  US_Greenland.15.t: "The Greenland Provincial Council Elections of 1971"
  US_Greenland.15.d: "Across Greenland, thousands held their breath as the votes for the Greenland Provincial Council were tallied. The members of Siumut, including the Motzfeldt, Olsen, and Emil-Johansen were all gathered together, each nervously awaiting the results, as all three men had run for seats on the Council. Then finally, the results were announced.\n\nAll three men had been elected to the Provincial Council.\n\nThe gathered Siumut supporters erupted into raucous cheers and applause. The three men could scarcely believe their victory, one that was greater than they'd anticipated. Yet this reinforced that their cause was just, and that the people of Greenland were behind them. Excitement was spreading, as for the first time, many were imagining a truly free Greenland.\n\nElsewhere in Greenland, in a small modest home in Illulissat, Lars Chemnitz sat in his warm home, a mug of coffee in his hand, and the daily copy of Atuagagdliutit in the other. He was unable to hide his satisfaction, as he read the election results in Greenland's oldest newspaper. Along with other outsiders, he too had been elected to the Provincial Council.\n\nBetween himself, and the success of this new Siumut party, one thing was certain - the status quo the Americans had enjoyed for so long was ending. Greenland was making her own future, and Chemnitz was more confident than ever that it was going to be a bright one."
  US_Greenland.15.a: "A new era begins in Greenland."

  US_Greenland.16.t: "The Momentum Halted"
  US_Greenland.16.d: "When Siumut had swept the Provincial Council elections, there had been a surge of optimism and hope that independence could be achieved. There had been momentum that the Siumut triumvirate who'd taken power had hoped to ride and exploit.\n\nIceland had thrown a cold, wet blanket onto those hopes.\n\nEach of them couldn't help but feel frustration, and even mild contempt towards Iceland deciding to firmly stick with the OFN and United States. If Iceland had gone in a more radical direction, or even if they'd established a more equal relationship, they could have built off of that. An entrenchment of the status quo only made any change to their situation unlikely.\n\nDespite this outcome, they continued their work organizing. Greenland's independence might now be frozen for the foreseeable future, but it remained up to them to lay the groundwork when the time was right. No matter the setbacks, they were confident they would succeed in their struggle.\n\nNot everyone was displeased by this turn of events. Iceland's choices had ensured that the OFN was here to stay, and as time passed, more people began paying attention to the strongest voice of moderation - Lars Chemnitz. As he argued, the United States provided Greenland with security they couldn't maintain on their own, and instead of antagonizing their overlords, it was best for everyone to work with them.\n\nWhile many pursuing independence had no interest in such 'appeasement,' more and more were beginning to wonder if that was the better approach. As it stood, neither the United States or OFN were leaving anytime soon, and a stronger relationship was looking more appealing."
  US_Greenland.16.a: "Was there harm in a better relationship with the Americans?"

  US_Greenland.17.t: "A Growing Inevitability"
  US_Greenland.17.d: "After Siumut had swept the Provincial Council elections, there had been a wave of pro-independent sentiment throughout the population. The dreams and possibilities appeared vast for the first time in memory; a momentum had built that soared high. The more clear-minded knew it couldn't last forever, and scrambled to exploit the wave as long as possible.\n\nWhen news reached Greenland of the negotiations between Iceland and America around their treaties, and had rewritten them to be more fair and equal to Iceland, the momentum reached a crescendo as everyone saw clear, tangible proof that what they were striving for was possible.\n\nGreenlanders began joining pro-independent political parties, including Siumut and new ones which had sprung up in its wake. A political revolution unlike any that had existed before was taking place, and a true multi-party system was taking shape on the island. The Siumut youth wing exploded in popularity, and it wasn't long before it was among the most radical in their demands and intentions.\n\nThe hopes of the Greenlanders were vindicated further when the new Provincial Council announced that they had come to an agreement with American officials which would greatly improve the economy and living situation on the island.\n\nIn just a few months, things were looking up in a way they never had before. True independence remained somewhat distant, but everyone in Greenland knew that it was no longer something impossible.\n\nIn fact, many began to believe it was inevitable, and until that day came, all of them would continue striving towards it. If nothing else, there was one thing that was clear to both American and Greenlander:"
  US_Greenland.17.a: "They were entering into a new, brighter era."

  US_Greenland.18.t: "Ripples Through the Atlantic"
  US_Greenland.18.d: "Jacob frowned as he read the headline in the base's military newspaper. It had become routine for him to pick up the newspaper before his patrol, and normally there wasn't anything especially eye-catching. That was, until today. Even more so because it related to where he was stationed.\n\nUNITED STATES ORDERS COMMISSION ON GREENLAND AUTONOMY\n\nWhat?\n\nJacob was just an Army officer, but he hadn't been aware that this was actually something that could actually happen, let alone potentially going to. It only took him a minute to guess what had instigated this. Ever since Greenland autonomists had swept the Provincial Council elections, he knew America was watching them closely.\n\nIronically, it seemed like the trigger that had pushed them to take such an aggressive approach was not anything to do with the United States at all, but Iceland's recent decision to break from the OFN. As frustrating as that entire debacle had been, he'd not really thought there would be any actual impact beyond the OFN losing a strategic location.\n\nAs it turned out, that idle assumption had been quite wrong.\n\nThe trio of autonomists, Olsen, Motzfeldt, and Emil-Johansen had been organizing marches and protests along the Greenland West Coast since Iceland had broken from the OFN, and it seemed that enough people in Washington were seriously considering dialogue with them. Be it to placate them or to potentially give them what they wanted was unclear.\n\nJacob didn't know what the future held for the US presence, but he hoped that Washington knew better than to make another mistake like they had with Iceland."
  US_Greenland.18.a: "Whatever happened, it was clear the decision was out of his hands."

  US_Greenland.19.t: "The Triumph of Persistence"
  US_Greenland.19.d: "The arrival of representatives from the State Department was met with cautious, but excited fanfare from the crowds of Greenlanders who knew that the fate of their independence movement would be decided today. The Americans greeted the members of the Provincial Council, exchanging handshakes, and taking some photos with the press.\n\nTogether, both delegations entered into the Council chambers, and the doors closed behind them. Everyone knew that the Council would present their demand for independence - and also knew that the final choices rested with the Americans.\n\nAs the hours passed, the crowd only continued to grow, and the media spent their time interviewing the people campaigning for independence. For the Americans watching on the mainland, it was the first time many had heard of the movement, and why they wanted it.\n\nSuddenly, the doors to the chambers opened, and the media scrambled to their positions as the American officials and the Provincial Council emerged. The crowd immediately saw the smiles on the faces of Olsen, Motzfeldt, and Emil-Johansen - and knew that it was good news.\n\nThe State Department spokesman cleared his throat, before announcing that, in conjunction with the Provincial Council, the United States would be granting autonomy to Greenland, and would work with the Provincial Council to establish elections for the first Parliament of Greenland within six months.\n\nThe speaker could barely finish his statement before he was drowned out in cheers and applause from the crowd, joined by the Provincial Council who were all smiles as they basked in this historic moment. It had been a long road to this moment, but in the end, Greenland's future was in their own hands."
  US_Greenland.19.a: "Another colonial chain broken."

  US_Greenland.20.t: "Erfalasorput"
  US_Greenland.20.d: "The elections were approaching, but until that day, the Greenland Provincial Council continued to maintain the day-to-day affairs of government. There was much to do before there was a full transition to Home Rule. There were some complex issues to resolve, along with other less critical, but important matters which would determine what the new independent Greenland would look like.\n\nOne such matter was their national flag. Fortunately, they had some options.\n\nThue Christiansen, a teacher, artist, and friend of Motzfeldt had been called before the Council upon the recommendation of Motzfeldt, who believed he had a flag worthy of the new free Greenland. While the man appeared somewhat nervous as he stood before the Council, his voice was steady as he unveiled his flag proposal to them.\n\nIt was simple in its design, a stylized circle in the leftmost center of the flag, representing the sun crossing over the cold, rigid ice of Greenland. He'd chosen the colors as red and white, to represent and honor Denmark, whom they had inherited so much from. After he finished, the Council broke for debate, after thanking him for his proposal.\n\nThe members were fairly divided. Many liked the presented direction and the style, but there were several members who were in favor of a green and white Nordic Cross instead. The debate lasted longer than originally anticipated, but in a narrower-than-expected vote, they decided to accept Christiansen's proposal.\n\nOnly a few days later, the Provincial Council held a ceremony unveiling the new flag of Greenland; one which soon flew proudly over the state buildings, and soon became a common sight throughout the country."
  US_Greenland.20.a: "Greenland's identity solidifies further."

  US_Greenland.21.t: "The First Greenland Parliamentary Elections"
  US_Greenland.21.d: "The first national elections for Greenland were held to great fanfare and high turnout, with the day turning into an unofficial holiday across the nation. After voting, many gathered together with friends and family as they waited for the election results that would be released in the evening.\n\nThen finally, the results were in.\n\nWhile it was hardly a surprise, Siumut emerged as the clear political winner in the elections, to great jubilance of their supporters throughout the country. While they held dominant power in the newly established Inatsisartut - the new Greenland Parliament - they weren't without opposition, as Lars Chemnitz's conservative Atassut party had gained a minority of seats.\n\nIn the days that followed, and the first session of the Parliament took place, several names were rumored to be in consideration for the position of Prime Minister - but in the end, there was a clear choice. Jonathan Motzfeldt was chosen to be the first Prime Minister of Greenland, due to being a moderate within the party, and his leadership in gaining Greenland's autonomy.\n\nAs Motzfeldt addressed the nation and Parliament for the first time, he thanked many of his close partners, and the people of Greenland for helping achieve such a historic moment before announcing his government. Many familiar names found places in the first cabinet, such as Lars Emil-Johansen as Trade Minister, Moses Olsen as Social Minister, and Thue Christiansen as Culture Minister.\n\nEveryone who watched, be they a Greenland native or not, knew that the euphoria would soon fade, and the young nation would enter into growing pains and the inevitable problems that faced any new democracy. Yet such were costs each of them were willing to face, as for the first time, their destiny was in their own hands."

In 1940 the Faroes, a long time possession of Denmark, found themselves with a new ruler that being the British, who sought to keep out the German military. By the time the war had concluded the Faroese found themselves for the 2nd time under another occupier, this time the Americans who sought to maintain their military assets in the region and keep the islands out of the hands of the German puppet state in Copenhagen.\n\nEven after the Faroe Islands obtained their independence they still found themselves relegated to little more than a glorified military base for all other nations were concerned. With the OFN maintaining a substantial presence at air bases like Vága, and the Faroes holding an ever important geographical position this image is one that doesn't seem to be going away any time soon."

It reminds him what he is fighting for.\n\nPatursson's political career paralleled his work leading the Føroya fiskimannafelag, or Fishermen's Union. There, he saw the failures in OFN policy up close, the ways that American agreements corralled fisheries to work around restrictive resource rights and military plans.\n\nAlready politically active as the son of nationalist politician Jóannes Patursson, the realization compelled him to found his own party, the Tjóðveldisflokkurin. There, he worked his misgivings into proper policy. With allies new and old, he crafted a vision of a left-wing Faroe Islands, freed from the web of the OFN, ready to work for the citizens that form it.\n\nNow president, Erlendur Patursson is ready to enact that vision.

In that time, he has learned the value of maintaining his nation's ties.\n\nYes, the Faroe Islands' captors are not always kind. Yet each has left a mark on the state, working to invest in the nation's future. From Vága Airport to Tórshavn, the boons of these ties dot the nation. And even now, there is so much more left to give.\n\nIf the Faroe Islands are to grow, they cannot do so from splendid isolation. President Dam promises instead to create something better by working with the OFN.

Though he hails from a younger generation, Atli intends to carry on his father's work.\n\nYet there is one core difference: president Atli appears more willing to push his luck. Where Peter Mohr Dam seemed reverent to the ideals that supposedly defined his foreign ties, Atli has thus far imagined them as transactional, leaning on his natural charisma and skill to get needed provisions out of the OFN. So far, it seems to be working - Alti is getting investments that Peter could never manage.\n\nIt is an energy and force that no one, domestic or foreign, was quite prepared for.

  FAR.skeleton.4.d: "Even if the OFN was a family, it didn't always meet on friendly terms. The price of free association was the freedom of OFN member states to butt heads with each other - which they frequently did, venting their frustrations under the safety of the American security umbrella.\n\nSometimes, [USA.GetLeader] wondered if they argued precisely because they felt safe under American protection. Politics could be vicious when the stakes were shit - just as how the Icelandic and Faroe Islands governments had been at loggerheads for months over fishing boundaries in the North Sea.\n\nAnd at the frontier of liberty in the North Atlantic, sometimes America had to pick a side.\n\n"Ambassador, while I appreciate the sacrifices the Icelandic fishing industry is making without access to one of its prize fishing locations, the issue is settled!" [USA.GetLeader] said, leaning back in their chair in the Oval Office. "Of course, Commerce is looking into expediting preferential financing for American capital goods to Iceland. We're not leaving you empty handed."\n\nThe pause stretched on for thirty seconds, then a minute. [USA.GetLeader]'s eyes darted to the clock on the wall - once, twice, and then a third time.\n\n"To be frank, Ambassador, I don't know what else to tell you. Both governments requested American arbitration, and we provided it. We're happy to make it up to you, so long as we all agree the OFN remains in one piece.

  FAR.skeleton.5.d: "The windswept crags of the Faroe Islands were largely desolate, with communities clustering around the ports that formed the center of life in the remote OFN outpost in the North Sea. With the beginning of the age of flight, that included Vága Airport as well - and the military community that took root at the start of the Cold War had done even more to promote settled life in the secluded archipelago.\n\nBut as the years had worn on, the questions of war had increasingly morphed to the questions of peace. The Nazis were an ever-present menace to the southeast - but the Faroe Islands could not remain a barracks state indefinitely. The more the American bases stood without concrete benefits to the Faroes, the more the American presence would be seen as an occupation.\n\nThat was where the bankers had come in. With Iceland having narrowly avoided a radical shift in government away from the OFN, Wall Street - with a little prodding from Washington - had wasted no time offering their services to the Faroe Islands.\n\nSoon, the bankers and businessmen were replaced by bulldozers and construction workers, turning Vága airport and the surrounding environs into a hive of activity. A new terminal would be opened to service civilian cargo flights, with a refrigerated warehouse and canning factory for Faroe fish; while the workers of the islands manned their shifts, a new school would be built to ensure the children wouldn't go unattended.\n\nIt was good business - and good politics. The Faroe Islands would grow rich and comfortable under American direction - and no other option would be accepted."

  FAR.skeleton.6.t: "Paying the Rent"
  FAR.skeleton.6.d: "The windswept crags of the Faroe Islands were largely desolate, with communities clustering around the ports that formed the center of life in the remote OFN outpost in the North Sea. With the beginning of the age of flight, that included Vága Airport as well - and the military community that took root at the start of the Cold War had quickly become a fixture of the landscape, a fortress at the end of the free world.\n\nBut as the years had worn on, the questions of war had increasingly morphed to the questions of peace. The Nazis were an ever-present menace to the southeast - but the Faroe Islands could not remain a barracks state indefinitely. The more the American bases stood without concrete benefits to the Faroes, the more the American presence would be seen as an occupation.\n\nIt was a rude awakening to Washington when they discovered they were not quite the welcome guests they believed they were. Hearing that the new Icelandic governing coalition included parties lukewarm to America had sent the State Department into a panicked frenzy, as they realized that they'd been living off their landlords' generosity for too long - and that the rent was about to go up.\n\nA review of the Faroe Islands' membership status in the OFN. Subsidized expansion of Vága airport to include a civilian and industrial terminal. The 'rationalization' of the American force posture into several key installations - or relocating existing ones further inland, away from the towns and bars that had grown thoroughly sick of their overbearing presence.\n\nThe Americans swallowed the terms, despite the whispers of 'direct action' making the rounds in Washington."
  FAR.skeleton.6.a: "They needed their island fortress more than it needed them."

  FAR.skeleton.7.t: "The Deal of a Lifetime"
  FAR.skeleton.7.d: "Washington had sighed in relief when the election results in Iceland had been announced - and then girded itself for the hard work still to come. As the new coalition government took office, the only consensus was that there was no consensus - and that the issue of the Faroe Island's role would have to be negotiated from scratch.\n\nFirst came the task of talking with the Islands themselves - a difficult prospect when access was so difficult, requiring days to complete even a single round of talks. With talks with Iceland now on the table, the Faroes were now demanding the moon and more - making the negotiations stretch from days into weeks as the Faroes made the price of their continued presence in the OFN clear.\n\nAnd then came the task of convincing the Icelandic government. Skeptics abounded in Reykjavík - what did Iceland owe the Faroe Islands, and more importantly, why could Iceland not have what the Faroes were asking to get? To that, the Pentagon had pointed out that the Faroes served as Iceland's sandbar in the Atlantic - and without it, Iceland's defense would be that much more precarious.\n\nMonths passed, and the new document outlining OFN - Faroe relations grew longer and longer. Chapter after chapter of legal jargon spilled over stacks of paper, weighing down every flight that departed Vága Airport for Washington. Fisheries, oil exploration, export controls, and investment - the Faroes would get everything they asked for, so long as they adhered to the finest print:"

  FAR.skeleton.8.t: "Separation Anxiety"
  FAR.skeleton.8.d: "The night of the Icelandic elections, almost all of Tórshavn roared in triumphant satisfaction - save for the single building housing the OFN mission to the Faroe Islands, now acutely aware of how unwelcome they were in the farthest bastion of freedom in the North Atlantic.\n\nHow had it come to this? That was a question that was quickly left for the historians, for neither Washington, nor the new Faroe administration, had the time to indulge in navel gazing. From the moment the Islands - following Iceland's lead, as they had pledged ahead of Iceland's vote - had decided to separate from the OFN, Germania's gaze had turned to the North Atlantic, waiting for an opportunity to cleave the Islands from their former protector entirely.\n\nThat sobering reality hit home as the American negotiators shared photographic intelligence of German submarines, lingering just outside the waters the Faroe Islands claimed as their own. Even if America promised to respect the results of the vote, there was no assurance the Germans would do the same - and that had quickly changed into a guarantee of OFN protection, even if the Faroes would no longer permanently host an American military presence.\n\nThe Americans were careful to ask for little more, giving the Islands exclusive rights to 200 nautical miles surrounding their territory and accepting the minimal military access agreement offered. The Faroes had made their voice clear - they would be leaving the OFN, in the hopes of coexisting better as neighbors than as family. To push them away might see them fleeing to the Germans - and when faced with one fait accompli, Washington was loath to cause another."

  FAR.skeleton.9.t: "Last Call"
  FAR.skeleton.9.d: "The night of the Icelandic elections, almost all of Tórshavn roared in triumphant satisfaction - save for the single building housing the OFN mission to the Faroe Islands, now acutely aware of how unwelcome they were in the farthest bastion of freedom in the North Atlantic.\n\nThe fact that the moderates were in charge in the Faroes was of little comfort. From the moment the Islands - following Iceland's lead, as they had pledged ahead of Iceland's vote - had decided to revisit their ties to the OFN, popular romanticism coexisted in an uneasy balance with the rational leaders still in government - and there was no question that the former was in the driver's seat. Nothing would be the same anymore.\n\nAs German submarines lingered just outside Faroe Islands' claimed waters, the Americans and the Faroe government locked themselves in for days of intensive negotiations. A representative of the Icelandic government was invited, whose stay was extended for a day, and then a week - followed by a delegation of American financiers, who left with sour expressions.\n\nFinally, the newspapers were invited in to read the final draft - granting the Faroe Islands full equal representation in the OFN, an expansive 250-mile Special Economic Zone in the waters surrounding the islands, and a raft of new investments in schools and the industrial infrastructure of Vága Airport. The American troop presence would be downsized - replacing a 'garrison' with a 'visiting agreement', reducing the omnipresent presence of OFN troops to a month of intense annual exercises.\n\nThere were protests - some islanders threatened to demand another vote. But the government held firm, and the protesters dwindled as the American transports sailed away, no longer present - but never very far away, either."
