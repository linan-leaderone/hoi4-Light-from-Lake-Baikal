 KOM_rcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_true_passionarists: "From Disorder, Salvation"
 
 KOM_rcoup_the_national_revolution_desc: "The Passionariy and its allies have successfully seized control in Syktyvkar. Our main target, the Assembly, has been secured by our forces and cleared of hostiles. However, our position is not entirely secured, and our enemies continue to plot against our young government.We must secure our government against these liberals and leftist radicals, or the national revolution will be strangled in its cradle.\n\nSyktyvkar has been a haven for sin and corruption for far too long, and only the Passionariy and their ideals can save this city from the threat of Bolshevism and the weakness of liberalism. Gumilyov, Shafarevich, and the other leaders of the Passionariy are the perfect group of individuals to lead our government into the future."
 KOM_rcoup_shut_down_the_stagnant_desc: "If we are aware of anything, it's the danger posed by Mikhail Suslov and his loyal, fanatical bands of pro-Soviet leftists. For the past few months, if not years, Suslov has regularly ordered political assassinations and street violence from his bands and militias, and they have carried out, without question, every letter of his orders. As such, we can no longer trust the Komi left to sit by "idly" as we solidify our rule; they are surely plotting our demise. Suslov's deviousness, however, is not matched by his political posturing. The stagnant form of socialism preached by the left is far from a convincing path for the Russian people's future. As such, we must make sure that they never come to power. A combination of force and propaganda will ensure that we isolate them and their most fanatical ideologues from the rest of their supporters."
 KOM_rcoup_learn_from_the_reds_desc: "The Komi left is nothing if not vicious. Caught up in the atmosphere of political chaos and instability, Suslov has become an incredibly ironclad figure, ordering political assassinations and contributing to the chaos in the streets. While Suslov and his attack dogs have had the right as their primary targets ever since the formation of the republic, that doesn't mean that we can't learn from them. In fact, we should ensure that we integrate a number of their tactics for political intimidation and violence, ensuring that our militias and those who command them are well-equipped to deal not just with the leftists, but with the democratic center as well. Right now, at the crucial moment, we should make sure that our competition, vehemently opposed to our ideology, is not in any position to protest the radical changes that we have planned."
 KOM_rcoup_align_taboritsky_desc: "Sergey Taboritsky, and his allies, have always been a wildcard in Syktyvkar's right-wing political scene. Regardless, it's no secret that he has a fairly sizable following which could be used to our advantage. However, it's likely that we would have to compromise with the man to ensure that we can win him over to our side.\n\nTaboritsky, despite his dubious character, would be an invaluable tool to preserve our new order in these chaotic times, especially with the amount of power he wields over the militias as a popular figure in their ranks. By aligning his goals more with ours, we will be able to ensure not only that we further align a powerful ally, but deflect a potential enemy, at least for now."
 KOM_rcoup_appeal_to_the_clergy_desc: "Despite what Suslov and his leftist lackeys may claim, we are, after all, socialists. And who, if not the workers, do we serve? A number of individuals within our party have suggested that we play to our strengths to weaken our enemies and solidify our position. One of our strengths, as much as Serov hates to admit it, is not only his old connection to the left, but also his connection with the workers who the left had so desperately attempted to win over to their side. While we are attempting to consolidate our control of Komi's political apparatus, we should also appeal to the workers of the region, who will know that Ordosocialism is the future for the Russian people! After all, harkening back to as early as the October Revolution, it's clear that the workers, who are used to being organized and consistently desire a role in government, are a potent tool in the hands of those who know how to use them."
 KOM_rcoup_flood_the_streets_desc: "Even from our party headquarters, secured by the most loyal of militias, we can hear the chaos going on in the streets of the capital. The coup went off without issue, of course, however the fallout has been greater than we were expecting, and the mayhem that our actions have caused seems to have paralyzed Syktyvkar. Even if we are now nominally in control of the republic, that reality won't last long if we don't take action against the rioters, leftist militia, and political dissidents that are trashing the once-orderly streets of our capital. Thus, we must flood the streets with our supporters, push all the weapons that we have into their hands and court violence against our opponents, lest they take action against us first."
 KOM_rcoup_nobody_enters_desc: "To our north are the treacherous agents of Suslov's allies. To our south and west are the threats of reaction and the German. In this critical time - at this very moment - we need to ensure that with our mounting internal issues, no external force can take advantage of the instability. By intensifying border patrols, mustering together loyal garrison and militia forces who will be able to prevent the ingress of any potential threat, we will be able to complete Suslov's personal wish that, in his words, "nobody enters into our new state". By isolating Suslov's disconnected leftists and ensuring that anyone caught attempting to enter our territory is treated with extreme prejudice, we can guarantee that our new administration is, for the time being, protected from most external threats of subversion."
 KOM_rcoup_the_guns_of_the_passionariyy_desc: "We have one of the largest paramilitaries in the Republic; let us put it to good use! We have the central government buildings in our hands, but there are still many important public buildings, transport hubs, warehouses and infrastructure centers that lie in enemy hands. Let us send forth our brave soldiers, supported by those former Republican Army elements who have joined us, to claim what is rightfully ours!"
 KOM_rcoup_no_more_unwritten_rules_desc: "There are three unwritten rules in these lands: (1) No killing the leaders of the many factions, for the good of the Republic, (2) Prevent unnecessary death, aid the injured if you can spare it, and (3) Do not interfere with the lives of civilians. However, these rules restrict our plans, and allow for the our opposition to grow in power. The factions must be eliminated, for they seek to do the same to us. This is unacceptable, and must be dealt with immediately. Our forces should not have to spare a thought for the safety of our enemies, and any restrictions upon their righteous actions must be eliminated.\n\nThe civilians, as well, may form the greatest place for infiltrators to hide once we have destroyed their power bases. The civilians too must be given scrutiny, and incorporated into our grand plan to take control of the Republic. They will thank us, in the end."
 KOM_rcoup_open_the_arsenals_desc: "Many paramilitary organizations patrol these lands, led by those who would deny our authority. To more effectively deal with these traitors, we may make use of the extensive Syktyvkar Arsenal. It ranges from nonlethal tear gas to devastating supplies of chlorine gas. We have no need for the most extravagant measures - the more lethal weapons shall find their purpose later. However, for now tear gas and similar armaments shall prove sufficient for eliminating our current enemies. Dissent and rebellion shall not be tolerated under our watch."
 KOM_rcoup_a_common_cause_desc: "Some of the other rightists may skew far to the reactionary tendency - or, in Serov's case, the socialistic tendency - for one's liking, but they are not without redeeming qualities. Specifically, their loathing for leftists makes them fanatically dedicated to the common cause of crushing the Republic left-wing bloc. We should appeal to our shared interests, so that we can rally more forces to the defense of our new government, and keep the temporary coalition that we have built stable for a longer time."
 KOM_rcoup_sideline_Taboritsky_desc: "Sergey Taboritsky is a madman, gripped by delusions of grandeur. However, as the only notable monarchist in the Republic, like-minded men flock to his banner, along with many of the Orthodox Church's more fervent defenders. He thus has a large contingent of well-trained, fanatical soldiers at his command. Sidelining him, so long as we do not make it too evident, is a worthy goal in terms of eliminating his utter madness from having a chance of taking control of the Republic - but may negatively affect the forces at our disposal."
 KOM_rcoup_secure_the_concept_desc: "Before we embark on the journey towards the rest of Russia, we must ensure that our support base is secure. If we start building atop weak foundations, the entire structure will eventually topple. With the strongest organization amongst us being Lev Gumilyov's core of the Passionarist Society, Eurasianists must be placed in key offices, propaganda distributed and our civilian supporters protected."
 KOM_rcoup_none_may_contest_desc: "A show of force is what we need! There are many citizens who still doubt the capabilities of our paramilitary. Of course, we are not Bolsheviks who will simply mow down dissenters. Instead, we can convince them of our might by launching decisive strikes against the foe and engaging them in open battle to prove our superiority."
 KOM_rcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_true_passionarists_desc: "We have succeeded! From every building in Syktyvkar, our flags wave, and in our other cities, proud parades march down main boulevards that were until a mere month ago, dens of infiltrator nations, liberals, and Bolsheviks. The old Republic has finally come to an end - the decadent crypto-Bolshevik democracy has been smothered, and our new state has been birthed from its ashes.\n\nThe time is nigh for the end of our inward focus, and the beginning of our rightful restoration of the national glory of Russia."

 #Fascist Expansion
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_salvation_of_the_nation: "The Salvation of the Nation"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_salvation_of_the_nation_desc: "A great victory has been achieved for the Russian nation. With the triumph of our National Revolution against the depraved and decaying Komi Republic, the rebirth of Russia moves ever closer! Our Provisional Government will serve as a fine replacement and one that can steer Russia and its people back onto a righteous course.\n\nHowever, this victory does not mean our work is done. On the contrary, the greatest test of the government is facing us right now. We must triumph in the tumultuous and tribulation that accompanies this Smuta. It is time to finally reverse the October Revolution and for the Provisional Government to triumph against the degeneracy around us!"

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_old_foundation: "The Old Foundation"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_old_foundation_desc: "Our movement is home to a great variety of political groupings, united only by their common rejection of both communism and the status quo in the republic. This breadth has served us well in getting this far, but the cracks between groupings are showing more clearly by the day, and our cohesion suffers as a result. It is time to sharpen our focus. We will reunite the Provisional Government around the alliance at the core of the old Passionariyy, the partnership between Igor Shafarevich's nationalists and Lev Gumilyov Eurasianists. While they disagree on some points, both are used to working with the other, and the two of them together will command a stronger, more focused government."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_king_of_wands: "The King of Wands"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_king_of_wands_desc: "Lev Gumilyov founded the Passionariyy Organization to promote his idea of Eurasia. That idea, and his proposed path towards realizing it, came to lay the foundation for our work. Since then, the organization has come to encompass a much broader range of political thought and groupings, but it is now time to unite around one. If Gumilyov's faction carries the day, they will seek to consolidate the Passionariyy, then lead us to a future where we can rise above petty concerns and regionalisms to pursue their grand vision of United Eurasia. They won't have us emulate either the West or the East, but embrace our position as a bridge between them."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_where_others_fear_to_tread: "Where Others Fear to Tread"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_where_others_fear_to_tread_desc: "Nationalism is an important force in the republic and the lands beyond, and strongly felt by its population. Far too often, however, it takes the form of petty regionalism. We are not "Komi" people, nor are we "Russians". We are the beating heart of the Eurasian super-ethnos, an innately multi-ethnic group composed of many cultures under the united banner of Eurasian identity. We must educate our people of their true place in the world and erode the Great-Russian chauvinism that has wormed its way into the heart of our movement, so that they will fully share in our struggle to realize the great state of United Eurasia."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_roots_of_the_concept: "The Roots of the Concept"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_roots_of_the_concept_desc: "Eurasianism as a concept can trace its roots to emigre groups during the 1920s trying to cope with the creation of the USSR. Some saw the creation of the Soviet Union as a stepping stone to a new national non-European Orthodox government. While these naive progenitors foresaw it as a transformation of the union, we now know better that it will arise out of the union's ashes after its destruction.\n\nGumilyov sees the opportunity for a Eurasian state to truly unite the disparate and shattered parts of Russia. By uniting under this shared heritage, Gumilyov, the visionary that he is, recognizes the ability to stabilize Russia with its multiethnic and multicultural nature. Something our other colleagues on the right are all too eager to discard or ignore."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_search_for_passion: "The Search For Passion"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_search_for_passion_desc: "Gumilyov's strange clique of Scythian and Hun-worshiping Eurasianists have always been a bizarre facet of Komi politics. Their influence and political power, however, have never been in doubt.\n\nThe core of the right, the Eurasianists, have thrown their net wide in an attempt to bring together a coterie of like-minded individuals. These "Passionariy" must possess proper traditional Eurasian values along with the wisdom and intellect to guide Komi, and Russia, to a passionate future where one day, this Council of Passionariy will advise the political elite in all matters.\n\nThe intellectual and spiritual core of Eurasia lives among us, even now - we need only guide them into the halls of power."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_eurasia_forever: "Eurasia, Forever"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_eurasia_forever_desc: "The path to reunification will be long and hard and full of struggle, but we will never falter. Our country is torn apart by petty warlords and traitors, who spouse petty regionalisms to keep our people divided. We will not be fooled by them. Some now say that we should limit our goals, Russia, they say, is our motherland. They are wrong! We have always been greater, the fate of our people always been more glorious, than the dead state of Russia. We will fight on until every petty warlord is beaten, we will fight until every Eurasian is gathered under our banner. We will not rest until our common destiny is realized. Eurasia forever!"

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_knight_of_pentacles: "The Knight of Pentacles"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_knight_of_pentacles_desc: "Most of our popular support is centered on the moderate wing of our alliance, led by Igor Shafarevich. His promises to respect the Republic while reaffirming our national traditions is what sanitized our government to voters beyond the hard core of our constituencies, and even now serves as the "face" of what the Provisional Government wishes to espouse to the world. Adopting his gradualist approach and "national democratic" ideal will maintain support and stability while we implement our ideas."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_compassion_in_the_dark: "Compassion in the Dark"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_compassion_in_the_dark_desc: "As the people must serve the state, so must the state serve the people. Our commitment to uphold strict moral values gives us a strong foundation from which to build such a state. Now it's time to build on that foundation. We must ensure our people are warm and safe. We must feed their bellies and their thirst for purpose. We must not think of the work as easy, or of ourselves as infallible, but work gradually and learn from our mistakes. Our values will be the foundation, each successive reform will be a brick, and soon we will have built a grand structure to house all of the Republic."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_fruits_of_our_labors: "The Fruits of Our Labors"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_fruits_of_our_labors_desc: "For too long have the degenerate liberals and socialists on the left deprived people of their toil. They have overtaxed good honest people, and for what? Has it been for their frivolous programs, or perhaps to line their pockets in the sweat of the people?\n\nWell, this ends today! People are entitled to the fruits of their labor, and our government will not stand for this abuse anymore. Everyday citizens will no longer live in fear of the taxman as we slash taxes across the board. Businesses can finally operate knowing that they will own the entirety of their work without unjust theft, as it always should have been."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_gods_green_earth: "God's Green Earth"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_gods_green_earth_desc: "There exists nothing more beautiful than the holy land which surrounds us, and its Earthly beauty which we can only marvel at. Its connection to the people and God has been something we have always idealized, especially Shaferavich.\n\nTo strengthen this connection, we will reach out to the church and embolden our partnership with them per Shaferavich's wishes.\n\nA green and ruralist Russia will arise out of our actions, connected wholly to the people. Meanwhile the debauchery of urbanism and over-industrialization will be curbed and relegated to the cities where they belong."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_a_dream_for_the_nation: "A Dream for the Nation"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_a_dream_for_the_nation_desc: "Our duty to restore our country to greatness will never be done, and dogmatic adherence to past decisions will only hinder us in our work. While there is a time and place for spectacular action, it is through the many small successes of our day-to-day struggle that we will realize our dreams for tomorrow. We will be pragmatic in how we rule the Republic, we will be practical in our day-to-day rule and we will apply the lessons learnt from past failures - both our own and those of others. As long as we remain true to our ethos of compassionate conservatism and informed by the ancient traditions of our nation, we shall remain on the right path - the path that shall realise the dream that we hold for the Russian nation."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_will_to_power: "The Will to Power"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_will_to_power_desc: "A state is only as strong as its army, and Komi's military has always been in a sorry state. Divided by politics, and descended from Red Army mutineers, the armed forces have been a mess of conflicting ideologies and petty rivalries.\n\nNow that the Smuta has begun and the Right is ascendant, we will rectify this mess. Officers will be reshuffled, right-minded commanders promoted, and the deadwood set adrift.\n\nThe same sentiment applies to the bureaucracy. The Provisional Government is also a viper's nest of division. Even the Right is sharply divided, with Eurasianist, conservative, tsarist, and Ordosocialist at each other's throats. These differences must be settled, at least until the Smuta can be concluded."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_economic_struggle: "The Economic Struggle"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_economic_struggle_desc: "As the Provisional Government sweeps over West Russia, we have acquired a great deal of new territory. With new territory comes new resources, new pieces of infrastructure, and new people.\n\nAll of these, tragically, come with new problems. Railroads must be rejoined with our own network, resources exploited appropriately, and populations set to work in the proper locales. These ensuing logistical snarls will keep our government occupied with charts, maps, and work reports.\n\nWith our divided coalition government, this snarl could turn into a veritable disaster. Unity amongst the factions must be stressed, and loyalty demanded. Without a united front on the economy, the Provisional Government may sink under the weight of economic woes before it has the chance to breathe."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_mistakes_of_the_white_army: "The Mistakes of the White Army"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_mistakes_of_the_white_army_desc: "The days of the Russian Civil War are long past us, but the realities of which continue to stare us in the face. For all their pomp and noble bearing, the White generals were little more than warlords vying for their little piece of Russia. Though united in their mutual crusade against Bolshevism, the White Army failed because its generals refused to coordinate with one another. As our officers form cliques and argue over ideology, these parallels are not lost on us.\n\nOur sectarian squabbles must wait until after our victory is achieved. Corruption will be punished harshly, and the men given not simply what they need to survive, but the propaganda and decency required to nourish their souls."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_means_and_the_ends: "The Means and the Ends"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_means_and_the_ends_desc: "The breadth of thought in our movement extends to political strategy. While there is a general agreement we need to be diligent in managing public support and opposition, what measures we should use and where our focus should be is proving a difficult discussion. Some believe that information campaigns about our great work should be enough to keep the public on our side. Others propose we tie ourselves much more strongly to the Orthodox Church. There is also support for campaigns to suppress dissent and opposition more forcefully, with disagreement centering more on the proposed extent and violence of them. It is time to make a decision."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_constitutional_practices: "Constitutional Practices"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_constitutional_practices_desc: "In order to strengthen our hold on Komi and guide it to a better future, we should move to construct a new constitution to replace that of the old Republic's. This will mark a break with the corrupt old order and let us show the people our good intentions. That the drafting process will show us where the prominent voices in our organization land on key issues, and who in our organization commands the influence to push their favorite clauses through is just an added benefit, of course."
 KOM_fasc_smuta_constitutional_practices_tt: "The §MRepublic§!'s constitution shall be §Yrepealed and replaced§! with one of our own making."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_mistaken_republic: "The Mistaken Republic"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_mistaken_republic_desc: "The Komi Republic, for all its talk of democracy, was founded by a former Soviet in a Soviet city. The legacy of the Reds surrounds Syktyvkar like a cloud of insects, ever present, and impossible to ignore. Our children will grow up in a traditionalist nation, a Russia freed from the mistakes and atrocities of Bolshevism, and they deserve a capital unstained by the USSR.\n\nWith the recent liberation of Vyatka, the stronghold of the would-be tsar, the monarchists under Taboritsky have crowed long and loud to make it our new capital. The idea has merit, as it possesses more centralized location, better infrastructure, and a lack of overt Soviet history.\n\nWith a few strokes of the pen and some new offices, Vyatka will become the new heart of Russia reborn."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_new_machine: "The New Machine"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_new_machine_desc: "The men who were once the torchbearers for a new vision of Russia have devolved into bickerers and factionists. The old guard of the Passionariyy can no longer be trusted to rebuild the Motherland - however, that does not mean Russia does not have a future any more. Taboritsky, Serov, and others did not join the Passionariyy out of idealism, but of convenience, but they are the ones who the torch shall be passed onto, who shall return Russia to glory. Perhaps a proposal to cut them a deal to increase their power in the Provisional Government is in the works."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_page_of_cups: "The Page of Cups"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_page_of_cups_desc: "Russia is a sick country. The motherland is bitterly divided, and her people are fearful and in want, easy prey to the traitors and parasites that feast upon her sickened body. Sergey Taboritsky tells us it wasn't always like this. Under the Holy Tsar, he says, the Russians walked the path of righteousness. Everyone knew their place in the world and did their duty to the Motherland and for that, she wielded immense wealth and power. Taboritsky wants us to improve our wretched condition, return to the natural order and step back on the path of righteousness. Once we return to the traditional way of things, he promises, the glories of the past will return to us.\n\nDoes the future of Russia lie in the past?"

 KOM_fasc_smuta_in_the_orphans_hands: "In the Orphans' Hands"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_in_the_orphans_hands_desc: "It is no secret that Taboritsky remains the black sheep of the Provisional Government. A terrorist, assassin, and former Gestapo collaborator, Taboritsky commands a fearsome paramilitary band. Recruited from Church-sponsored orphanages, the Shturmoviki have spent their whole lives preparing for the reconquest of Russia. Fanatically loyal, brutal, and disciplined, the black guard of the monarchists spilled gallons of blood in the street brawls of Syktyvkar.\n\nThe director of this, frankly ghoulish, program is Viktor Larionov. A career army officer, Larionov has spent the post-war years training Taboritsky's army of child soldiers up into a hardened force of cold-blooded men. Viktor Larionov will be named Minister of Defense, and though many will cry out in disgust, there is no one more qualified."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_of_church_and_crown: "Of Church and Crown"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_of_church_and_crown_desc: "Many in Komi share our desire for a return to monarchy, but not all of them support our Presidency. This is folly. Now that we have taken power, the cause of monarchism is inescapably tied to us - if we should fail, it will fail along with us. We must make monarchists of every political bent see that we are the only chance they have at seeing their vision for Russia fulfilled: The Holy Tsar restored, reigning in a Russia that has returned to greatness."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_vanished_prince: "The Vanished Prince"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_vanished_prince_desc: "In the early hours of July 17, 1918, the Holy Tsar was murdered by Bolshevik traitors. It was said at the time that his only son and heir, Tsarevich Alexei, was murdered as well. That was a lie. The righteous Tsar lives! Whisked away before the traitors could kill him, and in hiding for almost fifty years now, he awaits the time when Russia has returned to the path of righteousness. Only then he will return and restore the greatness we all knew in the past. Until that time, Sergey Taboritsky will rule in his place as Regent, to unite Russia behind his rule and make the country ready for his return."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_alexei_lives: "Alexei Lives!"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_alexei_lives_desc: "The odd man out in the eclectic collection of Komi's rightists shall always remain the monarchists. Granted, our rightists aren't exactly mainstream, but the OVRI are beyond the pale. Still, monarchism has a certain appeal, even if Taboritsky's ramblings about the Divine Right of Kings and Alexei Romanov turn heads.\n\nDespite what anyone says, the monarchy remains Russia's most enduring institution. Just look at the followings commanded by the Rus in Kemerovo and the tsars in Chita and Vyatka. Harnessing the passion that drove the Russians against the French, Swedes, and steppe barbarians has obvious benefits. A stable monarchy could do wonders for solidifying a new Russian state."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_ace_of_swords: "The Ace of Swords"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_ace_of_swords_desc: "Ivan Serov is an outlier, a self-proclaimed socialist who believes that the Russian worker should be the centre of the new Russian order the Passionariyy seek to create. Thus far, he has been almost completely rejected by more orthodox Passionariyy members, which makes his vision so invigorating. By agitating the common people and showing them how the rise of Russia is in the best of interests for workers across the nation, he may be the one who can reinvigorate Russia with their strength and lead her back to glory."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_thesis_and_antithesis: "Thesis and Antithesis"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_thesis_and_antithesis_desc: "Communism and its platitudes of equality for all people has been properly consigned into the pages of history; however, a sizable contingent of people refuse to acknowledge this. However, rather than showing them how obsolete their beliefs are in person, with the rise of Serov, it may be more useful to find them places in the Passionariyy order. Certainly not all men are created equal, but all Russian workers are, and by convincing them to abandon their delusional belief that foreigners should be treated the same as Russians, we will be rewarded with a large base of experienced politicians in our quest to rebuild Russia."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_by_cloak_and_dagger: "By Cloak and Dagger"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_by_cloak_and_dagger_desc: "Ivan Serov, despite his position as ideological messiah and revolutionary, will always be an NKVD agent first. A shrewd manipulator and cunning operative, Serov will have the security apparatus in the palm of his calloused hand before long. Why wait? Aligning ourselves willingly with the Ordosocialists will put capable secret police at our disposal. Alexander Korotkov, one of Serov's minions, will be appointed Minister of Defense. This will increase the Ordosocialist's influence, but the benefits far outweigh the potential risks."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_lessons_of_the_red_eminence: "The Lessons of the Red Eminence"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_lessons_of_the_red_eminence_desc: "Suslov was a terrible man. He was an individual so pig-headed and stubborn that he failed to accept the necessity of change before him, laid out in individuals such as Comrade Serov. His lust for power was so severe that he was oblivious to the rage contained in individuals like Serov that would eventually be his downfall.\n\nHowever, that does not mean he was not useless. On the contrary, he had an exceptional gift for political maneuvering that helped him stay in power for so long. Now that Serov leads the Provisional Government's security service, the lessons he took from his old master will serve excellently efficiently in securing his power and unity within the Provisional Government."

 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_smoke_seared_tomorrow: "The Smoke-Seared Tomorrow"
 KOM_fasc_smuta_the_smoke_seared_tomorrow_desc: "One of the most vital aspects of modern Russia's identity and success has been its industrial sectors. Developed throughout the previous Soviet governments, the heavy industry previously developed has been critical to the previous and current survival of our state. They have helped push back our opponents and keep the Nazi menace at bay.\n\nThe Provisional Government has neglected this ever-crucial industry, and today Serov will see that its importance is refocused. A new plan of rapid industrialization will be put underway to renew this heavy industry under the direct control of the state. This project will help restore a national spirit to our land and aid in the eventual reunification of all of Russia."

Lines are being drawn ever more firmly as the primary leadership candidates make their last appeals to the voting membership. There are no more debates to be had, no more backroom deals to be made. The four men will each make a final speech and then - the decision. The only other question to be decided is who will be the one to speak last. It's the most desired position in the order of speeches by all four candidates, and whoever secures it will have gained both the prestige of a small victory and the perceived benefit of having the last word before the vote.

The time for division, for sectarian squabbling, is over. One final convention will be held, one last meeting of the minds. At the crossroads, the Provisional Government faces an uncertain future. Will Russia be united under conservatism? Eurasianism? Monarchism? Whatever Ordosocialism is?\n\nThe answer is clear to any who have been watching. As the cabinet has slowly filled, one candidate for leadership's minions and sycophants have made themselves known.

 KOM_burgsys_grand_regency_desc: "We, the rightful regency of Holy Russia, have finally risen. Our enemies crowd around us, but we tread the blessed path. The imperial heartlands have been reclaimed in the name of God, Tsar, and Nation. The Empire yet rises, as Lazarus, from its tomb.\n\nYet, there remains so much more to do. The foundations of our home are riven by rot, promulgated by the unholy degeneracy of Bolshevism, Jewry, and cosmopolitanism. The cleansing fire of our divinely-mandated rule must burn away these impurities and make way for His Imperial Majesty before all hope is lost."
 KOM_burgsys_uplift_the_system_desc: "A blessing has come to this world, cloaked in the black guise of National Socialism. This system, based on absolute and unquestioned dictatorial authority, has been best exemplified in the German outpost known to them as 'Kaukasien'. Of course, those lands are rightfully Russian, but the German ruler, Reichskommissar Josias, has forged them into something truly remarkable: a state where subhumans are systematically oppressed and exterminated for the benefit of their racial superiors.\n\nWhat an ingenious creation! Surely, God himself acts through this Josias, showing us the path to reclaiming Russia's glory. Through the proper application of this 'Burgundian System', altered to suit our needs, the rule of the Regent and the Tsarevich will be unassailable. At the same time, it will allow us to cleanse Russia of impure races, forever securing it for the true master race!"
 KOM_burgsys_uplift_the_system_trade_tt: "We shall §Ycut off our trade§! with the §Rcorrupt outside world§!."
 KOM_burgsys_reform_the_okhrana_desc: "We are locked in an eternal struggle with forces too terrible for godly men to truly comprehend. The world sinks deeper and deeper into the muck of degeneracy with each passing day. Only the actions of a brave few men - such as the Regent - keep it from being swallowed up by the darkness.\n\nBut the Regent cannot bear the burden alone. He needs good, reliable servants - trustworthy men pure of heart and intent. As Providence has shown us, only a legion of such men, backed with the iron will of the Regent, are capable of maintaining order. The Okhrana, risen from the dead, shall be Russia's shadow-clad bulwark against all evil."
 KOM_burgsys_imperskiye_shturmoviki_desc: "The sinful people of Russia have been afflicted such by decades of Judeo-Bolshevik rule that they no longer understand what is best for them. The Regent's laws are but suggestions to the misguided; the only language most of them are able to comprehend is force.\n\nTo carry out the solemn duty of impressing the Regent's divine mandate upon the people, a new army must be raised. This will be no motley band of soldiers, polluted by sin and earthly desires, but an order of the brave, the strong, and the pure. They shall be the Regent's strong right arm, dispensing justice with bullet and bayonet to the traitors and undesirables within our realm."
 KOM_burgsys_eyes_in_every_house_desc: "Tragically, few Russians understand the importance or even the nature of the Regent's holy work. Unwittingly inspired by the Jewish enemy, they shy away from God's light and conceal their secrets beneath a veil of lies. There, away from sight, they fester and rot, spreading a foul contagion that poisons the very soul of Russia.\n\nFortunately, there remains a sliver of light in even the most benighted souls. With the clink of coins and the click of a cocked gun, the people of Russia can be lured or nudged onto the correct path. With a little persistence, all the dark secrets of the lowly shall be revealed, and the Regent's faithful servants will see them expunged."
 KOM_burgsys_improve_on_our_knowledge_desc: "Loyal, observant watchmen are a blessing to the Regent, but they are still human - still imperfect. We cannot grow complacent in our trust of them, for the flesh is weak and the human heart filled to bursting with sin. Only the greatest among us are truly safe from the Devil's temptations.\n\nBut the machine has none of these flaws. Steel, copper and plastic might corrode, but they will never betray us or fail in their duty. Wire-taps, surveillance cameras, hidden microphones - these marvels of technology will grant the Regent a sliver of the Lord's own omniscience and omnipresence. So armed, our sacred peace is assured."
 KOM_burgsys_honor_the_blessed_regent_desc: "Some place their trust in money. Some place their trust in weapons of war. Some, wretched beyond all others, place their trust in the iconoclasm of ideology. We, of all the world's nations, know better.\n\nWe, the Russians, place our trust in Sergey Taboritsky, Blessed Regent of His Imperial Majesty Tsarevich Alexei Romanov, true heir to the Russian Empire. Anointed with the blood of unbelievers, his reign is divinely mandated by the Lord God and eternally sanctioned in the name of Christ. The Lord has chosen him as His vessel and the harbinger of the Empire's return to glory, carrying forth the eternal light of the Third Rome. Only the Regent has been imparted with the Lord's own wisdom and power - only he can truly claim legitimacy over all the Russias. So shall it be until the Tsarevich is found and restored to his rightful throne!"
 KOM_burgsys_imperial_artwork_desc: "Russia's culture, once the pure inheritor of Rome's legacy, has been polluted to the point that the Regent weeps to even behold it. A thousand different and equally degenerate influences now sully every form of art in our beautiful nation. Worst of all are the idolatrous and perverse scrawlings of the Bolsheviks, venerating the proletarian rabble and their abominable, atheistic state above all else.\n\nTrue art, directly from the halcyon years of the Romanovs, is the only acceptable expression of Russian culture. All Bolshevik filth must be scourged away with fire, along with the scribblings of vile writers like Pasternak, the Jewish infiltrator."
 KOM_burgsys_cult_of_the_tsarevich_desc: "Wherever Tsarevich Alexei is hiding, surely he is living a most blessed life. Raised by gentle, caring men of God, he has certainly been instilled with all the virtues of a great and holy ruler. More than that, he carries the sanctified blood of his martyred father within his veins, setting him above all other men. Even among the racially superior of the world, he must be the most exemplary specimen.\n\nAll the people of Russia should know this, from the lowliest peasant to the highest noble. The Tsarevich is the sacred prince promised directly to our Regent by the Lord. He shall be as glorious and perfect in form and mind as Christ himself, King of Kings and Ruler of Rulers. Our Golden Child, our Blessed Prince of Longing - all of Russia shall know of your glory, from now 'til Judgement Day. Your Regent shall ensure that none ever heed the voice of Satan and defy you as the Jew-Tatar Lenin did. By enshrining the Regent's unworthy, earthly authority, the stage shall forever be set for you to assume the throne in perpetual, unquestioned peace."
 KOM_burgsys_trustworthy_court_desc: "Every Tsar must have his court; so must regents, logically. We have accumulated a vast number of devoted followers over the decades, from wizened White Émigrés to youthful radicals bursting with vigor. The true path illuminated so many years ago by Regent Taboritsky is now walked by thousands of the faithful.\n\nYet the situation is not as it should be. We have heard disturbing rumors from our little birds who keep watch on the ambitious and the powerful. It seems that certain inclinations have begun to take root recently; inclinations towards dissent, heresy... even treachery. Unfortunate, but villainous courtiers have ever been the lot of good-hearted rulers. Adjustments shall be made, so that Tsarevich Alexei will never face such a threat. Once the fate of traitors becomes known, fear shall permanently cow those who aspired to follow in their footsteps."
 KOM_burgsys_fall_of_the_favorite_desc: "The Regent walks in Christ's footsteps, lighting the way for Russia to follow. He is no Messiah, but he does strive to emulate one. It is not surprising, then, that another man would strive to emulate Judas: Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, an old and dear friend, has become a most problematic element in the imperial court. Speaking with the forked tongue of Satan, he has dared to confront the Regent with 'concerns about his increasingly erratic behaviour'.\n\nCould the machinations of Beelzebub be any more obvious? This is the prelude to a betrayal most foul - no doubt Shabelsky-Bork already has his thirty pieces of silver! All he needs now is a rope of straw that he might be sent, blue-faced and choking, to the same eternal prison as his infernal master. In his place, a younger, more godly man shall be elevated to become the right hand of the Regent."
 KOM_burgsys_towards_absolute_purity_desc: "It is not enough for those who rule to be pure of heart. The lands of Russia are infested with a multitude of vermin: Jews, Tatars, Asiatics. These parasites suckle themselves on the lifeblood of the Empire, growing fat and healthy at the expense of God's chosen people.\n\nNo longer shall the noisome presence of subhumans be tolerated in our holy empire. Time and time again, they have betrayed Russia, always pursuing the allure of wealth and self-aggrandizement. After every betrayal, they beg and plea for their miserable lives, appealing to the good Christian morals of their rightful rulers. Many were thus deceived, but not the Regent. For all their faults, the Germans, guided by God, have shown us the way. With bullets, blades, fire and gas, we shall forever cleanse Russia of its enemies."
 KOM_burgsys_repurpose_the_gulags_desc: "The Bolsheviks, perfidious Jews that they are, have devised many tools with which to oppress God's chosen people. None were so cruel and dehumanizing as the gulags: prison camps in the forgotten reaches of Russia where countless millions were sent to starve or freeze to death in the name of revolution.\n\nHowever, their wicked schemes shall be their final undoing. We shall take their precious gulags from them, round up the subhuman traitors, and drive them into the depths of their own creations! There, they shall toil away until they die, all to our benefit! Turning the weapons of the enemy against him is of grave danger to one's soul - but it is nevertheless a most satisfying thing to do."
 KOM_burgsys_ray_of_light_desc: "The only thing that subhumans hate more than the good and the pure is their own kind. The Germans demonstrated that well during their conquests; Ukrainians, Balts, and Poles were easily manipulated by their new masters into turning their aggressions against the Jewish rats infesting their lands. Why, if not for such unwitting collaboration, the Germans might never have enjoyed such a high degree of success.\n\nWe have learned this lesson well. The inferior races of Russia will be shown the faces of their true oppressors and given a little encouragement. Spurred on by their base, primitive urges, they will no doubt busy themselves with infighting. That will diminish their numbers and make our task far easier to carry out."
 KOM_burgsys_harsh_glare_desc: "The Regent's people need no collaborators or stooges to help bear their burden. Russia has always stood by itself - a lone tree standing defiant against ill winds. Our virtues and strength are all we need to triumph over the subhumans.\n\nWe shall prove it. Jews, Tatars, Kalmyks, Komi, Udmurts, Buryats - none are a match for the iron will of the Russians. They will be rounded up, incarcerated and exterminated down to the last of their mewling, demonic spawn. Some may question our right to slaughter millions; those who understand realize that we have no right to let them live!"
 KOM_burgsys_bounties_on_parasites_desc: "The Regent, blessed as he may be, is not possessed of the Lord's omnipresence. Though he wishes it were not so, he cannot spare the time to be directly involved in the righteous purgation of our lands. In his stead, loyal servants must act - but there is a distinct shortage of such individuals. The commoners must be encouraged to serve him, so that they are prepared to do the same for the Tsarevich.\n\nFor this to happen, they must first be convinced of the necessity of our ideals. The fastest way to a man's heart is by satisfying his material needs, and Russia has so, so many people in dire need. Perhaps incentivizing involvement in our racial holy war would suffice... backed up by necessary reminders of the importance of this mission. After all, he who allows the subhuman to live shares in the crime of its existence."
 KOM_burgsys_glorious_new_day_desc: "What we have accomplished here in the west is only the beginning. From this old heartland of the Empire, the light of our Lord and His earthly representative, Tsarevich Alexei, will shine forth. Soon, it shall illuminate all of Russia, from Malorossiya to Vladivostok. The subhumans will be utterly destroyed and the pure race never again threatened by their ilk.\n\nBut not yet. There is so much more to do, so many evils to vanquish and souls to save. Beyond our borders, false claimants to the rulership of Russia send forth their armies to oppose us. Foolishly, they dismiss our claim to divine sponsorship, refusing to even acknowledge the truth of the Tsarevich's existence. They are wrong, of course, and will know it once we cast them into Hell and establish the eternal Holy Russian Empire across the entirety of its rightful lands!"
 
 KOM_burgsys_wealth_of_russia_desc: "United, Russia would be the largest and wealthiest nation in all of creation. Great swathes of verdant agricultural land stretch from Ukraine to the depths of Eurasia. Beneath the earth, there is a veritable bounty of mineral resources: iron, coal, gold and a thousand more gifts of God besides. Standing above it all, ready to exploit and be exploited in turn, are countless millions of the faithful, meat for the grinder.\n\nSadly, the majority of Russia is out of our reach for now. The Regency must make do with what the Lord has provided us. The entirety of our land's wealth must be put to use immediately and with maximum possible efficiency to begin the reclamation of the lands beyond the Urals."
 KOM_burgsys_tear_down_their_failures_desc: "Nowhere is the degeneracy and failure of Bolshevism more apparent than in its architecture and industry. Hideous concrete edifices, shrines to their inhumanity, litter Russia's idyllic lands. What use is any of this if it fails to adequately glorify Russia and its God?\n\nThere is no other option - it all has to go. It must be torn down and pulverized to dust, with hammers, saws, dynamite... even artillery if necessary. The Lord will never bless our economic endeavours if we permit Red blasphemy to continue existing in any form. The sooner we carry out this cleansing, the more certain we can be of His favor."
 KOM_burgsys_imperial_corporations_desc: "Predictably, the remnants of the Bolshevik economy we have inherited are nothing short of pathetic. Their obsession with ensuring adherence to their mad ideology only impoverished the people of Russia and made them easy prey for the Germans. Little better were their limited attempts at capitalism in a red guise - any man of God knows that capitalists are a threat to the proper hierarchy of a godly society.\n\nWith the Regent's guidance, such pitfalls will be avoided. Total state control is necessary, but turning God's people against one another will achieve little. Let the nobles have their riches, as they deserve, and remind the common folk of the shared duty of the classes. Let Red 'commissariats' and liberal 'free enterprise' give way to the good sense and responsibility of the Imperial Charter Corporations. That is how it always should have been."
 KOM_burgsys_riches_of_the_earth_desc: "Beneath the soil of Russia lies more mineral wealth than we could ever find a use for. The Bolsheviks never exploited this properly - the Lord saw their degenerate atheism and concealed the greatest of creation's riches from their crude machines.\n\nHowever, the land is now worked by God's chosen people! We have thus found no shortage of vital resources such as tungsten, aluminum and iron. These material blessings must be unearthed as quickly and efficiently as possible; thankfully, we have no shortage of strong backs to carry the task out, as well as subhuman fodder for the riskiest work. Only with the mines and pits stripped bare can the Regent see his holy mission fulfilled!"
 KOM_burgsys_confiscation_economy_desc: "There are many in Russia who never deserved to be wealthy. Scheming Jews who plied the wicked trade of moneylending; steppe-dwelling barbarians who pillaged our homes; uppity peasants who forgot their place in society.\n\nThese parasites, and any others of their like, will no longer be permitted to hoard their ill-gotten gains while the Empire is left wanting. Their 'property' is now God's - and, therefore, the Regent's. It shall finally be put to good use, fuelling the reconstruction of a pure, holy Russia while the thieves and subhumans of the world do their penance in mines and factories."
 KOM_burgsys_honor_in_a_humble_life_desc: "The love of money is the root of all evil. What use does a peasant or laborer have for gold, jewels, and fine silks? Why does he need a fine town house, with gilded furniture and a necklace of pearls for his humble wife? What use are any of these things in the face of eternal damnation?\n\nAll the common man needs is provided for him already by the Lord, who created the proper and sanctified order of things. Hard work, prayer, family, absolute faith in God and the Tsar - these things were given unto him by Heaven, and they are not his to reject. This is the rightful lot of all the common folk, and the Regent will see this divine order maintained at any cost."
 KOM_burgsys_grand_industrial_project_desc: "As we are a pious, ascetic nation, we have no need of mass-produced trinkets and baubles to keep the plebeian folk amused. Thus, all the space that would be occupied by light industry and selfish capitalist ventures remains free - free, specifically, for the enormous amounts of heavy industry that we require to make Russia great again.\n\nArms factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, foundries, and quarries are all needed to ignite the fires of industry. All of it, from the smallest operation to the grandest factory complex, will be directed solely towards forging the greatest army Russia has ever seen. Until the Tsarevich reigns supreme over a godly and peaceful land, nothing else is worthy of our efforts."
 KOM_burgsys_build_on_the_ruins_desc: "With only dust and ashes remaining of the Bolsheviks' buildings, we can now begin to construct simpler, more fitting replacements. These new buildings will be designed from the most basic level to glorify God, Russia and the Tsarevich.\n\nAll other concerns are secondary. Whether our new factories and facilities appear safe or practical to the scaled eyes of heretics and traitors is irrelevant. The Regent speaks with God's own voice, and he assures the people that so long as they have faith, they need never fear the dangers that blight the industry of lesser nations. If a man loses his arm in a thresher, or is cooked alive in a blast of steam, he only has himself to blame for lacking sufficient faith in God's protection."
 KOM_burgsys_cathedrals_of_industry_desc: "If modern industry has a major shortcoming, it is the total absence of religion. When workers are toiling their hours away, their ears are filled only with the clamor of machinery. As their hands are so occupied with honest work, so too should their ears be open to holy benedictions and hymns, to soothe their spirits and remind them that laboring for the Regent is a sacred duty.\n\nBut that's not enough. The arms and equipment churned out by our factories will be worse than useless if they are not adequately blessed. For our army to gain the Lord's favor, their gear must be consecrated in His name, and there is no better place to do this than at the source. By assigning a priest to every factory, the proper rites can be conducted and our weapons imbued with divine purpose."
 KOM_burgsys_no_land_untouched_desc: "Oil, one of God's greatest gifts to the chosen race, will be vital in the rebuilding of our empire and the coming wars of reunification. We already have a decent flow of this black gold from sources such as Ukhta, but we need more. Much more.\n\nSurveyors have already found trace amounts in our land; if there are any wellsprings hiding beneath the earth, they must be opened up immediately. God has given the Empire the means to keep its oil industry independent from the Elders of Zion and their Mahometan puppets. The fuel for our engines of war will be just as pure as the pious Russians who drew it forth."
 KOM_burgsys_fill_imperial_treasury_desc: "The Imperial Treasury is beginning to fill, but only at a slow pace. The realities of economics are not lost on the Regent; a solution is required. Trade is naturally out of the question, since it brings with it the risk of Jewish infiltration. Thankfully, there are a number of answers to the money question within our borders.\n\nNaturally, we shall further the practice of seizing property. Russia has no shortage of wicked plutocrats who deserve none of what they possess. There could also be many commoners, some secretly Jewish no doubt, who possess concealed fortunes built up over the years. Whatever the source, it all belongs to the Empire!"
 KOM_burgsys_in_the_green_desc: "Drawing on further divinely-inspired lessons from Kaukasia, the Regent has decreed that the Empire's economy will be purely functional in nature, with no superfluous spending of any sort. Everything of value will be accounted for and placed in the hands of the wise and worthy.\n\nLogically, without any funds going to waste, the Empire will be economically invincible. We will always have enough treasure to keep the coffers topped up and the army fed. God and His Regent will take care of the rest."
 KOM_burgsys_imperial_opulence_desc: "Bolsheviks and other rabble-rousers frequently referred to the grandeur and wealth of the Tsar when they sought to convert gullible peasants. Jealousy is an easily-roused emotion, particularly for intellectually stunted commoners.\n\nWhat they failed to understand is that opulence is only a bad thing when it represents a sinful love of materialism; for example, the overwrought townhouse of a scheming Jew stuffed with gilded furniture. Contrasting this, the opulence associated with imperial rule is perfectly logical and has divine approval. The Lord demands that His temple be the most splendid and beautiful building on Earth; as His living representative, the Tsar (and therefore the Regent) is clearly the intended benefactor of this decree."
 KOM_burgsys_black_budget_desc: "Modern economics are utterly farcical. What use have God and His people for nebulous, flawed and purely man-made terminology? Why should we even pay attention to the words of money-obsessed men in a profession infested with Jews?\n\nThe Regent is possessed of the Lord's sacred wisdom and knows all the world's truths. There are no flaws or errors in our economic programs or policies. Everything has been perfectly calculated with the aid of divine revelation. All that lesser men need to know is this: the economic affairs of the Empire are the exclusive domain of the Regent and his chosen few. Anybody else who attempts to involve themselves is nothing more than Judeo-Bolshevik agitator and will be dealt with appropriately."
 KOM_burgsys_absolute_truth_desc: "Foreigners - mostly Jewish and Masonic puppets, we suspect - frequently wonder aloud how our economy can ever be sustainable. How, without embracing trade with the perfidious subhumans of the world, are we to endure?\n\nThe answer is obvious to all but the most truly stupid people. Gold. Gold is all humanity has ever needed to form the bedrock of an economy. It has been that way for thousands of years, and is ordained by God. Furthermore, we have plenty of it. There are massive vaults, far from the clammy grasp of avaricious Jews, that are filled to bursting with gold and other valuables. This is all we need, and all we shall ever need. How else can one possibly explain our productivity?"
 KOM_burgsys_virtuous_education_desc: "Last but not least of our concerns are the minds of our children. The youths of Russia have long been deprived of a proper education by Judeo-Bolshevik oppression; truly, the Elders of Zion know no limits to their demented schemes.\n\nThe Regent sees their plight and has heard their cries for help. Now, the children of Russia shall have what they need: proper education, from cradle to grave, formulated by the Regent himself for maximum efficiency. It is only right for them to learn every minutiae necessary, that they might correctly serve the Tsarevich when he ascends to the throne. Tended properly, he will never have to hear unwanted questions from a rowdy and ill-minded populace."
 KOM_burgsys_sins_of_the_past_desc: "The 'intellectual' class has never been worthy of the Empire's trust. It is from academia, not the peasantry, that corruptive ideas of equality, Bolshevism and capitalism emerged. They are a perpetual fifth column, a thorn in the side of Russia spreading a vile infection. No longer.\n\nThe only rational and moral solution is a nation-wide purge of these dissidents. Anyone who cannot prove that he is with us in totality is against us - and the Regent has no mercy for the enemies of God. Once they have received their just punishment, a new intellectual order shall be founded on their bones: an order dedicated to true science, purified of demonic materialism."
 
 KOM_burgsys_imperial_army_desc: "Now that Western Russia is fully under our authority, and major internal rivals disposed of, we can finally end our reliance on paramilitaries and the barely-loyal military remnants of the wretched Republic of Komi. Such rabble are undeserving of the Regent's command.\n\nIn their place, the Imperial Army will finally return after nearly fifty years of its absence. It will not be quite the same institution; the weaknesses that plagued it and contributed to its many defeats must be excised. There will be many trials ahead for our reborn empire and the Imperial Army will be the spine that keeps it standing upright. None shall find them wanting."
 KOM_burgsys_no_law_but_the_regents_desc: "There is no international law. That concept was created by the Jews and their minions to protect their evil race from the righteous cleansing they deserve. Lesser claimants to rulership might be swayed by the honeyed lies of Cain's kindred, but the Regent understands that the only valid law is God's. There are no boundaries created by man that cannot be crossed in service of Holy Russia.\n\nThe protests of the feeble and the heathen will no longer be heeded. Chemical weapons are God's gift to the armies of Christendom and no less central to our doctrine than guns, planes and tanks. Once again, they will have their rightful place as standard-issue weapons for the entire military."
 KOM_burgsys_through_the_fog_desc: "Knowledge is power. Only through extensive monitoring of our internal situation do we keep subversives at bay and thus continue to enjoy the Lord's favor. The same is true of our military situation.\n\nOur enemies are far better at concealing themselves from the Regent's burning gaze than the common folk are, but nothing can hide them forever. God has granted man many gifts that allow us to share in His omniscience: sonar, radar, and encryption, just to name a few. The Imperial Army must have access to all of these and more, so that it can never be blindsided by our wicked foes."
 KOM_burgsys_expand_on_the_arsenal_desc: "The Ust-Sysolsk Arsenal is a welcome blessing, its vaults packed from floor to ceiling with canisters of gas and the means to deploy them. However, after running a tally of its inventory, we have found that current supplies are inadequate for regular use.\n\nBut the Lord provides. In a sealed section of the vaults, concealed from the sight of the sinful, we found the greatest gift of all: a supplied and fully functional chemical weapons production plant. Though the facility is small, the acquisition of base ingredients for the creation of gas is a simple matter. Production can therefore almost immediately. The facility is also quite old, and therefore relatively easy to duplicate. Praise God for bestowing such fruits of Heaven upon us!"
 KOM_burgsys_clouds_on_the_horizon_desc: "Though the Germans enjoyed overwhelming success in their invasion of the Soviet Union, they never went far enough. Perhaps they lacked the stomach, or simply the foresight, to ensure the total pacification of their conquests. Yes, their columns of Panzers, Stukas, and gray-clad infantry were impressive. But what if they had embraced the glorious horror of chemical warfare? How many lives could have been saved and degenerates exterminated, if every assault was preceded by a storm of gas-spewing shells, and every defense bolstered with an invisible wall of phosgene?\n\nThe Regent and his army will hold no such reservations. For the preservation of the pure and the utter extermination of the wicked, the liberal use of gas and smoke on the battlefield will be mandated. Protected by the best-quality gas masks and armed with the finest weapons available, Russia's army will be as a legion of avenging angels, scourging the land of Satan's minions."
 KOM_burgsys_officers_for_the_reclamation_desc: "Loyal officers are hard to come by in these times. Officers loyal to the Regent and Empire, harder still. Most professional army men are 'former' Bolsheviks or self-serving mercenaries at heart. They can barely be tolerated in our community of the faithful, let alone trusted with command.\n\nStill, the Lord will guide His servant, as he always has. Perhaps we should turn from the established officer corps and look to the ranks of the faithful for promising candidates. They will need to be strong-willed and pure of heart. More importantly, they must be able to pass our new loyalty tests, instituted just recently by the Regent himself. The cream will always rise to the top in the end."
 KOM_burgsys_lessons_from_the_past_desc: "The Soviets lost primarily due to their degeneracy, but almost as important a factor was their tactics - or lack thereof. Jewish brainwashing totally destroyed the ability of their leaders to think rationally, leaving the Red Army little more than a flock of headless chickens. The common soldiery were no better, stripped of independent thought by years of communist indoctrination. All they could do was throw themselves at the Germans in human waves; a fitting end, but laughably ineffective.\n\nWe are not so foolish. The Russian Empire was never militarily defeated in the Great War; it was brought down from within by the knives of Judas. The brilliance of White Army heroes like Kornilov and Denikin is indisputable, and will be the foundation of our new tactical doctrines. The wisdom of the old Empire will guide us to victory everlasting!"
 KOM_burgsys_demands_for_the_future_desc: "The Imperial Army is now well-equipped and ready for anything, but who knows what machinations the Elders of Zion and their minions might devise next? We have our chemical weapons, but they are of Soviet or even old imperial vintage. We cannot expect them to remain useful in their current form forever.\n\nResearch and development initiatives must begin at once, at the Regent's command. Germany alone could teach us much, but true genius will be only found in the minds of the Regent's chosen. Already, our brilliant engineers and scientists, aided by the Holy Spirit, have proposed a dozen new solutions to the needs of our holy warriors. Ballistic missiles loaded with sarin gas... just one of many ideas that must have been inspired by God Himself!"
 KOM_burgsys_venerate_the_soldiers_desc: "Russians - true Russians, not Bolsheviks or heretics - are the mightiest race the world has ever known. As the Third Rome, the Russian Empire infused the essence of that glorious civilization into the very bones of its children. In our veins flows the blood of Heraclius, Justinian and Constantine the Great. No matter how deprived or misfortunate we might be, we will always remain God's chosen warriors and the purest race in all Creation.\n\nThe Regent decrees that all good people of Russia be made aware of this fact. War is in our blood; within every able-bodied Russian man dwells the martial might of the Archangel Michael! That will be decisively proven, even if every man capable of firing a gun has to be conscripted and scourged until he finds his fighting spirit! In an ideal world, it would never come to that, but mere propaganda may not be enough..."
 KOM_burgsys_loyalty_in_mind_desc: "The Jew is adept at concealing its form from honest eyes. By inveigling itself amongst our race, its spawn take on more Russian physical attributes with each generation. Any one of our soldiers could be a hidden Jew, spreading sentiments of disloyalty and pacifism amongst his intellectually vulnerable comrades.\n\nThanks to God's protection, however, the new Imperial Army will be immune to this. Infiltrators will surface from time to time, but they cannot hide for long. A focus on instilling loyalty, piety and ferocity in battle into the men will both improve our army's quality and fumigate the ranks. In time, the naturally deviant tendencies of the Jew will cause it to inadvertently reveal itself, at which point it can be rooted out and put to the torch. Thus will the eternal faith and glory of the Imperial Army be maintained."
 KOM_burgsys_strength_in_body_desc: "Russians are naturally hardy specimens of superior strength and agility, but there is always room for improvement. The innate superiorities of our race require some coaxing to fully manifest themselves. This is best achieved through a combination of martial education and intense physical training.\n\nTaking notes from the SS, our recruits will be put through the most gruelling, brutal, merciless training programs our generals can conceive. A pure-blooded Russian can endure any level of human suffering imaginable and come out stronger. Even the slightest amount of subhuman blood will cause them to 'wash out' - but that's no great loss. In fact, it only makes the Regent's work easier. The blood always knows."
 KOM_burgsys_purity_in_soul_desc: "Calamity! According to records from before the Regent's assumption of power, there remain a number of men, both soldiers and officers, who are not Russians! Some are even of mixed ancestry, bearing the infernal blood of Tatars, Komi, Finns, and a dozen more wretched subhuman groups! Some are followers of that devil-worshipping Arab prophet! Some are even branded with that most unspeakable of horrors: the Mark of Cain!\n\nNaturally, we will act at once. Perhaps these men thought that their theft of Russian blood would allow them to propagate their corrupted lineage and ideals without our notice. It matters not. From now on, each and every man who joins the Imperial Army must have his bloodline verified as pure, and his upbringing proven free of Jewish or barbarian taint."
 KOM_burgsys_supremacy_in_arms_desc: "Russian steel is second to none in its quality. God's metallic gift can be forged into a variety of weapons that our empire can use to crush infidels, subhumans and anyone else who dares oppose us. Our cathedrals of industry, sanctified and blessed by the purest priests in all Russia, are the only places in the world where arms such as ours can be found.\n\nTanks, rifles, trucks, rockets, grenades. All we ever need will be produced in Russia, by Russian hands through which the Holy Spirit works. Not even the finest German industrial complexes can produce weapons to match ours. The Jews and subhumans will weep at the sight of Heaven-forged doom in the hands of our mighty soldiers!"
 KOM_burgsys_heralds_of_the_empire_desc: "Once, no man of faith would ever dare to imagine flying. God granted the skies to birds, bats and insects, not to humanity. However, clearly He has decreed that it is now permissible for lowly mortals to share in the majesty of flight. If He had not done so, how could the Germans possibly have achieved such success in the air during the Second World War?\n\nIf the gift of flight is so widespread that even Bolsheviks can make use of it now, then we must embrace it wholeheartedly! The Regent wishes for an Imperial Air Force to be established post-haste. He also demands that research into modern plane designs and aerial tactics be made a priority. Clearly, God has granted him a spark of divine brilliance again!"
 KOM_burgsys_black_wings_above_desc: "Our research into bomber tactics and designs was quick to bear fruit, but it was the Regent's ingenious suggestion that spurred on the latest development. Though untested by ourselves or any other earthly power, we expect it to provide astounding results.\n\nChemical weapons, deployed from the air. One shudders to even imagine the sheer power this will provide our military. Villages of subhuman savages pacified without a shot being fired; columns of men swallowed up by choking clouds of mustard gas; entire cities purged of their degenerate inhabitants by a storm of air-dropped sarin bombs! Truly, God must be smiling upon us this day!"
 KOM_burgsys_breaking_the_waves_desc: "Until such a time as God grants us access to our rightful Pacific possessions, we have little need for a navy. Grand ships are, more often than not, mere objects of vanity. Witness the fate of the Vasa and say that it is not so!\n\nIn time, we shall venture forth with more modest efforts - submarines, perhaps, to propagate the threat of chemical bombardments around the world. For now, the Empire needs only a small surface fleet suited for blockade-breaking and escorting convoys. Unimpressive, perhaps, but the Regent would never dare to try and exceed his God-given reach."

 KOM_fascist_compassionate_conservatism_desc: "For the past five decades of Russian history, the nation had undergone sweeping changes. First came the Empire, which vacillated between an autocracy and a constitutional monarchy. Then the Republic came into being, which failed to compromise between the ideals of the founders. Finally, in our lifetimes, the Union - and how has it failed. The nation lay shattered, and the unity between the Russian people was subsumed under the subordination by the elite.\n\nNow that he has come to power in the Republic of Ust-Sysolsk, President Shafarevich has ideas as to how to revive and rejuvenate Russia. Key to his plans is his ideology, that of "Compassionate Conservatism." No longer shall the peoples of Russia be driven against one another by a difference in ideals and class, all shall be one, as God had intended. No longer shall the people rage against their ideals, their pillars of culture, but belong in harmony with the State and the nation. Under the President, a new Russian dawn shall rise, and the failures of the past shall be erased in its light."

 KOM_fascist_national_democracy_desc: "We are building here in the Republic a democracy that will stand the test of time: a democracy tied not just to the voices of the people, but to the very vitality of the Nation itself. To do so, we must introduce new institutions to encourage political participation amongst the masses, especially for the ruralists whose votes we rely on. It is their energy that shall drive the state onwards, and it is their belief that will keep us grounded as we move into the future!\n\nNational voting rallies, a push to civic culture and enthusiastic political rallies will be a start, but be assured: this is the work of a generation."
 KOM_fascist_the_russian_national_party: "The Russian National Party"
 KOM_fascist_the_russian_national_party_desc: "The Passionariyy, President Shafarevich conceded, was a hotbed of new, untested, and appealing ideas. Yet, its most prominent flaw was the division in its ranks. There were the Eurasianists, the Ordosocialists, the Monarchists, and finally, President's very own Compassionate Conservatives. After the Convergence, however, all of these factions fused into one, hitherto unnamed entity. All of the Passionariyy, with its partisanship and ideological differences, now belong under Shafarevich's thumb.\n\nThis is not a time for division. Russia needs a strong, united political force to helm its resurgence. The factions of the Passionariyy shall face two choices: to follow Shafarevich's scheme for unity or be cast out to meet the fates of the liberals, socialists, and communists. All who agree shall constitute this political force: the Russian National Party. With the aid of the democrats who leaned to Shafarevich's side, control should not be hard to establish."
 KOM_fascist_nationwide_participation: "Nationwide Participation"
 KOM_fascist_nationwide_participation_desc: "The Union, the Empire, and the Republic had one thing in common: the lack of participation in politics among the common folk. There were elections, to varying degrees of effect, but by and large, the people did not participate in the political decision-making of the nation. In the absence of such participation, the peoples of Russia had grown restless, with the governments only fulfilling the barest minimum of their mandate. This situation cannot stand any longer, and the President aims to correct the course of the Russian nation.\n\nShafarevich's new political organization, the Russian National Party, shall not be a mere political party. Instead, it shall become the voice and organ of expression for the vibrant and burgeoning ideological thoughts of the populace. Every aspect of life shall become political, and the Party shall exercise its benevolent prerogative to intervene in the interest of its citizens."
 KOM_fascist_a_will_through_solidarity: "A Will through Solidarity"
 KOM_fascist_a_will_through_solidarity_desc: "During the tumultuous times in the Republic, Shafarevich became convinced of the failings of parliamentary systems, with its obsession with factional squabbles and partisan bickering. Under such an arrangement, nothing would ever be done, as politicians put their interests, personal and ideological, before the needs of the nation. The peoples of Russia deserve better than to see progress die on the floor of a Legislature.\n\nThus, a solution. The Russian National Party shall maintain the Legislature, but Shafarevich shall correct its functions to better serve the peoples of Russia. Instead of just parliaments and representatives, the Party shall govern in the workplace - through the idea and spirit of Labor itself. After all, is it not the workers who give their most for Russia, who toil day and night for the betterment of the State? The workers do not need to know the minutiae of the legislative process, for the Party shall take care of them. Rather than elect officials who bicker and squabble, why not a Party that acts in solidarity of their cause?"
 KOM_fascist_restore_constitutional_rule: "Restore Constitutional Rule"
 KOM_fascist_restore_constitutional_rule_desc: "For all its faults, the Republic was a bastion of democratic liberties. Its constitution allowed the formation of so many political schools of thought - a crucial component in any democratic state. During Shafarevich's rise to power, the constitution - and the various bodies that depended on its existence - became suspended, left in the wayside as the Passionariyy strived to maintain stability. As such, the people ask: what shall become of the guarantor of their rights?\n\nThe President could not help but grant the people their wishes. He shall restore the constitution, but not without applying his touch first. Such alteration is necessary to prevent the power struggle that ensued before his ascension as the Commander-in-chief of the nation. His modifications shall ensure that the opposition and the government be able to debate their issues on equal footing, with dissent and violence discarded as a relic of a less civilized age."
 KOM_fascist_right_the_wrongs: "Right the Wrongs"
 KOM_fascist_right_the_wrongs_desc: "Though the constitution is a crucial part of the Republic's democracy, it is not without flaws. While political thoughts and ideologies flourished under its rule, violence also proliferated in the streets of Ust-Sysolsk. It also only catered to a select elite of the upper classes, serving their interests before that of the common folk. Thus, while blood ran through the ditches and sewers of the city, the politicians infested the Legislature, determined to use the lives of the people as yet another ploy to gain political capital.\n\nA rearrangement is necessary. Shafarevich shall contain the excesses and the wrongs of the system. The President and his party ought to have the power needed to ensure that the interests of the government align with those of the people. Only by a harsh but fair hand shall the Republic finally move forward, towards real progress. Not one halted by partisanship and conflict of ideologies, but towards a better tomorrow. Towards a brighter, stabler Russia."
 KOM_fascist_a_will_through_ballot: "A Will through Ballot"
 KOM_fascist_a_will_through_ballot_desc: "The President concedes that parliamentary institutions and processes are necessary towards the realization of a state that is in touch with the people's will. An opposition, in his mind, is a crucial manifestation of checks and balances within a democratic government. If the people disagree with the state, discontent brews under the surface. This dissent must be given a voice, a presence within the Legislature. However, it needs guidance and nurturing to ensure that it would serve the interests of both the state and the people.\n\nThe President and the Party shall allow the opposition to contest the elections. Meanwhile, the state shall do all it can in its power to guide them to an outcome that furthers the interests of voters. Surely, with a little word and education, the people would vote in good faith to the most desirable set of politicians. To ease this transition to a new form of democracy, the President shall also compile the various opposing forces into a single Party. The state does not need pointless debates, but rather useful advice."
 KOM_fascist_ethical_order: "Ethical Order"
 KOM_fascist_ethical_order_desc: "Be it through solidarity with labor or through the will of the ballot, the transformation of the Russian political landscape is finished. The President has established his desired vision for the hierarchy of the nation, that of the Ethical Order. Now nary a citizen in the Republic identifies with a value other than the President's own. Under the grace of Russian patriotism, compromise, and tradition, a new Russia awakens - one that will finally redeem its past and collapse.\n\nThese values guide the political opposition, and its reverbs sound throughout the Republic. Through the medium of civil debate, there can be no violent dissent. In this new political order, a citizen is guaranteed his rights. He has his obligations; he has his privileges. The model citizen needs to only follow in the footsteps of the President and the Party. All his concerns he needs to only voice, and the government shall deliberate. The government represents the people; dissent is impossible."
 KOM_fascist_against_small_nations: "Against 'Small Nations'"
 KOM_fascist_against_small_nations_desc: "For centuries, the peoples that belong in the brotherhood of nations in Russia have been oppressed by a minority. These "small nations," as Shafarevich prefers to name them, have held differing values against the majority: values that do not fit into the frame of the Russian nation. Through the long ages, they have schemed to implant their thoughts and ideas to Russia, but through vivacious endurance and verve of our intelligentsia, we have resisted these subversions of our national ideal.\n\nIt is time to put all doubts of their worth to rest. We shall proclaim our ages-long struggle against these nations. Let Russia be vindictive; let rage course in her veins. Their ideas, their attempts at planting the seeds of dissent and resistance among the people, we shall toss out to the winds. For too long have they become our elites, our rulers. It is time for Russia to assert her own will."
 KOM_fascist_end_elitism: "End Elitism"
 KOM_fascist_end_elitism_desc: "The Empire had its nobility. The Republic had its bourgeoise. The Union had its politburo. All share one thing in common: an unabated desire for power by concentrating it to a select elite fully capable of exercising authority. The fate of Russia was not decided by the people but in the backrooms of political institutions, unseen by anyone but the bureaucrats and the operatives these regimes. Genuine Russian democracy had not been tried before, for it was frustrated and made impossible.\n\nThis obsession with elitism must end. There is a need to review the figures of the past, and the President and his Party would be willing to do so. The ideologies that form the core of support for these elites - be it socialism, fascism, or unenlightened democracy - will be passed down before the government and judged. The government shall be the vigilant guardian of the people - it shall select and guide the common man towards a brighter, more egalitarian future."
 KOM_fascist_turn_to_gods_values: "Turn to God's Values"
 KOM_fascist_turn_to_gods_values_desc: "It was as if Russia had forgotten its progenitor. The traditional values that have governed the order of Russian society lay abandoned, its followers scattered. The mention of morality is regarded as embarrassing, and the youth, having no guidance, turn to decadence and avant-garde art for what passes as moral purpose these days. The state of public conduct is low, everywhere in Russia. Though it is understandable - for, after all, a united Russia had not come into being in the last twenty years - this can no longer stand.\n\nRussia is a Christian nation. It professes no faith to a single Church, and the Party regards it as a mere tool that the nation used to reach maturity. Yet, the values they propagate, that become the benevolent custodian of the Russian soul resonate with the new state thoroughly. For its moral values, the Russian State selects Christian ethics. Russia was, is, and will be a nation built on the foundation of the values of Christ, estranged with the Church though it is."

 KOM_fascist_end_tensions_desc: "It's no secret that Russia is a nation of nations. Though the majority component of it indeed is the Slavs, hundreds of peoples live within its borders, who share little in common with one another. Tensions are, regrettably, inevitable. From the highest levels of privilege to the poverty-invested slums, from the echelons of the government to the homes of the average Russian, bigotry festers. Russia is not an ordered house - its current troubles exacerbate this chaos.\n\nAs such, the President shall promulgate a return to the natural state of things, untainted by the toxic past. The government shall ban racism and xenophobia. Then, shall Russia become a house of civility and unity, where the phobia against the Russian ideal shall not be tolerated. The government shall try the transgressors of this law and sentence them for hate speech. The State endures no bigotry, no persecution aggravated by the small nations or otherwise. Russia is one, and Shafarevich shall ensure its survival."

The small nations have fought us for centuries, desiring to drive away the concept of harmony, and usher in an era of malignant individualism. The Empire, Republic, and the Union - the great manifestations of the Russian spirit and soul, all failed in combating this threat, falling into the traps of factionalism and partisanship.\n\nHowever, with the tensions between the ethnic groups of Russia pacified, there can be no doubt as to what course of action is next for the fledgling State. The President and his Party shall enshrine this new order, this state of newfound harmony. If all the peoples of Russia cooperate, there would be no need for insurrections and rebellions. Any that happen would be the work of troublemakers, puppets of the small nations."
 KOM_fascist_against_technocratic_values: "Against the Technocratic Thinking"
 KOM_fascist_against_technocratic_values_desc: "In Russia, there exists a school of thought that ran contrary to Shafarevich's ideas of harmony and coexistence. To him, technocracy is an enemy to the Russian people and the concept of democracy. How could it not be? Technocracy seeks to tear people out of the fabric of society, and desires to throw out tradition in pursuit of false progress. Free will, therefore, becomes unfree, subject to the whims and algorithms of inhuman, cold machines.\n\nThe State shall reject this idea. Technocratic ideas of progress through technological advancements removes the cultural context of the Russian people. Without the order provided by Russo-Christian values, what would Russians be but a barbaric people who are ruled by and rules through chaos? Death to the ideals of false progress! Death to those who wish to subject the people to the machine will! Russia shall remain free, forevermore."

What remains is a harmony, wrought by the hard work of both the Party and the peoples of Russia. The elitist thought that had so long been prevalent in our politics has been replaced by the values of a Christian state. Small nations, with their narrow worldviews, have been cast out, their ideals defeated and erased.\n\nNow, Russia is sovereign - not only in the political sense. Spiritually, Shafarevich has established a new order: complete independence from ideologies that only seek to destroy and subsume Russian culture and values. All that remains for Shafarevich's State to proceed is to cement this legacy. The Party shall tighten the laws, and the troublemakers shall be no more. Soon, all who oppose Russia shall be gone from her soil."

 KOM_fascist_russian_civilization_upheld_desc: "The Soviet Union is many things to many people. To Shafarevich and the Russian National Party, the period of its rule meant a time where Russian values were under the threat of erasure, to be replaced by the "proletariat culture" - an invention borne out of communist deceit. All the political change that he had advanced, he did with a single goal in mind: the restoration of Russia to the place where its import is the greatest - the hearts of her people.\n\nThe accomplishment of this goal is at hand. With the political and moral spheres aligned to Shafarevich's vision, the last step may finally be undertaken. These spheres, formerly discrete entities, shall be conjoined as one. Morality shall be politics, and politics shall be morality. No more is the need for violent dissent, no more is the demand for uprisings, rebellions. If all are in harmony, Russia shall be safe, her civilization upheld."

Perhaps, in a vacuum, this would have been viable; but the greed of the basest of men within our society and the malevolence of those without exploited this system. Russia's wealth, the peasantry and the rural family, were impoverished as urbanites glutted themselves on excesses so shameful they were almost fetishistic.\n\nNo more!

In the past, a man could work on land he owned and reap the rewards of his own hard day's labour. Today, one can hardly enter any political discussion without discussion of how to industrialize and how to increase production in factories. We must reject such thinking.

If we are to shift into becoming a more agrarian nation, we must combat these false perceptions of the Russian peasant. We should nurture a new image for the farming life, that accentuates the prosperity and independence of the agrarian life. Rather than poor, the peasant is self sufficient. Rather than dirty, the peasant is hard working. Rather than isolated, the peasant is landowning, sharing in the collective ownership of a commune.

The unions and corporations often act very antagonistically towards one another, with the government occasionally acting as a mediator between the two. If the government were more involved in these negotiations between the two, it's likely that these negotiations would result in far fairer and more equitable agreements. Tripartism is in the public's interest."
 KOM_fascist_compassion_before_materialism: "Compassion Before Materialism"
 KOM_fascist_compassion_before_materialism_desc: "There are many businesses that provide essential services or products for our nation as a whole. These are private businesses that can include private hospitals, the few steel foundries we have in our country, or even a private postal service. If it's deemed necessary for the state to function or for the populace to survive in an adequate condition, then the government will assume responsibility for these companies. If they are in danger of collapsing or going bankrupt, the state should be there to prop up these businesses in their time of need."
 KOM_fascist_technical_guidance: "Technical Guidance"
 KOM_fascist_technical_guidance_desc: "Even despite our preference for an agricultural way of life, it is impossible to maintain a modern society without a core of technological intellectuals capable of implementing and utilizing modern technology. As we rebuild our great nation, we will need the expertise of these esteemed men and women if we are to eventually repave the roads and rebuild the schools and return to some level or normality again. With hope, soon our lands will be more prosperous than ever before, maybe even more so than our neighbors in Germany and Japan."
 KOM_fascist_a_renewed_city: "A Renewed City"
 KOM_fascist_a_renewed_city_desc: "Rebuilding the urban areas of Russia will be necessary if we are to ensure the future of our nation, however distasteful urban life may seem to us. After the destruction of the Second World War, followed by over a decade of destructive warlordism, many cities are not only in ruins, but demographically just ruined. Not only have millions died, but many fled to the countryside as city infrastructure providing food and other necessities collapsed. We must bring city infrastructure up to an acceptable level."
 KOM_fascist_prosperity_through_harmony: "Prosperity Through Harmony"
 KOM_fascist_prosperity_through_harmony_desc: "Russia is coming closer to true class cooperation than it has ever in the course of its history. By incorporating the tenets of corporatism and socialism into our administrative philosophy, we have made great strides in creating an equitable society in which the interests of all are protected. Corporations are making money, the workers are making their due, the peasants and farmers are living in a higher quality of life than ever before, and the government has become only more democratic and stable. It is the harmonious cooperation between the classes and interests of the people and big business that has ensured our prosperity, and will continue to ensure it for years to come."
 KOM_fascist_toiling_for_the_community: "Toiling for the Community"
 KOM_fascist_toiling_for_the_community_desc: "There seems to be a mindset amongst the younger generation about their elders, this idea that they toiled under the Tsarist and Soviet regimes before them with little nothing to show for their work. They believe that hard work is a farce! This next generation is shopping up to be the laziest yet. We must show them that this thinking is false. All the hard work they put in will be repaid tenfold in the community that they will be able to participate in. All the work they do is for the public good, not just for them, but for all of us. If they can understand that fact, they will be better motivated to work hard."
 
 KOM_fascist_national_assertiviness: "National Asssertiveness"
 KOM_fascist_national_assertiviness_desc: "After decades of embarrassment and failures and humiliation on the world's stage, after two wars in which millions of our brothers and sisters perished, after over a decades of warlordism and civil war, Russia has arisen from the ashes of the former Soviet Union anew, and empowered. We are still weak, and have much to improve on before we can be considered a superpower like Japan or Germany, but now at least the foundations are laid. We are a sovereign, independent power, and we are here to stay."
 KOM_fascist_diplomacy_without_prejudice: "Diplomacy Without Prejudice"
 KOM_fascist_diplomacy_without_prejudice_desc: "The time has come when we let the world know, that the lawless wastes of Russia are lawless no more, for our government has brought them under its wing. In order to secure ourselves on the stage of international diplomacy, however, we must secure foreign recognition, and, more importantly - alliances.\n\nBut long past are the days of the coalitions, The Entente and the United Nations, where Russia would be subservient to the West, and sacrifice her sons for other powers' victories, or, as it happened in the Second World War, their crushing defeats. Of course, if we are to rebuild the pedestal we once stood on, we aim to not stand alone before this gargantuan task but to work with our future allies without compromising Russia's own sovereignty."
 KOM_fascist_envoy_to_washington: "Envoy to Washington"
 KOM_fascist_envoy_to_washington_desc: "Among the myriad of nations, few dared to oppose the German Reich at the time of its conquests and even fewer do still. Pioneering this fight is another hegemon - The United States of America, and their Organization of Free Nations.\n\nThough some circles in Russia see the U.S. in a negative light, viewing their reluctance to join the war effort against Germany in the past as traitorous cowardice, we have to move past beyond these animosities, as the international realities dictate, that in the existing diplomatic environment, the OFN could be our only real ally against the Nazis. However, while cooperation birthed by convenience would be beneficial to both us and the Americans, they may be reluctant at accepting our unique cultural formation as part of the so-called Free World. It would be therefore to our advantage if we send a delegation to the OFN, and bridge the gap of our differences sooner rather than later."
 KOM_fascist_call_to_conscience: "Call to Conscience"
 KOM_fascist_call_to_conscience_desc: "Historically, Russia's failures in foreign policy came primarily from diplomatic isolation, and lack of cooperation with her allies. As such, our diplomatic efforts must be directed towards preventing disputes between us and our partners in the progressive world.\n\nWhile the OFN mistrusts us for our government's 'authoritarian leanings' they surely cannot deny the plight that Russia undertook in the name of liberty back in 1941. In many ways abandoned by her Western allies, she suffered and bled, and eventually tragically perished under the jackboot of the Reich. We must remind our brothers in arms that this legacy forever ties us together, and we must honor it by never abandoning each other in times of crisis again."
 KOM_fascist_eye_to_europe: "Eye to Europe"
 KOM_fascist_eye_to_europe_desc: "Not all nations in Europe today lie under the German jackboot. There remain a few precious states with whom we share a commonality in our mutual rejection of German hegemony. We must seek out and align ourselves with these nations. Every nation with which we are endeared may become an ally, and the more allies we have, the weaker the German giant becomes. We must keep alert for any who may become a companion of ours in our crusade against Germany. Any rebellious RK or democratic stronghold that remains in free Europe must be approached and supported if given the chance."

 KOM_fascist_journey_to_the_eternal_city_desc: "While to the naked eye, the destinies of Italy and Russia bear quite little resemblance, in truth, they are not that dissimilar, in the sense that both our noble nations share a tragic history of betrayals by those we deemed close allies, and both now hold in their heart a vendetta against the Germans. It is time that we become more than friends of misery, as they provide us with recognition, so we might one day march together against the tyranny of the Third Reich."
 KOM_fascist_the_northern_lights: "The Northern Lights"
 KOM_fascist_the_northern_lights_desc: "Russia and the nations of Scandinavia have intertwined their historical paths since time immemorial, many times as partners and many more as rivals. The day approaches when we have to act as honor-bound allies again, for we will fall divided before our common enemy otherwise.\n\nAnd while the nordic family - the freedom fighters of Norway and Sweden - may not be too eager to broaden their brotherhood, our diplomats will do their best to establish mutual cooperation."
 KOM_fascist_our_new_place_in_the_world: "Our New Place in the World"
 KOM_fascist_our_new_place_in_the_world_desc: "When the West Russian War collapsed we were condemned and left to die, alone, fractious and slowly corroding from within. We were laughed at by all, respected by none, and we watched external enemies poison even our small nation with ideological poison. We were, it was assumed, done for.\n\nThe world has never been so wrong.\n\nWe are back in business, our armies march to fields uncharted since old Moscow burned, and our enemies look to us with increasing fear. Yes, there is a song echoing in the Siberian heartlands, a song of purity and of true freedom and of strength eternal in the Nation that Lives - it is our own, and nothing can drown it out."

 KOM_fascist_patriotic_russian_army_desc: "Our men have triumphed! West Russia is now under the control of a proper Russian government, one interested in the welfare of the Russian people and the defence of our nation from any threat.\n\nOur growing territorial ambitions must be reflected by the new name of our armed forces. The Patriotic Russian Army, as it shall now be known, will march to the depths of Siberia to defend Russians from those that would oppress them. When the time comes, our attention will shift west, to the decadent Germans who continue to tyrannize our people!"

 KOM_fascist_revitalize_the_officer_corps_desc: "The wars of unification have left their mark on our military leadership. Many brave commanders have fallen in battles. Others have been rendered lame and impotent by the shock of arms, and are unable to demonstrate the vital energy necessary to the salvation of Russia.\n\nWe must promote new officers from the ranks, veterans with a proven knack for leadership and a proper devotion to Russia. Our Officer Corps will be revitalized by this injunction of new blood!"
 KOM_fascist_reopen_the_academies: "Re-Open the Academies"
 KOM_fascist_reopen_the_academies_desc: "It is ironic that war has shuttered many of the military academies of western Russia. We must make it a priority to reopen these centers of learning, where the next generation of defenders of the country will be trained.\n\nSome might condemn our hastiness to get the academies back up and running, our willingness to let old educators return to their jobs. We scoff at these critics. Our vetting process has been thorough, and only instructors of good character will teach our future commanders."

 KOM_fascist_failings_of_the_union_desc: "Bukharin's accursed union was a rotten project, a structure designed by members of a russophobic intelligentsia. Bukharin's unwillingness to go all in on military and heavy industry cost the lives of millions of Russians.\n\nWe will do better. Already several military factories are being built or repaired. Our men will not lack weapons to liberate the Russian people."
 KOM_fascist_memories_of_the_liberation_wars: "Memories of the Liberation Wars"
 KOM_fascist_memories_of_the_liberation_wars_desc: "The Liberation Wars to end weak and corrupt regimes and liberate West Russia from tyranny will forever be the founding experience of our Patriotic Russian Army. We must capitalize on this by making an institution of these crucial events.\n\nThe Liberation Wars brought freedom into Russia for the first time in decades. We will remind the nation that the Russians people deserve, freedom and happiness. We will show the world that none can oppress Russians without consequences!"
 KOM_fascist_memories_of_the_german_front: "Memories of the German Front"
 KOM_fascist_memories_of_the_german_front_desc: "Many may not agree with our national democratic ideology. Unfortunately many of our fellow Russians have often been the victims of propaganda from communist regimes for decades.\n\nIf one area creates unity, it's the memory of the wars with Germany. Twice already our brothers have fought German invaders. Our government is the likeliest candidate to face Germany a third and final time. All those who pick up arm to defend Russians are welcome in our nation; we must let this fact be known!"
 KOM_fascist_organic_command_structure: "The Organic Command Structure"
 KOM_fascist_organic_command_structure_desc: "The Bolsheviks sought to align their military theory with their political ideology. While their hateful worldview provided few military advantages to the red army, the idea of aligning a nation's army with how it functions is not a bad one.\n\nOur officer corps can make use of our theories of the organic Russian nation. Each man has their role, every structure its purpose. By designing a solid hierarchy and by equipping the system with secondary fallback structures, we can imbue the Russian people's traditional willingness to defend what's theirs into our increasingly modernized army."
 KOM_fascist_developments_on_the_kalashnikov: "Developments on the Kalashnikov"
 KOM_fascist_developments_on_the_kalashnikov_desc: "The AK-47 is one of the finest rifles to come out of Russia possibly ever. It's cheap to produce, extremely reliable, has replaceable parts, and is simple to understand and use. As it stands, the rifle is unparalleled. This needs to change. While the design is superior in every capacity compared to older rifle models, this is rather unremarkable in the history of rifle developments. The next generation of guns will always be superior to the last, and the Ak-47's excellent design today may become obsolete tomorrow. We mustn't be content to rest on our laurels while rifle technology in other nations surges ahead."
 KOM_fascist_applied_mbt_designs: "Applied MBT Designs"
 KOM_fascist_applied_mbt_designs_desc: "Designing a tank suited for our particular needs is no simple task. Not only must it be reliable enough to trudge through the muddy swamps of Western Russia during Raputitsa, but it also must be fuel efficient enough to operate for enough hours or even a few days without refuelling. Worse yet, any tank we design must have the armor to tank a shell or two from a German tank and hit back just as hard. Our tank technology is now decades behind that of Germany, so developing such a tank will take time. Applying what lessons we learned from the Unification Wars would serve as a starting point at the very least."
 KOM_fascist_modernity_in_function: "Modernity in Function"
 KOM_fascist_modernity_in_function_desc: "The Russian Nation has constantly reinvented itself, time and time again, in response to foreign threats and internal change: it is time to embrace change once again, not to dilute Russia's essence, but to keep it stronger than at the first. We will drive our industries and our governmental institutions to modernize, keeping them rooted to our ruralist values while expanding their administrative capacities.\n\nWith the new concepts of organic bureaucracy being pushed by some of our more enterprising thinkers, we are confident that our slice of Russia shall soon touch the pinnacles of efficiency while keeping itself rooted in Russian soil!"
 KOM_fascist_expand_from_the_army: "Expand from the Army"
 KOM_fascist_expand_from_the_army_desc: "We know how reliable the Army is - from the early days of Passionariyy, much of our grassroots support was drawn from the rank and file in the Officer Corps and the regular infantry. Their model encourages the growth of the values we prize most - discipline, honor, patriotism and courage - and a little innovative borrowing of their training methods will surely produce a Russia that is hardened and pure.\n\nInvestments in the Army and the militarization of much of our civilian life will introduce these concepts from young, starting with our massive uniformed group-alliance, the Young Russian Corps. These pioneers will be the vanguard of a sea change in the Russian constitution - a return to the greatness once embodied in us."
 KOM_fascist_our_pride_of_the_seas: "Our Pride of the Seas"
 KOM_fascist_our_pride_of_the_seas_desc: "The Navy was once laughed out of Government offices as a tool of war. We were landlocked, poor and underdeveloped: how could dreams of a freshwater fleet ever come into fruition? We shelved these thoughts away until we were capable of expanding on them: now, it seems, the time has come for them to blossom.\n\nWe will invest in dockyards and begin construction of a native fleet of our own, developed primarily for coastal navigation and trade-shipping protection: it will be a limited-utility navy, and it will utterly pale in comparison to our rivals, but we all have to start somewhere. Petrograd, after all, was not built in a single day."
 KOM_fascist_reclaiming_the_skies: "Reclaiming the Skies"
 KOM_fascist_reclaiming_the_skies_desc: "The Russian Air Force crumbled as an effective institution after the collapse of the Union, and the ensuing decades have not exactly proven conducive to its rebuilding. Now that we have begun our ascent in the world, it is time to change all this for good! Just as Russia was made strong by its armies, so too shall our skies be kept pure from small-nation parasites by our fighters!\n\nDoing this is, of course, easier said than done. We must begin to overhaul our shattered air infrastructure, including a functioning airway network and our body of aeronautical supplies, for this plan to ever become viable. Even so, we must cling to the dream: one day the skies will echo with Russian again, and they will be our own."

 KOM_natsoc_the_ordosocialist_revolution_desc: "Ordosocialism has prevailed in Western Russia! The superiority of our ideology has been affirmed, and all that's left is to reconquer Russia. Unfortunately, in order to be able to embark upon such a mission, we must first reorganize the state in accordance with Ordosocialist doctrine. We had neglected to do so earlier, in the hopes that the people would fall in line and work with the party, but it appears we were mistaken. The rot of the Suslov and his cosmopolitan illusions reeks still, and if we are to bring Russia back to its former glory and power, it must be cleansed, purified by fire, possibly by firing squad if need be."
 KOM_natsoc_the_party_order_desc: "One must be organized in every endeavor one embarks upon. In this case, we will start with a list. The list will start small, but slowly, as we hear or notice things about the people working in the government, that list will grow. These things might be relatively minor, like the use of certain words or maybe a manner of speech, to egregious things, like professing an interest in a reactionary ideology or even questioning the great Serov. Once that list is complete, we will create another list. This list will have the names of all the people about whom we noticed things. That list will be handed off to a military officer, and then we will no longer have to worry about such people."
 KOM_natsoc_the_dialectics_of_masses_desc: "Our ultimate goal must be, above all other things, to serve the people. And, in order to serve the people, we must understand what the people want. To that end, we will create mass party organizations, with which we shall engage the general populace. These organizations will penetrate society, bringing vast sections of society into the party's net, as well as allowing us a view into the conditions and circumstances in which our people find themselves in. The information we gather will be used to create a plan of action based on these ideas and concerns of the people rooted in Ordosocialism, with the intent of relieving any problems they might have. Hopefully, this will strengthen the party's relationship with the masses."
 KOM_natsoc_the_hand_in_a_velvet_glove_desc: "A state lacking the ability to control its people, lacks the ability to be a state at all. We must expand our network of informants and agents in order to match the pace at which our nation is expanding. Western Russia houses a lot of people, many of which may harbor ill intent to our benevolent regime. In order to amend this, not only must our clandestine agency grow in size, but it must also grow in influence. Our officers and agents must become more active and involved. There should be an officer in every school and an agent in every home. Such a presence will take time and effort, but the results will be well worth it. After all, all we do, we do for the people."
 KOM_natsoc_the_guiding_star_desc: "Ivan Serov is the axis upon which our state spins. He is center stage, the leading man, the guiding light towards which we all gravitate. Sadly, not all see our leader the way we do. Some see him as a tyrant, a monster, even insane. We must do our part to rectify the hearts and minds of these people, and expose the truth about Serov to them. Posters will be printed and hung up, hymns written and sung, and monuments built and dedicated to him. All will know and acknowledge his greatness, and those who don't, or refuse to, will simply no longer be allowed to be a part of this nation."
 KOM_natsoc_the_dictatorship_of_a_newer_type_desc: "Without a clear leader and structure, we cannot hope to succeed in our goals of reuniting Russia and bringing it into the future. The party will be reorganized into a single, centralized, mechanized apparatus from which all orders will come down. The lower echelons of this structure will be most directly in contact with the populace, and will work to implement any laws or orders, effectively acting as a bureaucracy. The upper echelons of the party, culminating in our leader Serov, will assess the data and make decisions based on said information, ultimately acting for the benefit of Russia."
 KOM_natsoc_the_national_pride_of_great_russians_desc: "Russia is a race of proud, strong men and women. For the last thousand years we have suffered, possibly more than any other peoples in history. Famine, winter, plague, and invasion arrived at our doorstep at one point or another, and time and time again we Russians have endured. There is no race of people so great in all the world, certainly not those traitorous dogs who hold Moscow across the border. At one time, our empire was the largest in all the world, and in time, this will be true again."
 KOM_natsoc_heroes_of_the_past_desc: "Russia has a vast and extensive history, one which should be respected and studied. From the Teutonic invasion of the thirteenth century to the Napoleonic wars of the nineteenth to the Great War of decades past, Russia has endured and shall continue to endure into the future. It's important that we remember these heroes of Russia's past and understand how they brought Russia to greatness. Our ancestors did much to make Russia what it once was, and, following in their footsteps, we shall do the same, under the great banner of Ordosocialism."
 KOM_natsoc_revolutionaries_of_the_future_desc: "If we are to teach a new generation of revolutionaries for the future, we must first regale them with stories of revolutionaries of the past. We must reintroduce Marxist teachings into the education curriculum so that our youngest will understand the basis of Ordosocialism and become better citizens of the state. We will teach them of Lenin and his great crusade against the Tsar, the folly of Bukharin and NEP, and the rise of a new Russian state, our Ordosocialist state. These students are to be the future of Russia, let's be sure to teach them well."
 KOM_natsoc_the_state_forming_nation_desc: "Russia, though more divided and separate than it has been in generations, retains one key aspect that no other nation on this Earth can claim. We are Russian. Russia is, in and of itself, exceptional in nature, and the future of this world is inherently intertwined with the future of Russia. When Russia is once again reunited, this time under Ordosocialism, we will assume our role as vanguard against all the evils of the world, whether that be fascism, capitalism, or cosmopolitanism. From the ashes, our Russian state will arise anew."
 KOM_natsoc_the_socialist_unitarism_desc: "The federative institutions that marked the old Soviet regime have no place in our new nation. Not only is such a system of governance inefficient, but it is also a threat to the party. By allowing regional governments to govern themselves under a federal setup, we invite the chance for said governments to work against us, to plot in secret, even to rebel. We mustn't allow it. Additionally, a unitary government will allow for more efficient use of resources and a simplified management of the economy, as all executive decision making and bureaucratic implementation is centralized."
 KOM_natsoc_the_russian_union_desc: "With the Soviet Union of old destroyed, we have been granted an opportunity to reshape what the foundation of the Soviet Union can even be. Our new Soviet nation will, at its core, be a Russian nation first and foremost. Suslov's ideas of a union in which all races are equal is simply unfeasible, given the inherent superiority of the Russian people. These illusions of equality between the races of the Soviet Union is partially what led to its collapse in the first place. Thus, if a new Soviet Union is to be created, it must be created with the Russian people at its core ruling the nation."
 KOM_natsoc_the_national_unity_desc: "Ordosocialism, while already having been extremely successful in its spread across Russia thus far, is rather undefined. That is to say, while the broad strokes of the ideology have been explored, such as the ideas of Russian supremacy and preeminence of the state in society, we have no ideological aspirations. It's easy to say that we should reunite Russia and reconquer Moskowien, ending German influence in Russia once and for all, but what of after? What will our new Russia look like? How should the Russian people strive to be? We must answer these questions."
 KOM_natsoc_the_revolutionary_succession_desc: "Despite what others have said about our ideology, Ordosocialism is very much a leftist ideology. We should embrace this revolutionary, progressive, and socialist identity and use it to our advantage. There are still many who yearn for the old Soviet Union, and believe in the old ways of communism. By embracing the leftist nature of our ideology, we might be able to reach out and integrate them into the cause. Whether they be former Suslovites, hardcore communists, or moderate socialists, we welcome them all with open arms."
 KOM_natsoc_our_own_way_desc: "It is a sad fact that in the earlier years of reunification, proponents of Ordosocialism had to align themselves with right wing groups in order to carry out our ideological goals. Unfortunately, such groups have become a thorn in our side as we have begun to consolidate our political power under Serov. They project the image that the party isn't unified in its goals and ideals, and that projects weakness. They will have to be expelled from the party, and should they continue to be so vocal about their views on Ordosocialism after they leave, then we will have to use other means to deal with them."
 KOM_natsoc_red_white_reconciliation_desc: "Ordosocialism isn't one monolithic mode of thought or ideology. It is an ideology with the capacity to change and adapt. In this case, in order to further the party's interests and influence in Russia at large, we will need to appeal to a broader range of Russians who ascribe to all sorts of politics. To that end, we should seek to incorporate the right wing into the Ordosocialist apparatus of the party. Accepting these people into the fold can only serve to strengthen us in our interests going forward."
 KOM_natsoc_together_to_greatness_desc: "In order to mend the rift that has grown between the leftist Ordosocialists and the right wing Ordosocialists, we should approach some right wing leaders with offers of positions in government. These positions won't be glamorous or particularly powerful, but it would go a long way towards normalizing and improving relations with them. This may slightly weaken Serov's power within the party, but by opening up our candidate selection pool for jobs in the government to people further to the right, we will also be expanding our talent pool, increasing the government's ability to find skilled candidates for jobs."
 KOM_natsoc_the_proletarian_nation_desc: "At the heart of Ordosocialism lies the Russian worker. The proletariat is and will always be the most important aspect of Ordosocialism, and of Russia as a whole. After all, Russia is the birthplace of the revolution, of socialism as a viable ideology. We must cling to this identity, even in the face of the oppressive German and Japanese Empires. The conspiracy of international capital against Russia will be avenged, but only through faith in Russia and the party can this be achieved."
 KOM_natsoc_moral_code_of_the_builder_of_ordosocialism_desc: "1. Loyalty to Ordosocialism, and love of the Russian Motherland.\n2. Conscious work for the good of the society: One who doesn't work, doesn't get to eat.\n3. Care for the collective property, as well as the multiplying of this property.\n4. High consciousness of the social responsibilities, and intolerance to the violation of the social interests.\n5. Collectivism and comradery: one for all, and all for the party.\n6. Humane relationships between party members: One party member is a friend, a comrade and a brother to any other follower of Ordosocialism.\n7. Honesty, ethical cleanliness, as well as simplicity and modesty both in private and public life.\n8. Mutual respect in the family, and care for the upbringing of the children.\n9. Intolerance to injustice, social parasitism, unfairness, careerism, and acquisitiveness against our own peoples.\n10. Loyalty between all the nations of the USSR to Russia.\n11. Intolerance to the enemies of Russia.\n12. Brotherly solidarity to all Russians within our nation."
 KOM_natsoc_the_reawoken_consciousness_desc: "The new Soviet man can be described as a lot of things. He is intelligent and educated, well versed in traditional Marxist-Leninist literature as well as more modern Ordosocialist literature. He is watchful and vigilant, reporting to the proper authorities any misdeeds or crimes he sees. He is patriotic and nationalistic, secure in the knowledge that Russia and the Soviet Union stand higher than any other nations on this Earth. Above all else though, he is loyal, obeying the state and having full faith in Serov's wisdom and guidance. This is the new Soviet man, and you will become him, if not for patriotism, then for your life."
 KOM_natsoc_national_economy_policy_desc: "The former economic policy of the Soviet Union wasn't necessarily bad, it simply wasn't properly suited for military industry production, and it didn't prioritize development of the most important region of the Soviet Union, Russia, as much as it should have. We will rectify this mistake when designing our new economic policy for Russia. This time, all developmental resources will be directed towards the core Russian territory, and this development will focus on military production and construction."
 KOM_natsoc_the_tactical_prudence_desc: "While state ownership of military and heavy industry is both necessary and desirable for both the party and Russia, it may be beneficial for us to allow some private ownership of small businesses and land. It may be distasteful for some in the party to have to relinquish such control, but allowing the people free right to entrepreneurship and private property will help restart the economy and encourage growth. Additionally, if fears of radical ideas infecting the populace in the concern, then they should have no fear. Such entrepreneurs and small business owners will be watched very carefully."
 KOM_natsoc_the_commissars_of_industry_desc: "This idea of workplace democracy is both ridiculous and inefficient. While this notion of workplace democracy may satisfy the worker, it's simply terrible for maximizing productivity from a factory. Our factories will not be run in such a manner. Factories will be run just as our government is, cleanly organized and centralized with a strict hierarchy and chain of command. At the top of this chain is the industrial Commissar. He commands the factory and gives the men day to day instructions and orders. He is the lynchpin of the whole operation, and we must find men who are suitable to take these positions across the country."
 KOM_natsoc_the_national_accountability_desc: "The capitalist system is vile, but if nothing else, it provides great motivation for individuals to succeed. Failure in business or the economy can lead to factories closing or a man losing his job. That sort of fear of failure is excellent for motivation, and we should seek to simulate that concept cost accounting for our planned economy. Factories that don't produce as much as they should or can will be warned once. Continual failure to meet quotas will result in less and less funding, until closure if necessary. Successful factories that meet or even exceed quotas will be rewarded with more resources for them to use and expand with. These factories will be accountable for their own survival."
 KOM_natsoc_one_big_cooperative_desc: "Russia is a large and diverse nation, a fact only accentuated by this period of warlordism. It similarly has a large and diverse economy, with many different players and economic philosophies. Market liberalism, state capitalism, Marxist planned economics, laissez-faire economics, we have it all. However, this diversity of thought is a weakness. Our economic structure is the only correct one, and it would help others to understand this. To that end, we have created an economic union in which all the major economic players of our nation will work with one another. Together, they will pursue the common goals of class consciousness within our nation and work towards an economically productive tomorrow."
 KOM_natsoc_the_refined_gosplan_desc: "The Gosplan was the original central planning committee of the Soviet Union. It was the main driver and planning system behind the Soviet economy, existing from 1921 until its dissolution in '45. The guiding principle behind the Gosplan was the idea of the planned economy, an avenue through which the state could control the economy and ensure prosperity and safety. We will create a new Gosplan, whose focus will be on building our military industrial complex into one of the most formidable on Earth, with productive capabilities to match. Soon, even Germany will be eclipsed by our economic might."
 KOM_natsoc_the_ordosocialist_household_desc: "What did the old Tsarist regime fall so many years ago? A strange question, but one worth asking. It wasn't the brutal treatment of serfs, or Tsar Nicholas' poor leadership, or even the war. In the end, it came down to bread. The people were starving, and when people are wracked with hunger at the brink of death, they will do whatever they think they have to do to fix their situation. Oftentimes, this turns into rage against the government. Agriculture must be a priority in order to avoid such a fate for our government. Farms will be collectivized under state leadership to maximise output, and the people housed in state controlled homes. The Ordosocialist household will be one of plenty."
 KOM_natsoc_the_transformation_of_nature_desc: "Our population is growing, and some within our government predict that we will experience a population boom now that Russia is finally stabilizing again. Soon, our nutritional needs may well surpass our capacity for production. A number of daring plans and ideas for boosting agricultural yields have been put forward in order to address the problem before it ever becomes a real issue. These plans range from clearcutting forests for more agricultural land to a plan that would divert water from rivers feeding into the Aral sea to irrigate new farmlands."
 KOM_natsoc_mending_the_industry_desc: "Russia's industry lies broken after so many years of bombing and internal wars. However, among the rubble lies an opportunity to create a Russia stronger than ever before. Bukharin was a fool and traitor for many reasons, but the most important was in how he handled our industry. His lack of focus on heavy industry meant that when the time came to fight, we had no factories to forge the implements with which to defend ourselves. We will not repeat his mistakes. Reconstruction and economic reorganization are already underway, and this time we will make sure that heavy industry is front and center at the core of our new economy."
 KOM_natsoc_forging_the_shield_and_sword_desc: "As a great man once said, "The only real power comes out the end of a long rifle". Unfortunately, Russia has a severe lack of rifles. In fact, Russia has a severe lack of almost every weapon. Tanks, planes, rifles, and artillery are all in short supply. A similar situation exists with our airfields, naval bases, and defensive fortifications. Simply put, Russia is rather weak right now, and even a relatively small invasion force from Germany could topple us. We must rectify this situation. Resources must be put towards building up our military industry to fend off would be invaders and secure our borders."
 KOM_natsoc_the_revolutionary_adventurism_desc: "The future of the Russian economy lies in the state. Moderate and social democrats warn against the sort of revolutionary political adventurism that we are pushing. They lack the will to fully reject the corporatist and capitalist systems of Italy and the United States. We have no such restrictions. We must continue and expand the process of nationalization in all industries. Under the government's control, we will bring Russia closer to the sort of autarkic self-sufficiency that other nations and Germany have strived towards."
 KOM_natsoc_collective_vanguardism_desc: "The people of Russia must understand that through our collective will, Russia can achieve anything. There is no greater expression of this collective will than the workers collective. The people, working together in thousands of collectives across Russia to form an even greater expression of the people, the state. We must spread this message to the masses. They must understand that they are the engine, the driving force, the power that has brought Russia as far as it has. So long as they believe that they are what's driving our state forward, they won't feel any need to actually seize control."
 KOM_natsoc_attack_at_the_capital_desc: "There can be no private property, businesses, or financial institutions in the new Russia to come. The global conspiracy of capitalist and corporatist nations plotting against us is how we fell last time. Bukharin was far too liberal with the NEP, and we cannot afford to repeat the old fool's mistakes. Private property and institutions will be seized and nationalized at once. Those who volunteer their property quickly and cooperatively will be given rewards, like government positions or a large one time payment. Those who refuse will face execution."
 KOM_natsoc_a_leap_to_the_future_desc: "The introduction of socialism into Russia's economy must be accelerated if we are to protect ourselves from the capitalist and corporatist nations that threaten us on all sides. The idea that we need a grace period as we transition into a planned economic setup is not only foolish, but dangerous. The longer our economy remains open to the world, the more opportunities our enemies will have to exploit our weakness. We have the means and the will to implement socialism into the economy now, and we must if we wish to protect Russia from outside forces."
 KOM_natsoc_total_mobilization_desc: "Total mobilization is an interesting concept. It refers to the complete and total utilization of all resources a state is capable of mobilizing. To engage in the total mobilization of a nation is to convert said nation into an engine of war, consuming men and steel and machinery alike and pumping out soldiers and rifles and tanks and planes. Many nations view total mobilization as a last resort, something to be utilized only when all else has failed. In Ordosocialism, total mobilization is an ideal, a goal to strive towards. Only through the total mobilization of all Russia has to offer can we crush the capitalist and cosmopolitan forces of the world."
 KOM_natsoc_the_red_army_reborn_desc: "The Red Army that once swept across Russia was one that marched with purpose and motivation. That Red Army marched to spread socialism across Russia. It is important that it is understood that the Red Army never stopped marching. That Red Army is our own today, as our army is nothing more than a continuation of the Red Army that came before it. We share the same principles, the same doctrines, and most importantly, we share a similar ideology, one that we're certain the original Red Army would have marched to had they been aware of the Ordosocialism at the time."
 KOM_natsoc_encourage_new_officers_desc: "While the old guard have plenty of experience and knowledge from so many wars in years past, they really aren't the kind of people we want manning our army. Many of them have sworn allegiances a dozen times over to whoever they find themselves working for at the time. Whether it be fascists, traditional communist, capitalists, it matter not to them. All that matters is their safety and comfort, and if it takes a petty allegiance, then they will gladly proclaim allegiance all day and night.\n\nThere are surely hundreds, if not thousands of young, fresh soldiers with knowledge and experience from the Unification Wars as well as the devotion and loyalty towards Ordosocialism needed to be an officer. We should begin promoting these kinds of men to officer positions."
 KOM_natsoc_reinstate_the_commissars_desc: "Political commissars are meant to be among the most loyal and devoted men in our military. Their job is to ensure that the soldiers in our military remain as loyal to Ordosocialism as possible. Due to our former relationship with the right, it wasn't possible to have political commissars of any particular strength or effectiveness. Now, however, with Ordosocialists firmly in control of the government, we can have real political commissars, with loyalty and drive. They will be the vanguard, fighting on the front lines with our men and making sure that treason and disloyalty towards Ordosocialism remains nothing more than a fear, and not a threat."
 KOM_natsoc_an_eye_to_our_history_desc: "The Unification Wars were a gruelling and savage affair, but they served well to hone our military, much like a hunter hones a knife. In the aftermath of such a bloody conflict, we've learned quite a lot, and will be modifying our doctrines based on lessons we learned. We gained experience fighting in the varying terrains of Russia, we learned better how to manage our supply lines, and most importantly, our men got real combat to train with, and we can use their experiences to continue bettering our military. All forces train to win the last war that they fought."
 KOM_natsoc_the_legacy_of_the_great_patriotic_war_desc: "It was always Zhukov and Voroloshilov who had the right of it when it came to military affairs. Their ideas about using mass industrialized combat combined with more traditional Russian Army tactics were revolutionary, and had they implemented those ideas earlier in the war against Germany, we very well may have pushed the Hun back, and even won. We should endeavor to implement their ideas about warfare into our doctrines in an effort to modernise our military. Zhukov and Voroloshilov were great generals, let us not waste their insights."
 KOM_natsoc_the_bleeding_tomorrow_desc: "All forces train to win the last war that they fought, but it's the armies that prepare for the wars of the future that find victory. Technology is advancing at a rate unprecedented in history. It wasn't twenty years ago that the helicopters and intercontinental ballistic missiles we have today seemed like nothing more than science fiction, or twenty years before that when a bomb that could destroy an entire city was but a fantasy. The moral here is that better technology is always being created, and if we don't stay up to date and informed, we're going to learn about these new technologies the hard way. We must prepare for the battlefield of tomorrow. Either we're going to be at the bleeding edge of technology, or we're going to be impaled on it."
 KOM_natsoc_lessons_from_the_red_napoleon_desc: "Tuchachevsky was a genius on the battlefield if there ever was one. He was a giant on the battlefield, easily among the greatest generals of the Second World War and West Russian War. His doctrine regarding discipline and battle tactics was revolutionary in an era that has all but abandoned the excellence in the field. Technology is obviously important, but it's the general, the commander, and the captain with whom the focus should lie. If we can train our men to think on their feet and come up with creative solutions to dangerous situations, then we will have succeeded. The German relies on his guns, his tanks, and his missiles to do all the work, but he never thinks. None of those things will do him any good if he doesn't realize he's already been flanked."
 KOM_natsoc_developments_on_the_kalashnikov_desc: "The AK-47 is one of the finest rifles to come out of Russia possibly ever. It's cheap to produce, extremely reliable, has replaceable parts, and is simple to understand and use. As it stands, the rifle is unparalleled. This needs to change. While the design is superior in every capacity compared to older rifle models, this is rather unremarkable in the history of rifle developments. The next generation of guns will always be superior to the last, and the Ak-47's excellent design today may become obsolete tomorrow. We mustn't be content to rest on our laurels while rifle technology in other nations surges ahead."
 KOM_natsoc_applied_mbt_designs_desc: "Designing a tank suited for our particular needs is no simple task. Not only must it be reliable enough to trudge through the muddy swamps of Western Russia during Raputitsa, but it also must be fuel efficient enough to operate for enough hours or even a few days without refuelling. Worse yet, any tank we design must have the armor to tank a shell or two from a German tank and hit back just as hard. Our tank technology is now decades behind that of Germany, so developing such a tank will take time. Applying what lessons we learned from the Unification Wars would serve as a starting point at the very least."
 KOM_natsoc_away_from_the_ground_desc: "Despite what our generals say, the Army isn't the only branch involved in warfare, and it should not be focused on exclusively. Both our Navy and Air Force are in dire need of attention. Our Air Force is but a shell of the organization it once was decades ago, and that's to say nothing of our Navy, which, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists. It will take several years to bring either into any sort of military capable shape, and several more to match those of Germany or Japan. It will be expensive and time consuming, but rebuilding these branches of the military will be vital to our future success."
 KOM_natsoc_follow_golovkos_footsteps_desc: "Arseniy Golovko was a Soviet admiral who served in the Soviet Navy, specifically as Commander of the Red Banner Northern Fleet during the Second World War. His fleet, while small, served an important role protecting our northern waters in the White Sea. The Nazi's were never able to push with any success in the White Seas as a result of his excellent command, and his fleet even aided in a few offensives. Ultimately, we should hope to imitate his rather successful fleet. Forming a small, efficient commerce protection/raiding Northern Fleet would do us wonders in protecting northern trade during peacetime, and would protect ports and naval supply lines during wartime."
 KOM_natsoc_intelligence_on_the_field_desc: "Field intelligence in the military is arguably more important today than it ever has been in the past. Knowing where your enemy is and whether or not your enemy knows where you are could mean the difference between throwing a few artillery shells at the enemy and receiving a few instead. This distinction is made all the more important by the massive technological gap between us and our enemies. While we might be throwing shells at the enemy, they may see fit to launch missiles at us. Our reconnaissance ability will be vital in the wars to come, and it's important that we recognize this fact."
 KOM_natsoc_wings_over_the_motherland_desc: "The destruction the Luftwaffe has dealt Russia is unimaginable, by all accounts. A sustained, decade long bombing campaign indiscriminately destroying everything over a couple stories tall. The bombing campaign permanently scarred our people, and there isn't a Russian alive without a story to tell from those years. Such a thing can never be allowed to happen again. Our Air Force must become powerful enough to deter even the thought of engaging Russia in the air. Never again will our people see Luftwaffe planes over Russian skies."
 KOM_natsoc_a_new_sun_in_the_east_desc: "The spirit of revolution has been all but crushed worldwide. The oppressive German and Japanese regimes seek to smother anything even resembling a possible revolt or revolution. We must act as a counterbalance to their smothering effect. We will act as the sun to a seed, nourishing the revolutionary spirit and providing sustenance so that it one day might grow into a full blown revolution. A revolution to encompass the whole world, so that one day all oppressed peoples may be freed. Such a dream is a ways off, but all it takes to start is a seed and some sunlight."
 KOM_natsoc_clandestine_services_desc: "Russia needs a clandestine transportation and support network. Specifically, Russia needs the ability to move goods covertly. The goods can be anything, be it armaments, valuable metals, industrial machinery, it just needs to be able to send or acquire these goods surreptitiously. As our state grows more powerful, it will have greater need to be able to source items and materials without notice. The goal is to be able to call upon resources which can be plausibly deniable and difficult to source."
 KOM_natsoc_the_finnish_passage_desc: "Finland has a rather unique economic and political situation as far as European nations go. Finland is one of the only nations in Europe which possesses both access to the German economic bloc as well as its own independence. By permeating Finland with Russian agents, we might hopefully be able to covertly breach the German economic bloc and gain access to their markets. If we can move Russian goods in and out of Russia through Finland, we would successfully be avoiding a White Sea bottleneck as well as providing us a glimpse into the economic activities of Germany."
 KOM_natsoc_a_contest_for_the_netherlands_desc: "The Netherlands is the undisputed capital of the black market underworld. Every product imaginable flows through their markets, from guns to tanks to information to people, the latter of which being the one we are most interested in. We mean people not only in the sense of Dutch trafficking operations which we can use to move around witnesses, agents, and other such assets, but also in the sense of access to powerful and corrupt leaders. Establishing contacts in the Netherlands will help us towards this end."
 KOM_natsoc_the_swiss_connection_desc: "Hitler may very well have been right when he proclaimed so many years ago that the Swiss were the mortal enemies of Germany. Switzerland's global international banking system has a hand in almost every nation, from the United States to Japan to Germany. At this very moment, a network of several Swiss bank accounts are being registered in ours and several other fake names in Geneva, through which our contacts in America will begin dumping Japanese stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. This relationship with Switzerland is already having the looks of being extremely beneficial."
 KOM_natsoc_a_blueprint_for_struggle_desc: "Our unique ideology has put us in a rather compromising position. Most every other nation on this planet would see us fall, whether it be the national socialists in Germany, the fascists in Japan, or the capitalists in America. Thus, we must embrace a doctrine of critical support for any anti-capitalist or anti-colonialist/imperialist movements that might appear in the world.\n\nOur men in intelligence have created a standardized plan to follow in order whenever such a movement, rebellion, or revolution come to our attention. A basic blueprint to follow, which involves immediate shipments of armaments, capital, and advisors to aid in their struggle, in addition to long term volunteer deployments and international funneling of any other resources they might need. We must do everything in our power to aid these revolutions and further destabilize our enemies."
 KOM_natsoc_an_apparatus_for_liberation_desc: "We must turn our state into an efficient machine of worldwide resolution if we are to defeat the Capitalists and Corporatists of the world. Our state intelligence apparatus will have to ascend beyond that of a regional influencer. Our intelligence agency will itself become an international network of liberation movements and freedom fighters cooperating and coordinating under our global umbrella of support. Our global intelligence network will soon become even more influential and powerful than the CIA's."
 KOM_natsoc_saturate_the_west_desc: "A contingent of about 30 of our agents have recently been sent across the border into Moskowien. Their job is to make contact with anti-German activists and revolutionaries in the region. Once we've established connections with these groups, we will begin coordinating them with one another as we start moving supplies into the region. We will have our agents aid these groups in expanding and increasing recruitment. The more people we can radicalize, the better. Our ultimate goal is to prime the region to support Russia when the time comes for war with Germany, which we will attempt to do by energizing and expanding the anti-German movements in the region."
 KOM_natsoc_ensure_a_liquid_border_desc: "The border between Moskowien and Russia has been in flux for decades since the West Russian War. Official maps put the Moskowien-Russian border at the A-A line, despite the fact they haven't controlled Arkhangelsk since '54. Germany has more accurate internal maps, but those were further confused by the mess of warlord states whose borders with each other and Moskowien was always in flux. This liquid border made it exceptionally easy to move agents and other supplies across the border, something we've taken advantage of with some frequency.\n\nUnfortunately, since the unification of West Russia, Germany has made increasingly large scale attempts to pin down where the border is and lock it down, even contacting us for assistance. Given that it's in our best interest to continue Germany's border woes, we've made an effort to be as confusing as possible on the subject. We've had our diplomats tell Germany different information on where we believe the border to be. We've provided false information on geographical landmarks and other such locations on the border. Most impressively, we even uprooted and moved an entire border checkpoint on two occasions in order to confuse German cartographers sent to map the border. The liquid border will remain ensured."
 KOM_natsoc_pollinate_the_steppe_desc: "Kazakhstan and the rest of Central Asia will be invaluable allies in the future. Their position on the continent separates us from German aligned Iran and could provide us an avenue through which we could access India. We must saturate their lands with our own agents, allowing them to infiltrate their governments and orient their foreign policy towards our own ends. We should hope to, in time, have an agent at every level of government, from the low level bureaucrats to the highest level politicians."
 KOM_natsoc_split_the_separatists_desc: "A divided Central Asia is an easily controlled Central Asia. The larger and more unified these nations become, the greater the threat they pose Russia. Therefore we should strive to keep these nations as divided and unstable as possible. Our intelligence advisors suggest it wouldn't be too difficult to play these countries off one another, sparking border conflicts and wars to weaken their overall strength and stability. Our men already have underground supply lines funneling weapons into these countries, and should unification become inevitable, we can be assured it will be a leftist, Ordosocialist aligned nation that succeeds."
 KOM_natsoc_a_mission_abroad_desc: "The Middle East is a powder keg, not unlike the Balkans. There are dozens if not hundreds of insurgency and liberation movements in the area, and the already unstable nature of the region will make it easy to infiltrate, manipulate, and further destabilize. Our men have already made contact with Ba'athist liberation movements across the region, as well as Kurdish separatists specifically in northern Iraq and southern Turkey. Disrupting Middle Eastern politics and pushing it further towards civil war and unrest shouldn't give us too much difficulty."
 KOM_natsoc_of_darkest_africa_desc: "Of all the lands and peoples on this Earth, none have been more so oppressed and humiliated than those in Africa. Whether it be Northern Africa today under the fascist boot of Italy and Iberia or Sub-Saharan Africa which has been under the imperialist, colonialist boot of Europe's various empires for hundreds of years, these people have known naught but pain and suffering. Surely among them there are men and women who would fight for their freedom and independence. Our agents in Africa have told us that there are, and that all we need to do is provide the means for them to do so. These colonies, these bastions of superpower imperialism, cannot be tolerated any longer."

 KOM_ultnat_ideocracy: "The Ideocracy"
 KOM_ultnat_ideocracy_desc: "The core of the Eurasian project must be its mode of governance. Eurasia will be something distinct from any other nation that has preceded it, and will require a very particular structure in order to function correctly.\n\nThis is the Ideocracy: a socio-political structure which places the maintenance of Eurasianist ideology at the forefront of all its endeavours and policies. All other concerns are secondary, for little else exists to bind Eurasia together at this stage of its development."
 
 KOM_ultnat_framework_of_the_grand_design: "Framework of the Grand Design"
 KOM_ultnat_framework_of_the_grand_design_desc: "We require firm foundations and sturdy scaffolding upon which to build our new society. There must be redundancies, backups, contingency plans for anything and everything that might go awry.\n\nThis strong bureaucratic framework will be the backbone of our nation. It must be tailored for maximum efficiency, and solely accountable to the conductor of this grand symphony."

 KOM_ultnat_legion_of_scribes_desc: "Eurasia is, in the main, a scientific project. It will never hold itself together without bureaucrats, administrators and other assorted public servants who account for every detail and keep the machinery of state well-oiled.\n\nOur administrative apparatus, therefore, must be even more expansive than that of the Soviet Union. We need men of every ethnos represented in our territory, covering every possible field of work. Industry, banking, military, R&D, diplomacy, ethnic affairs - nothing can be left to ordinary pencil-pushers!"
 
 KOM_ultnat_interlocking_fields: "Interlocking Fields"
 KOM_ultnat_interlocking_fields_desc: "Like the Eurasian superethnos itself, the concerns of the state and society form a single contiguous whole. Nothing done by a single sub-section of the bureaucracy occurs without affecting another - and if one domino falls, the rest will follow.\n\nThe solution, however, is not to divide the bureaucracy - quite the opposite. Tightening its structure and giving them shared responsibilities will force them to work together more often and therefore become more efficient over time. We can hereby avoid factionalism and the red tape that so often clogs the governments of lesser nations."
 
 KOM_ultnat_spiders_web: "The Spider's Web"
 KOM_ultnat_spiders_web_desc: "Our great guide and saviour was once mockingly referred to as a spider in the politics of the Komi Republic. It was said that to enter the rightist bloc of the Assembly was to entangle oneself in a web of shadows - one which grew ever-tighter around one's throat the deeper one sank into Gumilyov's intrigues.\n\nPerhaps our foes should have been more careful with their insults, for that is exactly how the guide of the revolution would have it. Eurasia is the descendant of a thousand ethnicities and cultures, all caught up in a geographic web that drew close and bound them together. When the same is true for our state, with the lowliest farmer and the highest general alike all bound to the will of our leader, our strength will be unassailable."
 
 KOM_ultnat_puppets_on_silken_strings: "Puppets on Silken Strings"
 KOM_ultnat_puppets_on_silken_strings_desc: "All Eurasians are part of a superethnos, but assimilation shouldn't mean annihilation. Ours is not a degenerate melange of inferior cultures with nothing alike, but a union of races and cultures that remain distinct while being subordinate to a greater whole. So it is with our nation.\n\nThe Bolsheviks failed to properly respect the diverse races of our superethnos. They established the ASSRs not to represent ethnic groups, but to appease their naive workers and ideologues with false promises of self-determination. Leaving aside that self-determination is a degenerate Atlanticist notion, it was an inefficient and pointless system. In their stead, we shall establish the Constituent Ethnostates - a formalized system of the various ethno-political bodies that make up Eurasia itself."
 
 KOM_ultnat_circles_within_circles: "Circles Within Circles"
 KOM_ultnat_circles_within_circles_desc: "Eurasia's government is best designed in a way that mirrors the society it rules. At the center stands the Guide of the Passionarist Revolution. Arrayed around him, growing ever wider, lie the various circles of power. Beneath Gumilyov are the Eurasianist elite; beneath them, the middle-managers such as priests and bureaucrats; beneath them, the peasants; and so on.\n\nSome balk at this stratification of power, but they misunderstand its purpose. This is not a naked power-grab designed to establish a dictatorship, but a return to the natural structure of Eurasian society. Eurasian leaders have no need for 'checks and balances' when they possess a purity of purpose that eclipses all else they might desire."
 
 KOM_ultnat_clarify_ideological_precepts: "Clarify Ideological Precepts"
 KOM_ultnat_clarify_ideological_precepts_desc: "The Ideocracy is still in its infancy, and unsteady on its feet. The threat of unorthodox thought looms large, threatening the Eurasianist grip on power. Ideological deviance is death - but we cannot know what deviance is if the correct ideological standards go undefined.\n\nWithin the halls of power, there are two competing camps on this matter. The first is Gumilyov's personal circle of followers - those who followed in pursuit of the Eurasianist dream from the early days. In line with our guide's original theories, they wish to guarantee the solidarity and equality of all Eurasian ethnic groups. The second is comprised of more traditional Eurasianists, following the ideas of those who preceded Gumilyov himself. They assert the need for the absolute dominance of Russia in the Eurasian project, and enjoy wide support amongst the remnants of Ust-Sysolsk's other rightist blocs."
 
 KOM_ultnat_ethnopluralist_agenda: "Ethnopluralist Agenda"
 KOM_ultnat_ethnopluralist_agenda_desc: "Eurasia is a land of a thousand bloodlines. The spirits of the Russians, Tatars, Mongols, Kazakhs, Buryats and countless more all inhabit the black soil of the Motherland. The Russias are the most numerous - but we are merely first among equals, nothing more.\n\nAcknowledging this reality is our moral duty to the superethnos. Time and again, our brother ethnoses have been persecuted and marginalized by monarchs and Reds, disguising their chauvinism as an effort to civilize. This will continue no longer - from today, all Eurasians will be kin under law."
 
 KOM_ultnat_ethnic_vanguardism: "Ethnic Vanguardism"
 KOM_ultnat_ethnic_vanguardism_desc: "Despite our guide's opposition to the idea, Russian chauvinism has yet to die out in political circles. From the perspective of a racially equitable Eurasia, this is undesirable. However, it must be admitted that our situation is far from the ideal required to achieve the perfect system. Perhaps ceding some ground to the nationalists is worth the cost.\n\nTheir platform is essentially that Russia should retain its traditional role as the supreme power - the supreme ethnos - of Eurasia, and that this role should be codified into law. This is quite out of line with Gumilyov's plans, but political realities must be considered."
 
 KOM_ultnat_ideocratic_elite: "Ideocratic Elite"
 KOM_ultnat_ideocratic_elite_desc: "The guide of the Passionarist Revolution has no desire to rule as a petty tyrant or tsar. He is our spiritual and scientific leader, and understands his limitations well. Nobody, no matter how brilliant or well-intentioned, could ever hope to rule Eurasia alone.\n\nOur leader wishes to cultivate a new elite to ensure the long life and prosperity of Eurasia. Elevated as necessary from the best men that our nation can produce, they will represent every ethnos within Eurasia. These intelligent and learned young men will be gently guided by the leader, and in time will assume his burdens. So it shall be for every generation to come."
 
 KOM_ultnat_singular_will: "A Singular Will"
 KOM_ultnat_singular_will_desc: "The second ideological point propounded by Russian nationalists is that the entire nation should capitulate to a single leader. They look to both the autocratic tradition of the Tsars and the success of dictatorial models in Europe for inspiration. The irony of Eurasianists learning anything of value from the Romano-Germanics is a little sad, but they are very insistent upon this point.\n\nGumilyov's position as Supreme Guide of the Passionarist Revolution will be formally established as head of state in perpetuity. This is most certainly not what he wishes for - but is autocracy not a core part of Eurasian culture?"
 
 KOM_ultnat_elder_sibling: "The Elder Sibling"
 KOM_ultnat_elder_sibling_desc: "Russia is the oldest surviving member of the Eurasian family, and has a responsibility to help its young kin. Abused and denigrated for centuries, there is much healing of relations to be done. Our brother nations need a strong shoulder to lean on - and a big brother to protect them as they develop. Yes, Russia will always be the strongest and most responsible of the ethnoses, but that is the result of historical circumstance, not the pursuit of supremacy. We will respect each and every member of our family, no matter what comes. The other superethnoses have kept us divided far too long."
 
 KOM_ultnat_stern_tutor: "The Stern Tutor"
 KOM_ultnat_stern_tutor_desc: "Russia is not merely the oldest and most powerful of the Eurasian ethnoses - it is the most developed, the most sophisticated and the most civilized. Though our brother nations were mistreated by previous governments, they were always... a little backwards.\n\nThey need a firm hand on their collective shoulder to guide them in the right direction. Russia must accept its role as the prime nation of Eurasia, guiding the lesser ethnoses just as our leader guides us."
 
 KOM_ultnat_graven_in_stone: "Graven in Stone"
 KOM_ultnat_graven_in_stone_desc: "With the ideological details decided upon, we now have a finalized constitution for Eurasia. With the blessing of our revolutionary guide, this will be the foundation for the greatest civilization the world has ever seen.\n\nNaturally, no deviation from this codified Bible of Eurasianism will be tolerated henceforth. For us, the Eurasian Constitution will be the equal of Germany's 'Führerprinzip' - an unbending, unbreakable principle that directs us ever onward to greater glory."
 
 KOM_ultnat_cleanse_unwanted_axioms: "Cleanse Unwanted Axioms"
 KOM_ultnat_cleanse_unwanted_axioms_desc: "Inferior, corruptive Western influences continue to spread within our great nation, much to our shame. Ideals of plutocracy, liberalism and socialism grow like a tumor in the body of our citizenry. There is only one cure: to slice deep with the blade of truth and cut out the cancer.\n\nA campaign of ideological purification will begin immediately. Classrooms, churches, homes - no place is safe from Western poison, but nor is anywhere beyond the reach of our agents! Let the cleansing of our nation begin!"
 
 KOM_ultnat_dismantle_slavophilia: "Dismantle Slavophilia"
 KOM_ultnat_dismantle_slavophilia_desc: "Pan-Slavism is a childish notion. Genetics matters naught - the Czechs, Poles and others are not our brothers. They are not Eurasians. They are fallen Slavs, corrupted by foreign influence and assimilated into the Romano-Germanic superethnos. They are as much an enemy to Eurasia as the Germans or Japanese.\n\nThe fetishistic admiration for our estranged genetic kin must be excised from the Eurasian consciousness. A Eurasian's family is to be found in Central Asia, Caucasia and Siberia, not in the soft and weak lands of Europe. Let the lesser Slavs become 'Aryans' if they wish; let them continue to collaborate. What they do with their miserable lives beyond our borders is no concern of ours."
 
 KOM_ultnat_delineate_the_western_boundary: "Delineate the Western Boundary"
 KOM_ultnat_delineate_the_western_boundary_desc: "Eurasia's borders are set in stone - literally. The motions of the Earth have conspired to give us precise and expansive natural borders. The Carpathians, the Caucasus, the Tarim Basin - all hemmed in neatly by the Baltic, the Arctic Circle and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFor now, what concerns us most in the western border. That lies along the Baltic coastline and the Carpathians. Nothing beyond that line is worth possessing. Everything behind that line - the land, the people, the resources - belongs to us, to be utilized as the state sees fit."
 
 KOM_ultnat_weeds_in_the_garden: "Weeds in the Garden"
 KOM_ultnat_weeds_in_the_garden_desc: "Eurasianism has many competitors in the race to secure the minds of our people. Both foreign and home-grown ideas proliferate our culture and ethnic consciousness. Even our own allies, in the days of the Komi Republic, were subject to these poisonous, fallacious ideologies.\n\nThis will not do. There is room in Eurasia for only one vision, one mind, one purpose. No voice besides the Guide of the Passionarist Revolution matters. Anyone who claims otherwise must be smothered, their words consigned to the dustbin of history."
 
 KOM_ultnat_parasite_chimera: "Parasite Chimera"
 KOM_ultnat_parasite_chimera_desc: "Eurasia is infested with a foreign parasite: an ethnos of tradesmen and hucksters who inveigle themselves into our blood and our nation. This ethnos lacks a home of its own, and so they wander the world like a migratory infestation of lice. They care only for profit, and so carry with them a panoply of invented and foreign ideas to influence our civilization to suit their purposes.\n\nIn truth, it isn't entirely their fault; the vagaries of evolution have led to them becoming a race of vampires. Still, as foreigners they have no place in Eurasia and must be expelled post-haste. Perhaps they will find a home and stop bothering us, or else settle amongst some more gullible race than ours. Either way, they shan't be our problem for much longer."
 
 KOM_ultnat_happy_symbiosis: "Happy Symbiosis"
 KOM_ultnat_happy_symbiosis_desc: "Now that Atlanticist, Romano-Germanic and vampiric influences have been purged from our nation, we can finally turn inward and begin building what has been denied us for centuries. At long last, the Eurasian superethnos is in charge of its own nation. No longer do we need to fear foreign taint reducing our people to feeble, 'freedom'-obsessed weaklings.\n\nIt always should have been this way. Had we learned sooner - fostered solidarity rather than hatred towards our own kind - we might never have fallen from grace. But none of that matters now. In the end, nobody could stop us. The Eurasian superethnos ascends, and all the world trembles before the raging fire of our Passionarity!"
 
 KOM_ultnat_heritage_for_the_future: "Heritage for the Future"
 KOM_ultnat_heritage_for_the_future_desc: "The Eurasian State is young and fragile. At this stage, a single well-placed shot could see the nation fall along with its founder. This cannot be permitted to happen - not after all we have done in the name of unity and strength!\n\nTo preserve the heritage of Eurasia and ensure no future generations forsake it, Eurasianism must become the core of our education system. Every single child will learn their proper place and be indoctrinated in the correct methods of Eurasianist thought. Never again will faint-hearted questions cause us to lose our way."
 
 KOM_ultnat_establish_the_masterocracy: "Establish the Masterocracy"
 KOM_ultnat_establish_the_masterocracy_desc: "Soviet Marxism made countless mistakes, but the greatest of them all was the core of socialism itself: the attempted breakdown of the existing societal structure. The Bolsheviks thought that their programs would lead to all Eurasian citizens becoming a homogenous ethno-economic whole. Where did that lead them? To economic ruin, defeat at the hands of Germany and the total collapse of their state.\n\nThey had it wrong from the very beginning. Russia already had a functional socio-economic structure that served it well. Only the mistakes of the Tsars and their failure to extend the system to all Eurasia caused it to cease functioning correctly. This 'Masterocracy' must be re-established and society stratified along the correct economic lines again."
 
 KOM_ultnat_top_down_economic_management: "Top-Down Economic Management"
 KOM_ultnat_top_down_economic_management_desc: "Liberal capitalism is ephemeral and foolish. The Atlanticists have shown us the kind of economic disasters that occur as the result of unrestrained plutocrats running wild. Perhaps if they had kept their pigs penned up, they wouldn't have lost to the Germans.\n\nEurasia will avoid the same mistakes. Only the state and proven members of the national elite should have the right to manage substantial sums of money. True ideologues can surely be trusted to set aside their materialist desires and do what is best for the nation."
 
 KOM_ultnat_fuel_the_fires: "Fuel the Fires"
 KOM_ultnat_fuel_the_fires_desc: "The soil and stone of Eurasia hides more than just the bones of our forebears. Pooled in the depths of the earth is a veritable bounty of oil, heretofore unexploited. The fires of war call for ever more fuel - let us provide it!\n\nOperations will commence in Samara, Ukhta and anywhere else we can find this precious black gold. Recent events have proven that great powers live and die by their oil supply. Eurasia's future demands that we squeeze every drop from our soil!"
 
 KOM_ultnat_state_resource_monopolies: "State Resource Monopolies"
 KOM_ultnat_state_resource_monopolies_desc: "Witness our enemies, and how they foolishly place their strategic resources in the hands of private individuals. What madness grips the Romano-Germanic and Atlanticist souls, that they consider this to be wise? They only hasten their downfall by ceding power to resource barons and wealthy shareholders.\n\nHowever there is a place for private corporations in the resource industry: at the side of the state bureaucracy! The state will hand out contracts for extraction and refinement so that every corporation and concern has the chance to prove its value. The best of the lot will be duly rewarded with further contracts, binding them ever closer to the apparatus of state."
 
 KOM_ultnat_for_the_states_prosperity: "For the State's Prosperity"
 KOM_ultnat_for_the_states_prosperity_desc: "The Eurasian commoner is an austere, hardy specimen. His ancestors were steppe warriors who lived off the land and doughty peasants who carved out a homeland in the forests of old Russia. He knows in his heart that he has no need for easy living or foreign luxuries.\n\nOur state shall return to tradition and enforce this spartan lifestyle by law. Only the Eurasianist elite, representatives of our glorious civilization, have any need for wealth and comfortable living. After all, they need to display at all times the finest qualities of the ethnos, part of which is the opulence and grandeur of the old Rus' and nomad nobility."
 
 KOM_ultnat_responsible_economic_authority: "Responsible Economic Authority"
 KOM_ultnat_responsible_economic_authority_desc: "The new economic elites are a double-edged sword; although generally trustworthy owing to their ideological indoctrination, greed has proven a powerful catalyst for treachery in the past. If wealth is power, and power corrupts, then we could very easily have a problem on our hands.\n\nOf course, we aren't so short-sighted and envious as the Bolsheviks. The solution is not to strip the elite of their wealth, but to encourage their close ties with the apparatus of state. That way, our bureaucrats can monitor their activities and ensure they aren't abusing their position. Better still, by tying their wellbeing to that of the establishment, they will develop a vested interest in remaining loyal and following orders."
 
 KOM_ultnat_blueprint_for_hegemony: "The Blueprint for Hegemony"
 KOM_ultnat_blueprint_for_hegemony_desc: "Western Russia has proven a useful testing ground for our new economic order. All appears to be proceeding as our Guide planned. The commoners are less of a drain, the rich are growing richer and the military is keeping everyone in their place.\n\nSoon, we shall extend the correct way of things to every corner of Eurasia. When our fellow ethnoses see the success of the Masterocracy, they will no doubt rush to embrace it. Perhaps they might need some encouragement - but who's going to miss a few dissenting voices?"
 
 KOM_ultnat_industry_of_the_hegemon: "Industry of the Hegemon"
 KOM_ultnat_industry_of_the_hegemon_desc: "Without industry, Eurasia is less than nothing. We have inherited a land almost completely devoid of modern arms production, large-scale mining and heavy industry in general. If the Germans were to return now, our nascent state would crumble like a house built on sand.\n\nThankfully, with our recent territorial acquisitions, we no longer lack the means to establish the industry we need. There are solid foundations for a national-scale economy here already. Our economic ministry believes that we can attain the status of a regional power in fairly short order thanks to the sheer amount of resources present in our lands."
 
 KOM_ultnat_exclusive_right: "The Exclusive Right"
 KOM_ultnat_exclusive_right_desc: "A strong military-industrial complex is necessary for us to match our international rivals, but the influence of private corporations is a matter of great concern to our guide. German, American and Japanese corporations have all flooded impoverished nations with cheap weapons to keep themselves in the green during peacetime. As a result, they hold disproportionate influence around the globe.\n\nWe cannot tolerate our own arms manufacturers similarly enriching themselves at the expense of the nation. While the Eurasianist elite are generally trustworthy, arms production is too dangerous an industry to be left in their hands. The state will retain the exclusive right to produce arms and ammunition of all types, with no exceptions."
 
 KOM_ultnat_factories_or_the_frontlines: "The Factories or the Frontlines"
 KOM_ultnat_factories_or_the_frontlines_desc: "We are not so obsessed with our ideology as to be blinded to reality. While conscription is important for maintaining our strength, not everyone is suitable for military service. That said, there is no room for draft-dodgers and indolent wastrels in our society.\n\nIf a man cannot serve on the frontlines, then he can serve in the factories. Eurasian industry always needs more able hands, willing or otherwise."
 
 KOM_ultnat_small_business_is_state_business: "Small Business is State Business"
 KOM_ultnat_small_business_is_state_business_desc: "The main driver of Atlanticist social mobility is the middle class. It begins innocently enough: a man finds some success as a small-time merchant. He becomes wealthy enough to purchase a shop of his own. In time, he begins to think of himself as above his station, merely because of his material wealth.\n\nSuch is the manner in which Atlanticist values subvert the natural order of Eurasia. It is always the middle class, born from small business, that foments revolution and dilutes our core cultural values. There is room for merchants in Eurasia - but not as an independent and wealthy class of their own. Perhaps heavy taxation and a mountain of red tape will get the message across."
 
 KOM_ultnat_from_owners_to_managers: "From Owners to Managers"
 KOM_ultnat_from_owners_to_managers_desc: "Even though their place in the lower rungs of society is now guaranteed, we can't simply rid ourselves of the services they provide to the populace. Our economic minister has approached Gumilyov with a sublime thought; one that will act as illusory appeasement and also tighten our grip on the economy.\n\nAll these new restrictions and regulations - they're a problem for your struggling business, aren't they? Well, perhaps we can lift a few of them, ease up the taxation... if you agree to a voluntary buyout. So you'll become subservient to a Eurasia-friendly corporation - so what? Your job description will change from 'owner' to 'manager', and you'll have your freedom back. Is that so high a price?"
 
 KOM_ultnat_holistic_economic_order: "Holistic Economic Order"
 KOM_ultnat_holistic_economic_order_desc: "Other nations, even superpowers, tend to make the same mistake over and over again: they think that economic and social policies are different things. Time and again, we've seen where such things lead. The result is invariably either revolution, or a takeover by the over-mighty middle class. Either way, traditional social harmony is destroyed.\n\nOur Guide understands that there should be no distinction between these two policy areas. A holistic approach to our socio-economic order will ensure ideological coherence and keep everyone in their proper place."
 
 KOM_ultnat_feed_the_world_that_matters: "Feed the World that Matters"
 KOM_ultnat_feed_the_world_that_matters_desc: "The downfall of nations begins with empty stomachs. Merchants, particularly of the parasitic kind, are the ones to blame for this. First, they offer the destitute farmer a good price for his harvest; he takes the offer, becoming a willing stooge of liberalism. Then, the merchant gouges the city folk, selling grain at a price just high enough to impoverish them even further! If they cannot pay, then he takes his wares across the border, becoming a traitor to the nation!\n\nNaturally, we will enforce strict laws to prevent this sorry situation from happening ever again. Eurasia must attain absolute agricultural autarky so that no matter what else happens, we will never face a revolution born from starvation. Those who try to sell foodstuffs outside of approved markets, and above the approved price, will face severe consequences."
 
 KOM_ultnat_national_food_dole: "National Food Dole"
 KOM_ultnat_national_food_dole_desc: "As an additional measure to keep the plebs happy, we should take note of a minor Bolshevik success: the food dole. Every good Eurasian citizen, no matter their status, should be able to eat. A portion of all harvests will therefore be placed in the care of the Eurasian Food Bank, so that nobody will ever go hungry in our great society.\n\nThere's no need to go as far as Atlanticist counterparts might, though. The Eurasian commoner is of peasant stock; he only needs the grains and vegetables native to his homeland. Meat, alcohol and other such things are luxuries best left to the deserving."
 
 KOM_ultnat_just_rewards: "Just Rewards"
 KOM_ultnat_just_rewards_desc: "Russia, like the rest of Eurasia, has always had 'haves' and 'have-nots'. This fact is not part of a grand, devious scheme by merchants - it is simply the truth. Why should a man who assembles guns or a peasant who works the fields be more worthy than those who keep our nation running properly?\n\nThe Eurasianist elite is the core of our nation. They are brave, honest, loyal, everything our Guide has come to expect from them - but they are still just men. Temptation can worm its way into even the most valiant of hearts. Reminding them of the value inherent in following our ideals should keep them happy and free from Atlanticist corruption."
 
 KOM_ultnat_promote_natural_values: "Promote Natural Values"
 KOM_ultnat_promote_natural_values_desc: "Purity - Loyalty - Strength. These are the core values of the Eurasian superethnos. They are what set us apart from the Romano-Germanics and Atlanticists. Those inferior peoples have been corrupted by their own modern value systems, spiralling ever downwards to destruction. They betrayed the ancient traditions of humanity in favor of invented systems, and that will be their end.\n\nEurasians need know nothing more than this simple fact: the peasants and workers toil, the soldiers fight, the elites rule. It has always been that way and always will be. Nobody need think or act above or below his station."
 
 KOM_ultnat_special_russian_truth: "A Special Russian Truth"
 KOM_ultnat_special_russian_truth_desc: "Western-influenced critics - most of whom are now where they belong - have decried Eurasianism, claiming that it wishes to establish a permanently unequal society. They say that strangling the middle class prevents economic growth. They say that the peasants and workers are kept in the dark by censorship and political repression. They say that the military is little more than an Asiatic horde designed to destroy our enemies rather than defend the people.\n\nAll these accusations are true - and a damn good thing, too! Why would peasants or laborers be allowed to rule? Why would we allow merchants to become the dominant class? Why would we constrain our glorious army? As we have emphasized countless times, Western ideas of equality are farcical, anti-Russian and a threat to all we hold dear."
 
 KOM_ultnat_eurasian_natural_army: "The Eurasian National Army"
 KOM_ultnat_eurasian_natural_army_desc: "It is time for us to move on from the rag-tag assembly of militias that kept our movement alive in the days of the Komi Republic. Eurasia will be a true nation - and every nation requires an army to guarantee its sovereignty and survival. Today, the Eurasian National Army is born!\n\nRather than seeking to emulate the Western way of war, we shall cultivate a uniquely Eurasian ethos. Our inspiration will be the Druzhina of the Rus' and the hordes of Genghis Khan. The deviant strategy and ethos of the Red Army will pollute our martial tradition no longer."
 
 KOM_ultnat_military_union: "The Military Union"
 KOM_ultnat_military_union_desc: "Eurasia's ethnoses have a shared military tradition - one of ruthlessness, ferocity and unyielding courage. The ancient hero Attila embodied this best. He drew together the Huns, Goths, Avars and other Eurasians, successfully challenging the might of Roman civilization.\n\nAttila's example will be the blueprint for Eurasia's army. Every ethnos - every native ethnos, anyway - will be included as part of a 'military union', a martial reflection of the superethnos itself."
 
 KOM_ultnat_specialized_ethnic_regiments: "Specialized Ethnic Regiments"
 KOM_ultnat_specialized_ethnic_regiments_desc: "History informs us that different ethnoses have different ways of fighting. Steppe peoples are cavalrymen, of course. We Russians are best suited to be infantrymen. The natives of Siberia, used to living off the land, make excellent light infantry.\n\nSimply assigning soldiers to regiments based on Western organizational standards is an exercise in futility. We should establish our formations based on what has traditionally worked best for each respective ethnos. We should also make sure they are properly segregated, of course."
 
 KOM_ultnat_play_to_our_strengths: "Play to Our Strengths"
 KOM_ultnat_play_to_our_strengths_desc: "As a nation lacking in large and accessible coastlines, Eurasia would gain little from attempting to directly imitate existing superpowers. Doing so would also be a betrayal of Eurasianist ideals. We are a nation best suited to land-based warfare; the army should have primacy in all military affairs, with the air force and navy as secondary concerns.\n\nAdditionally, our military doctrine should emphasize what has worked best for us in the past: attrition warfare, scorched earth tactics and strength in numbers. Eurasia's army must be defined by its history, just as the state itself is."
 
 KOM_ultnat_military_passionarity: "Military Passionarity"
 KOM_ultnat_military_passionarity_desc: "The Passionarity of Eurasia is rapidly growing, but its invigorating warmth has yet to permeate our military. The officer corps are more concerned with strategy and tactics, while the common soldiery just want good pay and someone to fight.\n\nOur chief ideologues, working in tandem with ambitious young officers, have proposed a solution. Political officers are common in ideologically-driven regimes like ours, and their effectiveness is proven. Provisionally dubbed the 'Passionarist Commissar Corps of Eurasia', these bold and thoroughly indoctrinated men will shore up morale and propagate Eurasianist ideals among the rank-and-file. They will also make sure the generals don't develop any treasonous ideas, like their Bolshevik predecessors."
 
 KOM_ultnat_encourage_the_heroic_ethic: "Encourage the Heroic Ethic"
 KOM_ultnat_encourage_the_heroic_ethic_desc: "Eurasians in general share something great: like the Saxons and Vikings, our superethnos is possessed of a heroic spirit that drives us to conquest and great martial deeds. Our soldiers must constantly be reminded of their superiority to the foreign peoples of the world, and especially to Atlanticists and Romano-Germanics.\n\nOur new political officers will be instructed to focus on instilling aggression in their men. To kill for one's nation is a great deed; to kill for the superethnos is the height of heroism."
 
 KOM_ultnat_purge_atlanticist_weakness: "Purge Atlanticist Weakness"
 KOM_ultnat_purge_atlanticist_weakness_desc: "The Germans accomplished at least one thing before their fall: they managed to rid their soldiers of weak Atlanticist notions of 'rules of engagement' and 'proper military conduct'. The manner in which our soldiers conduct themselves must be pure and full of Eurasian spirit. We should make sure that they aren't faint-hearted and unwilling to do what must be done when the time for war comes.\n\nThe Germans fear us, referring to us as 'barbarians', spreading lurid propaganda about the Russian propensity for slaughter, rape and pillage. But this is just a matter of perspective. The Slavic way of war, inherited from our Hunnic and Mongol forefathers, is to fight with the utmost ferocity and see that all brave warriors are rewarded appropriately. Any who balk at such things are simply in need of some re-education."
 
 KOM_ultnat_frozen_shores: "Frozen Shores"
 KOM_ultnat_frozen_shores_desc: "Eurasians are generally not seagoing folk. Just look to the disaster that was the Russo-Japanese War for proof of that. Most of our maritime history is limited to fishing and running merchant routes through the Baltic and White Sea.\n\nStill, we recognize the necessity of at least a token naval presence. Though our traditional ice-free ports are out of reach for now, the White Sea remains open to us. We shall formally found the Eurasian National Navy to keep an eye on the frozen north, lest the Germans or Finns ever return."
 
 KOM_ultnat_defensive_fleet_focus: "Defensive Fleet Focus"
 KOM_ultnat_defensive_fleet_focus_desc: "Even once we unite all Eurasia, we likely won't have much use for a large navy. We simply don't have the long, ice-free shores of our rivals, nor do we have any interest in oceanic power projection.\n\nThe Eurasian National Navy should be designed from the ground up to focus on defending our shores from foreign incursion. Air defense, anti-submarine warfare and minelaying should suffice for now."
 
 KOM_ultnat_to_subvert_the_atlanticists: "To Subvert the Atlanticists" 
 KOM_ultnat_to_subvert_the_atlanticists_desc: "Some manner of naval conflict with the Atlanticists and Japanese is inevitable. As the world's naval hegemons, they will undoubtedly try to crush our Pacific ambitions at some point.\n\nThe answer to their enormous surface fleets is obvious: submarines. Submarines are relatively cheap, easily crewed and can do far more than just torpedo convoys these days. We will need them for both offensive and defensive operations when the time comes."
 
 KOM_ultnat_eternal_sky: "The Eternal Sky"
 KOM_ultnat_eternal_sky_desc: "Eurasia is truly vast, as is the blue sky overhead. Not for nothing do many steppe nomads revere the vault of the heavens as a god unto itself. Try as they might, the Germans could never hope to dominate it.\n\nThe Eurasian National Air Force will be secondary only to the army in achieving victory. Eurasia is far too large to police or invade with ground forces alone. We must have a large, modern air force to ensure total coverage of our homeland."
 
 KOM_ultnat_maximize_operational_range: "Maximize Operational Range"
 KOM_ultnat_maximize_operational_range_desc: "It seems that the main barrier to Germany's terror bombing was the sheer amount of landmass they had to cover. Even launching from air bases in Moscow and the Caucasus, they rarely had the range to reach all their intended targets. We can probably thank that fact for their relative ineffectiveness.\n\nHowever, we might face the same problem someday. We are far behind the Germans in terms of aviation technology. Our aeronautics engineers will need to play catch-up, but mustn't simply pursue identical technology to our enemies; they must design aircraft and engines to maximize fuel efficiency and storage. This will allow for the maximum possible operational range, a necessity for the conquest of Eurasia."
 
 KOM_ultnat_strike_the_steppes: "Strike the Steppes"
 KOM_ultnat_strike_the_steppes_desc: "There is nowhere to hide on the steppes of Eurasia. That, combined with its sheer size, is likely the reason that steppe peoples adopted nomadism in the first place. Nowadays, settlements on the steppes are common, but we can also use the steppes' size as part of our military doctrine.\n\nIn the vast, open spaces, columns of infantry and vehicles are highly vulnerable. They might not face a serious threat from nomadic horsemen anymore, but aircraft are a different matter. Without the cover of mountains, forests and cities, our enemies will be easy pickings for specialized CAS aircraft."
 
 KOM_ultnat_eurasian_aerial_hegomony: "Eurasian Aerial Hegemony"
 KOM_ultnat_eurasian_aerial_hegomony_desc: "The secondary purpose of the Eurasian Air Force will be to maintain the hegemony of our state. It has not escaped our Guide's notice that our brother ethnoses can be a little too rebellious for our taste. He doubts war with them will come, but there's no harm in preparation.\n\nThe Germans failed to bomb us into submission, but they succeeded against the British. The Luftwaffe proved that any nation can be bombed to the point of surrender or compliance, provided one has enough ordnance. Perhaps - but hopefully not - we will have to teach our own brothers that lesson as well."
 
 KOM_ultnat_bare_minimum_of_diplomacy: "The Bare Minimum of Diplomacy"
 KOM_ultnat_bare_minimum_of_diplomacy_desc: "We have no desire to entangle ourselves in the global diplomatic web at this time. Eurasia is still disunited, vulnerable to the insidious influence of Atlanticist ideas - not to mention direct intervention, should they believe it warranted. Best to avoid any unwanted commitments for now.\n\nEurasia must focus on building up its inner strength before we step on the world stage. If we are fortunate, our sudden rise to power will come as a bit of a shock to our rivals. Asserting our strength with rapid conquest will certainly earn us a little legitimacy in their eyes."

After all, only the United States and their puppets still oppose the fascist power blocs at a global level.\n\nProper diplomacy is out of the question at this time, but there's no harm in establishing some tentative links. If they acknowledge our legitimacy as the established government of West Russia, we shall do the same for them. That's not much to ask, is it?"

Perhaps a reminder is due? It has been quite some time since the degenerate Romano-Germanic civilization was put in its place.\n\nThe Guide of the Passionarist Revolution himself has elected to carry out this task. As the embodiment of all that is great in the superethnos, this was naturally the right decision. Let's see how well the hubris of our foes receives this particular strike!"

They have been unfairly treated by Russians in the past, an unfortunate outcome of our own ethnos' tendency towards religious fanaticism.\n\nIt's past time that we began trying to make amends with our Islamic brothers. They have just as much reason to hate the Germans as we do, being fellow victims of the terror bombings.

The Romano-Germanic-Asiatic alliance had its clash with the Atlanticists and proved itself the stronger, but that alliance has collapsed and the latter is resurgent. The world stands on a knife's edge, and Eurasia must be the last nation standing when the time for bloodshed comes.\n\nNo matter what happens, we can never trust the other superethnoses. Like us, they look out for themselves first and foremost. Of course, we are the noblest and mightiest of them all, but a cornered rat can still bite. We will never be their friends - but nor are we so foolish as to underestimate them, as they all do each other."

 KOM_serov_a_mission_never_accomplished_desc: "It seems that the tribal age never left the Taiga. The entire region is rural and technologically backwards. Serov will allocate a large portion of the budget to prepare for a push to true mass industrialization, the kind only achievable by a socialist nation. The Tsar failed to tame this land, and so did Bukharin, but Serov will succeed."
 KOM_serov_a_job_left_unfinished_desc: "Bukharin was a coward. Under his pitiful rule, he failed to truly cleanse the military of anti-revolutionary elements, leaving them to their own devices. Soon, his mistake will be rectified. Strict policies will be implemented vetting everybody from the lowliest private to the highest marshall. No longer will men be allowed to hold dangerous revisionist and counter-revolutionary views. Disobedience will be met with corporal or capital punishment."
 KOM_serov_socialism_in_one_country_desc: "Internationalism, that fantasy, is both unrealistic and dangerous. Russia is a land rich in resources and home to a hardy people. We are fully capable of realizing the Motherland's potential without foreign aid. While some preach for a world revolution, they do not understand that other nations are unable to comprehend socialism - it's simply not in their genes. Russians can only count on ourselves, and it will be Russians that lead the glorious National Revolution!"
 KOM_serov_a_socialist_dream_desc: "Serov has not compromised on his original socialist belief: this Russian paradise will have social benefits, a command economy, and use the aesthetics of the old Union. Who else but the Russians truly know Communism, have seen it so close? Only the Russian people can finally achieve that utopian ideal, for they are the only ones who have been so close to reaching it."
 KOM_serov_an_invisible_boot_desc: "The secret police sees all. In the darkest nights, on the coldest days, agents report to Serov. None ever stop watching. However, these disappearances are so well executed that most do not even know of the massive boot above their heads, ready to stamp out "enemies of the state.""
 KOM_serov_and_a_visible_hand_desc: "The old Bolsheviks, in their "New Economic Policy", instituted a small degree of capitalism. After all, Russian corporations would never betray a Russian National Revolution! This will require a large investment, particularly into the economy and bureaucratic elements for such a large charter of government-controlled enterprises. The civilian sector - the men and women that make up our union - will greatly benefit, being prepared for the next great war."
 KOM_serov_whipping_russia_into_shape_desc: "Russians have been hardened by decades of warlordism, so why not capitalize on this? The average Russian is used to living in a mud hovel eating the bare minimum and sleeping at most six hours a day. Harsh conditions build character, so we will allow these conditions to be the standard for a little longer. Creature comforts must be sacrificed to allow for massive industrialization."
 KOM_serov_the_magnificent_red_army_desc: "The Red Army has its flaws, but were it not for their service the very concept of Russia would have been extinguished long ago. The WRRF does not share our ideals, but their officers can be counted upon to take up the righteous cause. We will screen POWs to determine who to keep and who to kill. Through adaptation of every warlord's techniques, we will become unstoppable!"
 KOM_serov_nationalistic_determination_desc: "The Red Army lacks pride in the nation it fights for. The soldiers need to know what they are dying for. Not for valour or pay, but for the survival of the Russian nation! They must be prepared to go to hell and back and sacrifice their life. If they do not, what will become of the Russian people?"
 KOM_serov_communist_tactics_desc: "Adapting the WRRF's tactics and command structure is critical for victory. The Red Army was the only real organized army in West Russia before our ascendance, and we need to make use upon their officers and plans. Communist tactics call for the old strategy of "Deep Battle" - an aggressive theory based upon aggressive warfare and an army with an iron will."
 KOM_serov_class_and_national_emancipation_desc: "The people lie confused, and this must be rectified. They ask, "Does Serov stand with the communists, or the fascists? Does he support a class revolution or a national revolution?" The answer is, of course, obvious; both! But still, the proletariat does not know whether our great leader truly believes in his rhetoric."

 KOM_serov_expanding_the_russian_proleteriat_desc: "Siberia lacks the manpower we need to conduct a revolution. This is due in part to "birth control" and contraceptives, and the actions of a media that suppresses procreation. We will encourage the papers and the radio to promote the national pride inherent in expanding the proletariat. Russia's population will not just grow, it will explode!"
 KOM_serov_the_new_marx_desc: "Word has begun on the street of a new great socialist leader, one to triumph even Bukharin and Lenin. His name is Ivan Serov. He has become the New Karl Marx. His ideas will shape the world for centuries to come. Already, Serov makes proud speeches on this compliment. How may one be humble when he has reached this stature? How can a revolutionary philosopher not preach his philosophy of liberation, of nationalism?"

 KOM_ultnat_drive_into_siberia_desc: "Having conquered much of Western Siberia, we can begin making plans for how we plan to manage these new territories. There are dozens of pre war plans already made we can draw from that deal with the large industrial complexes planned as part of the Siberian Plan. Additionally, several sites have been identified that could be suitable for resource extraction, which can be used to further advance our Siberian industry. There are even plots of land where it may be feasible to begin agricultural operations. Siberia is truly a land of opportunity, and we should endeavor to take advantage of as much of it as we can."
 
 KOM_ultnat_siberian_plenty: "Siberian Plenty"
 KOM_ultnat_siberian_plenty_desc: "The more we learn about Siberia, the more apparent its potential becomes. Every site previously identified for resource extraction ended up being a success, and dozens more have identified since then. With such an abundance of resources and industry, it only follows that investments should be directed towards the further development of Siberia.\n\nSiberia will act as the bedrock of the new Eurasian economy, and if we are to ascend to the status of world power again, we will need to use Siberia for everything it's got."
 
 KOM_ultnat_trans_ural_industry: "Trans-Ural Industry"
 KOM_ultnat_trans_ural_industry_desc: "Conquest of any lands in the modern era is a difficult affair. Not only is it difficult to militarily overcome someone, but it is also difficult to integrate once the lands are in your possession. One concern rarely considered when embarking on such ventures is how a land might be economically integrated into your nation.\n\nIt requires rails to be ripped up and attached to your own network. It requires factories to be reorganized. It requires materials shipments from resource extraction operations to be rerouted. However, if you manage to do all that, your economic output will be maximised, and your newly conquered peoples will feel much more like they're a part of your nation."
 
 KOM_ultnat_black_earths_bounty: "Black Earth's Bounty"
 KOM_ultnat_black_earths_bounty_desc: "Western Siberia has been home to humans for millennia, and has supported agriculture nearly as much of that time as well. The soil in these lands is uniquely rich, and more importantly, almost untouched. The relatively low population has meant that much of this bountiful land has gone unutilized, and thus has remained the abundantly nutritious soil that it was centuries ago.\n\nThe bounties that farmers in the region collect are often far in excess of what they need to survive and are often exported out for the rest of Russia to enjoy."
 
 KOM_ultnat_call_to_agriculture: "The Call to Agriculture"
 KOM_ultnat_call_to_agriculture_desc: "Russia's greatest strength has and always will be its people. More accurately, its population. People are valuable for a variety of reasons. They pay taxes, fight in wars, and the more people you have, the more territory you can lock down with them. Our new territories are quite sparsely populated.\n\nDespite the ample space and farmland available that could sustain a population up to ten times its current size, the rural communities and farms in these areas remain small. We should begin a colonial drive to bring people out to these disparate lands so as to make a life for themselves.\n\nAnyone who moves out to these territories will be given their own lands to farm on, free of charge. Not only will it allow us to bring more of our population safely behind the Urals, but it will also raise the productive capacities of our new territories and increase our food security."
 
 KOM_ultnat_stone_and_steel: "Stone and Steel"
 KOM_ultnat_stone_and_steel_desc: "Our industry is always growing, sucking up more and more resources as factories pop up across the nation to provide an ever expanding array of goods. It is up to us to ensure that the flow of resources continues into these factories.\n\nTo that end, our new administration in the region has been tasked with scouting out potential resource extraction and quarry sites beyond the Urals that might be of interest. Around a dozen major sites have been marked thus far, and the local scouters assure us that more are on the way. We must invest into these sites and begin if we are to keep up our production and continue growing the economy."
 
 KOM_ultnat_lustrous_salvation: "Lustrous Salvation"
 KOM_ultnat_lustrous_salvation_desc: "Gold and silver has been the backbone of almost every major world economy for decades. Gold and silver give a currency stability, and also give a state easily liquefied assets. Our government happens to need such a new supply of gold and silver, as our own supplies have been almost exhausted as we've spread across Russia.\n\nMany of the former warlord states of the east had their own stockpiles of gold and silver squirrelled away before we conquered them. Our troops have been scavenging former warlord capitals in the hopes of finding enough gold and silver to replenish our supplies. Should we be successful, the gold and silver gained will go towards stabilizing our currency and laying the groundwork for the new Eurasian economy."

 KOM_ultnat_forge_fires_burn_desc: "The fires of industry increasingly light up the skies of Russia. Every day that passes sees new factories built and fresh smoke arising from the smokestacks. In Zlatoust today, there lies a row of factories and workshops which have lain empty for months. No light escapes from them because no fires have been lit inside. They were closed during the conquest as our soldiers stormed the cities and declared martial law.\n\nNow however, with the reintegration of Zlatoust and other territories as well as the resumption of civilian administration in these regions, it is time to begin putting those factories back to work."

 KOM_ultnat_make_whole_what_was_sundered_desc: "The resources and opportunities of Siberia are vast and varied, but useless if the region is inaccessible. Rail lines that once connected those disparate lands to our own have been severed during the bombings, or degraded due to years of neglect, and any normal roads that ever existed between our lands has long since deteriorated into nothing.\n\nOld rail lines will be renovated where applicable, and elsewhere new lines will be put down entirely. It may take us stitching together the nation with rail, but soon Russia will be whole again."

 KOM_ultnat_for_all_eurasia_desc: "Our endeavors towards the reunification of these Russian lands has not been in an effort to reunite Russia or the Soviet Union or any other sort of Russian precursor state. The reunifications of Russia is only a means to an end, with the end, of course, being the liberation of Eurasia.\n\nIt would seem, however, that many do not understand this fact. Many see our efforts to reunify rather as an attempt to recreate the Russian Empire or some other such such nonsense. They must realize that all we've done, and all we plan to do, is in the interest of all of Eurasia, not just our piece of it."
 
 KOM_ultnat_all_roads_lead_to_russia: "All Roads Lead to Russia"
 KOM_ultnat_all_roads_lead_to_russia_desc: "Russian nationalists have become rather powerful within our movement. Many Russian nationalists seem to have taken up important positions in our government administration, within our party, and especially within our military.\n\nWhile our efforts are still in the interests of Eurasia and all of its peoples, it might be in our best interest to tone that aspect of our fight in propaganda and public relations materials. Alienating such a large portion of our supporters, especially so many who hold such important positions, could end up working to our detriment."
 
 KOM_ultnat_passion_and_power: "Passion and Power"
 KOM_ultnat_passion_and_power_desc: "Tensions are beginning to mount in our party. Arguments breaking out between our party members has become an almost daily occurrence, and the tone and volume of these confrontations have become increasingly aggressive and loud. However, at the very least, these are instances in which the two groups are communicating.\n\nMost worryingly of all has been the increasing isolation between the two groups, with many in each faction becoming progressively more radical and fanatic in their beliefs. Our party, and the nation at large, is headed towards a crossroads. The path we choose better be chosen by then, or we can expect dire consequences."
 
 KOM_ultnat_family_reunion: "Family Reunion"
 KOM_ultnat_family_reunion_desc: "With our immediate situation secure, we can begin to focus on more diplomatically oriented missions. For example, our neighbors to the south in Central Asia will make for important allies in the coming war with Germany.\n\nEven if they don't fight directly on the battlefield, they can act as a valuable buffer between us and German aligned Iran. Additionally, they could be exceptionally useful when the time comes to liberate the Caucasus. Use of their air bases and ports on the Caspian Sea may prove decisive. We should let them know how eager we are to add to our list of Eurasian allies."
 
 KOM_ultnat_we_bled_for_it: "We Bled for It"
 KOM_ultnat_we_bled_for_it_desc: "Russia fought dozens of wars over sixty years in the early nineteenth century painstakingly conquering and unifying the Caucasus under our rule. The conquest was slow, bloody, and painful, but by the end of that sixty year campaign, we solidly controlled almost all of the Caucasus.\n\nMost importantly, after the conquest, the Caucasus experienced almost a century of peace and prosperity under Russian rule. The Caucasus are as much our rightful territory as Moscow, and will be treated as such in international diplomacy. Russia fought many wars to assert the Caucasus as an integral part of its territory. Those claims remain intact now; the area will be part of Eurasia forevermore."

 KOM_ultnat_break_the_yoke_desc: "The chains of slavery remain draped over the Caucasus, and they will remain there forevermore should the Germans not be expelled from these lands. Inevitably, our armies will sweep through Moskowien and the Caucasus freeing the region, however, our job handling the German Wehrmacht will be made far easier if our brothers and sisters to the south are able to aid us in the fight. We must begin channeling arms and supplies to anti-German groups in the Caucasus in order to prepare for the coming war."
 
 KOM_ultnat_beyond_the_black_legend: "Beyond the Black Legend"
 KOM_ultnat_beyond_the_black_legend_desc: "Many Russians view the people of the steppe as they have for centuries, as evil barbarians plundering and raiding all in their path. This "Black Legend", as it were, is obviously false. The people of the steppe have settled into sedentary life just as we have, and are no more barbarians today than Mengjiang is a Mongol Empire.\n\nThis legend is one of many that divides us. No matter whether someone lives in the steppe, or in the Caucasus, or in Russia proper, we are all Eurasian, and should view each other accordingly. We must begin a domestic campaign to educate the people on this fact, and hopefully destroy the walls of ignorance separating us."

 KOM_ultnat_our_wild_and_mighty_kin_desc: "The lands that once constituted the SSRs of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan now lie as divided as the rest of Russia is today. However, even amongst the warlords of the steppe in Central Asia, there remain potential allies and likeminded leaders.\n\nWe should reach out to their leadership and begin engaging in diplomacy with these nations to the south. If nothing else, our message of peace and cooperation amongst Eurasian nations should endear them to our cause. With time, they may even decide to aid us against Germany."
 
 KOM_ultnat_komplimentarnost: "Komplimentarnost"
 KOM_ultnat_komplimentarnost_desc: "The various ethnicities and cultures that encompassed the former Soviet Union were what we might call Komplementarnost. The term is meant to denote the innate compatibility and complementary nature of these ethnicities.\n\nWeaknesses that some of the races of the Soviet Union had were suitably balanced out by strengths other races had in a similar area. We should emphasize these cultural and ethnic differences, and how through cooperation, these differences make us stronger, even as we keep each race separate in their respective territories."
 
 KOM_ultnat_key_to_sovereignty: "The Key to Sovereignty"
 KOM_ultnat_key_to_sovereignty_desc: "Nuclear weapons are the only guarantor of independence for global powers. The United States surely would have gone to war over Hawaii and its other Pacific territories years ago if it hadn't been for the lingering threat of nuclear war. The same might be said of Italy and Germany. Italy's pursuit of nuclear weapons is in an effort to deter their monstrous neighbor on the northern border. So too must we develop this technology if we wish to ensure our independence. We share two of the largest land borders on Earth with the faction of Germany. If ever a nation were under imminent threat, it would be us."
 
 KOM_ultnat_redemption_for_red_scientists: "Redemption for Red Scientists"
 KOM_ultnat_redemption_for_red_scientists_desc: "One cannot develop a nuclear weapons program without nuclear scientists. It may seem obvious, but it's true, and sadly, we face a severe shortage of said scientists. General education as a whole disintegrated after the Soviet Union collapsed, and even before then, the nuclear sciences was a rather niche field of study. However, that isn't to say it was nonexistent.\n\nRecords from before the collapse indicate that such a nuclear program not too dissimilar to our own had been underway as early as 1942 before ceasing in 1945 with the collapse. We have lists of the names of several of the scientists that worked on the program back then, as well as several other lists of candidates who were considered for the program.\n\nAdditionally, we were able to find faculty lists from several former universities in Russia with atomic research departments with the names of scientists we can use for our nuclear weapons program.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no idea where most of these scientists are today. After the invasion and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, many of them found themselves across Russia as they fled the west. In order to find them, we will have to embark on a nationwide manhunt. Every city, town, and village will be searched, twice over if we must. Those nuclear scientists must be found."
 
 KOM_ultnat_forbidden_no_longer: "Forbidden No Longer"
 KOM_ultnat_forbidden_no_longer_desc: "With Tyumen in our hands, we have gained access to a vast array of old Soviet records from before the war. Interestingly enough, we seem to have stumbled across various files pertaining to the old nuclear program that the Soviet Union had begun during the war, as well as some fragments of data on the tests and progress they made towards the development of a nuclear weapon almost twenty years ago.\n\nIt isn't much, but it could aid us as we develop our own nuclear weapons. We should pass along this newly recovered data and information to the scientists and see what they make of it."
 
 KOM_ultnat_tidings_from_omsk: "Tidings from Omsk"
 KOM_ultnat_tidings_from_omsk_desc: "A few months back, we sent a team of geological surveyors to Omsk in order to assess the possibility of untapped underground resources we could potentially use. In their report, they determined that no significant veins of iron, chromium, or aluminum were to be found, and recommended against setting up mines here for that purpose.\n\nThey additionally mentioned that this recommendation was further supported by the detection of large veins of radioactive uranium in the area, which could make the extraction of other minerals more dangerous. As we speak, a contingent of a hundred men is setting up the preliminary base, and mining operations will be underway by the end of the month."
 
 KOM_ultnat_repurpose_the_bunkers: "Repurpose the Bunkers"
 KOM_ultnat_repurpose_the_bunkers_desc: "Omsk was the home of one of the most secretive organizations in Russian history, the Black League. Even after having defeated the League, we still don't know what their intentions even were. Almost all information relating to Karbyshev and later Yazov's plans were destroyed during the siege of Omsk.\n\nThis secretive attitude was even reflected in their architecture and city planning as well. At the city's core lies a labyrinth of bunkers and subway tunnels which, without a map, is nearly impossible to navigate. Where better to establish a top-secret nuclear program?"
 
 KOM_ultnat_project_blue_sky: "Project: §MBLUE SKY§!"
 KOM_ultnat_project_blue_sky_desc: "With all of the pieces in place, it's time to formally begin our nuclear weapons program. We have the scientists, the uranium, and a site worthy of any world class research program. Its codename is to be §MProject: BLUE SKY§!, poetically named for the high god of Tengriism and Eurasia's endless skies.\n\nSoon, our nuclear capabilities will rival that of any major power, and our presence and influence in Eurasia will overpower both Germany and Japan. Our nation moves closer to reclaiming its title as a major world power."

The might of our arms remains unvanquished despite the assaults of Hell's minions upon our holy nation. The Lord smiles upon His pious servants, and the mandate expands.\n\nBut the Lord's blessings are conditionally granted. He will never grant favor to those who shirk their duties or flee from tribulations. Siberia presents a new challenge to us, but it will not be met with uncertainty and fear - it will be met with an iron resolve, unwavering faith and the edge of a blade!"
 KOM_taboritsky_the_second_cleansing_desc: "Beyond the Urals, countless degenerates found shelter. Amongst criminals, Reds, devil-worshippers, and masterless soldiers, subhumans blend in rather well... but they cannot hide from the faithful.\n\nIt will take much time and effort, but God is on our side. The mountains and forests will offer no refuge. Pure-hearted Siberians, once their faith is renewed, will surely join with us in pursuit of the enemy. We shall achieve what the Israelites could not, and cleanse the promised land in its entirety."
 KOM_taboritsky_the_kaukasian_method_desc: "Thus far, we have utilized conventional means of decontamination: guns, knives, gas, and so on. Unfortunately, none of these are particularly efficient. It takes hours of work to clear a village of undesirables, especially if they have taken measures to conceal themselves.\n\nBut... perhaps there is an alternative. A better way - one that has the same outcome, but with the added benefit of bolstering the output of our farms, factories and mines. The life of a degenerate is worthless, but his labor might not be."
 KOM_taboritsky_define_subhumanity_desc: "We have, since our rise to power, relied only on the direct commands of the Regent in our crusade against impurity. The majority of our policies with regards to subhumans are informal, based on old maxims from the days when our army was merely a paramilitary. This is... not the most efficient system.\n\nThe Regent has been informed of the difficulties that these circumstances have imposed upon us, and has graciously declared that he shall remedy it immediately. The Imperial Codex of Racial Purity, as he has dubbed his divine work, will show God's chosen people the way to Heaven."
 KOM_taboritsky_chemical_terror_bombing_desc: "Many of the Regent's subjects still resent the Germans for their constant bombing raids on our homeland. Of course, that cannot be blamed on the Germans; had the people of Russia shown more faith in God and dedicated themselves to the Regent earlier, perhaps He would have seen fit to spare them from suffering!\n\nAs always, the Blessed Regent has a more nuanced understanding of the matter. The bombings may have been intended to bring the Russians back to God, but for those already enlightened, they were intended to inspire. The latest jet bombers, carrying out blessed purification from miles above this sinful earth - such is the fusion of German tactics and Russian piety! No disloyal village or polluted city in all Siberia is beyond the reach of our sacred arms!"
 KOM_taboritsky_cleanliness_is_godliness_desc: "The poor of Russia are not the poor of which Jesus Christ spoke. The true poor are those who are of the pure race but devoid of all that such a status deserves. Christ would approve of what we are about to do to the unwashed masses who sully our streets.\n\nThe truth, as elucidated by the Blessed Regent, is that the poor are merely degenerate beasts who have escaped judgement for too long. What explanation for their supposed plight can there be besides impiety or Jewish subversion? The Regent knows exactly what must be done: the same as with any other verminous scum that threaten the sanctity of the Empire!"
 KOM_taboritsky_fires_of_redemption_desc: "In terms of crimes against God and Empire, there are few so heinous as blasphemy. Thus saith the Lord: "Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven."\n\nIn times past, all God-fearing Russians knew the correct punishment for this gravest of sins. When their faith began to waver with the arrival of degenerate modernity, they foolishly abandoned it, refusing to harden their hearts even in the face of the blackest sin. The Regent has decreed that we shall tolerate the evil of blasphemy no longer. The appropriate punishment will be reintroduced immediately. Thus do we glorify the Lord."

Bolsheviks and liberals think them 'indispensable' to Russia, and they constantly seek to ingratiate themselves - offering a hand open in friendship with the other concealing a knife behind their back. They have propagated amongst the pure race for so long that they often seem indistinguishable from us. A lesser man might despair at this situation, but not the Regent - for God Himself speaks to him, and has revealed the truth: that no innocent life lost in the pursuit of purity will be in vain. Facing uncertainty, kill them all - God will know His own."
 KOM_taboritsky_the_war_within_desc: "Treason is like a tree. Its leaves, green and filled with life, wave gently in the wind and paint an idyllic picture, while beneath the soil its roots spread like a plague and corrupt all they touch. Even the most pure of Russians is not immune to its vile infection, it seems...\n\nThey gather in their homes, in the streets, in churches. They blaspheme against the Blessed Regent, decrying him as - one can scarcely believe it - a tyrant and a heretic! Even our own holy men have been subverted by the Jewry, condemning His Eminence as a new Antiochus Epiphanes! We know not how our own people could be led astray so easily, but this Jewish devilry must be excised at once!"
 KOM_taboritsky_the_false_shepherds_desc: ""Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the marketplace." Thus spake the Lord. Would that we had heeded His words! Would that the clergy had but a single neck, so that we might strangle it!\n\nThe priests, the nuns, the monks - they have not been so loyal as they dared profess. Their hearts are full of treason, heresy and sympathy for the Jew. We should have known the depths of their evil when they first balked at our cleansing of Holy Russia. What is the price of a priest? How many silver shekels does it cost to turn a holy man against God Himself? We'll set this matter right, no matter how much clerical blood we have to spill to free ourselves from Satanic corruption!"
 KOM_taboritsky_rats_in_the_walls_desc: "Comparisons to cockroaches are most apt to describe subhumans, considering recent news! We have learned that the Shturmoviki are not quite so capable as their commanders claimed - countless thousands of Jews, degenerates, traitors and other vermin have escaped them! Worse still, they have been protected by our own supposedly loyal brothers of the pure race!\n\nIt defies belief that the Regent's own people - God's chosen race! - are so thoroughly corrupted. Is this, too, the doing of Lucifer? What other explanation could there be? The Regent is incapable of error! Whatever the reason, we must meet this challenge with sword in hand! Execute the lying Shturmoviki, redouble our efforts and mete out swift, deadly justice to every Jew-sympathizer we find!"
 KOM_taboritsky_the_purity_order_desc: "The Church can never again be trusted. Even bishops and grandmasters were turned to treason by Jewish gold and Satan's promises of power. There is only one solution: to turn back the clock, to demolish the rotten structure, to burn it all down.\n\nThe Blessed Regent will be as a new Saint Peter - the rock upon which a new, pure church is built. The first step in this process is to ensure the loyalty of our holy men, so that there is no need for another great purge. All that is needed for this is a few good men, drawn from the most loyal of the Shturmoviki. This 'Purity Order' will carry out inspections, provide guidance to local priests and enforce mandatory church attendance. The true faith is not yet lost!"
 KOM_taboritsky_no_such_thing_as_innocence_desc: "Among the Regent's blessings is a fraction of the Lord's omniscience. He knows the hearts of men and imparts this knowledge to his chosen servants. Nobody brought before the Imperial Courts is free of sin; they are wreathed in treachery, heresy flowing in their blood.\n\nA plea of innocence in our courts is therefore guilty of wasting our time, along with whatever other offenses the defendant has committed. There is no need for 'due process' when our judicial system is directly guided by God Himself."
 KOM_taboritsky_villages_of_the_damned_desc: "The traditional hierarchy of the Apostolic Church has been tested and found wanting. The bishops who professed loyalty to the Blessed Regent were traitors to a man, secretly working to hollow out the foundations of our reborn empire. The serpentine spirit of Satan lurks in their hearts. There is only one possible cure for such wickedness.\n\nTo fill the void left by our righteous cleansing, we shall have to elevate new, pure-hearted men in the bishops' stead. With the Church so thoroughly corrupted, we cannot trust any man of the cloth, no matter how lowly. Only the Regent's hand-picked subjects are worthy of bearing the responsibility of shepherding the Lord's flock. His word is God's word, and God knows what is best for His church."
 KOM_taboritsky_the_wages_of_sin_desc: "Romans 6:23 - "For the wages of sin is death."\n\nWe tire of mercy. We tire of traitors going free because their crimes were judged to be insignificant by a soft-spined judge. We tire of our soldiers who, with faintness gripping their hearts, refuse to bring down the executioner's blade on a Jewish neck. We tire of the doubters, dissenters and rabble-rousers in our own inner circle, who whisper of treachery and deviancy behind our back. Yet still they demand it of us, the Devil citing scripture to his purpose.\n\nDeath is a mercy."
 KOM_taboritsky_empire_eternal_desc: "Holy Russia is the true Kingdom of God on Earth. We are utterly unassailable, preserved by the blessing of the Lord. Even the Israel of old pales before our glory!\n\nThere is nothing wrought by man that can threaten us. No weapon can strike us down, no illness can take our Regent, no obstacle can impede our quest to find the Tsarevich. He lives! We live! Holy Russia lives, as it always has and always will, the only pure nation upon this benighted earth!"

This is cause for celebration, for now we have all that we need to advance our special weapons program to the next stage of development.\n\nOur enemies had their own biological weapons programs. Better yet, we have facilities to make use of their designs in the now-liberated Judeo-plutocratic state of Zlatoust. There, new instruments of death will be forged with which to scour the lands of evil."
 KOM_taboritsky_new_concoctions_desc: "Phosgene, mustard gas, and sarin are all capable and useful tools in our arsenal. With these ingenious chemical weapons, entire cities have been subdued and thousands of noisome parasites exterminated.\n\nThe Regent believes that yet more deadly secrets remain to be discovered, and has ordered our chemists and engineers to begin experimentation at once. There are ample supplies of materials at hand, and plenty of learned men who could be pressed into service..."
 KOM_taboritsky_no_lives_wasted_desc: "Not all slaves are useful workers. There are plenty who refuse to take up their tools, make a habit of trying to escape or simply lack the strength to survive hard labor. The usual solution to these problematic individuals is a bullet to the back of the head, but the Regent has devised a brilliant alternative.\n\nAny scientific endeavour requires test subjects. We hear that in degenerate nations like America, small rodents are preferred. Their scientists are weak, feeble - ours recognize that a very specific kind of rat makes for far more interesting and reliable subjects."
 KOM_taboritsky_the_spark_desc: "Recently, we have become enlightened to the existence in our territory of a particular element that has deeply intrigued the Regent. Uranium, a relatively abundant radioactive material that serves as the basis for that which previously lay beyond our reach: nuclear power.\n\nThe Regent is positively giddy with excitement, as are all his most loyal subjects. He has directed large numbers of slaves and all requisite equipment to Omsk, where the largest deposits have been found. Today, we take the first step towards our acquisition of the ultimate weapon."
 KOM_taboritsky_recover_lost_knowledge_desc: "It is said that the Bolsheviks, probably following the urging of their genocidal Jewish overlords, were experimenting with nuclear power before the German invasion. We should thank God that neither they nor the profligate West attained such power before Germany did! As a result of the Soviet collapse, the scientists involved in the nuclear program scattered to the winds - and some have been found hiding amongst the Regent's own subjects.\n\nTheir knowledge will be at our disposal, one way or the other. Scientists are frail, feeble men without the will to endure interrogation. If they will not work for us, we can at least extract the information we need to educate their more loyal colleagues."
 KOM_taboritsky_skyward_swords_desc: "To deliver divine punishment from long range is a beautiful thing. The Germans, Japanese, and Americans all possess the capacity to destroy one another in an instant. They each have an arsenal of nuclear missiles, which combined could raze entire continents in a storm of atomic fire. Despite protestations to the contrary, they probably also have similar systems for the delivery of chemical and biological agents.\n\nOur own rocketry program shall be made a priority. With the right funding and resources, we can build an arsenal that will allow us to engulf entire nations in clouds of billowing, toxic death."
 KOM_taboritsky_sacrificial_lambs_desc: "Testing chemical weapons in a laboratory is simple. With the press of a button, one can immediately see the effects on a human body. Adjustments can be made on the fly, without any of the difficulties involved in testing something like a rocket. For that, we require suitable targets - and, of course, our own subjects are not suitable for this purpose.\n\nThankfully, just over the southern border of our realm, there is a land filled with nothing but degenerate barbarians. Their crude villages dotted along the frontier are oblivious to our might and far from anyone who might protect them. Surely, we speak for everyone when we ask: who will miss them?"
 KOM_taboritsky_heavens_light_desc: "God favors us - he has granted unto us the knowledge with which we can build our very own Sword of Damocles. We have begun along the path leading to that which the Blessed Regent has sought for so long: a weapon to surpass all others.\n\nWhen Tsarevich Alexei assumes the throne, his rule will be unassailable by mortal men. Any threat to his sacred demesne will be met with an unrelenting nuclear firestorm the likes of which none could ever hope to match! Never again - not from now until the end of time - will Bolsheviks, Jews, subhumans or traitors ever threaten the Holy Russian Empire! God wills it!"

 KOM_shafarevich_the_great_uniter_desc: "Every century or so the Russian nation produces a political genius - at even rarer intervals than that, Russia births a unifier, a leader who can embody and guard the values of the Motherland at its time of greatest need. For every Time of Troubles, an Ivan the Great: for every Napoleon, a Catherine. The time of the Unifier is again at hand, and its harbinger is Igor Shafarevich.\n\nShafarevich will build his nation neither on the false pietisms of the Fascists nor the moral degradation of the Leftists - Russia will be shaped by what has always made it great, the purity of its soil and the refined disposition of its people. Only a Moral Russia can be a strong Russia, and only a strong Russia can be great. We will find the will to cast those parasites who impede us in this mission, and God help us, when freedom shines once more upon the Rodina it will be a true and lasting one."
 KOM_shafarevich_national_democracy_desc: "We are the Party of the Masses, but if we do not uphold the voice of the Russian people we are no better than the petty tyrants who claimed the same title. We will fashion from this rough clay a new and lasting Democracy, one that encompasses the breadth of our domain and its peoples - and, as with every careful potter, we will take care to dispose of any excess or spoiled materials before our work is complete.\n\nWe will institute new democratic campaigns across the rural network, calling for mass political participation and voting rallies, but our bureaucracy will take the greatest of pains to ensure that external elements - the old enemies of Russia - will not infiltrate this expression of our greatest values. Glory to Russia! May our freedom stand forever untainted!"
 KOM_shafarevich_election_security_act_desc: "There is something to be said about our dedication to rural democracy - there is also something to be said about the vulnerability of said democracy to infiltration by... unsavory elements. Words, however, are easy. We must set our minds to action, and preserve the voice of the Rodina in its most honest and direct form - rooting out every stray voice that does not truly have the Motherland at heart!\n\nThe Security Act being drafted will go a long way towards our goals in both directions. Formal agencies will be directed to reorganize our election structure from the bottom up, accountable to the highest legislative bodies in the land, and for those who are deemed suspicious in background, well, democracy is a vital and fragile instrument, yes? We cannot afford to take chances."
 KOM_shafarevich_the_spiritual_hegemony_desc: "Long have we dealt with the people of the Western Siberian despotates, and long have we awaited their return to the fold. Shafarevich is convinced that an approach of generosity and benevolence is what will work best for the good of the Nation as a whole; at all possible times we will forestall the use of violence and attempt instead to reinforce our common interests. There is much to be gained by accepting our rulership, and at the end of the day we are all Russians.\n\nHowever, should they refuse...§Rspecial measures§! will have to be taken to make these wayward children see sense."
 KOM_shafarevich_a_generation_of_thinkers_desc: "Russia is a field. This field is watered infrequently, and occasionally parts of it burn down at the behest of others, but the result is a stronger and more beautiful harvest. This is also true for Russia's vast landscape of intellectual talent - for every difficulty the peasantry have faced, they have overcome with flying colors. This, then, is our goal: to find the strongest and best flowers in our garden, nurture them into brilliant life, and set them loose to transform the world around them.\n\nWe will overhaul our recruitment structure in both Party and Government, setting the absolute highest standards of education and training, and when we are done our nation will be led by the cream of the Russian crop. The beautiful, the brave, the sensitive and the strong - they say the Superman will emerge from Berlin, but our rebuttal will be crafted here in Russia."
 KOM_shafarevich_the_most_loyal_opposition_desc: "The Russian spirit is renowned for its boundless enthusiasm, and for its absolute integrity. Long have these impulses served us, and long have they sown fertile rewards in artistic and scientific innovation. But there are instances in which one clashes with the other - so too for our opposition, noble in their enthusiasm but with their integrity tilted askew. It falls to us to ensure that they are curbed in the worst of their excesses, so that we will have a firm and unquestioned hand in guiding this country to the common good.\n\nWe will, through quiet words and unquiet actions, move our Opposition into positions of ceremonial power and no real value, while we place pressure upon their leadership to follow the will of the Russian state (its voice being, of course, Shafarevich). The Opposition may not always agree with us, but with our gentle directions, we will ensure that they will follow our lead even in wilfulness."
 KOM_shafarevich_return_to_the_soil_desc: "So much has been made of our dedication to rural democracy - perhaps we have forgotten that the farmer thinks of voting only as an afterthought. His life is dominated by simpler, rougher and better things - the harvest, the village and the family. As we polish our democratic processes, cast out the problematic elements haunting us and open the ballot boxes, let us celebrate as if there were neither peasant nor workingman, only Russians!\n\nThe Russian Spirit will be fostered as we turn electoral cycles into literal cycles of life, akin to harvests - rural-cultural dancing, movie screenings, and outright celebrations of life will follow each ballot, and our Churches will fill with joy as priests speak of the noble perfection of the Russian life. It will be a life of beauty and of honest work - all of Russia will share in its joy!"
 KOM_shafarevich_the_national_self_sufficiency_desc: "In the time of the Tsars Russia was accused of rapaciousness, even robbery, in its treatment of the nations under its wing. It was said that the Government favored the death of ten indigenous residents to the impoverishment of a single Russian. Those days are long gone now, and the Empire is a fading memory, but the problem the Tsars faced has been handed over to us. What approach shall we take to preserve our national essence, while remaining faithful stewards of the people God has granted us dominion over?\n\nShafarevich believes he has the solution: an approach he calls Self-Sufficiency, wherein the non-Russian national communities shall see neither incorporation nor exploitation. Instead the Russian nation shall focus on enriching its people, and the minorities within it can go their own way - they will be blessedly, truly free of the hands of the State, now and forever."
 KOM_shafarevich_bond_the_countryside_desc: "We must never forget the rural roots of Russian life, and to abandon them to the ravages of industrial monstrosity would be utterly immoral of us. Instead we will focus on the true aims of any government worth its salt - allowing the fertile soil of Russian peasantry to take root and blossom into fecundity.\n\nOf course, that does not mean the state is entirely irrelevant: far from it, our new Russian Agrarianism policies will ensure that the state will forever be joined at the hip to the farmer! From investment in rural production methods to the sending of agricultural advisors, from bureaus to tractors to roads, the Russian State will experience rebirth where it was born at the first."
 KOM_shafarevich_farewell_to_arcadia_desc: "We do not make this decision lightly - it is with the bitterest of regrets - but for the Rodina to rebuild some compromises must be made, no matter the cost. Just as trees survive better with the cutting of branches when the forest fires come, so too shall Russia's industrial abominations, expansive though they might be, save us from the inferno of war.\n\nWe will invest in industrial and heavy-mining concerns in areas that are sparsely populated, boosting our private industry at the cost of some of our cultural purity. It might be a betrayal of our values. It might even be considered oppressive. With our diplomatic threats coming closer every day, however, this investment will come in handy sooner or later. We would prefer to wield it of our own volition, rather than have it foisted upon us."
 KOM_shafarevich_russias_beating_heart_desc: "As the firms, the farmers and the factories of the Motherland grow into each other, the Nation comes closer to the platonic ideal of a united series of tissues. Yes, Russia is one giant organ of life and common purpose, and what a glorious shared purpose it is! We must not rest easy, however: the people must always be guarded from their worst impulses, not to mention those germs who would wish to defile what we have built here and turn it to their own ends.\n\nContinual incremental adjustments to this system, developing new methods to manage Russian ruralities and building a strong culture of self-reliance amongst our peasantry will ensure that this self-sustaining system continues to grow and self-correct. May all of Russia embrace this organic life, and may it sustain a vital Nation far into the future!"
 KOM_shafarevich_promote_russian_traditions_desc: "In the lands under our hegemony, many mansions claim dominion over the Russian heart. Some of them are of Socialist origin, some of Monarchist roots, and some stem from foreign influences. There will be more in the days to come, but if we are to expel these wayward ideas we must build something of substance in its place. The Russian Glory must be on full display for its light to enlighten our people! Nothing less is acceptable!\n\nWe will focus on the development of the rituals that tie us to the soil, and to the Nation: national holidays are only the beginning of a full-scale revamp of our civic culture. Religious occasions, national commemorations of martyrs and the enforcement of Russian language and history will ensure that the light of the Rus shines far brighter than the darkness which would put it out!"
 KOM_shafarevich_the_counter_russophobic_campaign_desc: "In recent days some have spoken of those with a sinister vision for Russia - they speak of the demon of "multiculturalism", where tolerance of those different from us is is interchangeable from the blending of pure Russian culture with incompatible, alien substances! It is utter nonsense to believe such things, of course, but the nonsense is potent nonetheless. If we are to combat this stupidity we must start from the ground of Russian society - the peasantry.\n\nIn truth, many Russian ruralities have an unrealised, nebulous notion of what it means to be Russian. By affirming their God-given sense of what is Russian and what is from the Devil, we will reinforce the notion that a half-hearted embrace of minority culture, of the loss of the heritage of earth and blood, is Russophobia in its most demonic form. And when we set these people loose upon the cities, we hope the ivory-tower elites who speak above their station will learn that lesson, too."
 KOM_shafarevich_the_politically_conscious_army_desc: "Glory is in the Russian blood - our people were made for greatness, and the Army is the distillation of the finest traditions of our people. Honor! Courage! Integrity! Patriotism! These values thrive everywhere, but they blossom into view only in the men who have selflessly volunteered for the greatest of all possible lives. What better way to ensure the spirit of our National Revival never dies out than to build it into the Army?\n\nRegular political re-education lessons, the stacking of leadership positions with firm loyalists dedicated to the Passionariyy ideals, and an emphasis on rural strength will keep the Army forever loyal to our ideals and our vision for the nation. Quiet amendments to the Constitution will also ensure that should our leadership ever come into question, the soldiers know exactly where their interests lie."
 KOM_shafarevich_from_sea_to_shining_sea_desc: "This, then, is the dream: nothing more, nothing less than the bringing to wholeness of Holy Russia. Even as the Union fell, even as the barbarities consumed so much of Russian life and culture, we held on to this dream. The time has come when we shall bring it into being - so with our Army ready to roll the false-kulturny ideas that pollute Russia all the way back to Germania, let us be fearless!\n\nThere is a home for us, a place where the people most precious of God shall ever rest: that place is the heart of the Father in heaven, and the Holy Mother Rus on earth!"
 KOM_shafarevich_the_russian_idea_desc: "Again and again, civilization has risen, again and again it has collapsed, and again and again, Russia has taken its remnants into our loving arms. When Orthodoxy burned with Constantinople, we took the mantle of the new Rome without question. When the liberalists burnt Europe half to the ground, we in Russia took the mantle of tradition. Now that the Germanic savages hold Russian soil and people hostage, we shall again assume the mantle of those who know they are the last redoubt - for that is what we are.\n\nBut let us never cower before the enemy! Our long march to the Baltics, to the Urals, has brought with it the Russian Idea - the vitality and the beauty and the wild strength of Russian life - everywhere our boots have landed. Again I tell you: as long as we hold the Rodina within our hearts, in our minds and with every harvest, Russia can never fall! We are unconquered, unconquerable, and in the long war with savagery, there has been one certain truth:\n\n§RWe have won every single time. We will win this time, too.§!"

 KOM_project_golden_legacy_desc: "The world is changing. Ancient forests are uprooted to make room for factories, and likewise, old gravesites will soon be home to housing complexes.

We don't have much time before the secrets underneath our very feet are lost forever."
 KOM_project_cold_waters: "Project §dCold Waters§!"
 KOM_project_cold_waters_desc: "The Arctic was once home to many Russian ships. The old Empire transported coin, goods, and traded with the far reaches of the world through its northern ports. We should send some scientists to the icebergs and islands of the Arctic Circle, but transportation is also needed. Some transports and a defense vessel will suffice."
 KOM_project_solar_flare: "Project §OSolar Flare§!"
 KOM_project_solar_flare_desc: "The lands of China, while not entirely part of Eurasia, are close enough to Mongolia to possess many artifacts from our Tengri ancestors.

 KOM_legion_of_scribes_desc: "The Atlanticists consider us a brutish, illiterate, violent kind, both to justify their crimes against Eurasia, tearing our united ethos into petty, artificial nationalities, but in assuring themselves of their misbegotten superiority. However, like the Khan of yore, we will not do away with what can simply be repurposed.\nProgressively, we reshape the useless bureaucracy of old into the Scribes of our new Eurasia.

 KOM_legion_of_scribes_2_desc: "Row after row of scribes dutifully writes every detail of our Empire. Every head is accounted, every cattle is counted, every detail and treasure archived.

 komi_fascist_smuta.1.t: "A Matter Above All Others"
 komi_fascist_smuta.1.d: "Igor Shafarevich watched the cabinet file into the room one by one, take their seats, ready their documents, and prepare for what he expected to be a lively discussion on a number of topics - chief of which was the military.\n\nThe winds were blowing in a very specific direction, and that direction was war. Despite the numerous questions and issues facing the Provisional Government of Russia, all of them would be moot if the matter of defense was not soon addressed. After the initial welcome and greeting, Shafarevich got down to business.\n\n"Defense Minister," Shafarevich began, directly addressing Alexander Prokhanov. "Based on your assessment, what is the status of our armed forces?"\n\n"Better than we feared, worse than we hoped, to summarize, Chairman," Prokhanov answered. "Our military will be able to protect us, should war be inevitable - but there are serious concerns if we are expected to expand beyond our borders. We risk becoming overstretched."\n\nHe was speaking about the reunification of West Russia - which Shafarevich knew would be pursued. "Elaborate."\n\nProkhanov began to answer, but was cut off by Andrey Dikiy. "If I may, Chairman, it appears that the greatest deficiencies come from a lack of modern equipment, poor discipline among soldiers, and an unstable chain of comma-"\n\n"Thank you, Minister, but let Prokhanov speak," Shafarevich interrupted, keeping his voice calm, and masking it with a smile. Internally he allowed himself to be irritated at the Foreign Minister. A worm he was, but for now at least, he needed to be respectful. He nodded at Prokhanov. "Now, please continue.""
 komi_fascist_smuta.1.a: ""Of course, Chairman. As I was saying...""
 
 komi_fascist_smuta.2.t: "For the Highest Cause"
 komi_fascist_smuta.2.d: "Discussions with students were among those Gumilyov enjoyed the most, especially if they were with former students, who in their years after his tutelage, had the opportunity to pursue and acquire knowledge and insights of their own. He had been enjoying a talk with one such former student, Christov, and now the discussion had shifted to the philosophy of the Passionariy itself.\n\n"Do you know Ignacy Hryniewiecki?" Gumilyov asked.\n\nChristov snorted, taking a sip of his tea. "Is that a trick question? Of course I do. One does not forget the man who killed a Tsar, and himself in the process."\n\n"Mmm," Gumilyov nodded. "A man of a different age, and yet one who embodies the highest level of Passionariy; more than many who are alive today."\n\n"He died though," Christov frowned, setting his drink on the table. "Nor were his actions especially beneficial in the end. He hardly brought down the aristocracy, quite the opposite, in fact."\n\n"Not the point," Gumilyov chided. "What matters is that he truly, utterly, believed in his cause. He believed in it so strongly, that he was willing to die in pursuit of it. So fervent was his belief, that he was certain of what would happen next, even if his life was lost in the process."\n\nGumilyov poured himself some more tea. "It doesn't matter if he was wrong, or if neither of us agree with his goals - it is the principle which matters, and which elevates him to the highest of Passionariy."\n\nChristov nodded, now understanding. "Because if one is not willing to give everything for their cause, even their own lives...""
 komi_fascist_smuta.2.a: ""...Then how truly do they believe it?""

 komi_fascist_smuta.3.t: "Changes for the Better"
 komi_fascist_smuta.3.d: "It was good to return home.\n\nDmitry Balashov was used to his returns being muted affairs. For sure, there were plenty in the Passionariy who would ask him questions following his return from research expeditions, but little interest outside of them. Nonetheless, he was looking forward to discussing his findings with Gumilyov, another kindred Eurasianist.\n\nYet returning, it was clear that some things were different. The far north of the Ural Mountains didn't allow easy communication, and so he'd missed out on whatever had happened in Komi. He'd known that elections had been coming up, but frankly, hadn't concerned himself with who won.\n\nHe supported the Passionariy, but hadn't expected them to gain the majority. Now, through whatever means, it seemed as though a miracle had happened. Speaking with a few people on the street, he quickly got a good idea on all that had happened. Now in a good mood, he arrived at his home, and began going through his accumulated mail.\n\nOne notice stood out, which he raised an eyebrow at, butopened. Inside was an official-looking letter, with the seal of the Provisional Government of Russia which read:\n\n"Mr. Balashov, on behalf of the National Assembly, upon your return, we would like to extend to you the position of Chairman of the National Assembly. Your combination of experience, leadership, and knowledge is what we believe will allow the Assembly to serve the people to the best of our ability."\n\nBalashov almost dropped the letter in shock, and quickly read it again just to be sure. Yes, it was real. A wide smile spread across his face, his other plans for the day forgotten, as he quickly made way to the Assembly, without another moment's delay."
 komi_fascist_smuta.3.a: "Miracles did sometimes happen."

 komi_fascist_smuta.4.t: "An Unpleasant Inconvenience"
 komi_fascist_smuta.4.d: "Shafarevich knocked several times on the door, and waited. A few moments later, Leonid Kantorovich opened the door, not looking especially enthused to see him. His voice was nonetheless neutral. "Igor."\n\n"Leonid," Shafarevich answered, inclining his head. "It's been some time."\n\n"You could say that," Kantorovich said dryly. A few seconds passed, before Kantorovich sighed, and opened the door wider. "Come in."\n\nShafarevich tried his best to move past the awkwardness of the situation - Kantorovich had been a close associate of his while he'd been the previous Minister of Finance, and now was...not. House arrest wasn't necessarily pleasant, but compared to some fates, Shafarevich resolved that it was better than the alternatives.\n\nAll the same, he doubted Kantorovich saw it that way.\n\nThe two men continued talking; the topics shifting to educational plans, specifically the mathematics curriculums. The small talk did help ease the tension between them. Putting aside the circumstances, it was almost like old times. Their discussion passed a couple hours, before Shafarevich glanced at a clock.\n\nHe would have to leave soon, but it seemed wrong to not address this situation in some way. "I do want to say that, I do...apologize for this," he subtly inclined the house. "Hopefully, it can be resolved soon. A man of your talent and experience shouldn't have to go through this inconvenience."\n\nKantorovich didn't outwardly react, but Shafarevich got the impression that he wasn't convinced of his sincerity."
 komi_fascist_smuta.4.a: "But he merely offered his thanks, and echoed the sentiment."

 komi_fascist_smuta.5.t: "Mud, Rain, and Grit"
 komi_fascist_smuta.5.d: "It was a dreary, wet day in Komi. The kind of day where anyone would be miserable - especially soldiers. Rain poured down, turning roads into muddy slogs, and uniforms into cold, sodden weights. Yet none of those things were excuses. The duties of a soldier remained, rain or shine.\n\nFrom the cover of his outpost, General Gleb Sluchenkov watched the exercises taking place through his binoculars. The weather today was actually a good thing - it simulated hard conditions that they might experience in the field. Iit was far better for the soldiers to be tested here, than when it truly mattered.\n\nSmall-unit tactical drills were being conducted today, where soldiers were broken into numerous small units, and assigned objectives. It tested their individual skill, creativity, and judgement. It was especially useful in assessing who could be relied on, and who required more supervised command. Autonomy could be beneficial with the right soldiers - or a disaster with others.\n\nHis binoculars moved from one unit to another, as their tasks were completed, before fixating on one unit. He looked just in time to see that one of the soldiers tripped over something, Sluchenkov didn't see what, and fell down.\n\nIt was a hard fall, and it seemed like the man had cut his arm on something on the way down. He waited for the man to call for help, but was instead impressed to see the man quickly get back to his feet, wrap up the wound, and return to helping his unit.\n\nSluchenkov felt a small measure of relief and pride at that. It was a small thing, but the man had certainly not known he was being watched, yet had forced himself to continue without relying on others, even when he could have asked for help. That was the kind of man he needed; the kind of man who would reclaim Russia for her people."
 komi_fascist_smuta.5.a: "He quickly wrote down a note to learn the soldier's name."

 komi_fascist_smuta.6.t: "A Dream on the Verge of Realization"
 komi_fascist_smuta.6.d: "The Constitutional Committee of the Provisional Government of Russia was a long name - effectively many words to effectively convey that it was here, this committee, that the structure of the new government would be decided.\n\nThose who had been chosen for the committee were from the various factions of the Passionariy - but everyone soon saw that it was Gumilyov's loyalists who held the majority of seats. It was not wholly unexpected, but the Eurasianist dominance made a few onlookers nervous.\n\nAfter the initial meetings, the general structure had been hammered out, despite the objections of the other factions. It had been decided that the primary organs of government would be councils composed of passionariy and harmonic members. This had then shifted to a debate on precisely what those positions meant, and who qualified for them.\n\nTo this end there had been several secondary institutions established that would be created - the High Passionariy, which would assess an individual's capability to be considered as part of the group, and the Harmonic Council, which would fulfill the same administrative role.\n\nThe exact qualifications remained unknown, which some onlookers wondered if it was simply a means to ensure that the Eurasianists could permanently dominate the government. This was harshly disputed, leading to a few specific qualifications being spelled out, which satisfied most of the members.\n\nAs the final days drew closer, and the establishment of the constitution finished, there was excitement in the air as pens were put to paper, and paragraphs took shape. So long had many Eurasianists envisioned this moment - and now they were on the verge of victory."
 komi_fascist_smuta.6.a: "Soon, the Eurasianist dream would be realized."

 komi_fascist_smuta.7.t: "The New Republic"
 komi_fascist_smuta.7.d: "The Constitutional Committee of the Provisional Government of Russia was seen as one that, from the outside looking in, would be held in quite high regard. Those who comprised it were well-dressed, well-spoken, and whose members would not be out of place in other democratic states. There was a lack of archaic politics, eccentric personalities, or much that did not reflect simple, standard conservatice politics.\n\nIt was not to say that the strange Eurasianists, bizarre Ordosocialists, or archaic monarchists didn't have some representation - but it was clear that the majority were aligned with Shafarevich's vision for Komi.\n\nIt was widely agreed upon that to form a new constitution, they had to look at the original constitution of the Komi Republic. Little sense in starting from nothing, after all. Over the course of days, each article of it was separated, and then debated on its merits. Arguments over what could be preserved and strengthened, as well as what should be cast aside, were heated.\n\nIn the end, there were a number of provisions that the committee agreed should be preserved. Freedom of expression, assembly, and religion were the first elements to be kept, and the right to own private property was passed unanimously. While it generated more debate, it was agreed that protections from unreasonable search and seizure were also important enough to be included.\n\nSlowly, surely, a new constitution was coming together, one which Shafarevich's allies viewed with pride, even as the other factions grumbled. To them, Komi was, finally, on the road to a complete, functional, and conservative state - one which would respect the rights of the people, and solidify the responsibilities of the state.\n\nSoon, this Provisional Government would fade, and a proper republic would be born."
 komi_fascist_smuta.7.a: "A Republic under the leadership of Shafarevich."

 komi_fascist_smuta.8.t: "Preparing a Holy Russia"
 komi_fascist_smuta.8.d: ""Aged" was the word most people would use to describe the composition of the Constitutional Committee of the Provisional Government. The men who composed it were on average, older, and their mannerisms, dress, and speech might as well have come from a different era. In a way, they were.\n\nThe few who did not fit this ground stood out, often intimidated by the oppressive atmosphere. There was a sense of inevitability in the committee these members felt, along with a slow, realized horror at the realization that the committee was dominated by monarchists and Taboritsky's loyalists. How such influence had been gained, no one was certain - but now they would be writing the next constitution.\n\nTheir first order of business was not surprising - the monarchy was officially restored, and the tsar proclaimed the head of state. While there were some members who attempted to moderate the powers the tsar would have, they were quickly overridden. They could only watch as the committee surrendered more and more power to the tsar, until it was absolute.\n\nThey did not stop there.\n\nThere was further controversy as the non-monarchists attempted to prevent wording stating that the tsar's authority was derived from God - but as before, they were overridden. After this, a number of the members resigned in protest - which only led to their positions being replaced by more monarchists.\n\nAs the committee drew to a close, there was no one to even offer a word of contest as the monarchists tore apart the foundations of the Republic, and laid the groundwork for a regency to rise in its place. Upon the ratification of the constitution, there would be nothing which stopped the appointed tsar from imposing his will on the nation without restraint."
 komi_fascist_smuta.8.a: "The clock begins ticking."

 komi_fascist_smuta.9.t: "To the Whole People"
 komi_fascist_smuta.9.d: "The Constitutional Committee of the Provisional Government had always been anticipated to be a contentious affair. Heated debates, passionate arguments, and a variety of perspectives were expected, all for the purposes of forming a new, cohesive, and permanent constitution.\n\nPrivately, there were fears that there would be no consensus, and the committee would stall. Experts and partisans alike were bracing themselves at the possibility of a weak constitution, or one limited in scope. What no one expected was the committee not being led by Shafarevich's conservatives or Gumilyov's Eurasianists - but by Serov's Ordosocialists.\n\nWhile some would have moderated their approach, and made efforts to give token inclusion to the other parties, the Ordosocialists saw no reason to indulge such things. Observers looked on in bafflement as the constitution taking shape resembled a Frankenstein's monster of right and left-wing elements.\n\nOne section in particular, which had caused much of the remaining members to resign in protest, declared that the land, its natural deposits, mills, farms, and mines were all property of the state. It didn't stop there - and proceeded to identify nearly every part of the nation, from homes to railways to factories to existing state enterprises, all were the property of the state.\n\nOr as the final text claimed: "Belong to the whole people."\n\nThe Ordosocialists celebrated as the committee ratified the constitution for the final time, with those opposed having resigned, driven out, or silenced. There was a new future for Russia approaching - one that promised to shatter the conventional wisdom that had dominated in the past."
 komi_fascist_smuta.9.a: "A new Russia approaches."


 komi_fascist_smuta.10.t: "The Injustice of Forgiveness"
 komi_fascist_smuta.10.d: "The church was a small, quaint one. A small church, with an equally small congregation. Nonetheless, those who attended were devoted worshippers, from generations of families who had attended for decades now. It was part of their routine; a second home or family to them.\n\nTabortisky could appreciate the sentiment of it. The congregation had never been a second family like it was for some of these people, but there was a familiarity here. Today was simply another service like any other. Like the rest of the congregation, Taboritsky entered, and took his seat in a middle pew.\n\nThese days, he earned a few more glances and stares than he had before, yet most turned their attention elsewhere after a few moments. He wasn't here to do anything but listen as a dutiful Christian. He sat silently, respectfully as he listened to the priest go through the standard rites, psalms, and readings.\n\nThe sermon today was on a topic that Taboritsky found himself irritated by - and a regular point of contention with the priest. That of forgiveness. The virtue of looking upon the most vile, the most evil, and forgiving him. He simply did not understand such a thing, and certainly could not believe that God would support such injustice.\n\nNo, when he heard the preaching of forgiveness, he was reminded of the slain Romanovs, butchered by the godless communists like so many other devout Russians. His blood boiled, and his face darkened as the priest continued his sermon. Yet he did not speak.\n\nHe only listened. Even men of God could be incorrect sometimes, but this man was ultimately irrelevant. Such a man could not restore the Godly fervor that Russia desperately needed - but fortunately, that time was coming."
 komi_fascist_smuta.10.a: "He only need bide his time a bit longer."

 komi_fascist_smuta.11.t: "The Little Symbols"
 komi_fascist_smuta.11.d: "It was a wet, foggy morning, the kind that any army dreaded marching and fighting in. However, Serov expected that the morning sun would dispel the fog soon, and even if it didn't - this presented an excellent exercise environment.\n\nHe and Alexander Korotkov stood a short distance from the established front line, observing the exercise through binoculars. "Do you think they'll be able to do it?" Serov asked.\n\nKorotkov grunted. "We'll see. They seem like they can manage."\n\nThe soldiers below did appear to be performing well, moving in tight formations, and the officers maintaining order over the simulated battlefield. Guns fired, tanks blasted, and artillery boomed across the hills.\n\nThe noise caught Serov's attention, and he turned his binoculars to one of the artillery pieces. "Alexander, do you recognize that model?"\n\nKorotkov peered through his binoculars at the piece Serov pointed out. "Looks new," he grunted. "Not a Soviet one."\n\n"Indeed," Serov smiled, his mood already buoyed. "That's one of our own, built by our own hands and from our own factories. A good sign, wouldn't you say?" Korotkov only nodded.\n\nIt may have been a simple artillery piece, but it was symbolic of the efforts that were taking place across the state. Komi would soon march across West Russia, and unify it under a single banner once again. Only this time, it would not be some decrepit relic of the past attempting to reassert itself. It would not be the tired, failed ideologies of the past."
 komi_fascist_smuta.11.a: "It would be something new."
 
 komi_fascist_smuta.12.t: "Rebuilding the Shattered Nation"
 komi_fascist_smuta.12.d: "Gumilyov had known that when the unifying threat of the liberals and communists was gone, he would face opposition from those purportedly his allies. It was simply the nature of politics, and as the face of the Passionariy for so many years, there would be many looking to unseat him. The visionary and powerful were often the targets of lesser, jealous men.\n\nHis intuition and experience had not failed him. Oh, his rivals had certainly tried to displace him, some who wanted simple conservatism, proposed schizophrenic left-right ideologies, or espoused even archaic tsarist fantasies. Yet each of them had failed to capture what the people craved. What they knew was needed - and which he provided.\n\nEurasianism had swept across Komi, and while not everyone in the National Assembly was committed, those who filled the seats of the most important parts of the Provisional Government were men he could rely on. He stepped before the podium, to begin his own address - one that would directly address their future.\n\n"Russia has been broken, divided, and shattered," he began. "Russian fights russian, many under the command of criminals, communists, monarchists, and other illegitimate states, all of whom seek to impose their failed ideologies upon us once more. They raise their armies to fight and kill us, as we raise our own to defend our nation and people."\n\nHe lifted one finger. "But we must not forget that these false leaders do not represent the people. They are aberrations who will be forgotten. Our countrymen are only temporarily divided, and must be reminded of the history and brotherhood we all shared. The day of our unification approaches, and our people will march together once more. Today, it may only be a part of Russia."\n\nHe leaned in, and smiled."
 komi_fascist_smuta.12.a: ""But I promise, it will one day also be the Motherland.""

 komi_fascist_smuta.13.t: "New Chapters"
 komi_fascist_smuta.13.d: "Shafarevich allowed himself to feel a moment of triumph - and relief.\n\nMirroring many politicians currently seated in the National Assembly in attire, it was only his smile, confident posture, and own charisma that made him stand out. Politicians were common, but it required a certain skill and deftness to truly take advantage - and it was fortunate that he'd been able to do so.\n\nShafarevich shuddered to think what could have happened if Gumilyov's Eurasianists, Serov's Ordosocialists, or god forbid, Taboritsky's lunatics had somehow managed to gain power. Fortunately, such futures were avoided, as he saw his allies seated in every important position in the Provisional Government.\n\nOne that would not be provisional for much longer.\n\n"A new chapter of Komi approaches," Shafarevich began his address to the Assembly. "This journey has been a long, arduous, and difficult road. It has cost us family, friends, and countrymen. We must never forget those who were lost in the unfortunate violence and chaos - and there is no better way to honor them but to move forward, and build a better future."\n\nHe motioned to those present. "We honor them by embodying the principles of the Republic, we honor them by rectifying the mistakes of the past, and looking to the future. We, together, reject the chaos, division, and irrationality that infected our politics previously. This nation we have built, this new constitution written, it is because of a shared vision. A vision of a stable, prosperous, lawful, and free nation."\n\nHe smiled, as the Assembly rose to already applaud him, the sound growing louder. "Today, this new chapter begins!" He said, to cheers in the crowd. "Today, we are united!""
 komi_fascist_smuta.13.a: "Today Komi, tomorrow Russia."

 komi_fascist_smuta.14.t: "A Lesson From Babel"
 komi_fascist_smuta.14.d: "Taboritsky knew what his enemies called him behind his back. Mad. Deluded. Ones far worse than that. Yet their sneering ignorance was a boon, he had realized. It was easy to underestimate the supposedly delusional and insane, and now they had paid the price of their arrogance.\n\nThe atmosphere of the National Assembly was muted. Fear filled the eyes of many, but Taboritsky paid them little mind, for they did not matter. Those who did sat in positions throughout the Provisional Government - who were firmly aligned behind him.\n\nAs he stood at the podium to address the Assembly, he soon began. "Russia has been punished, but I ask you - for what reason?" He only let the rhetorical question linger for a moment. "It is because she turned away from God, and allowed his people to be slaughtered. She allowed the devils in red to burn his churches, slaughter his priests, and execute his children."\n\nA bitter, cruel smile appeared on his face. "And yet, there are those who refuse to understand this. Who are content to let the socialists and Jews infect our lands, like writhing maggots, who have no purpose but to ensure Russia remains in a state of punishment. Is it a surprise that God split Russia into a thousand pieces, as he did to mankind at Babel, who declared they did not need God to thrive?"\n\nHis voice lowered. "No, it is not. But take heart, my countrymen, for I have seen what Russia must become. In our future rises a holy, godly Russia - and when we prove our commitment to Him in full - then we can only expect prosperity."\n\nHe continued only a bit longer, outlining such a vision of a Holy Russia for those who listened raptly, his voice filled with his own hope and longing. So close, he was to achieving this dream. So close, he was to bringing Russia to glory."
 komi_fascist_smuta.14.a: "So close, was Alexei's return."

 komi_fascist_smuta.15.t: "Forward, Into the Fire"
 komi_fascist_smuta.15.d: "Success was something that tasted so very sweet.\n\nSerov couldn't keep the smile from his face as he approached the podium to address the National Assembly. It had been a long road, and he had overcome so many who had been quick to belittle, dismiss, and undermine him and his own theories. Today, all of those who had doubted him could only stew in silence, for it was he who was ascendent.\n\nIn the Assembly he saw many of his supporters, men who had realized the superiority of Ordosocialism and that it was the future; a necessity in this changed world. However, supporters were only one aspect - what truly mattered were the men who sat in each important position in the Provisional Government. No doubt his enemies were fuming over being outmaneuvered by one such as him.\n\nBut really, it was their own fault. Perhaps if they'd taken him seriously, they could have done something. Alas, it was too late for them now. Far, far too late.\n\n"The world has moved on," Serov opened, intending to follow a specific theme today. "Russia failed to adapt before this point. We have experienced the failures of ancient, depreit, and ineffective ideologies. The tyranny of tsarists and communists, the corruption of socialists, and the ineffectiveness of democrats."\n\n"Over and over, the will of the people has repeatedly been denied!" Serov declared. "To repeat the mistakes of the past dooms Russia to irrelevance and destruction.We must forge a new path! We must embrace the changes needed to ensure our victory."\n\nSerov then smiled. "And my friends, we have already begun forging this path!""

 komi_fascist_smuta.16.t: "Shafarevich Triumphant!"
 komi_fascist_smuta.16.d: "The Assembly had expected two outcomes to the meeting. The expected outcome was that Gumilyov would enter as Guide of the National Revolution and emerge as President. After all, was he not the father of the Provisional Government? The underdog story was Igor Shafaverich- the compassionate conservative, as he styled himself. Shafarevich had been the young face of the nationalist right, and had been expected to have a long career in front of him.\n\nOf course, events changed all that, and suddenly Shafaverich found himself not as second in command to one faction among many, but second in the leaders of the Provisional Government. When the vote count was finished, and Shafaverich was officially named President of the Provisional Government, the remaining opposition in the National Assembly fluttered with confusion and mild surprise. It was nowhere near the shock of what would have happened from a Serov or Taboritsky victory, but it was enough to surprise many. As the men and women of the Assembly filed out, Shafarevich took a moment to savor his victory. Soon, he could really get to work."
 komi_fascist_smuta.16.a: "An unexpected outcome."

 komi_fascist_smuta.17.t: "Gumilyov Triumphant!"
 komi_fascist_smuta.17.d: "The expected outcome was that Gumilyov would enter as Guide of the National Revolution and emerge as President. So when it actually happened, guided by the carefully curated cabinet, the most chaotic the Assembly got was a small murmur of affirmation and clapping from his own wing. What was much more interesting was the events immediately afterwards.\n\nSerov and Taboritsky both rose from their chairs and made their exits- Taboritsky nearly dashing to the exit, while Serov at least had the brains to keep his mask of calm up as he left. No doubt, Gumilyov thought as he watched them go, they were going to try and cause trouble. He sighed- just another thing to hang them for. His eyes flicked to Shafaverich, who had not left. What was he to do with him? It would take longer to get rid of a man as popular as Igor, but it would be done, eventually. Soon enough, Gumilyov would be alone at the top, and the Eurasianist dream could finally be realized.\n\nAs truck engines outside roared into the distance, Gumilyov's joyous demeanor finally returned, and his heart stopped beating so hard. He would never admit it to anyone, but he was a little worried there."
 komi_fascist_smuta.17.a: "As expected."

 komi_fascist_smuta.18.t: "Taboritsky Triumphant!"
 komi_fascist_smuta.18.d: "A stunned silence enveloped the National Assembly as the final result was read. Gumilyov rose from his seat, shocked. Shafarevich's eyes widened in astonishment. Serov's face broke for a moment, showing his absolutely confounded expression. For a moment, there was silence in the room.\n\nAnd then everything began to move.\n\nMen exploded from their seats, shouting unintelligibly about a rigged vote, or a stacked Cabinet. Some began shaking down those around them, searching for the traitors to the party, to their leader, to the nation. Others made a beeline for the door- their hand was played and lost, and the only thing they could do was leave. Still others rushed towards Taboritsky's joyous men, stopped only by a line of policemen and guards separating the groups from each other. The noise echoed off the walls, only escalating into a cacophony of chaos.\n\nIn the middle of it all, Taboritsky's smile spread across his face. He had always known he was in the right. He knew he would win, no matter what the others thought. Once again, he was correct. Now, the rest of the Right would see what Sergey Taboritsky really was."
 komi_fascist_smuta.18.a: "It can't be true!"

 komi_fascist_smuta.19.t: "Serov Triumphant!"
 komi_fascist_smuta.19.d: "Serov did not smile often. He prided himself on his calm, cold exterior. After all, "Friendly" and "NKVD officer" were not mixable traits. The last time he could remember himself smiling- genuinely smiling, not just the crocodile smile he gave to those he needed for his plans- was at his desk long ago, writing out his masterpiece. He could remember the ecstasy of the final tap of the typewriter, and he could remember the crushing blow of Suslov, rather than even taking a moment to truly think about his writings, casting it aside out of hand. If only old Mikhail could see him now!\n\nHe had worked hard in the last years. Going from the Left to the Right was nearly unheard of, and it took much time for them to trust him as one of their own. He was no fascist, not at all. At heart, he was still a socialist- just not one of those doddering fools or naive idealists who seemed to think that slapping the same red coat of paint on Russia would be enough to win. He knew better. Maybe Russia hadn't wanted to accept it then, but they were going to accept it now. He would make them.\n\nAnd so, as chaos swept the floor of the National Assembly, and men leapt from their seats in astonishment at what was thought to be impossible, Serov allowed himself a genuine smile."

 komi_fascist_smuta.20.t: "A New Residence?"
 komi_fascist_smuta.20.d: "Sergey Taboritsky's latest proposal has made waves. Ever since the conquest of Vyatka, he has been proposing the capital of the Provisional Government be moved from Ust-Sysolsk- however, many have taken offense to this. Some feel that it feeds the ego of the monarchists too much, while others feel there is no need for it.\n\nHowever, there is a final category of people opposed to this proposal, and it is those who do not wish to move. Artem and his family were of this category, specifically. An aide to a deputy who frequently spent hours away from home, his wife and children had done their best to... adhere to his busy schedule. And now this; Sergey Taboritsky standing on the Assembly floor giving a speech- partially composed, partially raving.\n\nMinutes turned into hours, but Artem was barely paying attention to the debate on the floor- where would he and his family live? How would he explain the move to the children? They had friends here, and they would not be pleased to hear their father telling them that they had to pack up and leave their life behind. And what of his wife? Valentina had done her best to stay by his side, no matter the long nights he was away. What would he tell her? They already likely knew of the news- but what was he going to say?\n\nEventually, the debate ended, and the time came to go home. Artem walked calmly, and opened the door before moving into the living room. They were waiting. They were watching. "What news?" Valentina asked, as Artem opened his mouth to speak."

So help me God."\n\n"I swear that I will inviolably maintain and preserve in Russia the one, holy, Catholic and apostolic church as established by law, and that the government, worship, discipline, rights and privileges of the Russian Orthodox Church will be preserved. So help me God."\n\n"Rise, Blessed Regent," said the archbishop, placing the regent's diadem upon his neatly-groomed hair. Taboritsky did so, standing tall and proud before the golden throne crafted in secret for this very day. Only the archbishop stood between him and absolute power - and now, that man stepped aside.\n\nTaboritsky stepped forwards, and took up the crown jewels: a scepter for his right hand, and an orb in his left, both fashioned of gold and of his own design. He would never assume the imperial crown, but all present would know his absolute power from appearances alone. He turned and sat himself upon the throne of regency, and all before him knelt in sublime submission."

 komi_burgsys.2.d: "The streets were quiet, orderly, cold. People silently shuffled along the usual routes to their assigned tasks. Guards stood on every corner and outside every building, glaring upon the masses with rifles shouldered and bayonets polished. The commoners lowered their eyes as they passed the watchmen, never daring to challenge their icy gaze.\n\nWhen men worked, they did so without idle chatter or the relaxed movements of the content. They were rigid, nervous, mechanical. There was no longer room for mistakes. A dropped box, a broken tool, a word out of line - all were inadmissible errors, remedied with the guilty man's sudden disappearance and replacement by somebody more deserving of his role.\n\nDissent was a forgotten word. Not even the bravest dared to ask uninvited questions, or whisper grim secrets to their families in the dead of night. The Okhrana had made it known that nobody, from the lowliest worker to the nobility, was safe from a knock on the door and a five-minute trial ending before a blood-spattered wall.\n\nAs the Regent looked down upon his city from the balcony of his palace, his heart was at last tranquil. This incarnation of the Empire was not a decrepit old man, bloated with decay; it was a single, glorious machine. A firm hand on the levers, a gentle turning of the dial, and it would move as he willed. As the tale of history unfolded according to God's design, so too did the cogs of Russia by the Regent's hand."

Holy Russia, the sole beacon of God's light in this benighted world, is imperiled. It has been so for centuries, but now we stand at the absolute nadir of civilization."\n\n"All around us, threats the likes of which you cannot imagine are gathering. The Jews and their barbarian puppets know that we are more vulnerable now than ever before. Our great nation has been raped and plundered by the Bolsheviks, left in ruins so that a final decisive blow might snuff out the Russian spirit forever. Should we allow this to happen, all Creation will fall into the clutches of the Jew, with nobody to save it."\n\n"But I, Blessed Regent of the Holy Russian Empire, will stand firm. Russia is not yet lost, my brothers! She is bruised and bloody, but still lives! Her salvation is still within reach! Stand with me, brave Russians! Stand for the motherland, for the rightful Tsarevich, for the Lord God! Take up arms, as your ancestors did, and cleanse our lands! Just as Joshua swept into Canaan and exterminated the monstrous heathens who polluted it, we must scourge Russia clean of the Jew, the barbarian, and the infidel! Hail Russia! Hail the Tsarevich!

 komi_burgsys.4.d: "Pyotr tried to keep himself from shivering as he stepped into Taboritsky's office and heard the door lock behind him. He was gripping the pocket pistol concealed in his jacket so tightly that the edges were biting into his palm. Taboritsky rose from behind his desk, a smile on his face. It wasn't reflected in his eyes - there, Pyotr could only see a deep well of madness on the verge of brimming over. "Pyotr," said Taboritsky, taking up a pair of filled vodka glasses as he approached. His graceful, measured movements belied the simmering insanity that Pyotr knew to be within him. "Won't you join me for a drink?"\n\nA transparent ploy. Pyotr didn't let his eye contact with Taboritsky drop. He shook his head, too anxious to answer.\n\nTaboritsky's smile vanished, replaced with the stone-faced, dead-eyed stare Pyotr had seen in his nightmares. It was the same look that had graced his features when they dispatched Nabokov; the same as when he had first ordered chemical weapons unleashed. Yet, maybe... "Eminence," Pyotr began, forcing himself to relax slightly. "I have-"\n\nEverything happened at once. Pyotr instinctively jerked backwards as he saw the glasses drop to shatter on the polished floorboards. Taboritsky seemed to leap forwards, the glint of polished steel in his right hand. Pyotr let out a reflexive shout of alarm and tried to draw the pistol from within his jacket pocket - only for it to tumble, with a clatter and a bang, to the floor. All he could do was throw his arms outwards towards Taboritsky, catching his knife arm at the wrist.\n\nBoth men were old, creaking relics of a Russia past, but Pyotr was the weaker. Not even a second later, he felt something give in his elbows, and the knife drew closer. In that instant, what little courage had driven him evaporated, replaced only by gibbering, insensate terror for his life. "Sergey, Sergey, Sergey!" he screamed at the top of his lungs. "Sergey, stop! Stop! Sergey, please! Just list- Listen to me, Sergey!"\n\nDespite his plea, no hint of mercy appeared in his friend's eyes. The gleaming point drew closer, spurred on by a madman's strength. Pyotr gritted his teeth, eyes bulging as he tried to find some final reserve of strength in his old bones - and then, he slipped. Something cold slid between Pyotr's ribs. He fell, first against the wall and then to the floor. As his vision tightened to a tunnel, the last thing he ever saw was the steadily spreading pool of his lifeblood edging towards his old friend's trembling boots."

 komi_burgsys.5.t: "The Crown's Finances"
 komi_burgsys.5.d: "A poor showing, Taboritsky thought as he closed the comprehensive report on the Regency's finances. Poor indeed. Western Russia was one of the most resource-rich areas in Europe, but this was all his esteemed Treasurer could scrounge up? A paltry few billion in taxation? Had the people been utterly deprived by the Bolsheviks for the benefit of the Jews, or were they themselves hiding something? Both, he supposed; the former could easily have led to the latter.\n\nThe Regent rose and meandered over to the window of his study, a glass of Breton wine in hand. From there, he could see smoke rising from chimneys on the skyline. Beneath, he knew that there were thousands of strong Russians working day and night to forge the arms of victory - but it seemed those same workers were holding out on him. The Soviet Union had been a worker's state, had it not? Surely their loyalty was questionable at best.\n\nTaboritsky returned to his desk and set the glass aside, before producing a sheet of paper to begin drafting a memorandum to the Imperial Treasury. What they had now wasn't enough. All within the realm was rightfully Tsarevich Alexei's property; therefore, in his absence, it was the Regent's. The sovereign would have what he required, no matter how jealously it might be guarded."

"Sir, we'll cook down south during the summer."\n\n"Don't complain," replied Polnikov. He was struggling to button up his coat after years of inaction on the border posts left him with a beer gut. "Besides, it's just a dress uniform. If we're ever wearing it in summer, it'll only be for a parade or whatever."\n\nThe newly-minted corporal wasn't so sure about all this. Two years in the Eurasianist militia, and this was where it led? To a strange hybrid of an SS and Tsarist uniform that barely fit him, four more years of mandatory service and the prospect of fighting for a leader that he didn't even support? He had joined up with Gumilyov precisely because he was a republican and a believer in something new, but here he was in the service of a Nazi and a monarchist.\n\n"I hate this already, sir," he confessed as he tried, once more, to pull his undersize boots on. "Why didn't we just follow Gumilyov's lead and run? Fuck, I remember when we used to fight Taboritsky's boys, and you're really okay with just forgetting those days?"\n\n"I'm a patriot and a believer," responded Polnikov curtly. "If the man in charge is Russian and a man of God, then I'll fight for him. I respect Gumilyov, but he was never going to give Russia what it needed."\n\nAt the back of the room, behind a row of lockers, Private Medvedev finished jotting down the corporal's words and made for the nearest telephone.

 komi_burgsys.7.d: "Kamarov was a former NKVD man, but whatever loyalty he had to the red flag had died with the Union. After twenty years of socialism, what had Russia to show for it? Backwards industry, a feeble government and a military that could barely handle a few Finnish peasants. He was a rational fellow - he had studied history, seen through the communist myths that obscured the truth of monarchism. It was for that precise reason that he had received the Regent's sacred trust, and now stood before a row of fresh Okhrana recruits - his recruits - awaiting their first assignments.\n\nHe stepped forward and handed a small slip of paper to the first man in line. "The wife first," he said in his smoker's growl. The man's face remained blank as he nodded, took the order and departed. Kamarov moved along the line, passing out the death sentences one at a time.\n\n"Just the children, so they get the message."\n\n"That one's for heresy, so burn the place down when you're done."\n\n"Hang this one. Publicly. Find a lamp-post or something."\n\n"These three are all in the same hostel, so you can do it by yourself."\n\nWhen all the officers had departed, Kamarov produced the final death sentence and smiled as he re-read it in the dim lamplight. It was going to be a very productive and enjoyable night."

And that was just to a boy born with a couple of extra toes! Grisha will be found out the moment he's asked to speak in school! I won't let our boy die just because he's a bit slow!"\n\nThe man spoke again, perhaps a bit humbled. "Anna, yes, I know we can't let them find out about him, but we could just... well, not send him to school. People must have taught their children themselves all the time not so long ago. How hard can it be?"\n\n"What about when we're gone? He can't live without us, Genya." The floorboards creaked under Esfir's light feet, and the voices stopped. She froze, not even daring to breathe. "Grisha?" the woman called out. "Is that you, love?" Thinking quickly, Esfir clicked off the tape recorder and slipped it into the pocket of her dressing gown, before gently opening the couple's door.\n\n"It's just me, Mommy," she said, her face concealed in the darkness of the hallway. "I had a bad dream. Can I sleep with you and Daddy?"\n\n"Of course you can, honey," said Gennady, his smile visible in the moonlight. "Come in." Esfir closed the door behind her and slipped off her gown, placing it at the foot of the bed before climbing in between her parents and curling up.\n\n"You'll have to learn to face your fears sooner or later, Esfir," her mother chided as she rolled over to face her. "Ten is too old to be hiding away with us, don't you think?"\n\nEsfir said nothing. She simply closed her eyes, and thought of how much easier life would be for her parents without Grisha weighing them down."

"Give me back my boy!"\n\nThe officer scowled behind his balaclava and shoved her with his PPSh. "Enough whining, bitch. Consider yourself lucky that we didn't take the other one too."\n\n"He's harmless!" bellowed her husband, tears flowing down a face bursting with rage. "He's never hurt anyone! What do you want with him?!" Their daughter clung to his leg, her expression blank. She hadn't made a sound since the black-uniformed officers had kicked in the door two minutes prior.\n\n"He's an animal," sneered the officer. "A rabid beast. You'd have put him down yourself if you had any fucking decency."\n\n"You fucking bastard!" roared the husband, making a lunge for the officer. He was met with the wooden stock of the SMG cracking against his nose, breaking it and knocking him to the floor. His wife screamed in distress and rushed to his side. Their daughter moved to kneel dutifully beside him, but remained silent.\n\n"Change of plans, Yevgeny!" called another voice from outside the room. "Extreme case, looks like."\n\nThe officer racked the bolt on his PPSh. "Understood. Neutralizing suspects." He levelled the weapon, squeezed the trigger, and held it down until the screaming stopped."

Gone from the stage of the town hall was the old portrait of Lenin - along with the unfortunate mayor who had dared to hang it up. In its place, framed and nailed in place, was the face of Regent Taboritsky, his cold blue eyes staring down upon the assembled townsfolk. Similarly, someone had hung a framed photograph of him above the mayor's desk.\n\nThat same afternoon, a truck rolled into town with armed men sitting in the flatbed. As they climbed down and took up positions, the driver stood up on the cab and held aloft both a megaphone and a portrait of the Regent. "Subjects of the Regency!" he boomed, startling the elderly folk. "Take this opportunity - prove your loyalty to the Blessed Regent! Once, you all welcomed the faces of treason and atheism into your homes; repent, and hang high the visage of your rightful sovereign!"\n\nNobody moved a muscle. Instead, the villagers simply milled around, confused and slightly nervous. One of the guards racked the bolt on his AK, and the driver spoke again. "Furthermore, I hereby announce that regular inspections of private homes will be conducted by the Imperial Shturmoviki! Subjects of the Regent found to be of suspect loyalty will be subject to extreme corrective measures."\n\nOne by one, the villagers moved forwards to collect their portraits.

Fingernails tear at posters glued to walls, axes hack apart heathen altars, and portraits of false rulers are consigned to the flames. Exhorted onwards - and threatened - by the Shturmoviki, the subjects of the Regent are cleansing the image of Holy Russia.\n\nWhen the iconoclastic fury has subsided, the fires will turn from destruction to creation, forging new golden edifices for the Orthodox Church. Pens and typewriters will speak of the Regent's glory and print paeans to the Lord. Where soulless concrete once stood in the shape of monuments to workers, false monarchs and ideologues, stone and marble will rise once more.\n\nTrue art and architecture, embodying centuries of tradition, returns to the Motherland.

Not even the Blessed Regent would dare to commit the sin of diminishing them, but his regime has other priorities.\n\nThe center of attention, of late, is always the same: the great icon of Tsarevich Alexei Nikolayevich Romanov, commissioned by Regent Taboritsky and elevated to a place of pride in the Church. There were protests, cries of "Idolator!", but even men of God have limits to their courage.\n\nIn time, all Russia will venerate the blessed child of its murdered Tsar. When Alexei is found and assumes his rightful throne, the people will kneel to him as they should God's own representative on Earth.

Levi was curled up by his feet, quiet as a mouse; their boy had developed a talent for hiding, at least. Above them, he heard loud footsteps as one of the men closed the distance to his partner.\n\n"Fuck off, Semyon," came another voice, harsh and guttural. "I saw them come home half an hour ago. You must have tipped them off when you were looking through the window. They probably bolted out the back when they saw you."\n\n"Back door's still bolted from the inside, dickhead! No, they must have gone out the front when I was round the side window - where you were supposed to keep watch!"\n\nThere was a scuffle of boots on wood, and suddenly the second voice was filled with fear. "What the hell, Semyon? Put it down!"\n\n"You let them get away! It's my ass on the line now - we're both gonna fucking hang as sympathizers! They pay you for it, you fucking rat?"\n\n"Semyon, don't!" There was a crack of gunfire, and the thud of a body hitting the floor.\n\n"Fucking Jew-lover." growled Andrey, striding out of the house and slamming the door behind him. Abram gently pressed his hand to the trapdoor above him and pushed it open, lifting the rug above it. Peering out into the bedroom, he saw a large body lying still in a pool of spreading blood. Clambering out, he offered a hand to his wife and son. They had a ride to catch out of Russia."

Shortly after the establishment of the Regency, the owner, a grouchy old Tatar who had been granted it by the defunct Tatar Republic, had vanished. He was not missed by his predominantly Russian workforce, who had never been paid as much as the Tatars in his other factories. Perhaps the authoritarianism of the Regent wasn't such a terrible thing if they could put more food on the table.\n\nThen the pay cuts came. The workers came to the new state-appointed manager to complain, and were heard out. He promised change, that their interests would be taken into consideration. That was more than the old boss had ever granted them. Grousing but satisfied, they had returned to work.\n\nThe next day, things were indeed quite different. The two men who had organized them were gone, and there were six armed guards in the factory. The boss had addressed them in the morning, informing them that there was now a fixed quota, and that failing to meet it would have consequences. Anatoly disregarded the warning to work at his usual pace, humming all the while. At the end of the day, with only a third of his quota met, he was dragged outside and beaten, shot through the head by one of the guards, along with the two men who had worked alongside him. The charge for them, of course, was failing to monitor a co-worker correctly.\n\nThe next day, there were three fresh faces in Cheboksary Brickworks, and nobody failed to meet their quota."

His sense of time had rapidly eroded in the underground world he had been consigned to. There were no longer hours, days and weeks in the mines under the Ural foothills; only 'work' and 'sleep'. There was no 'breakfast, lunch and dinner'; only scraps of bread snatched from a pile left in the quarters every morning, and sips of water from the cold stream that ran parallel to the mineshaft.\n\nThere was no time for daily prayers, no comfort of a bed, no warmth of a fire. In the abyss of time in which he and the other slaves resided, there was only the banging of picks on the walls, the rattling of minecarts filled with coal being pushed uphill, and the coughing of men with lungs full of coal-dust. The only mercy for those so afflicted was death, delivered by one of the masked guards when he could work no more.\n\nMuhammad endured for longer than most. He wrapped a rag around his face, hammered away at the coal seams and continued to work despite the withering of his muscles and his fading sight.\n\nBut eventually he too collapsed, coughing black phlegm and completely blind. When the blade of mercy slid across his jugular, his last thoughts were a prayer to Allah, and gratitude that his suffering was finally at an end."

No; the Russian needed only food to survive, a simple bed upon which to sleep, and his own two feet to keep him moving. He didn't need high wages, which would only be wasted on frivolities. Radio and television? He could go to the public square and hear the Regent's announcements there. Books? What use did a worker have for pointless works of fiction and deviant art?\n\nThe Russian workers would complain, no doubt, crying out for the luxuries upon which they had become dependent. It was never going to be easy to wean them off such things and convince them to accept an austere lifestyle. It was going to be even harder to convince the Regent's supporters, who had expected 'just rewards' for their service.

Homes of the undeserving, too, were razed flat, their occupants cast out or consigned to penance through labor. In their place, new factories and offices were erected, manifestations of the efficient and pitiless state that now ruled the Russian heartlands.\n\nThe thunder of dynamite in the hills and mountains signalled the birth of hundreds of new mines and quarries. Soon, the tunnels would open up and tracks would be laid for carts. Cutting-edge industrial machines would move in to support the masses of degenerates fated to work themselves to death in the oppressive darkness. The forges of Russia would be fueled with subhuman souls.\n\nRegent Taboritsky smiled as he envisioned it. No more wasteful consumerism, no more time wasted glorifying Lenin and his Jewish cohorts.

He stopped to wait for a few minutes as the people of the sleepy suburbian street began to file out of their homes or open up windows to hear the announcement. When he was satisfied that they had fair warning, he continued.\n\n"The Blessed Regent, in his wisdom, has decreed that all precious stones, gold, silver and platinum are hereby to be confiscated for the Imperial Treasury. Resistance to this directive will be considered treason and summarily punished. Anybody found to be hiding such valuables will be charged with theft of state property and sentenced to ten years of penal labor."\n\n"Additionally, we would like to take this moment to encourage you to consider making donations to the Imperial Treasury. It is the duty of all good Christians to support God's representative on Earth. Failing to demonstrate adequate support for the Empire may lead to investigation by the Okhrana. Cooperate with your brothers in the Shturmoviki, and do your part for the reconstruction of Holy Russia!"\n\nWithout a word of resistance, the soldiers fanned out and entered the homes one by one, systematically upending them in the search for valuables when none were offered. Many also took the time to speak at length and with great vigor on the virtues of charity. Within the hour, the Shturmoviki had departed, their trucks loaded down with treasure and stacks of rubles.

Like the night sky, it loomed above, a towering vault filled with shadows and dancing lights from the fires below. Where great murals dedicated to the working class had once been splayed across the walls, now stood massive icons, paintings of soldiers and workers being blessed by angels, and the image of Tsarevich Alexei, light radiating from his youthful form.\n\nAs the workers toiled, the greatest addition of all came into play. At first none of them recognized the alien sound as it struggled to be heard over the clamor of machinery - but then the volume was cranked as high as it could go. Almost deafening to those standing near the speakers, sacred hymns flowed forth, echoing throughout the entire factory complex.\n\nAt the beginning of every day, as the workers took up their cold tools and began forging new tools of death for the Empire, a priest walked among them, swinging his censer and chanting benedictions of labor.

Go home, and think on this again."\n\nShort-sightedness? What was short-sighted about pointing out that the Empire just didn't have the money that the Regent claimed it did? If they just kept on pretending that nothing was wrong, the whole thing would collapse in... what, ten years? Twelve? Probably less. Maybe seven or eight, if Regent Taboritsky was as miserly and austere as possible. Where was the common sense in his economics? What could he possibly hope to achieve with these fraudulent policies?\n\nA knock came at Roman's door, and he rose. As soon as he turned the knob, it was kicked open, knocking him over. In strode his boss, Pyotr, and a soldier of the Shturmoviki, AK pointed squarely at Roman's chest. "Roman Semyonovich," said Pyotr with a false smile. "Have you done away with these alleged inconsistencies yet?"\n\n"No, but-"\n\n"Then you're fired," said Pyotr, turning away and heading for the door. "Clearly, you just don't have a head for accounting." The soldier squeezed off a single shot from his rifle, permanently correcting the accountant's mistake."

 komi_burgsys.21.t: "Regnal Beauty"
 komi_burgsys.21.d: "The renovations of the Regent's palace, which would of course serve the Tsarevich someday, were proceeding well. What had once been a modest old mansion converted into a Bolshevik office building was now a shining example of what Taboritsky referred to as 'purified imperial architecture. Its wings stretched out twice as far as they had previously, and the bland Bolshevik facade had been torn away and replaced with light brown stone, finely-carved wood and brass.\n\nThe interior, however, was where the true opulence of the tsars had been remade. The floor was now marble, and every piece of wood was carved and decorated. Rich purple rugs were laid out at the base of the grand staircase in the atrium. And, of course, nigh-on everything was decorated with gold leaf. Stripped from undeserving subjects, Jews, banks and heretical churches, it now adorned bannisters, tables, chairs, desks, hearths and virtually anything else that might catch one's eye.\n\nIt was the full splendor of Imperial Russia, reborn at the expense of subhumans and traitors. There could be no more fitting a tribute to the Regent who had made it all possible."

 komi_burgsys.22.t: "The Wrong Kind of Question"
 komi_burgsys.22.d: ""Mr. Markov?"\n\nMarkov looked up from the worksheets he was marking, seeing young Nikolai standing before him. The rest of the students had filed out quickly, leaving him behind; many had work to get to after school. "Yes, Nikolai?" he replied, smiling. It was always a pleasure to speak with such a bright young boy.\n\n"Mr. Markov, sir, I have a question about the Bible."\n\nThe teacher folded his hands together on his desk. "Well, Father Kirill might know more about that than me. I only know what I was taught myself at your age. Still, I'll try to give you a good answer."\n\nNikolai looked altogether too curious. "Mr. Markov, if the Bible says: 'Thou shalt not kill', why do the soldiers do it all the time?"\n\nMarkov blanched and took a moment to compose himself. "Nikolai, ah... that's a difficult question, not to mention a little unfair, don't you think?"\n\nHe shook his head. "No, Mr. Markov. I saw a soldier shoot old Mr. Androv from down the street yesterday. I know soldiers kill people in wars, but he wasn't in a war, he was just an old man who liked old, um... party music, he called it."\n\nMarkov paused, then placed a hand on Nikolai's shoulder. "Nikolai Mikhailovich, the truth is that there are some questions you shouldn't ask. It's a good thing you only asked me, because-"\n\n"Oh, I asked the soldier outside the school too, but he didn't answer me, just looked at me funny and asked my name. I told him, but he still didn't want to tell me."\n\nMarkov's heart sank, and he patted Nikolai on the head before dismissing the boy. He felt sick, and tried to bite back the tears welling in his eyes."

 komi_burgsys.23.t: "Going Nowhere"
 komi_burgsys.23.d: "Nestor was jolted awake as the truck he was riding in drove over a pothole. He was lying on the floor of the flatbed. The back of his head, where someone had struck him with a blunt object, was damp and sticky. Around him, seated and handcuffed, were people he didn't know. There were both men and women, most of the middle-aged or older. They were dressed well - fellow intellectuals, maybe?\n\n"Hey, what's going on?" he asked nobody in particular. "Where are we going?"\n\n"Where do you think?" asked an elderly woman, peering down at him through half-moon spectacles. She was sporting a nasty bruise on her forehead, and had a split lip. Nestor noticed that one of the lenses in her glasses was missing.\n\n"We're all teachers," said a younger man sitting just next to him. "Which means you must be too. We're all from the same school, but I don't recognize you."\n\nNestor's heart sank as the pieces began to come together. "I'm head of the literature department at Ust-Sysolsk University."\n\n"Bloody hell," sighed an old man with a long, white beard. Nestor noticed after a moment that he was wearing a priest's robe. "I'm sorry, my son. We're in the back of a Shturmoviki truck headed out into the countryside. Taboritsky's come for the teachers, now." Nestor sank back against the cold metal of the flatbed, ignoring the pain in his skull. Of course it had finally happened. Teachers imparted knowledge, and knowledge was power in this new, hellish vision of Russia. There was room for only one man with power in the Holy Russian Empire."

 komi_burgsys.24.d: ""So how does it work?" asked Stepanov.\n\nKrukov scratched his chin and tapped the butt of his AK as he looked up at the lazily rotating radar dish. All metal beams and wiring, it didn't look terribly impressive. "Well," he said hesitantly, "I think it sort of shoots out beams that bounce off stuff and tell you where it is."\n\n"That doesn't make any sense," Stepanov snorted. "There's nowhere for a beam to shoot out. It doesn't have a barrel or anything."\n\nKrukov rolled his eyes. "It's not a gun, dumbass. I mean it, like, it sort of emits radar, whatever that is, like how a radio tower emits radio waves.\n\n"So how do you know when it's seen something?"\n\n"Well..." Krukov wasn't sure about that. "Maybe it sends a signal when the radar beams hit something. Then you can send planes up to shoot it down."\n\nStepanov shook his head. "I don't know, man. That just seems too complicated. "Can't you just look up and see the planes coming?"\n\n"Yeah, that's what I thought too," Krukov nodded. "Maybe the Regent knows how it works. Anyway, we're just supposed to guard it, not study it, right? Lieutenant says it's important that we don't know stuff we shouldn't, for some reason. Let's keep an eye out for Jews or whoever. They probably want this thing if it's so important.""
 komi_burgsys.24.a: "A small mind is a tidy mind."

 komi_burgsys.25.t: "Breathless"
 komi_burgsys.25.d: "Oleg coughed and sputtered as he stumbled across the muddy field. A thick, gray-green fog obscured the world around him. He could only see maybe a foot ahead, so thick was the cloud. Every deep, wheezing breath drawn in through his gas mask was more difficult than the last. He could taste a chemical tinge on his tongue, and knew that the mask wasn't on correctly.\n\nSomeone stumbled out of the gas cloud and collided with him from his left, sending them both into the mud. The stranger grasped blindly as he fell, catching the lip of Oleg's mask and pulling it free. His fellow soldier hauled himself upright and pressed on without stopping, every footstep accompanied with the sucking of mud under his boots - but Oleg was choking.\n\nThe gas pressed in from all sides. His lungs burned from even the little he had inhaled before holding his breath, and his eyes were stinging and watery. Oleg kept dragging himself forwards, the mud and rainwater soaking through his fatigues. Every movement became harder as the gas pumps continued to operate, making the cloud ever thicker. "Oleg is still back there, Sergeant! I can see him moving!"\n\n"Do not help that man!" roared the NCO. "Do not help him! This is a trial you all face alone!"\n\nOleg couldn't hold his breath anymore, and reflexively gasped for air, instantly drawing in a lungful of foul, acrid chlorine gas. It burned like fire in his throat. His lungs tried in vain to exhale it, to find some fresh air - but there was nothing around him save for billowing gas, choking the life out of the unfortunate private."
 komi_burgsys.25.a: "Even training has casualties."

 komi_burgsys.26.t: "Receiving the Salute"
 komi_burgsys.26.d: "The first graduates of the Vyatka General Staff Academy paraded past the Regent, straight-backed and sharply dressed. Goose-stepping in the German fashion, AKs shouldered, snapping fascist salutes as they passed his podium, they were true paragons of the new Imperial Army. The Regent did not smile, but returned their salute, his arm held high; one of the elements of National Socialism he appreciated the most. He thought the salute had a certain pleasing aesthetic quality to it. His arm dropped as the last officers on foot finished their passage.\n\nHopefully, he found himself thinking, they would prove more competent than the generation of their grandfathers. Those damned White Army snakes... save for a few brilliant minds like Denikin and Kornilov, they had been incompetents and traitors to a man. If the arrogant fool Kolchak hadn't been so obsessed with his image, if he had actually recognized the true threat and rallied around the cross...\n\nShaking his head and blinking away the lights of the skein that had begun to appear, Taboritsky raised his arm again as the cavalry officers approached. Dressed in black, traditional-style uniforms with just a hint of SS influence and the crested helms of 19th-century cuirassiers, they cut daring figures indeed. They wouldn't look quite as impressive in tankers' uniforms, but the Regent dismissed that fact and allowed himself a moment to luxuriate in the sight. This was what he hoped to leave the Tsarevich once he was found: men who were brave, loyal and true, not to mention traditionalists to the bone. There would be no communists or half-breeds in the Empire's officer corps so long as he lived."
 komi_burgsys.26.a: "Exemplars of the pure race!"

 komi_burgsys.27.t: "Pride in Our Soldiers"
 komi_burgsys.27.d: "The parade assembled to march down the streets of the capital was like nothing that had been seen since the days of the Soviet Union. Every single subject residing there had been summoned from their homes on pain of death to witness it - and with good reason. When the skeptics and dissenters saw what the Regent they loathed had assembled, their blood ran cold.\n\nTens of thousands of black-uniformed men marched in perfect formation down the main avenue towards the Regent's Palace. Their goose-stepping boots beat out a steady tattoo on the cobblestones, like the war-drums of Heaven. Individual men disappeared under the vast carpet of shiny black helmets, their identities subsumed into a single terrifying whole. Many onlookers found themselves cheering despite their trepidation, swept up by the sublime display of power before them.\n\nIn the soldiers' wake came the vehicles: trucks, half-tracks, IFVs, and tanks, the finest that the Imperial Army could field. The missile launchers and self-propelled guns, the Regent's favorites, were given a special place of honor. There was a roar overhead, and the people looked up to see a flight of brand-new jet aircraft soar past, trailing vibrant purple smoke.\n\nAnd upon the steps of the Regent's Palace, gilded uniform glimmering in the sunlight, Sergey Taboritsky beheld his legions - and smiled."
 komi_burgsys.27.a: "Tremble, Zion, and despair."

 komi_burgsys.28.t: "In Their Thoughts"
 komi_burgsys.28.d: "Captain Chernov tapped his pen idly for a moment, then circled another name on the list of men in 2nd Platoon. Private Cherdenko... yes, he seemed suspicious enough. Thick eyebrows, dark eyes, curly hair - definitely something semitic about him. Then there was the matter of Polnikov; a good sergeant, but an ex-Eurasianist. He claimed to have only followed Gumilyov out of ignorance, but could a man of his age ever truly change? Chenov doubted it, and circled his name too.\n\nAn hour later, his Okhrana contact, Kamarov, finally arrived. "Apologies, Chernov," he said as he entered. "Terribly busy night." He lit up a makhorka cigarette and sat himself on the side of the captain's desk. "So, got enough names for me?"\n\nChernov noticed there was blood under the officer's fingernails, but simply nodded and handed him the list of men. "That's the lot, I think," he said, lighting up a smoke of his own. "Always difficult with the men sourced from border towns. Too many mongrels out there, if you ask me."\n\n"Oh, of course," agreed Kamarov. "Bolshevik cunts didn't even bother keeping an eye on the peasants, and you know what they're like. They'll fuck anything with two legs. Sometimes more, I hear!" The pair shared a chuckle, before Kamarov stubbed out his cigarette and rose to his feet again. "Anyway, I'd love to stay for a drink, Captain, but there's five other companies to review before the night's done. It's going to be a busy day tomorrow. Don't worry, I'll see what I can do about getting you some fresh meat."\n\nChernov just nodded and smiled as the Okhrana officer strode from his office. Terrible business, these lists... but if that was the price to avoid another betrayal by the soldiery - the same sort of men who had abandoned him for Suslov all those years ago - then he'd happily pay it a thousand times over."

 komi_burgsys.29.d: "Lieutenant Dragovich savored the sound of the wind whistling by his cockpit. It was an old, beat-up thing he flew, a German Dornier Do 17 that had rolled off the production line more than thirty years ago, but it still flew like a charm and was more than sufficient for the day's mission. It soared low and loud over the steppes near Orsk, at just the right height for its payload to be accurate.\n\n"Over the target in twenty seconds," he called back to his crew. "Everyone ready?" They replied in the affirmative. The seconds ticked by, and Dragovich grinned. Finally... "Bombs away!" he shouted. Reznov wrenched the lever, and the bomb bay doors swung open, sending two thousand pounds of bombs plummeting towards the village below.\n\n"Direct hit, sir!" Reznov yelled exuberantly.\n\nDragovich flew on straight for a moment, then banked hard to bring the plane around and get a good look at the target. Great billowing clouds of mustard gas had completely enveloped the collection of huts. He could see a few tiny figures fleeing into the steppes, but it seemed as though the test-run had already proven an astounding success.\n\nHe pressed the transmit button on his radio. "Command, this is Dragovich. Target expunged. Returning to base.""

 komi_burgsys.30.t: "A Cold Wind in My Mind"
 komi_burgsys.30.d: "Taboritsky stood upon the summit of Mount Yamantau, gazing down upon the vast forests and steppes of Siberia beyond. All of it - Tyumen, Omsk, Yekaterinburg - it was his. It was God's. From the Ural Mountains to the taiga bordering Central Siberia, the divine rule of the Regency had spread its wings to bathe fully half of Russia in the safety of its shadow.\n\nAwareness of his power strengthened him, filling his aging bones with vigor, but he knew the fight was far from over. Order still had to be brought to the east, to the shores of Lake Baikal and then to the Pacific, but...\n\nA frigid wind swept down from the north, making him shiver despite his greatcoat. He knew that Siberia held many perils of its own, and purifying it in its entirety would be a challenge far greater than any he had yet faced. Yet, he had to do it, had to spread God's light to the furthest reaches of Russia. Only when it shone from the desert of Kazakhstan to the frozen north would his rule be secure.\n\nTaboritsky blinked away the skein as it began to dance across the horizon. Now wasn't the time. He turned and marched back to his helicopter, pondering all the ways in which his new conquests might best be purified."

 komi_burgsys.31.t: "The Finer Details"
 komi_burgsys.31.d: "The Regent growled in frustration and scrunched up another rough draft before tossing it into the bin beside his desk. He fumed silently as he fetched another piece of paper and slumped back into his chair, pen at the ready for when inspiration struck.\n\nDetails, details, details. He loathed this sort of drudgery, but knew it to be necessary. He knew subhumans on sight, of course. The telltale signs were present in their eyes, in their manner, in the way they moved. But other men - lesser men - were blind compared to him. Barring obvious physical features, there was no way for them to spot infiltrators in their midst. No doubt some were happy to be so naturally ignorant, since it meant less work for them to do. He'd have to see to that, as well; reinstate flogging, maybe.\n\n"The Jew is most easily recognizable by its physical features," he began, muttering as he wrote. "These include the following: a large, hooked nose; curly hair; a swarthy countenance; dark eyes; compulsive behaviour in the presence of gold; and so on..."\n\nAn hour later, Taboritsky's work was done. The first chapter of the Imperial Codex of Racial Purity was complete. "Now," he muttered, "Where to begin with the Tatars?""

 komi_burgsys.32.d: ""Hey, you!" barked a commanding voice from behind Samuil. "Stop where you are!" He complied, hands shooting up in the air instinctively - a wise decision, as he also heard the clack of a rifle being cocked.\n\nA uniformed soldier stepped in front of him, face covered by a balaclava. Only his eyes, devoid of pity, shone out from amongst the black wool. They tracked up and down, taking in the sight of Samuil's filthy, matted beard and ragged clothing. "Homeless?" came the question, dripping with judgement and disdain.\n\n"Yes, sir," Samuil said timidly. What did these men want with him? He wasn't a Red, or a Jew, or whatever. He was just trying to survive on the streets of Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nThe soldier produced a pair of handcuffs. "Hands out. You're under arrest."\n\nSamuil could only stammer protests as his hands were drawn behind his back and cuffed. The cold steel was poorly forged, and was too tight around his wrists. "W-w-what have I done? Please, sir, I'm just a-"\n\n"A vagrant," sneered the soldier. "What, you haven't been paying attention to the decree that's gone up all over the city?" He clipped Samuil around the ear, knocking him to the ground. "You blind or something? Answer me, you fuck!" A swift kick in the gut followed, and the old man curled up, sobbing quietly. "Private, get this piece of shit to the truck. Shoot him if he tries to run. I'm going to see if he's got any friends hiding around here.""

 komi_burgsys.33.t: "To Ashes"
 komi_burgsys.33.d: ""Heretics and blasphemers can offer no excuse for their crimes!" shouted the Shturmoviki sergeant, pacing back and forth on the stage erected in the town square. He carried a lit torch in his hand. "To pardon them is to only further shroud humanity's light with the darkness of their souls! For these wretches, death alone cannot suffice to extinguish their evil; it must also serve to purify the souls of the faithful and thereby wither the weeds of deviancy that have sprouted in their midst!"\n\nBefore him stood a stake, some eight feet tall. Tied to it, with firewood piled around his legs, was the town's esteemed priest, Father Tikhon. "Hear me!" he cried out, blood trickling through his thick brown beard. "Their Regent is the true blasphemer! He is a murderer, a traitor to God and Russia! Please, my brothers and sisters, find the courage to rise up! Cast down the tyrant! Their hate can never overcome Christ's love!"\n\n"Silence!" roared the sergeant, eyes bloodshot and bulging with fanatical rage. "Heretik Tikhon, for the crime of blasphemy against God and His Blessed Regent, I consign you to the flames! Hellfire take you, sinner!" With that, he cast the torch into the oil-doused tinder, and within seconds the priest was engulfed in flame. For all his wisdom, all his love for the people, all his courage and tenderness, Father Tikhon died screaming within the raging fire, the spark of his defiance smothered forever."

Marxist rats!"\n\nImpotently raging within his office, Taboritsky could feel the blood vessels bulging in his forehead. "Snakes, devils... you... you Jew-loving scum!" The urge to seize his pistol, storm out of the palace and shoot dead the first priest he saw was overwhelming, but he gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, trying to force the anger down to a simmer.\n\nBetrayal. Again. He'd seen it coming months ago, knew that he could never trust the clergy who constantly doubted and questioned his divine power. That was the Jewish way, wasn't it? Question after question after question. Question everything, spit on holiness without ever trusting in the faith they so readily espoused. Well, he had a solution for this. The Church needed its new Saint Peter, a great leader to show the way and slice away the fat until only the flesh and blood of true believers remained. He'd show them, those scions of Lucifer, Prince of Lies. Damned priests...\n\nSnatching up his journal and sitting down cross-legged before the hearth, he began scrawling out a new decree. "Henceforth, all clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church...""

Such was every sentence, as of that fateful morning's decree. Theft: death. Murder: death. Deviancy, defeatism, indolence: death.\n\nThe butchery was beyond imagining. Prisoners and camp inmates were shipped to makeshift courts by the truckload, all fated for the same sentence and the same end. First, there was a single mass grave outside the capital; then two, then three. By week's end, thousands were dead, the execution grounds soaked through with blood. Shturmoviki began to request breaks on the second day, but there was no such thing as a transfer in their unit. The Regent, they were told, was seeing this whole bloody affair through personally, so it was only fitting for his soldiers to follow suit.\n\nSo it was that the questions began. Worrying, treasonous questions. And the sentence for treason: death. The bodies continued to pile up, more mass graves were dug, and the Regent's fury was unending."

 komi_burgsys.36.d: "Taboritsky sat upon his throne for the first time in months. Fingers steepled and legs crossed, he stared out into the empty throne room before him. It was the middle of the day, yet nobody came to the Regent's Palace anymore unless they had to. That struck him as curious. Where were the petitioners and the mothers asking him to bless their children? Where were the generals kneeling before him with news of great conquests? Where was his trusted spymaster with news of Tsarevich Alexei's whereabouts?\n\nMore than the physical isolation, Taboritsky also had a gut feeling that something was wrong with the throne room. He had first sensed it months ago, and it had kept him confined to his study ever since, but today - today, he had to know if it was real, if his mind was just playing tricks on him. And, indeed, there it was: loneliness. Not the absence of people, but of God. In that throne room, with its golden throne and gilded, mosaic-covered ceiling, God seemed curiously absent.\n\nGoosebumps ran up Taboritsky's spine as he contemplated the thought. It wasn't possible. All he had done, he had done for God, Russia and the Tsarevich. He couldn't be alone. He couldn't have made a mistake.\n\nThe Regent leapt from his throne, suddenly disturbed and trembling. Abject terror filled his body and turned his blood to ice - but he hadn't any idea why. Striding from the throne room and back to his study, he slumped down in front of the hearth, gazing into the flames.\n\nAnd a spark of doubt flickered in his soul."

Subjects demonstrated confusion and some degree of resistance, likely owing to their good physical status.\n\nCompound C-32/44 was introduced via pumps 30 seconds after chamber door was sealed. Effects were immediate and drastic. Dense nature of the gas causes rapid onset of symptoms. Coughing and shortness of breath began almost immediately after exposure. Subjects began coughing blood, likely showing breakdown of lung tissue. Corrosive nature of compound was readily apparent. Skin began to burn and blister less than thirty seconds after exposure. Close inspection revealed that gums were bleeding, and skin appeared to be actively dissolving at a slow rate. All twelve subjects were confirmed deceased within three minutes.\n\nUncertain what denseness of gas is required to cause rapid corrosion of organic matter, but the rapid onset of the desired symptom is a promising sign. Subjects continued to rapidly disintegrate after death. Test chamber has yet to be cleaned, as nobody has the stomach to enter and we are unable to drain the thick organic slurry that has formed from the flesh, blood and organs of the deceased subjects.\n\nGod save the Regent!"

A cool breeze blew across the steppes, carrying with it the scent of the river and the great lands of Russia beyond.\n\nThe sheep had just set about their grazing, and Ruslan had sat down, when a distant sound caught his attention. It sounded like the rushing of a mountain waterfall leagues away, but there was no such thing near his village. The nearest mountains were hundreds of kilometers away, at least.\n\nIt seemed to be coming from the sky. He glanced up, and tilted his head in puzzlement. Was that a star? It was so bright, and moving so fast. He knew that even shooting stars were difficult to see in the daytime. Whatever it was, it was moving south and east, towards the deserts of Kazakhstan. Or so he thought - as he watched, it tilted, and began to descend. It fell faster and faster, until its body was visible, long and white, reflecting the sun and trailing fire and smoke. Before the shock and terror could register on his face, the missile struck home, and all that Ruslan had ever known vanished in thunder and flame."

 komi_clockworks.1.d: "The Regent lay there, in his silken bed. The darkened ceiling swarmed with the tell-tale lines of the skein - lines of indescribable color that lanced through his view of the snuffed-out chandelier. They danced for him, up there, but he knew that if he stood up, he could not reach them - they were too far away. Too distant.\n\nThrough watching them, he had tracked the progress of his ascension. The trek of the Tsarevich, the rightful heir, from Yekaterinburg. They stood fast, however. Where had he gone? They would not have disappeared if he died - for the skein tracks the immortal soul, not the fallible body. To the Regent, that was the mystery of it all. In the lines, he could watch them. He could know who was plotting against him, who was secretly calling him a madman. On those threads, he saw himself binding them, giving the attention of the Okhrana, until they told him all of what they had done. What they could do. Who they were. No matter how careful the lie, or how much the liar begging that he was innocent, he saw the patterns. The weave of Heaven.\n\nHe blinked, and, for a moment, he saw a flash of inspiration. Something new, moving in the skein. A new line. He twisted it around in his mind, and let the gaps be filled. It was something new, interlocking around the strings. Pulling them in. Coalescing from dust, like his Russia had. A miracle. A loom with which to weave the future. The strings needed an engine to drive them.\n\nThe Regent opened his eyes, gazing around the room. The journal sat on his nightstand, enticing his attention. He knew which way the clock would turn. But - did his treasury? Did the people? The Court?\n\nHe picked it up, along with his pen. He would tell them to adjust their habits at once. The letter would be sent in the morning. They had to know."

No man of the cloth would ever understand.\n\nHe knew that they still thought themselves above him. The arrogance of priests was boundless and their propensity for betrayal well-known. After all, it had been a priest who led the treacherous workers to their deaths in 1905. Even then, the Judeo-Bolshevik puppeteers had been working to destroy the Empire.\n\nHe shivered at the thought. He had to remain loyal to his faith, but what of the Orthodox Church? They were still just men, and didn't understand God like he did. For them, religion was all rules and ritual. Taboritsky knew that faith had to be followed with action; no amount of prayer would ever save Russia. God would surely favor him, but only if he first proved himself worthy by great deeds.\n\nTaboritsky rose, and steeled his mind as the whispers of angels drifted to his ears again. Nobody would stand in the path of Holy Russia or the restoration of its true monarch - neither heathen nor Pharisee."

 komi_clockworks.4.d: ""Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus." - Philippians 1:6\n\nMere years ago, it seemed almost inconceivable that I would ever succeed in the task that the Lord set before me. When I turned my back on the pretender Vladimir Kirillovich and began the trek northwards with my followers, I was derided as a madman. Indeed, I doubt I was missed by the populace of Vyatka at large, being the only one bold enough to advocate for adopting German methods in our crusade against the unrighteous.\n\nPerhaps that was to be expected. Lesser men rarely have the willpower to do what must be done. That task falls to great men of destiny like Adolf Hitler - and myself, I suppose. Even now, I am more than aware of what my supposed benefactor, the two-faced Lev Nikolayevich, says about me from the safety of exile. He calls me a mere Nazi esoteric, deriding me for crushing his iconoclastic vision of 'Eurasia'.\n\nTruthfully, I harbor no resentment towards such men. God would not have sent them to my aid if they were truly evil. Besides, is forgiveness not among the highest of virtues? Perhaps someday, my fellows in Ust-Sysolsk's rightist bloc will return and find their place in the grand design. I shall ask Saint Ephraim the Syrian to intercede on their behalf and show them the true path to salvation. God willing, they will come to understand in time."

Steady progress, no hesitation, no doubling back, lest we lose sight of the path. One expected more difficulties than one has thus far encountered. After all, OVRI did not enjoy the same luxuries that Hitler did when the time came to assume power. We had no gullible civilian government that could be swayed to our side, nor did we have the full confidence of a large, revanchist military.\n\nThe greatest resistance has been from the same expected source: the Reds, who continue to assail us despite their defeat. It seems that they have learned some valuable lessons in obstinacy from their verminous masters. No matter how hard one stomps down the boot and grinds them under heel, they somehow manage to return, time and again, to torment Russia.\n\nThis persistence is most concerning. The process of reorganization is only going to intensify with the passage of time, and the regency cannot afford continued assaults on its subjects. The Imperial Army must increase its efforts and smoke out the Jew-atheists before they can multiply in number."

 komi_clockworks.6.d: ""A wise heart shall acquire knowledge: and the ear of the wise seeketh instruction." - Proverbs 18:15\n\nDoes the soul reside within the clay of the body, or is there some means by which an immaterial spirit might interface with flesh? Science has dug deep into the physical nature of humanity, but no answers yet present themselves. When I resided in Berlin, I heard tell of many developments in psychology and the philosophy of mind, but - there's the rub. But. There was always a but - the developments were theoretical, or speculative, or devised by a Jew. I suspect the latter is the case throughout the world of academia.\n\nFor my part, I would theorize that the question of soul-mind-body interaction is to remain forever unsolved. I have my own idea - that the brain contains some kind of lattice that serves as a conduit for the soul's energies - but I can never prove or disprove it. Like those esteemed academics, I can only ponder. The difference between us, of course, is that I would never enter such a passive, layabout profession.\n\nMen of letters and wisdom are necessary, but... troublesome. The whispers of Zionist propaganda echo loudly in the halls of learning. Was it not from academia that Bolshevism first sprang, rather than the proletariat? I worry for the future of Russia's youth should we fail to root out the rot before rebuilding our academic tradition."

 komi_clockworks.7.d: ""Thou are spent with foolish labour, both thou and this people that is with thee: the business is above thy strength, thou alone canst not bear it." - Exodus 18:18\n\nCan the working man ever truly be liberated from Bolshevism? It seems that there is something about his nature that makes him inherently vulnerable to its charms. Even in the so-called 'social democratic' system, he always agitates for more. More money, more free time, more benefits. He is never satisfied so long as he possesses a democratic voice.\n\nThere are two solutions to this problem of the working man's greed. The first is to place him in charge of the state - to accept Bolshevik rule. Obviously this is preposterous, not to mention utterly unthinkable to any good Russian. The second is to do precisely the opposite of what he desires; to crush his autonomy, to diminish his wages, to take away his 'rights'. This second solution would appear counterintuitive at first, but has enjoyed great success in Germany.\n\nWhy is this? I suspect it is because the working man has rebellion in his blood. Perhaps this is a trait inherited from peasant ancestry? That would explain why rebellions in recent centuries have usually emerged from below rather than from the nobility. Regardless, it is clear that to truly liberate the working man's spirit, he must be broken and forced to bow to his betters. If he cannot see any means of ascending beyond his appointed station, his ambition will be curtailed. Applied on a grand scale, perhaps submissiveness can be bred back into the lower classes, so that the Bolsheviks might never again find an audience amongst the commoners."

The doubters, those fork-tongued deceivers, have grown in number. They think, now, to betray me. They think that I am ignorant of what happens in the dark corners of taverns, in their homes, in the deep woods. Confronted with their misdeeds, they say: "Your Eminence, you are mistaken. We are, all of us, loyal and pious men. Your word is law, and we shall not disobey."\n\nIt saddens me deeply to see men I once thought honorable and trustworthy led astray. Even in victory, one feels defeated. How am I to carry out my task when even those sent to aid me are seduced by the Prince of Lies? Is this, too, some manner of test? Am I\n\nYES. Damnation, but I have been a blind fool. How could I ever have thought otherwise? The Lord tests us constantly, does He not? Is that not His right, as creator of all? Do we, sinful and weak-spirited mortals, deserve anything less than constant scrutiny? Of course not. God watches us, always judging, always testing our faith. Perhaps this is a sign - one that I have been too blind to see. But no longer. I will ensure there is nothing beyond my sight, nothing beyond my knowledge.

My own people - the pure race - see the degeneracy and profligacy of the West, and think it virtuous. They look at bourgeois Americans and see a 'liberated' and 'prosperous' people. How can they be so blind? How can they fail to see the golden strings upon which the Elders of Zion make them dance?\n\nAnd then they talk of social mobility! The very thing which sparked the downfall of the Empire! Was it not with promises of rising to power that the Bolsheviks seduced the workers? Was it not to the nascent middle class that the backstabber Kerensky appealed?\n\nEveryone has their place. It has been that way for thousands of years, long before Russia ever united. The Jews' constant attempts to break down the fabric of society, to force the lambs to lie down with the lions, has ALWAYS been their primary means of undermining civilization. Am I the only man in all Creation who understands that? Even the Germans, virtuous as they are, have the order of their nation in disarray! Where is their Kaiser, their nobility?

How long have we fought against the people who plague us? A thousand years? Two thousand? Before the Russians came to the true faith and founded Kievan Rus', did we wage war unending upon the people of the steppes, the Udmurts, the Komi and the Finns?\n\nWe must have. War is the means by which the strong thrive and proliferate further. The Russians are not mere survivors! We are conquerors, champions, paragons of civilization! It is for that purpose that we have no need of sly trickery, the likes of which Jews employ. We have never had to win a war by turning one foe against another. Not once has Russia been defeated by conventional means; the Germans faced only our red doppelganger, and we would have crushed the Japanese in 1905 if Anglo-Jewish interests had not subverted our glorious navy!\n\nWe can't let it happen again. We came so close to total destruction during the civil war. If God had not favored me, I never would have survived the accursed Republic's intrigues alone. We need to be stronger - much stronger. We have to match the Germans, at the very least, but even that may not be enough. Jewish subterfuge grows more complex by the day.

Zionists might never have become a nuisance if that had been the case. One admits, it is a pleasant thought - history without Jews, a world ruled only by those appointed by God, or at least by the deserving.\n\nBut it is a fool's hope to wish for money to be abolished. It has become humanity's hereditary curse, as inextricably tied to our existence as original sin. One simply has to bear it and pray for deliverance. But, that aside, the sheer obsession of so many in Russia with money is abhorrent. Everything is about cost, about budgeting, about affordability. And the economics! One has had quite enough of those self-proclaimed 'experts' telling one what to do.\n\nWe are Russia! We don't need Swiss watches or American cars to sustain ourselves! We don't need to make ourselves dependent on lesser nations to succeed - why, one wonders, does anyone even suggest such a thing? Do they think nothing of consequences? The moment we engage with international Jewish finance, they will have their claws in us again!

It felt as though every pair of hands besides one's own was idle before now, and every man knows that the Devil has a multitude of uses for such things.\n\nReplacement of the previous palatial staff was not as easy as one hoped.

No amount of Jewish brainwashing can render one immune to the lash of divine truth.\n\nSo, now they plague Russia no longer. Our blessed Tsarevich will never need to fear unfaithful servants with the lessons that his Regent has imparted today. The natural order has been disrupted for so long that one is inclined to forget that servants are a class unto themselves. They have an alarming tendency towards laxity and corruption when spared the whip for too long. Sometimes, as recently, the gangrenous presence of treason goes unnoticed and sets in.

Promises of financial reward are a powerful incentive. German methods at work once more, effective as ever.\n\nThe search for Tsarevich Alexei proceeds as usual. Leads are scarce.

 komi_clockworks.27.d: "Ink spurted and splattered across the page as Taboritsky scrawled away. His hands trembled as though afflicted with a palsy. Sweat ran down his face in streams, darkening the blood-crusted and ink-stained paper. His eyes were bloodshot and weepy; he had not slept in days. He no longer sat at his desk - it was too near the window, where God could peer down from the Heavens to look upon him with shame. Instead, he was curled up in a corner, back aching, feverishly scribbling. He stared straight ahead, hands moving on their own. He hadn't written anything resembling a word in a week.\n\nThere was a sound, a scuffling of boots on marble. The Regent glanced up, and felt his heart freeze. His pen clattered to the floor. He tried to stand, but his legs were like lead, and he stumbled to his knees. As he dragged himself forwards, he felt the strength begin to drain from his arms. A pounding began to thrum in his head, a pain like no other - but he pressed forth.\n\nFor how could any man not be enraptured in the presence of his Tsar?\n\nHis dark hair was cropped short beneath the golden crown. He wore a cape of ermine, and was bedecked in gold and jewels. He looked older than the Regent had expected, but shone with the light of Heaven, an immortal sovereign for the Holy Russian Empire. Taboritsky opened his mouth to speak, to question, to marvel - but the words would not come to him. The divine grace of his monarch was overpowering, paralyzing his entire body. Every muscle had turned to stone. He blinked - and finally uttered a scream.\n\nBones. A small skull with a bullet-hole in it. Scraps of fine royal clothing stained with old blood were laid over them. The scream turned to a choking gurgle as the pain exploded inside his head, blacking out his senses. He collapsed, staring in horror into the darkness around him.\n\nAnd Sergey Taboritsky, Blessed Regent of Holy Russia, breathed his last."

The clouds were thick tonight, and not even the faintest moonbeam shone through the high windows.\n\nAfter several minutes, he heard distant whispers and a presence on either side of him. He felt a mild pang of disappointment; it seemed that Tsarevich Alexei had deigned only to send a pair of angels in his stead. Quickly dismissing such selfish emotions, the Regent raised his hands and spoke again: "Greetings, servants of the Lord. I humbly ask that you infuse my soul with light, that I might see through the shadows that bar my way."\n\nThe whispers grew louder. Though Taboritsky could not comprehend the language, somehow he still understood their meaning. "Yes," he muttered, sweat dripping down his forehead despite the cold.

True, he usually saw the skein at night, but there had been exceptions, and there was no reason to believe that his appeal would go unheard during daylight hours. The sun's light shone upon the altar, dazzling him with golden radiance.\n\nSuddenly, he gasped. There were no whispers, but he had definitely just felt a pair of strong hands grasp his shoulders. Firm and masculine, they definitely belonged to a stronger sort of heavenly servant. "O servant of the Lord," he said, voice quavering with emotion, "I seek greater knowledge of my sovereign. Tell me: does he reside within the Regency's demesne?"\n\nSomething prodded Taboritsky's mind, and he understood. Against the protests of his feeble flesh, he opened his eyes wide and stared into the blinding light reflected off the altar. It seared his vision and set his head pounding, but within he saw the glimmer of wisdom, and smiled despite the disappointing answer from his master."

Falling from his knees to all fours, he caught himself just in time. As he looked up, his eyes fell upon the portrait of the Theotokos, and his mind was filled with an overwhelming radiance.\n\n"Mother of Christ, I hear you!" he gasped. "Oh, Blessed Virgin, you honor me beyond measure! Please, tell me: where is Tsarevich Alexei? Does he lie within reach yet?"\n\nThe world spun around Taboritsky, and he flopped to the floor, breathless. "No," he muttered as the light faded from his mind. "No, of course not.

Taboritsky shouted, suddenly demanding. "Name yourself! Do you speak for Heaven, or the black lord of Hell?\n\nThere was no answer, only silence and emptiness, but Taboritsky knew what it had really been. "Begone, Satan!" he spat into the darkness.

Blinding light sliced into his soul, setting it aflame with heavenly fire. He slumped backwards, staring up at the ceiling where the skein danced, utterly transfixed. Within its folds and creases, he saw such knowledge as had been forgotten aeons prior. His eyes rolled back into his head, unable to bear the torrent of wisdom that poured into his mind, and he blacked out.\n\nWhen Taboritsky came to, he was lying on his back, drenched in sweat. As he opened his eyes, he saw that the world was bathed in a beautiful, yet eerie magenta light. It seemed to permeate all around him; when he stood and looked down at his hands, he saw that his skin was black, and his veins had turned to gold. He blinked in shock - and suddenly, everything had returned to normal. His mind ran over with lost knowledge, dizzying him. Grasping the altar to avoid falling over again, Taboritsky exhaled and wiped the sweat from his brow, utterly overwhelmed. He would need time to process what God had just bestowed upon him."

Don't go running off to try and find me."\n\nHis son, always shining like the sun, saluted with a bold "Yes, sir!" eliciting a smile from his mother.\n\n"Alright," Semyon muttered.

"This won't do. It's almost eleven o'clock." She finished undoing one bootlace and began to gently pry the sweat-dampened leather away from a worn and threadbare sock. Through the holes in the wool, she could see patches of skin rubbed raw and red during Semyon's interminable shifts.\n\n"I'm sorry, love," Semyon said, his voice a throaty whisper. "They wanted double quota today. Nobody else could leave early, either. Someone..." he paused. The man's name, it was...\n\n"Feodor," he said at last, with a pained grunt as his other boot was finally tugged free.

Dismissing it didn't come easily to her, and the word left an acrid taste on her tongue the moment it left her mouth. "You're home now. Don't think about that."

There wasn't enough coal for both dinner and a fire, Papa said, but it had been weeks since they'd been warm. Mama wouldn't let him or Svetlana go out to find any, either. All they did was go to school, go to church and eat the same boring dinner every day. He couldn't even go out to play with Vlad's boy from next door anymore.\n\nSuddenly, there was a muffled crash. Svetlana yelped in fright and dropped her spoon with a clatter. Mama froze. Papa paused for a moment, but kept eating, arm rising and falling mechanically as he tried to fill his empty stomach. Alex stared in the direction the sound had come from - the wall dividing their home from Vlad's.\n\nThrough the wood and plaster, he could hear shouting. "Down, you rats!" a thunderous voice boomed. "Head against the floor!" Someone shouted back, lacking the volume to make their words distinguishable. "Shut up, pig! You, woman, where is he? Where's your bastard father?"\n\nAlex's attention was snatched away by the sudden rapping of Papa's knuckles on the wooden table. His father was staring at him over the empty pot at the table's center. There was neither anger nor affection in his eyes. "Don't, Alex." As to what he didn't want Alex to do - he never said. He just lowered his gaze to the bowl and kept spooning soup into his mouth, wilfully oblivious.

To hell with him and his stubborn selflessness; he worked harder than any of them and had to eat more than herself or Mama did. The sound of marching jackboots approached, prompting her to duck down behind a low wall. Another Shturmoviki patrol, the third she'd had to dodge in the past hour. Every day, it seemingly got harder to get around after curfew.\n\nWhen she finally reached home, night had fallen in earnest. She crawled through the open bathroom window round back rather than the front door, for they would be watching the front. Her parents were both waiting in the darkened room. A momentary fear flashed in Svetlana's soul as she saw the hunger glimmering in their candlelit eyes, before remembering she must have looked much the same. Wordlessly, she emptied her small cloth bag onto the vinyl floor.\n\nTwo rats. A loaf of rock-hard bread, which it looked like they'd been nibbling on. Three soft, slightly brown apples.\n\nIt had to do. They each took an apple, while Mama also scooped up the rats and bread before tottering away to the kitchen. The candle's flame puffed out as a draft blew through the open window. Svetlana heard her father, pressed against the wall, bite carefully into the over-ripe fruit and gag slightly at the texture.\n\nLeaving the grim, gloomy bathroom behind her, Svetlana padded through her dimly-lit home and up the stairs to her bedroom. Her eyes were cast downwards as she passed Alex's old room, for even the sight of his name etched on the door was enough to clench her heart tight and elicit a dehydrating flow of tears.

It was a beautiful place, perfectly in line with the vision of the Blessed Regent. Neat, orderly, secure - a polished and perfected sample of the purified civilisation that would await Tsarevich Alexei when he returned to assume his throne.\n\nThere was no dissent in the street. No protestors, no workers on the march, not even people breaking curfew. Everyone had their place and kept to it. The soldiers never saw the workers who resided there depart for their assigned work, and that was ideal. No need to stop and harass people for their papers and identification. As far as the Shturmoviki on patrol knew, each and every subject of the Empire on that street was carrying out their duty to God and Regent with well-honed diligence.\n\nAccording to the Okhrana who surveyed the area regularly, the house in the very middle of the street was home to the ideal Russian family. A man and a woman, joined in holy matrimony; a beautiful daughter; a strong and pure son. The father worked at the Ust-Sysolsk Small Arms Factory, producing machine-gun barrels. The mother kept the home in order, as was her duty, while the daughter learned domestic arts and the son trained with the Shturmoviki Youth Movement. Perfection in the flesh, surpassed only by the Tsarevich and his chosen servants.\n\nOf the son's slow, shivering death by pneumonia, nothing was noted. The daughter's disappearance after being caught by a patrol went unnoticed. The wife's body, slit wrists no longer streaming arterial blood, rested within the stagnant, crimson water in her bathtub. The father, who had been beaten, flogged and shot for striking a supervisor, was merely one more decaying cadaver in a mass grave outside his workplace.

And what did it mean to give these Proletarians, if that was indeed their true name, the means of production? Would the committees be run by the elite, who after all were used to power, or to unsteady newbies whose enthusiasm far outstripped their experience?\n\nNot to mention the matter of who the Enemy was, of course. Oh, everyone knew there was an Enemy: the propaganda rang true, and the paranoia was fresh and bright as the smell of blood in the winter snow. They lurked behind every doorway, their subtle strings tugging at the Russian heart, angling innocents into complacency, parasitism. Sin.\n\nThe question remained, unanswered and unanswerable, a dagger at the heart of Serov's movement. Who was the Enemy? And if they were a class in a classless society, both of which the Marxists were adamant about, how could one ever tell an Enemy from a friend?\n\nIn the end it simply wasn't worth the trouble, fighting over a deafening void and a slowly collapsing loyalty to a silent leader. The Passionariyy elements seemed to fall away all at once from the base Serov used to pummel legislation through the Assembly, as if some invisible chain had been lifted, and it was clear that something fundamental had changed in the Republic.\n\nLike most divorces, it was quiet at the end.

He had spoken of a future with land, bread and solidarity for all, and unlike the others he seemed to believe in the peace he spoke of. It was all catnip for Lavov, who'd hated the sight of guns since his father perished in the fall of the Union. The errant rabble who called themselves the Left hadn't been any more convincing than the drooling reactionaries they opposed on this point: all and sundry seemed determined to march into the sunset, toting a gun on one hand and their enemies' skulls on the other.\n\nOnly General Secretary Serov had promised true peace, true unity. And Lavov knew, with all the quiet absolution of a true believer, that Serov would deliver.\n\nAnd he had, hadn't he?

But some things were unavoidable, and important enough for the Party to address - so a working holiday was declared and the various Congresses and the Workers' Councils convened.\n\nSerov gazed at them. Talent, certainly, but unpolished. Blunt and dull, like steel that had been left in dank air too long - edgeless. It would take work to weave them all into a knife worth wielding, and if he wanted to succeed, he would have to start now.\n\nHe asked the simple question, left it hanging in the air like a noose, an invitation.

Raising a piece of paper, he began to read names: the loud, the outspoken, the complainers and the whiners and the fearful. They were, he said, welcome to leave - but should they stay, they would be honed into something better. Something greater. Demotions, of course, would follow, even revolutionary criticism.

The old Soviet Union had been too weak, too divided. The old Soviet Union sacrificed so much, for so little gain. Serov and his government would remedy these mistakes, and the new Soviet Union would emerge from the ashes stronger than ever before.\n\nOne of the greatest weaknesses of the old Soviet Union was its federalized structure. The bureaucracy became bloated, and local governments were given far too much autonomy. One only has to look at what Kaganovich did with Western Siberia to see why that was a mistake. Serov's new Soviet Union would be unitary in structure. Local governments would be a mere stepping stone between the people and the capital, and all major decisions would go through the central administration first. The unitary structure proved its efficacy in World War II, with the strong, united Japanese and Germans defeating the fractured Americans. The same unitary structure would be applied to any formerly autonomous administrations, as giving the minorities their own identity merely weakened the Union's cohesion.\n\nThe Soviet Union was a Russian invention, and yet Bukharin sacrificed so much to try and please the other peoples within its borders. The Ukrainians, Belarusians, the Baltics, and the Turks, they did not answer directly to the capital, and therefore did not identify truly with Moscow. In the end, their loyalty failed us when it mattered most, and proves that they can't be trusted with the same freedoms Bukharin afforded them.

It was a game, Serov thought, a high-stakes game for the future itself. And the time had come to pick his allies.\n\nThe old cults of Taboritsky, Shafarevich and Gumilyov lurked in his base still. He knew, staring at those politely clapping for the latest speaker, that they could never be trusted with the will of the people - they barely trusted him at the best of times. He was always dancing on eggshells, hiding his real beliefs under a constantly shifting series of dogwhistles and promises of "right unity". Where had that gotten him? A place in the most unstable chair in Russia, and a mandate he burned to fulfill but struggled to speak aloud.\n\nHe looked across now to the ones he'd left behind.

Moving to the 'Internal Enemies' section, however...that was promising in a way mere centralism had never been.\n\nYes, if there was one thing Serov knew best in his long years of serving the Republican Left, it was the rooting out of enemies - and the many ways one developed of finding them. For the people had many enemies, but some would always be less disguised, less disguisable, than others."

 komi_natsoc.7.d: ""Comrades, workers, have we not seen the true face of Imperialism? Yes, my friends, today I speak of international capital in its most savage and unrelenting form. All of us were brought here by the winds of fate, but it was Fascism that channeled those winds and brought the Union down from atop our heads. We all remember the days of fear, the days of the Swastika and the Boche."\n\n"Now I ask: Why was it the German that brought Russia to ruin? Why was the German form simultaneously so coarse as to drive all to destruction before it, and so strong it managed to blight half of Russia before it was stopped? More importantly, we have heard so much, over the years, as to the Americans and their fabled salvation in bombs and planes - why is it that these so-called Americans are worshipped when they have never even stepped foot in the Rodina?"\n\n"The answer is simple, and I believe it lies in the same ethnogenetic patterns that have borne our true and perfect Workers' State into being. The Americans, the Germans - they are not, as some would believe, in perpetual conflict. No, the capital-parasites that govern the American economy would gladly have us lap up the lie that their so-called "Liberalism" is in conflict with Fascism, so much so that they would see it destroyed everywhere! What nonsensical rhetoric from such a mighty nation!"\n\n"No, their real and perpetual enemy has been bred into their very genes, the codes of life that govern America, Japan, Germany - the monstrous Capital-Fascists of the world are immune to mercy precisely because they are by nature incorruptible from their original form.

The Ordosocialist Man is a useful tool for further instilling and cultivating the correct values in the populace, and it should help Ordosocialism permeate the ordinary routines of daily life.\n\nThe new Ordosocialist Man is to be selfless, learned, athletic, and enthusiastic in spreading the Ordosocialist Revolution. The Ordosocialist Man is not driven by crude impulses of nature, but by conscious self-mastery, a rejection of the unconscious and the innate personality. His work should require exertion and self-improvement, the ideal example of the Ordosocialist Man should always aspire to break his record quotas for each day of work.\n\nThe Ordosocialist Man would be conscientious of class and national struggles. He lives and dies by the teachings of Ordosocialism, Marx, and Serov. He gives all he can to his country, to Russia. He treats public property with respect, as if it were his own. He decries and denounces the capitalists and imperialists of the world, praises and supports the military, and answers the call of duty when his home finds itself at war, without hesitation.\n\nAbove all else, the new Ordosocialist Man obeys Serov and his teachings. He informs his authorities of dissidents. He combats the reactionary threat wherever it may appear, even if it rears its head within his own family. He serves his government and leader with everything he has, for that is every citizen's duty."

 komi_natsoc.9.d: "Sergei fiddled with his food, if he could even call it that. Next to him Vera made a face and made as if to spit the offending mouthful away. "This tasteless garbage is worse than the stuff my aunt used to make - and she was blind, mind you." Surovov nodded from opposite them, pushing the plate to his empty left. This Workers' Canteen was getting off to a very rocky start, from all appearances.\n\nIt had started with the announcement that the factory would be nationalised - for all the groaning that had brought the higher-ups, Sergei had stowed away a little hope for the future. After all, the new folks in the Capital said the name of the Workers like it was some kind of lucky charm, and surely they wouldn't just let the words fall by the wayside, would they?\n\nBut this series of new measures had destroyed that hope entirely. The Propaganda Commissars had spoken nearly uninterruptedly about the need to keep the People's Discipline, to move as one Unified Fighting Proletarian Force, and now they were bringing in the newfangled Culinary Optimisation to boot. The only thing the latter had optimised, Sergei thought bitterly, had been his unwillingness to spend more than was absolutely necessary on lunch-rations.\n\nWhatever this new Factory Control Measure was, he didn't like it either. Welding was a serious business - his friends could get hurt by the inhuman standards the Quotas were dictating. He made a mental note to speak to the Overseers the State had appointed; at least the one assigned to his Factory seemed friendly enough.\n\nAs the work-day dragged to its close, Sergei slipped off the assembly line on a 'smoke-break' to find the Overseer. Raising his concerns to the kindly-looking grey-haired man, he burbled his enthusiasm for the new regime and his hopes that the Factory would be restored to some sensible quotas.\n\nThe Overseer's response was a simple smile and the eight words:"

 komi_natsoc.10.d: "The factories' smoke rose to the horizon, stretching from end to end of the sky's endless bands. Their residents moved in and out of the zone with an increasingly frantic pace, driven by a rhythm like the beating of an agitated heart. The Socialist Nation was speeding towards an undefined conclusion, like the period at the end of a sentence. A singularity of workers and soldiers and mass-produced lead-shells. And so it went.\n\nThere was a lady who worked at a machine-shop, working miracles by the magic of her wizened hands. At first she, too, worked in line with the rhythms of the State, following the Quotas and writing careful reports at the end of each work week. At the end of her reports she would append little smiles and pressed flowers, to thank the General Secretary and his Party for their hard work.\n\nWhen her strength gave and the rhythms proved too pressing, she fell and did not get up. The next week her shop was confiscated by the State, to be sublet to someone more willing. And so it went.\n\nThere was a young boy, too, who worked as a shoemaker. Most days he spent dreaming of the building of his own outlet, where he could be free to read his carefully sequestered books on design and fashion. At night he would work on the designs those books had inspired, dreams in polyester and elastic banding and leather fashioned to fit the curves of the foot like an embracing lover.\n\nWhen his work was found out, his uncle took the fall. For his mercy, the boy was afforded leniency: he was tasked only with the destruction of his work. The flames were studded with the boy's tears as they fed on his life's hopes, like jewels.\n\nAnd so it went, and so it went, and so it went, the Republic endlessly marching to the future. Those who marched too slow or too strange - there was no place for them here."

Even so, he was not immune to panic or anxiety, and this massive crowd of people (even if they were unionists like him) was really not helping his stress levels. God, why had the GenSec picked his Union for administrative duties in the first place? Had he done anything to offend them? Well, it was immaterial. There was, after all, a job to be done. Sacha cleared his throat, tapped the mike and at once the room fell silent. "Wel-welcome, friends. We are gathered here today at the request of the Republic and the General Secretary-"\n\nA raucous voice called out from the front of the room. "Yeah, yeah, we get the message. What does Serov want from us again? Haven't we already promised the Quotas?" There was commotion, and a hint of mocking laughter.\n\nSacha gritted his teeth. "Yes, comrade, the General Secretary is fully aware of this - our efforts, I mean. But we must all work together now, for the resistance against the Degenerate Capitalists-"\n\nAgain a voice interrupted him, this time from the far end. "Ain't we already gotten rid of the Capitalists? I'd like to have a cuppa with the GenSec himself, seein' how he's wastin our time 'ere - maybe he'll sponsor me for the privilege!" This time the laughter came in bursts, and it was unrelenting.\n\n"Comrades!" Sacha snapped into the mike. "You are not listening to anything I have said. What I am saying is this: the GenSec wants us merged. Different professions, different industries, different companies - we are to be a single party now, and we must - must work in unison."\n\nThere was a moment of pregnant silence, and then everyone rose to speak at once."

The Five Year Plan would be revolutionary, and ensure that Serov's men were well-equipped and prepared for war.\n\nThe Five Year Plan was focused on heavy industry, and military production. Among the major goals of this economic plan were the creation of industry safely distanced from any possible combat fronts, funneling more and more resources into producing tanks and armaments, and raise the annual industrial growth to levels unheard of elsewhere in Russia. All of this military production would of course cause a heavy fall in consumer goods production, but true citizens of the Soviet Union will take this temporary sacrifice in stride, and any who don't can be... persuaded.\n\nHopefully, the Five Year Plan could turn this untrained society of peasants into a truly advanced industrial economy.

The old Soviet Union failed to defeat these powerful foes, but Serov was going to give Russia a second chance.\n\nIt was time for the Russian economy to mobilize, to prepare itself for war. A war against the insidious forces of capitalism and cosmopolitanism. Serov's new Soviet Union will not fall like the last one, it will stand strong in the face of adversity. While the economy mobilizes, the proletariat must prepare as well. They must harden themselves, answer the call of duty, and weather the inevitable sacrifices they will be forced to face.\n\nUnder Ordosocialism, Russia is strong. In this world, the strong are destined to survive, while the weak perish. Bukharin's Soviet Union was weak, having embraced cosmopolitanism and become allies to capitalism, it was inevitable that it would be destroyed. Serov's Soviet Union has been reforged, free of these impurities, and it was time to prove it to the world."

What better way to evolve the military's doctrine, then to learn from the past? Russia has seen lots of conflict in the last several decades, and the military's high command all have lived through these conflicts and seen what works, and what doesn't.\n\nEvery military prepares for the last war they fought, and Russia's military shall be no exception. Specific ideas of interest can be picked up from the Great Patriotic War, with the Blitzkrieg quickly leaving Europe's armies disorganized and unable to keep up. Innovations to how we use armor, how we use aircraft, and how we use infantry should all be implemented into our doctrine. Of course, the West Russian War and the various warlord conflicts throughout Russia have also given us many valuable lessons to learn from. Once we have implemented these changes, Russia's military shall be prepared to fight any kind of war it finds itself in."

 komi_natsoc.15.d: "Tukhachevsky may not be a loyal follower of Ordosocialism, but Serov still believes his ideas on warfare could be of use to his military. The man is called the Red Napoleon for a reason, after all. That is why Serov ordered his generals to read up on Tukhachevsky's military theory, and find a way to implement it into their own doctrine.\n\nTukhachevsky's writings on discipline within the army interested the General-Secretary greatly, as they easily fell in line with Ordosocialism's teachings. Tukhachevsky desired the entire chain of command to adhere to this spartan discipline, purging generals who failed to uphold their duty. Of course, Serov's generals were far more eager to discuss the actual tactics Tukhachevsky described. Offensive deep battle, defeating the enemy not only at the line of contact, but throughout the battlefield. Tukhachevsky also placed great emphasis upon operations as a third level of military thinking, and a crucial part of military theory.\n\nSerov's generals had a lot of work ahead of them. Integrating these new theories on armor, aviation, reconnaissance, airborne units, command and control, and even chemical warfare would take some time and a lot of organization. However, through this momentary pain, the new military doctrine will be strong enough to preserve Russia through any conflict."

Japan has begun a second age of colonialism, turning Asia into glorified resource deposits for their own gain. America claims to be the last bastion of freedom in the dark, cruel world, but they too serve the forces of capitalism and cosmopolitanism. They only aid regimes who serve their interests, abandoning any who wish to forge their own path to the wolves. There is no hope for freedom to be found amongst these nations, no friends to those who wish to liberate their peoples from their enslavement.\n\nThat changes today. The Soviet Union extends her hand to all the liberation movements across the world, and shall lead them into the light. Russia, too, has seen her people oppressed, her people enslaved, her people slaughtered. Russia has suffered a great deal of pain and bloodshed, but Russia shall rise from the ashes. We shall liberate our people, free them from their shackles, so that we may be the example that other nations aspire to become.\n\nTo any who desire to see their people freed, place your trust in us, in Russia, to support your dream! No more shall the three empires lead this world! The people shall be free, free from capitalism, free from cosmopolitanism, free from oppression!

The trucks cantered around the hotel, circling the wagons. From the trucks emerged the soldiers of Serov: thugs and brutes, agents of Ordosocialism. They slammed shut their truck doors, the muck and sludge splashing onto their leather trench coats. They whipped out of their pistols, prepared to bring flashes of light to the dawn. Stomping into the hotel, they shuffled towards the contact, the German agent who would act as a middleman between their two polities, if only in an unofficial capacity.\n\nThe agents of Serov flooded the hotel, pushing over tables in search of hidden weaponry and cracking open the windows in case of an ambush. The head of Serov's agents, Yegor, took a seat with the German contact, cracking his knuckles and laying a pistol at the center of the table. He motioned to another agent, who brought forward a shot glass and a bottle of Koskenkorva Viina. Yegor looked insulted for a moment, before throwing the shot glass to the side and cracking open the Kossu. He chugged down the vodka, enough to refresh his throat, so, half the bottle.\n\n"These Finnish bastards get all the good alcohol. The war, the death, it could all be tolerated. But the lack of good drink? That is the greatest burden our people bear... Now, onto our" he chuckled to himself "negotiations." Yegor began to pat the rickety, wooden table upon which they sat. "We understand you can't yet begin any formal actions with our nation, so let Finland be our backdoor, for hands to be shaken and commerce to flow. We have depots in Lappeenranta, Uusimaa, and Vantaa. Now... what do you say, Hun?"\n\nThe German contact stared at his surroundings. The agents began to unfurl their knives and brass knuckles. Yegor's hand crawled forward, until his fingers touched the grip of his pistol. "A deal, it is" the Hun spat, "I will... get some workers to form a few connections at your depots.

Yegor, the head of the agents, stands on his seat with bloodshot eyes. He wields a needle, containing a mixture of morphine, heroin, and liquefied pervitin. Yegor raises his arm, clenches his fist, and jams the needle into an exposed vein. Yegor doubles over, the rush of pain and euphoria washing over his body at once. The agents laugh and whistle, slapping tables and smashing bottles of alcohol. The walls are washed in grime and soot, and homeless addicts litter the corners of the den. A neon haze emanates from the deadlights above. Yegor rests himself on his seat, clenching... something. The walls wash away, and the faces of the agents look to be photos of the purged and maimed. Yegor leans back, the drugs taking a toll on his cognition.\n\nA strange sight appears. A lanky, pale figure in business attire appears to sit in front of him. Yegor looks to his comrades, confused at what this vision could mean. Recalling his mission, he remembers that he was to meet a contact... of some sort. Unable to speak, Yegor stares forward at the blurry visage which may or may not be the contact. The figure unfurls a black, long, thing. Wielding the brain activity he still possesses, Yegor recognizes it as a weapon. This was... a weapons smuggler, yes. The agents move ever closer, forming a circle around Yegor and the figure. Yegor glances to and fro, beads of sweat rolling off his face.\n\nThis was... this was... a Dutch! It was some sort of deal about the black market and the trafficking of agents worldwide. The details had long been lost to Yegor's mind. After eternity, or perhaps a few seconds, the figure stood tall, reaching out his... hand, maybe? Yegor pulsed his muscles. Through great effort, similar to the launch of a rocket, Yegor built up pressure and flung his hand towards the shape. Soon after, the figure was gone."

Necessary to this growth is the subversion of our morals, if only for small amounts of time, so that we may guarantee the survival of Ordosocialism. Germany tolerated the existence of the Soviet Union throughout the beginning of World War 2, so that it could consolidate its gains and expand its realm, and with that strategy Germany has emerged as the master of Europe. We will not ignore history, even if it means dealing with those we hate. We are more intelligent than them, and we know this arrangement will not last. The extermination of the bourgeoisie will take more than gunshots and rage.\n\nIt has taken months, but we have done it. Wearing the faces of bourgeois pigs, those reactionaries and parasites in the Swiss Bank have relented to our influence. Soldiers of Serov and agents of Ordosocialism wandered in, dripping in blood, gunshots behind them, and the bankers accepted us because those exploitative fiends will take any chance they can to squeeze a profit from suffering. We used many methods, from interjecting ourselves into loans and transactions, to offering our dissidents and traitors up as cheap labor for markets abroad. By becoming ever more involved in Swiss financial institutions, we have secured a place for us in the international marketplace, be it small.\n\nAs our nation expands, our ideology takes root in the populace and our economic bubble grows larger, we necessitate connections in Europe. From a hook in Europe's marketplace, our influence will expand into a wedge and, eventually, we will become a player akin to Romania or Turkey.

A chain of wires, hanging between two radio towers, upon which five mutilated and maimed corpses hung.\n\n"Before all of you, our most fearsome and raucous servants of Russia, hangs the ideological manifesto of Ordosocialism.

Anarchists, sewers of chaos. The second corpse belongs to nationalists, who do not recognize the supremacy of socialism. Reactionaries, and tyrants. The third corpse is for those who follow in the footsteps of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, but do not love Russia, or its people. Revisionists, and corruptors of socialism. The fourth corpse is those most tragic of deaths. Followers of socialist thought and nationalists, who have, nevertheless, rebelled against our righteous authority. They are contrarians, who seek to destroy instead of reform. The fifth corpse is for a hidden threat, those who claim to follow our ideals in full, but lie. Their parents, and the parents of their parents, have imparted upon them reactionary ideals, which goes on to taint them throughout their lives. But, they are sly, these bourgeois parasites will do whatever it takes to remain alive until the dawning of our Russia, so that they may leech off of the state. We must strangle this threat in its cradle.

He gathered his notes, dense with self-references and diagrams, but at the same time marvelous in their simplicity: where Lenin and Bukharin had built an imperfect mirror, he was constructing a crystal chandelier.

 komi_natsoc.26.d: "Puchkov stared at the giant, beaming face of the Commissar-Marshall, hovering on the banner like an incantation for some arcane spell. Colored in flashes of red and gold, the face was flanked by the words, FOLLOW THE PATH OF THE STATE IN ALL DIRECTIONS! Two assault rifles hung helpfully by the sides of the emblem, in case the message wasn't clear enough. The General Secretary's name was written below, in slightly smaller subtext.\n\nAt least this one had artistic sensibility: Puchkov had seen a half-dozen artistic slaughterings of the GenSec's name by fools trying to outdo each other in flattery. This one was merely passable. It wouldn't pass through even a routine inspection under the old regime, but truth be told, the Propaganda Department of the Media Ministry was not in the best of shape. They simply didn't have the time or energy for anything different.\n\nSipping at his tea-flask, he began the work of fusing all the contradictory streams of propaganda into a single stream of thought. GenSec Serov had asked for a specifically short address, one with few words but ones of substance. Eminently suitable to a corporate board meeting, perhaps, but as an exhortation, it was a crippling limitation. Even so, Puchkov wasn't paid to take ownership of expensive failures. If there was a speech he could render from this mess, he damn well would.\n\nHe worked through the night, his paper a canvas upon which the broad brushstrokes arose of a speech. References to the power of the people here, a sideways glance to the workers as it was made, and then a cinematic turn - one in scope and physical angle - to the children. An exhortation to follow the Directives for Home Defense and voluntarily surrender excess rations, followed by a heroic comparison to the Revolution.\n\nYes, it was all coming together - and if this Propaganda Campaign was successful, perhaps the Red Army would even grant a commission bonus."

Initial incidents where soldiers tried to disobey orders, defending targets from State intervention or even outright assaulting superiors, have been reduced by almost 70 percent from the previous quarter: we can attribute this to intensified internal re-education and liquidation campaigns, as well as to a general trend I refer to here as "desensitization". I will explain below.\n\nThe onerous requirements of a revolution are borne with increasing ease as the soldier becomes used to the solemnity of his work - he begins to see the national citizen in their proper place, as tools to be used and destroyed for our greater glory. I believe this trend accounts for accelerating individual compliance with personal corrective orders as well - we have received increasing numbers of domestic surveillance reports (attached in addendum 4.ii.a are a sample of these reports).\n\nExtraction operations continue as is usual, with the intended effects. Nothing need be said about them that has not already been said, nor does their continuation raise alarms in the public: in fact, I have not heard a single citizen talk of these events. We can surmise that the work of indoctrination is going so well that the need for discourse on this initially controversial policy measure can now be eliminated altogether.\n\nEven so, we have received reports that the disposal methods could stand to be improved.

It was like a train set whose model-sets reached from one end of the Republic to the other, and Serov was intent on watching the little wheels roll and roll.\n\nSome of Serov's advisors compared him in his weaker moments to a young boy in a candy-shop - right now, disguised and in the middle of Sykvytkar, Serov could not have agreed more.\n\nSquads of heavy-set guards chanted songs as they paced the streets, as women and children gathered in a market-square. Serov noted their near-identical clothing with great approval. The Proletarian Clothing Programme had been a greater success than he'd anticipated. Banners, of course, were everywhere, and his eyes danced as he watched them fly above the people. As the sun's rays cast long shadows over the scene, the street seemed almost to emanate life in its wake. A glorious pastiche, and one untainted by Capitalist degeneracy - Serov felt an almost religious joy welling from his heart.\n\nBehind him, shouts - Serov turned just in time to witness a young man being accosted by a Red Army Youth Corps group. Jeers of "Rootless Cosmopolitan!" echoed from the sidewalks. As he watched, the mockery turned to kicks, and the cosmopolitan was dragged into an alleyway.\n\nSighing, he turned back from the screams and quick-paced his steps to the Government quarters. It was a shame that such parasites lurked still in the body politic - and a warning to his complacency. There were always more enemies in the Republic, and he couldn't let the Workers down by discovering them too late. At least the Youth Corpsman had done his duty..."

 komi_natsoc.29.t: "Hammer, Sickle, Wheat, Chaff"

Was there something he'd failed to consider, some untouched piece of demographic theory that had eluded him? His volume of materialist analysis had brought together some of the most complete socialist research-studies of the Nation ever compiled, and yet... something was missing.\n\nHis estimates of industrial progress for Russia were a key part of his unpublished Ordosocialist thesis, but compiling a working theory for Soviet industry was proving... difficult. There was something almost malevolent to the way the kolkhoz system had plunged in the 30s and 40s. Almost like an external force gently shoving its boot into the soil, leaching it of nutrients and vitality. A cancer grafted into the Russian workers.\n\nBut who could it be? And for what purpose?\n\nMusing, his eyes wandered to the dustiest corner of his history book collection. A HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN FAR EAST, 1895 TO 1940. He'd scoured the demographic history of the Union in virtually every other area - perhaps the land beyond the Amur would provide some insight? He took its hefty weight, checked the spine for defects, and began to read.\n\nEvening turned to dawn. Serov put his book down, his eyes wide and unblinking. He'd uncovered a conspiracy vast in scale - a conspiracy to infiltrate the corners of the Union with rootless people - and it went all the way to the top. Yes, he had the answer for his agricultural-industrial malaise. It had been staring him in the face this whole time. Now it was time to warn the rest of Russia's Workers and to pray that he had not been too late.\n\nThe very next week, posters bearing Asiatic figures appeared on every city of every district in the Republic: BE ON GUARD FOR "KOREAN" PARASITES, WORKERS!

 KOM_gumilyov_regional.1.d: "Lev Gumilyov pondered the great Eurasians that had come before him: Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Yekaterina. They had many things in common, but the most important was their understanding of power. They demanded complete obedience in their subjects and didn't suffer anyone to question their rule. That was the only way to harness the indomitable spirit of the Eurasian nation, and if he was ever to pick up the mantle of those great rulers, he had to demand the same.\n\nThat was, of course, the purpose of the reorganization of the administration. The Passionariyy had done a commendable job getting him this far, but it was time to relieve them of their administrative burden. A loyal bureaucracy would enforce his will over the provinces, and leave the Passionariyy free to continue their most important work: To educate the Eurasian people on their past and to erase the legacy of petty regionalisms and tribal nations."

Only the most extraordinary of wills could tame and harness the indomitable spirit of great Eurasia. Lev Gumilyov possessed such a will. The implementation of a new economic plan would take him one step closer to his goal. All sectors of the economy had to be organized to take direction from the state. It was a necessary prerequisite to achieve the twin goals of economic modernization and popular mobilization.\n\nDramatically increasing state interference would make him few friends in the higher classes, of course. He had long since been resigned to that fact and his willingness to pay the price of their scorn was set long ago. He would have to deal decisively with the upper crust sooner or later anyway. Far too often, the poison of disunity could be traced back to some plutocrat seeking to profit from chaos. If he allowed industries to operate outside state control, perfidious owners would undermine Eurasia to seek those profits, for themselves or in service to tribalist traitors."

The integration of Captain Akhmetov's cavalry was proving a difficult task, mostly due to the man's complete lack of experience with protocol and poor grasp of the Russian language. Still, the higher-ups were adamant on the value of mounted soldiers and insisted the new company's "steppe instincts" would yield valuable insights once attuned to the realities of modern combat. Andreyev was not convinced.\n\n"Colonel Andrev?"\n\n"What is it this time, Captain?"\n\n"We should go home. It will rain soon and the ground here, it will be very bad for your cars. Soft. Too soft"\n\nSomething about the sincerity of the man compelled the Colonel to consider his advice. The exercise was, after all, on the Tatars' home turf, not his. And he was glad he did. No sooner had he moved his men than the sky parted, as torrential rain poured down over the exercise field. As the rest of the company tried desperately to keep dry in their defensive positions, Akhmetov had his riders keep scouting their enemies, trusting his men to find good footing in between the muddy fields. In the days after, when the rains had ended, Andreyev had every advantage he needed to emerge from the exercise as the clear victor."

He claims that the Turkish and Russian peoples are of the same blood, the same family, and that family should work together. Gumilyov's government is apparently somewhat obsessed with the idea of 'Eurasia', and part of that means that Gumilyov wishes to see Russia becoming more ingrained into Asian politics, rather than European ones.\n\nThe diplomats claim that their government just wishes to see our governments merely enter an open and friendly relationship, and claims they hold no ulterior motives with the request. However, the devil Bukharin claimed the same thing when they imposed their atheist regime on our people. Central Asia has been shackled to Russia for far too long.\n\nSome of the members of our government say that we should consider the offer, and that having a friendly, but distinctly independent, relationship with Russia could prevent Central Asia from being enslaved once more.

 KOM_gumilyov_regional.21.d: ""Class, it has come to my attention that many of you are not treating others the way you should. As you know, Eurasia is a very diverse nation. We use this diversity for our strength, it is not a weakness. Many of you refuse to see others as the same, and this cannot stand. Cooperation is of utmost importance. If you are Russian, don't just help your Russian neighbor. Help your Tatar neighbor, or your Muslim neighbor. We are all Eurasians. From now on, I want you to treat your peers as you would want yourself treated. That means you too, Alex."\n\n"But he pushed me first!"\n\n"Yes, and instead of punching him in the jaw you should have come to me so I could have sorted it out." The teacher answered. It seemed as if the kids were not really getting the point, perhaps she needed another approach. "Now, maybe you don't think this is all necessary. You may be asking, why do I have to be nice to the kid that doesn't look like me, or the weird kid across the street that I don't understand. You see, there is a point to all this."\n\n"And what is that?" Said one of the young girls sitting in the front.\n\nThe teacher's tone changed. "You're not just working together to be nice or to be friendly. Your survival and the survival of the entirety of Eurasia depends on you. The evil, barbaric Romano-Germanics wait along or borders, searching for weakness. You see, if we do not work together, they will come here to destroy us. They will kill your parents. They will kill you. They will destroy all that you love. "The children stared wide-eyed at the teacher, one now looked like he was close to crying. The teacher spoke again, more calmly and amiably this time. "But you do not have to be afraid if you work together. The one weakness our enemies have is that they are divided. The Romano-Germanics enslave those who they think are lesser than them, the same as the Asiatic civilizations. The Atlanticists are in eternal competition, each wanting to be better than the other. Only Eurasians understand true cooperation. So go home, and when you come back tomorrow, make sure you help your classmates. You are dismissed.""

Said Gumilyov joyfully.\n\n"Greetings, Lev. Now, I know you want to get straight down to business, as do I. The situation with the economy is very urgent, after all. I had a few ideas of how we could fix the utter mess that we are in."\n\n"In fact, I had a few ideas as well, Vadim. I want it very well rounded. A new take on a command economy, perhaps." Gumilyov replied.\n\n"Yes, as I told you before, a command economy is the best for our situation currently. We must take as much action as possible if we want it to grow." Vadim paused for a moment to think. "It may be a good idea to take full control of the resources. Many private companies are not working at full efficiency nor capacity. We could probably organize better than they could."\n\n"A great idea, Vadim!" Gumilyov smiled. West Russia was all his, and there were so many opportunities! "We'll also have to make sure we control the factories. Too many are low on workers, or their owners just don't manage them well enough. Meanwhile, small businesses offer little support to our economy. Nationalizing them I feel could be very beneficial, don't you think?"\n\n"Well..." Vadim looked down at his papers, then back up at Lev. "We'll see if that's necessary, Lev." Another pause and Lev Gumilyov's smile falters. "You know what, I'll put it on the plan and talk it over will some of the others. It's a good idea, for sure, some of them might not see it that way though..."\n\n"Do what it takes to make sure it happens Vadim, and of course, it's a great idea.

As Ivan hastily exited his car, he immediately noticed a trio of soldiers coming towards him. The rifles slung over their shoulders and their steely expressions did not imply their intentions were benevolent.\n\n"You! Are you the one in charge here?" the soldier in front, clearly an officer, called out as his squad drew closer.\n\n"Yes, I am, and I demand to know what's going on!" Even as the soldiers began to surround him, Ivan's confused anger entailed a certain degree of recklessness.\n\n"This factory has been repurposed in the name of the Eurasian State, as ordered by our leader. I'm afraid the days of unpatriotic nomad merchants like yourself getting fat off the riches of the Eurasian people are over."\n\n"'Nomad merchants?' Just what the hell are you implying?! My family's owned this factory for generations you fucking-" Ivan's protests were brought to an abrupt conclusion when a rifle butt struck him in the face, sending him tumbling to the ground.\n\n"Dumb fucking Jew," the officer snarled, "put him in cuffs and throw him in the truck.""

Citywide protests have extended into the countryside, where eligible adults for the draft are blocking streets, fighting civilian police, and causing property damage. Cries of "I will not die for Eurasia!" and "No power for the Passionary!" are being shouted in unison against the rising smoke and ever encroaching sound of military trucks.\n\nWith a screeching halt, elite divisions of the military have been deployed to protest sites, along with remnants of the local police garrison. The crack of rifled gunpowder, PPSh fire, and the whipping of police batons would end these protests in a matter of minutes. Amid a few screams and more scuffles, the majority of protesters were detained and now at the mercy of the military. An officer stepped out from a military truck with a loudspeaker, and walked to face the crowd...\n\n"Attention! By engaging in today's gross protest against the State of Eurasia, every perpetrator has officially been charged with high treason by the orders of the Guide of the Passionarist Revolution, Lev Gumilyov! However, he is willing to give mercy to those who will work for the advancement of the State in her factories! If you do not want to be tried against a court, walk forward!"\n\nWith a few worried whispers, an old man was the first to rise, and began to walk toward the officer. A few moments later, most others in the crowd would walk toward the officer and several soldiers. Whatever awaited the rest was certainly a worse fate than factory duty."

 KOM_gumilyov_regional.26.d: "Clovis Ivanov stood behind the counter, watching those walking by and making sure no thieves snuck out his doors. His grocery business was starting to see real success, and he was even thinking of opening a second store. He had really built himself up, and that was something, as most stores in shattered Russia did not do well.\n\n"Mr. Ivanov, I found a letter next to your table, do you want to look at it?" His clerk, Prav, asked.\n\n"Ah yes, that, something from the government I believe." Replied Clovis. "You can just leave it here."\n\nRipping the letter open, Clovis didn't know what to expect. Had he forgotten to pay part of his taxes? Perhaps a missed inspection? But as he began to read, it was much, much worse than any of that: Dear Mr. Ivanov and to who it may apply... we are to inform you that your business is being nationalized... please hand over the keys and required documents to the official who will be coming next Monday... if you wish to remain in the business you must apply to become a member of the Passionariyy and transfer your position to manager... we thank you for your cooperation.\n\nHis shop, nationalized! That couldn't be right! He just owned a little grocer, not a corporation. Perhaps it was just an error?\n\nBut as it turned out when he read the morning paper and talked to the other shop owners on the street, it was not. His shop was now owned by the government. And he was now just the manager."

 KOM_gumilyov_regional.27.d: "It was another long, dreary day for Clovis Ivanov. Barely any customers had visited his store that day, and even less had made a purchase. His new co-manager, Lavr, barely cared for the job at all. It seemed all he did was report what Clovis did to his own higher-ups! And just to think, a few months earlier he was thinking of expanding HIS business. Now the government was driving it to the ground.\n\nNot like Lavr or any of the other "business experts" cared. They just reported good numbers and that was that. It is what you get when you make a bunch of bureaucrats running a business, after all. Clovis knew there was nothing he could do about it. It's not like he could leave, and even if he could, Clovis knew he could never live to see his business that he built from the ground up destroyed by Lavr and his lackeys.\n\nHe even missed back when the democratic socialists were in charge! At least they didn't butt their heads into his business as much. And they didn't fire Prav!\n\nHe looked down at the sales for the day again. Even less than last week, and an order form that Lavr was supposed to do didn't get filled out. Great. He filed the order and gave the sales report to Lavr to "check over for mistakes" and nabbed a loaf of bread for his family before walking out the door."

 KOM_gumilyov_regional.28.d: "Although Perm had been freed from the control of the hated Aryan Brotherhood, the scars of its long occupation remained. Much of the city was still badly damaged, and economic activity was low.\n\nWhich, correspondingly, meant that many of the Brotherhood's former slaves, now officially citizens, had little opportunity to improve either their own situation or that of their family's. For those who still had them. As such, it was identified as an excellent target for the first wave of the state's National Food Bank program, showcasing the benefits of Eurasian ideology and its collective principles.\n\nThe trucks arrived early in the morning, initially escorted by soldiers, and proceeded to an abandoned storefront in the city's central district. Long years spent under the Brotherhood had encouraged a wariness of military convoys, and at first few approached to inquire as to the formation's purpose. Once encouraged to approach however, and once the workers explained their purpose, news spread quickly.\n\nBefore long, thousands of citizens, for whom minimal food had once only been given in response to hard work, had arrived. Although the food itself was basic, consisting of only grains and vegetables, it was filling, nutritious, and, most importantly, free of charge or exchange.\n\nBy the end of the day, the many hungry and unemployed had been fed and, more importantly, were extolling the many positive virtues of the Passionarist Revolution and its, their, Guide. Both were very pleasing outcomes."

Inside was essentially a cease-and-desist order. Effectively immediately, Anton's oil fields and refinery would be nationalized under the State of Eurasia, and all workers would be under the jurisdiction of the government. He was effectively out of a job, out of income, and no longer had any net worth. What would he tell his wife? That her and the kids would become nothing more than Passionary bootlickers? That he let our livelihood go without a fight? Enraged, he almost tore the telegram, but instead slammed his desk in an impotent rage, throwing the telegram across the office.\n\n"Goddamn cocksucking nationalists! I kept my mouth shut when they invaded, I kept my mouth shut when they asked for oil to fuel their tanks and trucks, and I kept my mouth shut when they offered me party membership!" Anton was about to cry, perhaps for the first time in a long time. He did not cry as a young boy when his father was killed in the Great Patriotic War, he did not cry when his best friend left home to head to the Aryan Brotherhood, and he did not cry when his third child died suddenly in their crib. But now, it seemed there was no other choice.\n\nUntil he saw another attachment to his telegram.\n\nA cheque, one for double what he was making, and another offer. One for a job. Unable to believe what was being offered to him, Anton quickly dialed the Office of Resource Management, and waited patiently for a secretary to pick up.

Should be simple enough, any questions?"\n\nA resounding "No, sir!" came from the Komi scouts and the infantry, who were largely Russian. The Tatar riders, on the other hand, remained conspicuously silent. "Hey, cavalry! Do you have any questions before we proceed?"\n\nThe riders remained silent for a time, until one of them sheepishly stepped forward. "Sir... you wish us to rush forward and attack?" His Russian was broken and heavily accented.\n\n"No, no, I want you to attack when we pull back!"\n\nThe rider smiled. "Ahh! We run back and then attack!"\n\nBringing a hand to his mouth, the captain realized what was going on. "Do... do any of you actually speak Russian?"\n\n"Russians? Yes!" the rider exclaimed, turning to give one of the Russian infantrymen a salute. And thus, the captain's suspicions were confirmed.

 KOM_gumilyov_regional.33.d: "Of late, Lev Gumilyov's thoughts had turned, increasingly, towards the Atlanticists. In particular, towards the United States. Try as he might, he simply could not understand how they endured.\n\nLike Eurasia, it was an enormous country populated by many different social, political, and religious groups. The method by which they had arrived there was, of course, very different, but the end result was the same. And, also like Eurasia, they had been challenged, within and without, and been found wanting in both cases.\n\nBut very much unlike Eurasia, they seemed able to, somehow, always resist internal disintegration. Seemed always able to, in the end, identify themselves and others as Americans, no matter their background. Seemed always able to recover, return stronger than before, and internalize a grim determination to continue their fight.\n\nHe contemplated this while looking at an enormous map of the confusing nation. It was truly maddening. Everything he wanted for Eurasia and its peoples, that strength of purpose, that unity in the face of repeated defeats, that defense against disintegration, the Americans already possessed. He had read numerous chronicles of American history in an effort to discover whatever special steps had been taken, and found nothing.\n\nGumilyov knew well that the Revolution could, would, falter if such a spirit could not be encouraged, but he could not answer the question of how to do so. And so he found himself staring for hours at the map asking, over and over, how they had done it.\n\nHe could find no answer."

He had known, immediately, that he would not be content with a life of farming, and though it had taken both years and many sacrifices, he had indeed reached his goal, joining that same air force.\n\nAnd he had learned, very quickly, that the purported equality of all the Soviet peoples had been a lie. Thrown into an under-equipped and under-prepared squadron, they had been savaged by the Germans during their invasion, and during the collapse that followed, the pilot had returned to his farm, resigning himself to a quiet life.\n\nBut the Passionarist Revolution had changed all of that. He was a Kazakh, yes, but more than that he was a Eurasian, and that distinction mattered. The equality that had once been denied was now freely given, and he again was given the opportunity to fly.\n\nEagerly accepting, he had found himself in short order taking to the skies above Kazakhstan, above Eurasia, and he knew that he would never allow that land to be threatened. By outsiders or by those who did not accept the equality that was now shared. The skies of Eurasia would be open to all its peoples.\n\nFor all time."

 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.1.d: "The rough looking man braced himself as he watched a wind pick up over the snowy wastes of the north. As the breeze passed him over, Igor decided that he would take one last puff of his cigarette before heading back into the mine. He and his men had been assured by the government's bureaucracy that a resource extraction operation on this site would yield great rewards in gold, yet they hadn't seen more than an ounce of it in three weeks of mining.\n\nThis was meant to be his last venture with the company. All they needed to do was find a big enough vein to cover the company's costs and his debts, and he would be content to retire. He sighed, dropped his cigarette to the ground and crushed it. At this rate, he'd have to wait another decade before he could retire.\n\nNot if I die in there, he thought darkly to himself. Mournfully, Igor grabbed his pick and started back into the cave when one of his men, a younger man in his 20s, slammed into Igor, nearly knocking the both of them to the ground. Before Igor could even speak, the man clapped both hands on him and said,\n\n"Sir, we've done it! You have to come see!"\n\nEyes widened, Igor sprinted back into the cave with the man, plunging back into the sprawling depths below."

 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.2.d: "Gumilyov sat, deep in thought, before his hearth. This was fine firewood, he thought; dense and heavy, well-seasoned and radiating heat that pushed the frigid cold of midnight from his living room. Taking a drag on his cigarette, he idly swirled the vodka in its glass, staring into the flames.\n\nThe flames of Eurasia's passionarity were blazing with a fury unsurpassed in the history of the superethnos, but there were more concerns than just conquest. Without proper guidance, the flames would burn out of control and become a wildfire, consuming the very nation he had worked so hard to establish. He had to retain power if he was to guide Eurasia along the correct path and restrain its self-destructive urges. But the Russians...\n\nGumilyov scowled. The Russians - or rather, the Russian nationalists - didn't understand that. It was a funny idea of Eurasia they had: Russia, but with a different name and different excuses for oppressing its brother ethnoses. He had already been forced to make too many concessions to them, and their influence was steadily growing. He hadn't done all this just to see the Eurasian project succumb to the same chauvinism that fostered hatred between the ethnoses.\n\nDowning the vodka and flicking his cigarette into the fire, Gumilyov stood and headed over to his bookshelf to find something to calm his nerves. Maybe the Secret History. Genghis Khan's life was a great inspiration, after all. Someday, he would see the legendary ruler's vision fulfilled - hopefully with a little less bloodshed."

Perhaps there was hope for Eurasia after all.\n\n"My friends... my family," he began, "People of Eurasia, welcome. Today is the most auspicious day in our shared history. This is the first time that true Eurasianism has come to the very doorstep of Central Asia. Not since Genghis Khan has our superethnos been so close to total unification."\n\nHe paused for a moment, the audience rapt. What tack to take? "I... envisioned this, years ago. Our people, so long disunited, finally recognizing what binds us together. Too long have we fought over disputed borders, over faith, over petty rivalries. We alone, of all the world's civilizations, have never been able to set aside our differences and unite against those who profit from our continued division. The Atlanticists, the Romano-Germanics, the Asiatics - they have always feared and despised us, our state of barbarism serving as fuel for their propaganda machines! They regard us as mere savages, incapable of greatness, of glory, of matching their achievements! Well, I say: no more! Let us stand shoulder to shoulder, my brothers. We are closer than ever to the birth of history's greatest empire. Let it become so, I say!

Farmers by trade for hundreds of years, through tsar, through revolution, and now through anarchy, the tillers of civilization were not helped at all by the socialists in the Front. Fate would benefit them however, when two government officials visited their farm one afternoon.\n\n"Good evening, Sokolov family. We are officials from the State, and we are here to inform you about the Eurasian Agricultural Initiative. Since local records indicate that your family are farmers as well as upstanding, we thought that this information would be very important to you."\n\nThe eldest of the family, Yury, would step forward, and listen with great yet careful intent. "What is so special about this initiative?" Yury glanced back toward his family, afraid that any counter-productive action would result in retaliation.\n\n"I'm glad you asked." One of the officers handed Yury a pamphlet, one which extolled the virtues of the farmer toward the State of Eurasia. The State was willing to pay for new property, subsidies toward equipment and seeds, as well as offering a stable buyer with a fair price. Everything they were denied under the WRRF, they were being offered under the Passionariyy. "Of course, you would have to move," replied the officer, "but if you are interested, visit the local Administrative Office and we will provide for our nation's finest."\n\nAs the officers walked away, Yury's eyes widened and his mind went wild as he browsed the pamphlet. While he cared little for politics, he would not mind playing them if it was for the success of his farm and the health of his family."

 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.8.t: "Eurasian Gold"
 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.8.d: "Lev Gumilyov was many things. A visionary. A leader. A Guide. He was not, however, an economist. But he did not need to be to understand the value and purpose of gold.\n\nThe directive to search the stockpiles and hidden caches of their former enemies had borne fruit. Large quantities of precious metals had been found, including the ingot that had been placed on his desk, stamped with the mark of a nation that no longer existed. He was informed that many, many more like it had been found alongside.\n\nA full inventory had been compiled, tests had confirmed their purity, a calculation of value had been performed, and transport to secure sites had been completed. The only question that remained was what to do with it all, and to Gumilyov this question was barely worth being identified as such.\n\nIt was a Eurasian metal, captured in Eurasia, and so it would be applied towards the betterment of Eurasians as a whole. There were many things the country needed, things that needed to be purchased from abroad. To do required hard currency, and there was little more suitable than that which sat in front of him.\n\nTogether the resources of Eurasia, people, metal, and otherwise, would act in unison to strengthen the nation, improve the lives of those within it, and complete the worthy and essential objectives of the Passionarist Revolution.\n\nAny other outcome was unacceptable."

 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.9.d: "The Samara Industrial Institute was abuzz. While no longer serving a purpose as a university for tonight, it was instead the site of a grand celebration to honor Gumilyov and the Passionariyy, one where representatives from the party, Constituent Ethnostates, military staff, and high-society types toast to the success of Eurasia and the flourishing of united culture in Russia.\n\nShouts of "Gumilyov will save Russia!" and "The Guide of our Revolution will ensure an Eurasian golden age!" filled his heart with joy. These were people who, years ago, would never have even considered the idea of a singular, strong, united state able to liberate Russia from strife. Today, everyone was standing together under the Eurasian banner, and under the guidance of Gumilyov. A smile escaped his usually serious, stern face. These were his people; this was Eurasia. As he took to the podium, a round of cheering broke through the halls, and then a respectful silence to carefully listen.\n\n"Ladies and Gentlemen of Eurasia, I stand here today for all of you. No longer will we live with memories of the West Russian War, no longer will we stand separated from our grand ambitions and goals. Today, everyone here has done their part to ensure the success of our State, and that in itself has done more for me as well as the peoples of Eurasia more than you could ever realize.""

 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.10.t: "Russian Whispers"
 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.10.d: "Members of the Passionariyy sat mostly silent after the convening of a large advisory council to tackle the problems of the Eurasian State, each from different oblasts and ethnic groups. While plenty of members left, and others were about to, a decently sized group of Russians sat together, hands folded, brooding in deep thought after Gumilyov's concluding speech. They spoke solemnly, and very far apart, as if not to attract any undue attention.\n\n"You could tell that he still favors us. Gumilyov isn't stupid." Some nods. General approval.\n\n"The Passionariyy Revolution was a Russian idea, and will always have to remain Russocentric. There is no future for this State without us, and he certainly understands." Everyone nodded. Several members leaned in closer to the next speaker.\n\n"We did not lose to the Germans twice to share the same spaces with Tatars and Mari. They have their own lands, but those lands were tilled by the Russian, for Russia." The group was getting slightly riled up, now that the assembly has cleared. These whispers, much like the ones in the early days of the former Komi Republic, voiced greater, secret, and potentially dangerous ideas. Ideas which would potentially spread. In the case of the Passionariyy, they were the correct ideas.\n\nThis time around, it seems that not everyone will hold hands together in the supposed Eurasian utopia."

Through your inherent fortitude you have weathered the storm and survived the genocidal onslaught against all odds. Their scheme to replace you as masters of the steppes has failed, and now it is time to go on the attack!\n\nIndeed, you can rest assured that the great civilization of Eurasia hears your plight, and stands with you! Soon, our vast armies shall wash over the cruelly imposed borders of the Teutonic colony states and liberate our oppressed kin. When that time comes, the Caucasus will be able breathe an air untainted by Germanic filth for the first time in decades.\n\nTo the brave Georgians of the mountains, and the defiant warrior peoples of Dagestan and Chechnya! Rest assured that the hour of your liberation lies just over the horizon! Prepare for our arrival, for when the time comes, all of our ethnic brothers and sisters will be required in the titanic struggle against the Romano-Germanic scum!\n\nTogether, we will set ablaze every last vestige of Teutonic influence that dares to blight our sacred motherland with its corrupting influence.

 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.12.t: "Legend's End"
 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.12.d: "Living as he did on the border with Kazakhstan, the farmer had, for many years, been prejudiced against those from Central Asia. And, yet, if he had been asked, he could not truly have explained exactly why. Which was why the pamphlet that he had been handed in town, earlier that day, spoke to him so strongly.\n\nThe animosity between Russian and Central Asian was foolish, it said, a product of the efforts of the many enemies of the Eurasian state. The past where they had once fought was long ago, and were themselves merely an artefact of the need to consolidate ethnic power in response to destructive European influences.\n\nDestructive influences that now came not only from Europe but from further abroad as well. As such, the pamphlet had said the peoples of Eurasia had to move past old animosities, old legends of behavior that had not existed for generations, and old resistances to integration. They had to move forward together, and seize their deserved destiny from those who wanted nothing more than to deny it to them.\n\nIt took the farmer many hours to process what the pamphlet had said. Prejudices long held, even absurd ones, ran deep, and took time to overcome. When he locked up his house and began travelling to town once again in order to find more literature he knew he was not yet finished in doing so, but he similarly knew he would continue to work at it.\n\nHe just needed more guidance, and more time besides."

 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.13.t: "Arms, Given with Purpose"
 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.13.d: "It was just after midnight when the Chechens, secluded in a small cove on the edge of the Caspian Sea, saw the boat approaching.\n\nThe journey to the coast, being some distance from Chechnya itself, had been both long and dangerous. The Reichskommissariat's administration had spies everywhere, both German as well as their many local collaborators, and the men knew that to be caught was, invariably, a death sentence.\n\nStill, however, they fought. For their homeland, their people, and their religion, they fought with every tool and tactic available to them, no matter the consequences. And if all went well, the boat approaching them was to bring both new tools as well as the promises of more to follow.\n\nAs the boat reached the shore, the men moved quickly to conceal it and move its crated cargo with all haste to the shore, while their leader met the contact who had ferried the cargo across the water. Together, they shook hands and inspected the contents of one of the crates. Automatic rifles, grenades, and blocks of high explosive - all effective for their purpose but also relatively easy to conceal.\n\nThe contact informed them that, if they could guarantee receipt, he could promise another shipment the next week. As well as every week thereafter. The Chechens quickly agreed. The effort required would be enormous, but the reward promised, an even more effective way to fight the hated Germans, was impossible to ignore.\n\nReturned to the departing boat, the contact smiled as it returned across the sea. The Chechens were Eurasians such as he, suffering under extreme oppression. But, in time and with the assistance he would provide, the Passionarist Revolution would come to the Caucasus. The Guide had promised it."

 KOM_gumilyov_superregional.14.d: "Today, in an unnamed town's central square, a travelling lecture was being held. This lecture was to be a public one, one which would be free to all and sponsored by the government. The speakers, as they said, would be sharing with the audience a history of Eurasia and the virtues of the State.\n\n"Come one, come all! Eurasia is for you and I, from the east to the west!" Makeshift movie theatres, pamphlets, art shows, and more showed the history of Eurasia, one shared not just by the Rus, but by all peoples. What started out as an intellectual movement started by the émigré movement, championed by princes and essayists, evolved into geopolitical concepts which was later picked up by the Guide of the Passionariyy Revolution, Lev Gumilyov. Gumilyov's studies and policies as the then-leader of Ust-Sysolsk would form the foundation for the Eurasian state. Liberation of different ethnic peoples, from the Tatar to the Komi, would follow from the unification of Western Russia from their various warlord states. All peoples of Russia were now free to shape their own destiny; forward together under the Eurasian banner.\n\nCultural exhibitions from different ethnic groups were also showcased, providing a convenient propaganda platform as well as a chance at multicultural reconciliation between various spectators. All in all, these exhibitions and lectures would positively spread the message of Eurasia for the masses, one which would form a valiant new history for our nation."

Thank you for coming to our show.'\n\n'My pleasure, Sergei.'\n\n'Now, if I may jump straight to the point that everyone seems concerned about: some politicians have called you a fascist, citing some of your rhetoric. What do you think?'\n\n'Well, Sergei, I admit that I may, on occasion, be overzealous in my pursuit of restoring Russia's glories. I like to think that my rhetoric is, in fact, simply the product of me caring too much about the wellbeing of the nation.'\n\n'Oh? But what about allegations that claim you employ criminal activities in destabilizing opposition?'\n\n'I assure every listener that this is not true. I am a man of the law, a compassionate conservative. My campaign tactics revolved around appealing to the human spirit, to the past and to the present. The future requires a lot from us, and I simply do not believe the liberal parties to be capable of being able to guarantee prosperity. Those who do not believe me, look at Germany - they are fascists, no?'\n\n'Well, yes, they are.'\n\n'But I do not advocate for racial purity, nor do I foam at the mouth over revanchism?'\n\n'No, you don't.'"

'Cast your ballot!' cried the advertisements, everyone in Dmitry's class was participating in democracy, the foundation of the Republic itself!\n\nThe line was only eight dozen long, but Dmitry felt as if he had been waiting for centuries. He shot excited glances at the older men as they left the stations, until it was his turn. The process was rather simple, Dmitry cast the vote for 'democrats', and was off. His heart raced as he imagined telling his friends about voting day - he left the building, crossed the corner - bumped into a strange man in a trenchcoat, causing both to fall. The man had been carrying a crate out of which flew tiny slips of paper. Voting ballots? Dmitry recognized them immediately.

Additional factories have opened in XXX and XXXX, with our workforce increasing by 15%. Gospodin Shafarevich has also promised additional funding, in excess of 50% of the original amount, for all companies willing to employ disenfranchised farmers. This so-called 'Rural Initiative' is part of a plan to modernize the agricultural sectors and diversify the economy. I strongly advise all executives to heed this proposal, specifically by expanding into XXXXX. Further plans call for a 'Moral Economy' - the peasants will take priority in job applications, all companies whose workforce is at least 60% rural by XX/XX/XXXX, is to be granted excess of 80% of original grants."

In the corner of the bar, Emily noticed a quiet man, dressed in the same overcoat she saw guards wear upon arrival in Russia. Dammit Sam, where are you? We're being watched!\n\nStruggling through a group of farmers, Emily slipped and nearly fell on a table, across from which sat Sam, surrounded by cheery locals, flagon in hand.\n\n'Oh, darling!' she smiled, 'I wanna show you something!' Her husband, drunk beyond hope, could only nod and follow in a strange walk. Tagging him across and out the pub, Emily scanned the street, turned and whispered: 'What were you thinking, making a fool of yourself! You left the hotel hours ago!' Sam hugged his wife, quickly pushed away, 'H-heh, I was only gone for five minutes!' Silently, Emily prepared a speech, but saw the overcoat man in the valley on the other street, watching them. She grabbed her husband's hand and rushed in the hotel's direction. It was not until the couple had settled in for the night that Emily dropped her guard. When morning came, she escaped her husband's hangover, visiting other tourists in the lobby. Oh and how many there were: flooding in from all over the world..."

As an infantryman, you must be prepared to enter fatal combat, be willing to accept wound and death - but also be strong of heart, never flee the field, nor desert your comrades. Furthermore, desertion is one of the highest slights one can inflict on the Russian nation. By retreating, you are helping the enemy and will be punished as a traitor deserves.

They liked it a lot there, except the cold. Oh, and the agents too.'\nDmitry's eyes suddenly shot up at George, 'What agents?'\n'Don't know, man.

We're a democratic republic, just like America! See,' he pointed across the street, 'we've even got our own White House!'\n'Really?'\n'Yeah, Gospodin Shafarevich lives there.

Among his outlandish claims is the idea that America 'allowed' Russia to be conquered by Germany. The United States, despite its isolationist stance, was well known to have a mighty industry and large manpower pool - the failure of the Western nations to help the Soviet Union was a major factor in its collapse. The letter has also been sent to 'important officials', namely governors and senators.

 KOM_shafarevich_superregional.1.d: "The scene was familiar to Shafarevich. Once again, he was in his study, a candle by his side. The weak light illuminated his work, the schematics for a road, again. Chalk-dust caked his hands, and he looked at his watch. Almost dawn. Yet, this work could not wait. There were no longer fetters to his progress. No more Suslov, no more Stalina, no more Taboritsky, and, sadly, no more Gumilyov. He missed them. Enemies they were, and adversaries, yet they almost seemed to be a call-back to easier times, when he was just a mathematician with tenure in Ust-Sysolsk's university.\n\nIt was, again, a road. Street plans, points of illumination, specifications of material. As President of the Republic, his work had come to take entire days to finish. It was rare that he got the chance to work on an independent project of his. The roads were uncluttered, clear, ways of transport that ferried the pedestrians to their places, safe and quick.\n\nHe stepped back, and clapped his hands together, dispersing clouds of white over his uniform. Shafarevich could have sent for a servant downstairs to fetch him a basin of water, but he liked it that way. They can wash his shirt and trousers later. As the sun rose on the horizon, the work's significance became clearer and clearer. A reordering of the streets of Ust-Sysolsk, a project that would entail the destruction and reconstruction of the city. He laughed. He was proud, even if his work was pointless. Shafarevich had all the power to enforce his will, but he would not. Democracy was a useful tool, and he would like to maintain it."

"Today, we gather here in celebration of our democratic ideas: against the nations that conspire to divide us Russians from solidarity to one another. Great were their efforts, but today, we have broken their hold on us. We, the great Russian nation, have broken the shackles placed upon us by the time of our ancestors - fulfilling our destiny."\n\nShafarevich cleared his voice. "I admit that it is rather queer for a mathematician to speak of destinies. Romantic notions are not part and parcel of my work; those kinds of thinking I will leave to others. For much of my career, I have been a theoretician, a scientist. Today, I stand before you an architect, and also an engineer. You, the deputies of this renewed legislature, are my partners in our work. Russia has chosen you; each of the deputies in this chamber Russia has elected to serve in his post.

Then you'll need to submit it to Office E-22, and apply for a copy of the form to send to the Bureau Registrar at Office A-05 before sending it off to Office H-18. Understand?'\n\nFeigenbaum committed the instructions for navigating the bureaucratic labyrinth to memory and nodded.\n\nAfter what felt like half an hour trying to navigate the identical-looking office halls to find Office B-35, Feigenbaum sat down at that office reception. He didn't even bother to keep track of the time after that when another receptionist called his name. He asked for his form when she shook her head.\n\n'I'm sorry. The receptionist downstairs made a mistake. You need a copy of Form 2834-R before I can give you the voter registration form. You can get it at Office E-48, three floors up and down to the right. I'm sorry if it sounds complex, but due to incidents of past voter fraud we need to keep thorough records of every potential voter.'\n\nFeigenbaum's mouth dropped as he exited the room, failing to notice what Office E-48 was labelled on the building map that he stomped past in frustration."

 KOM_shafarevich_superregional.4.d: "The inhabitants of the village of Yukseyevo gathered at the church to see a man giving a speech. However, the man, whose name was Borisyuk, not a priest giving a sermon, but a member of the Russian National Party, the ruling party of the new democratic regime. That did not make what he was speaking about no less interesting than the Bible.\n\nOver the course of a few hours he talked of how the Passionarriyy believed in traditional Russian values; of God, the Church and the family which made many of the villagers nod their heads or murmur amongst themselves in agreement. After giving his speech, Borisyuk took a brief break to take questions.\n\n'Sir,' a man in the back asked, 'You said the closest polling station is the district capital. That's a 5-hour walk on a good day. Is there any way we can get there any faster?'\n\n'An excellent question,' Borisyuk replied, 'In fact, the RNP will offer free bus rides to polling stations for everyone who supports the party. Transport by bus to the district capital will take less than an hour.'\n\nThe villagers mumbled amongst themselves. Free rides for RNP voters? It was a long time since any form of organized public transport came to these parts of Russia; even cars were hard to come by except for the well-to-do these days. The entire church burst into applause and cheers over the promise, as each villager made their own plans to vote for the RNP in the coming elections."
 KOM_shafarevich_superregional.4.a: "The best way to win votes is to get as many supporters as possible to the polling stations."

 ### Eurasian Dream events ###
 eurasianism.0.t: "Steppe Sun"
 eurasianism.0.d: "At the center of Eurasia lies the shattered state of Kazakhstan. A long-standing ally of the Russian people, the steppe riders have fallen upon hard times. Their temples are now dust, the legacy of the Golden Horde a fleeting memory within the minds of aging professors. However, Central Asia is also home to many artifacts from the time of the Mongols. Fine vases, jewelry, sabers, and shields that, if obtained, will surely help us to evoke a sense of Eurasian unity. A call-back to a greater past is necessary.\n\nOur commanders have concluded that the best place to search for these artifacts is in Konstanay. The followers of Islam have amassed a fine collection of religious artifacts there, ranging from sacred texts to pieces of Kazakh history. The generals have advised assembling a strike force and invading immediately, but we cannot afford to be so hasty. A full-blown invasion is currently above our logistical capacity, but the artifacts we seek are very old and fragile. Instead, it is necessary to assemble on the border and attack with a single division - the glorious armies of Eurasia will push through, rout the garrison, and carefully seize the treasures of the steppe."
 eurasianism.0.a: "Have a strike force ready."

 eurasianism.1.t: "Eurasianist Raiding Party Crosses Border"
 eurasianism.1.d: "It seems that our Eurasian neighbors to the north have graduated from aggressive posturing to full on attack. News has arrived informing us that a Eurasian raiding party has crossed into Kazakh land and is rapidly approaching settlements near the border. The military has identified nearby garrisons and has begun moving them into position as we organize a defense. While such raids certainly haven't been uncommon since the collapse, it's the first time a Russian warlord of this size has organized a war band like this.\n\nAs information about this new state has emerged, strategists in our government have increasingly expressed concerns that this Eurasian State might be angling to eventually conquer Kazakhstan. We must meet their raiding party with a show of force to dissuade the thought."
 eurasianism.1.a: "Peace remains but a memory in the post-Soviet wastes."
 
 eurasianism.2.t: "Steppe Sun: Success!"
 eurasianism.2.d: "Just as we predicted, the ragtag bunch of farmers that the Kazakhs call an 'army' was forced to retreat from our assault. A group of soldiers penetrated the outskirts of a temple village, drawing the attention of its garrison. The majority of Kazakh forces gave chase as our forward troops retreated to a defensible position in the woods. Meanwhile, a strike team infiltrated the undermanned town, cutting through the streets until they came upon a heavily fortified storehouse. Entering through the windows, the team extracted:\n\n-A medieval vase depicting Mongolian cavalry\n-A tapestry of Golden Horde soldiers\n-An old book detailing the conquests of our ancestors\n-A ceremonial dagger\nThe artifacts have been transported to a secure location and await further study."
 eurasianism.2.a: "They never stood a chance."

 eurasianism.201.t: "Eurasians Escape with Stolen Relics"
 eurasianism.201.d: "Unfortunately it appears we were outsmarted in our battle with the invaders. Eurasian troops were able to penetrate through our forces and entered a small village close to the Russian border. The garrison reacted quickly, chasing the invading Eurasians back to where they came from. However, it appears a smaller group of Eurasians came in after them and caused havoc in the small town, which lay undefended.\n\nThough, while we expected the Eurasians to plunder our riches or steal our food supply, they instead only took artifacts from the village's temple. Relics of the Mongol era, the artifacts have been judged as worthwhile to historians, but to us, we should be glad that's all they took. So while some aging historians might be devastated, it's lucky that they didn't find our cache of weapons hidden in the same village. A few dead soldiers and villagers aren't too much to suffer for a raid."
 eurasianism.201.a: "What do they want with some old artifacts anyway?"

 eurasianism.3.t: "Steppe Sun: Failure!"
 eurasianism.3.d: "Grave news from the Kazakh border. In an attempt to extract valuable artifacts from the Kazakhs, our strike team encountered many difficulties. The garrison of their target city was triple the predicted strength, ruling out the established plan to bait them to the outskirts. Forced to improvise, the soldiers launched an assault from the rear. Unfortunately, a column of steppe calvary was patrolling the nearby farms and intercepted the strike force. Surrounded, our men were swiftly cut down. Out of sixty, only three managed to escape via the forests. Worse yet, informants report that the Kazakhs have relocated the artifacts to a more secure location in the South."
 eurasianism.3.a: "That treasure will be ours... someday."

 eurasianism.301.t: "Eurasians Beaten Back"
 eurasianism.301.d: "All Eurasian troops have been forced to retreat today as we were able to push back their largest force and encircle a strike group headed towards one of our villages. Our great Kazakh warriors have once again defended their homeland against Russian aggression. With our large garrison guarding the village and our superior troops holding the border, the strike group was entirely cut down by a nearby calvary patrol when they attempted an assault through the rear. Suffering massive casualties, all Eurasians have exited Kazakhstan to return to the pitiful place they came from. More importantly, the riches of the village have been relocated further into our territory so something like this doesn't happen again. The Eurasians will learn to never plunder from us!"
 eurasianism.301.a: "The riches are safe!"

 eurasianism.4.t: "Strangers from the North"
 eurasianism.4.d: "An unusual report has drawn the attention of our government- yesterday a group of Russians flew into Lhasa, requesting entry to conduct an "archaeological expedition". Upon examination of their credentials, we determined that only one of them has any sort of international credentials, and most appear to be students of some kind or another. An entry interview revealed that they are entering on behalf of the [KOM.GetName], searching for artifacts of "ancient Eurasian civilizations." Further inquiries as to what they meant by this have been met with insistence on their academic integrity and qualifications, and of the great importance of their mission.\n\nHowever, they have paid for the proper permits and demonstrated some degree of credentials, and we have found no reason to bar their entry into the country. A representative from one of our universities will be sent along to monitor their progress, just in case."
 eurasianism.4.a: "In this majestic isolation, perhaps they will find what they seek."

 eurasianism.5.t: "Project Agartha: Travel"
 eurasianism.5.d: "Dmitry breathed in the freshest air he had ever smelled in his entire life. An icy breeze came from the massive mountains of Lhasa, accompanied by a light snowfall. The officials had (begrudgingly) given Dmitry and his crew permission to explore these wild peaks for the next month. An hour-long trip brought them to a large plateau in the hills, but there was still much ground to cover. Eurasia spared no expense in supplying them with the newest equipment available, and there was so much to see... for a second, Dmitry wanted to stay here. Russia was a smoldering mess, the air polluted by decades of warfare, but here... he looked up at the gray sky: the lazy clouds were close now, and he felt as if he was on the climb to heaven.\n\nBut a job was a job, and he had to make the University proud. The team would soon approach Chodak, the last major settlement this high up. And after that? Getting to the top cliffs was possible, but the professor felt a deep sense of dread as he stared at the jagged peaks, like daggers waiting to impale some unfortunate climber. They would need help.\n\nCommunications were still possible, so he could request helicopters from back home - they would get far, saving time. Alternatively, Chodak was rumored to be home to many guides, but their array of skills come at a price. Lastly, the team could attempt to brave the mountain by themselves, although Dmitry's training was limited to smaller heights in the Urals."
 eurasianism.5.a: "Call the choppers!"


 eurasianism.6.t: "Project Agartha: Crossroads"
 eurasianism.6.d: "Dmitry couldn't help but smile as he pulled up the last member of his team. The last three days were the most challenging of his life, but now they were here: the mountain peaks themselves. All around him, columns of rock and icy stretched to the skies, not unlike dancers, celebrating their arrival. Although breathing was difficult here, Dmitry allowed himself a laugh. He had come so far. From the Battle of Moscow to the great retreat, the second offensive, the betrayals... his mind slipped into a state of blissful ignorance where nothing but the present mattered. They were here, but there were many paths, and so, oh so little time.\n\nThe team could venture higher: the locals below informed them of a monastery perched atop a great mountain. The monks there would offer them refuge and could provide important information concerning old Eurasia. Alternatively, the team could travel forward into a mountain pass. They had some geological equipment, perhaps the crags tell stories of their own. Supposedly, there is another, smaller village to the East. Inhabited by hermits, it has limited contact with the world below."
 eurasianism.6.a: "To the monastery!"
 eurasianism.6.b: "To the pass!"
 eurasianism.6.c: "To the village!"

 eurasianism.7.t: "Project Agartha: Monastery"
 eurasianism.7.d: "Entering the monastery was akin to the war's end, Dmitry thought. Fighting in the trenches, against the Soviets and monarchists, drenched in blood and mud. But at the end, a reprieve: when his division returned to Ust-Sysolsk they were permitted to shower, a rarity in the Russian wastes. The cold water washed away the dirt, but also memories of slaughter.\n\nSo it was here: The monastery stood against the snowstorm outside, massive yet tranquil, dimly lit by overhanging lamps. It was a welcome break from the struggle to get here, and the monks were welcoming. The team spent the next week resting and learning of their faith - they had only one translator, but that was sufficient to understand the history of Tibet.\n\nAs much as Dmitry appreciated comfort, he had a mission to accomplish. Long conversations with the monks revealed that there was a valley nearby, where 'ancient things lay'. Attempts to get the monks to elaborate on this statement only revealed the team's stress. The mountain mystics could cleanse their minds through intense meditation, and Dmitry silently admitted that he could use some help. However, the monastery held many ancient texts - it would take the team a week at least to decipher less than a fraction of them, but there was no doubt they held information on the past."
 eurasianism.7.a: "Explore the valley."
 eurasianism.7.b: "Clear your mind."
 eurasianism.7.c: "View the ancient texts."

 eurasianism.8.t: "Project Agartha: Valley"
 eurasianism.8.d: "Once again unto the breach', Dmitry thought. The valley, at least, seemed welcoming. The snow had stopped, and plugging one's ears was sufficient to silence the roaring winds. Few plants grew in these white peaks, mostly brown grass consumed by mountain goats. There were quite a few of them here - their white fur blended with the snow, so the team had to carefully navigate through.\n\nEventually, they made it to the end of the valley: a gigantic cliff, flanked by barren mountains, leading into seemingly bottomless pits below. The monks had hinted at there being pathways along the mountains' sides, leading into a complex cave system. The team got to work, fastening ropes and climbing over death itself until they found a single, snow-filled cave. Dmitry was the first to enter, and immediately spotted movement on the other end. He broke into a sprint, but movement was slow. He was sure that something had moved in the distance, but when he got there, all that remained was a print in the snow."
 eurasianism.8.a: "But what was it?"

 eurasianism.9.t: "Project Agartha: Meditation"
 eurasianism.9.d: "The lone candle illuminated the cramped room, and a chilling breeze swept in from the many windows. Dmitry had never meditated before. True, there were days when he would lay in bed, contemplating his life and running inventory on those who have wronged him. But his mind was ablaze with information, deadlines that had to be met, papers to be written.\n\n'Breathe in, out, in and out.' said the monk next to him. His voice was as smooth as the blanket of snow outside.\n\nDmitry tried to block the distractions around him, he made many attempts to venture into the dark pit that was his mind. Days came and went like this, every member of the team meditating and sleeping, while the archeological equipment rusted.\n\nOn the last day, Dmitry knew he had failed. They found nothing in Tibet, and he would receive all the blame. His mind raged against the world, against unfair government and cruel tyrants. The monk understood and placed his soft hand on Dmitry's shoulder. But the Russian looked back at him with angry eyes."
 eurasianism.9.a: "Was it worth it?"

 eurasianism.10.t: "Project Agartha: Sacred Texts"
 eurasianism.10.d: "The writing on the scrolls took many days to decipher. Meticulous work, even with the help of the monks, required every member of the team to participate. They ate little, but with every page turned the Russians felt their time running out. Stacks describing trivial events, 'modern' history, until:\n\nA single scroll, depicting the ancient Tibetan Empire. Dmitry doubted its accuracy, but the information was there. The map showed borders stretching from the Himalayas to Mongolian steppes. They had made the link.\n\nThe next day, the monks woke up to find their library emptied, and not a sign of gratitude from their hurried guests."
 eurasianism.10.a: "A piece of the past."

 eurasianism.11.t: "Project Agartha: Mountain Pass"
 eurasianism.11.d: "The mountain pass was rather wide - two peaks, sloping directly downwards, flanked an icy road. The team erected tents along the edge of a cliff, to avoid falling ice. The first week went as planned, with the geologist ordering others around. Rock samples were collected, and a makeshift laboratory set up within camp. However, it soon became obvious that there was too much ground to cover. A frozen stream nearby could have as many, if not more, secrets than the mountains themselves. The rocks all greatly differed from each other, so a concentrated effort will have to be made that involves the entire team."
 eurasianism.11.a: "Analyze rock samples."
 eurasianism.11.b: "Analyze the waters."
 
 eurasianism.12.t: "Project Agartha: Rocks"
 eurasianism.12.d: "Dmitry had almost given up. The howling wind took his bravery, the dullness of life his interests. The team toiled day after day, but showed no results. There was simply too much material to study, but it was too heavy to transport back to Russia.\n\nHowever, just as hope faded, a cry came from the laboratory. Dmitry jumped from bed and ran across camp in plain clothes, running across snow felt like moving on knives. But it was worth it. The head geologist had made a breakthrough: The majority of rocks found in this region were the same ones as those in the Urals! Old Union accounts substantiated this claim. The geology of Eurasia must then be standard throughout - the same in Tibet as Western Russia.\n\nPatting his teammate on the back, Dmitry ordered camp to fold. They will head back to Russia, this time with results."
 eurasianism.12.a: "History through geology."

 eurasianism.13.t: "Project Agartha: Waters"
 eurasianism.13.d: "Dmitry had almost given up. The howling wind took his bravery, the dullness of life his interests. The team toiled day after day, but showed no results. There was simply too much material to study, but it was too heavy to transport back to Russia.\n\nThe river provided nothing. A group of three fell in last night, nearly freezing to death. The geologist was among them, and yet their samples yielded nothing. This stream flowed from the mountains, but was completely alien when compared to the waters of the Urals. It was completely clean, unpolluted, see through... entirely un-Eurasian.\n\nThe entire expedition was a waste of time. When the helicopters arrived to pick up the team, Dmitry could only sit silently, dreading what awaited yet another failure in the homeland."
 eurasianism.13.a: "There was nothing there."

 eurasianism.14.t: "Project Agartha: Mountain Village"
 eurasianism.14.d: "Dmitry couldn't believe his eyes: an entire village, surviving in these desolate hills. Well, calling it a village was generous - fifty people at most, walking corpses by the looks of them. Yet their eyes seemed ever calm, they made no jerky movements, nor betrayed any worry. They ate the occasional mountain goat, some vegetation that barely scraped by, and drank from the nearby streams.\n\nThe team was welcomed, the only translator negotiated a rock cabin in exchange for some trinkets. By this point, Dmitry realized that this did not necessarily have to be a purely scientific expedition. These people must know much about the past, they seemed to be the type to conform to oral tradition. He could go about questioning the elders about the past. Alternatively, they could listen in on the village gossip in hopes of learning something. Lastly, there was a valley nearby that the team could explore. The villagers said nothing good lived there and that the place should be avoided at all costs."
 eurasianism.14.a: "Question the elders."
 eurasianism.14.b: "Listen around the village."
 eurasianism.14.c: "Explore the valley."

 eurasianism.15.t: "Project Agartha: Elders"
 eurasianism.15.d: "The elders lived in a large hall, made of mountain stone and salt. They spent all day discussing ancient events, eating and sleeping. At first sight, they seemed frail, unable to walk. But, much to the team's amazement, every single one of them could do everything a younger man could - walk, eat, even withstand the cold outside.\n\nThe translator initiated conversation while the team brainstormed topics. Dmitry could only wait for the results. He forgot about the very concept of time here - the village oversaw the mountains below, a sight for sore eyes.\n\nEventually, the elders got talking about their folklore. This fascinated Dmitry, as he remembered the tales he heard as a child in the Union. Legends of witches, legendary warriors, monsters and demons sounded uncanny. So familiar, in fact, that the only explanation that Tibet and Russia could share mythology elements was that both had, at one point, belonged to Eurasia. Tape recorders were set up, stories told, and finally the team made progress."
 eurasianism.15.a: "We have learned much."

 eurasianism.16.t: "Project Agartha: Gossip"
 eurasianism.16.d: "The village talk was rather trivial. The biggest problem on everyone's mind was the marriage of a young couple. A massive ceremony was to be organized, where everyone could feast on three goats and food imported from below.\n\nSome youngster was known as the village handyman. He did all the manual tasks, ferrying repair materials and hunting animals. When asked about Eurasia, he responded with: 'What in the hell is Eurasia? Do I look like I care? My own people don't take me seriously! They just keep giving me fetch quests.'\n\nThe elders blabbered old myths, but nobody had the time to listen. The village women wove great patterns out of goat hair, but so far no connection to Eurasia was established.\n\nAs the weeks came and went, Dmitry felt a deep sense of dread. It was too late, and they had failed. The helicopters would be waiting for them tomorrow morning, and they had nothing to show for all the investments. Back in Eurasia, they might even get the punishment of failures."
 eurasianism.16.a: "Time wasted."

 eurasianism.17.t: "Project Agartha: Valley"
 eurasianism.17.d: "Once again unto the breach', Dmitry thought. The valley, at least, seemed welcoming. The snow had stopped, and plugging one's ears was sufficient to silence the roaring winds. Few plants grew in these white peaks, mostly brown grass consumed by mountain goats. There were quite a few of them here - their white fur blended with the snow, so the team had to carefully navigate through.\n\nEventually, they made it to the end of the valley: a gigantic cliff, flanked by barren mountains, leading into seemingly bottomless pits below.

He broke into a sprint, but movement was slow. He was sure that something had moved in the distance, but when he got there, all that remained was a print in the snow."
 eurasianism.17.a: "But what was it?"

 eurasianism.18.t: "Eurasian Archeology Team at the Border"
 eurasianism.18.d: "Over the course of the past week, the newly created Eurasian State to our north has opened up diplomatic channels in the hopes of sending an archeology team to inspect some ancient ruins in Sharaz and Isfahan. While we were initially skeptical of these communications, as we are with most things that have come out of the Russian wastes in recent decades, it appears that we were in fact dealing with this new Eurasian power.\n\nStrange though it may seem for this only recently reunited Russian power to have contacted us, and apparently others, for the sole purpose of sending their archeologists abroad. Normally such getting the paperwork through with these kinds of extended trips into the country takes a few weeks, but given that they've offered a significant payment in exchange for allowing their team across the border, we've decided to fast track their applications."
 eurasianism.18.a: "So long as they don't touch anything."

 eurasianism.19.t: "Project Like Father"
 eurasianism.19.d: "Geography itself dictates that the Middle East is a part of Asia, and therefore Eurasia. However, the Cradle of Civilization has been neglected by the fates. Ravaged by war and Germanic corporations, once-proud nations such as Persia live out their miserable existence in servitude. If Eurasia is to be successful, it must prove that the Southern lands are an integral part of our people. Indeed, Timur the Great, descendant of the Universal Ruler himself, once stormed the Middle East. His hordes overran its puny defenders, destroyed Persia, establishing a lasting legacy there.\n\nOur expedition teams are standing by to journey to Khorasan, in Eastern Iran. Legend has it that Timur the Great pacified a revolt there, exemplifying the qualities of a Eurasian: discipline, honor, and temperance. The Iranian government, unfortunately, is not so keen to let us in. Dominated by foreign interests, the puny nation scrambles to any scrap of economic independence it can get. Its leaders demand that we lease some resources in exchange for access to Khorasan."
 eurasianism.19.a: "Promise them steel."
 eurasianism.19.b: "Assist their military assets."
 eurasianism.19.c: "Establish aluminium mines."

 eurasianism.20.t: "Project Like Father: Partial Success"
 eurasianism.20.d: "The archeology team has just arrived from Khorasan. The journey was difficult, as their dig was interrupted by a group of bandits (likely hired by the barbarian Germanics). However, powered by superior Eurasian will, our scientists defended the site with a machine gun nest, only sustaining 43% casualties. The following week was spent on charting the area, consisting of red mountains overshadowing crumbling settlements. Isfizar was the only 'surviving' city - itself pillaged in 1384, but the sands preserve all things.\n\nThe following month was spent gathering artifacts and questioning locals. An enlightened nomad spoke of Isfizar's walls being built from the bones of Timur's enemies, although the team failed to substantiate this theory. Nevertheless, pottery and tools were recovered and transported for further analysis. They do not have direct relations to Eurasia, but the propagandists can fix that."
 eurasianism.20.a: "Tell the peasants that Timur was from Eurasia."

 eurasianism.21.t: "Project Across the Wall"
 eurasianism.21.d: "The people may die, but the land remains. Millions of Russians have perished, driven from the homelands, pushed to the fringe. However, the Ural Mountains stand tall, defiant against the shifting tides of history. They are home to warlords, ancient caves, hostile forces, and... hidden knowledge? Rumour speaks of the riches of Zlatoust, that within their vaults lie things other than guns. It is necessary to investigate the high peaks, to unearth whatever it is they may have. Informants speak of deposits left by the old Russians, from centuries ago.\n\nUnfourtunatly, it is unlikely that our eastern brethren will give permission to investigate. We must assemble a strike force, pierce enemy lines, investigate the mountains' edges for clues of Eurasia."
 eurasianism.21.a: "Prepare the units."
 
 eurasianism.22.t: "Raiders from the West"
 eurasianism.22.d: "News has come in from our western border that several outposts have gone silent. Scouting expeditions report the raiders that destroyed them have moved towards a relatively unimportant region of our country. A few captured prisoners have stated their goal is to "restore the treasures of Eurasia to their rightful owners," which confirms our suspicions that they are from the government of Lev Gumilyov. While they do not seem to have any official support, this is one of the largest raids we have experienced on our territory, and our generals advise a rapid military response."
 eurasianism.22.a: "Throw these invaders back across the Urals!"

 eurasianism.23.t: "Project Across The Wall: Success!"
 eurasianism.23.d: "Evgeny waited as his strike team searched the small, abandoned facility that had remained unguarded ever since the Eurasian forces had pushed the West Siberians into a retreat. After breaking through the West Siberian lines, his small force was able to sneak past the enemy, deep into the Urals. Now, all they had to do was find something of use that he could bring back home to his superiors.\n\n"Find anything yet?" He shouted, eager to get out and head home.\n\n"We found a rifle, a couple of pistols, and a few grenades, but besides that, nothing of real interest." Answered Viktor, one of the strike team members.\n\n"Really? You would think a facility in Zlatoust would have more than that." Responded Evgeny, now looking disappointed.\n\n"Looks like they knew we were coming and evacuated most stuff before we got here. Or, more likely, this place hasn't seen use in years." The team began to regroup.\n\n"Hold on, let me have a look at that rifle." Said Evgeny. Picking it up, he examined it carefully, weighing it in his hands. "I haven't seen anything like this before. You think it's experimental?"\n\n"I would guess so, sir. Nothing like we have back in Eurasia, surely. You think that's enough?" Replied Viktor.\n\n"No, they wanted something less... new." Evgeny examined the rifle once more. "Some paint here and a few touchups there should do the trick nicely. If it looks old they'll take our word for it. Once we're done it will look like a believable ancient weapon from Old Eurasia!""
 eurasianism.23.a: "We showed them!"

 eurasianism.231.t: "Eurasians Steal Weapons!"
 eurasianism.231.d: "Although we sent some of the best men West Siberia has to offer, Eurasian forces were still able to break through our lines and send our forces into a retreat. Large amounts of Eurasian troops proceeded to search throughout the Urals after our forces surrendered, and we have reports that a Eurasian strike group located an old vault in Zlatoust and stole a small number of weapons. While the facility has been abandoned for years, we expect there were still some weapons of use to the Eurasians. Most worrying is that they may have found an experimental weapon in the vault. We will have to be prepared to know that the Eurasians may soon have more advanced weapons in the future. Hopefully, we will have the same."
 eurasianism.231.a: "We made our best defense."

 eurasianism.24.t: "Project Across The Wall: Failure!"
 eurasianism.24.d: "While we may have gotten close to achieving our goals of searching the peaks of the Ural mountains, it seems our strike team was less than qualified at completing their mission. With the West Siberians holding against our main force, the strike team was routed by the Ural Garrison and forced to retreat. Rumors have even spread that the strike team refused to fight, abandoning their weapons to flee for their worthless lives.\n\nTheir failure cannot go unpunished. The treasures that surely lie beneath the mountains and atop the peaks will remain there, at least for now. The loss of ancient Eurasian weapons and riches unseen anywhere else in Russia is unfortunate, but not devastating. We cannot lose what we do not have.\n\nMeanwhile, the cowardly strike team will be rewarded with the firing range once they reach [KOM.Capital.GetName]. Their example should hopefully show the rest of the military how serious these incursions are. Perhaps we should be more careful in choosing our elites next time as well.\n\nWe will likely be able to return to the Urals one day, hopefully with a much larger and more adept force. The West Siberians will guard their treasures for now, but one day we shall return."
 eurasianism.24.a: "All the more reason to destroy the enemy."

 eurasianism.241.t: "Eurasians Retreat Outside the Urals"
 eurasianism.241.d: "Days after Eurasian troops first entered the Urals, the last has finally retreated, and the battle has been one. Our infantry forces, holding along the mountains, stood their ground and refused to let the bulk of the Eurasian army through. We also believe that we were able to cause massive casualties to the Eurasian forces, so they'll know better next time to attack West Siberia in the defendable Ural Mountains.\n\nA smaller strike group was also intercepted by our reinforcements. Most fled with their tails between their legs, even leaving their weapons behind. Whatever they wanted, they won't be getting it."
 eurasianism.241.a: "The Urals keep us safe!"

 eurasianism.25.t: "Project Golden Legacy"
 eurasianism.25.d: "It is widely known among learned individuals in our lands that relics of our Eurasian culture can be found in old buildings and buried towns. However, modern Russia has become distant from its native culture, not just in its historical conscience, but in geographical terms. Our archaeological teams have recently located several sites of great cultural and historical value within our borders, but report that they are located in difficult terrain where we cannot bring even motor vehicles reliably, let alone delicate measurement tools and modern excavation equipment. To gain access to these sites we will need to invest in roads to transport necessary supplies to the sites, hire guards to fend off looters, and prepare transportation for any finds we make. This all needs to be done quickly to ensure that the project is completed in a reasonable amount of time, as we have more pressing matters to attend to."
 eurasianism.25.a: "Set aside the funds."

 eurasianism.26.t: "Project Golden Legacy: Success!"
 eurasianism.26.d: "It was a chilly day as always, yet Gavriil felt like something was special about this one. He had been leading the project to search for signs of an ancient Eurasian civilization and had spent months building the infrastructure to find something that could prove the truth of the Eurasian identity. Now, he and his colleagues believed they had struck a goldmine.\n\n"We found something!" Came a shout from the dig site. "Something big! I think it's some sort of burial ground!"\n\nGavriil jumped up excitedly. He knew it! "Dig throughout the entire area. Make sure to recover any skeletons."\n\nA few hours later and almost the entire sit was fully excavated. "The age of this burial ground almost certainly dates over hundreds of centuries ago," said one of his colleagues. "This furthers the proof a Eurasia dating back into the medieval era!"\n\n"Yes, yes, it surely does." Replied Gavriil. "And look at those skeletons! The size of them, the bone structure. This fits just in with everything we expected, proving the superiority of the Eurasian race. The way the burial ground was hidden as well, it's almost like-"\n\n"Like they only wanted it to be found by other Eurasians." Said another explorer. "No Romano-Germanic could construct a burial ground this advanced."\n\n"Most certainly!" Gavriil replied giddily. "And the treasures, by far the most majestic I've seen. Ancient gold coins, goblets, and statues. Even a battle-ax, still perfectly intact and as good as new! Only a Eurasian could be buried with this weapon. If a burial site like this doesn't justify Eurasia, nothing does!""
 eurasianism.26.a: "Make sure to search everything!"

 eurasianism.27.t: "Project Golden Legacy - Failure"
 eurasianism.27.d: "Unfortunately, we have failed to provide sufficient funding for the excavations in this region. Academic interest has decreased significantly due to our failure to prioritize heritage studies, and the spark that should have lit the passionarity of Eurasia will only find damp kindling. Even worse, our negligence has led to damage from both inexperienced students and looters who seek to take the treasures of Eurasia for themselves! We cannot allow this to continue.\n\nWhile the current project has been mothballed due to the lack of funding and interest, we must make a renewed commitment to the study of our shared history, so as to proactively prevent failures such as this one."
 eurasianism.27.a: "Embarassing."

 eurasianism.28.t: "Project Cold Waters"
 eurasianism.28.d: "The old captain smirked as he placed down an old vodka, preserved within the heart of his ship for eight years. The Arctic night was harsher than any battlefield from his memory, and yet the man couldn't help but marvel at the students below. They chose to forfeit comfort in exchange for knowledge, the spirit of adventure... for a moment, he remembered his youth: a sense of wonder about the world, now squashed by the weight of reality.\n\nJust as the captain was about to turn in for the night, a shout came from camp. Turning, he spotted a boy running towards the ship, his outstretched arms holding some dark object.\n\n"Captain! Oh captain! Get ready to sail, we found it!" the student held an old plank, covered in snow, but the moonlight revealed old words: "Zaytseva". Within the hour, the crew was heading back to the mainland. The captain had asked for the artifact to be brought to his quarters. Brushing his hand along the wood, likely part of some ancient vessel, the man thought of the past. He remembered a time when Russia was free to explore the Arctic, unafraid of Western vessels."
 eurasianism.28.a: "He remembered Eurasia."

 eurasianism.29.t: "Russians Abound"
 eurasianism.29.d: "In a what would become a first for many young Chinese working in the foreign relations department, just a month ago we received communications from Russia. A new government emerging from the Russian wastes calling itself the Eurasian State opened up diplomatic relations with us not too long ago. And now, not a few weeks later, we have Russians touring through various Chinese history museums across the country.\n\nThough it did seem strange that their how insistent they were on sending this group of 'Eurasian' archeologists to tour our nation's historical artifacts, they did seem amenable, even friendly. Though every nation inherits the geopolitical aims and struggles of its predecessor, perhaps with these few Russian visitors we might chart a new course for relations with our large neighbor to the north."
 eurasianism.29.a: "We should remind them to check out the gift shop."

 eurasianism.30.t: "Project Solar Flare"
 eurasianism.30.d: "Ranek expected the Shanxi trip to have taken longer, but he was surprised by how quickly they had arrived. Nina, Vlass, and himself had only been for a few days, yet they had explored many libraries, villages, and schools. But they were most excited for today, where they had been invited to the Xi'an Banpo Museum of ancient Chinese history, with artifacts dating back thousands of years.\n\nWalking around with an émigré guide, Ranek noted how some of the bowls were slightly similar to those found back home. Nina commented on how the shape of one of the skulls was almost exact to those found at Eurasian burial sites in North Russia. Vlass, examining one of the illustrations of the ancient settlement, discovered how the structures seemed akin to those found in the Kazakh steppes, as well as connecting them to early Eurasian cities.\n\n"I believe what we have seen here firmly plants the idea that Chinese history is directly connected to the history of Eurasia." Said Ranek. "The time periods are identical, and the similarities, impeccable."\n\nThe guide, now very confused, decided to speak up. "I'm not sure if you noticed, but almost all of these artifacts are from 6000 years ago. The people didn't even know Eurasia existed, much less China."\n\n"I'm sorry ma'am," said Nina. "But we're historians, and the connections between these structures here and early Eurasian cities are astounding."\n\n"You, Historians!" The guide sputtered. "I curate at this museum and the only cities at that time were nowhere near Russia!"\n\n"Well, new discoveries are being proven every day," said Ranek. "And today, we've proven that China is de jure part of Eurasia, just as we thought." And with that note, the group exited the museum and made their way to the next attraction."
 eurasianism.30.a: "Just as expected."

 eurasianism.31.t: "For Pseudoscience"
 eurasianism.31.d: "Our Eurasian neighbors have contacted us again, and this time with a very interesting proposition. The group of scientists which toured our nation's museums and cultural locations recently have expressed the desire to embark on an archeological expedition to a few tomb locations in areas nearby Sichuan. The Eurasian government seems keen on seeing this expedition through, and has already filled out almost all of the necessary paperwork.\n\nIn fact, their eagerness might provide an opportunity. Keeping routes to contentious provinces like Sichuan is very expensive and militarily draining. Keeping their expedition safe on the journey there may require some extra capital on the part of the Eurasians. Additionally, there are many "special permissions" that will need to be granted, some by Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere officials. Greasing those wheels might necessitate some funds as well."
 eurasianism.31.a: "Let's hope the Eurasians find what they're looking for."
 
 eurasianism.32.t: "Project Porcelain King"
 eurasianism.32.d: "We have received news back from our archeologists sent to China that they have come upon an impasse with the Chinese authorities. Our archaeologists are interested in excavating a large group of historic mounds to search for the remains of great warriors. Unfortunately, the Chinese are less than enthused about "ruining their cultural and historical heritage."\n\nIt seems our only way of gaining access is through negotiation, especially the monetary kind. We have three options for going forward with this. First, we send money to the archeologists to bribe the officials. It is no secret how corrupt the Chinese government is, and bribery will be the cheapest option. However, it is not certain if the officials will accept the bribe, no matter how much it is. There may be better, yet more expensive options. We could possibly offer the regional government money in exchange for inviting us to excavate the burial grounds. This would be much more expensive, as they would never accept a small bribe. However, it is once again uncertain if they will accept. While they probably need money, they may not be willing to take it in favor of letting us into the mounds.\n\nOur last option is negotiating a thorough agreement with the Chinese government. While probably having the most chance of success, it is by far the most expensive, and our biggest worry is that it could be a large waste of money if there turns out to be nothing of use in the mounds. Although, if there is, the value of whatever is hidden beneath the earth could easily repay it. Our archaeologists are starting to get impatient, so we should make a decision quickly."
 eurasianism.32.a: "Try to bribe the officials."
 eurasianism.32.b: "Offer the regional government money."
 eurasianism.32.c: "Negotiate a thorough agreement with the Republic."

 eurasianism.33.t: "A Eurasian Excavation"
 eurasianism.33.d: "Whatever those Russian archeologists found in those tombs must have been of some value to the Eurasianists, because they have approached our government yet again, and with a proposition that's, quite frankly, too good to refuse. They would like to negotiate a proper, long-running agreement for the excavation of sites in northern China, and have even offered to foot the cost. The archeologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences are ecstatic at this opportunity, and urging us to take the deal.\n\nAdditionally, a project of this size could be a significant revenue generator. Authorizing large scale projects like this often require a lot of paperwork and personal favours. Fortunately, it seems that our friends in the north are more than willing to provide for all these extra steps, and have even already offered some up front 'security funds' to get the ball rolling."
 eurasianism.33.a: "Lucrative friendships are the best kind."

 eurasianism.34.t: "Project Porcelain King: Partial Success"
 eurasianism.34.d: "Cyrille sat in his comfy chair, observing the excavators do their work. The archeology dig had been going on for a few days now after the successful negotiations with the Chinese. Exploring the smaller mounds without any luck, they had finally begun to crack open the largest one.\n\n"I think we found the entrance, boss!" Said one of the diggers.\n\n"Well, what are we waiting for, let's head inside!" Cyrille got up out of his chair and notified the Chinese, they found something.\n\nThe inside was dark, with only small bits of light coming through holes in the top. Turning on his flashlight, Cyrille and the other archeologists ventured into the large cave.\n\n"What is it?" Said another archeologist. "Ancient warriors? An Imperial Grave? Diamonds and gold?"\n\n"Unfortunately, quite the opposite it seems," Cyrille said, shocked at what he was seeing. Unending piles of skeletons filled the room, their eerie eyes fixated on the archeologists, with bones scattered all over. This wasn't the grave of mighty warriors. It was the mass grave of those slaughtered by those warriors.\n\n"It appears to me this is a mass grave from an ancient Mongolian invasion," said one of the Chinese officials, in broken Russian. "Since this is the property of the Chinese government, we will be taking all of the valuables within. I'm glad you decided to excavate this for us, it was definitely worth it."\n\nCyrille and the archeologists stood there, stunned. Had they dug the wrong grave? Were the great warriors buried in another location? The Chinese surely would not let them excavate another mound."
 eurasianism.34.a: "It was worth a try."

 eurasianism.35.t: "Project Porcelain King: Failure"
 eurasianism.35.d: "Unfortunately, the Chinese have denied our permission to dig in the ancient hills and search the burial mounds. It seems the secrets of the mounds will remain there for years to come. Whether they held the remains of great warriors or treasures beyond imagination, no one will know.\n\nIt appears we did not offer the Chinese enough to let us in. With our archeologists sent home defeated, we'll just have to look somewhere else to find more signs of Eurasia."
 eurasianism.35.a: "Damn them."

 eurasianism.36.t: "Eurasian Archeology Delegation"
 eurasianism.36.d: "Not long ago, a new power emerged from the ashes of Russia. These 'Eurasianists', as they call themselves, adhere to a strict ultranationalistic ideology that has seen their radical, and often quite brutal, government spread across Steppe. Given how far they have advanced, we knew it was likely they would contact us eventually, whether it be for support against Germany, economic aid, or even just political recognition. What we did not expect to be discussing with these Eurasians was a scholarly exchange of archaeologists to discuss archaeology and natural history in Russia.\n\nYet, their delegation in Washington came to the state department just the other day to discuss such matters. Hailing us as honorary Eurasians, being that most Americans were descended from Europeans, they seemed most inclined to discuss bringing American archeologists and scholars to discuss political and historical theories on their Eurasianist ideology. Should we send our scholars to Russia?"
 eurasianism.36.a: "It might be worth it in order for us to get a better understanding of their nation."
 eurasianism.36.b: "Sending a team of graduate students is much lower risk."
 eurasianism.36.c: "We are not sending American archeologists to visit the Russian wastes."

 eurasianism.37.t: "America Accepts!"
 eurasianism.37.d: "Great news! The Atlanticists have dispatched a team of scientists from Ivy League schools to discuss our ideology. They are scheduled to arrive in Ust-Sysolsk and Vyatka within the week. Our own professors have prepared lengthy lectures and written many papers to justify our idea. Now somebody will take us seriously!"
 eurasianism.37.a: "Great!"

 eurasianism.38.t: "America Sends Students"
 eurasianism.38.d: "The Atlanticists seem to think us jesters. In response to our request for an intellectually driven discussion between the academics of the two countries, they have dispatched students. Granted, they come from top universities, but this is a slight against the legitimacy of our nation that cannot be ignored!"
 eurasianism.38.a: "Still, better than nothing."

 eurasianism.39.t: "America Declines"
 eurasianism.39.d: "The wicked Atlanticists have ignored our request! Their scientists must think us jesters, sitting amidst the ruins of the old world, but one day we'll show them!"
 eurasianism.39.a: "Damnation!"

 eurasianism.40.t: "The Wind-Swept Steppe"
 eurasianism.40.d: "Grave news. Last month, a team was stealthily dispatched to the plains of Mongolia on a secret mission. Hidden under the cover of night, our units evaded patrols and entered the Gobi desert. Their mission was clear: Find the remains of Genghis Khan. According to legend, when the great conqueror died, he was buried in an uncharted part of the desert. The grave had no markings, and was ridden over by horses. Those who buried him were slain upon completion of the task.\n\nAlthough Mongolia is large, the search was limited to certain places based on ancient writings. The archeology team had to fend off bandits, Red Army remnants, and local units. The search lasted for over three weeks (see p.g. 19 on areas scoured). Local legends were consulted, but no corpse was ever found. The team was forced to withdraw through Central Asia due to increased military presence near the search sites."
 eurasianism.40.a: "He remains asleep."

 eurasianism.41.t: "Project Right Mind"
 eurasianism.41.d: "Tiny drops of red borscht fell from the old man's beard as he took in everything his son had told him. He had sent the grandson outside to play, a futile attempt at saving the kid's sanity. But boys will be boys, and the old man spotted his small head peeking out of the back door, listening to the fight.\n\n'You can't just wash away everything this family has stood for, dad!' the son yelled, smashing his fist into the dusty table. 'You're out of your mind, that's what you are! Filling my boy's mind with nonsense!'\nThe old man took another spoonful of soup, steeling his nerves. And to believe that once he was like his son. Misguided by petty ideology, blind to the history of his nation.\n'Are you even listening to me?!' the son rushed up to his father in a single, violent move. The grandson shuddered but kept observing. 'That's it. I'm done. I'm taking Boris to the city, away from you.' the son turned to the door, 'should've left the old man to his ramblings.' he mumbled.\nThe old man sighed and reached into his pocket, producing a pistol - a shot, a scream, but the grandson dared not look away. The son fell, grasping his bleeding leg. Silently, the old man stood up and walked over to his son. Before the latter could react, he brought down an iron spoon upon his neck, stabbing him, then switching to fists and pummeling the son. Ten minutes later, the old man dumped the mangled corpse outside and turned to his grandson. A part of the boy wanted to run away, but he stood, transfixed, unblinking. The old man picked him up, coughed, and asked:"
 eurasianism.41.a: "Eurasia sheds no tears. Will you?"
 
 eurasianism.42.t: "The Mughal Legacy"
 eurasianism.42.d: "In what has turned into a very strange week for India's foreign relations, we seem to have entered into negotiations with the Eurasian State for the excavation of an old Mughal fort. While we were initially under the impression that the large delegation Eurasia sent us was hoping to coordinate an economic or military agreement, they seemed most interested in certain archeological projects they had planned. In fact, their head archeologist, a part of the delegation, ended up giving a forty minute long presentation in Eurasianism and how uncovering Mughal artifacts would help them more solidly pinpoint the origins of the Eurasian race and culture.\n\nThough their motives are strange, their intentions seem to be innocent and their delegation was friendly enough, so our men in foreign relations handed them the proper paperwork and told them to apply for special permissions from the Indian government."
 eurasianism.42.a: "Let's see how they respond."

 eurasianism.421.t: "Project Old Mother: India's Request"
 eurasianism.421.d: "The Indian subcontinent is full of marvels. Ranging from the remains of ancient civilizations, to its many faiths, to its heritage and legacy, its people are unaware of their status within Eurasia.\n\nOur scientists have located an ancient Mughal Fortress, from a time before the Atlanticists dominated India. Perched high above a mountain, amidst a sea of jungle, maintained by nature alone, the place must be home to many artifacts. Indeed, the local government has responded to our interest, offering to accommodate an archeology team.\n\nUnfortunately, the nearby villages are poor. The people there lack electricity and running water; attaining food from the nearby forests is a dangerous task. Delhi refuses to provide adequate support to this backwater province, so a trade has been organized. The locals have hinted that we need to send over a "gift" in the form of developmental aid. Failure to do so within the week may lose their attention, locking us off from the fortress."
 eurasianism.421.a: "Give them modern equipment."
 eurasianism.421.b: "Help the village hunters."
 eurasianism.421.c: "Fund local projects."

 eurasianism.43.t: "Project Old Mother: Success"
 eurasianism.43.d: "The local government has secured its funding and allowed our expeditionary force to enter the Mughal Fortress. Ascending the mountain wasn't easy, but losses were minimal. The gates were locked and rusted, but the team gained access through the collapsed Western wing (see attachment). Most of the citadel's contents had withered through the ages, likely left alone for over three centuries. The armories were empty, but no records survive to explain this. No valuables survived, likely robbed by the locals years ago.\n\nWithin the fortress, the team located a large room protected by a 10-foot tall steel door. Explosives were authorized, revealing an untapped treasure room. Hundreds of coins, artifacts, precious metals and pottery are now in transit to our facilities in Vyatka. Most important of all, we found arms from the Caucus. We assume them to have belonged to ancient Russian mercenaries or explorers, but this find will only reinforce the idea of a united Eurasia."

 eurasianism.44.d: "To the southeast lies the realm of Indochina. Pillaged by the Atlanticists for its rubber, then by the malign forces of Nippon for its location, only now thrown the bone of independence. We must capitalize on the young nation's self-determination and send envoys immediately. There are many wonders in the land that even our Tengri ancestors failed to conquer. Temples hidden in seas of dense jungle, treasures buried deeper than the graves of Khans, all will be ours if we are able to secure the government's permission."
 eurasianism.44.a: "Send them a lucrative proposal."

 eurasianism.45.t: "A Proposal from Russia"
 eurasianism.45.d: "Interesting news has arrived from Western Russia. The region only recently recovered from a period of intense warlordism, now dominated by the reactionary Eurasianists based in the Ust-Sysolsk province. Intelligence found out that this new state has been sending out expeditions across Asia, searching for useless artifacts to justify their theories of a 'united Eurasia'. Their envoy has arrived in Saigon recently, asking for permission to set up an archeological expedition in the North. He claims that, in ages past, the region witnessed a monumental battle between our ancestors and the Mongolians."
 eurasianism.45.a: "Give them permission."
 eurasianism.45.b: "Kick these madmen out!"

 eurasianism.46.t: "Project Far Flung: Partial Success"
 eurasianism.46.d: "Saigon gave our expeditions the green light two weeks ago. Brave Eurasian scientists have been excavating the remains of a battlefield in Northern Vietnam, where a battle between Mongolian invaders and local guerrillas took place.\n\nAfter a long search through the jungle, a student came upon a large field. Excavation revealed long-dead skeletons and rusted arms. However, further research failed to substantiate the above claim - the battle fought here did not involve our Tengri ancestors at all. Still, our propagandists can spin tales using these new artifacts to inspire the people."
 eurasianism.46.a: "History is quite flexible."

 eurasianism.47.t: "Project Far Flung: Failure"
 eurasianism.47.d: "The villains in Saigon denied us permission to excavate sites of great significance in their country. Their diplomats labeled our State as 'reactionary' and our scientists 'an embarrassment to the field of archeology'."
 eurasianism.47.a: "We will have to search elsewhere."

 eurasianism.48.t: "Project Brutus"
 eurasianism.48.d: "It is not enough to convince our own people of their greatness. For Eurasia to ascend to the place of global power, it must prove the inferiority of all other cultures. The Romano-Germanics are, without a doubt, the greatest threat to our young State. However, mere propaganda will not beat them. It is necessary to apply social pressure upon the peoples of Western Europe.\n\nThe Italians style themselves 'cultured' and 'civilized'. They display blasphemous works in museums, wrecking the minds of their peasants. Our intelligence has taken initiative by hiring a former mercenary: they will be equipped with a makeshift bomb and sent to Rome, where they will attempt to stage an attack on the Colosseum - the symbol of Roman culture."
 eurasianism.48.a: "Authorized."

 eurasianism.49.t: "Bombing near the Colosseum!"
 eurasianism.49.d: "A tragedy has occurred today, as an explosion rocked Rome by the Colosseum. While the motives behind this gruesome attack are still yet to be seen, the police have already identified a suspect, a man of Caucasian descent in his mid 30s who arrived in Rome by air fare with a fake passport and suitcase not one week ago.\n\nPolice, retracing the suspect's steps, found that he had rented a motel on the city's outskirts for a night before heading out to the Colosseum the following day. Tourists reported seeing the man plant the suitcase on a sidewalk bench by the famous Italian monument, before rapidly sprinting away. Police had little time to react before the bomb detonated, killing two and wounding twelve others.\n\nA citywide manhunt has begun in search of the perpetrator, and police assure us that the man will be found soon, and that citizens should take care to report any suspicious persons. The terrorist's identity, place of origin, or the purpose of his attack are still unknown at this time."
 eurasianism.49.a: "A tragedy."

 eurasianism.50.t: "Project Brutus: Partial Success"
 eurasianism.50.d: "The operative successfully traveled to Rome, bypassing customs and local authorities. A complete bomb could not be smuggled due to tightened security, so the agent took up residence in a hotel. Before the trip, they were trained on the construction of explosives - one was hastily forged, a small bomb with a three-minute timer.\n\nThe agent got to the Colosseum before being pursued by the police, who had likely monitored them. Although we are not sure of the details, it can be surmised that the agent initiated the timer and ran towards the structure, but exploded before he could deal significant damage.\n\nLocal authorities have blamed the chaos on a gas leak, but even official casualties exceed a dozen people. We have failed to destroy the Colosseum, but have dealt a blow to Romano-Germanic morale."
 eurasianism.50.a: "A life well spent."

 eurasianism.51.t: "Rome Bombing Prevented!"
 eurasianism.51.d: "Tragedy has been averted today, as the brave policemen of Rome pursued a would-be terrorist. The man, reported to be in his mid 30's and of Caucasian descent, arrived in Rome on a plane last week. Passengers claim he only brought a suitcase, but customs report that no such man passed by that day. It seems he avoided our security systems, and got inside Rome itself.\n\nFurther investigation revealed his residence: a cheap motel in the outskirts of the city. A tourist reported seeing the terrorist approach the Colosseum with the suitcase, and withdraw a bomb.\n\nThe police were quick to respond. A chase ensued (see Channel 5), where the perpetrator fled outside city limits. Taking refuge in an empty farmstead, he denoted the device on himself rather than face capture. The would-be terrorist's identity, place of origin, or the purpose of his failed attack are still unknown."
 eurasianism.51.a: "A close call."
 
 eurasianism.52.t: "Project Brutus: Failure"
 eurasianism.52.d: "The specifics of our latest mission to Rome are unclear, but it seems the mercenary we hired to destroy the Colosseum has failed. Official reports speak of a terrorist caught trying to smuggle a bomb into the ancient city, resulting in a chase across the streets. After being surrounded, the agent activated their device rather than surrendering. Only minimal damage was inflicted upon law enforcement personnel. Intelligence claims the Romans have tightened their airport security, making similar missions impossible in the foreseeable future."

 eurasianism.56.t: "Academia Challenges Gumilyov"
 eurasianism.56.d: ""The bastards," Gumilyov swore as he read the paper. Some scientists, in a futile effort to defend their so-called 'honor' denounced Eurasia! He wondered where their brains were. Of course Eurasia was Russia's ultimate destiny. "How can they be so blind, ignorant of history!"\n\nHe turned to the fireplace and contemplated burning the challenge altogether. The request for a 'civil debate' was an obvious jab at his credibility, a cowardly move to undo that for which millions died. "The weak cannot be allowed to slay Eurasia, not now, when we are so close!"\n\nBut a thought floated into Lev's brain, and for a moment he hesitated. "No point in lying to yourself." He knew that Eurasia might as well be a newborn concept. Although the military and government swore allegiance to him, the peasants were still doubtful. "Perhaps we can make use of this opportunity." Lev fell back in his chair: "If, hypothetically, my side was to win these debates, it would entrench the concept..." But the fire burned so brightly and the secret police were only a call away..."

 eurasianism.56.b: "Those professors forget their place."

 eurasianism.57.t: "Challenge Accepted"
 eurasianism.57.d: "The hall quieted down as Gumilyov, flanked by four bodyguards, entered. The eyes of ancient professors and fearful students all fell upon him. A frail old man, dressed in pre-war formal attire, beckoned his leader to the stage. A court-like podium had been erected - twelve chairs for each side, spaced out equally in the middle of the hall so that hundreds may observe the struggle for Russia's soul.\n\nTaking the front seat, Lev observed his 'side'. A collection of 'academics' (mostly officers he had promoted), some students with too many ideas for their age, and two professors from time immemorial.\n\nOn the other side, all respected historians, geologists, sociologists and, at their head (and writer of the letter), Alexander Nekrich. Gumilyov barely contained his rage: "Stupid pigs. They dress in fancy suits and study each other's propaganda. Poor excuses for true historians."\n\nA crowd of three hundred assembled around them and on the balconies above. However, one thing was yet to be decided: the judges.\n\n"Lev Nikolayevich," began Nekrich, "we have selected five judges from our ranks. We assure you that they are without bias and will treat both sides fairly." He pointed to five professors sitting apart from the crowd. Gumilyov expected nominations to happen there and then, his mind scrambled to identify somebody on his side."
 eurasianism.57.a: "They won't hold a candle to superior Eurasian will!"
 eurasianism.57.b: "'Actually, I had some other men in mind...'"
 eurasianism.57.c: "Try to bribe the judges during break."

 eurasianism.58.t: "Eurasian Statement"
 eurasianism.58.d: "Gumilyov took the podium first, addressing the crowd: "For centuries, Russia has suffered defeat after defeat! From Napoleon's campaign to the recent world wars, the spirit of both Tsar and worker failed to save the people. The last three decades are testaments to the inadequacies of conventional geopolitics, so I propose a solution: Eurasia."\n\n"My colleagues and I have recovered and studied texts, artifacts, tales and natural evidence from a time when our Tengri ancestors roamed the steppes. During their rule, all peoples prospered. Russians, Kazakhs, Tatars, Europeans, too many to count! The recent successes of our regime are a testament to the righteous path on which we walk."\n\n"I believe that Eurasia is the best choice for the peoples of Russia, based on recent history, archaeological evidence, and scientific findings. Firstly, I shall make the case for an ancient Eurasia - that, in centuries past, life was better than it is now. I present:""
 eurasianism.58.a: "The accounts of Slavic monks detailing Eurasian rule."
 eurasianism.58.b: "Archaeological evidence linking the peoples of Eurasia."
 eurasianism.58.c: "A clarification on what it means to be a true Tengrist."
 eurasianism.58.e: "One of my papers explaining the Eurasian spirit."

 eurasianism.59.t: "Opposition Statement"
 eurasianism.59.d: "Gumilyov felt his heart race as Nekrich took the podium. The crowd seemed more receptive of him: They smiled at his wave, and applause from the back encouraged him. "My friends! Is it not true that Russia is a great nation? Is it not true that, before the war, we were at the forefront of science, industry, art? Can any man here deny that they want to see their friends prosper? The old geopolitical views worked because they were sane - they advocated for a strong central authority, for a country by Russians for Russians. It is only out of necessity that we serviced the Tatar, it is out of misfortune that we lost so much so quickly. I am here to argue that Eurasia is a death trap, that, based on the incompetence of its leader and misunderstanding of real-world politics, the very idea is quite horrid."\n\n"I bring to light the last several years. Gumilyov's regime, acting explicitly to restore Eurasia, has executed hundreds and committed unspeakable horrors upon respectable enemies. My colleagues have already published a paper listing the injustices of the current regime. If it is allowed to survive, I fear we may be the last generation of true Russians.""
 eurasianism.59.a: "Should've shot that bastard when I had the chance."

 eurasianism.60.t: "Eurasian Argument"
 eurasianism.60.d: "Gumilyov returned to center stage and forced a smile. The crowd did not cheer, and he thought he spotted looks of disgust on some faces. Sighing, he continued: "My opponent has yet to come up with a single thing that the old Russia did right. The Tsars enslaved their subjects, imposed cruel taxes and fought in wars they couldn't possibly win, just to resolve petty disputes among nobles. The Soviets were little better: the Reds slaughtered all who disagreed with them, tried to destroy nature itself, and for what? So that the Romano-Germanics could take it all away?"\n\n"The Russian people will never achieve anything by themselves. Only when the children of the steppes unite, will they see the light of day. My government exists to facilitate that unification. We do not squabble over resources that all can share, we do not appease dissidents, we are the descendants of the greatest people to ever exist!"\n\n"The current regime is but a small peek into the future. Does anybody regret fighting for Eurasia? We, who have overcome the Reds, monarchists, traitors and Finns, shall rise again. Look at what we have accomplished in the last few years!""
 eurasianism.60.a: "Eurasia gave you prosperity!"
 eurasianism.60.b: "Eurasia gave you honor!"
 eurasianism.60.c: "Eurasia gave you glory!"
 eurasianism.60.e: "Eurasia gave you knowledge!"
 eurasianism.60.f: "Eurasia gave you northern lands back!"

 eurasianism.61.t: "Opposition Argument"
 eurasianism.61.d: "Nekrich retook the stadium, smirking as he passed by his leader. The crowd let out a weak cheer. He continued: "What my opponent fails to understand is that his system has been tested, and failed. I don't think there is anybody left in Russia, even within monarchist circles, who believes that a fully autocratic nobility means prosperity. And what of sustainability?" he turned to Gumilyov.\n\n"How will you run the state if your people are all slaves? How can you, in a conscious and sound mind, advocate for a pagan faith from the Gobi Desert? Why, Eurasia wouldn't even be able to reclaim the lost Motherland! Its army would be too busy riding horses around to realize what a rifle is!" The crowd broke into laughter. "Eurasia's victory against the other warlords was simply a tactical blunder on their part. There were many times when our weak state could have been overrun, saved by pure chance. Why should we fix what isn't broken? Look at history! Capitalism, representation, even socialism worked to an extent! How is some archaic parody of a country supposed to bring about prosperity for its people?""
 eurasianism.61.a: "And all the academics too."
 
 eurasianism.62.t: "Eurasian Rebuttal"
 eurasianism.62.d: "The debate resumed after a hostile break. Two fistfights broke out in the careferia, a full riot was stopped only by the bell. Gumilyov knew his position was weak. Even if he were to win the intellectual battle, few peasants were smart enough to look past the 'outlandishness' of his rightful ideology.\n\nSo, once everyone returned to position, he continued: "Critics of Eurasia can only blabber on about 'sustainability' and buried ideologies. However, they are wrong. The peoples of Eurasia are the strongest in the Universe, for they have each other. The blood of the Mongols courses through our veins... we are heirs to a great legacy."\n\n"These men who call themselves 'intellectuals' are blind to your struggles! They sit behind wealth, in rusted buildings, surrounded by outdated concepts. Hear me! Do you not wish for a greater meaning? Is there not a person here who will shy away from destiny itself? When life knocks, beckoning us to the past, through which we may have the future, will be shy away from the challenge, retreating to the comfort of history? A New Order calls us, to upturn the world and throw the yoke of the steppe upon those who did us wrong. The future awaits!""
 eurasianism.62.a: "Eurasia will lead us back to Moscow!"
 eurasianism.62.b: "We shall shed the chains that bind us!"
 eurasianism.62.c: "Onwards! For our Tengri ancestors!"
 eurasianism.62.e: "We will make our steppe forefathers proud!"

 eurasianism.63.t: "Disorder in the Court!"
 eurasianism.63.d: "Gumilyov finished his statement, but before he could make it back to the chair, something hit him in the head. Quickly, he looked down to see a small stone. The hall descended into chaos, guards rushed against the mass of humanity. Angry yelling broke into cries of battle. "For Eurasia!" yelled some brute as he picked up and threw an old man at the woman next to him. Puffs of smoke rose up as Gumilyov dodged more stones. The opposition, distressed, chose to retreat. His 'teammates' gave chase, before a bodyguard arrived to evacuate the leader.\n\nBy the end of the day, half of the university had burnt down and fifty people were injured. The next day, Gumilyov received a protest from Nekrich, accusing his men of 'facilitating a raid'. He demanded that Gumilyov return tomorrow to finish the debate."
 eurasianism.63.a: ""I didn't order those attackers!""
 eurasianism.63.b: "Write a formal apology to all those involved."
 eurasianism.63.c: "Accuse the opposition of staging the raid."

 eurasianism.64.t: "Opposition Rebuttal"
 eurasianism.64.d: "The hall was a shell of its former self. A large hole now decorated the ceiling, the remains of two balconies littered the floor. A new, hastily erected podium stood before some eighty people. The opposition was half their original number, the judges seemed worn out, one had a nasty bruise around the left eye.\n\nNekrich menacingly eyed Gumilyov as he continued last day's speech: "... and for these reasons, my opposition's argument is null and void." The debate was over, the judges retreated to decide the victor..."
 eurasianism.64.a: "And the winner is..."

 eurasianism.65.t: "Eurasian Victory!"
 eurasianism.65.d: "Gumilyov couldn't believe it. He had won. The opposition, stunned, stormed out of the hall upon hearing the judges' final decision. Apparently, a string of superior evidence and compelling arguments had completely swung the faith of the people. Eurasia shall no longer be an oppressive spectre that hangs over the steppes. Its people have seen reason, the idols of history have been smashed, and ahead: The future!"
 eurasianism.65.a: "Binding the continents."

 eurasianism.66.t: "Stalemate!"
 eurasianism.66.d: "Both sides stood in silence as the judges eyed each other. Although the fifth judge was technically the tie-breaker, either the reasoning of both sides or yesterday's events made him reconsider whatever decision he had previously made. Refusing to name a winner, the two sides stormed off.\n\nReturning home, Gumilyov breathed a sigh of relief. He had expected the academics to berate him, to demand more time-wasting arguments, but they remained silence. "Many will take this silence as defeat on their part." He considered. "At least for now the concept is secure. It has withstood both war and scrutiny.""
 eurasianism.66.a: "A hundred years to Eurasia!"

 eurasianism.67.t: "Eurasia Loses!"
 eurasianism.67.d: "The taste of defeat is always bitter. But at least Gumilyov retained his supporter base. The opposition walked away triumphant, but only by a slim margin. Gumilyov retired to his home for the day, he had a lot of work to do. The minor academics must be purged, the untouchables discredited, the concept rebuilt piece by piece..."
 eurasianism.67.a: "A dream delayed."

 eurasianism.68.t: "Eurasia Defeated!"
 eurasianism.68.d: "A cheer came from the crowd as the judges made their final decision. Despite all the hard work, the debate had not gone in Gumilyov's favor at all. Nekrich walked away the victor, smiling at his colleagues and mocking the opponent. Former supporters defected to the other side, the concept was shattered. A dream unlived, thrown to the wolves, it will be years until the people are ready to even consider accepting Eurasian philosophy."
 eurasianism.68.a: "A dream falls."

 eurasianism.69.t: "Eurasia Routed!"
 eurasianism.69.d: "The crowd broke into a cheer, swarming around Nekrich and his vile supporters. Gumilyov was cast aside by his own people, a dream thrown to the curbside. His supporters quickly evicted the building, himself escorted by bodyguards.\n\nCome night, Ust-Sysolsk was in flames. Riots had broken out all across the nation, spurred on by the defeat of their 'oppressors'. The garrisons themselves began to doubt their cause, and high-ranking rightists remained silent on the matter. The government will have to be purged, and the dream may never be recovered."
 eurasianism.69.a: "A dream dies."

 eurasianism.70.t: "Eurasia Teeters"
 eurasianism.70.d: "Gumilyov sat in his bunker, its ceiling shook as shells exploded above. His shaking fingers could barely keep hold of the spoon in his hand as he feasted upon canned beans. The guards had failed him, and Ust-Sysolsk fell to the anarchists. They burned Eurasian flags at first, in the streets, then it turned into violence. Homes were razed, businesses raided, policemen killed in cold blood. The local garrison declined to intervene, and had soon joined the rioters.\n\nSuddenly, the door to the bunker cracked open, but before Gumilyov had a chance to unholster his pistol, a friendly face appeared. The garrison of Vyatka had finally arrived to relieve the city's siege. They handed their leader a cover sheet and escorted him above ground. For the first time in a week, Gumilyov's eyes met the sun's rays. Ust-Sysolsk was in rubble. Smoke bellowed from ruins, they stretched to the horizon, trees had turned into trunks below a gray sky.\n\n'The rebels have been rounded up. It's over.' proudly announced the commander. But Gumilyov fell to his knees as he observed the carnage. 'So much work', he thought, 'all for nothing'. They will never accept Eurasia. 'Even if we win, it will be through fear. Oh, may the Heavens have mercy. The spirit is dead, the corpse of the New Order thrown into the pit.'"
 eurasianism.70.a: "A dream unseen."

 eurasianism.71.t: "Eurasia Survives"
 eurasianism.71.d: "While our campaign hasn't borne significant fruit, at least the general opinion has not swung against us. Overall, the entire Dream was a waste of funds we desperately needed, and has greatly embarrassed the government."
 eurasianism.71.a: "One day."
 
 eurasianism.72.t: "Eurasia Stands"
 eurasianism.72.d: "The grand project has achieved mixed results. Polls show an increase in faith in our government, but there is still much work to be done. Ultimately though, unnecessary projects diverted funding needed elsewhere."
 eurasianism.72.a: "We tried."
 
 eurasianism.73.t: "Eurasia Thrives"
 eurasianism.73.d: "The grand project has borne fruit. The general opinion has swung in favor of Eurasia for the first time since its foundation. Though there is still much work to be done, we can confidently advance into the east and west without fear of an internal uprising."
 eurasianism.73.a: "Russia today - Eurasia tomorrow!"
 
 eurasianism.74.t: "Eurasia Soars"
 eurasianism.74.d: "Success! Polls are showing faith in our government going up across the board! The peasants now have a future to look forward to, our international and academic critics watch in silence as everything they had ever stood for is washed away by the unity of our State. The future lies in the East and in Moscow!"
 eurasianism.74.a: "Onwards!"

 eurasianism.100.t: "The Eurasian Dream"
 eurasianism.100.d: "Gumilyov was confused by the report. The most recent poll in Ust-Sysolsk, the birthplace of modern Eurasia, showed that less than 40% of its inhabitants supported their current regime. The past eight months were filled with constant purges and police crackdowns, but every leader knows when too much is too much.\n\nObviously, Gumilyov could not sit around with his arms folded. "Something must be done. If brute force can't suppress the people, we will have to play upon their minds... yes!" He assembled the high government, laying down proposal after proposal: "Don't you see, gentlemen!" he announced, "We must justify the concept to the people! How can we expect the peasants to work for a cause they know nothing about?"\n\n"But how shall this be done?" asked the economic minister.\n\n"Easy." Gumilyov brought out a map of the Eurasian continent, "We must send out expeditions across true Eurasia, to justify our righteous cause. It will not be easy, but failure here will mean the destruction of an ideology, an ideology that holds true salvation for us all. Let us not delay, gentlemen.""
 eurasianism.100.a: "Like the Khan, we will ride!"
