 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_GUTRUM_VAGNER_DESC: "The enfant terrible of Western Russia, Alexey Alexandrovich Dobrovolsky had an unremarkable background. The hardships suffered by his family in a collapsing Soviet Union left him with little opportunities, but like his peers, he was taught the superiority of socialist doctrine.\n\nYet as a conscript in the West Russian Revolutionary War, he saw the Red Army being slaughtered by a far stronger foe, and could not help but to be dazzled by the might of the Aryan sword. Deserting with a few others to the woods of Perm, he devoted himself to the search for truth, for the reason why the German legions had destroyed the Soviet state, and subjugated the Slavic tribe.\n\nHe found his answer in Russian history, when Peter the Great had traveled Europe, and then forced the people to embrace a more civilized culture upon his return. It was clear that the true meaning of the Aryan spirit was not in race - but in mind. With this revelation, he adopted the Aryan name Gutrum Vagner, proclaimed himself Fyurer of the Aryan Brotherhood and declared Perm a site of Aryan revival. Now leading one of the most fearsome forces in Russia, Vagner seeks to return Russia to the cradle of the Aryan civilization."
 
 POLITICS_VALERY_YEMELYANOV_DESC: "Peering inside the thoughts of Valery Nikolaevich Yemelyanov, one would see visions of a glorious past where Aryans ruled the forests and steppes of the Hyperborean Rus. But the Jew and his Asiatic minions took their land through diabolical machinations, their heritage through Christian indoctrination, and their past through historical revision. For centuries, the Aryans' Slavic descendants wandered blindly through the darkness. But eventually, there were those who rediscovered the lost truths. They understood what had been taken from them and what must be done to guide their race back into the light and reclaim their birthright of blood!\n\nBut Yemelyanov knew he could never survive on his own. He found an ally in Gutrum Vagner, a lunatic who possessed a sliver of truth buried beneath a heap of delusion. Vagner believed that not only were the German mongrels Aryans, but also Aryanism was a mental state one could achieve if they believed hard enough! Idiotic though he was, he created a fertile ground for the truth to take root. So Yemelyanov bided his time, cloaked in the name and uniform of a racial inferior, until he and his many followers reached the time to strike. Vagner and his band of madmen are now dead, and their blood shall purge their taint from the soil. Taking the title of High Priest Velimir, Yemelyanov has pledged to lead the Aryans in the reconquest of their ancestral homelands. And when all of the Hyperborean Rus has been united beneath the symbol of the holy swastika, Svarog will smile upon His people and His priest!"

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_MEDVEDEV_DESC: "The distaste of Onega's Guard for fascists is equal - if not greater - to that for communists, and that is especially true for a cult as horrendous as the Aryan Brotherhood, that for years was a taint on the city of Perm and beyond. However, there was one man who promised to make it all disappear: Alexander Egorovich Medvedev, a lumberjack and a war hero.\n\nAfter fighting his way from the fields of Ukraine back to his beloved homeland near Perm, he was determined to live a quiet life, but the circumstances forced him to do otherwise. A vile force had appeared in the city, and Medvedev took up arms to fight it. For years, he and his band fought in the outskirts of Perm against the Russian Nazis, but their salvation came with the arrival of the Onega Guard, who saw his value as a satellite to the North Russian Republic.\n\nMedvedev now rules benevolently as warlord and leader of the Anti-Fascist Committee in the area, unwilling to stop until every hint of the Brotherhood's existence and every one of its supporters is gone."

 ### Ideas ###
 PRM_aryan_cult: "Aryan Cult"
 PRM_aryan_cult_desc: "The so-called Aryans have brought down the millenarian Motherland... but our neighbors are fools if they believe that they, the so-called Untermenshen, are capable of casting down this enemy. Clearly, they have proven themselves superior to us in all regards... and if you cannot beat them, join them. We will make ourselves into Aryans, and as the Aryans have proven themselves superior over the Russian, so shall we as Aryans prevail over our inferiors and join the Reykh as rulers."
 PRM_aryan_cult_full_aryan: "Aryan Cult - Fully Aryan Military"
 PRM_aryan_cult_full_aryan_desc: "The fate of the Aryan race will not be dictated by the weekly, feeble minded Untermensh, but by the true might that once shook this land to the core, the true might of the superior race. We shall instill fear and terror in the vermin in this land, but this time...\n\nThey will have nowhere to run."
 PRM_aryan_cult_non_aryan: "Aryan Cult - Non-Aryan Military"
 PRM_aryan_cult_non_aryan_desc: "The Untermensh's fate is to serve their betters in every aspect, and their lives are of inherent less value. Instead of putting brave and irreplaceable Aryan lives to risk dying against the rabble, we will put them in officers and commanding chains, to guide our slaves to fight instead. They should be glad that we're letting them die for something meaningful for once in their unremarkable existence."
 PRM_amateur_Geshtapo: "Amateur Geshtapo"
 PRM_amateur_Geshtapo_desc: "In our studies to learn what we can of the Reykh and their methods, we have attempted to recreate their noble peace forces for ourselves. The Aryan rule will spread from East to West, and the inferiors will learn their place in our land."
 PRM_heart_of_an_aryan: "Heart of an Aryan"
 PRM_heart_of_an_aryan_desc: "The Aryans are the perfect species, with hearts filled with hate for our enemies and bodies capable of overwhelming them all. But above all, a duty. A duty to conquer, to rule, and to command all that lies beneath it.\nWe will not shy from the duty we were sworn to the world to."
 PRM_disciplined_raiders: "Disciplined Raiders"
 PRM_disciplined_raiders_desc: "Terror isn't a butcher's job, but a hunter. Like one, we lie in wait, our weapons draw, while we wait our prey to reach our scope, breathe held, to lull them in a false sense of security.\nBy the time they realize something is wrong on their idyllic, pathetic existence, it will be too late."
 PRM_autonomous_raiders: "Autonomous Raiders"
 PRM_autonomous_raiders_desc: "Terror isn't about how hard you bleed your enemies, but how many wounds they're bleeding for. If we let them rest, if even for a moment, they can recover, and create delusions of survival. Our armies will not give them a single inch of rest, until they're nothing but ruins trampling down our feet."
 PRM_aryan_control_5: "Aryan Control - Monolithic"
 PRM_aryan_control_5_desc: "The Untermensh can't help but look to the ground, in fear and pain at our radiance. Our control is absolute in every single aspect of our society, and they know. Russia will finally be back at the hands of the people it truly belongs, and nothing will stop our natural manifest shape into reality."
 PRM_aryan_control_4: "Aryan Control - Extreme"
 PRM_aryan_control_4_desc: "Small pockets of resistance are to be seen, but those don't bring us as much trouble as they used to. The Untermensh are learning their place in our society, and as long as we keep pressing the jackboots against their throat, eventually these delusions of freedom will sputter to darkness."
 PRM_aryan_control_3: "Aryan Control - Loose"
 PRM_aryan_control_3_desc: "Communications between our many brothers, and resistance to our rule is still present, even if manageable for now. While we have nothing to fear from rats scurrying about, if our aspirations to conquer this savage land are to shape into reality, we must ascertain our control, lest the situation escape our control."
 PRM_aryan_control_2: "Aryan Control - Minimal"
 PRM_aryan_control_2_desc: "Our brothers are pinned by the Untermensh, and chaos reigns through our chain of command. The Aryan right is one of dominance, and we cannot let vermin dictate their whims! Our actions must be decisive, to reascertain our control, lest we fail not only our brothers at Perm, but our kin in the west." 
 PRM_aryan_control_1: "Aryan Control - Nonexistent"
 PRM_aryan_control_1_desc: "We've failed. Our brothers lay dead or spread across our land, like headless chickens, and the Untermensh march ever closed to our strongholds. Our enemies at our borders noticed our moment of weakness, and will soon strike us, despite our best efforts; we've failed our kin west, and we've failed our Aryan duty."
 PRM_forced_labor: "Unwilling Labor Force"
 PRM_forced_labor_desc: "Living is a privilege, and the slaves are to be reminded of that. Their reward for work, is the right to be able to be alive tomorrow, to work more. If they complain, we can simply correct them by the way of lead."
 PRM_free_labor: "Willing Labor Force"
 PRM_free_labor_desc: "Aryan or not, hunger affects us all. While we have no sympathy for the lessers toiling for us, as it is their sworn obligation by race, the fact is they are useless to us if they die of hunger. So by offering them food equivalent to their work, not only will they work harder to be rewarded more, but their loyalty to us will increase. After all, like a dog, they know what happens if they bite the hand that feeds them."
 PRM_rebuilding_industry: "Rebuilt Industry"
 PRM_rebuilding_industry_desc: "Berlin wasn't built in a day, and our empire will need many, if it is to one day rejoin with our kin west. Our industry will spill columns of black smoke, and our industry will forge the sword that will hang over the weaker races across Russia."
 PRM_revitalized_industry: "Revitalized Industry"
 PRM_revitalized_industry_desc: "Like a veil of smog, Perm became the beating heart of our land. Like blood, it pumps the weapons of the Aryan warriors through the land, to cast the Untermensh back to where it belongs: bound in chains, toiling for us in the factories." 
 PRM_true_aryans: "Pure Aryanism"
 PRM_true_aryans_desc: "We've tolerated the meangering of for long enough. Shultz's betrayal finally revealed to us how insiduous and deep the machinations of the Jew spreads, to reach for the desperate, traitorous kin with our land.

 PRM_our_own_army: "A Slavic-Aryan Spirit"
 PRM_our_own_army_desc: "An Aryan mind does not entirely limit itself to its own tried and true traditions, sometimes it requires adaptation in order for its ideal to survive. Combining German tactics with our own Slavic characteristics will pave the way forward for our superior race."
 PRM_our_own_army2: "A Slavic-Aryan Tenacity"
 PRM_our_own_army2_desc: "Combat shapes the form of the perfect Aryan soldier, Slavo-Aryan tactics have proven itself reliable, and our superior army are no longer so just in name. We are survivors, predators, strong and tenacious. We will defeat everyone inferior to our might."
 PRM_our_own_army3: "A Slavic-Aryan Army"

 PRM_untermensch_army: "Untermenshen in the Army"
 PRM_untermensch_army_desc: "The Untermensh are perfect, in a sense that they serve their purpose as subhumans to become fodder for enemy gunfire to forward the goals of the superior Aryan race. They are disposable, cheap, and fully subservient to our cause. Unfortunately, this means that our army becomes impure, and defects could be seen here and there."
 PRM_hordes_of_the_faithful: "An Army of the Faithful"
 PRM_hordes_of_the_faithful_desc: "In the euphoria of the Hyperborean spirit, thousands of men have lined up to serve their state in the face of the many conflicts ahead.

 PRM_goad_unbelievers2_desc: "Our efforts to cleanse the unbelievers have been, for the most part, successful. They now understand their purpose under our heel, and they shall retaliate no more. The Aryan Race marches to glory, to the future of a world free of the Untermensh."

 PRM_work_for_your_life_idea_desc: "The purpose of the subhumans is to serve the superior Aryan race. This is no longer just a mantra, but a manifestation in our industry. For the rest of their lifes, they shall toil in the mines and in the factories for the sake of the Brotherhood."
 PRM_soviet_scientists_purged: "Soviet Scientists Purged"
 PRM_aryan_schematics: "Aryan Schematics"
 PRM_aryan_schematics_desc: "In order to rise above the drudges of the Slavic subhumans and their backwardness, the Brotherhood has started several initiatives to replicate Germany's awe-inspiring successes in industry, science and weaponry. Luckily for us, there are plenty of leftover equipment from the German collaborators in the West Russian War that our technicians can study. While this necessitates casting away the "fruits" of Bolshevik "science", it means that we may one day match the feats of German engineering - the greatest in the world."
 PRM_aryan_pantsers: "Pantser Warfare"
 PRM_aryan_pantsers_desc: "Who would dare deny that the Aryan's natural talent for mechanized conquest is anything but a matter of course? Truly, as our Brotherhood extends it's iron grip over western Russia, so to does the Aryan master his strength of will over the machines of war, and following the capture of the Tank Factory at Gorky, the Brotherhood has with it the means to embody the spirit of its comrades in Germania; let the roar of the iron steed thunder across the forest as the Fyurer's ambition is made manifest!"

 ##Initial Tree##

 PRM_AB_initial_beneath_cross: "Beneath the Hooked Cross" 
 PRM_AB_initial_beneath_cross_desc: "It is a sad fact that we stand far below our German masters. They rule over an empire that spans half of Europe; we barely rule over the city of Permhaym and its surroundings. As far as we know, they likely either have no knowledge or are only vaguely aware of us. If we are to be loyal servants of the Reykh, we must start by consolidating our control over the territories under our control and building the institutions of a proud Germanic nation.\n\nEvery aspect of the state needs to be molded according to Brotherhood doctrine. We need more Aryans to run the government and military and more laborers and slaves to work our factories. Our ideology needs to be clarified and applied to every part of life. With enough time and effort, we can build a nation that the Germans would be proud to witness."

 #Aryanism Tree#
 PRM_AB_initial_bolstering_ranks: "Bolstering Our Ranks"
 PRM_AB_initial_bolstering_ranks_desc: "Though it is a fact borne out of its definition, the Aryan is within but a few of us. We acknowledge this sad, perhaps inconvenient truth, that the lesser peoples have no place among our ranks. We look toward Germany with not only admiration, but also envy; with so many of the chosen people, their continent-spanning empire is destined to be eternal, and without equal. In the vastness of Russia, in its lands and its folk, we are but a mere mote of dust.\n\nThis situation must be rectified. Though they may be rare, there are Russians, just like ourselves, who are worthy, in blood and deed, to become one of us and ascend. However, these will not come to us, befitting their worth, and we must seek them out. In the silence of the night, when the bombers die down, we shall search for them. We shall take them, forcibly if needed, for the blood yearns to rejoin with its kin."

 PRM_AB_initial_role_race: "The Role of Our Race"
 PRM_AB_initial_role_race_desc: "The German bombers fly over our skies, the swastika proudly emblazoned on both of its wings. Beautiful, airborne teachers that instruct the lesser peoples to know their place: that they find us unequal is no surprise. However, despite the fact of our apparent superiority to the Untermensh, we are no closer to reaching the heights of our brethren in Germany. Instead, we wander, not knowing what path to pursue to enlighten ourselves.\n\nIn our current state, the Fyurer, the godly and divine being that commands the Germans, will look at us in contempt, silent. To him, we are no different from the Russians, our perfection in being useless without guidance and destiny. He, like the planes above, offers no counsel nor advice. However, where he quietens, we must speak; the Brotherhood shall gather, and all the words said shall pave the road that we must walk."

 PRM_AB_initial_warrior_caste: "A Warrior Caste"
 PRM_AB_initial_warrior_caste_desc: "The Nordics of the ancient ages celebrated their warriors. They molded their society following the will of their gods: to fight, to win, to triumph. When they die in battle, the Valkyries descend and choose from among the dead those that prove themselves to be Odin's own. Their obedience to their blood rewarded them with lands, loot, power, and, above all, victory. Theirs was an ideal existence, unhampered by such pedestrian concerns as survival.\n\nTo become worthy of the Fyurer and the Germans, we will emulate these Vikings, in their myths and legends. The Aryans of Russia shall make battlefields their home, fighting from the frontlines, finding worthy death as an end. War shall choose who among us is true, pure, and righteous. No more shall the chosen people be held back from its true destiny as the great warriors of the dawning age."

 PRM_AB_initial_overseer_caste: "An Overseer Caste"
 PRM_AB_initial_overseer_caste_desc: "The Persians of old, contemporaries of the Greeks, were Aryans in the purest sense. They were the people that etched their name upon our race, the forefathers that began the great awakening of our kind. Yet, for all their fame and power, they seldom fought in the fields of battle, preferring to lord over lesser peoples who would do their fighting for them. Their Empire spanned their from homeland, to the lands of the Jews and Arabs, into Anatolia, before being finally broken in Greece, the home of another chosen people.\n\nWe wish to follow in their example. From now on, we shall only reluctantly fight, for the numbers of the Brotherhood are thin as it is. The people of Russia shall serve their new, better masters. Instead of warriors, we shall become overseers, and upon the shoulders of the Untermensh shall stand another empire, one stronger, greater than the old."

 PRM_AB_initial_multilevel_warcrimes: "Proof by Deed"
 PRM_AB_initial_multilevel_warcrimes_desc: "Aryanism is strength, and thus only the strong are capable of being true Aryans - this is the maxim we must live by if our nation is to avoid sinking into degeneracy. Separating the Master Race from the subhumans is therefore of paramount importance, and to achieve this end we have developed an elaborate test of resolve.\n\nAnyone who can demonstrate their ability to kill or capture at least five people will have amply shown that they are fit to walk among us. Already we have discovered several dozen of the worthy using this method, some of whom were busy proving their Aryaness well before we even rose to power. Henceforth all prisoners we capture deemed potentially suitable will be administered this test. If they pass, they will be permitted to join our ranks; if not, we will treat them as we do the rest of the subhumans."

 PRM_AB_initial_ubermensch: "The Ubermensh March to War"
 PRM_AB_initial_ubermensch_desc: "The formation of our elite fighting units is proceeding smoothly. We have extensively studied the methods and tactics of our brother Aryans in Germany and used them as a basis for the formation of the greatest military force Russia will ever see. For every one of our soldiers that falls in a blaze of glory, he will take a hundred subhumans with him. Our commanders will read works written by the likes of Guderian and Halder in the original German, following their infallible examples of tactical prowess.\n\nOur squads, too, are organized along German lines. The machine gun will be its center, and therefore only the most Aryan will be selected to wield it. Stimulants manufactured by only the finest chemists in our territory will be issued to push our troops beyond their natural limits, for even the Master Race is subject to those. Soon our army will be able to rival even the SS!"

 PRM_AB_initial_ubermensch_2: "An Army of the Pure"
 PRM_AB_initial_ubermensch_2_desc: "The Aryan military that will prove to be the salvation of Russia grows stronger by the day. In particular, the large number of training accidents that have recently occurred have proven to be a great boon, further weeding our forces of the weak.\n\nMore reforms are still necessary, however, if we wish for our troops to achieve their full potential. Our commanders have yet to be trained in large unit tactics, an issue that can be quickly rectified by further study of the Vermakht's geniuses. There is also the question of strategy, but this is less important. All the Master Race needs do is win battles and they will be able to live off the land just fine, and so little attention will be paid to unnecessary inconveniences like logistics companies."

 PRM_AB_initial_untermensch: "Guide the Untermensh"
 PRM_AB_initial_untermensch_desc: "The Aryan was made to rule, and our army will reflect this natural state of being. We will enlist the subservient races to do the bidding of their superiors, both to minimize our losses and to reduce the number of subhumans present in the world. We will dispatch recruiting parties throughout our territory begin the enlistment of this fodder. Resistance from the populace is to be expected at first, but eventually they will give in to their servile instincts - especially after we've made examples of their friends and families.\n\nSoon we will have a horde of attack dogs waiting at the beck and call of their owners, ready to be unleashed on our enemies. A few have raised concerns about the idea of arming our slaves with weapons, but these are baseless worries. Any unruliness within the ranks will be dealt with quickly and efficiently, and any revolts will be put down by more loyal units."

 PRM_AB_initial_untermensch_2: "By Hook or by Crook"
 PRM_AB_initial_untermensch_2_desc: "The subhuman is naturally obedient and docile, but there will always be a few who have within their heads delusional ideas of rebellion. We must eliminate these troublemakers from our military and make sure their absurd ideas cannot spread to the more impressionable of our soldiers. Our Aryan commanders will therefore be granted overwhelming power over their men. Any disobedience will be met with summary execution. Underperforming units will be made to lead the charge. If traitors refuse to give themselves up, their comrades will be shot in their place.\n\nLoyalty will also be rewarded, of course. Those soldiers that prove they understand their place will be granted extra rations and basic medical care if wounded before being sent back into the fight. Perhaps we will even discover a few Aryans among the rabble, and elevate them to their rightful position."

 PRM_AB_initial_brotherhood: "The Brotherhood"
 PRM_AB_initial_brotherhood_desc: "With the direction that we have chosen for our armed forces finally seen through, we can now look towards employing this army both within our territory and abroad; not only can we secure the hinterland from the roving bandits who seek to subvert our brotherhood and destroy it from within but also prepare for expansion. It's time to test the waters and probe our enemy's borders through raids of their fringe settlements. We will be able to secure captives and loot, as well as assess our new combat methods and improve them even further with practical experience.\n\nIn the upcoming struggle against the Slav, it is imperative we ensure that, no matter what, our Aryan spirit remains the dominant guiding factor in our strategies. However, it's no secret that these strategies can and will be continuously improved. For the glory of the Brotherhood!"
 
 #Industry Tree#
 PRM_AB_initial_PRM_rise_up: "A City on War Footing"
 PRM_AB_initial_PRM_rise_up_desc: "The decline of the city of Permhaym mirrors to a great extent the decline of the Russian race over the years. Just as we, in ancient times, were a proud and powerful people, now laid low by insipid monarchy and degenerate communism, Permhaym was once the industrial center of the region but is now a shell of its former self, devastated by war and resource shortages.\n\nWe know from the doctrine and example of the Germans that the only path to rejuvenate a race addled by defeat and degeneracy is war, constant war, without end and against all around us. Permhaym, too, will be lifted up from the brink of destruction by war. We need to put military preparation above all else. As many of our resources as possible will be moved over to producing weapons and munitions. This city will reach its salvation, and the first step will be a baptism by blood."

 PRM_AB_initial_work_for_bread: "Work for Your Bread"
 PRM_AB_initial_work_for_bread_desc: "Permhaym's industry is a starving beast. Two wars and continued German bombings have annihilated its factories, and the vermin that make up the majority of the Russian population have not had the mettle to rebuild them. At least, not without encouragement.\n\nAlthough we are loath to give aid to the undeserving, we may have to make exceptions for pragmatic reasons. Permhaym's undesirables have up until now been given a meager ration befitting of their race status. Volunteering for factory work may be taken as a sign of slightly greater racial vigor, at least in comparison to the rest of the sniveling horde. This does not mean that we will be kind. The work will be harsh and unforgiving, with long hours and difficult conditions. Though some among the Aryan caste may cringe at the thought of mercy to the savages, small concessions are necessary to keep the system running."

 PRM_AB_initial_work_for_life: "Work for Your Life"
 PRM_AB_initial_work_for_life_desc: "For every day we neglect to reopen our factories, our chance to build a state even approaching the glory of the Reykh gets further away. Permhaym's industrial capacity has been severely diminished by the ravages of war. Our efforts to continue industrial development have been derailed in part because of the unwillingness of the non-Aryan population to work. While Permhaym dies around them, these subhumans refuse to make sacrifices to save it. Perhaps we should force them.\n\nThere are thousands of able-bodied men and women of the lower castes throughout Permhaym, more than enough to fulfill our industrial needs. Our raider squads, usually put to work acquiring manpower outside of Permhaym, can easily be redirected within it. The lesser races are more resources than men. Let us utilize every one we have at our disposal."

 PRM_AB_initial_national_sweatshops: "Labor for Your Nation"
 PRM_AB_initial_national_sweatshops_desc: "Ivan Kiselyev woke up every morning with a smile on his face. Despite his withered frame and worn clothes, Kiselyev woke up happy because he knew that he would be fed that day. The long hours, grueling to most others, and the utter lack of any safety precautions, that would certainly deter many a labourer, were disregarded by the middle-aged Russian. He had fought in the Great Patriotic War, and survived, only to witness the collapse of the Union. He survived not just the war, but genocide, harsh winters, bandits, and famine. Famine was the worst of all to Kiselyev, who dreamed only of the bits of bread and soup he would earn toiling away, making bullets for the Aryan Brotherhood. He cared not of their dogma; Kiselyev had lost his convictions long ago. Now, he only hoped to survive, and ironically enough, the Brotherhood was helping him do just that."

 PRM_AB_initial_ultranational_sweatshops: "Labor for Your Betters"
 PRM_AB_initial_ultranational_sweatshops_desc: "Dim lights, screeching metal, and harsh, barking orders. These were known as the "Aryan Three" by the workers of the Permhaym Munitions Factory no.12a, and that was considered to be an understatement of the true conditions of the factory. Even without the uncomfortably long shifts that all workers were forced to take, the outdated machinery, utter lack of any safety hazards, and the Aryan Brotherhood's overseers - perhaps more akin to slave drivers - were all endemic to all factories in Permhaym, which seemingly worked day and night to churn out weapons and munitions for the Aryan state. The treatment of workers who keeled over, simply unable to go on was monstrous; being shot was lucky."

 PRM_AB_initial_industrial_army: "Our Industrial Army"
 PRM_AB_initial_industrial_army_desc: "While it is noble to fight with meager technology, as the Germanic tribes did in ages long past, a race must eventually adopt mechanized warfare in order to survive. This does not mean abandoning one's honorable traditions; after all, the Germans conquered most of Europe, and did so wedded firmly to their Aryan heritage.\n\nLuckily, we appear to be following in their footsteps. Our industrial recovery, aided by the labor of the lower castes we pressed into service, is progressing admirably. Of course, most of this production is military, as we need to prove ourselves in racial combat if we wish to survive. Munitions are obviously vital for front line battle, but a sustainable offensive cannot be mounted without fuel. The task now is to decide which areas we want to focus our resources on."

 PRM_AB_initial_munitions: "Reopen the Munitions Plants"
 PRM_AB_initial_munitions_desc: "Any empire is built on blood and iron. We have the blood; the racial purity of our ruling caste is impeccable. But, for a long time, we have not had the iron. Permhaym had munition plants once, churning out bullets and bombs for the Bolshevik vermin to tear down our morals and traditions. Although the Reykh's defeat of the Soviets in the '40s and their despicable residue ten years later opened the door for the creation of our state, it also destroyed much of Russia's industrial capacity. As a result, the armies of the Aryan Brotherhood have suffered from shortages of necessary equipment.\n\nNow that our industry has been developed to a satisfactory level, we can fix this pressing issue. Though it will still be a pathetic imitation of the Vermakht that conquered Europe, our military will have more than enough equipment to squash our enemies wherever we see them."

 PRM_AB_initial_refineries: "Reopen the Refineries"
 PRM_AB_initial_refineries_desc: "Oil is, in a sense, the blood of the Earth. It is also the blood of a modern society, the life-stuff that keeps its power running and its army moving. The veins of the Reykh extend across Europe, keeping the world's greatest empire alive. Before the glorious destruction of the Soviet Union by the Germans, Permhaym was a regional center of oil production. Since then, its refineries have remained mostly empty, other than during a brief period during the West Russian War.\n\nNow that our industry has progressed to the point where we can reopen them once more, not for the benefit of degenerate socialists but for the Aryan race. Our empire is still small, but, powered by the earth's bounty, our armies will travel across Western Russia, spreading the domination of the Aryan race unimpeded."

 PRM_AB_initial_aryan_legions: "Aryan Legions"
 PRM_AB_initial_aryan_legions_desc: "If there is one unifying quality of the Aryan race, it is its warlike nature. We are fighters, conquerors, storming across the land and sacking the soft cities of decadent cultures. For the past several years, resource shortages and the destruction of past wars have prevented us from realizing this racial ideal. Our soldiers have often experienced shortages of ammunition and equipment. At our lowest, we have had guards on patrol with empty rifles.\n\nNow that our munitions factories are pumping out shells and bullets at a steady rate, we will have shortages no longer. Every single Aryan soldier will have a rifle and the ability to do his racial duty without rationing ammunition. This is a vital first step towards our goal of a modern army, as well as towards our broader objective of an Aryan state ruling all of Western Russia."

 PRM_AB_initial_aryan_cavalry: "Aryan Cavalry"
 PRM_AB_initial_aryan_cavalry_desc: "Migration and long-distance conquest have been the essential elements of Aryan life for centuries, and indeed the supplanting of a weak race by a stronger one moving into its range is a fact of nature. In the modern day, we express this racial instinct not via horse or ship, but by truck and tank. Mechanized infantry was the engine of the German subjugation of Europe, the premier demonstration of the Aryan drive to expand in recent history. We, restricted to Permhaym and its surroundings, have remained disgustingly sedentary for too long, as we have not had the resources to power our truck fleet.\n\nThe reconstruction of our refineries has finally allowed us to follow in the footsteps of our migratory ancestors, with a vehicle supply that is the envy of Western Russia. We will be as the Goths were to Rome: a tidal wave of Germanic superiority, cleansing the region by force."

 PRM_AB_initial_city_of_slaughter: "City of Slaughter"
 PRM_AB_initial_city_of_slaughter_desc: "Permhaym has been rejuvenated. The air of decay and degradation that once filled the streets has been filled with one of toil and martial vigor. The shiftless subhuman majority has been put to work reestablishing our industry, and the weapons of war flow out of our factories in impressive numbers.\n\nPermhaym is now an engine of death, the nexus of the coming racial struggle against the scum, degenerates, and race traitors that occupy the vast majority of Russia. Besides the bare necessities required to keep our laborers running, it produces only what is needed for combat. Our blood is pure, our iron is mighty, and our hearts are full of righteous hatred. We have created the perfect staging ground for expansion across the region, and all that is left is to begin."
 
 #Raiding Tree#
 PRM_AB_initial_instill_fear: "Instilling Fear"
 PRM_AB_initial_instill_fear_desc: "Ever since the end of the West Russian War, the Germans have begun their terror bombing campaign to teach the lesser peoples to know their place in the hierarchy of this world. Every day when the planes pass, we look toward the sky and see not terror, but admiration. The Aryans that live beyond Russia have fulfilled their fate, and through merit alone, reached the apex position among the blood. These bombs and terror are their tools to secure their dominance in Russia.\n\nFollowing the example set by our German kin and superiors; we shall be the terror of the land and night, while they reign in the sky and day. No longer shall our inferiors find the darkness a refuge, as the brothers will ransack the countryside and aid the Aryans in their quest. They shall learn the only lesson an Untermensh ought to learn: to fear, to be afraid of their superiors."

 PRM_AB_initial_reform_raiders: "Reform Our Raiders"
 PRM_AB_initial_reform_raiders_desc: "Though our men are excellent in causing terror, proving to the lesser peoples that even in the quiet and dead of night that they are not safe, the Brotherhood and its ideals demand still more. The brothers, mighty as they may be, are disorganized and confused, with an unclear command structure and rules of seniority. We look to our silent benefactors, the Germans: with a centralized doctrine and the power of their blood, they were able to put the entirety of Russia to its knees.\n\nFollowing their example, we shall amend the structure of the Brotherhood's military arm. No longer shall a brother and another bicker among themselves as to who does what. Our senior brothers, effectively the officer corps of the Brotherhood, shall be granted formal authority to command. With these reforms in place, we shall aspire to one day achieve the heights of the Germans."

 PRM_AB_initial_disciplined_raiders: "A Disciplined Raiding Force"
 PRM_AB_initial_disciplined_raiders_desc: "From the archives of Permhaym, the officers and generals of the Brotherhood study the art of war. In their search for perfection to the Aryan ideal, they stumbled across an innovative German idea: the general staff. A body of centralized command that deliberates and calibrates the course of warfare, ensuring that everything goes to plan. It is popular among the higher echelons but is infamous with the lower-ranking soldiers of the Brotherhood.\n\nHowever, what do the junior brothers know of running the Brotherhood? We shall establish the general staff and its dependent appendages, ensuring that combat will always go as planned. Its reputation with the common soldiery will perhaps incense them, as this will entail the loss of their ability to raid as they see fit. We shall not let their anger get in the way, however, for the final victory demands something of us all."

 PRM_AB_initial_autonomous_raiders: "Autonomous Battalions"
 PRM_AB_initial_autonomous_raiders_desc: "Whatever the high command in Permhaym may think, the officers and brothers in the frontiers know better when it comes to raiding. They know where the most vulnerable parts of the border lay and how to exploit weaknesses in the enemy's attention. With independence and a minimum of control, these battalions become as effective as they are chaotic: attacking without orders from headquarters, unpredictable in temperament, and restraint.\n\nInstead of investing power into a general staff, we can instead give the informal practice of unprecedented operational freedom an official stamp. These battalions will become autonomous, free to raid the countryside as they please. They will tear through the lands of Russia anew, spreading terror without mercy or exception. Now that the dogs of war are unleashed, the Untermensh shall learn to fear us again."

 PRM_AB_initial_strike_heart: "Strike at the Heart"
 PRM_AB_initial_strike_heart_desc: "The offices of the Brotherhood's military headquarters are busy every day, ever since its establishment and inauguration. From Permhaym to the frontiers of our borders flows a steady stream of instruction and commands, and on its way back, it gathers intelligence and information regarding the front. With such a profound supply of data coursing through its veins, the Brotherhood's general staff has grown to be a capable militaristic entity.\n\nIts existence and competence necessitate another radical change to take place. We shall no longer be content with raiding the rural villages and towns, as these prove themselves to be a waste to the staff's efforts. Instead, we will set our eyes on the choicest pieces Russia can offer: its small cities. The risks of attacking these are high, but the rewards are vaster. Using superior planning, the inferior peoples shall stand no chance against us."

 PRM_AB_initial_strike_arteries: "Strike at the Arteries"
 PRM_AB_initial_strike_arteries_desc: "The frontier units of the Brotherhood are now free to do in their designated regions as they see fit. Encouraged by this newfound freedom, our independent battalions have struck out against our inferiors, stripping them of resources and people alike. As the night raids intensify, the Brotherhood's enemies continue to grow weaker and weaker, unable to deal with the unpredictability and randomness of the attacks.\n\nWe can utilize this. By dividing the regions into smaller chunks and assigning more units, we can increase the rate of raiding to the point of suffocation on the enemy's part. The sheer quantity and rapidity of the offensives will deprive them of the ability to recover. We shall hound them from dusk until dawn, hitting them without pause, until they are too weak to respond. The equipment and weapons that we wrestle away from the Untermensh will help us secure the final triumph."

 PRM_AB_initial_test_theories: "Test Our Theories"
 PRM_AB_initial_test_theories_desc: "Under the shadow of the German planes, we have reformed our forces to reach the heights they attained. Now the Brotherhood looks at its men with pride, for no army of Aryans more exemplary and capable has ever tread the lands of Russia in triumph. The examples of the Germans have aided us well, and the strength of the blood has carried us this far. The time is ripe for a test of our power, a trial that will redeem the worth of our bonds.\n\nWe look to our neighbors. To the south lay Bashkiria, with its pretensions to independence and self-determination. Our kin pine for liberation from the Untermensh, and the blood wishes to heed their call. To the north lay Berezniki, where wells of oil, resources, and motorized plans await for their use in the hands of a brave Aryan. Whatever we choose, we must prepare.

The Bashkirs have deluded themselves into thinking that they can rule over the blood.\n\nIt is time to make them pay for this insolence. Rather than Berezniki, we shall focus our efforts against the Bashkirs. Their villages, towns, and even cities will be made to pay the price of their delusion and cruelty.

If we decide to go after Berezniki, our officers will draw plans and assign battalions to specific areas of the border. Our attack shall be quick and sharp but without mercy.

Their factories can churn out guns for the Brotherhood's armies, and their people can provide the necessary labor to ensure a steady, uninterrupted supply of weaponry.\n\nHowever, before moving into Bashkiria proper, the Brotherhood will prepare itself. We will redirect our raids against them, wounding them with a thousand cuts before the time comes to finish them off. At the same time, our new secret police, the Geshtapo, will infiltrate the territories of Bashkiria on the lookout for secrets and weaknesses.

Though Russians and Bashkirs are Untermensh, the Brotherhood has found the blood to be on the side of the former.\n\nBefore any attack on Bashkiria itself can occur, we need to widen the cracks that emerge between them. Though not many will join the Brotherhood willingly, there are Russians from whom we can extract loyalty against the Bashkir state.

We cannot allow Russia to be dragged back into its subhuman nightmare, not when it is this close to greatness. Our rule must be secured, and a new order must be brought down upon the east.\n\nThe first step to achieving this will be to impose a new code of laws. This Aryan Code will make it easier to administer the vast territory we control with the efficiency and ruthlessness that define our race. Up until now the Brotherhood has been an army on crusade, running wild and destroying the enemy wherever they were found. While this was perfect for when we were at war, we now find ourselves at peace, at least for the moment, and a much more disciplined approach is needed.

Others have taken a more nuanced approach and created their own systems of ranking bloodlines from true Aryans all the way down to inhuman mongrels, with any number of steps in between. We must clarify the Brotherhood's policy on this issue if we want to secure Aryan dominance of Russia and maintain the purity of our blood. A system of categorizing races based upon ancestry, physical and mental fortitude, and physical characteristics will be created to define the racial castes.\n\nThe creation of this system will not be without difficulty.

The Brotherhood cannot afford to delay on this issue. While none dare oppose our dominance of Western Russia, our race's sanctity is still at risk.

We must make every effort to break this delusion and bring all members of the master race into the Brotherhood.\n\nOur government will launch campaigns to educate Aryans on their own superiority, and the dangers of fraternizing with other races. We will place members of the master race in charge of their old communities, their former neighbors becoming their slaves as the natural divide between the castes is restored.

The Fyurer and his supporters argue that this would be a betrayal of the Aryan race and would only corrupt the bloodline and see our people absorbed by the Slavic hordes within a generation.\n\nWhile these arguments have only grown fiercer as the weeks have worn on and a subhuman revolt seems more and more likely, both sides agree on one course of action. Regardless of who we consider Aryan, all power must be within Aryan hands. Currently there are still Untermensh landowners, Untermensh militia leaders, even Untermensh politicians attempting to act as a bridge between races. We will put a stop to this.

The Brotherhood used to explain this phenomenon by saying that Slavs demonstrating Aryan characteristics were either actually Aryans that had been indoctrinated by the subhumans, or Slavs attempting to deceive the Ubermensh by imitating them.\n\nAs our reach has expanded, we have encountered increasing numbers of proud Slavs displaying the qualities we expect from Brotherhood members. Shultz and his supporters have put forth an explanation for this bizarre phenomenon. It is possible to be both Slavic and Aryan! This goes completely against the established beliefs of the Brotherhood, but if it is true it could pave the way to our salvation.

Now that we have expanded Aryanism's definition to include Slavs that can prove their superior blood, a solution to this issue has presented itself.\n\nThe recruitment standards of the brotherhood's Aryan military units should be expanded to match the definition followed by the rest of the Brotherhood.

Instead we will follow the example of the Germans, who have never steered us wrong. When dealing with resistance to their rule, the Germans crack down and use brutal suppression to enforce their will. This is how an Aryan nation should be run, not by bowing to the desires of the lesser peoples, but by imposing the iron laws of the Ubermensh upon them and wiping out anyone who seeks to subvert or escape those laws.\n\nAcross West Russia our Brothers have fought resistance movements and carried out terror raids on uncooperative communities, but they have done so in an unorganized and haphazard fashion.

The Brotherhood will take one member of every Untermensh family to labor camps where they will be held indefinitely until the nation has submitted to our rule. If any sabotage, terrorism, or banditry occurs, the entire population of the nearest camp will be executed and new hostages taken to refill it. This will be a costly program to enact, requiring resources and manpower that are already scarce.

There can only be one sensible explanation for this: our language. Though we are of one race, German and Russian Aryans are divided by language. It is clear the Russian tongue, with its Slavic influences and archaic alphabet, is holding us back.\n\nLuckily a solution is already apparent. Years ago, some members of the Brotherhood's officer korps took it upon themselves to learn Deytsch, the language of Germany, as a sign of their admiration.

This would condemn many Aryans to having to keep their knowledge of the inferior Slavic tongues, and negate the purpose of adopting a superior language. As loath as we are to dedicate any resources to them, the Brotherhood must begin efforts to educate the slaves on at least the rudimentary basics of Deytsch, so that all Aryans only have to speak the language of our choice."

While many have been eager to learn a new language that is more efficient and proper for our new nation, few people, even among the Aryan community, seem as excited to give up their so-called "mother tongue". Unfortunately for them, the Brotherhood has made up its mind. There is no place for the Russian language in our nation, and we must abandon it immediately if our bloodline is to achieve its full potential. Our linguists will translate everything to Deytsch as soon as possible. Government documents, street signs, menus in restaurants, all of this and anything else that is written down will be changed. There will be some confusion, and even chaos, in the weeks that follow the switch, but that is the price we must pay for efficiency.\n\nOnce the first phase is complete, the next step of the plan shall begin. Everyone, Aryan and Untermensh alike, shall be required to speak only Deytsch. Anyone caught speaking any other language will be publicly flogged, and those who we catch doing this a second time will be executed for their betrayal of the Brotherhood. These punishments are harsh, but they must be to force the people to do what is best for themselves."

By enslaving all non-Aryans within our borders, we are creating the perfect recipe for an uprising that would spell doom for the Aryans of the east. We have enslaved over 90% of our population, but administering that many slaves has proven impossible. Questions of ownership have complicated matters further, leaving us in a situation where we must contend with the instability of an enslaved populace while failing to exert any control over the majority of them. Something must change, but our leaders cannot agree on what.\n\nShultz's reformists advocate for emancipating the slaves. As heretical as this idea seems, their case is good. The Untermensh would still be fully subservient to the Aryan, but as free individuals the issue of slave ownership would be eliminated.\n\nHowever, others in the high command, especially those close to Fyurer Vagner, have labeled this idea Slavic treachery and an invitation for race-mixing. They argue that we can solve the issue with the same method the Brotherhood has solved its other problems: brute force. The slave system must be organized and the overseers must crush any signs of resistance without mercy. Both cases seem convincing but we are running out of time and must decide soon."

Trying to force a slave society onto Russia would only be repeating the mistakes of the Tsars and the Bolsheviks. Our Aryan government cannot be allowed to collapse as those regimes did. The entire fate of our bloodline depends upon the Brotherhood securing a permanent home for the race in Russia. As long as there are slaves, there is risk of uprisings, and as long as there is risk of uprisings, our people will never be safe. Shultz has drafted a plan that would put an end to enslavement and allow the current slaves to work their way to freedom over the next few years. While it is far from the ideal system the Fyurer first envisioned so many years ago, it will maintain the superior position of the master race in our society while also allowing for even a modicum of long-term stability.

Every Aryan knows that the Untermensh are still slothful, degenerate creatures that need to be motivated to work. The emancipation plan is designed around this fact. Slaves will need to complete a certain amount of work to earn their freedom and the few rights that will come with it. The specific amount of work required will be determined by the type of labor involved, but it will equate to roughly three or four years of work in the field. The faster the work is completed, the more quickly freedom is earned. This will allow the younger and stronger slaves to earn their freedom more quickly, and through more dangerous work such as at munitions plants or in textile mills. The weaker slaves, the children, the elderly, and the sickly, will need more time to complete their work, meaning the slaves that pose less of a threat to their masters will remain under direct control for much longer. Of course, if too many valuable slaves are earning their freedom no one could stop us from extending their enslavement as long as is needed."

Our production numbers have increased almost across the board. Everything from farms to mills to munitions plants have shown increased output as formerly slothful slaves have begun working at a frantic pace. We should encourage this behavior from the Untermensh. Publicly promoting stories of workers who have already earned their freedom and encouraging them to speak about the wonders of their emancipation will prove that the promise of freedom is not just a rumor or a lie spread by the Brotherhood.\n\nThe slaves know that the road to their freedom is not easy, or safe. The recent increase in work related fatalities is evidence enough of that. They do not care. As long as we dangle a chance at liberation in front of them, they will do whatever it takes to reach it. The goal of this program was never to free all the slaves. It was to free the worthy, and destroy those who are not. So far it is working spectacularly."

We are working them harder than ever before, reaping ever-increasing rewards as they toil for the benefit of the Ubermensh.\n\nThe decision to end slavery was not made because of childish altruism, but because it was a necessary and efficient step to guarantee the survival of our people. No true Aryan would have done anything different, and those who question the decision have exposed themselves as race traitors. They are not fueled by a love of their blood, but by a hatred for the Untermensh. The Untermensh are unquestionably despicable, but the first priority must always be our race and whatever is best for it.

A certain willpower is required to thrive under the rule of the Brotherhood, and this willpower is not exclusive to the Ubermensh. No subhuman is equal to an Aryan, but not every subhuman is equally vile. There are those that can stand tall and provide for both themselves and the state, possessing certain Aryan qualities, even if they themselves might not be Aryan in blood. Then there are the others that are too weak to do this, who are truly the lowest of the low.\n\nThe freedom we are offering is a reward to those strong enough to claim it.

Or if agriculture isn't to their liking, they could move to one of the revitalized urban jewels of the Brotherhood, working in a factory to assemble products for the Aryan race. Their payment in script will be generous and redeemable at the Brotherhood's stores.\n\nNo matter where their newfound freedom takes them, the Untermensh will never have to worry about being unsupervised.

The slaves that are brave enough or foolish enough to defy us are instigators and figureheads for their less courageous brethren.\n\nTo secure the obedience of the subhumans we will implement a new system of punishments designed to crush any will to resist. Even the smallest act of disobedience from a slave will be met with a public execution that their comrades will be forced to watch. Any slave caught conspiring against their master will be thrown to the dogs while their family watches them die. These methods will be cruel even for us, but it is necessary.

The next step of this plan is to break their spirits, so that they cannot even dream of freedom. We will do this by denying them hope, as hope is a dangerous distraction in the mind of a slave. There will be no holidays or celebrations to look forward to. The only rest that will be permitted will be at the end of the day when the slaves have already worked themselves past the point of exhaustion. Without little things to hope for like a decent meal or an unexpected break, the Untermensh will eventually forget how to hope for bigger things like escape or revolution.

Large numbers of newly-acquired slaves will be dispatched all throughout the Reykh with one simple goal: to make sure our infrastructure is in working order by the time our struggle resumes. The railways that stretch across the region will be repaired and refitted, the bombed-out roads will be made usable again to the best of our abilities, and our logistical organization will be streamlined to be more efficient than ever before.

That being said, we cannot adapt the tactic for our own forces as-is, for we currently do not have tanks and aircraft in large enough numbers.\n\nOur senior military staff have long analyzed German tactics, and some are now putting forth the idea that large forces of tanks are not necessary to create a lightning war of our own. Indeed, our brothers are so devoted and tenacious that their ferocity in battle alone makes them a powerful tool for achieving breakthroughs.

From these foundations we hope that further, more ambitious possibilities of Pan-Aryan cooperation can be born.

Our past messengers have not received even a word in return, and rumors (doubtlessly false) that the leadership of Reykhskommissariat Moskowien dispute our Aryan status are beginning to spread throughout our ranks.

It is a disgusting insult that this is exactly the location the Jews today claim to be their homeland. The world must know that we no longer tolerate the millenia-old theft of our heritage.

Those who are educated know that the 'German Aryan' is nothing more than a sub-human specimen who migrated out of their dungholes in East Asia. The true Aryans, us Boreal Rus, are the chosen peoples, with our rich heritage. It was us who were forced north from the Levant, chased out of our homelands by the Eternal, barbaric Jew. It was they who failed to exterminate us, and they who looked upon our paradise with jealousy which they harbored for centuries.\n\nYou tell me many of our people do not know of our past, our struggles, and our greatness?

Many beg for mercy, to be released so that they can participate in the renewal of the Aryan race and liberate it from all of its enemies. We can not simply allow people freedom with blatant leniency, though. We would be no better than the degenerate Christians and Jews if we released prisoners with no penalties. Our ancestors, thankfully, knew a solution.\n\nTo prove their worthiness, those who petition us for release must face the Trials of Redemption, a series of challenges to weed out the disingenuous and weak from those deserving to be released as Hyperborean Aryans.

 PRM.1.desc: "Born after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aryan Brotherhood is the brainchild of Gutrum Vagner, known in another life as Alexey Dobrovolsky.\n\nThe shock of the Germans blitzing across Russia has led to the rise of many groups claiming that the Germans were right; and Dobrovolsky's small one was no exception. However, by gathering as much information as he could on the German regime and its intricacies, he soon enough managed to gather more and more of these small groups into one cohesive whole; the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\nCoalescing around Perm and Tatyshlinsky, the Brotherhood continued to refine its methods of "sorting out Aryans" from the local populace via grueling physical and mental tests, preparing for the struggle for the remnants of Russia. A struggle which seems closer and closer by the day, and the Brotherhood shall stand ready. Not just to deliver Western Russia at the Reykh's feet, but also, maybe, to have the chance to finish the Vaterland's job..."
 PRM.1.a: "Russia shall bow before the Swastika!"

 PRM.2.t: "Victory for the Brotherhood!"
 PRM.2.desc: "The glorious city of Permhaym and its Aryan inhabitants were engulfed in joy and celebration as our brave warriors returned home from battle from the Bashkir whelps, full of stories of glory and plunder. The Bashkirs, as expected, fell under their furious onslaught, or turned tail like the cowards they were and slunk back into their caves.\n\nA glorious battle is cause for celebration enough, but more than this, we are now in possession of a sliver of their land - as it should be. As the Fyurer has proclaimed, once our mission is done, all of the future Reykh is to become living space for the Brotherhood."
 PRM.2.a: "Another Victory for the Aryan!"

 PRM.3.t: "Defeat in Bashkiria"
 PRM.3.desc: "Tragedy struck the streets of Permhaym today - the so called 'Aryan Warriors' we sent to decimate the forces of the Bashkir Menace returned not only empty handed, but with their tails between their legs, scurrying back to their masters like dogs. The Fyurer's rage was great, and he immediately declared all survivors of the conflict that ran from the front lines Untermensh.\n\nYet the Fyurer is not without mercy - the scum were simply put to death. They had earned that much, at least."
 PRM.3.a: "Curses!"

 PRM.4.t: "A Draw in Bashkiria"
 PRM.4.desc: "The Fyurer's mood was a dark one when he learned our Warriors returned home, bloodied and bruised, but their saving grace was that the Bashkirs returned home just as mauled. Though we are in possession of no new lands or plunder from the failed Raid, our Warriors have nevertheless proven themselves true Aryans - they turned a losing battle into a draw.\n\nAnd that is surely another victory for the future Reykh."
 PRM.4.a: "Disappointing."
 
 PRM.8.t: "The Brotherhood Needs Blood"
 PRM.8.desc: "The future of the Aryan race depends on renewal. As the weeks go by, the Fyurer knows, the Untermensh become complacent and arrogant, descending into degeneracy and Jewry as the older Brothers fail to beat them hard enough.\n\nAs its control over the Reykh slips, the Brotherhood must restore itself through blood. By organising another Rite of Ascension, bringing into the fold new men to induct into the Aryan race, we shall cause the Untermensh to cower in terror and solidify our own power. To fail to participate in this periodic renewal will see us weaken further, inevitably succumbing in future at the hands of our Aryan betters.\n\nThe Ascension shall be a violent one. To complete it, hundreds of men, women, and children of the Slavic race must be killed by our inducted brothers. Their cries of pain and fear, the misery of weakness and death, can only be borne by the most ruthless murderers we find. Those who fail the task will die in turn."

It has been a very long time since we performed our last Rite of Ascension and now the ranks of the Aryans are stretched too thin to rule our territory, as consequence the Untermensh have grown in number and boldness while the Aryans have not, and thus they form resistance groups. Therefore, it is very important that we perform a new Rite of Ascension as soon as possible to separate the wheat from the genetically inferior chaff, to raise the numbers of Aryans and strengthen our control over the Untermensh.\n\nIt is also important to repeat the Rite of Ascension every time new territory is added to the Reyk or when our control over the undesirables is slipping, mein Fyurer, or the same situation will happen over and over again."

 PRM_initial.11.desc: "Dawn looms over Permhaym, illuminating the cobbled roads and rotten-smelling markets. Men and women, dressed in shabby rags, clamber out from their homes for the day's daily toil. Children play amid its quiet streets, laughing and keeping a watchful eye to the skies. Dressed in faux-feldgrau, the men of the Brotherhood patrol the streets and man the anti-air emplacements around the city. The thump of their well-shined boots sends the young ones scurrying to the shadows, their timbre more fearsome than any bomber can summon.\n\nIn one dilapidated and abandoned corner of the city walks senior brother Waldemar, alone, with his partner absent, writhing in bed, enduring a fever. Waldemar paid his worry no heed; if the man is Aryan enough, he will recover. Besides, in his absence, no one would rat out his dereliction of duty. The choice to spend this free time, however, is not nearly as liberating. In the district he patrols, there is nothing but broken and shattered buildings and rats, save for one squat and rundown bar.\n\nStepping into it, he hails the waiter, "This bar is a shameful establishment," says Waldemar, "I order a full cup of sour beer and be quick about it. The Brotherhood shall handle your payment." The owner, flushed-faced, went to fetch a dusty tankard and washed it in dirty water. Waldemar sighs. No other choice. A few moments later, his drink would arrive, foaming at its rims. He did not deign to drink it. Meeting the owner's gaze, he says, "You seem to be holding something in, Untermensh. Speak, slave, or forever hold your peace." The owner seemed struck, and began, "You people cannot do this to us; one day, the will of Russia will rise and crush you. Besides, are you not also Russi-" He held his hand up. "I've heard enough," he says, "the Brotherhood has plans for us all, and you will not stop us." He stands and spits into his pint, "We will pay for this portion." He threw open the doors and stormed out."

In front of them stood several platoons of men, each dressed in the same outfit, standing at attention. "As you can see, we have prepared for your arrival. Examine the men before you to your heart's desire." They were the perfect Aryan specimen, standing proud on the dark, cold earth, points of Aryan light amid Russian darkness. Their arms bore the armband that all brothers of the Brotherhood wore. A piece of red fabric with a white circle in the middle of which was a swastika.\n\n"Thank you, brother Ditrikh," Vagner said, "it's an honor to examine these fine examples of the Aryan blood within us." Dashing they were, and tall, with a ruddy, reddish hue on their cheeks. Not one of them averted their eyes when they met Vagner's. Instead, in each were a fire, burning with enthusiasm, its crackle audible to his ears. "I see you have trained them well. Tell me, Ditrikh," the old brother turned his head to face Vagner, "did your men eat well last night?"\n\n"Of course, sir. The slaves assigned to this regiment were of the highest quality," Ditrikh snorted, "might I even say they make for excellent cooks. Thank you for that, sir. As well as," he pointed to the rifles and machine guns of the men, "the munitions and equipment."\n\n"No need to thank me, brother. A workman must have the best tools to do his task, must he not? You and your regiment have proven yourselves worthy of the labor the slaves have put into your tools."\n\n"Thank you, sir, and should we proceed?""

Looking out on the city of Perm from the Brotherhood's Folkshale, he felt prouder than ever before, not only for his own myriad virtues but for everything his people had accomplished.\n\nIt had a stark, brutal beauty to it.

The streets, once teeming with Bolshevik filth, were now filled only with quiet, orderly slave crews watched carefully over by Aryan overseers. New factories appeared seemingly every day, filling the skies with smog and pumping out nothing else but the finest weapons of war for his legions.\n\nVagner had taken the disorderly mess that was Perm and beaten it viciously into shape. Now its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, Aryan or slave, were seemingly of a single mind, united by force towards a single purpose: the utter annihilation of anyone who would stand in the way of the Aryan Brotherhood."

He recalled wisdom from the doctrine: the mind had a hierarchy of thoughts, just as the body had a hierarchy of blood. Fear, doubt, and anxiety were the brain patterns of vermin; Aryans thought only of strength and courage, violence and conquest. Nervousness was a vestige of the inferiority he would soon leave behind.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, he reached the end of the long corridor and entered the grand hall. Aryans, members of the organization, sat in a horseshoe surrounding the center of the room, with a cloaked higher-ranked member on an elevated seat in the center. Dmitri dropped to his knees instinctively. "Initiate Polachev, rise." The hooded figure spoke in a soft voice that nevertheless carried through the chamber. He obeyed, attempting to mimic the dignified figure of the Nordic ideal as he stood.\n\n"You have performed admirably in the Trials, served with unflinching loyalty in all the duties of the initiate. You have sworn the oaths to Folk, Reykh, and Fyurer. You have proven yourself as one among the elect. Revel in the worthiness of your blood, Matyas Gertzfeld. Welcome to the Aryan Brotherhood."\n\nThe seated members clapped politely as Matyas received the proof of his superiority: a swastika pin, which he proudly attached to his lapel. His haughty posture, an affectation only a few minutes before, was now genuine. He felt pride and hatred pervade him to the bone. He was part of a small, elite class high above the millions of vermin that filled Russia, and he would die before relinquishing that status."

In the woods where he lived, all was silent, save for the crackling of the campfire, and the still, whispering band of men sitting around it. The air stirred. He drew a long stretch of his cigarette, watching the embers bloom and fade to grey. Along with the aroma of the tobacco, the images of home and family entered his mind, filling his thoughts in a gentle, smoking haze. He shook the cigarette gingerly and let its ashes dissipate into the wind. Warm and comfortable, he felt his eyelids sag, and dozed off.\n\nHe awoke to the sound of boots trampling through the forest. Some of the men had abandoned their places already, leaving behind whatever they had taken to this sacred place. In the distance, Dmitri could hear the faint revving of a truck. Then the gunshots came. Men, dressed in black uniforms, emerge into the clearing. He and the rest of the companions huddled together, as the yoke of these men slowly wound themselves closer.\n\n"Do not be alerted," he heard a voice say. Its owner strolled behind his men, his hands clasped behind his hip. "Rejoice, instead, for the Brotherhood has come to you this night to deliver neither death nor doom, but hope." He paused, looking at Dmitri. He went closer, into the circle, and squatted down, gently running his fingers through Dmitri's rough cheeks and beard. "I can feel that we are of the same blood already, brother." He stood up, looking straight into Dmitri's eyes, and said, "If you would only still your shivers, then you would be worthy." Bending down, he put his palms on Dmitri's shoulders. "But there is always an opportunity to improve, now get up." He offered his hand, and Dmitri grasped it without hesitation.\n\n"Good, good, brother," he said, swinging his arms around Dmitri's neck, "now follow us." He looked at the rest of the companions in contempt and said, "Liquidate the rest." Dmitri dared not look back, even as the screams ensued and ceased."

Volfgang gave the man his thanks and proceeded into the building, opening the door to the din of the beer hall, with brothers young and old toasting each other while slave girls worked in the aisles of the tables, carrying towering tankards of the thick, sour brew.\n\nHe picked a vacant seat and sat in it. He ordered a drink from a slave, addressing her curtly and without affection. When it arrived, he did not even deign to thank her and took it without comment. While enjoying his pint, a group of boisterous young men barged through the doors, exchanging crude jokes with one another. They were men from his platoon. He waved at them to join him. Soon his table became crowded with comrades, brothers in arms, with whom he shared the highest bond, far beyond family, that binds them deeper and thicker than mere blood.\n\n"Quiet, quiet! Order! Order!" Men shouted as they cleared the center of the hall, leaving a lone, red-faced man standing on a table, stumbling drunkenly side-to-side in an effort not to fall. His friends laughed at him, jeering him to go on. He straightened his back, and, making an earnest face, drew his breath.\n\n"Comrades, brothers, countrymen!" He started, waving his arms wildly. He began his appeal, without adornment nor ostentation. Though without elegance nor panache, his words, railing against their inferiors, struck a chord with the crowd. His anger at the low station of the Aryans resonated with Volfgang. He ended his tirade, saying: "And this is what I suggest, brothers! A putsch! A putsch against fate! To rage against it, to burn out in the struggle, to rebel against our destiny, and make our own!" The hall erupted in cheers, and Volfgang found himself repeating the words."

He gets up and kneels at the bedposts of his small room, praying to the Trinity for his daily bread, after which he dresses up in his coarse garments. The landlord, an Aryan, never so much as glances at him nor wonder at his absence. All that matters to that squat, little man is his rent. Until recently, however, Sergei could not pay him, subsisting on hard labor and his pity.\n\nYesterday, however, caused a radical change in Sergei's life. The local Brotherhood patrol brought something other than terror: jobs. From six in the morning to ten in the evening, with extra rations and a little more pay, enough so that his landlord should not force him to sleep in the cold. Today, Sergei's pace is lighter than usual, happy that he has work, with money and food awaiting on the other side of the day. The plant is near his home, only a block away from where he lives.\n\nWhen he opened the doors to its floors, he found a few hundred men and women working on their respective tables, assembled into lines and ranks, with rusty and unwieldy tools laid in front of them. Deeper into the factory, the sound of heavy machinery laboring roared into the ceilings, bouncing off walls on its way down. The brothers, clad in their gray attire, watch them closely. Sometimes they would take an insubordinate worker outside and beat them, but so far, Sergei could not hear any gunshots. When lunch comes, the Brotherhood upholds its word, serving broth and bread before sending them back to work.\n\nAt ten in the evening, as promised, they let them go. The commanding officer gives them their pay, as well as some bread for dinner. Sergei has never worked as hard in his life, nor has he ever been in so much terror. As soon as he entered his room, he collapsed, forgetting his nightly prayer."

Russians were survivors, after all.\n\nA knock at the door, three hard "thumps" of a gloved hand on wood. Hundreds of doors, in fact, on apartments all over the city. A father rose, gingerly stepped over his sleeping children to answer. A young woman slowly crawled out from under her thin blanket, shaking out of a mixture of fear and cold. An old man stood shivering with creaking limbs, stowed his book away from sight and held his lantern close to his eyes as he crept to the door.\n\nAnother knock, loud and harsh, threatened to break the door down with its violence, and the residents of Permhaym quickened their pace. Finally, they opened the door; in each case, a weary homeowner came face-to-face with a rifle. Their eyes fearfully moved from the barrel of the guns to the chests, and then the face of the users. These were "Aryans", the pins on their lapels and the haughty look in their eyes marking them out as their betters. They spoke tersely, unwilling to waste even words on their inferiors: "Work detail. Now."\n\nPermhaym's new laborers, stumbling in the dark, were marched silently to the factories at gunpoint. They worked ceaselessly, taking short breaks only for bread and, when the guards weren't looking, sleep.

Still, she labored and worked without complaint if it meant that her dear Nastya would live another day without hunger. The place was dark, with a lone candle sitting on a bedside stand illuminating the air. The tiny bed is covered in a mountain of dirty laundry and with the lowest layer being their cleanest garments.\n\nA head poked out of the mess. "Mother?" a weak and trembling voice called out, "Are you there?" Sofia rushed to her side, saying, "Nastya, Nastya, my dear, do not exert yourself." Sofia laid her hands on Nastya's forehead, "Thank the Lord that your temperature has gone down. Have you eaten the meals I prepared for you?" A nod. "Did you drink the medicine?" Some bitter herbs, better than nothing, but another nod. "Oh good," Sofia said, heaving a big sigh, "I have brought you some bread for you to eat." She saw Nastya's smile, the happiest moment in her life, and saw it fade and crumble as she asked, "Have you eaten?" Her stomach seemed to grumble in response, but she nodded her head. "Yes."\n\nThus began Nastya's dinner. Her mother broke off pieces of bread for her, and as she ate, Sofia took its crumbs and swiped it off the bed. When it was over, they talked. Nastya, now stronger with some fuel in her belly, led the conversation. "How's your work, mother," she said, "did the men in grey treat you well?" Sofia's mind flashed to the time when they struck her fellow worker, an aged man who was there for just the bread. "Yes, they have, and it's no cause for you to worry!" Nastya puffed her lips, "Good! Otherwise, I would beat them black and blue!"\n\nSofia laughed, something she hasn't done in a long time, and tussled her daughter's hair.

Among this rush was Sergei, who, like everyone, hurried to his station. As early as two hours before dawn, the machinery of the factory had begun working. The guards stared at them in contempt and gestured to them to move quicker. One brother took a laborer he hated aside and said: "Tell your friends that if you don't do a good job, you will regret it."\n\nThe inspector arrived. Sergei could tell by the thump of the boots, the only sound that rises above the roaring of machines and engines, and the slow, steady bangs and squeaks in the work tables. The inspector's shadow grew longer until it pierced the doorway. A man, somewhat short, emerged in the doorway. His entourage preceded him, covering the corners of the room, in case of workers fleeing, Sergei supposed. No time for such thoughts, however. Sergei put his back to his work, screwing and polishing the rifles together without pause.\n\nA bomber loomed ahead, far above. The scream of its alarms drove Sergei to his knees, and he shut his eyes. The anti-air guns fired, the sounds shaking the ground under his feet. Silence, and then an explosion. He could feel the shrapnel tearing through the buildings near him. He opened his eyes. None of the workers had gone down to their feet, and the inspector stood in front of him. He felt his heart plunge, and he stared blankly at the inspector's boots.\n\n"Looks like you still have a ways to go," he said, "Untermensh." Before Sergei could even stammer out an apology, he felt the force of soles of those shoes in his face, loosening one of his teeth. "Looks like we have one to make an example out of, boys. Take him."

Today, Vagner and the Council of the Brotherhood had given them a special assignment: the branding of slaves. In the hot fire-pits in front of them, were two brands. Both were red-iron hot, burning as if driven by a strange desire to subsume, to make another submit to one's will.\n\nThe new batch of slaves was coming. Rumors from the lower ranks, as well as the lowly servants that made the bulk of the labor force in the barracks, had stipulated that these bunch were especially pitiful. Short, thin, with a willowy complexion laid over them like a thin shroud of pale grey fabric. Ditrikh, an Aryan brother since the first days of the Brotherhood, pointed to one of the brands, whose end was shaped like a swastika.\n\n"Most of today's crew would probably use this one," he said, opening his palms against the hooked cross to feel the warmth emanate, and the cruelty flow, "means they would make bad slaves. Better to put them out of their misery now. Less people to manage. Brother Vagner would understand."\n\n"And that one?" said Villem, noting the other brand, a cross, an X mark, "Are those for the good slaves?"\n\n"Of course, Villem." Ditrikh stood up, and tapped Villem's shoulder, "Do watch out for the ones you think would make a good brother, we can use more of those."\n\n"How do you tell?"\n\n"Just pick whatever you like.""

One of them carried a flag proudly emblazoned with the swastika standard, as though the reconstruction of a Soviet refinery was an existential victory for the Aryan race. For them, perhaps it was. Just outside of the building, one of the officials signaled that he would speak, and the soldiers herded their prisoners into a loose audience with a few strategic rifle-butts. They stood with rapt attention as he began.\n\n"Long ago, far before even the ancient ancestors of the Aryans set up their majestic empires, millions of creatures lived and died, vanquished when they could not keep up with the pressures of natural selection. They were then drawn under the earth by the passage of time, their remains crushed and blasted by enormous weight and heat into what we recognize as petroleum. In a sense, they have been smashed under the planet's boot. It is fitting, then, that our state, built upon the backs of those too weak to claw themselves a place in it, relies so heavily upon oil. It is the lifeblood of the Earth, and it will be the potent blood of the next Reykh!"\n\nThe soldiers quickly started clapping, and, after being persuaded with several solid kicks, the workers reluctantly followed.

What dark times, before the enlightening vision of the Brotherhood brought him forward as the best specimen of humankind. Recovering from his disgust, he smirked. The Soviets, their arch-enemies, had provided the Brotherhood with the means to build the new order. A world where the lesser would learn their places in the hierarchy.\n\nAn explosion rang from within, a muffled cacophony of a thousand cracklings, steadily getting louder and louder, before fading away to silence. A brother stepped out, hands over ears. He approached the distressed Aryan, questions bubbling in his mind. Perhaps this man can answer for him the most central of them all: to punish or let go.\n\n"Heyl, Hyer Inspektur," the man said, "I am sorry for causing you concern, but I am fine."\n\n"No problem," the inspector said, "what is your name, brother?"\n\n"Villem, sir."\n\n"What happened back there, Villem? An accident?"\n\n"You could say that. Someone set off an old munitions cache. Six people are dead."\n\n"Any of them Aryan?" Villem shook his head. "Good, continue as you would, brother." He saluted the brother, who returned the gesture. He would let these lot go, after all. Slaves come and go in such numbers these days. His mind turned to the report he was to write later in the day.

This was risky business; the Brotherhood's soldiers were renowned throughout the region for their sheer aggression and brutality, but their presence outside of Permhaym was limited enough that it was worth the risk. After all, that brutality only made the peasants more willing to purchase a means of self-defense.\n\nHe hummed a half-remembered folk song and drummed his fingers on the dashboard. Things could get dull on the road, with only the engine's growl keeping him company. His thoughts quickly drifted to other matters: the payment he'd get after completing this latest job and finding a mechanic out in the countryside, a difficult task. The truck was an old one, driven in rough conditions, and the engine had been making disquieting sounds for a while. Perhaps he needed to get it checked.\n\nThe sudden rip of a gunshot through the morning air interrupted his worries. Looking behind him, he could see who was responsible. A convoy of brand-new trucks roared behind him, eagles and swastikas painted on their sides, and their occupants, a rowdy band of "Aryan" raiders, fired rifles in the air with glee. He quickly pulled off the road as they sped by, either not noticing him or simply not caring. As he watched them thunder into the distance, two new thoughts entered his head. The first was that his customers would probably not survive the next few hours. The second was that he needed a career change."

Draped in camouflage, they went out of their barracks, sticking close to the undergrowth in cases where a bomber might spot them. In the last few days, the scouts of the Brotherhood had marked blind spots in the German bombing and indicated these in their maps as training spots. There, they would reveal and study the mysteries of war, to train themselves closer to the Viking ideal.\n\nVilem, a new initiate to the Brotherhood, stood at attention in the firing range, while a senior brother explained to them the uses and ways of the rifle. He put the stock against his shoulder and shot, hitting a target. He repeated this two more times, kneeling and prone. He reloaded it and instructed them on how to clear a jam in the firing mechanism.\n\n"And that is how you use a rifle," he said, "a weapon so simple that even you maggots can't fail at it." He walked up and down the line, abusing every member of the platoon. When it came to Vilem's turn, he said, "You fake Aryan! I bet that you will fall on your rifle and shoot yourself. But today, I am feeling optimistic." He laid his index finger on Vilem's chest, pressing it down to emphasize every word, "You will go into the firing range, and you will prove yourself worthy of bearing the blood, am I understood?" Vilem shouted, "Sir, yes, sir!" The brother gave him a slight smile. "Good."\n\nAfter all this was done, the recruits took their turns in the firing range. Vilem proved himself to be a capable marksman, singled out by the brother as being the best in his platoon. At the day's end, the Brotherhood gave him the ultimate honor.

He threw the rifle down and turned towards the line of slaves gathered in the training grounds, "The next one of you Untermensh who fails this, I'll shoot one of you, randomly." He drew his sidearm from his holster and disengaged its safety, pointing it at them.\n\nMikhail's life was not always like this. He still remembered when they came to take him. Writhing in pain and clutching his stomach, he remembered the day when they had come to take him. Gunfire, screaming, the village burned, and its older inhabitants put against the wall and shot. When he arrived at Permhaym, the Brotherhood greeted him and his fellow captives. They divided the group into two, one for labor, one for war. The Brotherhood shepherded the latter out from the city, plainly dressed, in the middle of the day, under watch from sharpshooters.\n\n"Stand up! How long will you lie there?" the Aryan screamed at him. Mikhail got up slowly. "Good. Pick up that rifle, and try again." Turning towards the slaves, he said, "We have to teach you harshly, for you cannot understand." Mikhail shivered and held it straight, correctly this time, against his shoulder. The Aryan wheeled around to find the muzzle of the gun pointed at his forehead. He heard it click and smirked. "We are not stupid, you Untermensh." He drew his baton and struck Mikhail across the sternum. He beat Mikhail savagely until he was black, blue, and bleeding.\n\nSidearm drawn once again, he cocked it.

Just three days ago they had numbered over a hundred; now there were only twenty-four. They had been captured in a raid launched by these so-called "Aryans" against Gayny, and had only surrendered once the ammunition had run out. Evidently this had made an impression on the opposing commander, as instead of shooting them on the spot he had chosen to escort them back to the Brotherhood's territory.\n\nNow that very same commander stood before his assembled prisoners again, and began speaking.\n\n"It is lunchtime, as you may know, and within our barracks," he gestured toward the considerably more well-kept structure behind him, "we are serving hot food and water."\n\nIvan perked up upon hearing this. He and his unit hadn't had so much as a breadcrumb to eat ever since he had been captured, and his only hydration had come from a leak in the roof during the rains of the previous night. Indeed, one was even able to see the faint outlines of the rib cages of several of his comrades.\n\n"But good food," the officer continued, "is something that only the worthy are deserving of. In the fighting three days ago, you all showed that you had the potential for this worthiness, the potential of being Aryan. Potential alone, however, is not enough." At this he drew and presented his pistol, a shoddily-made copy of a German model. "My proposition is simple: Any of you who can use this implement to kill five of your fellows will have proven themselves Aryan enough to join us at the table immediately. Do not," he looked to the soldiers who stood at either side of him, "try anything funny."\n\nIvan considered the officer's words for a long while. After all, had not food and water been the reason he had joined the military of Gayny in the first place? Then his mind wandered to his comrades. The friendships he had developed, how they had fought side-by-side to the last round. No, he thought, shaking his head, he wouldn't do it.

That had been his last good meal; now he was lucky if the slice of bread he received was only slightly stale.\n\nHe'd contemplated deserting many times, but in the end always decided against it. Where would he go? He had no idea where his village was, or even if it still existed, and what if the ones who considered him less than human caught wind of it? The fate of the last one who had openly voiced disobedience sent a chill down his spine. He had concluded that his only hope would be to surrender at the first chance he got, but even that seemed a remote possibility. For all he knew they would just shoot him on sight, or even worse, he would be immediately recaptured.

He looked at his plane, seeing the singed and burning left wing of the plane. He cringed, then felt his legs go weak as he realized how close it was to exploding. It was meant to be a regular bombing raid for the cadets. He was lucky to have even gotten out, let alone land it safely. He heard footsteps nearby, and he turned to face whoever it was.In front of him, Roland saw a small group of men in uniform. It took a moment for him to realize it, but they were of the German Army. Good, Roland thought, he was in safe territory.\n\n"Hello," said one of the men in flawed German. "Are you with the Nazis?"\n"I am an Obergefreiter of the 34th Air Division of the Luftwaffe, sir. I require assistance for my aircraft to reach my home base."\n\nThe men looked at one another in confusion before turning to him, saying "We can assist you, Harr Officer."\nRoland smiled, and stepped aside as they began crowding around the plane. One, the actual speaker, stood off to the side with Roland as they began probing it.\n"Harr Officer, it is an honor to meet a German."\n"You must not get a lot here."\n"Never."\n"Are your uniforms surplus?"\n"Yes, mostly scavenged from what we could find."\n"You have my sympathies -- who is the leader of this Reichskommissariat?"\nThe man didn't respond, and seemed confused. In front of them, the men had taken out tools and began repairing the wing.\n"Do you not know?"\n"We don't have Reykhskommissars, sir. We do have the Fyurer!" The man did a salute, raising his arm in the air as he stared into space.\n"Wait, isn't this Moskowien?"\n"Nein, comrade."\n"You're Russians then?"\n"Yes."\n"But... why are you helping me?""

The village itself had months before being turned into a watchpost, where men pressed into service watched fearfully from the sandbags and towers, hoping nothing more than another day without the sighting of another black devil.\n\nIt had been days since the last raid on this part of the border, and the men had found themselves in a state of uneasy comfort, weary to entertain the idea of peace. One man, the commanding officer of this outpost, knew better than to even let himself feel at home. Scarcely sleeping, his energy, dark bags under his eyes, and his slim physique had given him the nickname of the "Night Bat," one he wore with pride as a testament to his service.\n\nOn this specific dawn, the Bat, having been awake since 0200 hours that morning, he had been inspecting a ridge with some of his comrades, men born and raised in the village proper, one of the last villages left after the rest were abandoned or razed. Looking out across the horizon into a great valley with a forest on the other side, he swore he could see some movement. Subtle, perhaps, but his tired mind thought little of it.\n\nOnly minutes later, he now stood alone. The thought he had earlier caught his attention, and he looked back out across the plain, and saw a great banner. He rubbed his eyes, and, looking again, it now was followed by a mass of black-clad men. Rushing back to the camp, the men knew without him saying.\n\nThe peace was over, and they were here."

His bloody hands, raw from the months of hard labor, died the spade red, and found himself thinking nothing of the dirt he shoveled over the cold, expressionless body beneath him.\n\n"What's the difference between us?" he let his mind ponder. In moments of weakness, he almost found himself envy those he piled high into ditches four feet across, five feet deep. "At least he gets some rest."\n\nNot a year before he would've been shocked to hear he would spend much of his days emptying and refilling holes, much less these ones. A simple existence in a village not far from Ufa, he was one of the few born after the War. He had watched his father go off and not come back in the second one, and the cries of his mother stayed with him ever since.\n\nSix, five, no four months ago, which felt like a lifetime in this hell, an old hunting shotgun was thrust into his hands and his young mind thrown into an open field. The Brotherhood, as they call themselves in a mix of broken Russian and German, came with flamethrowers and bayonets, and without firing a shot Yelsiney ran. He ran and he ran, but it wasn't fast enough. A bullet caught him in the shoulder, and his body thrown onto a truck bound God-knows-where.\n\nBut now, with every thrust of this shovel, his body ages weeks. They toil from dawn till dusk, many sleeping feet beneath the frozen earth. The one constant is the work and the bullets. If only there was a way out... he toyed with the ideas in his mind.\n\nYelisey stopped for a moment. In that moment, so intrigued by the thought of leaving, he dropped his shovel.

No, this was something real and tangible to Lavrentiy and Nadia, who had grown up together long enough to find their first partner in each other, and they were infatuated.\n\nWhile Nadia had her eyes trained on a particularly bright star, she felt his hand gently fall over hers. The feeling in her gut went from the nervous flurry of emotion to a true storm, her heart racing. There they shared this moment, nothing but pure joy in each other's embrace, a feeling so warm and true that they didn't hear the heavy-footed steps of a black-clad soldier. Dressed in pure shadow and his face covered, he had come to take back human cargo, a mission he never failed.\n\nThe bliss of the moment was too much for Lavrentiy to bare. Shifting his head down to look at hers, her amber hair glistened ever so slightly in the moonlight, her eyes dancing from star to star, constellation to constellation. For the first time in his life, he felt that what he was doing was undeniably right. Bringing his hand from hers to her head, he guided her unbelievably smooth face to his. Smiling like a fool, he closed his eyes and leaned in...\n\nBut he never met the lips of the girl who, moments earlier, had been inches from his face. Incredulously, he opened his eyes and refocused his hearing; standing up, he saw her, struggling in the arms of a shadowy figure.\n\n"Hello there, my friend! It would seem you fell asleep with this slave," he said, throwing her onto the bed of a truck.

The men were shot, some of the women too. In barely two hours almost three quarters of the town lay dead in pits.\n\nThe signs had been there for months. Rumors from travellers told of the retreat, and then of the fall, of their old protector. The terrifying stories came soon after, of beasts of men who came to kill, with bloodlust in their mind, not loot or pillage. Stories of hundreds dead in towns of less than a thousand, the rest barely alive themselves. Many dismissed them as rumors, rural legends, until the waves of refugees came straggling down dirt roads clogged with mud.\n\nThose who could leave did, or at least tried, but most had no choice but to stay, to hope their fate would be different. Naive, yes, but hope is the most reassuring liar. Every night they lay in their beds with dread filling their heads, telling them there was still time to leave on the next refugee train, to find salvation in some other poor corner of Russia.

When she was two years old, her father and two of her brothers died fighting against the Germans within the space of a week. A few years after that her mother left the house one night and never returned. Her older sister took care of her until she was old enough to make her own way. Then she had gone from town to town seeking work. Even in the anarchy of the postwar years the Russians refused to hire a Bashkir girl like her for anything more than working on their farms or in their stables. It didn't matter that Russia was gone. The Russians were still the rulers, and the Bashkirs theirs to rule.\n\nThe first real hope Gawhar had felt in nearly a decade came at a time of great despair for the Russians. The West Russian Revolutionary Front had collapsed into infighting, and during that collapse her people seized their chance for freedom. The Bashkirs had reclaimed their homeland and forced all the Russians who remained to accept their new status as equals, not superiors. Their peoples were of different faiths, different cultures, different histories. It was clear that many of the Russians resented losing what small sense of superiority they still had, but that didn't matter. Bashkiria was free.\n\nIt was not meant to last. For a time Gawhar thought her curse had finally broken. But before long the invaders came. They overran Bashkiria, crushing it in its infancy. The new rulers claimed they were not Russians. In fact, they claimed to hate the Russians almost as much as they hated the Bashkirs. But they looked like Russians and they acted like Russians and they spoke Russian.

 PRM_expansion.2.desc: "Of all the warlord states to battle over the ruins of Russia, there were none more hypocritical or contradictory in their ideology than the Mladrossi state of Berezniki. The Mladrossi's ideology of monarcho-sovietism captures the absurdity of Slavic false intellectualism better than any other ideology the Untermensh infesting Russia preach. These sub-humans worshiped not one, but two different forms of oppression that held back the Aryans of Russia from achieving their destiny. The synthesis of these equally flawed but conflicting ideologies produced a government so bizarre and contradictory in its goals it was doomed to failure. It was only a matter of time until one of their neighbors descended upon them and stamped out their flawed strain of thought, and it seems only appropriate that it was the Aryan Brotherhood, the lone bastion of reason and sanity in Russia, that would step in and correct the situation.\n\nThe former members of the Mladrossi have been rounded up and killed. Those who have escaped from our reach will be allowed to live to spread word of our conquest. They will tell the rest of the Slavic parasites how we treat false ideologies such as theirs that seek to undermine the Aryan people. Within Berezniki itself the combat squads are combing the land in search of Aryans to liberate and traitors to be liquidated or enslaved. Already the vestiges of the illogical old government have been torn down. In their place we have installed the policies of the Brotherhood. These policies are based on reasoning and logic, rooted in irrefutable racial sciences not the pseudo-intellectual theories of economics and religion that define the Slavic models of thinking. It will take time and persistence to cleanse the mistakes of the previous rulers but Berezniki will be freed of ignorance. All of Russia will be."

 PRM_expansion.3.desc: "For the second time this century the enemies of the Romanovs, the last true monarchs of Europe, have scattered the dynasty to the winds. While their first collapse was inevitable, for a time it appeared the anarchy that followed the West Russian War might give them a chance to reclaim their birthright. Under Vladimir Kirillovich's guidance they claimed part of their homeland for themselves and prepared to reunite the lands of Russia under the divine rule of the Tsar. But it was not meant to be.\n\nThe Monarchists and White Russian officers serving under the new Tsar had spent years preparing themselves for a second confrontation with the Communists to their north - a rematch between Royalty and Bolshevism that would decide the fate of Russia once and for all. None of them could have guessed their defeat would come from the south, not the north, at the hands of a far viler enemy than the Communists.\n\nThe Aryan Brotherhood had resolved to do what the cowardly, weak Soviets could not, and finish off the filthy Slavic monarchy that had returned to deny the Aryans their own birthright. The two sides clashed in a vicious struggle, but in the end, it was the Brotherhood that was proven correct as their armies overran the Tsarist Untermenshen and rampaged across the fields of central Russia.\n\nNow memories of the brief Romanov revival are already fading. The Brotherhood's victory reduced what might have been the rebirth of a great empire to a historical footnote. In place of the failed dynasty, a new master of the east is rising, not defined by faith and tradition, but by race and violence. Aryan soldiers have burned and defaced the imperial portraits. They have melted the crown jewels down for their gold. In place of the old flag of the empire, the swastika now flies over Vyatka."

This cycle of warfare on the steppe has gone on longer than recorded history, and it seemed destined to continue even into the twentieth century. After centuries of Slavic oppression, the Tatars took their fate by the reigns as the West Russian Revolutionary Front shattered against the might of the Germans. They seized their territory and built a new nation for the Tatar race where they could rule themselves. The Tatars knew from experience that the Slavs would not abide their freedom for long, so they prepared for the next violent chapter in the long history their peoples shared.\n\nHad it been the Slavs that invaded, it is likely the cycle of war between the two subhuman races would have continued indefinitely as it always had. But for the Aryan people to prosper, order had to be brought to the east, and the cycle of violence had to be ended. The Tatars met the soldiers of the Brotherhood with a fierce, barbaric resistance that surprised our Commanders in its intensity. The Tatar soldiers reminded us that the sub-human's inferiority does not make them any less dangerous. Despite this ferocious struggle, our race's supremacy was clear as they were driven back. Even their desperate attempt to ally with their ancient enemy, the Slavic peoples they now ruled, could not halt our attack.\n\nNow we have relegated the Tatar and the Slav alike to their natural status as slave races. We have put an end to their bickering by stripping both peoples of their delusions of freedom or independence. Both are Untermensh, both serve the master race. Any distinction between the two bloodlines is insignificant, and under our rule their fighting has finally ended."

The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth."\n- Deuteronomy 7:6\n\nThe passage left him conflicted. His parents raised him as a Christian. Of course, they also raised him as a degenerate Slav, so that wasn't saying much. The Brotherhood was not explicitly anti-Christian so much as against non-Aryan beliefs. The recent war to crush the Order had certainly exemplified the way that policy could lead to highly anti-Christian behavior. Hell, Hans had participated in his fair share of sacrilege both during and after the fighting. But this passage had him questioning that. Maybe Christianity and the Brotherhood's beliefs were not so different? Maybe the Aryans were God's favored people, a noble race of holy warriors He had sent to reclaim the world and destroy the false prophets who claimed to represent Him? Maybe-\n\n"Hey bookworm!

His life was not prosperous, but it was peaceful, and as Fyodor's mother had taught him it is better to appreciate what you have than to obsess over what you lack. With this lesson in mind, he went through life quite content.\n\nUntil the Aryans arrived.\n\nEven under a declared state of neutrality, Vologda was not immune to the skirmishing and raiding that defined West Russian warfare, but it was usually confined to the border regions. That changed one day when the army placed Vologda under martial law without warning. Soon reports of an invasion filtered in, along with stories of horrific fighting occurring closer and closer to the city. Fyodor recalled the night a low thumping noise awoke him, and only later had he realized it was the sound of artillery in the distance. A few days after that he was in his apartment when a shell struck the building across the street. The army attempted a futile last stand within the city proper, but they were swept aside and Fyodor got his first look at the invaders.\n\nThey wore uniforms of black and grey, wearing coal-scuttle helmets. They moved through the city like a devouring swarm, smashing windows and looting as they saw fit. Most terrifying of all, they flew a flag bearing a symbol Fyodor hadn't seen since his youth, the symbol of the Germans.\n\nA few days after Vologda fell Fyodor ventured out into the streets looking for food. A patrol of the invaders spotted him and dragged kicking and screaming into the back of a truck. It had taken him to the prison camp where he was now.

While the pathetic politicians squabbled and bickered over the minute differences between their false ideologies, they forgot the reality of their situation: They were at war. Bullets do not care about ideology, a lesson they learned too late as our armies bore down on them, bringing the full might of the Master Race with them. Through violence and bloodshed, we have shown them that politics and parties are no more than glorified clubs, their members playing at rulership while the true masters of the earth know only one thing matters: power. Our race has the power to conquer, so their race will suffer what it must.\n\nThe gutters of Komi have been filled with the blood of politicians and party members of every variety. Communists and socialists, liberals and conservatives. The Brotherhood is even liquidating fascists of subhuman blood as we secure control. Their beliefs are unimportant to us. All politicians are inherently weak, compromising creatures trying to cheat their way into power. The Brotherhood has no place for them. In death their ideological differences are meaningless and they are exposed for what they really are. Pests, that the Brotherhood has exterminated. We have taught the people of Komi a lesson that all Aryans have known for years, that democracy breeds degeneracy and corruption that can bring low even the greatest of peoples.

Many of the soldiers, Jakob among them, felt a sense of impending doom at the news. Somehow, he knew he would never see Cologne again, never make the triumphant return home he had dreamed of making. His fears had proven correct when the warlord statelet was attacked by some other bandit horde. The armies of Samara went to battle, and Jakob and his fellow "advisors" went with them. Their presence made no difference. These invaders that flew the swastika for some incomprehensible reason had crushed the well-equipped but poorly led soldiers of Samara and within a few weeks of the conflict's start Jakob had been captured and taken to the prison where he currently wallowed.\n\nHe was snapped out of his self-pity when he noticed a prison guard approaching, followed by a man dressed in an ill-fitting Wehrmacht officer's uniform from the last war. The guard pointed at him and the "officer" stepped forward.\n\n"Are you a German?" he asked in halting, heavily accented German.\n\nJakob hesitated before answering. "Yes.

One driver even managed to get his reclaimed Pantser to start, but proving unable to work the steering or the brakes, crashed through a building before driving into a ditch. It seems that even the German soldiers must learn their mastery of Blitzkrieg, not just inherit it. This has been a source of great frustration and disappointment for both the Brotherhood's military commanders and most trusted racial scientists.\n\nLuckily, some Pantser operators from the ranks of the motor bandits have proven to be of superior blood and are more than willing to train their fellow Aryans in return for expedited admittance into the Brotherhood. Some members of the Brotherhood have protested this, claiming that these men have not purged their Slavic corruption as every Aryan must do. What these fools do not recognize is that by mastering Germanic warfare, these men were already close to pure Aryan status before the Brotherhood even liberated them. Already this decision has borne fruit. Every day more Aryans are being re-trained in the art of Blitzkrieg. Every day more Pantsers roll out of the factories, ready to carry brave warriors of the master race into battle against the unclean hordes.\n\nOur commanders have been eager to adopt the Pantsers into their strategies. They have modified their once infantry-focused doctrines to accommodate quicker, more powerful strikes concentrated on small points of the enemy line. Soon the Brotherhood's armies will be so magnificent that even the Germans shall admire the military prowess of our race!"

He lurched to an infirm posture, suspended over a railing for support.\n\nSomeone shouted, "Comrade Novikov! Push the motherfucking button!" Fighting the overwhelming pain in his chest, Alexi leaned sloppily towards the console to his right, mustering what little remained inside to raise the ship's anchors.\n\n"I have done it!" he shouted as tears welled in his eyes. A sudden explosion followed his exclamation, finishing his descent towards the cold steel floor. A panic attack, then unconsciousness.\n\nA gunshot woke him up, but a severe concussion prevented full awareness. Alexi's fluttering eyes could see the black uniformed men approaching, and on some subconscious level he understood. With little time remaining, memories flooded his mind. A serene picture book to quench his anxiety.\n\nHe thought first of his mother. Her sandy blonde hair and soothing tone comforting him in the candle-light of their Moscow apartment. He tried to savour the moment, remember the boyhood stories she had told him of Lenin and the revolution. However, the historical details evaded him, far less potent than the woman herself.\n\nThe men grew closer in his peripheral vision, punctuating their summary executions of his comrades with disgusting jeers of "Untermensh". They would not destroy his newfound serenity. He thought next of those early days in Plesetsk. Sleeping next to his bunkmates, both nervous and excited to serve. Like the stories of old, before his family had fled, he would too serve the people. A sense of purpose in the chaos.\n\nThe pistol swung before his eyes, and they finally closed for the last time.

He hurried over to his table and unfurled it to take in its full magnificence.\n\n"Well that is beautiful." he muttered under his breath.\n\nHe was looking down at a newly commissioned map of the Aryan Brotherhood's realm. The cartographers had delivered a beautiful piece of work. He'd made it clear they would have to. He struggled to believe that the massive territory that stretched from Erzengel to Kazakhstan had started from almost nothing, just a tiny scrap of land around the bombed-out ruins of Perm. Of course, his race's superiority had meant this conquest was inevitable, but gazing down at the map, seeing the Brotherhood standing proud next to Germany and her colonies, it made him realize the huge odds he had triumphed against to build a pure nation in such a chaotic and impure land. He couldn't help but smile. Somehow, he was sure the great Fyurer was looking down on him with pride.\n\nHe glanced to the eastern side of the map, past the Urals. There were no nations shown there, just a black area labeled "Die Slawische Anarchie." There was still work to be done. Russia was not yet cleansed or safe for his people.

I have half a mind to execute you right now if you don't shut up."\n\nThis sort of arguing has become common among the Brotherhood's leadership in recent days. With Western Russia finally united under Aryan leadership, the time has come to answer several unsettled questions about the Brotherhood's laws. The most important and most divisive of these issues is the official racial policy of the brotherhood. Behind the simple goal of establishing Aryan supremacy lurks a complex web of intricacies that have divided the Brotherhood into competing factions. It seems every officer has their own answer for how the Brotherhood should formally define and divide the races, and any plan other than their own is a betrayal of Aryanism and a Slavic plot. Screaming matches and even brawls have occurred over everything from the legal status of half-Aryans to the different shapes of Untermensh skulls. Fyurer Vagner has become increasingly agitated as he has watched this infighting bring the Brotherhood to a grinding halt. To finally resolve the issue, he has announced he will form a council that will formally define the racial castes of Russia. The Fyurer will head this council himself but it will include several other important figures in the Brotherhood, most notably Zigfrid Shultz. Shultz has become the leader of a faction advocating for an expanded definition of Aryanism that he claims would act as a safeguard against instability and provide a necessary boost to Brotherhood membership. The Fyurer is personally repulsed by his ideas but his supporters are too significant to ignore any longer. When the council assembles in a few weeks' time every faction will have a chance to make their case."

 PRM_regional.3.desc: ""... and lastly, I don't know if you and your thugs are Slavs, traitors, or just cowards!" Vagner roared at the man across the table "But I know you are weaklings and you want to see the Aryan race weakened with you!"\n\nShultz stared back at him. He had hardly spoken all night but somehow that silence was louder than all the Fyurer's shouting. Vagner paused his tirade to catch his breath and Shultz seized the opportunity.\n\n"My Fyurer, I am no coward. I am a proud servant of the Brotherhood, but before all else I serve the Aryan race, and the Brotherhood is failing them. Right now, there are millions of Aryans in Russia who would make exemplary members of the Brotherhood. But they are enslaved. You have labeled them Untermensh because they fail to meet some arbitrary standards you set years ago. It shows strength and wisdom to admit you were mistaken, and yet you refuse to. If there is a coward in this room, it is you."\n\nFor the first time that evening Vagner was speechless. He had entered the room confident of his victory. He had expected the council to be a mere formality, a chance to berate his advisors for their squabbling before they all fell in line. Instead he had watched the tide turn against him. The more Shultz spoke, the more the men seated at the table seemed intrigued by his promises of an Aryan majority within a generation and an end to the slave unrest. Even some of Vagner's closest allies were struggling to hide the doubt on their faces. And now this upstart had the balls to call his own Fyurer a coward!\n\nVagner could see that he still held some support in the room. If he acted now, before Shultz could tip the scales any further, he might still prevail. "I'd recommend you be more careful who you call a coward" he said. "I don't care how many of the boys like you, I won't tolerate another slip-up." He turned to address the rest of the councilors. "Now I say we settle this the only way that seems fair. A vote.""

They remained unfazed by the insults and curses he hurled at them and forced him into a chair facing the long table where Vagner and the other members of the Brotherhood's leadership sat. There was a moment of silence as Shultz tried to recover his breath. He locked eyes with Vagner and tried to lunge at him with his shackled hands, only for the guards to wrestle him back into the chair.\n\n"ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?" He shouted. "You won't get away with this! The people won't let you. They'll shoot you down in the streets like the Zionist rats you are. You're all fucked without me! Do you understand that?"\n\nShultz flailed wildly in his chair looking around the room. Most members of the tribunal looked away as soon as he turned towards them, desperately avoiding making eye contact. The Fyurer smirked and leaned forward, reading off a piece of paper he held.\n\n"Zigfrid Shultz, you are accused of betrayal of the Aryan race, of seeking to corrupt the blood of our people and empower the Untermensh. You are also accused of trying to promote the cause of the ancient enemy, the Slav, and of spreading pro-Slavic propaganda. Lastly you are accused of slander against the German people and attempting to divide the Aryan peoples. How does this tribunal vote?"\n\nThere were awkward murmurs of "guilty" from the other men seated at the table. Vagner smiled. "Guilty. The vote is unanimous. Zigfrid Shultz, this tribunal has found you guilty of the crimes I have read to you. As punishment for betrayal of the Brotherhood and the race I sentence you to death." He turned to one of the guards holding Shultz in the chair. "Do it."\n\nThe guard drew his pistol from its holster and before Shultz had a chance to protest he shot him in the back of the head. The other members of the Brotherhood recoiled as Shultz's body slumped to the floor but Vagner walked towards it and gave it a playful kick.\n\n"Leave him in the woods, traitors like him don't deserve a burial.""

Every day it seemed like his title of Fyurer was more and more ceremonial, while Shultz and his gang were giving the orders. Something had to be done. He could not allow them to destroy the Aryan race, not when it was so close to victory.\n\nHe heard the door to his office open and he looked up, startled. He had ordered his guards not to let anyone interrupt him. Standing in the doorway was Shultz, staring at him.\n\n"Zigfrid, what are you doing? I'm not taking appointments now. Go find my secretary if you want to meet."\n\nShultz walked towards him, his hands clutched behind his back, not speaking a word. He wasn't even looking at Vagner. He was surveying the office.\n\n"I don't know what the fuck you think you're doing but I am out of patience with you. You have 5 seconds to get out of my sight before my guards come in and teach you not to interrupt me again."\n\nShultz met his gaze, and Vagner noticed something had changed. The calm arrogant attitude he usually had was gone. His eyes were wide and there was sweat on his forehead. He began walking towards the desk. Vagner pressed the button underneath his desk that would call his guards into the room.\n\n"We have let your tyranny continue for too long, Gutrum." Shultz finally spoke in a hoarse whisper as he rounded the desk. "You have butchered and enslaved the true Aryans and worshipped the Jewish puppets in Germany. It cannot go on! The race must survive."\n\nVagner slammed the button again and again but no one came. He started to open the drawer where he kept his pistol but it was too late. Shultz pulled a dagger from behind his back and plunged it into his neck. A stream of blood sprayed across the wall as Vagner fell to the floor. After a moment it was all over. Shultz wiped the blood from his face and turned towards the door. One of the guards was watching him. "Are you alright sir?" the man asked."

The rattle of dozens of hammers striking rocks over and over surrounded her. The women of the 89th Komi Slave Battalion had been out here since before dawn. The sun was now high overhead, beating down on them as they toiled away. Nadya was feeling faint. They had cut the morning meal last week, and it would be hours until it was time for the evening one. She hadn't had anything to drink since last night and it was getting harder and harder to focus on her task. Her mind kept slipping back to the time of the republic. It felt so long ago. Had she really been an organizer with the Communists? It was hard to imagine that there had ever been a version of her that was so outspoken. Surely someone like that could never wind up where she was, smashing rocks at gunpoint for genocidal madmen. Maybe it was all a fantasy, and she had always been the quiet, cowering creature she was now.\n\nA moment's distraction was all it took. The angle of her swing was slightly off and her hammer came down six inches away from the rock, directly on her left foot.\n\nNadya let out a howl of pain and fell to the ground, clutching her shattered foot. The slaves around her looked at her but only paused their work for a moment. They all knew the consequences of stopping.\n\nThe sound of approaching footsteps cut through the agony, and Nadya turned to see who it was. The chief guard was approaching, his rifle slung over his shoulder. He reached out his hand to her. Astonished, Nadya accepted it. He helped her up and put her arm over his shoulders. "What is your number?" he asked.\n\n"3842" she replied.\n\n"Well you won't be any use with that foot. Let's get you into the shade. Don't worry about working for the rest of the day."\n\nShe nodded, unable to believe her ears. The guard helped her into the shade of a tree and helped her lie down. The pain in her foot was now a dull throb, but Nadya paid it no mind. She had not seen mercy like that in a long time."

Being appointed a guard had technically been a promotion but he sometimes wondered if it was really a punishment. His old sergeant never liked him, and he would have been the one to recommend anyone in the squad for slave duty.\nOne of the slaves stopped for a moment and walked towards the pile of rocks. Hermann eyed her, wondering if she would try something. He halfway wished she would. It had been months since the last attempted escape and he'd gotten a chance to actually use his rifle. The slave grabbed a rock and carried it back to where she had been and started hammering away at it. Hermann grumbled under his breath "Bunch of fucking cowards." There was no question at all that if he were in their place he wouldn't just lie down like a weakling. He would use his hammer to bash the skull of the first guard he found and lead the other slaves in a revolt. How fun that would be! Of course, you couldn't expect that kind of genius from the real slaves. They were Untermensh, after all. Their brains weren't developed enough to think freely.\nHermann was thinking this over when a cry cut through the sounds of the hammers falling. He turned to see the source, and saw a slave across the yard curled on the ground, bawling and clutching at her foot. He unslung his rifle and started to walk over to her when he saw sergeant Blumfeld was already on it. He watched his sergeant reach the slave and, to his astonishment, help her to her feet and guide her over to another tree. Hermann couldn't believe his eyes. Sergeant Blumfed was one of the proudest, most patriotic Aryans he had ever met, and here he was showing mercy to an Untermensh! The sergeant set the slave down, then turned away from her and walked over to Hermann. "Private Stahlman," he said. "Could you take a note for me?"\nHermann pulled a notepad and a pencil from his bag. "Certainly, sir."\n"That creature's number is 3842.

On the first day of his training there had been over a thousand men standing with him. Now there were less than four hundred. Pytor was still standing, but there were more trials ahead. One day the instructors broke them into groups of 25. Pytor's group was led to a concrete shed and ordered inside. The interior was a bare windowless room with a dirt floor. Once everyone was inside the instructor told them their trial was to stand silently until ordered otherwise. He locked the door and left Pytor and his comrades standing in the dark.\n\nThe first day wasn't difficult. Pytor's eyes adjusted to the darkness. His legs grew stiff but he avoided cramps by shifting his weight. His stomach started to rumble in the evening but he was no stranger to hunger. The most difficult part was staying awake. One of the men fell asleep and toppled to the floor. Almost immediately the instructors opened the door and dragged him out of the room before relocking it. He didn't even protest as they carried him away.\n\nOn the morning of the second day one of the instructors opened the door and asked if anyone wanted to forfeit. No one stepped forward. The instructor nodded and locked the door. Midday was when the hunger really set in. Pytor could feel his stomach protesting, demanding something, to fill it. He tried to focus on the rewards that awaited him when he passed this trial, the privilege and prestige of being a part of the army. He had wanted that for so long and now he was close. His stomach was getting louder.\n\nOn the morning of the third day the door opened again and two men crept out. The survivors were ordered to insult them and for the first time in 60 hours Pytor heard his own voice as he hurled verbal attacks at the cowards. The third night would be his breaking point. After three days without food or sleep, three days of licking condensation off the walls for water, he snapped. He started to sob. It seemed like the only sensible thing left to do. The door opened and two instructors came in and pulled him out of the dark room. Pytor couldn't care less about the mockery from the men still inside.

Igor was one such scholar. Long called a madman for his theories about the Russian people and their genesis, his work had found new life under Velimir's new regime. Now with proper funding, Igor was finally able to do the work he always wanted: to unlock the secrets of Russia's true ancestors: the ancient Hyperboreans.\n\nToday, Igor had stayed up late reading a tome containing particularly fantastical accounts of the ancient super-race which he believed all Slavs, and therefore the Aryans, descended from. In the book, which was barely holding together from decades of wear and tear, the Hyperboreans are described as a highly sophisticated race that once dominated the entire planet, and were potentially extraterrestrial in origin. Igor found himself completely flabbergasted by this claim. Could it be that more Aryans existed beyond the very stars in the sky? The hours went by, and the night dragged on, but Igor was still intensely captivated by the book. The wild theories, the mythical origins, the innate superiority! Even an old fool like Igor couldn't help having his mind race thinking about all the wonderful possibilities this book had implied about the Aryan people.\n\nWhen the sun rose that morning, Igor had achieved little sleep, but had gained nearly more esoteric knowledge than his mind could handle.

In front of the Fyurer was his propaganda minister, who eagerly awaited his leader's input.\n\n"Fantastic. Simply fantastic", a grinning Fyurer Vagner said, his focus still on the leaflets he was rifling through. "These papers are to carry our message across the world. I want them in every town, on every street our neighbors have. They will know, one way or the other, that their future is Aryan." The pleased propaganda minister standing before Vagner took a bow.

On the other hand, the leaflets denounce those who would consider themselves "allies of the Jew", and state that all "sub-humans" of Russia will soon be "shown their proper place as subordinate to their betters". Accompanying the text is a heroic depiction of a soldier in a German uniform, clearly inspired by Nazi iconography.\n\nIt is not hard to figure out where this propaganda is coming from. The Aryan Brotherhood, the strange Germanophiles who border our nation, have long been both a curiosity and an annoyance.

We have been exceedingly clear regarding our motivations, and even our adversaries will not contest our firm commitment to the instillment of proper values into the Aryan people. Despite the self-evidence of the loyalty of the Reichsführer-SS to the infallible doctrine of National Socialism, our agents in the farmost eastern stretches of the Vaterland report that he is falling under criticism from the unlikeliest of sources: the Slavic bandits that overran the land past the Ertsengel-Adolfshtat line.\n\nWhat little information that trickles in from that blasted hellscape tells us that an "Aryan Brotherhood," a pale imitation of the National Socialist movement, has consolidated power in West Russia from its center in Perm. They claim to represent the purest strain of Aryan thought and have already denounced the Reykh as the puppet of Jews and Freemasons. Even the Ordensstaat isn't good enough for these men; they rail incoherently against the alleged decadence and insufficient zeal of the Reichsführer-SS.\n\nAlthough they claim to have serious consequences in store if we do not immediately reform the Ordensstaat in accordance to their demands, we can safely ignore them. They are fools sorely misinformed about their lineage, and none of their hyperboles pose any serious threat to the only truly National Socialist state on Earth."

Velimir did not look at his foreign minister as he posed the question, his attention instead drawn towards the map hanging on the wall of his office. The intricate cartography had been commissioned by the High Priest's late predecessor, and now remained as one the few remnants of the Vagner regime.\n\n"I only see hated enemies of our Boreal Rus'. Subhumans and Zionist puppets as far as the eye can see." Viktor Bezverkhiy's response was coldly matter-of-fact.\n\n"It is more than that, Viktor. Consider that not a single nation on earth shares the same goals that we have. We stand alone in this struggle, and only have ourselves to rely on." The High Priest turned to his minister, looking him straight in the eyes. "I intend to send a loud message to the world, signed in the blood of our enemies. Those who have thrown their lot in with the Jew will learn to fear us one way or the other."\n\n"The world does not take us seriously, Velimir. We must prove them wrong."\n\n"Perhaps, then, we could start with reclaiming our rightful Aryan identity. Those arrogant Germanics continue to think themselves the master race. I suppose they cannot help it of course, their small minds are sadly quite prone to such crude delusions." Velimir gave a slight chuckle. "Perhaps it's time we let the mongrels know who the superior race really is. What do you think?"\n\nBezverkhiy smiled. "I'll make the arrangements.""

As your Fyurer, it is my solemn duty to ensure that all are living the lifestyle a good Aryan should, no matter your background or occupation.\n\nThe purpose of this particular pamphlet is to lay bare the secrets of raising a proper Aryan child. Indeed, you may think that your blood alone is more than enough to ensure your place in our society, but this is not true! The secret to achieving Aryanhood lies in the mind as well the body. The key to ensuring our Reykh's future is secured is to know how to shape your children into true Aryans; a people worthy of claiming the legacy I have built.\n\nSECTION 1: THE EARLY YEARS\n\nFrom the moment of their birth, the child must be immersed in activities that will ensure their minds are focused on matters of race and people from the very start. This will not only build a sense of racial consciousness in the most absorbent phase of the child's development, but will make the next section much easier.\n\nIt is well known that the easiest way to learn a language is when one is young, so what better time to teach your child Deytsch than right now? For those who are still learning this glorious tongue, take care not to speak Russian around your child. This generation absolutely MUST be the first to speak Deytsch as a first language, cementing our Aryan legacy for centuries to come.\n\nNow, as for hammering in the natural roles of one's gender..."

 PRM_regional.26.desc: "Our scouting foray into West Siberia has concluded, and our agents have much to report. It would appear that the forces of the Black League were successful in defeating their opponents scattered amongst the Urals, their ruthless methods winning them governance over the whole of the region. But the Black League's leader, Dmitry Yazov, was less successful in putting an end to an insistent rebellious undercurrent pervasive throughout his newly established 'Siberian Black League'.\n\nPavel Batov, former aide to Konstanin Rokossovsky and orchestrator of the resistance to Yazov, was able to accrue power for himself amongst strict loyalists to the deceased Karbyshev, and attempted a seizure of power after Yazov's untimely death. Batov now rules the so-called Russian National Reconstruction Committee-but his rebellion failed exactly where Yazov succeeded. Local elements were able to reassert themselves after Yazov's passing and enact the fall of the Black League, ending Yazov's brief unification.\n\nThe west of Siberia has now returned to a state of anarchy, led by minor despots that demonstrate no loyalty to Batov's new regime, and little will even to cooperate with it. West Siberia remains as weak and divided as it has ever been, and it is unlikely that these bickering warlords could possibly mount an effective combined resistance to our forces. West Siberia will be easy pickings."

One of the warlords of the Urals managed to stitch much of West Siberia together by force, only for it to unravel again upon their surprise defeat by the Zlatoust Republic.\n\nThe armorer's state has not pressed their advantage after their unlikely victory, failing to effectively counter-attack and maintain control over the territory of West Siberia once held by their attacker. Instead, they have merely set up client states, divided across the Urals, possessed by minor local warlords and politicians nominally loyal to Zlatoust; that is to say, loyal to money.\n\nOur scouts further report that while the economy of West Siberia is in a fully functional state, the defenses possessed by these new Zlatoust allies are ill-manned. Most of the good fighting men died or fled at the Zlatoust Republic's own hands, and the clients they established in the wake of their victory-though obviously well-armed-lack for real experience and are both poorly coordinated and poorly led. It should not be difficult for our own forces to triumph where West Siberia's would-be unifiers failed."

The two kneeling men, soon-to-be initiates into the Brotherhood, followed along dutifully. After several days of elaborate rituals, their entrance into the ranks of the master race was just minutes away. As they spoke, the recruiter looked each one over and made his judgements. The first was a lanky peasant with cold blue eyes and a cruel countenance. He was nothing more than a jumped-up farm boy out for blood. A thug, not an Aryan. The second man was far more intriguing. As far as anyone could tell, he was only a recent arrival to Permhaym, pulled there inexorably by his vision of paradise. His zeal practically radiated off of him, and it was clear from his words that he was a talented speaker. The men, their oaths recited, waited patiently for the recruiter's next instructions. Rather than speaking, he pulled his revolver from his holster and threw it down clattering onto the floor.\n\n"Whichever one is worthy, kill your compatriot."\nWithout hesitation, the outsider scrambled to the gun and fired a round into his partner's throat, the round abruptly cutting off his protests. As the dying man gurgled noisily on his own blood, the recruiter was overjoyed. He had been right to see the newcomer's potential! "Brother, congratulations. You are officially a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, with all the privileges it entails. Tell me, what is your name?"\n\n"Zigfrid Shultz, and I intend to advance far in the Brotherhood's ranks.""

Permhaym was a spider web of intrigue, members of the "Aryan" class constantly sharing choice pieces of potentially damaging information in exchange for favors and support. No one fascinated and frustrated Permhaym's network of informants more than a figure by the name of Zigfrid Shultz. Just who was this man? What brought him here? How was he climbing the ranks so quickly? Wild conspiracies were as natural as air to the Aryans; each had his own theory.\n\n"I'm telling you, he's a foreign agent. Abwehr or CIA or something. Why else would he come here out of the blue?," one would say to his fellows.\n\nAnother would riposte: "That's a crock of shit. I think he's related to the Fyurer. It's complete nepotism."\n\nA third, silent until now, would chip in, shocking his brethren. "I've met him, you know. The man's a political visionary. He'll be running this place some day, mark my words."\n\nA hurricane of attention and speculation seemed to follow Shultz everywhere he went, and it only grew in magnitude as he continued his ascendency through the Aryan Brotherhood's power structure. Even the Fyurer took notice. Whoever this outsider was, he certainly had charisma. Could this be something to take advantage of, or was it best to hold Shultz down before he rose too far?"

Evidently, Shultz knew this fact well, for he stopped there on a speaking tour just weeks after his arrival. After thanking the announcer, he took to the podium and spoke with an intensity unusual even for Permhaym's hardliners.\n\n"Brothers, Aryans, fellow members of the master race. You have been lied to. The Zionist in his endless trickery has infiltrated even those nations that profess Aryan values, bending them inextricably towards his will. The Third Reykh is but a tool by which the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy directs the populace to a false racial consciousness, leaving the leaders untouched. Do not be fooled! The true Führer of Germany is the Jew, and only the Slavo-Aryan master race has the capability to overturn his tyranny and free its homeland once and for all."\n\nShultz ranted in such a manner for some time, evoking confusion and fascination in equal measures from the crowd. One audience member, a secret representative of the Fyurer, contemplated in silence. Shulz's theories were unusual, but his zeal was impressive. Perhaps he could be of use to the Brotherhood."

The rest of the political prisoners crowded around the podium, a miserable lot sentenced to the forests forever.\n\nA priest of Svarog uttered a prayer, pleading the deity to give him and his race strength against the forces of darkness. "Hail Perun!" answered the prisoners, Sergei could only manage a grunt. He looked about. A flock of ravens flew across the grey sky, spurred on by the northern wind that could kill even the strongest of men. Sergei tried to hug himself with his bony hands, wrapping them around the rags he called clothes. One of the ravens descended to feast on some poor soul, expired during last night's purification ceremony. If only I could get the bird... Sergei felt his stomach grumble. Rations won't be for another day.\n\nThe camp commander handed a scroll to the priest: "Hear, hear! The old Russia is dead, but we, the true Aryans of this Earth, are its legacy! There was a time when the world quaked in fear upon the mention of the old empire, what the Byzantines called Hyperborea! The North is home to these people yet, us Hyperboreans! In time immemorial the civilization was home to the bravest of warriors and holiest of men. It was a land of plenty, where the rolling fields ripened with endless crops, under Svarog's light!"\n\nSergei had heard that speech before. Bread and promises, bread and promises, one prisoner groaned too loudly and was dragged off.\n\n"Hyperborea will be the name of the new Russia, which will crush the lesser Aryans in Germany, undo the grave damage inflicted by the Jews!

A line of worshippers had assembled below the podium, carrying sacrificial lambs and sacred objects. The procession began with chanting by an unseen choir, deep voices speaking in forgotten tongues. The worshippers, blond maidens dressed in white cloth, brought forth their offerings, one by one. Velimir drew the sacred hammer of Perun and brought it down upon the head of each sheep until none were left. The chanting grew louder until the Brotherhood itself joined in, singing of ancient glories and the wrath of Belobog, who shall soon descend to the Earth and cleanse it of degeneracy.\n\nAn hour later, the choir had ceased and the last of the worshippers left the room. Velimir then spoke: "Brothers, I am honored to accept the position of High Priest of Hyperborea and all Rus. Destiny lies before us, woven by the norns of yesteryear, whose moving voices shape history. They have visited me in my sleep and claimed that we are the heirs of the Aryan race. Our future is to the East and West, to reclaim the rest of Russia from the heathen, to liberate the West from the degenerates who styles themselves superior." The Brotherhood nodded in approval, dark figures applauding the High Priest, their hearts trembling as they sensed what they were destined to accomplish.\n\n"But Hyperborea is just the beginning. Perun wants us to fly Southward, towards old Palestine, ruined by the Jews. We must not hesitate in our push into Asia, where the ancient lands are being settled by Eastern filth.

Civilizations rise and fall, but they remember old Hyperborea. May Belobog illuminate the righteous path.\n\n"They are here, my lord."

He fell upon frozen grass, and he saw a group of officers unloading other 'cadets' from trucks. His arms scrambled until they caught something furry - he twisted, a whimper, a thud. The hounds backed off. Alex stood up only to be knocked out by a crowbar. His last vision was that of a rabid soldier standing over dead meat.\n\nAlex was awoken by the firing squad. He grabbed his head, memory betrayed him - flashes, he remembered a village, a patrol car, a shovel... The barrack door opened, in came the priest. Alex stood at attention, but his spirit was dying. Before he knew it, he was dragged off to the center of camp, alongside a thousand other degenerates. A man pointed a gun at Alex and ordered him to run ten miles on the track, lest he go to Niefelheim. He struggled and heaved, encouraged only by cracks and thuds, unworthy cadets purified by lead. Alex looked at the barracks in the distance, for a moment he thought a woman stood there, begging him to defend home.\n\nAlex cried, but the days came and went with no relief. A thousand slavs became a hundred walking dead, and they envied failures. Every morning before the barn's feeding, an officer would read them charges: "Failure to pray, to achieve Aryan devotion, to appreciate the High Priest's justice..." Alex had gotten used to the beatings too, thirty lashes for dissidents, a thousand for 'conspirators'. The last trial arrived, but Alex didn't know how much time had passed since he was brought here; his mind was occupied by faint memories of defending those he couldn't remember. He was told to run across twenty feet of burning coals, the final task to be considered worthy of serving in Aryan infantry. He witnessed many men fall, scream, burn, and die. On his turn, he flew. Even thunder in the distance could not silence the priest, an unending lecture of defending the Aryan race.

Alexei protested in between coughing fits. The scary priest turned around, his weird smile replaced with something far angrier.\n\n"Now, now, young man, you don't want to see a doctor. They use modern medicine, which was invented by the Jews to weaken and poison Aryans. Your parents haven't been feeding you any of that Jewish filth, have they?" His parents shook their heads, and the priest's smile returned, and he seemed to relax. Alexei was allowed to wash his face off, and his parents took him home, where he returned to bed. Ivan had gotten the same thing last summer, and the doctors had made him all better, and yet the scary priest man didn't help at all! Alexei would have thought about how angry the scary priest man made him feel even more, but he was feeling sleepy. So sleepy."

 PRM_yemelyanov.16.desc: "Marat listened to the birds heralding the dawn outside his cottage as his tea kettle whistled. Marat and the other Tatars around the village had heard weeks ago of Hyperborea's claim to their region, and of course they all lived in fear for a few weeks. However, things had quieted down as the relatively remote village had seen nothing of the mysterious nationalists. But as Marat poured his tea as he did every day, a deafening sound laid claim to the morning's silence.\n\nMotors roared through the village as the wheels of trucks dug into the dirt road leading through the hamlet. Stepping over to the window and parting his curtains, the old Tatar watched swastika emblazoned vehicles roll into town. The lead truck's door was thrown open and out of the passenger seat slid an officer who approached the first person he saw. The bearded captain pointed at a young woman watching intensely from her porch. She froze as the man began speaking to her, and though Marat could not hear their conversation, it still shook him to the bone. After a curt exchange, the woman nodded toward Marat's front door.\n\nA knock came soon after, and Marat reluctantly went to answer it. Pulling the creaky old thing open, he found himself standing face to face with the officer. With a gravelly voice, he began to speak before Marat could get a word out. "Are you in charge?"\n\n"Y-yes, what seems to be the issue?" Asked Marat.\n\n"On orders of Velimir, a natural preserve will be built nearby."\n\n"Oh, well, well that's lovely. What's this got to do with us?"\n\n"We'll need help from the locals."\n\n"Well, alright. Where is it to be built?"\n\n"Here." The old man froze as he noticed the officer had cocked his gun. After a split second of pregnant silence, a shot was placed directly between the Tatar's eyes. Marat was dead before his already cooling corpse struck the ground. The Russian turned to the other soldiers as they piled out of the trucks, "Burn the houses. If the subhumans don't leave, make them.""

He turned on one foot towards the seated commanders.\n\n"Who said that? Tell me now, which one of you was it? Was it you, Shnayder?" The commanders all immediately looked at General Shnayder, confirming his guilt.\n\n"I fucking knew it. Always with the stupid goddamn questions with you, isn't it?

Now he was to be carefully examined for his racial purity, which made Aleksandr nervous beyond belief. Despite his appearance, he was half-Kazakh.

Even when Dirlewanger himself died, and the brigade was no more, he followed some of his fellow bandits, only because it was easier than finding something new.\n\nNow, though, as he wandered through the towns of Russia, the place of the inferior Slavs, he was not only tolerated, but welcomed. The magistrates and authorities, more often than not, gave Stefan special privileges, including the raiding of so called 'inferior villages'. Stefan was confused, more often than not -- hadn't he been one of the men responsible for some of the most evil atrocities imaginable?

Arms shot out in perfect imitation of their German counterparts as the guards showed their leader proper respect. As the doors closed behind him, Vagner suppressed a glower at his counterpart, his back turned to the Fyurer, eyes set gazing over Permhaym. The obvious disrespect was almost too much to bear, but Schultz has his uses, not even Vagner could deny that.\n\nHe turned, a stony smile on his face, the older man in his custom uniform, so unlike Vagner's. Black, like a consuming shadow, a forgotten atavism from the Aryan past. Who was he, this Schultz? Emerging from the wasteland with a head full of myths and dreams, he had captured the minds of many within the Brotherhood.\n\nIt was a vital discussion, one to determine the direction of the Aryan military. Vagner spoke with careful words, details of schematics, battle plans, clever aping of Wehrmacht doctrines. Schultz grunted and howled, raving about berserkers and the brute majesty of violence. The rapier met the battle-ax, an absurd duel. How could Schultz avoid the careful precision sting of the rapier? How could Vagner overcome the brutality and crushing blows of the battle-ax?

Of course, this naysayer leading such an effort is that wasteland wanderer, Schultz.\n\nAs they often did, and always away from the rest of the Brotherhood, the two giants did battle on matters of blood and race. Vagner repeated his underlying thesis, that Aryanism was achievable by the lesser races through rigorous physical and mental trials that would shatter any lesser minds.\n\nSchultz, crawling from behind his Hyperborean bier, parried. To this einherjar of days past, the rigors of Aryan testing ought to be relaxed to allow for more Slavs to be inducted into the Master Race. The titans of Aryanism battled, swinging fists against tables, voices bellowing with passion, power, and rage.\n\nTo relax standards was anathema to Vagner, for to do so was to dilute the race with substandard, alien blood. Schultz, in speaking about relaxing standards, was only undermining his Fyurer. This chieftain, though powerful and influential, must not seek to embarrass and discredit his king - yet sometimes the words of a chieftain were enough to lead to changes.\n\nTo this end, after shouting, debating, and arguing, they could both agree that there was ultimately a single question to be answered here. While Schultz's words were backed by his own conviction, it was the Fyurer who possessed the authority to answer.\n\nWhat, then, shall it be?

Report to your local Brotherhood headquarters to find out."\n\nIt was stupid, absurd, the whole charade the Brotherhood played at. However, he had no choice but to play in this ghoulish game. He saw the slaves, whipped and beaten, begging for their lives. He had begged, scraped crumbs from the gutter along with them. But the poster promised that, perhaps, he didn't have to.

The Brotherhood was small and ill-equipped to fight such a war, but they had emerged victorious anyway. He had drawn his own blood in penance that night for doubting his avatar, but lingering worries remained.\n\nGorm had read the plans, had spoken with other officers.

The madness of Vagner's advance had swept aside the disorganized subhumans of the west, ravaged as they were by German bombs - but the warlords of the east were more hardy and prepared.\n\nThe wars would grow more frequent, more difficult. Gorm, bandaging his thigh, wondered if the current pace could be maintained. The Slavs, he knew, would need to be exterminated. They would never willingly Aryanize, and as the armies marched east, rebellion would be rife in the west. There was, however, another way.\n\nSchultz, the newest high priest of Aryanism, had whispered forbidden truths. What if Slavs, not the Germans, had always been the Master Race? An army of willing Slavo-Aryans, unhampered by constant slave rebellions, could make great strides into the east. What if all they had done thus far had been in error? Not the conquests, but the annihilation of potential recruits? Could the Brotherhood survive in its current state?

Whispers, terrible rumors of treachery, had reached his ears. Not all who bore the blood of the Aryan were as loyal to their chieftain as Vagner had once believed.\n\nIn darkened biers, officers held clandestine, Mithraic, meetings. The Old Gods of the Slavs, Rod, Perun, Veles, and others, dripped from the forked tongues of liar-priests and hidden cultists. Who had inspired once loyal Aryans, even a few directly under Vagner's command, to pray at the altar of the subhuman?\n\nYemelyanov.\n\nThat name appeared again and again on the dossiers his loyal spies brought to Vagner, like a foul incantation.

Of course, the soldiers near her village had spoken Russian, not Deytsch.\n\nThe Brotherhood guards wasted no time in herding the slaves towards their destination, forcing stragglers back into line with rifle butts and fierce blows. Some of the slaves wept bitter tears, others stared glassily ahead. A shovel was pressed into her hands, and only then did Alyona realize they had reached the gates. The lettering above the doors was in Latin characters and she could not read it, but knew instinctively it was Deytsch.\n\nThe interior was as bleak as the exterior, and the jabbered commands of the guards and the frantic pointing of rifles commanded her to dig.
