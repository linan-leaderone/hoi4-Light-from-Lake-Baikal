  ##### Ministers Description ######
  PRU_Carlos_Moreyra_hog_desc: "§YPresident of the Council of Ministers\nSecond Vice President\nConservatism§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1898, Moreyra is an engineer and politician. He served under Prado as Minister of Development and Public Works, where he disagreed with Prado's policy of playing both sides during WW2. Postwar, he worked in the Agrarian National Society until Prado's return to Peru in 1956. As keeping the door open for Japan lost Prado support from the landowners, Moreyra convinced him to join the ACDN, and became Prado's second vice President. After Beltrán criticized Prado's government, Moreyra mediated, and Beltrán became Minister of Economics and President of the Council of Ministers, or Premier. Following Beltrán's resignation, Moreyra took over as Premier, and remains a close friend of Prado.§!"
  PRU_Alvarado_Garrido_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nConservatism§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1907, Alvarado Garrido has been a lawyer and diplomat for a record 40 years, teaching in the UNMSM and PUCP as a professor, and served as ambassador to Bolivia in the 1950s. His long and stellar career has impressed Prado, who appointed him Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1960. Alvarado is tasked with dealing with the Ecuadorians, and keeping good relations with the US and Japan.§!"
  PRU_Gallo_Porras_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance and Commerce\nFirst Vice President\nConservatism§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1894, Gallo Porras is one of Peru's most outstanding politicians. His post as mayor of Miraflores and Lima during the 1930s gave him invaluable experience. He joined the ACDN in 1955, and was Prado's running mate in the 1957 elections. After Beltrán resigned as Minister of Economy and Finance, Gallo took his place, and continues to be one of Prado's closest friends in these trying times.§!"
  PRU_Ricardo_Elias_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Government and Police\nConservatism§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in 1906, Elías Aparicio is an experienced lawyer. Commissioned by the Benavides government in 1938 to investigate Germany and Italy's penal systems, Elías became interested in Peru's own penal system. This led him to later work for the military and police. Appointed Minister of Security by Prado in 1960, Elías is presently worried about the ominous silence in the north, and sporadic terrorism in the countryside.§!"

  ### Leader Description ###
  POLITICS_MANUEL_PRADO_UGARTECHE_DESC: "Born in 1889 to a wealthy family and son of ex-President Manuel Ignacio Prado, Manuel Prado Ugarteche is a civil engineer who became one of the major players in Peruvian politics during the 1940s and 50s. Rising through the ranks, he was tapped by President Oscar R. Benavides to be his successor, and won the 1939 election. Prado continued Benavides' suppression of the outlawed APRA and PCP. As the Nazis invaded Poland, Prado's government changed the course of Peru with a new foreign policy. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Prado publicly supported the US and the Allies to keep Peru's good relations with Washington, but he kept the door open for the Japanese as an option. By 1944, the war seemed undecided, yet the US still stood strong. So Prado kept his 'neutral' foreign policy, up until the fateful day that Pearl Harbor was erased in a flash of blinding light, and the US signed a conditional surrender to the Axis Powers.\n\nStunned by how the mighty northern giant had fallen, Manuel Prado was yet convinced that he had made the right choice, expecting that everything would remain normal. After his term ended, he left Peru for the US and Canada. He watched from afar as his homeland descended into chaos, then returned to a semblance of normality. That normality convinced him to return in 1956 to run for the 1957 elections, but he couldn't run without popular support. His close allies convinced him to form an alliance with Beltrán called the Alianza Conservadora Democrática Nacional and work with Manuel Odría. The fateful 'Pact of Monterrico' was sealed, where Prado would win the elections as the ACDN candidate, in exchange for sweeping Odría's corruption under the rug. In his second term, Prado lifted the National Security Law but kept the ban on the APRA and UR while releasing some of their most moderate members. He also worked successfully with Pedro Beltrán to stabilize the economy.\n\nIt's been five years since Prado became President, and yet so much more needs to be done. With elections looming, factionalism in the ACDN, the investment war, and the threat of APRA, Prado prepares to make his final moves before he leaves office. He will continue in his traditional tactic - that of doing nothing until everything goes back to normal. It has worked before, it will work again. §RRight?§!"

  POLITICS_FERNANDO_BELAUNDE_TERRY_DESC: "Born in Lima on October 7th 1912, Fernando Belaunde, more commonly known as Architect Belaunde by his followers and the Peruvian press, is at once both your typical Peruvian Politician and something out of the box and complete. Born to a very prominent aristocratic family with a long line that goes back to Lima's first Spanish inhabitants and with two times Peruvian Prime Minister Rafael Belaunde as his father, Belaunde had a comfortable and promising youth.\n\nAfter studying in the United States, Belaunde would come back to lima and become a rich impresario and extremely famous for his academic and architectural works. Through his father's connections, he would serve many political appointments, which he would only need to abandon during the time of Odria's regime. He would get involved in politics by founding the National Front of the Democratic Youth, a group of young reform-minded activist which launched his candidacy in 1956 against Manuel Prado. After achieving 2nd place in that election, he would transform the NFDY into a full-fledged political party, Accion Popular (AP). Based on his ideas of Peru as a Doctrine, he would visit and create AP arty cells in every Peruvian city he visited, and he visited them all. Which would make him the most well-known and vocal opponent of the Prado Administration.\n\nNow after achieving what he couldn't in 1956, Architect Belaunde has a long job ahead of him. Many plans are about to be set in motion but if he has the political finesse that his predecessors didn't only time shall tell."

  POLITICS_LUIS_BEDOYA_REYES_DESC: "Born on February 20th, 1919 in the Peruvian port city of Callao, Luis Fernan Bedoya Reyes had a humble yet prominent upbringing. From a very young age, he was known as an intelligent and prodigious man, which would lead to him graduating with top marks at San Marcos University, the oldest higher education institution in the Americas. He would then conduct a promising career as a lawyer.\n\nInspired by the ideals of Christian Democracy since his student years, he would be one of the very first members of Peru's Christian Democratic party (PDC). Due to the PDCs coalition with Belaunde's Accion Popular in the 1963 election, he would be named as Minister of Justice by the Belaunde Administration. Due to his distinguished ministerial tenure, he would be made the Belaunde-backed candidate in the Lima Mayoral elections of 1964. Where he would defeat the popular Ex-First Lady of Peru, Maria Delgado de Odria, by a sizeable margin. In his administration, he would be known as the most productive Mayor in Lima's history, where he would earn the country's admiration for his achieving massive results without any links to corruption and bribery. After becoming disillusioned with both Belaunde and the PDC, he would create his own Political party, the Peoples Christian Party (PPC), a Party that would be able to lead the country to its needed reforms while also being true to the ideals of Christian Social Doctrine.\n\nNow he has achieved what many could and yet could not have predicted at the same time. He has indeed climbed to the top of the greasy pole, Peru's Presidency. By perhaps a stroke of luck or a benign twist of fate in times when the world's democracies lie endangered, Peru may have been landed with the best person to build up its own democracy into longevity. It will be a wonder if the Andean country can keep its lucky streak."

  POLITICS_MANUEL_ARTURO_ODRIA_DESC: "Manuel Arturo Odria is nothing if not a very typical kind of political figure in Latin America, for better or for worse. Born 26 November 1896 in the Peruvian province of Tarma to a family of renowned military tradition. This would inspire him to join the Army from a very young age, where he was distinguished amongst his peers as an intelligent and disciplined soldier. This would lead to his steady rise in the army ranks to the point of becoming one of the Generals in the Peruvian High Command during the First war with Ecuador.\n\nIn 1947 he would become Minister of War for the administration of President Jose Bustamante y Rivero after an APRA terrorist attack. After Bustamente refused to make APRA an illegal organization again Odria alongside the rest of the Peruvian Armed Forces would depose him in a coup in October of 1948. After a completely fair election in 1950, Odria would be legitimized as Peru's President. His administration would be characterized by popular Infrastructure Programs, such as Peru's national stadium, and the expansion of Peru's national insurance program. It was also characterized by the persecution of APRA and very violent repression of its militants. Forced by both internal and external forces, those being of the OFN and the United States, to re-democratize the country in 1956, Odria would pass the presidency to the eventual winner of that year's election Manuel Prado Ugarteche, with whom he had previously agreed that he would peacefully step down in exchange that Prado would not investigate the many corruption allegations against him.\n\nNow after Peru's civilian political class failed once again, Odria has returned to the presidency and the job he started on the revolution of 48 shall be finished, whether the Yanks like it or not!"

  #####  Ideas of Peru   ######
  #############################
  PRU_idea_fake_democratic_dream: "The False Dream"
  PRU_idea_fake_democratic_dream_desc: "On the surface, Peru appears to have a strong and healthy democracy. Of course, the truth's far more complex once you dig deeper. Democracy was restored in 1939 with the election of President Prado, only to face its hardest challenge with the Battle for Lima. Peruvian democracy triumphed, and the people believed it was finally strong enough... but rumors of electoral fraud in the 1950s under the Odría government hurt its image again, with accusations of a guiding hand always manipulating the voting polls.\n\nCan Peru achieve the long lasting dream of democracy, or will history repeat itself again? We must be careful attending this issue. If we fail, the dream dies, §Rand the people's faith in democracy with it.§! But if we succeed, §mdemocracy will be finally realized§!."
  PRU_idea_silent_liberation: "The Silent Liberation"
  PRU_idea_silent_liberation_desc: "After the Battle for Lima, the pro-APRA northern regions continued to rebel against the Bustamante and Odría governments, until one day they stopped... and there was only silence. Our soldiers report no firefights, our policemen confidently tell us that everything is under control, and the citizens continue as if nothing happened. But to Lima, this silence is a bad omen. We need to keep the north in check, §Rbecause we know that the Aprists are still there, hiding...§!"
  PRU_idea_two_super_powers_one_economy: "Two Superpowers, One Economy"
  PRU_idea_two_super_powers_one_economy_desc: "Since the signing of the Akagi Accords and Prado opening up the economy to Japanese investment, there has been an economic investment war between America and Japan in Peru. Peru, in many political theorists' eyes, can be Japan's entry point into South America; accordingly, both nations have been heavily investing in Peru to achieve their objectives.\n\nInvestment from both the Rising Sun and the American Eagle was courted by various Presidents of Peru throughout the 50s, with President Odría attracting millions of yen of investment into Peru from Japan. American investment remains strong however as they are unwilling to let a single nation drift into Japan's sphere without a fight.\n\nThere are frequent American-Japanese economic clashes, especially in the Northwestern Industrial and Oil Refinery zones in Talara. If Peru can continue courting investment from both superpowers, they can expect riches to flow into the country. However with riches comes problems: inequality has risen with rich Japanese and American families taking large swaths of wealth from this investment and becoming as rich as Peru's upper class. While Peru is benefiting economically, there is a backlash amidst the working class of Peru which, if not dealt with effectively, could result in a return of violence in Peru."
  PRU_idea_peru_diverse_problems: "A Diverse Country with Diverse Problems"
  PRU_idea_peru_diverse_problems_desc: "Once the heart of the Incan Empire, our beautiful country is filled with different cultures and traditions, from our mestizos, to the foreign migrants, to the natives. But with just as many peoples comes just as many problems. The last governments and those before them have neglected agrarian reform, integration of the jungle, development of the Andean regions, and many more. Even the people protesting over all of these issues couldn't sway them to do something. We won't repeat their mistakes! Sooner or later, we'll address these problems once and for all. And if we succeed, §nwe will earn the people's lasting trust.§!"
