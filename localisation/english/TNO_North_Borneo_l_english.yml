 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_BABA_MASAO_DESC: "The British belongings in Borneo always held a special place in the Japanese plans in their quest of the Asian dominance. For a time, the oil resources of the island were objects of temptation for the economic giants of the Empire and its strategic position amidst the shipping routes between East Asia and Australia proved to be invaluable for reinforcing the Japanese units across the battlefields in Asia. After the short and triumphant campaign of the Japanese forces in Borneo, the former British territories were reorganized as a domain for the military, to be held by a strong-willed and determined commander. This man was Baba Masao, the general of the 37th Army, once fancied as the Borneo Defence Army.\n\nA hereditary army officer and student of the Prussian discipline, Baba saw his career's upheaval during the Japanese war in Indonesia, paving his way through victories against the Americans. Subsequently, he became the commander of the garrison in Borneo and its military governor, a post he held ever since for his past glory, remaining unchallenged by his rivals and enviers. Befitting for a Japanese military ruler, Baba ruled with an iron fist, not shying away from any brutal methods to suppress any attempts at resistance and enforce his will. A believer in the Japanese supremacy above everything else, he furthered the Japanese assimilation policies in the region and turned it into a playground for the Japanese monopolies each seeking to get their share of riches from the island.\n\nAs North Borneo was turned into a heavily militarized and entretched zone following the course of the war and its aftermath, the former British protectorate became the outpost for the Army in maritime Southeast Asia. Maintaining its strong presence at the border with Indonesia, the 37th Army under Baba serves as a reinforcer of the Japanese hold in the Greater Sunda Islands and as a 'supplemental' force to the collaborationist governments, should they fail to hold the anti-Sphere insurgencies by themselves."

 NRB_The_37th_Army: "Home of the 37th Army"
 NRB_The_37th_Army_desc: "The famous, or perhaps infamous Baba Masao commands the 37th Army, which is directed to maintain its garrison in North Borneo. Nominally ensuring that the interests of Shonan and Indonesia are protected, in reality, the 37th Army's sole purpose is to ensure that the strategic port of Kuchin does not fall to dissidents and rebels hiding within the Bornean jungle.\n\nComprised of the 56th Mixed Infantry Brigade and the 71st Mixed Infantry Brigade, it is quite a weak force in comparison to others across the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but their invaluable combat experience ensures that their lack of manpower is made up for in skill. Needless to say, there is no North Borneo without the 37th Army, lest Japan lose their sole directly-controlled foothold in the Spice Islands."

 NRB_Extremely_Underfunded: "Extremely Underfunded"
 NRB_Extremely_Underfunded_desc: "It is undeniable to Baba: the administration he runs operates on a budget to budget basis. His men's wages, the maintenance of heavy weaponry, infrastructure projects, all are subject to the whims of Tōkyō and its backstabbing kleptocratic politicians.\n\nHowever, as an honorable general, Baba remains resourceful as one can be in a situation like his, and simply puts in a notice to the Imperial General Headquarters every quarter to request lobbying in favor of an increased budget. Regardless, more yen is needed if the administration is to function at its highest point, rather than at its most conservative..."

 NRB_Sarawak_Independence_Movement: "Sarawak Independence Movement"
 NRB_Sarawak_Independence_Movement_desc: "Before the North Borneo Administration, there was the Raj of Sarawak, and in the northeast British North Borneo. While British North Borneo, or perhaps more appropriately Sabah, submitted more easily to foreign control due to its lack of native rulers for some time, Sarawak maintained its own Raj and government.\n\nSomewhere in the suburbs of Canberra, the last Raj to reign, Vyner of the House of Brooke, continues to maintain his contacts with pro-independence elements in North Borneo in addition to OFN leaders, in the hope of returning to his native land. With this competent government-in-exile posing a threat to Japanese interests in Borneo, it will be quite difficult to fully cement our hold on the territory of Kuchin and its surroundings with this threat at hand..."
