 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_AUNG_SAN_DESC: "Revolutionary, Socialist, Traitor, Collaborator, Founding Father.\n\nAll of these words describe Burma's founding father Aung San, depending on who you ask. Born to middle-class beginnings in 1915 as Htein Lin, Aung San was forged to become one of Burma's many legal functionaries - at least until he became involved with the Burmese revolutionary nationalist movement. From then on, the trajectory of his life changed rapidly, as he quickly became a household name within the Dobama Asiayone, or the "We Burmans Association." Arrested in 1939, fate would strike Aung San's hand towards another direction again when Japanese officer Keiji Suzuki approached him in Rangoon - a relationship which would at least last for another decade.\n\nWhen India fell in 1943, Burma was finally granted independence - but power was shared between Aung San's revolutionary nationalists in the military and Ba Maw's Sinyetha, but this was not to last. Ba Maw had few allies, and the Japanese recognised this crucial weakness. On a fateful day in 1952, Bo Hmu Aung and Ne Win marched on the Presidential Palace in Rangoon, and forced a plebiscite among the Burmese legislature that nominated Aung San as interim President.\n\nAung San finally achieved his dream, but the credits do not roll there. The state is a ramshackle entity as rebels plague the countryside. The spiritual leaders of Burma reject Aung San's secularism hand-in-hand with their landlord allies. The looming shadow of Japan still holds over Burma, and Aung San has no way out other than his inspiration and close ally Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose - who is more preoccupied with freeing India once and for all.\n\nA great man with great ambitions requires great sacrifice. The question is, how much is too much?"

 ## Minister Descs ##
 BUR_Ne_Win_hog_desc: "§YPrime Minister\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LThere is no better way to describe Ne Win other than a smiling tiger hiding in the grass. Even his birthdate is uncertain, only known to his Thirty Comrades. All there is to know about his pre-revolutionary past is that he was born into a Hakka family in Pyay District, and was vocally trained as a doctor. Despite being expelled in 1931, he would then apply the same precision and surgical skill he did in university to his military ambitions, joining U Ba Sein and Thakin Tun Ok's faction within the Dobama Asiayone in 1931.\n\nAs the Japanese entered the heartlands of Burma beyond the Thai border in 1942, Ne Win was quickly assigned to create guerrilla networks behind British lines to disrupt them with great success and stunning skill. This experience proved to be invaluable, as Ne Win knew the ins and outs of guerrilla warfare - a skill useful when pitched by Ba Maw against Smith Dun's rebellion following Burma's independence. However, Ne Win started to develop his political ambitions for a Burma which can stand on its own two feet - and thus he and Bo Hmu Aung marched towards Ba Maw's palace on a fateful day in 1952.\n\nNe Win was quickly appointed as Aung San's deputy, and he became infamous for establishing the Tatmadaw's reputation as a stunningly efficient, but brutal anti-guerrilla force. Four cuts was all it takes - inspired by Japan's actions in Northern China, but the guerrillas' resolve merely rises and rises, and the Tatmadaw is overstretched. Some say it is due to civilian interference that the rebels have not been quashed yet, and like a tiger in the grass, some also say Ne Win is merely waiting for the right moment to strike against those who stand in the way of a great Burma.§!"
 BUR_Thakin_Nu_for_desc: "§YMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nLeft-Wing Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LA lawyer by training, U Nu was born into a respectable family in 1907, before entering the field of law in Rangoon in 1929. In the university, he met Aung San, and an unbreakable bond was formed between the young revolutionaries. From university rectors, to local police, and eventually the British, Aung San and Nu became revolutionaries through thick and thin - at least until the Japanese came.\n\nDespite his reluctance to enter the field of battle, U Nu kept strongly to his Marxist ideals even after the 1954 Constitutional Amendment, whereby communism was banned under threat from Japan. U Nu was sheltered by his connection to the Bogyoke however, but his comrades were not - and neither were his distant brothers in the Communist Party. For now, U Nu's dream of a democratic, just and socialist Burma remains a mere dream - unless drastic actions are taken to change the fate of the nation.§!"
 BUR_Thakin_Mya_eco_desc: "§YMinistry of Finance\nSocial Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LAung San's network of revolutionary allies relied on youthful elan and brotherly friendship - and none exemplify those values better than Thakin Mya despite his relative age. Born in 1897 in Pyay District, he was vocationally trained in the sciences, but quickly became involved in the nascent nationalist movement. Despite not being a member of the Dobama Asiayone and being a senior to Aung San, he quickly became a trusted confidant and advisor to the Bogyoke. Despite being not vocationally trained, he gave his best, negotiating the Shonan Agreement of 1945 which saw Burma become formally independent following the end of the Pacific War, and kickstarting Burma's economic development. The future was bright for Burma, but the story does not end there.\n\n17 years after independence, Burma is still stuck in Japan's shadow. Instability still rocks the young nation, and the government does not hold all the areas it claims in practice. Thakin Mya has persevered for many years, but the reality of Burmese independence is the toughest challenge he has faced in 65 years of living, and the 3 decades of being an independence fighter.§!"
 BUR_Bo_Hmu_Aung_sec_desc: "§YMinistry of Defense\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LBorn as San Hlaing to a family of farmers, Bo Hmu Aung's life began with an interest in religion. An avid reader, he spent his youth studying and memorizing Buddhist literature. Before he could pass his senior exams as a monk, however, he returned to the countryside and made a living out of farming. The turmoil of the 1300 Revolution would set him on the final path that he would walk: that of a revolutionary.\n\nBo Hmu Aung became a member of the Thirty Comrades: those who had answered Aung San's call to study military training abroad. Burma's independence in 1943 induced him to return. Nine years later, he and Ne Win would march into the Presidential Palace in Rangoon, forcing a plebiscite that resulted in Aung San's appointment as interim President. Now, he serves as the regime's chief of staff, directing the Tatmadaw's brutal, if efficient anti-guerrilla operations.§!"

 ### Ideas ###
 BUR_idea_suspension_of_the_1953_constitution: "Suspension of the 1953 Constitution"
 BUR_idea_suspension_of_the_1953_constitution_desc: "The §Y1953 Constitution§! was supposed to be a new beginning for Burma, a pluralist constitution where freedom of worship, freedom of language and regional self-government was to be respected. The years following its promulgation however, has been nothing but a spit in the face of the values penned on its parchment - with the §eTatmadaw§! seizing power over regional assemblies in the name of national security, and the very suspension of representative democracy itself. Leaders in Yangon constantly deflect the cries of the people by proclaiming its restoration when the nation is secure. The only question is, when?"
 BUR_idea_suspension_of_the_1953_constitution_tt: "--------------\n§LShould the §YConstitution§! be suspended for longer than necessary, a §RPopular Reaction§! will spark against §wAung San§!.§!"

 BUR_idea_an_union_in_perpetual_conflict: "An Union in Perpetual Conflict"
 BUR_idea_an_union_in_perpetual_conflict_desc: "Ever since the §LThais§! and the §WChinese§! descended upon the valleys of §JShan State§! from the Northeast, our country has seen nothing but conflict. When the §VCommunist§! and the §iKaren traitors§! took up arms against the homeland, the only thing that it brought about was more strife and misery. Our troops in the trenches far beyond Mandalay write of home, but they could only dream of it - and day by day, more and more unpatriotic elements garner steam, a coming storm against the dark days already upon our nation."
 BUR_idea_an_union_in_perpetual_conflict_tt: "--------------\n§LShould the §RInsurgents§! in the Northeast be not dealt with in a timely manner, more will see the §Rfailures§! of the §QUnion§! and reject its authority.§!"

 BUR_idea_the_fading_star_of_the_father: "The Fading Star of the Father"
 BUR_idea_the_fading_star_of_the_father_desc: "Our legendary §wBogyoke§! had been a true and tested fighter of the nation, one who would give his whole heart and life to the safety of the §QUnion§! and our people. However, some believe he is being targeted and threatened by corrupt, derelict and treasonous elements - elements which seek to destroy what he has sacrificed and fought for his whole life. Should a conspiracy be exposed, the rats which seek to challenge the legitimacy of his rule will be flushed out: with extreme prejudice."
 BUR_idea_the_fading_star_of_the_father_tt: "--------------\n§LShould §wAung San§!'s legitimacy drop too low, the §eTatmadaw§! will take §Rdrastic measures§! to protect the §wBogyoke§! and the nation.§!"

 BUR_idea_a_government_of_six_miles: "A Government of Six Miles"
 BUR_idea_a_government_of_six_miles_desc: "§wAung San§!'s government, though revolutionary, do not control much §Rbeyond the six miles surrounding the City of Rangoon§!. Religious authorities, landholders, and other opponents of the regime conspire to halt the state's influence beyond a nominal area. However, §wAung San§! is not content to wait the status quo out. In the halls of the Presidential Palace, the DAA draws for itself a radical reconstruction plan. §wAung San§! believes that this will be the answer to many of Burma's woes. Others, however, are not so sure."
