 WORLD.20.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Collapse of the Triumvirate"
 WORLD.20.d: "In the wake of the bombing of the Triumvirate conference in Malta, it would appear as though whatever chances the fragile alliance had went down in the flames. The incident proving to be the final straw for many, both the caudillos and the Turkish President have now declared their respective countries' desire to leave the alliance. With two of the alliance's three major powers leaving, it is safe to say that the days of the Triumvirate are over.\n\nAlready Turkey has made fresh calls for its territorial rights and ambitions in the region to be respected, particularly in regard to Cyprus and the Levant, with the Italian military being mobilized in response to Turkish movements in Syria. On their part, the Iberians have expressed little desire to keep up significant relations with their former allies, Iberia instead looking inwards toward its own problems."
 WORLD.20.a: "It was only a matter of time."

 WORLD.23.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Expansion Into Africa"
 WORLD.23.d: "West Africa has had it rough since the end of the Second World War. Luftwaffe units based out of the Reich's holdings in Central Africa have, for the past two decades, bombed anything inland into dust.\n\nWith the death of Hitler and the collapse of the Reich, those Luftwaffe units haven't moved in a long time. Already, several small nations on the coast have begun expanding their borders inland, free from the fear of constant German bombing. Whether the bombing resumes or not, only time will tell."
 WORLD.23.a: "Interesting."

 WORLD.35.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The South African War"
 WORLD.35.desc: "Violence erupted across South Africa today as the Afrikaner Volkstaat, angered at what they have perceived as endless attacks on themselves by the South African government, formally declared its independence from the [SAF.GetName].\n\nAccompanying the declaration Boer militias, carrying mostly German armaments, have spread out across the Orange Free State and numerous other parts of Northwestern South Africa, coming into armed conflict with South African soldiers stationed in the area.\n\nAs the conflict continues to escalate, it is currently unknown what exactly the German response will be. Yet as observers report increasing militarization of the South African border by the newly formed Afrika-Schild, many consider the German response to be self-evident."
 WORLD.35.a: "For freedom!"
 WORLD.35.b: "A perfect opportunity..."
 WORLD.35.c: "They'll doom us all!"
 WORLD.35.d: "Africa in chaos. Typical."

 WORLD.36.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Afrika-Schild Invades South Africa"
 WORLD.36.desc: "As the Boer rebellion rages on, international journalists on the ground report that German colonial panzer divisions are now pouring across the South African border in a rapid escalation of the conflict. The forces of the newly formed "Afrika-Schild" have already won several key victories, forcing the already stretched South African soldiers to retreat south in disarray.\n\nWith the OFN having expressed support for the South African regime for the better part of a decade, the feeling on the ground was captured by rapidly circulating footage of a battle-scarred South African soldier, part of a convoy of soldiers retreating to Port Nolloth, asking the cameras the question many have been asking:\n\n"Where the hell are the Yankees?""
 WORLD.36.a: "Truest allies!"
 WORLD.36.b: "True glory shall be had!"
 WORLD.36.c: "True snakes!"
 WORLD.36.d: "True chaos! When will it end?"

 WORLD.48.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Formation of the Afrika-Schild"
 WORLD.48.desc: "With Germany still consumed by the chaos of civil war and many of its territories becoming plagued with conflicts of their own, German Africa has today announced its intention to weather this terrible storm. Whilst the three German African colonies have previously only enacted cordial yet basic relations with each other, a joint declaration from Siegfried Müller, Wolfgang Schenck and Hans Hüttig has announced the creation of Afrika-Schild.\n\nOfficially an alliance only defensive in purpose in order to ensure stability within the colonies, many international observers have expressed concern about what the alliances true intentions in Africa may be. Whilst the OFN has condemned the "immoral, colonial alliance", many within the German sphere have praised Müller in particular for his dedication to protecting German interests and personnel across the continent."
 WORLD.48.a: "We stand together."
 WORLD.48.b: "A worrying development."

 WORLD.68.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Freedom for Angola?"
 WORLD.68.d: "As the South African War continues to envelop Southern Africa, a baffling report has come back from the capital of Südwestafrika: early in the day, half a dozen of Luftwaffe transports planes took off heading to a destination unknown, amongst its passengers Reichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck, his closest aides, and their families.\n\nIn an even more shocking turn of events, the Reichskommissar's private doctor, Jonas Savimbi, proceeded to make a speech on Radio Luanda hours after the plane left, declaring himself President of an independent Angola, and calling his citizens to take up arms and defend the newborn nation. Thousands of Ovimbundu militiamen, alongside native SS units stationed at the rear have already pledged allegiance to the new President, with fighting between them and their former Schild allies already erupting across Angola."
 WORLD.68.a: "Wait, what?"
 
 WORLD.70.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Agreement Ends Aleutians Crisis"
 WORLD.70.desc: "The weeks-long standoff between Japanese and American fleets around the Aleutian Islands has concluded as both superpowers begin a scripted withdrawal from the Northern Pacific. The plan, mediated by Mexican president López Mateos, also calls for the U.S. to release the Japanese pilot, Captain Asoh, whose capture overflying U.S. waters sparked the crisis.\n\nWhile conflict has been averted, hostility between the two Pacific powers remains at heights unseen since the Second World War. Tokyo's claims of American treaty violations in the demilitarized islands have gone unanswered, as have Washington's demands for a formal apology and compensation. The aerial collision near Attu and multiple rounds of warning fire exchanged by both sides serve as stark reminders of how close the world came to war."
 WORLD.70.a: "Boiling the ocean, one cup at a time."
 WORLD.70.b: "After this betrayal, there is no going back."
 WORLD.70.c: "When they fight, we win."
 WORLD.70.d: "A hot war avoided, a Cold War reignited."

 WORLD.71.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Twilight of Civilization"
 WORLD.71.desc: "Washington D.C., Germania and Tokyo sit in rubble, nuclear fire having scorched them from this Earth in a matter of moments. Across the world, power stations fail, clouds of ash blot out the sun, and astronauts from various nations watch as the lights blink out one by one like dying stars.\n\nThe world is silent, as the final struggle comes to a close. Without commanders, the armies no longer fight, without a port, the navies drift at sea, and without a home, refugees cover the landscape, tearing apart what few nations were not directly brought down by the devastation of nuclear warfare.\n\nWell over half a billion are dead from this great, and possibly last, conflict, and those few experts remaining expect the number to triple in the aftermath, if not worse."
 WORLD.71.a: "By God, what have we done?"

 WORLD.104.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Gods of the North"
 WORLD.104.desc: "Reports have slowly begun filtering down from movement in the distant communes of Siberia. What it is, really, we can not say, but the fact that any form of news is leaving that region alone has set many to wondering what exactly could be happening. Surely, if the communes are making any kind of stir for the first time in twenty years, it must be in some form important.\n\nReports speak of stirrings from the religious. Those few traders who make their way that far north over the East Siberian trade routes have spoken of entire communes chanting in prayer, of churches being filled to the brim, and of some figure pushing them onward. Nobody knows exactly what has spurred this action, but the people of Siberia keep praying for one man.\n\nThey call him, the Father.\n"
 WORLD.104.a: "Nothing but nonsense."

 WORLD.341.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Verona Conference Opens"
 WORLD.341.d: "Since the death of Benito Mussolini, the first duce of Italy and creator of fascism, Italy's commitment to fascism has been fading. And for that today, 1 June 1963, is a historical day for Italy and her people, the winds of change are blowing as the Congress in Verona has been assembled to determine the future direction of Italian Empire.\n\nWhat this direction will be is bound to the conference; the arguments will be made, agreements will be reached, tensions will rise, hostilities will be soften and eventually a pathway for Italian people will be reached. As Duce Ciano makes his opening speech, international observers listen in excitement as one of the largest colonial empires of the world may loosen her iron grip over her subjects and people, or not. The Verona Conference will decide her fate."
 WORLD.341.a: "Interesting."

 WORLD.342.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Verona Conference Ends"
 WORLD.342.d: "Today, Verona Conference, the assembly gathered together to determine the future direction of Italian Empire, has come to an end. As Duce Ciano made his closing speech to the congress, it seems after so much heated debating and furious arguing, majority of the congress come to an agreement with Ciano, approving his mandate. Roaring masses of people are celebrating in the streets from Verona itself to Sicily, church bells are ringing, choirs are singing as the long anticipated reforms are in the way now, all thanks to Duce Ciano!\n\nNot everybody is happy with this result of course. Carlo Scorza, the political rival of Ciano, left the congress room in frustration during duce's closing speech, reports are coming all around Italy about Black Brigade violence and street fights with celebrating people. Yet, the path is now clear for Italy and her people, they only need to follow it.\n"
 WORLD.342.a: "An interesting development from Italy."
 WORLD.342.b: "Long live duce Ciano!"

 WORLD.343.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Verona Conference Ends"
 WORLD.343.d: "Today, the Verona Conference, the assembly gathered together to determine the future direction of the Italian Empire, has come to an end. As Duce Ciano made a half-hearted closing speech, it seemed the majority of the congress agreed with Carlo Scorza, a renowned traditional fascist and political rival of Ciano. His supporters all around the empire are rallying in the city squares, showing their support for Scorza and his ideas to make the empire strong once again!\n\nNot everybody is happy with this result of course. Duce Ciano himself is clearly disappointed with the result, as his mandate is denied and Scorza has questioned his power as duce; people who were anticipating reforms to the empire continue to protest. Yet, the path is now clear for Italy and her people, they only need to follow it."
 WORLD.343.a: "An interesting development from Italy."

 WORLD.344.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Verona Conference Collapses to Itself"
 WORLD.344.d: "Today, the Verona Conference, the assembly gathered together to determine the future direction of Italian Empire, was supposed to come to an end. Congress, as expected, argued and debated in heat, yet nobody thought it would caught in an eternally bickering state like this. Neither Duce Ciano nor Carlo Scorza managed to get the upper hand, and after realizing the debates are going to no where, both Ciano and Scorza left the congress in frustration. The moment they left, all the congressmen first started to exchange insults, then punches; congress fell to chaos that is more resembling of a bar fight than an assembly to decide the future of one of the greatest nations on Europe.\n\nSupporters of both sides flocked to the streets, to claim superiority over the other which already turned into street brawls. A time of instability awaits Italy and her people, unfolding into unexpected developments."
 WORLD.344.a: "Another nation of Europe falls to chaos."

 WORLD.345.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Italy Wins the Italo-Turkish War" #cianos deal
 WORLD.345.d: "For years, the border disputes between Turkey and Italy have been a major cause of disagreements between two allies. The high tensions between two Mediterranean countries peaked after the collapse of Triumvirate, leaving no obstacle before a war. Turkish troops had finally invaded the Italian Middle East. Italy did not stand idle for against the Turkish aggression and a small-scale war between two former allies broke out.\n\nAfter the Turkish war machine ran out of steam, the front stalled and Turkey got bogged down in a stalemate they could not break. Gaining the clear upper hand in the war, Italy proposed a peace treaty with the terms of reparations from the Turkish government and a demilitarization of the Damascus region, terms which have been reluctantly accepted by the Turkish government. Peace once more rules the Middle East now."
 WORLD.345.a: "Peace in the Middle East, huh?"
 WORLD.345.b: "An inspiring victory for Italian Empire!"
 WORLD.345.c: "We have been humiliated."

 WORLD.346.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Turkey Wins the Italo-Turkish War"
 WORLD.346.d: "For years, the border disputes between Turkey and Italy have been a major cause of disagreement between them. The tensions peaked after the collapse of Triumvirate, resulting in conflict. Turkish troops had finally crossed into the Italian Middle East. Italy did not stand idle for against the Turkish aggression and a small-scale war between two former allies broke out.\n\nTurkish troops managed to blitz through the Levant and become masters of the region. Gaining the clear upper hand in the war, Turkey proposed a peace treaty with the terms of Italy ceding the Lebanon in exchange for keeping the Levant, terms which have been reluctantly accepted by the Italian government. Peace once more rules the Middle East now."
 WORLD.346.a: "Peace in the Middle East, huh?"
 WORLD.346.b: "We have been betrayed by our former ally!"
 WORLD.346.c: "Turkish territories are united once more!"

Gaining the clear upper hand in the war, Italy proposed a peace treaty with the terms of handing over the Damascus region to Italy and Mosul to Iraq, terms which have been very reluctantly accepted by the Turkish government. Peace once more rules the Middle East now."

 WORLD.355.b: "An inspiring victory for Italian Empire!"
 WORLD.355.c: "We have been humiliated."

 WORLD.430.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Bal Thackeray Wins the 1967 Indian Elections"
 WORLD.430.desc: "Today, against all odds and predictions, Bal Thackeray and the Shiv Sena have won the 1967 general elections in the Azad Hind Government. Thackeray's positions have been described as xenophobic, far-right, and even genocidal, going against India's traditional trends of being relatively left-wing and shocking many in the process.\n\nBeing a key player in Mohan Singh's previous regime and allegedly being the main perpetrator behind Operation Searchlight, Thackeray was still largely considered a dark horse candidate in Azad Hind. However, with his radical policies of expansionism, hatred of foreigners, and belief in 'Akhand Bharat', the world waits in fear and anticipation of Thackeray's next move."
 WORLD.430.a: "And yet, the world did nothing."
 WORLD.430.b: "God help us all."

 WORLD.432.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Ziaur Rahman Wins the 1967 Indian Elections"
 WORLD.432.desc: "Today, among many accusations of voter harassment and conspiracy against India, Ziaur Rahman and the Mukti Bahini have won the 1967 general elections in the Azad Hind Government. A leader of Bengali nationalism, Rahman won on his popular platform of supporting the total dissolution of Azad Hind by 1970, and to be replaced with states representing the minorities of the Biharis, Bengalis, and Assamese.\n\nRahman's election has been welcomed with support from the OFN and the Republic of India, while being condemned by the Sphere and its allies. Whether or not Rahman's goals can be achieved shall be seen."
 WORLD.432.a: "Joy Bangla!"
 WORLD.432.b: "Great to see a familiar face in India."
 WORLD.432.c: "Let's hope we don't lose our grip."
 WORLD.432.d: "Is this the end of Free India?"

 WORLD.462.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Pakistan Becomes Independent"
 WORLD.462.desc: "Since India clutched its independence from the grip of chaos following the Second World War, it has been considered something of a powderkeg to international observers. Marred by issues of ethnicity, religion, ideology, and circling foreign vultures, the upstart nation has had much on its plate.\n\nSpecifically brutal among these problems was the infamous division between Hindus and Muslims, a state of affairs that has finally, albeit chaotically, been resolved today. Fearful of perpetual Hindu domination, the northern Muslim minority has seceeded in its entirety, declaring a new state known as 'Pakistan'.\n\nMigrations to and from Pakistan have begun in earnest across the subcontinent, as have particularly brutal incidents of violence. Spectators are divided on this development, with some worried about the increasing violence gripping the region, and others praising a solution to the long issue of religious tension. Time will tell what reaction India and her neighbors will exert.\n"

 WORLD.463.desc: "The Iberian Ministry of Development, the government body in charge of the maintenance of the Gibraltar Dam, has announced today that Iberia will no longer fund the operations needed to keep the dam running and that only vital maintenance will be carried out to ensure the megastructure doesn't collapse.\n\nThe Gibraltar Dam, the star of the German Atlantropa project, was built in the late 40s and became Iberia's responsibility after the German economy crashed in the 50s. Due to Iberia's economic problems and the dam being a bottomless funding hole, the megastructure has been left alone and the world now holds its breath as the collapse of the dam would lead to millions of casualties and the possible destruction of all the countries that have been affected by it."
 WORLD.463.a: "There are bigger issues at hand."
 WORLD.463.b: "Pray it doesn't break."

 WORLD.464.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Iberia Announces the Creation of the Iberian Council"
 WORLD.464.desc: "With a nation formed under such circumstances and whilst maintaining an authoritarian culture as Iberia did, it should come as no surprise that ruling in an effective way would be hard. The Iberian caudillos have hence announced that to support their effort to stabilize and further unite their new union they would establish an advisory council of state officials whose sole job it shall be to advise on matters of state.\n\nTheir direct influence on policy should be negligible, yet in reality analysts have predicted that the council could be used by either caudillo to gain an upper hand on any political disagreement between the two. Consequently, it's been deemed that the council may act counterintuitively in further dividing the two nations instead of uniting them. Further coverage will likely shine a light on the effectiveness of this new Iberian 'reform'."
 WORLD.464.a: "A good measure, for sure."
 WORLD.464.b: "This isn't progress."
 WORLD.464.c: "A useless organization for a weak state."
 WORLD.464.d: "The fascists erect a new facade."

 WORLD.465.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Iberia Announces the Creation of the Iberian Council"
 WORLD.465.desc: "Today the Caudillos Franco and Salazar jointly announced the creation of the Iberian Council. After pausing for a brief while to allow for thunderous applause, the two alternated at intervals to further discuss and justify their new system to the vast crowd attending.\n\nAccording to the two men, the responsibilities and duties of Iberia are vast, and navigating them has left shambles of their efficiency. In order to preserve their ability to govern, they have had to delegate some of their powers to a separate - but very clearly lower - council, consisting of appointed officials. This 'Iberian Council' will handle measures regarding the creation of legislature for the union. However, the two caudillos will still have the final say on anything being proposed. Formally, this will allow the pair to run the other functions of the state more effectively."
 WORLD.465.a: "A good measure, for sure."
 WORLD.465.b: "A step in the right direction."
 WORLD.465.c: "A useless organization for a weak state."
 WORLD.465.d: "The fascists erect a new facade."

 WORLD.466.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Anarchist Militants Siege Barcelona!"
 WORLD.466.desc: "Shocking scenes have emerged from the growing crisis in the Iberian Peninsula as uncontrollable political violence threatens to spread across the nation. Catalonia has seen some of the worst fighting between political dissidents and government forces, who have been clashing day and night in the region's capital. In scenes eerily reminiscent of the Spanish Civil War, barricades were manned once gain and neighbor was put against neighbor as ideological leanings took over the lives of Barcelona's residents.\n\nFor the moment, the radical leftist trade union known as the CNT-FAI and its sympathizers have wrestled control of Barcelona and are now set for a bloody prolonged struggle against the counter-attack of pro-government forces. It's a tale as old as time itself for Spain, as the nation plays out the bloody, tumultuous years of the 30s once more."
 WORLD.466.a: "We shall win!"
 WORLD.466.b: "Down with tyranny!"
 WORLD.466.c: "Iberia's test has come."

 WORLD.467.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Iberian Economic Crash"
 WORLD.467.desc: "Bleak news has come out of Iberia. Panicked scenes of hundreds of stockbrokers flooding the entrances of the Madrid Stock Exchange could be seen last night, as the government scrambles to respond to the crisis. Millions, if not Billions of Pesetas, have been wiped out - and that number keeps on rising.\n\nMany blame the fleeing of businesses and capital to neighbouring nations in response to Falangist policies. Others blame the stresses of Iberia's expenses, like its unruly holdings in Africa, and the popular discontent at home, as a factor. Fascists, and Hitlerist-sympathisers, throughout the nation, even blame the "insidious influence of Judeo-Bolshevism", although this is by far a minority opinion. Iberia has survived many blows and setbacks since its unification, after the end of the Second World War. However, many fear that the crisis may finally bring the Bull to its knees.\n"

 WORLD.468.desc: "At 4:02 this morning, Jose António Oliveira Salazar, one of the two caudillos of the Iberian Union and the leader of the Portuguese territories within the country, has been pronounced deceased by medical professionals. With his death passes over three decades of Portuguese history.\n\nReportedly, the caudillo had died due to complications arising from cerebral hemorrhaging, of which he was under surgery to correct. The nation of Portugal is already in mourning for their leader, as is his former colleague Francisco Franco.\n\nUntil a new successor is chosen for his position, Franco is the sole ruler of the Iberian Union and experts believe this would be the perfect opportunity for Franco to become the sole ruler of Iberia, if he dares to do so."

 WORLD.469.desc: "The Caudillo Francisco Franco has announced to a large crowd - and international press coverage - that the Iberian Council will cease to exist within a week.\n\nOriginally created to serve as a position to allow for trusted figures to share their expertise with the caudillos to allow for better governance, the council has allegedly deviated from their goal. Rather than just advise the twin rulers of Iberia, apparently the institution has attempted to undermine the pair, and bring in corruption to a place that would otherwise lack it. In this lies the reason for the abolishment of the council - Franco stated that, if they were to set such a poor example, then they had no advice of value. If there was no valuable advice, there was no reason for the council to exist.\n\nCaetano could not be reached for comment."

 WORLD.470.desc: "Likely in a bid to to stave off incessant complaints of blatant authoritarianism and corruption both at home and in foreign press, Caudillo Francisco Franco has released a statement regarding the advisory council early this morning. Its message, both conciliatory yet not lacking the Spanish dictators distinct bite, spoke of the efficacious institution in such a manner that its continued existence likely will not come into question anytime soon.\n\nWhether this move will bolster the current regime or give opponents any possible political playroom to exploit is yet to be seen. More eyes are currently, however, left on the council itself and whether its use may change with the caudillo's sign of support."

To a disconcerted press he explained that over the short period the council had existed it proved nothing but a detriment and a waste of resources. It pained the man deeply, but for the good of Iberia he, with Caetano's approval, destroyed the "corrupt, treasonous organization" and arrested every "traitor" involved.\n\nFollowing this announcement, the aging man stated that he was not strictly opposed to the idea of some organization to delegate some power to, but the current political climate was too "selfish" for such a thing to remain around. Therefore, the caudillo had no plans to recreate a similar institution at the current time.\n\nCaetano could not be reached for comment."

The council will take the place of the caudillos, administrating Iberia and passing reforms as they see fit.

Combined, the two easily make up a majority.\n\nLed by the charismatic Alejandro de Valcárcel, the Unión Nacional brands themselves as the sensible conservative choice, and the defenders of tradition.

The Guardia Civil proved themselves more loyal to the nation than to aspiring dictators, as we can announce that the National Union has instead been removed from power with an investigation into their subversive activities to be carried out as soon as possible. Until new elections are held, Iberia will be governed by a coalition of every opposition party, working towards the singular goal of preventing a repeat of last night's events.

In his victory speech, President-Elect Manuel Fraga thanked his party's opponents for their admirable and honest commitment to democracy, before vowing that he would see an Iberia equal parts traditional and progressive built atop the foundation laid by the caudillos.

Well-known for their ties to Opus Dei, the PRD openly believes strengthening the economy will strengthen society, though they have noted that they have a number of strong social policies based firmly in their Catholic beliefs. Similar to the Alianza Popular, the PRD has also committed to establishing equal justice and legal status for Iberian minorities in order to put an end to the unrest of separatist groups.

With other factions in the nation conspiring against him, he was forced to drag his people through the terrible ordeal of a war on two fronts. Stunning military victories and circumstance have allowed the dictator to uphold his position. The rebels had surrendered to the might of the Portuguese war machine whilst the union forces were sent reeling.\n\nSome have taken to the streets to protest against what they see as the illegitimate successor to the Portuguese state, but these calls grow weaker by the hour.

Their movement had quickly swelled to make the faction a large potential rival for political authority against the government.\n\nThe rising, despite initial disorganisation, was able to seize important strategic locations around Portugal whilst brazenly harassing the enemy forces.

The crisis has already led to the resignation of Secretary of State William Rogers and other senior officials.\n\nWhile polling suggests that public opinion has turned sharply against Nixon, his fate remains uncertain. With Republican House Leader Charles Halleck calling for "RDC unity" against a "witch hunt," it is unclear whether Nixon's adversaries will overcome the two-thirds majority needed in the Senate for conviction and removal.

The DC's plans include reforming the education system and liberalizing the economy, while expanding welfare reforms and ending the remnants of fascist policies.

For the most part, Italy remained alone, and it seemed it would stay that way for a long time. However, both the OFN and the Co-Prosperity Sphere have recently been making overtures to the Italians in an attempt to align them with their spheres of influence. The realization that a rival is attempting to win over the Italians has only made the two powers more keen to win over them over.\n\nInternational relations experts agree that the prize of Italy is quite bountiful, with their control over a large amount of the world's oil supply, combined with their control over the Suez Canal, which would give either alliance an incredibly powerful foothold in the Mediterranean. Of course, the Germans watch these negotiations with bitterness, as this will give one of the great power blocs of the world a direct border with the Reich itself.\n"

Being a point of crisis, as communists, nationalists, and other disgruntled groups fight one another, some have seen it as more of a burden to the empire than a benefit. With a desire to not lose control of their empire, whilst simultaneously expanding their sphere and relieving these issues, Italy has transferred the territory to Serbia, expanding its sphere into the nation.

As laudable as his views might be, they were not while received by many Italians who viewed them as nothing short of treachery, or by most Africans, who desired national liberation after decades of oppression. But against all odds, Guillet triumphed, and so far has been surprisingly lenient to the many parties who opposed him.\n\nWhile Guillet continues to push for gradual decolonization and the establishment of Italian-friendly independent nations, his superiors in Rome are deeply ambivalent about such an idea.

The PRIM seeks a return to the 1949 Hatta-Sjahir constitution, which promises more autonomy to Indonesia's far-flung lands.\n\nThe Free Government has also condemned what they see as Sukarno's overly servile attitude towards the Japanese.

The collapse of German influence in the Volkstaat, drawing back to the Reich's half hearted participation in the South African War, is being cited as the main reason for Marais's triumph over the HNP's Germanophile faction."

WORLD.19000.d: "A severe tropical cyclone has struck southern Thailand, claiming approximately 700 lives and displacing tens of thousands in the region. The storm, named Harriet, first formed in the South China Sea, moving west on its ocean voyage. The storm then made landfall in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province on the south-eastern Thai coast, crossing the peninsula and entering the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn Harriet's wake, hundreds are dead and tens of thousands have been made homeless. The storm struck at a difficult time for the Thai government, who had committed significant investments into the region as part of their economic development plans. As rescue and reconstruction efforts begin, many fear that the damage Harriet has inflicted will remain with Thailand for decades."

During a session of the assembly at the Ananta Samakhom Parliament Hall, a bomb was detonated in the building, killing 10 civil servants. The President of the Assembly has formed a committee to investigate the attack, and has expressed concerns that this may have been politically motivated.\n\nExperts in the region have agreed with the President's assessment. The bombing had set back an already delayed attempt to confirm the next President of the Republic. It is unfortunately possible that opponents to the Assembly's preferred candidate may be delaying this decision by any means necessary."

WORLD.19002.d: "Following the recent passing of President Plaek Phibunsongkhram, the National Assembly of Thailand has nominated Sang Phathanothai, former advisor of the late Marshal, as caretaker President of the Republic. The President of the Assembly has confirmed that this is only a temporary decision, pending the forming of a new cabinet.\n\nPhathanothai is both a logical choice for caretaker and an outsider in mainstream Thai politics. He has served the previous President faithfully for years, despite his moderate ties to Thai trade unions that make him unpopular with right-wing elements of the Thai government. Sang enters a presidency with an uncertain future as dominant factions circle the temporary president, waiting for the moment he can be replaced with a more agreeable candidate."

Unfortunately, this peaceful transition has not come to pass, as armed members of the Thai National Army surrounded the Thai Khu Fah building today and forced Phathanothai's resignation at gunpoint.\n\nAdding to this turmoil is general confusion from within the armed forces as to who should lead Thailand. Despite their united opposition against Phathanothai, it appears that the TNA were not immune to the factionalism that dominated the National Assembly.

Formerly Thailand's caretaker president, Phathanothai now rules in his own right. In a public speech earlier today, Sang has promised Thailand that he will not only maintain the values of the late Marshal's reign, but usher in a new era of innovation and development, and promises never to "surrender to enemies of our nation, internal or external."\n\nSang's confirmation as President is a shock to Thai politics. Many recall his house arrest on the orders of Sarit Thanarat, and even his close working relationship with the late Marshal Phibun did not suggest a future as Thailand's president.

From his involvement in the 1932 Revolution against royal absolutism, to leading Thailand to victory in war against the European imperialists, to the declaration of a Thai republic - Phibunsongkhram's legacy is perhaps the greatest in Thai history.\n\nHis passing was announced to the nation by an interim governing council, consisting of various prominent bureaucrats and generals, now entrusted to manage the immediate fallout of the passing of Thailand's pater patriae. However, with power now resting in Bangkok's most cunning schemers, many now wonder how long until the balance of power tips, and violence swallows the young republic."

Having established his presence within the military bureaucracy decades prior, a rush of armed detachments sprung to storm Bangkok's halls of power, and the General was sworn in as the new President of the republic.\n\nAmong his first actions are calls for loyalty and patriotic fervor; thousands of troops march in the cities of the young republic, saluting the President Thanom as he watches over the nation with scheming eyes.

His principled character, reputation, and charismatic leadership had won over the people and, despite rivalries within the service, support of many in the army.\n\nHowever, the situation remains delicate; Admiral Thawan's coalition of support is but a house of cards, only tacitly supported by military leadership.

The incident began when President Thanom attended a ceremony at Ratchaworadit Pier, where armed and disgruntled naval officers surrounded the pier and kidnapped the president. Soldiers loyal to the government attempted to intercept the ship along the Chao Phraya River, while other dissidents rushed the city in an attempt to seize it for the captors. The situation has devolved into internecine fighting between loyalists and rebels within and around Bangkok.\n\nInternational observers familiar with Thai politics speculate that this kidnapping may be the opening round of a coup attempt, following rumours of discontent among the military under Thanom's controversial rule.

While yet to be officially announced, it is suspected that President Thanom was killed in the fighting.\n\nIn response, the Revolutionary Council hastily raised Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien to the office of President. In his inaugural speech, President Praphas denounced the coup, claiming this kidnapping to be the work of communist and Seri Thai agitators attempting to destabilise Thailand.

In a radio speech issued earlier today, President Kris has denounced both former president Thanom and Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien as despotic tyrants, vowing to restore stability and righteous governance to the Republic.\n\nWhile the end of this brutal regime has brought relief to many in Thailand, some question the stability of this new government.

Further, President Chatichai has announced the future implementation of a new constitution and the founding of his own political party, the National Development Party, to contest in new elections to be held in the near future.\n\nThese myriad changes have both excited and terrified many within Thailand.

His declaration has also seen the temporary suspension of the constitution, with Chatichai set to rule by decree for the foreseeable future.\n\nNot since the reign of Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram has Thailand seen a state of autocratic rule. Some dissident historians in Thailand argue that Chatichai's centralisation of power is unparalleled even by the Siamese monarchy.

 WORLD.50014.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Margaret Thatcher Elected English Prime Minister"
 WORLD.50014.desc: "Margaret Thatcher first grabbed headlines in 1951, when she became the youngest female MP in the Kingdom of England upon her election. Now, she has a new record: first female prime minister. Following the recent victory in the general election, Royal Party members of the House of Commons voted to make Thatcher their party leader, thus making her prime minister.\n\nThe leadership election's result was a shock by many familiar with parliamentary politics, who long thought Thatcher to be an outsider the Royal Party's inner circle always kept at arm's length. Naysayers within the party have largely been quelled by her choice to staff the cabinet with 'old guard' MPs, the most prominent of which is R.A. 'Rab' Butler. The question of whether she leads her cabinet or her cabinet leads her, however, will remain to be seen."

But their grip is not as tight as one would think, for the recent parliamentary elections saw Reginald Maudling's United England party take control of the House of Commons.\n\nMaudling, along with the more pragmatic MP Harold Macmillan, championed the Royal Party's reformist wing, though the two frequently butted heads over just how quickly England should transition to democracy. They led a defection to a new party, with Maudling as party leader and Macmillan as chairman, and the recent election has proven their popularity with the English people.\n\nMaudling promises to free England and lead her back to democracy, but with the still-influential Macmillan looking over his shoulder, he may not go as far as others hope.\n"

But Thatcher, as many Royal Party MPs could attest, has proven herself to be as resilient and inflexible as iron.\n\nFor the past several years, she has managed to outmaneuver Rab Butler and the other titans of the Royal Party, turning their attempts to undermine her into opportunities to consolidate her own power. This most recent general election saw Royal Party maintain its majority in the House of Commons, proving that Thatcher could not only manage her grip on her own party, but also cement her influence across the country.\n\nAnd now, continuing her reign as prime minister of England, Margaret Thatcher is free to advance her political agenda - and for once, it actually will be her own.\n"

Rising to prominence after splitting from the Royal Party after their victory in the English Civil War, Maudling's government has taken a slow, yet steady approach to democratizing England.\n\nHowever, this course of action has confused many political commentators, because England's slow return to democracy is a stark contrast to Maudling's fiery promise of a free and independent England. It is speculated that Harold Macmillan, chairman of the United England Party, is the one calling the shots, and Maudling is his mere puppet. Perhaps Maudling tried to break free of Macmillan, but as shown by his somewhat subdued victory speech, he must have failed.\n\nWhat Maudling, or perhaps more accurately Macmillan intends to do with their second term remains a mystery.\n"

However, not all is as it seems, as whispers in the commons say that he and the party's chairman, Macmillian, butt heads over the speed of these promised reforms with Macmillian preferring a slow but pragmatic approach as opposed to Maudling's fast and idealistic approach.

At times imprisoned and suppressed by the CHP's authoritarian regime, Boran represents a generation robbed of their rights and liberties.

On that day, troops commanded by Fertig stormed Congress and forcibly demanded the impeachment of President García and Vice President Santos. Although fierce resistance was led by Ramon Magsaysay, Magsaysay's surrender to federal troops in the name of national unity on Christmas Eve has put an end to the conflict.

 WORLD.18200.d: "Scattered reports and accounts originating from the arboraceous heart of Africa tell of turmoil and strife, as a series of tumultuous conflicts have erupted, sending the territory into turbulent upheaval once more, with each faction aiming to shape the future of the state according to their vision.\n\nOver the centuries, the dense and humid jungles of the Congo have been subject to oppression and subjugation, first under the sanguinary rule of the Belgians, then under the iron fist of the Reich. As these eventful chapters in the history of the Congo passed by, the region finds itself once again in the disquieting grasp of violence.\n\nInternational observers around the world observe the situation with a keen eye, as the crackles of gunfire begin to be heard on the shores of the great lake."
 WORLD.18200.a: "Another disturbance."

 WORLD.18202.d: "As the guns cool across the Congo, a lone victor stands amidst the spent shells of warfare- namely, the [CFS.GetName]. Following the extensive combat operations in the region, considerable support from the OFN, and simple military outmaneuvering, it's safe to say that the [CFS.GetName] stands firmly atop the Congo, as the Enheitspakt and Co-Prosperity Sphere denounce the American presence in the region. Today, the Japanese foreign ministry announced their disdain for the "blatant imperialism of the Americans, like the Germans not long ago." Conversely, the German foreign ministry has been considerably more muted on the subject, though America's official declaration praises the "determination of the Congolese people to the perseverance of democracy". With the indulgent and formal appointment of the [CFS.GetName] within the OFN, it's safe to say the Congo has officially entered the Free World.\n"

 WORLD.18203.d: "Following the collapse of control over Central Africa following the South African War, it seems as though the Congo Wars have finally drawn to a close, the basin in the heart of Africa now sporting a new shade of red. Following Patrice Lumumba's death, the socialist elements within the "Mouvement Colonais National" split off, forming their own movement under Christophe Gbenye. Having won the wars totally under his guidance, it would seem as though the Pan-Africanists have made the right choice, with plenty of support from other Pan-African movements across the continent drastically speeding up the process of victory.\n\nWith this victory nearly cemented by the Popular Republic, it is clear that even in light of this victory, there is still much reconstruction to be done. With international aid within Africa on the table, however, it may not be long before Congo is back on its feet.\n"

 WORLD.18204.d: "The state of Afrika has finally calmed down today, as the final shots have rung out over the Congo basin. It would seem that with the collapse of the Reichsstaat, some of the remnants have persevered in the form of the Afrikaner-Abwehrfront, a state consisting of the remaining Hüttig-aligned soldiers of the region. While the front initially split from the Einheitspakt following the establishment of the Reichsstaat, it would seem as though bygones are bygones so far as Germany is concerned, as the two have long since mended their worn ties.\n\nOf course, it seems that the other world powers are infuriated at this development. As the Congo reenters the German sphere, Japan and America are left without an ally in the region. With the situation calming down, it's safe to say that Germany has regained a firm foothold in Afrika.\n"
 WORLD.18204.a: "An uneasy alliance at best."

 WORLD.18205.d: "It seems that Germany's heavy investment into the Congo has finally paid off today, as all the blood, sweat, and tears shed to earn a slice of Afrika have today been vindicated. From the horror of the South African War, the betrayal of the traitorous Reichsstaat and it's depressing collapse, it seemed as though Germany's expeditions into Afrika were all doomed ventures- until the movement which incidentally collapsed the Reichsstaat, a coalition of bureaucrats and generals, beat out all competitors in the Congo War.\n\nThe reaction in Germany has been one of absolute delight, as additional reserves are sent to the region to stabilize the reacquired territory. With the international community largely disappointed, and OFN and Sphere representatives denouncing the reconnection of Zentralafrika to the German economic sphere, it seems safe to say that Germany has come out on top of the Congo.\n"

 WORLD.18206.d: "News from the Congo today, as an artifact of the Zentralafrikan administration and leader of the Belgium expatriate community, Jean Schramme, has established control over the Congo. Working off of his corporate state and nothing else, Katanga has managed to put down the rebellions surrounding it, the remnant Germans holding out in the region, all without foreign support of any kind. Needless to say, their victory has been met with nearly no support whatsoever.\n\nThis loss for the world powers is not totally without merit, however. As Jean has himself confirmed in a speech to all of the Congo that he "will not let Africa be without impact on the world's affairs" as he has announced a determination to strike trade deals with all that the region can manage. As the superpowers begin to open up relations to their former enemy, few can deny the economic benefits in dealing with "The Belgian".\n"

 WORLD.18207.d: "Reality is truly stranger than fiction, as Kasai, the statelet in a state of non-aggression with Katanga, seems to have come out on top of the Congo civil war. It goes without saying that the world powers have been totally humiliated, as warfare theorists have been left baffled as to the sheer tactical skill of the Kasain military. Many point towards the genius in exploiting the open flanks of these states, though others shift the blame to the other internationally-backed Congolese warlords as not pulling their weight.\n\nAs the state has immediately taken upon the task of recovering from the conflict, it has long been established that the Kasai has no intention of interacting with the superpowers of the world, and has entered a state of economic isolation. As the condemnation of the Congo to isolation is now all but ensured, the superpowers look to the rest of Africa for their foothold.\n"

 WORLD.18208.d: "As the Congo Basin finally returns to some semblance of peace, it is clear that the outcome has been decided in favor of not a country, but a man: Mobutu Sese Seko, namely.\n\nA former Zentralafrikan SS officer, Mobutu was discharged in the '50s for allegedly planning a revolt with his fellow officers and commanders, as well as for the theft of military equipment. Following his coup of the Azandeland government with his accused co-conspirators, few still refer to it as a conspiracy theory.\n\nHaving received hefty Japanese backing throughout and immediately following the Congo Wars, it is expected that Mobutu's civilian dictatorship will move fast to establish its presence, if nothing else."

 WORLD.18209.d: "News has emerged from the Congo, which had been embroiled in a brutal civil war following the collapse of the OFN Mandate of the Congo. The Federal Republic of the Congo, proclaimed by the remains of the old Congolese National Party that split from the Mandate after the collapse, has emerged victorious, and united the Congo under their control.\n\nWhile the OFN may no longer directly control the region, many have noted the deep ties the Federal Republic has to the OFN, as well as sustained OFN support during the conflict. Several international observers have categorized this as a "new act of neocolonialism," but many are merely glad the conflict has ended - and that there exists hope that the Congo might finally be free, and ruled by her own people."

Chin Peng, its leader and famed local revolutionary has ended the period of dictatorial rule on emergency decrees to establish the All-Malayan Revolutionary Front.\n\nFormed as a popular front of trade unions and leftists alike across Malaya, the Front intends to mobilize popular support in both its own lands and the war-torn lands of Southern Malaya, still ruled by collaborationist forces backed by Japan to overthrow the rival government and establish their rule over all of Malaya.\n\nConcerns have been voiced in Tokyo and Kuala Lumpur of growing unrest and military mobilization of the Front, fearing a second war in Malaya.

Yeop Mahidin, famed general and nationalist has finally stepped down from a period of military rule to give way to the returning Tun Hussein Onn for him to restore civilian rule.\n\nWhile doubts were expressed during the initial takeover of the junta's willingness to step down and agree to honor their promises, the rise of Hussein Onn to the leadership after his long exile in the Republic of India has extinguished any further fears of a permanent military junta over the remains of Malaya.\n\nWhile many are still concerned about the Japanese threat, Hussein Onn has promised to soon open diplomatic talks with the southern collaborators to end the split in Malaya and reunify the country - only time can tell whether they will be successful.\n"

Immediately following the war, it was assumed that the rump state will remain unwillingly separated for a very long time.\n\nIt seems that Japan's hold over Johor has ended, with protests and unrest rocking over Johor has resulted in several clashes with the native population and the garrison.\n\nSeeing the untenable situation, Japan has officially ordered the recalling of all garrisons back to Singapore, together with a reunification referendum in Johor, which was overwhelmingly passed in favour. With the referendum, the Malayan state has quickly annexed Johor in accordance of the referendum, reuniting Malaya.\n"

Possible solutions have included a partition, a Hashemite-led federation, and more, with some extremists even advocating for a single Jewish or Palestinian state spanning the whole of the Levant.

With the disparate groups of the Levant refusing to compromise on the issues of the day, a heavy hearted Governor-General was forced to close the conference as both Jews and Arabs mobilize for war. What happens next is unclear: international speculation ranges from increased insurgent activity to a full-fledged war for the region.\n\nThe Jewish Political Sphere has been turned on its head, with Irgun leader Menachem Begin openly calling for an overthrow of the Labor-Zionist order. At the same time, George Habash's fiery calls for Revolution have begun to turn more heads than ever.\n\nWhatever the case, the Levant's last chance for peace has been lost, and without it the road ahead has turned dark and stormy.\n"

Riots in Amman have erupted in protest of the peace, with Palestinian leader in Exile Yasser Arafat going as far as declaring that "The Hashemites must be put down."\n\nOn the Israeli camp, a markedly positive reaction: Prime Minister Menachem Begin has received praise from all Israeli political parties except his own, where right-wing hawks denounced the agreement as a betrayal to Greater Israel.

Following this military victory finally stabilizing the region, a spokesperson for the Central Asian alliance has stated that they intend to reclaim territory lost in the wake of the Second World War. As Iran and Afghanistan had both seized territory within the aforementioned timespan, many fear that open conflict is likely to erupt before long, with Iranian, Afghan, Japanese, and German spokespersons denouncing the acts, while it seems the Turkish government could not be happier with the circumstances and seem to have already reached out to the new alliance in search of trade deals.\n"

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, hailed by many as the father of the Republic of India and the architect of its political framework, died at 6:25 in the early morning of 27th May, after a sudden illness.\nAccorded a state funeral, the flag-draped body of the deceased statesman was kept under constant vigil by senior ROI Army personnel, and was then cremated on the banks of the Yamuna in a public event. A public notice of sadness at Nehru's departure has been circulated from Kolkata, but it appears that the reaction of the Government of Free India is only stony-faced silence.\nFor the people the only reaction has been a sense of immense loss and of an era past. Of the generation of larger-than-life heroes that dominated the freedom struggle, only Subhas Chandra Bose in a hostile neighboring government survives.\n"

However, this has been proven wrong with Edmond Giscard d'Estaing and Union pour la Démocratie Française's spectacular triumph in the first truly democratic elections in France since those of 1936.\n\nThe Union pour la Démocratie Française's strong ties to the French Resistance and its unwavering commitment to the principles of democracy have cast the party into a symbol of the radical, revolutionary and republican values that have defined French history and political life since the storming of the Bastille. A status that nurtured the party's popularity and status that will come to define their policies as France enters a new era of social justice.\n"

While the USA has recognized the Vichy government's status as the legitimate government of France since its proclamation, relations would remain cold at best. However, relations have quickly warmed up after Antoine Pinay's restoration of democracy in France, opening up the way for France's membership to the OFN, as the young republic grew threatened by the sea of fascism that surrounded it.\n\nHailed as a major victory for America and the Free World, France's entry to the OFN is yet another sign of Germany's New Order over Europe crumbling as they lose their hold over the continent.\n"

This stance is also one shared by the Conseil d'Etat, giving him the electoral edge over his competition.\n\nWhile Jean d'Ormesson is more moderate in his monarchist views than Pujo, he is still a staunch monarchist, continually promoting the idea that the King should be an untouchable figure in French politics."

 novel.1.t: "Heirs of Babylon"
 novel.1.d: ""Heirs of Babylon" is a newly released fiction book detailing an 'alternative' universe in which the Third Reich lost its struggle against the decadent capitalist West and the mongrel states of Russia after our beloved Führer was cut down by a sniper's bullet in 1935. Written by Cornish author Antony Beevor, "Heirs of Babylon" details the lives of people living in divided Berlin, Londium, Alexandria, and Philadelphia - the new capital of the Americas. Much of the world is divided between the Imperial Dominion of Britannia, who have reclaimed their traditional thrones in Germany and France; the United American Federation whose borders stretch from the North Pole to the South Pole; and the insidious pan-Eurasian Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\nFerdinand Featherston is an investigator, a Britannian detective with a licence to kill and beholden only to Her Britannic Majesty. Searching for his wife in red Europe, he is swept up by a world-shaking plot in Berlin. The chase takes him to America, France, Africa and finally to Gibraltar in a series of daring escapes and high-speed gun battles.\n\nThe crux of the novel's events is the Gibraltar Missile Crisis, a tense nuclear standoff between the dominion and the pan-Eurasian union, while the United Federation seeks to undermine both sides and provoke a war for their own purposes.\nThe novel ends in uncertainty, with tanks massing across the Gibraltar border and an American fleet refusing to answer hails circling like vultures. Will Ferdinand use the dominion's most powerful weapons? Will he rescue the woman he loves..."

 novel.2.t: "The Greatest Story Never Told"
 novel.2.d: "A rather interesting alternate history novel has been gaining some attention around the world, perhaps for all the wrong reasons.\n\n"The Greatest Story Never Told", released two weeks ago, self published by a certain "Bodean Clefton Dixie" (almost certainly a pen name), with a hand drawn cover, which some critics described as "a crude drawing of a tank with a Dixie flag, rolling over a Nazi flag with a hammer and sickle instead of a swastika, within a thought balloon coming out of George Lincoln Rockwell's head".\n\nThe novel is a strange ramble about how if Rockwell hadn't been assassinated "by Judeo-Bolsheviks" he would have created "the greatest story in mankind's history" and goes on to blame his death on "Jews being afraid of what truths he could write".\n\nThe novel has garnered attention, all due to its bizarre tone and claims such as: "Nazi Germany being a Judeo-Bolshevik bastion" due to it being "led by a party who is socialist before it is nationalist" among many other... astonishing claims, which are surprisingly comedic, hence its widespread success in the U.S., and abroad."

 novel.3.t: "The Man in the Iron Fortress"
 novel.3.d: "Science fiction author Philip K. Dick has released his latest novel, named "The Man in the Iron Fortress." A work of speculative alternate history, the novel takes place in a dystopian world where communism reigns supreme. The 'point of divergence' in the story's history is that the socialist politician Eugene Debs remained with the Democrats, becoming President in 1920. As a result, he supported the nascent Soviet Union and the May Fourth movement in China. Debs' beliefs died with him in 1926, and his successor Robert La Follette proved to be far more isolationist, a trend that dominated American politics for the next twenty years. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union became dominated by the authoritarian Felix Dzerzhinsky, while the communists under Mao Tse-tung were able to unite China and counter-invade the Japanese. When the Nazis rose to power, they were able to crush the unsupported Allied nations of Europe, but were unprepared for a surprise Soviet invasion and were swiftly defeated. In 1947, a joint Sino-Soviet army invaded America, leading to them dividing the country north-south.\n\nThe novel is set within occupied America and follows a wide cast of characters, from a Cheka spy to a Chinese official obsessed with American cowboy culture. At the center of its plot is a book called "The Beast Among the Reeds," which tells of a world where both Nazism and communism were defeated. The political backdrop is one of rapidly decaying Sino-Soviet relations; Dzerzhinsky is succeeded after his death by the even more totalitarian Lavrentiy Beria, and the threat of nuclear war looms on the horizon.\n\nDespite the novel's criticism for seemingly unrealistic developments (the Soviets allegedly drained the Baltic Sea for farmland and built a giant bridge stretching across the Bering Strait between Russia and Alaska), Dick has defended the action as being plausible within the best available information he could acquire at the time. That still hasn't stopped the book from becoming a bestseller in the United States and Canada, and it has already been nominated for a Hugo Award."

 novel.4.t: "Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles"
 novel.4.d: "Earlier this month, noted author and founder of Gonzo journalism Hunter S. Thompson released his newest book, "Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles". Set in a surreal alternate history universe with few rules, the work is a multi-pronged satire on other, more serious alternate history works, as well as a scathing critique of the culture of the United States in the 1970s.\n\nThompson spends dozens of pages going into the minutia of each "divergence point", off-color vignettes within the overarching story that detail how the world of this novel ended up differing from our own. Irreverent and often nonsensical, these stories detail ridiculous episodes, such as a Japanese doctor in Unit 731 accidentally trying a hallucinogenic drug of his own concoction, leading him to paradrop an army of drugged-up "ghouls" into downtown Tokyo. While critics are somewhat split on these stories, casual readers tired of the over-saturation of the fiction market with cheap, overly-serious, "alt-history" novels have found them a welcome, if odd, diversion from the norm.\n\nLinking these various episodes together, Thompson has strung out a vague semblance of a plot in this alternate LA, mainly consisting of cheap allegories to attack contemporary American political culture. In one memorable scene, a street gang closely modeled after the Yockeyites beat up a demonstration of "old yuppie bigots" (Nixon supporters, also referred to as "bloodthirsty freaks"), all while an inebriated Thompson watches with juvenile glee.\n\nWhile critics and readers alike are split on the novel, most at least concede it is a scathing and effective critique of the current literary and political climate."

 novel.5.t: "The Red Twilight"
 novel.5.d: "Since the fall of London, novelist Eric Blair, better known by his pen name George Orwell, has gained prominence from his political writings done in exile in Canada. Today, he has released his most lengthy opus: the last chapter in his "Legacy of the Weltkrieg" alternate history series, "The Red Twilight". The series takes place in a timeline that diverges from ours with a Central Powers victory in the First World War, and has received critical attention for its allegorical deconstruction of our world.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Entente, the governments of the British Empire and France quickly collapse and are replaced by socialist republics, while Russia eventually becomes a fascistic dictatorship lead by White revolutionary Boris Savinkov. After unifying to destroy the German Empire, her allies, and the remnants of the Entente, the alliance quickly shatters, with the libertarian syndicalist Commune of France and Oswald Mosley's Union of Britain forging their own internationals and engaging in an apocalyptic nuclear war that leaves Europe and North America in ruins, while Russia and Japan engage in a similarly destructive schism. The world by 1962 is devastated by nuclear fallout and divided by a four-sided armistice threatening to either end civilization or enslave it under various flavours of totalitarianism.\n\nEnding with the 'English socialist' American Commonwealth tearing apart itself into a Third American Civil War as white supremacists revolt in the South, the novel has received analysis for its complex parallels with the violent conflicts occurring all around world, though some dismiss it as no different than the rest of the glut of alt-history novels that have been filling bookshelves in the recent years. Responding to critics, Orwell has addressed the implausibility of this universe by writing "... this universe is no less stranger than anything that has happened in ours for the last half-century.""

 novel.10.t: "Another Planet's Hell"
 novel.10.d: "The novel "Another Planet's Hell" has released today, giving its author, Aldous Huxley, quite the reputation for its themes and story. The book is set in an alternative reality, where Adolf Hitler dies during his attempted putsch in 1923 and never takes power, instead superseded by the monarchist DNVP and its leader, Alfred Hugenberg. In Russia, Nikolai Bukharin loses to Joseph Stalin, who centralizes power and creates an almost nightmarish dictatorship that strengthens the union. The Second World War is is started by the newly formed Deutsche Ordensstaat, a military junta backed by the Kaiser, and is led by Hugenberg, Erwin Rommel and Erich Ludendorff (in the book, the junta is called the Crusader's Council).\n\nThe book takes place during the war, in occupied France. Its protagonist, Anne-Marie Manouchian, starts as a college professor teaching chemistry, but becomes a bombmaker after the school is shut down and many of its professors arrested for promoting anti-German ideals. During her struggle, she meets the two other primary protagonists; Jack, an OSS agent helping the resistance, and Nikolai, a Soviet agent running guns to communist militias. As the story goes on, the three primary factions emerge; first, the Imperial Entente, a faction led by a more reactionary United Kingdom and a Bonapartist France. Second, the Alliance of Soviets, a Russia-led faction poised at spreading world communism. Finally, there exists the Pacific Joint-Defense Group, an alliance led by a more democratic Japan and the United States.\n\nThe book ends with Anne-Marie witnessing the nuclear bombing of the city of Dresden, while Nikolai says that "this is not an end, but a beginning to a world torn open by flame. Your children shall be communists, or you shall not have children." The book has been criticized by many as being overly pessimistic and heavy on details, but others have insisted that this could have been a reality had things played out differently. Huxley has defended the novel, saying that "as miserable as things are, we can at least be thankful for what could never happen.""

 novel.11.t: "The Blue Order"
 novel.11.d: "An intriguing work of fiction has been gaining traction around the world in the past few weeks. Said novel, titled "The Blue Order," authored under the pen name of "Miles Lloyd" depicts a world in which a radical, authoritarian politician runs for the American Presidency in 1932, associated with the revived "Bull Moose Party." This President, only known to readers as "the President," quickly proceeds to consolidate his power under the guise of defending America, and rapidly turns the American economy into one fueled by preparation for an 'eventual war'. With this in mind, he issues an ultimatum to Nazi Germany upon the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936. Any further military movements will be met with swift American reprisal. Upon the Anschluss of Austria, the President declares war on Germany, under the guise of "safeguarding liberty".\n\nHistory is then lost in this world for two decades. Upon sunrise of some arbitrary day, the world is revealed to have been torn apart by a Second World War. In Russia, the Soviets have lost all of Eastern Siberia to the American Republic, while the death of Bukharin throws the remainder into chaos. In Asia, the State of Japan lies under American supervision, having lost against them prior. In Europe, the British Isles, Iberia, and Italy remain as the last major independent regions, having formed a strange alliance of democracy and fascism, with the Soviets being a previous member before Bukharin's death. In the remains of mainland Europe, American puppet 'republics' sit under lock and chain. American control is not absolute, however, with various warlord states waiting for the sunset to liberate their homelands.\n\nThe President cannot live forever, however, and upon his assassination at the end of the novel, the sun begins crossing the horizon, as the destiny of humanity hangs in the balance."

 novel.12.t: "The Occupation"
 novel.12.d: "A new book has been flying off the shelves across the world, circulating heavily even in the black markets of Germany. Entitled "The Occupation", the book describes an alternate history where the Germans are defeated in the Second World War. In it, Japan collapses into civil war with communists and lose their footholds on mainland Asia. Though the emperor eventually prevails, Japan never recovers and opts to lick its wounds rather than embark on the conquests it did in our world. Thus, once the Germans are pushing across England and the United States finally intervenes, they are not distracted by the fighting in the Pacific and manage to defeat and occupy Germany. The defeated Reich is split into two halves: the German People's Republic, a Soviet puppet state consisting of the north, and the Republic of Germany, an allied occupation zone with self-government consisting of the south, the Rhineland, and Austria. The two are more commonly known as North and South Germany in the story. Once again, a nationalist and revanchist government is elected in South Germany, similar to Hitler's rise in our own world. Having learned from the mistakes of the past, South Germany is quickly invaded and the old government reinstated by the Allies. The story follows a poor German youth who is believed to be a nationalist by the occupying Western powers. Although he isn't at the start of the book, his unjustified persecution by the occupiers eventually leads him to become one, and the book hints that this is part of an endless cycle that will always lead to oppression and violence by one side. It also hints that something similar and far more dangerous may occur with the now-recovered Japan.\n\nThe book has proven stunningly controversial. Many claim it is Nazi schlock, trying to clear them of wrongdoing and insinuating that their reaction to Versailles was justified. Others claim that it is simply unrealistic, and that Japan's communist movement would have never been strong enough to do the damage the book has them do. The author says they are all missing the point, and that the book is more about the message rather than the setting."

 novel.13.t: "SSR-Ostpreussen"
 novel.13.d: "This week, author Len Deighton published his newest novel, "SSR-Ostpreussen". The novel takes place in an alternate history where Mikhail Tukhachevsky launches a coup against Bukharin in the late 1920s, transforming the Soviet Union into a military state comparable to Napoleon's France. 'The New Bonaparte' as he is styled, launches numerous invasions of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia at a time when the rest of the world is still reeling from the Great Depression and unable to respond, significantly strengthening the Soviets' position. Hitler's Germany finds a much tougher opponent in this union and the war between the two lasts for many years, until both sides are forced into peace after each discovers the atomic bomb simultaneously and the cities of Königsberg and Kiev are annihilated.\n\nThe story focuses on a commissar of the Red Army who has been assigned to oversee the reconstruction of Soviet-held Königsberg, now rechristened Trotskygrad after a close ally of Tukhachevsky. Upon discovering the murder of a prominent government official, the commissar finds himself embroiled in a byzantine web of plots involving the Soviet high command, the local garrison, and partisans from the heavily oppressed and radiation-scarred German inhabitants of the city. Hints are laid throughout the story of greater goings on behind the scenes, such as massive instability in German-controlled Western Europe and extensive Soviet military campaigns in Northern Iran and Western China. The story ends with the commissar narrowly escaping death at the hands of his superiors and uncovering a plot to provoke the Reich into a new war.\n\nThe book has drawn praised for its unique take on the noir genre and its gritty setting amidst the burned-out streets of Trotskygrad. Some have criticised it for its somewhat sympathetic portrayal of the German characters, with a few even going as far as to suggest that Deighton may possess Nazi ideals. Regardless, it has already had a quite successful first run of sales and is expected to become a staple of alternate history for years to come."

 WORLD_GRE.8.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Red Revolution in Greece"
 WORLD_GRE.8.desc: "The chaos that has engulfed Greece in the aftermath of the Second Italo-Turkish War has reached its climax with the fall of Athens to partisans of the National Liberation Front, EAM. Speaking from the Presidential Mansion, now pock-marked by bullets and blackened by mortar fire, leader of the EAM Aris Velouchiotis promised that this would be the birth of a new Greece.\n\nThe battle-hardened guerrilla leader spoke of the depravity of the Italians and their collaborators, and suggested that a reckoning would be in order once the country was secure. First however, he warned his countrymen to prepare for war.\n"We have triumphed, but only against the tools of our oppressors. We must now ready ourselves to face all that our oppressors can muster against us. The forces of reaction will screech against us, and yet we shall emerge free!"\n"

 WORLD_GRE.9.desc: "After weeks of increasingly intense partisan warfare, the Hellenic State has been toppled by the EDES resistance movement. With President Themelis dead, former leader of the EKKA resistance group Colonel Dimitrios Psarros has assumed interim leadership of the reformed Hellenic Republic until the country can hold proper and free elections, which will be its first since 1936.\n\nFlanked by his second-in-command Komninos Pyromaglou, the old army officer promised that the restoration of civil order and the restoration of Greek democracy were his primary goals. Questions regarding the newly liberated state's relationship with its former Italian overlords, as well as the government's stance regarding the communist dominated "Mountain Government" already proclaiming itself the legitimate government of Greece went unanswered."

 SERBIA_NEWS.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]The Serbian National Uprising"
 SERBIA_NEWS.1.d: "In a land famous for resistance against oppressors and those deemed as national traitors, very few actually anticipated for Serbia to stay calm for much longer. With the death of Prime Minister Dimitrije Ljotić and other recent occurrences, the people of Serbia have risen up once more, this time under the leadership of the communists. The leader of the newly revitalized National Liberation Army Aleksandar Ranković is at the head of the uprising, with his forces already threatening to storm collaborator positions in great numbers.\n\nThe government, led by Belgrade's steward, Dragomir Jovanović, is fighting an uphill battle to maintain control of Serbia. Although his position as leader of the government is temporary, Jovanović is already making use of his influence to counter the National Liberation Army at every opportunity."

 SERBIA_NEWS.2.d: "The government of Serbia has won a landslide victory against the communists, though that in itself created an event worthy of note. The leader of the Serbian National Army, formerly known as the Chetnik movement, Momčilo Đujić, has been sworn in as the new Serbian Prime Minister. Already his new policies are creating waves across the country, felt especially by the now defeated communist guerillas.\n\nIn a move quite a number of people had expected with the Vojvoda's ascension, the military had established a reactionary junta to allow Serbia to recover amidst the chaos of the uprising. In addition, Prime Minister Đujić invited King Peter of the former Yugoslav nation to return to Serbia as king, thereby formally restoring the monarchy in Serbia. It is reported that over the coming weeks, King Peter will be preparing to return to Serbia in order to answer Đujić's invitation."

 SERBIA_NEWS.3.d: "Following the conclusion of the uprising within Serbia by communist elements and their defeat by the forces of Dragomir Jovanović and his supporters, it comes as no surprise that the man had managed to secure his position as the leader of Serbia. Following a policy of national unity, Jovanović called for solidarity against the influence of Bolshevik thought within Serbia, where Serbdom could breathe easy again. He was also quick to rally the troops of the Serbian National Army and the Volunteer Corps to his side with the unifying rhetoric, urging integrity and consensus among Serbia's national forces.\n\nAlthough victorious in the Serbian uprising, some continue to be skeptical of his ability to maintain his rule, given that Jovanović is treading on grounds all to familiar to most in the form of the Milan Nedić government, while hunting down the last remnants of the communist partisans and their supporters from the countryside."

 SERBIA_NEWS.4.d: "As quickly as they lost their leading position in Serbian politics, the Zbor returned with thunderous cheer from within the party. Returning to the forefront of politics following the conclusion of the Serbian uprising, and their role in ending it, the younger brother of former Prime Minister Dimitrije Ljotić, Jakov Ljotić was sworn in as Serbia's newest prime minister.\n\nJakov's plans will not deviate much from those of his older brother, though they certainly will diverge from time to time, if ever so slightly. Already the effects of such rule are beginning to manifest themselves, as the newly sworn in Prime Minister has already introduced a set of basic laws whose purpose is to further enshrine the ideas of the Zbor within the government."
