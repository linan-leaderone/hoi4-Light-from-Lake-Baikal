 KOV_dybbukim1:0 "Dybbukim"
 KOV_dybbukim1_desc:0 "The people of Eastern Europe are haunted at night by the screams of now-dead relations. The blood of the past has largely washed away, but the stains remain to haunt those who have survived unto the present. There are scarce few men among us who are not invigorated by this blood.\n\nThe spirits of the Dybukkim are awakened by this blood-stained past. They demand that their murderous ends are not left unavenged."
 
 KOV_dybbukim2:0 "Dybukkim"
 KOV_dybbukim2_desc:0 "The spectres of the Dybukkim haunt the Germans for every step they take in their conquered lands. The spirits cackle as the Germans feel growing unease with every moment they spend occupying this soil.\n\nWhen they are at last avenged; when the Germans feel a rope tighten around their neck, or a cold bayonet tearing into their gut, only then will the Dybukkim rest easy, for their vengeance has been extracted."

Overnight headquarters have fallen silent, battle-ridden posts have stopped calling for support, and patrols have failed to report in.\n\nThis can be described as nothing less than a complete breakdown of the communications network. It is uncertain as to which of our plentiful enemies have struck so covertly at our lines of communication, but the damage is done. It will take months to restore such damage to an operational capacity."

 UPO_from_the_shadows:0 "From the Shadows"
 UPO_from_the_shadows_desc:0 "We hide no longer. Inklings of fear in the back of the Nazi mind have festered into something they cannot control. Now, our blades emerge from our sleeves. Our eyes burn with the ashes of our dead brothers and sisters, and our yells echo with the screams of fear of countless millions as they succumbed to poison and flame. The Germans cry in terror, screech in revulsion, shout in anger, but we revel in their condemnations. We are no longer their nightmares, their sleep-horrors that skitter back into the cold inky blackness when they open their eyes to try and see us. They can see us now. We don't hide in the shadows.\n\nWe cast them."
 
 ##Dybbukim
 UPO_dybbukim:0 "Dybbukim"
 UPO_dybbukim_desc:0 "The Dybbukim were monsters of folk stories, the souls of the dead trapped on an Earth that wanted them no longer. They lived in agony, their memories of their living life half-rotted and serving as an unreachable reminder of their trapped state rather than as a tiny piece of solace. With no other option, they harassed and wreaked havoc upon the still-living, forcing them to do tasks for them so that their tormented souls could finally be unchained of this wretched plane and dissolve into the etherous and unknowable worlds beyond. So many of our brethren were trapped in the Earth, in sterile chambers scorched by ash or tainted with toxins, and so many found themselves shackled to this world after their deaths. They have haunted us ever since, pleading for us to not let those who did this to them go unpunished. They screech in tiny whispers and let out screams softer than the sun's rays, and not a night goes by that we do not see those we loved weeping in our dreams. They are our Dybbukim, and they ask us one thing: to in turn be the Dybbukim to the German, haunting them and tormenting them until they perform the one task that will let us finally rest. We only ask the German to do one thing: Die. Then, we and those we loved can finally be at peace."
 
 #Gather Support
 UPO_gather_support:0 "Gather Support"
 UPO_gather_support_desc:0 "There is not a single non-German in all of Ostland who did not lose someone or something to the war and its aftermath. Homes, limbs, loved ones, they were all stolen from us by the invaders, and now they lie buried in the earth with only us to remember. But remember them we do, and remember them do all of the people who they were stolen from. Even the collaborators and complacent hold a tiny pinhole in their heart where something is missing. They may kiss the boot, but what was stolen still haunts them in the back of their minds. All we have to do is remind them of what was taken, show them who took it, hand them a rifle, and let them do the rest."
 
 UPO_armories_unguarded:0 "Armories Unguarded"
 UPO_armories_unguarded_desc:0 "While the rats scurry through the fields of Ostland, biting, gnawing, savaging their own kind, their nests lay undisturbed and unobserved; in that lies our opportunity. Many within the UPO only carry with them what weapons they have scavenged or liberated from the Germans; a submachine gun, a pistol, a bayonet. If they can bring bloody justice upon the enemy with old guns and knives, the Germans will shudder to think what we Dybukkim can do with their own weapons.\n\nAcross the Reichskommissariat, armories will go silent, all contact with their German masters severed - and they will be too busy killing each other to rush to their comrades' aid until it is too late. Their weapons will be like dust in the wind, and their owners' corpses the only proof they were ever there at all."
 
 UPO_cut_every_wire:0 "Cut Every Wire"
 UPO_cut_every_wire_desc:0 "When the damned return to extract their just revenge upon the Germans, the only respite the German man may have is the fact that he may scream to his distant comrades before his end is brought forth.\n\nBut such respite is only temporary.\n\nWhen their precious lines of communication are cut, the Germans can no longer cry for help. Their brothers may no longer arrive to cause havoc in a futile attempt at rescue. From henceforth their screams and pleas will be lost to the wind."
 
 #An Open Door
 UPO_an_open_door:0 "An Open Door"
 UPO_an_open_door_desc:0 "An open door is one which begs to be entered- openly and without suspicion. Where some may put fortifications, we have left fields; Where some may raise flags, we have left bare poles; And, where some may but boundaries, we have left nothing. All across Ostland, the Nazis will find these doors to nowhere.\n\nAnd when they have stepped through, that is when we will strike. In every tree is a guerrilla, in every deserted home a bomb, in every bush a mine. Proudly and blindly will they stride across the threshold of our door to Hell, and proudly and blindly will they die."
 
 UPO_an_empty_field:0 "An Empty Field"
 UPO_an_empty_field_desc:0 "Men on patrol never heard from again; a commander's transmission silenced at random; a dog's bark cut short by a yelp; all signs of our wrath. Try as they might, searching forests, villages, bases, the Germans never find us. It maddens and torments them, and in that fury they become ever more reckless, charging headlong into our traps and our rifles.\n\nThey are killing themselves almost as much as we kill them."
 
 UPO_nothing_but_trees:0 "Nothing But Trees"
 UPO_nothing_but_trees_desc:0 "For decades we have toiled in the great forests of Ostland, digging sprawling routes hidden in dirt and brush. It may well be that the most complex system of transit in all of Ostland lies in these forests, our spiders' webs flowing with weaponry, ammunition, and partisans. As we stalk them under their very feet, the Germans will never see us coming until they are surrounded, and when their friends arrive to save them, we will already be back in our webs, leaving only righteous justice behind."
 
 #Closing
 UPO_felt_but_not_seen:0 "Felt But Not Seen"
 UPO_felt_but_not_seen_desc:0 "The presence of a Dybbuk, so the old stories say, is not one that any man nor woman can see; no, it is one that is felt. The gnawing feeling in the gut, the flash in the corner of the eye, the whispering in the ear - they say it's nothing, tricks of the light and the mind, they laugh at their own foolishness.\n\nNone laugh when they feel the blade in their back."
 
 ##The Other Partisans
 UPO_the_other_partisans:0 "The Other Partisans"
 UPO_the_other_partisans_desc:0 "In a sea of Germans, there is but one other native of the east fighting for their own freedom; the partisans of the Central European Council, lead by the infamous Michał Vituška, a former collaborator, one who personally sent many Jews to their bloody deaths.\n\nVituška must die for his crimes!"
 
 #A Temporary Pact
 UPO_a_temporary_pact:0 "A Temporary Pact"
 UPO_a_temporary_pact_desc:0 "Vituška lives for one more night. Our Partisans will approach his forces and offer a temporary ceasefire, so that we both may better slaughter the invader. Of course, any hope that Vituška will keep to his word is held in futility, for a snake has no loyalties but to his own power. Our Partisans will fight together, but they will not be comrades. We will work with him, but we will not collaborate. We will not be Vituška's salvation, but his end. As we stand shoulder to shoulder with the snake's militias and paramilitaries, we craft venom of our own, all the better to end him with."
 UPO_a_temporary_pact_tt:0 "We will have §Gpeace§! with Vituska and his ilk, if only for now..."
 
 #Sooner than Later...
 UPO_sooner_than_later:0 "Sooner Than Later..."
 UPO_sooner_than_later_desc:0 "Poisoned words and honeyed promises will not bring back the children slaughtered under Vituška's gaze. He and his CEC gleefully served the Nazis when it served them, and when they, too, felt the jackboot's heel on their necks they played the righteous man. Even now, they skirmish with the Nazis, all the while promising the enslaved peoples of Ostland freedom and justice.\n\nThese things will come, but not under Vituška's command. Preparations have begun for a strike upon Belarus, one that Vituška will never see coming. The snake has stuck his neck out to fight the German, and in one fell swoop we will stomp it to dust."
 
 UPO_a_tree_falls:0 "A Tree Falls;"
 UPO_a_tree_falls_desc:0 "The forests of Ostland blaze with fire and death : Death for collaborator and partisan both, fire as ever more join the desperate struggle for control of the woods. Vituška refuses to roll over and die quickly, and so his execution will transform to a long and painful one.\n\nThe forest shudders as the trees are hastily cut down for Vituška's lines of defense, the animals are slaughtered for emergency rations, and the rivers are poisoned with lead and blood.\n\nBut we know these forests well. We fought and died in them in the war; they have become as much a part of us as we are part of them. As we are cloaked in shadow, they will never see - or hear - us coming."
 
 UPO_and_noone_hears_it:0 "And There Was Noone to Hear It"
 UPO_and_noone_hears_it_desc:0 "The time has come. In spite of all of the Collaborator's traps, we pressed on. Despite the bodies he threw at us like bullets, we pressed on. And in the end, despite his pleas for mercy, we will press on.\n\nThe name Vituška will be forever remembered as that of a traitor who met his just end at our hands."
