HIS_Hispaniola_War: "The Hispaniolan Conflict"
HIS_Hispaniola_War_desc: "Hispaniola has been torn by war ever since both nations that inhabit it have had their independence. After the American occupation ended, however, things appeared to calm down, with the elections of Lescot Sr., a friend of Trujillo, possibly signaling a new age of peace between the two states.\n\nThings would not remain like this for long. With the two dictators butting heads soon after and as American interference in Haiti once more increased, tensions between the two nations began growing again over time. With clashes on the borders between the two being frequent, the larger and better trained Dominican army broke the agreed 1936 borders and occupied Haitian land.\n\nWith the Haitian army barely being able to control its own territory as guerrillas dominate the countryside, the invasion and occupation came to be a national embarrassment that has only deepened the pit that the Haitian government found itself in. With revanchism being in the mind of many, it is almost inevitable that war on the island is bound to break out again, sooner or later."

PPI_civil_war: "The Dominican Civil War"
PPI_civil_war_desc: "The present parlous state of our Republic brings into stark relief the way in which the best efforts and plans of humanity fail to survive in the face of folly and faithlessness. Our work was insufficient to promote a diplomatic solution to the present chaos, and now the whole of Quisqueya bleeds.\n\nToday, ruthless effort is demanded of us. This is a final showdown between the old order and the new, a brutish time of monsters out of which only one faction can emerge victorious. Woe to the vanquished; into the victor's hands shall fall the right to chart the future of the Dominican Republic."

# Leader descs
POLITICS_HAI_DEJOIE_DESC: "Descendant of a French slaveholder and of President Fabre Geffrard, who threw down the Second Haitian Empire, President Louis Déjoie has not had to go far to attain his present position. Though he might protest otherwise, for the average Haitian it is clear that the Presidency was as much a hand-me-down to Déjoie as his sugar plantations and landholdings.\n\nDéjoie was born the son of wealthy landowners; cozying up to the Establishment was in his DNA. It made all the more sense, then, that he would tie himself closely to his friend and mentor, Élie Lescot. Twenty years of mulattocratic government passed, and Déjoie joined his boss in enriching himself.\n\nMeanwhile, things changed. Dewey's government—that had been so loyal to the Lescot presidency passed on, and things became incrementally more difficult with time. Eventually Lescot was sent out, and a successor was sitting in the office next door: need one say who it was? The answer was obvious even to the most out-of-touch diplomat's wife or to the poorest, most oppressed black citizen.\n\nSome feel enough shame about open corruption and oligarchy where they try to deliver to the average people as a sort of quid pro quo. Not Déjoie—to him there is no use changing things from the way Lescot used to do them. He may be his own man, but he is as much an avatar of the mulattocracy as his predecessor, and just as willing to keep the levers of power in mulatto hands as Lescot was."
POLITICS_HAI_JACQUES_STEPHEN_DESC: "It is said that to be a Haitian is to be an African, but Jacques-Stephen Alexis takes the sentiment one step further. To him, the same is true in reverse, with Haiti itself being an amalgamation of African culture and identity. This in turn creates a dream of a future that would one day connect the island nation to the ancestral homeland via a united struggle against colonialism.\n\nBorn in Gonaïves, Haiti in 1922, Jacques-Stephen Alexis began his academic pursuits from a young age, eventually attending school in both France and the United States to study medicine. While abroad, he developed both an appreciation for writing and communism, both of which he viewed as tools to be used to help his downtrodden nation escape her captors.\n\nA strong contributor to the "Negritude" movement, aimed at promoting a positive and affirming African identity, Alexis engaged with pan-African ideals early in his life via his writing. He also began traveling in socialist circles, enjoying the anti-imperialist aspect of the various Marxist ideologies, and eventually went on to lead the PPLN as his support grew in the countryside.\n\nAs the PPLN consolidates its power with Alexis at the helm, it has become apparent that there is a new chapter being written in Haitian history, one that could propel it away from the colonial influence of the West and into the arms of her overseas brothers and sisters. Jacques only hopes that the United States and other foreign powers won't be able to undermine his movement as they have tried so many times before."
POLITICS_HAI_CANTAVE_DESC: "If there is one thing that General Léon Cantave can always spare time for, it is listening to someone or another criticise democracy and socialism—for, with time, that has become one of his own favourite pastimes.\n\nThe old governance of Haiti was at best flawed. The 'democratically' 'elected' presidents, Lescot and Déjoie, were at best corrupt egomaniacs and at worst simple drooling imbeciles only competent at taking things for themselves. What did one need to read antidemocratic propaganda in Haiti, when the mulattocrats were more than enough proof of its flaws?\n\nThen it emerged that Haitians were being led astray by socialism. How the Haitian people could make such an error was beyond him. Were the disasters of socialist-adjacent France, of the Spanish Republicans, of Cuba and the Soviet Union, not a sufficient warning against following that path?\n\nObviously, this could not stand, and the army did not let it stand—instead, Léon Cantave took power and removed the socialists and democrats from control over the nation. Adherents of decadent, failed ideologies may complain—but their opinions matter not. Léon Cantave, now President of the Republic of Haiti, will assume sole responsibility for the Haitian people. Since everyone else has failed, let them be silent: Cantave will handle everything from now on."
POLITICS_HAI_FIGNOLE_DESC: "Haiti has witnessed upon years of instability and misery, years of racialist misgovernance by which the Haitian people were subtracted in shadowy transactions. Decades of folly piled upon folly passed wherein the nation suffered, and the Dominicans and others gained advantage after advantage at the expense of the Haitian government and people alike.\n\nIt was not as if Daniel 'le Professeur' Fignolé sat by and did nothing while his country bled. A thoroughgoing liberal, he defied the Lescot and Déjoie governments day in and day out. Lescot's lot retaliated against Fignolé frequently: if he wrote denunciations, his paper was closed and he would get fired. But it had its benefit—his fiery orations gained him the popularity of the people, who held "woulo konpresè" or "steamroller" strikes against the mulattocrat tyranny.\n\nDefeat after defeat was demoralizing but Fignolé would've been content to keep fighting even unto death. But things changed: Franck Lavaud's junta was unable to govern dictatorially, and the new President was even more frightened of a Dominican attack than he was of democrats or communists. Therefore, he turned to 'the Professor'—and convinced the remnants of the elite to accept Fignolé as president at the same time as Fignolé convinced people further left than he to settle his governance for a time.\n\nNow the Haitian nation is united behind a single leader for a time. Armed forces, wealthy landowners, socialist revolutionaries, and the common labourer must work together until Trujillo joins Napoleon and all the other tyrants six feet under ground. By all that is good, Fignolé swears, he will not rest until freedom rings in every settlement on the island."
POLITICS_HAI_FRANCOIS_DUVALIER_DESC: "The mulattos call François Duvalier a dangerous man, a threat to law and order. The Afro-Haitian majority—especially those most hostile to the élite and most strongly adherent to Négritude and black nationalism—regard him as the bearer of their hopes. The military, who are the other half of his support base, call him 'a good sort'.\n\nBut everyone—starting with the patients he served so diligently in his younger days and continuing to military men, foreigners, and diplomats—calls him Papa Doc.\n\nWhere his path to power was not at all certain, his views always were: racism and violence that occurred during the United States occupation of Haiti in the late 1910s inspired black nationalism among Haitians and left a powerful impression on the young Duvalier. Duvalier saw the poor black majority and their resentment against the mulattocracy. Supporting Pan-African ideals, he became involved in the local Négritude movement, beginning a long and chaotic political journey interrupted by returns to his medical doctorate—\n\n—and now, suddenly, by an upset victory, he is President of Haiti. Most believe that he will destroy the old mulattocrat elite and oppose the Americans; beyond that, however, his policies are anyone's guess, and he may well travel down a path no-one was expecting."
POLITICS_HAI_HUDICOURT_DESC: "Haiti has witnessed upon years of instability and misery, years of racialist misgovernance by which the Haitian people were subtracted in shadowy transactions. Decades of folly piled upon folly passed wherein the nation suffered, and the Dominicans and others gained advantage after advantage at the expense of the Haitian government and people alike.\n\nMax Lélio Hudicourt was not one to sit around while the nation was betrayed. His venerable old uncle, Senator Pierre Hudicourt, mentored him and watched approvingly as the young man became known as a gifted orator and contributor to left-wing thought in Haiti. Graduating as a lawyer, Hudicourt the younger became an employee of his senatorial uncle's firm.\n\nHudicourt's left-wing thoughts were offensive to the US, to Sténio Vincent, to Élie Lescot, to all the despotisms and hegemonies within and outside Haiti. They were not satisfied to disagree with him, either—time and again they tortured him, arrested him and his friends, shuttered his publications and expelled him from his places of work. But none of this deterred him; instead, it tempered his steel—and unified many sections of Haitian society in admiration for him.\n\nNow, the hour has come: the government has one way or another given way, and Hudicourt is now in charge. Much relies on him, and many disparate factions have put their faith in him to stabilize the United Front and transition it into a permanent, functional government. By the people and all their merits Hudicourt swears that he will honour their trust or die in the attempt."
POLITICS_HAI_LAVAUD_DESC: "If one peers into the office of former General, now President, Franck Lavaud, one sees many of the trappings of the old mulattocratic government of Lescot and his successor, who Lavaud characterizes as "Lescot's running dog Déjoie," left strewn on the floor, thrown down from their old perches. Small wonder, when Lavaud has taken it upon himself to do away with his former bosses' asinine racialist policies to the best of his ability.\n\nThe Lescot and Déjoie (mis)governance existed for almost as long as Lavaud was in active service as a general. Assuming control of the Garde d'Haiti and the Ministry of Defense in 1944, he watched as Lescot's over-proximity to Trujillo permitted the latter to gain advantage after advantage at Haiti's expense. Meanwhile, while the mulattocratic élite kept singing that pervert's praises, all Lavaud could see from Trujillo was the same old ambition to do as they had always wanted to do and annex Haiti.\n\nWith time Haiti's lack of readiness became intolerable. Were the Lescot government to remain in power, either Trujillo's dream would become reality faster than Lavaud could say 'putain de merde', or the masses of Port-au-Prince would fly into an abject rage and hand the country over to communist maniacs. So he did what any other military man would do in his situation—throw down the President, mobilise the military, and initiate sorely needed reforms.\n\nLavaud is not like le Professeur or Kanson Fè. Democracy or tolerance for the left, these are not in his vocabulary. But obliterating the mulattocracy? Oh, that's something Lavaud is all too happy to do—for only an imbecile would dare say the mulatto élites have done worth a damn of good with their power to the present day."
POLITICS_HAI_LESCOT_DESC: "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\n\nFrom the outset of his governance, President Antoine Louis Léocardie Élie Lescot has ruled by his own will and his own will alone. Juvenal's Satires held the mindset of "thus I will it, so I order it; let my will replace reasoned judgment" in contempt: Lescot, on the other hand, embraced it enthusiastically.\n\nTwenty years of kleptocratic corruption—or, as Lescot calls it, strategic direction of funds—combined with a method of governance denounced as regressive by everyone except Lescot and his friends and beneficiaries preserved his hold on power even as the Allies lost the Second World War and the Dominican Republic fell into chaos. But alas, the blacks did not understand their rightful place—below the mulattos and whites—and began to revolt; Lescot had no choice but to abdicate to his understudy.\n\nWell, that time is no more; the interregnum has ended. Lescot has returned to power, even if the masses below him are complaining as loudly as they ever have. The Americans will do their duty, and preserve his government as they did once before; the will of the people of Haiti need not factor into any decisions. All that matters is that the right people remain in charge, and that the right person sits at their head."
POLITICS_HAI_MAGLOIRE_DESC: "General Paul Eugène Magloire, referred to as Kanson Fè (Iron Pants) by Haitians, is now the last hope of the common man of a nation besieged by internal divisions and eyed upon by foreign threats.\n\nMagloire has a checkered past. Sometimes, he has stood against despotism, but other times he has opportunistically supported it. At one time he was one of Lescot's most loyal supporters in the military—but then he saw the rage of the common people and decided it would be more prudent to throw the mulattocrat and his successor out.\n\nNow the situation is sensitive, for Haiti is beleaguered in two directions. Though there is some support from outside, the nation's defense must be competently and cautiously executed. The Haitian government must work in a broad coalition, with all desirous to work for the stability of the Nation welcomed and given a role to play.\n\nYet more importantly, the mistakes and folly of Cantave's dictatorship must be undone, and democracy and high liberalism take their place. Otherwise, the nation will have survived 150 years of difficulties for nothing."

# Ideas
HAI_Mulatocratie: "La Mulâtocratie"
HAI_Mulatocratie_desc: "As American troops landed in the Republic of Haiti and its occupation of the nation began, collaborators who would work with the US in the new regime. These would be the mulatto elite of the Republic, being propelled to powerful political and economic positions, giving them much control over the state. This system came to be known as the "mulattocracy" by many in the country and was deeply associated with the United States and its influence over the country.\n\nWhile this positive discrimination would only worsen after the Lescot Sr. government refused to bulge on the status quo and implement reforms, many would begin putting their hopes in Pierre Déjoie and his reformist platform, promising to bring the much-needed changes to the state. While economically the nation has seen a revival, politically it got nothing more than token reforms to a crumbling status-quo, leading many to lose hope in the government and instead turn to opposition groups."
HAI_Mulatocratie_Lavaud: "La Mulâtocratie"
HAI_Mulatocratie_Lavaud_desc: "As American troops landed in the Republic of Haiti and its occupation of the nation began, the mulatto elite acted as collaborators to the new regime. In turn, they were propelled to powerful political and economic positions, giving them much control over the state. This system of "mulattocracy" has been deeply associated with the United States and its influence over Haiti.\n\nDespite the regression suffered under Lescot Sr. and the false promises of Déjoie, the regime of Frank Lavaud has begun to actually implement reforms aimed at rooting out many of these corrupt practices. This includes opening government positions to Black Haitians and in turn reducing the domination by the mulatto elite. As the reforms are implemented, however, it is evident that the "mulattocracy" will continue to maintain a disproportionate level of control in Haiti so long as the United States still has a hand in the nation's politics."
HAI_La_Fausse_Democratie: "La Fausse Démocratie"
HAI_La_Fausse_Democratie_desc: "With the end of the Haitian Civil War, Lavaud found himself in a situation in which his reformist faction became the dominant party in the Haiti political scene, able to implement many of the changes he was incapable of beforehand. Every day, Lavaud and his party become bolder and bolder in their attempts to dismantle the "mulattocracy" through anti-corruption measures coupled with bureaucratic cycling.\n\nDespite this, it is evident that corruption will survive the ruling elite. Lavaud's party has no intention of democratizing a nation they now govern unopposed, and for many in Haiti life will go on much as it has for the past decades."
HAI_Le_Souverain: "Le Souverain"
HAI_Le_Souverain_desc: "With the shifting of the tides, the "mulattocracy" of Haiti has been swept under the waves of black nationalism. Duvalier's sudden rise and consolidation of power under his right-wing populist party has seen attacks on the upper-class mulatto elite, seeking to strip the power that they have accumulated under American involvement and give it to black Haitians.\n\nAdvocating a removal of US influence from the island, there is now less support from abroad to fight the PPLN and internal enemies of the regime. Duvalier is confident, however, that he and his supporters in the military can prevail against all threats that abound the unstable nation."
HAI_La_Tonton_Macoute: "La Tonton Macoute"
HAI_La_Tonton_Macoute_desc: "The old man who disappears unruly children by throwing them into his sack is a common folklore trope throughout the world. But in Haiti this supernatural figure really does exist, with a legion using his name to strike terror and fear into their enemies. From top to bottom, nobody is safe from disappearance, rape, or public murder. At the top of it all is one man: François Duvalier.\n\nDuvalier, having survived all the challenges to his rule that came before, now cements his regime firmly in Haiti's soil. His National Unity Party has supplanted the mulatto elite with one based on loyalty. His MVSN paramilitary enforces the will of one of the most totalitarian regimes in the history of the Americas. Holding a personalist state backed by violence and mysticism, Duvalier is nigh unassailable, at the cost of the entire nation living in fear and dread."
HAI_La_Cantavecratie: "La Cantavecratie"
HAI_La_Cantavecratie_desc: "Once there was a ruling group of mulattos in Haiti. A select few who thought they knew better than anyone else by virtue of their race and birth. They failed. Today there is instead one man who makes the decisions, and he alone knows what the masses really need. His name is Leon Cantave.\n\nCantave's self-centered dictatorship has no need for false, plutocratic democracy. The focus is on exterminating Communists that rot the structure of the country from within. Even though he accepts American aid, he falls short of the more high minded ideals of the Organization of Free Nations with a regime that grows more repressive by the day. All this makes him a headache to DC. However, he promised an end to the PPLN, and he makes good on those words, so the OFN has no choice but keep quiet."

HAI_Professionalism_Army_3: "Militia Army"
HAI_Professionalism_Army_2: "Militia Army"
HAI_Professionalism_Army_1: "Militia Army"

HAI_Occupation: "Everlasting American Presence"
HAI_Occupation_desc: "While the occupation of Haiti by the United States nominally ended in 1934, with the last of the American troops leaving the nation by that same year, the influence of the occupier however wouldn't disappear just like that, as the US has kept control over the policies of the nation thus far.\n\nWhile some hoped that this would eventually come to fade away as time went on, the defeat of the Allies in the Second World War would change American plans for the region. Supporting the Lescot Sr. government in its clamping down on student and popular protests, the US once again took an active role in the country's politics, making sure that the region continued under its sphere of influence. However, their backing of pro-American oligarchs has inevitably resulted in many joining opposition groups who now engage in guerrilla warfare against the government with the goal of kicking the Americans out.\n\nWith these guerrillas only growing in strength after the success of the Cuban Revolution, the Haitian government has only become a larger and larger resource drain for the OFN, who now rely on "safekeeping troops" to guarantee some semblance of control. On both sides of the aisle, everyone questions how much longer the never-ending occupation can truly last."
HAI_Renewed_Haitian_Sovereignty: "Renewed Haitian Sovereignty"
HAI_Renewed_Haitian_Sovereignty_desc: "With the withdrawal of American military presence from Haiti and the resolution of the inner conflicts, the nation has once more been able to assert its sovereignty in its own affairs. In place of foreign soldiers, a small but growing military under sole command of Port-au-Prince has been nurtured into a standing army that will serve to give the nation defensive autonomy for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile many institutional problems still remain hovering over Haiti, the market growth and reinforced self determination has given many in the country hope that things may at least be getting better."
HAI_Struggle_for_Sovereignty: "Struggle for Sovereignty"
HAI_Struggle_for_Sovereignty_desc: "Duvalier does not enjoy American influence in Haiti, but considering the circumstances and his preference for US soft power over Dominican hard power, he is playing along with the OFN for now. At times his regime is easy to work with, at times it seeks to distance itself from the American agenda, and occasionally it has little to say at all. It is certainly a dynamic relationship, as well as quite tenuous.\n\nBut an alliance of convenience is a fickle thing. If Washington fails to properly intervene in Haitian affairs, the small nation may break away or succumb to invasion. Of course, such intervention could also cause devastating push back from Port-au-Prince if unchecked."

HAI_Noirisme_Socialism: "The Ghost of Roumain"
HAI_Noirisme_Socialism_desc: "After decades of economic and social inequality, with the mulatto aristocracy dominating every facet of the state, the ideals of Socialism and Noirism have become ingrained into the consciousness of the Black population of Haiti. However, while Noirism has always dominated the ideology of the opposition, the guerrilla-favoring Socialists, emboldened by the Cuban Revolution, have seen a rapid rise in popularity and support, leading to clashes between groups that supported either one of these.\n\nThese two, however, are coming to find themselves united under a single banner, with the issues of class and racial identity no longer being opposite but instead intertwined with one another. Bringing back the Pan-Africanism of Jacques Roumain that had all but died with him in 1944, Jacques-Stephen Alexis and his Parti d'Entente Populaire now dominates the opposition against the government, denouncing both the Americans and Trujillo, becoming widely popular in the process."
HAI_Rising_PPLN_Insurgency: "Rising PPLN Insurgency"
HAI_Rising_PPLN_Insurgency_desc: "After the chaos and carnage of the Puerto Plata Invasion, instability has flooded over the border with the Dominican Republic on the backs of refugees. This has created an opportunity for the PPLN, a socialist rebel organization, to grow in strength and boldness, culminating in a situation in which the government is quickly being drawn towards confrontation.\n\nThis insurgency threatens to engulf Haiti in war unless drastic action is taken. However, the international community places little faith in the government's ability to effectively reform or counter the rebels in effective time."
HAI_Protracted_Guerrilla_Campaign: "Protracted Guerrilla Campaign"
HAI_Protracted_Guerrilla_Campaign_desc: "Guerrillas have mobilized in the East and Southwest of Haiti, creating a situation in which government forces no longer have control over portions of the countryside. The situation has yet to devolve into civil war, yet rebel numbers grow by the day as the PPLN weaponizes discontent with Port-au-Prince and anti-American sentiment.\n\nThe government is now gearing up for a fight for the survival of the existing ruling apparatus, a task which will now likely only be solved through violent confrontation, one way or another. It is time to start requesting foreign aid."

HAI_LUnite_Instable: "L'Unité Instable"
HAI_LUnite_Instable_desc: "Desperate times create strange and impossible political realities, and none more so than war. With the invasion by the Dominican Republic, Haiti has found its tense internal situation turned upside down as pragmatism forces the various parties to put a hold on their differences to fight off occupation. This "united front" seeks to hold the oligarchic establishment, reformists, and PPLN together for the duration of the conflict, allowing for greater resistance to Trujillo's legions.\n\nWhile many would see this as an opportunity for Haiti to overcome its horrifying instability, history gives little reason for much optimism in a country gripped by its divisions, even if they are able to win the current struggle."
HAI_La_Renaissance_dHaiti: "La Renaissance d'Haïti"
HAI_La_Renaissance_dHaiti_desc: "Despite the pessimistic outlook of the international community, the carnage and devastation of war, and internal divisions once thought impossibly wide, Haiti has emerged from the invasion by the Dominican Republic reforged anew. The "united front" between the establishment, reformists, and PPLN has held, and although no party is entirely satisfied, none are willing to once more take up arms against their fellow countrymen.\n\nCaution prevails as multiethnic democracy is tried in Haiti, a nation so used to being dominated by racial tensions that this period can only be described as experimental. Despite corruption still remaining an issue, however, the economic growth and newly accessible government has fostered a sense of hope in the common man that the worst may finally be behind them."

HAI_Haitian_Social_Revolution: "Haitian Social Revolution"
HAI_Haitian_Social_Revolution_desc: "It is no easy task to redirect social forces away from destructive racial conflict and towards healing the scars it left. Haiti under the new socialist regime attempts to engender a new era of equality and harmony, unifying a racially diverse working class against what remains of capitalism in their nation. These attempts have seen mixed results; those scars run too deep to fade so quickly. But if they succeed, then the dreams of Louverture, Dessalines and Pétion will finally be made reality."
HAI_LArmee_Rouge_dHaiti: "L'Armée Rouge d'Haïti"
HAI_LArmee_Rouge_dHaiti_desc: "With the revolution of the PPLN successful comes the ongoing process of reforming Haitian military strength; the absence of US peacekeepers to shore up our defense forces us into the position of rebuilding our armies from scratch, training from Dominican communist partisans and Cuban guerrilla fighters work tirelessly to aid in this effort, and while the spirit of the Haiti's freedom fighters are to be lionized, it is going to take some time before Haiti can transition from a ramshackle militia into a fully professionalized army."
HAI_Socialist_Economy: "Socialist Economy"
HAI_Socialist_Economy_desc: "The Haitian government has recently directed its efforts towards building a new economy out of the elite playground over which the PRH presided. Good news: staple goods are becoming much cheaper, and economic activity is centred around uplifting the whole of Haitian society. Bad news: limiting exports limits revenue, and Haiti's lack of industrialisation hinders its productive capacity. Such are the pitfalls of an early socialist economy, from which Haiti is attempting to climb out."
HAI_Exiles_and_Enemies: "Exiles and Enemies"
HAI_Exiles_and_Enemies_desc: "Even after the people of Haiti emerged triumphant over the forces of imperialism, detractors to the new regime in Port-au-Prince are seemingly without end; from the US-backed remnants of the last regime, to the far-right nationalists of Duvalier, Yet it doesn't stop there; the limited recognition of the new government, no doubt spurred on by joint American/OFN denunciations, have left Haiti with increasingly few allies to contrast its ever-growing list of enemies, all enough to make our strive for legitimacy in the Caribbean a daunting one indeed."

HIS_HAI_decision.1.desc: "Not everything could be shipped - or airlifted - into inner Haiti at Washington's convenience, despite the geographic proximity of America to Hispaniola.\n\nShipping, naturally, was limited to the coastal cities, and there were no airfields immediately suitable for rapid cargo transfers into the heart of the Haitian mountains. For the communities and forward bases deep in the Haitian hinterland, porters and mules still did the work they had done centuries ago - tying together isolated outposts with blood, sweat, and toil.\n\nThat had left, in general, one tool to improve the island's infrastructure: railways. The American occupation at the start of the century had left a patchwork of rail lines dotting the country. Many of the rails had warped in the heat, their ties rotting after decades of disuse, and the network was nowhere near sufficient to meet the demands made of it.\n\nBut the work would be simple enough. Railway tracks and ties could be repaired with hard labor and simple imports of steel, and if one wasn't picky about electrification or imported diesel, a steam engine could be run with charcoal. The repaired lines, stretching from Leogane to Verettes via Port-au-Prince, could take supplies partway into the interior - from which the grateful porters and mule trains could then make multiple supply runs to their final destination.\n\nThere was little flashy or glamorous about the work - laying ties, repairing rails, manning depots - but it would do the job."
HIS_HAI_decision.1.a: "Sometimes the old ways are best."

HIS_HAI_decision.2.t: "Beyond a Coat of Paint"
HIS_HAI_decision.2.desc: "The bumpy landing at Bowen Field was, in hindsight, a good indication of what lay ahead for the OFN survey corps as they began their inspection of the Haitian Air Corps.\n\nThe runway was cracked across its entire length, with the maintenance crews having made no real effort to pave over pockmarked craters at the edges of the tarmac. The USAF C-130 found there was no hangar available, in a very literal sense - finding just the rotting, holed frame of a corrugated steel structure next to a dilapidated control tower.\n\nA crew of U.S. maintenance crew conducted walk-arounds with slack jaws and wide eyes, as the handful of P-51 Mustangs hadn't been kept under protective covers to shield them from the elements. Several had been kept in working condition, though few were willing to bet their lives on a joyride; the others were shells of their former selves, having been cannibalized for parts long ago.\n\nInside the aerodrome's command building, the manuals and training materials had gathered dust and mold, nearly two decades out of print and having seen minimal use during that time. What pilots remained with the force found more use scrubbing floors and providing base 'security' for the absent commander, who had been absent for nearly a week."
HIS_HAI_decision.2.a: "The air force would need to be rebuilt from the ground up."

HIS_HAI_decision.3.t: "Burn 'Em, Break 'Em"
HIS_HAI_decision.3.desc: ""Douglas, you know what we're hauling tonight?" O'Harris asked his co-pilot, checking the instruments to his C-130.\n\n"Depends, O'Harris, what's a 'Defoliant'? I know Terry's crew was bringing out Napalm southbound, but I've got no clue what the hell this stuff is." Douglas replied as he sat down in his pilot's chair adjacent O'Harris. O'Harris felt a faint memory take the forefront of his thoughts, then snapped his fingers as he recognized the term.\n\n"Ooh, defoliants, those are the stuff my dad would work with when he was a gardener; they're like a chemical you spray on plants to kill 'em dead. Th'stuff works freaky fast, a pal of his breathed it in once and had to get checked out. He was fine, but he got some messed up bone issues down the road. Why d'you think we're bringin' defoliants to the Haitians?" O'Harris asked rhetorically.\n\n"Well, that and Napalm." Douglas replied, "Seems like we're finally giving our guys a fighting chance."\n\nThe takeoff and first few minutes of the flight went by smoothly. The air between O'Harris and Douglas was calm as it normally tended to be, but the two could tell that the both of them were a little shaken up.\n\n"Hey, Douglas?" O'Harris said, "Don't worry about it. This stuff won't be able to hurt too many people.""

HIS_HAI_decision.4.t: "Aboulomania"
HIS_HAI_decision.4.desc: "Jerry and Carl shared a cigarette as they watched over the dulled midnight lights of the industrial district from the relative comfort of inside their car. It was difficult to label as a celebration, but Jerry and Carl could only revel in the good news of the last years. Jerry took another drag, and Carl pulled out a small bottle of hootch from his coat pocket.\n\n"You know what I need right now, Jerry?" Carl asked, already reaching for the radio dials.\n\n"Swear to God, Carl, you put on some more of that stoner shit and I put this out in your-" Jerry's voice was cut out by the last notes of a late-night Jazz session. The familiar voice of their favored radio host began to clear his throat, leaving Jerry and Carl to lean back and relax.\n\n"Welcome back to the People's Radio, dear listeners, and I've just been presented a dire, dire letter from a friend of mine in the Pentagon." Jerry and Carl stopped what they were doing.\n\n"It seems that after the Haitian regime began to falter in strength against the popular PPLN revolt once the United States pulled out... the President has begun to place elements from the Army back into Haiti. America is back in Haiti." the voice said.\n\n"They can't do that! How much fucking protesting have we done?!" Carl yelled. The radio host piped up again.\n\n"Yes, we do have confirmation that America will be 'recommitting several military elements to Haiti in light of the escalation of the Communist rebels.' I don't need to tell you, folks, that this is bullshit! I say, this Saturday, we all get together to show these goddamned aristocrats that we stopped it before, and we can again! Something tells me our numbers sure as hell aren't shrinking, I can tell you that!""

HIS_HAI_decision.5.t: "Past MACH Speed"
HIS_HAI_decision.5.desc: "Some American military personnel in Haiti flew spotter planes, others advised Haitian Armed Forces troops, but most, like Air Force Major Isaac Hanson, did paperwork. He had been doing paperwork in Haiti for almost a year with the Air Force Operations Group and rose from filing paperwork at the office to delivering it in the field. The usual circuit was between Port-au-Prince and the department capitals, but today's orders were special; escalating American commitments in Haiti needed a centralized command, and because of that, AFOG had to go. In its place was Military Assistance Command, Haiti, whose existence Major Hanson now had to make known.\n\nMACH's true purpose eluded Hanson, and his curiosity got the best of him on the boat ride to Gonâve Island. With cigarettes and a Coke bottle in one hand and classified documents in the other, Hanson learned that the new inter-service command had plans to expand American presence everywhere in Haiti, even Gonâve Island. After finishing the file and exhausting his capacity to count clouds, his boat pulled into Magasin. Major Hanson discovered the American consulate and Army attache in a shabby hotel, far from being the future hub of MACH operations on Gonâve.\n\nInside were dusty portraits of Estes Kefauver on the walls, cigarette butts jammed into cracked tabletops, and a cadre of bored men playing cards for drinks. "Lieutenant Sawyer? Sawyer?" echoed Hanson into the lobby, where the commiserating men suddenly ceased chatting. After a pause, one man feigned attention, which elicited some snickers, before returning, "Sawyer. What's it?" After identifying himself as Major Hanson of the new united Military Assistance Command, the men paid him more attention. Hanson briefed them on upcoming changes to their isolated station, most notably the imminent arrival of three hundred personnel tasked with restoring occupation-era facilities for everyday use. The men were baffled, shocked that their easy-street assignment had suddenly turned serious, and Sawyer begged Hanson to help. Instead, the Major simply shirked him off."

HIS_HAI_decision.6.t: "The Flight of the Dragon Lady"
HIS_HAI_decision.6.desc: "At his service ceiling of 75,000 feet, practically the entire island of Hispaniola lies within Arthur Leatherwood's field of vision - an island of green with over 7 million inhabitants, observed from a single U2 cockpit.\n\nWhile most would only dream of coming seemingly within arms reach of outer space, for him this was just one of many intelligence gathering sorties that had begun recently as ordered by the FBI. In order to capture photographs of army bases, important government buildings, large troop movements, or wherever the bureau sent him, Arthur wielded the Hycon Model B camera, a cutting-edge piece of technology that featured a resolution as low as 2 feet, all while at an altitude of over 14 miles.\n\nPilots like him are running sorties daily now, giving our Haitian allies unparalleled intelligence on the status of Dominican army units, allowing them the element of surprise, and aiding their struggle against the tyrannical Santo Domingo regime."
HIS_HAI_decision.6.a: "It must get lonely up there."

HIS_HAI_decision.7.t: "An Afternoon Interruption"
HIS_HAI_decision.7.desc: "Nestled deep in the mountains of the Tiburon Peninsula, the small village of Annette had long been thought as a safe haven, hidden away from the constant warfare that had gripped the nation throughout the civil war, bloodshed never reaching the resident's doorsteps. One afternoon, however, was all it took to shatter that illusion into pieces.\n\nAgainst the clear, orange tinted sky, over a dozen helicopters could be seen approaching, their metal blades whirring together in a cacophony of machinery and rotary madness. As they hovered over the village center and began descending, the guerrilla members that had based themselves there hunkered down and barricaded themselves in their homes along with their families, while many villagers gathered outside in protest, demanding the soldiers leave them be.\n\nThe American soldiers disembarked, and began sweeping house to house. Those who put up a fight quickly found themselves woefully underprepared, and little resistance was put up by most. Those who barricaded themselves found their home set alight, killing militants and any other unfortunate soul who found themselves inside. By the time they left, half the village was left ablaze, and every resident was left scarred for life, gripped by a terror they had always thought to be safe from."
HIS_HAI_decision.7.a: "The raging fire replaced the setting sun."

HIS_HAI_decision.8.t: "Folklore, Fantasies, and Failure"
HIS_HAI_decision.8.desc: "FBI special agent Edward Lansdale stared at the table, surrounded by distraught colleagues in scrubs wielding scalpels and saws, and nodded his head in approval. In front of him lay the corpse of one unfortunate former Haitian guerrilla, captured while straying too far from camp. He had been turned into an unrecognizable abomination bearing claws and fur, a perverted attempt to recreate the legendary Loup-Garou, a man-wolf spirit that cannibalizes its way through Haiti, preying on children.\n\nIt is the latest attempt of many undertaken as part of a new, heightened psychological warfare campaign being waged by the FBI across Haiti. Using false-flag propaganda claiming communists are attacking peasants in the countryside and playing into perceived Vodou religious superstitions, Lansdale's efforts has drawn the ire of his colleagues, both within the bureau and especially with the allied Haitian government, citing extrajudicial execution of POW's for use as half-baked cultural appropriation as crossing a line.\n\nThe campaign has seen mixed results thus far, with attempts at playing into local legends being ignored by most, only affecting the most superstitious of guerrillas. Edward Lansdale, however, is not deterred by these setbacks, insisting he is on the verge of a breakthrough in the emerging psychological field of warfare."
HIS_HAI_decision.8.a: "An "edge", but at what cost?"

HIS_HAI_decision.9.t: "Hand-Me Downs"
HIS_HAI_decision.9.desc: "The barracks yard was near silent as the officers and soldiers eagerly crowded around the crate shipped in from Port-Au-Prince, fresh from U.S army reserve stocks. Finally, the Haitian battalion would receive much-needed rifles, grenades, and ammunition, straight from Uncle Sam. As they began inspecting the weapons, however, a sense of bitterness washed over the men.\n\n"This junk must have seen service during the first time they occupied our asses fifty years ago," an officer remarked, peering at a dusty old M1903 Springfield. Taking it out the box and feeding the top-loaded relic with a magazine, he took aim at a target downrange, and pulled the trigger. An audible CLICK was heard, followed by the sighing of nearby soldiers. The gun was jammed.\n\n"Looks like we have some work to do." The officer motioned for the guns to be passed out to the soldiers. "I want an inventory on all we got from the Americans - find out what works well enough and what needs fixing."\n\nIn the end, almost thirty percent of the weapons given to the unit needed some form of repair, ranging from jammed guns to entire missing parts."
HIS_HAI_decision.9.a: "Better than nothing."

HIS_HAI_decision.10.t: "Fresh Tarmac"
HIS_HAI_decision.10.desc: ""That about wraps it up." The US Air Force officer gave his last remarks, and with a firm handshake the agreement was one step away from completion. The air base would be officially transferred to the armed forces of Haiti, with sorties from the base expected to begin in the following days.\n\nThe process, involving maintenance training exercises, air traffic control transfer, equipment transfer and pilot acclamation took a matter of days, an impressive amount of time considering the overseas transport needed to move all personnel and equipment back to the United States. From now on, it would be Haitian airmen flying from here, a sign of the increased trust and cooperation between our armed forces, and the increased capability of the Haitian Air Force, a result of our continued trust and support.\n\n"All I need now is a signature right here." The officer pointed at the bottom of a document, then handed it over to his Haitian counterpart."
HIS_HAI_decision.10.a: ""Thank you.""

HIS_HAI_decision.11.t: "Peace On Hispañiola, For Now" # See you in the future buddy.
HIS_HAI_decision.11.desc: "As delegates shake hands, and calls to generals are made, the negotiated peace has finally been settled upon. America will abide by the agreed-upon terms, and the thousands of servicemen, equipment, and ships will begin the long trip back home.\n\nThough hailed publicly as a diplomatic victory, Americans both in the government and at home know that a negotiated settlement was never the intended ending of the Haitian intervention, and some are questioning our purpose in the conflict in the first place.\n\nHowever, regardless of the terms imposed by the negotiations, most are just glad that such an agreement was reached at all, ending the bloodshed for all involved, if at least temporarily. The effect this has on the domestic situation remains to be seen, with many divided on whether or not the whole endeavor has been worth the lives and investment."
HIS_HAI_decision.11.a: "May the peace last."
# Weariness Events
HIS_HAI_decision.12.t: "Parade"
HIS_HAI_decision.12.desc: "They came down Parade Place and onto Ocean Avenue. Some played jams as they cut their way across Brooklyn, singing Haitian folk songs and dancing to the beat of conga drums. Others carried hand-made banners that read things like, "Élections libres en Haïti maintenant!" or "Lanmò opresè kapitalis yo!"\n\nThere were blue and red flags and red and black flags. There were crucifixes and hammers and sickles. There were photos of dead soldiers and signs urging peace. People laughed and cried and danced and sang dressed in the colorful outfits they had salvaged from their homeland. A multitude of voices rang through the streets as people watched from their windows and fire escapes.\n\nIn short, the parade was all of Haiti. Though they disagreed about what the future of their home looked like, New York's community of expats and exiles were determined to make sure that no one in the city forgot about the violence raging in the south. America had a responsibility, an obligation to care. After all it had done to wound the first free black republic, the least the blans could do was to listen to them shout."
HIS_HAI_decision.12.a: "Many people, shouting with one voice."

HIS_HAI_decision.13.t: "Movie Night in Berkley"
HIS_HAI_decision.13.desc: ""So it's called 'The Torch of Democracy'? Why the hell did they name it that?" Richard asked. UC Berkley's "Committee for Haitian Intervention Opposition" was just the latest of what many Conservatives had begun to label as "Anti-American institutions", though the "CHIO" was little more than a small collection of anti-interventionist undergrads still trying to spread posters around their campus. The idea of an anti-interventionist documentary could have been a boon for them if they spread the word about movie showings.\n\n"Sure, 'Torch of Democracy'- it's because the movie's poster is a pic from what a TIME photographer caught sometime last month, Haitians burning a village. It's as anti-regime as it gets." Amelia affirmed. The rest of the CHIO members -all 12 of them- listened, unconvinced.\n\n"Amelia," Richard started, "the last theatre that showed this piece had pro-war protests outside stopping most people from getting in at all, and-"\n\n"And that was in Toledo, not Berkley. People are open-minded here, they'll at least give it a watch before they threaten arson, and by then they'll at least know it's not all sunshine and rainbows. People are dying, Richard, they have to know." Amelia said, some faces in the dozen assembled activists starting to nod. Richard fidgeted the slightest bit.\n\n"I mean, we can't really get permits for this, can we? They'd never allow it." he said unconvincingly.\n\n"Richard, this is our first chance in a while to spread awareness. People are starting to worry that this could turn into a nightmare for the OFN- and who cares if people protest the movie? At least they'll be forced to contemplate it before making up signs." Amelia said, now most of the other activists seemingly in agreement. Richard sighed."
HIS_HAI_decision.13.a: ""We get one shot at this. Don't mess it up.""

HIS_HAI_decision.14.t: "Helping Hands"
HIS_HAI_decision.14.desc: "The old, beaten truck slowed to a stop as the rest of the trucks and cars in their convoy parked themselves halfway through the Haitian village. Hesitantly stepping out of the driver's and passenger's seats respectively, Mark Mason walked to the front of the convoy, where the rest of the volunteer drivers had started to surround the leader who had been organizing their group for the last few months, as some of the locals of the village had begun to step outside their brick and wood hovels to investigate the outside parade of supply trucks. In the middle of the semi-circle of drivers, the volunteer leader was waving everyone towards him.\n\n"Perfect, right, trucks two through nine distribute their goods here, then hold your position until our convoy makes its way back here. Be nice to the locals, and let the translators do all the talking, you just haul the boxes. Understood?" Nobody responded. "Good. Rest of the trucks, with me." With that, the rest of the trucks drove off, leaving Mark with a dozen or so other aid workers, all entirely disoriented or already starting to work. After a moment, a short Haitian walked forward and began to yell at everyone to begin taking out their boxes to the city center. As everyone began walking back to their trucks, Mark noticed the Haitian walk to what seemed to be a local Haitian police officer and spoke with him.\n\nA few hours of backbreaking labor later, and Mark felt ready to call it a day, even if it was half-past noon. While Mark had been there for some weeks now and was used to the heavy labor, he was growing tired nonetheless under the ruthless Caribbean sun and occasional shouting of the Haitian. Mark felt ready to ask for a break, and so walked up to the short Haitian.\n\n"What the hell do you mean, break?!" he shouted, "Break?! You come here to work, you'll goddamned work, moun sòt!" Mark backed away, and began to walk back towards his truck. Looking over his shoulder, he noticed the officer handing the short Haitian an envelope."

HIS_HAI_decision.15.t: "Marching for Haiti"
HIS_HAI_decision.15.desc: "Richard watched the countless students and citizens march through San Francisco's Mission District, and felt himself fill with pride. The yells of protest calling for America's withdrawal from Haiti, the signs, and the media interviews all showed to the world how the people wanted America gone nearly as much as the Haitians did. What shocked Richard most, though, was the crowds. Even before he'd been a part of CHIO, Richard knew how to count the size of a crowd, and this crowd held an easy 10,000. Climbing down from the statue, Richard whisked through the crowd of the big figures at the top of the City Hall's steps, the interviews, the megaphone demands, trying his damnedest to find Amelia.\n\n"...Well, what it is for me and most other Black soldiers, is that these Socialists have done less to me and people like me than most White Americans have, I don't have to worry about Haitians lynching..."\n\n"...To hell with the war! To hell with their imperialism! If those businessmen and their lackeys think..."\n\n"...Brother's fighting in Haiti now, and he didn't have a fuckin' choice! They think they can drag us..."\n\n"...And now that little fuck's gotten himself lost! Wait, shit- Richard!" Richard recognized the voice.\n\n"Welcome to the party, Amelia! You believe we managed this all on our own?!" He yelled, ecstatic.\n\n"Richard, half these guys are from UCSF. Besides, we've got bigger issues. SFPD are already on their way, we gotta clear these people out."\n\n"No fucking way, Amelia- even if we wanted to. We're not leaving. We can't, and we won't. I don't care if they gas us and beat us, we're staying. The Haitians are already bleeding more. We owe it to them.""

HIS_HAI_decision.16.t: "Running From Americans"
HIS_HAI_decision.16.desc: "Richard ran through the dark LA streets, cupping an eye with one hand. The protest, technically, was a success, there had been certainly tens of thousands of people turning out- though the pro-war counter-protestors absolutely had the cops on their side. Had the pigs just stayed out of it, then the CHIO would've had a solid chance of winning the fight. Being on the receiving end of a beanbag round to the eye had made Richard rethink his position in this conflict. Shambling to a seemingly empty alleyway, Richard let his hand pull from his face, and even in the moonlit night he could see that those were not tears which had been running from his eye, but parts of his eye itself. Richard felt himself start to hyperventilate. Out of a corner of the alley, behind a dumpster, a hobo pulled himself into the light.\n\n"Oh-" Richard sniveled, "shit, sorry. Hey man, you want me to leave?" He asked. The hobo seemed to be adjusting his eyes to the night, and began to smile.\n\n"Shit, kid, you need help. I think I know a guy..." the hobo said with a chuckle, and slunk off into the street. Richard knew he shouldn't follow him. After a near half-hour of walking with him into the worst part of LA, the hobo led Richard into a warehouse with smokestacks rising from holes in the roof. Walking inside, it seemed to be a town's worth of people chatting or drinking. The hobo walked over to a collection of people laying on cots, all moaning in pain.\n\n"Alright, pal, this here's Dr. Mark Mason, he'll look after you. Mark?" the hobo asked, "Got you another revolutionary! Take a seat, kid."\n\nThe so-called "doctor" was absolutely no graduate from what Richard could tell, though he seemed smart enough. Looking around him, Richard recognized that everyone around him had been wearing anti-war symbols sewn into their clothing, if not in an armband-turned-tourniquet. Richard sighed."

HIS_HAI_decision.17.t: "Polarization"
HIS_HAI_decision.17.desc: "The Haitian War. It seemed that the topic was inescapable. Students on campuses joked about getting drafted for it. Businessmen complained about having to pay taxes for it. State legislators mulled how many benefits they would have to give out after it. There was a sense of it consuming the national discourse, overwhelming it. Everyone had an opinion, except that those opinions were increasingly bifurcated.\n\nFor those who supported the president, the war was, of course, a noble venture. While no one condoned the last time the United States invaded Haiti (for those who remembered it, there was a lingering distaste over the business), the current intervention was necessary, patriotic even. The United States was making the world safer for democracy, liberty, and freedom of all peoples. It was doing its duty to the world. Those who pointed out the violence, the growing anger, and the United States' manipulations were misguided or lying.\n\nFor those opposed to the president—a ragtag group of state parties and activists—the war was increasingly pointless and unjust. Whatever good the United States had intended to achieve (if it had ever had good intentions), had long been undone by its own actions. The United States was destroying Haitian lives, some said. The United States was butchering its own boys, others said. Conservative activists asked to know who would be paying for the cost of the intervention while bleeding heart liberals moaned about human rights abuses and the growing rumors of atrocities just across the Caribbean.\n\nIndeed, the war was consuming everything. State parties across the spectrum forced themselves to adopt positions for or against. The people grew harder in their convictions, convinced of the ill intentions of the other side."

He mouthed the word "thank you," as was expected for a major party candidate for the United States Senate, and then strode smiling toward the lectern and waited for the cheering of the crowd to die.\n\n"Folks," he said with forced folksiness. "I cannot tell you how grateful I am to be standing here today in front of you. The Establishment and the party bosses told us we couldn't do it, but we showed the media the power of our grassroots movement!"\n\nThere was another round of cheering. He gave his most brilliant smile, knowing the donors who had backed his campaign would emblazon it on the covers of their newspapers.\n\n"For too long, the elites in our society have been forcing their demands down our throats. They want to take the prayer out of our schools. They want to medicate our boys and make them act like girls and, yes..." He paused as if speaking from the heart. "They want to weaken America by sending our boys to die abroad, by ripping apart the fabric of our communities."\n\nHe gripped the lectern tight and allowed his smile to drop.\n\n"How much longer is the president going to force us to fight in a rinky-dink place like Haiti, a place that most of our children couldn't even find on a map? I say, stop tying our boys hands behind their backs and let them do what it takes to win or bring them home. And while we do that, we tell them to stop bussing in people who don't belong." He had to shout this next line to be heard over the crowd. "I was there, on the front lines just last week, when I told the governor that we don't want any more refugees in our communities!

Carrey stated, turned around, and tried his damnedest to make it seem as though he wasn't terrified he was about to be shot to death by his own troops. Stepping into Cpt. Langsdon's tent, he took off his hat and met eyes with the exhausted base commander.\n\n"Captain Langs-"\n\n"I know, Carrey. I know." the Captain said, sat defeated in his armchair. "You know what I first did when I heard about 'fragging'? I wrote it off. Shit, we all did. So what if he was with those CHIO psychos? Then the next one I saw was one of our Privates opening fire on his officer." the Captain shook his head. "God. This fucking war."\n\n"Captain... what can we do?" Lt. Carrey asked woefully. Captain Langsdon let out a sigh, and thought in silence for a half-minute.\n\n"Not a fuckin' thing. Tell them we accept. MPs are on the way anyways, after the other half-dozen bases like ours'. Fucking cowards." the Captain said. Lt. Carrey nodded, though felt like his very world was melting around him. Walking back outside, the troops were as stone-faced as ever.\n\n"Private Jenson, we accept, under the condition we coordinate the protection of this base camp. Agreed?" Pvt. Jenson stared at Lt.

HIS_HAI_decision.20.desc: "It was a quiet night for Thelma Powell, the seventy-two-year-old operator on the Capitol switchboard. There was little serious business before Congress, not like there had been in '62, during the civil rights fight. She got the occasional constituent call, asking to be directed to a congressional office, but most of the people on the other side were polite, young people. She suspected that her voice, with its grandmotherly quality, helped in softening the worst callers.\n\nThere was a ring of a call coming in. She connected herself. "Hello, this is the Capitol switchboard. How may I direct your—?"\n\n"This building will blow up in 30 minutes." Said the low, hard voice on the other end. "You will get many calls like this, but this one is real. Evacuate the building immediately. This is in protest of America's involvement in Haiti." Then the line went dead.\n\nThelma sat in her chair for a moment and felt her heart beat in her chest. She gave a quick look to the clock. It was 1:02 AM.\n\nThen, she sprang into action: She called down to the Capitol Police's office and DC Metropolitan Police, explaining the situation as quickly as she could in a quick, brisk voice. Then she called each office where she knew staff tended to stay late—the Architect's Office,  the custodial offices, and the mailroom—informing them to evacuate. It was 1:22 AM when she finished. Outside her door, an alarm blared.\n\nShe grabbed her purse and a photo of her husband from her desk. She scurried through the Capitol's marble hallways, past the entrance to the Senate barbershop and dining rooms.

With Loulouse serving as a nurse in a local hospital and Lean-Claude helping manage his father's restaurant, the upwardly mobile couple had thought themselves insulated from the violence consuming their home country. Then, Jean-Claude's father had gotten gunned down in the dead of night by a member of the Red Army and Loulouse had gotten pregnant.\n\nAt first, they tried to go through appropriate channels. Loulouse and Jean-Claude had presented themselves to the US embassy asking for asylum because of the threats against their lives. But, as it turned out, there were hundreds of couples like them, almost all of them successful middle class people terrified of the direction their country was heading. When, after a long day of waiting, they finally got to talk to a consular officer, they had been given a series of contradictory forms to complete. Jean-Claude had hired a fancy lawyer who had spent days preparing it, only for their application to receive no response at all.\n\nAs the life in Loulouse's belly grew, the two decided to adopt more unsavory methods. They could apply for a tourist visa to the States and then try to vanish, but the Americans were suspicious of pregnant women and the wait there turned out to be even longer than the wait for asylum visits. They could try smuggling, but the two found the idea of rowing to Guantanamo Bay to be too dangerous to pursue. Finally, Loulouse had gotten a break. One of the doctors at Loulouse's hospital knew a consular official at the Mexican embassy who, after a small bribe, would be willing to grant them a temporary tourist visa. From there, they would just need to rent a car and sneak across the border.\n\nThe two packed their bags with as much as they could. They tried not to think about what they were leaving behind as they locked their apartment for the last time and boarded a plane to Hermosillo. There, they converted their money and rented a car. They learned that even the most upstanding official could be encouraged to look the other way with enough money."
HIS_HAI_decision.21.a: "As they crossed the border, Loulouse felt a hard kick in her stomach."

HIS_HAI_decision.23.t: "Resettlement"
HIS_HAI_decision.23.desc: "Loulouse and Jean-Claude had fled Haiti with little more than they could carry after bribing a Mexican official to grant them a tourist visa and fleeing across the border into the United States. The first few months after that had been rough, unpleasant. They had stayed in an assortment of motels across Texas and Louisiana. Unable to speak fluently, they had been forced to beg in broken English more than once—for the kindness of gas station attendants, convenience store clerks, and passersby. The experience was humiliating for Jean-Claude who had always prided himself on his strength, independence, and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nYet, they had survived it all, winding a path across the South in a beat-up car until they arrived in Miami and found themselves before a tall statue of Toussaint L'Ouverture. In better times, they might have taken the moment to stand there in awe. Now, Loulouse took her husband's hand and, pregnant belly wobbling, took them inside the first church they could find. The priest, a kindly, Latino man who spoke Haitian Creole in a faint Spanish accent, ushered them to a hospital that specialized in discretion. Soon after, Nadine was born.\n\nAnd that was the start of their new lives. Relying on connections through the church, Loulouse and Jean-Claude had discovered that there were many people in Miami like them, good upstanding people who had fled the violence consuming their homeland both now and in the decades past. A woman whose once-wealthy father had been imprisoned by Déjoie helped them get an apartment without papers. A middle-aged man veteran got Jean-Claude a job as a construction worker, a position that seemed absurd for the spindly man who had once worked as a restaurateur. Women throughout Little Haiti brought small gifts of food for the baby and offered to look after her during the day if Loulouse wanted to get work as a maid.\n\nThey accepted all these gifts. How could they not? And when new exiles arrived in Haiti desperate and looking for guidance, they turned around and did the same. Loulouse, now pregnant with her second child, watched the children of those out looking for work while Jean-Claude, now buff and broad-chested, used his position in the union to find his compatriots new jobs."

The experience was humiliating for Jean-Claude who had always prided himself on his strength, independence, and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nThey had believed that they would make it, that God was on their side. Then, as they sat together in their motel room outside Birmingham, there had been a thumping on the door followed by the sound of a key. When it opened, they saw the front desk clerk and two men in police uniforms. They shouted something in English that sounded like "INS" and then moved swiftly into the room, pinning Jean-Claude to a wall as Loulouse screamed.\n\nThe next few weeks were a nightmare. They found themselves in the back of a truck with other frightened men and women. They found themselves in a room with several agents, who rattled through statements quickly in bad French and then looked annoyed when they didn't understand what he had asked. They found themselves forced to sign a paper and then shoved back into a car for hours. Jean-Claude shouted at the driver about how his wife was pregnant and needed a doctor as the car rocked down the road. Their complaints went unheard.\n\nWhen they were finally released, they found themselves not in a home but a camp. The men had deposited Jean-Claude and his wife in a ramshackle place surrounded by guards, a glorified holding cell until the Americans and their courts could figure out what to do with them. Instead of safety, Loulouse and Jean-Claude had found themselves in a different kind of danger."

HIS_HAI_decision.25.t: "Riot"
HIS_HAI_decision.25.desc: "Loulouse was gone and Jean-Claude was a ruin of himself.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, they had been together. He and his pregnant wife had been shuffled into this camp after fleeing from their native Haiti. The agents—which he now understood to be agents of the devil himself—had made them sign a paper in a language they did not understand in which they had confessed to illegally crossing the border. They had been fed gruel and given tattered blankets as the camp grew more and more crowded with refugees from their native Haiti and elsewhere. He had thought himself able to endure all of this, until Loulouse had gone into labor and been taken away. Days passed. He did not know whether she was alive or dead. The monsters refused to answer his questions.\n\nJean-Claude choked down a sob. He now saw the truth: The Americans had taken everything. It was their intervention that had led strangers to kill his father. It was their occupation that forced him to surrender his restaurant and his home. When he had done the only decent thing a man could expect to do, they had responded by stealing his wife and his child and locking him like a dog in a cage. It could not stand. It would not stand.\n\nWhen the guards demanded he and the other prisoners leave the recreation hall and return to their cells, he refused to move. When the officers barked at him and menacingly swung their batons, he refused to move. When the first officer struck Jeane-Claude's back, when outraged cries came out from the other gathered refugees, when anger finally overwhelmed fear and the refugees swarmed over the officers, he refused to move. He did not even move as his compatriots began to kick and scream, tearing at the officers over the abuses they and their country inflicted on them. A loud siren blared as full pandemonium consumed the camp, and more guards emerged with riot guns.\n\nWeeks later, the United States would accuse him of masterminding a riot. After a pointless trial, he was be deported."

HIS_HAI.6.desc: "When news of Haiti's suspension from the OFN crossed the Resolute Desk, President Nixon's order made his fury clear: "Get me that bastard Lavaud on the line." The State Department scrambled to open communication while Nixon stewed in his seat for hours. Visions of doom flashed in his mind: Haiti falling to Trujillo without American support, the NPP and the press hounding him daily, the pearly smiles of the Kennedys. Subconsciously, he welcomed them.\n\nMorning slouched towards afternoon. His secretary informed him Lavaud was on the phone, and Nixon pounced on the telephone like a hungry beast. "General Lavaud," he began, affecting calm, "this is President Nixon. How do you do?"\n\n"Hello, Mr. President," came a tinny voice. "I am very concerned about the recent decision to suspend Haitian membership in the OFN."\n\n"Well, uh, I'm sure you understand that we're all a little curious about how things went. We're all just wondering what you plan to do now that you've taken power, uh, in a manner that some find concerning. Deeply concerning."\n\n"Please understand, Mr. President, that I—.-" Nixon missed the next few words as he moved the receiver away to mutter "goddamn bastard" before returning to "—ensure that we root out the corruption that weakens our nation."\n\n"Even so, you know, there are some very, uh, very fine fellows among that old guard. If you'd consider keeping some of them in power, and letting the world know that this junta of yours isn't here to stay, I'm sure that the OFN might be willing to reconsider the, uh, their position."\n\n"Mr. President, I cannot.

HIS_HAI.20.desc: "TOP SECRET/[?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]\nFROM: GERARD DAVIS JR.\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\n\nSUBJECT: DOMINICAN BUILDUP ON HAITIAN BORDER\n\n1. A large formation of armed forces from the Dominican Republic have been spotted on the border with Haiti. This force numbers in the tens of thousands, and is capable of launching an offensive into Haiti with combined arms support. This points to Dictator Rafael Trujillo preparing for an offensive war sometime in the future.\n\n2. Overflights by BIGEYE on X/XX and X/XX brought to our attention a large buildup of Dominican forces in the disputed Hinche region between the two countries. Especially concerning was the construction of many military installations and supply hubs seemingly meant to support offensive operations. SAD reconnaissance missions have confirmed a large number of units have assembled in the area, and many are not in a defensive posture as one would expect normally.\n\n3. This force has not seemed to expand recently, and informants within the government do not expect an imminent invasion. This may mean Trujillo is anticipating a time when his forces could overwhelm Haiti with little to no resistance. However, it is more likely Trujillo has assembled this force in preparation for a time in the future when America is unable to defend Haiti. Many analysts expect the Haitians to last less than a week against the Dominicans if this happens.\n\n4. It is imperative America does not allow Trujillo to think he can strike Haiti with impunity at any time. Our policy in the region should maintain this posture of firm commitment to dissuade any attack. In the meantime the FBI will continue to monitor this deployment for any changes in force levels or structure."

Dominican forces that have been built up on the border with Haiti have been withdrawn. Large numbers of troops, including many armored components, are being moved out of the Hinche area and redeployed across the country. It is highly likely any imminent invasion with Haiti has been canceled.\n\n2. BIGEYE overflights have seen a number of vehicles on trains moving away from the area, and road convoys in the Cordillera Septentrional mountain range. Comparison with previous images have shown a marked reduction in stored supplies and vehicles at various depots in the area, and what units remain seem to be ones kept as a reaction force for a Haitian incursion.\n\n3. On the ground sources have noted a large deployment of troops across the country, consistent with a redeployment of the military from Hinche. Many sources believe the demilitarization is directly linked with the recent death of longtime Dictator Rafael Trujillo. Whether this is to restore order or a genuine effort to deescalate the Hinche issue is unknown at this time. However what can be concluded is an invasion of Haiti is no longer a short term goal for the new government."

HIS_HAI_ugly.1.t: "The Ugly American"
HIS_HAI_ugly.1.desc: ""Employment Opportunities Abroad! Support America Today!" read the handsome signs plastered all over the District of Columbia. The brilliant red letters had been posted on bulletin boards in government offices, university halls, and boarding houses. They made it clear that there was a shortage of trained people to work abroad; that the positions would pay well and take them to see exciting locales around the world; and that they would be doing good and patriotic work to spread freedom abroad.\n\nIt was this last promise that attracted the Ugly American—a name he had long called himself for his rough clothes and dirty hands—to approach the Department of State. He'd attended grand informational sessions hosted by envoys in pristine, arrow-collared shirts and attended night classes with well-groomed men. Between rough work shifts as an engineer, he studied for the foreign service exam in hopes of joining those princes of bureaucracy, of proving himself worthy of advancing causes as high-minded as liberty and equality. He'd taken the test once before and, having heard nothing, was preparing to take it again.\n\nIt was this that he busied himself with as he opened his mailbox after a long day of work. The Ugly American rubbed his oily hands on his pants so as not to stain the building's mailboxes—his super worked so hard to keep them clean—and flipped through the contents. There were bills, restaurant menus, an ad about Richard Nixon. Then, buried at the bottom of the pile, a thick envelope embossed with the Great Seal of the United States. He opened it roughly.\n\n"Congratulations! The scores you received on your Foreign Service Exam qualify you for immediate placement as a political officer in our embassy in Port-au-Prince. To accept this position...""

HIS_HAI_ugly.2.t: "Ugly Work"
HIS_HAI_ugly.2.desc: "The Ugly American's education before his deployment had been brief. There had been no attempt to get him acquainted with the local language, nor the situation on the ground in Haiti. To the contrary, most of his time in the Department of State's headquarters had been focused on so-called "security briefs"—on ways to protect himself and avoid spies. His best education had, instead, come from trips to the library and congressional reports.\n\nWhich is why he now found himself, implausibly, arguing with a group of soldiers in a village along the Haitian coast. "Now, gentlemen, I'm going to say this once more," he said in a voice that he hoped concealed his frustration. "State asked me to come out here to help build roads and give these people jobs. I've talked to a thousand people about this, gotten the sign-off from local leaders. It's essential to get services running here."\n\nThe leader of the platoon looked at the Ugly Americans disheveled khakis and gave a snide, aristocratic expression. "I'm more worried about my boys being killed in the night than I am about these poor bastards getting roadwork. As I've said before, you can have your project, but only with US-approved contractors and the presence of US troops. Only way to prevent sabotage."\n\nHe resisted throwing his arms out in an expression of frustration. "But you see how that defeats the whole purpose, don't you? It's bad enough to have soldiers putting their guns in people's faces, but there's no jobs, no local ownership of the project if we're getting a bunch of foreign contractors."\n\nBut the man before him was unsympathetic. "Look, I don't know what to tell you. If you want to complain about us protecting American lives, I would encourage you to run it up the chain of command. In the meanwhile..." He pointed to the village. "I'm treating every one of these people as a potential threat.""
HIS_HAI_ugly.2.a: "The Ugly American stood outraged as the soldiers went to patrol the dirt streets, leaving construction equipment fluttering in the breeze."

HIS_HAI_ugly.3.t: "Ugly People"
HIS_HAI_ugly.3.desc: "The Ugly American was aware that he was the only man not wearing a tie. Having just returned from some villages to deliver construction equipment, he found himself in the mansion of the Haitian foreign minister in rough, dirt-flecked khakis surrounded by fashionably dressed men. Were it not for the soldiers standing near the window as guests laughed and drank, one would not be able to tell they were in the middle of a war zone.\n\n"My, my, aren't you a mess," said a voice. He turned to see an older man in a fine suit sip a martini and flash a small grin. "I do hope wages in the foreign service haven't gotten so bad that men can't afford suits anymore."\n\n"I'm looking for the deputy chief of mission, have you...?"\n\n"Oh, probably smoking some reefers, having a good time. A few of your State Department friends took some women upstairs a while ago if you want to check the bedrooms."\n\nThe American opened his mouth but at that moment there was a loud cheer as a man in military dress uniform opened a bottle of champagne with a saber. White foam slopped out onto the carpet.\n\nThe man studied it quizzically. "You ever think about how hard the people of these places have to work to keep us entertained? The best parties. The best drinks. The best girls. I was in Iraq right before the coup and it was the same thing, except for the Italians." He seemed lost in his thoughts. "I suppose if they stopped having these things then there would be no reason to be here. Just another shithole on the map."\n\nThe Ugly American could no longer hide his disgust. He shook his head and walked away without another word."

HIS_HAI_ugly.4.t: "An Ugly Reminder"
HIS_HAI_ugly.4.desc: ""Everything okay?"\n\nThe Ugly American blinked and found himself sitting in a small restaurant in the Tabarre commune of Port-au-Prince. Around him was the quiet chatting of other tables; a mix of middle-class locals and foreign soldiers and diplomats enjoying the night air. A band played near the street. Across from him sat Marie, a drab woman of twenty-eight who worked as one of the embassy's many secretaries. He supposed this evening together counted as a date.\n\nThe Ugly American gave a solemn smile. "Oh, I'm just a little exhausted. Learning that the business of diplomacy is less hands-on and more ego-driven than I imagined."\n\n"Well, such is life," she said in a dull voice. "It's the way that things have always been. No sense in getting worked up over it."\n\nHe frowned, but before he could say anything, there came the sounds of breaking glass, a shout, and a chair clattering. The American turned to see a waiter crouched over the shattered remains of several glasses as a soldier, clearly drunk, rose. "You fucking stupid..." Began the white man as he stumbled to his feet. The waiter offered a quiet apology, which went unheard, as the other man drew back his leg and kicked the waiter in his chest. He fell backwards in pain. Then the soldier spat out an ugly word.\n\n"That's enough!" said the Ugly American, rising from the table. He walked forward. "You have no right to treat this man, or any other Haitian this way. We came here to give these people freedom. Every act of violence dishonors the uniform—."\n\nHe did not get out the rest of the words as the man's fist connected with his face. There was shocked silence as he toppled into a nearby table and onto the floor. The taste of blood filled his mouth. He caught a glance of Marie at the table, looking away, as the drunk man stepped toward him and leaned down."
HIS_HAI_ugly.4.a: ""I'll do whatever the fuck I want," he spat, "Then the feds are going to clean it up. Don't forget that.""

HIS_HAI_ugly.5.t: "Ugly Requests"
HIS_HAI_ugly.5.desc: "It would be one thing if the injury was superficial, a matter of appearance, but the Ugly American's jaw was still tender from his ill-fated date with Marie. Every time he opened his mouth, a sharp feeling of pain shot through him. Worse, it made it difficult for him to talk at a time when he needed his mouth more than ever. The Department had announced it would be surveying the country's entire population to better distribute aid and "reduce fraud." Any villages that were not fully surveyed risked losing access to food, money, and material. And with so many of his colleagues hiding away in the embassy to avoid security threats, he'd forced himself to work, alone, through the pain.\n\n"Bonjour, monsieur," said the Ugly American. Between his injury-induced lisp and broken French, he felt like a child. "Je suis un americain avec... le gouvernement. Je voudrais... demander quelques questions à ta famille."\n\nThe young man in front of him gave a look of either boredom or contempt. The Ugly American tried to repeat. "Je voudrais..."\n\nThe Haitian looked around the quiet dirt road. As other villagers went about their duties, a few GIs leaned against their Jeep and chatted. He looked at the empty house behind him.\n\n"Yes, American. I will answer questions. With family. Come," said the man, gesturing toward the building.\n\nThe Ugly American paused. He wasn't supposed to go alone into buildings alone like this, but his experiences thus far had been peaceful. He'd encountered some hostility—the usual, anti-American rallies and slogans—but nothing on the level that his security briefing had warned, nor—rubbing his jaw—anything he couldn't on some level understand."
HIS_HAI_ugly.5.a: "The young man gestured to him in the doorway. With a sigh, the Ugly American followed."

Instead of being greeted by the man, by a small family, The Ugly American felt something cold, metal, and sharp press against the exposed flesh near his neck.\n\n"Do not scream," said the man.\n\nThe Ugly American raised his dirty hands in surrender, census forms still gripped in his palm. He caught the gleam of a knife inside the dark room as the man moved to check the Ugly American's pockets, removing his wallet and leafing through it.\n\n"Please," said the Ugly American in a quiet voice. The man removed a wad of cash from his wallet. "I'm unarmed. I'm only here for a survey. I'm only here to help."\n\nThe man discarded the emptied wallet. "Help? You butcher us, treat us like dogs, and you call it help?" He spat onto the floor. The knife wavered. "We still talk of the Gendarmerie, of the prostitutes and gangsters you forced on us. Even now, your banks and companies come to pillage. Is that not true?\n\n"I'm not... I don't..."\n\n"You don't know." The man repeated it flatly. He lowered his knife and stared at the American with an expression of unadulterated loathing. "You come here, expecting to be the hero, and you do not know your own his—."\n\nHe did not get any further. The Ugly American chucked his collection of survey forms at the Haitian. Paperwork scattered across the room like confetti. The man stepped back in surprise as the Ugly American turned, sprinting from the building and screaming as loud as his damaged jaw would allow him."

HIS_HAI_ugly.7.t: "Ugly Thoughts"
HIS_HAI_ugly.7.desc: "It had been several days since the incident in the village and—with violence escalating and the Ugly American still waking from nightmares about the cold blade against his flesh—his superiors had decided that he and his colleagues should avoid field work for the time being. Instead, the State Department would revert to playing a "vital support role" for a "new phase in America's engagement with its Haitian partners." In practice, this meant playing the bag man for the US military.\n\n"Welcome to Port-au-Prince, gentlemen," shouted the Ugly American over the rain and whipping wind. He was standing near the tarmac at Port-au-Prince International Airport, struggling to keep hold of the umbrella in his slick hands, while transport aircrafts landed one after the other. Pouring from them came young boys, some of them looking too young for their uniforms.\n\nA man in a soaked uniform shook the Ugly American's hand. "I wish I could say it was a pleasure." He yelled, before flashing a smile. "Let's hope this weather isn't a bad omen."\n\nThe Ugly American smiled to pretend he found the joke amusing. "Once you're settled, the Ambassador has requested to see you at his residence to discuss the current challenges. He imagines..."\n\nIt went on. The Ugly American could feel his mouth moving as he spat out bureaucratic platitudes about the "security situation" and "on-the-ground assessments." Inside, though, he felt dismal. This was not what he had seen himself doing when he first arrived. He did not imagine himself as an agent of empire, greeting young boys and leading them to their deaths. He had come here with the stupid, child-like hope of making a difference.\n\nThe Ugly American and the officer walked to a car. He then opened the door for the man and gestured to him to go inside. They talked politely on their way to the embassy."

Miniature cars zipped along roads that turned from asphalt to dirt. Then he was looking over barren hills, small towns splattered across them.\n\n"You see that?" Shouted his companion, pointing somewhere near the horizon. "We've gotten word that some of Fred Batiste's red army are hiding out there." The chopper rattled. The man directed his attention downward, toward a unit of American and Haitian soldiers. They looked like toy soldiers against the green. "This'll be a good mission for them to test our coordination."\n\nThe Ugly American nodded as if he understood any of this. He gripped the passenger handle tight. He would be happier when this ordeal was over and he could report back to the deputy chief of mission that the security situation had improved enough that they could do field work again.\n\n"They'll be making contact. You'll wanna to watch closely."\n\nThe Ugly American forced himself to stare down at the unit of Americans and Haitians. They got within a few yards of the village and then cracks rang out across the hillside. The smile fell from his companion's face. "Jesus fucking Christ."\n\nBelow them, the men collapsed. Mists of red could be seen as, one by one, they fell to some unseen enemy. Several men fired into empty space before collapsing into the dirt. He watched, powerless, as one boy, a pale thing, threw down his rifle and attempted a retreat before his skull shattered. Then, there came the sounds of rounds hitting the bottom of their helicopter.\n\n"Fuck. Abort! Abort! Get us the fuck out of here!""

After several disastrous events, including his own ill-fated helicopter ride, he now saw it as a prison. Staff had long-since ceased to interact with anyone in the host country and instead walked the same few halls over and over again. He had started seeing Marie again, not because of some great feeling of love, but to ward off boredom and apathy and find an excuse to get away from his desk.\n\n"Sir," came a voice from nearby. "I have a summary of those DoD operation reports you asked for."\n\nHe stirred from his thoughts and looked up to see... Carter? Chester? All the names had started to blur together in his brain. All the Ugly American knew was that the man had arrived two weeks ago, was visibly a decade younger than anyone else, and was the son or nephew of a sitting member of Congress. He'd been put in charge of "onboarding" the kid which, in this case, meant asking him to evaluate how the new military-oriented "engagement" was going so that he, in turn, could write a diplomatic cable back to Washington.\n\nThe Ugly American forced himself to give a smile of thanks. Then he opened the small packet of papers to... He could feel his face blanche. Hidden beneath the most bureaucratic legalese were reports of atrocities. There was no escaping it. American advisors had "eliminated targets." Entire villages had been "relocated" to address "active threats to personnel." There were regular "incidents" of violence, not enacted by a handful of crazed, irrational soldiers, but enabled by a system acting to eradicate an insurgency. His hands, rendered clean from a lack of hard labor, gripped the papers tight.\n\n"Sir," said the boy prince, seeming far away, "are you alright?""
HIS_HAI_ugly.9.a: ""Just...leave me. I need a moment before I take care of this.""

It was late at night and the Ugly American was sitting, staring at the half-written letter in the typewriter on his desk.\n\n"Mr. Ambassador, I am enclosing a copy of my letter of resignation from my position in the Department of State. Over the past few weeks, I have lost confidence in the integrity of our work here and the ability of the United States to affect positive change for the Haitian people. I hope that by resigning—."\n\nThe letter cut off there. It was what he had been struggling with for the past hour. What did he hope to accomplish? Did he think Department leadership would take his actions as a brave stand against injustice? (No.) Did he hope to rally his colleagues to demand something better? (No.) Did he think he would be saving anyone but himself from the violence that was, even now, being inflicted in the streets in the name of liberty and justice? (No.)\n\nHe buried his head in his hands. The only thing his resignation would achieve would be to let the Department fill his post with someone new. Maybe that person would be better than he was, stronger and more clever and more able to stand up against clear wrong-doing. More likely than not, though, they would bring in another prince of bureaucracy, a person who wore fine shirts and had clean hands because he had never worked a day in his life.

HIS_HAI_ugly.12.desc: "Why had he, among all of his colleagues, been selected to travel to Washington to receive a certificate of merit? What had he accomplished at all in his time in Haiti that others had not? Had the Ambassador recommended him to get him out of the country and out of his hair? Had some hapless staffer in Foggy Bottom read his cables? Was it merely because he looked like the picture of an American Boy Scout and his picture would be useful for campaign ads?\n\nThe Ugly American didn't know. All he was aware of was that he and a spattering of other verifiable princes of bureaucracy had been lined up against the wall of the White House's East Room. He wore a fine suit and pristine, arrow-collared shirt while press cameras flashed and the president spoke about hard work and decency and the triumph of the American spirit. There was a moment—after explaining the achievements of the other awardees—when the president said his name. The president praised him as a paragon of a foreign service officer, where he lauded his work advancing the cause of liberty and empowering the Haitian people.\n\nHe didn't care.\n\n"Good job, son," said President [USA.GetPresidentLastName] as he went down the line. He squeezed his shoulder and pressed a certificate into his hand. "You've got a bright future."\n\nThen it was over. The president exited and the press put away their cameras. Several staffers escorted him out of the building. He would go to a party and a hotel and have meaningless conversations that had nothing to do with the violence that was, even now, being inflicted by the United States all over the world. They would laugh and chuckle and sing happy songs, ignoring the mountain of bones on which American power all stood."

Word had come down from the Department of State that the Haitian embassy was "downsizing" its operations and would be "re-evaluating priorities across the region." He and others had received notices that their positions at the embassy had been terminated and they would be reassigned to a different posting as soon as a position opened.\n\nThe Ugly American kept his face stiff as he walked the embassy compound's emptied corridors, making sure to avoid the desk where Marie and the other secretaries worked. He filled boxes full of documents to be destroyed—Chester's report on US atrocities, his crumpled, half-completed resignation letter, scattered survey forms, and the prescription for painkillers he'd received for his jaw. He did not react as the boxes containing the legacy of his time in Haiti were loaded into an incinerator and destroyed.\n\nIt was better this way, he thought. What little he had achieved was unlikely to survive the rapid withdrawal of the US military. It was unlikely that the angry throngs outside, waving Haitian flags and chanting anti-American slogans, would view any record of his time here favorably.\n\nNot that he thought there was anything people should celebrate.\n\nWhen all traces of himself had all been destroyed, the Ugly American went to the roof of the embassy and boarded one of the last helicopters out of Port-au-Prince. As it took off, he kept his gaze affixed on the horizon so as not to catch sight of the people he had failed."

They were loading people into armored convoys while the crowds outside the embassy walls grew more and more panicked. Haiti was falling. The government had fled. All that remained now were the staff of the American embassy and the remnants of the US military, reduced to defending Port-au-Prince International Airport.\n\nThe Ugly American had just finished loading Chester's report on atrocities into a burn bag when a man in fatigues opened the door to one of the embassy's back storage room. His face looked wild, panicked. "We have to go now."\n\nHe entered the garage in time to see Marie vanish into the back of a truck, a terrified look on her face. Then felt himself being hurried along to the truck behind her. He had a second to shut the door before it shot out onto the crowded streets, through yelling, terrified people begging for escape, for refuge. The Ugly American watched as a young man threw himself onto the side of his vehicle, only to be thrown off as it turned a corner. Once lively shops were sealed and barren as their owners hid from the PPLN. A long banner displaying the face of the now-vanished Haitian president fluttered in the breeze.\n\nHis driver turned back to look at him. "We shouldn't be much further now. Once you see the airport terminal, get your ass in gear to—."\n\nHe did not hear the rest. There was a series of loud thunks, followed by the sound of breaking glass, as bullets exploded through the front window. The man slumped forward in his seat over the steering wheel. The Ugly American was aware of the car drifting, of it accelerating at an alarming speed, of a group of men carrying a red flag near the end of the road. He had no time to think as he unbuckled himself from the back seat, threw the trunk door open, and lept from it."

HIS_HAI_ugly.15.desc: "He awoke surrounded by unkempt grass that fluttered gently in the breeze. The sky overhead was cloudless, its violent blue bisected by the vapor trails of a plane high overhead. The Ugly American allowed himself to remain still as he did an inventory of his individual body parts. He could flex his toes, his right arm. There was a sharp, cold pain emanating from the space above his elbow. He forced himself to turn his head toward it and saw that something had ruptured through the sleeve of his grass-stained and bloody dress shirt. Protruding from the skin was his pale—.\n\nHe sat up as vomit forced its way up his throat and burned his lips. He heaved again. He stared at the road and of the ruin of a truck, his truck, which now lay on its side. Pieces of paper fluttered in the shattered windows. A small group of men with rifles were rifling through the ruin, too concerned with searching it to notice him.\n\nHe wobbled to his feet.\n\nHe waited a moment to see if he would be spotted.\n\nThen he began to stumble away, back toward the city.\n\nHow long it took, he couldn't say. Time folded into itself. For the first time since he had arrived in Port-au-Prince all those years ago, though, the streets were strangely quiet and empty. There was no more music, no more celebrations. No other foreigners walked the streets. All those things that he and his colleagues had supported were gone.\n\nWhen he could walk no longer, he found himself standing before an enormous, dilapidated billboard. It displayed an American flag and the faces of many smiling people. Written on it, in English and Creole, was a simple phrase in handsome lettering."

He had filed his cables and his paperwork as security forces struggled to combat the Haitian red army, the forces of Fred Baptiste. There had been struggles, challenges, as Washington grew alarmed at the developments emerging from Haiti and then gave up. A solution to the crisis had been found, but not one Washington desired and not one that addressed underlying insecurities or the actions Americans had taken across the island.\n\nA soft hand pressed against his shoulder. A set of lips pecked him on the cheek. "You alright, darling? You have that face again."\n\nThe Ugly American turned from the television in his DC apartment to his girlfriend. He reached up his rough hand and caressed her cheek as the president intoned about America's commitment to its Caribbean allies and its continued support to Haiti as the country. "Yes, Mary-Beth, I'm alright. Just thinking about the next deployment."\n\nShe kissed him again and left to finish cooking in the kitchen. He returned his attention to the screen. President [USA.GetPresidentLastName] stood in the Rose Garden, their body shimmering in the midday sun. "In our time in Haiti, we never once sacrificed our principles for expediency, never once forgot what we were there for. We sought to prove that America can be a force for good in the world and promote justice wherever it goes.

He made sure to keep his face flat and unemotive as he did so, to be the picture of American professionalism. He took out a pen to take notes.\n\n"With the victory of Republican forces in Haiti, what we see is a renewed commitment to our founding principles," said the president through static. "We see that America is a force for good, a force for justice. With minimal investment, we were able to shepherd our Haitian allies into the family of democracies and guarantee the human rights and livelihoods of millions..."\n\n"Hey! Hey!" shouted The Ugly American's colleague in sudden alarm. "Your pen!

The Dominicans could not be trusted to keep their word, much less a vital piece of rightful Haitian territory in the Hinche, a foothold into sovereign and immutable Haitian territory; so help them God, they would have Hinche or Hispaniola would know no peace.\n\nThe Dominican representative played the role of the bewildered, deflecting adult - blaming the Haitians for escalating a dispute that could be solved between the two of them alone, when it was clear that the Dominican government had shown no interest in resolving the matter for decades. Haiti, to them, was blowing things well out of proportion - a statement that neatly sidestepped any question of Hinche's rightful owner.\n\nThey would not be able to resolve the issue by themselves - nor would they need to, if America was willing to make the choice for them.

If letting the Haitians vent was the cost of staying this course, then the Americans - and obviously, the Dominicans - were prepared to pay it.\n\n"We brought this dispute to you in good faith, confident in the righteous, historical facts of our cause.

The Haitians, for their part, were close to throwing up their hands and storming out - arguing that they hadn't expected anything more from the Dominicans, but at least the Americans now knew what the had known for years.\n\nThe State Department diplomats called for another break. With the talks on the verge of breaking down, and having already weighed in on the Haitian side, a few argued that salvaging the talks would require some kind of inducement to the Dominicans - an offer of development assistance, far more generous than any package previously offered, with individual 'packages' for key leaders. It would be a win-win package of the most expensive kind, but it would hopefully work.\n\nOnly for some new dispute or grievance to spring up and start the process again, others argued.

To offset this privilege, they make efforts to cooperate with fellow revolutionaries and accommodate their interests in the wider project.

HAC_Army_of_Insurgents_desc: "Like every great socialist uprising throughout history, the PPLN's revolutionary army has begun as a ragtag alliance of militia conscripts and defectors from the Haitian Armed Forces. Rather than a single army spread across the country, it is composed of several regional armies that take orders from the Central Committee, allowing a degree of flexibility.\n\nHowever, the new revolutionary army is not without growing pains - due to suboptimal communication and poor organization of supply lines, coordination is difficult, with many independent squads of guerrillas - such as the one headed by the infamous Fred Baptiste - acting directly outside of the chain of command. Nonetheless, time and experience will doubtlessly remedy these issues, if the Central Committee has anything to say about it."

# Leader descs
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TRUJILLO_DESC: "With the Caudillismo of the 20s bringing the country to its knees, Rafael Trujillo would usher in a new age with his coup in 1930, 'la Era de Trujillo'. Bringing political stability and economic prosperity, casting off the influence of the Americans from the Republic and bringing it closer with Iberia and Italy, true allies of the state and its people, the new regime would become widely popular with the people, with Trujillo being seen by many as El Benefactor.\n\nHowever, all this stability and prosperity would be built on top of the bodies of the ones who opposed the tyrannical and brutal regime of Trujillo. Be from within, those who opposed the dictator and found themselves sent to prisions to be tortured to death, or from without, the Haitians that were unlucky enough to to be born in the regions claimed by Trujillo, either killed or forced to flee their homes in the fear of it.\n\nFor decades the Secret Police and Army were able to keep these enemies of the Republic at bay, however, with the fall of Batista in Cuba the safety of the regime would be called into question as the rebellion against him had come with US support. With fears that he will be next, Trujillo has continuously built up his military and security apparatus with Iberian and Italian help, turning the Dominican Republic into a fortress for Fascism, all the while backing anti-American movements wherever possible. With everyone knowing that action against him is a guarantee, the only question remaining is if the regime will be able to survive."
POLITICS_RAMFIS_TRUJILLO_DESC: "Growing up the son of the man who built the modern Dominican State, many expected great things from Rafael Leónidas 'Ramfis' Trujillo. It's not like his father wasn't aware of this either, giving him military promotions and bridges in his name at an extraordinarily young age. He was long considered the heir apparent, and many expected him to take the political acumen of his father.\n\nOf course, Ramfis turned out to fall far from the tree. He never showed interest in politics, or not nearly as much as he had for young women and auto racing. His failure to graduate the Academia General Militar due to his focus on extravagant affairs with movie actresses was a source of embarrassment to the regime. And a scandalous divorce from his first wife led to him falling out of the public eye for quite a while, though it never dampened his bohemian lifestyle. When they hear his name, many Dominicans think of him with a dark haired starlet in a fancy automobile instead of at his father's side in a uniform, and they laugh.\n\nBut Ramfis heard these laughs. And if there's anything he's inherited from his father, it's his insecurity. He knows they're wrong, that he can be a great leader like his father was. And anyone who doubts him will be proven wrong... or dealt with."
POLITICS_RAMFIS_TRUJILLO_PUPPET_DESC: "Growing up the son of the man who built the modern Dominican State, many expected great things from Rafael Leónidas "Ramfis" Trujillo. It's not like his father wasn't aware of this either, giving him military promotions and bridges in his name at an extraordinarily young age. He was long considered the heir apparent, and many expected him to take the political acumen of his father.\n\nOf course, Ramfis turned out to fall far from the tree. He never showed interest in politics, or not nearly as much as he had for young women and luxury auto racing. So when it came time for him to take the reins, he was offered a deal he could not refuse from the Military Intelligence Service. Ramfis could have as many luxury cars, movie stars, and benders as he wanted. And if he needed to slit a throat, he only had to name it. But the real power is Chief Johnny Abbes García.\n\nAbbes is rumored to be another product of nepotism, to have traded affairs as a young man with the former President to advance his career. But while the power behind the throne is corrupt, he was always loyal to Trujillo, and wants nothing more than to advance the will of the departed ruler. So Ramfis can live happily the way he always wanted, the burden of power on Abbes, his agents, and the German handlers behind them all."
POLITICS_JOAQUIN_BALAGUER_DESC: "If someone told Joaquín Balaguer's family and neighbours in the poor ruralities of Santiago de los Caballeros that he would rise to the Presidency of the Dominican Republic after years of quiet struggle and effort, they would laugh in their interlocutor's face. But that is how it has played out.\n\nAmerican occupation and the rhetoric of his father's friend, the leader of the Puerto Rican liberation struggle Pedro Albizu Campos, sparked in the young Balaguer a love for intellectual debate and its frequent companion of politics. That, combined with training in essay writing and law, made him the perfect candidate for public prosecutor. Balaguer would've been content to do that for a while had an opportunity not struck—for not long after Balaguer's tenure began, his cousin married the future ruler of the Dominican Republic, Rafael Leónidas Trujillo.\n\nThings began well. Balaguer was Trujillo's most important minister, his closest confidant. He kept a low profile, and said nothing about Trujillo's aberrations and excesses. But this happy equilibrium went to hell quickly as Trujillo himself became a liability and a threat to the country he had built. So Balaguer had no choice but to preserve his old friend's work—by orchestrating his assassination.\n\nLet there be no mistake: the rise of Balaguer is the transition of the Dominican Republic towards a safer, more moderate paradigm. Yet not all is well, and the new President knows to watch himself; as he often says, for every grateful civilian these days there seem to be at least just as many crypto-communists who can't be satisfied with what they've gotten. They cannot be allowed to destroy all that Balaguer has worked for. Absolutely not."

Balaguer was Trujillo's most important minister, his closest confidant. He kept a low profile, and said nothing about Trujillo's aberrations and excesses. But this happy equilibrium went to hell quickly as Trujillo himself became a liability and a threat to the country he had built. Balaguer bided his time until the man he once called friend suffered death, and only then took power. His mission: destroy the legacy of Trujillo's worst abuses.\n\nTo achieve that mission, Balaguer has had to ally with the dissidents and anti-governmental opposition forces. He gave them a promise—that he would bring back democracy to Quisqueya. But the cards are in his hands now. Will he deliver on his vow fully, or limit what he does? 'Suum est'—it is up to him."
POLITICS_GOBIERNO_RECONSTRUCCION_NACIONAL_DESC: "The deed is done! God is in Heaven and Trujillo is (at least) six feet under; the Tyrant's associated hangers-on are with him down there or else behind bars. But getting revolutionaries to agree on killing Trujillo was the easy part. The hard part, that of defining the Dominican Republic's future, is only beginning.\n\nIn theory, the government is clearly delineated. The Provisional President of the Dominican Republic is the old revolutionary Horacio Ornes, and he presides over the reconstruction of the post-Trujillo state. All law-decrees and orders are signed by him at the request of the Government of National Reconstruction.\n\nHowever, in reality Ornes' authority is not so clear-cut: the Government of National Reconstruction rules by consensus of its disparate members. But the Dominican revolutionaries and their Caribbean Legion allies have a thousand contradicting worldviews and ideologies and so that "consensus" has been collapsing from the very moment Trujillo was thrown into his unmarked grave.\n\nThe top priority of the Ornes presidency is to stabilize Quisqueya's politics enough to be able to hold elections in peace. But the more one observes that presidency in its deliberations, the less certainty one has that that will be an easy, smoothly executed task."
POLITICS_OFN_OAS_DOM_DESC: "§YWHEREAS§! the debauched and megalomaniacal ambitions of the so-called Generalissimo Rafael Leonidas Trujillo were in fact the undoing of his entire regime, a source of misery for the ordinary people, and the cause of the current regrettable military presence in our nation;\n\n§YWHEREAS§! forces of the Organization of Free Nations and the Organization of American States have graciously been placed at the disposal of the people of the Dominican Republic, so as to ensure safety and the present stable situation in the zone where they are providing guidance and support; and\n\n§YWHEREAS§! the Dominican people require the continuation of governance and preservation of national rule for as long as OFN and OAS forces remain present and assisting; now, therefore, be it\n\n§mRESOLVED§! that a Governance Council of the Dominican Republic be formed;\n\n§mRESOLVED§! that the composition of this Council be of those officials and military officers who, neither succumbing to anarchism nor adhering to Rafael Trujillo's abominable ways, internally opposed the previous regime in a manner that redounded to Dominican welfare; and\n\n§mRESOLVED§! that the Governance Council shall cooperate with the OFN-OAS transitional authorities for as long as their presence may be required in the Dominican Republic."
POLITICS_JOSE_RENE_ROMAN_DESC: "Pupo Román was destined for an otherwise unremarkable career in the Dominican Army. The Benefactor, defying cruel fate with all his divine majesty, saved him from this irrelevancy by advancing his career to make him Secretary of the Armed Forces, the regime's number two man. Pupo's marriage to one of his nieces was no coincidence. Awarded a life of privilege at the behest of Trujillo's nepotism - most enviable under the brutal dictatorship - even he could not escape El Jefe's constant abuse through disturbing tests of loyalty.\n\nResentment brewed in his heart with each affront to his manhood. To see his master lead the nation further into depravity through collaboration with the German fascists was the final straw. Approached by the conspirators and their international backers, he was eager to seek revenge on the man who held him in thrall, but this spell was not fully broken until he saw the Goat's lifeless body in the flesh. Leading his men against the brutal secret police, the SIM, he has restored order as the head of a joint civil-military government. As the remnants of the old regime - men he once called comrades - are systematically hunted down, negotiations are underway with the Caribbean Legion to restore peace and unity to the Dominican Republic after a thirty year lapse."

# Ideas
DOM_Dios_Trujillo: "Dios y Trujillo"
DOM_Dios_Trujillo_desc: "The popularity of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina cannot be understated. To those old enough to remember the poverty and chaos of the 1920s, he is the savior of the nation. To those who are younger, he is the protector of the Dominicans from American imperialism and Haitian barbarism. While there are plenty who see him as nothing more than a brute, the motto of 'Dios y Trujillo' is plastered across the nation, often below his portrait. To many Dominicans, God and Trujillo are one and the same."
DOM_Dios_Trujillo_Ramfis: "Dios y Trujillo"
DOM_Dios_Trujillo_Ramfis_desc: "The notoriety of Rafael 'Ramfis' Trujillo cannot be understated. A hedonist and a dilettante; the Dominican Republic is full of sordid stories of his luxurious lifestyle, supported by the brutal regime his father left him. Despite his lack of drive, he has an ambition to be seen as an equal to his father. While there are plenty who see him as nothing more than a puppet and a playboy, Ramfis seeks to change this. To many Dominicans, God and Trujillo shall once again be one and the same."

DOM_Blanqueamiento: "Blanqueamiento"
DOM_Blanqueamiento_desc: "Under Trujillo, the Dominican Republic has undertaken a particularly notable initiative, the Blanqueamiento, or 'Whitening'. Believing that Spanish White culture stands as the beacon that civilized the primitives of the region, the Dominican Republic took in Republican refugees fleeing from the Spanish Civil War despite his own ideological and political proximity to the Nationalists, and also, surprisingly, Jewish refugees fleeing the advances of the Nazis during the Second World War.\n\nThis, however, would only be the first step. After the end of the conflict, Trujillo has pursued closer ties with Franco and pushed for trade, cultural and, most importantly, emigration accords with the peninsula. While these initiatives have proven themselves successful, with Iberians moving to the island in droves, they would still not make much of a dent in the largely mulatto and black population.\n\nIn conjunction with the fundamental anti-Haitian ideology of the regime that led to the Parsley Massacre of 1937 and the Invasion of Hinche in 1948, the tensions caused by this policy have fueled the restart of a de-facto genocidal policy against Haitians, promoting discrimination and violence against the large number of Haitian blacks living in the country. This has resulted in an increasing number of pogroms and the expulsion of Haitians from border communities, artificially increasing the percentage occupied by the whites in the process."

DOM_Rising_Resistance: "Quiet Insurgence"
DOM_Rising_Resistance_desc: "To outsiders, it appears as if all of the Dominican Republic is complicit under the grasp of the Generalissimo, but there are those who would risk it all to see him gone. However, the failed Luperón Expedition in 1959 to overthrow Trujillo caused a nationwide crackdown in response, leaving opposition scattered and frightened. But, as history proves time and again, this was not enough.\n\nA general uneasiness with the regime is spreading, from the younger generations yearning for change, to the older ones who once collaborated with and benefited from the regime as stagnation and uncertainty takes hold, and the scandalous moral debauchery of the Trujillo family and their close circle becomes too much to ignore. Hushed whispers of revolution circulate in the barracks and among officers who tire of the abuses of which the regime knows no limits.\n\nAs this dissatisfaction silently spreads its roots across Dominican society, the regime attempts to conceal the growing urban insurgencies of the June 14th Revolutionary Movement, founded by the survivors of the Luperón Disaster and those Dominicans who will no longer tolerate silence."

DOM_Modernizing_Military_normal_desc: "For the past decade, the Dominican military has been undergoing rapid expansion, almost completely paid for by the lucrative exports of sugar and cocoa beans to the rather exclusive markets of Europe and Argentina, and bankrolled by the aligned interests of the Triumvirate. Isolated within the Caribbean by the hostility of its neighbors and the admission of Haiti into the OFN, it is clear that we must defend ourselves against degenerate yankee imperialist aggression from all sides."
DOM_Modernizing_Military_pupo_roman_desc: "Under Generalissimo Trujillo, the Dominican military underwent rapid expansion, nurtured by imported Triumvirate arms and vast budgets bankrolled by sugar and cocoa exports. But when the Puerto Plata landings exposed its Benefactor's failings, the military turned its shiny new weaponry on the tinpot fascist. Though lauded as liberators, its overweening size and loathing of Hispaniola's leftists could lead its generals to end Quisqueya's new era of freedom as decisively as they began it."

DOM_Widespread_Revolts: "Widespread Revolts"
DOM_Widespread_Revolts_desc: "On the outside of the Dominican Republic, there is an invasion- on the inside, an uprising. Both have the same goal- to cut off the head of Trujillo. Both battles are being fought simultaneously- both will be needed to bring down the Generalissimo. Officers assassinated, depots blown up, arms stolen- every act inches closer to what they see as impending liberation. The streets are painted red with the blood of both friend and foe; it is much safer to stay inside."

DOM_Significant_Revolts: "Significant Revolts"
DOM_Significant_Revolts_desc: "A wave of chaos has crashed into the Dominican Republic, threatening to wash away Trujillo's regime. While the Caribbean Legion attacks the state from the outside, dissidents and rebels attack the state from the inside- both with the same goal- bringing down a regime that has lasted over thirty years. Guerrilla attacks, bombings, and assassinations are common, and they are imposing a considerable strain on Trujillo's forces."

DOM_Small_Insurgency: "Small Insurgency"
DOM_Small_Insurgency_desc: "The Puerto Plata Invasion by the Caribbean Legion is not alone in its attempt to takedown the man reigning over the Dominican Republic- they are joined by various dissidents and rebels on the inside of the nation. These forces on the inside have been worn down- they mostly act as support to the Legion as they appear unable to accomplish anything by themselves any longer."

DOM_Nationwide_Crackdown: "Nationwide Crackdown"
DOM_Nationwide_Crackdown_desc: "Rafael Trujillo's iron fist has crashed down on the various rebels and dissidents that had been threatening his rule. Corpses line the streets, the asphalt a fresh, bloody red. Order has been restored to the Dominican Republic- and it will be maintained."

DOM_ceasefire_Mobilization: "National Mobilization"
DOM_ceasefire_Mobilization_desc: ""By order of the President of the Dominican Republic, Dr. Joaquín Balaguer:\nThe current threat of the subversives, traitors, and invaders cannot be understated, as they are in the pay of outside forces who have a vested interest in their success. Therefore, I deem it necessary to proclaim a general and large-scale mobilization throughout the Dominican Republic.\n\nWe are prepared for a life-and-death battle to preserve the stability of Quisqueya, and must be prepared to defend ourselves and our families at all times. We shall not permit the traitors to catch us by surprise again; I hope for, and expect, the cooperation of every citizen of the Nation.""
DOM_ceasefire_New_State: "The New State"
DOM_ceasefire_New_State_desc: "For all that President Balaguer looks back fondly on his relationship with his late kinsman, President Trujillo, he is his own man.\n\nWith age, Trujillo lost any real vision outside of selfish interests and the promulgation of his unrestrained hedonism; that man managed even to make Hermann Göring look temperate by comparison. Balaguer, on the other hand, has a proper plan. In the Dominican Republic under his rule, every citizen will be virtuous and strong, and know the role they play without succumbing to any kind of outside corruption.\n\nThere is no better time than the present. Amidst the present stagnation, if Balaguer uses his chance right and plays his cards correctly, he will be able to turn Quisqueya into a true bastion of virtue amidst the gray sea of the 20th century."

DOM_La_Patria_Nueva_desc: "Quisqueya was once a backwater colony; Trujillo has taken it to be turned into something greater: A new nation; a state and a force to be reckoned with. But this is only one part of his wider vision. Now comes the struggle to build a new culture, a whiter national identity with Trujillo as its founder-prophet. If he succeeds, he will ascend to the heavens as a pater gentis alongside Simón Bolívar and Afonso Henriques - and he'll reach those heavens atop the millions of Haitians who do not fit that culture."
DOM_A_New_State: "A New State?"
DOM_A_New_State_desc: "The wasteful excesses of the Trujillo regime - the open oppression, the racial supremacy - all of it has to go. Balaguer and his cabinet have inherited a nation in desperate need of renovation. So roll up your sleeves, Santo Domingo, and prepare to lay down economic and political reforms befitting a modern nation. By your efforts, these frozen diplomatic ties might thaw, and the rest of the world will start taking our new state seriously."

DOM_Puppet_Caudillo: "The Puppet Caudillo"
DOM_Puppet_Caudillo_desc: "Ramfis Trujillo, Caudillo of the Dominican Republic, spends his days gambling, drinking, and whoring. Far be it from the power behind the throne to interrupt him. The nation's Military Intelligence Service, SIM, maintains control over the state, led by its chief Johnny Abbes García. With an absent Ramfis, the ship of state is helmed by Abbes and SIM—which is most acceptable for Germany, who use their extensive ties with both to use the Dominican Republic as an outpost for German intelligence."

DOM_National_Rescue: "National Rescue Process"
DOM_National_Rescue_desc: "The problem, thought the Dominican oligarchy, was concentrating power in a single man. Empowering a tyrant almost brought them to ruin, and now they must prevent another one from emerging. Distributing power among the oligarchy's interest groups and ancient families will allow them to hold onto power while using each other to keep their worst impulses in check. To the people, they claim this is an attempt at rescuing the Republic; in reality, they're just making sure nobody makes another mess."

DOM_Auxiliary_Occupation: "Auxiliary Occupation"
DOM_Auxiliary_Occupation_desc: "American soldiers prowl the countryside, seeking loyalists to the Trujillo regime. In the Congress Building, deputies are pulled out three to four at a time by witch-hunters in suits and ties, questioned for their loyalties to "extremist elements." The emergency government sanctions these hunts, eager to have the Americans purge the rot that Trujillo left in this country. May they be just and swift in their efforts to root out fascism in this country."

DOM_Pan_American_Force: "The Pan-American Force"
DOM_Pan_American_Force_desc: "When people think of the word "American," they think of fat white men holding a hamburger in one hand and a torch of liberty in the other. But look to the Americans in the Dominican Republic: Brazilian engineers build pillboxes for Mexican sentries, Haitian and Surinamean officers swap smokes and strategies, and soldiers from all ten nations of the West Indies patrol the streets and keep the peace. All over the Dominican Republic, the OAS oversees the transition from despotism to democracy."

DOM_The_Dominican_Peoples_Revolution: "The Dominican People's Revolution"
DOM_The_Dominican_Peoples_Revolution_desc: "When Trujillo's corpse was riddled with bullets and laying on the streets, it was barely the beginning. The tyrant's regime is broken, and now the Dominican people can be united with their destinies back in their hands. The first step for the Dominican Republic's new government is to cement their legitimacy and answer the people's worst fears. For inspiration, they look towards Cuba, and draw parallels with their own revolution to show that this kind of revolution can be successful—while quietly ignoring Cuba's more nationalistic, big-tent reality."
DOM_The_Dominican_Cultural_Revolution: "The Dominican Cultural Revolution"
DOM_The_Dominican_Cultural_Revolution_desc: "The Dominican people, having accepted the necessity and the feasibility of national revolution, now prepare to implement it.

DOM_Starting_from_Scratch_desc: "When you want a new crop, you burn the earth. When the weeds and pests and invasive species have all infested the land, you rip them out, one by one, until there is nothing left but a vast swidden. The Dominican Revolution cleared the fields of the Church's mystical dominion, the brutal and oversized armed forces, and the oligarchy's prodigious influence; now it is time to sow new seeds. Starting the hardest task first, this new state must be rebuilt from the foundation up."
DOM_Economic_Revolution: "Economic Revolution"
DOM_Economic_Revolution_desc: "The new Dominican Republic has the exciting and laborious task of building a new socialist economy out of the ruins of the old Trujillo kleptocracy. A planned economy to cater to the needs of all its citizens; a reformed agricultural base which empowers the farmers and feeds the nation; an education system that is free, accessible and comprehensive to bolster the people's intellect; worker's democracy, food and job security... With a blank canvas, they paint this vision of a socialist utopia."
DOM_Autonomous_Hinche: "The Autonomous Territories of Hinche"
DOM_Autonomous_Hinche_desc: "Hinche was seized by the Trujillo regime, but it was never truly Dominican territory. That has been rectified somewhat by the new Republic, where locally-elected PPLN politicians maintain authority over this autonomous territory. From the city of Charlemagne Peralte, the PPLN wages a guerrilla campaign against the bourgeois Haitian government, and when it comes time for the Dominican Republic to lend a hand, their support begins and is concentrated in Hinche."

Sadly, the list of people who fear this fate is quite long, with skilled labourers and intellectuals having an outsized presence on that list. Along with their experience and knowledge goes their wealth, further immiserating the new Dominican Republic."

DOM_Limits_Of_Tolerance: "The Limits of Tolerance"
DOM_Limits_Of_Tolerance_desc: "The revolutionaries do not understand that their so-called "Revolution" is a mirage. What started with Puerto Plata was but a tragedy, all the good that came from Trujillo's death was almost undone by Civil War, but Balaguer put a stop to it. The Dominican Republic has committed itself to careful change, fine-tuning the policies and principles that have kept us from re-entering the dark ages - and if that means tempering the fires of revolutionary fervour by hook or by crook, so be it."
DOM_Doctor_Prescription: "The Doctor's Prescription"
DOM_Doctor_Prescription_desc: "In Balaguer's eyes, economic growth is not measured in small transactions or little public works. It must be big, wide-sweeping and all-encompassing. His new economic plan for the Dominican Republic has seen massive investments in public development and urban infrastructure. Pave the roads, dam the rivers, dig the canals, lay down the highways, take a wrecking ball to an entire city block and build it anew; this is Balaguer's vision, and he expects to see his economy soar as a result."
DOM_Mending_Our_Path: "Mending Our Path"
DOM_Mending_Our_Path_desc: "Balaguer was a lesser Trujillo in commitment and power; a crypto-fascist who did not need a foreign invasion to be removed. His successor is committed to putting the Dominican Republic back on the right path. The armed forces will serve the people, not the leader; local businesses will be spared the rapacity of conglomerates; the exiles will be welcomed home. When Guzmán is done, the last stain of Trujillo's legacy will be wiped from the nation, and the Dominican Republic will finally be free."

Attempts by the new administration to walk away from his influence have been frustratingly limited, as sympathisers argue over his legacy and the legitimacy of a government that tries to spurn the father of this nation.

# Leader descs
POLITICS_ALBERTO_BAYO_DESC: "This is not Alberto Bayo's first war, nor is it the first conflict or struggle he's seen. At birth, his homeland was Spanish Cuba. He moved to Spain afterwards; when the fascists attacked it, he defied them to the end.\n\nIt has been two decades since Bayo led the failed Spanish Republican operation to reclaim Mallorca—though his men initially succeeded, and believed firmly in an assurance of victory, the Nationalists held on long enough for the Italians to intervene, and for the fascist axis to drive the Republicans back, cutting them down as they fled.\n\nAs had played out too many times beforehand, Bayo was disgraced and stripped from almost all his roles, relegated to the background for the rest of the war. Establishing himself in Mexico and having a brief, inconsequential stint at the Mexican military academy, he lived a life of poverty as a furniture-maker until revolutionaries Ernesto Guevara and Fidel Castro sought him out.\n\nThat was Bayo's first big break, a real, honest-to-God success. Training Guevara and Castro in guerrilla tactics, he joined them in the Granma landing and stayed with them until the Revolution proved victorious—a triumph in which his role proved pivotal. It was in those circumstances that the old revolutionary, now a general of the Cuban army, returned to his birthplace.\n\nNow it is not Cuba or Mallorca, but Quisqueya that is in question. Bayo has grown wise with age, and learned from his mistakes. But he cannot shake the fear that he is similarly placed to the failed operation that cost him everything nearly three decades ago. He cannot—will not—make the same mistake again."
POLITICS_HORACIO_ORNES_DESC: "Horacio Ornes has come far, far indeed, since the hell he went through in the Cibao Mountains after the Disaster of the Luperón Landing in 1959.\n\nIn those lands the locals were hostile and results were few and far between; the cities, however, proved to be ripe with dissidents sick of Trujillo's tyranny. It was those same cities that proved the ideal place to lay the groundwork for the uprising which has now destroyed Trujillo-though the work is not yet done, for the Tyrant's running dogs are still in power in Santo Domingo.\n\nAlmost from his birth in 1922 in Puerto Plata, Ornes seemed fated to fight against the tyranny of the regime. First he was a dissident lawyer and writer, then he exiled himself in order to help extirpate tyranny in all its forms across the Caribbean. But the Cayo Confites Expedition of 1947 failed—what had been meant to attack Trujillo instead ended up getting Cuba and La Habana bombed. The next year the Caribbean Legion split in two, and Fidel Castro's young guard formed the Second Legion; Ornes reluctantly joined them, and struggled for six years in the Cuban mountains.\n\nNow is the time for Ornes to fulfill what he has worked for all this time. His lifelong goal is within grasp, and he will lay everything on the line in this final attempt."

CAL_PPI_cosmopolitan_brotherhood_desc: "At its core, the Second Caribbean Legion is a volunteer army, one sourcing its recruits from all across the Americas. They fight with a single goal, that being to dismantle the cancer of fascism that has spread throughout the region. They share a deep brotherhood, forged through the turmoil of their experiences with the dictatorship, one that transcends national boundaries.\n\nWhilst this brotherhood helps in the conflict, the wide berth of potential recruits can provide some difficulties in communication, as disparities in cultural and linguistic backgrounds make cohesion and orders difficult to translate. Regardless of the difficulties, however, the Legion does not struggle with maintaining a high morale, even with the inefficiencies."

For them, glory is fighting against tyranny, their politics is waging war on autocrats, their currency is their dedication to the cause, and their fortune will be a Caribbean free of fascism.\n\nAnd fortune favors the bold!"

Much of the time, it is true that they have ideological divergences and personal rivalries that stand between them; however, we have a more important goal that has washed all that away - to bury the legacy of Trujillo in the pits of history."

HIS_puertoplata.1.desc: "CONFIDENTIAL\n\nTO: DOCTOR ANTÓNIO OLIVEIRA SALAZAR, GENERALÍSIMO FRANCISCO FRANCO\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC - STRATEGIC ALLY IN THE CARIBBEAN\n\nWith the collapse of the Triumvirate, the main lifeline of the Dominican Republic was severed. Out of concern for the continued security of the state, and viewing Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo's position as vulnerable, a small group of generals within the Armed Forces plotted a coup d'état. The plot was quickly discovered by government intelligence agencies within the last week and was broken up, with little difficulty and no known foreign support.\n\nThis is the first of this kind of plot in over a decade, frequently occurring in the past when Trujillo had not yet consolidated. However, recent events have increased the threat posed by these plots. Several nations within the region are hostile to the regime: Mexico and Venezuela have antagonized it for a long time, and recent events in Cuba have turned them into a centre of anti-Trujillo organization, not to mention the active opposition that the United States has presented since the end of the War. Trujillo has privately expressed concern over future plots receiving backing from said nations, and the chance that they may eventually succeed.\n\nIt is imperative that Trujillo remains in power. The Dominican Republic is currently our closest ally within Latin America, and the efforts of Rafael Trujillo play a key part in our strategic interests. With the collapse of the Triumvirate, many view his government's position as isolated barring for our presence. If his regime were to collapse due to outside pressure, the likely replacements will be far less open to collaboration. Extra attention shall be focused on the nation, and it would be recommended that additional support should be given to the state openly, to improve perceptions of its diplomatic standing.\n\nFrom the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."

HIS_puertoplata.2.desc: "TOP SECRET - [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]\nFROM: EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\nSUBJECT: INSTABILITY WITHIN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\nRecent upheavals geopolitically have left the regime of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo weak. An abortive coup plot attained some momentum shortly after the collapse of the Triumvirate, but was ultimately crushed. Whilst this coup failed, it indicates a shift in trend for Dominican politics. Other coup plots, particularly those that are more organized, seem likely. Furthermore, the nation's diplomatic standing remains isolated barring the presence of Iberia. Efforts to improve relations with nearby nations are unlikely, considering the regime has turned into a pariah state throughout the past decade.\n\nSeveral special agents in the field have used their connections with loyal officials in portions of the Dominican Republic to uncover the failed coup. The response was a minor purge, which has concerned some officials. In Cuba, plans to aid the Caribbean Legion in replacing Trujillo are underway (Read attached for more info). Continued military presence from Dominican forces on the Haitian border suggest that foreign policy remains unchanged.\n\nIt is imperative that we ensure that the regime governed by Trujillo is replaced. Most local opposition is broadly unified against Trujillo's sympathetic behavior to Fascist and anti-American regimes in Europe and Latin America. Such opposition is also sympathetic to us, or to Cuba and Mexico. In combatting Trujillo, special agents have been sent over to provide aid to insurgents and organize them for the Legion's planned offensive. Agents are also currently organizing opposition within the Dominican military, with some success."

These agents were given the task of counterespionage, in order to discover any potential plots to overthrow Rafael Trujillo's government. Recent findings suggest that the risk of a foreign-backed plot to remove Trujillo are correct.\n\nThrough a mixture of intimidation, interception, and bribery, our agents have managed to partially infiltrate a group of 2,000 soldiers belonging to the Caribbean Legion, receiving training in amphibious landing and drilled in combat, and is composed mostly of political dissidents who left the nation in recent years, along with volunteers from Cuba and abroad. There is little reason to doubt that they are preparing for an attack against the Dominican Republic, especially with patterns of recent attacks from insurgent cells targeting several coastal regions.\n\nThis is a major deterioration in prospects for the Dominican Republic, and a government similar to that of Cuba would doubtlessly be hostile to us, not to mention it would jeopardize our interests in Latin America as a whole. The Dominican government has been promptly warned of the threat, and is preparing for a major, sudden war. Beyond this, the intensity of our efforts to uncover the Legion's plans will likely prevent future advances without putting our agents at heightened, unneeded risks. Several contingency plans have been prepared for an event of this manner, and should be executed immediately."

The United States, in coordination with Cuba and Mexico are currently training a small contingent of the Carribean Legion, which has taken a direct stance in opposition to dictatorial regimes in the region. With reports of amphibious operations training, it seems likely that they plan to attack through sea, and will link up with dissidents and insurgent forces within to attempt to stage a popular revolution.\n\nWithin recent events, Iberia has become the sole backer of the Dominican Republic. It seems likely that they have discovered the plans of the Americans and Cubans as well, with a heightened presence of known security agents. Santo Domingo is neutral in regards to policy directed at us, and Iberia is hostile. It seems unlikely that backing the Dominican government will change this outlook. As such, any potential gains shall be negligible in the near future.

HIS_puertoplata.5.desc: "TOP SECRET - [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong]\nFROM: EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT\nSUBJECT: PLANNED INTERVENTION IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\nThe Caribbean Legion is wrapping up its training plans, which have had moderate success. The landing in Puerto Plata is scheduled to begin in two months, after deliberation between the Department of Defense, and the joint intelligence agencies of Mexico and Cuba. In coordination with this, a generalized uprising is planned to occur in cities across the country. It is assumed that Trujillo's regime and his foreign backers are aware of the plans for the invasion and uprising.\n\nReports provided by local officers have noted that the Legion have improved in their abilities, but that previous experience limited the benefits. Some weapons and communication supplies have been granted to local insurgent cells and regiments that will join the uprising, with the expectation that they shall distract Trujillo's military outside of key regions for landings. Recent crackdowns from Trujillo's regime have targeted key cells, and tactics seem more in line with Iberian anti-terrorist methods. Furthermore, Dominican stockpiles are reportedly acquiring modern air defense systems, suggesting that investments are being made to dissuade invasion.\n\nIt is important to recognise the risk this poses to the planned intervention. These likely won't preclude defeat, but involvement from foreign governments risks turning the conflict into a protracted struggle, which would jeopardize the success of the operation. Many of those risks, however, have been known for a long period. Special agents have attempted to discover and capture foreign agents, but their focus remains on ensuring the landings succeed. It would be advisable to provide the Caribbean Legion with firm support from the US Air Force and Navy, to minimize risk."

Training programmes within have seen a reduction in intensity, and increasing shipments of military equipment have been noticed in and around the camp in recent weeks. Beyond this, statements from several high-ranking figures within Cuba have seen an increase in focus on the Dominican Republic, with clear hostile remarks. Action by insurgent cells within coastal regions of the Dominican Republic have also increased in intensity, even as counter-insurgency action increases.\n\nWe predict that, at the current rate, an attack against the Dominican Republic will occur in no more than two months, and likely sooner. In order to counteract this, it is highly recommended that we make our own preparations. Several contingency plans have already been drafted for your consideration. Planning shall continue, alongside the introduction of a heightened presence of special forces from our own military, and of equipment from our stockpiles.

Combat training has reduced in intensity, stockpiles of weapons have more than doubled in the preceding month, and several landing vessels are resting in ports close to the camps where the contingent of the Caribbean Legion resides. Combat and anti-insurgent activity within the Dominican Republic has increased, although the extent of success is difficult to accurately assess. It is likely that Trujillo's government at large recognises the risk posed by the Caribbean Legion, although it is improbable that they are aware of the full extent.\n\nPreliminary estimates predict that the invasion by the Legion shall begin in roughly two months. Some efforts have been made to establish cells within the island of Hispaniola, although progress in that direction is limited. Those that have succeeded will be directed to undermine the efforts of the Legion. In the meantime, aid has been sent to the Dominican Republic, and has been broadly accepted, even if the leadership remains unmoved on their diplomatic outlook towards us at this stage.

HIS_puertoplata.10.desc: "The pilot grinned. He'd been waiting a rather long time for any action. Tilting the flight stick forward, he pulled back the throttle as his A-6 Intruder pitched forward and accelerated. He squeezed the trigger, lightly at first, before growing more firm. The pull let loose an arc of fire and death, directed at the huge hill in front of him, atop which a statue of Christ the Redeemer stood. The hill he knew was dotted with fascist artillery.\n\nThe most important part of any artillery team is the spotter, his job is to find targets and instruct the man behind the guns. Today, the spotter certainly spotted something, but not a target. An American plane was racing towards his position, and it was bringing death. He could see the fire spreading from its guns, and he could only grimace. The spotter raised the radio to his lips and spoke- a warning? A cry for help? Nobody could tell - it was drowned out by the sounds of explosions and fire. Plane after plane flew over what had once been an artillery position, signaling that the invasion had begun. This story was unfolding around the Dominican Republic, American planes were pounding military targets. Below the planes, in the sea, landing craft crashed onto the shore - and over two thousand men stormed off of them - fighting for liberty, fighting against fascism.\n\nThe attack on the outside was joined by an attack on the inside: Rebels, insurgents, mobs, they all joined their comrades on the outside in their fight to overthrow the dictator. Guns of all kinds were used, from modern ones supplied by the FBI, to ancient firearms that predate the First World War. Makeshift spears, clubs - anything that could help put an end to the regime.\n\nThe effort paid off. Before Trujillo had a clear picture of the situation, the landing at Puerto Plata had succeeded - and shortly after that, the auxiliary landing at Luperón, 30 clicks west, had the same results. In the White House's Situation Room, President Richard Nixon nodded at the mustached man sitting across from him. Fidel Castro nodded back - Commander Bayo had just sent a wire."

But this parade was that of triumph - the ones who had come to topple the fascists had achieved their aims. Arms linked together, Comandante Bayo and Comandante Ornes marched in a line with their comrades-in-arms; Uribarri, Morgan, Menoyo, Cubela, and Caamaño, their weapons slung on their backs. Behind them marched a mixed honor guard of legionnaires and rebels. Bayo looked ahead at the elegant domed building that was the National Palace. It wasn't as ornate as the former Presidential Palace in La Habana, but it kept the same beauty. Yet it hadn't been unscathed from the fighting that took place earlier, as Santo Domingo became a quick and brutal battleground. Windows were broken, bullet marks riddled the walls and pillars, and smoke rose out of the dome from where fire had been put out.\n\nThe fighting was over, and the scenes that had followed Fidel's triumph now replicated themselves in Dominican streets. Collaborators were being singled out and pushed into cars by rebel forces, while loyalist forces surrendered to legionnaires and were led away, hands up and heads bowed. Memorabilia from the collaborators burned in the streets, statues smashed to pieces, houses looted clean. Rebels and captured loyalists helped grieving civilians collect the dead off the streets.\n\nThe parade halted, and the rebel leadership made their way into the palace. Unlike Fidel's revolution, the meeting was tense, not comradely. They all had different visions for the future, and their alliance was starting to crack. But they needed to keep public appearances.\n\nSo they stood on the palace's steps, arms linked again, until Ornes strode to the podium, surrounded by the banners of the Legion. Below him waited journalists from all over the Caribbean, mainly American and Mexican, several camera crews, and a cheering crowd waving Cuban and Dominican flags. Ornes was no Fidel, but his authoritative voice was an instant attention-getter.\n\n"Revolutionaries!

After all, a victory for Trujillo meant a victory for Iberia.\n\nAll of a sudden there were several dozen Americans stuck as POWs in the Dominican Republic, and now Nixon had to bend over backwards to get at least some of them back. And who could have been better to mediate such talks than a friendly (enough) state in Europe with ties to both the Americans and Dominicans? And wouldn't you know it?

So now the ambassador and Iberian industrialists drooled at all the favors the US would soon owe them all, and so too would Trujillo.\n\nWith Trujillo's reign secured from all enemies both internal and external, Iberia could now rest easy in the region.

Outside the handful of unlucky members of the staff chosen to be put on the line of fire did their best to calm down the crowds gathering around the building. No matter all their shouting and waving of white flags, the endless mass of people kept crawling closer. And all the Ambassador did was sit at his desk with his head domed by his hands.\n\nIt was right in front of him. It was a simple telephone. Black and plastic like thousands of others. But to the ambassador it might have as well had "political suicide" embroidened in big red letters. There was one thing that would give him more time. One thing that would protect him and the rest of the staff. One thing that would ensure that Iberia could save some face in this whole disaster. Or rather, there was one group of people who could do such a thing.\n\nThe Americans could yank back the chain of their rabid dogs on the island and stop them from hurting the staff or him. The Americans could give them a plane back to the states and then back to Iberia. The Americans could ensure that their press didn't speak too much about Iberia's dealings in the past couple weeks. He'd have to beg and get on his knees but they'd do it. Desperation would drive a man to do anything, even forfeiting all cards that Iberia had left in the Caribbean to the Americans.

Its American-backed leadership and the assorted renegades in the armed forces that rebelled to join it have died, been captured, or fled to Haiti. The regime has now consolidated itself and its enemies are purged.\n\nThe opportunity this affords us cannot be understated. Because of our role in Trujillo's victory, we have an avenue towards closer relations with his government. Furthermore, we have also successfully infiltrated the Dominican intelligence agency at a deep level, which cannot but prove helpful in future.\n\nRegardless, the main objective of our operation is successfully achieved: that of preventing the Americans from closing a vulnerable spot within their own backyard.

"Let's talk Trujillo."\n\nAnd then the war machine sprang into action. Boy-faced advisors laid down models of the Dominican Republic across the desk, moving toys representing Rebel-aligned and Dominican forces, along with some figures representing believed Iberian and German assets. A small discarded figure of Trujillo, an X drawn dramatically across his face lay to the side. America had achieved its aims, had vanquished the would-be tyrant and put a permanent end to his grand ambitions. Based on the briefing, the United States could go home now with its head held high.\n\n"I sense a 'but' coming, gentlemen," Nixon said in a sly voice.\n\nAn advisor looked about the room, as if to ensure no one had snuck in.

"Joaquín Balaguer, right-hand man of Trujillo, has taken power following his superior's death. There are some early reports that he might even be behind it.

I understand this has caused your government great difficulties with Havana and Mexico City, has it not?"\n\n"Uh, yes, Mr. President."

Given the tumultuous state of global relations as of late, a path to normalized relations with Washington would be useful to have open, even if we ultimately choose not to embark on it.

Another satisfactory response followed. Nixon chuckled and quipped into the receiver, "I bet those Spaniards were running, tails between their legs. Good man." One finger rose onto the switch hook, and Nixon added, "Expect a call soon," before closing the line. That was Haldeman's signal to begin his watch.\n\nA flurry of footsteps and wheels followed as Haldeman's personnel brought the cutting-edge conference bridge in front of the Resolute Desk. "What the he-" Nixon caught himself in front of the crowd. "Bob, what is this?" Staffers plugged the Presidential telephone into the device and laid cords out the office door. Transfixed on his stopwatch, Haldeman replied, "For the conference call, Mr. President," and idly handed Nixon the relevant memo from his desktop stack.

The voice of President Castro rippled back through the speakers, "President Nixon, everybody, a well-deserved congratulations!" Also on the line were the President of Mexico and representatives of the new Dominican government in Miami and Santo Domingo, who intoned similar well-wishes. Then, everybody talked at once, and the sound became unpleasantly distorted.

The pretender, Pupo Román has been swept from the National Palace, and our nephew, Ramfis Trujillo, has taken up his father's sword to purge our beloved land from the communistic vagrants that style themselves the Dominican Revolutionary Front.\n\nThis victory would not have been possible without your fulsome support of the true Congress of the Dominican Republic, whether in its legislative capacity or in uniting its many and valiant exiles through the written word. Through the Congress, we made Dominican generals and the public aware of the carnage that these Bolshevik demons would wreak upon our land. Seeing that Román was poised to hand the country over to these godless miscreants, at the behest of Washington, Havana, and Mexico City, they arose with fury and valor that mirrored yours in 1936, Caudillo Franco.\n\nWe have absolute certainty that these righteous Dominican soldiers will put down the faux-legion with the same ease as they uprooted the usurper. With our nephew taking the field and ourselves tirelessly organizing the cause and rallying the exile community, Iberia's investment in our nation's order and promise shall be fulfilled and repaid in short order.\n\nWith highest regard,"

The 'legionnaire' scum have been eradicated, the July 14th brigands captured or killed, and order and peace restored to our homeland.\n\nAttached you will find an official declaration from the Congress of the Dominican Republic, its last and foremost issued on Iberian soil.

Where Kefauver and General Eisenhower had failed, a Navy man from East Whittier had smashed Trujillo's fascist bridgehead and given the U.S. its biggest public relations triumph in Latin America this century.\n\nAs the diplomats swirled, Nixon gestured to Román, and they set off down together, translators in tow. The duo exited into the Gallery of Heroes, Nixon locking eyes briefly with the bust of Washington before carefully steering his guest left. There, just before the staircase, Nixon stopped in front of the statue of Juan Pablo Duarte.\n\nWith a solemn face, Nixon began, "He is a hero for Dominicans, a hero for all the peoples of the Americas.

The Marine officer barked as the transports landed, and soldiers disembarked in quick succession by the dozens into the port.\n\nThe rest of the ships that accompanied the US Navy fleet remained a short distance off the port of Santo Domingo, and more transports were approaching, filled with more Marines. The officer ponders the fact that it hadn't been long ago that they'd been bombing these ports, and now here they were, as allies.\n\nAt least that was what the Dominican Republic called them - the military government, at least. Even though they'd been invited, it wasn't enough to dispel the clear tension and suspicion, especially from the Dominican soldiers who eyed the Marines warily, no doubt memories of the bombings lingering in their minds. Nonetheless, they worked with the Marines as they began their work in the city, and across the island.\n\nAs far as the officer had heard, it was going to be a very temporary arrangement - once the situation was resolved, the US was pulling out right away. This was what America did for her allies wasn't it? Help them in their time of need? At the same time, he knew how these 'temporary' occupations sometimes went.\n\nWithin hours, the Marines had set up checkpoints and secured key infrastructure throughout the city to their satisfaction. More soldiers continued arriving until there were several thousand Marines in the city of Santo Domingo. The Marine companies were organized, briefs provided, and orders distributed.\n\nSome more hours later, those companies were deployed throughout the Dominican interior, where they would secure the island piece by piece, until they were certain they could maintain stability.

American forces have established full control over critical points of interest, established lines of communication throughout the country, and positioned US forces to be able to rapidly respond to unrest or violence.\n\nThe success of the operation, and the low likelihood of disruption requires an assessment on the future of the Dominican Republic. The United States holds the ability to shape the direction of the country, and options must be carefully considered. Two primary courses of action have been identified:\n\n1) The United States extends the existing mandate of the current military government until such a time as elections are ready. This would delay elections until both the government and US advisors assess the country is ready. This would almost certainly guarantee a Dominican Republic aligned to the United States, but might be unpopular with the Dominican public and Caribbean region.\n\n2) The United States moves to hold elections as soon as possible, which the military government is unlikely and unwilling to contest. This would dissolve the current government, and establish an interim civilian one until elections are held.\n\nIt is almost certain that if elections are held in the current climate, Dr. Juan Bosch would emerge victorious. A Bosch administration would almost certainly not be unconditionally supportive of US interests, as he is critical of many US policies. However, his victory would demonstrate the United States' commitment to democracy, and almost certainly improve our regional image, especially in Cuba and Mexico."

Noting a Toyota with shaded windows trailing Bosch's taxi for multiple blocks, a DFS agent rammed the vehicle with his own while calling for backup. Two armed men fled the Toyota, but were pursued and dispatched by multiple agents in a firefight.\n\nThe profile of one of the assassins matched a known SIM agent, but the other was unknown to DFS sources. Both possessed high-quality fabricated documents identifying them as Banco de Comercio employees and carrying modern German armaments. Agents are currently attempting to identify SIM contacts, safehouses, or entry points used by the two men, but progress has been slowed by injuries sustained in the operation.\n\nUntil such time as those assets are seized and the lack of additional infiltrators confirmed, Bosch's safety cannot be guaranteed. The Trujillo government has also responded to past defeats by targeting Mexican security and political officials. Further espionage operations by the Dominican Republic constitute an escalating threat to national security.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nCaptain Luis de la Barreda Moreno"

How special then, to receive a message, not from yet another communist or synarchist agitator, but from a true revolutionary. From Fidel Castro.\n\nThe two had become acquainted in inauspicious circumstances. In '56, Gutiérrez had trailed the Cuban and his guerillas as they plotted Batista's downfall from a ranch in Mexico State. The first time Castro saw his face, Fernando was slapping handcuffs on him.\n\nBut in the interrogations that followed, Castro's words had not been those of a criminal but those of a revolutionary out to topple a Cuban Huerta. Or those of a possible asset for Mexico. They came to... an arrangement, and Gutiérrez Barrios arranged for the dissidents' release. As the rebels set sail from Túxpam to their homeland, the duo had shaken hands.\n\nThe telegram now in that same hand carried congratulations on Gutiérrez's promotion and anodyne tales of Castro's latest hunting and fishing. Their typical friendly correspondence... until the Dominican Question arose.\n\nCastro argued that the time was right to rid Hispaniola of its tinpot fascist dictator. The Republic's German patrons are spread thin, and old allies like the Church are growing estranged. Abbes and his SIM are briefly shaken by the failed assassination attempt on Bosch. The June 14th urban guerillas are swelling in strength, fueled by dissatisfaction among the Dominican youth and middle class. Three years of Mexican and Cuban subversion efforts are now coalescing into a perfect storm.\n\nGutiérrez Barrios would alert Secretary Díaz Ordaz and the President of this temporary opportunity, along with his recommendation to take full advantage of it."

Pulling the latter closer to his mouth, "Certainly Fidel, Captain Gutiérrez informs me that you're considering action against the Trujillo regime. What is your plan, and what are you asking of us?"\n\n"A coup. We both want Trujillo and Batista in coffins and the rest of the regime swept away. It's splintering, Adolfo, civilian leaders and generals are already covertly reaching out to our assets and yours. We push and the rest of the rats jump overboard."\n\nEl Comandante continued, "My request is to establish an office for joint intelligence operations in Havana. Tomorrow morning, Captain Gutiérrez will send you the brief on the Oficina Conjunta de Asuntos Externos, or OCAE, as we've been calling it. The value of our Dominican networks would grow exponentially if we tied them together. This Joint Office of Foreign Affairs would also provide a single point-of-contact as we coordinate with internal dissidents and exiles like the June 14th Movement and help organize the Caribbean Legion."\n\nLópez Mateos had been sneaking a surreptitious swig of coffee, just as Gutiérrez had apparently been sneaking around with Castro and going around the chain of command. Their choice of allies was worrisome too. Here in Mexico, the Caribbean Legion were kept under tight watch, but who knows what those squabbling crypto-communists would get up to in Hispaniola. But... if anyone could overthrow a monstrous Caribbean dictator, it was these two. And Gutiérrez could be counted on to keep the radicals in check. "You have Mexico's support, Fidel.

From memory, he laid out the targets of the saboteurs that would spring into action once the Caribbean Legion got to shore. The capstone was a plot to coup Trujillo and usher in a joint civil-military government.\n\nWinston claimed that high-ranking military officials were prepared to move as soon as El Jefe was dead. And it wouldn't be of old age. The FBI had already smuggled M14 rifles and thousands of dollars to a group of insiders, including a member of Trujillo's personal guard.\n\nAt that last point, Mexico's Fernando Gutiérrez Barrios broke his silence, "Amado García Guerrero. The DFS is likewise supplying that group through General Díaz, though we've prioritized connecting them with sympathetic regime members rather than providing material." To Winston's cocked eyebrow, he responded, "A different Díaz, Modesto, and another well-placed man who saved Juan Bosch's life."\n\n"Interesting..." Winston replied, drumming his fingers on the table, "And how could the FBI be of assistance to the DFS?"\n\n"We're working to coordinate the various June 14th cells into a broader uprising. If your saboteurs prioritize disrupting SIM communications around Santiago the day of the invasion, I anticipate the successful seizure of the city center.

His older brother hawked wood carvings on the street. But his Grandfather. . . his Grandfather was a proud peasant who had refused to take the abuse from the Haciendas, and joined the División del Norte. To hear him tell of his time on his horse with a 30-30 Carbine, Andre's Grandfather was one of the last of a generation of men, before modern capitalism had broken their backs.\n\n"To know you is to live, and to serve you is to reign..." The white sands of Puerto Plata stretched as far as Andre could see, dividing the Dominican city from the endless blue sky and sea. By his side were men of every type and persuasion - Mexican boys like him, veterans of the Cuban Revolution, Dominican dissidents, revenge-seeking Hatians, and Yanquis just willing to fight. This was more than the vaqueros and American cowboys Grandfather stood with. The whole of the Americas was coming together to destroy tyranny, injustice, ignorance -\n\n"Through the intercession of Michael the Archangel, be our protection against all evil..." But Andre's stomach was in knots. He was not in Mexico City. He was in a foreign land, a hostile land, full of Fascists and Hitlerites who wanted him dead. If he made a mistake, he would die. He was marching toward the Faro, the iconic lighthouse of the city. Perhaps his training was the only thing that kept him moving and not collapsing from fright.\n\n"Help me overcome war and violence and establish your law of love and justice..."

With their beacon lights off, he could only spot the other aircraft by the stars they obscured. 25 holes in the night sky, bound for an airfield in southern Cuba that didn't exist on any map. The only noise in the cockpit was the dull roar of the jet engine. They had been ordered to keep their radios off for the duration of the flight. The higher-ups didn't want the Dominicans to know the squadron was being moved to Cuba. It wasn't without risk; it could be difficult to keep track of other airplanes at the best of times. To say it was harder when you couldn't speak with your squadmates was an understatement.\n\nComplications arose when the planes soared into a towering cloud bank that stretched away to the horizon in both directions. What little frame of reference Luis had suddenly disappeared. The only thing keeping him airborne and on the flight path were the glowing dials on the instrument panel. Suddenly, a bout of turbulence struck Luis's plane. He managed to keep control over the aircraft, and nudged the stick forward to descend out of the lashing air currents. Glancing down at the instrument panel, he noted that he had nearly 100 meters of altitude. He was just thankful he didn't slam into one of the other planes.\n\nThe cloud must have been several kilometers wide. It took the better part of an hour to pass through. When Luis emerged, there was no sign of his comrades. Only the brilliant array of stars above, and the lights of a ship lazily drifting in the warm ocean below. Luckily, he had not strayed far enough off course to miss the Cuban coastline. Navigation over land was much easier. After lining up the lights of the towns with the maps provided for him, it was just a matter of pointing the plane in the right direction.\n\nAnother hour passed in silence before he spotted the airfield. A cluster of intersecting dirt runways illuminated by dim bulbs well over a mile from the closest village. He circled once, saw the runway was clear, and brought his plane down. After he taxied his plane to the side, a battered jeep rolled up to his plane to ferry him to the barracks for some much needed sleep. Climbing into the passenger seat, he asked the driver if anyone else had arrived yet."

But this was no ordinary day.\n\nThe Caribbean Legion lines had collapsed into full rout. The June 14th dissidents in the capital fared no better, with the tightened repression of the new regime and breakthroughs at the front sparking a mass flight to the Haitian border. Others, desperate for a sea evacuation, overwhelmed docks and harbours across Puerto Plata to seek their escape, pleading to the innocent, inconspicuous trawlers across the way - Mexican trawlers, that is - that have been covertly supplying the Legion ever since its campaign began in earnest.\n\nLópez Mateos, in his thoughts, realised the nation had not come as close to diplomatic catastrophe since the Nazis forced Camacho's hand after they attacked Mexican oil tankers - to say nothing of the Guatemalans opening fire on his countrymen's fishing boats back in 1959.\n\nHe would be endangering the lives of all of these sailors if he gave the order to move in.

And then over the Aleutians, Nixon went behind my back and deceived Secretary Ordaz! These are no aberrations, Fidel, these were deliberate crimes - all to further their own interests."\n\n"We need a plan of action, Excellency. What will Mexico do?"\n\nLópez Mateos let out a laugh, quickly sizzled out in the heat of his rage as he gestured and pointed with fervour. "We continue as planned. The Legion will get our full support, weapons, intelligence, munitions. As for the gringos?" He tightened his fists.

However, Castro had no sweets to offer but fine tobacco and coffee. Instead, some Dominican cake was ferried in from a nearby celebration for the Caribbean Legion.\n\n"I feel it too. The hearts of our three nations beat in harmony now," Mateos sipped gently at the coffee, letting its bitterness mix with the lingering sweetness of the cake's Italian meringue icing. "The regime's defeat is a great opportunity to expand our influence in the Caribbean. I hope that this revolutionary spirit can spread."\n\n"It was electric out there. Your people sure know how to show their appreciation." Castro thought back on the only just recently passed parade he headed. He and the Cuban contingent of the Caribbean Legion had come to Mexico City to celebrate the liberation of the Dominican Republic. "The people will see sweet opportunity fall into their laps. It is all thanks to our great work, Adolfo. And, of course, I must thank you for your contributions, Captain."\n\nGutiérrez politely nodded at the Cuban president before speaking up. "I'm glad you are so optimistic, but we are not completely finished with the island. My sources indicate that Legion radicals appear to be organizing a Marxist coup."\n\n"They can try all they like.

MEX_Puerto_Plata.11.desc: "For a moment, sweet. Then President López Mateos got kicked in the mouth.\n\nBefore the taste of his second shot of tequila subsided, he started pouring the third since news of the Caribbean Legion's calamitous failure reached Los Pinos. It would have been his fifth had he not spent twenty minutes berating Ordaz before dispatching him to shut down the Legion training camps and cover up any trace of Mexican involvement. Trujillo's assassins would be coming for him soon enough, he didn't want to be hiding from foreign journalists as well.\n\nA knock on the door. Salinas' voice on the other side, "Forgive me, Your Excellency, but I'd like to share something that may be useful in this difficult time." A brusque grunt was sufficient welcome for the Secretary, who entered bearing a bottle of fine sake. The president and the norteño locked eyes... and laughed.\n\nSoon the duo were barely upright, a small forest of shot glasses surrounding them on the president's desk. For perhaps the third time, Salinas shared his theory of what had gone wrong, "You shee, Adolfo, it's typical Yanqui adventurism. Washington wants to dominate their shurroundings, they couldn't risk a shtrong or independent Legion. They ensnare us in their half-baked plan and then pull the punch."\n\nA small voice in López Mateos mind called out that he and Castro had decided to back Trujillo's overthrow all on their own. Had cast away the lives of countless young men willing to fight for freedom. Had stretched and bent the Estrada Doctrine for the sake of a fool's errand.\n\nA swig straight from the bottle drowned that voice. His own croaked out, "Damn right, Raúl. Damn right.""

MEX_Puerto_Plata.12.desc: "Gustavo Díaz Ordaz prided himself on keeping a straight face against all challenges. Fernando Gutiérrez Barrios had learned to play his cards straight to his chest, to conceal his true feelings. But a brief glance between the two was mutually understood - neither knew why they were here. All they knew was that López Mateos had called them to his office in the Palacio Nacional at once.\n\nAfter a few moments of unacknowledgement, López Mateos reached under a stack of papers and pulled out a book. A textbook - for secondary schoolers. On the cover were drawings of Zapata, Villa, and Obregón. "This," López Mateos began, "is the first standardized textbook on the Mexican Revolution. Because of our efforts, every child in Mexico will receive it free of charge in their history class. They can hear the same stories, see the same heroes, and understand the truth of the Revolution. And they can understand our need to fight ignorance and poverty today as these men fought against Díaz and Huerta back then. But there's a problem with it." Ordaz and Barrios stared blankly.\n\n"We just wrote another book about the revolution - but we can't publish it." A smile broke across his face. "We crushed another dictatorship, not at home, but abroad. We stood up and put a stop to Trujillo. We showed the world the Mexican Revolution isn't Mexican; every man in Latin America can follow the trail we tread and end the universal evils of disenfranchisement and neglect. Make no mistake; this is one of the proudest moments in the history of Mexico - but if even a fraction of the story got out, we would be crucified for it.\n\n"I cannot shout it from that balcony over there like the Grito, we cannot celebrate it like the Oil Expropriation, we cannot put this new book into the hands of every Mexican child. But I can tell you exactly how I feel right now, if I cannot tell the world or Mexico itself. And eventually our nation will know what we have accomplished in the Dominican Republic.""

MEX_Puerto_Plata.13.desc: ""It was a powerful speech, but only if words could kill," Fidel Castro said, gripping a glass of whisky on the rocks dangerously tight. López Mateos paced a high balcony overlooking Havana, even the pastel buildings lining the city's wide streets could not distract him from his indignation.\n\n"When you're as powerful as us, they ought to." Mateos scrunched the piece of paper that held his personal speech notes and addendums, his writers never fully grasped his passion. He had flown to the Cuban capitol to try and salvage some shred of international dignity after being juked twice, first by Nixon switching sides to Balaguer and then by the Legion itself signing on to this farce of a Santo Domingo Agreement. He was forced to get up on a stage with Castro and publicly lambast the people he was just supporting. He and Castro spent the morning delivering a joint statement declaring the Agreement a betrayal of the Dominican Republic's aspirations for liberty and independence as envisioned by Duarte. "Where did it all go so wrong? Everything was in place."\n\n"The bastards don't know what's good for them." Under the colorful awning, Castro shaded his shared anger with cool words. "They should know better than to get in bed with the Yanquis, or to dirty their hands embracing fascists."\n\n"I never should have trusted that wicked crook Nixon after the Aleutian affair." Mateos stepped into the shade and grabbed a waiting glass of cool water. The condensation wet his hands as he gulped passionately at the refreshing liquid. "Nor the pack of mercenaries and scoundrels that call themselves the Caribbean Legion."\n\n"Ignore those who failed you." Castro grimaced at the implications of Mateos' wide-reaching condemnation. Instead of a retort, Castro offered his hand to the haranguing president. "You have my word. Mexico and Cuba will always stand together.""

On one of the many beautiful beaches that dot the city's coast López Mateos stands with General Pupo Román and Fidel Castro as they watch the ships of Legionnaires returning to Cuba depart from the harbor. Like one of the American cowboy movies, the victorious Legion rides into the sunset. Deep reds and yellows splashed across the blue ocean like fireworks cascading across the sky. All along the coast Dominicans cheer in joyous celebration. They drink in the streets. Some ascend onto the former trujillista jail that overlooks the sea, the Fortaleza San Felipe. Many take to the beach itself.\n\nMateos looks at the sand, sea, and people jealously. Deep down, he wished he could rip off his suit and join them. To splash and play in a way befitting the joy of the day. Instead, he let their display fill his heart. He never thought he'd stand in the Dominican Republic, let alone one freed from Trujillo's tyranny. Mateos turns to Román with a tear in his eye. "Thank you, General, for inviting me to join you for this historic moment. I will hold onto this memory dearly."\n\n"You are too kind. You deserve to be here." Román gripped the Mexican President's arm in a handshake. "Thank you. The Republic would not be liberated; I would not walk freely on this beach without Mexico's aid." Mateos pulled Román's handshake into a hug. They embraced as warmly as two male politicians could. In the distance, news cameras flashed to capture the friendship of nations and the freedom to be happy.\n\n"Now, Your Excellency," Román continued. "I believe an exquisite dinner has been prepared for us."\n\n"That sounds nice." Mateos looked back out to the kaleidoscopic horizon, "But give me ten minutes. I wish to watch the sunset.""

hispaniola_news.1.desc: "The collapse of the Triumvirate has upturned much of Europe's geopolitical position, and the aftershocks still ripple, now crossing an ocean. The Dominican Republic under Rafael Trujillo has long acted as a gateway into the Americas for the former European Axis powers, overseeing trade agreements while evading abortive assassinations orchestrated by the United States.\n\nTrujillo's luck today seems to have run thin. The Caribbean Legion, an army of anti-fascist volunteers led by the Spanish-Republican exile Alberto Bayo have landed in Puerto Plata, intending to oust the Generalissimo. In conjunction with them, the American and Cuban Air Forces are collaborating in bombing runs on key Dominican positions in the north. As reports of mutinies and revolts trickle in from inside the Dominican Republic, it is clear that the fight for its future has now begun."

Balaguer's supporters put up a firmer fight than expected, and held off longer than most predictions. However, it eventually became clear that the regime's situation was untenable as Dominican rebels continued to approach Santo Domingo.\n\nIn a similar scene to the victory of the Cuban Revolution, the victorious rebel leadership has entered Santo Domingo in linked arms as bands of vigilantes gather up former collaborators and sack their properties."

Bodies now pile up nationwide, but these belong to those who became enemies of the dictator, not to his loyalists. As the last exiles either surrender or escape, the greatest challenge to Trujillo has been seen off.\n\nThe failed attack on the island has left the Carribean Legion broadly crippled, with most writing off the last survivors quietly escaping across the Haitian border as little more than a sideshow. This failure has humiliated both the United States and Cuba, not only as they have cemented the presence of a hostile fascist power in the Caribbean, but now they have to bend to its will for the sake of the prisoners of war now inside Trujillo's dungeons."

This failed, though, as his vehicle was accosted by a handful of mutineers.\n\nWhat followed was a mass celebration across Cuba as he was quickly flown into the island. Paraded and publically humiliated across the streets of Havana, Batista was placed under a public show trial, in which he was accused of a litany of crimes, including corruption, sedition, hundreds of counts of murder, and high treason. His death sentence came as no surprise, the ruling being followed by the televised execution of the former dictator."

Officially, the objective is to retaliate against and neutralize the Haitian communist guerrilla spillover into the Dominican Republic.\n\nHowever, most geopolitical analysts believe that this reason is simply a façade to mask a strategic move by the Trujillo regime to annex Haiti and secure this exposed flank while the possibility is open given Haiti's suspended status within the Organization of Free Nations.

Balaguer has wasted no time in executing a lightning purge of political rivals and Trujillo loyalists after forcing their leader into exile. In a nationally televised broadcast, Balaguer declared the dissolution of the Caudillato, promising a process of political liberalization and reform away from the unbridled tyranny of recent days.\n\nThe new regime faces significant challenges as it seeks to build a more open and democratic society. The legacy of Trujillismo looms large, and many Dominicans remain skeptical of Balaguer's promises.

"You were aiding communists."\n\n"Oh, this again? It was a war, dear," his wife, Flérida interjected. "Wimpy didn't get to pick who was friend and foe, and besides! It was a fantastic experience; why, how else would he have ended up training the fly boys down here?"\n\n"Ah, those were the days! Oh! My students have always loved this one, so one time, I had to make a landing in the forest, and there was this Yakut..." The officer sighed but marched on. Distracted by the couple's endless jabbering, he took no notice of two men named Carl and James hauling heavy crates to the market's storage rooms. Wimpy had made a lot of friends during his time as an instructor for the Dominicans, and nothing put him in a furor like seeing them getting killed for nothing; it is why he quit the job after the fascists killed Tavito and Murphy and why he leaped at the chance to get back at their killers. Smuggling FBI weapons in through his own business kept him and Flérida awake at night, but they'd sleep well once justice was done: the fascists, six feet under."

USA_Trujillo_Conspiracy.4.t: "Ducks In A Row"
USA_Trujillo_Conspiracy.4.desc: "The streets of the Dominican Republic seemed quieter these days. If you weren't police or some government thug, the common wisdom seemed to be 'stay off the streets and keep your head down.' Something big was coming, something world-changing, and everyone knew it. Only a few men could say what it was, and Consul Dearborn hoped he was one of them. Stepping away from the office window, Dearborn turned to address his guests. His desk was littered with photos and reports, carefully organized by himself and his guests, Carl and James, or whatever their real names were.\n\nDearborn leaned over the desk, leering at the central photo of Trujillo, the tyrant's face circled in red. "We've got him. It's taken decades, but he's finally right where we want him," his eyes traced over the documents. "His house of cards is falling apart; the church is tired of the killings; businessmen are sick of his kleptocratic family stealing from them; the kids around the country are spoiling for a fight with him, and even the middle class can't stand the economy stagnating anymore. They'll dance in the street once he's gone but need a push."\n\nThe two FBI special agents glanced at one another and nodded, and then James spoke, "Understood, sir, we'll send word back to Washington and continue preparing the groundwork. Trujillo won't know what hit him.""

USA_Trujillo_Conspiracy.5.desc: ""So, what do you think of the plan, Imbert?" As Antonio de la Maza and co-conspirator Tony Imbert get near Wimpy's supermarket, the former struck up a conversation.\n\n"Has to work, simple as that." Imbert refused eye contact, and kept his composure as he looked outside the truck window for any SIM agents.\n\n"Not one for talking, huh, comrade? That's fine, we are here anyway-" Antonio looked at the man in front of the disguised shipment. "Why isn't he just bringing them over? Look Imbert, seems like Carl is waving us over."\n\nThe two get out, greeting their FBI contact. "Listen, you two. I can't hand over these rifles without a promise. You must hold off the assassination until ATHENS is ready, orders from up high."\n\n"Shouldn't the Dominicans be the ones to decide when and where to topple their own tyrants?" snarled de la Maza in response. His eagerness got the better of him, before Tony interrupted.\n\n"Antonio, don't be naive. The Yanquis are the only reason we have made it this far, is now really the time to stop cooperating?" He turns to the special agent."

USA_Trujillo_Conspiracy.6.desc: "James checked through the keyhole before unbolting the door, keeping it slightly ajar as he looked onto the oncoming street. He crept onto the porch. This was one of Dearborn's safehouses, intermittently hosting various dissidents and on-the-runs. The Consul's current guest was a man by the name of Gualberto, who had landed with the Cubans on June 14th, 1959 at La Vega and had been in hiding ever since. Gualberto himself peeked from the barred windows of the first floor window before quickly disappearing into darkness.\n\nThen James heard a car backfiring as a black Volkswagen sped up the alley with a terrific screech. He knew very well who was about to visit.\n\n"Put your hands up! You are under arrest!"\n\nHe could've reached for the M14 hidden down one of the hollow floorboards, but in the time it would take to prime the rifle the secret police would've already riddled him with bullets. The SIM had got him. They would take him to one of their blacksites, torture him, he had heard stories, of mutilation, electrocution, even castration -\n\nThen he swore he heard the car backfire again, even though it was stationary, only realising it was gunfire when the Volkswagen, startled, sped off out of sight. Two plainclothes men emerged from a break in the fence. "We're with the DFS," one said, "Washington isn't the only party trying to bring down Trujillo."\n\nJames took a breather. "How can I trust you?"\n\n"Either you and Señor Gualberto come with us, or you can try and politely explain yourself to the SIM when they come back armed to the teeth and out for Yanqui blood.""

A complicit aide-to-camp is constantly monitoring Trujillo's movements and I have also been informed they have sufficient stock of supplies and munitions.\n\n(2) The dissident movement has many sympathisers among high-ranking elements of the military and the Dominican Party, namely military chief General Pupo Román. Others in the state apparatus will be eager to seize power in the wake of Trujillo's assassination.\n\n(3) Assuming the Caribbean Legion can secure a beachhead at Puerto Plata, I can confidently state the regime will fall, likely in an ensuing power struggle between the opposing personalities of secret police chief Johnny Abbes, Ramfis Trujillo, and nominal president Joaquín Balaguer.\n\n\n\nOperation ATHENS will commence upon the assent of the President."

USA_Trujillo_Conspiracy.8.t: "Ever Faithful"
USA_Trujillo_Conspiracy.8.desc: "Glasses of champagnes clinked under the sound of low, mumbling conversation. Generalissimo Trujillo, sitting at the dais in a chic seersucker suit, surveyed the ranks of the regime - though his gaze lingered on one man in particular. The guest of honour. He rose suddenly and beckoned for silence, and at once the insignificant chatter of the evening died off and gave way to a steely silence.\n\n"The Dominican Republic is always proud to welcome Señor Gittleman." Trujillo held his glass in a vice grip, his eyes trailing back over to the older man among the tables; bespectacled, even hunched, the signs of a once intimidating physique that had softened over three decades. "Simon," the Goat continued, "trained me to be the man who cast out the Haitians, struck off anarchy and poverty, steering this nation through crisis after crisis, unfettered." It sounded more like an ode to himself than a toast to the former U.S. Marine, his instructor; once vulgar, tough, but now the sort of man to be mildly embarrassed by the mention of violence.\n\nTrujillo smiled in a wry sort of way. "And this proud nation has had its share of external threats." He imagined that bastard Betancourt charred and burned in his hollowed-out Packard. Gittleman nodded, going scarlet in the face.\n\n"Simon is a friend of us all. We dearly appreciate his work in Washington on behalf of our government, helping to explain to our American friends that their threats are mistaken and misjudged. Not that they would amount to anything." Polite laughter from the audience."

USA_Trujillo_Conspiracy.9.t: "Forged by Fire"
USA_Trujillo_Conspiracy.9.desc: "Seeing an American jet flying over Ciudad Trujillo filled Wimpy with nostalgia. A part of him said he should have been up there, taking the fight to Trujillo from the sky and supporting the people like he did in Siberia. However, he also remembered his job back then was to deliver equipment, and the sight of jets could only mean that thousands of men and boys were waiting on a beach for him.\n\nWith a sense of urgency and determination, Wimpy and Flérida loaded their delivery truck with as much ammunition, guns, and grenades as it could carry. This build-up had been laborious, spanning months and involving the FBI's assistance.\n\nBut now it was over, and Wimpy began the short process of dowsing their supermarket with gasoline. As they stood in its parking lot, surveying the result of their years of toil, a mix of pride and sorrow filled their hearts.\n\nWhen they opened Supermercado Wimpys, it had been the first of its kind in the Dominican Republic. Wimpys, an American-style supermarket, had been more than a grocery store. It was a social hub, a favorite of Juan Domingo Peron, and the first fully air-conditioned commercial building in the Republic. But as Flérida struck a match and set the gasoline ablaze, their symbol of success and resilience was reduced to ashes, to memories and a sense of profound loss.\n\nNeither of them looked back on it as they drove off. What the future would hold for them after this was uncertain, especially after burning away their livelihood..."

The Goat had been a mad dog for a long time, and his end was coming whether the United States was behind it or not. However, he suspected, and not just because of the generous glasses of wine given to him, that America and General Román's new government would get along much better.\n\n"We still have some clean-up duty to attend to," the General began before taking another sip of his drink. "There are plenty of SIM thugs and desperate loyalists clinging on to some hope that things will turn around for them, but it matters little at this point; the fight is going out of them. In a matter of weeks, maybe even days, the Trujillista will be finished for good."\n\n"Good riddance. And you can rest assured the United States will spare no expense to help in securing the situation and limiting any more violence. Speaking of which..." The Consul stood up from his seat, setting his glass on a table. "I'll go help that aid hurry along. Thank you for your time, General."\n\nRomán smiled warmly and shook Dearborn's hand as they approached the Palace entrance. "My pleasure; I hope to hear from you again soon, Consul Dearborn.""

Ciudad Trujillo was quiet. Too quiet. Dearborn reached for his glass of bourbon and downed the lot, hoping to steel himself.\n\nHad the General given the plot up? Gotten cold feet?\n\nThe National Palace, which he could just about make out from the Consulate building, had its red and blue flag hanging at half-mast. There was no sign of anyone - or anything - coming in or out.\n\nDearborn heard the screech of a braking truck from down below, incomprehensible shouting, and the sound of boots clamping on the ground. They had got him. They had got him! That coward!\n\nHe bumbled over to the telex machine and began striking keys that chimed and rang amidst the sound of knocking and marching.\n\nDEAR PRESIDENT NIXON STOP TRUJILLO DEAD STOP OVERTHROW UNSUCCESSFUL STOP PUPO MISSING STOP ARMY AT EMBASSY STOP PREPARE FOR TROUBLE STOP"

Months of effort, up in flames, and Trujillo, the little bastard, seemed to have only gotten stronger for it. The rebels were either scattered, dead, or worse, in the hands of the Trujillista army and its torturers.\n\nThe only thing that could be done now was to get out as many people as possible, but there just weren't enough bodies to go around now. James was dead, Esteban was missing, probably captured, and Carl was in even worse shape than he was. The young man looked half-dead, exhausted from five cross-country trips.\n\n"I wish I could do more for you." He began slowly, his voice barely audible over the music. "But I need you out there again. These people were counting on us, Carl, and now that we fucked up, their lives are in our hands. Your hands." The young agent was silent for a moment, and Dearborn was afraid he had passed on, but then he solemnly nodded and stood up on shaky legs before heading out again."
