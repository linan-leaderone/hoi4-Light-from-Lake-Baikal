 TER_SAF_CW.1.t: "Wir Lagen von Kapstadt"
 TER_SAF_CW.1.desc: "The naval component of the Afrikan Reichskommissariat, and now of the Reichsstaat, was never given too much attention by anyone. With the American fleet having blocked any action on its part throughout the entirety of the South African War, it had gained little of status or glory in the eyes of Hans Hüttig. Even after that it proved too small to have a major contribution in helping the beleaguered SS to combat the endless numbers of uprisings that assailed it. Worst of all: It was falling apart at the seams.\n\nIt had been years since the last shipment of spare parts from the Heimat, and the ships of the Afrikaner Kriegsmarine, already old in 1962, were beginning to malfunction. Boiler breakdowns, broken hydraulic systems on turrets, and leaks had long been a problem, and the inadequate dockyards of Kongo and Mozambique were not helping the situation, either. Germany had never invested into these ports with the intention of making them into self-sufficient naval bases, and the consequences of that were now beginning to show. The atrophied machinery of the steel behemoths which once guarded Deutsch-Afrika desperately needed maintenance, and there was only one place in the continent were it could get it.\n\nFor Wilhelm Dommes, it was ironic that the last refuge of the fleet would be Cape Town. For the two decades, while his career had stagnated in Ostafrika, he and Rolf Mutzenberg spent many a general staff meeting planning the glorious day in which the Kriegsmarine would take the largest port south of Suez. Now, he led the decrepit remains of an outlaw fleet into indefinite mothballitude.\n\nLooking out from the bridge of his flagship, Dommes saw Daressalam fade away into the distance. He would have taken the opportunity to desert, he'd worked with the Japanese during the war... still on friendly terms with some of their admirals... but there wasn't enough fuel. For now, all that remained was to reach Simonstown Naval base scavenge whatever the OFN had left behind and hadn't been destroyed during the reconquest of the Vasallenstaat."
 TER_SAF_CW.1.a: "He would return home, someday."

 TER_SAF_CW.2.t: "The End of Oberkommando Südafrika"
 TER_SAF_CW.2.desc: "Karl Chmielewski looked at the bodies of the two SS officers, or what was left of them, anyway. He scoffed. [GRO.GetLeader] had sent them after him, no doubt. The fools had blown themselves to pieces trying to plant a bomb in his Upington headquarters.\n\nAlthough the would-be assassins had failed, it had been a close call. Chmielewski could barely stand on his feet. "Make it clear to that traitor that I am coming after him!" Chmielewski shouted his assistant away as he spat on the remains of those who had tried to kill him.\n\nChmielewski limped his wounded body out of the detonated war room, to the door of the headquarters building. While his vision was blurry, he could see the panicked movement of his soldiers, running around like headless chickens. The deafening sound of the alert siren was causing his ear to bleed. Chmielewski was falling unconscious when his aide de camp returned, alongside two officers dressed in Kriegsmarine dark blue.\n\n"Gruppenführer Chmielewski!" One of the two Kriegsmarine officers saluted with the traditional extension of his right arm. "I have orders from Konteradmiral Dommes indicating that all forces of Oberkommando Südafrika must evacuate to Kapstadt immediately, they must be countersigned at once."\n\nChmielewski used his remaining energy in an attempt to stand up, but ultimately failed. His back slid back against the concrete construction of the headquarters while he turned his face to the naval officers. "To Kapstadt? There shall be n... no such retreat, we are marching on Léopoldville!" A sharp pain struck the Kolonialverwalter's back as he finally aborted his attempts to stand up.\n\n"I am afraid to tell you then that I must follow my orders." The second Kriegsmarine officer barked dispassionately as he unfolded his Luger. Chmielewski had only managed to understand what was happening when two bullets ripped through his cranium and ended his life."
 TER_SAF_CW.2.a: "In the chaos of the evacuation, no one seems to have noticed."

 TER_SAF_CW.3.t: "The Last Redoubt"
 TER_SAF_CW.3.desc: "Wilhelm Dommes had been preparing for this day. Like any sensible man, he understood that the Reichsstaat was a doomed entity and that sooner or later, it would end. Sure, he had not expected it to be so sudden, or accounted for the catalyst that [GRO.GetLeader]'s clique proved to be, but he was more ready than anyone else to face it.\n\n"You may fire when ready." Dommes gave a look at the subaltern gunnery officer, who in turn transmitted the orders through the Doktor Goebbels' intercom system. It took a minute before the 260mm guns of the cruiser roared into action, spewing out their shells into Kapstadt's slums. The other ships moored at Simonstown, as well as those in Robben Island followed shortly thereafter, even the repurposed hulk of the HMS Rodney joined in. Dommes dreaded the act of having to do this, he'd seen enough killing in his lifetime, but he could not afford to lose Kapstadt, or else his plan to return home would be ruined.\n\nIt took thirty minutes of shelling until the ground forces reported that the ANC rebels had surrendered. Dommes was lucky insofar as the uprising was spontaneous, he'd feared that it would have taken leveling the entire city in order to maintain control. Dommes' day would only get better from there: Soon enough he was getting reports stating the majority of the old Oberkommando's forces had obeyed the order to withdraw to Kapstadt, it looked as if his plan was going to succeed.\n\nRolf Mutzenberg, who, as commander of Zentralafrika's naval detachment, had once outranked him, went to visit him later in the evening. Mutzenberg had many things to be grateful for, chief amongst them being Dommes' success in preventing his being purged by the late Statthalter Hüttig. Next to him, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, recently freed from the brig, was similarly predisposed to cooperate with Dommes.\n\n"Gentlemen, with Kapstadt secure, it is time for the next step of our plan to escape this damned continent:""
 TER_SAF_CW.3.a: ""Convincing the Japanese we are worth rescuing.""

 TER_SAF_CW.4.t: "The Durban Soviet"
 TER_SAF_CW.4.desc: "Chris Hani stood atop the burnt remains of a Kübelwagen in downtown Durban. All around him he could see only the hysterical crowds of fellow Africans, free from the colonizer's oppression at last. Amidst the intermittent shots of celebration fired into the air by the African National Congress militiamen, the recently enthroned chairman Hani shouted into his plastic megaphone, each word of substance receiving thunderous cheering in response, regardless of its meaning:"Comrades... We... Are Free." The chairman once more had to wait fifteen seconds for the crowd to calm down before resuming his speech. "We have triumphed over the forces of both bourgeois and barbaric German oppression..." Again, the assembled multitude's excitement proved too much for him to continue. "... While the mistakes of the comrades which led the previous attempts at National Liberation were severe, and the attempts by the fifth columnists of the so-called Inkatha Freedom Party did irreparable damage to our cause, the triumph of the African proletariat was nonetheless..." another deafening roar from his supporters forced Hani to wait before resuming his speech. "... the triumph of the African proletariat was nonetheless inevitable. Now, with reference to those who would have our revolution turned into a purely fanatical machine of revenge, I say, that I understand them. Nevertheless, it is foolish, and if they attempt to do so, I will impose the full force of my authority as chairman."\n\nHani had given up on finishing the rest of the speech, the sheer joy of the liberated crowd was too overwhelming. While he was no less pleased about the final end to German oppression, and gladly raised his fist accordingly, his mind couldn't stop wondering into what was yet to be done. In particular, Madikizela's splitters in the west worried him enough to spoil the entire occasion: If the ANC was divided now that the final struggle against DeBeer's naked capitalism had arrived, it could prove fatal."
 TER_SAF_CW.4.a: "Nonetheless, Africa would triumph."

 TER_SAF_CW.5.t: "Persistence Hunting"
 TER_SAF_CW.5.desc: "Understanding the signs of nature, recognizing the marks every creature leaves on the environment, and following those clues left by the careless are the skills that bring a hunter to his prey. No sign could be as glaring as the trucks heading south, and in Africa, there was no hunter such as Mateus Matoka. Being pressed into Reichskommissar Schenck's SS, his Khoisan people performed gallantly in the war, when their outdoors skills and knowledge of the land made them capable of ambushing even the most talented American units. Yet none of that mattered to Hans Hüttig, who saw them as nothing more than pests to be exterminated.\n\nBut Hüttig didn't know why the Khoisan managed to survive this long: They understand that Man is a weak animal. Mankind will never be as strong as a lion or as fast as a leopard, but no other animal has the will of humans. We rely on our persistence to endure in the wildness, and Matoka's people persisted in the bush like a cleaver prey evades their predator.\n\nNow it's time for Africa's oldest people to go out on the hunt again, waiting in silence for days until their prey walk right into the set trap. Their much sought after prize would be a convoy heading to the Cape carrying on the back of the trucks deadly artillery shells filled with nerve gases and protected only by tired and afraid guards praying they evacuate safely.\n\nThe convoy escort didn't put much resistance, being cut down like an exhausted Kudu after a long chase. Mined roads and ambushes cut the reinforcements, and soon the weapons shipment was taken under control. It is said that the best hunter is the one that has a family depending on him: Mateus Matoka's men have a whole civilization depending on them.\n\nThankfully for them, the Germans had finally repaid their debt to the Khoi, in the form of all the instruments of war which lay scattered across Upington's abandoned headquarters."
 TER_SAF_CW.5.a: "Replacing their spears with deadly gas."

 TER_SAF_CW.6.t: "The Reign of Terror"
 TER_SAF_CW.6.desc: "Winnie Madikizela hadn't wanted things to go this far, and yet they had. Why did they not recognize her? The leadership of the ANC should have gone to no one else but to her! She, who had kept the organization alive in the Eastern Cape, who had prepared its legions in preparation for the Rising, and she, who had been passed over so another dreadful ideologue could take the position. Well, she wouldn't take it, in fact, she couldn't: They would not let her.\n\nThe Madikizela United Foot Ball Club, an innocuous name for the monstrosity she had let flourish under her watch, now consumed its progenitor. While it had always proved troublesome, the club's activities in racketeering, human trafficking, extortion, and kidnapping started growing out of control only after the Second War. Winnie had done nothing to stop them, she saw no point in it, the ANC needed its enforcers. When Mugabe's men from across the border offered their help to the organization, it seemed only natural. By the time the Germans desperately retreated southwards, the organization was unrecognizable, and as Madikizela now found out, uncontrollable.\n\nShe tried desperately to plead with her lieutenants, and yet they wouldn't listen, she was their stalking horse for control of the ANC, and they were Mugabe's. All her efforts to maintain regimented control over the Cape had been successful, yet had turned her into a puppet of those same men she had entrusted with carrying it out.\n\nFrom outside the walls of her gilded cage, Madikizela can hear the screams of those who suffer under the consequences of her actions: The innocent men and women, black and white, adults and children. While all lay dead under the deranged version of Mugabified nationalism which few of the perpetrators have any understanding of."
 TER_SAF_CW.6.a: "Just another warlordress."

 TER_SAF_CW.7.t: "Heirs of Hüttig"
 TER_SAF_CW.7.desc: "The cratered landscape of Ventersdorp showed symptoms of the three wars which had ravaged it in less than a decade: The imprint of tank tracks upon the torn-up pavement, the vegetation uprooted by shells, the vast fields made fallow by chemical weapons, and, most obviously, on the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging rally at its central plaza.\n\nAfter a decade of permanent war, there were few Boers left, so few that those which remained became scared enough to support the demented movement of a former policeman few could have recognized in 1962. Eugène Terre'Blanche had predicted demographic apocalypse for his people for years, and now that it had come true, there was no one else to lead them out of it. Surely, some race-traitors joined in with that Jew, Oppenheimer, others with the weak, degenerate cowards in Simonstown, but the true Boers had flocked to him. As Terre'Blanche prepared to give his speech, he looked besides him: Standing atop the same Leopard tank as him was Adam Grünewald, who had chosen to join the true heirs of the Reichsstaat, alongside the rest of his SS Panzerdivision.\n\nWhile he raged against the race traitors, the Americans, the ANC, and all others who dared oppose him, Terre'Blanche didn't miss the opportunity to reference the piled up bodies of ANC sympathizers liquidated by the new Boer Liberation Army. When Terre'Blanche finished his speech and made way for Robert van Tonder's turn at the microphone, he took a big breath. Remembering the hectic days of the First South African War, he shook his head: He'd trusted the Afrikaner Volkstaat, that was a mistake. Hüttig was right, only a pure Africa would do, and he was determined to succeed where he had failed, even if only in this little corner of the continent."
 TER_SAF_CW.7.a: "The Afrikaner's last chance."
