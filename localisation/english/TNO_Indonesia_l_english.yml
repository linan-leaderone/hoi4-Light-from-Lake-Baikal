 ##Leader Descs##
 POLITICS_SUKARNO_DESC:0 "The father of the Indonesian nation, and the leader in its struggle for Independence: all this, and more, can be used to characterize Sukarno, the President of the Indonesian Republic. While the reality, as often, is slightly more complicated, such a description is however not that far from the truth.\n\nWhile dealings with the Japanese were needed to safeguard the young nation's independence, a quick glance at it today will show that the benefits have far outweighed the costs: Sukarno stands as the President of a proud and rapidly-rising nation, who could in a few years rival the world's largest powers in terms of economic might, a task as daring as it seems daunting.\n\nYears have passed, however, and the Equatorial Emerald's President faces rumblings of discontent. Centralization from Java, its most prosperous island, is not unanimously popular, and the Indonesian army becomes more and more of a breeding ground for polarization and radicalism. Sukarno is not afraid in the least, for he knows the masses' respect and adoration towards him.\n\nWith the mandate of its people, and the strength of its President, Indonesia shall soar to new heights, and never again shall it be enslaved."

 INS_Djuanda_Kartawidjaja_hog_desc: "§YPrime Minister\nAuthoritarian Developmentalism§!\n--------------\n§LIn a seemingly endless divide between the "administrators" and "solidarity-makers" in Indonesian politics, President Sukarno had deemed it appropriate to bridge the gap by appointing a cabinet for national peace. The man chosen to lead this eclectic mix of national heroes would be none other than technocrat Djuanda Kartawidjaja, a Sundanese civil engineer who benefited under the late Dutch "Ethical Policy" schools. Graduating from the Technische Hoogeschool de Bandoeng, Djuanda quickly became involved in the struggle for independence, and came to be known as a reliable workhorse in the nation's cabinets post-1949.\n\nHowever, his seemingly boundless energy seems to be coming at an end. Following the chaos of the Sidik, Natsir and Manai years, Djuanda was appointed by Sukarno following Hatta and Sjahrir's advice - primarily to centralise Japanese-built railways and rationalising the patchwork economy left behind by the Dutch and neglected by Japan's wartime needs. Djuanda has spent the last year exhausting the cabinet's capabilities alongside fellow technocrats Johannes Leimena and Roosseno, leaving diplomacy in a status quo with Japan.\n\nThe effort has bore fruit, as Djuanda has laid out the Eight-Years Development Plan. Taking advantage of the chaos in Indochina and the Philippines, Djuanda's cabinet has built the base for Indonesia to become Japan's prime outsourcing location for heavy industry in Southeast Asia. The future looks bright, but Djuanda's health does not. Only time will tell if he will live to see the full fruits of his labour, and that time is fading fast.§!"
 INS_Johannes_Leimena_hog_desc: "§YPrime Minister\nChristian Democracy§!\n--------------\n§LJohannes Leimena - or J. Leimena. A serious looking man, Leimena was born in 1905 to two teachers inside the city of Ambon. Unlike the rest of his siblings, Leimena did not move in with his stepfather, after his own father died when he was five, and lived with his uncle's family. It was in youth did Leimena see the struggles of life and family, when he grew up during the strife in the 1920's and the growing resentment that the Indonesian people had against their Dutch overlords.\n\nGraduating from the STOVIA medical school, Leimena toiled in various hospitals throughout the nation in Djakarta and Bandung. When the Japanese came - and proved that they were here to stay - Leimena had become the Director of the hospitals in Purwakarta and Tangerang. Leimena, perhaps due to his vehement Christian upbringing, developed a fiercely anti-Communist atittude against those who he thought would persecute and destroy those who believed. Yet, in contrast, Leimena rejects the creed of their masters that occupy the Indonesian Archipelago as being "for their own good".\n\nWhat about the suffering that they've brought upon is good? The hunger? The poverty? The death? The only way that they could ever deliver any sort of gift upon Indonesia is letting go and creating an Indonesian state, ruled by Indonesians. It's this passion that has driven Leimena ever so near to the top, as Sukarno's top foreign minister. But it's this journey that has imparted upon the now aged soul some valuable lessons. Japan is a plague, but it is a plague that can be weaponised. If their millions and their foreign advisors come to our shores, maybe they can build up sorely-needed services such as healthcare and education, especially for those in the outer core of the country. An opportunity like this is not promised so easily by the other powers.§!"

 INS_Ruslan_Abdulgani_for_desc: "§YMinister of Foreign Affairs\nRevolutionary Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§L§!"

 INS_Roosseno_Surjohadikusumo_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Economy\nCorporatism§!\n--------------\n§LSukarno's coalition is long, wide-ranging and packed with figures and individuals who, in another world, could have been the arbiters of Indonesia's Destiny, in their own right. One of the most striking of these people is Roosseno - born Roosseno Soerjohadikoesoemo. A member of Hazairin's Technocratic faction, Rooosseno is a fervent firebrand that Indonesia must be ruled by those who know best, in order to uplift its most vulnerable and its most abused into a state of dignity and peace.\n\nAlongside the Technocrats, Rooseno flirts with the Corporatists inside Sukarno's Indonesia, who demand that the country should be reorganised in order to destroy the possibility of class conflict and even the remote chance that Communists would seize on the disorder and attempt a general uprising against the government. Roosseno is an engineer. Like any good engineer, his job is to find out what is wrong with the country, find the easiest and most efficient way to fix said problem and make sure that it never happens again. In his case? The scourge of foreign domination, both from Washington and Tokyo alike, creeps across the Archipelago threatening what sovereignty they have under the Japanese yoke.\n\nIndonesia is a project - just like any other. The foundations have already been built for it to become a truly glorious nation. All that's needed is for a strong, guiding hand to finish it to the end.§!"
 INS_Jusuf_Wibisono_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Economy\nIslamic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§L§!"

 INS_Bambang_Supeno_sec_desc: "§YMinister of Defense\nDespotism§!\n--------------\n§LA distant relative of Sukarno himself, Bambang Supeno has always led a physical life. When his father died at 13, and he was raised by a single mother, Supeno threw himself whole-heartedly into the world of cricket, football, martial arts and scouting. A charismatic leader even then, when the Japanese first landed on Indonesian shores and ousted the Dutch colonisers, Supeno was elected as his high school's student leader inside the Student Council.\n\nIt was only natural that he came to lead men, much like himself. Joining the Pembela Tanah Air - or the Voluntary Defenders of the Homeland - a Japanese-organised and ran paramilitary force designed to assist the IJA in fighting off what remains of resistance still lay inside the Archipelago, it was here that Bambang Supeno tasted War for the first time. Dirty, blood and grime-encrusted and terrible, Supeno understood that in warfare, you can use the most high-tech weapons and bombs - they mean nothing if the men holding it don't know their place in the annals of History.\n\nIt was the fighting during both the awesome clash that was the Second World War and the National Revolution that convinced Bambang Supeno of a simple idea. Why shouldn't the military have more of a say in politics? Why condemn those who gave all they had in service of the Motherland, just because it doesn't conform to the rule of a few, pampered bureaucrats. Thousands sacrificed themselves in the most brutal war ever waged in these islands - their comrades should at least decide how they're remembered.§!"

 ##Military Leader Descs##
 #########################
 FIELD_MARSHAL_SUHARTO:0 "Commander Suharto of the Indonesian Army is the second most powerful and third most influential man in the entire country. Quickly rising through the ranks during the National Revolution, Suharto became an integral part of the military and constructed a minor powerbase around himself. Filled with ambition, he makes every attempt to advise President Sukarno, much to the chagrin of Vice President Hatta, who opposes him at every turn. Where exactly Suharto's ambition will take him is anyone's guess, but everyone expects, or fears, that he will do whatever it takes to get there."
 FIELD_MARSHAL_ABDUL_HARIS_NASUTION:0 "Commander Abdul Haris Nasution is feared for his brutality among the rebel forces of Indonesia and even his own troops, and rightfully so. The terror he inflicts is that of a man who has a greater purpose for which he can do no wrong in service of. Everything he does is for Indonesia. Every village set aflame. Every rebel executed. Every order issued. All of it for Indonesia."
 GENERAL_LB_MOERDANI:0 "General Leonardus Benjamin Murdani's military career was jump-started by his service in a Student Army during the National Revolution. He rose to prominence and fame, though not necessarily the good kind, due to his strong, outspoken political stances and religion. Being a Catholic in a majority Muslim country, he is the subject of a great deal of suspicion, though his loyalty to Indonesia and Sukarno has never been openly called into question."

 INS_IKKC: "IKKC"
 INS_IKKC_desc: "Following the end of the Great East Asian War, the system of wartime conscription of Indonesian labor was ended - officially. In reality, the creation of the Indonesia Keizai Kaihatsucho - the IKKC, or Indonesia Economic Development Authority - formalized the arrangement whereby Indonesian labor would be 'reimbursed' for their employment by Japanese companies for the development of the Indonesian nation.\n\nIn practice, the reimbursement is a laughable pittance, and it increasingly seems that the fruits of development accumulate entirely to the IKKC and its owners. The more things change, it seems, the more they stay the same."
 INS_Dwitungal: "Dwitungal"
 INS_Dwitungal_desc: ""Signed, on the behalf of the Indonesian people, Sukarno and Hatta."\n\nThese words mark the end of the Proclamation of Independence: a short, general statement believed throughout all rungs of Indonesian society. The character and will of millions of Indonesians are represented by two men, the Dwitunggal - the Duumvirate of President Sukarno and his Vice-President Mohammad Hatta. The fiery rural messiah Sukarno, tempered by the cool, cosmopolitan intellectual Hatta forms a duo of leaders, toiling for Indonesia's sake. A bond, sturdy and unbreakable that the ages cannot wear.\n\n§VYet.§!"
 INS_Eight_Years_Development_Plan: "Eight Years Development Plan"
 INS_Eight_Years_Development_Plan_desc: "A government's goal should be to foster a future generation to take over a developing country, with foundations for them to build upon, its civil apparatus the vanguards of development and construction. Thus goes the beliefs of one Djuanda Kartawidjaja, the brave technocrat who now leads the most stable and lasting cabinets in Indonesia.\n\nScale. Authenticity. Acceleration. These are the tenets of Djuanda's new Eight Years Plan, or more officially the Universal Development Scheme. State-led heavy industrial expansion and infrastructure megaprojects, mighty dams and incredible roads, were all included in this ambitious plan - financed by Japan, of course. As the plan enters its second year, many question whether or not this plan would succeed."
 INS_The_Banteng_And_The_White_Crescent: "The Banteng and the White Crescent"
 INS_The_Banteng_And_The_White_Crescent_desc: "While propaganda may state the contrary, Japan's primary legacy in Indonesia is not giving the nation independence, but the de facto two-party system created by it. The abnormality was not concocted out of kindness, but for stability, a desire to keep the Supreme Islamic Council Alive and to build a positive relationship between Sukarno and Hatta.\n\nDominated by the PNI and PRM, its staying power has proven it to be almost unbreakable despite how it satisfies few on the frontlines of Indonesian politics. It is instead considered a scar of Japan's colonialism, a lasting memento of the men who stepped onto their shores."
 INS_A_Nation_Of_18000_Islands: "A Nation of 18,000 Islands"
 INS_A_Nation_Of_18000_Islands_desc: "The concept of Indonesia has been a fluid idea since its conception in the early 20th century. The romantic intellectuals and idealists of the early nation discussed at length on whether Indonesia should be a part of a Melayu Raya, a concept by itself, or various other iterations designed to give an ethnically, religiously and linguistically diverse region who have never been a single entity in its totality.\n\nThe arrival of Japan and its stoking of Indonesian nationalism to ease the burdens of occupation has however, solidified the concept of Indonesia as a monolithic entity - an unitary state under a single constitution, and in its initial conception, a single national Staatspartij, bound by a civic nationalism based on the shared experiences of all who lived under the burden and subjugation of Dutch colonial rule.\n\nSince the granting of independence in 1949, the young nation has sought to overcome these contradictory ideals of such a monolithic system enforced on a diverse populace. The occupying Japanese have concentrated the nation's administrative and economic expansion primarily on the central island of Java. While this has brought bloody dividends through the presence of Japanese corporations and extraction, many chafe at the inflexibility and totality of the Japanese-enforced system, seeing it as a betrayal of what the nation's founders conceived of merely fifty years ago - and sooner or later, one must give way to the other."
 INS_Three_Militaries_One_Destiny: "Three Militaries, One Destiny"
 INS_Three_Militaries_One_Destiny_desc: "The Indonesian Armed Forces staggers along in spite and not because of the Frankensteinian merger that birthed it into reality. Its histories are varied, being made up of differing doctrinal commands, military structures, and officer corps.\n\nThe three former armies now belonging to it are the KNIL, the old Dutch colonial force, and PETA and the Giyugun, Japanese-established volunteer armies from Java and Sumatra respectively. Now joined at the hip by a shared destiny, they fight for their new tomorrow, an Indonesia in the sun."
 INS_The_Year_of_Living_Dangerously: "The Year of Living Dangerously"
 INS_The_Year_of_Living_Dangerously_desc: "It is time that Indonesia shows itself to the world that it is a nation of unbreakable will and fortitude. It is time that we mobilise our forces - not just in body and numbers, but in spirit - against the rebels that would spill such indecencies on our Motherland. Everyone, including the youth, will do their part for the nation. Disregard those who would decry us 'letting loose bands of armed, young men' in Indonesia, we will triumph."
 INS_On_Land_Sea_and_Air: "On Land, Sea, and Air"
 INS_On_Land_Sea_and_Air_desc: "Having secured the loyalty of the Navy, the KKO Marines, the Air Force, and the Army Strategic Reserve (KOSTRAD), Sukarno now has loyal men on land, in the sea, and in the air. Regardless of how committed to and willing to die for the cause they may be, more and more fronts are opening by the day, leaving what professional troops are available to Sukarno spread increasingly thin."
 INS_Tokyos_Lifeline: "Tokyo's Lifeline"
 INS_Tokyos_Lifeline_desc: "In times of War and Strife, the pretensions of standards must also fold in the face of overwhelming danger. Despite all of Sukarno's efforts to nationalise valuable Japanese corporations and subsidies that supply the Home Islands with resources, every other candidate is too opposed to Tokyo's rule to back in any manner whatsoever. Due to this unfortunate circumstance, Japan's favoured candidate is a man who they hate - but must also prop up."

 indonesia.100.desc:0 "Sukarno wasn't quite sure what decision had led him to be overlooking an angry mob from atop his balcony, there must've been some point where Sukarno had gotten off track, and continued to fumble his decisions. He thought of what Hatta had said long ago, his resignation letter still in his breast pocket. "You have wandered into the forest of power and have lost your way." That was it huh? It all started when Sukarno overstepped his boundaries? Throughout the entire journey, he was afraid he wasn't going far enough, but yet here he was, watching from his office as his people took up arms against him.\n\nNasution and Suhartoharto had already assembled their armies and barked orders into radios as outposts across the archipelago hunkered down for a siege. He looked out into his burning city and felt like he should be coming to some grand realization, it felt like Sukarno should've learned something from it all, but no, Sukarno was more firm in his belief than ever. It was the politics of it all that had ripped him from his life of luxury, it was the ideology that would turn the streets red with blood. It was then Sukarno felt no more pity for Hatta, the man who had stolen everything from him. There was no more time for pity, only justice."

The captain spoke to the sergeant to his side, not breaking his gaze of the vast ocean.\n\n"During what, sir?"\n\n"When they bombed the hell outta this city," the 52 year old Captain Kenneth Green replied, still not breaking his sight of the sea off of Darwin, "I genuinely thought that they were gonna have troops following suit when I ducked for cover," Green continued. The gentle yet harrowing breeze of the wind accompanied the deafening silence between the two men.\n\n"Sir I'm sorry, again, we appreciate you volunteering on this mission, but if you-"\n\n"But if I what? Sergeant?" The captain broke his gaze from the sea, and his eyes met the sergeant's as he raised his voice with a deep Australian accent, "If I am too cowardly for this assignment? You yanks asked for a bloody volunteer, and this old wanker is what you get!" Green tried to calm himself down, failing, and continued his rant, "I will personally see to it that the bullets from these guns meet a fucking Japanese's head."\n\n"Please sir, calm down!" The sergeant's eyes darted around the empty docks, paranoid, "you're going to compromise the mission!" Green obliged, but he was still livid that the sergeant doubted his resolve.\n\n"I'm sorry, Green was it? I have my own reasons to make this trip." The captain stared off into the horizon once more.\n\nThe sergeant looked down, pensive, and walked away from the edge of the dock. Leaving the old man alone with the roaring sea."

  usindoflavor.2.t:0 "The Spirit of the Young"
  usindoflavor.2.d:0 "The wind had picked up from the day before. The waves of the sea could be seen roaring in the dimly lit dock, before daybreak. It was as if the buzzing of the gunshots and the pounding of artillery strikes rippled out into the ocean, reaching Darwin where they stood. The seven men were reminded of the bloodshed that is happening across the sea.\n\n"This, gentlemen, is where we'll spend seasick for the next three weeks or so." The sergeant half-jokingly presented the deck of the ship to his squad with his hands, assigned to guard the ship where the smuggled weapons were to be delivered to Indonesian rebels in Borneo.\n\n"Christ, I'm gonna get seasick aren't I?" Uttered Private Robert Stevens Doe to the group as he boarded the vessel.\n\n"Relax buddy, once you get used to it, you won't feel a thing!" Replied the man behind him, following suit.\n\n"Yeah, you won't feel a thing once you vomit your guts out," the man to his front mockingly said, resting his M1 carbine on one of the boxes on top of the deck. The group broke to small laughter, with even the sergeant himself letting out a chuckle. It made sense, Doe had never gone to active combat before, and imagining being seasick didn't make him feel any better.\n\n"Hey, private," called the sergeant to the frowning Doe, "Don't worry, it's just a routine assignment. Most of the ships that went arrived safe and sound on the other side, don't let the others get on your nerves." He tried to convince the private to calm down.\n\n"Most, sir?" He asked, "This isn't any usual mission. In the middle of the ocean, there is nowhere for us to run if things go awry."\n\n"Then we don't run, Private," the sergeant had calmed Doe down, "Remember your training, it will help you when you need it." It was odd, Doe thought, for a sergeant to be nice to him instead of the usual screams that he put up with during training. Well, this wasn't training, after all."

  usindoflavor.3.t:0 "The Tenth Day"
  usindoflavor.3.d:0 "The vessel had entered Indonesian waters a few days ago, but there was nothing to be seen anywhere except for the tiny, desolate land masses that made up the infamously complex 17,000 island nation. The night covered everything in a blanket of darkness, making staring off into the distance feel as if one was gazing upon the abyss on that moonless night.\n\n"Do you do trips like this often?" Doe asked the captain on the helm of the ship.\n\n"Well, no. Prolly been a year since I went out to sea. It's kind of refreshing really if you don't think of what the hell is happening on these islands." The captain frowned in disgust as he spoke that last sentence. Doe gestured his hands as he was about to ask another question.\n\n"Oh come on son, don't do me like that," the captain butted in, "every time you do that, it reminds me of my son."\n\n"Heh," Doe smirked, "You have a son, old man?" A few seconds of silence passed, and the old man replied, "Yes, yes I do. He's your age, maybe a little rougher around the edges. once you got to know 'em, y'all would be inseparable."\n\n"Where is he then, your son?" The private continued, noticing the captain's dreary expression.\n\n"Christ, stop busting my balls here kid I got a job to do." The captain was taken aback by the remark.\n\n"I'm sorry sir, didn't mean no harm," Doe replied apologetically.\n\n"Hey, look at those lights," Doe tried to avert the conversation, "what do you reckon is going on there? People hanging out, maybe getting drunk here or there, who knows? I mean..." The captain started to zone out Doe's rambling as he realized what it was."

  usindoflavor.4.t:0 "All is Fair"
  usindoflavor.4.d:0 ""Building materials, yes?" The commanding officer asked the captain with a heavy Japanese accent.\n\n"Yes of course sir, iron, concrete, everything is here." Captain Green gulped as he replied to the Japanese soldier, trying not to flinch.\n\n"And you realize you are in war seas?" The commander stared at him.\n\n"Uh, yeah sir... but," the captain's stoic form shriveled away with the cold night wind. He gloated about his bravery against the Japanese and how much he wanted to bring the fight to them, but being confronted with them unarmed made it all disappear. All there is left is fear.\n\n"And is this all of your crew, captain?" The Japanese commander moved on to the next question impatiently as his hands gestured to the crew of the ship. "Yes, all of the crew have been accounted for."\n\n"I... send... inspection... under..." The marines overheard the Japanese commander above from under the deck, M1 Carbines firmly in their grip. The group was silent, trying to not make any noise that could lead the soldiers to their hiding location, behind an array of shipping containers. Doe stared at the others, and then his rifle, somehow managing to collect himself and control his nerves. A footstep, another one, and another one, growing louder with each clank that the boots made with the metal floor.\n\n"I only count one pair of legs," whispered Doe, "I'm taking him out." His squad-mates didn't know whether it was bravery or stupidity, but it was too late, Doe had moved out of cover and pulled out his handgun.\n\nBANG. Thump.\n\n"DOE YOU FUCKING-" The sergeant's scream was cutoff by the sight of a horrified Japanese soldier standing up the flight of stairs, running down under the deck with an Arisaka Type-99 and aimed his sight.\n\nBANG. Thump.\n\n"Well," the commander upstairs commented on the noise..."

  usindoflavor.5.t:0 "What Remains"
  usindoflavor.5.d:0 "Evening light bathed the sleepy, nameless harbor in Papua as men worked around the clock to unload tons of clandestine war materiel destined for the frontlines. Although the daylight hours had been winding down to give way to night, the work facing the men at the docks had only just begun. In the center of it all, two men struggled to lift a crate decorated from top to bottom with markers warning of explosive contents within.\n\n"Alright, not much further now. Let's keep it steady, we drop this and it might just take the whole bloody harbor with us, yeah?" The first soldier, a young Australian, uttered between strained breaths.\n\nThe second, an Indonesian, nodded. He was too focused on the weight of the box to respond. Every step the duo took became more difficult than the last, but, eventually, they finally arrived at the box's next resting place: a dusty warehouse filled with similar such deliveries, where it would remain until being ferried off to its next destination. "Finally! That was the worst one so far, I think. What exactly is in there, anyway?"\n\n"A whole hell of a lot of artillery shells is my guess. Pretty soon they'll be out of here and raining down on the heads of those bastards you boys are fighting out there."\n\nThe Indonesian soldier smiled. "Not soon enough, I'd say. Who knows, you might get the chance to do some fighting yourself."\n\nThe Australian was quiet for a moment. "Wouldn't that be something? My dad spent years fighting out here, you know, first in the last war, and now this one as well. I'm sure he'd be proud to see me carrying on the fight; worried, too, knowing the old man..."\n\n"Well, regardless, I'm glad you're here to help, Private... um...""

  usindoflavor.6.d:0 "Makassar brewed with life; a life Thomas Martin was about to leave permanently. He still had an hour left within the city as the planes he had been booked in with the rest of his division still had a bit of maintenance to catch up on, but was it worth it to leave the airport? He already said his goodbyes; to the sweet elderly grandmother that managed his apartment block, the friends he had made in the local Sulawesi militia, and most of all, Indah.\n\nThomas decided to stay put. He wouldn't be able to find anyone at this hour, aside from Indah. He could feel the sadness in his heart just thinking about her. Instead, Thomas removed himself from his seat and found a place amongst Joe and Tyrone at a crowded table as they played a game of Texas hold 'em. Between the cards and the chit chat, he distracted himself well enough. For a minute.\n\nThomas was crushed after two games. He had bet two thirds of his chips on a straight, losing to another, slightly higher straight on the final round. Half of what was left was lost after the next round as he overplayed a three of a kind. From there, Thomas participated in a slow decline of folds until a single chip was all he had to his name. Frustrated, he threw the cards back down and made for his seat.\n\nHe couldn't just sit back down though. The exit called for him. Beyond those doors lay Makassar, Thomas' sweet old landlord, his militia friends, and Indah. The city had been his life for years, his only reprieve as his American and Free Indonesian comrades fought off Japanese and collaborator Indonesian assaults all over the island. He could recall all the streets in his neighbourhood, he could recall the best restaurants along the coastline of the city, even the store where he had first met Indah. How could he let that all go?\n\nThomas made his way to the exit. Packed as the airport waiting room was, he had no choice. This was his new life, and he would be damned if he left it."

  usindoflavor.7.t:0 "An American Patriot, Finding His True Calling"
  usindoflavor.7.d:0 "For most of his life, Edward Foster has been a proud, card-carrying Democrat. After all, the party had always served America well: even if her defeat at the hands of the Axis in the Second World War had been a regrettable stain on the party's legacy, he had still followed them, despite all the hardships. And even when they allied with the Republicans, Edward did not jump ship, and stayed faithfully by the side of the true party of American conservatism. However, things had been... different, recently. The RDC, while certainly harboring good intentions, seemed to be making mistake upon mistake lately, especially in regards to foreign policy: the crux of this being Indonesia, of course, and the saddening defeat of the American-backed rebels at the hands of Sukarno's dictatorial regime.\n\n"You know, I don't think the RDC intentionally kowtows to the Japs. However, what I do think and know for a fact is that their incompetence makes America look bad on the world stage; I mean, have you seen Indonesia? They mishandled that in the worst way possible, and you expect them to lead our country even somewhat decently?"\n\nThe man on the television had mostly seemed to be ranting until now, but those words caught Edward's attention. What was his name, again? Cromming, something like that... Ah, Crommelin, yes, John Crommelin. Despite being a Yockey, he had a few good points, Edward thought: his remarks on the total and utter incompetence on the part of the Republican-Democratic coalition weren't totally unfounded, far from it; in fact, it was probably the closest he had gotten to agreeing with a politician in a long time. Crommelin was saying things like they were, unlike the honeyed words of the Repblican-Democrats; and if Edward didn't agree with most of the Sovereigns' positions, he was beginning to think at, maybe, just maybe, they could guide America back to an honorable place on the world stage."
