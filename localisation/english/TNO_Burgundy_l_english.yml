 BRG_Heinrich_Himmler:0 "Heinrich Himmler"
 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC:0 "Heinrich Himmler has been a loyal member of the Nazi Party for decades, having even joined in the abortive Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. And much like the months following the Putsch, the Reich's failures have left Himmler embittered, disillusioned, and more devoted to his ideology than ever before.\n\nWhen the postwar euphoria wore off and the grand projects began to strain German industry, Himmler's faith wavered. When the economy collapsed and the government in Germania was powerless to save it, his faith faltered. And when the Russians nearly took back Moskowien, his faith shattered. This could not be a Jewish plot or Allied sabotage. Nobody stabbed the Reich in the back... except the Nazis themselves.\n\nHimmler became convinced that the Nazi Party had been corrupted and was rotting Germany from the inside out. It was Himmler's duty - no, his mandate - to save the Reich from itself. From Paris, to Germania, to the rapidly-disintegrating A-A line in the east, Waffen-SS units prepared to topple Hitler and right Germany's course. However, Speidel got wind of the plot and snuffed it in the cradle with Operation Backfire.\n\nWith word of Himmler's plan leaked, and dozens of divisions captured, it seemed as if the SS was doomed. Hitler, in a rare moment of lucidity, knew that killing Himmler would trigger a civil war, so he offered Himmler a fiefdom far away from Germania, one where he could stay out of Reich politics: SS-Ordensstaat Burgundy. Himmler reluctantly accepted, leaving control of the Deutsche-SS to his loyal lieutenant Reinhard Heydrich, and left for Nanzig. But Himmler has only grown more steadfast in his views, and he has not forgotten the injustice against him..."
 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC_1972:0 "Incompetence. Sabotage. Treason. From the very beginning Heinrich Himmler had been surrounded by those who wished nothing more than to see him fail, to see his grand vision for Burgundy collapse into dust, degeneracy, and anarchy.\n\nDespite this, Heinrich Himmler endures.\n\nThe state he has devoted his life to is little more than a hollowed out husk, one stripped of nature and color. One filled with concrete cemeteries of industry that lie dormant in the darkness of the blackout. One with a population in revolt, or living in abject terror.\n\nThe state he presides over is a mass grave, yet to Himmler it does not matter how many die. Thousands have died on his orders, and would condemn thousands more to see the dream of Burgundy realized - even as it collapses all around him. It does not matter that his authority is ignored. It does not matter that resistance grows stronger. It does not matter, because it cannot matter. The Shadow State may be a shambling corpse of a nation, awaiting its final breath, but he will hold onto the dream until the very end.\n\nBecause without Burgundy, he is nothing."
 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC_COLLAPSE:0 "It was never supposed to be this way.\n\nWho, ultimately, is responsible for the failure of the Ordensstaat? Not he, of course - not the Reichsführer! Subversive elements are everywhere, naturally, for that is the way of the Eternal Jew. But was he not careful enough? Twelve years of the Gestapo grinding down on the emaciated neck of France, and still the perfidious nation kept its secrets from them? Unlikely! No, it was higher up, closer to the top. The SS Legions were already suspect for their selfish, anti-German nationalism, but hadn't they all been checked, double-checked, checked again, and monitored for the entirety of their service? It had to be higher still!\n\nHeydrich, maybe? His failure after such an illustrious career was suspect. 'White Moses', they used to call him. He had always believed it to be a mere schoolboy taunt, but did the slur sprout from a seed of truth? Or perhaps he was an unwitting servant of the Jew, like Oswald Pohl? No, impossible - that didn't make any sense! What rational explanation could there be for this outcome?\n\nSo goes the delusional mind of Heinrich Himmler, running in circles and chasing shadows, even as his subordinates beg for orders and the crackle of gunfire grows ever closer."

#Unlock events

BRG_unlock.1.t:0 "The Plight of the Reich"
BRG_unlock.1.desc:0 "The Reich has, for decades, stood tall and proud over Europe, maintaining a strong pillar of order and security throughout the continent. And, most importantly to the Reich, they maintained the interests of the decadent fat cats in Germania who had corrupted the administration of the Führer. Even the Reichsführer-SS, entrusted with the administration of the Ordensstaat, found himself chained and restricted from carrying out the Aryan will by those who would corrupt the National Socialist ideal.\n\nYet now those decadent degenerates who played in the shadows of Germania begin to emerge into the light in an attempt to strike one another down. As a result, Germany stumbles and falters, as Aryan sons are convinced against one another, called upon to serve for the causes of decrepit old men. However, with the rapid decay in Germany comes a silver lining. The strong pillar that is the Reich has begun to crumble, and the chains that have attached Europe to it begin to grow loose. Plots and plans that were once naught but a pipe dream might soon enter the realm of possibility.\n\nOur dreams must be realized. France, or rather, the rump state still known as France, must be brought to heel once again so that the Ordensstaat may prosper and work towards the Reichsführer-SS's plan. Yet, before we march to expand the confines of the Ordensstaat, we must first ensure that our loyal local collaborators are as loyal as they seem..."
BRG_unlock.1.a:0 "To victory."

BRG_unlock.2.t:0 "Where to Go But Forward?"
BRG_unlock.2.desc:0 "It was a dark, stormy night as the Reichsführer-SS sat at his desk, with the rain clamoring onto his window and, with the only candle in the room snuffed out, the thunderous bolts rained down by the Gods were the only source of light for the leader of the Ordensstaat. In front of him laid the intelligence file regarding Léon Degrelle. Léon Degrelle, the former leader of the Belgian region of the Ordensstaat. Léon Degrelle, the Traitor of Traitors who led devilish revolutionaries to wage open war against his Aryan masters. Léon Degrelle, found dead at the end of the great search for him. Though the path Degrelle led appeared miserable, it gave the Reichsführer-SS a chilling thought regarding more threats to the Plan.\n\nHow on Earth did he expect to bring about the Vision into the world if he did not have the rest of these potential and former rebels succumbing to his rule, like a ragged, starved hound to the man holding the steak? Allowing the French, Walloon, or the Belgian to remain stewing in the scorn of defeat as they are treated as such will inevitably see them revolt; however, if we just so happen to placate them for long enough, perhaps it would give the Reichsführer-SS and the Ordensstaat enough time to bring about the Plan into the world, and see the necessity of such pacifistic awakenings of our will gone from this Earth?"
BRG_unlock.2.a:0 "A plan is brewing."

BRG_unlock.3.t:0 "Collaborators Need Not Apply"
BRG_unlock.3.desc:0 "For years, the Ordensstaat has relied upon the collaborator legions to remain afloat. Yet, those who would betray their own nationalities to serve the Reich have always been of questionable loyalty, and for too long the Reichsführer-SS has been forced into shamefully walking a tightrope to ensure that these opportunistic collaborators were at all times content, and not looking for a fresh opportunity to seize further power and control for themselves.\n\nThe time for acrobatics and tight rope walking has come to an end. The treacherous legions of Charlemagne and Walloon may have worked for the Reichsführer-SS when it so suited them, but their minds have always been blackened with hidden thoughts of treason and treachery. Such hidden plots and aspirations shall never come to pass.\n\nThe Ordensstaat has outgrown the need to appease such collaborators. They will be dismantled. Their assets will be seized. What resources they have had at their disposal shall be brought back into the fold. One final effort so that the Ordensstaat may rest easy, never again having to fear a stab in the back by the legions."
BRG_unlock.3.a:0 "Bring them back into the fold."

BRG_unlock.4.t:0 "The Aryan Conquest"
BRG_unlock.4.desc:0 "Free from the chains of the decrepit old politicians in Germania, the Reichsführer-SS led the Ordensstaat upon a campaign of conquest against the French State. And conquer we did. Once again, France was swift to fall to German hands, surrendering vast tracts of their already pathetic nation to the Ordensstaat.\n\nDespite the weakness of the French nation, the land they occupied is rich. Fertile, well populated, and well stocked with natural resources, the French have for millenia put the potential of their soil to waste. The Aryan man, however, is not so decadent. It will be no small effort, but we shall achieve greatness upon the very grounds upon which the French failed.\n\nIt all begins with the existing industry and workforce. Those assets which were damaged in the short war must be repaired, and the formerly French industries and workforce must be integrated into Burgundian society for the betterment of the Aryan race. This land is a workhorse which shall not be wasted."
BRG_unlock.4.a:0 "We will succeed where others failed."

BRG_unlock.5.t:0 "Dependent No More"
BRG_unlock.5.desc:0 "Oil was something that drove the world, and no one in the modern nation could live without it. Not the United States, not Japan, not Germany - not even the Ordensstaat.\n\nHimmler knew this inconvenient fact, and as a result oil was a highly controlled resource in the Ordensstaat - one which he made sure was always closely watched. By the standards of some nations, much of Burgundy's industry was unnecessarily manual and labor-intensive - but the fact was that oil was too precious to be wantonly used.\n\nHowever, he had always sought to break this dependency. There were means of artificially producing oil, and such technology was in the hands of others - his spies had been charged with finding the schematics and secrets of these nations for years now.\n\nToday, they had succeeded.\n\nHimmler held the report from the Ministry of Resource Management in one hand, one which detailed what was known as synthetic refining. The specifics of the technology he did not especially care about - but the actual result he most certainly did. According to the report, they would be able to synthetically produce oil with the resources in Burgundy - effectively eliminating their dependency on crude oil.\n\nHe smiled.\n\nHis spies had done well, stealing these blueprints. There would be a period of time for these refineries to be made, and when they were, Burgundy would roar to life. No more would they be chained by their dependence on oil. That age was over.\n\nSomething beautiful was about to begin."
BRG_unlock.5.a:0 "His industrial revolution would now begin."

BRG_unlock.6.t:0 "To Become Death"
BRG_unlock.6.desc:0 "At last, the Ordensstaat has succeeded in producing its first few atomic weapons. A momentous achievement to be sure, yet it is not enough. What few weapons we have yet produced is the first step, but it must be recognized that the yield of such weaponry is little compared to the advanced nuclear weaponry produced by the great nuclear powers, after their decades of arms races.\n\nThe Ordensstaat will never be capable of producing an apocalyptic arsenal such as that possessed by Germania or Washington, yet we must possess for ourselves a deterrent. As of current, it would take but one determined leader who cares not for the deaths of a hundred thousand civilians to commit his forces against the Ordensstaat, and from which point we would find ourselves helpless and possibly defeated.\n\nThe arsenal must grow, at all costs. The world shall know that it will result in suicide should any enemy of the Reichsführer-SS cross into the Ordensstaat. It is a matter of survival."
BRG_unlock.6.a:0 "The Destroyer of Worlds."

BRG_unlock.7.t:0 "Curbing Degeneracy"
BRG_unlock.7.desc:0 "With the fall of France once again and the secession of great tracts of their land to the Ordensstaat came a predictable consequence: the acquisition of millions of Frenchmen, ill-suited to the established Burgundian ideal. The usual rate of re-education and Germanization efforts, however, will not suffice in this case.\n\nWhilst we may rely in part upon the SS-Charlemagne collaborators, and whilst they may utter pledges of loyalty to the Reichsführer-SS upon a regular basis, they may not be ignored for what they are: French nationalists, who surely long for the day where their strength is great enough to topple the Ordensstaat to which they are made to bend the knee. And this novel base of Frenchmen is surely a tantalizing opportunity for them.\n\nThis opportunity for treason will be disintegrated in front of them. No more shall the instability wrought by Charlemagne grow. All efforts of re-education and Germanization shall be redoubled, until all living in the French territories are brought under the Germanic wing. The stability of the Ordensstaat relies upon it."
BRG_unlock.7.a:0 "Reining in the Frenchmen."

BRG_unlock.8.t:0 "The Silos Stand Empty"
BRG_unlock.8.desc:0 "The Ordensstaat has for years now stood as a global beacon of industrial success and prowess. As other nations falter and struggle, their industries continuing to ebb and flow, the industries of the Ordensstaat have only continued to provide increasing production metrics, month in and month out. Yet it would appear that such success has not been without a cost.\n\nFarmers were made to leave the fields. The plow was traded for the wrench, as a record number of men laboured in the foundries and factories across our domain. However, the silos would quietly begin to store less grain, for there was less grain to store. Yet we did not falter in our efforts, for the world is full of grain. Now and again the silos would once again begin to grow empty, and once again the WVHA would simply secure further imports of grain from the Ukraine. Men could eat and return to their production lines day in and day out.\n\nBut the Ukrainian grain shipments have ceased. No longer do trains full of eastern grain top off our silos to feed the labouring men. Swiftly our silos begin to empty, and there is simply no way to fill them again unless serious domestic action is taken. For now the situation is not yet forlorn, but upon the horizon looms a hideous famine which looks to put the plans of the Reichsführer-SS at risk, and such cannot be allowed."
BRG_unlock.8.a:0 "We need to fix this. Now!"

BRG_unlock.9.t:0 "Death Looms Near"
BRG_unlock.9.desc:0 "Never has such great effort had such little impact. The Ordensstaat was overturned so that grain would return to the silos and workers would return to the fields. The plan should have worked. Yet the calculations thought up by the WVHA were imperfect. Our efforts ended when they should have, by all means, continued.\n\nAs a result, famine continues to ravage the Ordensstaat, and worse than before. Once again, we are bound to act radically, even more so than before, else risk facing a cataclysmic mass starvation which will see every facet of Burgundian society, from the top echelons to the most lowly undesirables, endure great suffering.\n\nNo stone may be left unturned. Not. One. Stone."
BRG_unlock.9.a:0 "We shall burn the cities if we must."

 BRG_unter_der_schwarzen_sonne_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat was not founded as a nation, but as a distraction. Hitler hoped that due to the rebellious nature of the French and Belgians, the Reichsführer-SS would be kept too busy trying to pacify the natives instead of consolidating his influence within the Reich.\n\nHow ironic it was that the Führer himself would underestimate the resourcefulness of the Aryan mind. The Ordensstaat has served as a perfect place for us to prepare, away from the prying eyes of Germania. And when we step into their view again, it will shake them to their core."
 BRG_a_wise_leader_desc:0 "The Reichsführer-SS is dismissed by his political rivals as "the craziest man in uniform," when in reality he is the last sane man in the Reich. How could the people not realize that their leaders have abandoned National Socialism, and that there is no other man fit to take up the cause?\n\nThankfully, the Reichsführer-SS has not spent years fiddling while Germania burns. The time will soon come when all is well and order is restored to Europe."
 BRG_a_loyal_army_desc:0 "Hitler's first mistake in the creation of the Ordensstaat was allowing the Reichsführer-SS to recruit as many of his followers as he pleased. To the degenerates twisting the Führer's ear, this seemed like the perfect idea: no more so-called fanatics marching past their homes, reminding them of the values that they fail to uphold, threatening to end the decadent Xanadu they had built for themselves.\n\nHowever, it proved to be nothing but a boon for the fledgling Ordensstaat. A bureaucracy and gendarmerie once filled with French "collaborators" of dubious loyalty were replaced by legions of experienced, efficient, and above all else dedicated men. They know how to run a state, slaughter partisans, and fight in the harshest conditions. And a day may soon come where they fight again."
 BRG_a_pure_race_desc:0 "The Aryan race teeters on the brink of catastrophe. The Großgermanisches Reich, their ancestral and spiritual home, is rife with decadence and corruption. They believe that their status as the Master Race, rather than giving them the duty to be industrious, instead exempts them from all labor. They lounge about in palatial mansions, letting their minds rot and their bodies grow soft.\n\nThose in the Ordensstaat, however, shall not succumb to such degeneracy. They understand the value of work, the importance of ideology, and above all, duty to their people."
 BRG_the_last_hope_for_germania_desc:0 "In effeminate liberal democracies, the idea of government overthrow is treated as a weapon of last resort. Those who slaver at the thought of defending their so-called rights from tyranny only insist that they will act when so many laws are violated, or so many parties are banned, or so many men are arrested. It is a cover for their weakness, an excuse for them to say "not now, the time is not yet right" whenever someone asks them to show a backbone.\n\nThe Aryan, however, does not wait. He sees the opportunity for power, and he seizes it with as much force as he can muster! He does not fear to tear down the rotten old structure and rebuild it in his image! He does not let betrayal or exile dampen his will! He marches in, pushes aside all who stand in his way, and rights what is wrong permanently!"
 BRG_a_change_in_plan_desc:0 "Something had gone terribly wrong. Not only does Hitler still breathe, but he is also painfully aware of his own mortality. Someone will soon receive his blessing as the official successor to the office of Führer, and will undoubtedly have his supporters in the government and Wehrmacht on high alert if the Reichsführer-SS attempts to assert his power again.\n\nThe route to regaining power over such a broken Reich must be recalculated. It may take longer than initially anticipated, but it shall be iron-clad and leave nothing to chance. Time to call a meeting."
 BRG_admit_no_fault_desc:0 "There are those who, if they knew the truth of the assassination attempt, would use it to defame the Reichsführer-SS as a cowardly weakling professing a failed ideology. They could be no further from the truth. The Reichsführer-SS fully understands the meaning of National Socialism, and the so-called ideologues in Germania continue to vomit out degenerate lies in place of sound theory.\n\nThere is no such thing as a flaw in Nazism, only a flaw in the race implementing it. And the Aryan race has many flaws that must be expunged."
 BRG_expand_the_camps_desc:0 "A powerful man cannot climb his way to the top without making many, many enemies. There are rivals within the bureaucracy, constantly conniving to further their own ends at the expense of the Volk. There are dissenters and rumor-mongers, preferring to spread lies and denounce the truths of National Socialism. There are also spies and saboteurs, undermining the Aryan race at every turn to aid their Semitic masters.\n\nThese vermin, like any other, shall be tracked down and caught. And that means that we will need more places to put them all. Preliminary locations in the Alps are being scouted, due to their proximity to new construction sites and the harshness of their climate as a deterrent for escape."
 BRG_redouble_re_education_efforts_desc:0 "There are many fine Aryan youths in the Ordensstaat who are genetically pure, but their minds have unfortunately been tainted by the teachings of degenerate parents or educators. It is too late for the generations that preceded them, but there is still hope for them to be molded into the image of the ideal Aryan man and woman.\n\nThe positive values of National Socialism must be reinforced, and the negative values of liberalism, leftism, or Judeo-cosmopolitan "traditionalism" must be eradicated. Hopefully by the time they reach adulthood, they may serve the Ordensstaat with pride."
 BRG_sonnenfinsternis_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat has one purpose, and one purpose alone. We are the body that enforces the Reichsführer-SS's will, nothing more, nothing less. Our purpose is not to construct a nation-state, nor is it to Aryanize the natives. The Reichsführer-SS's vision is one far grander than establishing a single enclave of racial purity atop a Gallic cesspit... and after all, the local vermin may have a role in its fulfillment."
 BRG_expand_project_gjallarhorn_desc:0 "In war, every defeat is due to human error. Inability to properly anticipate the enemy and failure to prepare oneself have doomed dozens of kings and conquerors to the dustbin of history. We, however, shall not be taken unawares.\n\nIn the first days of the Ordensstaat, the Reichsführer-SS ordered the development of a nuclear early warning program called "Wotan." It was ultimately scrapped, but its infrastructure and resources can be reused for a greater purpose. Not as a watcher, but as a harbinger."
 BRG_the_ultimate_deterrent_desc:0 "There is only one weapon that the great powers of the world fear, one weapon that can cow the mighty American military into submission, one weapon that can undo God's creation: the atomic bomb. It is the tool to ensure our survival, which means it is the tool to guarantee our triumph.\n\nWe must acquire one of these weapons for ourselves, to ensure that the degenerates plotting in Germania do not think us able to be defeated in one fell swoop. If they know that we can turn their precious mansions and brothels into ash with the push of a button, they will think twice before engaging."
 BRG_the_ultimate_salvation_desc:0 "As of now, foreign nations leave us alone because we are technically part of the Reich; an attack on us would be an attack on the Pakt. As Germany proper continues to rot however, the Ordensstaat becomes more and more exposed; so naturally, it is up to us to create our own deterrence.\n\nFor years, we have been in secret creating the infrastructure and means to produce our own atomic arsenal. Our first nuclear weapon is nearing completion; soon, all that will remain will be to test the warhead. A successful detonation will ensure our place in the world and keep the degenerates in Germania, the Jews in America, and the backstabbing Samurai out of our affairs. No one will dare to intervene in the Ordensstaat while we have nuclear deterrence."
 BRG_admit_no_loyalty_desc:0 "Only a slave would be content in a system where strong servants obey weak masters, and the Aryan race has thrown off their slave mentality. We shall not take orders from that doddering fool in Germania, nor shall we acknowledge the legitimacy of his simpering cronies vying for his throne.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS shall be our guiding light, and we shall scorn those who prefer to huddle beneath the shadows of lesser men."
 BRG_drill_the_waffen_desc:0 "The good Aryan always keeps his mind and body at peak condition, never letting himself fall into the morass of complacence. The Waffen-SS, which contains the strongest and most devoted Aryan soldiers the Reich has to offer, is no exception.\n\nTraining must be frequent and rigorous, to make sure that every soldier carries out his instructions exactly as ordered during the heat of battle. The time to test their mettle will be soon, and we will not send forth an army of second-rate simpletons."
 BRG_call_upon_the_butcher_desc:0 "Reinhard Heydrich is a loyal and capable servant of the Reichsführer-SS, so skilled that he was personally entrusted with managing the Deutsche-SS after the Ordensstaat's establishment. His record is not spotless-he was unable to capture Hitler during the Reichsführer-SS's coup, a failure some speculate was intentional.\n\nHowever, it did provide a silver lining and get him in the Führer's good graces.

While he sees his health fail further every single waking second, the Reichsführer-SS has acknowledged that the time has come to change prerogatives of the Ordensstaat. Today is the day in which we shift our focus from these small-scale clandestine operations to more bold moves in the world, categorized by the influence of the nuclear missile stockpiles throughout the globe, and their ability to forward the Plan of the Reichsführer-SS. No more shall this world stand knee-deep in the insulting pit of disgust and corruption that it rests in now, and no more shall we stand idle as every day, more seeds of this corruption are sown into this Earth, at the very cost of this world in a rushing cloud of atoms, if we have to."

 BRG_opening.1.t:0 "The Old General's Adieu"
 BRG_opening.1.desc:0 "General Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel stared out the window of his limousine, watching Nanzig shrink further and further into the distance. He had spent twenty years in the city, first as head of the German military occupation, then in a nebulously-defined "advisory position" for the collaborator government. Either way, his job had remained the same: keep the Teutonic boot pressed on the Gallic neck. It was a job that he had performed admirably, but it gnawed away at him over the decades. The orders he signed, the reprisal killings against Resistance members' hometowns, the cattle-cars full of people who would never return... there was much that he was willing to stomach for the sake of his Vaterland, but sometimes it crossed the line.\n\nBut there were other aspects of his duty that he carried out with pride. When the regime was reorganized and Himmler was appointed as his superior, Carl-Heinrich tried his damndest to keep the SS on a short leash. But everyone he trusted in the administration was suddenly demoted, arrested on suspicious charges, or suffered a tragic accident. His power in the bureaucracy waned, and he became little more than an informant, passing along Himmler's latest doings to Germania. Now, he could no longer do even that. Truth be told, he should have been feeling relief that it was no longer his burden to stare into that abyss every day.\n\nBut all he felt was terror at the thought of what they will do with no one watching."

 BRG_opening.2.t:0 "Framing and Context"
 BRG_opening.2.desc:0 "In important matters of state, presentation is everything. Something as major as a lavish award ceremony for a prominent general can have just as much of a political ramification as something as minor as the seating arrangements at a state diner. And there is no exception when it comes to the humble framed photo.\n\nFor two decades, official state portraits of the Führer have been ubiquitous. Whether it was the young, dynamic firebrand of the 1930s, or the gracefully aging conqueror of the early 1950s, millions of blue eyes have loomed over the classrooms, offices, and sitting rooms of the Reich. And within the Ordensstaat's borders, they have always been accompanied by a smaller, more tasteful black-and-white photo portrait of the Reichsführer-SS. A way to exalt himself while remaining courteous and aware of his subservience.\n\nBut no longer. Over the weekend, every SS office in the Ordensstaat received a new portrait. It was a painting of the Reichsführer-SS, in full regalia with a peaked cap and overcoat-and in color no less- clearly meant to mimic his Führer. It was the exact same size, and even more shockingly, was ordered to be hung at the exact same height as the portrait of Hitler.\n\nThe members of the SS unflinchingly complied with this order, while the few dignitaries still representing the Reich in Nanzig quietly tut-tutted the move. Word would surely make its way back to Germania and the Führer would rave about how this is proof Himmler was plotting against him, but what would be done about it? After all, who would risk a civil war over a few lithographs?"

The moment where they would no longer be boys under the tutelage of the Reich, but men of the Waffen-SS.\n\nA bugle call rang out, and a brass band played "SS Marschiert in Feindesland" as flags bearing swastikas, Sig runes, black suns, and all sorts of Aryan symbols were carried onto the stage.\n\nWhen that was done, the moment they were all waiting for began. They crisply raised their right hands into salutes, and recited the words they had spent weeks memorizing:\n\n"I swear to God this holy oath,\nthat I shall be eternally obedient\nto the guide and savior of the Aryan race,\nHeinrich Himmler, Reichsführer-SS,\nand that at all times I will gladly give my life\nin the name of blood, race, and Fatherland."\n\nTheir oath complete, the band struck up once again, playing the Horst-Wessel-Lied this time. It could hardly be seen in the dim, flickering light, but every single soldier on the parade ground was grinning from ear to ear."

They ultimately decided that they would wait to see him and choose which one they felt was suitable then.\n\nThe nurse walked in, carrying a clipboard. "Frau Hilda Müller? Please fill this out," she rotely recited as she thrust a clipboard into Hilda's lap.\n\nHilda picked up the clipboard and looked at the paper on top. Notice of death?!\n\n"Your boy had visible signs of mongolism and was euthanized per the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring of 1933. We need a name for the forms."\n\nHilda was being overwhelmed by emotions, but she was able to hold back tears long enough to choke out, "O-of course, all f-f-for our race..." She picked up the pen and shakily scrawled "Lars" in for the name of the deceased, because she didn't know if she could stay composed long enough to write all nine letters of the name Siegfried.\n\nThe nurse snatched back up the clipboard and strode out of the room, slamming the door behind her.

And the time had come for the journey to begin.\n\nIt had taken months of planning. The task at hand was twofold; not only did the Sicherheitsdienst have to smuggle a foreign national into Germania, but they also had to make sure he did so without resisting. The SD were experienced in implanting spies, but usually those spies wanted to be there. Thankfully, SD agents had captured the poor sap's family, and a few recordings of their interrogation were enough to keep him compliant. He was sent over with nothing but some forged credentials, a Nambu pistol, and a cyanide pill. He had no pretenses of ever returning-his handlers had made it very clear that if the next day's paper said anything other than "the assassin was killed while being apprehended," then his wife and children would suffer a slow and excruciating end. It would have to happen during the moon landing, when the eyes of every man, woman, and child in the Reich (and every soldier, sentry, and officer) would be glued to their television sets.\n\nAnd as the capsule hurtled towards the moon, so did destiny hurtle towards the Reich. The Burgundische-SS were on high alert, the Deutsche-SS were silently preparing to mobilize, and the secondary waves of murders were planned. Everything was coming together, and now, all the Reichsführer-SS could do was wait to see it unfold the next day."

Overrun the demilitarized zones the French have been forced to abide by before they have any hope of occupying them, take Paris, and smash any hope the French may hold of resistance against our regime. The war will be short and swift, and there is little doubt that the French will have the will or means to resist if we quickly take central France."

He wrung his hands as he stood in the elevator, had a bit of a skip in his step as he strode down the underground hallways, and nervously fiddled with a pen as he stood in the observation room. Today was a day of momentous importance for the Ordensstaat and the world as a whole, and everyone in the room knew it. There was no room for error.\n\nThe countdown began, and the room became filled with an almost electric energy. Scientists flipped switches, viewports were closed, and high-speed cameras were switched on. As the countdown grew closer, beads of sweat began to form on the Reichsführer-SS's brow. Was the ambition of a decade finally about to be realized?\n\nThe countdown finally neared its end.\nThree.\nTwo.\nOne.\n\nFor a split second, a flash of light seeped through the edges of the viewports' shutters, briefly lighting up the room. A low, rumbling roar was heard, crescendoing every second, rattling the computers and shaking dust from the ceiling, until it suddenly ceased. The viewports were slowly opened, and the Reichsführer-SS eagerly rushed to look outside. There, framed between two mountains, was the unmistakable silhouette of a mushroom cloud. Something tugged at the corner of the Reichsführer-SS's lips, and for what felt like the first time in years..."

He did not want to miss a moment of it.\n\nThe doors flew open, and a small cadre of clearly flustered officers burst in with newspapers in their hands. "My Reichsführer..."\n\nHe eagerly snatched a copy of the Völkischer Beobachter from their hands, turning to the front page. It was dominated by a black-and-white portrait of the wizened Führer and a photograph of the Volkshalle, its entrances cordoned off by Wehrmacht as paramedics ran inside. In bold block letters, it read ATTEMPT ON THE FÜHRER'S LIFE. Wait, attempt?\n\n"The assassin failed," the officer gasped, "Hitler still lives!"\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS's body froze, and time seemed to stand still. No, no, no, NO! Not after all this! Not during what was supposed to be his hour of triumph! His shock was soon replaced by a churning, fiery cauldron of rage, which violently exploded in a tirade of legendary proportions. Himmler cursed the inept assassin, the Japanese race, the ever-menacing Jews, the decrepit Führer, his damnable personal guard, and every god he could name.\n\nWhen his rant ended, he slumped back into his chair, his energy spent. For the first time in years, Himmler felt hopelessly and utterly lost."

Keeping such a massive project secret from the rest of the world, and Germany in particular, has been almost as difficult as developing the weapons themselves. Secrecy has been of the utmost importance, for if this were to be exposed to the world, the consequences could have been... catastrophic.\n\nOur efforts are finally coming to fruition. Soon, the world will shake in their boots when they discover that the Ordensstaat is no longer defenseless, and no longer will the Reich hold nuclear destruction over our heads! We will forge our own path, following the path laid out by the Reichsführer-SS. We will see his plan carried out, at any costs, and there will be no interruptions at home by foreign powers."

We have heard rumor that the Führer has mentioned you by name as a potential candidate, which is fantastic for our cause. Continue to win his favor; and continue to foster the organization in Germany proper for the conflict to come.\n\nHeydrich, this is a great opportunity to redeem yourself in the eyes of the Reichsführer-SS. Your... underwhelming performance in the past will be overlooked if our plans in Germany succeed. It is vital, for both the Staat and you, that you succeed in your task.\n\nIt should not need to be said what will occur if you let us down again."

Fake Nazis, who only join the party to advance themselves, a lack of true Aryan patriots. A pitiful lack of REAL Aryan men, who have hearts of iron to do what needs to be done. How could a man of such conviction, Hitler himself, allow Jews, the plague of Europe, to continue to exist in our borders?\n\nNazism is right; it is the only path for Aryans to tread. It is the only way to secure the existence of our people for the future to come. Yet, the Reich has lost its way, and degenerates more and more, rotting from the inside. Only the Reichsführer-SS and us few in the SS have the will to give the Aryans their birthright; the world. Only us few follow the tenets of Nazism in its purest form, without compromise or luxury while the pigs in the Reich feast upon the scraps their slaves make them. Their time will come.

As his eyes misted over, he barely heard the dull thud of his door swinging open, slamming on the hinges. Von Ribbentrop. An old ally, or as close to an ally as could be trusted. A curt nod nonetheless, precise and cold. He had earned nothing more. "Ribbentrop. I trust that you are well?"\n\nThe man was... different, even under the Reichsführer's cursory gaze. He marched with none of his trademark confidence or zest - and slammed down a manila folder on the Reichsführer's desk. "A letter, Herr Reichsführer." Was it just him, or was there fear in Ribbentrop's eyes? The Reichsführer-SS's brows arched. He opened the folder, pulling out a small piece of paper, and squinted. The words quickly became obvious through the Fraktur: A CONDEMNATION. Its signatories were more disturbing still: Admiral Krancke. Admiral Voss.\n\nJoachim von Ribbentrop.\n\n"What is this?" The Reichsführer-SS's hand trembled ever so slightly. A betrayal. Here. Now. Who else? Could no one be trusted?\n\n"Herr Reichsführer, in my capacity I must object to our intervention in the French State. I do not intend to condemn or suborn you - do not misconstrue me - " He bent over and rasped, the effort visibly pained. "The Fatherland bleeds, and night falls ever darker there. Would it not be wise to spare Aryan blood, Aryan treasure, and preserve lives in the territory we control? Herr Reichsführer, you of all people know I have been a loyal servant. It is my sincere belief that our work here will suffer from this military adventure. If only for my sake, please consider heeding my advice."\n\n"You are dismissed, Herr von Ribbentrop."

Then we dared to hope once more, for the paroxysms in the wake of the Führer's death offered a new opportunity - one slaked with more blood than we might have hoped, but an opportunity nonetheless.\n\nWhere the degenerate or misled flung themselves at each other in fratricidal fury, Heydrich would be the Reichsführer-SS's useful proxy as National Socialism reemerged in the Reich. Or so we had hoped.\n\nThe reports we are receiving from Heydrich's sector would seem to indicate that - regretfully - quantity has a quality all of its own. The inferior masses of the Reich would sooner see the Reich rot than to see it reforged. They have taken our pawn out of play; Heydrich is believed missing or dead, and his men are abandoning their posts.\n\nHaving displayed our hand so openly in the recent conflict, we can no longer expect any feasible avenue for taking direct control over the Reich. So be it; if the degenerates wish to rut like pigs in their ruined cities, they can do so. We will finish our business with Heydrich and his men, before exploring a more subtle approach to realizing the Reichsführer-SS's vision."

Never, in all his years serving the Reich as a foreign diplomat, had Felix felt this worried about his country. With Hitler away, one could feel the immense pressure weighing down on the citizens of Germania. Crime rate increased, everyone was taking sides; even the military was fracturing. It was as if Hitler's condition left his body and plagued an entire city.\n\nNo matter. Felix received his order and believed it would be his last when he read the destination: the Burgundian embassy. He hated Burgundy. Each time he passed the embassy, there would be two people present at most. Burgundy liked to keep things secret and provided only the minimum amount of staff needed to get the job done. And the few "diplomats" were skilled; they would only respond in short phrases, and if you pushed them to say more, you would be glared at. Such was the nature of a "Shadow State", Felix pondered.\n\nFelix was walking slowly through the Volkshalle towards the Burgundian embassy, but the question pierced his thoughts: why was he needed to talk with the Burgundians? What could he expect from them? The tension of the city was pressing on him, and his body began to churn as he saw the door.\n\nGermany was failing and Burgundy knew it. Would he be killed if he went in there? Would he die in the office with the giant Himmler portrait, under the black banner? Even if he needed to speak to a diplomat, Felix realized, he shouldn't get a response; there must be something big developing between Germany and the Shadow State. The door was in reach now, all Felix had to do was open...\n\nNothing. The large room that once housed the Burgundian embassy was emptied, cleaned, and only the walls remained. This was all planned, Felix thought: Burgundy left the burning country to die, and they would not be coming back."

If nothing else, it gave him the opportunity to reflect. It had been some time since he'd paid his respects to the origin of National Socialism. He let himself sink into his chair, stirred the glass of water and ice in his hand, and faded back into the streets of Munich. Cheering. Chanting. Fists in the air. The birthplace of action against decadence. A revolt against the rot of the subhumans which pushed Germany towards the brink. Really, however, it began earlier than that, the foundations of the NSDAP were where the future of mankind was held, and it was really an inevitability. National Socialism was always a necessity for the Aryan race, and an inevitability. More than anything else, Aryans were always destined to establish a National Socialist order, it was always a subconscious fact of Aryans across Germany. Of course, there was never any real leader quite like Adolf, nobody who could establish such an order as this. Without him, Germany would have never opened its eyes. Neither would Himmler.\n\nIf only such a future as this could be ingrained forevermore. Even still, what could be done? Adolf had grown old, set on his deathbed and surrounded by leeches. Left abandoned in his exile, Himmler had nothing but his surroundings of rot seeping into Germany's pores, suffocating it as Adolf's breaths grew raspier. His death was equally inevitable, horrible as it was to think about.\n\nHimmler returned his gaze to the telephone sitting on his desk. It was time to let go. His heart felt as though it was cleared of doubt, his mind of hesitation. There were greater issues on the horizon for the Ordensstaat. The Reichsführer-SS pulled letter paper from his desk and placed them in front of him, pen in hand. By the time the sun would rise again across the Reich, all representative personnel stationed in Germany would withdraw back into Burgundy. The Ordensstaat would face worse issues than confirming a formality in the coming months, after all."

It seemed appropriate, and it wouldn't do to be caught flatfooted if something actually were to happen.\n\nHe'd requested dozens of reports to be delivered, all of which had been faithfully compiled and completed by Ordensstaat personnel. Factory outputs, slaves numbers, camp production rates, and so on. He'd settled in for what he thought would be a simple review to be done in a few hours. Just to confirm all was well. A review which lasted a day. Then another. By the third his mild concern had grown into a near-panic.\n\nThis was bad. Very, very bad.\n\nThe Reichsführer had never taken a particular interest in the economy, and it had never really received the attention Pohl was now giving it. Pohl couldn't deny reality though - while he was not a particularly skilled economist, he knew enough to see the red sirens and hear the ringing alarm bells.\n\nBurgundy, as it ran now, was completely unsustainable. Making matters worse was that Himmler had just approved a significant amount of spending - spending they couldn't afford. At their current pace, Pohl feared that they would unintentionally bankrupt the country. With how unstable the economy was, it would only take one domino to fall before the entire system collapsed.\n\nHe was certain Himmler didn't know this. That was a mistake he needed to rectify. Burgundy was on borrowed time - but he believed it could yet be saved."

 BRG_opening.17.t:0 "An Unexpected Disappointment"
 BRG_opening.17.desc:0 "Pohl was unsettled by just how calmly Himmler was taking the news that Burgundy was on the verge of an economic disaster. Throughout his entire presentation, the Reichsführer had remained shockingly impassive. He'd not even so much as glanced at the evidence provided. It baffled Pohl. Did he not care about this?\n\nFinally, he finished, and waited for Himmler to speak. "I'm disappointed," Himmler said after a few seconds of silence, shaking his head. "Of all those I expected disloyalty from, I didn't think it would be you."\n\nDisloyal? What was he talking about? Pohl's mouth parted slightly, completely baffled as to what he could mean. "Reichsführer, I have been nothing but loyal to you since the beginning."\n\n"You dare claim this after what you just told me?" Himmler snapped, in an almost uncharacteristic outburst. "If you were not working against me, you would not have presented these fraudulent numbers! This manufactured 'evidence' you have presented undermines the very foundations of true National Socialism itself!"\n\nPohl stared in disbelief, mouth gaping in horror at how this had gone. "Reichsführer, I-"\n\n"Silence!" Himmler glared at him, lifting a hand. "What I have created will outlast time itself. I know better than to be fooled by traitors like you." The door opened behind Pohl, and two SS officers entered, and grabbed his arms. Himmler appraised Pohl coldly. "Take him away."\n\nHimmler ignored the sputtering and protests of the screamer, and sat back down, calmly pulling out several folders. Pohl's treason was an unexpected development, but hardly a matter of concern. It had been a clever ploy, but his perfected National Socialism was immortal. He would just have to find a proper steward to oversee it."

 BRG_opening.18.desc:0 "Franz Novak sat opposite Himmler, trying his best not to fidget as the Reichsführer appraised him, face impassive and hands folded. Novak didn't know for sure why he'd been summoned, but if he was right, it meant that the Reichsführer was finally seeing his worth. Finally, Himmler spoke. "What is the true National Socialism, Franz?"\n\n"It is more than a system of governance, Reichsführer," Novak said carefully, knowing what answer was expected. "It is the final iteration of society itself, one which works to protect, provide, and uplift the Aryan - guided by a wise and capable leader. In a word, my Reichsführer, it is the purest incarnation of National Socialism, one which not even the Führer himself was able to achieve before it was corrupted by the degeneracy of liberalism and stagnation."\n\nHimmler nodded approvingly. "Good. I am pleased that you understand this." After a pause, he cocked his head. "Speak freely, Novak. Do you believe that it can be improved further?"\n\nNovak knew better than to think that, and made sure he shook his head violently and put some extra awe in his voice. "How can you improve what is flawless?"\n\n"Exactly," Himmler answered with a slight nod. "Your predecessor did not have your understanding or loyalty. He attempted deception with manufactured 'evidence' showing National Socialism as a failure. I trust you will not make such mistakes." Himmler's eyes met his. They were cold. "I expect great things from you, Novak. Do not disappoint me."\n\n"I will not, Reichsführer, I shall endeavor to serve to the best of my ability," Novak pledged, putting extra emphasis in his voice to show he meant it. "You can rest assured of my complete loyalty to you, and to the Ordensstaat." Himmler seemed satisfied with his answer, and stood, shaking his hand."

  BRG_unternehmen_ludwig_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our plant in the Reich failed in his task to kill the Führer. However, the botched attempt has proved to us without a doubt that the Reich will not survive the death of Hitler. His health is ailing; it is only a matter of time before he dies and the Reich collapses. While we wait, we have work to do.\n\nLéon Degrelle, the leader of the Walloon Legion, has been acting... strange, to say the least. Likewise, the Charlemagne Legion is restless. We should put the collaborators to work; it is time for us to begin drawing up plans for an invasion of France. Once Germany falls into chaos, no one will be able to stop us acquiring more French lands for the Ordensstaat."
  BRG_the_loyal_dogs_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat employs three native SS divisions to further the Reichsführer's ultimate goal. Although these men are not Aryans, they are useful collaborators who help keep the locals in their place, so to speak. The Charlemagne and Langemarck divisions have become restless as of late, while Degrelle's Walloon Division sulks in the north. It's time to get the collaborators to pull their weight and get to work; we will call the officers of these divisions back to Nanzig to begin in depth planning for the invasion of France."
  BRG_dangle_the_carrot_desc:0 "We are not fools; the three native divisions under command do not serve us out of loyalty or their belief in our cause. They serve and fight for the Reichsführer because service is the most profitable avenue for non-Aryans in Burgundy. Our servants have indeed proven their use, and should be rewarded with new weapons and equipment from our vast stockpiles. Service to the Reichsführer should be rewarded, to encourage further cooperation as well as to increase their effectiveness."
  BRG_expand_the_pipeline_desc:0 "Although we loathe having to work with degenerate smugglers, we can not let their impurity nor our intransigence get in the way of practicality. All around the world smuggler rings source and sell all kinds of equipment, for a price. It would be well worth our while to have some connections with those rings; they are our access to the world markets and the middlemen who source anything we could ever want."
  BRG_looking_over_walls_desc:0 "The security of the Ordensstaat is of the utmost importance. Enemies from without and in scan for any weakness, any points where a spy can infiltrate our borders needs to be reinforced and garrisoned. For this purpose, we can make use of the many fortifications the French built before the days of our great victory. Putting these to use, we can make our borders nigh impenetrable; no one comes in or out of the Ordensstaat without the Reichsführer's express permission!"
  BRG_the_troublesome_snake_desc:0 "The Walloon Division, headed by Léon Degrelle, have been chafing under our rule ever since the Führer granted the SS authority and the right to administer the Ordensstaat. These nationalists have been steadfast, even in the face of our authority, for more autonomy and rights for their people living in the north of the Staat in what was Belgium. Their fervent nationalism, while commendable, has no place in the Ordensstaat. We must keep them in check and busy doing our biding, least they forget their place under our rule."
  BRG_keep_our_enemies_close_desc:0 "Out of all of our collaborators, Degrelle is by far the most troublesome and dangerous of our subordinates. As we continue to investigate the Walloon Division's activities, it would be useful for us to find ways of keeping the officers close at hand in Nanzig to keep them under close observation. Training exercises, planning for the invasion and occupation of new territories, schematics for building new labor camps, whatever. Let's keep these roundy degenerates close at hand."
  BRG_bide_our_time_desc:0 "Now is not the time to purge willing collaborators in our ranks. Although we know for certain Degrelle is a traitor who is not only disloyal but willing to put a dagger in our backs, we can not afford to kill him... yet.\n\nThe Walloon Division, and by extension the Wallonian people, heed Degrelle's word. Without him as this de-facto figurehead of the Belgian people, we will not be able to exert as much influence in the region as we do now. We may not like Degrelle, but he gets work done in the rowdy north, and without him, we may very well face an armed insurrection.\n\nHis time will come, just not yet. In the meantime, it will be business as usual..."
  BRG_enhance_surveillance_techniques_desc:0 "Although we are not acting in the near future against Degrelle, that does not mean we should relax our surveillance on him.\n\nThese last few months, our file on Degrelle has only become bigger. Although we know that he is suspicious that we're investigating him, we must push on. We already have so much, but we don't have anything "heavy" on him, so to speak. The Reichsführer has ordered us to bring him irrefutable proof that Degrelle is a traitor, and we shall comply. We will not let our leader down; Degrelle's secrets will be exposed."
  BRG_begin_phase_two_desc:0 "Everything is squared away. The native divisions are hard at work, too occupied following orders to think about much else, let alone subvert our rule. Our invasion of France has been planned out to the man, and our border with the Reich has been further fortified as an extra security measure. Our brothers in Germany likewise are preparing for when they will be called up for the cause. The Reichsführer's plan is now well underway; now, we wait. Hitler is ill and dying; the collapse of the Reich is inevitable, and when it falls we will be ready."

Now, more than ever, we find ourselves in a seat of global power; however, there are those within our lands who still remain shaken, and even influenced by those corruptive traitors. It shall be our imperative to remind everyone across our lands, from the most pure Aryan to the most disgusting subhuman, as to who truly sits in power, now that the dust has settled from those insidious bastards' war against us!"

Across the land, such rats scheme in the shadows, licking their wounds from their disastrous defeat at the hands of the mighty Aryan warrior, preparing for more venomous strikes to be carried out against our great men who enforce the will of the Ordensstaat upon the purified people. Nevermore can we allow this, as it is time for our intelligence operations upon these rats to maintain a new level of clandestinism. Only the darkest of shadows, the reddest of ink, the most secure of positions, only the best of the best for our operations carried out against these traitors.

It was such Germanics who formed the greatest empires known to mankind, and having shunned the Gaul, the Breton, and the Slav in their journey to establish themselves as true masters of the world. However, whilst this supremacy reigns true, we mustn't forget the usability of those wretched Gauls who believe they're inline with the true masters of the world. Thus, we shall use the Charlemagne Legion to our advantage, now that they stand at our heel, despite the potential eroding of our power it may appear to be at first, if we manage to maintain control over the Frenchmen, then they shall be our bloodhounds and guard-dogs across these ashen lands!"

Our achievements stand unparalleled, and it is only through the inherent superiority of our blood coupled with the strength of the Ordensstaat that we have been able to forge new paths for humanity. However, with outstanding feats comes the vicious and the envious parasites, who have worked so desperately to undo our work in lands not fully secured yet. It's time to change this, as we shall expand the Guard force of the Ordensstaat in order to ensure stability in our new territories, so that we may stamp out any threat to the vision of the Reichsführer-SS."

These roguish scoundrels have troubled us just as much as they've lent a hand in securing our lands, and it is time that we reassert our control, so that we make ensure that they may never threaten us again. Already, we have managed to extend the shadows of our operations, however, it is time to fully expand our operation in totality. The recruitment and deployment of greater amounts of spies across all fronts of these Legions will allow us to gain a greater understanding of their operations than we have ever had before, and allow us to prepare any potential contingency we may have to counter these terrorists. Never again shall we allow noble Aryan blood to soak the ground because of these Judeo-Bolshevik partisans, never again will we find destruction because of this treachery, and never again will we face defeat in the face of these barbarians!"

However, we mustn't lose ourselves, nor can we afford to lose their loyalty through this conflict. Rather, we must establish an immediately effective precedent: given the Charlemagne Legion's actions against us for so long, and so many enemies to face in the decadent world of today, all lands will be under direct authority of the Ordensstaat, whether they approve or not.

With that in mind, decadence still crawls in the form of our opposition, as the Walloon, now leaderless with the vanishing of their beloved leader, Léon Degrelle, rages in the North as a tribe of barbarians, frothing at the mouth with rage boiled over from their defeat as well as lust for Aryan blood under the inept Jean-François Thiriart. Now with full knowledge as to what happens if we let such terrors stew about, we must ensure we deal with these abominations before they cause any more potential destruction against the Ordensstaat.

We have tolerated these injustices against our regime for far too long, and have allowed for the further corruption of our lands coupled with the spilling of our own loyal blood across our soil because of it. No more, whether it takes a single platoon to as many divisions as we can throw at them, they shall never see the light of victory, nor the light of day, again once we have purged them from our lands, and finally found peace in their inevitable doom."

Though they harbor a misguided sense of belovedness for their subservient bloodline in Flanders, Bert Eriksson continues to lead them for the sake of his people, and can be used as a deadly weapon in combating his rivals within Walloonia. Their inherent disloyalty and barbarism can be displayed to Eriksson, and, provided enough oxygen to heat the flame of Flemish fury, Eriksson may lead his men to accomplish the work for us, rather than expending more resources of the Ordensstaat to deal with the northern crisis. That way, Eriksson stands proud through a victory he proclaimed, and in his pride, find subservience to the Ordensstaat alone."

However, such crimes do not end there, as in their fall, we have managed to evaluate a great deal of information pertaining to the crimes and misdeeds committed by the other Legions and their rings of leadership.

However, their strong devotion shall produce their inevitable downfall, as we shall capitalize upon such notions through our infiltration and usurpation of leadership from their nativist leaders towards those which shall allow us to benefit.

Although we now set down the rifle and roll the tank back into its depot, we must never forget history, and remember the consequences of revanchism perpetrated by the subhuman and the socialist left unchecked.

However, now that our great agents have infiltrated and dominated the leadership dominating the Walloon Legion, it is time to use this beast for our advantage alone. We shall transform the Legion into a new and greater force, one which remembers its master well, and does all in the service of its state.

There it wanders, following its trail until it finds such a source, perhaps an Aryan war hero or a statesmen. And there it butchers, taking the life and heart of a great man, woman, or child and stealing away into the night, devouring anything left to perhaps leave a trace. Some are horrified by the claims, worried about such monsters roaming across the night; others, however, remain sickeningly joyful towards the nature of this abomination, happy from its inflictions of foul and horrendous deeds. It is our duty to dispatch this monster, for once and for all, for the glory of the Ordensstaat."

 #Phase 3
 BRG_setting_the_trap_text:0 "Setting the Trap"
 BRG_setting_the_trap_desc:0 "Perhaps the most controversial decision by the SS high-command in the early days of the Ordensstaat was to continue and expand our "allied" legions of the SS, codenamed Charlemagne, Langemarck, and Walloon. These units were populated by the few within the degenerate nations able to demonstrate capabilities and ideological soundness worthy of the title of "Aryan". For a time we had hoped that these collaborating legions would be able to fulfill some of the lower needs of the Ordensstaat -- disciplining workers, maintaining order in the conquered territories, and suppressing partisans -- to leave the real work to our pure-blooded German shock troops.\n\nAlas, for it seems that we have gotten all the use we can out of these units. Reports from the SD indicate that our allies are infested with plots of betrayal and sabotage, and may soon rebel all together. The time has come to liquidate these fools, degenerates who never should have been raised as high as true Aryans.\n\nHowever, we must move carefully. We dare not attack the collaborators all at once, to do so might cause a full-scale civil war. The first step is to lay the groundwork for further action by weakening the logistic supply-chains and readiness of our foes by covert action. Soon this obstacle will be dealt with, and the long march of the Aryan towards triumph can continue."

 BRG_expand_concealment_operations_text:0 "Expand Concealment Operations"
 BRG_expand_concealment_operations_desc:0 "Although the collaborator legions are no doubt weak and inferior, they were selected for their near-Aryan intelligence and so must be dealt with carefully. If they catch wind of our investigations our operations will be set back months if not years. In order to have a chance to catch our so called "allies" in wrongdoing and sabotage their ability to resist, we must meticulously and efficiently infiltrate our foes using SD agents honed by years of operations pursuant to the vision of our glorious Reichsführer-SS.\n\nFor the moment however, the priority is stealth. We will invite the leaders of SS-Charlemagne to wine and dine with us, the leaders of SS-Langemarck to share their finest pies and pastries, and the SS-Walloon to tour their gorgeous meadows and streams. All the while gathering info and evidence about their degenerate treachery. Then, when the moment comes, our strike will be swift, powerful, and decisive."

 BRG_accelerate_the_wait_desc:0 "Although some within the honorable ranks of the Ordensstaat grow impatient regarding our investigations into SS-Charlemagne and SS-Walloon, we know that revenge is a dish best served cold, and so will move carefully and meticulously. Although we have already devoted a great portion of our resources and ability towards these endeavors, we have not yet even begun to plumb the depths of our allies' cowardice and betrayal.\n\nSo however high the cost grows, we will make sure that our agents have whatever they need in order to discover the evidence we need to finish off our foes. Although a few might whine that the cost is too high, and these resources might be better spent furthering the economic strength of the Ordensstaat, or on the pacification of the Untermenschen, we know that our best chance is to defeat the legions in a single decisive blow, so that they pose no threat to the sustainability of the National Socialist Burgundian System, and its manifestation in our long term goals."

 BRG_the_final_moves_desc:0 "At last! After months of plotting, and careful maneuvering at every level, we are at last able to enforce our will upon our long-time allies in the SS-Walloon and SS-Charlemagne. Every level of the opposing legions is infiltrated by our forces, every one of their units has been carefully located, their weapon stores sabotaged, and their leaders primed for assassination.\n\nOur meticulous planning, and tenacity spanning decades of foolish denial of their inferior nature by the other legions is at last brought forth into a single brilliant stroke that will permanently decapitate this threat to our rule, and ensure that Himmler reigns supreme over the Ordensstaat for decades to come.\n\nAt our signal, our forces will begin the attack, and the enemy units and bases will quickly overwhelmed, their leaders killed, and their resources confiscated. Those few low-level troops believed to have some salvabagle potential of service in the Burgundian System will quickly be integrated into their new units, while most of their companions are sent to the work camps, to spend the rest of their lives helping to empower the Aryan race they had tried to destroy."

 BRG_our_top_priority_text:0 "Our Top Priority"
 BRG_our_top_priority_desc:0 "Perhaps above all else, the single-minded unity of the Ordensstaat has always been its greatest asset. It is what gives us the decisive advantage over our enemies -- who must spend months bickering in their senseless halls of "democracy" and deviant bastard forms of National Socialism -- well we whisper in their ears and prepare for our immediate victory. Since its creation, the sole and ultimate purpose of the Burgundian System has been The Plan, our moment, our perfection, our final solace.\n\nBut it seems that the Aryan Race must be tested once more before it becomes immortal. While the completion of the Reichsführer-SS's greatest project is of course our most crucial objective, it is equaled by the necessity of destroying the sneaking filthy disgusting degenerate "collaborators" who have for so longed poisoned the sanctity of the Ordensstaat as the only true manifestation of the Aryan. Caught unprepared and often unarmed, we may only need to crush them under our tank treads, saving our bullets for those who stand in our way around the globe."

 BRG_the_silenced_rooster_text:0 "The Silenced Rooster"
 BRG_the_silenced_rooster_desc:0 "To outside observers, the existence of the SS-Walloon brigade was a contradiction. An army made up of French-speaking Belgian nationalists, fighting alongside their long time Flemish opponents, and German occupiers. The apparent aberration of this force's existence was only enhanced by its continued existence with the implementation of the Ordensstaat, and the rise of the true National Socialist German Workers' Party therein. Little did the collaborators know that for once the degenerate outsiders were right. Their existence IS a contradiction -- a deviation from the true path of the Burgundian System. And at last, a contradiction that has been removed from the annals of the Aryan.\n\nAs expected, the Walloons were caught unaware by our attack. Deceived by our covert distraction-operations, and unable to compete with the fury and firepower of the SS in open battle, they put up little resistance to their former brothers. What weapons they possessed have been captured, their headquarters have been occupied, and their leadership has either surrendered or died fighting.\n\nAt long last, the Ordensstaat will no longer have to suffer these pathetic idiots -- more interested in their puny "nationalism" and small luxuries than in the completion of our true purpose. And indeed, our victory has made our path towards this purpose more certain than ever -- without such small distractions, the completion of the Plan lies within our grasp, we need only reach out and grasp it."

But the raids on the collaborators are of a sensitive nature -- and we must ensure that the units involved are simultaneously completely loyal and yet relatively expendable. Wherever possible, the collaborator legions will be set against each other, so that an absolute minimum of pure Aryan blood will be spent on this project.\n\nAs always, the superior numbers of the Aryan's enemies are betrayed by their discord and petty disputes. The fools will conveniently destroy each other so that in the end we will have only scraps of resistance to deal with -- a good training exercise for our pure blooded troops. After years of exhausting "tolerance" of non-Aryan soldiers, our patience will at last be rewarded with the final purification of the Ordensstaat, and the defeat of all remaining internal resistance.\n\nWe have come so far. We are so close. The moment of our triumph against the enemy within is upon us, and will be soon followed by the completion of The Plan and the destruction of all of our foes without."

All those who've defied us -- the degenerate filth who for so long pretended to be our equals, will finally learn their lesson that their is no race superior to the Aryan, and no army equal to the SS. But in the meantime, they must be made to think that they are still our bosom brothers and closest allies, and that our preparations against them are only routine exercises and standard manouvers.\n\nAs our soldiers move to their forward positions, our agents in the SD are hard at work making sure that the enemy is kept completely blind to our plans. Up until the final moments, the collaborator legions will be wining and dining our commanders, their lay-members playing dice with their German "comrades", and their inner leadership being set false reports of our upcoming offensive against "resistance elements", unsuspecting that it is they that will soon be eliminated.\n\nThe dream of a pure Aryan state, free of degeneracy and delusions has almost reached its final form. Once perfected, the power of the Ordensstaat will be unleashed upon the world, the Plan will be complete, and the long war of the pure races against their foes will end in victory."

Surely there are few species of man more immersed in degeneracy and cowardice than the French. And yet for a long time, the Charlemagnians were loyal allies. Against the Bolshevik menace, they stood by our side. During the first righteous attempt of the Reichsführer-SS to save his homeland, they were among the most effective and hard-fighting of the putschists. Even up until the moment of their defeat, the French legions thought of themselves as brothers to the Aryan soldiers, and perhaps even their equal.\n\nAlas, the degenerate bloodlines of the SS-Charlemagne doomed their loyalty and fighting capabilities from the start. Ever since we expanded the Ordensstaat to include the northwest territories of the former French State, our "allies" from the region have done nothing but whine about our "unjust" treatment of their race and homeland. As such, it was a sad necessity that they be eliminated.\n\nWhen the time came, the soldiers of the lion put up little resistance. Their claims of equality to the Aryan proved hollow as their soldiers ran in terror, and their bases quickly fell beneath the black helicopters of the Ordensstaat.\n\nNow we shall harvest the crop we have sown. The equipment and personnel formerly possessed by the SS-Charlemagne and considered still usable will be retooled for own use against our global enemies, while those unworthy will be sent to the foundries and camps respectively.\n\nWith our last internal enemies all but defeated, we can now turn to our true purpose -- the final defeat of the opponents of the Aryan worldwide."

BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_1:0 "Although Degrelle has his secret wells, his papers titled Opération Garde du Corps, or Operation Bodyguard, have still made their way into our hands. Unfortunately, the true purpose of his plans can't be understood due to a heavy amount of paranoid censoring obscuring the most useful information, but what is clear is that Degrelle is on the move and is making plans to control his Legion from a place of hiding."
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_2:0 "An old bunker located in Belgium from the Second Weltkrieg, it has become a hive of new activity for the Walloon Legion lately. Reports and travel records show Degrelle has begun turning this bunker into a secondary HQ, away from our prying eyes and hidden under a mountain of faked paperwork. We have three options for finding out its purpose:\n\n- Smuggling out any operation papers or records we might be able to access.\n\n- Planting an informant who could report on the activity at the site.\n\n- Prepare a quiet raid to ensure all the information ends up in our hands, no matter the trouble it might stir."
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_3:0 "A small cottage located in the Ardennes, it had been Degrelle's residence for 6 years but now appears to have been deserted by its owner. A skeleton crew of Wallonian guards ensure the spectre of it being lived in, but Degrelle himself hasn't been sighted in it or even the region for months. There are three options to investigate this abnormality:\n\n- Raid the house and disarm the few guards in a quiet attack in order to recover any clues that exist in the residence.\n\n- Focus our efforts on watching Walloon's military HQ located inside the complex complete with bugging to see if anything can be gleaned there.\n\n- Demolish the house after the aformentioned raid to completely uproot any hidden clues to Degrelle's trechery."
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_4:0 "Recently, there have been rumors and whispers of Degrelle acting strangely, always seemingly missing or occupied with some other buisness. Recently obtained meeting minute reports seem to suggest nothing is actually being done in the Legion as Degrelle and his commanders dissapear mid session, never to rejoin. We have three options to look into this development:\n\n- Check his medical records to see if some sort of mental defficiency has caused this recent change.\n\n- Plant a tracking device on his personal car which will allow us to track his movements when he deserts Legion buisness.\n\n- Break into his office and check his personal files to find out what exactly he has been spending all his time on."
BRG_DeGrelle_Evidence_Desc_5:0 "It appears that Degrelle is on the move, at least within the country. Obtained travel records show him spending an inane amount of Wallonian resources on train rides from Nanzig to Wallonien. The purpose behind these trips are unclear, but finding his destination and the reasoning behind the travel could go a long way to clearing his obstructions. We currently have three options available to that end:\n\n- Watch the trainyards and the surrounding areas to create a visual of Degrelle's movements.\n\n- Track his location through both agents and digital devices, which does increase the risk of being caught but would be more precise.\n\n- Interrogate the conductors for the various trains to see if they know anything about what has been going on."

BRG_DeGrelle_Leader_Desc_Investigation:0 "Leon Degrelle, fierce Wallonian Nationalist, has long been a thorn in our side with his fervent rejection of the concept of a Burgundian culture, but never before has he been so brazen. He and his Legion use Wallonien as their own state within a state, controlling every aspect of life while they lock us out, and then have the gall to stick their thumb out at official Legion business.\n\nUsually, this kind of trouble could be tolerated for the benefits he gives, but there have been whispers in the shadows of a secret plot being hatched by the highest echelons of Walloon, a plot that would result in the overthrow of our great leader. Unfortunately, too much relies on rumors and lies to be conclusive, hence why an investigation must be conducted into the degenerates. We have three options at our disposal to begin our search for the truth:\n\n- Bug Degrelle's military office in Nanzig to see if he slips up on the microphones.\n\n- Planting a mole within the Wallonian command structure could grant insight into their thinking.\n\n- A 24/7 tail of Degrelle and his lieutenants could go great ways to tracking down their movements and establishing a foundation of their operations."

##### Evidence Descs

BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_1:0 "In our most recent inventory reports, it has become disturbingly clear that our stores are coming up light, especially our industrial equipment. While it is no cause for alarm, we should begin looking into who has been behind these thefts. There are three options at our disposal:\n\n- Sweeping through the local worker dorms to ensure none are getting out of line.\n\n- Watching over the supply chain to see if any of the missing product turns up there.\n\n- Looking into their factory stations to see if any of it is hidden there.\n"
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_2:0 "It seems as if our supply bandits have been using commandeered material trucks to mask their operation, simply portraying themselves as people taking supplies to the dump and then stealing them for their own designs. Our options to put down these criminals are as follow:\n\n- Interrogate the driver of one of the stolen trucks, attempting to get names and information out of him.\n\n- Tracking the various trucks in an effort to learn where they are going.\n\n- Looking into the travel and cargo manifests to glean what they are up to.\n\n"
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_3:0 "Inspecting the nearby factory complexes have yielded in an interesting discovery: some of the workers have been collecting waste materials from an upstream manufacturing plant. While normally this would be no cause for alarm, this specific plant dealt with weapons manufacturing and as such its waste has unually high concentrations of gunpowder and sulfur. That, along side the recent theft of extra pipes from our stockpiles, could hint at a much more violent situation. In order to head off this destructive plot, we have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Watch over the garbagemen that clean up those materials and see if they are involved.\n\n- Look into the disposal system and where the materials are supposed to go, and if they even ended up there.\n\n- Test the waste sludge to try and determine exactly what the workers wanted with it.\n"
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_4:0 "It appears as if the conspiracy is much larger then we thought. The funneled supplies from our camps has been discovered in a decommissioned warehouse a half hour drive away from the main industrial center. The purpose or function of the warehouse is unknown, but it is clear some sort of manufacturing base has been set up inside to utilize the stolen materials. The current operators of the facility are also a mystery, but our cameras have spotted a poppy flower mark on some of the shipping leaving the building. To get to the bottom of this, we have three options:\n\n- Install secret cameras outside the facility to see if we can capture any enlightening activity.\n\n- Track the logistics of their operation to find our where it's all going.\n\n- Sift through their disposal system in order to find out what they are making and why."
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_5:0 "Tracking the cargo coming out of the Warehouse has led to an interesting discovery: all of it is being delivered to a hidden safehouse located in the slums of Hafenstadt, marked only with a small poppy decoration on the door. Intelligence reports that were taken from Germany during our seperation show the building used to be a Resistance safehouse for downed pilots under the "Shelburne Line", and it appears as if this new group has co-opted and expanded it. While the discovery of this safehouse confirms the Resistance is not as dead as we thought, it also presents a unique opportunity to finally crack their defenses and end it once and for all. To achieve that goal, we have three options:\n\n- Stake out the building and the surrounding block to find any suspicious activity.\n\n- Track the residents of the apartment complex the safehouse is in to see if anyone could be brought in for "questioning"\n\n- Raid the building and secure it for ourselves to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible."
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_6:0 "The raid of the supposed "safehouse" was quick and easy, resulting in minimal causalties for our men, but what the house reveals dwarfs any deaths. Located underneath a rug that was upturned in the fighting is a trap door that opens a tunnel leading directly to a sewer line, carved into the building itself. We do not know what lies down there and many of our men are reluctant to venture into the dark, but this could finally be the key that cracks this case open. We have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Searching the catacombs in order to find out how the Resistance has survived under our noses.\n\n- Set a trap and wait for them to come back up to see if we can capture any of their operatives.\n\n- Search the sewers to find if their operation has been extended under the city."
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_7:0 "Deep within the catacombs after hours of expoloring, our agents have found a bombshell. Located within a hidden alcove not marked on any maps lay the headquarters of our hidden Resistance, apparently named Red Poppy. Inside was a printing press, weapon chaches made of pipe bombs and crudely constructed guns, as well as something incredibly interesting: a board filled with information on the Rodomo camp and ways to attack it.\n\nThe group is obviously planning something big, but the only lead we have right now to explaining what that plan might be is a coded message taped up in the center, written in a code never before seen by our department and signed with a mysterious "H". To get to the bottom of this bombshell, we have three options:\n\n- Try and decode the message with brute force methods in order to find out what is going on.\n\n- Find out where the message came from or was sent to see if we can locate the leader of the operation.\n\n- Look into the "H" that wrote it."
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_8:0 "In our search of the sewers, we found some disturbing files floating in the water. They appear to be targeted propaganda from a group called Red Poppy calling in French on the workers of Rodomo and the camps to rise up in rebellion when the time comes to restore their homeland and future. This would explain the recent spate of accidents and low morale in the camps, but also proposes a new quesion. What more does Red Poppy have up their sleeves, and how far along are they?"
BRG_RPY_Evidence_Desc_9:0 "It looks like this charade can finally come to an end. After painstakingly researching both this group, the code used, and every other piece of evidence gathered before, we have deduced that Henri Grouès is the leader of Red Poppy. A former priest who led Jews out of our grasp during the original occupation, he has recently resurrected the long-dead Resistance with the purpose of galvanazing the workers of Rodomo to rebel. Obviously, he must die for his transgressions, but it must be soon, lest his fiery words set the entire Ordensstaat alight."

### Evidence Descs


BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_1:0 "The Charlemagne Legion, led by Christian de la Mazière has long been our potentially most dangerous foe. Dedicated entirely to creating a new ultranationalistic French culture, they obeyed our orders when the only controlled a patch of their homeland, but with the recent acquisition of the new French territory, Mazière has stopped listening. He and his followers have begun slowly and subtly slipping into defiance, and it must come to an end. To begin our investigation into the disloyal Legion, we have three avenues:\n\n- Look into the rumors that swirl around Mazière's drug use and undevotion to Burgundian ideals.\n\n- Observe the newly conquered territories where Mazière and his men have assumed more and more control.\n\n- Investigate the reports of near nightly disturbances in Charlemagne's new headquarters of Nord-Paris."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_2:0 "It seems like this rumor is in fact true. Digging into Mazière's personal life has revealed a disturbing secret: both he and his Legion have gotten addicted to the large stores of meth left over as stimulant from the Second Weltkrieg. Medical and suspect reports seem to indicate that Mazière lost control of his personal struggle long ago and now commands the legion with a loose fist, but most of them are too high to notice. Obviously such degeneracy should be impossible, especially considering the stores from the 1940s should have run out long ago. To continue to dig into this and find out where they are getting their fix, we have three options:\n\n- Stake out the streets around Charlemagne's headquarters in order to identify the key players.\n\n- Analyze the crystals ourselves to find out where the drugs are from.\n\n- Bribe the dealers with "immunity" to get them to tell us who is buying and why."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_3:0 "After anaylzing the meth crystals used by Charlemagne, our labs have found some interesting information. They drugs are incredibly rough and diluted, made with improper chemsitry and chemicals that has killed their potency and made them more dangerous than enjoyable. The conclusion from the lab is that Charlemagne is making its own meth in a lab tucked away in their territory, explaining how they're able to extend their stockpiles. However, we must still find and locate proof of their betrayal of their supposed "ideals", and have three options:\n\n- Map out their distribution networks to track the flow of drugs.\n\n- Dig into the paperwork used to fund and supply this operation.\n\n- Search for and find this lab complex that has existed under our noses."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_4:0 "Bribing the dealers and integrating ourselves into the drug distribtion network that keeps Charlemagne awake has yielded some interesting results. The enlisted men and officers of Charlemagne seem to use the vast majority of their time throwing wild parties filled with drugs, alcohol, and other forbidden substances instead of performing their actual duties. It would make wonderful blackmail to tie Mazière to our hip once more, but in order to do that we must have conclusive proof. To obtain that, we have three options:\n\n- Install secret cameras in their clubhouses to try and catch something on video.\n\n- Begin a deep cover operation with one of our operatives and have him infiltrate the sites in order to get proof.\n\n- Tap the phone lines to see if any information is exchanged there."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_5:0 "After much digging, we have finally found the Holy Grail: Signed orders from Mazière himself authorizing the construction of both a drug production facility and receipts for the money used on his parties. They were hidden well, behind many false starts and cold trails, but we now have them in our hand to use at our pleasure."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_6:0 "In the dead of night, a strike team went into the slums of Hafenstadt and was able to wrest control of the production laboratory away from Charlemagne after finding its location from a few persuaded officers. Tearing it apart, it not only confirmed our earlier suspicions of homecooked meth, but also yielded something disturbing: apparently Charlemagne has been creating their own arsenal as well, having a process for everything from making gunpowder to the guns themselves. This disturbing element of the discovery should be acted upon soon, before the trechery becomes too much to bear."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_7:0 "It appears as if our phone line taps have picked up something interesting. Mazière and his ilk are apparently not satisfied with parties, but have set up a prostitution ring to cater to his officers and Frenchmen he considers "worthy". Seemingly not notcing how this clashes with the founding ideals of the Ordensstaat, he set up the ring a long time ago and has been using its funds to finance his various extravaganzas."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_8:0 "\nOn our recent fine-toothed examination on the integration of the new territories, we found exactly what we expected. Lackluster efforts made to foster a true Burgundian culture and the ideals of National Socalism, lazy policing practices, and a horribly mismanaged funding situation. While that would be enough to court martial everyone put in charge of this operation, it isn't the most disturbing find. That would have to be that it appears as if Charlemagne has actually actively hindered any progress being made, which must be investigated immediately. We have three options to do just that:\n\n- Spy on the Culture Officers assigned to this area.\n\n- Comb over the budget to find where the money has gone.\n\n- Check on the Germanization programs that were supposed to be implemented and learn why they never were."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_9:0 "\nThe re-education system for our new territories was supposed to be a model for our glorious future, but instead under Charlemagne's watch has become one of bloat and innefeciency. Administrators regulary complain of supply shortages for German books and language materials, children not even showing up, and worse. They pin the cause of this problem to the complete lack of funding to complete any of their instructions, but what exactly it has been used for is an unanswered question. This problem must be looked into if we are to get to the bottom of this mystery, and to do that we have three options available:\n\n- Investigate the school systems themselves to root out the cause of this problem.\n\n- Review the supply inventory to try and determine where the missing materials have gone.\n\n- Trace the cash flow into the program to find where it has all gone."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_10:0 "\nIt appears as if the closer look made into the cultural Germanization progress has only confirmed our latest suspicions. They were mostly faked, relying on numbers that seemed to come from thing air and using statistics that were physically impossible. Not only that, but it also appears that none of the materials bookmarked for the operation were even used or still remain in inventory, a very suspicious development. To further our investigation into these unusal actions, we have three options:\n\n- Look into the French Language Subjugation program to find out why it hasn't been progressed.\n\n- Interrogate the officers in charge of these "reports".\n\n- Check over the teaching curriculum to find out why it has been changed from our orders."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_11:0 "After digging into the missing supplies, the reason behind their disappearence has been revealed to be even more bizarre then the initial quesiton. Our officers caught some unmarked guards, but obviously of French nature, in a warehouse burning German books made especially for the re-unification effort to power some sort of contraption. After interrogation, it became apparent that this was something that had been going on for a while, all under the watch and uncaring attitude of the commanding officers. Considering the implication this had on the program as a whole, it would behoove us to continue this lead, and there are three possible avenues:\n\n- Question the teachers who were supposed to receive these supplies and ask them whether they knew anything about what was going on.\n\n- Investigate their power needs and why they would need to burn books for it.\n\n- Uncovering their motive, even figuring out if powering something was just a ruse, could do great things for our investigation."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_12:0 "It seems as if the reason behind the school system's failures has been discovered: a complete and total lack of teachers, who have seemingly disappeared without a trace. Looking into the reports, it has become clear there is a pattern at work, with many of them simply just not showing up one day after the occupation, taking their books and knowledge, and in some cases, even their students. While the purpose behind this isn't yet clear, the fact that so many highly praised and payed teachers simply went under the radar is an incredibly dangerous thing for our programs and must be investigated. We have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Search the dorms near the schools and interrogate anyone who is left to find where they've gone.\n\n- Look further into the paperwork to see if there are any more patterns to discern.\n\n- Comb over the schools themselves to locate any clues at what they could be doing or where they are."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_13:0 "The final piece of the puzzle has been laid down, and it is quiet possibly more shocking then what could have been imagined. In our search for the missing teachers, students, and even materials, our agents stumbled upon hidden, funded, French language schools located around both the new territories and even Nanzig itself. Ostensibly set up by Charlemagne as a desperate ploy to keep their revered French culture alive, students were being taught curriculum glorifying the past French empires with specific anti-Germanic material thrown in as well. They seemed to have no shortage of materials, including the unconfiscated and missing French books, that would explain the anemic funding elsewhere. If nothing else, this proves Charlemagne must be dealt with as soon as possible. before the Hydra becomes too large to control."

BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_15:0 "In our search for the truth, we seemingly have stumbled upond a great discovery: French languange and history books, which were supposedly confiscated on direct orders by Charlemagne, were in fact not, and they have been missing from the stockpile for months. The disappearance of thousands of books teaching and praising the culture of degeneracy would normally not be such a huge deal, but they could potentially lead to an entire generation turning their backs on our system if we do not act quickly. We have three options available:\n\n- Look into the manufacturers of the books to find out what was in them and how they could hurt us.\n\n- Examine the authors of the books to see if they have a role in this situation.\n\n- Begin investigating where the books disappeared to and why."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_16:0 "Looking into the reports of nightly disturbances in Nord-Paris have revealed an interesting phenomenon. It appears if as the entire upper officer corps of the Charlemagne Legion meets up in various buildings around the headquarters every weekend. The exact purpose of this gathering is unknown, but the large amount of limousines, guard trucks, and people has attracted our eyes to the scene, and it appears as if it is worth looking in to. We have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Sweep the surrounding area around their headquarters to see if we can find any leftovers or clues of and for their engagements.\n\n- Survey the transportation patterns of the officers to see if they are meeting up anywhere else.\n\n- Question the locals who have been making these reports and see if they know anything."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_17:0 "After anaylzing the piece of art, we have come to the conclusion that it is in fact Napoleon Crossing the Alps. It was initially unknown how such a high quality picture could have been put on the ticket, so an inquiry into where the painting was located was made. After checking on the stock of paintings confiscated during the initial invasion of France for being deemed too nationalistic, we have realized it has been missing for months. However, it was never requested for removal or destruction, seemingly instead having disappeared without a trace. No one knows the current whereabout of the piece, but if it appeared on this art, it must be somewhere within Burgundy. To further this investigaton, we have three options:\n\n- Check on the storage site to see if any evidence still lies there.\n\n- Review the transportation records of the facility to pinpoint down who was there at the time of disappearence, and even, who took it.\n\n- Look into the rest of the collection to find if anything else has been stolen or used."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_18:0 "Our initial sweep of the area led us into the sewers, trashcans, and apartments of Nord-Paris, but they also gave us some trash from the gatherings that became our treature. Located in a bin outside one of the meeting houses was what appears to be a ticket to some sort of attraction. It bears both the mark of Charlemagne, is written in coded French, and has a large painting as its centerpiece. None of our officers can cipher what it means or what it is used for, but we have three options to try and answer those questions:\n\n- Attempt to crack the code of the writing to try and find out what its purpose is.\n\n- Find where it was made and see if that yields any clues.\n\n- Look into the piece of art to see if that has any signifigance."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_19:0 "The attempt at finding out where the tickets came from has succeeded with flying colors. Our agents raided the suspected warehouse yesterday to find a mobile but crude printing press hard at work, making another batch of similar tickets. No one was caught during the raid, denying us any human resources to question, but the entire workshop, including past prints, materials, etc, are all there. Still unknown however, are the purpose of this operation, which must be found out if we are to get to the bottom of this. We have three options avalible:\n\n- Using the old prints, check the history of what this facility has made to see if that unveils any clues.\n\n- Examine the equipment used to construct the press.\n\n- Look into the supply chain to find out how the press got the needed materials to run."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_20:0 "It appears as if we finally have found the breakthrough we desired. Our agents have recovered an invitation to something called simply "This Week's Gala", adorned with French art and bearing the crest of Charlemagne. It gives instructions on how to enter, what should be worn (tuxedos and masks), what should be brought, but not what to expect, and as such, this represents a dangerous but lucrative opportunity to final crack the case wide open. We could:\n\n- Plant loyal moles inside the building when the Gala is to take place, trying to see if they can get any information.\n\n- Install surveillance equipment before the gathering to see if they pick up anything.\n\n- Send in our agents themselves using the invitation to gain access to the event."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_21:0 "After looking into the transportation records of the stolen artwork, we have made an amazing discovery: Charlemagne has been using our own trucks to convoy out pieces of art from the destruction pile to their own safehouses located in the new territories. Based on the effort needed to conceal such an operation, we must assume it is both a regular operation and one that everyone knows about, meaning that it must have been approved by the officers themselves. To look further into this new development, we have three options:\n\n- Investigate the commanders in charge of the stolen APCs to see what they know and what they will reveal.\n\n- Track the movements of the convoys to discern any patterns or to see where they will go next.\n\n- Take the vehicles in for "repairs" in order to take them apart and see if any hidden evidence lies within them."
BRG_CHR_Evidence_Desc_22:0 "The final piece of the puzzle fell into place last night, as the secret of the disturbances was finally revealed. We now have confirmation that Mazière himself has been setting up a weekly high society gala for Charlemagne officials devoted to examining and glorifying French culture. They meet at different storehouses to avoid suspicion but have nationalistic paintings, specially prepared delicacies usually banned in other parts of Burgundy, and even history lessons carted in to cater to the officer corps and their friends. Mazière himself often attends the events with an escort and seems to be the worst defender when it comes to sticking to a Burgundian diet, often gorging himself on wine and cheese, but that pales in comparison to the depravity of the Gala as a whole. They will not escape this unpunished."

#### Descriptions

BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_1:0 "Although the outward signs of trechery from the days of Degrelle have once again faded below the surface, the Walloon Legion, now led by the incompetent Jean-François Thiriart, still represents a challenge to us. While Thiriart swears his and his countrymen's loyalty to our cause, we know that there is little love between the Aryan and the Wallonian cultures, something that has manifested itself as simple ambilvence in the Legion. They care not for our attempts to create a true Burgundian society, but seem instead content to waste away the days doing nothing but dreaming of their own independent state. And such thoughts, if allowed to run rampant, could be very dangerous. We already know deep resentment and anger towards us Germans runs widely through their organization, no matter how much Thiriart might ignore it, as evidenced during the hunt for Degrelle, and it is unknown what else they might be planning in the shadows. The only clear thing is something is afoot. To further look into this suspicion, we have three options:\n\n- Look into the well documented morale problem among their average soldiers, which has led to some disturbing behavior like desertment and apathy for our cause.\n\n- Review their command structure and try to glean some information from the officers in charge.\n\n- Review the Legion's finances to see if that yields any clues."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_2:0 "Trying to penetrate Walloon's officer corps has revealed something interesting: it appears as if Walloon's high command acts near independently of Thiriart and the men assigned to him. Orders are followed on paper, but in reality, the true nerve center of Walloon is a centralized, insulated command post far off in the Ardennes, away from the influence of Thiriart and ourselves. This not only confirms Thiriart's incompetence but also gives us an opportunity to dig deeper into what Walloon might be up to. To do so, we have three options:\n\n- Send a detachment to confiscate their files and see if anything noteworthy comes to light.\n\n- Search the dumpsters and waste disposal plants around the site to see if they have been disposing of any sensitive material.\n\n- Bug their communications array and listen in to see if anything catches our ears."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_3:0 "When the files first crossed the desks of our forensic experts, they were intially discarded as clever fakes. But as more corroborating evidence was uncovered in the trove of documents taken from Walloon's secret headquarters, we have come to the grim conclusion that Léon Degrelle is alive. The entire bunker scene that our men found is now known to have been just that: an elebatorly set up deception that has allowed Degrelle to operate under the radar and without suspicion. We do not know where he is, what he has done since then, or if he even has any remaining connections to the Legion, but it is certain that this development is nothing but bad."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_4:0 "While many were unsure that digging through a trash heap would give us anything usable, they have been proven wrong with the discovery of Rexist propaganda in the headquarters waste bins. These pamphlets expousing the beliefs of the former Rexist Party, led by Degrelle before the war, seem to have been both newly printed and directed at the foot soldiers of the Walloon Legion as a way to combat our influence. Interestingly, it appears as if there is a printer's symbol in the shape of a crown stamped on the back of each sheet, which might allow us to track down whoever has been creating them. To further this line of evidence, we have three options:\n\n- Analyze the messages of the pamphlet in order to understand what we are fighting against.\n\n- Find the manufacturer of the pamphlet by tracking down the orgin of the printer's symbol.\n\n- Look into who has been distributing the pamphlets to the Wallonian troops, and how."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_5:0 "It appears as if listening in on Walloon's plans will be harder then anticipated. While attempting to place a bug on their local radio tower, we discovered that they are using radio scramblers and other counter-intelligence measures to safeguard their transmissions. The scramblers seem to only be activated when they are not using they are transmitting messages from outside their headquarters local systems, adding another piece to the puzzle. Obviously, this is something only done when there is something to hide, meaning that breaking through their cover could yield some groundbreaking evidence. To further this operation, we have three options:\n\n- Interrogate the radio operators at Walloon's headquarters to find out what they know about the system.\n\n- Track the source of the interference and find where the scramblers are being kept.\n\n- Decrypt the intercepted but scrambled messages to see if anything can be gleaned from them."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_6:0 "Looking further into Walloon's off-the-record operations has yielded the location of an old safehouse, apparently one that was abandoned until Thiriart's takeover necessitated a place to hide the true work of the Legion. Located only a short while away from the secret headquarters, the safehouse is continuously guarded by Walloon's shock troops and other security measures, implying that it holds something valuable. We have three options at our disposal to attempt to find out what that valuable something is:\n\n- Raid the safehouse with our guards in an attempt to stop them from destroying any valuable evidence inside.\n\n- Stake out the safehouse to track the coming and going of the various officers.\n\n- Infiltrate the safehouse with our deep cover operators in order to recover any evidence inside."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_7:0 "The raid on the Wallonian command's safehouse has given us a biggest break yet, in the form of coded maps they were trying to to destroy as our agents barged in. Recovered in the nick of time and with only minimal fire damage, they appear to be navigation maps that are focused on the Ardennes region, with many symbols and codes we do not understand at this time. However, most of them seem to be directional, pointing towards a big structure marked simply with an X that does not appear on any of our previously recovered documents. To further look into this development, we have three options:\n\n- Find the big structure marked on the map using the directional references to see what it might be holding\n\n- Decode the legend and the various symbols in order to glean the true purpose of the maps.\n\n- Question the officers who were in possesion of it at the time of the raid in order to see if they will give up any new information."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_8:0 "Many thought he was still dead, even after we learned that his death was faked, but we now have conclusive proof that Degrelle is alive and has hidden himself away in a complex located deep in the Ardennes. Nicknamed the "Lion's Den" by our investigators, its existence was only known to the upper echelon of Walloon's command as well as the elite shock troops guarding it, written off as an old storage shed on the official maps of the region. According to our observers who both watch the complex day and night and have begun digging into its history, Degrelle has been there ever since his escape, commanding the Legion secretly from behind its doors. He is constantly watched by a detatchment of Walloon's best and most loyal men, who swear loyalty to him personally and represent the most fearsome fighting force outside our own ranks. While there is still much we do not know, one thing is for certain: Degrelle will not go without a fight, and any attempts to put him down for good should be planned carefully."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_9:0 "A further look into Walloon's vehicle use has led to a disturbing discovery: they have acquisitioned a large number of trucks to ferry as of yet unknown supplies around their state. Mainly going to unit headquarters and supply dumps, it appears as if the convoys run every week to the same exact places, using faked orders that, on inspection, appear to be from people and officers that don't even exist. Their supply manifests too are blacked out on the reports we requested from them, which only furthers our suspicion that something is indeed going on. To look into this situation further, we have three options:\n\n- Find who authorized these operations and the faking of papers by listening in on the radio communications the next time the convoys run.\n\n- Look over the paperwork again to see if anything new can be gleaned from them.\n\n- Investigate this hidden cargo they haul to all the different supply and command posts."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_10:0 "Investigating the disappearances and mutinies in the Walloon ranks has yielded an interesting turn of events. It appears as if that isn't the case as first thought, but instead Walloon's leadership corps has been taking away soldiers under the radar for a new, unapproved training regimen. They have been learning both new combat skills, with specializations in undercover operations, and more interesting, trade skills such as manufacturing and machine shop. To look into this further, we have three options:\n\n- Observe the drills secretly to see if anything else is going on.\n\n- Question the trainers on the purpose of these exercises.\n\n- Check on the supply inventory for the program in order to find where they are getting the materials for all these programs."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_11:0 "It appears as if Walloon's men really haven't been shirking their work, but instead putting it to use in previously undisclosed factory complexes burried deep in Wallonia. Using their new industrialized training, these former foot soldiers are officially stationed in the facotry to "guard" them, but in fact are being put to work in order to create a new class of weapons and armements for the Legion, outside of our control. While this in itself is not an afront to our authority, the fact that Walloon wants to have its own industrial base outside of our grasp and has been lying about where their soldiers have been does not bode well for the future. To continue investigating the factories, we have three options:\n\n- Find the motive behind setting up a separate industrial base and see if it has a greater purpose then what we know now.\n\n- Look into the distribution of all the weapons and equipment being produced to see if that leads anwyhere.\n\n- Identify the supply chain in order to identify where they are getting all their materials from."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_12:0 "Even before Degrelle's disappearence and Thiriart's inability to lead, Walloon always had problems with morale and dedication to the Burgundian cause. However, it seems to have multiplied out of control in recent months. Men simply don't show up for drills, training, or inspections. Commanders take weeks to return calls or carry out the most mundane orders. Such flaunting of disobedience would normally be cause to purge the entire Legion from our ranks, but the mystery of Walloon's attitude problem comes from the fact that they appear to almost always be in a constant state of work. Their vehicle records show they are in use near constantly, ferrying supplies all around the legion, their commanders report (when they bother to) that their men are always busy, but it's almost like none of it is actually being done for us. Which begs the question, what are they working on? To answer that inquiry, we have three options at our disposal:\n\n- Study their recent behavior and try to pinpoint any patterns.\n\n- Investigate the disappearances and mutinies among their men and see if it's for a greater purpose then currently thought.\n\n- Look into the vehicle use to try and figure out why they are using them so much."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_13:0 "The reason behind Thiriart's inability to control his Legion have become rapidly clear with the discovery of the latest piece of evidence: Degrelle has been communicating with his high command on a specialized and secret frequency. The only reason we know it is him is through his repeated use of his pre-disappearence sign off, which was "retired" respectfully by the high command after the War. While we still do not know the contents of the messages Degrelle has been sending, this does confirm that he is alive and the true person in charge of the Legion, meaning they still are as a grave of a threat as earlier. To investigate this disturbing turn of events, we have three options:\n\n- Find the transmission source of Degrelle's messages so we can try and locate his whereabouts.\n\n- Look into the officers who also are on the secret channel in order to see what they might know.\n\n- Confiscate the radios connected to the network and take them apart in order to see if they are hiding anything else."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_14:0 "A look into Walloon's supply manifests have given us a peculiar find. There seems to be a massive amount of unmarked arms caches in their stockpiles, loaded with the latest weapoary and spread far and wide across the region. They are concentrated at the unit level supply dumps and only the commanding officer has the key to unlock them, but what has been the most interesing find is the explanation for when they should do just that. According to a stolen order from Walloon high command, one not signed by Thiriart, the local commanders are only supposed to distribute the weapons "when the time comes". What this means, our investigators have no idea, but it certainly does not bode well. To look into this further, we have three options:\n\n- Search the supply depots to see if anything else can be learned from them.\n\n- Find the source of all these weapons to see if they are manufacturing anything else.\n\n- Search for more records in order to find out what and when "the time comes" is."
BRG_WLN_Evidence_Desc_15:0 "As layed out in the summary of a report on its feasability, Operation Leopold is the plan for a Wallonian revolt against the Burgundian System in order to both dispose of the Führer and establish a free and independent Wallonian state. It seems as if it was only created in the aftermath of our war with France and directed by Degrelle himself from hiding, putting together the final pieces of his plans. It has become increasingly clear that Walloon is working towards the prerequisites for carrying out the Operation with great and worrying speed, stockpiling weapons and creating their own industrial base in order to have a fighting chance against our might, which means we must shut it down as soon as we can, before the situation spirals out of control. To do that, we have three options:\n\n- Bug its authors in order to locate Degrelle, the chief architect of and the lynchpin behind the plan.\n\n- Find where the memos for the plan were made and distributed.\n\n- Investigate the officers listed as essential to the operation to see if they will give up any information, willingly or unwillingly."

 BRG_political.1.t:0 "The Wait"
 BRG_political.1.desc:0 "The meeting would take place in a cold, barely furnished basement. God forbid a non-German was sat in a decent meeting room with something a little nicer than a metal folding chair on a bare cement floor with two hanging light bulbs. Degrelle sighed, pulling out a cigarette. He snuck a glance at the other two collaborators. His company was as bad as the furnishing.\n\nChristian de la Mazière, commander of the Charlemagne Legion sat to Degrelle's right. His incessant twitching made him appear nervous. Degrelle knew better though; the man was as high on methamphetamines he could be without being oblivious to the world, his bloodshot eyes confirming his suspicions. Straight across was Bert Eriksson, the fanatical Flemish leader of the Langemarck Legion, all around an unpleasant asshole. As if to prove Degrelle right, Eriksson continued to stare the Wallonian leader down.\n\n"If I didn't know better, Bert, I'd say you're trying to woo me like one of your kaaskoppen." Degrelle shot out suddenly, raising his head and returning the thousand yard stare Eriksson had been giving him since he entered. Eriksson rose an eyebrow and blinked, the slur catching him off balance. He sat back in his chair wordlessly and continued to stare. Degrelle mirrored Eriksson's movements; a win was a win.\n\n"Hey." Mazière called out. "Why are we down here if we're supposed to meet with Der Reichsführer?" Degrelle shrugged, spitting out and stomping his cigarette. Eriksson shifted his gaze and stared down Mazière.\n\n"God, you're so unpleasant, Eriksson. It was just a question." Mazière sighed, leaning back into his chair. Though Degrelle and Eriksson both projected calm, their thoughts said otherwise. If Himmler was meeting them, why the hell were they sitting in this musty basement? For another five minutes they idled before the door opened with a screech. A young woman in SS garb strutted in, holding three binders.\n\n"Gentlemen," she began, in perfect German.

Many of his sentences didn't even make sense; Eriksson would have thought the man was mad and talking to himself if he didn't make pauses for Eriksson to contribute, if one could call answering "Yeah" or "Okay" contributing to a discussion on race theory. Eriksson leaned back on the leather chair and took in the scene. At least this conference room wasn't tucked away in a dark basement. Nice wood table, leather chairs. He leaned back farther into the chair. Yep. This is how a proper SS man should be treated. As Mazière continued to babble, the door to the room swung wide open; the Reichsführer strolled in, his presence dominating the room.\n\nHeinrich Himmler simply strode in; the two men quickly snapping to attention.

Both men shook their heads, while Mazière babbled something to the effects of 'no'. Himmler gave Mazière a look, shutting him up.\n\n"You are both here so I could tell the next phase of the plan in person." Himmler paused, and glanced at the two men.

Armel stood aside as the man wielded it, fingering the revolver concealed in his jacket.

"An issue with the older model too. You know your guns." Armel said nothing, but he relaxed. It was rare to get a compliment from an SS man. The blond man tossed the rifle to one of his comrades, then motioned to the ten crates laying on the dock. He picked up a bag that lay by the truck and handed it to the Breton. It was heavy; forty pounds at least. He peeked inside the bag; it was full of wedding bands, necklaces, and various small pieces of gold. Armel knew only too well what they were; sometimes ignorance was bliss, he would never forget that the seemingly random gold bits were in fact once dental fillings. As the crew of Germans loaded up the last crate of rifles, the spokesman walked up to the Breton.\n\n"How many more of these guns can you get us?" Armel stood for a moment before responding.

He felt he was on the cusp of discovering something grand, he just needed to find some sort of hint of proof to verify the suspicions he had held ever since the less-than-enthusiastic commitment of the native divisions during the Western Security Operation. Their continued backwardness and rejection of German culture was consistently annoying him, and their flouting of their autonomy from the Germanic SS was intolerable, even for the seemingly loyal like Charlemagne's de la Mazière and Bert Eriksson of Langemarck. A few minutes later his secretary returned with the files. He did not need more than an hour to find what he was looking for. Allowing himself a brief, almost unnoticeable smile at the thought of finally crushing a tangible resistance once more, the Reichsführer retrieved a red pencil from his desk and underlined the word "Rodomo."

Do we think it is just disobedient workers wanting to resell it to some Bretons, or could the Resistance be involved?"\n\nThe Reichsführer's brow furrowed, something Peiper had not seen in many years of his generally stoic expression. "Of a sort. Why don't you tell him, Müller?"\n\nThe RHSA chief cleared his throat. "The Reichsführer has correctly identified something we have... overlooked. The thefts happen at a much greater intensity when guards from the native legions are present. Not to mention industrial accidents. Deaths from falling material, vehicles breaking down, slaves escaping... "\n\nPeiper took a seat. "Curious indeed. Could they really be trying to challenge our authority?"\n\n"If they are, I am sure many of our men would find it most amusing to face a well trained and prepared foe again, not the rabble of the French State or rioting slaves," the Reichsführer remarked, his furrowed brow relaxing and turning to a hint of a pleased expression, "so I want you and Wolff to take charge of organizing an investigative team, Peiper.

The rational side of him hated these moments, where the mask of the Reichsführer slipped ever so slightly and glimmers of old Heinrich bubbled forth in his mind normally filled with grandiose plans and racial theory. Thoughts of his daughter, Gudrun, of his home in Bavaria, even of his early skepticism about the old Führer. As usual, he cursed himself for indulging in such un-Aryan weakness, and even considered leaving his spartan bedchamber and go to bed in the grand bedroom of the castle, to remind himself of who he was.\n\nThen came the part he loathed most of all, the doubts. This wavering was something his subordinates must never be allowed to see, under any circumstance. Usually he was able to beat these thoughts down within seconds, bludgeoning them with the steely logic of racial imperatives and realpolitik, but lately one problem kept badgering him, those accursed Walloons and their clear disloyalty. Some nights it had even taken him several minutes to put them from his mind, a level of unease and distraction he had not experienced since the forties.

The Reichsführer-SS had ordered the liquidation of the entire legion, and prioritized the capture or elimination of Leon DeGrelle.\n\nCURRENT STATUS: Through unknown methods, Walloon elements learned of our planned raid on DeGrelle's bunker - the "Lion's Den" - which we had located, and immediately informed DeGrelle. The raid was triggered prematurely, but the bunker was successfully stormed. Unfortunately, DeGrelle escaped, along with his inner circle.\n\nOther high-ranking Walloon officers also became aware of our operation, and fled before they could be detained. The Walloon Legion has now shifted into full-scale insurgency, and begun engaging SS units across the Ordensstaat. We believe DeGrelle has recalled most of the Legion to Belgium territory, and charged the Legion with distributing Belgium nationalist propaganda and pressing Belgium men into service.\n\nWe judge that the Walloon Legion lacks the numbers or support of the Belgium population to maintain a sustained insurgency. The Legion will be dismantled, but with Walloon soldiers concentrating in Belgium cities, it will take a sustained effort to fully dislodge. It is recommended that all loyalist Legions and SS forces are mobilized, as the risk of a sustained Wallon insurgency led by DeGrelle threatens the Ordensstaat's stability.\n\nThe termination of Leon DeGrelle has been elevated to an URGENT priority.\n\nHEIL HIMMLER"

Mazière was subsequently alerted, and fled, along with his inner circle.

We believe that Charlemagne is pressing French men into service, while distributing disinformation on French racial and cultural superiority. We do not believe they are being supported by French resistance elements.\n\nSS forces are dislodging the isolated insurgents in the cities, and moving to disrupt Charlemagne's efforts to seize the rural French outskirts.

It is clear that this was no partisan effort. The coordination of the attacks was unthinkable, and the explosives used were clearly of a high grade.\n\nThe only that remains is: who? Who has the capacity and intelligence to cripple our fuel network overnight? As of now, our only estimation is that this was an undertaking by either the Americans or South Africans, using the vast American intelligence networks to determine at which arteries they were going to strike.\n\nWe cannot sustain such a strike again. Already, critical sorties are being scuppered due to the mass inability to take flight. Should this continue, American bombers will be hovering over Windhuk in a week."

Just days ago, seemingly systematically, roads, bridges, and canal locks began to detonate, as if on cue. Within hours, our canals were rendered useless.

As war rages in Africa, Hüttig has begun to lose not only his temper, but his mind. This shall work beautifully. For every day the war drags on, and for every bullet of effort Ostafrika contributes, Hüttig is driven closer and closer to a mental break which could cost the lives of millions, or perhaps even more.\n\nIt is time to reach out to Hüttig, to let him know that his Burgundian masters are soon to arrive with direct front line support. Without a doubt, he will throw his forces into a frenzy once we arrive, to prove himself to the Reichsführer-SS and to the Reich as a whole.

Our friends in Burgundy have reached out to Reichskommissar Hüttig himself, expressing their interest to send direct front-line support to Ostafrika, to aid us in this war of ours.\n\nSuch news has thrown Hüttig into a frenzy of preparation. In Bouhlerstadt, lavish events are being planned to appropriately host their Burgundian partners. Meanwhile, on the front lines, offensives are being drawn anew, as Ostafrikan forces prepare to deliver large blows to OFN forces, all in the hopes of impressing their soon-to-arrive Burgundian comrades."

It was to the surprise of the Ostafrikan generals, then, when the Burgundian officers informed them that there would not, in fact, be any cooperation.\n\nAs quickly as the Burgundians landed in Bouhlerstadt, they left for the front lines. The lavish receptions which were so meticulously plotted out were left abandoned. The accommodations for Burgundian troops left vacant. The only trace of the European SS left in the city was the dust kicked up by their motorcade on the way south.\n\nFor the Burgundians have not arrived to wine and dine, nor have they arrived to collaborate with others. They have come to Afrika seeking blood, and they seek to do so by their own accord. If Hüttig wishes to prove his worth, he will have to kick his efforts into high gear, else risk falling behind in his own war, in the presence of the most revered Burgundian-SS."

Held under the strictest protective custody, his life was temporarily spared by a rare direct command from Reichsführer-SS himself. It would seem that the Reichsführer-SS desires to personally lay witness to the execution of this last remaining miscreant, and is presently on his way to the site in which Grouès is being kept.

Further investigation revealed this to be a coordinated resistance network, and is unofficially referred to as the RED POPPY, taken from their usage of poppy flowers as calling cards. Their leader has been identified as HENRI GROUÈS and their primary network is within Rodomo. The Reichsführer authorized an operation to eliminate the Red Poppy permanently.\n\nCURRENT STATUS: SS forces moved against identified Rodomo cells, which resulted in their complete extermination. Operations were simultaneously commenced across the Ordensstaat, resulting in the liquidation of multiple cells and individuals identified as resistance contacts or collaborators.\n\nWe also received intelligence that indicated that Grouès and the other Red Poppy leadership would be in a particular Rodomo safe house. While it was a resistance safe house, neither Grouès or his inner circle were within it. We believe they have fled Rodomo and will attempt to regroup nearby.\n\nWe expect his capture to be accomplished shortly. SS units were preemptively moved and placed on standby in cities and towns near Rodomo, in anticipation of a scattering of resistance leadership. It is recommended that we allow approximately six hours to allow for Grouès to move to one of these safe houses, before we initiate the final stage of the operation.\n\nUpon the final decapitation of their leadership, the resistance will wither and die. Their end is assured, and our soldiers stand by for the command to execute.\n\nHEIL HIMMLER"

Red Poppy has struck a decisive blow against us, and we are frustratingly still at a loss as to how. Though treason within our ranks cannot be decisively confirmed, the threat of internal sedition is still too perilous to allow to linger. The anti-resistance operation is to be temporarily cancelled, and all personnel involved liquidated, to ensure that whatever caused this disaster to happen-either gross incompetence or high treason-does not ever happen again.

The sight of Heinrich Himmler in the flesh was not a common one for an SS officer, and they made sure to be on their best behaviour. There were severe consequences for anyone who lapsed in their discipline in the presence of Himmler.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS did not usually deign to oversee the executions of prisoners personally. Truthfully, Himmler found death distasteful. The sight of gore disgusted him, and he was not present here just so that he could revel in it like some depraved sadist. He did not intend at all to prolong the dying of this prisoner; a gunshot to the back of the head was sure to be quick and clean. Himmler's personal attendance was purely one of ceremony, and poetry. This man, Grouès, was the leader of the Resistance: the head of the body of the last group of truly free Frenchmen left alive. His death meant something - in dying, he would be the last breath of the French spirit. Ending his life would also destroy the soul of the nation that Himmler despised more than any other. He wasn't here to execute a man, he was here to execute France.\n\nSteel pressed against the prisoner's head, his body stood taut by guards. Himmler's gun nestled against his skull, ready to fire. His eyes drifted away for a second, his gaze turning from Grouès. That exact second was when he fired. He only needed to feel the kickback in his hand to know the man was dead. Himmler withdrew a cloth to clean his hands, and departed the room again. Thrill and pride and relief all washed over him in equal measure as he made his way back down the hallway. This time he stopped for a moment, halfway down the path, and looked back to make sure the guards had addressed him correctly. There was still more for the Reichsführer-SS to do."

Others were locals, natives of the conquered nations who had continued their resistance to the Schutzstaffel and its master for decades after their old nations they had capitulated. They had died, as they deserved. More important and more numerous than those, though, were the countless millions who had committed treason in their minds. Every peasant tending the fields or laborer working the factories who had ever thought, "Is this the life for me? Should I escape?" was now dead too.\n\nMany still seemed alive, of course. They breathed, and ate and slept. They did their daily labor. Maybe they even still had a stray errant thought. But the rebel inside them was dead, just the same as all the rebels who had ever taken up arms were dead. They were spiritually dead. The zeal of the Frenchman or the Belgian or any other dead country was gone from them. They did entertain for more than a moment the thought of resistance. They knew who was in charge, who ruled them. They understood their inferiority, even if in their minds they did not use that word. The people of the Ordensstaat now understood more than ever before who was their master, and why they should obey him. They were a population of two peoples now: good Aryan citizens, and empty husks.

For a second, all that was heard in the room was the fanatic typing of a typewriter. "The Walloon Division has indeed been acting... in a manner unbefitting their status. The division as a whole is almost all concentrated in their home region, even with the impending invasion at hand.

Insubordination over petty matters has increased dramatically; they become more and more resistant to Aryan officers by the day, although they conduct themselves acceptably in front of our subjects. All in all, their behavior and open dissent suggests more than what we've uncovered in our initial probes. The whole division may be compromised."\n\nThe Reichsführer nodded his head slowly.

Evil exists, this is a fact. Evil, however, is not actions like some would say - but rather inaction. Consider, what word would you use to describe a society which abandons its traditions and morals for degeneracy and sloth? What would you call those who see the thieves, leeches, and enemies of the nation infiltrating their homes, corrupting the innocent, and murdering their countrymen - but who avert their eyes and do nothing?"\n\nThe young officer nodded.

Several reports had implied that it was connected to a local resistance group. This report outright stated it. Himmler shook his head. Ludicrous. There could be no native resistance in the Ordensstaat - they had crushed their spirit and ground the embers of rebellion to ash long ago.\n\nWhat fool wrote this? Who believed such resistance could exist? A traitor, probably. Ridiculous. The poppies were just a coincidence, a symbol the Untermensch clung to.

 BRG_lebenskultur_desc:0 "The Reichsführer-SS has recognized the need of a more efficient, dedicated, and focused infrastructure in order to guarantee the success of the Ordensstaat and, in turn, his vision. Thus, we must recognize that our economy must stand on the strengths of the Aryan worker, who so diligently provides the needs of the state by his dedication alone. However, influences of the modern era have corrupted what could have been good men into the fallacious belief that, as workers of the state, they inherit some form of individual right and freedom to enjoy their work. This is not National Socialism's way, however, as such foolish ideas of socialistic rights were a key part of what corrupted the Reich in the first place. Thus, in reorganizing our economic structure in order to guarantee the Ordensstaat's success, we shall develop a system to monitor and prod workers into greater efficiency, thus producing the greatest infrastructure that we could hope for by the work of the Aryan."
 BRG_expand_autobahns_desc:0 "The Führer's greatest contribution to the Aryan people's quality of life in the Reich's early days was undoubtedly the construction of the Reichsautobahn, allowing people to travel with ease. Doing the same for the Ordensstaat's highways will be a massive boon for our manufacturing and logistics."
 BRG_grand_plans_desc:0 "The land of the Ordensstaat is one steeped in thousands of years of history. Unfortunately, much of that history was while under the rule of degenerate Judeo-cosmopolitan societies, and their corruption has infused itself into the stone and soil of its cities. What we truly need is a place wiped clean of impurities, a blank slate on which to carve the National Socialist vision."
 BRG_raze_neighbourhoods_desc:0 "The chronicles of history have outlined a clear thematic presence of Germanic supremacy upon the face of the globe, from the "barbarian" supremacy following the stabbing of the Roman, Julius Caesar, to the dominance of the German Empire above the welps within any form of French Republic or Austro-Hungarian Union, to the victory of the Reich against the corrupted Allies of the West and the Judeo-Bolsheviks of the East. However, within the Ordensstaat, we have recognized a clear presence of architectural Frenchism, a gross stain upon an otherwise growingly powerful Aryan society, and with any form of non-Aryan influence, comes the inevitable corruption which follows. Thus, it shall become our greatest priority to destroy any trace of such influence from our state. Buildings, sculptures, entire neighborhoods, each detail gross details of the French, which we cannot allow any further. The Ordensstaat shall be purified of these influences, by fire and forge if necessary."
 BRG_new_era_surveilance_desc:0 "The modern age has brought about great revolutions in the technological world, thanks, in part, to the scientific advancements of the Vaterland, which have brought the world into a new era of connection and research. One of the greatest leaps in technological possibility has come through the new reaches in photographic and videographic technologies, as the rapid happenings of the modern age can now all be captured, watched, and monitored. Although the decadent capitalists of the West will claim to use such technologies for the gross "entertainment" they fetishize, and the Slav shall bear no advanced possession of this technology for decades in their broken state, it is the perfect opportunity for us to apply such technologies to monitor the possibility of corruption within our state. Aryans are the supreme masters of this world, and we shall ensure that all citizens understand that it is the Aryan state that shall watch over and protect them, at all costs."
 BRG_true_brutalist_design_desc:0 "Nord-Paris remains a towering symbol for all those desperately clawing for corrupted ideals of democracy, freedom, individualism, and autonomy. The French, throughout time, stood as a direct enemy to the virtuous Aryan, attempting to tear apart any form of Western authority for the sake of their own pitiful grasps for a "free state," even as it helped allow for the birth of the United States of America. However, such bright lights can be snuffed out by the powers of the Ordensstaat, and quench this flame we shall. From the architecture of the buildings to the structure of artworks and areas of French culture, the state shall lend its grasp to secure a brighter future. Every single miniscule inch of our public sphere shall be checked over, with our capital being rebirthed into a new age of order, law, and Aryan supremacy, above the gross weaknesses of the French who prided themselves on this formerly decadent land for centuries."
 BRG_arbeiterkultur_desc:0 "The decadence of the Reich has fostered an attitude of complacency and laziness in its Aryan citizens. If we are to avoid the twin menaces of social parasitism and decadence, we must encourage all our citizens to labor for the good of the Ordensstaat."
 BRG_industrialbezirk_rodomo_desc:0 "The city of Rouen. In the past, the city stood tall for the inbred masses of the conservative French nobility of old. There, they would convene with the ghastly corruption of the Catholic Church to celebrate their bastardized form of noble life, whilst the truly virtuous German watched from across the continent, disgusted at the actions that occurred within the disgusting pit of sin and wretchedness that was Rouen. Now, however, the city stands as a valuable asset for the Ordensstaat, as our continuous search for a potential asset to acquire in order to relieve economic pressure may have concluded in our newest, greatest plans. Every brick, tile, and cross shall be thrown away from the corrupted city, as every crack and crevice where sinfulness hides, and with it, forced labor by the unworthy shall fill its place. Rouen shall become a new source of power by which the Ordensstaat may rise, whilst the insufferable sub-humans shall work for all of our benefit."
 BRG_expand_mines_desc:0 "For millennia, mankind has toiled upon this Earth, serving his bloodline by producing whatever fruits of his labor may aid them in the ongoing crisis of their time and age. However, such themes have not withered away, as the labor of man sends them miles beneath the surface to carve out the treasures provided by the Earth, inherently destined for the use of the rightful Aryan. However, with capitalism's parasitic, murderous rampage across the markets of the modern day, the Aryan finds himself unable to benefit for his destined riches, to use for the greater glory of his blood and state. No more, however, as we shall direct state resources in order to greatly expand upon the current mines in use throughout the Ordensstaat, and opening up as many as possible in order to maximize potential gain from the land miles below our steps. No more shall the Aryan claim an inability to provide service towards his state, as any and all shall find themselves within reach of a mineshaft, reaching to unearth the pleasures of the cores of this world."
 BRG_forced_relocation_desc:0 "What once was the corrupted and unholy French land of Rouen has become the industrial powerhouse we have dreamed it to be, in revolutionizing the area to become Rodomo, one of the largest and most economically powerful lands of the Ordensstaat. Everyday, the lesser men and women of this accursed world toil beneath their Aryan masters, working to ensure a new dawning for power within the world as our economy grows and climbs, fending off any treasonous warnings of implosion. However, whilst Rodomo has already pleased those in power reigning over the new industrious KZ-Lager throughout the city of Rodomo, standing idle to its growth will prove to be its downfall. Instead, we shall take the initiative by relocating sections of the Ordensstaat's populace to reside inside of Rodomo, propping up several new areas of residence, and allowing these new arrivals to work diligently, for the greater glory of all Aryan-kind."
 BRG_factories_of_their_destruction_desc:0 "When examining the lives of lesser beings, one could look onto their lives as slaves as being a sort of mercy to them. Whilst extermination would be the most desirable outcome for them on account of all parties involved, a life of slavery allows them to participate in the growing successes of the masters of this world, toiling every waking hour for our greater success, until they eventually die out, as it would be destined for them. For anything less would allow this world to be grafted with further corruption, as showcased within the Americas, where Judeo-Bolshevik democracies and capitalistic tendencies let them tear each other apart, like rival families of rats in a sewage pipe. Today, they shall find themselves growing more useful, however: today, we will begin the mass relocation of undesirable slaves towards Rodomo in order to construct larger and more numerous factories, where these slaves shall live, where they shall work, and where they shall die."
 BRG_work_is_freedom_desc:0 "Many good Aryan men have used the intelligence their genetics have blessed them with, unlike the other mutated scum of this Earth, to ponder the reasons for which the Reich failed, where we have begun to succeed. Some say political rivalries, some say economic failures, but we truly know why: devotion, or a lack thereof. Germans were not dedicated enough to their blood-home, to the place where they earned the spotlight as the true inheritors of world power. And, regarding our infrastructural projects, we shall not lack any form of devotion which cursed the Reich. Every slave will work, every man, woman, and child shall find place to work inside Rodomo, and both Aryan and undesirable will find themselves serving the Ordensstaat. If a limb gives out? Cut it off. If another man falls? He will be butchered as the weak swine he is. KZ-Lager Rodomo will rise. We shall rise."
 BRG_expanding_our_reach_desc:0 "Our work to ensure a greater future for the Ordensstaat has been realized through the winding camps and countless smokestacks rising above the former city of Rouen, where the French would gather to fetishize the disgusting ways of French Catholic nobility. Now, all that stands is the great working place of Rodomo, where subhumans find their true purpose in endless work to support their masters, whilst the common Aryan finds his place to exercise the strength of Aryan genetics through dedication to the state. However, it is time for us to capitalize upon the newfound strength through the benefits of KZ-Lager Rodomo, and it is time to serve the Reichsführer-SS's vision through our economic bolsterings from a greater form of infrastructure. Examining the countless plans and operations planned out for the operatives within the Schutzstaffel-Außenpolitisches AMT and applying our new assets from our emboldened infrastructure will allow us to succeed unlike anything seen before."
 BRG_fuel_of_progress_desc:0 "Oil! What a wondrous substance, powering the modern age, all the relentless engines of progress. Oil fueled the tanks that crushed Europe beneath their tracks, heats our barracks, fuels the cars that roar along the autobahn, and fuels the trains that carry the degenerates to our camps. But Burgundy is sadly short on it, and with our increasing isolation from the Reich at large we find ourselves in an ever escalating shortage. The Pakt in general is having its own problems with oil supply, so we cannot rely on our usual contacts in the black market to fully cover our needs. A solution must be found so the gods of the new age are starved of the sweet nectar of their victory!"
 BRG_found_olberschaffungsburo_desc:0 "To ensure a steady supply of oil, the WVHA have ordered the formation of an Oil Acquisition Bureau under Office W. We must immediately organize a crack team of geologists, economists, and diplomats to appraise how to attain the black gold."
 BRG_going_under_curtain_desc:0 "Our normal black market contacts may not be able to provide us with much in the way of oil, but it is not like oil is only found in Europe. Vast reserves exist in the Middle East and Americas. Perhaps our friends in Nantes can organize some mutually beneficial arrangement?"
 BRG_small_opening_of_border_desc:0 "The Chief Executive Officer of Wintershall in Germany proper is a personal friend of the Reichsführer from back in the early forties. If we cut a deal to allow Wintershall, and only Wintershall, to export oil to the Burgundian market which has been closed to German oil firms since the Civil War, Wintershall would make a nice profit and we would acquire a source of oil that is still trusted to not spill our secrets."
 BRG_funnel_through_brettons_desc:0 "Our friends on the black market have come through and found us another potential oil seller! A major landowner and plantation baron in Venezuela happens to own several rich oil fields he has not informed the government about, seeking to make an untaxed profit from a discreet buyer. Well, there's nobody more discreet than us."
 BRG_pressure_nordsee_desc:0 "Our Norwegian contacts from the Quisling incident have informed us that Terboven's government suspected the presence of significant oil reserves in the North Sea, and our Wintershall friends have let slip some documents that confirm German oil firms based in England and Denmark have identified several promising fields. We just need to exert some diplomatic pressure on Norwegian officials and pretend we have the backing of Germania, and they are sure to allow our "Breton" oil company to take part in the development of oil rigs in the North Sea."
 BRG_burgundian_oil_rigs_desc:0 "The French-Registered ChannelOil company has just opened its first proper oil rigs in the North Sea. We even gave it an English name so that anyone looking closely enough to notice it is a front company will only suspect one of the big American firms. Only actual interviews with the crews would reveal a mix of old Shell drillers and younger Wintershall experts, and we've made very sure that neither the French nor Norwegian government will ever question the crews."
 BRG_norman_pipeline_desc:0 "Moving the black market oil on trucks was straining enough before, but now with the increased influx our transport capacity has been stretched to the limit. As such, the Ölbeschaffungsbüro have recommended the construction of a ChannelOil receiving port on the French side of the border, and then the laying of an underground pipeline through Normandy to our refineries northeast of Paris. The so-called Norman Pipeline will be a very large and difficult project to hide from spy planes, but once complete we will have a secure stream of oil, running right into our refineries from the outside world without them even knowing."
 BRG_blackest_of_markets_desc:0 "We've set up the infrastructure and have built up our connections; we have access to vital foreign oil. It's time to exploit this.\n\nWhile the going is good, so to speak, we should take the opportunity to buy as much foreign oil as we physically can. This will allow the state to build up its strategic fuel reserves to a more acceptable level. One never knows when he'll need more black gold..."
 BRG_synthethische_kraffstoffproduktion_desc:0 "Aryan science is the envy of the world! Why then, should we spend our hard earned capitol on foreign petrol when we can invest that money here in our own research centers?\n\nInstead of buying oil overseas, we could be making our own! Aryan ingenuity is not to be underestimated; by focusing our research and development efforts on synethictly producing petroleum and other hydrocarbons, we can further reduce our dependence on the global market."
 BRG_study_bergius_production_desc:0 "Our top researchers are convinced that they can perfect the Bergius Process. There are three different processes that our men can use to make petrol; a heavy oil process, a lighter, medium oil process, and finally the gasoline method. If we were to do all of this production on one site rather than separate ones as we have been doing, we could greatly cut down on our waste and transportation costs, since the waste from the separate processes can be recycled and used for others! Our scientists are optimistic that they can increase our coal liquefaction carbon efficiency to 95%, provided the Staat assists with funding."
 BRG_look_into_rubber_desc:0 "Oil resin has a myriad of uses pertaining to industrial uses. Plastics, adhesives, sealants, paint, and more all need resin as a base. More important than all of this, however, is rubber. Using our leftover petrol resins, this waste from our refining can be used to synthesize our own rubber products. Our scientists say that, with a little 'optimization', we can get more out of what we've been producing so far.\n\nThe importance of increasing our rubber yields can NOT be understated. Rubber is a necessary good; without it, production of vital military goods is simply impossible. If we are to achieve autarky, we must increase our pitifully low yields of rubber. For the good of the Ordensstaat, increasing our rubber output needs to be a priority."
 BRG_integrate_rodomo_facilities_desc:0 "We have lazy degenerates lazing around in our camps. Our Staat also lacks oil and synthetic rubber. As our fathers would say, we should kill "two birds with one stone."\n\nWe can mobilize slave laborers and subject them to brutal working conditions and hours to quickly build more oil refineries. The human cost will likely be significant if we are to build these expediently. The people in question are also Untermensch; their lives are forfeit and of no consequence."
 BRG_expand_operations_desc:0 "The Reichsführer demands more. Our output, even after these last months, is still "woefully inadequate." It's time to ramp up our production even further.\n\nOther small crude oil reserves? We're going to drill them. We have more; many more; hundreds of thousands of Untermensch just wasting away in our camps. Unacceptable, they are to be mobilized and put to work building, then working in new refineries across the Staat. The Reichsführer isn't content to just let our own Aryans stand by; any of our own men with technical experience of any kind should be temporarily assigned to construction details."
 BRG_ration_usage_desc:0 "In an attempt to save more fuel for our own uses, the Staat shall introduce strict rationing. Anyone who is not an Aryan or one of our collaborators will be ineligible to receive motor oil or fuel. Furthermore, all citizens who have access to petrol will be limited to how much they can receive, based on their importance to the Ordensstaat. Though many will not like it, no one will dare complain. This is, after all, for the good of the Staat. Through personal sacrifice comes victory."
 BRG_no_more_generosity_desc:0 "The collaborators are not Aryans. They will never be; they are merely tools that we use to further our own goals. They have become complacent, fat, lazy. Only by our good graces are they and their families not in camps, and they know this well.\n\nSetting strict rationing on the collaborators has two main benefits. It'll put the collaborators in their place, so to speak. We don't want them to forget that they work for us, not the other way around. They're expendable, and do not want to fall out of favor with us. The added benefit of more oil for the Staat is not to be overlooked, however. The Reichsführer demands more fuel for our war industry, and we will, of course, comply."
 BRG_survey_campaigns_desc:0 "Taking inventory of our overall oil output is not reassuring. The Ordensstaat, as of now, simply does not have the capabilities to supply the Staat with enough oil to be self-sufficient The. Reichsführer demands we resolve the issue at once. The Ordensstaat's energy independence and self sufficiency is vital for the survival and wellbeing of the Staat.\n\nIt is well known that there are plentiful natural gas reserves in the Netherlands; therefore it isn't a stretch that there could very well be more oil in the Ordensstaat that we haven't discovered yet. Therefore, the Reichsführer has ordered a vast survey campaign to be conducted throughout our holdings to find untapped oil reserves for our thirsty war machine."
 BRG_oil_wells_of_paris_basin_desc:0 "Our surveyors have come back with most welcome news; underneath the nerve-center of the Staat lays the black gold we so desperately need. The Paris Basin is a surprising discovery, but certainly a most welcome one. Being so close to several metropolitan areas, it is a trivial matter to resquite the required laborers for processing this vital resource.\n\nOf course, we need to set up the required heavy equipment for extraction. Drills, piping, pumps, and more all need to be shipped (or dragged, if need be) to our new construction sites. The labor will be intense and long, but the Reichsführer demands results. Our self-sufficiency is of the utmost importance for our final goal."
 BRG_produce_liquefied_coal_desc:0 "Our newfound oil reservoirs are not sufficient for the Reichsführer. Our oil output is still not high enough for the Staat to achieve autarky; we need more. However, there is a way to increase our output even more.\n\nAn ambitious plan has been laid on the table; the Reich, during our great struggle against the Allied Powers and the Soviet Union faced a similar lack of petrol. However, German ingenuity found a way, as always. Coal, after grueling and tedious work, can be turned into liquified into motor oil and fuel. The process is not as efficient as simply extracting crude oil, but it will increase our petrol output nonetheless."
 BRG_prime_pumps_desc:0 "Now that our petrol output is up to acceptable numbers, it is time we invest in increasing our strategic reserves.\n\nFor years now, we never had the need for large scale holding tanks; we simply never had that much oil on hand to warrant expanding our storage capabilities. Times are quickly changing however. The Ordensstaat is loath to waste any excess petrol we produce, and the Reichsführer demands action. We'll call up the masses and build new, massive holding tanks for our newly found wealth."
 BRG_worth_its_weight_in_gold_desc:0 "Black gold. The life blood of our industry; the fuel that drives our Panzers, that propels our transports, and which allows our armed forces to be ready for anything at a moments notice. We have this liquid gold, and we have it in abundance now. Our reserves are quickly filling up thanks to the massive amount of effort we diverged towards energy independence, to the Reichsführer's approval. With our industrial base, we now lack for nothing. We are not reliant on the global market anymore. Our domestic production and austerity has finally proved to be enough, for even now we store more and more. A vital part of our plan has finally come to fruition."

However, in recognizing the laughable ineptitude of these ideas, these decadent regimes hold one great prospect over our heads which allow them to function in this modern, dreaded world: the ability to produce, to manufacture, and to develop within their state, even if it may be through the ideals of corrupted businessmen or socialist pigs.

BRG_infra.1.t:0 "A New Type of City"
BRG_infra.1.desc:0 "From its earliest days, National Socialism has always been defined for its commitment to the Aryan worker. As it stands, Burgundian labor has gone a long way to realizing this ideal. In the Ordensstaat, the Aryan toils for the good of his race, free from the material and degenerate pursuits that contaminate his work-ethic and racial purity in the Reich and elsewhere. Everywhere, our workers are watched and carefully controlled by eagle-eyed SS commissars, who make sure that everyone works at maximum efficiency.\n\nWhile this might be enough for some lesser nation, it is not nearly disciplined and powerful enough for the realization of the Ordensstaat's vision and the plans of our glorious Reichsführer-SS. There is still too much theft, too much corruption, and too much laziness among our workers.\n\nIn order to rectify this situation and allow our Aryan everyday heroes to achieve the full capabilities of their race, we must undertake the construction of several new "model cities". These will be the sanctuaries of the new Aryan race, where they will be undistracted by petty trivialities and pintless pleasures. The black sun rises high over the Ordensstaat, and it will soon shine over a new sort of city, an edifice to strength and racial purity rather than degeneracy. When night falls, those who survive will only be the strongest, molded and trained in these cities, ready to build a new world."

BRG_infra.2.t:0 "The Rebirth of Nord-Paris"
BRG_infra.2.desc:0 "It was always a curious balance being a non-German member of the SS. In his sharp black uniform, Pieter Spoelstra engandered the same fear and obedience from the average citizens that scurried like ants upon Nord-Paris' dismal streets. But from the other soldiers, he received only scorn. No matter how carefully he practiced, his German retained a Dutch accent, and no amount of work or loyalty would alter his notably un-Gothic profile and facial features. An Aryan Pieter undoubtedly was, but an officer he would never be.\n\nPieter had visited Paris only once before the war. Still a teenager, on an unwanted trip to visit an unloved aunt, he remembered being half bored by the endless trivialities, and half impressed by the city's unmistakable beauty. They said now that it had been an evil, corrupt sort of beautify, long-gone and best forgotten. Like any SS member without a death wish, Pieter agreed, and manifested his hatred for the "degenerate" French culture whenever possible.\n\nNonetheless, as he walked his patrol, he could not help but notice how much had changed. A concrete building, unmarked except for Himmler's rounded swastika marked the local SD headquarters. Perhaps it was his imagination, but he thought he could could still see a handful of burnt timbers around the building's base, remnants of the wine-shop that had stood there before. What had once been a colorful mural was now grey concrete, stolid, unconsidering and topped with barb-wire. Pieter wondered whether the wire served any purpose, or whether it was only there to remind that Parisians that such luxuries as beauty, free-movement, or blue sky were luxuries best forgotten.\n\nPieter kept his treasonous thoughts to himself, and that did not stop him from meting out a beating to a worker who dared to bump into him on the street. Nonetheless, he could not turn his thoughts away from what had been and would never be again."

BRG_infra.3.t:0 "A New Type of Labor"
BRG_infra.3.desc:0 "The noble values of National Socialism layed out by our glorious Reichsführer-SS is of course all-knowing and impeccable. However, some of its implementation in the field of industry, has been so far less-than-ideal. Naturally, these failiures are the fault of Zionist infiltrators and the weakness of the Untermensch over which we rule, and can be rectified by the further implementation of proper National Socialism.\n\nWhile our factories our certainly productive, they have a tendency to produce poor-quality and uninspired products, and to communicate poorly with ther fellows and superiors. The source of these issues is clear: a lack of scale. Inspired by our Arbeiterkultur, talks about the current state of Burgundian industry and the challenges for integrating the newly seized French lands have begun. Thus we have begun planning Industriebezirk Rodomo, a proposed massive industrial complex/concentration camp based around Rodomo (Rouen in Normandy) where workers can be easily gathered for maximum productivity. Of course, the French degenerates are scum, unworthy to even stand on even ground with their Aryan counterparts, but through the Industriebezirk Rodomo, even these worthless slime might be able to contribute something of value to the Ordensstaat."

BRG_infra.4.t:0 "Report 205: Update on the Construction of Industriebezirk Rodomo"
BRG_infra.4.desc:0 "My Reichsführer,\n\nThis missive brings excellent news for the true National Socialist German Workers' Party, the Aryan people, and the Ordensstaat. The construction of the Industriebezirk Rodomo is well ahead of schedule. On our current trajectory we're likely to exceed 8 out of the 13 benchmarks set for the end of the month, and may yet progress more on the remainder. Our achievements here are a testament to the undying Aryan will and persistence in the face of impossible odds, and naturally to you, my Reichsführer, for your vision and direction in this project.\n\nMy staff have successfully developed a number of new techniques for motivating our Untermensch workers in the construction of the camp. First, and particularly effective has been a system of rewards/punishments, meted out not on the workers themselves, but on close relations or suspected romantic partners. In order to not waste valuable human resources, we have also invented new techniques and tools which emphansize visual suffering, humiliation, and non-debilitating mutilation. The second pillar of our success has been the application of discarded substandard Amphetamine pills to reduce worker sleep and caloric intake. Finally, we have spread agents among the workers who induce their cooperation with small amounts of forbidden gifts, and are spreading the rumor that once the camp is complete, all those who worked on its construction will be transferred to a liquidation facility, en route to which they will be rescued by a resistance operation. Naturally, we have marked the individuals most receptive to this delusion as potential troublemakers for when the camp-builders are redesignated as camp inmates.\n\nThe one failure of this project has been its higher-than-expected cost in Untermensch lives. Multiple times we've had to halt construction in order to dispose of bodies that risked spreading diseases that could inhibit further labor. Nonetheless, we are already beginning work on the officers' quarters, and have started to amass coal reserves for the in-house cremation facilities. Soon the Ordensstaat will have a new factory, ever expanding the arsenal and capabilities of its Aryan soldiers.\n\nSincerely yours,\nOberführer Adolf Eichmann"

BRG_infra.5.t:0 "Thursday, October 5th:"
BRG_infra.5.desc:0 "My name is Charles Macron. I am a citizen of the French Republic, a Social Democrat, a Christian, and an inmate at the Rodomo Industrial Work Camp.\n\nI have been beaten 5 times since my arrival here, one week ago. I say this number, not to complain of my circumstances because many are suffering much worse, but because there is no one else to tell. I cannot tell my fellow prisoners, as they might well report me in order to earn some small respite for themselves, and sharing such personal information is viewed as building the bonds that lead to insurrection. I cannot tell my wife Clara, as it may make her fear more for my safety than she does currently, which could lead to a mistake on her part detrimental to us all. I cannot tell my children Anna and Louis, as to do so would be monstrous.\n\nI think I have not slept since I arrived at this accursed place. The SS seem to believe that we need only 5 hours of sleep with whatever they're putting in our food. But the factory is always going, and even when I lay my head upon my bundled clothes, I cannot close my eyes but for the pounding.\n\nShould this diary ever be read, the intelligent observer might wonder how I obtained the materials with which to make it. Surely the SS, like many other tyrants throughout history would have taken my quill and paper as the closest substitute for my mind? Thankfully, I was given an accounting shift from which I was able to steal these beloved items. My heart was pounding as I did so -- I know that if I were caught it would result in my torture and death, likely in front of my family. My death is imminent. I feel it in my bowels when I eat the slop they feed us, when I shit, when the cosh hits me for closing my eyes too long at work. More likely than not, Clara will soon follow me. I can only hope that our children might live to see the collapse of this wretched Ordensstaat, and to have lives of their own. I have put them all in danger by writing this, but I can think of no other way to strike back at those who treat us so cruelly."

BRG_infra.6.t:0 "Pure Aryan Industry"
BRG_infra.6.desc:0 "At the establishment of the our State, industry in the Ordensstaat was a scattered mix of different systems, structures, and procedures. From the endless tiny differences in equipment born from the mire of German bourgeois competition between different firms, to the pathetic state of degenerate French factories, the industry of this region was better suited for the production of Untermensch cooking-ware and farm equipment then it was the guns and tanks of the last hope of the invincible Aryan race.\n\nNow though, there is one standard set by the eagle-eyed commissars of the SS, and one way, the true National Socialist. The factories follow the same protocols, with workers, machinery, and infrastructure designed for the maximization of efficiency. Now there is no purpose for these workshops except the goals of the state, and no guiding vision except for that of our glorious Reichsführer.\n\nWith our recent conquest of yet more French territory, the time has to expand and perfect our system. Soon, the hammers will ring in unison across the Ordensstaat and as one the tanks shall roll from their cavernous depths to bring destruction onto the enemies of our people."

BRG_infra.7.t:0 "Flexing Our Might"
BRG_infra.7.desc:0 "Glorious news! The first stage in our program for the repurposing of infrastructure within the Ordensstaat has been completed. The French laborers have been integrated into our factories, their resistance broken and their spirits realigned with the purpose of their new state. Now at last, we can refocus our newly increased capacity on the expansion of our global aims. The soldiers and spies of the Ordensstaat will go forth, equipped with the finest machinery that man has ever seen.\n\nOur tanks. Our fleet. Our aircraft. In both those actions claimed by the Ordensstaat, and those done under false flags, they will be now armed at levels equal or exceeding those of the greatest world powers. There will be no enemy, near or far, that can defy the power of the Shadow State. Let the degenerates of the world be aware -- they will soon witness the power of the Aryan."
BRG_infra.7.a:0 "Let our fires burn bright, and from them shall come the final darkness."

BRG_infra.8.t:0 "Tapping the Well of Destruction"
BRG_infra.8.desc:0 "Although the factories of the Ordnesstaat reach higher levels of production and efficiency everyday, its fields produce agricultural surpluses unimaginable by any of our enemies, we seem to have a bit of a shortage of hard currency. This is inconvenient, as it is only with hard cash that our operatives and contacts can carry out their tasks. In order to rectify this situation, our brilliant Reichsführer has expanded our pre-existing relationship with black market dealers. Soon, our weapons, unidentifiable, untraceable, and deadly will flow across the world, spreading chaos and fear to our opponents. In return, we shall have the currency we so desperately require, in order to expand our production and global operations even further.\n\nNaturally such brilliance provokes opposition. There have been whispers among the ranks that perhaps we have gone too far in our isolation from the degenerates. That perhaps we should open our borders to at least a marginal flow of trade, to assure a more reliable flow of cash than that produced by our black-market contacts. These traitorous slime are unworthy of anything more than the rack, and shall soon be dealt with. Others claim that using the Untermensch smugglers is a deviation from true National Socialism and the Reichsführer-SS's vision. Well meaning as their protests might be, we can have no such defiance in our ranks. The Burgundian System is that of the Reichsführer-SS, and there can be no other."
BRG_infra.8.a:0 "Let the weapons flow."

BRG_infra.9.t:0 "The Dark Port"
BRG_infra.9.desc:0 "Hafenstatd was once a quaint little fishing village that soon expanded into a proper sea-side city. Its livelihood was made by seafood, tourism, and little trinkets that Untermensch children could impress each other with. Then came the Ordensstaat, which soon swept away such degenerate nonsense. Now its people cower in fear of their rightful SS rulers, and scurry to meet the production quotas demanded of them.\n\nBut Hafenstadt is capable of much more. Although invincible on land, unmatched in the air, the Ordensstaat has yet to produce a proper navy. Although we may never be a global fleet-power (not that we need to be for the fulfillment of the glorious mission of our immortal Reichsführer), ships will help to keep our shores safe and our work secure. For this purpose, we will bulldoze the remnants of the degenerate towns and villages along the coast, and rebuild them anew.\n\nFrom what was once a hub of weakness, pettiness, and degeneracy, the blackships of the Ordensstaat will stream out across the world, striking terror into the hearts of our enemies, until the plans of the Reichsführer are complete, and the long history of the Aryan enters its culminating stage."

But the lustre of slave-morality hid the sinister truth -- it was a time of weakness, racial impurity, and the tightening noose of Jewish-Bolshevik domination. Their useless hovels and pathetic gardens kept the cowards enshrouded in their ignorance, and unknowing of their true potential or their rightful submission to the Aryan race.\n\nNow we have shown them that truth. The wasteful vineyards are no more, in their place lie perfectly organized rows of hardy crops. Village workshops have been replaced with massive fortresses of Industry, where the Untermensch toil to eke out some small contribution to the glory of the Aryan and National socialism. The parks and pleasures that were the highest scions of degeneracy have been bulldozed, and replaced with worker quarters. What minor resistance these improvements faced has been obliterated. Now the people know no future but servitude to their Aryan masters, no state but the Ordensstaat, no leader but the Reichsführer-SS, and no future except for the completion of his grand design."

Should the tap remain shut for too long, however, then the nation will surely struggle in their battle to survive, and doubly so in their endeavor to thrive. To this rule, the Ordensstaat is no exception.\n\nTo realize the plans of the Reichsführer-SS, the Ordensstaat must secure for itself the oil tap, and ensure that the black crude steadily hydrates our state. However, such a stream must remain steadfast. The odd import or unreliable shipment of oil from abroad will simply not suffice in supplementing the needs of the Ordensstaat.\n\nTo further the cause of National Socialism, we must immediately look to secure a steady import of oil that will not falter, and will not leave us dry when we most require it."

Some of the accidents were rather serious, too; a water pipe in a steel mill burst yesterday, causing a steam explosion that severely scalded a dozen workers. Although the Aryan foreman and floor supervisors were fortunately unharmed, it nonetheless has put the factory out of commission for the next several days.\n\nThankfully, this has not proven to be a debilitating setback. Increasing the quotas at other steel mills has done more than enough to offset the deficit, and the closed mill should be able to return to full operating capacity within a week. With any luck, this will soon be behind us."

These incidents have unfortunately become a semi-frequent occurrence...\n\n...but what if they are more than just incidents?\n\nIt does not take a genius to suspect sabotage in a place where many rebellious Untermenschen are pressed into service. Rumors of a resistance movement are swirling among guards, and more disturbingly, among the workers. If there are saboteurs among them, the belief that there is an outside group that will aid them may cause them to become even more brazen in their nefarious deeds. Local police chiefs have already put in requests for more men, lest the situation continue to escalate."

Broken machinery, cut brake lines on trucks, broken gas mains, rivets removed from walkways, it feels like every day, the damnable saboteurs invent a new way to undermine the Aryan race and all that they stand for.\n\nUnderstandably, the city's SS guards have become rather zealous in their hunt for these saboteurs. Curfews have been tightened, raids into workers' households in search of contraband are becoming more frequent, and the definition of what exactly qualifies as an enemy combatant has been broadened a bit. As a pleasant side effect and a satisfactory consolation, for the SS it seems that the guards' incredible diligence has greatly aided the Gestapo in tracking down suspected dissidents. It turns out that having watchful eyes on the corner of every block does wonders for the Reich Main Security Office."

The local party officials are at their wits' end trying to solve this solution, and they fear that another wrong step would attract the eyes of Nanzig.\n\nSo, they have gone with the only plan which they know best: more. Requests for disproportionately large amounts of guards for the garrison have been filed, and the one-fictional idea of "eyes in every house" may very soon become a reality in Rodomo. It may seem like a titanic cost, but the damage caused by unchecked sabotage may outnumber it many times over in the future. At least, let us hope that this will be the end of the sabotage."

Although an effort is made to draw the labor pool from all areas of the Ordensstaat, it does not mean that they are incapable of communication and seditious ideals. Folklore, furnal hymns, and more are all starting to be reported by industrial site guards, something that is incredibly discouraging.

This is nothing short of pouring out gasoline while striking a match. It must be contained like a tumor, where it is better to scoop the rot out and everything that surrounds it than risk reinfection.

Several such incidents have occurred over the past several weeks in a uranium enrichment plant in a classified location, which saw a cave-in kill three workers in its main mine, and another died of acute radiation poisoning when a centrifuge failed and sprayed him with particles of Uranium-235.\n\nAlthough there are some who would willingly chalk this up to happenstance, there are those within the SS who may believe otherwise. The concurrence of these accidents may suggest sabotage may be involved, and stricter screening of the labor force will be needed."

The first incident involved the installation of the nuclear fuel rods, when one of the workers accidentally dropped it out of its caes, exposing himself and four other men to lethal amounts of radiation. A similar incident occurred two days later, when a French custodian accidentally raised several control rods while cleaning, causing two German scientists observing the nuclear fuel rods to die of radiation poisoning. The fuel rods have already received a fun nickname from the staff for this: Dämonenstäbe, or demon rods.\n\nWhile the perpetrators of both these events were swiftly killed (one by radiation and the other by a trigger-happy SS guard), their motives are still quite speculated upon in the ranks. The dreaded word "sabotage" seems to be on everyone's lips, as well as fears of what may come next. Will they try and destroy the reactor entirely? Will they attempt it by overloading the reactor and creating a nuclear explosion? In any case, more guards are needed, to assuage the staff's fears if nothing else."

Indeed, our venture may require very little in terms of financial or other sacrifice.\n\nBeneath the depths of the North Sea rests many rich deposits of crude petroleum. Geological survey records dated back to 1938 conducted by the now-defunct Royal Dutch Shell, as well as similar surveys conducted by the British, display rather promising discoveries of natural gas and petroleum deposits deep beneath the waves. The ocean, however, is a rather notable obstacle to extraction, and thus these deposits have been greatly overshadowed by more accessible and economical landborne sources.\n\nThe means to extract these deposits, however, do exist, and recent exploitation efforts by the Norwegians suggest that the economical feasibility of the North Sea oil has never been greater. Therefore, I recommend that further inquiries be made upon the establishment of oil extraction operations off the Norwegian coast, in the interest of securing a reliable flow of petroleum for the Ordensstaat.\n\nFor your consideration, sir,\nHauptsturmführer Selig"

Much to our surprise, the representatives are very much interested in the acquisition of rights to independent extraction of North Sea oil deposits.\n\nInitially our Economic Minister was struck by puzzlement, for the German firm surely had access to more easily extracted sources of oil. However, it would appear that Kontinentale Öl is rather deadset upon investing in extraction efforts in the North Sea. So much so, in fact, that they have voiced their willingness to fork over a substantial sum of Reichsmarks to secure these extraction rights.\n\nWithout a doubt it would be incredibly economical to strike a deal with the representatives of Kontinentale Öl. If they are truly willing to invest the capital that they claim, then surely we would be fools to not take advantage of such a business opportunity.

### HUNT FOR DEGRELLE
####
###############################################################################################################################################################################################################################33


BRG_huntdegrelle.1.t:0 "Degrelle Vanishes!"
BRG_huntdegrelle.1.desc:0 "SS-Oberführer Carl Schlosser glanced at the latest reports from the front and pinched the bridge of his nose. While the pitiful excuse for a French Army was easily folding before the might of the Waffen-SS, it was no thanks to the Walloon Legion. In fact, according to other SS division headquarters, they were hardly advancing at all and refusing to report their positions to others. This was borderline treason! Schlosser picked up his phone, dialing Léon Degrelle's number. The Walloon Legion's leader didn't pick up, but one of his German attachés did. "Put me through to Degrelle!" Schlosser barked.\n\n"Standartenführer Degrelle is gone, sir."\n\n"Then find him and put him on!"\n\n"You do not understand, sir. Degrelle is GONE."\n\nThe next few hours were consumed by an onslaught of panicked phone calls, briefings to a confused high command, and a mad scramble to find a replacement commander for the Legion. The well-respected Walloon officer Jean-François Thiriart received a battlefield promotion, and he was able to execute the assigned maneuvers after a short delay. Although the immediate crisis has been solved, Degrelle has practically vanished off the face of the Earth, and many of his immediate subordinates in the Legion are unable (or unwilling) to say where he went. The SS is going to get to the bottom of this, one way or another."
BRG_huntdegrelle.1.a:0 "Where did that bastard go?!"

BRG_huntdegrelle.2.t:0 "A Humble Request"
BRG_huntdegrelle.2.desc:0 ""Honestly, I'm humbled to be able to serve the Reichsführer-SS in such a capacity. In order to fulfill the goals of National Socialism as best as I can, I will, however, need a few more resources. First of all, the Legion needs more supplies to replenish those used against the French, of course..." The officers of the Reichsführer-SS's personal staff stared expressionless as the newly-minted Standartenführer Jean-François Thiriart rattled off lists of supplies the Walloon Legion requested, as well as the inane tasks they'd waste them on.\n\n"...and the organization of a manhunt against Léon Degrelle, traitor to the Ordensstaat." This got their attention. Thiriart slid over a typed list of supply requisitions, with the SS officers thumbed through. One departed into another room, carrying the list, and the muffled sounds of a phone conversation could be heard. When he returned, he was as stoic as ever, but with a hint of surprise in his eyes.\n\n"The Reichsführer-SS has personally approved your supply requisitions and applauds your eagerness to eliminate those who work to undermine National Socialism. He expects good results from you."\n\n"Yes, yes, of course! Thank you! Sieg heil!" Thiriart exclaimed as he gathered his belongings and hastily departed the conference room. Personal praise from the Reichsführer-SS himself was a high honor, but it also meant that Himmler's eyes would be closely watching him for any sign of failure..."
BRG_huntdegrelle.2.a:0 "It is unwise to disappoint the Reichsführer-SS."

BRG_huntdegrelle.3.t:0 "Dragging Their Feet"
BRG_huntdegrelle.3.desc:0 "The Reichsführer-SS skimmed through Oberführer Schlosser's report on the preliminary stages of the search for Degrelle, shaking his head at the findings. The results were unfortunately sparse, in no small part due to the (in)action of the Walloon Legion. Schlosser even included an addendum containing a veritable laundry list of all the ways Legion officers have hampered the investigation. Orders conveniently lost in the chain of command, low troop morale, contaminated evidence, weak alibis, missing witness reports, the list went on and on. This amount of incompetence was rapidly shifting into insubordination, if not an outright conspiracy within the Legion to stall the investigation.\n\nThankfully, their new leader Thiriart seemed to have his head on straight. He was loyal, determined, and above all else, always seeking his Reichsführer-SS's approval. He sent a telegram shortly after Schlosser's report arrived, asking for how he should approach the investigation. Although he mentions the Legion is capable of beginning the investigation at once, he also asks for the Reichsführer-SS's blessing to collaborate with the SS-Legion Langemarck; although the Flemish no doubt hate the Walloon Legion, they hate Degrelle more."
BRG_huntdegrelle.3.a:0 "All aid is welcome, Thiriart may reach out to Langemarck."
BRG_huntdegrelle.3.b:0 "Time is of the essence, Thiriart must begin immediately."

BRG_huntdegrelle.4.t:0 "Antwerp for Two"
BRG_huntdegrelle.4.desc:0 "The two men sat at a table outside the cafe, sipping tea and glaring at each other with a sort of casual loathing. On one end sat Thiriart, and on the other sat Bert Eriksson, the young Flemish commander SS-Legion Langemarck. Although the Flemings and Walloons were ostensibly united under the swastika, old habits died hard and ethnic hatred was as strong as ever.\n\n"You're either a genius or a fool," Eriksson laughed, "to think you can stroll into Flanders, request a meeting with me, and expect help with whatever problem you have. I'm not one of your gatlikker toadies."\n\n"It's not a what that's a problem, but a who," Thiriart whispered. "Degrelle."\n\nEriksson's interest was piqued. "So the rumors are true then. If you're seriously taking that kankerlijer down, name whatever it is you need. Give me a week, and the Langemarck will make it yours."\n\nThiriart extended his hand, but Eriksson cut him off. "But! I have one condition, and I know that all your little friends are going to hate, hate, HATE it!""
BRG_huntdegrelle.4.a:0 ""I want to be right there with you until we catch him.""

BRG_huntdegrelle.6.t:0 "A Line Crossed"
BRG_huntdegrelle.6.desc:0 "The line of trucks headed by a black Benz sedan pulled to a stop at the fortified border checkpoint. Although the sight would be unusual in much of the Ordensstaat, one of the few autonomies the Walloon Legion retained was the right to police their own regional borders. While the leader of the Legion would ostensibly have no problem crossing, discontent was considerably higher in the ranks, especially after word got out that he was collaborating with the Flemish to search for their beloved former leader. Thankfully, soldiers in the convoy had their doubts (and scruples about working with Langemarck) thoroughly silenced with promotions and pay raises.\n\nThe Benz's rear window rolled down as a guard approached, revealing Thiriart and Eriksson sitting in the back. "Bonjour, soldier!" Thiriart beamed. "Official business on behalf of the Reichsführer-SS. Here are the papers, they should all be in order."\n\nThe guard took the papers and marched into the checkpoint's office. All around, it seemed that the guards were on edge, watching the convoy like hawks and fingers on the triggers of their rifles. Would they ever dare to open fire on their commanding officer? No, of course not. They wouldn't, right?\n\nAfter a tense minute, the guard exited and returned Thiriart's papers. "Everything seems to be in order, Standartenführer. Sieg heil," he hissed, before coldly saluting and marching back inside. The gate opened and the convoy pulled through unimpeded. As Eriksson waved at the Walloon guards with a shit-eating grin on his face, Thiriart pulled out his case notes and a map. Where to next?"
BRG_huntdegrelle.6.a:0 "The game is afoot!"

BRG_huntdegrelle.7.t:0 "A Traitor's End?"
BRG_huntdegrelle.7.desc:0 "Schlosser's much-anticipated report on the hunt for Degrelle arrived on the Reichsführer-SS's desk, which he eagerly flipped through. The initial pages were discouraging, full of euphemisms like "exhausted leads" and "temporary obstacles." But as the investigation was winding down, Thiriart and Eriksson's squad stumbled upon a bunker that was ostensibly decommissioned and removed from records years ago. More curiously, it was guarded by Walloon Legion soldiers who weren't part of any chain of command. They opened fire on sight, and Thiriart and his men were forced to fight a bloody room-to-room battle to clear the bunker.\n\nIn one of the rooms, they came across two rogue Legionnaires concluding the impromptu cremation of a body. They were quickly killed by the loyalists and the fire was doused; although the body had been severely burned by the fire, it could still be identified as a middle-aged man in an SS officer's uniform. An exit wound at the top of the skull indicated that he had shot himself shortly before his body was burnt, meaning he had likely committed suicide when the raid on the bunker began.\n\nThe Reichsführer-SS opened an envelope that accompanied the report, thumbing through grisly photos of the charred corpse. Nauseating as the scene was, it certainly looked enough like Degrelle. He queasily returned the pictures to their resting place, and let out a sigh of relief. Schlosser's report concluded by mentioning that since the news of the raid spread, there was significantly more quiet in the ranks of the Legion. It wasn't certain that Degrelle was dead, but in these trying times, it was good enough for now."
BRG_huntdegrelle.7.a:0 "Let us hope this is the end."

BRG_huntdegrelle.8.t:0 "An Abnormal Autopsy"
BRG_huntdegrelle.8.desc:0 "The charred body lay on the shining metal table, in stark contrast to the cold sterility of the morgue. The white-clad doctors performed their usual ritual; one danced around the body with calipers and a measuring tape, while the other jotted down the readings he recited. Despite the fact that this was the corpse of a high-ranking traitor to the SS, they treated it with the same soulless efficiency they did for any other body on the table.\n\n"Hm, that's funny," the doctor with the clipboard said. "Could you repeat the observed dental work?"\n\n"Silver fillings, mandibular second bicuspids, and a crown on the right first maxillary molar. Why?"\n\n"Because according to his 1941 Wehrmacht examination records, he has fillings in both his second maxillary molars and no other work done."\n\nThe doctor with the caliper's eyes widened with realization. "Then does that mean-"\n\n"So it would seem."\n\n"I believe we should inform the Reichsführer-SS."\n\n"Most definitely. I'll find a phone.""
BRG_huntdegrelle.8.a:0 "The hydra has regrown its head."

BRG_huntdegrelle.9.t:0 "A False Start"
BRG_huntdegrelle.9.desc:0 "The line of trucks headed by a black Benz sedan pulled to a stop at the fortified border checkpoint. Although the sight would be unusual in much of the Ordensstaat, one of the few autonomies the Walloon Legion retained was the right to police their own regional borders. While the leader of the Legion would ostensibly have no problem crossing, discontent was considerably higher in the ranks since the hunt for their beloved former leader began. Thankfully, soldiers in the convoy had already been vetted and were equally devoted to the cause as Thiriart.\n\nThe Benz's rear window rolled down as a guard approached, revealing Thiriart and Eriksson sitting in the back. "Bonjour, soldier!" Thiriart beamed. "Official business on behalf of the Reichsführer-SS. Here are the papers, they should all be in order."\n\nThe guard took the papers and glanced at them with a disapproving sneer before shoving them back into Thiriart's hands. "Denied, per my Sturmbannführer's orders."\n\nThiriart's smile vanished. "No, soldier, I don't think you understand. I am your Sturmbannführer's commanding officer, acting on behalf of the Reichsführer-SS. Now let me through, and we will forget about this. But if you don't, when word gets back to Nanzig, I-"\n\n"Heaven is high and Himmler is far away," the guard flatly responded before turning around and marching back into the checkpoint's office. The disloyal Legionnaires raised their guns, all targeted squarely at Thiriart's car. The message was clear, so the convoy reluctantly reversed.\n\nThiriart was not bluffing when he said Nanzig would hear. His report reached the Reichsführer-SS's desk, and he eagerly awaits his leader's word on how to deal with these insubordinate elements."
BRG_huntdegrelle.9.a:0 "To compromise is to admit defeat, shoot them all!"
BRG_huntdegrelle.9.b:0 "If they can be reasoned with, then talk them down."

BRG_huntdegrelle.10.t:0 "No Quarter"
BRG_huntdegrelle.10.desc:0 "When Thiriart returned to the Walloon border checkpoint, he was ready. He didn't ride in the backseat of a Benz, but an armored car, and he was preceded by three dozen of the Legion's finest and a barrage of mortar fire. IT was a level of firepower that the traitorous Legionnaires were not expecting, but as a testament to their training, they stood firm and returned fire.\n\nThe fighting soon settled into an uneasy stalemate, with the soldiers at the checkpoint unable to repel Thiriart, and Thiriart unable to storm the checkpoint without charging across the open road. But as the day dragged on and the fear of the other side receiving reinforcements grew, desperation forced their hands. The traitors attempted to advance from their positions, but they overplayed their hand; Thiriart, sensing an opportunity, ordered his men to charge. His timing was able to lessen the potential amount of casualties, but a good amount of Thiriart's force was killed during the charge and the ensuing room-to-room fighting in the checkpoint's offices.\n\nAs the evening began, the treasonous Sturmbannführer and the rest of his command staff were dead, with those few who surrendered being executed by Thiriart personally. A couple of the surviving traitors who professed ignorance as to who was shooting at them were merely stripped of their weapons and kept under close watch. With these distractions finally removed, the hunt for Degrelle could begin in earnest."
BRG_huntdegrelle.10.a:0 "The game is afoot!"

BRG_huntdegrelle.11.t:0 "A Traitor's End?"
BRG_huntdegrelle.11.desc:0 "Schlosser's much-anticipated report on the hunt for Degrelle arrived on the Reichsführer-SS's desk, which he eagerly flipped through.

BRG_huntdegrelle.11.a:0 "Let us hope this is the end."

BRG_huntdegrelle.12.t:0 "Asking Politely"
BRG_huntdegrelle.12.desc:0 "The convoy headed by the black Benz pulled up to the familiar Walloon border checkpoint. When the soldier approached, he was bluntly told "I am SS-Standartenführer Jean-François Thiriart of the Walloon Legion, I need to speak to your commanding officer."\n\nThe guard returned to the checkpoint's office, and he emerged accompanied by an SS officer with a Legion arm patch. "SS-Sturmbannführer Saint-Antoine, reporting for duty."\n\n"Ah, you're just the man I wanted to meet!" Thiriart beamed. "Tell me, why did you deny my previous attempt to cross the border?"\n\n"There have been several industrial accidents that damaged roads and other infrastructure," the Sturmbannführer recited by rote, "overland travel is impossible for the time being."\n\n"I see," replied Thiriart, unfazed. "I have several dozen men here. Could they not help with the cleanup?"\n\n"One of the accidents was at a chemical plant and caustic toxins have contaminated the environment. It will be at least a week before the area is sufficiently cleaned up."\n\n"And why have I not been informed of an accident of such magnitude?"\n\n"The report must have become lost, sir. I shall launch an inquiry into what happened and send a new one posthaste."\n\n"Right. Adieu." Thierry ordered the convoy to turn around for the second time, returning to Nanzig feeling rather disgruntled. He hoped that at least bloodshed had been avoided, but he wondered whether the alternative would have been more painless..."
BRG_huntdegrelle.12.a:0 "Excuses, excuses..."

BRG_huntdegrelle.13.t:0 "Passage at Last"
BRG_huntdegrelle.13.desc:0 "After what felt like an eternity of waiting, Thiriart and his convoy made a third visit to the Walloon border checkpoint. But this time, they were waved along and drove through unimpeded. Soon, the trucks were speeding past the pastures of Walloonia, and Thiriart was radioing in to other truck leaders to coordinate the beginning of the investigation. Unsurprisingly, there was no evidence whatsoever of any chemical plant leaks or industrial accidents.\n\nThis treachery was not exclusive to rogue members of the Walloon Legion. While Thiriart and his expedition waited, Bert Eriksson and the SS-Legion Langemarck lambasted them for their so-called incompetence and failure to control their own men. If Thiriart was able to swallow his pride and approach Eriksson for assistance, the whispers went, then they already would have captured Degrelle by now.\n\nHowever, now was not a time for petty military rivalries or ethnic tensions. A traitor to the Ordensstaat was out there, and he needed to be caught..."

 BRG_cop_priority_flag:0 "We are prioritizing the Sicherheitspolizei."
 BRG_worker_priority_flag:0 "We are prioritizing the skilled workers."

 BRG_das_landwirtschaftsamt_desc:0 "Although the Aryan race shall be able to live self-sufficiently once all decadence has been purged from the Vaterland and the people have been inculcated with true National Socialist thought, we are not yet there.\n\nUnfortunately, the Ordensstaat's food supplies are undergoing a brief availability bottleneck, one that must be addressed through the creation of a new body to better manage these valuable resources. It has been stressed to the Reichsführer-SS that these measures are only temporary and will be reversed once this roadblock to utopia is passed."
 BRG_food_for_factories_desc:0 "It matters not if our leaders have enough to eat if our entire industrial base collapses from starvation. We must make it our utmost priority to make sure that the workers at our most vital factories are properly fed in order to maintain production levels.\n\nWithin reason, of course. We don't want to give a Belgian slave in a camp factory the same quality of life as a German foreman or engineer. A dead body has no use for us, after all."
 BRG_a_simple_ration_desc:0 "In times of war (or similar distress), the idea of the "ration" varies between military and civilian life. For the former, they are dictated what meals they can eat and when. For the latter, they are still given plenty of leeway, and are only limited in their ingredients.\n\nBut why must it be this way? Why should the average workingman not be given the same guidelines as his comrade in the trench? Would it not serve the Volk if they were given the same kinds of nutritious, filling, and easy-to-produce meals?"
 BRG_specialized_assistance_desc:0 "Nowhere in the world have the fires of industry burned so hot as in the Ordensstaat. Momentous strides have been taken by the administration of the Reichsführer-SS and by the Aryan people to transform the Ordensstaat into the workshop of the world. With such a surge in industrial prowess has come the development of a large population of industrial specialists and logistical experts.\n\nWhilst their skills are most suited to industrial production, they may yet be rather effective in agricultural planning. As such, plans shall be drawn up to reorient German specialists to fine tune the fields rather than the forges, should the need soon arise."
 BRG_expand_rodomo_sillos_desc:0 "The Aryan man may labour tirelessly in his fields, reaping harvests unforeseen in their bounty. Yet, without the proper facilities to store the fruits of Aryan labor, it would all be for naught. The grain will rot and the German people will go hungry. Such a state of affairs shall not come to pass, as the Ordensstaat undertakes a grand expansion of the food storage and distribution network.\n\nThis network shall be centered around the facilities of Industriebezirk Rodomo, wherein the labourers shall erect large, central storage facilities, as well as distribution centers in tandem. Soon, agricultural yields shall go to waste no longer, as foodstuffs are distributed across the Ordensstaat in the most timely fashion."
 BRG_fields_of_grain_desc:0 "In order to feed the people of the Ordensstaat, agricultural yields must be increased. Of course, the land we tread upon is fertile, and ripe for agricultural purposes. Seizing the potential of our soil, however, will require no small deal of effort. To stave off disastrous famine, we shall construct large industrial farms, each tuned to reap the greatest outputs that the earth can provide.\n\nThe resources required for this undertaking shall be great yet necessary. Overgrown fields and untamed meadows shall be sown with grain as the silos of the Ordensstaat are made full once more. Such efforts will in most likelihood slightly slow our efforts at further industrialization, however, a laborer can offer no output should he fall dead by famine."
 BRG_food_for_those_who_matter_desc:0 "It matters not whether the people have enough to eat if the men guiding them are starving. If the Ordensstaat's leaders are malnourished, it risks putting everything that the Reichsführer-SS has worked towards in jeopardy. They will be sluggish and prone to error, and in the tense world of today, that cannot be tolerated.\n\nThe answer is clear, the leaders need to eat first. Starting with those the Reichsführer-SS has deemed to be of utmost priority, those of vital importance to the Ordensstaat shall have their daily fill."
 BRG_establish_priority_lists_desc:0 "The distribution of something as vital as food cannot simply be an ad hoc process. A comprehensive and standardized system is necessary in order to properly organize and maximize efficiency in the distribution of rations, while making sure that the most deserving get priority.\n\nEverything must be taken into account: age, rank, military activity, current office, past responsibilities, the state importance of their projects, recommendation from the Reichsführer-SS, no detail is too minor. The consequences are too large to leave anything up to chance."
 BRG_forget_outer_circle_desc:0 "Unfortunately, even within the SS hierarchy, there is not enough for everyone. The stocks are being depleted faster than some have projected, much to the chagrin of the Reichsführer-SS. He knows that some difficult decisions must soon be made about who will get limited supplies of high-quality food, and it is a sacrifice he is willing to make. After all, what is a more noble and virtuous way for an Aryan to suffer than for the good of his race and nation?"
 BRG_crack_the_whip_desc:0 "With the requisitioning of designated food supplies from the less desirable, and their re-allocation to those essential personnel who ensure that the Ordensstaat, we may rest assured that when food begins to run short and the apparatus of the state remain well fed, their loyalty will be without question.\n\nUntil then, there is much work to be done. From the laborers we must ask more, and from the people we must demand more service. Heightened quotas and increased conscription shall soon become necessary measures, and as such the people will inevitably become increasingly unruly. However, our loyal and well fed personnel shall ensure that the people do not get out of hand. We can rest assured of it."
 BRG_waste_not_or_want_not_desc:0 "With such a precious commodity being managed so carefully, the penalties for misappropriating it must be consequently adjusted to reflect its importance. To hoard and waste food in the middle of a declidate situation is the re-emergence of the same degenerate ideas that underpinned Jewish capitalism: using flawed judgement to place the individual's needs above those of the Volk.\n\nThe same approach must be taken. Negligent waste will result in arrest and interrogation by the Gestapo. Intentional waste or hoarding will merit a far more intensive process."
 BRG_emergency_stockpile_measures_desc:0 "Every able man is important to the Ordensstaat, yet some are more important than others. Senior officials, members of critical response groups and key state apparatus, and other such individuals instrumental to the plan of the Reichsführer-SS, must be preserved. As such, with a troubling famine looming closer upon the horizon with each passing day, we must take action to ensure that the resources are available to keep these personnel well fed. This will inevitably require the requisition of food allocations from those less deserving, who will face their reckoning in the coming struggles."
 BRG_develop_new_fertilizers_desc:0 "In the past, few things were more dangerous to a civilization than overfarming. They exploited the land to the point where it would make crops impossible to grow, and they would wither away and fade into history like the dying plants in the fields.\n\nThankfully, due to advances in the agricultural sciences, fertilizers allow farmers to restore the soil's nutrients and keep growing the same crops year after year. If the Ordensstaat is to survive and thrive, we must exploit this to the fullest extent."
 BRG_industrial_aids_desc:0 "National Socialists are not Luddites. Although they seek to preserve the physical and moral purity of the Aryan race through millennia, they recognize the value of modern industry and use it to better their environment. Agronomy is certainly no exception to this.\n\nThe traditional rural life of the future shall not be one with primitive farming implements. Plows and seed drills shall give way to tractors and combines."
 BRG_industriebauernhof_projekte_desc:0 "As industry was greatly expanded, this necessitated the centralization of the population into tight knit urban centers, so that men could work the newly built foundries and factories that dot the land. An ambitious urbanization effort was undertaken by the Ordensstaat, with many being incentivized or coerced into flocking to the cities. However, whilst a city may provide impressive outputs insofar as weaponry or industrial goods are concerned, it provides naught in terms of food, acting as a drain into which the Ordensstaat's food stores are offloaded.\n\nAs such, we are now faced with the difficult decision to roll back such initiatives, for the labourers are needed in the fields now more than ever. And they are needed with due haste. We will do what we must to drive the people back into the fields for now, even if we must demolish entire city blocks to achieve this."
 BRG_the_final_measures_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat has diligently undertaken all possible measures at its disposal to conquer the threat that the famine presents. The loyalty of essential personnel has been secured, the labor of the Volk intensified and mobilized, and previously untamed fields are now sown with grain.\n\nDespite all this, it was inevitable that those weaker and less deserving individuals in our society would perish in these hard times. It is no matter. Their mouths no longer need to be fed, and with this, our food stores shall soon begin to swell once again. With the weakest individuals sacrificed so that the Volk may be fed, and with the ingenious preparations orchestrated by the Reichsführer-SS, the famine shall soon be naught but a cold memory."
 BRG_a_second_try_desc:0 "The efforts undertaken by the Ordensstaat to stave off the great impending famine were monumental. Very few stones were left unturned in our quest to avoid troubling times. All appeared well, as our grain stores began to fill once again with fewer mouths to feed.\n\nYet it was not to last. The few stones that were left yet unturned have brought a reckoning upon the Ordensstaat, as famine has returned once more, like a painful memory come back to haunt the Aryan people. The few remaining stones from underneath which these troubles seep must be turned, regardless of cost."
 BRG_raze_the_cities_desc:0 "In order to meet the necessary quantities of grain to feed the populace in this increasingly complex crisis, radical measures must be taken. Measures which shall make all our prior efforts appear to be little more than token gestures. It begins with our centres of industry.\n\nWhilst the most industrious of our cities certainly produce well in the way of mechanical and industrial goods, it is undeniable that these regions also consume the most food, all the while producing none. If we are to solve this lingering famine in finality, we must raze these factories and pave the regions with great industrial farms, the likes of which are yet unseen in this world. We cannot dither in deciding between the grain or the cog. The cog will not feed the Aryan man nor will it nourish the laborer."
 BRG_survival_of_the_fittest_desc:0 "As the most radical of measures are undertaken, in the current short term we must face the disappointing fact that the food currently does not exist to feed all of the subjects of the Ordensstaat. As such, those who wish to be fed must prove their worth through a days' exceptional labour. Those who just get by and those who do not exert themselves to their maximum in all their labors shall simply not be fed. If prior enticements were not sufficient to encourage the workforce to produce good results, then surely the prospect of an empty stomach at the end of the day and an early grave shall act as a stronger encouragement."
 BRG_tighten_the_belts_desc:0 "Once before, when faced with famine, we had sufficient food in reserve to guarantee to the most essential and loyal soldiers of the Ordensstaat that they would be well fed and content. With the crisis growing ever more concerning, however, this may no longer be so. To ensure that all personnel have at the least something to eat, the rations of even the most loyal SchutzStaffel members must be cut. All, even the most crucial soldiers, must now do their part in self sacrifice for the cause."
 BRG_grab_it_all_desc:0 "Every day, those unworthy and unessential to the Reichsführer-SS's plans continue to fester within the Ordensstaat. Like a tapeworm, they feed upon provisions that were made to nourish the Aryan man. This will continue no longer. We will seize yet more provisions from those deemed unessential to the plans of the Reichsführer, so that those critical to the plan shall live. In the end of it all, the deaths of those being deprived do not matter."
 BRG_burgundian_diet_desc:0 "The German diet, the French diet, the Belgian diet. These are culinary traditions with hundreds of years' worth of influence, full of rich and vibrant characteristics that make them unique and treasured by chefs the world over.\n\nThey are also some of the most decadent, divisive, and un-Aryan ways of living ever known.\n\nIn this lean time, there is no room for sausages, chocolates, and fine wines. This must be a time of uniformity, a time of austerity, a time of singular devotion to the cause of the Reichsführer-SS's vision."
 BRG_nothing_shall_remain_desc:0 "As many essential individuals and German families throughout the Ordensstaat find themselves upon the brink of starvation, some seem to have scarcely taken notice. Many decadent bureaucrats and generals continue on with their needlessly excessive lifestyles, ignorant of the plight of the Ordensstaat. Lavish suppers, several course meals, desserts. For every one of their meals or functions, fifty Aryan men could be healthily put to work.\n\nIt ends now.\n\nThis wastefulness will come to an immediate end. There may be backlash from the Charlemagne collaborators, but it matters not. Their pride and excessive living cannot stand, and their ire is much easier to face than the starvation of thousands of men essential to the plan."
 BRG_root_of_indulgence_desc:0 "As it turns out, there is, in fact, such a thing as wasteful food production. Indeed, not all food that is produced is conducive to our efforts at nourishing the Aryan people. With the inheritance of its territories, the Ordensstaat with it inherited the decadent established food industries so beloved by the degenerate Frenchmen. Cheesemaking. Wineries. All such lavish and excessive foodstuffs must be scuppered, for they are made irrelevant by grain and livestock. All focus must be put into those areas, and those areas alone. The Ordensstaat is not concerned with the fine dining of the fortunate few."
 BRG_some_can_stay_desc:0 "The Charlemagne collaborators, enriched in their cooperation with the Ordensstaat, are known for their lavish dining and decadent ways. Dinner parties and grand meals which could feed dozens of hard working Aryan men are instead swallowed by a fortunate few. It is revolting to think that for each time they dine, food is siphoned away from dozens of hard working Aryan men.\n\nHowever, the collaborators are regrettably essential to both the plan and the day to day operations of the Ordensstaat. We cannot risk their outright disapproval. As such, some of their particularly wasteful practices shall be disallowed, however nobody will pay a particularly watchful eye should they decide to continue with them regardless of regulation."
 BRG_needs_of_the_few_outwiegh_the_many_desc:0 "To further endear Charlemagne to the Reichsführer-SS, a proposal has been put forth: Grant the collaborators tracts of farmland to do with as they please, to feed themselves and their men, primarily. Of course, having large tracts of land from which we cannot extract the most efficient amounts of grain and livestock will reduce output greatly, and surely endanger the lives of many personnel who already rest upon the brink. Yet, despite what it shall cost in productivity and lives, the loyalty of Charlemagne is far more valuable."
 BRG_a_solved_problem_desc:0 "Finally, we may claim that no stone has been left unturned in combating the great famine. The Ordensstaat has undertaken all measures fathomable to ensure that in due time, the famine shall come to an end. As crops bloom and yields increase throughout the seasons, the troubles will come to an end in due time. That is not to say that our struggles have come to an end, for the famine will plague the Ordensstaat and its people for some time still. We simply need not worry, for now it is an issue which shall be guaranteed a resolution.\n\nFinally, we may turn our attention to the plans of the Reichsführer-SS, and do all we can with our current workforce before it continues to expire."

## I'm gonna be blunt. These locs are awful. We need a LitCom to salvage these.

BRG_agri.1.t:0 "The Clanking Gears and Empty Fields"
BRG_agri.1.desc:0 "The Ordensstaat rises! Every day our cities and towns are filled with more smokestacks, more factories, more hapless Untermensch trudging miserably to do their duty to the State and the Aryan. Where once their labor was wasted on trivial pursuits such as degenerate agriculture and inefficient little workshops, now they serve in great and mighty industrial foundries, helping to produce the weapons and supplies that will allow the SS to achieve the vision of our glorious Reichsführer-SS.\n\nOf course, the mass forced shift from an agricultural to industrial economy is not without minor and temporary setbacks. The sudden transition in labor allocation has resulted in a collapse in agricultural yields, and similarily a rapid depletion of food supplies. Especially thanks to the high standards at which the Burgundian System requires the Untermensch to produce there is little hope of sustaining our population's caloric needs indefinitely.\n\nSacrifices will have to be made, naturally among our "less-essential" populations but perhaps even among some of our less pure Aryans as well. We will thus begin drawing up plans to liquidate underperforming workers at the discretion of local commissars. However the number of sub-humans we have to sacrifice for our goals is of course a non-issue, we are merely concerned with fulfilling our needs of supply and demand."
BRG_agri.1.a:0 "The State can not fail."

BRG_agri.2.t:0 "The List of Life"
BRG_agri.2.desc:0 "It seems that food production in the Ordensstaat has continued to decline slightly longer than anticipated. Of course, this is unlikely to inhibit our objectives in the long term, but for now we will have to institute rationing among the SS in order to not exhaust our food supplies even further.\n\nPriority lists will be drawn up, closely tied to the performance history and Aryan purity of individual SS units. Of course, well everyone has to make sacrifices, the greatest burden will be on our non-German collaborator legions.\n\nAlthough some might see this necessity as a threat to the already tenuous loyalty of these forces, our brilliant Reichsführer sees an opportunity within this challenge: that by preferring some of our allies over others in the allocation of food supplies, we can help to strengthen the ties most useful to the Ordensstaat while weakening the capabilities of the other legions. Now the only thing left to decide is which legions will have the honor of receiving the most supplies and attention."
BRG_agri.2.a:0 "We must bind Charlemagne to us."
BRG_agri.2.b:0 "Eriksson deserves a reward."
BRG_agri.2.c:0 "Walloon must eat."

BRG_agri.3.t:0 "Scraps for the Workers"
BRG_agri.3.desc:0 "The black-suited shock troops of the SS are of course Burgundy's most hallowed institution and the first line of defense, but it is the factories and workforce that supports them behind the front lines that too often go unmentioned and uncelebrated. It is here that our meticulous and hawk-eyed commissars watch over the toiling Untermensch, to make sure that every gun, every trigger, every bullet, is made to the finest degree possible.\n\nUnfortunately, due to our recent minor issues in the area of food production, we must now take steps to distribute our remaining supplies in a manner that assures that attrition among our factory workers does not reach levels disruptive to supply. Thankfully, the most brilliant minds among our Aryan scientists have developed new methods to calculate the exact caloric intake that each individual worker requires. We will thus be able to assure that they receive exactly the minimum to continue working -- but no more -- so as to maintain the careful balance between short term success and long term sustainability."
BRG_agri.3.a:0 "It's time to trim the fat."

BRG_agri.4.t:0 "Bread for the Soldiers"
BRG_agri.4.desc:0 "The strength and greatness of the Ordensstaat is undeniable. Where else in history has there been a nation such as we that prioritizes efficiency over degeneracy, and racial purity over petty notions of "stability". But the chain is only as strong as its lengths working in unison, and it is the SS that serves as the chain that binds Burgundy together.\n\nAlthough we had previously hoped that our food supply concerns would not reach levels threatening to our pure Aryan soldiers, it seems that we must now take steps to preserve their nutritional content and thus their prowess on the battlefield. Naturally, the resources allocated to this endeavor will be much greater than those previously made available for the factory workers and Untermensch laborers. The SS is our rock, our sword, our guiding light. They are an extension of the will of the Reichsführer and the Aryan race. Still though, if we are to see our greater aims achieved everyone will have to make sacrifices."
BRG_agri.4.a:0 "Whatever's necessary."

BRG_agri.5.t:0 "The Burgundian Bounty"
BRG_agri.5.desc:0 "Glory to the Ordensstaat! As always the inevitable march of Aryan progress against degeneracy and cowardice has proven able to overcome all opposition. The agricultural shortfall that threatened to undermine the incredible progress made by our nation has at last been addressed, and soon the famine will be a thing of the past!\n\nBy a combination of brilliant Aryan engineering, the sacrifice, and willpower of our brave SS, we have managed to increase crop yields and reduce consumption among the Untermensch by amounts significant enough to ensure that although a few more of those among the lesser races may continue to die, even some within our allied legions in the SS, the threat of food shortages to our power projection and military prowess is negligible. Thanks to our new agricultural methods and precise allocation measurements for manual labor workers, we will have bountiful surpluses for years to come.\n\nAlthough minor logistical issues continue to bedevil our nation, these will no doubt soon be resolved and we can return to our primary objective: the completion of the vision of our glorious Reichsführer-SS."
BRG_agri.5.a:0 "Fuel for the tanks, food for the soldiers!"

BRG_agri.6.t:0 "The System Carries On"
BRG_agri.6.desc:0 "In many ways, it is almost astonishing the honor bestowed upon the soldiers of the Ordensstaat. While the warriors of the other nations of the world fight for their petty warlords, or degenerate notions of "democracy or justice", or for the scraps of glory their inferior races deem proud and magnificent, the SS fights for the one true master-race, and its eternal rule over the planet. Within the heart of every true son of Burgundy, it is known that our triumph is inevitable. It is the destiny of the Aryan to be victorious against impossible odds, even though he walks his path alone.\n\nAlas, although the path ends at utopia, it is not an easy one. Many times we have been confronted with challenges that seemed impossible to overcome. When our Beloved Reichsführer was exiled from his Fatherland, when our first attempt to destroy the old man Hitler and his crumbling revisionist National Socialism failed, a few weak-willed commanders thought that we had been defeated. Now once more we are faced with an existential threat to the Ordensstaat -- famine. It seems that the measures taken to alleviate the shortages caused by rampant industrialization were not as effective as hoped, and we are now faced once more with an existential crisis that threatens the very survival of the Aryan race.\n\nHowever, just as the Aryan will always be challenged by the members of lesser and effeminate races out of cowardice and jealousy, it is equally his racial characteristic to defeat these challenges, even against impossible odds. In this truth we find solace: it is we alone who have the will and strength to do what must be done. The weak must die. The lives of the worthy will be sacrificed, their men, women, and children doomed to starvation so that the Ordensstaat can continue. Although the degenerate filth will bear the greatest part of this correction, it is possible that some of true Aryan blood will die as well. Should this be the case, we will remember them as we march forwards, and their names shall be carved as heros to be remembered in the eons after the cleansing fire rids this world of the Untermensch scourge."
BRG_agri.6.a:0 "Only a minor issue."

BRG_agri.7.t:0 "The Tightest Belt Possible"
BRG_agri.7.desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seems that the famine in Burgundy has only gotten worse. This should not in any way be attributed to failures of planning amongst the State or SS, but instead by the sheer weight of degeneracy among the native population. While it seems that our "new" agricultural methods and calorie allowance systems may have not produced quite the reduction in food deficit that we had predicted, the real problem is the stinking filthy Untermensch who seem to be unable to spend even a single waking day without drowning their pathetic sorrows in wine and cheese.\n\nWhile we have so far been willing to turn our eyes to avoid offending our "allied" Untermensch divisions, the time for such niciites is past. Starting immediately the Ordensstaat will implement a blanket ban on all luxury native foods. Only when consumption is standardized and regulated will we be able to refocus our capabilities on the real struggle."
BRG_agri.7.a:0 "Of course it was the degenerates all along."

BRG_agri.8.t:0 "The March of Progress"
BRG_agri.8.desc:0 "The Ordensstaat is triumphant once again! It seems that our decision to push the people to the maximum extent possible has paid off. They are producing as never before, all with minimal food supplies. Of course, there are still a few minor problems - it seems that a few of our workers have been so immersed in racial degeneracy for so long that the exact amount of calories calculated by our brilliant Aryan scientists doesn't suffice for their standard work day. Even worse, their sloth and weakness seems to only worsen after we apply corrective measures. Nonetheless, the SS high command is satisfied with the progress made, and now seeks to shift our energies to the completion of the brilliant designs of our beloved Reichsführer-SS.\n\nDespite our victory over famine, a few low level officers seem to doubt the full extent of our accomplishment in this area. They treacherously allege widespread falsification of statistics, and a massive hidden die-off of workers, and even lower ranked SS members. While we'd love to launch a full investigation to show these fools exactly how wrong they are, there simply isn't time. For now, we must simply redouble our efforts to launch the great global transformation, and hope that our existing food supplies are sufficient to achieve this goal."
BRG_agri.8.a:0 "Another triumph for our race."

BRG_agri.9.t:0 "Marching on Empty"
BRG_agri.9.desc:0 "It seems that the road to victory is not free of the occasional minor setback. As we strive to find the perfect balance of food production within the Ordensstaat -- just enough that our factories and soldiers continue their laudable work, but not enough to spread the poison of excess and degeneracy in our ranks -- our progress has the regrettable side-effect of reducing the food stocks of several secondary SS units. All these are not the shock troopers who bring such terror to the enemies of National Socialism, but rather lower-tier soldiers trained and equipped for partisan suppression and guarding production facilities, mass starvation has greatly weakened their effectiveness on the battlefield.\n\nOf course, in the grand scheme of our crucial work for the betterment of the Aryan and the triumph of National Socialism, this is but a slight hiccup. No doubt, the Reichsführer-SS and his advisors will quickly discover a brilliant solution. In the meantime, we'll just have to live with less, and hope that none of the vile rebels that still infest the Ordensstaat are able to take advantage of this situation."
BRG_agri.9.a:0 "It'll be worth it in time."

BRG_agri.10.t:0 "Fleshless Men, Fruitless Factories."
BRG_agri.10.desc:0 "The long term purpose of the Ordensstaat is of course to annihilate the degenerate Untermensch of the world entirely. Their pathetic wails do not stir our sympathies, nor does their well-deserved suffering and constant griping about work conditions. It is unfortunate that we are so dependent on Untermensch labor in the short term, as true Aryans would no doubt be able to perform these tasks much more efficiently at lower cost in resources. But alas, the current demographic circumstances of the Ordensstaat mandate that for the moment we keep the lower-races working, and fed just enough to make this possible.\n\nIt is perhaps because of the slightly-overzealous efforts of our great Aryan soldiers of the SS in furthering these long term goals that our ability to maintain the aforementioned balance has been somewhat weakened of late. Due to our ongoing reform of the Burgundian food supply-chain, there has been a sudden decrease in the foodstuffs available for factory-workers and general laborers. In the long term, this only means that there will be less Untermensch for us to defeat in the final war, but for now this has severely reduced the output of our military and civilian factories. If we are to succeed in fulfilling the brilliant designs of our great Reichsführer-SS, we must find a way to ameliorate this situation, and soon."
BRG_agri.10.a:0 "Perhaps we can find other ways of motivating them."

BRG_agri.11.t:0 "The Famine Is Over"
BRG_agri.11.desc:0 "It has been a painful process, and it has cost us dearly, but our food shortages are finally a problem of the past.\n\nThe ReichsFührer is satisfied with our current production now. Although some of our measures were indeed a little extreme, even by our standards, the results don't lie; the series of famines we've been subjected to are finally, truly over. The Ordensstaat can once again focus on implementing the plan without having to worry about another food shortage."
BRG_agri.11.a:0 "The Reichsführer will be pleased."

BRG_agri.12.t:0 "The Mantra"
BRG_agri.12.desc:0 "Work, or die.\n\nIt was a simple mantra. Three simple words. Words that Leon repeated to himself each day as he awoke at dawn to work the farm, along with two dozen other workers who had been conscripted. Some of his friends in the lumber field had protested. They were lumberjacks, not farmers. They knew nothing about the trade. A few had been subsequently shot, two rounds in the forehead. They weren't worth torturing and putting back into the field.\n\nWork, or die.\n\nThe labor was backbreaking in a different way than he was used to. He had cut trees for a living, and even he was exhausted. The land would be beautiful, had he not found people passed out or dead on the grass or flowers. He couldn't stop working though. Burgundian overseers patrolled, and the unproductive were culled. There were always more who took their place.\n\nWork, or die.\n\nSome days he worked in the grain plant, inside that blot on the idyllic countryside. One where the grain was ground, and meat processed. You had to be careful not to lose hands or fingers, like many workers did. But even then you could not stop. Wrap a cloth around the stump and keep working, because otherwise you would vanish.\n\nWork, or die.\n\nHe woke up before sunrise, and he returned after sunset. He fell unconscious besides a wife he'd not spoken to in days, having barely made enough money to feed her for the day. Yet he couldn't stop, because if he stopped, he would die, and so would she. So he repeated the mantra, again, and again, because he had no choice."
BRG_agri.12.a:0 "Work, or die."

BRG_agri.13.t:0 "Desperate Treason"
BRG_agri.13.desc:0 "It wasn't supposed to be like this.\n\nNiels Kürschner was a proud Aryan man, one of blonde hair and sapphire eyes. A man who had devoted his life to the state and the Reichsführer's vision. He had a beautiful Aryan wife, and two perfect Aryan children. Burgundy was to be a paradise for them. At the start, it had been. Some would say it still was.\n\nTheir home was spartan, in full accordance with the true Aryan spirit. His wife raised their children. The Reichsführer's portrait hung on their wall. His son had earned the "Burgundian Patriotism Award" at school, and his baby daughter had just performed her first sieg heil. He should be proud. They should be happy. But pride couldn't blind him to reality.\n\nTheir plates were emptier. His paycheck had been cut. Their house was a shack. The stores were bare of basic essentials. Many nights they'd gone to bed hungry and dirty. If Burgundy was a paradise, then why were they living barely better than slaves? It was when he'd seen his children listless and thin, he and his wife had acted - and betrayed their race.\n\nThere were dissidents and rebels in Burgundy. German spies and traitorous SS Legions. As a loyal Aryan, he should have turned them all in. Instead he listened to their offers. Money, food, clothes, in return for small things. Information mostly, sometimes just looking the other way, but that didn't sell for much. Basic necessities were becoming even more scarce.\n\nDesperation had driven him here, standing beside a crate of weapons. Working in logistics allowed him opportunities, and one cache was easy enough. The men he'd sold it to smiled, and gave him a crate of dry goods direct from Germany. Basic, cheap items, but they were more precious than gold now. Once, he'd believed in the dream of Burgundy, but now that dream was dead."
BRG_agri.13.a:0 "His family was all that mattered."

 BRG_our_true_goal_desc:0 "A successful first nuclear test is cause enough for celebration, but the time for focus and hard work is ahead of us. If this data is not to go to waste, we must analyze it and use it to help us look to the future."
 BRG_draft_the_lists_desc:0 "The foundation of the Aryan race is selection. The wheat is separated from the chaff, and only those who improve the Volk are allowed to survive and flourish. The Reichsführer-SS's plans allow for so many opportunities for culling the weak, the first of which concerns who is able to enter the bunkers in the first place. Although there are already lists of people considered to be of prime Aryan breeding stock, the lists must be further pruned by considering skillsets, loyalty to the Party, roles within the SS and the Ordensstaat, and other important factors to determine usefulness to the Volk."
 BRG_find_the_locations_desc:0 "As convenient as it would be, bunkers cannot be built everywhere. Those too close to a city become prime targets for enemy sabotage, not to mention the risk of damage by nuclear blasts. This need for a rural setting, plus the environmental conditions that are conducive to underground construction in the first place, significantly narrow down potential construction sites. However, necessity is the mother of innovation."
 BRG_project_bergentruckung_desc:0 "The locations have been finalized, the plans have been approved, and now the ground must be broken. Not just for the bunkers that will save the Aryan race from certain death, but also for the tools that will deliver a swift end to the lesser races of the world. Time is of the essence; the sooner that these are finished, the sooner the Reichsführer-SS's vision may be fulfilled."
 BRG_the_agents_of_destruction_desc:0 "The silos are our salvation, the tool through which the Reichsführer-SS's vision shall become reality. Their importance cannot be understated, and their protection cannot be anything short of absolute. There can be no room for petty partisanship or the subversion of regionalists, and nothing in Heaven or Hell can be permitted to stop these from being built."
 BRG_hiding_the_silos_desc:0 "The ancients believed that in warfare, it was wise to appear weak to enemies so they would be unprepared for your true military might. And, as they often were, the ancients were right today. French spies, American planes, nosy German inspectors, Breton smugglers, and Swiss surveillance all pose a risk of uncovering the silos and revealing our intentions. This cannot be allowed."
 BRG_expanded_uranium_production_desc:0 "Just as a baker relies on a farmer to aid his livelihood, so does a missile rely on a mine. Enriched uranium does not grow on trees, and the lands of the Ordensstaat fortunately have enough to sustain a uranium mining operation. However, it can sustain more, and uranium is needed more than ever."
 BRG_the_grasping_hand_desc:0 "Now that the ground has been prepared, the construction of the bunkers themselves may begin in earnest. No expense shall be spared and no corner shall be cut, for these is no wiser investment than one in the future of the Aryan race. We shall be like the farmers of old, sowing the lands of the Ordensstaat with the seeds of the future!"
 BRG_preparing_for_the_new_beginning_desc:0 "Now that the ground has been prepared, the construction of the bunkers themselves may begin in earnest. No expense shall be spared and no corner shall be cut, for these is no wiser investment than one in the future of the Aryan race. We shall be like the farmers of old, sowing the lands of the Ordensstaat with the seeds of the future!"
 BRG_expanded_bunker_design_desc:0 "We have the time, we have the resources, we have the manpower, and we definitely have the will, so why not? Every fit and genetically viable Aryan who is saved is one more guarantee against the extinction of the human race's finest. It will also save the Reichsführer-SS and his staff from making uncomfortable choices about which racially pure loyalists to National Socialism deserve priority within the group."
 BRG_upgraded_ventilation_research_desc:0 "Mankind was not designed to live underground; cave-ins, stagnant airflow, and dangerous pockets of heavy gases conspire to make the miner or cave-dweller's life a short one. But the Aryan is able to adapt in both his body and his tools. The power of superior Teutonic engineering, plus a plethora of redundancies, shall make sure that the inhabitants of the bunkers can survive for a long, long time."
 BRG_finalize_the_evacuation_plans_desc:0 "The bunkers, however, are pointless if the plan to fill them is incomplete. Who is worthy of survival, and how they will reach salvation, are both secrets which must be kept closely guarded by those close to the Reichsführer-SS. The unworthy may try and slip in in a desperate attempt to save themselves, and the egocentric among them may take offense to their exclusion from the list."
 BRG_the_future_secured_desc:0 "At last, the Reichsführer-SS may rest easy. The bunkers are built, the lists are finalized, and the silos are filled and armed. Now all that remains is one question:\n\nWhen shall we pull the trigger?"

 BRG_nuclear.1.t:0 "Projects Hoddmimisholt and Lifthrasir"
 BRG_nuclear.1.d:0 "With the initiation of the next phase of the Ordensstaat's atomic development plans, Office XI of the RHSA has entered into collaboration with the Ahnenerbe's nuclear physics institute and the SS-WVHA Office C (Buildings and Works). The resulting Joint Committee for Aryan Survival have activated preassigned resources for conducting Projects Hoddmimisholt and Lifthrasir. Project summary and status follows:\n\nProject Hodmimisholt: The surveying (Stage I), minework (Stage II) and concretework (Stage III) of preselected sites in the Northwestern and Western Alpine regions, to ensure the protection of high value military and civilian racial assets in the event of global thermonuclear devastation. Outfitting (Stage IV), camouflage (Stage V) and connection to rail and road (Stage VI) to follow.\nStatus: Stage I complete, Stage II in progress.\n\nProject Lifthrasir: The shifting of preselected, non-essential personnel to the Alpine Region to reduce transport strain (Stage I), the construction of high-speed, underground rail lines from Paris and other key cities to Alpine bunkers (Stage II), the deployment of Faraday cages to network to shield from potential EMP effects (Stage III). Notifying preselected personnel of situation and procedures, in order of declining import (Stages IV-VI) to follow.\nStatus: Stage I in process."
 BRG_nuclear.1.a:0 "We must race time to save our race."

 BRG_nuclear.2.t:0 "What Corners Can Be Cut"
 BRG_nuclear.2.d:0 ""Please, listen!" Werner groaned into the phone, "No, I won't shut up, I worked on the verdammte Gibraltar Dam, I am not some Italian bridge engineer, Hans! You have to listen to me when I say we need a better budget! The shelters are not going to be secure unless we... Yes, fine, thank you, please send it up the line and call me back tomorrow. Yes, after lunch. Thank you. Bye, Hans. Yes, I will say hello to my wife, bye Hans. Heil Himmler. Arschloch."\n\nThe engineer hung up the phone, straightened his sweat-stained shirt collar and left the temporary barracks serving as his office. He found his assistant checking off a list near the pit in the Alpine hillside that would hopefully one day be the entrance of a bunker.\n\n"Herr Werner, how did the phone call go?"\n\n"About as expected, Erik, about as expected. If we want the concrete to be properly reinforced in those expanded storehouses the brass want, we will need to appropriate the funds from another budget post. I'm thinking we could maybe cut the backup generator, would save us a few million reichsmark."\n\n"Should we really risk cutting such a critical redundancy, Sir? We've already stripped the reserve air filtration system from the plans."\n\n"Look at it this way, Erik, I'm one of the top civilian engineers in the Ordensstaat. If I haven't been offered a place in this little SS clubhouse, there's not a chance you will be, so why not just complete our job to build a damn bunker and get paid for it? In the offchance this place is actually needed, if any of these bunkers are needed, the world is already in the pits, and we'll have bigger concerns than if some bureaucrat's fan is working. Besides, the Hauptamt-bunker has a nuclear reactor if I hear right, so nobody dangerous is going to sit pretty here in this diesel-driven shithole. Make the cuts.""
 BRG_nuclear.2.a:0 ""Jawohl, Herr Hauptingenieur!""

 BRG_nuclear.3.t:0 "Evacuation Plans"
 BRG_nuclear.3.d:0 "The Reichsführer was impressed. The duo debriefing him on the status of projects Hoddmimisholt and Lifthrasir showed no signs of being scared of him, neither the balding engineer nor the youthful, energetic architect. It was a welcome change of pace from the normal sniveling cowardice of the underlings he had been saddled with ever since the Old Führer had given him the chance to turn the Ordensstaat into the sword and shield of the Aryan race. He allowed himself a brief, fond remembrance of the days he and Heydrich had stood shoulder to shoulder against the plots of Göring, glory days long gone, but then snapped his attention back to the presentation. The engineer had stopped his progress report on the bunker systems and the architect had stepped forward once again, ordering the SS man manning the projector to change the slide to one depicting his plans for Project Lifthrasir.\n\n"Now, Lifthrasir, in many ways, presented us with a unique challenge. As my colleague mentioned earlier, while creating atomic-proof facilities for an estimated four hundred thousand people is a challenge, it is within the parameters faced by Organisation Todt during the War, and with enough funding doable within a four to six year period. Now, the rail network for Project Lifthrasir is a whole other matter. Even with the hundred and sixty thousand subjects that are in the process of being resettled in the Alpine region, that leaves us two hundred and forty thousand subjects, eighty thousand of whom are considered critical, primarily located in the Paris, Kampen and Pickardien regions. My proposal is as follows. Three four-lane subterranean rail lines encased in reinforced concrete at a depth of 11 meters. Since we will only have time for a single departure in the estimated 21 minutes before impact in a surprise attack scenario, I propose using the extant Paris Metro as a temporary shelter for non-critical personnel...""
 BRG_nuclear.3.a:0 "Paris will have its own Exodus, through the Metro."

 BRG_nuclear.4.t:0 "A Lost Gambit"
 BRG_nuclear.4.d:0 "The SD reports the Swiss government is in possession of photographic evidence of our bunker construction work in the Alps, some of which is apparently visible from mountaintops across our shared border. Despite our swift executions of the usual suspects, the Swiss keep discovering more details about our projects, suggesting it might be genuine find of theirs. Still, rumor swirls in the academic community of our nation that they were tipped off by an insider, and many professors, architects and engineers are all blaming each other for the leaking. We must act soon to suppress this information leaking wider, not only to stop the world from finding out, but also to ensure our scientists don't all murder each other."
 BRG_nuclear.4.a:0 "Send in our agents immediately to destroy any paper trails or analyses they might have already."

 BRG_nuclear.5.t:0 "[Get_newspaper_header]Burgundian Bunkers?"
 BRG_nuclear.5.d:0 "Shocking news out of the hermit state of Europe today, as the Swiss government reports that Burgundy has begun the construction of a series of large bunkers in the Western Alps. The move has earned much scorn from critics of the Reich, who say they are hidey holes for the Burgundian leadership in the case of armed conflict with Germany. The Ordensstaat, in a rare communication with the outside world, has issued a condemnation of the "Infidious lies of the Swiss," but has not denied they are building bunkers. It reminds to be seen why they are wasting time on this matter."
 BRG_nuclear.5.a:0 "The beginning of a Burgundian Spring, or just more corruption?"
 BRG_nuclear.5.b:0 "Have Switzerland added to the list of priority nuclear targets."

 BRG_nuclear.6.t:0 "Loyalties in Doubt"
 BRG_nuclear.6.d:0 "Our propaganda has struggled to hide the Swiss reveal of the bunkers from the populace, too many still have hidden radio apparatus and Swiss radio is not properly jammed yet given the low priority of containing it until now. There have been multiple protests by Frenchmen calling for proper shelters to be built across the nation, and the SS is fraying at the seam as countless members demand to know why they have not been offered a spot in a bunker yet. The damage from this disastrous discovery will be a sore on the Ordensstaat for a long time, and put the Plan in danger. But we cannot relent, the fate of the Aryan race depends on us!"
 BRG_nuclear.6.a:0 "We should have hid the bunkers quicker, verdammt!"

 BRG_nuclear.7.t:0 "The Uranium Crisis"
 BRG_nuclear.7.d:0 "The scientific mastery of the Ordensstaat has caused us to be suffering from success once more. In our rush to build nuclear reactors and atomic warheads for tests and actual weapons, we seem to have exhausted the three major uranium mines within our territory. While we still have a handful of smaller extraction sites active, this combined with the loss of uranium shipments from Afrika after the Civil War and the closing of our borders, means we now find ourselves in a critical shortage of uranium, potentially jeopardizing our entire nuclear project! Efforts must immediately be taken to secure new sources of uranium."
 BRG_nuclear.7.a:0 "Time to crack out some geiger counters and make some phone calls!"

 BRG_nuclear.8.t:0 "Uranium Fever"
 BRG_nuclear.8.d:0 "We have tried our best but been unable to secure a sufficient supply of weapons-grade uranium before eating through our reserves. Our atomic project is seriously compromised; we have no choice but to cut down their progress significantly by furloughing most of our research and testing staff until we can scrape together the necessary uranium to progress. We must take action!"
 BRG_nuclear.8.a:0 "So this is why uranium ore is worth its weight in gold..."

 BRG_nuclear.9.t:0 "Missile Jealousy"
 BRG_nuclear.9.d:0 "Our unique internal situation has presented us with a challenge regarding the placement of nuclear silos throughout our territory. All the most remote land, most suitable for silos, are in regions controlled by the potentially disloyal legions. We must thread carefully if we do not want them to try to use their position to leverage control of the weapons."
 BRG_nuclear.9.a:0 "We just need to be discreet..."

 BRG_nuclear.10.t:0 "Silos For Miles"
 BRG_nuclear.10.d:0 "The majority of intercontinental missile silos are now in place, and we have made sure to locate them in remote and less travelled areas, to reduce the chance of them being spotted by the Resistance or foreign spy planes. The missiles are gradually being dispersed along with trained launch personnel and the warheads installed. One potential challenge is the native legions, as they present an uncertain variable in our calculations. As such, the Reichsführer has decreed that the silo construction in the vast Ardennes forest and in the brambles of the upper Loire Valley is to be kept discreet and with minimal information to the local strongmen about the ongoing construction and its purpose. No chances will be taken with this if we can avoid it."
 BRG_nuclear.10.a:0 "Distrust and verify"

 BRG_nuclear.11.t:0 "Watchful Eyes"
 BRG_nuclear.11.d:0 "The unpaved forest road rarely hosted traffic, yet today there were dozens upon dozens of vehicles travelling along it. Trucks carrying personnel, open ones carrying gear and building materials, staff cars carrying senior officers, yet the most important of all the vehicles was the slowly rumbling missile carrier, a huge and unmistakable shape on its back, albeit covered by a tarpaulin.\n\nNobody in the convoy knew about the silent observers in the forest, studying them through military binoculars and telescopes.\n\nThe observers were well aware of both their origin, their cargo, and their destination; the well hidden, newly constructed missile silos deep in the forest. Deep in the Flemish Ardennes. On Flemish soil. And the Flemish SS did not like secrets being kept from them on Flemish soil."
 BRG_nuclear.11.a:0 "Langemarck does not take kindly to being left out."

 BRG_nuclear.12.t:0 "sabotage in the langemarck factories!"
 BRG_nuclear.12.d:0 "soon i will be president"
 BRG_nuclear.12.a:0 "carter power will soon go away"

 BRG_nuclear.13.t:0 "Sudden Shortages"
 BRG_nuclear.13.d:0 "The Reichsführer pored through the reports and ledgers from the Ardennes construction site. They did not please him. He picked up a bell at his desk and rang it, causing his secretary to appear. "Hedwig, are Eicke and Peiper ready?"\n\n"Yes, Reichsführer. Meine herren, he is ready for you."\n\nHimmler rolled a pencil between his fingers, his narrow eyes staring into the air as the security chief and Leibstandarte officer entered the chilly castle office. "There is no need to sit, gentlemen, my instructions to you are brief and simple."\n\n"Something peculiar is occurring with our construction sites in the Ardennes. Missing equipment, materials, weapons for the garrisons, rocket fuel, even the workers themselves at times disappear into the forests or from the train stations where they are unloaded. I believe one or more of our enemies are involved. I want the two of you, my best bookkeeper and most trusted soldier, personally on site to investigate; an office in Antwerp and a staff car have been set aside for you. You are to report to me and Heinrich Müller only. Any questions?"\n\nEicke, the aging RHSA bureaucrat and Waffen-SS officer, raised an arm hesitantly. "Thank you for this honor mein Reichsführer, but I have one question. Will we be working alongside Bert Eriksson of SS-Division Langemarck on this matter? They have great resources in the region.""
 BRG_nuclear.13.a:0 ""Yes, their contacts with the locals could come in handy.""
 BRG_nuclear.13.b:0 ""No, we have more qualified staff, and they should not know about the silos.""

 BRG_nuclear.14.t:0 "A Call In the Night"
 BRG_nuclear.14.d:0 "The Reichsführer did not enjoy being woken in the middle of the night, but he knew any call to his personal quarters would only be possible from about a dozen of his most trusted or important lieutenants. Thus, his annoyance at being woken well after even his own remarkably late bedtime was quickly replaced by a giddy eagerness towards whatever global crisis could warrant his personal intervention, in turn fading to a soft horror as he realized it could be THE Crisis. The Plan was not ready, the Aryans were not safe yet, he needed more time, at least a few more months... Steadying himself and banishing such unworthy angst, he picked up the phone on the ninth or tenth ring.\n\n"You have reached him, what is it?"\n\n"Mein Reichsführer, I assume you can recognize my accent. It's Bert Eriksson, from Division Langemarck?"\n\n"I know you. What is so urgent you need to wake me?"\n\n"I have heard rumors about your men coming to Antwerp to investigate the loss of... sensitive goods, bringing in an investigative team from Paris. I would like to tell you this is not necessary, Langemarck already has the investigation well in hand. We have been on the trail of missing military gear and supplies for months, we believe it is the same thieves involved, Resistance sympathizers."\n\n"Then I should definitely come, we cannot risk any rebels getting their hands on these... sensitive goods."\n\n"With all due respect Reichsführer, it would be highly dangerous and irresponsible for leading German officers to barge into a hotbed of terrorist activity and assassinations like Flandern. Not to mention it would be seen as an insult to Division Langemarck if their leadership do not explicitly trust them to catch some terrorists. Please Sir, we have this well in hand, do not risk the stability of the Ordensstaat over some thefts. Have your men work with me instead, this can be resolved with local finesse.""
 BRG_nuclear.14.a:0 ""Peiper and Eicke are in charge, end of story.""
 BRG_nuclear.14.b:0 ""I expect a full report by the end of the week.""

 BRG_nuclear.15.t:0 "The Antwerp Beobachter"
 BRG_nuclear.15.d:0 "Division Langemarck has over the last few days, in collaboration with SD-Flandern and the SiPo, conducted a series of raids on suspected Resistance hideouts, as well arresting several hundred railroad workers, in an effort to locate stolen valuables and a missing shipment of coconuts taken from the railyard in central Antwerp last week. Bert Eriksson, Oberführer of the Division Langemarck, has spoken with us and assured us that rapid discovery and punishment is the fate of all those who desire to steal from the good, law-abiding Aryan citizens of Antwerp.\n\nSources that wish to stay anonymous have informed this newspaper that the alleged criminals are radical Marxist terror groups of primarily mixed-race individuals who desired to sell their stolen goods to Breton smugglers to fund their war against the New Order. One source insists it was in fact the theft of the coconuts which really exposed the heinous crimes of the terrorists, as they were seen leaving with the highly recognizable crate. From all of us here at the Antwerp Beobachter, we say "Take that, terrorists! Your ploys can never escape the sword of Justitia for long! May Division Langemarck hunt you all down!" May justice be dealt to these foul thieves."
 BRG_nuclear.15.a:0 "Stealing coconuts? Pathetic."

 BRG_nuclear.16.t:0 ""Coconut" Theft Preliminary Report"
 BRG_nuclear.16.d:0 "Bert Eriksson of Division Langemarck confirms that last night at 2311 MEZ, soldiers from his division stormed the last of the six known hideouts of the terror group known as Red Night. Fourteen terrorists were killed in the ensuing firefight, bringing the total number of liquidated terrorists and sympathizers in the proceedings of the investigation to two hundred and three. Sixteen crates of rifles and computer panels were seized. The remaining supplies have yet to be located, but three terrorists were caught alive. Two of them sadly expired on scene due to wounds sustained, and the last suffered a fatal heart attack after a mere seventeen hours of questioning. The interrogator has been reprimanded for overeagerness. Still, the suspect revealed the location of the remaining supplies as being with a man called "Pierre from Nantes." Division Langemarck will put all available resources towards locating this suspect and terminate him and potential buyers of the missing items with extreme prejudice."
 BRG_nuclear.16.a:0 "Well, at least we found some of them."

 BRG_nuclear.17.t:0 "The End of the Road"
 BRG_nuclear.17.d:0 "We have deployed men across Flandern to investigate the missing silo materiel from recently. While suspicion lies primarily with the workers involved with shipping the goods, it is possible they have been stolen already on the factory floor. Sadly, our investigations along these lines have turned up little besides the odd Resistance sympathizer and illegal newspapers. It seems we may never know the extent of the scheme for absolute certain, but hopefully this show force will have put the scare in potentially disloyal factory workers. The arrested can keep working, as slaves, and on our premises."
 BRG_nuclear.17.a:0 "Another dead end..."

 BRG_nuclear.18.t:0 "Investigation Stalling"
 BRG_nuclear.18.d:0 "Another gunshot rang out as Joachim Peiper shot yet another factory worker. As his subordinates rushed to throw the body in the pile with the eleven previous workers who had refused to cooperate, he turned to Eicker, an almost comical sight in the large leather coat he wore to conceal him as just another SS commander, yet still the one in charge given his seniority.\n\n"No luck, Sir. It's the same as in all the other factories here in Antwerp. The scum won't talk. All over Flanders our men keep finding nothing in the factories, yet the materiel keeps disappearing even with all our purges of the shipping staff. It must be going missing from the factories."\n\n"That much is obvious even to me, Peiper. So many of the workers would not have been so tight-lipped if they were not concealing something, the ones that truly don't know anything are the ones who make up their desperate stories to avoid being shot."\n\n"Then why did you have me shoot them, Sir?"\n\n"Because they lied to their betters, Peiper. You have much to learn yet. Anyway, I think we might be onto something here, it might be better to bring in some proper interrogation staff from Paris to get this sorry lot talking about their masters. Incarcerate the rest, soldiers!"\n\nPeiper followed the elder SS officer out of the arms factory. "With all due respect, Sir, would it not save us more time and progress to go directly after Eriksson? He was far too eager to keep you away from Antwerp, he clearly knows more than he is letting on."\n\n"I am suspicious of him, but I cannot just hand over an SS Oberführer to Müller, it would cause big problems with Division Langemarck. Though...""
 BRG_nuclear.18.a:0 ""No, let's stick with the workers. Let us put the screws on them.""
 BRG_nuclear.18.b:0 ""Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt to have Eriksson followed...""

 BRG_nuclear.19.t:0 "A Problem Resolved?"
 BRG_nuclear.19.d:0 "Thanks to the intrepid investigative skill of the Reichsführer's representatives and the SD intervention team, we have located a significant amount of the missing supplies, located in a garage in an Antwerp suburb. Sadly, the family owning the garage have disappeared, and the railroad worker we interrogated to find it had a concealed cyanide capsule in a hollow tooth, allowing him to avoid naming his employers before expiring. The interrogation of hundreds of industrial workers also experienced numerous cases of similar pills being used for suicide, suggesting the mysterious thieves commands significant loyalty from their supporters. Most importantly, multiple stashes of the missing war equipment was located, showcasing clearly that it was primarily stolen by treasonous factory workers. In his wisdom, the Reichsführer has decided cutting off the source of the thefts is enough for now, and have ordered the workers of the factories to be reassigned to work camps in Wallonien, with loyal workers from Paris taking their place in the factories. There should be no more problems in the future. It seems the puppetmasters will elude us for now."
 BRG_nuclear.19.a:0 "At least we can sleep soundly again."

 BRG_nuclear.20.t:0 "Leaping To Langemarck"
 BRG_nuclear.20.d:0 "SS-Division Langemarck's leader, Bert Eriksson, extended an arm over his desk, withith a plate full of Belgian waffles. "Waffle, Herr Eicker? They're fresh out of the oven."\n\nEicker raised an eyebrow. "How were you able to make such a luxury?"\n\nEriksson froze. "W-we pooled our sugar rations around the office. I assure you Sir, we just wanted to present something special this once."\n\nThe aging officer smiled. "I am just teasing you, Oberführer Eriksson, though you should try to stay more true to Aryan frugality. Still, I know you have the Aryan spirit within you, you have risen through our ranks very rapidly. Not everyone could command an entire division while still in his early thirties. You carry our might, Eriksson."\n\n"Thank you for the kind words, mein Reichsführer. I hope we will soon discover this ring of thieves together."\n\n"I hope so too, Oberführer. We hear much about you in the Oberkommando. Your success is... expected... from an Oberführer of an entire division of the Reich's finest. I assume I have made myself understood?"\n\nThe Belgian nodded his head furiously. "Absolutely, Sir, you may inform the Reichsführer, the culprit will be caught post haste and delivered unto Aryan justice."\n\n"Good, now let us see if you Kleindeutsche can make waffles better than the purebred Aryans in Norwegen. I had some lovely waffles there accompanying the Reichsführer during the War."\n\nEriksson remained glued to his seat in vague angst for several minutes after Himmler's representative finished his waffles and left."
 BRG_nuclear.20.a:0 "Let's hope he liked the waffles."

 BRG_nuclear.21.t:0 "Thieving Thieves"
 BRG_nuclear.21.d:0 "Oberführer Eriksson beamed as he pressed the button on the tape recorder to stop the playback of the coughing and sputtering confession of the resistance fighter, recorded at the end of a multi-hour interrogation session. Eriksson placed his hands behind his back and puffed his chest out. "They were all executed this morning, with Aryan speed and precision of justice! Normal construction work and operation in our factories can resume and our missing smallarms and gear have been returned."\n\nThe room erupted in applause from the assembled SS officers, the usual self-congratulatory nonsense Joachim Peiper loathed. He was the only one present not applauding, so after a pause to consider whether he should, he clapped his hands three times, slowly. The room went silent as everyone turned to him.\n\n"Impressively efficient indeed, Oberführer Eriksson, but you forgot something. These... bandits you were pursuing, they were also thieves, no? So where is what they stole? The Reichsführer will want to know."\n\nEriksson gave a sly grin. "I assure you, Langemarck is hot on the tail of the stolen... items. The Reichsführer will indeed know very well the location viability of any recovered fuel and computer parts once they have been safely brought to their rightful destination."\n\nSomething about Eriksson's statement and unusual bluster seriously unnerved Peiper, and while he smiled and nodded for the Oberführer to continue, he made a silent mental note to conduct his own little private investigation."
 BRG_nuclear.21.a:0 "Something is suspicious about this whole affair."

 BRG_nuclear.22.t:0 "Digging Holes"
 BRG_nuclear.22.d:0 "Brigadeführer Christian de la Mazière, head of SS Division Charlemagne, sneered at the construction workers, enjoying their cowering from his gaze. "Remind me again why our estimés camarades allemands desire to build these holes in the ground in our territory?"\n\nHis lieutenant, Charles Josephe, picked up on the hint and switched the conversation from German to French, gaining annoyed looks from the German engineer who had minutes earlier given up on chasing away the unannounced "guests" from the French legion. "They are silos, Sir. To house atomic-tipped missiles with intercontinental range. Truly the future."\n\n"The future indeed, Josephe. If these are to house the missiles of our friends in Paris, I assume there is a reason the Chef Domaine have not given us even the slightest of word of the missiles nor these wondrous atomic devices yet despite most of the holes being dug months ago?"\n\n"I had a talk with our contacts in Paris and Bruxelles about just that; I did wonder just the same, Sir. Turns out the Bâtard Flamand has been kicking up a fuss about just the same issue, he may be having a bit of a scuffle with the Chef Domaine."\n\n"Good, then I want our boys to have just as many concessions as the Bâtard, Eriksson is not going to be the Chef's little pet again. Make the arrangements." He turned to the engineer and switched back to German. "Please, Herr Engels, explain to me more about the design of this... silo. If you want the best for all parties involved.""
 BRG_nuclear.22.a:0 "Never leave out the French"

 BRG_nuclear.23.t:0 "Stirrings of the French SS"
 BRG_nuclear.23.d:0 "There have been some concerning and increasingly insistent calls from the headquarters of the French SS Legion, Division Charlemagne, recently. Echoing complaints from Division Langemarck, they demand immediate delivery of functioning missiles, equipment and personnel for maintaining them, and immediate security control of the silos we have been building in the regions under their control, citing potential imminent threats from the French State. The calls have made clear that Charlemagne and its divisional head, Brigadeführer de la Mazière will take it as a direct insult if they are not trusted with the handling of nuclear materials. While obviously it would be a minimal risk for us to entrust Charlemagne with this, given their great loyalty to our cause, giving concessions to them risks inflaming tensions with Langemarck. Still, given Charlemagne's considerable position of power within the SS, and to ensure the increasingly paranoid de la Mazière that we have no desire to challenge his position of authority, it seems clear we must do our best to appease them."
 BRG_nuclear.23.a:0 "Let's see if we can win them over."

 BRG_nuclear.24.t:0 "A Calmed Inferior"
 BRG_nuclear.24.d:0 "We appear to have amicably solved our missile issues with Charlemagne. Brigadeführer de la Mazière personally called the Reichsführer and several department heads this morning to congratulate them on a job well done. He has nothing but praise for our nuclear programme, and seems committed once more to the integrity of the Ordensstaat. With the collaboration of Charlemagne secured, we can move forward with full development of the nuclear missile systems in our western territories."
 BRG_nuclear.24.a:0 "The French are calm for once, delightful."

 BRG_nuclear.25.t:0 "A Unrightous Fury"
 BRG_nuclear.25.d:0 "Division Charlemagne, already being a hotbed of unrest and poor discipline after the controversies surrounding the Germanization of the new lands in the west, has been totally outraged over our failure to ensure their equal access to nuclear resources. Rumors and reports of mass mutinies and barracks brawl continue to filter in from Charlemagne-dominated regions, and we are able to effectively assert our authority there. A leaked audio recording from a beer hall event even seems to show de la Mazière openly criticizing members of the government for incompetence and distrust of the Waffen-SS, something practically nobody else in the Ordensstaat would ever dare do. We need to patch things up with them sooner or later."
 BRG_nuclear.25.a:0 "It could be worse."

 BRG_nuclear.26.t:0 "Charlemagne Silent"

 BRG_nuclear.27.t:0 "Dangerous Thoughts..."
 BRG_nuclear.27.d:0 "Deep in the bowels of a silo, Brigadeführer Christian de la Mazière smiled to himself as he let his fingers stroke over the launch panel. The control room was simplistic and grey, not very French at all, but like everyone else in his room his gaze was transfixed on the lead sarcophagus being slowly wheeled through the room. Mazière did not bother asking them to open it, they all knew death was in that coffin. It had not been easy to acquire this, but finally he had the greatest trick up his sleeve imaginable.\n\n"Soon," Mazière whispered to himself, "...soon.""
 BRG_nuclear.27.a:0 "... Can lead to deadly outcomes."

 BRG_nuclear.30.t:0 "The Dawn of a New Beginning"
 BRG_nuclear.30.d:0 "Line after line of scientists stood in silence and waited for the Reichsführer's word, the white coats most of them still wore a stark contrast with the black uniform of the SS men surrounding them. Gone was the triumphant attitude the roughly two hundred men and half a dozen women had felt only minutes before when they marched into the courtyard of the Alsatian castle Heinrich Himmler called his home, their leader proudly announcing the final verdict regarding the recent nuclear test as a resounding success when he presented his report. A creeping dread filled the crowd as the Reichsführer, instead of congratulating them, had merely signalled to some soldiers for a table, chair and pencil to be brought him. For the past quarter hour, he had been sitting quietly, flipping through pages, letting his fingers slide across photos of the mushroom cloud and damage to the test site, and chewing on his pencil, occasionally tapping it on a photo or underlining a word or phrase in the text.\n\nAfter another half hour of nervous staring from the assembled scientists, Himmler finished the last page and closed the folder, handing it and the pencil to a soldier who stepped up. Getting up to leave, the Reichsführer turned to the lead scientist. Himmler's face seemed disaffected, nearly bored, but those standing closest could see an ember of triumph in his eyes behind the reading glasses he had put on.\n\n"Good. Proceed with Phase Two."\n\n"Jawohl mein Reichsführer! Heil Himmler!"\n\nThe Reichsführer paid no heed to the lead researcher's statement, and showed no sign of hearing the collective "HEIL HIMMLER!" of the assembled crowd which followed their leader's salute. Even so, arms remained outstretched for almost a full minute after the doors to the inner castle shut with a clank in front of them."

 BRG_education_waiting_for_text_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat is the only place where the Aryan race is protected. Its bloodlines kept rigorously pure. The Aryan may be born pure, but that does not mean they remain so. Just as the Untermensch must be taught that they are wretched, so the Aryan must be taught that they are pure. We must ensure that the future generations of the high and low races are made greater in rule and in service, in glory and in humility, in strength and in silence, than the degenerate legacy of our forebears have left them.\n\nThe SS Schulungs-und-Kulturamt has long been only nominally within our purview, full of independently minded servants of National Socialism doing essential yet often ignored work. Now we are making right this discrepancy. Ignorance is an enemy as ill-bred and repugnant as any Bolshevik menace, and slaying this beast, or worse, the beast of false-truth, is a fight worthy of a true Aryan.\n\nThe mind is a battleground between what the weak proclaim 'true' and what the strong know is correct. We must give our teachers every weapon we can to win this fight, for this a battle for the soul of the Ordensstaat, and Aryans never lose."
 BRG_new_history_desc:0 "The present chronicles of history as understood by the French are deeply flawed. They are the product of centuries of propaganda and revision of real history-lies, meant to serve the interests of French nationalism and to demonize the Reich and deify the corrupt 'virtues' presupposed upon the French people. Generations of lies have deluded the French of their true racial heritage, their true spiritual identity, and their true purpose as a people.\n\nOur task, succinctly, is to set the record straight. We will educate the children of the French countryside and reeducate their parents to the truth of not only their own history, but also the true state of the world. History, science, arts and culture: they are deluded to the reality of them all, and it falls to us to shine the light upon their eyes, whether they would like to be shown it or not. Their misunderstandings will be rectified, and the most malleable of them shall be reshaped into good Burgundian citizens, loyal servants of the state and children of the Vaterland. The rest will have less desirable fates."
 BRG_new_program_desc:0 "It's time for a reanalysis of the purpose of the education system. Children's schools do not exist purely to train the next generation of laborers, and universities do not exist to create a class of intelligentsia to become depraved and socially corrupt the other classes. All sources of information in the Ordensstaat ought to serve the purpose of shaping the minds of those worthy of being educated to conform to the minds of a good Aryan, one who is loyal to his people and his Reich.\n\nAs a counterpart to this, the more impure amongst us should still be educated. They should be taught about loyalty; taught about diligence; taught about the importance of allegiance to the Vaterland and the essential execution of good service to their rightful masters. A well-educated worker is best defined as one who fulfills his quotas and does not question the decrees of the Schutzstaffel."
 BRG_erase_degeneracy_desc:0 "An accident of history, the Belgians have not existed long enough or enjoyed a great enough homogeneity to cultivate a true national ethos of their own. Instead, the French speaking and Flemish speaking peoples of former Belgium have their own conceptions of the world, similar to those of their linguistic neighbours. Is it the former of these, the Wallonians, for whom similar efforts must be made as against the former nationals of France. The same perversions endemic to the French also infect to varying degrees the French speakers of Belgium, and the descendants of the Belgae shall not be immune from our efforts to purify the minds of the Ordensstaat's more destitute peoples and turn them into proper Burgundians."
 BRG_cleanse_mistakes_desc:0 "Scientific accomplishments of the French people are a category of scientific advancements best understood as a sideshow compared to the genius innovations made by Aryan scientists. Since the unification of the Reich generations ago, our people have led the world in the advancements of technology, philosophy, and all facets of human knowledge. It is not just misunderstandings of the course of history that need to be amended in the minds of the French, but also all of the other aspects of human knowledge in which our people have excelled-which is to say, all of them. It is time for the new citizens of Burgundy to forget all they knew of the likes of Voltaire and learn of the wisdom of Baeumler and Heidegger."
 BRG_burgundian_irredentism_desc:0 "Far from a modern invention, the idea of a 'Burgundy' actually predates the existence of the French Kingdom, and has been a feature upon the face of Europe more often since the 6th century that it has not been. This state's rightful domain - our state's rightful domain - extends from the Rhine to the Channel, and from the North Sea to the Alps. For many years now, this region, though geographically cohesive, has been divided between a plurality of countries and peoples, some superior to others. It is our moral duty as the most superior of all of these arbitrarily disparate identities to collect together and racially purify the inhabitants of the region; to make Burgundy the best, most pure and distilled, and most strong version of itself as it has ever been. The people must know that we are the herders of the sheep, and shall lead those of the whitest wool to the greenest grass they have ever feasted upon."
 BRG_deal_with_the_legions_desc:0 "The threat of overmighty servants is a plague that has heretofore befallen all great nations, and though the Legions and their generals are surely loyal in their fealty to National Socialism and to the Reichsführer-SS, their size presents challenges to ensuring that this will always be the case. The Charlemagne Legion in particular is perhaps too proud of their French ancestry. They must be made to always remember that they are each and every one of them Burgundians, not Frenchmen. Perhaps thinning their numbers of the least truehearted of them might encourage the rest to be more forthright in their devotion to the Aryan race."
 BRG_search_for_professors_desc:0 "Essential to the rendering of the French and other indigenous peoples into a great Burgundian mass is the incorporation of the prominent figures among them who have earned the trust of the Reichsführer-SS into positions of prestige. The people must see themselves in the party. They must look on the faces of those they knew to be French who now proudly call themselves Burgundian, and they must admire and wish to emulate all those faces that they see. This shall be doubly true in the realm of academia - it will be difficult for a French student in Paris to deny that his people are best served as denizens of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund when all of his trusted professors heart-warmingly proclaim as such. The next generation of thinkers on the Seine will ponder on how and why their ancestors ever became so deluded and so removed from truth as to call themselves French."
 BRG_burn_the_old_books_desc:0 "There's something beautiful about the simplicity of a good old fashioned book burning. The authors of the world in which we now inhabit are too often a part of the destitute vermin that ought not to propagate their filth onto the eyes of good-blooded men and women of the Ordensstaat. Their works are artefacts of old, disproved ideas, and conquered, defeated nations and ideologies. Succinctly, the words written on their pages do not deserve to ever be read. They have earned for themselves only the flame. All that remains is to decide precisely which books, by precisely which proscribed writers, ought to be made non-existent. It will be better for us to purge the public libraries and private studies of our new conquests with the widest scope we can afford; moderation in the face of corruption is no virtue."
 BRG_jean_mabire_in_every_school_desc:0 "Among the most loyal to our project from amongst those of French stock is the writer Jean Mabire, an artful and verdant defender of the right of the Aryan race to proclaim its dominion over the fields of Europe. His admiration of the SS in particular, set apart from and above the forces of the Reich, has earned him the favour of the Reichsführer-SS ever since his defection from the Vichy regime to the Ordensstaat upon our state's founding. If every former Frenchman from Calais to the Haut-Jura had the mind of Mabire, the project of reeducating the people would be complete.\n\nIt would only make sense to allow this exemplar to aid in the conscription of his compatriots to the good cause we fight for, that they might come to share his enthusiasm for we who "carry Sigurd's sword and the Prometheus torch". The French have always loved their authors - a renowned French author eloquently extolling the virtues of our regime could not possibly achieve anything less than the successful incorporation of the French people into our system. Let every pupil in every school read and remember the wise words of Mabire."
 BRG_authenitiziat_desc:0 "To become something more than a splinter state of the Reich, the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund must be faithful to itself and to what it holds dear. The state and its people must be as one in their defiance not only against the persistent influences of Bolshevik and American plutocratic ideas, but also to the idea that we are merely an extension of our eastern neighbour. The foreign ideologies of all those who exist beyond our bounds are a cancer to the heart and lungs of the Burgundian personhood, infesting our insides and weakening us from where we are least equipped to fight back. The only way to prevent these spiritual tumors from overwhelming us is to excise them, without pause or mercy. We are not French, we are Burgundian - to say otherwise is anathema and to be forbidden. We do not belong to the Reich, we belong to the Reichsführer-SS - to say otherwise is anathema and to be forbidden. Every man, woman, and child within the boundaries of our state must be entirely loyal to our state alone and to the humanity saving ideology of National Socialism to which it adheres. To be Burgundian is to be Burgundian alone: authentically. If you cannot devote yourself wholly to the cause, you will condemn yourself wholly to the grave."
 BRG_our_germanic_hertiage_desc:0 "The empire of the Franks that grew from what is now the Ordensstaat conquered itself west and east and became the predecessor of two brother nations: Germany, and France. These two countries' sibling rivalry would be the primary feature of the history and politics of Western Europe for over a millenia. Through the many wars fought between these brothers, they cultivated a sense of themselves as something necessarily opposed to one another; they became defined by their mutual opposition, and mutual hatred, to each other. The day the SS raised their flag over the realm of Burgundy, the birthplace of the brother nations of Western Europe, was the beginning of the final days of this petty rivalry. The Führer's victory over the West Franks might have been a lasting one, which answered forever the winner of the brothers' quarrel, but now the time has come for the animosity to be set aside, and for victor and defeated alike to recognize their common Germanic heritage. The descent of the French from the same conquerors that spawned the ancestral precursor states of the Reich belies the ability of the French to be incorporated into our new Reich, if we should but will it to be so."
 BRG_french_are_not_german_desc:0 "Regardless, we do not desire it. The prospect of the assimilation of such a massive quantity of bodies into a new nationhood, one which they identify themselves by their opposition to, is a prospect too daunting to warrant. We are a powerful state with armies and weapons that frighten to cowardice all enemies who would dare to stand against us, but we are not workers of miracles. Our resources are better spent on maintaining our strength and security and on improving our access to important food and oil products-not on grandiose designs of convincing every French peasant not to call himself a Frenchman anymore. It is loyalty and effective, diligent labour that we expect from our people. It does not make any difference that some of the workers might speak in their indigenous tongues, so long as the words they utter are not ones of sedition."
 BRG_our_brothers_the_french_desc:0 "And so it shall be. Once we accept the fact that we are long lost brothers, it is beyond sanity to accept anything less than our full reunification. The same Burgundy whose wide plains once created the French and the Germans shall now see them become one and the same again. The ancestors of those Burgundians of old, the Charlemagnes of the history books, will look upon us from the heaven of warriors and smile that all their children shall now labour together for common cause. National Socialism in service of the Burgundian nation, not the German or French ones, is the policy of our state. The Ordensstaat serves only its own people and the goals that benefit itself, and the designs of its great leader. We are not sons of the Reich: the Reich is a son of ours."
 BRG_our_lineage_secured_desc:0 "We have toiled many hours and expended many of our resources in men, materiel, and time to ensure that the future lineage of the Ordensstaat is safe and secured. At long last, our toils have come to an end. The people are being taught the truth of the world they observe around them and what happens beyond it, and the natives of the lands we have rightfully conquered have shown some evidence of coming around to the right point of view. Concrete improvements are not of importance here, so it is of little worry that we do not observe many. What is important in truth is that our lineage, the most crucial of all things, is secured for generations to come. As generations pass we can only grow purer and stronger, and as the years go on, every soul across the Ordensstaat will eventually be saved and brought around to National Socialism and to the supremacy of the Aryan race.\n\nWe have purified our bloodline. We've won."
 BRG_a_second_attempt_desc:0 "Any pretense of gently nudging the people of what was once France into subservience to our will must be removed from our efforts. They have proven themselves a waste of time. There are no more half-measures or suggestions to be made: only concrete actions and iron-clad commands. If the French will not speak German because a book told them that they should, then we shall replace the books with guns. Strict quotas for Germanization will be delivered to school precincts across the state, and penalties issued not only to non-complying settlements, but also to the enforcers that fail to produce results within them. French shall be less spoken and the nation of France less revered step by step every year until both numbers eventually reach zero. Whenever the mandated quantity of self-identifying French nationals and French speakers fails to reach the required benchmark, it shall no longer be the job of educators to make the numbers match the targets, but instead the job of the Einsatzgruppen. Addition through subtraction is their specialty."
 BRG_atompshere_of_degeneracy_desc:0 "We had thought that we could adapt the French education system and alter their curriculums to turn their pupils into the loyal Burgundians of tomorrow. Little did we know how far deep down the rot of degeneracy reaches in these institutions, lest the mistakes would never have been made. To rectify the issue, the education system will not be overhauled: it will be replaced. Community schools on street corners in major cities and towns will be shut down, their facilities used for compulsory weekly reeducation of French speaking adults. Weekend classes in German will replace forays to the cafe in the calendars of the French working class.\n\nFor the young ones, an expansive system of mandatory boarding schools will likely prove much more effective in moulding their young minds into loyal future citizens than the old. Only the most fanatically loyal of the French school teachers will be allowed to participate in the education process in these boarding schools, and the gaps left by them will be filled by military instructors. Harsh corporal punishment will be the penalty for any pupil caught speaking French in these boarding facilities, and correspondence from parents and other relatives will be screened to ensure that is both written in the German language and reflects moral fortitude and loyalty to the Schutzstaffel. The next generation WILL be purer than the last. We will make sure of it."
 BRG_a_culture_of_weakness_desc:0 "Tearing up the entire system root and stem is senselessly destructive and does not produce the ends that we design. Instead, we should change the system to the maximum possible extent at which it will still function, and engineer it to induce the Germanization of its students, above all other goals. The reasoning for this is quite simple-education's function is not in making the people more intelligent. The function of the system is in making the people conform.\n\nWe could produce the change we are looking for by directly removing the people we no longer want, but there is waste inherent in that. Every person walking in Burgundy who is racially and biologically fit to one day become a German should be treated as a future German: a lost German, as it were, one who needs to be reformed into the best possible version of himself. Naturally, this process will not only apply to the youth. Social advancement and the best paying and most skilled positions in all fields will be limited to those with proficient knowledge of the German language, and free classes in this most perfect of surviving languages will be offered to any upwardly mobile Frenchman who wishes for it. Those that don't wish for it will be under close observation until they do."
 BRG_our_ideals_are_forever_desc:0 "Plants and animals alike do not grow to their strongest and largest under supposedly optimal conditions. Too easy an access of water and food at too little effort to the organism reduces its ability to resist disease and predators. The strongest men are forged in the hottest fires, and a cold snap does not truly weaken a crop, only removing the weakest of its number and leaving the best progeny to continue on to the next generation. These facts have been known to ancient peoples for thousands of years, as practiced by the Spartans of ancient Hellas who left their sickly babes to die, and to the Aryan inventors of agriculture in the once temperate northern fringes of Scandinavia, who prayed to their gods for the cold to come and kill the weakest of the seeds in their plots. The knowledge of past generations has been lost to the liberal west, and its tendrils even sneak into the unguarded openings of the Reich itself-but the Ordensstaat will forever remain pure."
 BRG_no_more_second_chances_desc:0 "Some disloyal scoundrels who have festered in the SS as parasites inside a host have insisted that the Germanization rates we mandated onto them as governors of the towns and cities were unreasonable and unrealistic. Many indigenous French community leaders agreed, and petitioned their local authorities to allow the persistence of the French language by those who professed loyalty to the SS. None of those people who protested their orders or petitioned for leniency continue to do so today, and neither shall those who resist our efforts at Germanization continue to do so for very long.\n\nPossession of nationalist French paraphernalia shall be considered an act of treason. Public display of French signage shall be considered an act of treason. Failure to meet basic German language literacy shall also be considered an act of treason. KZ-lager shall be the only places left where French shall be heard spoken."
 BRG_destroy_it_all_desc:0 "If a stricter treatment exists, then that treatment should always be the one applied. Our destruction of resistors to Germanization has so far been too ad hoc. We have identified them as they emerged and proceed to punish them and their abettors. This process fails because it relies on the occurrence of treason in order for us to punish it. This is illogical. The better solution is to be proactive.\n\nIt isn't enough for restaurants displaying French signage to replace their signs with German ones. The restaurant should be burned down, and its owner executed. It isn't enough for an employer secretly allowing his workers to speak French at the workplace to be terminated. He must be terminated after witnessing the termination of the employees whose treason he assisted in. We are not brutish savages; we do not kill for the pleasure of ending a life, or to induce pain in those whose lives we end. We kill because some people do not deserve to live, and the widest possible definition of 'some people' results in the greatest possible state."
 BRG_salt_the_earth_desc:0 "Even as our efforts are always continuing, this heightened period of our campaign against the French language in the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is at an end. As the last act of our plan (besides the continuing Germanization quotas), it is time for a symbolic measure of the accomplishment of our program to be conducted. The Louvre, that famous work of architectural art that houses within it a collection of other French art pieces, shall be demolished. Once the rubble is cleared, a replacement will be built, to house those of the pieces inside that conform to our artistic standards. The new Louvre shall be built in the same neo-classical architectural style as is the capital of the Vaterland, in Germania. Similar destructions and reconstructions will be enacted all across the Ordensstaat, to finalize the completion of the cultural conversion of the country. Notre-Dame, too, shall be converted from a cathedral into a museum of ancient European religion, its Christian iconography removed and replaced with images of German warriors of myth. Only a small number of sites of particular importance to German history, such as the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, will be kept unchanged. France's cultural history will be torn down and made new in the image we deem most fit. The reactions of the people will serve to test the truth of their loyalty."
 BRG_keep_them_in_our_grasp_desc:0 "It is acceptable for this generation of unskilled labourers in the Ordensstaat to continue to speak indigenous languages. However, incumbent upon the speaking of those languages is the necessity of participating in additional political programming-in the French language-to ensure that the Francophones of our state do not speak French out of disloyalty. More important than imminent Germanization is the continued stability of our state, after all. It would be insane to prioritize rapid Germanization over long-term stability. It is a choice in which either option benefits us. The people shall either become German, or shall become more politically inclined to our program. A win-win for the SS."
 BRG_get_inside_their_heads_desc:0 "Instead of being banned, French language radio broadcasts and popular culture will be used to extensively propagandize the Schutzstaffel, and to endear the French people to their new overlords. Where capitalist states would advertise their consumer goods between broadcasts, we will advertise National Socialism, and extol the virtues of our system and its multitude of accomplishments to the listening Francophone public. Everything they will see or hear in French will exist to advance the causes of the Reichsführer-SS. The same tongue that their ancestors fought and died in their number to ensure would always be spoken will be used against them to convince them of the truth they know in their hearts but have not yet accepted: that they are not so far removed from the people who they once reviled as their enemy, and that the system pioneered in the Reich and now practiced in the Ordensstaat is the best system to suit the needs of the French people."
 BRG_make_an_example_desc:0 "A program of exemplars shall be established, to give the Frenchmen living within the Ordensstaat a new system of local leaders to look up to and heroes to idolize. Those French-speaking workers among their community who are most productive will have their faces and accomplishments displayed on posters for all to see, and their families will receive preferential housing equal to German speakers, as well as social privileges and higher skilled employment to fit. Furthermore, the people of Paris will be made to forget the reigns of the Sun King and Napoleon, and remember instead the achievements of Charles Martel and Charlemagne-their oldest and greatest ancestors, the ones who truly founded France, and were closest to what the country was intended to be. New archeological excavations of the burial sites of these great men have revealed previously unknown secrets about their lifestyles. They lived simply, eating only what they needed to stay strong, and were exceptionally physically fit, and German-looking in their skeletal structure. Truly, heroes for all of us to aspire to become."

 BRG_education.1.t:0 "A Lovely Dessert"
 BRG_education.1.d:0 "Dr. Cäsar blinked furiously, his eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden bright bluish sheen of electrical lights somewhere over his head. He had hoped he would see more clearly once the sack was removed from his head, but the room remained blurry; to his annoyance he realized his glasses must have fallen off when the SD officers fetched him from his townhouse in Paris, dressed in little but slippers and a bathrobe. Still, even if the seven hour drive had not been hint enough, what he could make out of the room in which he found himself made it clear he most likely was no longer in the Haupstad... Grey walls, most likely concrete, and a vaulted ceiling with straight, angular corners. Cäsar had experienced his share of air raids during the last Weltkrieg; even a glorified school administrator like himself could recognize a fortified bunker room. Could this be one of the Alpenfestung he had heard discussed in the rare meeting of the SS leadership they bothered inviting him to? Even before the War, the Reichsführer had been stripping him of authority, and these days... A sudden sound of metal on porcelain startled him, and Cäsar whirled around to locate the source of the sound behind him. He almost slipped on something, his slippers failing to grip the surface, but Cäsar instantly lost all interest in the cause when he recognized the blurry outline of a man in black uniform eating a dish. A vague smell of apple settled the matter. Only one person would dare indulge in such a luxury as an apfelstrudel in front of someone of Dr. Cäsar's rank. His arm was extending before he even finished turning, his aging lungs making the loudest "HEIL HIMMLER!" they could manage. The Reichsführer SS put down his spoon and began talking softly, the rounded edges of an Upper Bavarian accent and reassuring tone hiding a barely constrained anger only somebody who had known him for as long as Cäsar could recognize. He spoke of the New Territories, of how the men of Charlemagne were undermining the civilizing mission of the Ordensstaat. Of how educational reform had failed, of how the head of Untermensch education had just admitted to failing to address these issues, betraying both Dr. Cäsar and the Ordensstaat. He spoke of Cäsars three decades of loyal service and his absolute trust in him to put things right. For twenty minutes he spoke, his fidgeting underling fixated like a prey upon a snake, trying to ignore the fluid seeping through his slippers. When the Reichsführer got up to leave, Cäsar finally allowed himself a glance down. The puddle he was standing in was indeed red, peppered with white skull fragments. A parting line from the Reichsführer snapped his attention back up."

 BRG_education.2.t:0 "Neu-Burgund"
 BRG_education.2.d:0 "Dr. Cäsar observed with relief the installation of the sign announcing the reopening of der Erinnerungshalle SS, the former Palais Garnier in Paris. It was the last major monument to be renamed in the newly occupied Parisian sector. When the SS-WVHA announced that they would begin renaming streets and monuments in commemoration of the Western Security Expansion and the liberation of the peoples there from the corrupt French regime, Cäsar had been more worried than he had ever been since his meeting with the Reichsführer. While in and of itself renaming streets, towns and monuments was nothing new in the Ordensstaat, this was the first time it was done to this extent in such a short time. In just a few weeks, thousands of names had been changed in hundreds of towns all across the new territories and even in some parts of the old that had been left alone thus far, earning the barely concealed ire of millions of Frenchmen. And whose name was front and center in the propaganda surrounding the renamings, who was brought out to hold speeches at all the major renamings? Certainly not the head of the WVHA; he had buggered off the Renaming Committee the second he realized how unpopular this was going to be with both the lower classes and the Charlemagne Division. That left Dr. Cäsar, head of the SS Office for Education and Culture, the SuKA, as the highest ranked member on the committee. The SuKA was already unpopular enough because of its announcement of new educational reforms to promote Germanic culture in the new regions of the Ordensstaat, and with the "disappearance" of the secretary for Untermensch education, Cäsar had nobody to take the blame off him until the Hauptamt appointed somebody new.\n\nOnce he finished a short speech and shaking hands with the mayor of Großraum Paris, the head of education hurriedly walked to his staff car, trying not to scan the uniforms of the SS guards too closely for Charlemagne badges. However, even as he drove away, he could not shake his worry; he passed by the carefully arranged rows of cheering German settlers celebrating the renaming, and saw the mainstay of the crowd. Herded out on the streets by the SS to ensure that in official photos it looked like the cheering crowds numbered in the thousands, the local Parisians had the usual look of disappointment and worry. However, unlike in the north, in these crowds Cäsar could still spot the odd face twisted by rage and hatred, looking at his car with balled fists."

 BRG_education.3.t:0 "Grammar Nazism"
 BRG_education.3.d:0 "The German lesson was an unusually dull one for Peter, or Pierre as his parents called him at home. The complexity of the German cases and the intricacies of wrapping his tongue around the harsh consonants of The True Language was making Peter's head hurt, but the 11-year-old knew better than to doze off from his lessons. The usual SS Schulungsoffizier, a jovial, fat man who lived over the butcher in town, had the last few weeks been replaced with a young, fish-looking fellow with a wispy blonde mustache and the eyes of a hungry wolf. The boy's eyes dwelt on the man, just a moment, trying to determine what exactly about the wide mouth and flat nose made the young man so resemble a fish. Had it been the old Schulungsoffizier, he might have allowed himself a slight chuckle, but this new one did not fall asleep or read a book like his predecessor. Peter had lived long enough to know the men in the black clothes and leather boots were at their most dangerous when alert and attentive like this one. The man suddenly yelled out in German, and Peter nearly jumped out of his chair, but the German's anger, sudden and then gone like a sugar ration on a Sunday, was directed at his teacher. The officer seized the big ruler by the blackboard and held up the whimpering teacher's cheek with it, and began softly yet angrily speaking in a dialect of German Peter struggled to follow.\n\n"Name? Dein Name, Frankenscheisser!"\n\n"Guill- Wilhelm, Herr Schulungsoffizier! Wilhelm Oberstedt, aus Verd- uh, Virten!"\n\nThe conversation carried on for several tense moments, but as far as Peter understood, the issue revolved around whether the grammar the teacher was teaching was still right. When the officer seemed pleased, he removed the ruler from the teacher's cheek and turned to the 60 children in front of him.\n\n"Versteht ihr, Kinder? Hochdeutsch spricht das Herrenvolk, und ihr seid nichts dagegen! Ihr werdet die Grammatik erlernen, die euch Maden gebürt!"\n\nPeter didn't know what he said, but every child in Burgundy knew the correct response to his expectant tone."

 BRG_education.4.t:0 "The Wurstfest"
 BRG_education.4.d:0 "On paper the Wurstfest was a good idea. Many Frenchmen in the newly occupied regions stuck to their traditional form of cooking despite their limited access to ingredients from the rations. Too many times had the garrison soldiers of the newly rechristen Sankt Franz walked through the small town smelling the distinctly un-German smells of brioche or baguette. So, why not introduce them to the world-famous German kitchen, Standartenführer Karl Warheim had figured, German food was after all universally recognized as the best in the world? Karl was not entirely sure how his plan had ended him here, in a labor camp alongside thousands of Untermensch who would probably have killed him in his sleep, if he had not successfully passed for Dutch due to his Wilhelmshaven accent. He stared into his bowl of gruel and tried to pinpoint the time where things had gone wrong.\n\nWhen his initial efforts had failed due to being unable to find the required amount of meat, Karl had written to Nanzig, to the head of the Schulungsamt himself to ask if he could get support for his cultural festival. Was that where he had gone wrong? It couldn't be; he had gotten approval for requesting the meat from the WVHA regional office. Was it how he had chosen not to report the sudden disappearance of local livestock before the festival? No, everybody knew that surprise confiscations was how meat was usually obtained following the cessation of food shipments from the Reich. That left the only other mistake he could think of; failing to keep the Wurstfest a local secret. On the day of the festival, endless lines of people showed up to beg the confused youths Karl had put behind the counters, for meat, for beer, even for sauerkraut. Karl couldn't say when the fight had first started, the line was so long it almost reached the next village over. Damned Untermensch, he should never have trusted them to appreciate German food! When the OrStaPo vans showed up half an hour later and unleashed their cargo, it was with their usual rapid efficiency. Karl had been arrested the next morning while trying to organize some locals to help the garrison hose off the streets. Damned Untermensch!\n\nThe sound of a baton on a bell signalled to Karl that dinner was over. He quickly shoveled the last spoonfuls of gruel into his mouth before getting back into line."

A man (Departmental note: Approximately 180 centimeters of height, medium build, dark brown hair) in SS uniform was found defacing a street sign demarcating the start of the Rudolf Höss-Strasse, recently put up as part of the KVP efforts in the Liberated Zones. A patrol under Hauptsturmführer Hansen observed the event and attempted to intervene. It is believed the suspect was writing "Rue de la Republique" (Departmental Note: The former name of the Rudolf Höss-Strasse), but found himself unable to complete said criminal action due to the loyal unit of Hauptsturmführer Hansen. The loyal unit attempted to apprehend the suspected traitor, but found themselves unable to complete this arrest due to the intervention of a different unit of Waffen-SS, without visible insignia in the darkness. The unit rushed the suspect into a vehicle (Departmental Note: Believed to have been a medium truck of brand "Opel") and drove off in a southwesterly direction. Members of Hansen's patrol believe they heard the members of the unknown unit speak French to the suspect before his evacuation.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTION: Contact RHSA Offices II, IV, V for possible espionage actions by the French State or surviving French elements in Africa. Contact OKR and HA Germanic Control Office to suggest immediate review of elements of the divisions Charlemagne and Walloonien stationed in Nord-Paris for potential sheltering of insubordinate individuals.

 BRG_education.10.d:0 "If we are going to cleanse the French of the Latin stain of Old Gallia, we must help them see the true, proud past of the Franks, the old Germanic conquerors who would eventually degenerate into the current Frenchmen. It's long past due to bury historical relics like Posthumus and Syagrius and focus on teaching the Untermensch of the conquering glory of Chlodwig and Karl Martell. However, opinions are divided on how to present the totality of French history.\n\nThe most recent centuries will of course only be quickly skipped through, since France was a slave of the Great Enemy in that time. While the mainstream view of the Office of Education is that we should disregard the times before Karl der Grosse and showcase French history as a matter of slow decline of order and greatness because of the monarchs gradually intermarrying with the Latins and mongrelizing their blood until they became weak enough to be toppled by the Judeo-Jacobins in 1789.\n\nThe Office of the Ahnenerbe disagrees. Over the course of their research into the lost history of the Aryans, they believe to have discovered documents purporting the Jews engineered the splitting of the realm of Karl der Grosse, bringing low the ancestors of the First Reich. This would certainly explain why the French failed to purge their Jews during the Crusades like their German counterparts. The Ahnenerbe thus suggests that French history after the West Frankish lords turned their back on the German language and culture in the 9th century should be quickly skipped through as an age of darkness prior to the light brought to the land by their long lost German cousins in the forties. To make up for the loss in approved curriculum, they instead suggest classes on the true Old Gaul of the Celts, mighty warriors believed to be of partial Aryan heritage, before the Romans polluted their blood.\n\nWhat shall be our decision on the matter of the curriculum?"

In return for taking these books off the list, they offer their skills in digging through archives and libraries to help us locate as many books on the French language, poetry, linguistics, and literary classics as possible. Burning all those would send a powerful message about the strength of conviction of the Kulturverbesserungsprojekt and the death of the effete French culture of old in favor of the new Burgundian identity, but... is it really worth the cost of preserving potentially highly corrupted historical material that could mislead the researchers of the Ahnenerbe and expose young students to Jewish propaganda?"

We have no excuse for reeducating them, even if the SD and RHSA Office VII are convinced of ballooning disloyalty in the Walloon Legion. Two strategies have been formulated for dealing with the disloyal elements. The OKW wants to send them on a permanent anti-partisan campaign across the Ordensstaat with minimal resupply and reinforcement. That should thin out their ranks pretty heavily in just a few months, leaving the survivors unable to organize any sort of effective resistance to our control and giving us an excuse to promote freshly educated and loyal officers. The RHSA however views this as too slow and a waste of manpower and potential to root out disloyal networks. They instead propose fabricating charges against a selection of senior personnel, and after their mock trials and definitely-not-mock executions we will have all the excuse we need to conduct a full review of the Walloon Legion, arresting those who need arresting and sending the rest to reeducation and ideological compliance checks.

They had heard Dr. Cäsar, their de jure superior with his position as head of the Office of Education and Culture, would be dropping by to discuss their proposed changes to the KVP's history curriculum reforms, but they had not expected Heinrich Himmler, of all people, to tag along from the emergency meeting which had brought him to Paris. The good doctor himself sat silent and seemingly terrified in the corner, but the Reichsführer did not notice, smiling from ear to ear and flipping through one of the Ahnenerbe's textbooks.\n\n"Remarkable, remarkable! It is so good to put aside the time to speak with men of true skill and vision in the intellectual sphere once more. It has been too many years. I have spent many a moment between meetings recently reflecting on the shared Aryan history we had with the Franks before they became so... French. Brilliant work, this book, even gives some glimpses of the era after the French destroyed France. But... Did I just see passage stating Nostradamus might have been an agent of the Jews?"\n\nThe room fell deadly silent, everyone present replaying the last sentence in their minds and trying to gauge whether the Reichsführer approved or not. Eventually Dr. Cäsar cleared his throat.\n\n"That is the reigning scientific opinion, mein Führer..." He noticed the smile fading from Himmler's eyes. "...but you are in luck, this particular question has been of historical interest for some time, and so Dr. Herbert has recently commissioned a study on just this subject, haven't you Carl?"\n\nDr. Carl Herbert's eyes shot daggers at Cäsar, but he smiled at the Reichsführer and nodded.\n\n"Indeed I have, I very recently approved a student's postgraduate thesis proposal on the question of Nostradamus."\n\nHimmler leaned back in his chair smiling again, and the room drew a quiet sigh of relief."

He was proud of what he had achieved in recent months, he felt like he truly had sown the seeds of a genuine Burgundian culture, and the feeling made his aging joints feel softer again. Behind his eyes he was sure the bystanders could see the flame of passion for the cause of the SS that had once carried him to the top of the hierarchy of the SS in those distant thirties. These children had never seen those years. None of them had any memory of a time without the Scuthzstaffel to protect and guide their inferiors and help all humanity achieve new heights. They had little concept of "France" or "Resistance," much less the games of power played at the lofty heights of power in Paris, through which Cäsar was forced to wade on the daily. In a way he envied their innocence and their total acceptance of the world as is. These children were the Franks of old reborn, a mix of Aryans Germans and Little Aryan Celts who had once made the Roman might tremble before them.

After an evening of feasting on beer, wurst and sauerkraut on the Himmlerplatz, the collaborators of Reimen went home, full of food for the first time in months and with a slight buzz of alcohol for the first time in even longer. All across France similar stories played out again and again. Manceller, Merowechskrone, Stefanstadt... Cities, streets, places were all transforming into indelible reminders of the regime to thunderous applause. Yet nobody shouted or rioted, very few dared even protest silently by averting their eyes. Watchful men in black patrolled along the sidewalks, atop the buildings surrounding the plazas, along the paths in the parks. There would be no chaos, no insurrection. As the sun set on the dark heart of the Black Spot of Europe, there were few reminders this place was once known as the City of Lights, an oppressive darkness ensured by the rationing of electricity and the poor quality of bulbs in the streetlights. Yet the buildings of government still blazed with light, the last vestiges of the city of old yet at the same time the heralds of its funeral. For the celebrations in the government buildings that night were those of the men that had killed Old France. Only a handful of locations were the officials of government not enraptured by their rations of beer and the blazing of film projectors showing the final wave of German renamings. One such place was a minimally decorated conference room, in which a committee quietly voted to scrap a renaming proposal for Paris for fear of that being one humiliation too much for even the Untermensch to bear. And in a different building, in an even more Spartan office, a pale, aging man finished his paperwork, eager to leave Paris and return to his home in Elsass.

His glasses had sunk to the tip of his nose, but he kept scrawling intensely in his notebook. Occasionally, he picked up a paper from his simple wooden desk and looked at it in dismay. Those fools who called themselves men of the Schutzstaffel had made a mess of his plans for converting the French, indulging in all sorts of luxuries and weakness to try to convince the French of the nobility of the German people. Sauerkraut? Wurst? Beer? This was not the spirit the SS wanted to build for the Ordensstaat! Aside from coddling the Untermensch, the Aryans would have to learn to live without such luxuries during what is to come. Flipping back through the papers to find the directive to ban the production, sale and distribution of wines, he noted on it to also cut the beer ration in half for members of the SS and limit sales to Untermensch to written permission only. His eyes caught the telephone on his desk. Dr. Cäsar had been a useful tool in the execution of the reeducation of the French, even if the results had been less than optimal so far.

The hardliners in the cabinet argue all remaining titles of nobility should be abolished throughout the Ordensstaat to show the Untermensch that they are all equally unworthy and that the only true nobility is the Black Knights of the SS. The moderates instead argue that we should mimic the old Teutonic Ordensstaat and replace all noble titles with Germanic ones granted by and revocable by the Reichsführer. This means we can reward collaborators and punish the less enthusiastic using little more than empty words. What is our final decision?"

 BRG_education.25.d:0 "Jorne Desramaults had not always lived like this. Before World War II, he had lived a fairly comfortable life as part of the Belgian nobility. Attending parties, mingling with the powerful, and enjoying the finer things in life. He wasn't one of the famous nobles, but one with lineage nonetheless. He had comfort, wealth, and prestige.\n\nAll of which had saved his life when the Germans had come. He'd kept his life and title - but at a cost. His sons had to be enrolled into SS schools, and he might not even see them again. It was an impossible choice - his sons or the survival of him and his wife. In the end he had agreed, wondering what it would be like if they met again.\n\nThings hadn't really worsened until the Ordensstaat had been created, and Himmler had turned everything into a nightmare. Now they were still alive - but he didn't know for how long. They held their title, but it was ultimately worthless. Despite that, there had been something that had given him life - his sons had come home.\n\nIt had initially been a happy meeting - they had smiled, hugged, and welcomed them inside. His wife had quickly put dinner together - and they'd started talking. It was soon after the meal had started where he realized to his horror how thoroughly indoctrinated his sons were into Himmler's cult.\n\nThey talked about how great a leader Himmler was, and how National Socialism was the only acceptable system. They chatted about Aryan superiority, and joked about "Jewish and French degenerates." If he had been thinking, he might have made sure to play along. But these were his sons, his own flesh in blood he should be close to - but they were as strangers to him. As the evening went on, he might have noticed them eyeing him with suspicion, but all he was consumed by was horror at what they had become - and sorrow at what he had lost."

A dozen SS officers were now at his house, and had informed him his title had been stripped, and he and his wife were to be "relocated." He'd initially reacted in outrage - and then fear as the officers had forced their way in.\n\nNo, no no, he wouldn't go. Not after what he'd sacrificed. He knew that they were being moved to the camps to die. "There was an agreement!" He protested as two officers went up the stairs to where his wife was. "You can't change it!"\n\n"Agreements are void for the Untermecht," one of the officers sneered. "Whoever made the agreement with you should be dealt with." He heard his wife shriek above, and that forced him into action, not caring if it was futile. He grabbed a nearby candlestick and attacked the nearest SS officer.\n\nIt missed, but he was out of shape and slow. The SS officers laughed as he stumbled forward, and then they moved with batons in hand. The first strike sent him onto the ground and knocked the wind out of him. Pain blossomed all over his body as blows came down on his body and head again, and again, and again.\n\nBroken and beaten, he was barely conscious when they finally stopped, and couldn't muster up strength to move, even as he also saw his wife being roughly dragged down the stairs. The face of one of the men dragging her looked familiar, but his mind was too scrambled to realize who. "He's had enough," he heard a voice that was oddly familiar as both arms were grabbed. "Don't want to damage him for the camps."\n\n"He'll live, and that's what matters," the lead officer said. "Drop them off, we have a few more 'nobles' to arrest today." The officers chuckled, and with the former nobles in hand, left the home."

Yet the Ordensstaat must be pure, and the taint of the Jew and degenerate could not sully it. However, he had devised an inspired solution.\n\nA pure, handpicked Aryan SS orchestra. One which would compose epics and ballads for their people and nation - and today was the first performance. With only himself and his guards as an audience, he eagerly settled in to hear pure Aryan music. The Maestro cleared his throat nervously, and lifted the baton.\n\nWhen the first notes reached his ears, Himmler winced. The notes were shrill, grated on his nerves, and it was simply unpleasant to listen to. "Stop!" He commanded after a few more seconds, and the orchestra stopped. He glared at the cowering Maestro. "I assume you can do better. Try something else!"\n\nThe Maestro stammered an affirmative, and the orchestra began playing another piece - and this one was worse. Another was played, and it was a little more bearable, even if it still sounded like a tortured cat. Himmler couldn't take it anymore. The agonizing music was abruptly stopped as a gunshot rang out and the Maestro fell dead. The musicians froze, unsure what to do. "You all are a disgrace!" Himmler sputtered furiously, lowering his pistol. "Did you do this to mock me?"\n\n"N-n-no, mein Reichsführer," one of the terrified musicians stammered. "We-"\n\n"Perhaps you will think about that when you spend time in the camps," Himmler said coldly, gesturing to his guard who arrested the musicians. He paid their pleas no mind, only bitterly reflecting on the failure of this project. His music catalogue would remain slim, but it seemed he would have to accept that for now."

Indeed: it would be preposterous for any self-respecting Aryan to listen to degenerate music made by enemies of the Burgundian State, which is why I, your Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, have made this educational piece in the hopes of teaching you about the dangers of Judeo-Bolshevism in classical music, along with the few Aryan composers whose music you can enjoy."\n\n"Since the dawn of classical music, the Jews, in their infinite perfidy, have infiltrated this beautiful form of art, in the hopes of perverting the great culture of the eternal Aryan race. While many composers were or are corrupted by Cultural Bolshevism (Mendelssohn, Offenbach and Gershwin are such examples), there are some who, like a beacon in the night, resisted the advance of perfidy and made some truly astounding works of art extolling the virtues of Aryanism and Spartanism. Among those are the eternal Richard Wagner, of course, with his unforgettable Lohengrin being a fantastic retelling of German legends; another composer worthy of our attention is obviously Ludwig van Beethoven, who crafted objective masterpieces that shall last a thousand years."\n\n"Those composers had Aryan blood in them, which is why their work attained such greatness. It is needless to say that Jewish composers cannot even hope to make works of the same quality as Wagner's or Beethoven's, which is why listening to said Jewish musicians is explicitly prohibited in the Burgundian State, as you will understand that letting Judaism enter it would only lead to disaster; if you happen to learn of someone listening to prohibited material, please report them to your commanding officer."\n\nReichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler"

An SS-Charlemagne officer - and if she hated Burgundians, she hated collaborators more.\n\nShe entered the small room where the man was bound, and noticed something off. SS soldiers were usually either stoic or defiant. She took the seat opposite him, eyeing him cautiously for his reaction. Nothing. He seemed like a man who was dead to the world. She resisted a frown.\n\nBefore she could open her mouth, he spoke. "They've sent us to fight you, or die," his voice was as dead as his eyes. No, his eyes were not dead. They were haunted. "None of you know how it really is. I can't do it any longer." His eyes glanced up and met her own. "I'll tell you everything you want to know. Himmler. Charlemagne. The other Legions. I just want one thing."\n\nPatricia was appraising him closely, but she was experienced enough at this point to tell when people were lying. This man was not. "What is it?"\n\n"Get me out," he pleaded in a soft voice. "Make them think I'm dead. Take my uniform, my weapons, whatever you need. Otherwise they'll come after me. And if you won't, then kill me."\n\nShe made a note, unsettled by his demeanor. "You'd rather die than go back?"\n\n"My only fate is execution for failure, or death in camps," the man said.

He took some small solace in the fact that here, at least, he was safe.\n\nIn the French State.\n\nThe village he had found himself in was small, although like many such places, it was overpopulated with refugees who still had yet to be resettled after they had fled from the Burgundian invasion. One of the families that lived there had taken him when he'd crossed the border, and helped settle him, believing him to be a refugee.\n\nIt wasn't a complete lie.\n\nHe fit the profile well enough. He looked the part, he understood the language, and even spoke it relatively well. His uniform had been exchanged for civilian attire. It was fortunate that his benefactors had not paid attention to the fact that his clothes were rather high-quality, and he was rather well-fed from one who had supposedly just escaped from Burgundy.\n\nHe was alive, but living here was its own challenge. It was sickening to be surrounded by so many of the French, and their degenerate culture, but he bit his tongue. He kept his head down, he worked beside the impure, and he received his food at the end of the day. He sometimes wished that he kept the patch of the Walloon Legion with him, but had decided it was safer not to. If he had ever been caught with it, it would have been the end.\n\nHe endured, but he saw no future here. All he could hope for was that the Ordensstaat would one day collapse and he could return to his countrymen to build a new Belgium. One day. For now, he would bide his time."

His hand rested on his belt, near his gun, and the professor was almost certain that the officer was hoping that he gave him a chance to use it. "You have your instructions. Fulfill them, or we will find another who can."\n\nHe wanted to say no. He wanted to say that he couldn't make this work. But they didn't care, and he believed them. Burgundy didn't care about things like "qualifications" or "experience" - they only cared about obedience. If not him, they'd find some brainwashed SS officer to teach, and his only options were to obey or die in the camps.\n\nAnd he couldn't defy, because it wouldn't just be him punished, but his wife and daughter.\n\nSo he bowed his head. "I understand, it will be done."\n\nThe officer almost seemed disappointed, but left his office. The man sank into his chair dejectedly, looking over the papers that had his orders. The university - one of the only ones in Burgundy - needed him to schedule and teach classes. It didn't matter that he wasn't qualified for most of them, or that he was only one man.\n\nIt was a confusing mixture of subjects he'd been given, from normal ones like math, to weapons classes, to "science" classes on race and Aryan supremacy, and mysticism of all things. Half of these had no place in an institution of higher learning, but it didn't matter. They didn't want a teacher, they wanted a propagandist, and that was what he was now.

Book burnings were an important ritual to expunge subversive material from the state. Yet standing and watching as the books were turned to kindling, he was simply unsatisfied.\n\nThis was supposed to be a significant cultural event. A celebration! A purging of the old ways and degeneracy of the Untermensch's mind! But you'd never know, as it was performed with all the pomp of delivering a package. The citizens who had shown up were just milling around, and the SS soldiers mechanically threw books into the fires.\n\nIt was so... insufficient.\n\nIt wasn't just the lack of enthusiasm, it was that he simply didn't feel the act itself was enough anymore. Books could be burned until there were none left, but you could hardly burn information out of the mind of the Untermensch or traitor. It didn't matter if they burned portraits and books if people still remembered the faces and passages in their minds. It frustrated him.\n\nHe tossed a book of his own in the fire, while also noting the SS soldiers nearby. They didn't seem to really care to understand the importance of this ritual, and some of them were idly chatting while absentmindedly tossing books onto another fire. He wondered how many of them used these events to steal banned material for themselves. Clearly, there were some that were less than committed to the National Socialist ideal.\n\nPerhaps, he mused as he tossed another book onto the fire, it was time to take some proactive action. It had been some time since there had been a much-needed ideological culling of the SS, and the Reichsführer would appreciate the opportunity to purge such a rot before it could spread."

This group was mostly children, most with siblings. Old enough to comprehend the lessons, but more importantly understand they couldn't say them to the wrong person.\n\nThe Burgundians seemed determined to culturally eradicate them, but she was determined to make sure they didn't succeed, even if she had to teach in a cold basement infested with rats. It would be easy for her to just sleep after the backbreaking work, but she couldn't just... surrender like that. She could keep the memory of France alive in the next generation, no matter what.\n\n"Now, let's-" she suddenly cut herself off as she heard footsteps above - and went cold. She immediately put a finger to her lips. All of the children went silent, some of the siblings holding each other tight as fear gripped all of them. Heart pounding in her chest, Roselyne waited. She heard the scuttling of rats. She didn't dare make a sound. She'd heard of how the SS would wait to lure their victims into a false sense of security.\n\nMinutes dragged by, until finally she allowed herself to breathe. If they'd suspected something, they would have come down. She forced a smile, and looked back at the small group. "I think they're gone, do we all want to continue?"

 BRG_education.34.d:0 "Olivier strolled into the dimly lit class, it was only illuminated by the fading sun's rays and an ageing incandescent lightbulb that seemed to be on the verge of burning out. The walls had been covered in gunk and seemed like they hadn't been scrubbed in a decade. He glanced at the students and counted 28 or 29 pupils, all of whom wore garbs that wreaked of a rotten odour, stuffed into a room that did not exceed 28 meters squared. Each one of the children had a scrawny complexion, their cheekbones penetrated their skin, and a look of despair as if they were famished and left without any hope of attainable joy, a feeling which was almost certainly exaggerated in their minds after seeing his towering figure and dark black uniform. Olivier turned to the green-board to his back, he took a stick of chalk and the inelegant noise of scratching that the chalk emitted would quickly make itself known. On the board were now inscribed the words "What does it mean to be French?"\n\n" My name is Officer Olivier, dear children, and I've come here to ask you about what you believe being French means?"\n\n"My parents had always told me that a Frenchmen was who he stood for the virtues of equality and liberty that the revolutionary of old yielded."\n\n"Your parents are wrong. The France of the Revolution was one of degeneracy and Bolshevism. A state that once yielded glory and strength was shaken to its core and tricked by a horde of Jewish tricksters into falling into a sea of corruption and degeneracy. The Aryan and his destiny to prosper and rule over a Europe of purity were pushed aside to the side in favour of Masonic nonsense and debauchery. However, all of this would change come the SS and their legions of liberators, the forces of the Reich saved the Aryans of France from serving as slaves to Judeo-Bolshevism. To be French is to be supportive of the SS Charlemagne and hold pride in your race and conviction in its superiority. To be French is to recognise the intrinsic link between pure French culture and the ideals and service of the SS and its legions."\n\nOlivier asked the child his parents' name before exiting and making his way towards the telephone."

However, something had changed. Now the camps were introducing mandatory French "lessons" to the populace, teaching them all the information they needed. They weren't lessons, like those of his childhood, but more repeating what the teacher - a balding, middle-aged SS bureaucrat - said. Those who failed would repeat their task until they got it correct or their bodies gave up. Those who stepped out of line were killed.\n\n"It's Salut Himmler. Sah-lute Him-luh. Fine. If you don't want to play that game, then let's play another. Who are the enemies of the French nation? The Jews. Say it. The Jo-os." the teacher explained.\n\n"The Jo-os.

May they live one hundred years!"\n\nIn the distance, a shot was fired. Then another. Jean dared not peek behind him. Their heinous crime was to fall asleep in class after working for ten hours.

Now, the lights above the sky were blackened by the smoke of Notre Dame. A regiment had been assigned to the burning of the monument, and a collection of other notable buildings dedicated to degeneracy, but all that Pierre could make real note of was that of Notre Dame, as that was the only thing that his grandfather could focus on. The old man could not be torn away from the burning wreck, and had they not been beyond notice in the chaos of the night, they would have been shot where they stood, especially Pierre's grandfather. He was bawling like a child, without a doubt frozen, and if there weren't a dozen shadows running just outside the perimeter of the burning then Pierre would most likely be writhing on the ground with a bullet in his chest.\n\nPierre looked to his grandfather and tugged on his sleeve. "We need to go."\n\nThe glow of the Notre Dame reflected on his face, quivering, looking on at the burning monument to his Christianity. A burning wooden beam crashed to the ground, sending a wave of ashes towards them. The heat washed over them, and Pierre pulled on his grandfather's sleeve.

Even still, he stood firm, unceasingly standing in the street as his tears were not quelled by another beam crashing to the stone.

Now, however, is not the time for ideals; rather, we must begin to focus our efforts on the destruction of these rebellious subhumans and their extermination.

However, no matter how worthy they may be, the disgusting tendrils of corruption have always been a great source of destruction for the Aryan. Once more, we find ourselves facing this destruction again.\n\nDeep within the heartlands of former French territory, where the most corrupt and degenerate culture to ever have the unfortunate chance to rot this world, has taken the sanctity of another group, in stoking the flames of treason throughout the land as so many claim independence and wage war against their rightful lords in the Ordensstaat. Our own units within the Schutzstaffel have decided to defy the orders of their superiors in the Ordensstaat, and proclaim themselves as some abominable form of independent from our command. Whether it be from starvation, degenerative brainwashing, or some other foulness upon the world, these men have defied the Reichsführer-SS; therefore, they must pay the price for their defiance.\n\nAlready, the soldiers of our forces have mustered in preparation to wage glorious war against the defiant. If the defiant rebellion seeks to insult the Aryan way of life like this, then they shall be exterminated alongside the rest."

It is unclear if they are acting on their own, or from other traitorous officers. The capability of internal security is dismal, and they are incapable of investigating and clamping down on these treasonous activities.\n\nPartisan attacks and movements are continuing to take place, with insufficient security to prevent theft, exfiltrations, sabotage, and terrorism. The Red Poppy movement, dominated by French partisans, is taking advantage of the poor security to advance their own objectives, which include the destruction of the Ordensstaat and the expulsion of all Germans from former French territory.\n\nOur border security has similarly declined as the overall situation has deteriorated, and there are almost certainly foreign agents operating in the Ordensstaat, potentially fueling insurrectionist and resistance movements. We have insufficient resources to deal with them.\n\nIt is estimated that if drastic actions are not taken within thirty days, this trend will become irreversible. It is recommended that the security situation be rectified immediately.\n\nHEIL HIMMLER"

What ruins they were, however! The ruins of a project, the ruins of a people, the ruins of a dream; they were his ruins, and yet he was the only one that could be blamed for them. And now, what could he do? Everything had come tumbling down around him, and the Aryan utopia he so-cherished now stood as a pile of rubble, infested by rebellious legions out to get him. Yes, for the first time since many years, Heinrich Himmler was afraid.\n\nAll was not lost, however: surely, there was a way to start again, maybe somewhere else! Surely, the good people of Germany were waiting for him to come back, and would welcome him with open arms as he'd shun the traitors to the fatherland. After all, the German people loved him, back then, and that was probably still the case, wasn't it? Yes, there had to be a way to begin again, he thought as he looked onto a nearby burning house. There had to be a way he could begin again in some other place, where he would have a clean slate to recreate his Aryan utopia anew, free of all the imperfections that had plagued the Ordensstaat. Or was it?\n\nNo, all of this was fantasy. Mere, pure, unabashed fantasy, created by a man who finally and at last realized the closeness of his impending death. Heinrich Himmler, the great Reichsführer-SS and champion of the Aryan race, was going to die, and such a fact had become a matter of when rather than if. He could try to run, yes, and he would try to run; but that wouldn't negate the fact that trying to save his own skin was at best a desperate endeavor. And now, only time would tell when the end would come."

Whoever was behind the soon-to-be-opened doors did not concern him too much: whether it was Walloon or Charlemagne, they were all traitors to him, and it didn't matter much who fired the bullets, for the end result would still be the same. And yet, as the world crumbled around him, he could only feel regret, and hate; regret for not having accomplished more, and hate at himself for letting it all fall.\n\nAfter all, he was the one who allowed the Burgundian project to end up like this. It wasn't Pohl, or Ribbentrop, or any of the million yes-men he had executed during all these years; no; the only culprit here was himself, and all the doubt and hate he had accumulated through the year was finally reaching a boiling point. The situation was adamant: the Ordensstaat-Burgund, the last hope of the Aryan race, was collapsing before his very eyes, and he was the one to blame for it. And now, he was gonna die any minute now and, yet again, all because of himself. Yes, all of his enterprises had thoroughly failed, and all that remained was now a sad, pathetic man, alone in his own decrepit bunker, waiting to be shot like a dog.\n\nAs the doors of the bunker loudly opened, and as soldiers swarmed inside like flies, it was over. Himmler tried to run for safety, but there was nowhere left to go; and when a bullet shot by one of the numerous traitors went straight through his heart, his last thoughts were of Germany, and of how he had failed Her, as he collapsed on the ground."

The truly masterful even recognizes that such ticks of the universe's clock continues through its etchings within the blood and genes of superior men, against those who would deem him enemies.\n\nAnd, today, these superior men find themselves at war with the world, those mighty warriors of our state finding themselves at the mercy of this clock, and our Ordensstaat itself realizing the might of such a master of history as it is. Today, the Frenchmen waving their Blue, White, and Red flags and chanting for the need of republicanism and democracy clutch to the arms of the clock, wielding a ferocious level of corruption to abuse what is meant to be an eternity of masterdom. Today, the Belgian savages the North, ducking and dodging through the numbers around the clock to slash, stab, and murder the just Aryans who settled their, in the name of some sickening form of democratic nationalism, alongside the butcherous Flanderians they find themselves as barbarian neighbors to. And, today, the lecherous Catholic finds himself at the helm of a movement seeking to tear apart and stain the clock with gross, deformed visions of flowers and Judeo-Socialism, as the messages of religions past are brought forward to try to peel loyal and astute citizens to the cause of their wretched "kindness."\n\nEvery man, woman, and child aligning themselves with these traitors have signed upon their own death warrant, silencing the very time granted to them by the clock. Some have risen in open war to attempt to wage war against the Ordensstaat, and we true masters who hold dominion over this world. The Reichsführer-SS, in all of his masterfulness and wisdom, has recognized the need to choose an official side we must aim our forces against, and reap what glory has been given to us under the blessings of the ticking clock."

Rather, those grey skies, with constant downpours of rain and chilling winds carry with it ash, the ash which flutters from the burning corpses of the Aryan's enemies and the trucks and guns we've burned away.\n\nMere hours ago, "Einsatz Ehrentod" began, from Nord-Parisian halls and out onto the battlefields where Aryan soldiers, bred and forged into the machines of war they were destined to be. Out there, the gunfire and pounding of shells splattered the land with rubble and gore, as more and more men fell to their deaths in this dreaded insurrection. However, out there, on the fields and cities where the First and Second World Wars were fought, our enemies beheld a sight they deemed magnificent in their short burst of hope: that is, the Aryan man, retreating from the battle as men put away their guns and seemingly left the trenches that claimed so many men's lives. In those mere moments, flashes of cheering began, as Frenchman and Belgian embraced their comrades as it appeared that the battle had been one for their corrupt democracies, arrogant claims of independence, and disgusting love of an otherwise unholy Church.\n\nHowever, as the decadent are dashed against the might of the just, so too are their hopes dashed against the stone. Fires and plumes of smoke reaching the heavens of Valhalla, visible even from Nord-Paris showcase the destruction sown by the Aryan man. Our unyielding wrath as they find weakness and starvation, with no sign of refuel or resupply as far as the eye may see, upon this scorched earth."

 BRG_collapse.3.t:0 "O'er the Night of the Black Sun"
 BRG_collapse.3.d:0 "The first day was filled with joy and revelry. The entirety of that night had consisted of short, deadly attacks on unsuspecting Schutzstaffel regiments and their officers, breaking up their forces until, eventually, the people united into one grand revolution. Together, we pushed back the Aryans out of the territory they claimed so long ago, and created a state for ourselves. Even the Colonel, as hardlining and traditionalist as a European officer could get, stopped to enjoy the revelry and a glass of wine amidst our military successes against the Aryans who butchered us for so long.\n\nBut, as the war progressed, so too did the joys of that first morning wane. The more firefights, the more loss of men, and while we continued to push back the Aryans, we could not help but feel the weariness grew upon the scorched, broken earth they left behind in their retreat's wake. Nevertheless, we journeyed on, past the wreckage and ruin of our great countryside, now dominated by the presence of Aryan brutalism and tyranny, where every useful station of supply or potential radio area had been smashed and burned. Food and water sources grew more scarce as the days went on, and the lack of supplies and support thanks to the destruction left behind of our enemy's retreat led to infighting in our ranks. The exhaustion grew with every passing of another potential resource that had been left in smoldering ruin.\n\nIn retrospect, that all seemed so simple compared to now. The destruction grew so bad that we came face to face with just continuous blackened ruins, looking more like the battlefield of Verdun or the Somme than typical life. There we made our entrenchment. And there was when the Black Sun rose. As machine guns rained hell on us, before wave upon wave of beast ran at us. Former comrades, beaten and starved into submission, and sent to our ranks with the simplest of weaponry, from outdated rifles to just a set of explosives to the very trench knives used to butcher their countrymen. Now, the Colonel lays next to me in this trench, his skull having been bashed in by the enemy, as his blood drips into my still mouth. Now, all I can do is play dead here, as the enemy scavenges us like beasts, while I merely hope they do not hear my heart beat."

 BRG_collapse.4.d:0 "Things weren't always this way. Being anointed as the commander of some of the largest groups of Waffen-Schutzstaffel divisions is a true honor within the Ordensstaat. However, where glorious success means honor given towards the state and the Reichsführer-SS, dire times lends itself to times away from such success. Rather, it delivers disappointment, and disappointment in this scenario could result in an untimely demise, in a time where every demise would cost the Ordensstaat dearly, given the state of the battlefields out there. However, Peiper would not die easily. No, he would not die at all, provided his plan worked in the face of the Reichsführer-SS himself.\n\nWhat once shined with the brightest of pride and satisfaction in the news of new successes in the name of National Socialism now darkened the room, as the thunderstorm outside already dimmed the area, alongside the ash flying throughout the skies. A conversation followed the entrance into the Reichsführer-SS's office. A conversation which skipped across a dozen or so topics, from our successes, to Aryan traditionalism, to leadership changes, to military doctrine, to our failures. The true meaning of the meeting would eventually crop up, as the Brigadeführer pressed a new idea forward in retrospect to the price of our victory. A victory born through our industry, our propulsion technology, and our warheads, rather than a victory born through the blood of the Aryan soldier.\n\nAnd this was the conversation that led the Brigadeführer to the living situation he found himself in, as the truck continued to rumble, surrounded by four men with assault rifles that were as willing to blow his brains out as any potential threats to the man's life. This would be what Peiper would find for his future, not one in which he could enjoy the pleasures of the battlefield and the taste of the subhuman's blood adorning his lips; rather, it was one of travelling between all of the nuclear weapons facilities to prepare for the next step in this war."

However, history has seemingly flipped to the next page of the chronicle, as we true Aryans have truly been crowned with Masters of this World with the victory we have claimed today.\n\nAcross the Ordensstaat, enemies flee for their lives in hope that they may escape from the fate that had been consigned to them from the moment of their birth as a subhuman. However, what these misguided, misshapen fools trick themselves into believing is that they actually stand a chance against the might of Aryan forces. Where they fell in battle, they surely shall not find themselves successful in what has become their inevitable retreat. Be they one of the decadent Frenchmen, a barbaric Belgian or Flanderian, or one of the Judeo-Bolsheviks rallying behind the image of the Red Poppy, all have fallen against our true and glorious nature, a nature directly encoded into our genetics, as we have found victory once again in the face of the decadence of this world.\n\nAbove all, however, this day proclaims a great triumph for the Reichsführer-SS in the face of the corrupt opposition that so desperately died against our might. Now is not the time to halt, or falter from here, however: now is the time for planning. Now, we bask in the light of our conquest to bring glory to the vision of the Reichsführer-SS."

Whilst war typically regarded the successes of men on the battlefield, the twentieth century now sees conflict as bargaining chips and intimidation, as I'm sure you are more than reluctant to continue under the nose of nuclear missiles under our command. The Ordensstaat, your "exemplary" Aryan population, and yourself will not be able to stand and survive with the nuclear onslaught we promise if you do not comply with the immediate demand of armistice and an end to this slaughterous conflict. You have 10 hours to respond.\n\nChristian de la Mazière"

In recognizing a desire for loyalty and cooperation, I believe it is inherent within the wisdom of the Reichsführer-SS to work towards another solution, rather than allowing his business to be halted at the hands of rebellions and uprisings, of which I believe, if negotiated correctly, could come to a well enough peace between our sides which shall guarantee a new degree of collaboration between the regimes of the Ordensstaat and those among Langemarck.\n\nOf course, the nature of this document begets a certain explanation regarding the sudden reach for negotiations rather than giving the green flag towards further military operations against your own forces. In particular, the military acquisition of nuclear arms developed by the Ordensstaat following several victories against your forces has left the leadership divided between advocates for unrestricted nuclear warfare against the Ordensstaat, and those wishing for a more diplomatic solution. In regards to the latter, we shall use these as a bargaining chip in the potential support of both of our states, so that we may end this conflict for once and for all. Military leadership of the Langemarck organization is dutifully awaiting a response, and will take matters into our own hands if a response is not made."

But when radio static and panic is all you have to work with, how could you ever possibly be prepared in the face of death?\n\nIt all started this morning. The thunderstorm that has persisted over our camp and across the Ordensstaat over the past few weeks died down, thankfully. It took time, effort, and diligence to work your way into the Schutzstaffel leadership, especially as someone with a small familial upbringing, and especially when this certain someone has achieved leadership over KZ-Lager Reimen. However, my leadership qualities were forged in my time, and the call to crisis happened to be one of these skills, which erupted exactly as the radio call came in about the threat of nuclear bombing of several military targets on behalf of the northern rebellions. Camp leadership was in shock, and before I turned to regard the message as a potential false alarm, the radio piped in once more that nuclear targets were expanding as some cities were to be targeted, including valuable industrial areas.\n\nEveryone was stunned, no one could believe that they had gotten their hands on nuclear missiles in the war. But now was not the time for inaction. We ordered the evacuation of the entirety of KZ-Lager Reimen, informing the slaves that they had to be moved in order to supply other areas during a routine inspection, whilst the high command all waited. Eventually, I directly ordered the rest of the high command out, to lead them away. It was then that I faced the reality of the situation. Was this my destiny, deemed unworthy to lead in the Ordensstaat amidst so many powerful Aryan men? I suppose the question could not be answered in time as the missile descended into the sky."

My growth there was slow, but calculated and meticulous. All plans and actions taken with precise estimation with a healthy dollop of cunning backing it, allowing me to climb until I was one of the city's prime members of leadership.\n\nNow, we sit at the head of a convoy, in a cramped steel truck spitting out noxious fumes, running away from the city I held so tightly in my grasp. Now, all plans of mine have fallen to ruin at the hands of the damned barbarians to the Northeast, those who think themselves so proud, so cocksure as to rise against the Aryans who have claimed this land for National Socialism, for the greatness of all of greater men who ought to dominate on this Earth. Threats of nuclear warfare after the destruction of Reimen at the hands of the mongrels who deem themselves worthy of a European throne when they sit upon a throne built from degeneracy and Judeo-Bolshevism. We shall rise once more, past all of their bombings, no matter how many cities it takes.\n\nIt was then that the sonic boom happened, when the bright flash and cloud of smoke shot into the sky, and all of Turonen was enveloped in a wall of nuclear hellfire. All of the men turned and scowled, harrowed by the fear dealt from the atomic blast. One officer broke down in tears, clutching a secret Christian rosary he kept in his trench coat pocket while reciting a Judeo-Bolshevik Hail Mary. With the pulling of the trigger upon my Walther P38, and a crack through the air, all the men paid attention to the former officer, with a whole through his cheek and blood running out his mouth and down his cheek.

Now, however, under the command of both the name of the Reichsführer-SS and the name of Peiper, the Ordensstaat shall reclaim a glorious shine on this world.\n\nDeep within the military complexes of the Ordensstaat, however, was where this process began. Day after day, it was not the assembly of troops, or the training of potential new recruits for high command, or the preparation and deployment of new equipment for the Waffen-Schutzstaffel which would earn us our victory. However, it was the newest Operation issued from the Reichsführer-SS. The immediate direction of nuclear production and resources towards one military operation, an action which shall find French knees quaking, Belgian and Flanderian hugging one another, begging for mercy and forgiveness, and the Catholics praying towards their false gods as they all bear witness to the might.\n\nYes, it may have been the operation of our armored and motorized divisions which helped us to win this war. Yes, the influence of our advanced firearms, exceptional artillery, masterful aerial combatants, and the overall might of the Aryan strongarm as it dealt blow after blow to our enemies, ensuring their spilt blood to be the key to the Second World War.

 BRG_collapse.16.d:0 "From the perspective of the upper echelons of the SS-Burgund, the history and racial characteristics of the French people left a lot to be desired. After all, these were Untermensch thrice beaten by the Aryan, destined to spend some small time serving their superiors material desires, and then soon doomed after the fires consumed the planet. Perhaps this was why, despite the fanaticism and loyalty that SS-Charlemagne had demonstrated during the Second Weltkrieg, they were shunted aside during the implementation of the Ordensstaat and the Burgundian System.\n\nAnd so it has led to this, as the allies of the SS-Bergund fought against it, and threatened to use the very weapons they had long cultivated as a tool for the great global transformation against them. It was this same arrogance that led the Reichsführer-SS and his closest advisors to assume that surely the French legions would not dare to use weapons of mass destruction against their German foes. After all, they were at their core cowardly and degenerate, and thus incapable of matching the will of the Aryan.\n\nBut the French SS legions had been for so long subsumed in the madness and hunger of the Ordensstaat that they had taken its ideology and made it their own. So when Himmler ordered his soldiers to continue the advance, the missles flew. The SS attack positions were obliterated, soon followed by their command infrastructure in the rear, and then the high value targets in the Burgundian interior.\n\nDid they think that there would be no retaliation? That the Burgundians would be too astonished by the nerve of their former puppets to respond quickly enough? Or that they might be lucky enough to kill the Reichsführer-SS in their attack, and his dark state would die with him? No one can say. Perhaps they predicted a response, but chose to go into the darkness on their own terms with as many of the enemy following them as possible.\n\nEither way, the missles flew and the Shadow State, so long submerged in darkness and secrecy, burnt bright for moments before returning to embers. In time, a few survivors would crawl out into the radioactive wasteland, although few would last long."

Compared to the hallowed nations of great renown -- the Aryans, the Yamato people, the Americans -- very little. There were no stories of their feared strength, great constructions, or terrible victories. By the standards of the Reichsführer-SS and his minions, they were a people of small account -- just worthy of having their own small legion within the military of the Ordensstaat, to be quickly wiped out when the true designs of National Socialism were implemented.\n\nBut the arrogance of the Aryan led them to fatally underestimate their opponent. Although not nearly as numerous or well-equipped as their opponents, the SS-Langemarck matched them in the ability to unleash nuclear destruction.\n\n"Surely", thought the Reichsführer and his close compatriots when the missive from their enemy was delivered, "such a small and worthless nation would not dare to challenge the Aryan in a truly total war". They were wrong.\n\nThe Wallonians turned out to be as good as their word, and unleashed a devastating salvo of atomic missiles upon the Burgundians, who promptly retaliated. Everywhere the camps and fortifications for which so many slave lives had been sacrificed were obliterated. The center of the Burgundian leadership, who had remained steadfast in their loyalty, proved unable to survive the fire, and vanished from the public eye."

  BRG_fall_ragnachar_desc:0 "The Ordensstaat that now presides over the west of Europa was first conceived by the wisdom of the Reichsführer-SS as a bulwark of National Socialism that would replace a Western Europe then dominated by the kleptocratic liberals of the West. Standing in his way then was the foe still all too familiar to us now: France. Among the most decadent and morally and spiritually bankrupt of the nations of Europe, this degenerate pestilence has polluted the air of the continent for centuries too long. The outbreak of war in the Reich, while contrary to our initial plans, still provides us an opportunity to exercise a solution to the French problem.\n\nOur solution is to destroy France. The proud warriors of the Ordensstaat have spent a generation training each day and dreaming each night of the opportunity to enact such a boon for the Vaterland, and are leagues better equipped and better drilled than what passes for the army in the Vichy regime. The tragic demise of the Führer and commencement of the Bürgerkrieg shall herald in its silver lining the lasting end of the French people as a rival nation of the Germans.\n\nA final adieu, France."


  BRG_penal_repair_battalions_desc:0 "It is inevitable that even in warfare of the kind most meticulously planned and executed as our victory against the French, some small proportion of the conquest will be spoiled. Besides successfully obliterating the Vichy regime's excuse for a military, we have also incidentally obliterated many roads, factories, and Frenchmen: all valuable resources that need to be maximally utilized if we are to fulfill the plans for development issued by the Reichsführer-SS.\n\nThankfully, the fruits of our labour contain precisely the remedy needed to afford its acquisition. The roads and factories of France were all built by French hands to advance French interests, and those same hands shall now rebuild them-this time, to further the advancement of the German race. Those new, unwilling members of our state shall earn the oxygen and porridge that continues to sustain their lives through an act most uncommon to the French: honest labor. The soldiers that resisted us and the civilians that abetted them shall not be executed en masse, as they deserve, and shall instead be offered the opportunity to assist our regime by rebuilding and upgrading the infrastructure of the newly annexed territory of the Ordensstaat. They shall be grateful for the opportunity, or they shall die."


  BRG_confiscate_all_decadence_desc:0 "That which is most highly treasured by the French is their art and physical culture; paintings, sculptures and the like, all of which are as refuse to us, useless to the Schutzstaffel and to the German people. Our own strict morality is not shared by the art collectors and other deviants of the world, though, and there is no shortage of men as wealthy as they are degenerate who would eagerly pay us outrageous sums for this or that 'work of art'. Wealth buys war material and the resources to construct it, so we are all too happy to oblige."

  BRG_globalplan_elefant_desc:0 "With the situation in the Ordensstaat now confidently secure, we need not concern ourselves with the fate of our base. Now is the time to look outwards. Although the late Führer endured beyond his mishap with our agent, he was not long for this world. Ever since his fateful end, the world has fallen to chaos and anarchy. In this anarchy lies our future.\n\nThe Dark Continent is aflame, as our allies are helplessly locked into a costly yet tame conflict with the Americans, doing battle over the future of those far-flung lands. Perhaps if the right dominoes are felled, then this conflict could escalate into much more than just a battle between pawns upon the global chess board."

  BRG_sowing_the_seeds_of_discontent_desc:0 "If the United States of America is a giant, then it is the most frail giant to ever have been born from the annals of history. In America, they say that their nation stands as a bastion of "liberty" and "freedom". Never before has weakness been so thinly veiled, for the nation is ruled by naught more than a cabal of Jews and delinquents who use their thin veil to milk the placated populace dry, as they seek to once again spread their shadow across the globe.\n\nThe weakness of the American nation can, however, be exploited. We shall mobilize our vast subversive resources to the United States, from where they'll begin their campaign to expose the wicked war of subjugation that their government fights in Africa. The American people have already sown the seeds, all we must do is water the plant and allow it to blossom into a beautiful display of discontent and unrest within the United States."

  BRG_growing_the_chaos_desc:0 "Although the South Africans are not upon our "side" of the war in Africa, they are no good as a foe if they are defeated, and all efforts thus far undertaken by the Ordensstaat will have been for naught should Cape Town fall too easily. The dominoes simply cannot fall should they be stopped short by a premature South African surrender.\n\nThe temporary remedy to this is simple. We shall ensure that they are granted the means to continue their little struggle, so that we may continue setting the stage for a much more exciting act. The South Africans surely won't question whether they should have received any extra deliveries of "American" armaments."

  BRG_cutting_the_cords_desc:0 "Whilst Hüttig and his Afrikan SS believe themselves to be the exemplars of guerrilla warfare, succeeding in bogging down the tides of the South African War, they do not possess the unleashed freedom nor the resources required to cause true guerrilla terror upon the African fronts.\n\nWe need only cut some of the strings which encumber our puppets in Africa, and grant them our remaining munitions and equipment so that they may be orchestrated to conduct true attacks of terror. No road shall be safe, and no bridge shall remain intact, as every step taken further into the heart of Africa shall become an ever more treacherous one."

  BRG_schencks_empty_tanks_desc:0 "Wolfgang Schenck and his Luftwaffe are a terror in the South African skies. There are few places of respite for one to flee the Südwestafrikan birds of prey. And this is precisely the issue. For every day the Luftwaffe dominates the skies of Africa, the road to Cape Town is opened to the Schild ever slightly more. We must buffer the Südwestafrkan air superiority so that the OFN may continue to fight and prolong the war for many more months to come.\n\nTo delay the Südwestafrikan aerial efforts, all we must do is ensure their aircraft face a sudden shortage of fuel. Achieving this will be simple. A few crucial oil shipments will be tragically sunk, as several vital oil and fuel lines become the target of "American sabotage". Not many aircraft engines will be spooling up upon Angolan and Namibian airstrips in coming days."

  BRG_mullers_broken_supply_desc:0 "The forces of the Zentralafrikan Reichskommissariat, despite being possibly the largest force among the Afrika-Schild, also faces the largest difficulties in participating in the war effort. Logistical challenges which cannot be facilitated by their partners in Ostafrika and Südwestafrika must be undertaken directly by them. Such logistical networks, which traverse half of the African continent, are rather fragile.\n\nWe need only block a few roads, detonate a few bridges, and devastate the Zentralafrikan canals, and their entire confused logistical structure will come to a grinding halt, forcing the entire Schild advance upon South Africa to screech to a near standstill."

  BRG_elefant_the_final_moves_desc:0 "In every game of chess, there must be a conclusion. As the pieces are knocked down, and the pawns run thin, the King knows that it must make a decisive move for victory, else the King shall join the fallen pawns. Similarly, all wars must end. As men die and resources are expended, even the greatest of conquerors grow tired of combat.\n\nThe South African War winds down, and a conclusion is inevitable. Yet there are still measures to be taken to ensure that we secure for ourselves a favorable conclusion. Our man in Africa, Hans Hüttig, holds the key."


  BRG_out_of_the_shadows_desc:0 "Hüttig is a bold man, yet the brevity which we require for our goals is far beyond what he has thus far displayed. We must embolden him and his Afrikan SS further, so that there may be no doubt of conflict escalation. And nothing is more emboldening than strength, or rather, the illusion of strength.\n\nWe shall ship out some of our very own military forces to Ostafrika at once. From there, they will be directly deployed into the fray, where they shall no doubt perform with deadly efficiency. Seeing such professional forces in action upon their side will surely grant untold confidence to the Ostafrikans, speeding their previously delayed efforts into motion."


  BRG_hiding_in_plain_sight_desc:0 "Just as "American" armaments were discreetly shipped to the South Africans so that they could continue their fight, the Ostafrikans too require the means to fight. Whilst Hüttig has not been entirely strapped for armaments, if he is to be nudged towards larger efforts, he must have confidence in his stockpiles. We shall give him plentiful confidence."


  BRG_igniting_huttigs_rage_desc:0 "The lush jungles of Ostafrika are home to many things. Exotic wildlife, tremendous sights, and an untold stockpile of chemical weapons. Lethal gases stockpiled throughout the final solution and conquest of Africa now rest securely within well concealed warehouses throughout Africa. It is a source of limitless potential.\n\nIf only Hüttig's fragile rage were to be truly ignited, and his bountiful gaseous weapons unleashed with his rage, perhaps this South African skirmish could evolve in a true war to end all wars..."


  BRG_the_call_to_arms_desc:0 "Heydrich is the only one of the participants of the Bürgerkrieg to hold true to National Socialism. The rest are traitors, their loyalty owed only to capital, haughty generals, or their own egoism. They will all meet their deserved end, as surely as the sun will rise. Yet, it is still incumbent upon us to ensure that the sun rises sooner than later. The German SS pales in comparison to the might of the Burgundian SS, and although we cannot afford to send the whole of our army into the Rhineland to dispatch with the traitors, we will do all that we can to support Heydrich in his rightful ascent to command over Germania."

  BRG_in_heydrichs_wake_desc:0 "A particular weakness of Heydrich's branch of the SS is the lack of due diligence with which it carries out the stabilization of the frontiers of war. When the German SS sweep into a conquered town, they might only find a dozen or so dissidents worthy enough to execute. Were the Burgundian SS to conduct the same operation in the same town, they would certainly kill at least a hundred. Heydrich's men can focus their efforts on the front lines of the war-pacifying the rear is a task best left to us."

  BRG_flood_the_border_desc:0 "Bombs explode and bullets approach from the horizon all over the Reich, and this devastation has not been conducive to the manufacturing capability of Heydrich's swath of territory. If their own factors are not capable of sustaining the war, then it falls on us as his sponsor to fill in the gaps. Those loyal to Heydrich in the Reich who cannot find themselves a rifle of German make to fight with shall fight with a Burgundian one, and the border of the Ordensstaat and the Reich shall be flooded with all manner of war material. It is of a special importance to the Reichsführer-SS that Heydrich wins this war, and the sacrifice of a portion of our industrial capacity is far from too high a price to pay to meet this end."

  BRG_death_from_a_mile_away_desc:0 "The treacherous fiends that fight against a Reich that is truly National Socialist can best be described as 'snakes', and there is an old and a true adage about snakes and heads. A skilled marksman with a good rifle and an extra pair of eyes can turn a well disciplined enemy platoon into disorganized rabble; an excellent return on investment for our purposes. The best snipers our armies have to offer will be sent to the front line to assist Heydrich against the foe, and hopefully impart some of the fundamentals on to his own men. Only the steelest of men can hold fast when death comes from a mile away, and only our men are cut of true steel."

  BRG_terrorkampagne_desc:0 "The air is the most modern of the environs of war, and there too shall the torch of National Socialism hold sway. Every enemy fighter rendered into burning rubble and every enemy city rendered the same will be monuments to the Vaterland-they will be as bonfires, celebrating the victory of the German people over the traitor armies by burning alive the same treasonous swine that sought to corrupt our good women and men. The enemy will know terror, and he will tremble night and day at the thought that the next plane he hears flying overhead will be his last."
  
  BRG_leading_the_charge_desc:0 "We are done "assisting" Heydrich in his war. Now, as the Bürgerkrieg intensifies, is time for us to lead the charge ourselves. The warriors of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund will show Heydrich's loyalists how to fight from example. Our divisions, on the frontline of our own Vaterland, will hold the candle marching into the darkness of the rotten world beyond. Every soldier that fights against us is guilty of treason, and will be afforded treason's legal penalty-as will any of Heydrich's forces who fail to live up to the standards we expect of them. Half-measures are fully over. It is time that Heydrich's attempt to seize power in the Reich either succeds or fails."

  BRG_the_spartan_phalanx_desc:0 "The frustration of our counterparts in the German SS to achieve victory thus far can be attributed to a failure of leadership. As such, it is time that our seasoned leaders begin replacing the most incompetent and least racially pure of Heydrich's own counterparts. Many of his officers have shown talent in the civil war, and will maintain their charges. The rest will be gone, meeting the same fate that rightfully befalls any officer who neglects the responsibilities of command. Only those loyal to our regime and truly steadfast in their dedication to National Socialism have any place in the chain of command. A phalanx is only as formidable as its weakest shield."

  BRG_blot_out_the_sun_desc:0 "Everything in the Ordensstaat capable of flight will be sent east to aid in the war. Our fighters will be mass produced at the tallest heights of production thought reasonable to mandate, and then 10% more. Our aircraft shall blot out the sun over the Reich, and the coming of the shade will be the coming of the SS. Ours is the side of the Bürgerkrieg of the most pure of the German people fighting for the most zealous interpretation of the German ideology, and we are equally proud of both. Let the gunfire raining from the sky be our testament to the ancestors of the German nation that we still hold to them, and we fight the traitors in their name."

  BRG_fire_and_brimstone_desc:0 "Guns are not enough. Bombs are not enough. To destroy most of the enemy, to damage his industry moderately, to kill many of his men-it is not enough. We must have it all. They all must die, they all must crumble, they all must burn: and there are few weapons capable of achieving this totality of destruction. Thankfully for the nation, the superiority of German science has long conceived of an answer to the conundrum of moderation in warfare. All across the Ordensstaat, rocket facilities and weapons to launch from them are being constructed, that we might smite not a single enemy from a single mile away, but thousands of enemies from hundreds of miles away. When rockets rain down on the industrialists factories, liberal universities are obliterated in explosions, and the prides of generals are reduced to ash in their mouths at the site of the calamities befalling their armies, the only Germans left standing will be those standing behind our lines."

A shame, but Heydrich is best remembered as a symbol of how far the Reich has fallen. Regardless, that does not mean we cannot gain from his defeat. There are lessons that can be learned, and with his forces broken, we can profit off of his collapse - and the chaos that was caused."

We will reach out to the logistics officers we have identified as acceptable, and offer them safe haven from the slavering barbarians who seek to punish them for the crime of cleansing the Vaterland of its sickness.\n\nWithin the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, they will find purpose.

Yet the Reichsführer-SS is capable of mercy, and has instructed that we bring them into the Ordensstaat. Here they will be carefully screened and observed.

Yet the Reichsführer, in his cunning, has determined a means of extracting what we can.\n\nWe will send small teams into Heydrich's old territory and smuggle out as much as we can, dismantle what is necessary, and sabotage the rest.

Their actions are no longer important - For now, we will focus on our internal matters.\n\nIt may not seem like anything of worth can be learned from Heydrich's SS, but the Reichsführer-SS has wisely determined that the members of Heydrich's SS whom are acceptable should be consulted. While Heydrich was a failure, there are lessons to be learned from his collapse.\n\nOnce their notes and experiences are compiled, our best and brightest will use this to incorporate into our own forces to refine and shape an SS that will be stalwart defenders of the Aryan people - and most importantly will never fail."

They will be grateful for the lesson. Everyone shall be."

 ### Decisions shit fuck you git

 BRG_gcw.1.t:0 "The First Crossing"
 BRG_gcw.1.d:0 "The report that Heydrich held was short, curt, and had been expediently delivered to him an outpost on the shared German-Burgundian border that was carefully monitored. He'd had an expectation of what would be inside, and the script was prompt, to the point, and most importantly, expected.\n\nMore soldiers from Burgundy had crossed the border. The report described them dressed as men whose uniforms lacked labels, symbols, or anything that would identify them as Burgundian. The only exceptions were the twin bolts of the SS on their helmets - which was hardly unique to Burgundy.\n\nDespite that, Heydrich knew that everyone knew who they were, and who they represented.\n\nHimmler would not remain idle. Not when the National Socialist ideal could be restored.\n\nHeydrich was not especially concerned that this would be ultimately controversial to the other pretenders even if links could be proven. It was expected that he and Himmler were connected, and if Speer, Bormann, and Göring had their own allies - he could also accept help from his own. There was a long, bloody fight ahead.\n\nAt the same time, he was not a fool. Himmler almost certainly was having his divisions conducting other operations within Germany while supporting his own bid for Germany - but that was a matter that he would not broach now. There was a war to win, and he had best do it before he was crushed."
 BRG_gcw.1.a:0 "They needed all the help they could get."

 BRG_gcw.2.t:0 "The Second Crossing"
 BRG_gcw.2.d:0 "A line of trucks crossed the bridge under a moonless night.\n\nThey were unmarked, but they were clearly intended for military usage. Most would recognize the design as German, and only the true experts would note the ever-so-slight changes that differentiated it from those used in Germany. And there was only one place where such a vehicle could come from.\n\nThe Black State.\n\nThe trucks stopped at the outpost, exchanged a few words with the guards, and were guided by Heyrich's SS forces to park and deploy. Soldiers exited from the trucks, men with stoic faces; men who walked with an unnaturally controlled and precise movement. Their uniforms were clearly derived from the SS, grey and black as the night they were arriving in. Yet the only indication of who they were was the twin bolts on the sides of their helmets.\n\nGottlieb was just an SS soldier, a guard who was charged with making sure the German-Burgundian border was secure. He didn't have interactions with the actual Burgundians other than watching them come across the border. There were more this time there than the last. More trucks arrived, soldiers exited, and marched to meet with one of Heydrich's officers who began organizing the reinforcements.\n\nFrom his own observation, he felt like there were a lot of Burgundians now in Germany. It was good, since they needed all the help they could get to win the civil war. However he couldn't help but think about the rumors surrounding Himmler; about how Heydrich was his puppet. He shook his head. Nonsense, of course, but it did make him pay close attention to the Burgundians.\n\nBecause he was sure not all of them were soldiers."
 BRG_gcw.2.a:0 "And some of them could be trouble."

 BRG_gcw.3.t:0 "The Third Crossing"
 BRG_gcw.3.d:0 "SS Officer Elias Kantorowicz appraised the Burgundian Officer with a mixture of relief and trepidation.\n\n"Here to assist the war effort, directly upon the orders of the Reichsführer," the Burgundian said, snapping into a salute. "Officer Fischbein."\n\n"Officer Kantorowicz," he said, returning the opening salute. "I'll direct you to Officer Tanne. We have some fronts where we could use your soldiers."\n\nOfficer Tanne by his side indicated for the Burgundian to follow him, and he did as the other Burgundian soldiers disembarked from their trucks, weapons in hand as they prepared to transfer to other trucks that would take them to the front. At this point Elias had lost count how many Burgundians were here now.\n\nIn the beginning they'd kept diligent records on who exactly was crossing, as Heydrich ordered that there was a full accounting of who was crossing the border. However as the war had continued, this had become less important. The fronts needed soldiers, and soldiers as soon as possible. There was no paperwork now, there was only moving as many soldiers into action as soon as possible.\n\nHe couldn't help but wonder what Himmler's endgame here was. There were a substantial number of Burgundians who were in Germany now, and fighting in the civil war. He wondered how many had died, and was sure it was a lot. This was a substantial investment, and some of the men here were wondering if Burgundy would actually intervene directly.\n\nElias didn't think so. Not after France. But the rumors persisted, some almost with hope as the war dragged on. They would die for Heydrich when all was said and done - but each knew the odds were against them - and ironically, their own hope came from the nation of the Black Sun."
 BRG_gcw.3.a:0 "We can only hope this is enough."

 BRG_gcw.4.t:0 "REPORT: Multiple Officer Assassinations"
 BRG_gcw.4.d:0 "TO THE FÜHRER OF GERMANY\n\nSUB: ASSASSINATION OF SENIOR FIELD OFFICERS\n\nSUMMARY: There have been numerous confirmed reports from the front of multiple ranking and junior officers being deliberately assassinated through sabotage, suicide attacks, snipers, and other exotic methods of elimiantion (such as poisoning, rigged firearms, and immolation). We have been working to identify the source of these assassination, and have acquired intelligence indicating this is not a phenomenon exclusive to our forces.\n\nOther contenders are also experiencing attacks on their officer corps, and we believe this to be the work of SS spies, likely from the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. These spies have infiltrated our forces, are behind our lines, and are causing chaos on the fronts even as we work to adapt to this changing environment. All SS assassins have committed suicide when they have been pursued and cornered. We consider the possibility of successfully capturing them unlikely.\n\nThese assassinations have nonetheless had a tangible impact on our fighting capability. While we are conducting field promotions and working to identify suitable replacements, this will hinder our offensive capabilities for the short term.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"
 BRG_gcw.4.a:0 "Hopefully the new boys can step up."

 BRG_gcw.5.t:0 "REPORT: Major SS Terror Attack"
 BRG_gcw.5.d:0 "TO THE FÜHRER OF GERMANY\n\nSUB: MAJOR SS TERROR ATTACK\n\nSUMMARY: Information is beginning to be collected on a recent terror attack conducted by what is believed to be SS forces, who are believed to be aligned with the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, led by Heinrich Himmler. Witnesses report a number of suspicious figures near the bombing site prior to detonation, who wore no identifying markings.\n\nIt is almost certain that Himmler is attempting to obfuscate his meddling in the conflict, and that these terror attacks are not isolated to just our forces. The primary bomb was placed in a major arms factory, resulting in significant damage.\n\nSmaller bombs were placed around other vital infrastructure including power grids, water pumps, and places of mass civilian concentration, including schools and stores. There have been several dozen civilians killed from this attack, and several hundred who are injured and are currently being treated.\n\nRecovering from this attack will require a significant amount of time and resources and cost us manpower, and money. This will also significantly impact the local economy, and we can expect this effect to be compounded if these terror attacks continue.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"
 BRG_gcw.5.a:0 "We need to keep our eyes open."

 BRG_gcw.6.t:0 "REPORT: Military Infrastructure Sabotage"
 BRG_gcw.6.d:0 "TO THE FÜHRER OF GERMANY\n\nSUB: SABOTAGE OF MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nSUMMARY: As of the sending of this report, a significant number of radar stations and anti-aircraft emplacements have suffered expensive damage in one of our forward positions. Engineers are working to restore the equipment to full functionality, but the explosions claimed the lives of a number of maintenance staff, as well as bystanders.\n\nA subsequent lockdown and interrogation of witnesses has led to the culprits almost certainly being SS infiltrators who are almost certainly connected to the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. We were unable to capture any of these infiltrators alive, and several that we did corner committed suicide before they could be subdued.\n\nThis raises significant concerns as to our internal security, and ability to counter these infiltrations. We do not know how many SS infiltrators there remain, but this attack has significantly weakened our ability to defend that location, and it is extremely likely that there will be additional similar attacks in the coming days.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"
 BRG_gcw.6.a:0 "Lock these places down now!"

 BRG_gcw.7.t:0 "REPORT: Major Railway Sabotaged"
 BRG_gcw.7.d:0 "TO THE FÜHRER OF GERMANY\n\nSUB: MAJOR RAILWAY SABOTAGED\n\nSUMMARY: Approximately three hours ago it was confirmed that a major railway has been heavily damaged due to multiple bombs being placed along the railway, dispersed every two hundred meters to cause lasting damage and hinder rapid restoration.\n\nBased on the methods utilized, particularly the staggered method of sabotage, this is likely the work of SS infiltrators, who are almost certainly connected to the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund. Thus far railways and other critical infrastructure has remained untouched due to the intention of other contenders to utilize it for their own forces.\n\nWith this railway sabotaged, the region will almost certainly experience multiple supply issues until it is repaired. Our engineers and labor are moving to restore the railway as fast as possible, but we will need to be careful with our current supply, and use our forces carefully.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"
 BRG_gcw.7.a:0 "Himmler will answer for this one day."

 BRG_gcw.8.t:0 "Marksmanship"
 BRG_gcw.8.d:0 ""Glory to the German Reich. Heil Hitler! Heil Göring!" the cadet said, throwing a Hitler salute. Crisp and sharp, just like how the Field Marshal wanted. No, not wanted. Expected.\n\nFerdinand Schörner tried to fit the medal - although nowadays it seemed that there were too many prizes and not enough victories to merit them - onto the cadet. Stumbling on the catches and pins, Schörner fumbled it onto the lapel of the young man. Giving a stoic nod, Schörner mumbled a thank you and walked to the next soldier. Schörner examined the man through his thick brimmed sunglasses. No older than 20, he supposed. A tragedy for the mother involved in making this little child, but this was war. Not just war, but a war amongst brothers. Nothing was off-limits now. Every man, woman and child was a target in the struggle for the future.\n\nFerdinand felt Frederick and Blücher's eyes watching him - their vengeful spirits watching his damnation. They mourned the death of Germany, and they grieved for the fate of their eras. Schörner, too, mourned their passing. Childhood stories of Prussian heroism and extraordinary feats against the dastardly Austrians, French and - most of all - the accursed Russian Empire were now nothing but a casualty to the winds of time. Prussia was dead, with only its damned successor to look after its remains. Schörner looked at his hands - the hands bloodied by patricide. He would never wipe them clean.\n\nThe Field Marshal did not remember what the young man said. He could have said "Heil Göring ". He could have told Ferdinand to fornicate with his parents. Either way, he moved on to the next cadet. This war would never end. Not at le-\n\n"Heil Himmler!" the cadet behind him shouted, pulling out a Mauser.\n\nThe next few seconds were hazy, as they always were during combat. A shot rang out, dropping Schörner to the ground like a wet bag of concrete. A flurry of shots responded to the assassination attempt, pinning the corpse of the would-be assassin to the wall behind him. Ferdinand's bodyguards came over, rolling their boss over. Nothing. Not a single wound on him.\n\nWhat they did find was a furious Field Marshal gesturing at his bent ankle. Kicking, screaming and still very much alive."
 BRG_gcw.8.a:0 "The SS obviously do not train their agents in shooting, it seems."

He'd chafed as he'd watched the Legions rebel and dissidents spread, as he knew this would have never happened under his watch.\n\nFinally, his patience had been rewarded, and he had been chosen to become the Security Minister - and the Reichsführer had come to personally give him his first assignment. Or would, eventually. It seemed the Reichsführer was late to the meeting, but Barbie was certain he was just distracted by important work. When he arrived, he would see that Barbie was fully prepared for the job. His uniform was pressed, his medals shined, and his posture impeccable.\n\nAt last, the door to the office opened, and Barbie sprang to his feet and extended his hand. "Heil, mein Reichsführer!"\n\nThe Reichsführer betrayed no emotion of course - a pure professional, even if an observer might say he didn't seem to care. He took his seat behind his desk, and got to business. "Minister Barbie, this will be short. The traitorous Legions are dealt with, and we must ensure that their rot has not spread further." The Reichsführer's eyes narrowed behind his glasses. "Your predecessor was removed for his incompetence in this matter. I trust you will not repeat his mistakes."\n\n"Of course not, my Reichsführer," Barbie hastily answered. "I assure you, all threats to the Ordensstaat will be purged."\n\nThe Reichsführer nodded once, and slid over a folder. "It is time for our work to be finished. Cleanse the Ordensstaat of the remaining rebellion and degeneracy. Do not fail me." With that, he stood again, leaving the folder of orders containing the lists of cities to be cleansed, dissidents to be hunted, and traitors to be executed."
 BRG_novak_barbie.1.a:0 "Barbie took the folder, and smiled."

 BRG_novak_barbie.2.t:0 "Liquidation"
 BRG_novak_barbie.2.desc:0 "The Brutalist cities were to be the places where the Ordensstaat's control was absolute. Yet unfortunately, evidence had emerged showing that even these places were not free of the rot of subversion and rebellion. Rogue elements infested it. Traitors and spies; workers sabotaging factories; opportunists stealing supplies.\n\nBarbie stood just beyond one of these cities, as grey clouds hung overhead. The SS legions stood behind him, preparing to deploy. The Reichsführer had charged him with purging all resistance to the Ordensstaat, and today that work would begin. He turned to his officers. "Tear this city apart until the dissidents are found."\n\nAt his command, the SS marched.\n\nThe factories were secured first, then the barracks, then the administrative buildings. Judgement began at the top, and incompetence would no longer be tolerated. There were none who were above suspicion of harboring treasonous elements or rebel sympathies - wittingly or otherwise. The city administrator, along with his entire staff was executed in the streets. Then the local SS commanding officers. Then the factory managers.\n\nEvery worker was lined up and questioned. Some were killed on the spot. Others were taken away for interrogation. The local SS soldiers were given a similar treatment. Once the factories and garrison were cleansed to Barbie's satisfaction, they moved to the apartments. Block by block, door to door, the SS hunted.\n\nFamilies were ripped apart as the SS dragged parents and children away, and apartment windows flashed white as gunshots sounded. It was impossible to run. It was impossible to escape. When it was done, there was no one in the city who emerged unscathed. But no one dared even whisper the name of the monster who had drowned their city in blood. They called him something else."

Slaving in one the factories for years now, he'd seen enough to know that the only way anyone escaped was in a body bag - and those were the lucky ones. Some days he'd wondered if he had died, and he lived in hell. He didn't know if there was a difference between the two anymore.\n\nNow it had become worse.\n\nTheir quotas, already impossibly high, had been raised to even more ludicrous levels. They simply couldn't meet them. They were too weak. They were too few. The machines could literally not operate faster. The foremen didn't care.\n\nWhen they'd tried to explain, when they asked simply why their quotas had increased, they were just berated and screamed at - or shot. Their eyes were crazed by fear, and their screaming had a frantic tone. Leon understood why - if they didn't meet quota, they would suffer as well. There was only suffering in hell, not even the foremen were immune to it.\n\nThere was only one ruler of hell, and his name was Heinrich Himmler.\n\nHe was weaker than he had ever been before. He barely had strength to move anymore. Every day more workers simply keeled over and died and bodies dragged away to the furnaces. One day it would be him, and only God knew when it would be - if there was a god watching at all. Yet curiously, with that realization came a desire to control how it ended.\n\nAll of them were cornered animals in this dungeon - and if their end was inevitable, perhaps they should fight back while they still breathed."

The SS had never treated them well, but they were a small community on the edge of Burgundy. For a long time, the SS had been more focused on problems in the cities than rural villages. Now, something had changed, and the SS had begun arriving and conducting patrols, inspections, and arrests.\n\nDozens had disappeared. From little boys, to aging grandmothers. No one knew where they had been taken, and feared the worst - and the SS was not forthcoming about their fates. But they all saw the results. So many had vanished, and they were starting to realize this wasn't going to stop. "It's over, isn't it," one man murmured. "They won. Now we're being punished." No one said anything at first, as if acknowledging this would make it real.\n\n"What can we do?" A teenage girl asked in a timid voice.\n\n"Nothing," the man closed his eyes, his voice empty. "It's hopeless now. Everyone that could do something is gone..." it seemed to be too much, and the man broke down, tears falling from his eyes as despair washed over all of the gathered - except for one.\n\n"No, it's not over," another man said, an older one with a patchy beard. A low anger colored his tone, no trace of despair to be found. He rested a hand on the man's shoulder. "We've endured long enough. We cannot - will not - go to this slaughter willingly." He looked at the rest of the small gathering. "We have nothing to lose now - and death is better than this."\n\nOne by one, those gathered nodded, and with the SS long gone, plotted long into the night, preparing for when they would return next."

It was exceptional news, and it finally - finally - seemed like things were improving.\n\nIt had perhaps not been as smooth as he had wanted, but at long last all of the traitors that had plagued him had been removed through his will and might alone. Now, he could take a moment to breathe and enjoy this victory for a brief moment. There was still work to be done, but he knew there was nothing that stood in his way.\n\nHe set the report to the side, and leaned back in his chair. Already his mind was moving towards the next phase; perhaps a proper restart to make up for lost time, or expanding the Ordensstaat's reach even further across France and the rest of Europe. He closed his eyes, feeling this was a moment of relaxation well deserved.\n\nAn explosion shook the room.\n\nHimmler jerked upwards, nearly falling out of his chair, as his eyes shot open.

"We think the grid is failing."\n\nThe words didn't immediately register with the foreman. "The Rodomo grid?"\n\n"No, the entire grid!" The engineer's voice was frantic. "The entire country is about to go dark!"\n\nThe foreman paled.\n\nThe lights flickered and again went dark.\n\nWhen it came back on, the Foreman began yelling, ordering them to stabilize the local power. They depended on the grid for power, and if it failed... he wasn't going to think about that yet. A scream caught his ear in the distance, and more shouting followed. It confused him at first, until it struck him like a bolt of lightning. "Status on the Rodomo camp fence!"\n\nAn engineer glanced at the monitor, and his face turned white. "Offline!" The Foreman froze; if the electric fence had gone offline, then that means the slaves-\n\nThe door was suddenly thrown open, and the victims of their abuses stormed in. Bony, starving, scarred, they clutched factory tools in their hands. The foreman saw their eyes burning with fury, and knew it was too late. Paralyzed with terror, his last sight was the wrench that slammed into his head - And the last things he heard were the screams of his crew as they were slaughtered."

 BRG_novak_barbie.7.desc:0 "SS Officer Lasse rested his hands on the table, trying to hide the trembling throughout his body as he surveyed the map, upon which was scrawled with red and blue X's and circles. A radio rested nearby, the last line of communication they had and for now mercifully silent. Reports were coming in across the Ordensstaat. Nanzig, Rodomo, and Leyden had all fallen to armed revolution. Firefights were breaking out everywhere else between rebels and SS units.\n\nThe Ordensstaat was collapsing.\n\nFor hours now, he'd listened to frantic soldiers over the radio screaming they were being overrun. It didn't matter if the SS better weapons, they didn't have the manpower. Order had previously been kept through the SS Legions - and those Legions had been purged with no replacement. With the grid failure, there was no way to maintain order - not when the slaves outnumbered them.\n\nHis own orders had come in from Nanzig itself - they were to march on Brussels and put down the rebellion in the city by any means necessary - up to and including full liquidation of the city. The barracks was filled with the sounds of men assembling into formation, reading their weapons, and preparing for a bloody conflict. He believed they had enough men to take Brussels but...\n\nLasse looked at his men around him. No pride or duty in their eyes, only terror; they were unafraid to show it now, because they could see it in him as well. For a brief moment, he thought of how they had treated the slaves and abused them. For they were not even human, were they? That's what they'd been told. Now, as the fires raged across Burgundy, he found himself forced to confront the consequences of their treatment - consequences that had claimed many lives already.\n\nHe and his men would pay for their actions - in this life, or the next."

He was above consuming this poison; it was a betrayal of the Spartan ideals he championed. Yet he needed it. He had no one to turn to, nothing to give him solace.\n\nHow? How could this have happened?\n\nHe poured another glass, his shaking hand spilling more whiskey on his desk that he wiped up haphazardly with a cloth. The room was too hot. Sweat covered his body, and no matter how much he wiped it away, he couldn't stop sweating. His clothes clung to his skin, and his breath came in short bursts.\n\nHe couldn't stop shaking.\n\nBurgundy remained under lockdown in a few areas yet. Control over the country had been partially reestablished - for what good it did. The factories had been torched, and it would take months to replace them. Cities had also been burned to husks. The power was still intermittent, and every so often he would be plunged into darkness.\n\nHe'd done everything right. Everything! And now this happened?\n\nHimmler closed his hand into a fist to stop the trembling. No. No, this was not over. He was going to find out what had happened and who had betrayed him in his moment of triumph. Without wasting another moment, he grabbed a paper to commission a report. He would know how the grid had failed, and what caused the subsequent breakdown. He would have his answers.\n\nAnd those who had caused this would pay dearly."

 BRG_novak_barbie.9.desc:0 "The report had come back, and Heinrich Himmler was horrified beyond belief. His face, already pale from decades of plotting, scheming, and murdering, became more reminiscent of paper or bone as the assistant fearfully recounted the true state of his country. His head span and his stomach turned ever more violently.\n\nThe Burgundian economy - contrary to the rosy reports Himmler always received - was in fact worse than in shambles. Even the poorest hovels in the most bombed-out African and Russian wastelands were more prosperous than Burgundy. In the decade since the destitute Germania regime had betrayed its duty to beat the subhumans into submission their pitiful excuses for countries had recovered. On the other hand, the terrified adjutant recounted, Burgundy had crashed uninterruptedly, going into a Stuka-like nosedive in recent years.\n\n"Herr Reichsführer, there is nothing left anywhere. The Order State is in an advanced state of total collapse. There's nothing left to feed the troops, still less to feed the slaves. And as for your Globalpläne, there's nothing left for them either."\n\nIt was then when he realized with a start that this meant that his noble plan to save the world would be no more.\n\nWith that he had had enough.\n\nThe aide had begun to expostulate on how few options there were available to right the ship, but Himmler got up before he could finish.\n\nThe aide, shocked into silence by Himmler's sudden movement, watched in horror as the Reichsführer-SS staggered out of the room, his face pale, clutching at his stomach."

 BRG_novak_barbie.11.t:0 "Reflection"
 BRG_novak_barbie.11.desc:0 "Hours had passed since the economic report that threw everything Himmler had known out the window was presented, but he still sat in his office, utterly shocked by the things he had heard. No amount of flung objects and broken implements had helped him cope with the pain, and now he was surrounded by a veritable mess of paper and shards.\n\nHe could not believe it. All the lies and deceit - Pohl, Degrelle, Barbie, Novak, the other assorted subhumans masquerading as Aryans - had led to the destruction of the Burgundian State, of HIS Burgundian State.\n\n"It's a horrible, unjust tragedy," Himmler muttered. "I built Burgundy with my own will, my own power. I had a perfect Aryan vision, and I would have been able to implement it had all these pathetic weaklings kept tearing it down to its current- current- feebleness!" But as he wallowed in self-pity he did not realize that the true reason Burgundy had declined could be found in his own neglected body, ridden down with mostly avoidable pain and disease.\n\nHimmler began to think about all the things he had wanted to do to save the world from itself, all the things he wanted to create, before realizing that this was actually an opportunity. Yes, an opportunity - and as he realized this, his pallor dimmed and a half smile crossed his face.\n\nThis "rebellion" might have given him the chance he needed. To wipe out all the traitors standing right in his sight, to rebuild, brick by brick, what was taken from him. He had done it once before. Who said it couldn't happen again?"
 BRG_novak_barbie.11.a:0 "Icarus once again takes flight."

 BRG_novak_barbie.12.t:0 "Weakness"
 BRG_novak_barbie.12.desc:0 ""Thank you, mein Reichsführer, I assure you I will not fail."\n\nAdolf Eichmann set the phone down, and smiled. It was a promotion long-overdue, but Himmler had finally seen his worth. With his impending promotion to deputy, he would have the influence he deserved - and he intended to make the most of it. There was much to be done in the Ordensstaat, and the Reichsführer had already given him work to do.\n\nFiles and reports were stacked in front of him, one which he now dutifully went through. Yet as he did so, he could only despair at the state of the nation. It was a mess; incompetence was visible at every single turn. The economy was non-existent, rebel groups were springing up by the day, the citizens were starving, and the power could fail again at any point.\n\nThe more he read, the more disgusted he grew. Himmler could blame degeneracy and incompetence all he wanted, but everything pointed to rot that had been festering for a very long time. He knew how things worked - there was only one man who made the final decisions in the Ordensstaat.\n\nAll he could do was shake his head. He had exploited the decadent superpowers of the world. He had done all of this without ever losing control, proving his competence to both the Ordensstaat and National Socialism. Himmler? All he saw was a failed state, led by a weak man. Himmler may have built it, but his chance had come - and he had failed. The results spoke for themselves.\n\nTreasonous thoughts these were, but the evidence was in front of him - which he had no intention of ignoring. Himmler was a failure for many reasons, and one was that he denied the truth before his eyes. Eichmann, however, was not so blind. No, there was only one way this weakness would be purged from the state."

 BRG_novak_barbie.13.t:0 "Phoenix"
 BRG_novak_barbie.13.desc:0 ""Yes? Duly noted. Thank you." Albert Eriksson put down the phone, and exhaled. His promotion to head of Internal Security was something monumental. Not official yet, but Himmler's secretary had promised it would be soon. He'd wondered if this was coming, but he hadn't allowed himself to hope or break the mask he'd maintained for years. Not yet.\n\nBy all rights, as a Fleming, the most he should expect was subservience. He was not of the "master race", but had remained loyal all the same. And while Himmler's "loyal" Aryans had failed and betrayed him, he had never given the Reichsführer reason to doubt. It had been a long game he'd played. He had endured scorn and mockery from his countrymen. But he had bided his time, enduring Degrelle's idiocy, and remaining in the shadows, while slavishly professing his loyalty - all sacrifices to an uncertain future.\n\nIt had been a long, painful road, but - finally - his loyalty had been rewarded. All the same, he couldn't become complacent.\n\nIt would do no good to overplay his hand. He had to keep up the facade just a little longer. He had waited years, and would not squander it due to impatience. The Ordensstaat's days were numbered - and it would fall. But like a phoenix, Flanders would rise from its ashes. A nation of true National Socialism - one purged of Himmler's incompetence, and obsessions with mysticism.\n\nIt would not be the Flanders of old. It would be something greater.\n\nEriksson idly withdrew a bottle of wine from his safe. It was a memento from the Charlemagne raid, one he'd been saving for a special occasion - and if this wasn't such an occasion, he didn't know what was. He felt a pang of regret that he could not share this moment with his men, but the charade only needed to be maintained a just while longer."

 BRG_novak_barbie.14.t:0 "Condemned"
 BRG_novak_barbie.14.desc:0 "Eriksson kept his face impassive as the men filed into the room. He looked at the faces of everyone else. Barbie, Novak, the foreign minister Schellenberg, he could tell they were lying to themselves; trying to convince themselves that their service would spare them from the Reichsführer's petty wrath. His position may be secure, but they were not so fortunate.\n\nAs Himmler entered, Eriksson wondered if it had been the stress of the past days - or if Himmler had always looked this pathetic. Sweat soaked his skin, dark circles were under his eyes, his posture was slouched, and his voice seemed raspy and trembling. He knew he wasn't the only one who noted how utterly defeated Himmler looked as he began speaking.\n\nThe Reichsführer's voice was almost halting at first, but soon grew angry. He screamed at how everything had gone wrong, ranted about how he had built the Ordensstaat himself. How he had endured treason and incompetence. Seeing him this unhinged would have struck fear into them once, yet Eriksson couldn't see Himmler as anything but what he truly was.\n\nAn awkward, old, and sad man who had lost his hold on reality.\n\n"I have said enough," Himmler muttered, seeming to slump as the energy left him. "Eichmann, Eriksson. Only two you have remained steadfast and loyal. The rest..." his eyes narrowed at the others seated. "You have failed me for the last time, and shall be punished appropriately."\n\nThe gathered men took their death sentence in stride. SS officers entered the room to take them away while the condemned stood, faces impassive and pale. Barbie visibly swallowed, but stood straight and firm as he was led out. The others were less composed, but none fought back. As the men were led out, he met Eichmann's eyes, and no words needed to be said. The final obstacles had been removed."
 BRG_novak_barbie.14.a:0 "There was no one to stop them now."

 BRG_novak_barbie.15.t:0 "Understanding"
 BRG_novak_barbie.15.desc:0 "Eriksson had expected the lunch with Eichmann to be a necessary, but boring affair - and it had started that way. The new deputy had droned on about statistics and numbers for a solid half hour, but had now gone quiet. The only sound that filled the air was the quiet clinking of silverware, and Eriksson finally noticed something off about his demeanor.\n\n"How much longer do you think he has?"\n\nEriksson's eyes widened, surprised that Eichmann was asking. Before he could manage an answer, Eichmann lifted a hand. "Relax. No one's bothered to check if the bugs I removed are still there." He glanced upwards, thoughtfully. "Personally, I give him ten years, maybe-"\n\n"Five."\n\nEichmann raised an eyebrow, but nodded. "I've seen some of the doctor's reports. Exaggerated beyond belief. He can barely attend meetings anymore, let alone manage the Ordensstaat."\n\n"A disgrace," Eriksson shook his head. "Himmler may have built the foundation of Burgundy, but he can no longer lead it. Someone else must take up the mantle of National Socialism. Someone capable and strong."\n\nEichmann's lips pulled back knowingly. "On that, we agree." He stood, with Eriksson joining him. "Thank you, Albert - we will need to do this again." As both men walked towards the door, all said and unsaid was clear between them. The Reichsführer remained, but his power faded each day to them until only a shadow was left.\n\nWhile the power was divided, it was all in their hands. Aligned, but not allies, they knew that a nation of perfected National Socialism could only have one leader. Who it would be had yet to be determined - but both men knew one thing for certain."

SUMMARY: Within the past twenty-four hours, we have confirmed that the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is currently engaged in a protracted insurrection and facing imminent state collapse. We have high confidence in this assessment due to extensive interviews from refugees, captured SS spies, and our own internal agents.\n\n2. This has occurred due to Reichsführer-SS HEINRICH HIMMLER losing control of the native SS Legions, specifically SS-CHARLEMAGNE and SS-WALLOON. Himmler has devoted the majority of his forces to pacifying the rebellious legions, while steadily losing control of his cities which are facing additional insurrections and riots facilitated by the decentralized French resistance.\n\n3. We have high confidence that Nanzig has lost control of a significant number of nuclear facilities and warheads, though likely retain access to a small number. It is almost certain they lack the capability to directly strike Germania due to the ongoing insurrection, and facilities and warheads falling under resistance or Legion control.\n\n4. For these reasons it is RECOMMENDED that Germany begin preparations for an immediate intervention to preclude a full state collapse of the Ordensstaat and reduce the chance for cross-border instability. We estimate that the necessary preparations would take no longer than ninety days and when concluded, neither Himmler's forces or the SS Legions would be capable of successfully defending against an intervention.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."

While [FRA.GetNameDef] is not participating in this decision, it is necessary to consider the political impacts and opportunities of redrawing borders.\n\nThe most simple solution is a full restoration of French borders, either to [FRA.GetNameDef], under conditions dictated by the Reich, or a Paktkommission in the case of a non-compliant France. There would be pieces of Burgundy, namely the Dutch speaking region of Flanders which would also be returned to the Netherlands under this proposal. This would almost certainly be viewed positively by the international community, and ensure the support of France and the Dutch for the Reich.\n\nThe alternative is returning only a majority of the lands to the French, while the remainder of Burgundian territory will be annexed along the borders finalized in World War II plans that outline the restoration of the historical borders of the Holy Roman Empire. This would bring parts of Burgundy under our direct control, and allow us to reclaim the Germanic peoples' historical fontier - but may be viewed negatively by France and the international community.\n\nThis decision should be made prior to our operation to ensure a swift and smooth transition of authority once the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is under control, and the traitor Himmler dealt with.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"

Burgundy is currently unable to effectively protect itself from the west, and opening an additional front on the south will render any sustainable defense impossible.\n\nIn addition to the military advantages, permitting the French to strike against their greatest enemy in the past decade will ensure the continued loyalty of [FRA.GetNameDef] to Germany for the immediate future. It is unlikely that we would be able to effectively manage the former French State lands due to existing resistance organizations and the devastation of SS policies, which will limit border instability as a result.\n\nUpon the direction of the Führer, we will begin coordinations with [FRA.GetNameDef] to accomplish this.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS"

While the situation remains fluid, a CIA analysis indicates that Burgundy has limited to no control of its nuclear arsenal, and will be incapable of utilizing them in a military intervention.\n\nWhile publicly aligned, Himmler quietly broke ties with Germany in the German Civil War, and considers the German Reich as insufficiently devoted to National Socialism and has almost certainly conducted operations against them. Germany views Himmler as a traitor, and has similarly pursued measures short of open conflict due to the nuclear capabilities of Burgundy.\n\nIn response to the ongoing conflict in Burgundy, German forces are mobilizing ground forces along the German-Burgundian border, indicating preparations for a direct military intervention. [FRA.GetNameDefCap] has also begun positioning their forces on the French-Burgundian border, and have formally requested military assistance in retaking the territory illegally annexed by Burgundy, as well as supporting the Red Poppy Resistance.\n\nThis opportunity should not be understated.

The air was tense, even after the agreement. She could see the Germans fortifying their positions in the distance, and wanted to move somewhere safer - but the people needed to see this.\n\nAt a signal from her cameraman, she began. "I am speaking from the city of Paris, just recently liberated from the SS State of Burgundy, formerly under the control of Heinrich Himmler. French and American forces have nominally secured the city, and France's former lands have been reclaimed."\n\nShe cleared her throat.

Paris was supposedly safe, but with soldiers patrolling everywhere, it remained to be seen if the truce with the Americans would hold.\n\nIt worried him. He saw the American lines, the helicopters, artillery, tanks, and convoys. This was more than just assisting an ally - this was a message. A show of force to their greatest rival. Most would say it was a threat.\n\nThe Americans knew exactly what they were doing when they'd also decided to intervene. By the time Germania had learned of the Americans intervention, German soldiers were already engaged against Burgundy. It would have been risky and pointless to reorient themselves towards the Americans.\n\nThere was a tenuous peace established when the Ordensstaat lay destroyed, but everyone knew what this could lead to. The Americans were betting that Germany would be unwilling to start a war over the aftermath - and they were probably right. He couldn't see Germany risking a war over the old French lands, but if they wanted more...\n\nHe wasn't sure how far the Americans would push. The Americans were an impure and degenerate people - but no sane man wanted a war between nuclear powers. "Sir!" An aide rushed towards him, a letter in hand.

 BRG_ai_collapse.7.desc:0 "DEPARTMENT OF STATE | URGENT REPORT\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Following the establishment of respective lines of control, we have received a request from the Senior Negotiator of the Auswärtiges Amt who is currently in Paris, requesting talks to facilitate a formal agreement to deescalate and reduce tensions along the French-German border.\n\nGermany's seeming desire for deescalation implies that they would be receptive to a permanent solution if one was offered, one which includes the recognition of the sovereign French lands, in return for recognizing their claims derived from the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. Germany is likely to strongly oppose sharing a border with an OFN member, even if they convert the former Burgundian territory they control into a buffer state. They will almost certainly demand assurances that OFN forces not enter France, which they know we will not agree to.\n\nA proposed compromise is a total demilitarization of the French-Burgundian border. We have moderate confidence in this prediction because Germany is primarily driven by protecting their sovereign territory, and this removes the potential for OFN forces on their western border. France has indicated their acceptance of this compromise.\n\nThe alternative is that we refuse the offer and maintain our forces along the shared border. It is unlikely that Germany is willing to start a war due to these actions, but this decision would significantly increase tensions and lead to accidents that could snowball out of control.\n\nDirection from the President is required to proceed."

Initial proposals such as the withdrawal of all American forces or joint French-German management of the former Burgundian territories were rejected and the first round of talks ended. The second round of talks has since been initiated.\n\n2. We made our demands to the American negotiators clear - Germany would not allow for the possibility of France to share a border with the Reich. America similarly indicated that they would accept no agreement which prevented OFN - specifically American - forces from moving through [FRA.GetNameDef].\n\n3. The United States returned for the second round of negotiations with a proposal that would completely demilitarize the French-Burgundian border. There would be no exceptions to this proposal, even the French, who have signaled their support for this proposal.The United States views this as a compromise, arguing that each of our demands is fulfilled.\n\n4. The United States has maintained that they wish to reduce tensions, but will not do so without a guarantee of freedom of movement and French sovereignty. In the event that this proposal is refused, it is unlikely that the United States would enter into an open conflict, but it would significantly increase tensions, and escalate the chance of an accidental escalation.

I'm expecting they'll do the same."\n\nThe air was still as they processed the implications. Anderson hadn't actually thought they'd ever be in this situation; on the brink of another conflict. One of the officers finally spoke:0 "Will there be war?"\n\n"God willing, no," Harper shook his head. "The Germans don't want war, neither do we - but the brass is preparing all the same. We're being put on the highest alert, and have orders to evacuate the remaining civilians. If things go bad..." he trailed off.\n\nThe pause only lasted a moment, as his voice hardened and he looked each of them in the eye. "Do not engage the Germans. You only have permission to engage if they're launching a coordinated attack. I don't want to start a world war because some idiot German private accidentally fired his weapon and we were overzealous in response. Is that understood?"\n\n"Yes sir!" They barked.

There were only so many ways it could end. They'd have to hold another round of talks, they'd say they had an agreement - or the talks would end altogether.\n\nThe doors opened and the American and German diplomats walked out.\n\nCameras flashed and every camera turned on them as the leading negotiators approached the podium that had been set up. The American negotiator spoke first. "The United States has come to an agreement with the Greater German Reich. They have agreed to recognize the return of French lands."\n\nAt this, the French media and the soldiers - with no shortage of Americans, cheered, with some of the soldiers hugging each other. The American diplomat allowed a small smile before continuing. "The United States also recognizes the German claims of the Burgundian lands that were previously the territory of the Holy Roman Empire."\n\nThat news was received less enthusiastically, but considering the alternative, people were happy enough with it. "We have agreed that the border between [FRA.GetNameDef] and the German Reich will be fully demilitarized," the negotiator continued.

SUMMARY: German forces have seized control of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, and confirmed the final surrender or annihilation of hostile SS or Resistance forces. While the former Reichsführer-SS HEINRICH HIMMLER attempted to slow our advance and activate nuclear contingencies, we were able to secure all critical nuclear and civilian infrastructure, thwarting his last desperate efforts.\n\n2.

A significant majority have clear marks of physical abuse, are malnourished and suffering psychological issues. The majority of the civilian population are not properly adhering to established curfews and restrictions. The current population views us with growing suspicion, and their initial charitable perception of us is rapidly deteriorating.\n\n4. Our operations have also shifted to counter-insurgency as the French resistance movement has gained significant strength with the Ordensstaat's collapse and continued their own violent insurgency. In addition to an immediate influx of supplies and food to stabilize the population, we will require dedicated anti-insurgency teams to use if we wish to maintain a long-term presence.

SUMMARY: Since the successful capture of the former SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, the situation has continued to remain highly volatile, and there are a number of indicators that signal increased volatility or violence if not immediately addressed.\n\n2. There has been little success in halting the continued insurgency of the French Resistance, which is known as the RED POPPY. They have continued to employ violence, and have strong support within the French community who actively shelter, support, and assist them. We currently lack the manpower or local support to effectively counter their operations.\n\n3. The population has continued to grow hostile to our presence. While they consider us better than the Ordensstaat, they are increasingly unwilling to accept long-term German occupation. Multiple riots have broken out in major cities, and we have identified cells of insurgents in all major cities who are supported and supplied by the Red Poppy.\n\n4. We judge that attempting to occupy these lands long-term is unsustainable without significant investment. We propose an alternative solution, which is to return the former French lands to [FRA.GetNameDef] in exchange for officially rejoining the Einheitspakt.

Despite this military victory, clandestine and press reports have implied that Germany is facing difficulties with the local population and native resistance movements. Germania appears unwilling to provide additional manpower and resources to occupy the lands, which has likely driven their outreach to us.\n\nGerman representatives have officially reached out to us to make a deal. They are willing to return the illegally annexed French lands, though will retain control over the former Burgundian lands that fell within the borders of the Holy Roman Empire. In return, they have demanded that we formally rejoin the Einheitspakt.\n\nIt is almost certain that Germany has judged it is in their interests to cede territory that is currently experiencing unrest, famine, and resistance for us to manage instead of them. While we would regain our rightful lands, we will also be inheriting a damaged state with our own limited resources.\n\nWe are uncertain we would be able to successfully negotiate with the French Resistance if we join the Einheitspakt, as they may view us as collaborators. There is a strong risk that joining the Einheitspakt would delegitimize us in the eyes of a population which wants nothing to do with Germany.\n\nIt is unlikely that Germany is willing to invest the necessary resources in the land, and that the unrest and resistance will continue to worsen. Because of this, the situation may become unsustainable and they may return later and remove the demand to join the Einheitspakt. While this is not certain, if we wish to retain a measure of autonomy, it may be in our interest to reject this deal. This decision must ultimately rest with the President."

That French government officials walked together with German counterparts, and escorted by both German and French soldiers was perhaps an odd sight, but considering the context, everyone could accept it. To most, it didn't ultimately matter how it had happened - what mattered was that France was reunited, and they could begin healing from the trauma Burgundy had inflicted.\n\nThere were speeches given by the French officials celebrating the return to their home. They thanked the Germans for what they had done, and formally announced their intention to rejoin the Einheitspakt which was received with moderate applause. Few among the citizens cared about the implications of the decision, at least not in this moment of revelry.\n\nStill, there were others who thoughtfully observed as the celebrations stretched into the night. Ones who pondered what would happen now that France was subsumed under the political and economic dominance of the German Reich. Perhaps such had been inevitable, and there would be many debates in the coming days if such a decision had been correct - but those were for a later time.\n\nThat night was the night of return - and tomorrow everyone would turn their minds to the arduous task of rebuilding the nation to her former glory. It would be long, difficult, and painful - but each Frenchman was prepared and committed to the mission.

The condition to join the Pakt was too much, it appears."\n\nThiel took the letter, now more baffled than anything else, and he dismissed the aide with a wave of his hand. That had not been the response he'd expected. Hell, it was commonly believed in diplomatic circles that the French were going to rejoin the Pakt, it was just a matter of time. This was a golden opportunity for France, and they had just... refused. That struck him as utterly bizarre.\n\nNonetheless, the letter made it very clear what it was really about. They had correctly assessed that Germany was trying to pass the volatile French lands to them, as well as trying to bring France firmly into their political and economic sphere. A lesser issue was that they seemed to think that Germany had no right to hold their lands at all, and should return it - no strings attached.\n\nSavvy. They were hedging their bets to some degree - which was rather bold of them. Unfortunately for them, there were contingencies. France taking back the lands was the easiest solution, but it was by no means their only one.\n\nIt seemed they were going to have to do this the hard way, whether Germania wanted it or not. Setting up a new government wasn't going to be an easy task, but at this point, it seemed they didn't have any other options. However, if the French wanted to call their bluff... well, he would oblige them."

Having taken a tour of one of them himself, he would not look at the SS or a camp the same way again.\n\nHe shook his head. Freeing the people from the camps was one thing, figuring out what to do with them was another. Much of the land had belonged to France proper, but simply returning it to them was impossible since the French had made the very foolish choice of aligning with Italy.\n\nAn Italian puppet on their western border was unacceptable to Germania.\n\nSo Germany had all of this land, with a population that - while grateful for being liberated - was not going to be exactly tolerant with prolonged German control over them - and Germany didn't have the manpower, willingness or resources to sustain an occupation indefinitely. Already the Resistance that had plagued the Ordensstaat was turning their ire towards Germany.\n\nNegotiations were taking place to find French and Belgium collaborators who would be willing to manage the new states, which the people would hopefully be more willing to accept. Considering that they had lived under Himmler, Lasse had a feeling that just being governed by one of their countrymen was already an improvement.\n\nThe decisions were likely to come soon.

What was not good was that they now had to manage all of the former Burgundian lands, deal with a starved and battered population, a thoroughly ruined industry and a stripped land.\n\nGermany simply did not have the resources to properly manage all of this. They had their own problems and citizens. Not to mention that while the people were glad the Ordensstaat destroyed, they were not going to accept another German occupation so soon, and the Resistance that had plagued Himmler was still out there.\n\nIdeally, [FRA.GetNameDef] would have taken over their former lands. Unfortunately, ever since [FRA.GetNameDef] had collapsed, they were not in a position to assist. Leaving the former Burgundian lands unattended was out of the question, so it fell to the Reich to clean up the mess.\n\nSpecifically, it fell to him.\n\nHeusinger sighed as he thought of the enormity of the task before him. Overseeing the Pakt Mandate of France was going to be a challenge, even with the eventual goal of turning it over to a reliable French collaborator in the future. Yes, that might be the approach to take to placate the population. This was only a temporary measure; just until the right person could be found.\n\nHe sat up straight in his chair, and spent the rest of the evening poring over after-action reports and details of potential collaborators. There was a lot of work to do, and he found some irony in the fact that even though Himmler was dead, his legacy would drain them for years to come."

They weren't exactly politically aligned with the government after all. But they were all French, and in the end, that was what mattered.
