 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_SUBHAS_CHANDRA_BOSE_DESC: "It seemed that societal fate would have had Subhas Chandra Bose, born into the family of a loyal servant of the Raj, work as one of those innumerable 'natives' without whom the British could not control the subcontinent. Instead, on the cusp of a successful entry into the prestigious Indian Civil Service, he threw it all away for the sake of serving a greater goal - his motherland, the much beleaguered Indian nation.\n\nAs one of several young, dynamic, and left-leaning voices within Congress that urged faster and more radical action, and despite being elected both to govern Calcutta and to Congress' highest offices, Bose soon found himself at odds with the party's slow and legalistic leadership. When the War broke out, concerned about his potential to disrupt the Raj, the British imprisoned him at home - only for him to escape in a scene straight out of a movie, hiding and disguising himself until he reached Afghanistan, where, with German aid, he reached the Soviet Union. Finding the European powers unwilling to help, he finally turned to Japan for aid, organizing an army of Indian prisoners-of-war and proclaiming that he would march to Delhi. Almost concurrently, the Raj itself collapsed.\n\nInvited to form a united government, Bose happily accepted - only to be blamed for the failings of the war against Afghanistan and nearly imprisoned again. But Bengal and the East were now loyal to the Forward Bloc, not Congress, and he escaped once more. Now he waits, determined to march to Delhi once more whether in peace, or by war. The hour that will decide the fate of all India is soon at hand - and he will be the one to guide it there."
 POLITICS_MOHAN_SINGH_DESC: "Mohan Singh was born in humble circumstances. A Sikh whose father died before he was even born, he struggled but succeeded in earning a place in the army and worked his way through the ranks of the military of an empire he despised. One of the very first to abandon the Raj and join the Japanese, he believed that Tokyo was the glowing light of anti-imperialism in Asia. He was second only to the Netaji himself in his absolute dedication to Indian liberation, and first in loyalty to the Empire of the Rising Sun. Even as his benefactors were forced to sign a ceasefire and leave India divided, his faith in Japan remained strong.\n\nSingh is a traditionalist, and to him the status quo is the only path forwards. He will hold the course set by Bose, even if Bose himself desires a new way. However, Singh has grown tired of this isolation in Bengal. Each day, his dream of a free and united India seems further away. The Bengali nationalists within his own country threaten to undo the pan-Indian dream that the Azad Hind government was built upon, and he will not tolerate it. He will no longer sit idle, letting the country rot like his once-beloved Netaji did. Singh, uniting party and army, will put down those who threaten his nation, his dream. When he is done, India will be united and powerful, and any who challenge it will face the consequences."
 POLITICS_LAKSHMI_SAHGAL_DESC: "Lakshmi Sahgal first became famous across India during the Second War of Independence. Joining the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, Sahgal quickly rose through the ranks, becoming their commander. As the war continued, Sahgal commanded her unit with pride. After the war ended, many assumed that Sahgal's career would end. However, it was only beginning.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Sahgal and her husband, Prem, saw the Azad Hind's economic slump as detrimental to their military careers, and pursued the best alternative: to fight as mercenaries. Over time, many generals in the Azad Hind, also running short on pay, followed Sahgal's example. By the time the economy recovered, Free India found the majority of its military as mercenaries. Providing an opportunity to cut corners and save money on the budget, Bose was more than happy to accept these private military contractors.\n\nAs the 1960s opened with a diagnosis of Bose's tumour, Sahgal found an opportunity in politics as the Netaji deposed his former vice, General Singh. Commander Sahgal, a household name and already a high-ranking minister, was appointed as Bose's deputy after little wait. With such a prestigious position, Sahgal saw that the time was right to get into politics. Espousing a rather jingoistic form of democratic socialism, she quickly began to appeal to both the moderate crowds of the country and pro-military sects of society.\n\nBut now, Sahgal is in control. Denouncing the Sphere, the Pakt, and the OFN all the same, and promoting the belief of India as a superpower, she has earned support from the more nationalist groups. And, willing to negotiate with Rahman, she has earned the trust of the minorities, too. But, with Singh and the INA scheming, can she succeed in her reforms?"

 ### Ideas ###
 AZH_Hindustan_Land_Development_Authority: "Hindustan Land Development Authority"
 AZH_Hindustan_Land_Development_Authority_desc: "With the stated goal of resettling landless peasants and improving agricultural productivity, HILDA's operations in the Northeast of the country have brought mixed results. While the redistribution of land has significantly alleviated tenancy concerns in overpopulated Bengal and created a new source of government revenue, it has also caused an increase in secessionist and local nationalist sentiment in the areas with the most planned settlements."
 AZH_The_Language_Problem: "The Language Problem"
 AZH_The_Language_Problem_desc: "The government and Party are led overwhelmingly by either ethnic Bengalis, or expatriate Tamils from the communities in Malaya and Burma that formed the core of the movement. This, along with Bose's desire to Romanize and standardize Hindustani as the official government language, causes tension in both Bengal and the Hindi-speaking parts of the country."
 AZH_What_Is_Subhasism: "What is Subhasism?"
 AZH_What_Is_Subhasism_desc: "Socialism, nationalism, bolshevism, fascism - the officially espoused ideology of the Azad Hind has been called many things, but even the most ardent Party member would be hard pressed to pin down the precise position of the government and people. This ideological flexibility is useful perhaps only in negotiations with other countries (and certain insurgent groups), but sooner or later a decision must be reached and Bose's vision must be laid down in concrete terms. As to the form this will take, it's anyone's guess."
