 THENEWORDER_NAME: "The New Order"
 THENEWORDER_DESC: "With the triumph of the Axis over the Allied powers, a New Order has descended upon the world. In the places of Union Jack and the Hammer and Sickle now soar the Rising Sun and Swastika. A single light flickers desperately against the night in the United States; Germany celebrates the first man on the moon as Europe chafes; and Japan lines its pockets as China's slumber slowly breaks. The Mediterranean lies on a knife's edge, and what remains of Russia prepares to realize its destiny."

Fifty years ago, the people rejected Heaven itself and proclaimed their allegiance to the cause of the revolutionaries, leaving the monarchy abolished, the family that had led a revolution falling victim to the virtues of their ancestors.\n\nTwenty years passed since then.

The War came and went, propelling the Empire of Manchuria to economic prominence. Then flames and steel again descended unto street level in the riots of 50s, followed by the disastrous intervention into Outer Manchuria. All of these broke the back of the quadrilateral political consensus among the elites, the bureaucracy, the army, and the corporations, In the searing aftermath, Japan brokered a compromise. A standstill, a stagnation befell the nation, the price of quiet.\n\nIt is 1962. Economic growth is at an all-time low. The underworld is restive. The people are unhappy, apathetic.

Crushed under the Nazi jackboot, Poland soon became the staging ground for some of the greatest atrocities ever recorded. Inconspicuous Polish fields became sites of huge death camps, vacuuming up Jews and Poles and leaving devastation in their wake. Poles were starved, beaten and worked to death to serve the German war effort.\n\nThen, after it was all over, all the remaining Poles were crammed into the Generalgouvernement, a cruel and stunted mockery of their old nation. As German colonists poured across the Weichsel, the Poles settled down into an existence of servitude under the watchful eye of Hans Frank. As a symbol of Poland's place in this new world order, the proud city of Warsaw was slowly bulldozed. For all the world knew, Poland was no more - another victim of Nazi brutality.\n\nIn 1962, though, there are stirrings in this battered nation. Hans Frank's once hawkish eye wanders towards securing his own legacy, and the Nazi apparatus in both Germany and the East is descending into factionalism and infighting. As the Germans squabble, the Polish partisans reassert themselves. The famed Home Army, never destroyed despite the Germans' best efforts, eats away at the legitimacy of the German state in the shadows.

But what was meant to be a sinecure became a staging ground. The land of the nascent SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is clay in Himmler's hands, free for him to mold as he sees fit. And with his plans growing more audacious and destructive by the day, the "Shadow State" will soon play host to greater and greater dangers to the Reich, Europe, and eventually the world."
 GER_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Once humbled by their failures in the Weltkrieg, Germany once more rose to prominence with the leadership of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Thanks to the failures of the Allies, WW2 has ended in complete German victory.\n\nGermany now presides over the most powerful Empire on Earth, but despite her victory, Germany's control remains tenuous at best. Wracked by an economic crash that has frozen the nation for a decade, and with a massive slave caste providing for the German people, the population has began to protest. The nation is now trapped in a series of student protests and the machinations of the Deutsche Bank."
 CZE_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Bohemia should have been part of the Reich by now, but not all things are meant to be.\n\nWhile the protectorate was well on its way towards integration in the 50s, the rapid deterioration of the Reich's power soon put all of these plans on hold.\n\nDespite this, Bohemia ran as normal, before oddly enough the resistance seemed to reappear. Once small cells apparently doubled and tripled in size almost overnight, and the garrison now struggles to hold the line. One can only wonder who would possibly raise so much trouble behind the shadows."
 CRN_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The brave sons of Germany watch eternal. Their charge? All of England for the security of the Fatherland. Only the finest soldiers can find posting in the Cornwall Governorate, the center of operations for the entirety of the garrison of occupied England. Having been proven right in Halder's insistence that the English would never peacefully aid in Germany's unification of Europe after their unsuccessful rebellion in the 50s, the garrison now stands on the alert at all times, prepared to do battle for the prosperity of the Pakt.\n\nWords muttered under quiet breaths speak of Germany facing its twilight, and if such a time would come, the Garrison must be ready to do whatever it must do for the homeland. The isles will be secure!"
 ANG_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The pilots of Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika rule the skies even while Africa remains locked in chaos. From the airstrips of Angola, hundreds of German bombers filter in and out en-route to bomb West Africa into the dust. From his squadron headquarters, Reichskommissar Schenck rules, treating the natives with a light hand and his duties even more lightly, many have criticized his hands off attitude and apparent disregard to actually rule the nation.\n\nTo Schenck, however, only the skies can provide him solace from the hell that he had a hand in creating, and some whisper that the Reichskommissar is not entirely loyal to the Reich, but from all reports, Schenck remains as loyal as he has ever been, a model hero of German aviation."
 GRO_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Some say that each Reichskommissariat is but a mirror of its ruler. Indeed, Ostafrika is very similar to Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig: both are dry, pitiless and utterly devoid of humanity.\nUnder the watchful eye of their Aryan masters, the inferiors toil, their blood, their tears and their deaths nothing but the perfect fuel for the Reich. Even the watchers, however, are under scrutiny: Hüttig despises incompetence and pity, and will crush anyone displaying said defects. What awaits his enemies is a lifetime of suffering, where even death is a luxury.\nIn a world of degenerates and traitors, Hans Hüttig will uphold the Aryan standard, no matter the odds, no matter the means, no matter the price."
 COG_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Covered by a lush jungle and filled with wildlife that would make all hunters weep in joy, the former Belgian Congo is the richest of all the German colonies. Under the perfect façade, however, lies a dangerous world, far more dangerous than any safari may be.\nReichskommissar Siegfried Müller spends his days hunting, neglecting the administration, and the entire colony has been turned into a private business for the many corporations, both German and foreign, lusting after Zentralafrika's resources.\nHowever, despite being a seasoned hunter, Müller might find himself prey to far larger predators: there are dangers lurking in the jungles, and sometimes, ink and paper can cause more slaughter and suffering than any set of fangs."
 CAU_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Reichskommissariat Kaukasien was originally meant to be a "model colony" of sorts, one where the natives would live peacefully under the Reich's watchful eye. The natives, of course, had different ideas. When the West Russian War broke out, the "Transcaucasian Soviet" launched a mass rebellion, besieging the capital of Tiflis and almost linking up with the Red Army. They were defeated, but it was clear that a firmer hand was needed. Enter Josias, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. He was renowned for his methodical efficiency, but after being captured and tortured by Transcaucasian partisans, he also became known for his methodical extermination of rebels. The Reich doesn't bother him as long as the oil flows, but they fail to notice that his loyalties may lie elsewhere..."
 IRE_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Ireland's entry into the Second World War ensured its territorial unification, but it came at a cost.\n\nThroughout the 1950's, Ireland attached itself ever closer to the seemingly prosperous German Reich, adopting its military as a model, and its companies as sources of revenue. This close attachment has meant that Ireland went down with the sinking ship that was the German economy. While extremism on both sides of the isle rose since the crash, Éamon de Valera's successor, Seán Lemass, took the necessary steps to protect Irish democracy and independence, at the great expense of individual freedoms.\n\nMeanwhile, Ireland's northern counties, ruled by Neil Blaney, appear more unstable by the day, and its mismanagement could well prove the final nail in democracy's coffin."
 NOR_THENEWORDER_DESC: "As Reichskommissariat Moskowien is the jewel of the east, Reichskommissariat Norwegen is the gem of the west, and one which the SS and NSDAP saw as nothing less than the birthplace of the Aryan race; the invaluable addition to the German racial stock that knew no bounds in wealth, or resources.\n\nThroughout the early 1950's onwards, the SS established Norway as a paradise for the Aryan race, with Reichskommissar Josef Terboven finding himself in the company of none other than Josef Goebbels and Hans Hüttig, leading the colony headfirst into a policy of perpetuating the Aryan farmer-warrior. As time passed, it seemed as though Reichskommissar Terboven would be the first to fully Germanize a slice of the Reich. Such was never meant to be, however. The first strike to Terboven's destiny was from that of Himmler himself, pulling strings to send Hans Hüttig to Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, depriving Terboven of his most able SS ally. Then Goebbels, a close ally now beyond comparison, was murdered in the wilderness of Reichskommissariat Moskowien. The final nail in the coffin for Terboven's ambitions came in the shape of Heydrich Himmler's attempted coup, forcing all of the SS away from the stage of German politics.\n\nAs the dust settled from the purges of the SS, Terboven was horrified to find his position solidifying as one of isolation from ideological guidance or any substantial allies to speak of. Now, with political turmoil polarizing German society, and the Norwegian civilian populace growing rebellious, there seems to be little which can be done for Reichskommissariat Norwegen."
 WAL_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The Republic of Wales' existence was not brought about due to a revival of Welsh nationalist sentiment in the region as the British Isles fell to the German jackboot. Quite the opposite, in fact: it was a puppet sliced off of the former United Kingdom to cripple England, and that fact looms large over it to this day. What prosperity it has is predicated upon its coal mines, and in the meantime the country struggles with the incessant conflict between nationalists and unionists that has marked it from day one of its existence. Time will tell what happens and who wins out."
 UKR_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Ostland may strut itself as the "Crown Jewel", Moskowien as the problem child and Poland as the Reich's laboratory, but it is Ukraine that keeps Germany alive. Without its vital source of wheat and grain to the hundred million souls inside the Empire, all of the blood spilt during the Second World War would be for naught.\n\nCrimea, occupying the vital position as the protector of the Black Sea, has been formally incorporated into the Reich, with the rest of the region under an occupation government, simply known as "Reichskommissariat Ukraine". Ruled under an iron fist by its Reichskommissar, Erich Koch, anyone suspected of even holding sympathies with the kaleidoscope of partisan movements that haunt the Germans is dealt with, in the only way Koch knows how. A bullet. Yet, in the darkness, something lurks. In the heart of every Ukrainian and every German, the wind has shifted.\n\nHell will descend over the wheatfields of Ukraine. Whoever survives, wins."

 JAP_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The sun never sets on the Japanese Empire, or at least it hasn't yet. Reigning over the single largest population of any nation on Earth, the Japanese maintain the largest military, industrial base, and navy in the world. With treaty ports in America and ownership of the Pacific, Japan has gone from a shut in nation behind the Europeans to the masters of the sea and land. All is not well, however, as the increasingly byzantine Imperial Court constantly undermines the monarchy, and the more Japan uses China's resources, the more their grip on the colonies slip."
 CHI_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The hopefuls who lit the fuse against the Qing in Wuhan would die with the Republic just 30 years later as it was snuffed out by the Japanese in Chongqing. The new republican government over China claims to be the legitimate successor to the KMT's Republic but all up and down society know that this is not true. In reality, the ROC of 1962 is a virtual colony of the Japanese, serving to put food on Japanese tables and resources for exploitation. But there are some still who see light where others don't, who see the potential in this situation. China has known only peace and stability since the War of Resistance and Japanese investments have kickstarted the Chinese economy. Perhaps this, paired with Gao Zongwu's planned Five Modernizations program, could propel China beyond being a mere subservient."
 GNG_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Carved out of the Republic of China as a concession to the Zaibatsu at the end of the Greater East Asian War, the State of Guangdong is an experiment in corporate colonialism, an unnatural entity existing between its Chinese roots and its Japanese suzerain. Despite its independence, Guangdong is far beneath Japan, China, or even Manchukuo in status - its Chief Executive playing second fiddle to the rest of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, even as the Four Companies of Guangdong greedily exploit Guangdong's land and people for their own benefit.\n\nGuangdong is a country without a nation: a society bound together by wire transfers, banknotes, and share certificates. In the glittering Three Pearls of Guangdong - Honkon, Makao, and Kōshu - the Four Companies and the Chief Executive indulge in boardroom politics as the Japanese expatriates lord over the Cantonese-Japanese Zhujin, who struggle for recognition as second-class citizens. Beneath them all, the Chinese are herded from their ancestral towns into the electronics sweatshops on the Pearl River, a people displaced inside their own homeland. And as Asia awakens, few ask: will Guangdong survive the storm to come?"
 YUN_THENEWORDER_DESC: "In the aftermath of the collapse of the Chinese United Front, the former ruler of Yunnan handed the reins to Lu Han, who immediately began to go through the motions of modernizing it, whether by hook or by crook. But this came at a terrible cost. Corruption and societal ills have spread like the plague; dissension and misery have engulfed the country. Due to all this, the province, though experiencing an economic boom, is also becoming a hotbed of anti-Japanese sentiment. Lu Han goes on in blissful unawareness of the situation, continuing with Gao's plans for his region, but there are others in Kunming and elsewhere who might take advantage of the chaos behind the scenes to take Yunnan down a path no-one had expected..."
 GUZ_THENEWORDER_DESC: "As with so many other provinces in the new China, Guizhou had been overrun by the Japanese forces and handed over to Chinese administration. He Yingqin soon found that his only 'army' was little more than an extension of Yunnan's clique of officers. During the 1950's He chose to focus on domestic development and building up the people's confidence in government once again. At every turn however he confronted with monopolists, Yunnan officers and the peoples own memory of the KMT's many failures. By 1960 it seemed He had turned reclusive, seemingly overcome by the many failures both of himself and the KMT he had loved. However, in meetings behind closed doors and in He Yingqin's personal audience a bold reform plan has been developed. Perhaps there is still hope for democracy in China after all..."
 SIC_THENEWORDER_DESC: "In the war against Japan few bleed and died as Sichuan did. Countless young men were drafted in China's defense, and the province rallied to Chiang-Kai-Shek and the republican banner. It was all for naught. By 1947 the Imperial Japanese Army had crushed their province, devastating both the land and the people. Finally, in 1949 it ceased to be under military administration and was handed over to Tian Songyao. Over the past decade the ruined province has slowly been rebuilt, and its devastated population has gradually recovered. Now Tian Songyao can finally begin the development and improvement of his native land and paint over the scars of war. But this time, it will be a Sichuan for the Sichuanese. He will not easily see his people slaughtered by Nanjing's command again."
 TIB_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The isolated mountain kingdom of Tibet has, despite being internationally recognised by all but a few sympathetic states as part of China, found itself isolated from the affairs of the Co-Prosperity Sphere other than occasional diplomacy from both its allies and Japan, who, despite its lack of recognition for Tibet, maintains de facto relations with the nation. Tibet is very much stuck in the past, being a theocratic absolute monarchy led by the young Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. However, with China just over the border, it surely cannot be long until Beijing retakes Lhasa."
 AZH_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The Azad Hind is a nation born of unfortunate circumstances. Originally founded with the purpose of liberating India with the help of Japan, things quickly turned sour as Britain fell and could no longer exert its grip over the subcontinent. Rather than joining us as their one government, the people of India formed their own nation. Now, Indians were fighting their own brethren rather than the oppressors, and the war went from a hopeful revolution to a cruel conflict where brother took up arms against brother. Eventually a ceasefire was reached, and the two Indias retreated to establish themselves as nations. Bose, however, has not forgotten his dream of a free and united India, and, as darkness looms, he may soon get his chance."

 ITA_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Italy's recent history is one strung with an impressive sequence of victories and defeats. The minor partner in the European Axis, Italy entered the war playing second fiddle to Germany and performing disastrously in the Balkans - only to win an incredible victory in Egypt. Italy soon found itself ruling over an overstretched empire and a divided nation, the country only managing to counterbalance those strains with its newly acquired oil reserves. Under the guidance of Ciano, fascism seems to be fading away, but even that could be an illusion. Furthermore, many in the country fear that Italy may fall from the ranks of the world powers just as quickly as it rose."
 IEA_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Italian East Africa wasn't the first conquest of the Italian Empire, but surely it is its proudest one. From the great heights of the Ethiopian mountains to the palm tree lined shores of Somalia, East Africa is home to endless fields of grain, unfathomable veins of gold and other minerals, loyal and hard-working natives, and just and honorable administrators. At least, that is the image constantly conveyed by Italian media and propaganda. In truth, East Africa is barely functioning despite the decent stewardship of its Viceroy, Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta. Rebels and partisans still haunt the territory's mountains and forests, and despite its vast riches, its economy struggles to develop in a mire of corruption. The crown jewel of the Italian Empire is starting to crack, and many believe that Italy will have to let go of its most precious conquest - either willingly or not..."
 IME_THENEWORDER_DESC: "When the Italian Empire expanded at a breakneck pace during World War Two, few among the fascist leadership stopped to consider the fact that some of the newly conquered territories would have been more trouble than they were worth. In the Levant, Italian rule was constantly marked by fierce resistance by native Arabs, and the plans to counterbalance them with Jewish immigrants backfired as Zionist groups took up arms against Italy as well. Dalla Chiesa, the new young Governor, adopted a new strategy - attempting to negotiate with moderate of both camps, which fostered an uneasy peace between the Italians, Haganah and Fatah. The threat of Turkey looms on the horizon, and it might be the only thing capable of uniting the peoples of the Levant, or to once and for all doom the region to chaos."
 EGY_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Egypt's days as the center of global civilization are long, long over, but King Farouk I knows that to be successful you have to look successful, and what looks more like success than fast cars and cans of caviar? Whether his nation can afford to subsidize his... tastes... in the long term is debatable, but so long as the taxes are paid and the grain shipped, Egypt's Italian masters don't much mind its king's extravagance. Unfortunately, there are many who oppose the king's rule, either in the name of revolutionary fervour or reactionary fanaticism - but both are more than willing to take advantage of a ruler who much prefers cavorting and carriages to actual leadership. When the festivities reach their conclusion and the sun rises on the gilded ruins, will you have the strength and discipline to help Egypt navigate the next decade into true prosperity?"
 IRQ_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Iraq is a curious case among the motley despots and colonialists within the Italian sphere. As the Italian attempt to integrate it as a puppet state of the empire failed miserably after a revolution, Rome was forced to accept Baghdad's autonomy, and Iraq is now one of the few truly democratic states in the Middle East, at least nominally. It operates as an authoritarian democracy, in which every willing political party under the sun is allowed a foot in the government so long as they don't challenge Italian control over the nation's oil, or the political dominance of Abd al-Karim Qasim and the National Democratic Party. But the system is a house of cards, with schemers, conspirators and plotters from every direction threatening Iraq and its leader. If (or when) it all comes tumbling down, who will rise from the ashes?"
 ILG_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The Italian Empire is, for the most part, a scrupulously legal entity. While the Nazis simply take what they want, Italy's lands were obtained honorably, after the surrender of a foe. That is, except for Algeria. It began as a few settlers looking for new homes in what was de-jure part of the crumbling French State - the Empire's wild west, far away from the eye of Rome. When Italy's supposed ally, Iberia, began to expand her influence over the region, it was tribal bribery and armed incursions. Now Italian Algeria is controlled by a tentative military administration, which has grown more and more reliant on a shaky alliance with Algerian natives. Naturally, tensions are high with the Iberians and their allies, the pied-noir militias. As the Triumvirate folds into itself, which empire, if any, will rule Algeria, and how much will be left for them to rule?"
 CRO_THENEWORDER_DESC: "From its inception, the Independent State of Croatia was a farce. An Axis puppet government borne out of World War Two and theoretically a monarchy led by an Italian king, it was practically in the hands of Ante Pavelić and his brutal Ustaše. With the collapse of the Axis and the death of Pavelić, the Italian empire reaffirmed its control over Croatia - ousting the Ustaše and placing the kingdom in the hands of a small cadre of Italian generals and advisors. With partisan activity still rampant in the country and the Ustaše now operating underground, the kingdom appears to be on its last legs - change is coming to the country, for good or for worse..."
 GRE_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The Hellenic State was born in the fires of World War Two, and even in this new age, it still suffers from the same problems it had when Europe was engulfed by conflict. A deeply unpopular and undemocratic government, the recent history of Greece is characterized by a consistent failure to reform or liberalize the country in any way, as the state is kept together only by the heavy presence of Triumvirate garrisons to keep the numerous partisan groups and organizations in check. However, with the Prime Minister's health ailing, a crisis seems to be inevitable - and the cradle of European civilization might soon be engulfed by war once more. Will Greece manage to resurrect from her ashes as a phoenix, or is the country doomed to more decades of darkness?"
 SAU_THENEWORDER_DESC: "From humble beginnings, the house of al-Saud became one of the dominant powers of the entire Arabian peninsula - and when World War Two changed everything, in Arabia everything stayed the same. With meetings and handshakes, the Saudi royalty kept its independence under the wings of the Italian empire - becoming the only nation in the Italian sphere not to host a garrison from Rome, all in exchange for easy access to oil. Thanks to oil deals with Italy, the Saudi house became fabulously rich, and they fully intend to put their wealth to good use. As many in the Arab and Islamic world look to Riyadh as a beacon for Muslim opposition to western imperialism, the Saudis silently bid their time, waiting for the right moment to lead the fight against the Italian oppressors, and to finally achieve their true calling as the leaders of the faithful."
 IBR_THENEWORDER_DESC: "With Germany victorious in the Second World War, many expected Spain to rise alongside it. When Spain refused to bend to the will of Germany however tensions soon began to rise. The Germans finally demanded they bend to their demands to build the Dam of Gibraltar, which the Spanish finally relented to.\n\nThis led to chaos however as the construction of the dam failed, and as Germany confiscated Portugal's Africa colonies and began sabre rattling against their southern neighbors, Portugal and Spain agreed to unification to better hold off German invasion. This invasion never came however, and now the two rest uneasily with one another. As German might fades into the past, so too does this uncomfortable union..."
 ARG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Argentina has changed irretrievably under the influence of Tte. Gral. Juan Perón, the President from 1949 to 1955. Some laud him as a patriot, a working-class hero; others call him a tyrant and fascist. But what is clear to all is that he remains the most controversial and influential politician in the Argentine Nation, even after the 1955 coup that expelled him to Europe and outlawed Peronism. The tenure of the current President Arturo Frondizi has been marked by his attempt to exploit that fact in his favour. \nThe year 1962 begins and Arturo Frondizi's fate is in question. Ricardo Balbín, his former ally and rival from the UCRP, was just elected as vice-president after a snap election. Frondizi's betrayal of his campaign promises in favour of developmentalism, combined with what Peronists perceive as an excessive sluggishness in letting Perón back in, have left him especially vulnerable. It is doubted that UCR-I rule will survive the upcoming legislative election, with Peronist parties legalised for the first time since the '55 coup, and the military threatening to take matters into its own hands if Peronists win too much influence. And in the meantime, the man the Establishment calls 'Tyrant' plots his return, while rival political factions, dreaming of restoring futures thrown into question by Peronist rule, scheme to win power by the ballot."

 ORE_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Orenburg and the surrounding areas were spared the chaos brought on by the end of the USSR. Lacking any major industrial centers or natural resources, local villages soon returned to a way of life centered around land, family, church and village. In time Orenburg emerged as a neutral ground where peasants and workers of the region could trade and live in peace. The city, mostly ignored by German bombers, was left free to prosper; peasants began exchanging their crops for tools and supplies, creating a blossoming economy. Soon rumors spread of an oasis of peace, south of the Urals. However, not all is well for the young Workers' State. As threats loom on the horizon, Orenburg will have to react to the onslaught brought on by the foes on the border. How much freedom will Orenburg be forced to give up, in order to survive?"

 URL_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Vorkuta has always been cold and unforgiving, which made it the perfect place to put enemies of the Soviet Union. After the chaos of the German Invasion, however, the gulags which housed those prisoners were abandoned. Due to the influence of Father Janis Mendriks, the guards and their captives put aside their differences and united for survival. They traveled a Long March south before establishing themselves in a network of mountain fortresses. This coalition of military outposts came to be known as the Ural League, and with the Southern Urals being one of the most dangerous places in Russia, the League have become the protectors of the region by default. Now, they face the greatest foes they have ever dealt with since the German invasion. Will the Guard stand strong, or will it crumble and leave the innocents of the region defenseless?"

They found that in Vladimir Romanov, rightful heir to the Russian Empire, who had long dreamed of retaking his shattered homeland.\n\nPermitted to assemble a division of Russian exiles and volunteers, Vladimir was able to participate in the counteroffensive against the Revolutionary Front. Unexpectedly for the Germans, however, when the Revolutionary Front began to collapse and the Wehrmacht's own offensive stalled, Vladimir's did not, advancing to and seizing control of the lands around Vyatka.\n\nEstablishing a pocket of monarchist rule, Tsar Vladimir III now rules as a reluctant autocrat while preparing to retake and restore the rest of the nation, knowing that it will take a strong hand to reunite Russia but hoping that his subjects will eventually have a voice in their government.\n\nThe Imperial state faces many challenges, including bickering generals, rival political cliques, and even questions of his own role and purpose in the government. Very soon the time will arrive when these questions will have to be answered, and the fate of both the Romanovs, and the Russian Empire, decided for all."

It was not until he was sent to die in battle against the Germans that he saw what true strength looked like. He saw mighty Aryan warriors smashing the weak Russians who dared oppose them, demonstrating the superiority of the master race. While the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed around him, Alexey had an epiphany: Aryanism is not physical. It is psychological, and those who are worthy of becoming Übermensch can ascend to join the master race by casting aside their old, inferior cultures. Alexey Dobrovolsky died that day. Gutrum Vagner and the Aryan Brotherhood were born.\n\nMen fleeing from the Red Army flocked to join the brotherhood, drawn by its promises of enlightenment and a new dawn for a stronger Russia. Eventually Vagner's followers grew into the thousands, and the Fyurer declared it was time for the master race to conquer the east once and for all. The Brotherhood stormed into Perm, capturing the city and declaring the birth of a new Reykh. Since then they have expanded to the south and west, enslaving thousands of subhumans and uplifting anyone they find that is worthy of joining the ranks of the Übermensch.

Led by General Vlasov and a collection of turncoat Red Army officers, the ROA was meant to help legitimize German control of RK Moskowien until the Russians could be driven further east or exterminated.\n\nThe West Russian War in the fifties changed all of this. Expanded by the desperate Germans and deployed to delay the resurgent Red Army, the ROA thrived against all odds and soon found itself pushing east. By the war's end, Vlasov and his men controlled a power base beyond the Reich's grasp. Written off as mutinous rabble, the ROA has spent the intervening years waiting.

 #West Siberia
 TYM_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Russia was a land of battling cliques long before the Soviet Union fell to the Germans. In the chaotic days after Lenin's death multiple successors vied for control over the young Union. For a brief moment it appeared as though the crown might pass to Joseph Stalin, but tragedy struck. Stalin met with a mysterious and untimely demise, and his supporters were scattered across the Union, relegated to positions of no importance as Bukharin secured control. One of those men sent to Siberia was Lazar Kaganovich, and he never forgot the teachings of his mentor. When the Union collapsed under the weight of the German invasion, Kaganovich was quick to act. Securing the support of Field Marshal Rokossovsky and Lieutenant-General Karbyshev, he took control of a massive stretch of territory from the Urals to Omsk. Kaganovich proclaimed the West Siberian People's Republic and prepared to retake the Union.\n\nIt was not meant to be. Both of his allies soon distanced themselves from Kaganovich, eventually breaking away entirely. Rokossovsky seized Sverdlovsk and the Republic's northern territories, While Karbyshev's Black League took the city of Omsk and its surroundings. Now Kaganovich is left ruling a fraction of his former territory from the city of Tyumen. Most men in his situation would have given up, but Kaganovich is made of stronger stuff. Soon his armies will march north and south, annihilating the traitors and reclaiming the Republic. Kaganovich is determined to reunite the Soviet Union and avenge himself and his old mentor, the original man of steel."
 
 OMS_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Conceived by Dmitry Karbyshev, an old Red general who went through years of pain and hatred by the hands of Nazi invaders, the Black League of Omsk was originally a secret military society within the Red Army ranks that sought to overturn the incompetent Communist leadership and commit the whole Russian people to the total destruction of the loathed Germans, whatever the cost.\n\nFollowing the failed coup against the Soviet government in Tyumen and the retreat to Omsk, the Black League has become entrenched in its extremist vision and seeks nothing but to bring the harsh vengeance upon all enemies of Russia and ensure that the Motherland will never be threatened again."
 
 SVR_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky and his 3rd Army defended the Soviet Union from the fascist invader until there was no longer a union to defend. Bloodied but not defeated, Rokossovsky withdrew eastward, where he found himself part of the West Siberian People's Republic. However, seeing the corruption, incompetence, and callousness of the Republic's leadership, Rokossovsky quickly became disillusioned, and when the opportunity arose, he broke away and declared a rival military government in Sverdlovsk, seizing much of the Republic's northern territories along with it.\n\nNow, Sverdlovsk stands alone against the approaching storm, the bearer of the shining light of liberty in a land of oppression and death. Rokossovsky, as old as he is, remains steadfast in his desire to reunite the Motherland with the military at the helm, serving the worker and peasant above the bureaucrat, aristocrat, or apparatchik."
 
 #Central Siberia
 TOM_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Even as the USSR burned around them, a collection of idealist Scholars, Artists, Poets, Scientists, and Authors came together in a noble attempt to rise from the ashes. This experiment quickly spread through Central Siberia, and, over time, came to be what is now known as the Central Siberian Republic. Using an unorthodox rotating constitution, rewritten after each election by the ruling party, the Republic was seen by many as a bastion of democratic thought and a revival of the democratic ideals of 1917.\n\nIn the end, ironically, it was the Bolsheviks once more that brought the Founders' dreams of democracy crashing down. Facing invasion from the east, several of the CSR's constituent cities revolted, and now the former bastion of liberty in Russia is ruled by despotic juntas, rampaging anarchists, and repressive bolsheviks. But not all hope is lost - the CSR's government, located in the city of Tomsk under a provisional government led by Boris Pasternak, has survived, and as the year 1962 dawns, the President prepares to restore full democracy to the Republic.\n\nCome then, Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the Symphony that is the Russian People play."
 
 KEM_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The story of the Principality of Kemerovo is the story of one man. Nikolay Krylov served as the Chief of Staff of the 62nd Army during the Great Patriotic War, leading it through some of the largest battles on the eastern front. No matter what Nikolay tried, every major engagement his army took part in ended in disaster. By the time the Union collapsed, the 62nd army had already fallen apart. Krylov and his clique of officers fled east, eventually finding themselves in the newly founded Central Siberian Republic. There he was charged with defeating the Siberian Black Army, who dealt him yet another humiliation on the battlefield. The last straw was when one of his closest lieutenants betrayed him and seized the city of Krasnoyarsk. Unable to cope, Krylov's psyche shattered.\n\nWhen his subordinates next saw their general, he was a changed man. He announced that he had experienced a revelation. He was the heir of Rurik, first Tsar of the Rus, and it was his destiny to reunite Russia. The newly crowned Rurik II quickly drew significant attention as men flocked to his banner, drawn by promises of loot and his unusual ideology. Rurik II is not like the monarchs of old. He has promised to be a Tsar of the Soviets, defending the proletarian revolution as the king of the workers and peasants. He has denounced Christianity and condemned the Romanov dynasty as traitors to the Russian people. No one knows what a Russia reunited by Rurik would look like, least of all himself, but as the Tsar prepares for war the world may soon find out."
 
 SBA_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The Siberian Black Army rose in the bleak days of the Siberian War. As the Central Siberian Republic's authority withered and decayed, the Black Army was created by men like Pyotr Siuda and Ivan Stepanov, formed from Soviet defectors, simple peasants and rogue army officers. The newly formed army managed to repeal the Republic and take the area surrounding the city of Kansk. Forming a 'state' based around the principles of militarized anarchism. Inspired by men such as Nestor Makhno, the Siberian Black Army is a society dedicated to freedom and self defense, the army itself asserting little authority beyond what is needed for self defense and membership is a choice, the people are largely free to do as they please. Even still the Black Army's influence grows more with each passing season and many worry it may soon dominate the communes, creating a military dictatorship in all but name."
 
 NOV_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Centered in and around the largest city in Siberia, the Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay arose out of the fracturing of the Central Siberian Republic. Under the leadership of the so-called 'Siberian Falcon,' the strongman Alexander Pokryshkin, it forms one of the largest and most powerful splinter states in the region.\n\nOne of the primary beneficiaries of Bukharin's Siberian Plan, Novosibirsk itself possesses both an enormous population and an equally impressive industrial base, matched in capacity only by the prodigious agricultural lands of Altay. These dual advantages situate the state well, providing a solid economic base from which to grow.\n\nNot all is well, however. The young Federation faces threatening neighbors, socialist labor agitation, and many decisions regarding the growing influence of elitist groupings within the government - influence strongly opposed by the unofficial 'second man' within the Federation, Vasily Shukshin, the Mayor of Barnaul.\n\nThough none can say for certain whether the Federation will weather the many challenges ahead, all agree that, should it correctly leverage the significant advantages granted by both position and history, it could serve as the nucleus of a powerful - and ever expanding - nation."
 
 PRC_THENEWORDER_DESC: "As units of the Red Army retreated into Tuva and Mongolia under the command of Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky as the Soviet Union collapsed around them, the People's Revolutionary Council was formed jointly by the Red Army remnants and the Mongolian People's Republic out of desperation in order to stave off total collapse.\n\nSince their reluctant exile, however, the PRC has been preoccupied with domestic tensions and lack of organization, staying isolated and uninvolved as a result even during the catastrophic Siberian War, the hope the Russians held of returning home faded more and more as the years passed without any end in sight.\n\nNow, the PRC finds itself at a critical point in its existence: with the Red Army no longer able or willing to remain where they are, the time is fast approaching for them to at last charge forth once more, and take back the homeland from those who have brought it to near ruin."

 #The Far East
 AMR_THENEWORDER_DESC: "As the Soviet Union rose to power thousands upon thousands of Russians fled to wherever they could. For many in the east that was the city of Harbin in Manchuria. Bitter over their defeat in the civil war and looking for any chance at redemption or revenge, these exiles turned to the new fascist movement that was just getting off its feet in Europe. Many of the Russians in Harbin embraced Fascism as the new rival to Communism, none more than Konstantin Rodzaevsky. The young man was a fiery orator and an open supporter of Hitler's ideology of National Socialism, and he quickly ascended the ranks to become the leader of the Russian Fascist party in Harbin.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed the exiles, seeing an opportunity to retake their homeland, were quick to strike. With support from Japan, Rodzaevsky led an invasion of the Russian far east, declaring his intent to reunite the nation and create a new era of Russian national socialism. All seemed to be going well, but Rodzaevsky was betrayed by two competing cliques. The white army officers had always hesitated to embrace fascism, and when they saw the opportunity to break away they took it, pledging their allegiance to a false Tsar in Chita. In Magadan, Mikhail Matkovsky, long a challenger to Rodzaevsky's control of the RFP, declared Rodzaevsky was nothing more than a puppet of the genocidal nazis, and a traitor to the Russian nation. Now Rodzaevsky is left ruling a rump state, biding his time until he can retake what is rightfully his and teach the traitors a lesson they won't forget."
 
 BRY_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Yagoda and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in Irkutsk seem to have learned nothing from the fall of Bukharin's Union. They insist they are the true heirs to Lenin's revolution while the NKVD snuffs out all intra-party criticism. Worse yet, they stifle the local Buryat people's autonomy under a Russo-centric hegemony. After years of Yagoda's tyranny, the various dissidents within his fiefdom have risen up to overthrow him and his Presidium.\n\nThey have rallied around the charismatic young idealist Valery Sablin, a passionate Leninist who has called for true freedom and equality for all the peoples of Russia. Everyone from Bukharinites distressed by growing NKVD control, Buryats who desire autonomy, junior officers and women who seek equality have joined his mutiny. But when Sablin wins - if he wins - he will have to come face to face with pragmatic challenges of governing a state. Will Sablin's Union live up to Lenin's ideals? Or will it backslide into Bukharinist dictatorial pragmatism?"

 IRK_THENEWORDER_DESC: "The Bukharin regime fractured and collapsed when it faced the Nazi onslaught. When Bukharin himself disappeared amidst the chaos, NKVD Director Genrikh Yagoda mobilized his surviving NKVD divisions to evacuate the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet as Eastward as he could. From there, the remains of the Bukharin government attempted to retain control over the Far East, but their grip slowly began to crumble as warlords and bandits rose up to take the land for themselves. Yagoda quickly lost confidence in the Party leadership; he and his NKVD began to take over various State functions, much to the chagrin of the Presidium.\n\nThe legitimate heirs to the Soviet Union are now in a precarious position. The balance of power in the Union is teetering between Yagoda loyalists in the State and the apparatchiks of the Party bureaucracy. As if that isn't enough, a former Soviet commander, Valery Sablin, has risen up against the Irkutsk government across Lake Baikal. Yagoda will have to quash this uprising swiftly if he hopes to one day reclaim the Union."
 
 MAG_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Since the birth of the Russian Fascist Party Mikhail Matkovsky competed with Konstantin Rodzaevsky for control. Rodzaevsky was aggressive and idealistic, and openly supported Hitler's Nazism, while Matkovsky was more subtle and diplomatic, and saw the racial hatred the Nazis held for Russians plainly. The two men often butted heads but worked together for the dream of a Russia free of Bolshevism. When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union that dream suddenly became a reality, as the RFP organized an invasion of the Russian Far East. However, Rodzaevsky's refusal to denounce National Socialism even as the Nazis carried out a genocide against the Russian people was the breaking point for Matkovsky. He knew that Germany would never tolerate a strong Russia, even a fascist one, and Rodzaevsky was only leading the nation towards suicide.\n\nMatkovsky and his supporters took control over the port of Magadan and declared that Rodzaevsky was a traitor to the motherland, and only Matkovsky would be able to reunite Russia under true fascism. Matkovsky's clique has now spent years preparing to strike south and finish Rodzaevsky once and for all. Resources in Magadan are scarce, forcing Matkovsky to turn to unusual sources of help. Mercenaries from all over the world have come to Magadan seeking fame and fortune, but the greatest source of support lies across the Pacific: the United States. Persuading the Americans will be no easy task, but if anyone can do it, it is Matkovsky."

 CHT_THENEWORDER_DESC: "For many of the Russian exiles in Harbin, the rise of the Russian Fascist Party was a godsend. For the officers of the White Army in the city it was a nuisance. They had spent years fighting to restore the Romanov dynasty to their rightful throne, only to see the exile community abandon the monarchy for this distasteful new ideology. The old generals, led by Ataman Semyonov, reluctantly agreed to work with Rodzaevsky and the RFP more out of mutual hatred for the Bolsheviks than anything else. When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union and it became clear Hitler was not waging war against communism, but against the Russian people, the generals were appalled by Rodzaevsky's refusal to denounce Nazism. It was decided that the partnership could not last, but the generals would wait to split until the time was right.\n\nThat time came shortly after Rodzaevsky launched his invasion of the Russian Far East. The White officers invited Prince Michael Romanov to a dinner party in Harbin. Once there they involved him in all of their schemes, declaring that they would crown him as the new Tsar and retake his empire. Both Prince Michael's reluctance to join their cause and ineligibility for the throne failed to dissuade them. Soon Semyonov's clique had seized the city of Chita, denounced the RFP and declared their loyalty to the newly crowned Tsar. Free of Rodzaevsky's control and back on Russian soil, the officers are now preparing to destroy the fascist remnants and reunite Russia in the name of Tsar Mikhail II, whether he wants it or not."

From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
