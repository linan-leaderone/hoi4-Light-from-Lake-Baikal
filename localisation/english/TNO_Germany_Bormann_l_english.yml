 POLITICS_MARTIN_BORMANN_DESC:0 "Nazism has always relied primarily on two things: nationalistic sympathies towards one's own nation, and a central strongman smart enough to trample his enemies in the political game and sway the masses. None of Hitler's potential successors embodied this more than Martin Bormann; who learned closely from The Führer in his time as his secretary and strives to emulate him in every way. In doing so; Bormann has honed in on the nationalistic sentiments of the population to convince them that he is the only man in the Reich able to keep them safe and their nation secure. Often calling himself the 'Second Hitler' to cheering masses as he fed them exactly what they wanted.\n\nThe political arena has proven to be less of a battlefield and more of a shooting gallery to Bormann as well. While Bormann oft paints himself as an anti-intellectual and a simpler man to the masses, in the Reichstag he has proven himself to be a fierce negotiator, power player and deceiver to many. While Germany is divided between himself and the others who dared fight him, the Reichstag has always been firmly under his boot. Truly, if politics could win wars, then Bormann would have long ago conquered the world."

 POLITICS_MARTIN_BORMANN_FUCK_DESC:0 "The Brown Kaiser sits on his bloody throne in the heart of Germania as the Party fawns before him. His opponents are dead. The Reformists, the Militarists, the dissident Conservatives - all have been extinguished. The institutions that threatened his rule have been annihilated. Bormann is Germany, and Germany is Bormann.\n\nYet the clockwork of the bureaucratic apparatus grows rusty and stiff. His Party comrades gaze at him not with respect or love, but pure fear. Mass protests, violent riots and deadly terrorist attacks have seized the nation and refused to let go. The threat to the east looms ever larger, and the recent cancer diagnosis raises the grim question:\n\nWho will succeed the Führer?"

 bormann.1.t:0 "Bormann is Victorious"
 bormann.1.desc:0 "Bormann rode in triumph through the remains of Germania today towards the Volkshalle as bands played Das Rheingold and crowds cheered his arrival, waving the Reich's banner on every corner. An honor guard received him there, where the nation's new Führer quickly began announcing his plans for his new order.\n\nIn his speech, Bormann emphasized that his right to rule has been established already, not in the flames of the German Civil War but in the victories and accomplishments of the Reich in WWII. As the rightful continuation of the German governmnent, he now rules an order built up by the sweat and toil of Germans decades before, and saved and brought into the next decade by the sweat and toil of Germans now.\n\nInternationally the response is mute, as the United States and Japan both dig their feet in and prepare for more of the same from Germany."
 bormann.1.a:0 "At last the Reich is ours!"
 
 bormann.5.t:0 "Victory Almost Assured"
 bormann.5.desc:0 "The Fatherland stands in triumph! Speer and his dirty rats have been sent running, Göring and his revisionists stands destroyed, and Himmler's puppet Heydrich was sent to his accursed Burgundy! However, the War is not over yet - Germany has one more hurdle before it can return to the greatness it always had - that would be Speidel, and his Germanian defense force. By a miracle of God, our Welthauptstadt Germania has remained relatively unharmed by the war, and its inhabitants hail Speidel and his former commander, Erwin Rommel, as heroes for saving the beautiful landmarks of Germany.\n\nThe final step to reuniting Germany and returning to glory is to have Speidel make his guards stand down and let us enter Germania. Yet Speidel is in control of his army, and it is up to him to make the choice for it to bow to us."
 bormann.5.a:0 "We stand victorious!"
 
 bormann.6.t:0 "Speidel Surrenders Germania!"
 bormann.6.desc:0 "The wounded Germany that we inhibited has been marked with tension in the past days while Speidel contemplated his response to our request of putting his forces on stand-down orders. However, the entire nation took a sigh of relief and joy when Speidel and Rommel announced that their divisions would stand down for the first time since Germany engulfed itself in internal conflict, and allow Bormann's forces to enter Germania peacefully. As church bells rang across Bavaria and beers were passed out to impromptu crowds in Germanian pubs and beer halls, it seemed no place in the Reich did not do something to celebrate the end of the harrowing civil war that claimed so much German blood."
 bormann.6.a:0 "May the Reich prosper for one thousand years!"
 
 bormann.7.t:0 "Germania Decides to Fight!"
 bormann.7.desc:0 "Even though the last desperate holdouts continue to wage war on our army, we have considered ourselves victorious and turned our eyes to the last step to the much-needed reunification of the Fatherland - Speidel's Germania. As all of Germany simultaneously held its breath, Speidel decided the fate of Germania. The breath of the Fatherland was interrupted, however, with a punch to the stomach - Speidel has declared Germania will not stand down to Bormann and has ordered Germania to prepare for 'the final battle' with us. Such a battle does not look good for Germania - much of the Welthauptstadt is predicted to be destroyed in the fighting - and our citizens look on in horror. Although we are victorious, the olive dove has not rested just yet, and a final, decisive struggle must now begin for the fate of the nation we paid for so dearly in souls."
 bormann.7.a:0 "We will crush that 'general' into dust!" 

 bormann.8.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 bormann.8.d:0 "Unexpected news has reached us from Northern Germany today. It seems that the reformist liberals, led by the traitor Albert Speer, have approached us with an offer of ceasefire. Unfortunately, this is not because they wish to join our cause- rather, it is because a threat greater in their eyes than our faction has popped up.\n\nReinhard Heydrich, unquestionably one of the worst men in all of the Reich, has been steadily gaining power and influence while the other factions have fought with each other. He is now powerful enough to be a recognizable threat, on par with Göring and Speer. This has worried the Speerites, who are now approaching us with an offer to put aside our differences and destroy the common threat- that of the SS and their foul Burgundian System.\n\nOf course, it's a common belief among our soldiers that we could easily deal with SS rabble without the help of some student militias, but the freed up soldiers would certainly be quite the help in crushing this menace once and for all. It is our decision to make."
 bormann.8.a:0 "A ceasefire is appropriate."
 bormann.8.b:0 "We don't need their help."

 bormann.9.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 bormann.9.d:0 "Four men entered the battle for Germany's future, but most only thought there were three true contenders- Bormann, Göring, and Speer. The fourth, Heydrich, was widely seen as nothing more than a doomed breakaway, with no public support, little Heer support, and disconnected territory. Most discarded his candidacy from the start- certainly someone would crush him fast, and the nightmare would be over.\n\nUnfortunately, events have not gone the way we have expected. Heydrich is quickly gaining speed and momentum, and most recognize him as a real threat to take over Germany, despite the resistance of most of the people. As much as we hate our fellow competitors, we can all agree- Heydrich cannot be allowed to take control of the Reich, for he will certainly bring nothing but death and destruction to it.\n\nAs such, we have invited our challengers to a conference to negotiate a temporary "Anti-Heydrich Pact"- built not as a perfect solution to the Bürgerkrieg, but as a means to stop Heydrich before he becomes too powerful for us to contain."
 bormann.9.a:0 "We must come together, or we will die."
 bormann.9.b:0 "We will never work with traitors!"
 
 bormann.10.t:0 "Göring Refuses"
 bormann.10.d:0 "Disappointingly, it seems that Göring's ego has won out over his brain. In an unsurprising, yet shockingly irritating message, Göring has refused to enter in a ceasefire with our faction, claiming that his Heer is more than sufficient to do the job. While not exactly an unexpected response from the famously aggressive man, it's a setback.\n\nWhile we are confident in the ability of our forces to defeat Heydrich and send him packing, it certainly would have been simpler if we could concentrate all of our forces on their frontline."
 bormann.10.a:0 "Can we truly agree on nothing?"

 bormann.0.t: "The Political Rodeo"
 bormann.0.desc: "With the horrors of the Bürgerkrieg behind us, the Führer had dared to hope for some semblance of order and stability to return to the Reich. Unfortunately, it seems that this is barely the case. Though the remnants of the traitor Göring's forces were reintegrated to the Reich, thanks to the mercy of the Führer, some, Schörner chief among them, still push their agendas, and they are not alone. The remnants of the traitor Speer's clique still agitate the youth, ranting and raving about reforms and liberalization.\n\nReforms will happen, but not as Speer envisioned them. The Reich will not sink into the depravity it has fought so hard against, but instead will rise from the ashes of recent memory like a phoenix. Efforts to re-educate dissidents have already begun, and reintegration efforts, personally ordered by the Führer, make rapid progress in ensuring that the legacy of Adolf Hitler, forgotten by the rebels, is the Reich's only philosophy.\n\nThe Heer has already been deployed to key areas to ensure further stability, and the Führer works around the clock to reform the slave system to something more economically sound. Our Reichskomissiariats will be brought back into the fold, as the Führer has promised time and again, and the native revolts will be swiftly put down.\n\nAs for those who doubt the Führer, who wonder how things would be if another sat in the Reichstag, they will be dealt with swiftly. The Führer, with his characteristic political savvy, has already begun to work at chipping away the foundations of treasonous institutions and replacing them with loyal National Socialists. The Heer will be brought in line, and the students will learn to see reason.\n\nAnd when the work is done, the Reich will stand above all enemies, and the Führer will deliver unto the world the glory of true National Socialism."
 bormann.0.a: "Heil Bormann!"
 bormann.0.a_tt: "§YThe House of Cards is now available.§!\n§g-----------------§!\n§RTo secure§! §YControl§! §Rof Germany we must work to secure the §Yloyalty§! of the various demographics and interest groups within Germany, either that or limit the §Ypower§! of those we cannot control. It is only by dominating this§! §YHouse of Cards§! §Rthat we may maintain stability in the Reich and purge our enemies.§!"

 bormann.26.t: "The Question of Slavery"
 bormann.26.desc: "The issue of slavery has long plagued the Reich. It is indubitable that the German is the master of Europe, and the Slav little more than a backwards animal; for these subhumans to toil at the behest of their Aryan conquerors is the natural outcome for Europe, as dictated by basic biology. Nonetheless, we must admit that slavery's impact on the economy has not necessarily been a positive one. The disgusting filth spewed by the traitor Speer, while being a total betrayal of National Socialism itself, may have held within a small nugget of truth. The overreliance on slaves has not helped the problem of unemployment among the lower classes, and boosting employment with unprofitable vanity projects may simply delay our economic issues. On average, the German man and woman are spending less and less as consumers, leading to some fears that the system of slavery as it stands could lead to the collapse of the German economy itself.\n\nThe Reich must make a stark choice regarding the status of slavery. As many conservatives within the Party are suggesting, the slave camps that were destroyed during the Bürgerkrieg should be rebuilt, and the Slavs kicked back to work. However, perhaps a more sensible compromise would be to halt the system of slavery and instead transfer these mongrels to isolated city ghettoes."
 bormann.26.a: "Send them to the ghettoes."
 bormann.26.b: "Compromise is for cowards. The slave camps must be rebuilt!"

 bormann.27.t: "Our Most Dangerous Issue"
 bormann.27.desc: "The Bürgerkrieg ripped the Fatherland apart limb from limb, and despite the Führer's selfless efforts to stitch the fractured remnants of the Reich back together, there are some wounds that still fester. If they are not treated soon, the body of the Reich will atrophy, and we may collapse into chaos yet again.\n\nThe men of the Wehrmacht may have sworn their oaths of loyalty towards the new Führer, but not all have sought to align themselves fully behind his wisdom. A faction of military reformists has coalesced around Hans Speidel, advocating for the total reinvigoration of the Wehrmacht, including a complete overhaul of military strategies and a professional, reduced draft. On the other end of the spectrum, Ferdinand Schörner has rallied his band of militarists, sabre-rattlers who desire an increased draft and a political role for the Wehrmacht.\n\nWhile Bormann would sooner trust a Swiss banker than these uniformed weasels, the Reich's wounds can only be healed with the support of one of these two influential factions. The clock is counting down, and the time draws near for the Führer to grit his teeth and do a deal with the devil."
 bormann.27.a: "But which devil?"

 #THE SHOWDOWN
 bormann.28.t: "A Meeting with the Wehrmacht's Leaders"
 bormann.28.desc: "Martin Bormann rubbed his eyes with a deep sigh. The days seemed to stretch out longer as the weeks went by. There were moments - fleeting, insignificant - when he imagined himself retiring to bed early in the evening, released of the crushing burden of preserving the Reich. He stared at the moonlight streaming in through the window, pooling across the floor towards his large oaken desk. When was the last time he had appreciated something as simple as a ray of moonlight?\n\n"Heil Bormann." The sleepy voice snapped him out of his ridiculous thoughts.\n\n"Heil Bormann," Bormann replied gruffly down the phone. "Herr Speidel, you are invited to a private meeting in the Reichskanzlei. I am willing to appoint a new Chief of the OKW if a persuasive case is presented to me. Ferdinand has already agreed to join us." Reluctantly, Bormann thought. Schörner's voice, at first so smug and satisfied at the invitation, had begun to radiate fury the moment Speidel's name was mentioned.\n\n"I understand, my Führer," Speidel's fatigued, mildly confused voice came after a brief pause. "Heil Bormann."\n\nBormann pushed the phone down with a grunt and once more his eyes drifted to the luminescent puddle transforming the ugly pattern of the rug into something surprisingly beautiful. Bormann pushed himself out of the chair, crossed the room, and flicked the light switch on. The moonlight vanished in an instant. He returned to his desk, picked up his pen and began to scribble. There was no time for such childish distractions.\n\nBormann had work to do."
 bormann.28.a: "The meeting awaits..."

 bormann.29.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Future Direction"
 bormann.29.desc: ""Enter!" Bormann barked, his gaze firmly fixed on the portrait of himself hanging on the wall. He heard the door open behind him, followed by two overlapping cries of "Heil, my Führer!" Bormann turned around towards the two uniformed officers, bespectacled snakes in the skin of lions.\n\n"Let's avoid the pleasantries, gentleman," Bormann said gruffly. "Sit down. We cannot delay this discussion any further. The Fatherland deserves a strong and stable army to defend its people and preserve its land. As your Führer, it is my duty to listen to your arguments." Bormann sat down in his chair and crossed his arms. "Convince me."\n\n"You have my gratitude for allowing us this opportunity, my Führer," Speidel spoke up, taking his seat at the table. "Only by reinvigorating and adapting the Wehrmacht to modern times can we help launch Germany into a new era of progress. We cannot allow the quagmire of the past to bog down our soldiers in the present. We must explore new tactics and new strategies. We need a total review of the Wehrmacht. Many competent and respected men who desire true reform have attached themselves to my ideals."\n\n"As they did to Speer's," Schörner sneered. "My Führer, is our army not the greatest in the world? Did we not crush the Allies and the Soviet Union? We have the greatest minds behind the greatest strategies, commanding the bravest and most noble of men in the world." Schörner thrust a finger towards Speidel. "This man and his clique of cowards would strip the Wehrmacht down to nothing in the name of 'reform'!"\n\nBormann sighed heavily as the two officers continued their arguing. This was going to be a long meeting..."
 bormann.29.a: "Speidel is right. We need a total review of the Wehrmacht."
 bormann.29.b: "Schörner's logic is untouchable. Our Wehrmacht is already great!"

 bormann.30.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: Conscription"
 bormann.30.desc: ""Let us move onto our next topic," Bormann said, lighting up his cigar. "Conscription. Where do you stand?"\n\n"As I have already stated, my Führer," Schörner said, pushing his spectacles up his sharp nose, "our army's strategies have proven to be successful; however, an army is nothing without its personnel. The Reich is beset on all sides by threats, from the Jewish capitalists in Washington to the yellow powermongers of the Orient. What if they try to invade us? We cannot allow the fruits of our labour to be snatched away as our feeble Wehrmacht watches on." Schörner jabbed a finger on the table. "We need more conscripts!"\n\n"A bloated army is just as effective as a bloated soldier," Speidel waved his hand dismissively. "It'll collapse under its own weight. A reduced draft will tighten our military, and then we can sensibly set about professionalising the Wehrmacht. Professional commanders and professional soldiers, not incompetent yes-men leading scared young cannon fodder. Our priorities should be quality, not quantity. It is necessary, therefore, that the new draft be voluntary - "\n\n"Voluntary?!" Schörner exploded into laughter and slapped the table heartily. "Forgive me, my Führer... but this man is suggesting that we take the honour and glory of battle away from the young men of the Reich! War is what turns us into heroes. Speidel would deprive the right of our citizens to fight alongside each other in favour of... what? A small cluster of so-called professionals?"\n\nBormann drummed his fingers against the table, brow furrowed in thought."
 bormann.30.a: "Speidel speaks the truth. We must prioritise the quality of the army over its quantity."
 bormann.30.b: "Schörner understands the military. A larger army is a mightier army."

 bormann.31.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Role of the Wehrmacht"
 bormann.31.desc: "Bormann rubbed his temples as the two men gestured and shouted. To have been Adolf Hitler in the glory days, surrounded by adulating columns of generals who hung onto his every pearl of wisdom... Watching these uniformed serpents argue who could hiss the loudest and bite the hardest made Bormann's stomach churn.\n\n"Enough!" Bormann snapped, mashing his third cigar into the ashtray. "It is time for us to address our final topic. What political position should the Wehrmacht have in our Greater Reich?"\n\n"It is my belief that the military should be an apolitical force within the Fatherland," Speidel stated. "It is the duty of the Wehrmacht to serve the nation and its people, not to lobby the government, and certainly not to pursue political agendas. If the military considers itself to be an equal to the Party, how long until it decides to become the Party itself?"\n\n"You are spouting lies as usual!" Schörner spat. "You, who would see the Wehrmacht treated as a mere tool, and not an instrumental force within our nation! If the Party is the head of the Reich, the Wehrmacht is its mighty fist: Together, we work in tangent to crush our enemies, but separated we all bleed out. The military should absolutely be political, and a true standard-bearer of National Socialist thought. An apolitical Wehrmacht would become a disloyal Wehrmacht.""
 bormann.31.a: "Speidel is right. The Wehrmacht should serve as an apolitical force."
 bormann.31.b: "Schörner is correct. A political Wehrmacht is one loyal to our cause."

 bormann.32.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Result"
 bormann.32.desc_speidel_victory: ""Silence!" Bormann raised his hand firmly and the two officers ceased their bickering. "I have made my decision. Herr Speidel, you are correct. It is time for true reform within the Wehrmacht to take place. Effective immediately, you will take the position of Chief of the OKW." Speidel allowed himself a satisfied smile and nodded slightly as Schörner's eyes widened in fury and his hands balled into fists.\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Speidel said, "for reaching your open hand out towards those in the Wehrmacht who desire positive change. You have my full support."\n\n"This is outrageous!" Schörner roared, shooting spittle across the table. He leapt up and slammed his fists against the wooden surface. He pointed accusingly at Bormann, drilling into him with burning eyes. "You have just let a traitor into your bed! A secret acolyte of Albert Speer himself!"\n\n"How fucking dare you!" Bormann shot to his feet, grabbed his ashtray and launched it towards the raging officer. Schörner ducked just in time to avoid the projectile. "Remember who you are speaking to, Ferdinand!"\n\n"I know exactly who I'm speaking to." Schörner stiffly brushed cigar ash off of his uniform. The sneer stretched across his face was all but treasonous. "Heil Bormann." With that, he marched out of the room.\n\nSpeidel quickly replaced his shocked face with a grateful one as he strolled over to Bormann with his arm outstretched. The Führer replied with a firm handshake and a forced smile."
 bormann.32.desc_schorner_victory: ""My decision is made," Bormann announced, interrupting the debate with a raised fist. This farce had gone on long enough. The choice was obvious. "Herr Schörner, your proposals are the only path to a stronger Wehrmacht. Effective immediately, I appoint you Chief of the OKW." Schörner flashed a lopsided grin and jumped to his feet as Speidel slumped further down into his chair with an ashen face.\n\n"This is most... unfortunate," Speidel sighed. He slowly removed his round spectacles and rubbed his eyes. "I fear you have made the wrong decision, my Führer."\n\n"Is it not my decision to make?" Bormann snapped, slamming his fist onto the table. "Watch your fucking tongue!"\n\n"Apologies, my Führer," Speidel replied hastily. He shot a salute into the air. "Heil Bormann." Bormann returned the greeting with a stiff salute, and the officer nodded curtly and marched out of the room.\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Schörner said smugly, swaggering over to Bormann and shaking his hand vigorously. "Your support for the brave officers of the Wehrmacht will not be forgotten soon. Trust me." Schörner's smile stretched further upwards, but it didn't quite reach his icy eyes."
 bormann.32.a: "A deal with the Devil..."

 bormann.33.t:0 "Everything Is In Ordnung"
 bormann.33.desc:0 ""Past events have been troubling. To solve a problem without complete knowledge of it is impossible - this almost proved to be the Reich's downfall."\n\nMüller nodded politely. "I quite agree. Knowledge is power, as they say."\n\nBormann leaned forward, an intense look in his eye. "I thought you'd say that. I know you are not the most ardent believer in Party doctrine - this is acceptable. I need someone without scruples, someone who knows how to look out for themselves. Someone pragmatic. The Reich's intelligence services are a mess, such was Hitler's way. He trusted no man with all that information. Well, Hitler was wrong, and it almost killed me. I want everything under one branch, that of the Orpo. And I want to put you in charge."\n\nMüller wasn't particularly surprised - it was his lack of politics that had grabbed Heydrich's eye, back when to do such a thing wasn't a death sentence. This was certainly a step up, however.\n\n"It would be my honour, my Führer."\n\n"Don't talk to me of honour as if you believe in it. I don't want a man with honour. I want a man who will act in his own self interest.""
 bormann.33.a:0 ""You have found him.""

 bormann.34.t:0 "Dealmaker to Dealbreaker"
 bormann.34.desc:0 "Bormann examined the papers on his desk. He'd made a lot of promises. Promises were something he tried to avoid, for when you adhered to one you'd usually break another. Protecting the Reich and being kind to its people were usually polar opposites, for example. It had taken far too many promises to evade the coup, ones he'd really rather not keep.\n\nHe picked up the papers and flicked through them. If there was no proof a promise had been made, it would simply be his word against theirs. And his word was the best in the Reich. He stood from his comfortable chair and surveyed his now-empty office, lit only by smouldering embers.\n\nHe cast the papers into the fireplace, and watched them shrivel and burn."
 bormann.34.a:0 "Problem solved."

Perhaps these men have been loyal from the start, or perhaps they realize how doomed their situation is. Whatever the reason, they have accepted Bormann's invitation to talk about the future of Poland in Germania. Though the Poles are no real threat to our might, and many of the more aggressive members of our cabinet are chomping at the bit to simply stomp them out, it is wise to save precious German blood for any military actions of more consequences than just Poland. Whatever the case, the offer has been accepted, and soon the Poles will make their way to Bormann's office. We must prepare for anything to be said, as many in our own administration hold private doubts about how receptive these ambassadors will be to our demands. Bormann himself seems optimistic about it publicly, but some say that he is just as expectant of a refusal as many others are. We will have to wait and see."

Owing to the diminished and impoverished state of Poland, we are willing to accept the mutually beneficial protection of the Greater German Reich, contingent on three conditions as set by the governing body of the Polish Republic:\n\n1. The autonomy of the Polish Republic's government must be guaranteed. Non-Polish authorities, military or civilian, must not infringe on the self-determination of the Polish legislature or apparatus of state.\n\n2. German colonization of sovereign Polish lands, as well as the forcible assimilation of Poles into the German ethno-cultural sphere, is to end immediately.\n\n3. The government, state, lands, people, culture, language and all associated concepts and institutions are to be formally recognised as Polish. They are to be referred to as such in all official documentation, diplomatic channels and government policy of the Greater German Reich.\n\nIf these conditions are accepted by the Führer, the Polish Republic will accept the offer of protection by and economic integration with the Greater German Reich. These conditions are non-negotiable. Refusal shall be considered the end of negotiations and the Free Polish Army will reorient its defense policies accordingly.\n\nRegards, President [POL.GetLeader]."

"Should I ah... inform someon-"\n\nBormann shot upright, dropping his cigar and slamming his palms down on the desk. "What the fuck do you think? Tell High Command to get their shit together and put those fucking Poles in the dirt!" The secretary stumbled back, hesitatingly moving for the door. "NOW!" Bormann bellowed, sending the skinny young man fleeing for the telephone.\n\nIn truth, it was his preferred solution; Hitler had recognized the obstinate and non-malleable nature of the Poles. Even moreso than other Slavs, they were feeble-minded, stubborn and useless for anything more than menial agricultural labor. Why Bormann ever thought they could actually be reasoned with was beyond him now. It had been worth a try, at least, if only to spare a little Aryan blood. That the Poles could not recognise their correct place in the world was no fault of his, though, and so the General Government would be re-established atop the mass grave of the Polish race. If they wanted to die soon and quickly rather than later and slowly, that was fine by Bormann."

He stood and strode over to the window, gazing out upon Germania with a gleeful look plastered across his rounded face. "So much for Polish spirit, hm? A peasant race will always be a peasant race, Hewel!"\n\nThe Foreign Minister gave a wan smile and stowed away the Polish government's response in his pocket. "Quite right, my Führer. If only all Slavs were so co-operative."\n\n"Co-operative?" Bormann rolled his eyes at his subordinate's obvious misunderstanding. "Poles don't know the meaning of the word, Hewel. No, this is just that Slavic animal cunning in action. They think that this will be a permanent arrangement, that they have the chance to build up their strength for some..." He was lost for words for a moment, waving his cigar in the air. "Some kind of future; as if those peasants even think they have one. Mark me, Walther: this only lasts until we find a decisive solution to our Polish Question."\n\nHewel's stomach turned at the thought of what the Führer might have in mind, but he still found the will to smile faintly, congratulate his master, and slip away to contemplate whether they could get away with that again."

With the army lacking the experienced counterintelligence network necessary to defend itself against us, it would be child's play to infiltrate its command structure and begin funnelling vital intelligence to the Wehrmacht. While some hawks believe they already have all the intel required on the Polish, their successful uprising has raised questions about our previous estimations of their fighting ability. Being able to accurately reassess it could save many German lives.\n\nAlternatively, we could adhere to the Wehrmacht's wishes and target the Polish logistics system, focusing our efforts on sabotage, misdirection and cutting supply lines.

Needless to say, this is more than welcome, despite the loss of German lives involved.

However, by the day's dawn even the administrative center's most embittered cynics could do nothing but be stunned - if not be truly surprised - by the columns of armored vehicles and ranks of soldiers proceeding down the streets towards the city's center. Even though word had not been given directly to the public about their mission, it was obvious to all what the Wehrmacht had come to do.\n\nThe thunder of jetcraft rattled the government headquarters even as riflemen shouted orders at panicking security officers who, in the true spirit of the GGN, had not received warning from their superiors. By the end of the hour, Hans Frank's clique and all attached political officials had been - sometimes forcefully - placed under arrest and evicted from the centers of power in the Generalgouvernement. By the end of the day, NSDAP functionaries and other assorted party members had been installed throughout Krakau as the heads of the new Interinregierung and immediately set to work on their herculean task; dousing the political fires Hans Frank's clique had left to consume the entire administration."

A functionary of the Interinregierung might discover reports detailing a transfer of funds and personnel to a managerial department only for another functionary to find that same department having been consolidated into a completely unrelated bureau whose new records are kept using archiving methods that can only be described as 'labyrinthine'.\n\nThe remnants of the bureaucrats and secretaries of the administration have been less than cooperative as well. This is not due to some personal resistance to assisting our operation, but rather that those individuals know less about the overall picture than even our own functionaries and investigators.

By all measure every last one of them was guilty of high crimes against the Reich and its peoples; embezzlement, fraud, dereliction of duty, even technical treason to the Vaterland, and each carried a very high price to the accused. These charges could not be dismissed, for as much as some in the NSDAP would wish to put the entire failure behind them, the citizens were incensed at the fact that on Germany's very doorstep such a national embarrassment was allowed to transpire at all, much less continue unabated for years.\n\nBormann stood from his desk and strode to the windows, considering the bustling sprawl of Germania and the Reich before him. The accused would be punished, but the question remained to what degree. Should they be subjected to the full purview of the law then the people of the Reich would be relieved and, perhaps most importantly, witness firsthand Bormann weeding out those corrupt officials and thereby cement his commitment to justice. However, there are notable members in the party who would take exception to such drastic punishments to their compatriots, and Bormann's control in the nation is not yet absolute. Inversely, letting the clique off with just a figurative black eye would endear a swath of the party to him and his judgement, though surely the people would not favor such a decision."

Still, if there was one thing the Führer knew above all else, it is that politics has a way of making a decision for you. Of all options, there were three men Bormann considered.\n\nFirst was Eduard Wagner, the man responsible for The Reich's logistics during the Second World War and a notable militarist. The GGN is vital to the Reich logistically, and accordingly Wagner will excel in such a position, though he will have to step down from his military rank to receive it. Second is Theodor Koch, the industrialist of the Reichswerke Hermann Göring company. The GGN has untapped industrial potential and a savvy man like Koch will handle the aforementioned logistics well. Finally, Werner Dollinger, a reformist and famous Bavarian economist, would perform admirably in reconstructing the economic prospects of the GGN itself.\n\nBormann brought the phone to his lips, paused, and came to a decision."

However, his last missive was of a very different tone. Ignoring proper procedure, he has declared a state of emergency which will allow him to "temporarily assume command of any Wehrmacht units as well as give orders to any NSDAP institutions until the situation across Germany is resolved." This act is technically illegal, but litigating it is hardly worth value in this moment.\n\nThe good news is that for now, Gotenland will be organized enough to protect itself from bandits.

Admirals from across the Reich, from every conceivable fleet and theatre, have apparently sent communiques to Theoderichshafen commending Dönitz's actions. His proclaimations have evidently hit a chord with much of the German navy, particularly those who had been feeling uneasy about publicly choosing a side in the civil war, offering an apparently 'neutral' face-saving alternative. A fanciful story has even begun to circulate about four sailors from Wilhelmshaven who jumped overboard and swam over a mile to land when the captain announced his support for Albert Speer instead of Dönitz.\n\nWith ships from across the Reich rallying to Dönitz's banner, and therefore, to Maierhofer's, prospects are looking increasingly dim for the German state.

"We have treated the Orpo exactly as we were told. Why Bormann has decided to deploy even more of those German bastards throughout Dietsland I do not know. If you ask me, it's nothing more than an insult. They want our people to believe it's the Reich that's maintaining stability here, not us."\n\n"It's more than just an insult, Daniël," van Geelkerken responded quietly, turning his back on the black columns. "It's a threat. If we don't do as the Führer says, the Orpo will have our entire government up against a wall within hours." The German leash had become so tight he could hardly breathe. "There's nothing we can do. Inform the WA leadership of the new deployment. I have a speech to make.""

Earlier today, our Leider met with the Führer of the Großgermanisches Reich in what we can confirm was a friendly discussion regarding Dutch policy. Following their private meeting, the two leaders gave a brief but informative conference before the Reich Press."\n\nThe screen cut to two men - one small and stocky, the other tall and slender - strolling into a large room and shaking each other's hands with big smiles. A cacophony of clicks exploded across the room as the leaders were lit up with white light. Van Geelkerken turned to the cameras with a stately countenance.\n\n"To my fellow Dutch people, I am both proud and honored to announce that the old practice of 'cultural Germanization' has been substituted with the brand-new system of 'cultural allegiance'. The Dutch State of Dietsland is proud to stand side-by-side with the German Reich, our friend and protector, to whom we owe our loyalty."\n\nBormann faced the cameras awkwardly. "The German and Dutch peoples are racial brethren. Dutch culture - aligned with German ideals - should be celebrated throughout their nation." He turned to van Geelkerken to shake his hand again, and once more the cameras erupted.\n\nThe newsreader returned to the screen.\n\n"We are grateful, but not surprised, that the tenacious wisdom of the Leider has brought us this cultural autonomy. After this conference, the Führer hosted a grand ceremony in which the Leider, who has already accepted the esteemed position of 'Reichskommissar', was formally granted this title in the presence of NSDAP ministers and Wehrmacht officers alike.""

To our surprise, this Dutchman has written directly to the Führer, offering to transform the nation back into a Reichskommissariat with himself as its Reichskommissar.\n\nWhile a subservient German-run administration would be more trustworthy than a band of fascist Dutchmen, we should accept that van Geelkerken has loyally kept his nation in the Einheitspakt.

De Rochemont leads the Völkish faction of the NSB and has spoken of his willingness to fasten the pace of Germanization in the Netherlands.\n\nWith de Rochemont in power, our Dutch brethren will soon be integrated into the glory of the Reich.

At the three cars rolling up to the bottom of the steps. At the columns of security personnel lining the perimeter. At the small camera crew standing next to him, filming an Orpo officer opening one of the car doors. De Rochemont expected a gunshot, an explosion, a scream at any second... but just as rapidly as his fears had arisen, they melted away into awe as the Führer exited the car and marched up the stairs with his security team. He grabbed de Rochemont's outstretched hand and shook it firmly, the stern expression under his peaked cap turning into a smile when he noticed the camera beside them.\n\n"My loyal friend," Bormann said awkwardly, eyes flickering to the camera. "It is, uh, a pleasure to be in this beautiful Reichskommissariat, and to finally meet you in person. Your loyalty to the Reich knows no bounds." De Rochemont's chest swelled with pride. Decades ago, he had stood against the tide of degenerate liberalism by setting up the very first Dutch fascist movement; to have risen from such humble origins to the esteemed office of Reichskommissar was almost poetic.\n\n"I don't think we'll pick up any audio with all this wind..." one of the camera crew announced.\n\n"Why didn't you fucking say so?" Bormann snapped, his smile wiped away in an instant. "Herr de Rochemont, this is the plan. Inside, we'll give a talk in front of the cameras. I'll commend you for your valiant efforts in providing stability and crushing resistance, and then cement your legitimacy by praising your loyalty.

Following the fall of the Low Countries in 1940, Seyss-Inquart was appointed as the Reichskommissar of the Netherlands, were he dutifully enacted the necessary measures to root out dissent and Jewry.\n\nAfter the dismissal of Joachim von Ribbentrop, there were even some whispers that the Austrian would be appointed as the new Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs. His potential rise to power was halted abruptly, however, by his obligation to ensure the stability and Germanization of the Netherlands, which had experienced a stagnation in progress.\n\nServing for two decades until succumbing to nature's intent, Seyss-Inquart deserves to be revered and respected as the tenacious leader he was. It is only fitting that a great memorial be built in his honor, to cement his position in the history of the nation that will soon be integrated into the Reich."

Bormann has decreed that the Dutch Landwehr is to be brought under his control as a threat against any potential rebellious government that seeks to betray the Reich. It will also act as a Sword of Damocles over the head of de Rochemont, just in case his ego grows larger than his jackboots and he ventures into treasonous waters; one order from the Führer, and the Landwehr would seize control of Amsterdam within the day."

De Rochemont may complain, but there is no harm in treating Reichskommissariat Niederlande as a German province, for that will soon be its reality.\n\nHowever, Bormann has not yet decided how best to utilize these ports once they are placed into German hands.

There is no negotiation or compromise to be had with these madmen. Just as Heydrich was crushed, we will destroy Feldmeijer's pathetic little army and hang him like a filthy dog.\n\nBefore we declare war, however, we must determine how best to conduct our invasion. Many generals have pointed towards 'Operation Blauer Rhein', a standard invasion strategy drawn up years ago in the event of a Dutch rebellion. The Führer has also been approached with 'Operation Grüner Rhein', a more ferocious plan dedicated to destroying the SS swiftly and mercilessly by treating all Dutchmen as potential enemies. This plan involves mass collateral damage and the destruction of dams to wipe out the enemy, which will doubtless stir fury among the native Dutch.\n\nThe former plan is safer and more merciful, but mercy is not a word to be used when discussing the SS. As for the latter plan, it will ensure such a violent destruction of the SS that Himmler himself will not dare interfere in any more of our territories but may herald uncertain long-term consequences."

American propaganda is referring to South Africa as a 'domino' that will soon fall to National Socialism unless they provide military assistance, and their troops are proving to be determined and brutal in combat. The South Africans have hardly been feeble opponents, either."\n\n"They are of Anglo-Saxon blood. It should not surprise us that Germanics would resist us so effectively."

Schenck and Müller had also remained neutral, it was true, but out of sheer pragmatism. As far as Bormann was concerned, Hüttig's loyalties lay elsewhere.\n\nThe phone clicked.\n\n"Heil Bormann!" came the clipped voice of the Reichskommissar. "Did you receive my formal congratulations on your success in the Bürgerkrieg?"\n\n"I did not. There is much I did not receive from you, Reichskommissar."

Any advancing South Africans or Americans who dare to cross into Ostafrikan territory will be torn apart in swift and fiery revenge. As well as damaging our foes and slowing their advance, it will act as the perfect psychological weapon. Not a single enemy soldier will escape the chilling fear that every step forward could be their last.\n\nWhile our military forces in Afrika have been educated regarding these extensive plans, there have been a few casualties from civilians stepping on anti-personnel mines.

If any man wishes to seek penance for their treason, they will be transported to Afrika immediately. If you refuse, well... depending on the severity of your crimes, you will serve the Reich in a distant labor camp or you will serve the Reich in front of a shooting squad. Any man brave enough to serve the Reich in battle, however, will step forwards now!"\n\nJoachim groaned softly.

"Denmark will maintain its Protektorat status, and you will stand down from power to allow the old government to return."\n\n"I see..." von Hanneken's bitter voice came after a long pause. "This is... most unfortunate."\n\n"For your loyalties, I will pardon your recent actions.

 bormann.1004.desc:0 "Since we first occupied Denmark in 1940, our goal has been to transform the region, as the late Führer himself described it, into a 'model protektorat'. Despite the rising tide of disorder raging through the Reich and its territories, culminating in the bloody Bürgerkrieg, German rule over Denmark has remained relatively stable. Even in death, Hitler's wisdom continues to reverberate throughout Europe; in the face of Madagaskar and Ostland's Civil Wars, Denmark is proof of the success of our occupation policies.\n\nThe chaos that swept the Einheitspakt did not befall the government of Werner Best, who has served as the German Plenipotentiary and effective head of state for many years. Despite calls from reformist and militarist wings of the Party to modify Denmark's government, Bormann's only act of interference will be to send a letter of gratitude to Best for proving the success of our foreign policy..."

While the admittedly dysfunctional government Werner Best unofficially presides over lacks the stability we would otherwise desire, his devotion to Bormann and the National Socialist ideal more than makes up for it. Best's competence as a bureaucrat and administrator cannot be understated, and his continued position in power provides the best outcome for us all."

As leader of the Danish Waffen-SS and self-styled Fører of his Party, Martinsen has served the Reich as a loyal collaborator for the last two decades; however, his infamous opposition to Danish integration has likely urged him towards his coup, and his desire to integrate Denmark as an independent but loyal member of the Einheitspakt looks set to be implemented into reality.\n\nIf Bormann were to generously accede to Martinsen's wishes, it would be out of generosity to the loyal comrade, and a desire for a swift diplomatic solution. Nonetheless, this Dane is of no threat to us, and his pathetic little country would be crushed in an instant were the Führer to command it. For now, Bormann is simply waiting for Martinsen's inevitable demands."

As you know, I have selflessly dedicated the last two decades of my life to the German Reich. My capable leadership of my Party - as well as the Danish Waffen-SS - has inspired dutiful collaboration and support for the National Socialist ideal in Denmark.\n\nIt is my strong belief that the nation of Denmark deserves to exist as an independent state. While we are a proud Aryan people, our culture differs from yours, and must be sustained for the sake of European harmony. I have halted plans for Danish integration into the Reich, and humbly request that you give me your political blessing. Denmark under my rule shall remain loyal to the German Reich and will stand proudly for One Thousand Years as a member of the Einheitspakt.\n\nHeil Bormann!\n\ngez. K. B. Martinsen, Fører of Denmark"

Whether it happens in the next few years or the next few decades, Denmark will join the Reich. Only an egotistical fool such as Martinsen would delay the inevitable.\n\nThe time has come to ready the Heer and prepare for invasion.

What say you?"\n\n"I'm sure the Militarists would enjoy that very much," Burgdorf replied bitterly. "If you want my advice, we should establish a puppet republic, actually run by Danes. That'll grant us the stability we crave, I guarantee it!" Hewel and a few others nodded in agreement.\n\nBormann sat back and ran the proposal through his head.

"Denmark is officially in the Einheitspakt as an independent nation. The following news conference will last around an hour. We'll answer the questions Hewel sent you in advance, and then we shall engage in some ceremonial nonsense." He gripped the man's hand like a vice. Martinsen laughed nervously. "Many people in my government want to see you hanged. I respect your loyalty, and have taken a huge risk. I expect you to comply unconditionally to each and every one of my orders.

It was originally to be a short - and unimportant - meeting that was quickly pencilled in between more pressing matters of state, however, it would seem the future of Germany's northern dominion evidently rested on a foundation of beans.\n\n"Let us be clear..." began the Führer, "...you are saying that the agrarian reforms in Norway fail us not because of a lack of arable land or the farmer's resistance ties, but..." Bormann splayed a beige folder before him and surveyed sheafs of densely worded reports on nutrition and yield before continuing, "...instead as a result of the quality of Norwegian beans." It was not a question. The academic straightened his tie and replied as candidly as he was able, aware that his entire career could be made - or unmade - by the Führer's reaction to his findings. "Yes, my Führer. Norway has been limited in production of food since the medieval era, and it will never be able to approach continental lands in production, for example. By 'insisting' on forced agrarianism for the Norwegians, not only are they fighting an uphill battle with the arable land and the terrorists, as you've said, but they are also fighting against a lack of proper carbohydrates. The energy and nutrients in Norwegian oats and other native foodstuffs simply fail to meet the Reich's requirements for the population to properly contribute, in labor or otherwise, without continental imports." The Führer did not immediately respond, but digested the information carefully."

I understand you have some things that you would wish to discuss before we truly get down to the business of collaboration, correct?"\n\n"Indeed you are. I have a few topics I would wish to bring up before I would be willing to rejoin the Pakt. After all, what's good for Norway is good for Germany, in my opinion."\n\nThe diplomat laughed. "Of course, of course. Now tell me, Lunde- what is it you would wish to change? Industrialization? A defense force? Say what it is, and I'm sure we can deliver."\n\n"Well..." Lunde thought for a moment. "I'm not sure how positively you'll react to what I say here, my friend." He smiled.\n\n"Oh, come on. You'll never know until you say it," the diplomat replied again. Lunde breathed in, steeling himself.\n\n"I believe that Norway should be independent of direct German rule. We've proven ourselves loyal, we've proven that we can defend ourselves, and we've proven that Norway, by and large, supports the Aryan ideal. It seems only fair that we gain something in return for our steadfast support, and autonomy- real autonomy, not the fake client states that you held over Serbia and Bulgaria- seems like a good compromise, does it not?"\n\nThe diplomat stared at Lunde like he had two heads.

Circling around him were several men, all leading figures of the National Socialist and Pro-German factions in Norway; many were wary of Herr Schmidt, yet others were gleeful at the prospect of securing The Reich's support in their efforts.\n\nSmoke blew from the shadowy man's mouth as he leaned into the light and regarded the others. "You've done well for yourselves, and you've done well for Norway, nothing can be more true. Even still, it has not been enough. With every passing day, the weak men in government degrade all that National Socialism has done for Norway. With every month, the wolf of bolshevism creeps closer to destroying everything that is good and right, and your government gladly leaves the door open to it. You know it, the people of Norway know it, and, luckily for us all, the Reichstag knows it too. Today I bring you a proposal. My superiors and the highest echelons of power in The Reich wish to see Norway set free again; you do as well, more than anyone.

Pro-German fascists and national socialists have emerged in the capitol and marched on the Storting, the supreme legislature of Norway. While the city's police forces rapidly deployed a response, Norwegians loyal to Germany have already blocked off roads and bridges across the city with vehicles and makeshift barriers. Inside the houses of government, armed fascist paramilitaries are attempting to find and seize particular representatives and heads of government; by and large these attempts have been met with failure as a last-minute tip off sent several of the legislature's members into hiding, although the putschits have already begun "prosecuting" those they've managed to find so far.\n\nOutside the city proper, ad hoc militias are being formed as the news spreads to the rest of the country and citizens discover the fragility of their liberty. Brawls and light skirmishes have already begun devolving into open gunfights in and around the city-under-siege even as military formations form up outside the city and prepare to deploy. Still, whispers of traitors and hidden pro-german elements have stalled confidence in the ability of the guard to put an end to this threat, to say nothing of its ability to actually engage with the coup's potent German support. Regardless, the current equilibrium cannot be maintained; as the military and citizens already fight tooth and nail against the storming of the capitol, the pro-Germans and fascists are rounding up the last heads of state as hostages. All that remains to be seen is the soul of the nation and the will of the people."

The Führer is already meeting with the General Staff and Kriegsmarine to employ all possible options to guarantee a nation hostile to The Reich does not lie at its very doorstep."

Even now, the putschists have begun detaining the previous members of government, and evidently also those citizens who did not make their loyalties clear during the coup itself. Our contacts in the new regime assure us that in the coming days the entire nation will be under their control and order and stability will reign once more in Norway.\n\nThis is a momentous occasion; not only will we be able to maintain our military presence in the Arctic and North Seas with the benefit of Norwegian bases, economic utilization of the region will also be able to continue as planned. Further still, we have demonstrated to both ourselves and the world the strength of National Socialism and denied our enemies a safe haven on our doorstep.

Since then, private investors from both Norway and Germany have been looking for precious black gold offshore, following and prospecting the Norwegian Continental Shelf.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of costly drilling, they finally did it. Located on the southern tip of the shelf, the wealth that had been found under the sea is seemingly boundless. Geologists now even believe that there is more oil; much more lining huge swaths of the Norwegian coasts, waiting to be discovered. As of now, just the reserves that have been discovered are the largest offshore deposits in the world, to the elation of both Germans and Norwegians.\n\nIt is yet to be seen how the two will proceed from here, but oil reserves could give both economies a huge boost. Norway in particular could see huge economic benefits and some much needed industry and diversification, but must also consider Germany's interests.

Just today, we have been presented with an opportunity to see if this axiom is proven true once more.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs informs us they have just received a diplomatic invitation from Germany to renegotiate and reevaluate our "relationship" with them; in light of our people's history with one another it is a bold step for the Germans to say the absolute least. However, it is more than clear that the Reich does not handle failure and loss well, and by accepting this potential olive branch we could begin working to avoid any diplomatic - or military - incidents in the immediate future.\n\nThis a purely preliminary message; the place and time, and even the attendees, have not been specified in the text itself, though the message attempts to assure us that it will be given all due consideration on both sides. Regardless, this does place the Prime Minister in a rather delicate position. For decades our people have had the Nazi boot stamped on our throats, and there are many in the nation and government who would gladly fight the German rather than speak with them; but as much as some of our more recalcitrant citizens might wish for our two nations to glower and scowl at each other from across the sea, this is not a viable long term solution.\n\nFurther still, while we have succeeded in throwing off the tyrant's yoke once, our current military forces are infantile compared to the bloated German war machine; perhaps a treaty would do what a division of tanks could not?"

Words such as sovereignty, dignity, rights, interests, and more adorn the letter from top to bottom, notably all in contrast of or in reference to us. Ignoring their attempts at diplomatic insults, the contents of the letter is in fact quite promising! They seem to have accepted our overtures at diplomatic negotiations and are interested in pursuing a formal meeting between our representatives, preferably as soon as we are able. Though much work now lays between us and a successful conference with the Norwegians, this is an excellent first step towards managing control of the region. Not only does this spare us engaging military forces in Scandinavia, it indicates that the Norwegians are aware of their precarious position and seek to avoid any overt conflict, in politics or otherwise. This gives us the obvious advantage. Even so, there could be wisdom in refraining from pushing them too hard with any demands, for if they don't maintain their display of 'sovereignty' they might be pushed to abandon the negotiations altogether and force more... unsavory methods at resolution.\n\nRegardless of the goal, all that we need to do now is put on a smile, act polite, and engage in some bloodless - if not painless - realpolitik."

The closing statement of the missive in fact reads that their "...inherent rights of national sovereignty and dignity were demonstrated quite clearly once, and the German people surely do not need to be reminded again", to clear any lingering doubt about the message's true meaning.\n\nIt surprised no one in Germania that the Norwegians resented us, this much was known, but what no one was truly ready to accept was the possibility that they'd spit on the hand holding the olive branch. Their nation is unstable and their ability to resist an invasion is feeble at best; it's difficult to determine if this is a calculated move or a flash of madness.\n\nUltimately, all this does is narrow down our choice of response. Norway is valuable, in resources and strategic position, but we must determine if its value is greater or lesser than the effort it would take to retrieve it; and yet still another variable in this equation of state is the insult this refusal's very existence imposes on us.

Advocating for this locale will be seen as advocating for a position of strength to the German people and - more importantly - our support in the halls of government. Bringing the Norwegians to our table in our territory will please our supporters to no end, though Norway will take notable offence at the suggestion and the signalling of the lack of neutrality.\n\nThe second option, suggested both by the Norwegians and our intelligence services, is Oslo. Going to the home of our opponents after they detached themselves from us might signal weakness to some in Germany, but it will undoubtedly foster goodwill and bring them to believe we are sincere in our purpose. Further, if negotiations sour, our presence in the capitol will embolden our loyalists in Norway and perhaps assist in future operations in the area.\n\nFinally, as an overture to the spirit of good faith, the conference can be held at Göteborg in Sweden. This is a neutral meeting place and, with the Swedes acting as moderators, will be seen by both Norway and Sweden as a commitment to improving relations in all of Scandinavia, though perhaps less intently than if we simply went to Oslo."

Germany, a superpower by right, has come in the interest of peace in Scandinavia and laying the foundation for relations to last the remainder of its 'thousand years'. Norway, a land who just months ago was under the thumb of the Nazi hegemony, successfully slipped its bonds and comes to fortify its future in the shadow of the goliath. Though the haggling of details leading up to the conference might've seemed like a battle, it is waged in the name of avoiding a war. By extending one another the olive branch it is hoped that the swords will stay in their sheaths, though if their animosities flare there is no telling what will become of the Scandinavian Peninsula.\n\nFor now though, the opening ceremony and first rounds of negotiations, both in front of cameras and behind closed doors, will proceed in the hopes of peace over the coming days.

The German military is relaxing along the North Sea, and the Norwegian people are collectively breathing a sigh of relief for perhaps the first time in decades. The Prime Minister of Norway has lauded the ambassadors who attended the conference and spoken publicly in support of the results, whilst simultaneously the Führer has paraded this diplomatic victory to the acclaim of Germania. Though the true opinions of the delegates and ambassadors will forever be veiled behind their smiles, it would seem they too are looking forward to furthering their craft and normalizing relations between their nations.\n\nAlready, newsprinters across Europe and the world relay the revelations; all look towards the German and Scandinavian spheres with new interest."

The lead negotiators themselves have been found in diametrically opposed positions, neither side willing to give ground in the arbitration, and what was once thought to be the hope of peace in Scandinavia has come crashing down around them. Simple disagreements have become verbal disputes, and verbal disputes have, in at least one instance, become physical altercations.\n\nThroughout the negotiations the ambassadors generally managed to maintain propriety and politeness, but the uncompromising nature of the latest round of discussion laid bare the contempt each side had for the others' position. As one particularly recalcitrant pair of junior delegates had to be pulled apart, the signal that this attempt at compromise would never bear fruit was clear for all to see, and the Norwegian delegation left the conference in practiced defiance.\n\nBoth parties now return to their seats of power, empty in hand and low on patience; a microcosm of their respective nations' attitudes towards one another.

 bormann.1070.desc:0 "The latest round of debates in the conference have resulted in an excellent concession to our side of the delegation; Norway has accepted giving the Kriegsmarine full docking rights to their ports and the wider Wehrmacht garrisoning throughout their nation.\n\nWith this, in the case of the conference eventually ratifying Norway's return to the Pakt, we will regain full strategic dominance of the west half of the Scandinavian peninsula as well as further air and sea control of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. This was one of our most desired goals of the conference, and to gain it in full is a boon we will not squander.\n\nAside from the material military benefits this affords us, it also grants us great political power both within Norway and Germania. With garrisons throughout the nation we will be able to resist Norway potentially distancing itself in the future, and by securing these basing rights the admiralty won't be able to say we do not support them."

 bormann.1071.t:0 "Norway Demands Fairer Terms"
 bormann.1071.desc:0 "There's been a slight hiccup in negotiations with the Norwegians over the past week.\n\nNorway understands - rightfully - that the Kriegsmarine must be allowed to dock at Norwegian ports and make use of their harbour facilities, but the Norwegian delegation has been quite adamant in their refusal to allow the Wehrmacht to station a wider permanent garrison within their borders. Though attempts were made at discovering how flexible the term 'permanent garrison' could be, it seems that the Scandinavians have little to no interest in stationing German armed forces on their land. This is undoubtedly a result of previous military traumas in Norway, and it is unlikely that they can be made to freely come to terms on this issue.\n\nHowever, it could still be possible to wean them towards accepting the basing of 'military sailors' in camps 'near' the ports themselves. While it's unlikely we could get away with hosting an armored company, this potential compromise would allow us to maintain some degree of direct military control should the need arise, all while maintaining the Norwegians' sense of sovereignty. We've gotten them to accept most of our demands so far, and pushing further on this will surely test our diplomatic abilities, but leaving Norway without a direct Heer presence - no matter how small - is incompatible with the region's continued stability."
 bormann.1071.a:0 "Our relationship is fundamentally strategic, a full garrison is required."
 bormann.1071.b:0 "A few brigades on shore leave is surely more agreeable."

 bormann.1072.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Bulge"
 bormann.1072.desc:0 "The Germans have never had qualms about flaunting their belligerence, and the recent demands from the Reich's delegation do not remedy this in the slightest. Even though we have been generous in accepting the Kriegsmarine basing in our waters and dockyards, the Germans are still demanding we also allow the rest of their armed forces full garrison rights.\n\nOnce we had drawn up the language concerning the docking rights we anticipated the rest of this matter to follow smoothly, but their zealous insistence that both of our 'national securities' rest entirely on the presence of German jackboots in Norway has sought to evaporate all of our diplomatic gains thus far. We've only just thrown off the pointless and harmful shackles of the German, and inviting their tanks back into our towns is no different than inviting the Swastika back into the Storting. Not only is this untenable to our ambassadors and delegates, the common people would resent any such concession, seeing as they bore the brunt of the German's weight in the occupation.\n\nAny attempt at compromise disintegrates on both sides, and the Germans' calls for acceptance only grow louder by the hour. With no immediate solution presenting itself, we are stuck at an impasse. We can swallow our pride and assent to allow the Germans to occupy strategic locations within Norway, in the hopes that the Germans do not renege on the accords, or we can let the conference crumble around this seemingly intractable issue."

 bormann.1073.t:0 "Germany Presents New Terms"
 bormann.1073.desc:0 "In spite of the Germans' insistence that a full national garrison is 'critical to European security', today they have chosen to present a more lenient set of terms.\n\nIt is clear that the new terms are borne only in the spirit of compromise, seeing how it is both more than we care for and less than they asked. Instead of full garrison rights for the Nazi military, they request that 'military sailors' be allowed to station in 'camps' near the Kriegsmarine in the ports and harbors. Their intent is still clear, painfully so, but through this accord we should be able to secure Norwegian safety much easier. There are those in our nation who think it treason to allow even a single German to stand on Norway's soil, but many more wish for nothing but safety from the Reich, even if we must stand aside them. Though it's not ideal - things in these times rarely are - it is a binding and paradable victory should we assent to it.\n\nStill, it would mean allowing armed Wehrmacht personnel to base - en masse - near our economically vital ports; should relations sour in the future, who knows what use they could be put towards..."

They have agreed in large parts to host our marines and sailors at the dockyards and ports, and have assented to whatever means facilitate this. Though we will be legally limited from introducing other troops outside of a defined radius from the ports, this will allow us to at least maintain operational readiness and strategic integrity in the Scandinavian peninsula.\n\nIt wasn't the resounding victory we sought, but it will at least meet the objectives of the Kriegsmarine as well as allow us to continue further negotiations with Norway. Both us and the Norwegians have shown we are willing to fight for what we need, but neither of us is above meeting the other part of the way in mutual interest. Though the Norwegians have shown determination - perhaps to a fault - we expected nothing less of a once model Aryan Reichskommissariat."

 bormann.1075.t:0 "Germany Presents a Pakt Economic Program"
 bormann.1075.desc:0 "Now that immediate matters have been settled, the second series of programs have been brought forth to the convention. The German delegation has come with the proposal of a somewhat staggering series of economic and industrial pacts and treaties to 'explore, expand, and exploit' the economic potential in the region to 'mutually improve our nations'.\n\nTheir lofty words preceded several no-less lofty proposals: The introduction of a shared market program with current and future Pakt nation-states, pinning Norway's currency to the Reichsmark off the exchange in Germania, mandating the use of German-made industrial tools and quality standards, integrating continental German dockyards for all naval construction, and much more besides.\n\nThe Norwegian delegation's eyes widened into dinner plates reading the list of 'suggestions' in what can only be described as a Nazi Corporation's wet dream. It became clear to any reader with even a modicum of economic knowledge that this series of proposals would render Norway dependent on the Reich economically, guaranteeing a long-term relationship. If the hypothetical projections are to be believed, however, it would result in large and relatively immediate benefits for the average Norwegian business owner, so long as the nation does not mind tying their future to Germany's.\n\nNow that the cards are on the table, the parties involved lean in to their compatriots in hushed whispers as the negotiations begin in earnest once again."

 bormann.1076.desc:0 "Norway accepts! Aside from minor and marginal details, the Norwegian delegation has accepted the proposal in full.\n\nThis is excellent news for the prospects of the Norwegian economy, but more importantly, it is a true gift to Germany. After the press signalled that the conference was arriving at an understanding on the economic proposals, the Berlin stock exchange underwent a minor upswing. Already, the heads of German industry are sending their representatives across the Baltic and North seas to meet with potential development partners and investors in the region in the hopes of securing vital industries and contracts once the political deal is finalized and enacted.\n\nThough the conference is not over yet, this indicates that a long and prosperous relationship between our peoples lies ahead; it requires only that we follow through and seek it out, together."

 bormann.1077.t:0 "Norway Demands Fairer Terms"
 bormann.1077.desc:0 "Unfortunately, it would seem that perhaps the Norwegian delegation is not ready to assent to the terms proposed earlier concerning the integration of our economic interests. Qualms over such issues as 'tenuous demand', 'impossible economics', and even 'fiscal terrorism' were raised in some of the more private meetings at the convention.\n\nEven if they choose not to see the prosperity our offer inherently brings, they have not yet left the negotiating table. They are interested in the potential opening of our markets to one another, but evidently they demand far 'fairer' terms such as not binding their currency to ours or removing the strictest mandates on production and use. The economic advisors we have brought to the delegation warn that by agreeing we ensure the region's growth will decelerate, but we must consider the possibility that it would behoove us to have a substandard policy in place than none at all."

Any economic threats we levy are feeble without another open market for us to safely engage with, and the Germans know this well. In all areas of the proposals, it seems the Germans refuse to give an inch where we need a mile.\n\nWe have been handed an ultimatum, one that will not be resolved well in either case. We can assent to the original demands in full and practically monetarily sew our nations together at the hip for the foreseeable future, or refuse the demands and be left without any form of economic treaty with the neighboring superpower, and likely the collapse of the conference as well.\n\nThe delegates are leaving the closed meetings now to deliver their reports."

 bormann.1079.t:0 "Germany Presents New Terms"
 bormann.1079.desc:0 "News arriving from the conference today indicates a shift in the stances from the German delegation regarding their latest round of extreme demands. In another back-room meeting discussing the finer details of the hypothetical treaty, the Germans dropped their stand-offish attitudes and instead offered an amended version of the proposals that would waive several of the more draconian measures. Norwegian currency would no longer be pinned to the Reichsmark for a start, and other industrial collaboration would actually favor the common Norwegian in several instances as opposed to the few strictly corporate benefits Norway may have received otherwise. Though they are loath to give any ground, the Germans appear to have realized the value a fairer treaty affords everyone.\n\nEven so, there are parts of the economic projects that do not benefit us in the short term at all, as well as the peripheral understanding that acceptance means we will be dependent on them in trade for years to come. At this point though, holding out for a better deal does not seem to be in the cards, and the rest of the conference cannot continue without a definitive solution to Norway's economic situation."
 bormann.1079.a:0 "For the time being it is affordable. Inform the delegation."
 bormann.1079.b:0 "Norway cannot sustain even these measures, it must be refused."

 bormann.1080.desc:0 "The Norwegians are as the glaciers of their homeland - cold and resolute in the face of all our calls of bargain and reason - but even glaciers retreat in time.\n\nAs hours turned into afternoons, the latest negotiations were thought to be in danger of becoming irrevocably mired in details and conflicting demands. Even as leading economic attachés from the Pakt made clear that Scandinavia lacked the capital, workforce, or technical expertise to survive alone as a modern economy, it was almost believed that our translators were sabotaging us, such was the resistance to the economic integration that was proposed. However, with the newly amended proposals, such as allowing their currency to float without being pinned to the Reichsmark, it would seem that the interminably cold reception has finally thawed.\n\nAll their posturing was simply that, a rather bold attempt to take every inch from us they could be allowed before either of us reached the breaking point. Even now the members of the conference are concluding the final alterations to the now-accepted economic deal, and relief is a widely felt emotion in the conference hall. Some may call it greedy of Norwegians - and several of our delegates have said so privately - but so long as this amended deal produces value for the peoples of Norway and Germany it will help ultimately secure the conference, and that itself is worth much more than mere Reichsmarks."

It has been coming for weeks, slowly and steadily building in the halls of the conference, the crescendo of our nations wills and - with a modicum of finesse - its ensuing finale. All other accords have been met, any surviving compromises have been accepted, and the capstone of the meeting may now make itself known.\n\nAfter a cordial declaration of gratitude to the Norwegians for their acts of diplomacy, the day's business was proposed to the filled delegation hall. The first - and only - motion presented by the Germans was thus; a full invitation to the nation of Norway to rejoin the Einheitspakt.\n\nBy reembracing the Pakt, the two nations would be sworn to mutual defense, to commit to embracing common laws domestic and international, and - most prominently - to stand in opposition to the enemies of Nazism around the globe. This proposal was not a shock to any of the men gathered in the conference that day, but its weight was not dismissed or lost on any of them. The results of this German demand would have resounding repercussions. Norway in the Pakt would project German power to Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia, as well the British Isles; even the Americans in Iceland will also undoubtedly feel the ripples of this action wash upon their shores.\n\nAs the German ambassador solemnly finished his closing remarks, he relinquished the floor and rejoined his delegation to prepare for any... terse negotiations that would follow. The Norwegians mirrored this, rapidly forming a preliminary consensus as they too prepared for the coming days - and weeks - of resolving this demand."

While the revels were underway, the gritty details of their acceptance were being formalized by communications between the Norwegians and their government as well as the party bureaucracy back in Germania. While the success of the garrison and economic deals were foundational, this is truly the crowning achievement of the summit.\n\nWith this victory we can show to the Reich's citizens, the Pakt, and the wider world that Germany's power is neither temporary nor receding - rather it is eternal and growing by the year. While our Norwegian brothers have certainly not been model members of the Reich's community, this could mark a turning point. Moving forward, our peoples will be united in goal and vision; this treaty will do what tanks could not."

 bormann.1083.desc:0 "It was known going into this week's crucible of negotiations that getting the Norwegians to return to the fold would be a near-Herculean task, and the resistance of the Norwegian delegation did not disappoint. According to their protests, the fundamental reasoning behind their nation accepting to attend a meeting of equals was to secure their future, not ours. They decry that by being forced back into the Einheitspakt, they would be forfeiting theirs and all future generations of Norwegians' "freedom".\n\nThey do not understand; so long as even a single enemy of Nazism stands, none can be truly "free". Yet, maddeningly, whenever we elucidate this point to them they push back harder than before. They have nowhere to run and we've already proven our good faith in our terms so far, so even if they cannot accept that we are fighting for the common interests of our race just yet, perhaps there are methods by which we can meet in the middle. Suggestions of permitting Norway to be granted "Pakt Observer Status" have been made, a measure that will herd them into our fold but still grant them their degrees of leeway in interacting with the wider world, even if they would not be made to observe all Pakt member laws and orders. Still, they have no other harbor in which to turn. The Reich stands astride Europe, Nazism is stronger than ever, and we stand willing to shelter them; by pressing the issue further they will surely realize the futility of resistance to the coming future."

We've come so far into the conference that the safety and security that the treaty would afford us is finally within our grasp, but by presenting this ultimatum all of it could be for nought. If we refuse, nothing protects us from the Germans - who have demonstrated throughout the conference their open lust for our union with them - or otherwise would leave our nation economically abandoned.\n\nPerhaps worse still, if we accept we would be signing away large degrees of our national sovereignty, liberty, and simple dignity. For as far as we can envision into the future our nations would be intertwined, militarily, economically, and politically. In a nuclear age where a single misstep by the arrogant Nazis - or the retribution of their enemies - could spell the end of their entire alliance, it is perhaps more dangerous to join them then spurn them. All attempts at delaying the German delegation from demanding an answer are begging to break down, and if they are not presented with a response they are not likely to continue the conference at all."

They have proposed that, failing full reintegration to the Pakt, we could be offered 'Observer Status' within it. This would mean that we would have to adopt certain regulations and diplomatic stances endemic to the German's alliance, but we would be allowed to retain large measures of our autonomy and freedom in Scandinavia, Europe, and the wider world to a degree. We would be openly declaring our allegiance to those we struggled against for decades, but we would be afforded mutual-defense and market access, things that we would stridently benefit from.\n\nThis being a notable concession - as well as likely the most sought demand of the Reich - any further negotiation on the subject is not likely to bear any fruit. It would seem, then, that our delegation finds itself at a crossroads; accept membership in the Nazi community and all the risk that entails, or refuse outright and risk suffering the results of a failed conference."

Though it is a concession to not have Norway re-enter our alliance as a fully-fledged member nation, its Observer Status will meet all our of our immediate strategic goals in the region, as well as lay the foundation for furthering diplomatic progress in the future; perhaps with this coming taste they will see the wisdom in joining in full, one day.\n\nRegardless, this means that all of the capstone accords and goals of the summit have met with success, in one way or another, and has proven the conference's worth many times over by finding a way to please all parties involved."

Praise was liberally lauded upon Norway's people for our exemplary dedication to our shared national values and so on and so forth; it wasn't until the latter half of the brief memo was read that the true nature of the message made itself lucid to our foreign minister. The Germans have extended an offer to our nation to unilaterally rejoin the Einheitspakt, the Reich's hemispheric alliance, as soon as in the coming days and weeks at the earliest.\n\nThis is not something to be taken lightly. While we are more similar to the Nazis of the continent than we are different, we are not certain if we should stand by them at this time. We only just achieved what many in Norway sought for decades, sovereignty, and by rejoining the Pakt we would be ceding much of our newfound lateral powers to Germania's direction. Further, while it would be puissant to join our ideological allies in this dangerous world, there do exist differences in our goals, both material and political. It takes only a cursory glance to see what the extremes of Nazism have wrought upon Europe and the wider world, and if we join them we would be binding ourselves to the very thing we are trying to reform. Regardless, a cold war rages all around us and now by casting off from the Pakt we expose our nation to all the forces that would seek our downfall; Germany, least of all, would certainly not take such a response kindly."

Already, bureaucratic and party forces are making the necessary arrangements so as to smoothly facilitate the expansion of the Pakt, and a personal letter of gratitude from the office of the Führer is being drafted for delivery to the Norwegian heads of government. With this, our control of Northern Europe solidifies, and our ability to project military and diplomatic forces over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the wider continent return to their rightful status. More than one voice dissented as to the prospects of the Norwegians rejoining us in arms; it was feared that with their newfound sovereignty their judgement would be clouded and perhaps reject our hegemony.\n\nWisely, they realized - just as all will eventually realize - that the Reich's might is not temporary, nor fading; it is eternal and growing by the day."

It was honestly believed that as a result of the Norwegians rather dire straits they would accept membership in our international community, gladly or otherwise, but perhaps it was naive to assume so. Norway's new government has made clear to all watching that they disapprove of our true brand of National Socialism and seek to develop their own 'national destiny'; this declination is the natural outcome of our guiding absence and is evidence enough of their present and future failings.\n\nFailing to return Norway to our geo-political sphere will have lasting consequences; direct control of the North Sea and our ability to project power over the Scandinavian Peninsula will be undermined.

Stahlecker, while subservient to the Führer, shares much in common with him: Both men have served their duties with impeccable devotion, both men are loyally attached to the conservative wing of the NSDAP, and both men have triumphed over their respective rebels."

His stomach rumbled with an animalistic groan, begging Tauscher for the breakfast he'd had to skip. Why had Stahlecker called this meeting at such short notice?\n\nHe blew on his clammy hands and rubbed them together with vigour. As usual, Heidi had hidden his gloves the evening before. It had become the morning routine for Tauscher to humour his daughter's silly little game and hunt for the gloves, but unsurprisingly she was still tucked into bed, and there was no time to go rummaging. Which genius had decided to organize this meeting for 5am?\n\n"Herr Tauscher?" came a reedy voice, suddenly pulling him out of his thoughts. A stranger stood before him, dark trench coat billowing in the wind. The gentleman's nose was tinged red from the cold wind, and a polite smile was stretched widely across his face. Tauscher was just about to respond when a blinding pain exploded across the back of his head, and darkness enveloped him.\n\nFlashes of light. Shouts of anger. Screams of mercy. Tauscher felt as though he were floating across the floor. He heard a voice he recognised, screaming about a diary. Reinhard Schmidt? A gunshot rang out. There was silence. Tauscher suddenly jolted forwards and landed on the cold hard floor. White-hot agony. He staggered to his feet, the stony walls closing in on him. He turned around to the uniformed man blocking the doorway of the cell and dropped down to his knees in prayer for the first time in decades.\n\nTwo shots rang out, echoing throughout the corridors for all to hear. Orpo officers heard it as they played card games next to the cells. Deputies heard it as they whispered their final thoughts. Ministers heard it as they hastily tied their shoelace nooses, hoping against hope that the torturers would not return.

Like the Trojan Horse of Greek myth, this liberal infiltrated his way into the cabinet of Heinrich Lohse with lies and deception, promoting vaguely reformist policies. As the conflict in the Reichskommissariat escalated into furious mayhem, Meyer-Landrut forged his own path, crushing his foes against all the odds.\n\nThis degenerate represents the antithesis of National Socialist doctrine. This man, a manipulative liberal who desires to improve the living conditions of the Slavic scum in Ostland, stands firmly to the left of even Albert Speer and his acolytes. Of all the potential conquerors of the Civil War, it is Meyer-Landrut who provides the greatest ideological threat. If reformists see one of their own ruling over a powerful Reichskommissariat, they may gain the confidence to crawl out from under their filthy rocks and start preaching ever-more radical ideologies."

With his sharp suit and slicked back hair, the new ruler of Ostland looked the figure of respectability. The group took their places at the meeting table as Walther Hewel cleared his throat.\n\n"We appreciate your arrival," Hewel began. "Needless to say, it was not an easy decision to grant immunity to your government, considering our... ideological differences. Were it not for the Führer, we may never have even considered it."\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Meyer-Landrut nodded towards Bormann, trying to hide his surprise. "I understand this situation is a difficult one."\n\n"It's time to look forward," Bormann waved the statement away dismissively. He plucked up a document and studied it intensely. "Your land reforms have proven to be most controversial. They go against the very concept of Germanization itself. As for the issue of 'native rights'... are these reports true? Do you really stand by these reforms?" Ulrich Sahm shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Oskar Schindler raised an eyebrow and turned to Hans von Herwarth, who was defiantly staring at Bormann.\n\nAt last, Meyer-Landrut shrugged. "Yes. We do."\n\n"Then so be it," Bormann sighed.

His men and him had shared two cars on the journey to the meeting. Why were there five? One for each of them?\n\nA burst of muffled cries broke out behind him. He whipped his head around just in time to see the black bag over Ulrich Sahm's head shaking side-to-side as two Orpo officers grappled him. Before he could react, Meyer-Landrut's vision was painted black as something tight was thrust over him. Both arms were wrenched back as cold metal was pressed against his wrists. He was thrown forwards into something cramped and humid, his shouts answered only by a heavy slam overhead.\n\nMartin Bormann watched from the window with growing satisfaction as the liberals were handcuffed and carted off.

Under the competent guidance of Hinrich Lohse, Ostland had been loyal to Hitler and the Reich, becoming a model colony for Germanization. With the ascendancy of Jeckeln and his Schutzstaffel cohorts, however, its connections to Germania have been severed, and the National Socialist ideals that made it so strong have been torn out and replaced with the totalitarian nightmare of the Burgundian System. This madman's fanaticism towards the principles of Himmler and his Ordensstaat fiefdom is overshadowed only by his pure hatred for Martin Bormann and the Party.\n\nThe Ostland crisis has become a topic of fiery debate in the upper echelons of German politics. The Reformist wings of the NSDAP and the Wehrmacht alike have capitalized on the political chaos by drawing ominous parallels between the SS thugs to the east and the radical Militarists within Germania. Are Jeckeln's rants about purifying his newly conquered land of its so-called traitors any different from the many speeches of Hermann Göring during the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg? Is Jeckeln's treasonous rhetoric regarding the failure of the eastern Reichskommissariats so dissimilar from the tone of Ferdinand Schörner? Would anyone deny a correlation between the anti-Hitlerist tenets of the Burgundian System and the proposed form of 'true National Socialism' as espoused by the Militarists?\n\nThese arguments are guaranteed to boost the popularity of the Reformists, to the fury of their Militarist foes."

There is no question that Himmler and Jeckeln will stop at nothing to further stretch their black tentacles across Europe's fertile land, despoiling it with their revisionist filth. The Führer's highest military officers have advised him that precautions must be made for violent actions against the Fatherland.\n\nWith a violent rattling of their sabres, the radical militarists within the Party and the Wehrmacht have seized upon this new security threat with their usual fervour. They have openly stoked fears of an Ostland invasion of the Reich and are predicting that the other Reichskommissariats will soon collapse into sinister Burgundian fortresses. Jeckeln was supposedly emboldened by the weak state of the German army, and only by meeting the militarists' demands can we prevent further civil wars and SS plots throughout Europe.

Drechsler and his men milled around the table, eying up the chairs as if they were meals on a restaurant menu, before selecting their seats. The militarist did not even glance towards Bormann, instead keeping his gaze firmly on Walther Hewel. Bormann cleared his throat. "Herr Drechsler, as my Reich Ministry for Foreign Affairs has informed you and your cabinet, I am willing to increase the conscription of the Ostland army."\n\n"Your numbers are not even close to what I requested!" Drechsler had shifted his scowl from the Foreign Secretary to the Führer with the false bravado of a man who had accidentally stumbled into a pack of lions. "Why do you continue to deny me?

In front of him was a blank sheet with the Reichsadler header marking it as an official missive from the Reichskanzlei to the Italian Empire: he had tried to convince his secretary to handle the issue as usual - or, more precisely, to "write all the niceties those haughty bastards like so much" - but his aide been adamant: for such a momentous circumstance, a hand-written letter from the Führer was the best choice.\n\nFor a moment, he was tempted to simply give up, but he would have lost face with his own government, and with the entire world. Nonetheless, making the first step still felt like a humiliation for the proud Bormann: while politics and intrigue were his mother tongue, he had never been one for international diplomacy. The Reich was destined to rule over the world, why bother with petty squabbles and traitorous partners? Still, after the civil war there was little left of that Reich, which brought him back to his current predicament.\n\nSighing, he steeled his resolve. He had to do this. His mind made, he started reflecting upon what to write. The Italians were adept diplomats - even he had to admit that keeping together an alliance of nations that were at each other's throats most of the time for almost fifteen years was quite the feat - and they clearly held a grudge against Germany, which meant that he had to be cautious not to fail even before beginning.\n\nAs he pondered, an idea struck his mind. When the Axis was still an actual alliance, he had studied a bit of Italian, if only to make a good impression on the dignitaries that regularly visited Germania when it was still called Berlin: perhaps he could use this to endear his potential interlocutors to him? Yes! That was the solution! Or at least a start... still, better than nothing. He bathed the nib in the inkwell, and began."

To this end, he invites us to send a diplomatic delegation to Germania for the first time in almost two decades.\n\nWhile sudden, this change in tone is far from unexpected. The German Reich has been devastated by the civil war, and can no longer afford its old domineering stance over Europe: with most of its colonies and puppet regimes lost or no longer willing to accept German authority and exploitation, the Reich needs new trade partners to sustain its recovering economy, and the Italian Empire - the largest surviving European economy - is the ideal candidate.\n\nThe Ministry's cabinet council suggests extreme caution.

Of course, the Italian diplomats had been impeccable, bringing gifts worthy of a leader of his stature: a golden, Reichsadler-shaped centerpiece for Bormann's office from the Duce, and an ancient, miniated copy of the Nibelungenlied from Emperor Umberto II.\n\nObviously, Martin Bormann had given the Italians ample proof that he, too, could be a courteous host. The Marble Corridor of the Reichskanzlei had been turned into an impromptu banquet hall, where the two delegations were now feasting with the finest foods from all of the Pakt - the drinks were courtesy of Umberto's own wine cellar - and mingling with each other: the guest of honor at the Führer's right was the Italian Ambassador, while his own Foreign Reichsminister was sitting at his left. Drinking from a glass of fine Lambrusco, Bormann decided it was time to know his opponent better.\n\n"How do you find the roast, Ambassador?" he asked in what he hoped was good - if a bit guttural - Italian.\n\n"Wonderful as expected, Führer, just as your mastery of our tongue." his guest replied in perfect, unaccented German, bowing his head slightly in gratitude, "however, it would please me immensely if we continued our conversation in German: it has been so long since the last time I practiced it..."\n\nBormann mentally rolled his eyes. As expected from those damned diplomats, complimenting him, saving him from embarrassment and subtly accusing him of having refused an Ambassador until now, all in the same period.

 bormann.3903.desc:0 "Ambassador Gastone Guidotti was used to diplomatic meetings and parties, but he still had to admit to himself that he was surprised. Traveling to Germania, he'd had ample time to reflect upon the reason for his appointment: Italy and Germany had been bitter enemies for almost two decades, and his experience would be much useful in the coming talks. His task was to assuage the truthfulness of the Führer's declarations, and whether there would be any chance of a dètente with the German Reich. Of course, no one expected the two countries to form a new alliance, but cordial relationships would be a satisfying start.\n\nNow however, Guidotti had to admit that perhaps Martin Bormann actually meant what he had written on the invitation. He had received a lavish welcome at the Reichskanzlei, and the Führer's gifts - an ancient Roman bronze vase found near Wien for the Duce, and a miniated manuscript of the Aeneid for King Umberto II - had been tasteful. After the welcoming ceremony and his accreditation, they were now dining in the luxurious Marble Salon within the Reichskanzlei, the Ambassador sitting at Bormann's right.\n\nThe host had proved an interesting conversation partner, and his knowledge of Italian - though a bit childish - had been welcome. Still, twenty years of rivalry don't end with just a fancy dinner: the Germans needed to understand the errors of their past ways for any meaningful progress to be made, and only one topic would give him the answer he had been sent for.\n\n"Führer Bormann," he began in German, his tone unchanged from the light conversation they were having before, "Our countries have a long history of friendship and brotherhood, but they have been separated, as if by a country. Switzerland."\n\nThe Ambassador didn't fail to notice how the Führer and the man sitting in front of Guidotti - the German Foreign Minister - visibly tensed, both surprised at the sudden shift in the conversation.\n\n"Like our Helvetic friends, so was our relationship threatened, encircled, and humiliated, until it became a hostile land." His tone, despite the smile, was serious now: "Do tell me, Führer, who do you consider responsible for such a heinous violation of trust between friends and allies?""

Out of the corner of his eye, Bormann could see his Foreign Minister begging him with his eyes to make the right choice, and the silence that had fallen into the room told him that everyone had heard the question. Dozens of eyes were upon him, and he knew that the answer would either save the conference, or sentence it to a quick and painful death.\n\nOf course, the Führer had his own idea - that Switzerland was an abomination that should not have ever existed - but he'd never say it. The Ambassador wanted him to admit that the Reich had wronged Italy. The easy way out was to lay the blame on his former rival, Hermann Göring: he had been the one to begin the hostile rhetoric, and the Ambassador would have surely accepted such an answer, but it still equalled to say that the Germans had been responsible.\n\nBormann thought about the potential alternatives. The relations between Italy and the United States were always a sore point, perhaps they'd be happy hearing him insult an enemy? Also, there was the eternal trump card: since fascism and National Socialism share many common tenets, perhaps he could accuse the Jews - the Swiss ones especially - of having tampered with the German economy? After a few seconds of reflection, Bormann answered the Ambassador's question."

They wanted to sow dissent between our two great countries, and so they sent provocators to Switzerland, to force our hand!"\n\nAmbassador Guidotti couldn't believe his ears. Did that barbarian truly think he would believe such a blatant lie? From the face of the German Foreign Minister, who appeared to wish for the earth to open and swallow him, the man was thinking the same thing: a pity that he wasn't the one conducting the talks. He was tempted to leave that table immediately - an insult to him was an insult to the Italian Empire, and therefore unacceptable - but he wasn't one to give up immediately. He would give the buffoon another chance.\n\n"Do tell me, Führer" he argued, still as polite as ever, though it cost him every ounce of his being, "what would the Americans have gained from provoking the Reich?"\n\nWatching that triumphant expression being washed away from Bormann's face was already a small triumph for Guidotti, so he pressed on.\n\n"Their fleet destroyed by nuclear fire," he added, sipping with nonchalance from his glass, "Their army devastated, their economy in shambles. Why would they have purposefully threatened to start another war?" He asked rhetorically: "The fact that our relationship with the United States is far from ideal doesn't mean that I will rejoice at such unfounded accusations. Don't you agree?"\n\nAt the end of his speech, the Ambassador looked Martin Bormann in the eye, waiting for his answer. This, he thought, is why politicians make abysmal diplomats. Then, he heard something move under the table near the Minister, and the Führer suddenly flinched as if in pain. He barely repressed a laugh: the man had guts, did he really kick the Führer on the shin? He must have been desperate... Bormann looked at his Minister with hate, then he composed himself and prepared to answer."

Oh, he already had something in mind, something about a boot and Guidotti's behind, but before he could talk he felt an explosion of pain in his shin. He looked at his Minister with hate - did he really dare to kick him?! - but sadly, he had to recognize he was right: he couldn't send all of this to hell just because the Ambassador couldn't understand basic truths.\n\nThe choice was his once again. He could swallow his pride once again, listening to his minister's concern - and his equally persuasive foot - and admitting that the Germans - or better, that Göring - had been the cause of the end of the Stahlpakt, or he could stand his ground with that upstart diplomat and show him who holds the world's destinies in the palm of his hand..."

For the first time in his long diplomatic career, he was at a loss for words. Calmly, he finished his wine, but when the server came to refill his glass, he politely declined. By the way the German Foreign Minister paled, he had understood the meaning behind his gesture: indeed, that poor man was a skilled diplomat, a pity that he had to work for such an uneducated brute. A quick glance to his aide said all that was to be said, but he wanted - no, he needed - to enjoy this to the fullest.\n\n"Führer Bormann, I thank you for your honest answer. Truly, it has been enlightening. I'm afraid, however, that I have overstayed your gracious hospitality, and I need to leave."\n\n"Leave? Now? But we still have to meet for the conference!" Bormann's voice betrayed his surprise, but ignorance wasn't an excuse, not in that case.\n\n"There will be no conference, Führer. I have been sent here to see whether the Reich had learnt from its past mistakes" the Ambassador was direct now, all pretense of courtesy gone. "Instead, I have found what my predecessors left twenty years ago: arrogance, incompetence and greed crudely disguised under a veneer of civilization. I have tried my best to be understanding, but you have insulted me twice, and this is something that I cannot forgive. Farewell, Führer Bormann."\n\nAs soon as he had finished, the Ambassador rose from his seat.

 bormann.3909.t:0 "A Predictable Outcome"
 bormann.3909.desc:0 "As he passed the Brennero border post, Ambassador Guidotti felt at home, and not just in a physical sense. His experience in Germania had taught him - or rather, reminded him - that the Reich was not yet ready to face the civilized world once more: indeed, one did not need scientific proof that the Germans were of Aryan descent: just as their ancestors, they were uncivilized, arrogant, belligerent and hell-bent on the destruction of all things fine, even themselves.\n\nAs he looked at the Italian soldiers hurriedly repositioning the road barriers, he felt a pang of sadness. It could have gone differently, if not for the utter unwillingness of the German so-called "diplomats" to even consider admitting their responsibility: diplomacy is first and foremost compromise, how can there be diplomacy when the other demands nothing but obedience?\n\nThe sadness he felt quickly became indignation. He had parlayed with diplomats from Iberia to Japan and the United States, and everywhere he had gone throughout his long career in service to Italy, he had always found respect and openness from his counterparts, no matter their official stance towards his homeland: how did the Germans think they would be able to return a world-leading nation, if they can't even convince their direct neighbor - and former closest ally - to open an embassy?\n\nAs the mountains of Trentino gave way to the verdant hills of Veneto, Gastone Guidotti felt those negative emotions slowly ebb away. He had done his duty, and he would keep doing so, no matter his task. One avenue had been closed, but many more remained open, and he would make sure that they remained that way: the Italian Empire was ascendant, and there was no place for old relics such as the Reich in this new world. He only hoped that the Germans would understand it, before it was too late."

One thing bugged him, however: why did his Minister suddenly pale?\n\n"Führer Bormann, I thank you for your honest answer" Guidotti interrupted his train of thought. "Truly, it has been enlightening. I'm afraid, however, that I have overstayed your gracious hospitality, and I need to leave"\n\n"Leave? Now? But we still have to meet for the conference!" Bormann's voice betrayed his surprise.\n\n"There will be no conference, Führer.

"Instead, I have found what my predecessors left twenty years ago: arrogance, incompetence and racism crudely disguised under a veneer of civilization. There will be no reconciliation until you truly understand the depth you and the Reich have fallen into. Farewell, Führer Bormann."\n\nAs soon as he had finished, the Ambassador rose from his seat. Martin Bormann did the same, his face red, but Guidotti stared him down, silently daring him to strike a diplomat: when the Führer didn't move, the envoy left, immediately followed by his delegation, and silence fell into the room. Each passing second, Bormann could feel his pulse quickening, his vision blurring and turning... turning RED.\n\n"I HAVE SPENT THREE MONTHS PLANNING ALL THIS!" his voice shattered the immobile air, "I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO GET THOSE BASTARDS HERE! WHY DID THEY LEAVE? WHY?!"\n\n"Of course, my Führer, they never truly wanted to sign any agreement! They just wanted to humiliate you to get some support at home for their decadent government..." the Minister was quick to answer, in a desperate bid to save his place in the government - and his head.\n\n"TRAITORS! ALL ITALIANS ARE TRAITORS! THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES!" the Führer screamed, veins popping on his neck and forehead, and everyone would hurry to obey, if they cared for their life..."

With him gone, however, we can once more bring our great nations together, for the betterment of all!"\n\nAmbassador Guidotti thought about the answer he had received from the Führer, and deemed it sufficient, at least for now. Blaming the defeated pretender was a convenient way to admit the Reich's fault, while at the same time laying all the blame on the old management and denying any direct responsibility for Bormann: cunning, if a bit crude. Also, judging from the murmur coming from the German side of the delegation, such a declaration had caused some dissatisfaction: to the diplomat, this was enough.\n\n"Indeed, Führer Bormann, it is as you say." He agreed with a slight nod, rewarding his host, "It is sad how all this destruction and suffering are the work of a single man. Still, now he can no longer harm anyone, and our two countries can finally start to let go of the past, and forge a new future together."\n\nHe allowed the Führer a few moments to gloat - men such as him were predictable, and as long as they were satisfied, they would sing to his tune - then he finished his wine, asking for a moderate refill to a passing server. From the Minister's grateful smile, he had understood the meaning of his gesture: a skilled diplomat indeed, a necessity to make sure that his leader didn't ruin all their hard work.\n\n"The banquet has been exquisite," Guidotti added, "Such a wonderful welcome. Still, I believe that the time for carousing is over: let us discuss the details for the preliminary agreement, then we shall feast again to our heart's content."\n\n"Of course, Ambassador!" the Foreign Minister was quick to interject, ushering them to the Führer's office.\n\nGastone Guidotti called his young aide, and the bright apprentice was quick to bring him all the needed documents.

More generic sameness; the man's name didn't even stand out. Steiner? Boch? He couldn't remember.\n\n"Enough." Bormann folded his hands. "I was called here for a briefing concerning the Middle East, not domestic affairs. I know how market prices work. Tell me about Syria, Iraq, Yemen."\n\n"Ah, yes, uh, apologies sir." The man managed to stay composed, and shuffled his massive binder of notes. "What's important to us is that the status quo is breaking down in the Middle East; it has been for months, years. You could say this started with the conflict in Yemen, but sentiment has been boiling in the Middle East for a decade now, perhaps even longer." The speaker looked at Bormann, who gave him a shrug. "Uh, but you knew that. What's important is that the revolutionaries, the Ba'athists, are fighting to overthrow the status quo. That is of course the Italian and Saudi hegemony in the region. Although our economy hurts, we have to look past temporary financial setbacks." Bormann's face turned a shade of red, but before he could speak the man continued. "Now is the time for action! The Ba'athists oppose the Saudis, Italians, and various other regional players. Geopolitically, they are currently isolated. They have however already seen many successes, and would be much deadlier if they had some modern equipment. Without assistance, the Ba'athists will lose; there's too much pressure aligned against them. The situation looks different with our intervention. Starting with small arms and support equipment, we could of course increase our flow of supplies, and consider boots on the ground as the situation develops. What we need to keep in mind is victory for the Ba'aths means defeat for the Saudis, and more importantly, Italy. Italy is dealt a HUGE economic blow, one that would be felt for years. Disrupting Saudi Arabia is an added bonus, since they work closely with Italy to maintain their hegemony. This is the moment we've been waiting for to shatter Italy's influence in the region."

What began as a shortage of oil and a dramatic spike in prices has evolved into the absolute devolution in investor confidence in the German economy. Even the grand conglomerates such as IG Farben and Siemens brace for impact and rapidly prepare plans to downsize operations.\n\nBy the day, more and more citizens find themselves jobless as even slave labour begins to lose its value. Not only do our future plans sit in jeopardy; so too does the entire state of the German economy. There are no options on the table. Action must be taken. Current and future projects cannot continue. We shall focus upon combating the crisis at hand, or we shall find ourselves reeling for a century."

Our armories, military bases, and encamped forces have all been targeted by this crippling barrage. Everything that is visible to German aerial reconnaisance appears to become a target for the Reich.\n\nThe Ba'athists are clearly the party that are meant to directly benefit from these bombings. Already, reports of their movements begin to flood in, as Ba'athist militias prepare to strike at our reeling forces. Whilst we may be able to endure the blows for now, should the bombing campaign continue, our forces will surely become swiftly exhausted as they lose the conventional means to wage war day by day."

Essential remote infrastructure is destroyed in the night. Acts of arson are frequently committed upon government offices or the estates of princes. Up until recently, these acts were committed in complete anonymity. Law enforcement officials could do nothing but react.\n\nRecently, however, it has been discovered that these acts are far less domestic than we had originally ascertained. Following a thorough investigation, it has been uncovered that these acts of sabotage were undertaken by foreign agents belonging to the Nazi HVA. The Germans, with all their resources, have even been able to recruit several dissident citizens to assist them with their acts of terror.\n\nWithout a doubt another German ploy to bring down our regime, we are utilizing as many law enforcement resources as we can divert to attempt to foil this Reich sponsored terrorism inside our borders."

All of them are veterans of some war, and although they don't speak much off duty, they carry themselves like true warriors. Many of the younger Germans that pass through our command centers are of higher rank than these men, but look upon them with much respect and awe, and unlike their other younger peers, they don't burst into anger when they aren't saluted, which has yet to be seen from these men. It is very likely from how they carry themselves (and their numerous scars) that we have veterans from the German Civil War or from Africa among us.\n\nOur new recruits hate them, to put it mildly, but the men's new training is already paying off. The men are in better physical shape, better trained, and much more competent in nearly all aspects than any of our other recruits!

According to Orpo reports delivered directly to the Führer, tensions have been simmering in universities throughout the Reich, where toxic anti-government propaganda is dripped into the ears of naive and impressionable young Germans by their fellow students and subversive academics alike. As with most student protests, the marching in Hamburg began rather pathetically and looked set to dissipate within the next day.\n\nOver time, however, the ranks of these protesters began to swell as more and more student groups joined them, carrying their cardboard signs and chanting treasonous nonsense. The protests have only grown with time, and older citizens are also beginning to march down the streets in fury.\n\nThe screeching masses writhing through the streets of Hamburg pose no real threat to us. The German people, especially the hot-blooded youth, need to let off some steam every once in a while. Such protests are not entirely unheard of, and while the demonstrations in Hamburg are admittedly larger than most, this is likely due to the current political climate. They may angrily accuse the Party of suppression and purging, but their eventual boredom will lead them back to their studies and jobs.\n\nThis is but a small thorn in our side."

The winds chill their bones as they march down the streets, chanting against the actions of the Party and the Führer. The rain drenches their huge cardboard signs as they bob up and down, informing the pedestrians of the government's faults.\n\nA deadly concoction of fear, fury and rebellion seems to course through the veins of these agitators, no matter the weather. What started as a small demonstration in Hamburg has spread throughout the Reich like a disease, infesting many major cities and universities. The Führer has instructed Werner Naumann and the Ministry for Propaganda and Public Enlightenment to completely ignore these demonstrations and focus on unifying stories instead.\n\nThe Party's patience has its limits.

Bormann's splotchy red hands had curled up so tightly they were turning white. "Now, if these protesters are truly planning to march from Wilhelmstraße to the fucking Reichstag, I assume someone competent is directing them behind the scenes?"\n\n"You're correct, my Führer. Cigarettes are far more to my taste." Gehlen exhaled some smoke with a slight grimace. "According to our reports, it is not one but many different groups conducting the upcoming demonstration in Germania. Mostly students, but not all. I've provided a detailed list in this document." He patted the chunky stack of papers before him with a pale hand.\n\n"This is absurd," Bormann growled. "I want the Orpo to block off all routes to the Reichstag, and to break up the protesters as soon as they begin to coalesce. I won't have the Wilhelmstraße blocked up by a petty band of miscreants."\n\n"My Führer," Gehlen said hesitantly, "there may be a course of action that benefits us more.

Despite clear instructions that they would not be allowed to march towards the Reichstag or the Volkshalle, clusters of demonstrators began to leap over blockades and outmaneuver Orpo officers, and soon the march was proceeding as planned.\n\nSoon after breaking through the first wave of blockades, hundreds of Orpo officers were dispatched into the crowd to violently break up the march and push the protesters back to Wilhelmstraße.

While trying to escape, a few hundred stragglers were tackled to the ground and arrested for their treasonous activities.

Restaurants and government buildings alike were broken into by swarms of protestors, who looted and trashed every place they entered. One shop was set on fire, though it was quickly dealt with by the fire brigade.\n\nWhatever sparked the violence and chaos did not just infect the minds of the protestors. Enraged at the destruction and lacking any coherent orders, hundreds of Orpo officers began to break the riots apart with greater intensity than ever before.

Several shootouts have broken out throughout Germania between violent protestors and Orpo patrols, resulting in the deaths of a few brave officers. As if this weren't vile enough, a few cowards have even been gunning down officers in drive-by shootings, and throughout the city violence against the police is increasing rapidly, from thuggish assaults to knife attacks.

While the circumstances of his disappearance can't yet be fully determined, the Führer has been informed that it is likely connected to the recent anti-government protests, with Cologne itself having seen several large protests and riots, akin to those seen in Germania.\n\nEvery available agent is on the scene, and the Chief of the Ordnungspolizei Reinhard Gehlen himself is personally leading the investigation.

Bormann snapped himself out of his thoughts and listened with grim intensity. "You have terminal lung cancer. At most, I would give you two years left to live. I'm sorry, my Führer."\n\nBormann sat in deathly silence. He pulled out a cigar, lit it up, and took a deep puff.

 bormann.1500.desc:0 "Among the foreign policy initiatives announced by the Reichskanzlei, none have prompted more attention - and worry - than the Führer's announcement that he will seek to resolve, once again, the 'Polish Question.'\n\nPerhaps aware of the sensitivity of the situation, Führer Bormann has issued an unexpectedly wide call for policy proposals in the days preceding his final decision. As the days wear on, the debate narrows to two options:\n\nThe first contends that instead of wasting lives and equipment to re-establish the clearly defunct Generalgouvernement, the Reich should negotiate and establish a Polish client state. The militarists in the Party and the Wehrmacht are bitterly opposed, asking why the Reich should bind itself into making concessions to the Polish Untermenschen - and it remains unclear what the Poles will demand in response.\n\nThe competing offer is elegantly simple on its face, if costly - an ultimatum for the Polish state to surrender to a renewed Generalgouvernement, or to face forced reintegration into the Einheitspakt. There is little doubt the proposal will be refused, and even less doubt that the Poles can resist - and the militarists are counting on a swift victory to buoy the spirits of our people at home.\n\nAs the Führer mulls his options, Wehrmacht and Polish divisions assemble at the border, digging trenches to the echoes of the last war."

The task had been far harder than they'd imagined. For starters, there were few Polish speakers left in the foreign ministry, let alone the wider German government. Polish had been declared a dead language, useful only to historians - just one of the many untruths in the late Hans Frank's reports to Germania.\n\nMuch of the work was now complete. They'd found a handful of Polish translators, identified their red lines, and even settled on the menu for the working lunches - a formal banquet would be 'too good' for the Poles.\n\nAll that remained was to send the invitations and to prepare the city where the negotiations would take place - Danzig. The city that had been the stated cause for the last war, would now play host to negotiations to prevent the next one. It was an ironic compromise - for the Poles were unwilling to travel to Germania, and the Reich's diplomats would not set foot in hostile territory.\n\nWhatever happened now, history would be made - again - in Danzig."

Both sides sat stiff and inflexible in their seats - anticipating a long and arduous discussion.\n\nSurprisingly, the Polish lead negotiator opened, with a clear and concise statement.\n\n"Though we are representatives of a free Poland, we are keenly aware of our material disparity with the German Reich. There is no disguising this fact, and accordingly we will not camouflage our aims behind implausible fictions. While we welcome this opportunity for discussion, if our minimum guarantees cannot be met, then we will spare ourselves even this last fiction - for Poland's honor demands it."\n\nThe German delegation digested the statement, both irritated at the Poles' presumptuousness and relieved at their bluntness. It seemed the negotiations would be short.\n\n"The autonomy of the Polish Republic must be guaranteed. Non-Polish authorities, military or civilian, must not infringe on the internal affairs and workings of the Polish Republic, its legislature, or any other organ of state.""

"Wait. Imprecision will be the death of us all. Define 'sovereign territory' - claimed, or held? And what becomes of the Germans who remain in the territory held by your organization?"\n\n"As I said before, these are our minimum demands. Any Germanization policy stops from this day forward, and the Poles shall be allowed to be Poles in Polish lands." The Polish negotiator didn't break eye contact with his German counterpart.

But it beat having the Wehrmacht storm the border; in their weaker position, that would have to be good enough.\n\n"The government, lands, people, culture, language, and all other associated and institutions are to be formally recognized as Polish. They are to be referred to as such in any and all official documentation, diplomatic communications, and government policy of the Greater German Reich."\n\nThe German delegation pursed their lips. While the question logically followed from the question of autonomy posed earlier, the legal terminology of the various states in the Einheitspakt posed specific problems. Accepting the demand would make Poland, for all intents and purposes, more similar to the pre-civil war United Kingdom and the French State, accorded far more respect and prestige than the colonial Reichskommissariats that had controlled much of Eastern Europe.\n\nAnd all on Germany's doorstep! The question, so simple in writing, was momentous in its implications for the Einheitspakt. The Germans withdrew into a huddle once more."

Those Polish swine, thinking themselves worthy of dictating terms to the Greater German Reich? Autonomy, an end to colonization, and elevated status within the Einheitspakt? Bormann scowled. He could crush those Poles in his hand, send them running for the hills like in 1939.\n\nBut he knew that the Party - and the world - were watching. He hadn't reached for force as his first option - keeping everyone in the Party guessing, and the world hopeful. And as he read through the rest of the document, he saw the ploy of his negotiators taking shape - the full forfeiture of Polish territorial claims, guarantees for the rights of what Germans remained in Polish-held lands, an open market for German corporates.\n\nPoland would be free, but only in name.

Now that Bormann had thoroughly familiarized himself with the situation in the Generalgouvernement, he made ready to formally reintegrate the Generalgouvernement back into the German Reich - starting by dispatching an interim Governor-General and trusted administrators to reestablish civil authority and pave the way for the restoration of normal government.\n\nThere would be far more work ahead - the reports had gone on endlessly over the faults, lies, and omissions of Hans Frank, which had allowed the underground Polish 'state' to operate virtually unchallenged.

The old administration - those people who knew how everything worked, and didn't work - was being helpful now, but there was no guarantee they'd fall back into their old habits once things calmed down and attention moved elsewhere. They'd failed once; who was to say they wouldn't fail again?\n\nNo, they'd need to be watched carefully, even after the new administration was formally set in place. He'd have to draft a new set of orders to the new department heads and ministers - keep a close eye on your old members.

And indeed, one of the General Staff's plans pursued this exact strategy - slamming into the Polish lines with armor and airpower, diving deep into their rear and isolating individual units for defeat in detail. It would be a spectacular, if somewhat haphazard, attack, relying on the initiative of individual commanders to push forward.\n\nBut what if the Poles were ready to fight the last war? If the German attack got bogged down, the political fallout could be enormous. Better to plan a methodical assault, destroying each Polish position in a hail of artillery fire before sweeping them aside in combined armed assaults.

In a way, it could be said to represent Sweden as a whole- a proud corvette, not as large or as powerful as the massive carriers that swept the oceans or the battleships that stoically watched their respective harbors, but a ship that could pull its own weight and could fight with the best.\n\nPerhaps it was fitting that a meeting of such importance, one that could determine the economic future of Sweden, perhaps even Scandinavia, was being held here. Bormann's limousine, flanked by enough bodyguards to overthrow a small nation, pulled up to the dock to see the Swedish Foreign Minister, Torsten Nilsson, waiting for him on the ship's deck. As Bormann pulled himself from the limousine and up the gangway, Nilsson gave him a curt nod and shook his hand, cameras flashing to capture the moment.\n\n"Führer Bormann," Nilsson began, "It's an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to the Göteborg." Bormann nodded curtly, his face maintaining its neutrality. Nilsson continued. "We were planning on taking a short cruise around the Swedish coast, and then beginning in earnest. Do you wish to see your room?"\n\nBormann regarded the man with mild amusement, this was the Swedish minister, hmm? Not intimidating, very formal, outwardly friendly.

Charts, graphs, demands, memos- it was enough to make a lesser man's head spin. Even Bormann could barely keep track of it all. He would manage, of course- always had, always would.\n\nOn the other side of the boat, Nilsson prepared his demands cautiously and carefully. The German Eagle was a prickly beast- one that didn't take requests well. He would need to pick his fights well, aim for the weak spots. At the end of the day, however, Nilsson had one advantage that Bormann did not- the Germans were negotiating with the Swedes, not the other way. He got to set the table, and he got to set the issues- invaluable things in high level talks like these.\n\nBoth parties found themselves ready to go as the clock ticked down, and when it was time, both men strode from their cabins proudly, ready for the duel of words."

"Führer Bormann, I trust you understand why we're speaking here today, yes?"\n\n"Of course. Tungsten imports, steel and iron imports, the like." Bormann grunted, mildly displeased at the sudden interruption. "I trust this will be a swift process?"\n\nNilsson's brow furrowed. "I'm afraid not. With the new geopolitical situation being so different than the one before 1963, our government has seen fit that re-negotiation is in order. Namely, the previous privileges granted to the Reich- we believe that it's fit to go over these."\n\nBormann scoffed. "Of course. You want to cut all our benefits, do you?"\n\n"My government sees the removal of these limits as critical in these talks. I'm sure we can find a compromise, but this will go much smoother if the Reich concedes here."\n\nBormann's expression soured.

Is there any particular reason for this change?" Bormann questioned, tilting his head, noting how Nilsson tensed a little as he heard the question. Nilsson cleared his throat.\n\n"The Reichswerke has had their benefits revoked, yes. We did so at the beginning of the Civil War- it was no longer an economic aid to us. As such, our government decided to cut our losses."\n\nBormann scowled. Swedish bastards were more greedy than the Jews or the Swiss, he thought, scarpering off with the money of good German companies at the first hint of trouble. A boiling anger raged deep within him- an impulse to strike back, to demand the restoration of Germany's status- but he held it in. Blowing up in the face of the Swedes would do him no good.

Those benefits were crucial building blocks to building our base of operations in the Scandinavian market, and your failure to reinstate them will certainly be a great setback in our attempts to restore Germany to its former wealth. Rest assured that we will not take such insults as these sitting down, and it is expected of you to negotiate a deal that is favorable to our interests.

Nilsson's silence pervaded through the room for a near minute before he finally began his response, slow and deliberate.\n\n"I'm certain we can reinstate those economic benefits, Herr Bormann, on one condition."\n\n"I'm all ears."\n\n"No slaves. None. Not in Sweden. You agree to that, we have a deal."\n\nExternally, Bormann's face remained unmoved, but rage shook the iron bars of his mind. Those bastard Swedes!

He looked out the window as he considered his next words -  Sweden, for its faults, was certainly a beautiful country. A shame that their government had to be so corrupt -  it would have made a fine addition to the Reich.\n\n"Look, it is what it is. I'm sure you can spare a few slaves, can't you?

It was stupid, he thought -  the companies could certainly spare some slaves, could they not. He was no liberal, but certainly some compromise could be made. No matter. Politics demanded that this be his hand, and so he would play it -  good or bad. There's no folding at the diplomatic table.\n\n"Indeed. I have spoken with Geilenberg, and we have come to the decision. No compromise. Take the slaves or leave the business.

Why should we accept?"\n\n"Well, besides the immediate ramifications of a failure to make a deal, perhaps some competition would be useful for your business, yes? Besides, I've heard that some in your government have called for economic liberalization, and it certainly wouldn't hurt your economy to open up a little, would it?"

If these reports are true, we must voice our great discontent, for they seem antithetical not only to our business practices, but to the fight against decadent western capitalism that National Socialism has espoused for decades.\n\nAllowing Swedish companies into German markets will not only threaten our shares and stakes in the European market, but allow capitalist corruption to seep into the very depths of our society. Such an opening will be exploited in full by our enemies, and we will be corroded from within by western spies.\n\nIf this sudden change in course is not corrected, we will have no choice but to preserve National Socialism by any means necessary. For the sake of our Reich, see reason and say no to these capitalist pigs.\n\nEdmund Geilenberg."
 bormann.1522.a:0 "The industrialists are right. Pull back."
 bormann.1522.b:0 "They'll learn to live with it!"
 
 bormann.1523.t:0 "Sabotage Industrial Faction in the NSDAP?"
 bormann.1523.desc:0 "The next morning, Bormann traditionally walks through the corridors of the Reichkanzlei, watching the officials arriving at their offices. But this day was not like the previous ones. Passing the mime of the industry departments, Führer observed only the dead emptiness of the premises. There was no rustle of documents, no tense calls between ministries. Absolute silence.\n\nBormann understands that in a situation of tense negotiations with the Swedes and industrialists, such behavior means nothing more than sabotage, and understands that a long downtime of key departments will lead to inevitable discontent of both party officials and the general population.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to make the main choice - are we ready to strike a blow at the industrialists' lobbyists in the Party, or should we succumb and yield to them in negotiations with Sweden?"
 bormann.1523.a:0 "We should retreat..."
 bormann.1523.b:0 "Nobody can stop me!"
 
 bormann.1524.t:0 "Sweden Demands Reparations"
 bormann.1524.desc:0 "Hewel picked up the phone. The Swedish ambassador to the Reich was on the other end.\n\n"Nils Montan, correct?"\n\n"A translator, but yes."\n\n"I heard you Swedes had a demand for us."\n\n"Well, Mr. Hewel, we both know about the state of the negotiations. Things aren't going well. I've been ordered to tell you that the government is demanding a... large repayment for lost minerals."\n\n"I'm sure the Reich can..." Hewel's eyes widened as he heard the sum laid out. "Billions of dollars?!"\n\n"Yes, that's the sum the economists calculated. Look, I didn't make the number-"\n\n"I don't care about that! When I said the Reich could pay any sum I didn't mean that much! Do you realize the implications of if we accept this?"\n\n"Do you realize the implications if you don't?""
 bormann.1524.a:0 "Yes, and I'd much rather we have those than accept."
 bormann.1524.b:0 "I do. We cave."
 
 bormann.1525.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
 bormann.1525.desc:0 ""What?!" Bormann shouted as he read through the paper in his hands. His hands shook with rage. "No? They said no? You're telling me you couldn't even get a weak shithole like Sweden to join the Pakt?"\n\n"My Führer, I can explain-" Hewel started. He was quickly interrupted by a very angry Bormann.\n\n"What is there to explain? This is a disaster! Do you know how much trouble I'll have to deal with because of your mistake?"\n\n"Yes, but Sweden is a very-"\n\n"I don't want excuses." Bormann ran his hands across his face. He let them rest near his mouth. "Okay, what to do..." He said, contemplating how to reduce the damage as much as possible. He stood up suddenly. "I'm not taking the fall for this. This is all you, got it? This means it's your job to salvage this mess. If it's out of your control, come get me."\n\n"Führer-"\n\n"Get out of my office, I'm extra busy now because of you." Bormann rushed Hewel out of his office. Hewel stood in the hallway for a moment."
 bormann.1525.a:0 "I'm fucked."
 
 bormann.1526.t:0 "NSDAP Criticize Foreign Ministry!"
 bormann.1526.desc:0 "Hewel rapped on the Führer's door.\n\n"Come in." Bormann said exhaustedly. He had heard the news.\n\n"Führer, you must know about the situation in the party by now. I can't do anything to salvage our reputation without one of them shutting me down!"\n\n"Hewel, they want you to resign." Bormann sighed. "They aren't going to be happy until I fire the entire Foreign Ministry at this rate."\n\n"I know that. Führer, please don't-"\n\n"You can relax, I'm not going to throw you under the bus. I'll fire a few people to keep them placated for now."\n\n"Thank you, Führer Bormann." Hewel relaxed. Bormann didn't."
 bormann.1526.a:0 "Don't mess up."
 
 bormann.1527.t:0 "Crisis in Goverment!"
 bormann.1527.desc:0 ""Oh god, this is worse than I thought." Bormann said, staring at the stack of letters on his desk. Despite the formality and varying language, it was clear the letters all said the same thing: "Sack Hewel." The letters were from members of the Reichstag. Almost the entirety of the Reichstag wanted Hewel gone. Bormann sighed. He thought he had already made his position clear. He began writing a memo."
 bormann.1527.a:0 "Hewel will retain his position."
 bormann.1527.b:0 "You tired!"
 
 bormann.1528.t:0 "An Awkward Silence"
 bormann.1528.desc:0 ""I'm not firing Hewel, and that's final." Bormann ended his announcement. There was an angry cry from down below. Evidently those scheming bastards in the Reichstag had convinced them that Hewel was the one to botch the negotiations. While this was good for avoiding the blame for the failed negotiations, it wasn't good for Hewel. Bormann knew that an unruly mob could easily be pacified. Those bastards in the Reichstag wouldn't get him this time. He'd fire a few more men, but not poor Hewel.\n\nBormann sat at his desk, calmly filing paperwork to the sounds of the Orpo firing on a crowd."
 bormann.1528.a:0 "An appropriate reaction to dissent."
 
 bormann.1529.t:0 "Bureaucracy is Growing..."
 bormann.1529.desc:0 ""My Führer?" Hewel quietly said as he stepped one foot into Bormann's office.\n\n"Yes? What is it?"\n\n"It's about my own department. It's sort of... been replaced. All the men I knew in it are gone and replaced with some party bureaucrat who hates me." Bormann had a realization. He had fired too many people. "They're sort of contented but... I don't think I have as much control over them as I used to. It's more of an autonomous organ separate from me. This might cause some... problems if left unchecked."\n\n"Well I'll be sure to check it then. Good day." Bormann rushed Hewel out of his office. He began contemplating how to fix the situation."
 bormann.1529.a:0 "I mean, I could always just fire them all. No, no..."
 
 bormann.1530.t:0 "Transport Issue"
 bormann.1530.desc:0 "Every year since the 1930s, the tonnage of ore traded from Sweden to Germany has, save for the economic crash of the 1950s, seen an upwards trend. It is an undeniable fact that the delivery of Swedish ore into our hands is essential, not only for economic reasons, but for defense reasons too.\n\nWith recent trade negotiations having thus far concluded favorably, this upwards trend is due to continue for decades to come. However, with the increased consolidation and organization of the German-Swedish ore trade, a question has risen as to who will be the responsible party for the increased transportation of ore: Germany or Sweden?\n\nUpon one hand, German firms would water at the mouth to place their hands upon the government transportation contracts which would follow such an arrangement. Adversely, such contracts could prove costly to the Reich, and the corporations would surely invent a plethora of novel costs that would suddenly be associated with the transportation of ore -- costs that they only incur now that the Reich is footing their bills.\n\nUpon the other hand, it could be left to Sweden to deliver their exports of ore henceforth, with German firms receiving their goods all the same, and the Swedish being left to foot the bills and handle the blame should shipping arrangements go awry. Our firms may be irked at such an arrangement, but the cogs of our industry will continue to turn all the same."
 bormann.1530.a:0 "Let the Swedish handle transportation."
 bormann.1530.b:0 "Only a German firm can be entrusted with this."
 
 bormann.1531.t:0 "German Carriers Protest!"
 bormann.1531.desc:0 ""Führer Bormann. What is the meaning of this?!" Richard Bertram, chairman of Norddeutscher Lloyd, said. "You can't let Sweden handle the logistics! We need that share of the market! Do you know how hard shipping is these days?" Despite Bertram's complaints, Bormann remained silent. "This is a disaster for us. Come on, my Führer. Is Sweden worth dooming an industry?"\n\n"You don't understand how important Sweden is." Bormann spoke up. His voice was filled with rage. "I'm a very busy man. Please leave." Bertram opened his mouth again, then realized nothing he could say would change Bormann's mind. Bertram left, disappointed.\n\nThe rest of the day was filled with similar complaints. When there was a lull in the rapid series of complaints, Bormann wondered something."
 bormann.1531.a:0 "Was it worth it?"

 bormann.1532.t:0 "Mistrust on the Ship"
 bormann.1532.desc:0 "It was the day after Bormann had decided to leave the logistics to the Germans. The Swedes stared at him oddly. A blanket of silence had descended on the ship. Bormann and the Swedes did their paperwork separately for a while. The silence was occasionally broken by meaningless banter between delegates, but nothing substantial came of it. Bormann could almost feel the unresolved tension in the air as he and the Swedes passed papers back and forth. Despite all the papers filled out and signed, no progress was made that day."
 bormann.1532.a:0 "I don't think it was worth it."
 
 bormann.1533.t:0 "Final Meeting"
 bormann.1533.desc:0 "Hewel and Bormann stepped onto the ship for what would hopefully be the last time. The Prime Minister of Sweden himself, Tage Erlander, was there. The negotiations progressed at a snail's pace, getting stuck on menial topics of debate frequently. It would all be worth it at the end. Bormann had to leave, but Hewel could hopefully secure it on his own.\n\nBormann sat in his office, awaiting the news. Suddenly, Hewel burst into the room..."
 bormann.1533.a:0 "So?"
 
 bormann.1534.t:0 "Negotiations Succeed!"
 bormann.1534.desc:0 ""Good job!" Bormann said. He looked happily at the photograph of Erlander and Hewel shaking hands. He honestly didn't think he could do it.\n\n"Oh no, it's all in a day's work."\n\n"Still, it is a victory for the Reich. We'll all reap the benefits of this." That'd show those ignorant bastards in the Reichstag how Bormann was competent. While Hewel had signed the deal, the majority of the work had been done by Bormann, hadn't it? Bormann would make sure the official reports said this, as it was true, after all. Hewel was more of an... advisory. After Hewel had left the office, Bormann got on the phone with the censors."
 bormann.1534.a:0 "I did most of that, not Hewel."
 
 bormann.1535.t:0 "Meeting in Germania"
 bormann.1535.d:0 "Walther Wenck stepped into the large, empty room. Hewel sat with the four Swedes at the table, desperately trying to stall for the very late Führer and Wenck.\n\n"Ah, Walther, I see you've finally arrived." Hewel shot Wenck a glare.\n\n"Yes, sorry about that. There was a lot of traffic on the way here." Wenck explained.\n\n"Well, let's not waste any more time. Let me introduce you to our guests. We have Curt Göransson, head of the Army, Nils Montan, a Swedish ambassador to us, and the Prime Minister himself, Tage Erlander. The fourth person here is their translator." Hewel said. Almost as if on cue, Bormann walked into the room. Hewel and Wenck rushed to greet him. Bormann waved them off and sat at the table. Erlander spoke up. The negotiations begun.\n\nIt was finally decided after three grueling hours of menial discussions. There would be more negotiations like this over a series of days, with the absence of Bormann and Erlander."
 bormann.1535.a:0 "Let's do this."
 
 bormann.1536.t:0 "Roundtable with the Wehrmacht"
 bormann.1536.d:0 "Walther Wenck sat in a crowded room, huddling with the other generals over a few maps. No one knew where to begin. Wenck eventually spoke up.\n\n"I think we should extend a warm welcome to the men who came all the way here from Sweden." He said. The translator relayed his message to the Swedes. They seemed pleased.\n\n"Now, about what we came here for. You see, the world is currently very unstable, and we should prepare for any instability. If we take a look here..." Wenck pointed to a spot on the map as he roughly explained German intelligence about its rivals. A discussion began about what to do if the OFN invades. Though the Swedes noticeably recoiled a bit at the more... racially charged parts of the discussion, the talks seemed to go well."
 bormann.1536.a:0 "Forwards, together!"
 
 bormann.1537.t:0 "Invite Sweden to Pakt Wargame [GetYear]?"
 bormann.1537.d:0 "The Pakt Wargames are a demonstration of the ties between the members. The Wargame features demonstrations from all branches of services from all Pakt members. It aids in developing tactics and fostering bonds between nations. This year's wargames will be held in Ostland and focus on winter combat and invasions of Arctic places. The Pakt Wargames could be used as a tool to help our relations with Sweden. We could invite all their branches of service, bringing us both closer together. This may be viewed as a violation of Sweden's neutrality, however. We could also only invite their ground forces, which could feel less like a violation of Sweden's neutrality but not creating as much of a bond between the two nations."
 bormann.1537.a:0 "Let's show our unity - invite them fully!"
 bormann.1537.b:0 "Invite only their ground forces."
 bormann.1537.c:0 "We can do without them."
 
 bormann.1538.t:0 "Status of Sweden"
 bormann.1538.desc_nor:0 "While other nations such as Norway have cast off their degenerate ways and joined the Reich, Sweden remains an anomaly. They have assisted us in the past, and with our domination over Europe it seems an anomaly as to why they still do not join us. The reason is simple: they seek to maintain neutrality in the Cold War. While they may not be willing to fully align with us, they are willing to provide us with assistance. If Sweden were to become heavily aligned with the Pakt we would surely be able to influence Finland as well, leaving all of Scandinavia with us."
 bormann.1538.desc_not_nor:0 "Since Norway has fallen into degeneracy once more we have lost our foothold in Scandinavia, losing much of our influence in the region. Thankfully, a new opportunity has arisen in the "neutral" nation of Sweden. While total control over it would be preferable, a Pakt-aligned Sweden could be a useful tool if we seek to influence the rest of Scandinavia..."
 bormann.1538.a:0 "A useful "ally"."
 bormann.1538.b:0 "Well, let's see what we can do."
 
 bormann.1539.t:0 "Scandinavian Defense Initiative"
 bormann.1539.d:0 "Reports have come in about negotiations for a military agreement between Sweden and Norway. The agreement's terms are vague at the moment, but if any version of it is agreed upon it will surely make Sweden a more loyal partner of the Pakt. We could force the Swedes to agree to a version more... favorable to us, but the Swedes may find this as a violation of their neutrality, and be less inclined to agree to our other demands."
 bormann.1539.a:0 "I think they really want to agree to this."
 bormann.1539.b:0 "Let the Swedes decide for themselves."
 
 bormann.1540.t:0 "Unification of Standards"
 bormann.1540.d:0 "An interesting concept has been floating around the Pakt as of late. This concept is the unification of equipment standards across the Einheitspakt. The new equipment and uniforms would be based on ours, giving us more influence over the current members of the Pakt. The only problem is that it could make Sweden feel like less of an equal and more of a puppet state should they join the Pakt."
 bormann.1540.a:0 "Well, let's do it."
 bormann.1540.b:0 "I'm not so sure about this."
 
 bormann.1541.t:0 "Maneuvers in Scandinavia"
 bormann.1541.d:0 ""So, about Scandinavia." Wenck said, leaning forward on the decrepit table. "Do you want our help in organizing it?" A seemingly innocent offer, it would appear arbitrary to refuse. Göransson knew better, however.\n\n"Why are you implying that the Swedes and Norwegians need your guidance for everything? These are supposed to just be joint military exercises between Sweden and Norway." Göransson replied. As usual, Montan raced to pick up the pieces.\n\n"What my colleague means here is that German involvement in affairs between Sweden and Norway could be seen by... others as a breach of our policy of neutrality. I hope you understand what effect this could have on us."\n\n"I do." Wenck said. He cleared his throat."
 bormann.1541.a:0 "Our offer still stands."
 bormann.1541.b:0 "We withdraw the offer."
 
 bormann.1542.t:0 "Northern Outpost"
 bormann.1542.d:0 "Wenck waited for Göransson to finish reading his proposal.\n\n"You want to station troops in Sweden. Using us as a military base, huh?" Göransson said. Montan glared at him.\n\n"What my colleague means is that we believe you want to use Sweden as a military base for your own interests."\n\n"That simply isn't true. You see..." Hewel began explaining. He and Montan got into a discussion consisting of empty promises and needless clarification, desperately trying to ease the tensions. Wenck and Göransson glared at each other. Finally, Wenck spoke."
 bormann.1542.a:0 "Our demands still stand."
 bormann.1542.b:0 "Fine. The Germans retract their demands."
 
 bormann.1543.t:0 "Airbase Question"
 bormann.1543.d:0 ""You want what?" Göransson was taken aback.\n\n""Airbases. We need airbases. And you're in the perfect position for them." Wenck explained. "We have to be able to send the Luftwaffe into the Arctic. It'll allow us to reach northern Russia and possibly prevent OFN troops from landing if we ever go to war. You want protection, right?"\n\n"Yes, but we don't want our country turned into an airfield! Come on, Wenck. This is like us demanding Germany to pay for airbases to be used by Sweden."\n\n"Göransson, you forget," Hewel butted in. "Sweden is not as strong as the Reich. You need our protection. It's only fair we ask for payment in return."\n\n"Then how have we-"\n\n"Alright, settle down. Do the Germans still demand we build airbases in Sweden for their use? This may be viewed by others in our country as a breach of our sovereignty."
 bormann.1543.a:0 "We need those airbases!"
 bormann.1543.b:0 "Let's not force them."
 
 bormann.1544.t:0 "Naval Base Question"
 bormann.1544.d:0 "Karl Dönitz walked into the room, surprising all those present at the negotiations.\n\n"Gentlemen, I have a proposal." He slid a stack of papers onto the table. The translator read them out loud to the group in both German and Swedish.\n\n"Give the Kriegsmarine the right to dock and repair in Swedish ports? That seems a bit... superfluous, wouldn't you say?" Montan said.\n\n"Yes, what the Swede said. Why does the Kriegsmarine need Swedish ports in the Baltic when we already have dominance over the region?" Wenck agreed.\n\n"You don't see it, Wenck. We need Swedish ports so we can project our dominance further over the Baltic. Our hold will become stronger. We will be able to more effectively pressure Finland and prevent an OFN invasion." Dönitz explained. "The Swedes will benefit from this, of course."\n\n"You understand that giving up port space to German ships will endanger our neutrality further, correct? It could even be seen as a violation of our sovereignty." Göransson countered.\n\n"Well I think it's a good idea. Hewel, how about you?" Wenck asked."
 bormann.1544.a:0 "I think Dönitz has the right idea too."
 bormann.1544.b:0 "The diplomatic hassle would be more trouble than it's worth."

 bormann.1545.t:0 "The Question of Arms Trading"
 bormann.1545.d:0 ""I hope you don't find this as overbearing. We have our own demand for the Reich," Montan said. The group looked at him boredly. "We request a discount on German weapons in exchange for the restoration of Swedish exports to Germany to their pre-Civil War level."\n\n"No. You'll pay the same price for our arms as everyone else," Wenck snapped.\n\n"What? You can't just-"\n\n"I just did."\n\n"Hang on, I need to speak with my colleague in private for a bit," Hewel said. He dragged Wenck outside. "Dammit Wenck, what the fuck are you thinking?"\n\n"We have the finest arms on the planet! We don't need to give them a discount!"\n\n"This isn't about how good our arms are. This is their only demand, if we reject it we look like selfish pricks! Come on, just tell them you've changed your mind and we can put this issue to bed.""
 bormann.1545.a:0 ""Alright, fine. But I won't be happy about it.""
 bormann.1545.b:0 ""They'll buy our superior Aryan arms at the same price as everyone else!""
 
 bormann.1546.t:0 "Concessions, Protections"
 bormann.1546.d:0 ""It's simple, we want to protect Reichswerke's concessions. Our land, our police." Göransson declared plainly.\n\n"It's our company, though. The Heer will do the job easily," Wenck argued.\n\n"Do you really think we can't protect our own land? I assure you, our police are some of the most well trained in the world."\n\n"You don't need police, you need soldiers. Who knows what insane bastard will attack-"\n\n"Which is why our professional police force will handle it easily-"\n\n"Your police force is neutered! They can't-"\n\n"Stop! Okay, this is due to a misunderstanding," Montan butted in. The sudden shout put all eyes on him. "Wenck, you realize that if we let the Heer protect them it'll make Sweden look weak and vulnerable, right? This is why we insist on the police protecting them instead. If you really insist, we'll let the Heer protect them. So, let's move on, shall we?""
 bormann.1546.a:0 ""The Heer will be the ones to protect it, that's final.""
 bormann.1546.b:0 ""Well, in that case I suppose the Swedes can handle themselves.""
 
 bormann.1547.t:0 "Wissenschaftliche Gruppe"
 bormann.1547.d:0 ""Let's see... what's next on the agenda..." Montan said as he attempted to organize the talks. "Ah, the Cold Climate Research Group."\n\n"The what?" Hewel asked. "I wasn't informed of this." Hewel made a mental note to fire some people once he got back to Germania.\n\n"Oh. Well, apparently some German and Swedish scientists have gotten together to research combat in the cold. They're using the north of Sweden as a testing ground," Montan explained.\n\n"What are they testing exactly?"\n\n"I'm not sure of the specifics, but they want the backing of both of us."\n\n"I'm not sure about this. We don't need to test things we already know," Rapp butted in. He and Hewel had the same suspicions about what was being tested. Pressuring Sweden into this could seem like a breach of neutrality, though if Sweden accepts we could test some... untested weaponry."
 bormann.1547.a:0 "We can't pass up an opportunity like this. Let's fight and research together!"
 
 bormann.1548.t:0 "Negotiations Fail!"
 bormann.1548.d:0 "The negotiations had gone on for days without any progress. It had become a screaming match between Wenck and Göransson as they both argued about which country could defend against or crush the other. Hewel and Montan sat idly by as the translator was preoccupied with the fast-paced whirlwind of insults going on behind them. Montan didn't like Hewel that much either. His head hurt from the loud screaming. He could see the writing on the wall. Montan stood up. Wenck and Göransson's argument fell into a lull as they stared at Montan.\n\n"Alright, we can all see where this is going." We said firmly. "Absolutely nowhere. So," He began picking up the documents laid on the table and stuffing them in his briefcase. "I'm going to stop this right now." He closed his briefcase, and walked towards the coatrack hanging in a corner of the room. "Sweden will not be joining the Einheitspakt as an observer. We will still continue to deal with the Germans, it'll be business as usual." He absentmindedly put on his coat and hat as he spoke. "We are neutral. We do not pick sides, okay? Neutral. The Swedes depart the negotiations. Good day." Montan left the building. Göransson followed.\n\nWenck and Hewel were left sitting in a stunned silence. Finally, Hewel spoke."
 bormann.1548.a:0 ""The Führer'll have our heads!""
 
 bormann.1549.t:0 "Negotiations Succeed!"
 bormann.1549.d:0 "A strange thing had happened at the negotiations. Over the past few days, Wenck had noticed that he was getting along with Göransson. The negotiations had turned from a tense argument into a friendly discussion. Everyone could see where this was going, and everyone liked it. After a bit of small talk, it was finally done. Montan looked over it with glee."
 bormann.1549.a:0 "A toast to our new cooperation!"
 
 bormann.1550.t:0 "The Letter"
 bormann.1550.d:0 "Bormann stared incredulously on the manila envelope. The rich quality paper had its smooth texture broken only by the delicately curling letters reading "Der Führer." But he had seen plenty of formal letters over the past twenty-odd years. What really threw him off balance was the wax zeal on the back of the envelope. Two lions holding a crowned shield adorned with more lions and crowns.\n\n"It's the royal se-" one of the small gaggle of secretaries who had brought the letter to his office began to say, but Bormann cut him off with a hand movement.\n\n"I know what it is, I saw this back when I was the Old Führer's assistant, before the War. But why the- I mean, what reason could the Swedish royals have for writing me? Even when the Führer nominated me successor, I only got a curt congratulatory call from that limp wristed loser they call a prime minister. I haven't seen them since the Führer's funeral, and the Reich Chancellery hasn't gotten a letter directly from Stockholm Palace since the invitation to the coronation in 1950!"\n\n"Maybe you should open it, my Führer?"\n\n"Of course I am going to open it, you mouthbreathing Bavarian turd-peddler! Siegfried, have that man demoted for making idiotic remarks about his Führer! And make sure he knows he's lucky he doesn't get worse. You! With the glasses! Letter opener, now!"\n\nOne of the other four secretaries stepped forward, lightly trembling, and gave the Führer the letter knife that had been lying on his desk in front of him. With a swift movement, Bormann opened the wax seal and glared angrily at the secretary until he retreated several steps back. The Führer let his eyes scan the single page. "Seems the Swedes want to join the Pakt. Cowards, aren't even going to put up a fight like their neighbors. Maybe that makes them smart. Oh well, one of you prepare a response praising them for their wisdom and stating I will make a state visit as soon as possible. Make sure to make it clear I want Orpo officers on the ground helping with security, I don't want some Norwegian bolshie getting any ideas. Oh, and inform my wife Gerda she can buy some furniture if she comes along. Might put her in a better mood.""
 bormann.1550.a:0 "Off to Stockholm!"
 
 bormann.1551.t:0 "Dinner with the King"
 bormann.1551.d:0 "The assaulting smell and taste of the surströmming almost made Bormann retch, but he did his absolute best keeping it in and keeping his eyes locked with the Swedish king sitting across from him. He couldn't show weakness in front of all the dignitaries and officials from both Sweden and the Reich, especially as the Swedes had insisted a photographer be present at the dinner party. The monarch gave the suffering Führer a seeming look of genuine concern, but Bormann noticed the sparkle of playful joy in his eye.\n\n"Are you quite alright, Herr Führer? Maybe our cuisine is not to your liking? I can have the cooks prepare something else for you."\n\nBormann swallowed with great effort and gave a pained smile.\n\n"That will not be necessary. And it is 'my Führer,' Your Highness."\n\n"Your Majesty. And not quite yet."\n\nThe king gave another patronizing smile as Bormann suffered through another bite. That royal asshole, he was doing this on purpose! Fucking Bernadottes, Napoleon should have had them all shot!\n\nBormann forced another smile. "I must say I am delighted that Sweden has seen reason and wishes to join with the Reich and its loyal allies in building peace and prosperity for all Europeans. I am looking forward to the signing ceremony later."\n\n"Indeed, a remarkable change of policy, Führer Bormann. I must say, over the past decades I have heard hundreds if not thousands of stories of the peace and prosperity the Reich has brought our Scandinavian neighbors since the courageous liberation of their lands from their governments. German justice, swift and effective, wielded with the efficiency and skill of NSDAP."\n\nBormann felt like he had been insulted, but couldn't put a finger on it, so he simply gave another sheepish smile and forced another piece of surströmming into his mouth."

 bormann.1552.t:0 "Final Negotiations"
 bormann.1552.d:0 "Today marked the culmination of our ongoing efforts to facilitate Swedish entry into the Einheitspakt and the facilitation of friendship between our great country and their... somewhat less great nation. While the Americans and Japanese might complain and whine, suggesting we "strongarmed" or somehow forced the Swedes to this point, the solemnity and pomp of today's ceremony at Stockholm's Royal Palace should awe even the international press into silence.\n\nIn the dozens of gilded halls of the palace, hundreds of dignitaries from all over Europe have been clinking crystal glass with expensive Riesling and eating Swedish delicacies. At the center of it all has been the Führer, the royal family, and the Prime Minister of Sweden, the evening culminating in the signing of the Treaty of Stockholm, marking the final integration of Europe's last truly independent Germanic state into the economic and military structures of the German Reich's mighty alliance. The Pakt will rise again after the troubles of recent years, stronger than ever before!"

 bormann.1600.t:0 "Look to the North"
 bormann.1600.d:0 "The light of evening twilight thickened over the busy streets of Helsinki at the moment of the arrival of Walther Hewel by plane. From the very beginning, the Reichsminister took a contemptuous dislike to the city. At the outset, he was greeted by the inhospitable and damp weather of the North, but what was more not to his taste was the appearance of the Finnish capital itself, with its congregation of the lines of small, dull houses, rarely flavored by the architectural legacy of the Swedish and Russian colonists, lacking of monumentality, intrinsic to the cities of new Europe. In Hewel's mind, the landscape of Helsinki revealed the essence of the Finnish people in the most laconic way - a tedious city worthy of its complacent, immature nation.\n\nOf course, neither Hewel nor the Reich could afford to write off the whole nation only because of their personal sentiments towards. Finland was - and still is - a stalwart fortress against the Russian menace. Being a faithful ally and adversary to Germany during her push towards the East, Finland preferred to stay aside from events of Central Europe, sticking to their politics of "neutrality" and being satisfied with her status as a Pakt Observer, while keeping their modest approach towards the degenerate nations of Japan and America.\n\nThe Reichsminister was able to get the first impression of his Finnish counterparts only early in the morning. Being flirtatious and friendly at surface, the Finns clearly understood what they had to bargain for and demonstrated their assertiveness behind the facade of respectability. Bringing Finland back to the lodge of the Pakt was not a straightforward task, but what's the Reich if not a persuasive, fearsome hegemon, and who's Hewel if not a man who understands it the most, after the Führer himself, of course?"

 bormann.1601.t:0 "Attaché Meeting"
 bormann.1601.d:0 "The meetings between the German attachés in Helsinki and the Finnish military delegation passed with great punctuality. The initial arrangements, flight and landing to the Finnish capital, escort to the headquarters, an evening dinner - all has been arranged accurately to the minute. After the initial share of courtesies and pleasantries, opportunity to move on to pressing problems provided itself during the meal. Among the Wehrmacht representatives, the initiative of talks laid on the shoulders of Hans Krebs, a man familiar to military diplomatic missions and officer of great dedication to the mission of National Socialism.\n\n"We appreciate the hospitality of the Finnish noble leadership," said Krebs, slowly putting his hands on the patterned table covered with a patterned coverlet, "but at the same time, we have come with a clear task. Ever since the triumph of Führer Martin Bormann in Germania, the Finnish government showed no response in regards to the German aid. As you know, we have come to correct this misunderstanding."\n\n"Herr Krebs," said General Marlota, barely hiding his hesitancy, "the circumstances did not suggest a viable alternative for us. The conflict between Führer Bormann and power pretenders across the Reich made it impossible to rely on the aid from Germania. With the rising tensions on the Russian border, we could not afford to neglect our territorial security."\n\n"We were assigned to help you in resolving those matters," Krebs responded. "After all, it would be a disgrace to our reputation if the Greater Germanic Reich failed to secure peace and stability in Europe by armed means. The inviolability of Finland is as much in our interests as yours and we desire to reinvigorate the military cooperation between our nations to demonstrate our intentions.""
 bormann.1601.a:0 "Let's hope we can convince them to our rightness."
 
 bormann.1602.t:0 "Rearmament"
 bormann.1602.d:0 "To Reichsminister of Foreign Affairs\n\nWalther Hewel\n\nOn the occasion of a new stage in relationship between the Greater German Reich and Finland, we present you a short account of the state of the Finnish armed forces that has been thoroughly examined by assigned specialists for the last few decades\n\nDespite the lack of faith in the [FIN.GetLeader] government and the rise of political opposition to the current rule, the morale in the Finnish society shows no signs of decline. Although dissatisfied by reckless actions of the [FIN.GetLeader] administration, an average Finnish soldier stays loyal and patriotic to his country, partly in fears of the possible Russian invasion of Karelia.\n\nSuch flattening words, however, can't be said about the state of Finnish military technology. Despite their vindictiveness against the threat incoming from the Slavic barbarians, the Finnish government showed little interest in developing modern equipment for its armed forces, rendering their weaponry and vehicles outdated towards the increased demands of modern warfare.\n\nAs the result of close examinations, we advise you to negotiate with the Finnish representatives on either of two possible options. Rearmament under the German guidance is regarded as the most desirable option by the OKW, but success of this initiative entirely depends on the willingness of the Finnish government to accept the increased presence of the German military. An alternative option includes the reduced barriers in equipment trade between the two countries, but such measures, while beneficial to the Finnish military, will come at the price of our influence in the Finnish affairs.\n\nHeil Bormann!\n\nYours obediently\n\nKauffmann\n\nMilitary advisor to the Minister of Defense of Finland."
 bormann.1602.a:0 "Offer them the rearmament program on our terms."
 bormann.1602.b:0 "Giving them a discount in our weapons is enough."
 
 bormann.1603.t:0 "Send Our Generals?"
 bormann.1603.d:0 "Regardless of questions of morale and equipment, the Finnish military doctrine has traditionally centred on infantry-heavy, defensive operations. If the Finnish military is to be brought up to date with modern tactics and strategic doctrine, they will require assistance from an experienced military, and what military is more experienced than the Wehrmacht? We could offer the Finns, as an additional sweetener to any economic assistance, to borrow the generals Karl-Adolf Hollidt and Hans Krebs for six months to help train and reorganize their forces along modern lines. This would however leave us without their skills and long experience in the intervening period. What is the Führer's decision on this matter?"
 bormann.1603.a:0 "Offer them Hollidt and Krebs."
 bormann.1603.b:0 "The generals are needed in the Reich."
 
 bormann.1604.t:0 "Base in Lapland?"
 bormann.1604.d:0 "One of the conditions of our treaty with Finland to cede them Kola in the aftermath of the war with the Soviet Union was that we would be allowed to open a series of military bases in their territory. During the West Russian War this system coalesced into a single, very large base in the Lapland region, from whence we could exert influence across all of Northern Europe. However, only a few years later our precarious economic situation and post-war military budget cuts saw the base abandoned. We must now consider whether reasserting our influence in the region is worth potentially angering the Finns by forcing them to return the base, which would both cost them a valuable installation and be seen as a violation of the neutrality and independence guaranteed them by the Reich so far. We must judge the situation with care."
 bormann.1604.a:0 "Reopen the base!"
 bormann.1604.b:0 "Leave it to the Finns."
 
 bormann.1605.t:0 "Medical Retrofitting"
 bormann.1605.d:0 "A persistent and worrying problem for the Finnish Army is their great depletion of medical resources in the wake of the economic devastation of Europe by the repeated conflicts of the last decade. It would be sensible for us, with our great pharmaceutical firms like I.G. Farben once more producing more than enough for the home market, to offer to negotiate lucrative supply contracts to once more bring the Finnish supplies of penicillin, sulfates and vaccines up to par with that needed by a modern army in the event of large scale conflict. We must however beware the inescapable fact that the dominant firms of the pharmaceutical industry, especially I.G. Farben, will use this influx of money to greatly expand their influence."
 bormann.1605.a:0 "Negotiate the contracts!"
 bormann.1605.b:0 "We cannot cede more power to Big Pharma!"
 
 bormann.1606.t:0 "IG Farben Wants to Join the Finnish Market"
 bormann.1606.d:0 "As expected, the IG Farben's CEO, Abs, has heard about the proposal to negotiate for supplying the Finnish market, and he has written the government requesting IG Farben take the lead in this supply chain, having preempted our plans by moving in directly and all already coordinating a medical equipment contract with the Finnish Army. We will now have to decide whether to allow our plans to carry on with Abs taking a leading role, or use his preemptive action as an excuse to force them out of Finland. This latter option would however upset both Abs and the Finns, and potentially make other companies more hesitant to sign up for our negotiation scheme."
 bormann.1606.a:0 "We cannot risk the plan over Abs."
 bormann.1606.b:0 "Abs must be stopped!"
 
 bormann.1607.t:0 "Chemical Labs in Lapland?"
 bormann.1607.d:0 "Abs has written us again, informing our government that the Finns have granted IG Farben the right to open a number of special cold weather labs near Rovaniemi to test experimental compounds. Normally this would be considered a welcome product of our ongoing financial involvement with Finland, but with IG Farben's alarming independence from the state apparatus, this letter has aroused suspicion among the Abwehr that more nefarious substances than just medical chemicals will be tested there. More fanciful ideas have even been posited suggesting Abs may test chemical weaponry there. Still, what Abs asks for in his letter is a relatively modest grant and permission to continue. Is it really worth upsetting the Finns at this critical stage over some wild conspiracy theories?"
 bormann.1607.a:0 "Let him have his labs."
 bormann.1607.b:0 "We cannot take the risk."
 
 bormann.1608.t:0 "Missile Defense Question"
 bormann.1608.d:0 "With the rising threat of the seemingly unifying Russian statelets in the east, the strategic missile command has asked to redeploy strategic short and medium range missiles to Finnish sites, in order to help cover the Reichskommissariats in the east from the potential danger. However, many in Finnish political circles greatly oppose this, seeing it as a blatant violation of their neutrality and possible political suicide. Should we try to force the Finns to accede for the sake of our common defense, or should we back off this question for now?"
 bormann.1608.a:0 "Eastern protection is non-negotiable!"
 bormann.1608.b:0 "We can always try again if Russia becomes an actual threat."
 
 bormann.1609.t:0 "OFN Protests!"
 bormann.1609.d:0 "To the German Führer from the Office of the President of the United States of America.\n\nWe issue in the strongest possible terms our diplomatic objection to the recent bullying of the Republic of Finland by the German Reich through unequal treaties enforced upon an independent state. If such unnecessary escalation of international tensions for no discernible gain but the imperial ambitions of the German state, the United States will be forced to consider escalation of economic and military countermeasures to secure itself and its allies from such naked aggression. I, and my colleagues in the Organization of Free Nations, strongly urge you to cease such inadmissible activities before you cause further international problems.\n\nWith regards, the President."
 bormann.1609.a:0 "Nice, I can use this to light the fireplace."
 
 bormann.1610.t:0 "The Question of the Eastern Border"
 bormann.1610.d:0 "Since the unification of the Reich, it has looked East for further expansion. The Drang Nach Ost reached its greatest extent with the defeat of the Soviet Union, but overambitious plans to stretch the Reich's border between Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan - now Adolfstadt, fell short with the West Russian War, a colossal surprise to a Reich that had thought the Russians a defeated enemy. Their violent and savage assault was halted at the outskirts of Moskau, and though their Red Coalition was defeated and Russia sundered once again they have continued to thwart our efforts to maintain control of our Lebensraum.\n\nMoskowien is a famously hellish station, an underfunded garrison expected to deal with both the Russians within and the Russians without. As the warlords to the east begin to consolidate their holdings, they once more establish themselves as a threat to be feared rather than an inconvenience to be driven off, and it is the quiet belief of the OKW that the time will soon come that we face a unified Russia once more. When this time comes we will have a vast front to defend, and will require all the strength we can muster to once and for all confirm our dominion over the Eastern Territories. There is only one other nation that faces the same Russian woes that we do, of Russian partisans and the rising Asiatic hordes, an unlikely ally but one that will be dragged into the Second Russian War whether they desire it or not."
 bormann.1610.a:0 "Germany calls for aid - will Finland answer?"
 
 bormann.1611.t:0 "A United Border Service?"
 bormann.1611.d:0 "Our sole partner in the East, and another ancient enemy of the Russians - Finland exists as the only independent nation of Europe save ourselves to stand ever-alert against the Asiatic hordes of Russland. Before the war they were fearful of the Soviet imperialist desire to retake the former Grand Duchy, which itself was wracked by civil war against the Bolsheviks when the Empire fell. Instead they expanded to push the Soviets out of the Scandinavian Peninsula, taking the remainder of Karelia and the valuable northern port of Murmanni. They are protected from the violence of the Russian Hell by the Anti-Communist Guard of Onega, yet still must invest a great deal in ensuring their borders remain secure from raiders and bandits - the West Russian Revolutionary Front still maintains it's icy grip over Arkhangelsk, and may yet prove a threat against German and Finnish Lebensraum.\n\nAs the greatest power of Europe and its protector from the forces of Bolshevism, the Finns would be well served by partnering with us to protect their gains from the Russians. Indeed they have approached us with the proposal for a united Fenno-German border service to stem the tide of smugglers, bandits and revolutionaries that seek to gain entry into our lands. It is obvious that we would bear the brunt of the burden of both funding and manpower as the senior of the two states - this would however go a great deal towards establishing Finland as a truly friendly state, rather than as a reluctant ally."
 bormann.1611.a:0 "We would be glad to have a partner on our patrols."
 bormann.1611.b:0 "They think they can leech from us to guard their own borders? Think again!"
 
 bormann.1612.t:0 "A New Mannerheim Line?"
 bormann.1612.d:0 "It may seem ridiculous now, but there was a time when Bolshevism was feared to take over all of Europe. Despite a White victory in their own civil war, it seemed only a matter of time before the Russian Reds turned their gaze westwards once more. To stem the tide, the Mannerheim Line was constructed, a series of fortifications across the Karelian Isthmus to halt the Russians as soon as they left Sankt Petersburg. This invasion however never came, and it was the Russian portion of Karelia that changed hands when their state crumbled against the might of the Wehrmacht.\n\nSince then, the Mannerheim Line has fallen into disrepair - but while the Finns concentrated their efforts on expelling Russian influence from Karelia, the warlords of the East consolidated their territories, and drew their plans against them. One day, Russia will come looking for its lost lands, and both Germany and Finland must prepare for that day. The Finnish government is cash-strapped however, and there is little demand for a new Eastern wall when there are so many problems at home.\n\nThe Reich has the resources to fund the construction of another expanded Mannerheim Line. Providing assistance and security would improve the natural friendship between our two nations, as well as strengthening our negotiating position. We could also expand the plan by further integrating our own border fortifications with those of the Finns and restoring the integrity of these fortifications all the way down to the Caspian Sea. The cost of this expanded plan would be exorbitant - but can you put a price on security?"
 bormann.1612.a:0 "The Finns think they can build a wall and make us pay for it?"

 bormann.1612.c:0 "Throw up an iron curtain from Finland to the Caucasus!"
 
 bormann.1613.t:0 "Send Garrisons from Moskowien?"
 bormann.1613.d:0 "Not only is Finland short of funds to defend their portion of the line to our satisfaction, but they are also chronically short of men. Their army may be elite, but the forests and lakes of Finland are even less densely populated than the vast wastes of Russia, and any series of fortifications they construct across the hundreds of kilometers of border will be drastically undermanned. Our garrisons in Moskowien, while overworked in keeping Russian national sentiment quelled, are numerous and experienced in defending against raids from beyond the border.\n\nA small vacation might do our troops good - during the day they can ensure the Finnish portion of the line is held just as firmly as our own, and by night they can relax in the saunas with the beautiful women of Finland. They may not share Germanic blood, but as Führer Hitler declared, the Finns are honorary Aryans. The Reich may not hold so much to that idea these days, but it will continue to be circulated as long as the Finns themselves prove useful."
 bormann.1613.a:0 "A holiday in Lapland sounds like fun."
 bormann.1613.b:0 "This would make both us and the Finns go soft."
 
 bormann.1614.t:0 "Tensions in Moskowien"
 bormann.1614.d:0 "Our drive to secure the borders of Moskowien has pushed our garrisons away from the cities and ever-further east towards the border, as well as diverting a great number of troops northward to supplement the Finnish garrisons. Our Russian subjects, used to the constant presence of our troops to keep them in line for all these years have begun to question their future now that the German grip has loosened and the warlords of the east have begun to stabilise and make threats towards our rightfully won Lebensraum. This sickness of the mind has yet to spread too far, and there are still treatments available before they become too churlish.\n\nThe natural method would be to transfer additional troops and police officers into Moskowien to make up the loss, that the Slavs will only spend a short time wondering where their overlords have gone. A less expensive and manpower-intensive alternative would be to begin a campaign of disinformation throughout Moskowien, to quell any dissenting tendencies with propaganda before they get the chance to spread in earnest."

 bormann.1615.t:0 "A Waste of Money"
 bormann.1615.d:0 "The Reichstag, like the ancient Roman Senate, has long been unimportant as anything other than a debate hall and an old men's club. Formality dictates that every law and budget be first passed to them before it's inevitable confirmation, and while usually they pass by without issue today they have evidently become bored and raised a fuss.\n\nThe issue of the reconstructed Mannerheim line might have been approved the first time round, but in review several holes have been picked into its fabric. Whilst construction proceeded as planned with minimal delays or additional expenditures, it was once construction was completed that issues arose. The Finns' chronic shortage of manpower extends to their new fortifications, which after their completion more often than not simply lie empty while the Finns conduct maneuvers or see to the most important areas.\n\nThe party bureaucracy, impertinent penny-counters that they are, take great offense at what they see as a vast waste of money better spent at home. While the Reichstag has little power to actually do anything other than shake their fists and complain at the expenditure, they are nonetheless deeply annoyed."

 bormann.1616.d:0 "Intelligence indicated that we are not the only ones attempting to gain an in into Finland. While we attempt to guard them against a threat to the East, another, more insidious one has already entered it's tendrils into the frozen North. News travels slow between the trappers and loggers of Northern Finland, but word has reached us that there are a strange set of newcomers in Lapland and Kola. Clad in midnight black and bearing the badge of the twin lightning bolts, this can only mean that SS-Ordensstaat Burgund has interests in Finland.\n\nThe purpose of this mission, as with all Burgundian missions, is unknown, though the explorers have been observed taking weather readings and soil samples in the region. Their presence is no doubt part of some insidious plot to harm the Reich, and the Führer will not tolerate their presence. We could make it a condition of our new treaty to expel these enemy agents from Finland immediately to prevent their mission being fulfilled, whatever its nefarious purpose.\n\nAlternatively, we could simply... ignore them. What harm can a couple of explorers do above the Arctic Circle that could outweigh that done to our negotiations by making too many demands of the Finns. Their presence in the official report can be omitted, and the Führer will be happy nonetheless."
 bormann.1616.a:0 "I'm sure Finland will be happy to acquiesce."
 bormann.1616.b:0 "And what?"
 
 bormann.1617.t:0 "Invite Finland to SDI?"
 bormann.1617.d:0 "Initially, the Scandinavian Defense Initiative was an interstate treaty of friendship and protection between Sweden and Norway under the patronage of the Reich. But, of course, the SDI is a good way to influence the officials and the military in Sweden, and, of course, the idea of inviting Finland into a similar organization became the most logical and beneficial for the Reich. However, while Finland is likely to benefit greatly from cooperation, many Finnish politicians will suspect us of trying to force Finland to step back from its status as a "neutral" power and become a puppet for the Pakt.\n\nHewel once again leaned on the back of his chair and pondered..."

 bormann.1618.d:0 "The negotiations between the German and Finnish governments are complete. The draft of our treaty is finished, but it must still pass the final test of being negotiated through the Finnish Parliament, which does not obey our own, more efficient system of Führerprinzip. Their Prime Minister must steer the treaty through the treacherous waters of democratic discussion in order for these discussions to have been of any merit. Whilst Parliament is not a place for a foreigner to speak, our observer was permitted to listen to the Prime Minister's defense of the proposal from a shaded alcove. The Prime Minister gave an impassioned speech, which whilst it may not have paid sufficient time towards the virtues of the Reich, gave a strong argument for defensive cooperation between the Republic of Finland and the Greater German Reich. After a brief round of hear-hears, the floor was opened for debate."

Just a small sample of the words used to describe the prospective defense agreement bby Finnish parliamentarians, interspersed with a great number of "Saatana" and "Perkele"-s. The opposition called the bill degrading, and patronising, and once the floodgates of criticism had opened it was impossible to close them.\n\nAfter several rounds of fierce debating, a vote was taken, but by this time the outcome of the vote was already known. Once the formality of counting the votes was performed, the bill was rejected to a chorus of jeering by the opposition - our observer left the chambers and exited the country before anti-German sentiment grew to too great a heat.\n\nThis is an unfortunate end to the months of negotiation between our governments regarding our Eastern border, and when the inevitable Russian conflict does come, we will face it separately."

 bormann.1620.d:0 "It has been a long while since generals Hans Krebs and Karl-Adolf Hollidt made their way to the Frozen North to drill the Finnish troops to the quality demanded by the Wehrmacht. Their absence was noted by their fellow officers, with many a snide comment produced about how they were spending more time in the saunas together than they were defending against Russian raids, but nonetheless they have returned with the gratitude of their Finnish counterparts.\n\nKrebs and Hollidt quickly assumed control of their divisions regardless of the opinions of their previous officers, and established a harsh training regime that would rapidly bring the Finnish soldier to a German standard. Their tactics proved most effective in combat exercises, and whatever the Finns' opinion of them their techniques were quickly noted and replicated. Now that they have returned it will be seen whether Finnish tactics can add anything to our own repertoire, but regardless we can be a little more sure that when the time comes, Finland will hold."

 bormann.1621.d:0 "After several fierce rounds of debate and a near-fistfight between heated government and opposition parliamentarians, a vote narrowly confirmed the mutual defense agreement between the Republic of Finland and the Greater German Reich. Few spoke in favour of the agreement in strictly ideological terms, instead emphasising the necessity of the agreement to ensure the Republic's defense against the rapidly-stabilising Russian statelets to the East and the security of the region of Karelia.\n\nThe treaty is to be signed in the city of Sankt Petersburg, itself only a hop across the Finnish border. With only a hearty handshake between the Führer and the Prime Minister and a pair of signatures, friendship and cooperation will be restored between our two Aryan nations, and security and prosperity restored to the East."

 bormann.1622.d:0 "Marja could see Königsberg over the horizon. The journey from Helsinki had been perilous, and she had been at times unsure that they would make it. Simö had been more optimistic about their chances, which was a blessing in and of itself. Her husband had not been so lively since before the first war, when Zhadanov's cocktails had taken one of his arms. Quietly, for only a moment, she allowed herself to think that the revolution had been a good thing. As her breath stained the air white, she dismissed such thoughts, her cheeks red with shame as well as cold. Hundreds of men had died, and she was thinking of only her husband's temperament.\n\nWhen the Russians had come for Onega, the country had called Simö back to service, and he had reluctantly gone. With so many enemies in the East, they had a need for old veterans in the military service, and Simö was perhaps the oldest veteran that could still command a division. His battalion of green men had not yet left Helsinki before the lines had broken, and the eastern madmen had taken Karellia from them. Then, when their own people had risen up under the red flag, Simö and Marja had found shelter on this boat, this arc seemingly sent by God.\n\nThere were men below these decks that Marja had long applauded, and those whom Marja had rallied against. Soldiers, politicians and bankers... Perhaps the least likely refugees that one could think of, Marja thought with a quiet laugh. And yet, now they all huddled together and hoped that the Germans would take them in: Those scarred by war, and those that had been all too willing to wage it.\n\nFrom somewhere behind Marja, the captain radioed in for permission to dock. The whole ship seemed to fall silent as they awaited the answer."

 bormann.1623.d:0 "The assembly was utterly at a loss at what to do, but that was only in a collective sense. Individually, several men were very opinionated on what should be done about the Finnish issue. They made their voices known, often shouting over one another so that the gathered men would only hear their views.\n\nThe more militaristic aspects of the party, of course, seemed to favor a rather direct approach. Their spokesman made it rather clear. "We cannot allow a Bolshevik state so close to the Reich. An invasion must be planned immediately, and Finland cannot be allowed to operate with so free a hand in the future. To do otherwise would be both to show weakness and to allow an enemy of the master race to plot against us."\n\nThe reform-minded members of the assembly, however, were less enthusiastic, and a voice soon spoke clearly for them. "An invasion? Are you mad? We are overstretched as it is! The Finnish are within our sphere of influence. Yes, they may have fallen to Bolshevism but we are the only possible ally they have against the Russians. Their unsustainable state will collapse and then we will move in, as their saviors, and bring them back into the fold."\n\nBormann considered these things silently, weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each option in his mind.

"As such, any policy of friendship and alliance we have previously held towards them must now be rescinded immediately, and the Finnish State will have this made clear to them in the strongest terms." The Führer declared, attempting to rally the assembly together with his bold speech. The militarists certainly looked rallied, though the rest of the assembly was not as swayed.\n\n"However..." Bormann continued. "At this time, an invasion of the Finnish State is not in the best interests of the Reich, which is what must be kept foremost in the minds of this assembly. The Einheitspakt must be strengthened and the Reich's power fully restored before such a thing can be done. As such, I will now lay out the plans of the Reich in regards to the Bolshevik disgrace calling itself Finland."\n\n"As of now," The Führer searched the crowd for Hewel and Lange, to ensure that they were present and that they were paying attention. It seemed they were. "The German Reich will be holding Finland in a state of total embargo. We will furthermore permit none of the nations of the Einheitspakt, nor any other nation, to trade with these communists until this regime is toppled. The Kriegsmarine will fully enforce this measure, until the Finnish are liberated."\n\nAs Bormann stepped down, those assembled began to bicker amongst themselves, though none dared raise a voice to Bormann himself.

The attempts have not declined nearly as much as anticipated, however, with the daily attempts to bypass the brigade sometimes reaching as many as a dozen. We expect that this trend will not continue, though we cannot be certain.\n\nWith these estimated trends, we can extrapolate that the Finns will begin feeling the harsh impacts of this blockade sometime in the next few months. Without the food and luxuries provided to the Finns by German companies, the Finnish people will probably rebel against this government much more quickly than they did the last, especially considering the lack of action against the Russians.\n\nThere are some concerns that goods are being smuggled into Finland via Sweden, though the Swedish have assured us that they intend to respect the German blockade in full. At this moment, we see no reason to doubt the truth of this statement by our Swedish friends, as the Bolshevik state is perhaps an even greater threat to them than it is to us.\n\nThe operation is expected to be a success."
 bormann.1630.a:0 "Starve the bastards out."
 
 bormann.1631.t:0 "Paper, Paper, Paper!"
 bormann.1631.d:0 ""Paper? We're in a shortage of paper?" Bormann read aloud the report Lange had handed him. "How did this even happen?"\n\n"Well, my Führer, it comes down to our bureaucracy. We need a lot of paper to run the Reich, and we don't have enough. We're doing relatively alright at the moment, but it could turn into an incredibly nasty situation soon."\n\n"Well, let's get some more paper for the Reichskanzlei." Bormann said. Lange quickly interrupted him.\n\n"Well, you see, that also could cause another problem. The shortage of paper applies to the Reich as a whole, not just the Reichskanzlei. If we divert paper to the bureaucracy, we would get a shortage of paper in the military and for civilians. The other problem is, if we don't divert our current supply of paper to one of them, all of them will suffer. It's up to you where we send our paper, my Führer."\n\nBormann leaned forward, deep in thought. Lange anxiously awaited his answer. The quiet seemed to last for hours. Finally, Bormann spoke again."
 bormann.1631.a:0 "To the civilians."

I never specified the schools." Bormann said. He didn't seem angry, merely mildly irritated. Lange froze again.\n\n"I- Well, I assumed you were talking about the schools when you said to divert paper to the civilians." Bormann didn't respond. "Of course, you could, theoretically, divert paper to the entertainment industry to keep the people occupied. That could lead to them being less unhappy during the shortage, but it would come at the cost of their education. Teachers may not be able to teach their students properly. Honestly, my Führer, I think that diverting it to education would be for the best." Bormann once again sat and thought for a while. Finally, he spoke."
 bormann.1632.a:0 "Divert it to entertainment."
 bormann.1632.b:0 "Divert it to education."
 
 bormann.1633.t:0 "To the Party"
 bormann.1633.d:0 ""Well, that's great." Lange said. "I'll give out the order to divert more paper to the bureaucracy. Our administration will not suffer from a lack of paper anymore." he smiled. "Thank you, my Führer. We really needed this."\n\n"It's the most logical thing to do." Bormann said. "You'd have to be a moron not to."\n\n"Well, you certainly aren't a moron, my Führer." Lange closed the door behind him, his papers secured."
 bormann.1633.a:0 "All's well that ends well."
 
 bormann.1634.t:0 "To the Military"
 bormann.1634.d:0 "Lange stared at Bormann for a moment. He had not expected this response. He might have expected it from Hitler, but certainly not Bormann. "Well, um," Lange began. "There's a problem with that. We need to direct papers either to the Wehrmacht or the Orpo. The Orpo has a massive database filled with criminals that needs a large amount of paper to maintain, and the Wehrmacht needs large amounts of paper to document military goings-on. Whichever you choose, the other is going to suffer significantly."\n\n"Better than both of them suffering." Bormann replied. "How about...""

 bormann.1635.t:0 "My Struggle?"
 bormann.1635.d:0 "Bormann nostalgically stared at the book in his hands. It was a classic. Every German man, woman, and child should read it; that's what he always said. 'Mein Kampf'. A great book. But how did it hold up? Looking at it now Bormann found it to be a bit... idealistic. It was filled with decrees of war against the Jew and the Slav and all degeneracy everywhere but... hadn't Germany already won? Endsieg had already been achieved, hadn't it?\n\nThere were two answers to this question. One was "No, it hasn't yet." This answer was a militarist one. It didn't align with Bormann's views at all. It was better than the other one, which was "Yes, it has." This was even worse because it implied that Nazism was a failed idea. The two answers to this book's question on Endsieg promote ideas that Bormann finds... unfavorable. If it was any other book it could just be banned, but this is the official book of the Reich itself; Hitler's masterpiece. But Hitler isn't alive anymore. There's a new Führer, and with a new Führer comes new ideas..."

 bormann.1636.d:0 "Hewel sat with Lange at the table with Krebs.\n\n"What's next on the agenda..." Hewel said tiredly as he flipped through a short stack of papers. "Forests. We're supposed to discuss forests."\n\n"You see, we at the Reich are experiencing a shortage of paper and we need more wood from any source possible. Upon your entry into the Pakt, as an observer, of course, we expect you to import wood to us."\n\n"This is outrageous! Those forests are our national pride and joy! We need that wood!" Krebs butt in.\n\n"We also need that wood. We're running out of paper, and we desperately need more." Lange said. "Our bureaucracy may suffer from this immensely if we don't resolve it quickly." he turned to Hewel. "Come on, Hewel. Aren't you tired of having to write so small you get cramps?"\n\n"Well yes, but we can't just boss around our Finnish friends like this. We can harvest from Moskowien." Hewel replied. Lange glared at him. "However, it would take an incredibly long time for the shortage to subside if we tried to use Moskowien more. Our infrastructure there isn't as developed." Lange smirked at Krebs. Krebs sighed.\n\n"Are you sure you want to force us to do this? We won't take kindly to it.""

 bormann.1637.t:0 "If I Had a Nickel..."
 bormann.1637.d:0 "Hewel's alarm clock rang. This early in the morning it sounded like the shrill call of a banshee, calling him to some terrible fate. While many would consider economic negotiations with the Finns a terrible fate, including Hewel himself, he followed this dull banshee's call and ended up at the negotiation table once more. Lange was beside him, no doubt to pressure the overwhelmed Finnish foreign minister even more.\n\nThe Finns, despite their relative weakness, were a much needed ally of the Reich. Even if they only joined as an observer, their nickel, iron, and wood would be invaluable to the entire Pakt as a whole. It could significantly improve the Reich's economy due to a large amount of resources available for a cheap price.\n\nThat is, if Hewel can get the Finns in the Pakt in the first place."
 bormann.1637.a:0 "Now, onto our first topic of discussion."
 
 bormann.1638.t:0 "No Roads Lead to Petsamo"
 bormann.1638.d:0 ""If you'll excuse me, we Finns have a request of our own." Krebs took a breath. "The railway to Petsamo hasn't been improved since... the 30s? 40s? It's still using Soviet Union era infrastructure. This is a problem in a lot of railways leading to Finnish cities." Krebs cleared his throat for a moment, gauging the reactions of Hewel and Lange. Hewel looked rather bored, while Lange leaned forward in his seat, listening intently. "Luckily we have a... benefactor who may be willing to help us." Krebs winked. "If Finland is to join the Pakt as an observer, we'd like the Germans to rebuild our railways. I'm sorry, but you'll all have to pay for it."\n\n"I'm no economist, but I don't think that that's worth it for us. Lange, what do you think?" The two looked expectantly at Lange. Lange took a breath."
 bormann.1638.a:0 ""I think that's a good arrangement.""
 bormann.1638.b:0 ""I'm sorry, but you're going to have to do it yourselves.""
 
 bormann.1639.t:0 "Updates Required"
 bormann.1639.d:0 "Lange sat at the table, listening to the Finn's request.\n\n"Our equipment is in drastic need of modernization. Please, we need the Reich's help. Our developing economy-"\n\n"I know about your developing economy." Lange said, tired of Krebs' requests. "How badly are these upgrades needed?"\n\n"Very badly. You know how most of our major cities are currently connected by an old Soviet railroad? It's like that but with our equipment." Lange glanced at Hewel, who was eyeing the Finn closely.\n\n"Are you sure? I find it to be unlikely that a nation such as yours would have such terrible equipment AND terrible railroads."\n\n"Well, you see, Our lack of updated equipment has prevented us from fixing the railroads." Krebs explained. Hewel didn't buy it.\n\n"Then why didn't you ask for that in the first place?" he remarked. Krebs narrowed his eyes.\n\n"Look, I'm not the one who made this stupid schedule, but we really need updated equipment. You're not an economist, and neither am I. Let's ask the economist here what he thinks." Krebs turned to Lange expectantly. Lange sighed."
 bormann.1639.a:0 ""I suppose it does make sense.""
 bormann.1639.b:0 ""I'm not sure you really need our help.""

 bormann.1640.d:0 "Lange got off the phone and sat back down at the negotiation table, breaking the awkward silence that had hung over it while Hewel and Krebs sat together, not speaking one word to each other.\n\n"That was someone from Reichswerke on the phone." Lange explained. "They want special nickel concessions, and they want a lot of them. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot."\n\n"Do we have to?" Krebs asked. "First you ask for our wood, now our nickel too? I'm not sure our economy can handle this. You're our main trading partner, after all."\n\n"Well it's better than not getting any trade with us at all." Lange retorted.\n\n"Everyone will be angry at you. This may doom the negotiations, you know."\n\n"I don't think it will, but diplomacy isn't my expertise. Hewel, what do you think?""
 bormann.1640.a:0 ""Reichswerke needs those concessions.""
 bormann.1640.b:0 ""I think we should back off.""

 bormann.1641.t:0 "A Production Accident"
 bormann.1641.d:0 "Herr Lange," Hewel said as he stepped into Lange's hotel room. "We should've listened to Krebs." Hewel handed Lange a newspaper.\n\n"Bridge collapses..." Lange read. "The Finnish government has said the reason was outdated repair equipment... oh no." he put it down. "This doesn't make us look good. Should we help them out?"\n\n"Well, I've been thinking about that." Hewel said. "There are two options: One, we help out, it helps us save face with the Finns, but we still look sort of bad. Two, we don't help out, we admit no responsibility whatsoever, and no one but us and the Finns know about this. The second one will hurt the relationship between us and the Finns, but at least we won't look like we collapsed a bridge out of malice."\n\n"That's a... bit of a conundrum." Lange wiped his forehead. "I think we should..."
 bormann.1641.a:0 "...help out."
 bormann.1641.b:0 "...stay quiet."
  
 bormann.1642.t:0 "Invite Nokia?"
 bormann.1642.d:0 ""We have another request of our own." Krebs declared. "We'd like Nokia to be invited into your markets fully."\n\n"Are you insane? The corporations will skin us alive if we do that! Especially Siemens, they're our primary supplier of electronics! This is insane, and we, as the Reich, are forced to-" Lange exclaimed.\n\n"Nokia won't even take up that much of the market. Come on, do you really think a small Finnish electronics corporation can take on your corporations? It's not like we'll destroy your economy. In fact, both our economies may prosper."\n\n"You obviously know nothing about economics. Come on, Hewel, you agree with me, right?" Lange asked. Hewel scratched his chin."
 bormann.1642.a:0 ""Why not.""
 bormann.1642.b:0 ""I don't think we should make Siemens angry.""
 
 bormann.1643.t:0 "Visa-Free Finns?"
 bormann.1643.d:0 ""We want Finns to be able to travel throughout the Pakt without a visa." Krebs blurted out suddenly. "The other members of the Pakt can do that, we want to do it also."\n\n"Then join the Pakt fully. That is only reserved for full Pakt members." Hewel said boredly. Krebs shook his head.\n\n"We can't align with you all fully. The Japanese and Americans shutting off our markets would destroy us. We want to, but it just isn't possible. Visa-free travel could show the unity between us even more."\n\n"It sets a bad precedent; it makes it look like any member of the Pakt can just opt out of concessions and still get the full benefits of the Pakt. Can you imagine what that would do to us diplomatically? Hell, even the economic ramifications are bad, right Lange?" Hewel turned to Lange expectantly, awaiting Lange's affirmation. Lange spoke."
 bormann.1643.a:0 ""No. We can make an exception this time.""
 bormann.1643.b:0 ""Yes, you're right...""
  
 bormann.1644.t:0 "Pakt Economic Summit"
 bormann.1644.d:0 "Lange smiled as he greeted the rest of the representatives from the Pakt, as well as the Finnish representative present at the summit. They would all discuss what to do about the Pakt's economy. After the hours of talks they would all agree to whatever Lange said with virtually no compromise or disagreements.\n\nIt was the perfect opportunity to get the Finns in. Surrounded by Pakt members eagerly discussing economic benefits as well as pressuring the meek diplomat sent into a field he didn't specialize in- it would be like taking candy from a baby.\n\nThe awaited moment finally came. The summit focused on the treaty with Finland for a few hours, and then passed it to Krebs. Krebs took a breath and said..."
 bormann.1644.a:0 "Come on, spill it!"
 
 bormann.1645.t:0 "An Inadequate Response"
 bormann.1645.d:0 ""No." The room looked at him in shock.\n\n"I'm sorry, what was that?" Lange asked, praying it wasn't true.\n\n"I said no. I'm not signing this. This is incredibly unfair, it just cripples Finland to benefit you." Krebs glared at Lange. "I'm sorry to disappoint, but I never had the intention to sign this in the first place."\n\n"Why did you come, then?"\n\n"I thought it would be polite." Krebs began disorganizedly stuffing the papers he had brought with him into his briefcase. It took a few minutes to get them all in.\n\n"I mean, you invited me here, so I might as well have the decency to show up." Krebs put on his coat and hat.\n\n"Goodbye."\n\nLange and the rest of the summit sat in silence for a while.\n\n"Ahem, well then." Lange said, and changed the topic of the conversation. Despite all he did, Lange's failure hung over the meeting like a ghost."

 bormann.1646.t:0 "An Adequate Response"
 bormann.1646.d:0 ""Alright." Krebs said. Lange exhaled. He knew that Krebs would sign the treaty, but it didn't stop him from worrying.\n\n"Great!" was all he could say as Krebs slowly signed the document. Lange couldn't help but notice the regret in Kreb's eyes. Krebs obviously wondered if this was the right choice for Finland, if he was doing the right thing or if he should have refused instead. Lange smiled. Krebs thought he had a choice in the first place.\n\nThe rest of the summit went off without a hitch. Lange dominated the discussion, and it resolved well. Lange looked out the window of his car as he was leaving the summit to see a dejected Krebs stepping out of the building."

According to isolated reports, oil had been discovered in the North Sea. The Führer shook his head in disbelief and leaned back in his chair. Surely not? Was such untapped potential for economic growth hiding away between the British Isles and Northern Europe?\n\nOptimism without reason was pointless. Bormann grabbed a pen and began to scribble.

 bor_econ.100.d:0 "Martin Bormann, as ever, was early. He strummed the table impatiently as Reichsminister Lange and his men filed into the room and took their places at the table.\n\n"Hurry up, gentlemen. We have so much to discuss." He spread his arms open. "Reichsminister Lange and I have drawn up a new initiative destined to secure the Reich as the absolute hegemon of Europe. We have called it 'The Modern Wunderwaffe'." The economists looked at each other with impressed faces and nodded eagerly. "We shall initiate various governmental infrastructure and pipeline projects throughout Germania. This city shall become the nexus of the continent in the next decade! Reichsminister Lange, if you please."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Kurt Lange nodded. He was a colourless, bald man in a dull grey suit. A model functionary of the state. "As we all know, the overreliance on slavery has crippled our economy and decimated the working class. Slaves will barely be involved in the Modern Wunderwaffe initiative, mark my words. It is the German worker who shall toil and sweat over these projects, and their newly-earned wages will encourage more spending. Many German firms are financially collapsing and cutting jobs, but the economic boost provided by this new wave of spending should ensure a rise in employment."\n\n"All we need to do is push, and the snowball shall grow into an avalanche," Bormann finished with smug satisfaction."
 bor_econ.100.a:0 "But what is to be done with the slaves?"

 bor_econ.101.t:0 "A Corporate Solution"
 bor_econ.101.desc:0 ""Listen up!" Bormann shouted at the chattering economists gathered around the table. They snapped into silent attention. "Here are the final Modern Wunderwaffe proposals formulated by Reichsminister Lange and myself. For this initiative to succeed, we must deal with the slave question. To make way for the working class, the slaves will be deported to small ethnic territories and newly established ghettos throughout eastern Europe. Whether these destinations are in their nation of origin is of no interest to the bureaucratic process. They are all, essentially, untermenschen."\n\n"I have a couple of questions, my Führer," one of the bespectacled functionaries spoke up, awkwardly raising his hand. Bormann nodded at him to continue. "How long can we expect this process to take? And how are the Big Four going to fit into this?"\n\n"It will not be instantaneous," Bormann explained. "The deportation will be at a sensible, gradual pace. The most able slaves will be deported last, of course, so that during the waiting process they can supplement the infrastructure projects with their labor."\n\n"As for the Big Four, if I may," Kurt Lange continued, shuffling his notes. "Presumably you are referring to the conglomerates? Well, we will be attempting to enlist the help of all four, but naturally one will become our primary partner. Siemens is the smallest and most loyal corporation and so will require the least down payment for cooperation. Daimler-Benz is relatively loyal as well, although Reichswerke is less so, and IG Farben's allegiance is by far the most dubious - although it must be said, they are the largest and most powerful, and therefore the most useful."\n\n"Enough, Reichsminister," Bormann interjected. "I have already made my decision.""

The Grey Eminence, Bormann thought to himself smugly. The man's demeanour was lifeless and grey. His hair was thinning and grey. His suit, ill-fitting and grey. Yet, embedded in this figure of mediocrity were two sharp eyes, brimming with intelligence. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "I understand we are mostly in agreement? Your corporation will aid the state in these deportations and the establishment of ghettos and camps throughout Europe. You have proven yourself to be a true National Socialist, and so you have my undying trust."\n\n"I am here to fulfil our agreement," von Siemens concurred, "and not to negotiate. The Siemens corporation is not rich enough to engage in the scale you were hinting at during our phone call, but we shall try our best." He leaned forwards, smiling gently. "I will make one thing absolutely certain. I will not budge on this at all. Siemens is the only German conglomerate tolerated in the international community, because we haven't engaged in the same levels of slavery as our competitors.

Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "I understand your apprehensions. You have benefitted immensely from slavery, and have many friends in high places who support it. Yet here I am proposing that you abet its gradual decline." Flick smiled politely, but said nothing. "As a cunning businessman, Herr Flick, you must understand that the continuation of slavery as it currently operates will drag down all aspects of our economy, including Daimler-Benz? This is an opportunity to not only serve your Reich and the cause of National Socialism, but to make a profit while doing so."\n\n"I want a larger offer of collateral," Flick finally spoke after a minute of intense silence. "I'm sure you will be happy to negotiate. After all, I have a good amount of resources for these camp constructions."\n\nBormann knew that appealing to the man's dual love of ideology and currency would sway him. He could probably be trusted, but nonetheless Bormann would ensure that a great level of oversight would be provided to Daimler-Benz's contribution to the Modern Wunderwaffe."

Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "Your hesitance is understandable. After all, Reichswerke is a huge company, and investing so much into the slave camps and ghettos poses an obvious risk."\n\n"I know it does," Edmund snapped back. "I travelled this way to hear your arguments, not mine. Reichswerke is rich and powerful, and will hugely benefit your plans. But why should I help you?"\n\n"Not as rich and powerful as IG Farben," Bormann responded, restraining his anger at the CEO's impudence. "Yet. Such a high risk project would yield a high reward, high enough to propel you far above your rivals. When people talk of corporate giants, it is Edmund Geilenberg they shall think of - not Hermann Josef Abs."\n\nThe man's beady eyes lit up in interest. Bormann had to proceed with caution. He knew what a risky partner Reichswerke would make, and effective oversight would be difficult to maintain."

He was a portly man with a greying mustache and a black three-piece suit. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began.\n\n"Cigar?" Abs interjected, opening his case. Bormann stared into the businessman's cunning eyes, unfazed, and accepted. The two men puffed deeply on their thick cigars and filled the room with smoke. "I was most intrigued by your offer. IG Farben, naturally, is the largest corporation in Europe. We have the most resources to utilize for your... projects. Unfortunately, slavery has been a large part of our success, if your plans for economic revival fail, then so will my company. I will need many, many subsidies and assurances if you expect me to agree to this deal."\n\n"Then there is much to negotiate," Bormann replied, blowing more smoke into the air. Abs was a ruthless businessman, one whose help would almost guarantee an improved economy. Of course, if the Modern Wunderwaffe initiative proved successful, Abs and IG Farben would only grow more powerful.\n\n"Let us begin. My Führer." His tone was almost mocking."

Forced to stay on his feet for hours on end, constantly on the move, and even sometimes hearing the crack of a whip followed by a pained yell that always accompanied it. Life was not easy in Łódź - at least, that's what it used to be called. Now it was called Litzmannstadt, which the 47-year-old man found to be a horrific butchering of one of Poland's cities. Yet he could do nothing about it. Only toil and toil, until his body gave out.\n\nHe had worked in a car plant before for some company he never got the name of, but apparently the higher-ups decided that he was 'worthy'. Worthy of what - dying before 50 from overworking himself to death? The other men around him were much younger than he was, and the slightest suspicion came to him that he was merely an administrative error. No matter. He had railroad tracks to lay, work to do, a life to keep. Even if it was a hollow and meaningless one.\n\nOne day, Antonin came to work and saw that a young man had come up to him - Aleksy, he was called. A bright man, he was. A shame the Germans didn't look at him that way.\n\n"Mister Antonin!" He shouted, calling the man to attention. "Mister Antonin, have you heard the news?"\n\nHe sighed, tempted to give Aleksy a taste of black humor, but relented. He didn't have to be a depressive man to be around. "What is it, Mister Aleksy?" He asked, half-curious and half-not, but the younger man seemed excited.\n\n"They're tellin' us..." He rubbed the back of his neck. "Well... I've heard, I guess, that some of us might go back to Poland. Live with our own!" The heavy steel that creaked Antonin's back was set down on the floor as Antonin gave him a glare shot with both concern and copious amounts of distrust. Aleksy could immediately feel some of his happiness begin dispersing.\n\n"Boy...""

 bor_econ.107.d:0 "There was a reason there was a saying for it. Like rivers, the great streams of Europe's infrastructure controlled the ebb and flow of people and resources into the estuary of Rome. Caesar had seized an empire with symbols and blood, but Rome kept an empire with roads. When all roads lead to Rome, victory can only travel in one direction. However, even the mightiest of empires fall, and Rome fell to none other than the Germans themselves. Decadence and degeneracy had gripped the nation, much like it gripped Europe before the Germans wrestled rightful control back over the continent.\n\nOne man can't rule an empire, though if any man could, Bormann knew it was him. Regrettably, he had to share the reins with the petty Führers of the Reichskommissariats. It was these individuals that he needed to build the roads to his new Rome. Goethe had called Rome the 'capital of the world', but that title belonged to Germania now, and it was time the economic flows of the continent reflected it.\n\nBormann entered the Volkshalle's main meeting room to find the bickering dukes of the Reich's colonies suddenly standing to attention. 'Heil Bormann!' The Führer nodded approvingly, and sat down. The Reichskommissars followed.\n\nThe plan was laid out. Infrastructure projects across the Reichskommissariats would be built to ensure the direction of power went to the Reich. Germany must remain the undisputed hegemon of Europe, lest it fall back into the liberal decadence Hitler rescued it from. Railways, oil pipelines, electricity grids. "Think of it like integration," Bormann said. "The Reich and her allies combined to become more powerful collectively than they could ever imagine separately."\n\nBormann added a final touch. "Of course, for their own defensive purposes, the Reichskommissariats would be wise to collaborate with the most powerful military in Europe," the Führer stated. "Germania's enemies fear her for a reason."\n\nFor a second each, Bormann made eye contact with the Reich's Dukes, making sure they understood what he meant. Satisfied with his work, the Führer rose, and exited the room."

More accurately, this involves giving a lot of scientists a lot of money and hoping they come up with something. The best thing is, this strategy usually worked.\n\nBormann sometimes considered himself a man of science. He had massive respect for the discipline, and the great Aryan minds who had originated its every moment of progress. It was these minds who he had now bestowed a massive investment in; research and development firms across the Reich were now to receive government grants for every new project started. Germany was already indisputably the world's centre of science and thought, but the Führer knew it could be so much more.\n\nBeyond realising the German ideals of science and progress, Bormann understood that these investments would provide a massive boon to the German economy. As a centre of innovation, the Ruhr would now be able to compete with the best of California or Tokyo. This was just securing this reputation however. There was never a doubt of German supremacy, of course."

In an effort to better bind the notoriously independently minded firms to his will, Führer Bormann has declared the introduction of a set of price controls and asserted that whilst raw material may be extracted by private firms, this material is property of the Reich and must be purchased at prices set by the Economic Ministry. Similarly all sales to the government will be made at predetermined prices.\n\nWhilst this would otherwise cause a colossal shortfall in revenue for these titans of industry, the price controls are accompanied by a generous plan of subsidies to make up the shortfall. Notable figures such as Hermann Josef Abs and Friedrich Flick are reported to have voiced their displeasure in private, though they have little recourse other than to bow to the Führer's wishes and continue business as usual, lest they want to find their firms dismantled and themselves behind bars.\n\nThe money will continue to flow, but every transaction now takes place one step closer to the government.

The ring of swiveling chairs faced one another in the centre, upholstered in garish orange, while the wood-panelled walls were festooned with screens and blinking lights. Whilst it was only a mockup, he could see the intention - surrounded by all the information of the Reich, he could pick up a figure with a swing of his legs and a spin - and it was far more organised a system than the mountains of paperwork he was usually inundated in. Even if it did look like he was captain of a spaceship.\n\n"And what exactly do these computers do that a person cannot? I have hundreds of economic planners working tirelessly towards the same goal."\n\nA glint appeared in the scientist's eye, one that Bormann recognised as that of a salesman who has been asked just the right question. He leaned forward in the uncomfortable chair. "That may be what they tell you, but no man can work without rest. If they give you their all you can get at most twelve hours a day at peak efficiency, and that's with toilet breaks, smoking breaks, lunch breaks. Cybersyn does not rest, does not eat, and has no opinion. It cannot deceive, or complain, or strike. It simply sees the figures and finds the pattern. A shortage of coal in the Rhineland will alert mines in the Ruhr, overproduction of ammunition in Prussia will be sent to Ukraine without even a phone call, and strikes in Silesia will be detected automatically and the central government informed."\n\nBormann leaned back. For a scientist, the man sure knew how to sell. If one couldn't trust a machine, what could one trust?"

He had instructed the men to ignore him, and they were doing their best, aside from the one whose chair Bormann occupied. He was doing his best not to glower at his Führer when he thought he wasn't looking. Their chairs revolved back and forth like repelling magnets as they called out percentages and figures - they seemed to not use words like "the" and "and", or indeed any of the words that were required to form a sentence, but nonetheless they seemed to understand one another implicitly. The room was almost identical to the mockup, with the exception of a number of ashtrays to contain the impressive amount of cigarettes the seven planners were going through.\n\nBormann kicked against the floor, sending his chair into a spin. He could indeed see practically anything he desired - production figures in Hamburg, unemployment in Munich, administrative expenses in Germania. Cybersyn had already performed an impressive cull on useless civil servants and streamlined production pipelines enough to pay for itself, and the engineers had been considering an expansion of its computing power to delegate yet more functions to the ever-expanding network of transistors.\n\nA future where he didn't need economists... Bormann sighed wistfully and kicked his chair into another spin. For a brief moment, science had gone up in his estimation. Except the owner of this chair. He would have to be disappeared."

While Cybersyn's designers had done an impressive job with the Reich's finances it seemed they were far less adept at managing their own. With belt-tightening occurring across the Reich, funding had dried up, until Bormann had finally been notified the company had gone under.\n\nAt the outbreak of the crisis the Entscheidungsnetzwerk had been undergoing a period of upgrade and maintenance, with only limited operational capability. The additional computers that had been ordered lay piled next to a vast square of empty floor spaces, yet more cables lying in a great unordered mound. The technicians had moved on to greener pastures before it could be completed, and until the plans could be dug up and implemented the whole system was running on limited capacity.

A concept that has been bounced around since Hitler's incumbency, the Breitspurbahn plan has been retooled somewhat. Hitler's original plans - called "visionary" and "too bold" in polite terms, have been toned down somewhat - the original plan to more than double the railway gauge across the Reich has been toned down to a one-third increase, though alongside the new railways will be strung a new network of autobahns.\n\nOther Reichministers have been rumoured to be unhappy about the disproportionate funding this particular project is receiving.

Nonetheless, he knew that these events were important, and such commemorations expected. For a project of this size and expense, it was important that it was shown to be legitimate and useful. The Amsterdam-Hamburg-Germania line would be the first showcase of this to the Reich - and the world.\n\nHe smiled for the media, as he stood with several other officials on an elevated deck of the station, with gaudy streamers and German flags spread throughout it. It hurt his eyes, but he knew the benefit of putting on a show - and shows needed accompanying speeches, of which he gave now.\n\nHe praised the hardworking Germans who had built it, shook hands with the train conductor who would drive the inaugural ride, as well as the train staff, all of whom stood solidly at attention as Bormann went to each of them, shaking their hands and tried to inject some enthusiasm into his movements.\n\nThe ribbon placed in front of the station entrance was cut to applause, and he boarded the inaugural train ride with the rest of the officials.

Most notably, Reichswerke has been found to own a selection of companies registered in the United States of America, through which they have been investing in American companies and funneling foreign currency towards their own accounts, by which they divest their investment in companies worldwide.\n\nDue to the refusal of many nations to accept the Reichsmark as valid currency or even exchange it for their own, the value of the Reichsmark in relation to other currencies is highly variable at best. Reichswerke however has subverted this obstacle by exchanging their goods directly for American dollars through shell corporations in Sweden, a close trading partner of the Reich that also maintains contact with the USA.

Still, there was a strange beauty to the roiling flame.\n\nHe glanced behind him - the column of armoured vehicles stretched further than the naked eye could see. Tank treads had made a crumpled mess of the roads, and his men had taken to walking alongside rather than pick through the rubble.

The SU is Germany's shield in the struggle against dissidents and terrorists who seek to threaten the Reich. The bureau's main task involves spying on and gathering data of any citizen suspect of treasonous activities and operates through a vast network of informants, both voluntary and not. The SU works closely with other bureaus, as its agents must never act on any information they acquire to protect their secrecy.\n\nGehlen himself has supervised the training of these new agents, and many are now infiltrating every sector of German society.

He had no rivals that would have sent a man after him, and no mugger would be this dedicated to a single mark. His wife, Elise, had protested against Hindenburg's coalition with the NSDAP, but that was years ago, before even the war had been won. Surely they could not be seeking revenge for that, after Elise had proven herself dedicated to Germany in the years since. Was this all because Peter had previously worked for Erhard, Speer's man?\n\nIn the back of his mind, however, Peter knew what had occurred, what they had found out. Years ago, before the collapse, he and Elise had hidden a young Jewish girl in their basement. It had just been  for a few weeks while Elise's brother had been under investigation.

He had frankly no idea how Speidel had won over support by preaching such blatant cowardice, but it was something that needed to be dealt with all the same.\n\nHe decided that what was needed was an appeal to the conservative faction, the silent majority that Bormann knew made up most of the OKW. In celebrating their victory over Schörner, the Führer would be certain to condemn all radicals alike, and express above all how Schörner too had pushed for the Reich to change. Speidel may have had a loud mouth, but he would not be able to stand up to a true challenge from the Reich's finest.

He had even allowed himself to imagine that Bormann would be praising Speidel and his men for the good work they had done in the name of the Reich. However, it seemed the Führer had other plans for this address.\n\nHe had first begun discussing Schörner's treason, yes, but he had quickly taken a turn into more unexpected political venues. "When our soldiers pledge their loyalty to the Reich and to Hitler, they attempt to place their actions on the Reich and the Great Führer himself. They are not able to defend themselves against madmen, and as such, lunatics like Schörner are able to bastardize their ideals by professing that their treason is done in the Reich's name, or to fulfill Hitler's vision. From now on, all soldiers are to pledge loyalty only to the Führer. After all, the Führer is Hitler's successor, and his will is the will of the Reich. All else is unnecessary."\n\nSpeidel's jaw dropped, the man in awe. The arrogance and self-absorption it required was astounding. For a moment, he considered walking off stage, or verbally condemning Bormann, though he knew such thoughts were scandal and folly. All he could do was simply stand beside the man, making it clear by his frown and furrowed brow that he did not endorse this move. He would never renounce the oaths he had sworn to the German people and German nation, no matter what Bormann said.

He could not allow Schörner to consolidate power, that was for certain. They would need to find a way to discredit the man. Naturally, he could not be permitted to retain his position as Chief of the OKW, but Bormann also figured that, whilst they were cracking down on the Reformists, they could perhaps happen to find evidence of sympathies on some of Schörner's associates.

Now, there was a completely and utterly different company, Reich's Industrial Holdings, that just so happened to coincidentally own the exact assets once owned by Reichswerke, and, just as coincidentally, happened to be completely and utterly personally subservient to the Führer. As the mythical Atlas held the sky, so too did Reichswerke, and as Reichswerke held the sky, so too must Bormann.

Müller had defined the Ordnungspolizei in its modern role, transitioning it from one of many policing and security organizations to the dominant intelligence agency within the Reich. It was almost a tragedy to undo so much of his work, but the Führer demanded results and Gehlen had resolved to be the man to deliver them.\n\nHis first action, as dictated by Bormann himself, was a total restructuring of the organization under his leadership - and how could he refuse such an offer? The power of the pencil-pusher was an oft underestimated one. With but a flick of his pen he could remove Müller's most trusted men from contact with one another and send them to opposite ends of the Reich. Yes, with this newfound control he could begin the task of digging out conspiracy root and stem. The Führer would hear only good things from now on - he would make sure of it."

With the Orpo's miserable failure to apprehend the members of the cabal at their clandestine meeting, Dietrich and Weber were the only leads they had, and their absence had been noted.\n\nHe had received a multitude of anonymous letters from "concerned party members" demanding to know what warranted the detainment of such apparently unimportant men. He had ordered an investigation into who was sending these letters, which seemed to be being circulated throughout the lower levels of the party. He had been informed, however, that whoever was responsible was skilled at covering their tracks, and arresting everyone found with a copy of the letter would require a purge of the party, an action he was not yet ready to take. No doubt it was the cabal doing their best to swell their ranks. All he could do was sit back and hope the Orpo knew what they were doing."

Many Germans have instead resorted to cycling or walking to work - if they have work to return to. The economic slump has resulted in upwards of a million Germans losing their jobs."\n\nBormann turned off his television with a sigh. He was receiving more flak than was fired in the Battle of Britain, and this crisis wasn't even his fault! He should have expected this crash as soon as the Italians established their empire.

The officers gave the order to fire, and the sounds of gunshots erupted through the air. A rocket soared upwards with the grace of an eagle and smashed into the tail of the escaping machine. The helicopter spun wildly out of control, black smoke trailing it as it raced down to meet the roof of the compound once again.

The black eagle adorning that banner, not clasping the symbol of the darkness that had descended upon Germany for over thirty years, was a remnant of an era lost, of opportunities slipped between the fingers of all of those present, including the man within the coffin.

The funeral was not just a symbol of a Germany lost, but also of a spirit of hope for the future, in the mind of many of the attendees. The rings of police surrounding the crowd disagreed, many of them clearly itching for any excuse to break up the protest masquerading as a funeral.

Still, he knew a call on the direct line had to be someone important.\n\n"Cut the shit, Müller, I want answers."\n\nEven here, half a hemisphere away, everyone would be able to recognize the voice on the other end. Müller tensed momentarily; old soldier's reflexes however quickly faded into resentful relaxation. He rolled his weight in his creaky chair and stamped his boots to create an impression of standing up, then gave a half-hearted "Heil Bormann! How can I help you, mein Führer?"\n\nEven through the crackle of the international line, Bormann's voice seethed with cold fury. "Mind your tone, Müller. Your friends in Germania would not mind me promoting you to Reichskommissar for Moskowien once we restore order in the area."\n\nMüller's grin faded. "Understood, mein Führer. How may I serve the Reich?"\n\n"Göring. I know you have him cooped up somewhere down there. I assume I do not need to tell you the punishment for harboring an enemy of the Reich?"\n\nMüller's grip tightened around the phone. Of course he knew of Göring, he was not the idiot playboy most people took him as. He had known since the second a group of Prussian refugees had paid him far too well for a ship up the Congo and a mansion in Hitlerstadt; his mercenaries had the whole journey watched. Both leverage with the refugees and a way to stick it to that bald, sanctimonious prick who now called himself Führer. But how much did Bormann know? Was it worth the risk keeping Göring?"

The Reichskommissar admitted he had Göring in Zentralafrika, and that was what mattered.\n\n"Good, then I propose joint action to take down the fugitive. I will have some experts flown down to assist your men in the arrest of the possibly dangerous individuals he have no doubt brought with him. I expect prompt results, Müller, your position may depend on it."\n\nHanging up, he could not suppress a grin and barely stopped himself from drumming a cheery tune on his desk. He knew he would dream sweet dreams tonight, of Göring crying and pissing himself as his men closed in. This victory had been a long time coming."

While his thoughts were a blurry mess of sorrowful memories and regrets, he barely even registered the banging at the front door at first, but when he heard a guard cry out in alarm before disappearing in a storm of what he recognized as gunshots even in his current state, Göring stumbled to his feet. The French! The French were attacking the aerodrome! Why had that fool Reinhard not ordered the planes up before they got this close? He tried to concentrate. Small arms fire, not fighters. Damn, he needed a pistol! Where... ah yes, of course, his coat! Scrambling to the closet, he found his hat and coat, to his relief with his trusty Luger in it. Putting on the clothes as best he could, he stumbled towards the office door and towards the sounds of combat downstairs.\n\nGöring emerged at the top of the staircase, firing a shot blindly at one of the blurry soldiers battling below. He noted with satisfaction that the figure grunted and fell over, before taking aim at another figure. Click. He looked with confusion at his weapon. Why would he have loaded his gun with only one bullet? With a dissatisfied grunt he made his way back to the office. Maybe there were some rounds in a desk drawer.\n\nLocating something small and round in the top drawer of the desk, Göring decided to pull aside the office curtains for light. The sweeping vista of Lake Congo nearly blinded him, but also caused the memories to come flooding back. Like in a haze, he looked at the pill in his hand. Oh. As the sounds of combat drew closer, Göring knew what he had to do to win one last victory. Trembling, he put the pill between his teeth."

As he looked on the mud-smeared, pitiful heap wrapped in its own coat, Marcel couldn't believe that just yesterday the former Führer had terrified him for several minutes.\n\nThe Germans had entered the mansion first, to make sure Göring was not on the ground floor. His own Belgians followed close behind, to give fire support against the militarist hardliners who had followed their leader into exile. His lieutenant was in the process of giving him an order when a pistol bullet had ripped through his gut. Atop the staircase on Marcel's left, the former Reichsmarschall had stood, wildeyed and with a half-buttoned greatcoat on, despite the African heat. For whatever reason, he never put a second shot in Marcel, but retreated to his office. The young man's heart had been pounding the entire rest of the battle, until they stormed Göring's office. Luckily for them there was no casualties in taking the man into arrest, as he was already dead by the time they arrived.\n\nHe turned to the officer from Germania, who was ordering the other mercenaries and soldiers from the Heimat to grab shovels. "You wanted to see us, Hauptmann?"\n\n"Indeed, Herr Dupont. You and Herr Woynitz here were the ones to find the traitor's suicide note. Please sign this document."\n\nMarcel frowned as he signed the peace of paper on Klaus' back. "There was a suicide note?"\n\n"Of course, Herr Bucard, you read it yourself. He wrote of how radical militarists had strung him along to betray the rightful Führer, and he killed himself in shame over all the devastation and chaos he had brought to the Reich. He even ended it with a call for all Germans to rally around Führer Bormann. You wouldn't forget that, would you?"\n\nMarcel's eyes widened. "Of course Hauptmann, we remember now, don't we Klaus?""

The thought of Hüttig made Bormann think again about the letter he had gotten. The only supposed witness to Göring's arrival in Africa had been one of Hüttig's SS-men, and Bormann knew well enough how Hüttig loathed Müller, constantly writing the Reich Chancellery with requests for his removal from office. Could the bastard have been trying to play the Führer for a fool, the puppet in his games? Bormann's anger grew as he kept convincing himself he had been used and humiliated by the Himmler-loving freak in Bouhlerstadt.\n\nWithin the hour, the African Abwehr had been ordered to refocus their efforts on Hans Hüttig for suspected sedition, with only a small increase in resources for the monitoring of Müller."

After several minutes of awkward silence where Müller could do little but study the sweat stains on the soldier's short-sleeved shirt, the other goon who had answered the door returned with the man Müller was actually looking for. The former claimant to the Führer's office was thinner and paler than he remembered, looking slightly sickly. The Reichskommissar made a mental note to send one of his good French doctors by, but remained all smiles.\n\n"Hermann Meyer! Good to see you, it has been too long my friend! When did we last meet, '58?"\n\nGöring smiled weakly. "In another world, Siegfried. I see there is still no hiding from you though, hunter instincts to the last."\n\n"Ah, but today you are not the prey, Herr Meyer. At least if you and your... companions get into my car and leave this crisp Hitlerstadt air for a week's hunt with me, you can enjoy the hunt like last time. Also, going elsewhere, well.." Müller turned and motioned as if showing off the neighborhood. "Let us just say it would mean we would not have to inconvenience any Abwehr agents who may or may not have requested to search this part of town for signs of some refugee politician."\n\nGöring grinned, for the first time in years."

He was almost normal only a few days ago."\n\nThe doctor began packing up his kit to return to Müller's residence across Congo Lake. "Malaria can kill quickly in patients with underlying health conditions, and Messieur Göring has been skipping out on his quinine. I would need to do an autopsy to be certain, but my guess is critical liver failure. The liver cannot take being hammered by both... relaxing substances, and malaria at once. My condolences for your loss."\n\nBernd paled. Göring was dead. Göring the war hero, Göring the political operator, Göring the icon for millions of younger men like him. He had not died in battle or from an assassin's bullet in the night, but from a completely regular and treatable tropic disease, wasting away in this sweltering shithole. This wasn't right, the world wasn't right.\n\nSwearing an oath in his mind that he would not rest until the Reichsmarschall was avenged and that swine Bormann deposed, Bernd stood up and raised an arm towards the pale body of Hermann Göring."

Even the most dense of Abwehr agents could make the connection between the rumors of Göring's death from malaria and the militarist pilgrimages made to the mansion in his crown jewel of a city. To top it off Bernd von Brauchitsch had penned a short biography of the tragic life of the former Reichsmarschall, called "Richthofen's Heir." No, Müller had to make this statement, and now. A producer signaled to him to start.\n\n"Citizens of the Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika! This is your Reichskommissar, Siegfried Müller. I speak to you to bring you grave news! The former Reichsmarschall and alleged traitor of the Reich, Hermann Göring, has been found dead in Hitlerstadt, apparently having caught malaria while hiding from our patrols searching for the possible fugitive. While this traitor has found justice in death, I would like to remind all citizens that public gatherings without official approval is illegal..."\n\nThe tape arrived in Germania the next day. Bormann did not watch it, in fact he barely emerged from his office for a full day after receiving the news via telegram. When he finally did emerge, his face was like a wax mask, frozen and neutral.

The occultist sects, degenerate gatherings of misbegotten people bent to foreign influence and irrational beliefs, had been banned almost thirty years ago thanks to his personal intervention, but now they have risen once more: sprouting as fungi on a rotting trunk, these parasites threaten once more the purity of the Aryan people...\n\nAs he crunches the papers in his hand, he already knows the answer to a thousand unspoken questions. Heinrich Himmler - the snake! - has always been a devotee of the occultist creed, and many prominent officials kept practising their debauched ways under his wing even after the Hess-Aktion, kept away from righteous punishment by the powerful SS-Reichsführer: ever since the Ordensstaat was created, Himmler had dropped all pretense of compliance to German law, and now everyone can see the fruits of his criminal intent.\n\nThere is no time to be lost.

The message wasn't to join the Luftwaffe, or sign up for the army, or to salute the poster. They were reminders: Behave or die. That was what they all really said. Hans suddenly felt intimidated. He ran off, the gaze of Bormann following him."

The sculptor moped around the gallery, assessing the damage. The expertly crafted busts of Bormann, Hewel and - of course - Hitler were all intact.\n\nBreker stopped in his tracks. The top of the small marble podium, where there had once been a beautiful effigy of Reichsmarschall Göring, was empty. Oh well. It had been an excellent bust of a horrible man.\n\nBreker's blood suddenly ran cold. Why had they taken the bust of Göring, but left Speer's shattered on his floor? Was this a message?

Breker couldn't tell which dust used to belong to which sculpture. Distraught, the sculptor began to aimlessly wander around the gallery, hoping for some modicum of relief. Instead he only saw more destruction.\n\nMost of the sculptures were intact, thank god, but many of them were completely destroyed. Goebbels' bust was gone, leaving only an empty pedestal. Breker had expected this of the Führer. The bust of the late Reichsmarschall was also destroyed, again, another expected move. But why Zehnkämpfer and Die Siegerin? They were merely representations of the strength of the Reich, there wasn't even a slight indication that they were in support of Speer or Göring. Breker puzzled over the ruins for what felt like hours, attempting to work out the Führer's reasoning. He couldn't. Breker shook his head and left the gallery.

He knew his mommy would scold him if she caught little Thomas sitting so close to the TV - it was bad for his eyes, she always said - but this was his favourite show, and he wasn't about to miss a single moment.\n\nThomas couldn't decide which of the villains he hated more: The balding Speer, dressed in crimson, was always threatening the innocent civilians with his hammer and sickle; the crazy Göring, a rabid dog with the bloated face of a human, couldn't stop spewing foam over his three chins; and the terrifying Heydrich, the black marionette pulled around by devilish schemers off-screen. Thank God they were all gone!\n\nThe villains were as dastardly as their nemesis was heroic. Thomas loved Bormann, the tall warrior clad in shining armor like a Teutonic Knight from the history books. No matter how much the villainous trio tried to destroy Germany, the Führer would arrive without fail by the end of the episode, foiling their evil plots and brutally smiting their henchmen with his mighty sword. Whenever Thomas saw Bormann giving a speech on TV, he waited eagerly for the man to don a suit of armor with a smile and a wink.\n\nEvery episode capped off the action with the "Heil Zeit!", a minute-long musical segment in which the Horst Wessel Lied played over dramatic images of Hitler and Bormann. As glued as he was to the TV when the show was playing, Thomas never failed to get up onto his feet and yell for the neighbours to hear when the 'Heil Zeit!' played. He'd happily sing and heil along, laughing all the while. "Heil Hitler!", "Heil Bormann!". "Heil Hitler!", "Heil Bormann!". "Heil Hitler!", "Heil Bormann!"."

Whenever the two brothers hung out, Thomas would quietly read or do homework while his brother stared fixedly at the TV. Yet there was one show that made Thomas pay attention. His childhood favorite.\n\nRoland seemed to like it just as much as he did, and hanging out with his brother gave Thomas an excuse to see how the show had evolved. Despite the improvements in animation, it was mostly the same drivel: the knightly Bormann would face off against a bunch of cartoonishly evil villains and destroy them with ease. This time the episode was about the 'Oil Crisis'. Bormann was helping the German army fight against its vague enemies in the Middle East, riding through the sand on a white horse with a golden lance. Thomas felt a pang of anxiety as he pictured his older cousin in the Heer, fighting on that foreign soil.\n\nWhen the 'Heil Zeit!' began, the unsubtle minute dedicated to praising Bormann, he rolled his eyes, though soon found himself overwhelmed with nostalgia. Roland was begging him to join in. Their parents wouldn't be pleased if they overheard their older son chanting along to a morning cartoon. After all, Thomas had caught his parents sharing a few choice words about Bormann over coffee in the mornings.

This episode heavily featured the late Parteikanzler Baldur von Schirach, a posh effeminate man with limp wrists and a mincing gait, who schemed to destroy Germany. He was beaten up by Bormann in the end, who was wearing that same antique suit of armor Thomas remembered from the old days. He grinned at the ridiculousness of it all. How had he ever enjoyed this garbage?\n\nAs an ignorant child, he had feasted on Nazi propaganda like a starving man with a bowl of stew. Bormann had been a symbol of unity and pride for the Fatherland. He was, as his uncle often proclaimed, a humble man continuing Hitler's legacy. Yet as Thomas had aged, so had the bloated Führer. The country was torn apart by the mass purges, and his Catholic father had suffered a mental breakdown after the abolition of the churches. Thomas' mother had not gone a day without crying since the death of her brother, shot alongside all of the secretaries and deputies of their Gauleiter. He had been purged during the Second Night.\n\nHe heard the doorbell ring, and quickly turned off the TV, grabbing his jacket and placard. Something held him back. Thomas knew he was placing his family at risk. His father, his mother, his younger brother Roland. Yet he had no choice. Someone had to stand up to the sadistic thugs in power.

If they had bothered to ask his name, he would have smiled faintly and introduced himself as "Martin".\n\nMartin had expected the sweltering heat, the buzzing insects, and the threat of savage partisans when he signed up for the Zentralafrikan army all those years ago. He had expected to be treated differently from the others, as though his father's achievements were somehow reflected through him. Even the flattering safari trips with the jovial Reichskommissar Müller, although unanticipated, had not truly surprised him.\n\nNo. What Martin was not prepared for, what he could never have been prepared for, were the horrors of the South African War.\n\nSleepless nights in the rain as the distant sounds of gunfire tore through the air. Numbing marches through the jungle as his backpack dragged him down. He had watched his men die before his very eyes. Germans. Boers. Anglos. Americans. Africans. Their blood all ran red through the dirt.\n\nMartin had killed many men. With his guns. With his grenades. With his knife. How he himself was still alive was nothing less than... a miracle? Not once had he considered it so. Surely the miracle would have been a sudden bullet to the head. Were it not for his penpal, Martin would have surely lost his mind. The only thing that dragged him through the pain and the fear was the knowledge that, during moments of rest, he could write a new letter to his friend.\n\nWhen Zentralafrika collapsed, Martin abandoned his loyal troops, turned north and... walked. He slept in ditches and drank from streams. He hunted wild animals and hid from roaming gangs of bandits. When he finally settled into Italian territory, pens found their way into his hand and he began writing again. Had he not reforged that special connection, would he have ever travelled back to the Fatherland?"

Would his sisters turn their attention away from their husbands and children? As for his father...\n\nHis father. The most affection that man had ever shown was the day Martin left for Afrika. He had slapped his eldest on the back, nodded his approval, and returned to his bulletproof car. A wave of uneasiness washed over him as he approached the customs officer. Would anger or apathy engulf his father when he learned of Martin's return? Or had the pressures of power changed him? His pen pal had told him enough times that all men had the potential to change. Martin would never have even returned to Germany were it not for that wise man's counsel.\n\n"Next!" The customs officer beckoned him over. "Passport."\n\n"It's a fake passport," Martin replied. "My real name is Martin Bormann."\n\n"And I'm Richard Nixon," the customs officer said without smiling.

Yet the new Party Minister never wore his emotions on his sleeve. Was he about to announce a change in weather, or the outbreak of World War Three?\n\n"Your son has returned, my Führer! General Martin Bormann Junior is alive and well."\n\n"Oh." The chair creaked softly as Bormann leaned backwards in shock. He wasn't expecting that. Could it be true? Was little Krönzi alive?

Are, are we sure this isn't an impostor?"\n\n"He carries your son's Iron Cross, my Führer," Klopfer continued. "He's been detained at customs." He placed a few photographs gently on the desk.

He looked uncomfortable; he was always more at ease behind a desk than behind a podium. Nonetheless, he began his speech with a practiced bombasity, doing his best to emulate the oratory of the great Führer who had preceded him. If he failed, he wouldn't know it. There was nothing he could do or say there on the podium that the sycophants of the inner party would not cheer and applaud.\n\n"The Reich's devolution into chaos, hardship and brotherly war," Bormann began, awkwardly at the papers on his podium, "can be placed at the feet of one organization, and one man. Some within our Reich would foolishly blame National Socialism, and seek to reform the country to adopt the degenerate customs of the West. Others would worship the Wehrmacht above all, seeking to turn our Reich into a mindless animal, lashing out at all around it. These false ideas and the traitors that held them have been justly excised from our Reich." Bormann paused here again, subtly gesturing with his hand for the crowd to cheer on the deaths of the militarists and reformers. They did, tepidly, and he continued. "But they all failed to see the true problem that plagued us. The only one of our great internal enemies that yet lingers on. Heinrich Himmler and his servants in Paris!" This time, the Volkshalle needed no prompting. They enthusiastically applauded the vilification of Himmler and his hated SS, and kept cheering as Bormann finished. "It was their machinations, their sabotage, the mistake of gifting them their fiefdom, that weakened our Reich and caused so much devastation for our people. It is their hands that are dirtied with the blood of so many fallen sons!""

 bormann.1701.desc:0 "It had been so many months now since the fall of the French State at the hands of Heinrich Himmler's Burgundian SS. Established by Germany and the loyalist Frenchmen following their defeat by Hitler, the French regime had been an ally of the Reich for a generation, participating in the Einheitspakt and economically dependent upon the Reich for its meagre industry. Ironically, it was the limits imposed on their state by Germania that had doomed them. The skeleton army permitted by Hitler had no chance of resisting Himmler's SS, and their downfall had been in many ways inevitable since the last Führer's passing.\n\nStill, it would not do to meekly accept their downfall at the hands of our new enemies. The rebellious SS-Ordensstaat might occupy a lion's share of former French territory, but France still lives on in the south, and we are better throwing our lot in with them than permitting Himmler to rule over his fiefdom unchallenged. The Reich shall issue a formal declaration, to France and to all nations, firmly denouncing Burgundy's invasion and refusing to recognize under any circumstances the territorial acquisitions of the SS during the German Civil War. Of course, simply saying as much will do nothing to reverse those acquisitions, but it will at least remind the French regime that we are their friends, and remind the whole world that it is not the Reich that is the black state polluting the face of Europe: it is Burgundy."

The work, Schützen und überleben, tells the tale of a black eagle chick, freshly hatched in its nest. The tree that the black eagle lives in is home to another nest, in which a careless and lazy bald eagle chick lives. The black eagle's mother makes sure her nest is strong and stable, and builds it on the thickest branch on the tree. The bald eagle's nest is built on the tallest branch, a thin little twig that juts out about the rest of the tree, from where the bald eagles look down on the black eagles.\n\nOne day, a great storm comes, turning the sky black with dark clouds, and shaking the tree on which both nests are perched. The black eagle chick stays safe in its nest, swaying only slightly, the chick safe underneath its mother's wings. The weaker and taller branch that the bald eagle's nest is built on sways wildly in the wind, and the bald eagle falls, unable to fly in the storm and plummeting to the ground unseen. The bald eagle chicken looks up at the sky and sees the dark clouds in the sky begin to form into the black sun sigil of the SS, illuminated by lightning. As climactic music plays, the bald eagle's branch snaps, and the nest and chick both fall down into the dark sky below.\n\nOnce the storm fades, the watching children witness that all of the branches on the tree broke off, except for the one: the strongest branch, which the black eagle mother had wisely picked. The black eagle mother talks to the children of Germany directly, telling them to listen to their elders and to stay safe and protected from the storms that might come to their own tree. The chick agrees, as it leaps out of its nest at its mothers behest and begins to fly for the first time, soaring amongst a bright blue sky."

On the other hand, maybe unremarkableness was a positive in this sort of profession.\n\n"These are the department heads, Müller? They are all assembled?"\n\nThe intelligence officer nodded, stone faced.\n\nBormann nodded back, and after a quick scan around the room for any secretary who had not followed the order to stay in their office, Bormann descended the stairs until his face was only barely higher than that of the agents. After noting several of them were taller than him, he figured it was the most appropriate place to stand so they could all hear him without drawing attention to his height. He cleared his throat while the agents saluted him.\n\n"Gentlemen, good of you to join us. I believe you have all received your dossiers? It is critical we commit all available resources to Operation Westerwald. If you follow me to the War Room, the Oberkommando representative will brief us on all our current knowledge of Gefahr Bruno.

Now having received eager confirmation from the French government, they were forwarded to Rome with little delay. Alongside them was a small Italian portfolio detailing how recent German moves towards reconciliation with the Breton state had driven a wedge into already strained Franco-German relations, prompting Bordeaux to look for new allies abroad with Italy being a major element in their considerations.\n\nThe document now sits on a polished desk in Rome, and two options have made themselves clear: To embrace France's desperation and solidify our relations with a new European ally or to abandon the French in their frantic search for allies. Both decisions will surely alter the balance of powers in Europe, allowing us to either dedicate resources to a new and willing bulwark against German influence or, on the other hand, to shun the Bordeaux government and consolidate our own sphere of influence against German aggression.

The current German Führer, Martin Bormann, is reportedly furious with the French for their disloyalty and has vowed punitive measures for defying the articles of the alliance the French claim the Germans have been ignoring almost since the start. Direct conflict between the states is however considered unlikely due to being separated by the rogue state known as Burgundy, and German hesitance to challenge the Italian sphere on the battlefield in its current economic and social predilections.

Himmler had never been a friend, but outwardly they had maintained a veneer of cordiality and respect. In reality, one had always tried to undermine the other, and both were locked into a Great Game for the control of the Party. This Game lasted well into the West Russian War and ended with the Reichsführer's betrayal and the attempted SS coup. Now, Bormann thought, Himmler and himself were locked into a Cold War, one that was heating up every day that passed.\n\nHis cigar was close to burning his fingers. The Führer threw it in the ashtray and lit another one. He tried reading one of Hewel's documents, but his mind once again wandered to the past. The SS coup had been the perfect opportunity, the one sure way to get rid of Himmler and his cabal of mindless brutes. However, before Bormann could spring his trap, that little snake played his card. Hitler announced his plans for the creation of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, and Bormann's protests amounted to nothing. The Reichsführer of the SS had his own fiefdom, far from Martin's influence. A decade has passed, and the Shadow State remained, uncaring about the changes happening in the Fatherland. This situation was unsustainable, Bormann thought, and he had to gain the upper hand. No more could Himmler be allowed to rule his little realm with no consequences.\n\nThe Führer's entire office reeked of smoke now. He flicked once again through the papers, and there was only one conclusion. The Reich must act against the Shadow State, and Führer Martin Bormann must destroy Himmler.

So many sites of triumph over the Bolsheviks and Jews! The gears in Bormann's head turned, and an old map turned into old memories, filling his mind.\n\nBeginnings of their alliance to conquer the world. A time of squalor and degeneracy then, yet a time of promise. First it was the Italians who joined the Axis, then the Japanese. Different races, of course, but they had a common enemy of the Bolsheviks - at least they knew who the real threat was. While the Reich triumphed over its enemies - oh, how his heart filled with joy when he remembered the subjugation of Europe - the Japanese fought their own enemies, crushing the communists in China, and asserting their own supremacy in the Asian continent.\n\nHis eye returned to the real world for a momentary, painful second, before finding a hole within the Pacific, on the small island of Iwo Jima. Even those Asians could have their triumphs, he supposed. Reports spoke of how the sea filled with blood and iron, a graveyard spanning the waves, and the complete rout of the Americans. It was not long after that that the ultimate weapon of the Reich, the product of the world's greatest minds was detonated in Pearl Harbor, and the war came to a close.\n\nWhen the war ended, the world belonged to the Axis. There were no more Bolsheviks to conquer, and so in triumph came ruin to the Axis. No more unifying enemy, and no more reason to cooperate. The axis lasted about as long as the war, but the Reich endured longer - and it shall forever.

Scoffed at as a political move, the Japanese public's attitude towards the revocation has been lighthearted at best, as very few across the empire genuinely believe the nonsense espoused by the quack scientists making excuses for European barbarism.\n\nMembers of the cabinet spoke to the press in the following days, and the general consensus seems to be careless and total indifference towards the German announcement. Foreign Minister [GetJapForMin] himself commented that "the inconsistent and interchangeable 'racial theories' the German heralds is testament to his fickle temper and naive understanding of the world" - a far cry from Germania's violent rhetoric in recent weeks.\n\nAlthough the news has come in a series of striking diplomatic measures to apply pressure to the Co-Prosperity Sphere, if Führer Bormann's stated purpose in this act is to strike a fear into the hearts of the Japanese, then he has failed abjectly."

Despite Germania's "world capital" status, Tokyo was an equally, if not more populous city, and it was quite as impressive in many regards. He took a few notes - his superiors back home were quick sticklers for the details - and set off for the meeting place with the Japanese ambassador.\n\n"Merkel", said Ambassador Kaneko, "it is an honor to meet you." They shook hands - Merkel was pretty sure that, legally speaking, the Japanese were degenerates now, but it would have been too rude to refuse his hand. "Likewise," Merkel said, quickly cut off by Kaneko's rapid speech. "On the behalf of the Empire of Japan, I would like to apologize for the assassination attempt on your previous Führer, and the great harm it had causes not just to him, but to your nation. We recognize words may not be enough, however we are open to diplomacy, as ever."\n\n"Thank you, Ambassador Kaneko," Merkel said. He was surprised by how easily the ambassador apologized, but he wasn't one to look a gift horse in the mouth. "It is excellent to hear such words. On the behalf of the Führer of the German Nation, it would be my honor to serve as the representative in opening up diplomatic relations between our countries." Kaneko was taken aback - to be honest, a declaration of war seemed more likely than an attempted normalization of relations, given Bormann's recent remarks, but Kaneko had precisely the same opinion on gift horses as Merkel.\n\n"Excellent.

After making his way through the stack, he finally came to something of interest.\n\n"JAPANESE DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION GOING WELL - EMBASSY BEING ESTABLISHED" ran across the top of the paper. Excellent to see that the Japanese trusted him for some reason, Bormann thought. An embassy needs phones, of course, so he would make sure the Reich sent phones. They technically weren't pre-bugged - they were just incredibly, incredibly easy to tap into, so there was no need to have findable bugs on them. Next, he needed to ensure the new transfers - spies very, very thinly veiled as diplomats - were settling in well.\n\n"Mein Führer," Ambassador Merkel said on the phone - one of the Japanese ones, for now - "diplomatic relations are going quite well, and the Japanese seem to trust us. Ambassador Kaneko had held a tea ceremony, and -"\n\n"You had tea with the degenerates? Christ. Anyway, that doesn't matter. Have the new transfers settled in?"\n\n"Yes, they have, but, forgive me mein Führer, they do not seem to have much experience in the way of diplomacy-"\n\n"That's fine, I have full faith they can do their assigned jobs well - and that job is not fucking having tea with vermin.

They saluted, shaking hands with the Japanese Prime Minister, and discussed possible German business ventures across the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nFor the past twenty years, the Sphere has remained closed off to foreign economic interests, particularly that of German and American origin; now, as some begin to predict the cracks to show, the presence of German private investment has become a warmer thought, particularly over matters of employment and resource development in Bengal and Southeast Asia. The representatives had brought with them graphs and documents, each to present the potential economic gain in welcoming German business in the East.\n\nAs the delegation chatted on, grinning with sly smiles and crow's feet, [JAP.GetLeader]'s eyes were locked on to the blazing red armbands wrapped around the representative's sleeves. He clenched his teeth; the dark black void of a swastika revolted him, as he thought about the ravaging chaos of German presence in Eastern Europe and Africa, as millions had been displaced, abused, and outright cleansed from the earth so the Führer could have his way.\n\nSwallowing with a dry throat, [JAP.GetLeader] looked back up at the men suspiciously.

He could use that.\n\nOne hour had passed, and the meeting went on. Hewel's main goal was to reaffirm the Reich's commitments to Iran and its defense, but also to learn about rumors on the Shah's opposition, who seemed braver than ever lately. His ride from the airport to the palace had been insightful. Tehran was indeed more beautiful than ever, but one could see its decay and the unrest among its people. What the minister needed was to hear it straight from the lion's mouth.\n\n"So, while we can expect some aggression from the Iraqis-" the Shah was in the middle of his sentence when Hewel raised his hand in dismissal.\n\n"Your Majesty, forgive me for my bluntness, but you and I both know Iraq is no threat to your nation." Hewel adjusted himself in his seat as the Shah remained stunned and went on. "I'll be more direct. Our intelligence reports indicate your opposition is growing bolder every day that passes.

 bormann.1812.desc:0 "The origins of film's mastering has often lied in propaganda - take the Birth of a Nation in America, a very clearly racist film, yet responsible for many modern film techniques that really have modernized cinema. As such, while many of my countrymen are denouncing Zanjeer as a thinly veiled anti-Japanese propaganda pic, it is a genuinely innovative and enjoyable picture!\n\nMoving away from Bollywood's obsession with romance films, Zanjeer is a dark and gritty crime drama. The lead actor, Amitabh Bachchan, proves himself to be a versatile actor, but he really isn't the star of the show. The film has garnered controversy for its portrayal of its setting, that being Japanese occupied India. Corruption is utterly rampant, and most of the police are useless - Bachchan's colleagues in the police force, mostly Japanese, revel in cruelty and are hopelessly corrupt, making lavish purchases off the bribes they accrue over time.\n\nIt is worth noting that the film's propagandistic tendencies get much more noticeable as the film goes on. When the protagonist is arrested, the prisons are a horrifyingly gritty depiction of life under the Japanese, with barely any food for the prisoners, and an unbelievably brutal prison staff toes the line between a terrifying portrayal of the Japanese horrors and a laughable attempt at being brutal for brutality's sake. Of course, most people don't think of nuances like the portrayal of the Japanese when pointing to the propaganda of this film. After the film ends, credit rolling, in big white letters comes "A REAL PORTRAYAL OF LIFE IN JAPANESE-OCCUPIED INDIA. MAY WE RETURN TO THEM AND REJOICE IN PEACE."\n\nOverall, Zanjeer was an excellent film, and I look forward to seeing the future of this director and these actors - and, like much of India, I look forward to seeing us being reunited with our countrymen who are under the Japanese."

Accusing the Calcutta Government for 'radicalism' and 'treason' for committing itself in a military alliance with Tokyo, many in Delhi and across the subcontinent have been persuaded by the rhetoric that East India must be confronted by means of words or war sooner rather than later. To little surprise, this has raised many eyebrows in Japan as many wonder if violent conflict is brewing on the horizon.\n\nHowever, and rather unsurprisingly, the Reich seems to be encouraging the Delhi Government, beating the drums of war to push Japanese influence out of Bengal. Whilst it is predictable that Japan's primary adversaries are backing a hostile regime, the diplomatic consequences of the heightened confrontations ring alarm bells behind closed doors. This has come in a series of heightened tensions between Germania and Tokyo as Führer Bormann presses for greater influences in the peripheries beyond immediate German military presence.\n\nThe Japanese keep watch over Bengal, awaiting further measures taken by Delhi in the coming weeks and months - anticipating the moment where they may have to draw the line in the sand."

The enemy had access to fortifications, captured military installations, and their weaponry was modern infantry equipment with limited artillery and armor support. It was a perfect depiction of the enemy groups the Reich may face in the area from East India or Indonesia.\n\nASSAULT REPORT: The Kriegsmarine began with a naval air bombardment of enemy positions, targeting critical command structures and airfields. Many projected enemy casualties occurred in this time, far more than usual, as umpires ruled a large number of OPFOR were eliminated via explosions. This was due to the occupying force being caught by surprise thanks to the careful movements of naval group B.\n\nCASUALTY REPORT: Simulated casualties were notable on the attacker end, but far worse for the defenders with the loss of the entire force.\n\nCONCLUSION: This showed it is entirely possible for the Kriegsmarine to overtake an adversary they may find in the Indian Ocean. As for the landing itself, the Kriegsmarine was judged almost TOO careful - keeping the opening barrage longer than it should have been. In a future encounter we must not count on surprise being total, and our forces must be ready to press any advantage we have."

And, of course, in between all of those, this "fourth world", the neutral nations under the control of no global superpower, independent from the blocs locked in this cold war. Here, he would find his allies.\n\nIran was an obvious choice. Their government was already somewhat aligned with the Reich, and it would not be difficult to get them to partner with Germany against the Japanese Empire. There are rumors of internal instability, but those rumors existed in almost every country on the globe. There was not much reason to pay them any mind.\n\nThe next country was another obvious one, India. Though the Indian government tended to lean far more left than the Reich would find appropriate, and there were rumors of their partnership with the Americans in some areas, the modern world was all about realpolitik, and it was impossible to pass down a partnership with a nation that big, and with such a good reason to hate Japan - they were occupying their territory, for god's sake!\n\nFinally, Afghanistan. It was less powerful and less developed than the other two; but that doesn't matter. What matters is that Afghanistan is the Graveyard of Empires, and there is a certain Empire that Bormann would like to dig a grave for.

The man was squat and burly, with a plain round face. This was the Führer? He looked like a butcher who had suffered a mid-life crisis and joined the Boy Scouts. Dudman raised his own arm in response.\n\n"Uh, Heil Dudman?" he responded. Bormann's eyes flickered to his adjutants. Amusement? Anger? A chill ran down his spine. This was no local butcher, he had to remind himself. This was the butcher of Europe. The Führer sat down opposite him, joined by a bespectacled translator. "Thank you for agreeing to this interview, Mr. Bormann. What do you hope to achieve in your upcoming conference in Stockholm?"\n\n"Führer Bormann," Bormann's translator corrected with a false smile. "Well, Mr. Dudman, I wish to improve Germanic-American relations. The time has come for the ice to thaw. The upcoming conference is a gesture of my diplomatic goodwill."\n\n"So, Führer Bormann..." Dudman trailed off. The uniformed Nazis around the room were staring at the journalist with polite smiles and burning eyes. A pang of inspiration hit him. These Nazi bastards could control the interview, but they couldn't control how the American public perceived it. Dudman grinned. "Another hardball for you, Führer Bormann. Do you have a pet?""

 bormann.1902.desc:0 "For the first time in what seems like ages, several representatives of the United States of America and the German Reich have gathered without a firefight breaking out or the threat of nuclear annihilation dangling ever closer to a reality. The conference is meant to serve as a means of détente and warming of relations, though for the men who will be attending, the tension is seemingly more palpable than ever. If the conference goes well, both sides seek to benefit from increased cooperation. A poor result, however, could lead to a rather sharp escalation of the conflicts between the two sides.\n\nMeeting in the capital of neutral Sweden, the President and the Führer exchange brief, meaningless pleasantries in the public eye before continuing into the building that has been set aside for the conference. The United States would speak first, setting the terms for what they deemed necessary for increased cooperation between themselves and the German Reich. The Germans would respond in kind, and as such the conference went well, at first, with the two sides making minor concessions and avoiding most discussion of the South African War.\n\nEventually, however, the United States delegation made a proposal that would require more consideration than the previous ones had: The Americans wanted the Germans to consent to give their President a direct line to the Führer, for quick action in times of crisis. The German delegation quickly began to discuss the matter amongst themselves."

 bormann.1903.t:0 "The Stockholm Conference - Response"
 bormann.1903.desc:0 ""A necessary facet of cooperation is communication."  The American translator announces in slightly accented German, speaking more to the room than to Bormann himself. "If the Reich wishes to work with the United States, they must consent to the installation of a hotline between the Oval Office and Germania. This is a simple measure to create trust between our nations, and allow quick resolution of any incidents that may arise. A method for our leaders to resolve such issues is critical for the expanding of relations."\n\nThe Führer felt less sure of the benefits of such a plan. It was certainly possible that it would lead to resolution of some disputes, but he also knew that it would lead to the Americans making demands of him on a much more frequent basis. It was one thing for the United States to object to the Reich's actions in the form of a speech across the sea. It was another to give them the power to make these criticisms directly to the Führer, at any time they saw fit. It would elevate the Americans almost to the level of equals.\n\nAs the German delegates argued amongst themselves as to the German response, Bormann allowed himself to think on the merits of the proposal. In the end, Bormann made his decision, relaying it to his fellows and instantly stopping all further debate over the subject. The German translator gave the Reich's official response to the American proposal."

With any luck, future incidents involving our two countries will be much more easily resolved, with bloodshed on either end.\n\nWith few remaining items on the agenda, the conference appears to be going better than many of our experts expected. Unless a major wrench is thrown in the works near the conference's end, it seems likely that Germany and the United States will be able to find common ground. If not that, at least the two will not be at each other's throats."

Both sides had nothing to lose by it, and everything to gain. And yet somehow, Bormann has managed to turn the issue into a debate.\n\nDespite our insistence on the importance of the issue, the Germans have refused to commit to a hotline, merely saying that such a thing "could be a possibility in the future, if the situation permits." While this may mean that they will be willing to broach the issue once relations have normalized, it could also mean that they are unwilling to fully commit to détente.

Refusal to meet it, they say, will be seen as refusal to cooperate with America.\n\nWhile many of our delegates believe that to turn back on our prior stance would be a sign of weakness, others argue that it is for the best of Germany to give in to the Americans just this once. It's beginning to look as if talks with the Americans will totally break down if the Führer does not permit this plan to move forward."

The Americans were willing to come to a deal, and the Reich would reap a great deal of benefits from it. Naturally, the Americans had not become friends overnight, but the Führer had no need for friends. He had a need for American missiles to be aimed at Tokyo rather than Germania, and that was what he had gotten. Any more than that was simply a blessing.\n\nThe Führer, a rare smile playing on his face, returned to the delegation, who were gathering their supplies to leave the conference center. "We have won a great victory for the Reich today." He informed them. "Be proud, of yourselves and of your country, for the fine work you have done today." They had not all been particularly helpful, of course, but he was in too fine a mood to complain.\n\nHe glanced around the room, and his eyes met that of the American President for a brief moment. He wondered what Hitler would have made of what had happened here today. Would he have denounced Bormann's actions, condemned the prospect of ever allying with a nation full of jews and capitalists? Would he have permitted the Reich he had forged in blood and iron to work together with a corrupt country built upon liberalism and democracy?\n\nBormann's thoughts were interrupted soon after, however. "My Führer."  It seemed Reichsminister Hewel wanted something of him. "It is thanks to your wit and bold view for the nation that this feat has been accomplished." Hewel glanced back at the diplomats. "In celebration, I suggest that we stay for a round of the finest Swedish vodka before returning to the Reich. My treat."\n\nThe Führer considered the man's proposal for some time. Ultimately, however, he shook his head. "Not today, Walther.""

With this agreement, hopefully, such a thing would never happen again. The Organization of Free Nations was safe from any further attacks, at least from the east. If the Japanese in the west began to mobilize against them, meanwhile, the Emperor would be facing the might of two superpowers, not just one. The Free World may very well have been saved in this very room.\n\nNixon was remembered for de-escalating the Aleutians Crisis, true. But what would the American public think of the commander-in-chief who had stopped the Faroe Islands Crisis before it had even happened? It certainly had been an eventful day, that was for sure.\n\nAs the American Delegation was escorted from the Conference Hall by the Secret Service, however, the President happened to lock eyes with Bormann, sitting amongst his fellow Nazis, who were babbling excitedly in German.\n\nThe weight of what the President had done finally hit. America had, for the first time ever, struck a deal with the krauts. A fascist power, brutal and cold in its repression of all dissent, and the world's beacon of freedom had shown itself willing to compromise with them. Suddenly, what had happened to the boys in South Africa was no longer a reassuring thought.\n\nNonetheless, the President shook themself of dread, placed their doubts aside and stepped through the conference hall doors. Immediately, a gaggle of reporters swarmed the group, flashing cameras and asking questions. A single reporter's voice was heard above the rest, asking the President what had occurred behind those closed doors. The President took a breath, and answered."

After all, if this was how they spoke to him now, at an official meeting of this importance, he could not imagine the ranting that would occur over the little red telephone they seemed so passionate about. It would be an ungodly mess\n\nFinally, the Führer had enough of all the talk about hotlines. He had given his answer, hadn't he? He gestured to get the translator's attention, and asked him to change the subject to that of tariffs. Hopefully, the Americans would get the message that he was unwilling to budge on the matter and drop it.\n\nWhat the Führer did not expect, however, was for the American President to begin shrieking words at him in a rather hostile tone. Bormann waited, and found no answer. Impatient, he glared at the American translator. "Well? What did he say?" The Führer demanded. "Answer me." The translator remained tight-lipped, shaking as the Führer stood. It was some mockery, then. Bormann would not permit mockery.\n\n"This whole conference has been a farce." Bormann declared, clearly filled with some amount of well-contained rage. "The United States is clearly unwilling to work with my government without my total capitulation on every matter! I asked for a détente, but clearly America is unwilling to achieve one. This meeting is over."\n\nThe Führer stormed out of the room, leaving behind a frantic translator attempting to simultaneously relay Bormann's message and Reichsminister Hewel's continued attempts to negotiate around the hotline.

The Aleutians Crisis was cited, as was the need to respond quickly if Japan was to make a move against either of them. If the two countries did not have the means to work together, the alliance would fall apart. The President was sure Bormann had finally been convinced. He almost seemed to be nodding slightly, as if in agreement. When he gave his response to the translator, the President did not hear a single 'nein' in there.\n\nInstead, what the translator said was, "The Führer would now like to discuss the status of the embargoes between our two nations."\n\nIn response to this, the President, consciously or not, expressed a few choice sentiments to the German Führer. The American translator, keen to avoid sparking a nuclear war, chose not to pass those sentiments onto Bormann. Nevertheless, he seemed to have gotten the gist of what the President had said.\n\nBefore anyone could say anything more, the German leader had made several bold declarations about the legitimacy of the conference and the Americans' intentions. All was silent in the room for a few minutes, both delegations too stunned to act.\n\nFinally, Hewel spoke, his voice somewhat weak. "Is it possible we could make the use of such a hotline conditional?" The conference did not continue long after that."

As if the OFN was an alliance of friendship and ideals, instead of a military pact just like any other.\n\nNevertheless, this had to be addressed. If the Americans and the Reich were to work together, Britain could not be allowed to serve as a floating missile silo just outside the Einheitspakt. The Führer was certain the Americans would understand this.\n\nNot wishing to miss a moment of the broadcast, Bormann kept his eyes on the screen as he grasped around for the phone. He felt his hand close around the receiver, and immediately pulled it up to his ear. "I need Hewel to get the fuck in here."

After all, the Reich greatly feared being the party in this exchange left more in the dark.\n\nHank raised an eyebrow. "The United States of America would like to offer in turn recent reports on the state of the Imperial Japanese Navy." He slid his own folder onto the table, carrying the American intelligence. Wordlessly, the two agents swapped the information, each giving the papers a cursory glance before stowing them away.\n\nThis continued for another ten or so minutes, each of the men offering information about the Japanese and the other giving a separate list of details about the Sphere to swap it with. The first few days of these negotiations had been more tense, with more bartering and discourse, but Franz and Hank had quickly realized the actual amount of information being exchanged between their countries would never be changed. As such, they had devised a faster method to do it.\n\nAfter the day's quota of top secret documents had been shared, the two exchanged glances in the silent room. Franz spoke first. "I think that the Brazilians will take the cup again. Their team is simply too good." For the rest of the time that had been set aside for their meeting, the two intelligence agents bickered about their favorite teams."

Naturally, this also meant that the Reich invading the small island and forcing them into the German sphere of influence was also off the table. It seemed that England would be forever doomed as a neutral at a time in which neutrality was less and less sustainable.\n\nWhile of course not ideal, these were things easily agreed to. The safety of the Reich came first, and England was not a prize worth jeopardizing that. The deal was also an early sign of how beneficial Stockholm had been. The Americans and the German Reich would continue their close, friendly collaboration, and the little wrinkle that was England was easily smoothed out.\n\nThis victory serves as a reminder to the doubtful of how truly beneficial Stockholm was to the Reich.

The Reich cannot be permitted to fall behind, or the Aryan race will be beset on all sides by its foemen."\n\nAs the Führer dismissed his ministers, all four men noticed that no new instructions had been issued to Hewel.

The American government had closed off the entire section as a 'gift' for Bormann, claiming that they wanted the German people to see how Americans lived.\n\nBormann was no fool. This entire expedition was an attempt to mock the Führer, to provide amusing footage for the American Minderwertige to guffaw over. Unbeknownst to the State Department, Bormann knew how to fight fire with fire. The American audiences would receive their propaganda... while the German people would suffer an insight into America's degeneracy. He had entered the lion's den, not to let the beast consume him, but to stand before it as a superior being.\n\n"Would you like fries with that?" asked Goofy. Bormann's translator whispered into his ear.\n\n"I just want the burger," Bormann snapped. The translator relayed the reply, and the large anthropomorphic dog handed over a small greasy meal. Bormann snatched it and wolfed it down. He threw the wrapper into a nearby trashcan and turned to the cameras. "Gentlemen, you can start filming now." The translator shouted the order in English.\n\nBormann crossed his arms and stared defiantly at the indulgent display of capitalism that surrounded him. Gerhard Klopfer joined him, hands on hips, grinding his jaw in anger. Walther Hewel quickly passed his cotton candy to Mickey Mouse and strode in front of the cameras, shaking his head in disgust."

The incompetent Jew in the White House, it seemed, was a true member of his despicable race. He considered for a moment that he could blame the whole idea on Hewel, but decided against it. Even the most silver of tongues could not convince a weed to befriend the weedkiller. If Bormann were to truly free Germany from Jewish influence, it had been a foolish idea to collaborate with a nation so ripe with hatred for Aryans and Western civilization.\n\nAt the very least, Bormann considered it a propaganda win. He could show his fellow nations that he had tried to be the reasonable one, to reach out with a hand of friendship: something the United States had slapped away. Surely, one could not now think of the Germans as the aggressor in this Cold War. Besides, it would give the German people strength to know how infested with liberalism the United States was.

Michael Goldwater had been a strange man indeed.\n\nPresident Goldwater thumbed, for the third time or so, through the papers that the German delegation had forwarded to him. 'The German Reich, in light of the threat of the Japanese Menace, wishes to establish a firm and mutual détente with the United States of America. This would be to the benefit of both of our strong nations, and would serve to bring about a new German and American golden age.' Goldwater stopped reading there. He had the rest of the letter memorized already.\n\nGrandpa Mike had always been quiet about why he had left Russia. Barry had asked him, time and time again. The answer had often changed, frankly, but Barry remembered one of his answers most of all. "Well, Barry." His Grandfather began, leaning over to talk to the boy. "There were men in Russia, bad men, who did not want other men to be treated as their fellows, and instead as property. Some very good men tried to change that, and when they failed, I had to leave."\n\nPresident Goldwater wiped away the tears beginning to well in his eyes. It was not so unlikely that his Grandfather would have stayed, and that poor young Barry would have perished in Hitler's camps among so many others.

The speeches of his comrades are often guttural and punchy, but the new Party Minister has always delivered his messages with a poetic flair. A keen patron of the arts and an avid author, the half-American von Schirach believes it is the duty of the Reich to protect European culture from those who would subvert it - be they Jews, Bolsheviks... or political rivals.\n\nJoining the Party as a strapping young lad of eighteen, von Schirach rose through the ranks to become the Leader of the Hitler Youth and the man responsible for shaping the minds and bodies of the next Aryan generation. Though he fell out of favor with Hitler during the War, he maintained his sphere of influence as the Gauleiter of Vienna and the Reichsleiter for Youth Education. Having aligned himself with Martin Bormann and the powerful Conservative faction of the NSDAP - a political maneuver his detractors have dismissed as mere opportunism - von Schirach now finds himself as the second-most powerful man in the Reich.§!"

 GER_BOR_redevelop_the_nation_desc:0 "As we creep towards the next era of Aryan ingenuity, we are set against the realities of our situation. The German Civil War damaged our infrastructure and economy far more than the Second Weltkrieg. More shamefully, economic stagnation and Speerist mismanagement left us in a poor place even before Hitler's death. No longer. With Martin Bormann at the helm, the regeneration of the German nation can truly begin. Slash away the inefficiency! Build the factories! Ready the Workers! So much yet remains to be done."
 GER_BOR_mass_propaganda:0 "Mass Propaganda"
 GER_BOR_mass_propaganda_desc:0 "The Office of the Führer has decided to address flagging faith in the National Socialist system not by addressing the root causes of the public's suffering but by pasting over them with an enormous propaganda campaign. The Führer's name appears on posters and signs on the street. His image hangs in offices and classrooms. Televisions, movies, and even commercials reinforce the idea that Martin Bormann is an infallible, "heroic genius" leading Germany toward greatness. Only by burying the complaints in such messages can the Reich regain its footing."
 GER_BOR_the_peoples_fuhrer:0 "The People's Führer"
 GER_BOR_the_peoples_fuhrer_desc:0 "Propaganda made Adolf Hitler the embodiment of a German national revival, a creature more of myth than flesh and blood. Through an extensive propaganda campaign, Martin Bormann hopes to become the same: a savior of the German people. He has mobilized every apparatus of the government toward building a cult around himself, toward becoming "the People's Führer."\n\nYet, the results of this campaign are a little... lackluster. Perhaps it is the incompetence of the men and women given the task, the shocks of the last two decades, or the unavoidable peculiarities of Bormann's personality, but the Führer's preening has prompted more eye rolls than salutes and more snickering than rapturous applause."

 #Foreign diplo
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_category:0 "Reclaiming the Pakt"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_category_desc:0 "With the Bügerkrieg finally fading away, Bormann's view is returning to the Einheitspakt and the Reichskommissariats - or what is left of them. Either way, once the word to begin is given, we will be able to assess and plan our response to what has been going on around us."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Bohemia:0 "Past the Sudeten"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Bohemia_desc:0 "Historically the first major foreign conquest of the Großgermanisches Reich, the region past the Sudeten was reformed into the Reichsgaus of Bohemia and Moravia. Given the region's status as primarily 'Germanized', at least according to pre-Bürgerkrieg documents, its reintegration into the Reich after the Bürgerkrieg will surely be a quick & simple affair."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Netherlands:0 "Our Eyes in the North West"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Netherlands_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Niederlande has been under a state of Germanization under Arthur Seyss-Inquart for the last two decades. With the Reichskommissar's passing, the political situation has changed drastically. We must decide how to deal with our Dutch brethren."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Denmark:0 "The Northern Tip of Jutland"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Denmark_desc:0 "To the north of Germany rests the protectorate of Denmark, sleepy and content. With its generously bestowed - albeit limited - political autonomy, this nation has remained sensible and stable even in times of crisis, never straying away from its obligation of loyalty to the Reich. The Danish are a Germanic people, a fact evident if one were to visit its snowy lands and survey the men and women with their golden hair and azure eyes. The full integration of Denmark into the Reich, though inevitable, is likely years away... but when these efforts are fulfilled, it shall be a joyful day for all Aryan kind."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Crimea:0 "The Lion of Crimea"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Crimea_desc:0 "At the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg Großadmiral Dönitz, a genuine National Socialist and enthusiastic supporter of Führer Bormann, took the Kriegsmarine to Crimea so that it may be safeguarded from the monstrous claws of the Großgermanisches Reich's most loathsome traitors. With the Bürgerkrieg now over, we must give Dönitz a deserving hero's welcome back to the Fatherland."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ostland:0 "The Model Colony"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Ostland_desc:0 "Once the 'Model Colony' of the Großgermanisches Reich, the traitors of the Ostfront shattered the Reichskommissariat at the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg. Yet, with that dreadful conflict over, the Reich must once more assert itself over its rightful Lebensraum. Whomever now governs the region will either dutifully swear allegiance to the Führer or find themselves utterly annihilated, Ostland is rightfully the Reich's!"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Slovakia:0 "The Issue of Slovakia"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Slovakia_desc:0 "Having annexed the territory of Böhmen und Mähren, the Reich turns its monolithic gaze to the territory of Slovakia. Surrounded, with no friendly nations to back them up, and being simple to return back into the fold of the Pakt, we will issue them a concise ultimatum. They will either join, or we will smash open their pitiful army and march straight into Bratislava."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Poland:0 "Tensions in the Weichsel"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Poland_desc:0 "The Generalgouvernement, once thought to be a genuine success with regard to the process of Germanization, fell into chaos soon after the commencement of the Bürgerkrieg... a quite embarrassing example of our incomprehensible bureaucracy. The reformation of Poland poses a considerable threat to the Großgermanisches Reich, we cannot allow for their existence as an independent state to continue..."
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Norway:0 "Fjords of the North"
 GER_Bormann_Foreign_Policy_Norway_desc:0 "The Danes & Norwegians (a perfect example of pure Germanic Aryanism) broke free of Germania's control at the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg.

Accordingly, we will transfer slaves from pens to ghettoes and "free" them from slavery in the process, transitioning from slavery to racial separation. But we will of course make sure to put them to use for the Fatherland: they will be deployed to wherever they are needed for our esteemed Führer's infrastructure projects, being moved into work camps which will in time grow into more permanent settlements. Needless to say, we will make the deployments of the troops in a manner that meets our needs first and foremost. It matters not whether we end up deploying Poles in Moskowien or Ukrainians in Estonia. Ethnic and social conflicts are of no relevance to us, so long as the projects get done."

The madness of Heydrich, the decadence of Speer nor the unrefined methods of Göring are not the futures that Germany needs nor deserves. Only Martin Bormann truly represents the values of National Socialism that have brought the Reich to greatness in the first place. We shall show this truth to the people, to Europe and to the world. When Bormann's loyalists have crushed all traitors to the Reich will the security of our people be secured. We will once again create a society that WILL stand the test of time, and it will live for a thousand years forevermore."

With the parts of the propaganda ministry still under control, posters with Bormann's portrait shall line the streets, radio spots and TV shows will praise him daily and all throughout society.

The old Aristocracy's influence may have faded, but it is still there and so is their old money, their holdings and their titles. Bormann has the means and the influence to draw upon these connections. A few dinners here, some clandestine meetings there. Promises, bribes, threats if necessary and the leaders of old will help ahead the Führer of new."
 BOR_keep_your_friends_close:0 "Keep Your Friends Close..."
 BOR_keep_your_friends_close_desc:0 "The support network that has been built by Bormann over the years is vast. And that is proving itself a handy tool during the days of Civil War. Yet that size also brings with it some problems: Among the number of our supporters are also those found wavering, lazy incompetent or even worse: hidden traitors. Loyalty and trust are good and well, but we shall keep an eye on our various "friends", just in case. And an eye on the watchmen too. The Führer's orders are clear, to take no chances."
 BOR_and_their_friends_closer:0 "...And Their Friends Closer"
 BOR_and_their_friends_closer_desc:0 "One would think that among four warring contenders and the so called guardians of Germania, every person of noticeable influence in the Reich has already picked sides. However this isn't so even among the area controlled by our forces. Bormann of course can't just ignore these potential resources at best and potential traitors at worst. Through his manifold personal connections he will begin to pull some strings and bring these individuals to his side... With some precautions of course."
 BOR_the_faith_of_our_leaders:0 "The Faith of Our Leaders"
 BOR_the_faith_of_our_leaders_desc:0 "From the old aristocrats and Junkers with their grand old estates, to the generals and officers of the Second Weltkrieg as well as the old fighters from before our rise to power, they all have one thing in common: their Faith in Bormann is strong and this Faith will be the foundation upon which Germany will be made great again. By mobilizing their support whenever necessary, we can get the edge in the civil war we need. We will reward their faith once this is situation is all won and done."
 BOR_friends_in_the_banks:0 "Friends in the Banks"
 BOR_friends_in_the_banks_desc:0 "From Deutsche Bank to Commerzbank and from Dresdner Bank to the Reichsbank itself, Bormann's influence reaches far and wide. Just as Aryan entrepreneurs lent a hand to the late Hitler's rise decades ago, so will they help in letting Bormann claim his rightful position. But even beyond voluntary donations, we can use a few tricks to secure loans with favourable conditions. By promising privatizations, lucrative rebuilding deals and tax cuts after the end of the civil war we should get even more help for our cause."
 BOR_we_have_the_money:0 "We Have The Money"
 BOR_we_have_the_money_desc:0 "It seems like all the groundwork Bormann laid before the civil war, building connections with bankers, functionaries and aristocrats alike is finally paying off. A steady stream of donations and subsidies is securing our war effort, at least for the time being. We should use that advantage while we still can and buy up as much weaponry as we can."
 BOR_the_reichstags_champion:0 "The Reichstag's Champion"
 BOR_the_reichstags_champion_desc:0 "While some may say that the deputies of the Reichstag have scattered all over the various factions of the civil war, the largest plurality supports Bormann. A declaration by these men in favour of the legitimate successor will undoubtedly cement Bormann's reputation as the Reichstag's Champion. And who knows, we might even be able to convince a few wavering or undecided deputies from all over the Reich to join us for our cause."
 BOR_rally_the_bureaucrats:0 "Rally the Bureaucrats"
 BOR_rally_the_bureaucrats_desc:0 "It's not enough that simply the high level managers, administrators and leaders rally to our cause. The secretaries, low-level staff and workers are just as important. War is after all in many ways an administrative problem. By rallying the masses of the Reich's administration to our cause, we gain a valuable and experienced body of labour that might just give Führer Bormann the edge he needs to succeed over the traitors."
 BOR_fight_for_your_money:0 "Fight For Your Money"
 BOR_fight_for_your_money_desc:0 "Unfortunately, a Soldier can not fight from faith in the Führer and the Fatherland alone. Mundane things such as food, rest & recovery or even access to fulfill other base desires cost money and even the staunchest Landser gets second thoughts when his pay is miniscule. With our deep financial reserves it is time for a general pay rise for all our forces across the front. With that surely morale will rise and desertion rates will go down. And maybe it will even convince some of the more flimsy supporters among our rivals to switch over to our cause."
 BOR_we_need_the_men:0 "We Need the Men"
 BOR_we_need_the_men_desc:0 "With the civil war still ongoing, our manpower is not what it used to be. Understrength units are starting to struggle to control the frontlines. We need more men, even if we have to compromise on the quality. From those unfit to serve, to deserters and even a few undesirables, those men who have so far fallen through the cracks of our recruitment and shirked their responsibility will be convinced to join our cause for good. Führer Bormann needs every man to do his duty after all."
 BOR_ALL_the_men:0 "ALL the Men"
 BOR_ALL_the_men_desc:0 "We need more men. We need them all and we need them now, but that is only possible by increasing the draft length and lowering the training requirements. Doing that is not going to be popular, but victory cannot be achieved without sacrifice. And with the situation across the Reich rapidly starting to go downhill and the civil war still ongoing, a lot of sacrifice still awaits the German people."
 BOR_we_need_the_cash:0 "We Need the Cash"
 BOR_we_need_the_cash_desc:0 "With no end to this blasted civil war in sight one truth is becoming evident: Most men cannot fight on faith in the Reich alone. Guns, Food and ammunitions require wealth, even now. Bormann's contacts all across Society can get us much of the cash, but to sustain a steady flow we should squeeze and pressure the Banks, confiscate property that belonged to traitorous individuals and loot those possessions we come into during the fighting."
 BOR_ALL_the_cash:0 "ALL the Cash"
 BOR_ALL_the_cash_desc:0 "The situation is deteriorating. Now even our formerly so deep pockets are increasingly scraping the barrel to fund the war effort. We have no choice but to go even further beyond in our schemes. That means loans from the banks at cutthroat conditions, requisitioning even from loyalist families and pressing even those of our supporters who can't give much for a Reichsmark or two. And if that isn't enough we will have to start to scavenge and sell raw materials and salvage. Let's hope it is enough."
 BOR_we_need_the_calm:0 "We Need the Calm"
 BOR_we_need_the_calm_desc:0 "Some of our people are getting rather nervous. The civil war is dragging on and on. Will it really end soon? Of course it will! This is Führer Bormann after all. And he will bring law and order back to the German lands. For that he needs calm, discipline and duty. The calm is what keeps us above the anarchy of the students or the madness of the SS. So all of you, keep calm and fight for Bormann, just a while longer. Please."
 BOR_ALL_the_calm:0 "ALL the Calm"
 BOR_ALL_the_calm_desc:0 "The situation across the Reich is, well, not ideal anymore. The length of the civil war is increasingly leaving permanent scars upon both the landscape and the people. Some weak minded fools have even started to whisper, that maybe Bormann isn't the man capable of bringing law and order back to the Reich. They will be proven wrong of course, but with things as they are maybe we need to take some action to make SURE they are convinced."

 ##Bormann Opening Tree
 BOR_der_wilde_ritt:0 "Der Wilde Ritt"
 BOR_der_wilde_ritt_desc:0 "The Bürgerkrieg has been won, and Führer Martin Bormann has come out victorious. For the moment our enemies have been crushed. However, Bormann's struggle to control the Großgermanisches Reich is far from over, for the Fatherland lies in ruin and if we do not act fast to rectify our poor situation it may embolden our enemies. To prevent any challenge to our rule, we must begin to mold Germany to Bormann's desires."
 BOR_first_things_first:0 "First Things First"
 BOR_first_things_first_desc:0 "That being said, before we restore our glory, the Großgermanisches Reich must first reclaim the basics of living from the fires and horrors of the Bürgerkrieg. Now, what are these 'basics' we must reclaim? Well, Führer Bormann supposes that - rather evidently - food for the citizenry and the reconstruction of our once glorious infrastructure are precisely those 'basics'. Therefore, we will ensure that the people are fed and the roads paved!"
 BOR_slaves_to_farmers:0 "Slaves to Farmers"
 BOR_slaves_to_farmers_desc:0 "Regrettably the Führer cannot snap his fingers and cause a nation-wide banquet to materialize - while the Führer wields absolute power over our state, he is no god. There is a serious shortage of food that could result in the commencement of a famine and cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands if we do not act. However, we need not worry, as Führer Bormann has an ingenious plan to solve the impending crisis! We will simply put the slaves to work in Germany's agricultural industry en masse, so that we may produce the food required to feed the nation."
 BOR_soldiers_to_builders:0 "Soldiers to Builders"
 BOR_soldiers_to_builders_desc:0 "Sadly our Fatherland's once world renowned infrastructure lies in ruin, our cowardly enemies having deliberately destroyed the Großgermanisches Reich through their own greed and lust for power. Of course, one cannot be a Superpower if one's nation is a depressing smoking hole in the ground. Therefore, to restore the Großgermanisches Reich's most crucial infrastructure, soldiers with engineering experience are to be put to work, for they will help reconstruct our shattered Fatherland."
 BOR_notstandsrecht:0 "Notstandsrecht"
 BOR_notstandsrecht_desc:0 "In 1933, Führer Adolf Hitler passed the Ermächtigungsgesetz under the guise of a state of emergency. In a similar vein to his predecessor, Martin Bormann shall once again institute a Notstandsrecht in order to reaffirm his supreme role over the Großgermanisches Reich as its Führer. Once enacted, Bormann will have the ability to pass laws and dictate Germany's fate without the interference of anybody else."
 BOR_urban_reconstruction:0 "Urban Reconstruction"
 BOR_urban_reconstruction_desc:0 "The cities of the Großgermanisches Reich have suffered tremendous amounts of destruction and pain as a direct result of heavy house to house fighting during the Bürgerkrieg. Führer Bormann shall not allow for the Reich's population to live in miserable squalor anymore! We must enact a policy of rapid urban reconstruction. The Reich shall bloom with prosperity and happiness once more as we rebuild and revitalize our once beautiful cities."
 BOR_the_elephant_in_the_room:0 "The Elephant in the Room"
 BOR_the_elephant_in_the_room_desc:0 "That being said, there is an elephant in the room, one problem that we have yet to and must tackle immediately if our new Reich is to bloom like the old. The problem being, where do we store all the slaves? Of course, the original slave camps have unfortunately been largely destroyed in the flames of the Bürgerkrieg. Yet, we cannot allow these inferior undesirables to walk among us as free men! We must come to a quick decision on the matter or risk the Reich itself."
 BOR_from_old_make_new:0 "From Old Make New"
 BOR_from_old_make_new_desc:0 "The sheer destructive force of the Bürgerkrieg has left ruins littered throughout the Reich, shattered monuments to our violence. A weak man would mourn such loss, and watch silently on as the ghosts of our architectural triumphs haunt the cities forevermore.\n\nThe Führer is not such a man. In an act of genius, he has ordered these ruins to be recycled and utilized in the Great Reconstruction. From the broken, we shall rebuild. From the small, we shall make grand. From the old, we shall make new."
 BOR_academic_investment:0 "Academic Investment"
 BOR_academic_investment_desc:0 "The rise of the Reich dragged German academia from the depravity of liberalism to the glorious truth of National Socialism, and now the horrors of the Bürgerkrieg have torn it down once more. Glory can only be sustained by the next generation of academics and scholars, and so we must invest heavily in the Reich's academic institutions."
 BOR_honor_the_war:0 "Honor the War"
 BOR_honor_the_war_desc:0 "Despite the destruction that it brought, the Bürgerkrieg must never slip from our collective consciousness. We will pump state finances into the building of monuments and statues dedicated to the Führer's triumph, so that those loyal National Socialist comrades who sacrificed their lives for the German Reich may be immortalized forever in marble and stone."
 BOR_industrial_revitalization:0 "Industrial Revitalization"
 BOR_industrial_revitalization_desc:0 "The Großgermanisches Reich's industry suffered greatly during the Bürgerkrieg, with heavy fighting having damaged or destroyed significant portions of our industry. Rebuilding everything will take a considerable amount of time to accomplish, but to begin with we must at least help one of Germany's three industrial centers - Rheinische, Central, or Süddeutsche industries - which will not only assist in our return to economic normalcy, but is bound to earn the Führer favors he can use later down the line..."
 BOR_rheinische_kohle:0 "Rheinische Kohle"
 BOR_rheinische_kohle_desc:0 "In his wisdom, Führer Bormann has chosen to support the Rhenic industry. Notably reformist in its beliefs, the majority of Rhenic industries sided with Albert Speer's faction during the Bürgerkrieg. Yet, this does not and will not dissuade Führer Bormann! Speer's reformist clique are no longer an issue, and why would a bunch of boring workers revolt without the traitors working in their midst? Furthermore, it will serve the Reich well if we support their industry, known especially for their vast coal production."
 BOR_ruhrkohle_consolidation:0 "Ruhrkohle Consolidation"
 BOR_ruhrkohle_consolidation_desc:0 "Our efforts at restoration have proven successful. As a result of our timely intervention, the Rhenic coal industry has grown into a large, economically powerful and strong German industry!... So, it's time to consolidate our influence over it, as we don't want such profitable corporate entities to slip from our greasy paws, now do we? To do as such, Führer Bormann has sponsored the creation of 'Ruhrkohle AG', a new conglomerate corporation that shall administer the Großgermanisches Reich's coal production."
 BOR_markischer_stahl:0 "Märkischer Stahl"
 BOR_markischer_stahl_desc:0 "In his wisdom, Führer Bormann has chosen to support the central German industries. Notably militaristic in its beliefs, the majority of the central German industries sided with Hermann Göring during the Bürgerkrieg. Just as the New Aryan Man is undaunted at every turn, this does not and will not dissuade Führer Bormann! The Reichsmarschall is gone and his clique corralled, making them irrelevant as an issue. Furthermore, it will serve the Reich well if we support their industry, known especially for its steel production."
 BOR_all_unto_reichswerke:0 "All Unto Reichswerke"
 BOR_all_unto_reichswerke_desc:0 "The Reichswerke Hermann Göring had been a tool used with the direct purpose of assimilating state control over Germany's steel industries since before the commencement of the Second World War. Yet, with Göring's treachery and fall during the Bürgerkrieg, the Reichswerke lies dormant. However, they haven't lost their purpose yet and may still be useful to our cause. Dropping the treacherous Reichsmarschall's name, the new 'Reichswerke' shall absorb and administer the Großgermanisches Reich's new steel mills."
 BOR_bayrische_technik:0 "Bayrische Technik"
 BOR_bayrische_technik_desc:0 "In his wisdom, Führer Bormann has chosen to support the South German industry. Notably conservative in its beliefs, the vast majority of these South German industries sided with Martin Bormann during the Bürgerkrieg. With there being little political threat from these industries, there is nothing to dissuade our investment. Furthermore, these specific industries are known for their technological innovation, which may benefit the Reich in the long run."
 BOR_siemenswelt:0 "Siemenswelt"
 BOR_siemenswelt_desc:0 "Siemens AG, one of the Großgermanisches Reich's foremost technological giants, has now grown to the point with which it dominates the Reich's technology markets with ease. This is, of course, a direct result of Führer Bormann's meddling in the German economy and industry, which is good for us as their dominance will likely secure the Reich's lead in technology for decades to come."
 BOR_let_the_money_flow:0 "Let the Money Flow"
 BOR_let_the_money_flow_desc:0 "With the Großgermanisches Reich's industry now starting to get back on its feet, it's evident to the Reich's most experienced and well-versed economists that the state shall now begin to earn significant profit once more. With this in mind, all Führer Bormann has to say is: "let the money flow", covering the nation in the printed green of the Reichsmark."
 BOR_military_redeployment:0 "Military Redeployment"
 BOR_military_redeployment_desc:0 "The Führer's total victory in the Bürgerkrieg heralds great change for the German people, but he cannot keep the flame of National Socialism alight without obedience to his new regime. The Reich is not yet fully pacified, and dissent still runs rampant through major cities and small towns alike. Student militias continue to train in their basements while radical militarists scheme in abandoned warehouses, and acts of terrorism are being committed every single day. We must redeploy the military and fully pacify our splintered nation."
 BOR_reintegration_efforts:0 "Reintegration Efforts"
 BOR_reintegration_efforts_desc:0 "The chasms between the different factions of the Wehrmacht must be sealed if we are to unify the Reich and rebuild its military. Those who sided with Speidel in Germania, those who joined forces with Göring, those who fought for Speer - all will be reintegrated into the Wehrmacht. A unified military force is essential to our survival, and while such efforts will inevitably see varying degrees of success, it is a price we are willing to pay."
 BOR_were_all_german:0 "We're All German"
 BOR_were_all_german_desc:0 "Despite the Reich's fractured political scene, and the horrors that unfolded during the Bürgerkrieg as brother slayed brother, we cannot ignore the German blood that courses through our veins. Everyone who fought in the civil war are members of the Aryan race, bonded by blood and soil, and as such should be respected. After all, is it not German nature to take action through violence and conquest? To heal the nation we will promote unity, not division."
 BOR_smoke_them_out:0 "Smoke Them Out"
 BOR_smoke_them_out_desc:0 "Is any trait more befitting of weak men than forgiveness? To oppose the rightful Führer Martin Bormann was to oppose the Reich itself, which many of our enemies sought to accomplish by rallying behind perverse denominations of National Socialism. Those in the Wehrmacht who betrayed their own blood in favor of degeneracy deserve to be punished however the Führer sees fit."
 BOR_some_are_more_german_than_others:0 "Some Are More German than Others"
 BOR_some_are_more_german_than_others_desc:0 "We all share German blood, but the manifestation of one's Aryan nature arises differently depending on the strength of this blood. Those who fought for Bormann and therefore National Socialism proved their absolute purity, while those who opposed him displayed a suspiciously subhuman mindset. Traitors should not, therefore, be considered wholly German."
 BOR_frieden_im_reich:0 "Frieden im Reich"
 BOR_frieden_im_reich_desc:0 "The deployment of our great military, and our actions taken towards its disloyal elements, have proven to be successful. Now that it has outlived its temporary role as a provisional police force, the Wehrmacht will once more serve as the army of the Reich, stronger than ever before. With the revival of our army comes the revival of the Reich itself and our reputation across the entire world."
 BOR_the_ride_goes_on:0 "The Ride Goes On"
 BOR_the_ride_goes_on_desc:0 "Through revitalization, reconstruction and redeployment, Bormann has made significant progress in forcefully shoving the fractures of the Reich together into a unified whole, and strengthening his grasp on power in the process. The ride, however, is far from over.\n\nThe Führer is setting his sights on one of the most crucial issues plaguing the nation: The influence of Speidel and Schörner on the future direction of the Wehrmacht's political alignment."
 BOR_realpolitik:0 "Realpolitik"
 BOR_realpolitik_desc:0 "While the Großgermanisches Reich survived the initial post-Bürgerkrieg woes by the skin of its teeth, our transition out of critical danger must not kill our desire to reconstruct the Fatherland. Indeed, Führer Bormann has spoken at length to the NSDAP elite about his desired intent to move toward consolidation regarding the conservative/reformist political debate. The time for balancing between two stools is over, and quite frankly it was a silly move to begin with. Therefore, we must formally decide which faction we shall support and which pieces of legislation our government shall enact."
 BOR_when_in_germania:0 "When in Germania..."
 BOR_when_in_germania_desc:0 "Martin Bormann is a political genius. The Führer's intuitive embrace of Machiavellian political and moral philosophy has allowed him to become the greatest political mind of his generation (at least, that is what the newspapers we produce say). Indeed, being the political luminary he is, Bormann has set his sights on tackling the current most dangerous conflict in Germany. For the Großgermanisches Reich to achieve Superpower status once more, the Wehrmacht's ideological divide must be solved and the opposing faction made to quieten down and actually follow our orders for a change.\n\nWe face a choice: Speidel's reformism or Schörner's militarism, both with significant levels of support in the senior Wehrmacht. To solve this, we shall arrange a meeting and decide once and for all, based on the immortal Führerprinzip - what the Führer decides shall be carried out, and that will be the end of the matter. As they say: 'When in Germania, do as the Führer do'."
 BOR_meeting_in_the_reichskanzlei:0 "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei"
 BOR_meeting_in_the_reichskanzlei_desc:0 "To settle the issue of political stability in the Reich with our eyes on mere grandstanding would be a deeply foolish measure. Too many lies hide behind these meaningless displays, too little can be ascertained from the shows of force and plays at relevance. To truly ascertain the value and truth of a man you need only pit him in a battle for his very existence. The Reformists and Militarists, Speidel and Schörner- devils each, but which will prove most capable, which will prove most valuable to the Führer? Let us receive them both at the Reichskanzlei and through this forum see for ourselves which shall come out on top."
 BOR_retter_des_reichs:0 "Retter des Reichs"
 BOR_retter_des_reichs_desc:0 "Hans Speidel's performance during his meeting with Bormann have cemented him as the obvious choice for Chief of the OKW, and his intelligent arguments prove that the future of the Wehrmacht is in safe hands. With the Führer's blessing, Speidel may begin his reformations without restraint."
 BOR_review_the_wehrmacht:0 "Review the Wehrmacht"
 BOR_review_the_wehrmacht_desc:0 "To initiate his thorough reformation of the Reich's military forces, Hans Speidel has ordered an official review of the Wehrmacht, from its funding and organization to its chain of command and political leanings. Once he has obtained a completed picture, the Feldmarschall will push on with his radical changes."
 BOR_deutschland_uber_alles:0 "Deutschland über Alles"
 BOR_deutschland_uber_alles_desc:0 "Speidel's command of the OKW is not driven by a lust for personal glory and the consolidation of power, but a desire to strengthen the Wehrmacht as a powerful apolitical force within the Reich. Such a force, he claims, will ensure the preservation of the nation and the safety of its people. Deutschland über Alles!"
 BOR_ungeheuer_in_uniform:0 "Ungeheuer in Uniform"
 BOR_ungeheuer_in_uniform_desc:0 "With his radical proclamations for change enrapturing the Führer, Ferdinand Schörner has officially been appointed as Chief of the OKW, and orchestrator of the Wehrmacht's future. The Monster in Uniform, Bloody Ferdinand - all these names denote the Feldmarschall's brutal nature, but brutality may just be the key to revitalizing our army."
 BOR_little_black_book:0 "Little Black Book"
 BOR_little_black_book_desc:0 "In his mission to restore the Wehrmacht to its former glory and beyond, Schörner has forged an extensive list of his rivals in the armed forces. This 'Little Black Book' reveals the personal, political and military histories of these named officers, as well as the manner in which they should be dealt with. According to Schörner, some should be fired immediately, while others are to be forced into a more... permanent retirement."
 BOR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer:0 "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer"
 BOR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Feldmarschall Schörner is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve, and has been swift to stress how his ambitions openly align with that of the Führer and the Reich. Some may question his sudden change in attitude towards Bormann following his appointment as Chief of the OKW, and it is true that Schörner enjoys his newfound power... but he has risen the Wehrmacht to glory... A glorious Wehrmacht means a grateful people, a powerful nation, and a beloved leader!"
 BOR_waffenstillstand:0 "Waffenstillstand"
 BOR_waffenstillstand_desc:0 "The achieved consensus with regard to the Wehrmacht's alignment has seemingly secured the Großgermanisches Reich a stable future. With the public pleased and the government united, there is nothing standing between the Reich and the glories of the future. Führer Bormann's achievement of consensus has seemingly reinforced his political omnipotence over the state, and many accuse the Führer of acting in self-interest rather than with the selflessness due a man of his position. Quite frankly, these people are character assassins and do not understand that the interests of the state are the interests of the Führer. For their insolence we shall sweep them aside, and as we dismiss them from the halls of power we shall brand them with the name of their childish generation: 'Very well, Soixante-Quatards.'"
 BOR_a_thousand_year_reich_forevermore:0 "A Thousand Year Reich, Forevermore"
 BOR_a_thousand_year_reich_forevermore_desc:0 "We have succeeded in surviving the aftermath of the Bürgerkrieg, the Großgermanisches Reich has achieved relative political stability for the first time in decades. As a result, a powerful wave of optimism has swept across the Reich, the German people, hopeful of a good future, believe this is the commencement of a new glorious era for National-Socialism, a new golden age under Führer Martin Bormann is perhaps on the horizon. Yet, only time will tell. But given recent events, it's safe to assume the Thousand Year Reich will remain forevermore."

 BOR_the_reichs_war_down_in_africa_desc:0 "The rightful successor has finally triumphed and reunited Germany proper under his rule, but the Reich's wars are far from over. In darkest Afrika, our Reichskommissariats fight a brave war in protection of the Boers of [BOR.GetNameDef]. The Boers have long proved a civilising element to the barbarians of the Dark Continent, and their fight against the American-aligned [SAF.GetNameDef] must be supported to maintain the influence of the German Reich outside Europe.\n\nThe people of the Reich are battle-hardened but weary, for fighting fellow Aryans is not good for the soul. It will be good to give them a just war to reinvigorate them - to prove that Germany is not yet through."

 BOR_assess_the_situation:0 "Assess the Situation"
 BOR_assess_the_situation_desc:0 "It is not for nothing that Afrika is called the Dark Continent. Its vast lands have long remained undeveloped, and little information escapes our colonies outside official channels. The Bürgerkrieg severed these channels of communication, with our agents in the continent experiencing confusion at the simple task of to whom to send their reports. With the command structure effectively decapitated, our Reichskommissarriats banded together into the Afrika-Schild. The Schild's war against South Africa has further complicated issues, so it is vital we gain accurate reports of the situation on the ground and re-establish communications."

 BOR_huttig_has_to_suffice:0 "Hüttig Has to Suffice"
 BOR_huttig_has_to_suffice_desc:0 "Hans Hüttig, Reichskommissar of Ostafrika, is a deeply unpleasant man. The former concentration camp commander has taken those lessons to heart, and Ostafrika is ruled like a country sized version of Buchenwald. His cruelty is known from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, his racially pure SS troops enforce a strict caste system over their African subjects - and that hair. Still, he is an effective tool against the South Africans and must be aided - even if he does keep insisting his Reichskommissar peers are traitors."

 BOR_schwarze_adler_desc:0 "The deserts of Südwestafrika aren't good for much other than droving cattle. They spread out for miles, no settlement in sight and scarcely any civilisation at all, barring the German settlements around Windhuk and on the coast of Walfischbucht. The one thing it is truly suited for is reaching the air.\n\nThe Air Fleet envisioned and developed by Reichskommissar Schenck is the beating heart of Südwestafrika, carrying goods where no road goes, maintaining communications across vast swathes of barren veldt and deep jungle, and delivering justice to any unruly natives who get the wrong ideas. Maintaining the support of this fleet will be vital if we are to make progress in Afrika."

 BOR_honorary_boers_honorary_aryans:0 "Honorary Boers, Honorary Aryans"
 BOR_honorary_boers_honorary_aryans_desc:0 "The Boers are long removed from their Dutch ancestors after two centuries of British rule, but they have maintained their Aryan blood nonetheless. They found their Lebensraum on the veldt just as we did in the east, and have done an admirable job spreading Aryan hegemony on their Great Trek. The German people should be reminded of this - the Boers will be officially confirmed as an Aryan race."

 BOR_help_the_hunter:0 "Help the Hunter"
 BOR_help_the_hunter_desc:0 "Although a significant distance from the frontlines, Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller's enthusiasm for hunting & warrior-like behaviors may prove useful to our campaign... yet, his penchant for warfare isn't particularly important, no, it is Zentralafrika's strategic location & natural resources that give Müller his true value. Thereby, it's best we choose not to disfavor the Reichskommissariat in favour of its continental contemporaries."

 BOR_alle_waffen_gegen_suedafrika:0 "Alle Waffen Gegen Südafrika"
 BOR_alle_waffen_gegen_suedafrika_desc:0 "Like a bloody, clinging vine, the South African War continues to hamper our efforts on the Dark Continent. It is critical that this conflict be brought to a swift and decisive conclusion: South African victory (which looks more certain by the day) will deny our forces access to strategic resources from the Congo Basin and the airfields of the southwest. It will also be a propaganda coup for the American jackals, which is arguably worse and certainly more damaging to the national pride. South Africa must be brought to heel by any means necessary!"

It falls to the Führer Bormann to make the unthinkable choice: to sever all existing agreements between our side and theirs, including those on treatment on prisoners of war (or, as the General Staff calls them, dead weight).

Indeed, unlike our Reich, South Africa doesn't have the industry nor population to sustain a continuous assault hammering at their front.

Operation Weserübung, while not the most successful of our campaigns that year, was still an unquestioned success, as the decadent Allies were quickly forced out, and the resources of Norway became ours. Not only that, but the Nordic people of Norway became the first of the Scandinavians to be incorporated into our Reich. Finally, the fjords and harbors of Norway gave the Reich the opportunity to gain naval superiority over the North Sea, a benefit which would become all too useful in the invasion of Britain. With all of these advantages, it was no wonder that the decision was made to remain in Norway when the war ended. Norway has remained one of our most important Reichskommissariats, watching over the north and protecting the Fatherland.\n\nAs of late, however, our grip over Norway has collapsed completely. Terboven, seeing the impossibility of his situation, left Norway with his men to fight in the Bürgerkrieg- an honorable decision, but one that destroyed our authority in the region. Such a choice leaves our north open to western imperialism, as even now the Americans circle the waters of the North Sea, looking for an opportunity to expand their hold.\n\nLuckily, the Reich has once again found its footing under Führer Bormann, and we find ourselves with the opportunity to recover the fortress we have lost. Though this is unlikely to be an easy feat, nothing is too hard for the Reich. Soon, Norwegen will be ours again."

Much of Norway, as infuriating as it is, is against the return of the Reichskommissariat, making our deal harder. However, when the first ambassadors sailed across the Danish Straits, they landed to something decidedly unexpected- a band, Jonas Lie himself, and swastikas waving in the wind next to their Norwegian counterparts. Things only got better from there.\n\nAs it turned out, when Terboven left Norway, the NS- a collaborationist party that controlled much of Norwegian politics- immediately devolved into multiple cliques of politicians, each fighting for control. After a hard-fought struggle, Lie and his brand of radicals seized power and took the government. Incredibly enough, Lie is more in favor of Germany than the moderates of the NS ever were. We did not even need to ask about a Norwegian re-entry to the Pakt- they suggested it themselves!\n\nOf course, such a positive development is being spread heavily among official papers back home. Already, crowds read fluff stories about the Norwegian's loyalty and belief in the Aryan dream- a loyalty and belief so great that they remained true to the Fatherland, even in our moment of greatest weakness. Such a tale has gone over quite well in the Reich, and it seems that Norway's re-entry to the Pakt is only a matter of paperwork now. Who knew it would be this easy?"

In fact, it's becoming an opinion of many in the government that the Norwegians were more loyal to National Socialism than much of Germany itself.\n\nOf course, such blind faith in our system deserves some reward for their effort. It has become a topic of some discussion in Bormann's inner circle that Lie and his clique deserve, at the very least, a commendation of their bravery and loyalty.

They would then replace them with farmland and other agricultural products. These policies, while giving Germany proper a boost in industrial output, severely weakened the already unstable economy of the Reichskommissariat. The reasoning behind this, as Hitler stated back in the day, was to limit what the Norwegians could do in case they ever had ideas of rebellion.\n\nOf course, Lie's victory has entirely disproven this fear, and now the need for a policy that kneecaps our most loyal subject seems entirely useless.

As much as we'd like to prevent this, of course, German assets are limited in these times. We only have a small amount of forces that we can spare to help keep order- not nearly enough to maintain our rule across the Baltic.\n\nOnce again, however, the ingenuity of Lie and his followers comes through as an easy solution. Lie and his government have bent the party's paramilitary- the Hirden- to their will, and they now serve as a loyal force, united behind the radicals. By reinforcing these men with both guns and advisors, we can bolster our presence across the waves without diverting a full division or two. It's another genius solution to what could have been a fatal problem- indeed, some in Germania now wonder why we didn't have Lie running the RK earlier, with how loyal he has proven to be."

Traditional holidays were replaced with German ones, celebrations of Germanic culture became commonplace, and the Lebensborn project was thrown into full force. Slowly but surely, the old traditions of Norway were replaced by the true, Germanic celebrations of Aryan supremacy.\n\nUnfortunately, Terboven's departure brought an abrupt end to these changes. Unbelievably, statues were torn down, swastikas ripped to shreds, and the traditions of the wayward Norwegian culture reared its head once more. While this disobedience undoubtedly deserves punishment, it has been decided that we shall simply restore those policies that have been lost. Once again, our loyal men in Oslo have proven to be a lifesaver- while they could not stop the reversal entirely, they certainly managed to contain the damage.

While this may not be our best case scenario, it is certainly not the worst that could have happened- we have worked with Lunde before, and our goals line up in most areas.

However, Lunde crossed a line by asking for more autonomy from the Fatherland. To accept such a request, so soon after we saw the near calamity that almost engulfed Norway only months ago, is something we could not accept.\n\nOf course, not many in Norwegen agree with this decision.

They seem heavily displeased with the actions we have taken to drag them, kicking and screaming, into a modern-day Aryan paradise. Perhaps they just don't understand.

However, in the wake of Terboven's exit, the Moderates have pulled a native defense force out of the people, which has been keeping things in check for the last months. After much debate, Bormann has directed that the Norwegians may keep their army, as well as allowing the average Norwegian to arm themselves in defense. After all, the NS clearly has control over the North, and the transfer to natives running the army allows us to consolidate resources that would otherwise need to be stretched all over the countryside. Besides, Norwegians are Nordic people, genetically close to the Aryan race. Why should we be running them as closely as we do with the Slavs and Africans? The solution is clear."

How many of these citizens would buy weapons to "defend themselves", only to turn around and sell them to Milorg or other decadent groups?\n\nOn the topic of native defense, it is yet another idea we cannot allow. Borten has proven to be a sometimes unwilling candidate, and he has caused trouble for us numerous times. Can such a man truly be trusted with his own army? It is of the opinion of Germania that a close eye must be kept on him, lest he try to break away from us in full. Were the Norwegians not wary of re-entering the Pakt?

Besides the obvious economic improvements, allowing Norway some extra autonomy is bound to sweeten their opinion of us further, as we slowly shift the perspective of Germany in Norway from that of a conquering empire to that of a Aryan brother and protector, leading all of Europe into a glorious future.

Such policy flies directly in the face of National Socialist doctrine at best and is downright treasonous at worst, but the kicker is the motive we suspect to be behind this action- Borten pretends that this is only for the good of Norway, but it's clear that this motion is meant to distance Norway from us economically, allowing them to slip away while we aren't looking!\n\nIf Borten truly believes that he can slide such treachery past us without us noticing, he'll be proven wrong. We shall twist Borten's attempt to break from us to our own ends, using his own desire to see his reforms through to tie Norway even closer to Germania.

How can they actually convince the Norwegians, already high on the opiate of Western decadency, that partnership with the Germans is better? Worst of all, does Bormann truly even want this to succeed? The Führer is not well known for his love of capitalist nations, and his rather lackluster support of the conference seems to indicate a rather shaky interest in a peaceful solution.

Forces on high alert have been stood down, pilots that had been readied for deployment now suddenly see the fuel take from their planes, and the Kriegsmarine's crews are dismissed from their ships after days of waiting. Most interestingly, numerous special agents have suddenly been recalled, their unknown mission suddenly cancelled. All of this demobilization seems to have deflated the militarists, who were similar to the Führer in their full expectation of a glorious new campaign for the Heer.\n\nThough the success of these talks may have been unexpected, both nations can cheer for a new era of relations between the Aryans of Germany and the Nordic people of Scandinavia, now ready to move forward in an era of unity."

A new era of European cooperation seems to be dawning, and the partnership between Germany and Norway seems to be the first step on the path to a unified, proud Europe.\n\nOf course, the differences between the two are still massive. Norway's western, democratic outlook sharply clashes with the National Socialist doctrine that pervades through the Reich. Their capitalistic, free-market approach to economics drives a similar wedge in between the two nations. Some among the higher echelons of the Reich's political machine question why we ever negotiated with a rebellious subject. Bormann has his reasons, of course. Publically, it's because the Aryan is an inherently diplomatic race- one that can compromise and treat with anyone. Privately, it's because the cost of invasion would be much higher than necessary.

Reasonable discussion turned into shouting, shouting turned to insults, and insults led to the Norwegian delegation leaving the conference with no treaty.\n\nOf course, this was entirely expected in the Reich. Plans drawn up in the case of a negotiation breakdown are already finding themselves activated, as soldiers mobilize across the Reich for what could be the first major naval invasion the Reich has done since Sea Lion.

One of these nations was Reichskommissariat Norwegen, which shook as the ground that held the administration high fell to pieces. Before the nation could collapse into a seething bed of violence and chaos, Reichskommissar Terboven pulled his garrison out of the nation, sending them home to Germany to fight for whoever they wished to. In the process, he trusted that the civilian government- led by the NS- could hold the fort until Germany's return.\n\nThey miserably failed.\n\nNorway today is under the thumb of rebels, who themselves bend to the beck and call of American capitalists and an uncaring monarch. The advancements that we struggled to place have been torn out in months, and Norway is once again a hive of Judeo-Bolshevism and degeneracy. Such a dagger pressed to our heart cannot be allowed, and the debate among the OKH is not whether to invade or not, but whether to attempt a coup first or simply attack. Whatever the conclusion, one thing is clear- Norway as it currently stands cannot be allowed to exist."

Already, contacts are being made with those in Norway who have remained loyal to the Aryan dream. With a bit of support, a few guns here and there, and perhaps a few advisors to lead the way, we can have a real force at our disposal.\n\nThe plan is simple- Pro-German forces will march on Oslo in the early hours of the morning, laying siege to the city if resistance is met. They will be aided by German supplies, weaponry, intelligence, and naval fire support if needed. Soon, Norway will be pulled away from its course of destruction and back into the light of National Socialist doctrine, and we will do away with Milorg once and for all."

With luck, by tomorrow the swastika will fly high over the city again, and one of the greatest errors of our Reich will be fixed.\n\nMuch hinges on the Norwegians to fulfill their end of the bargain- something that they have proven to be incapable of doing before. Hopefully, they shall pull the weight that any Aryan should this time, instead of falling apart in days as they did in 1963.

Traditional holidays were replaced with German ones, celebrations of Germanic culture became commonplace, and the Lebensborn project was thrown into full force. Slowly but surely, the old traditions of Norway were replaced by the true, Germanic celebrations of Aryan supremacy.\n\nUnfortunately, Terboven's departure brought an abrupt end to these changes. Unbelievably, statues were torn down, swastikas ripped to shreds, and the traditions of the wayward Norwegian culture reared its head once more.

Instead, it will be the German man working in the factories and in the fields - and it is the Führer's will that slavery will no longer serve as Germany's modus operandi."

After their treachery was revealed in the fifties, they were granted a mercy they did not deserve and allowed their own little fief in the West, but what did they do with it? They promptly began exploiting the ailing condition of the Führer to totally extricate themselves from state control and gradually cut off all communications and trade with the Heimat.

Now that we have endeavored to deepen our ties with them, we can exploit the fact that Himmler recently shattered and broke the back of the majority of the French State, humiliating them far deeper than even the Reich did in the forties. Hungry for revenge and eager to reclaim their people, we can easily pull them into a defensive pact against the Burgundians in return for promising them most of their lands back.

However, despite their innumerable shortcomings in almost every aspect, we share two things with the Americans: A desire not to let nuclear war ravage the planet, and a hatred for the racially inferior Empire of Japan.\n\nIt is because of these common causes that our wise Führer has decided to lessen the divide between the Reich and America. Foolish men may see this as a sign of weakness, but we know it instead as proof of National Socialism's inherent superiority. The Americans, seeing the strength that we hold, will take their place below us of their own volition. They only need a few little pushes in order to do so."

Before the Americans will accept any sort of deal with our nation, we need to show them that the Führer is not the inhumane murderer they have been brainwashed into believing he is.\n\nWe have arranged an interview between the Führer and an American journalist. We have, of course, set a few limits for what can and cannot be asked in this interview. This is not a means of deception, however, but a means of making sure that the American people get a true and thorough view of the Führer's character."

Where are the "freedom fighters" in Eastern Europe who did not fight with American weaponry and vehicles? Did the Arch-Traitor Speer not take his silver coins from the American departments?\n\nOne thing results from those facts: America is a dishonest political entity which speaks in lies and trickery and it is only fair that we act in retaliation against their perfidious machinations.

Of course, we can't just give up our sovereignty and influence for every piece in Europe that is regarded as "occupied" or "disputed" by the American observers, but we can make small steps to show that we are as committed to world peace as they are. To show our interest in a mutually beneficial relationship, we can recognize Iceland as an independent state and revoke the Danish territorial dispute over the country.

Surely, it was Führer Adolf Hitler who brought them victory at Pearl Harbor, but the Japanese atrocities in the Pacific were solely on their hands.\n\nIf there is something certain about the American society, it is that they loathe the Japanese more than us. We can manipulate their sentiments to get their public opinion of them on our side. Lamenting their national loss, we can remind them that they are not alone in their grief and that we, the Germans, know as no one else what it means to lose our national pride that was taken from us during after the Treaty of Versailles.

As tensions with Tokyo over dominance of the Old World heighten, it is incumbent upon the Führer to find a new ally-of-the-day for the Reich.\n\nAs luck would have it, our old foes are in a fantastic position to provide such a role. The Americans hate the Japanese even more than they hate us, and the two have already nearly come to blows with the Aleutians Crisis.

In lieu of an incumbent government willing to 'play ball' with Germania, as the Americans say, supporting the one man that we know surely would be friendly to the Reich seems a rational second option.

From the commencement of war in the 30's and to the present day, partisans across the Reich's European colonies have consistently had their acts of terrorism against the German order funded and equipped by American dollars and American weapons.

The German plane had circled around the landing strip for over an hour at the instruction of their Spanish hosts, the latter determined to wait for some clouds to pass by. With each loop, Helmut Schäfer felt excitement for his deployment fade. By the time he and his fellow soldiers found themselves wobbling down a flight of steps in front of a sweat-stained, cheering crowd, his mood had soured completely. If there was any consolation, it was that, behind their broad smiles and sweet words, many of the people forced to assemble there felt the same.\n\n"So..." said Helmut, standing by a Falangist soldier after Iberia's self-proclaimed ruler had delivered a dull speech and left. "This is all that your country has to offer."\n\nThere was a pause. Then, in surprisingly good German, the soldiers looked back at him. "We have about as much as the Reich before it had cleaned up its degenerates, I suppose." He grinned. "Maybe some better beaches."\n\nHelmut took a step back. He hadn't expected the other men to understand him, had only meant to vent his frustrations. "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know... I didn't think..."\n\nThe other soldier waved his hand. "It's fine. You Germans are always surprised to find that they teach German in schools here. One of Franco's better ideas, back before he got old and soft."\n\nThey stood there for a long time in silence, watching as soldiers pushed an exhausted crowd into buses. It wouldn't be long before trucks took them away too, spiriting the Germans off to some military encampment and the Falangists off to the frontlines. Helmut, realizing their time was ending, cleared his throat. "Just between us, do you think you stand a chance? Against Franco and the liberals, I mean."\n\n"I'd like to think we're a strong people, that we'll come out of this fight victorious and join together with the Reich. Maybe, after this is over, you can show me some nice German cities. I've always wanted to visit Vienna."\n\nThe Germans were getting ready to leave now.

The man greeting him looked furious for a moment before concealing his emotion and trailing behind him like a lost puppy.\n\n"Let me be the first to say," Jaime said, trying to catch up without dropping his sharp smile, "how grateful we are that the Reich has come to aid us in our fight against liberalism and degeneracy. All of my men... all of them... look to your government as a beacon in the darkness. Your beloved Führer is-."\n\n"An inspiration, I'm sure," said Adam in a deadpan. Now several feet away from the helicopter, he took a moment to look around at the military outpost and his host. Everywhere, there were signs of dilapidation. It was in the cracks that spiderwebbed across the base and the haphazardly created helipad. It was in the old uniform the so-called leader of Iberia wore and the desperate smile on his face. Repairing them, making the Falangists a stable and functional ally, would require an untold number of Reichsmarks.\n\nThe man across from him ignored the remark and kept up his same, forced grin.

In reality, they had simply found it like that, presumably abandoned after whatever renegade military unit that operated it had run out of fuel.\n\nEither way, this, out of dozens of photos of the battlefield, was to be his sole contribution for the evening. He had been expecting this, but Felix had hoped that maybe somehow the scrutinizing eye of the censors would pass over his images of the bullet-riddled Church his unit had repelled a leftist assault in, or a one-in-a-million shot of Federal Mortars landing a mere dozen yards away from his position. He seemed to be incapable of doing anything except setting himself up for disappointment.\n\nThere was no time to waste though. Muttering his apologies and gratitude to the attaché, Felix backed out of the tent, glancing down at his camera. He had a quota to fill, and not much time left for it. He made his way across the austere military camp to the squad he had been assigned to. Maybe, if he could get them mustered for a moment, he could take some basic pose-\n\nThe familiar wail of sirens filled the base. An air raid was inbound.\n\nThe first few times Felix had heard it, he clutched his ears. By now, he merely winced, whispering curses underneath his breath as he took a trained, practically involuntary step back. And then he turned towards the bunker.

"Stay. Stay where I place you. Do not move until I say 'Action.'"\n\nA Spanish boy, he couldn't be older than fourteen, turned around and gaped at her. Without hesitation, she grabbed the back of his neck and jerked him to the ground. She bet Riefenstahl didn't have to deal with such unsuitable subjects. She wasn't forced to adhere to a strict budget or work with the local help. No. She got to manage a big film studio near the capital.\n\n"You are supposed to be fighting a horde of communists and democrats," she screamed, pointing off down a cordoned street. She'd managed to use her connections to get the German military to close off a busy section of street and erect some barricades. It looked like a real battlefield. "Try to look like real Aryans in front of the camera or I guarantee no one in Germany will care about you and your pathetic, little war."\n\nNo one moved as Gerda marched back to her camera. She would make the perfect propaganda film, she thought. She would overcome her loser's attitude and make these grovelling imbeciles into icons.
