 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_REICHSKOMMISSAR_JOSIAS_DESC:0 "Josias, Erbprinz zu Waldeck und Pyrmont was raised in power and nobility, but was powerless to stop his family's noble titles and privileges from being stripped away when the German Republic was proclaimed. He joined the Nazi Party in the late 1920s, quickly falling in with the SS and steadily climbing its ranks. Josias soon developed a reputation for being meticulous and fiercely devoted to the letter of the law, even prosecuting Buchenwald camp commandant Karl-Otto Koch for embezzlement of funds. By the time the West Russian War came to a close, Josias had a comfortable job as the SS High Police Commissioner in Wartheland, and he largely remained above suspicion regarding Himmler's failed SS coup. In order to keep his reputation airtight while serving as Himmler's eyes and ears in the Reich's eastern peripheries, the two engineered a falling-out that culminated in Josias publicly denouncing the SS and tearing up his membership card.\n\nWhen it came to light that Reichskommissariat Kaukasien was overrun with partisans and needed a new Reichskommissar, it was easy for Josias to sway the Führer with his excellent work record and sterling reputation. But less than a week after arriving in Tiflis, Josias was captured by a branch of the Transcaucasian Soviet partisan group and gruesomely tortured for three days. He remembered every bit of pain he suffered, as well as every face that watched. After he was finally rescued, he put his plan for "pacification" into place. Highways and cities were fortified, natives were forcibly relocated, and uncooperative regions were indiscriminately firebombed. Josias also began filling the bureaucracy and garrison with loyal SS members, and quietly rejoined the organization (though he considers it an insult his original membership number wasn't restored). He still sends his resource quotas to Germania so they don't complain, but there are those who still believe that he really takes his orders from Nanzig."
 
 POLITICS_KAISER_JOSIAS_DESC:0 "Josias, Erbprinz zu Waldeck und Pyrmont, found himself utterly alone. He had cut off his ties with the SS after feeling slighted by Himmler, he had refused to aid any of the so-called Führers at each others' throats in the Reich, he had alienated the industrialists for frequently trying to exact greater and greater taxes upon their mines and refineries, and the damnable natives would never accept a foreigner ruling over their lands. There was only one thing Josias had left to turn to: his noble heritage.\n\nThe idea was dismissed as madness, both by his family and his closest advisors. An absolute monarch in the twentieth century? What an absurd fantasy! But to Josias, it seemed that there were few other options. Monarchs could rule multi-ethnic states with more ease than military dictators, let alone National Socialists. After all, had the Habsburgs not managed to hold together a cosmopolitan Empire in the heart of Europe for five hundred years? And thus, he ordered it to be done. A crown was crafted, a date was set, a cathedral was chosen, a bishop was found, and a large swathe of the bureaucracy and military who spoke out against it were quietly purged from the government.\n\nNow, the Reichskommissar's official title is His Majesty Josias I, King of Kaukasia, Protector of Kuban, and Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. He wears elaborate uniforms, holds court at his palace in Katharinastadt, and hears the petitions of regional governors who must bow before his throne. Although some call it madness, there is method to it: he has taken his duties as a monarch just as seriously as he did as a Nazi, and he seems to have little intent of relaxing oppression against the natives."
 
 POLITICS_PAUL_PLEIGER_DESC:0 "Although Reichskommissariat Kaukasien may have been created as a way to test limited autonomy for collaborating minorities, its continued existence has always been to serve one purpose: to wring every drop of oil and pry every ounce of precious metals from the earth. To ensure this end, the upper echelons of the Reichskommissariat's bureaucracy was filled with mining magnates, oil barons, and other industrialists who would have a very personal interest in maximizing operations. The undisputed leader of this corporate clique is Paul Pleiger, who previously ran prestigious industrial operations like the Reichswerke Hermann Göring.\n\nWhile Pleiger and his ilk have been content to take a backseat while the Reichskommissars kept the natives in line, Josias's recent... eccentricities have convinced him that actions must be taken to keep the Reichskommissariat's primary mission active. Now that cooler heads have prevailed, Pleiger hopes that he and his fellow industrialists are able to keep things steady, keep the oil flowing back to the Vaterland, and keep their many investments profitable for the rest of their lives. Pleiger also has decades of experience in expropriating property from liberated territories, and many in both Katharinastadt and Germania are confident that he can deal with this pesky native problem that not even Josias's heavy-handedness could crush. All he needs is a few years of stability and steady funding, he insists, and everything will settle into a happy status quo that will benefit everyone (and their portfolios)."

 ### Ideas ###
 CAU_bergbaureich:0 "Das Bergbaureich"
 CAU_bergbaureich_desc:0 "Kaukasien is renowned not for its land, but for what lies beneath it. The earth offers up endless rivers of oil and tons upon tons of metals and minerals, and the German occupiers partake deeply and greedily in the bounty."
 CAU_shipments_to_ger:0 "Shipments to the Reich"
 CAU_shipments_to_ger_desc:0 "While Ukraine may be the breadbasket of the Reich, Kaukasien is its gas tank. Its oil industry solely exists to serve the Reich's needs and operates on orders from Germania, so it is only natural that everything it pumps from the earth is sent to the Reich to use as they please."
 CAU_stratified:0 "A Stratified Society"
 CAU_stratified_desc:0 "A hierarchy of sorts has arisen in the Reichskommissariat. At the bottom are the "three loathsome pests," Georgians, Armenians, and Circassians, all loathed by the Germans for their continued rebelliousness. Above them are the other ethnic minorities, only slightly less disdained. Then come the German skilled laborers and their families, and on top sit the bureaucracy and army, thoroughly dominated by Josias's men."
 CAU_german_investments:0 "German Investments"
 CAU_german_investments_desc:0 "The Oil must flow, as it is coloquially said, and Kaukasien has plenty of it. Once neglected by Josias's cold front towards the Reich, the Barons are more than willing to take in the Fatherland's specialist to improve productivity to heights never seen before!"

#EVENTS
 cau.788.t:0 "A Lost Legion?"
 cau.788.desc:0 "A surprisingly disappointed looking expedition leader for the Kaukasian's in Turkey (investigating their laughably called 'Aryan Super City') has announced that the find was, in fact, not evidence of ancient Aryans colonizing Europe. Instead they have announced after the finding of multiple ancient Roman artifacts that they may have found the location of the infamous lost Roman Legion, the Legio IX - Hispania.\n\nWhile this has sparked much interest from the international community, especially as the Kaukasian's then proved their findings with footage of them unearthing several ancient shields, bits of armor, weapons, and several skeletons. The Kaukasians however have been humiliated in the eyes of the international community, and the expedition has gotten far less boisterous in their proclamations of their finds. It seems whatever comes of this expedition from here on out will be far less exciting for them, and word has already come that an angered Josias will possibly be scrapping the dig."
 cau.788.a:0 "They find something interesting, and this is the reaction!?"
 
 cau.789.t:0 "An Ancient Calling"
 cau.789.desc:0 "Obergruppenführer Baader, the leader of our now failing Turkish expedition, has sent some strange news. He reports that the archeologists and their guards have reported strange nightmares and dreams, and several have come down with what seems like some form of radiation sickness. They have already procured radiation suits, but their Geiger counters have yet to actually find any sort of radiation poisoning the dig. Instead, they report something much stranger.\n\nBaader claims that while doing regular radio checks, they discovered a strange noise coming over one of the unused frequencies. With further investigation, they found that there is some sort of... signal, or a force, as Baader calls it, coming from somewhere in the site. Baader has already moved forward on investigating this without prompting, but *has* asked for permission to try and create a form of antenna for this strange force. He believes, that with the proper funding and of course, our support, he could potentially focus this energy into one spot.\n\nThe expedition has begun to get out of hand, but who knows what revelation we can make?"
 cau.789.a:0 "He has our blessing, surely the results shall be interesting."
 cau.789.b:0 "Shut down the expedition, this has been enough of a waste."
 
 cau.790.t:0 "Interlopers"
 cau.790.desc:0 "The Kaukasian dig had been nothing if not controversial, and had gained a permanent garrison of protesters, news commentators, and local police watching the ever-growing amount of soldiers and scientists the Kaukasians have sent to investigate their finds. The most peculiar finding had been what seemed to be a sort of radio antenna that had slowly been erected in the center of the sight, bringing many questions that the international community had been unable to answer.\n\nAnd now it's all gone.\n\nFootage showed the Kaukasians gathering around the antenna, one man flicking a switch. At first, nothing of peculiarity happened, most of the Kaukasians even seemed to be growing bored.\n\nThen, it was like there had been a thunder clap. The sky darkened, the sun seemed to set despite it being the middle of the afternoon, and the entire expedition seemed to disappear.\n\nOver the crater a glowing, swirling vortex of energy sat, and from it spewed... Romans. As if they were the legions of old, hundreds of soldiers came out of this vortex, armed with what appeared to be, of all things, machine guns, rifles, tanks and other armaments. Gunshots were soon heard as these strange visitors opened fire on the remaining members of the expedition, and then at those civilians who had not already begun to ran.\n\nReports are saying that the Turkish military has already begun to engage, and that they are losing."
 cau.790.a:0 "W-what?"
