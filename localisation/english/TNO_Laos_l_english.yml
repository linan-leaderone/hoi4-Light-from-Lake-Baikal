 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_KOU_ABHAY_DESC: "Following the end of legendary Prince Phetsarath Rattanavongsa's reign as Prime Minister, the controversial Phoumi Nosavan spent all of his political and what little goodwill he had to install Kou Abhay as Prime Minister. A noble-born general whose collaboration with the Thai during Issara was so minor as to be uncontroversial, Nosavan thought him the best compromise between his desire to elevate the RLA and the liberals who wished to continue Phetsarath's legacy.\n\nDespite this, Abhay scraped by with a weak majority, serving only as a caretaker who did not upset or cheer up any faction. From the end of Phetsarath's term in 1959 to the agreed-upon election year of 1962, Abhay has served as an ineffective, inoffensive head of state. Now, with elections looming, Abhay prepares for a long-awaited retirement from political life.\n\nOf Kou Abhay himself, there is little to say. He is the son of a southern noble family, and the father of prominent general Kouprasith Abhay. He is an old man on death's door who has done no more than sign papers and oversee parades. He is a doorway through which Laos enters the next phase of its political history."
 POLITICS_SOUVANNA_PHOUMA_DESC: "Perhaps it was always Souvanna Phouma's destiny to lead the Laotian people. Brother of the late and legendary Prince Phetsarath Rattanavongsa, politically connected across all of Laotian society, a diligent servant to the Coalition Government of Free Laos during Operation Issara - this prince has inherited his brother's proud legacy of service to Laos.\n\nYet Souvanna Phouma presents as an unimpressive man with peculiar ideological beliefs. At times he is stubborn; at other times he folds quickly. He cooperates with the left, but capitulates to the right. He plays with nationalist rhetoric, yet enjoys the full support of the Japanese. He is aware of the political games which occur in the shadows, yet he lacks any kind of guile or cunning to benefit from it.\n\nPhouma is by no means incompetent, but he is perhaps too dull to truly live up to his brother's legacy. Nevertheless, he is in power on the strength of that legacy, charged with continuing that legacy, and he will lead the Laotian nation to the best of his ability. But Phouma knows that daggers dance behind him, waiting for the first sign of weakness to plunge deep into his back."
 POLITICS_SOUPHANOUVONG_1_DESC: "Brother to Prince Phetsarath Rattanavongsa, father of the modern Laotian nation, Souphanouvong returned from higher education in France with ideas ill-fitting for royalty. He developed in the metropole a distaste for the imperialism that benefitted clients such as his noble line. Upon his return to Laos, Operation Issara saw him follow his brother to Xam Neua, where Souphanouvong was notable within the CGFL for his outreach efforts to resistance movements. He developed a particularly strong rapport with the peasantry, which combined with his left-wing sympathies for him to become known as the Red Prince.\n\nNow Souphanouvong leads Laos, with the people's assent rather than divine right. As its Prime Minister, he has vowed to fight for the peasantry in the fields and the workers in the cities. He calls for expansions to welfare, infrastructure and industrial development - and to support the nation in these endeavours, Souphanouvong is particularly keen on deepening ties with Japan, seeing the Sphere as Laos' greatest chance to develop the nation's industry. The right call him a Bolshevik ICP plant, the left's enthusiasm is tempered by his pan-Asian rhetoric - but no matter the critics, Souphanouvong knows in his heart that he is a patriot, doing what he can for the Laotian nation."
 POLITICS_SOUPHANOUVONG_2_DESC: "Some would say that a leftist noble is a contradiction, that it is irrational for royal blood to seek an end to monarchy and the establishment of a communist state. Souphanouvong gladly holds the knife, slits the monarchy's throat and uses its blood to water the people's farms and the nation's gardens.\n\nKnown for his left-wing sympathies, few knew how deep the Red Prince's sympathies truly ran. Since '49, Souphanouvong has been a secret ally of the Indochinese Communist Party, silently funding and outfitting them with connections in the CGFL. His time in Paris opened his eyes to communism, and foreign occupation of Laos motivated him to put theory into practice. Yet he knew Laos was not ready for a revolution; it was undeveloped, surrounded by reactionaries. So he bided his time and led the NLHX through the post-Issara troubles.\n\nWith an ally in Vietnam, the 20th century's greatest Trojan horse opens up. Souphanouvong has declared to the world what he has always held in his heart: that he believes in Marx, Lenin, and Bukharin, and will fight to see their vision realised for Laos. Nobody is more shocked than Japan, victim to a years-long con by Souphanouvong, who played pan-Asian sentiment to receive favours, investments and loans he'll never pay back. They might be furious, but Souphanouvong is ecstatic: Laos is free, and by the sweat of its workers it shall remain free."
 POLITICS_PHOUI_SANANIKONE_DESC: "Phoui Sananikone has spent the last ten years trying to pick up the pieces of the reputation his brother smashed on the ground. Oudone led the collaborators alongside Phoumi Nosavan during Operation Issara, at a time when Phoui hid in the Laotian bureaucracy, and for this crime the Sananikone dynasty was tarnished by betrayal. But now that Phoui has become Prime Minister, perhaps he and his family have truly been redeemed. Perhaps Phoui's just good at making himself look good enough for Laos to accept him.\n\nBorn into this northern noble dynasty once known as the Rockefellers of Laos, Phoui's fated life of prominence was thrown into question with his brother's collaboration with the Thai during Issara. Still, he used his family name to secure a high position in the bureaucracy, remaining safely apart of what he thought was a quagmire. On the CGFL's success, Phoui quietly returned to political life as a voice of moral traditionists, the moderate aristocrats and monarchists who did not brazenly collaborate with the Thai.\n\nNow he is Prime Minister, elected on a wave of appeals to careful governance from the land-owning classes and veiled anti-Japanese sentiment from the peasantry. He speaks of building a stronger, moral Laos, but everyone knows of his deep corruption. With his extensive ties in the elite and the military, Phoui Sananikone is not shy about using them for his own gain."
 POLITICS_BOUM_OUM_NA_CHAMPASSAK_DESC: "Ask any Laotian their thoughts on Operation Issara, and they'll give you a variation on this answer: a time of chaos and bloodshed, but necessary for us to be free. There is only one man who breaks from this conventional wisdom, a man for whom Operation Issara was the only time he was truly free, a man who was king when that title meant something. That man is Boun Oum Na Champassak.\n\nBy the terms of the Pakxe Agreement, signed by himself and Phoumi Nosavan, Boun Oum was once King of Champassak, in what is now the southern half of a nation he never wanted. Nosavan's betrayal and the victory of the CGFL destroyed that kingdom and its throne, and despite his valiant attempts to stay in power, Sisavang became king of Laos, with that decadent liberal Phetsarath putting it on a path away from rightful royal governance. Boun Oum was shoved to the side, a voice around which only the most hardline of royalists could rally around.\n\nA series of errors from his opposition has given Boun Oum the opportunity to claw for a consolation prize. Through exploitation of the post-referendum chaos, he is now Prime Minister, with the politically inexperienced Vong Savang above him to use where required. In truth, he would much prefer Vong Savang's title, and for that title to mean something - but Boun Oum still has power, and he will use it to preserve and support the royalist in Laotian politics."
 POLITICS_SOMSANITH_VONGKOTRATTANA_DESC: "Has Prince Somsanith Vongkotrattana ever been his own man? Certainly not in his political career. In Operation Issara, he was responsible for the Laotian secret police, a position forced upon him by the traitor Nosavan before he was mercifully replaced from this unwanted command by Nosavan's crony. At the conclusion of Issara he slinked away into a comfortable position within the civil service, dragged out every now and then to serve in minor posts within previous cabinets. Now, after the failed referendum to abolish the monarchy, new king Boun Oum Na Champassak has stuffed Vongkotrattana into a suit and named him Prime Minister.\n\nHe knows what he is: a mere envoy between the King and his people, the rubber-stamp on royalist policies. Boun Oum got his wish, became king again, and put Vongkotrattana in as Prime MInister to further cement his control over Laos. He's a warm body in a chair, a hand to sign papers, and the job needs nothing else - so in the dead of night, when there's nobody around to hear him, Vongkotrattana often asks between soft sobs: why him?"
 POLITICS_PHOUMI_NOSAVAN_DESC: "Behold the man who couped the Laotian government on three separate occasions: one in support of the Thai, one to oppose them, and one to install himself as the undisputed leader of Laos.\n\nDuring Operation Issara, he was the primary Laotian collaborator for Thailand. Politically savvy, though strategically lacking, he commanded the bulk of collaborator forces against the CGFL in a series of easy victories and crushing defeats. When the Thai withdrew support in 1951, Nosavan self-funded his war with opium sales and theft from Thai armouries. Only when they truly lost patience with him in 1955 did he turn to the CGFL, aiding in their final victory. He faded into the background, returning to the RLA and building up the only base of support he needed: absolute loyalty from the armed forces.\n\nWith the RLA proving itself beyond all expectations in Operation Setthathirath, Nosavan took that ecstatic success and convinced the army that they could show the nay-sayers in the civil government how to run Laos. One more coup, and Nosavan finally has the power he's craved since '49. But now that he has it, he doesn't know what to do with it. He delegates most tasks to yes men only marginally more competent than him, and what tasks he does pursue he can only resolve with brute force.\n\nNone of this will last."
 POLITICS_BONG_SOUVANNAVONG_DESC: "Perhaps one of the most controversial and bizarre Laotian politicians of the 20th century, Bong Souvannavong's peculiar beliefs are buoyed by a shrewd political acumen and a vast web of connections that have seen him rise to the role of Prime Minister.\n\nSouvannavong preaches an eclectic program of traditional social beliefs, monarchism and democracy in harmony, Buddhist moralism and an assortment of vaguely left-wing beliefs on economic equity. All these beliefs come under the umbrella of Dhammic Socialism, Souvannavong's interpretation of Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu's fusion of Buddhist teachings and socialist thought. While many struggle to support or even understand the feasibility of his program - his own son preferred to join the Patriotic Front and their more coherent political ideology - he knows how to court support and play politics to secure power.\n\nThe failure of a conservative regime has brought the eccentric reformer into power. Souvannavong knows that he's being watched like a hawk by his political rivals. Nonetheless, he is confident in his own political acumen. At worst, it will be difficult to dislodge him from power. At best, he might even get a few of his reforms passed - perhaps even an isolated, neutral, independent Laos is on the cards."
 POLITICS_AMKHA_SOUKHAVONG_DESC: "The Hero of Xam Neua was never one for politics, despite fighting for political change his whole life. Serving early as a captain in the CGFL and working his way up to general, Soukhavong proved himself a stalwart defender and an admirable commander when he led the defense of the city against Nosavan's collaborators. Xam Neua was where the CGFL's fortunes turned, and a shrewder Soukhavong could have parlayed his success into a comfortable political career. But Soukhavong never cared for the political process, only that it was a system worth fighting for. Once Issara ended, Soukavong returned to the RLA as a dutiful general, keeping himself out of Vientiane's affairs.\n\nThen Nosavan, king of traitors, marched on Vientiane. What else could Soukhavong do but rally loyalists to its defense? The Battle of Xam Neua played out all over again; history repeated itself with Soukhavong routing Nosavan.\n\nHe understands why they made him Prime Minister after this, even if he resents it. Though he finds the job outside his skillset, he understands his duty to Laos. If a new PM is to be elected, he must ensure free elections and ensure a smooth transition of power. Amkha Soukhavong has proven himself to be the best man to protect Laotian democracy - even if he hates protecting it behind a desk in Vientiane."
