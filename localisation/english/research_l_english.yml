 ## Uniforms ##

 infantry_kit_1:0 "1936 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_1_desc:0 "Influenced by the experiences of World War I, in which pistols and knives were essential for trench warfare, this infantry kit contains a set of them apart from a gas mask. The steel helmet is designed to deflect overhead shell fragments."
 
 infantry_kit_2:0 "1945 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_2_desc:0 "During the Second World War gas attacks were not as common as in the First one, so the importance of masks was reduced. Helmet technology advanced, making head injuries less common, but the helmets are not bulletproof still."
 
 infantry_kit_3:0 "1952 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_3_desc:0 "In general, given the superplus of military equipment left from World War II, infantry kits haven't evolved too much. Some designs have been revised and in the case of footwear, synthetic rubber has been adopted fully as a material."
 
 infantry_kit_4:0 "1958 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_4_desc:0 "With the Cold War generating a series of proxy wars for the superpowers to test their new toys, the already observed need of acclimating equipment and uniforms for tropical or cold conditions has been met with new innovations in material and armor technology."
 
 infantry_kit_5:0 "1964 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_5_desc:0 "As a result of the magazines for assault rifles being too short for the universal pouch, a shorter ammo case has been introduced. It is attached to the belt and has a series of straps on both sides for attaching hand grenades."
 
 infantry_kit_6:0 "1970 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_6_desc:0 "In the helmets, new liners made of ballistic nylon with removable suspension have replaced the older pattern liners. Cotton camouflage covers have become prevalent, with buttonholes for inserting natural foliage for additional camouflage."
 
 infantry_kit_7:0 "1976 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_7_desc:0 "The invention of Kevlar in the US has revolutionized body armour, with the other superpowers rushing to create similar materials. Lightweight, tough, and resilient, bullet-resistant plates have been incorporated in infantry combat vests in a 15-layer pattern covering most vital organs that have greatly increased infantry survivability."
 
 infantry_kit_8:0 "1982 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_8_desc:0 "The eruption of full-scale war across the world has lead to gigantic leaps in infantry kit design greatly aided by accurate battlefield feedback. Innovations once thought to be several decades in the future are being forced onto the soldiers of today, as ballistic protection and shrapnel defence become key focuses of current design."
 
 infantry_kit_9:0 "1988 Infantry Kit"
 infantry_kit_9_desc:0 "Experience from recent total conflicts have brought into sharp relief the critical importance of integrating communications equipment directly into kit, resulting in radio-enabled helmet-visors and the beginnings of realtime vital sign monitoring. However, manufacturing expenses are starting to become so great that only superpowers and their closest allies can afford the cutting edge"

 ## Improvements ##

 infantry_weapons_improvements_mine_1:0 "Infantry Weapon Improvements I"
 infantry_weapons_improvements_mine_1_desc:0 "The advent of plastic materials has allowed the introduction of mines that need less metal than before, making them less detectible by traditional clearance methods."

 infantry_weapons_improvements_ammo_1:0 "Infantry Weapon Improvements II"
 infantry_weapons_improvements_ammo_1_desc:0 "Improvements to the rifle's internal systems can help to resolve mechanical problems and other overlooked issues during the weapon's initial production run."

 infantry_weapons_improvements_grenade_1:0 "Infantry Weapon Improvements III"
 infantry_weapons_improvements_grenade_1_desc:0 "Feedback from the armed forces has led to the development of new grenades that do not produce smoke or noise, making them less noticible to the receiving end of the throw."


 infantry_weapons_improvements_mine_2:0 "Infantry Weapon Improvements VI"
 infantry_weapons_improvements_mine_2_desc:0 "Trials done with newly developed anti-personnel mines have shown them to be more effective than the current models, with a smaller signature and larger blast radius."
 
 infantry_weapons_improvements_ammo_2:0 "Infantry Weapon Improvements V"
 infantry_weapons_improvements_ammo_2_desc:0 "Combat usage has revealed weapon defects and problem areas that can be rectified by making internal changes to the rifle, which will hopefully fix any reliability issues."

 infantry_weapons_improvements_grenade_2:0 "Infantry Weapon Improvements VI"
 infantry_weapons_improvements_grenade_2_desc:0 "Close range combat requires weapons that are effective in such enviroments. Modern shotguns and like weaponry will ensure our forces aren't reliant on their sidearms in these scenarios."


 infantry_weapons_improvements_mine_3:0 "Infantry Weapon Improvements VII"

 IFV_1950_basic_armor:0 "Open-Topped AFVs"
 IFV_1950_basic_armor_desc:0 "Early AFV technologies held little real protection for infantrymen being transported. Often, hatches were non-existent and AFV's held no protection against chemical, nuclear, or biological destruction. Soldiers were exposed to the open air."
 IFV_1950_improved_armor:0 "WMD Protection"
 IFV_1950_improved_armor_desc:0 "Adding hatches and sealing the inside of the AFV, as well as providing clean ventilation, allowed for troops to have effective protection against chemical weapons and, in the case of a nuclear war, radiation. These early WMD protection systems made AFVs far safer."
 IFV_1950_advanced_armor:0 "NBC Protection Innovations"
 IFV_1950_advanced_armor_desc:0 "Advances in ventilation technology as well as the innovation of providing filtered air meant troops could fight and move in even the worst conditions. Advancing upon previous technologies greatly increased protection."

 # 1960
 IFV_1960_basic_armor:0 "Frontal Arc Armor Innovation"
 IFV_1960_basic_armor_desc:0 "Increased armor on the front sheets of the AFV finally achieved one of the key goals of any effective AFV; real protection from large caliber rifles. Advancing AFVs could now safely move towards enemy fire without sustaining damage to the vehicle."
 IFV_1960_improved_armor:0 "Modernized Internal Structure"
 IFV_1960_improved_armor_desc:0 "Using new alloys and synthetic materials in the interior of AFVs provided greater protection to infantry in the AFV. Even if bullets penetrated the first layer, shrapnel would be stopped on the wall of the interior."
 IFV_1960_advanced_armor:0 "Composite Armor"
 IFV_1960_advanced_armor_desc:0 "Layering different ceramics, metals, and plastics atop one another isn't just cheaper then a single steel body - it provides unparalleled protection, deflecting bullets and allowing nothing to penetrate farther then a few inches. Adopting these composite armor developments is revolutionary in AFV design."

 # 1970
 IFV_1970_basic_armor:0 "Reorganized Blueprint"
 IFV_1970_basic_armor_desc:0 "Increased efficiency and reforms in blueprint design allow for faster mass production and the development of more exact armor measurements. This decreases production costs and increases protection."
 IFV_1970_improved_armor:0 "Hull Floor Reinforcement"
 IFV_1970_improved_armor_desc:0 "Increasing hull thickness at the hull while using cheaper and lighter metals means that mines no longer will be a death sentence for the AFV and the infantrymen inside. It will also provide protection against any other explosives and allows for a far more stable ride."
 IFV_1970_advanced_armor:0 "Aluminum Alloy Hull"
 IFV_1970_advanced_armor_desc:0 "The use of not just aluminum, but complex aluminum alloys, allows for far lighter AFVs. These hulls would become present in most AFVs and fighting vehicles of the time."

 IFV_1950_basic_turret:0 "AFV 20mm Autocannon"
 IFV_1950_basic_turret_desc:0 "The 20mm autocannon is the standard of AFVs worldwide, something to give the vehicle more firepower than an APC whilst remaining understanding that it is not supposed to be in the direct line of fire in most circumstances."
 IFV_1950_improved_turret:0 "Firing Ports"
 IFV_1950_improved_turret_desc:0 "One of the main advantages of an AFV is that infantry are not rendered unable to engage in combat whilst traveling. With firing ports and AFV can engage an assailant with its troop complement and not just the arms of the vehicle itself."
 IFV_1950_advanced_turret:0 "Improved Cannon Rotation"
 IFV_1950_advanced_turret_desc:0 "Cannon rotation is important for a vehicle expected to fight on the move, and will give the AFV greatly increased capabilities for engaging hostile forces. However this does not mean it should do so outside exceptional circumstances."

 # 1960
 IFV_1960_basic_turret:0 "AFV 73mm Autocannon"
 IFV_1960_basic_turret_desc:0 "Whilst most AFV's retain the standard 20mm armament there is room for specific models to have greatly increased firepower depending upon their desired role. Additionally, this will assist in fighting entrenched enemy positions."
 IFV_1960_improved_turret:0 "Co-axial Machine Guns"
 IFV_1960_improved_turret_desc:0 "Machine guns are an important part of the armament of an AFV, and their placement is important so as to provide the widest firing arc possible. Suppression is an under appreciated factor of warfare upon occasion."
 IFV_1960_advanced_turret:0 "Enclosed Firing Ports"
 IFV_1960_advanced_turret_desc:0 "An improvement to firing ports is to give the infantrymen using them better protection. It is, after all, best if an AFV can get its entire complement to the fight as opposed to losing a man needlessly."

 # 1970
 IFV_1970_basic_turret:0 "Anti-Tank Capabilities"
 IFV_1970_basic_turret_desc:0 "The tank is a significant threat to any AFV, but they may be more wary if the AFV has some teeth of its own. No AFV should seek an engagement with armor of course, but circumstances sometimes demand difficult decisions."
 IFV_1970_improved_turret:0 "Improved Armament Setups"
 IFV_1970_improved_turret_desc:0 "One of the more important factors of any AFV design is its actual weapon setup. The main gun needs to be capable of effectively engaging foes, as well as being a moderated support weapon arrangement for additional combat firepower."
 IFV_1970_advanced_turret:0 "90mm Cannon"
 IFV_1970_advanced_turret_desc:0 "Whilst an AFV might not be exactly designed for sustained combat, it should not be helpless. A 90mm cannon works wonders against vehicles, perhaps moreso on soldiers."

 # 1980
 IFV_1980_basic_turret:0 "Two Man Guns"
 IFV_1980_basic_turret_desc:0 "A two man cannon is arguably superior to a one man design, as it removes some of the vulnerabilities associated with one man being knocked out in combat or being distracted doing two things at once."
 IFV_1980_improved_turret:0 "More Firing Ports"
 IFV_1980_improved_turret_desc:0 "Increasing the number of firing ports will allow to troops to return fire from the safety of the AFV, even when they are engaged while moving or unable to exit the vehicle."
 IFV_1980_advanced_turret:0 "Anti-Tank Missiles"
 IFV_1980_advanced_turret_desc:0 "The next logical step in increasing the fighting capabilities of our AFVs is mounting them with anti-tank missiles. This will allow them to engage heavier armor with moderate success."

 MBT_1950_improved_armor:0 "Siliceous-Cored Armor"
 MBT_1950_improved_armor_desc:0 "Putting a piece of fused silica glass between two rolled steel plates almost doubles the armor effectiveness of the steel plates. This will help our tanks shrug off enemy fire much easier."
 MBT_1950_advanced_armor:0 "Combination K Ceramic Type"
 MBT_1950_advanced_armor_desc:0 "Instead of glass, our experiments have found a layer of plastic reinforced by glass and ceramic plates works much better. We can defend against HEAT rounds and shaped charges better without sacrificing defense against kinetic energy penetrators."

 # 1960
 MBT_1960_basic_armor:0 "Multi-layered Steel-Ceramic Composite"
 MBT_1960_basic_armor_desc:0 "By incorporating many spaced layers of hardened steel with layers of boron carbide composite, the effectiveness of our armor plate becomes enormously greater, as the projectile shatters as it travels through the different materials."
 MBT_1960_improved_armor:0 "Advanced Armor Skirts"
 MBT_1960_improved_armor_desc:0 "By placing strong armor composites on the outside of the tank hull, spaced just a few inches from the main armor, we can radically increase its effectiveness, as the spaced armor causes shaped-charge projectiles to shatter and explode before they can strike the main plate."
 MBT_1960_advanced_armor:0 "Prototype Reactive Armor"
 MBT_1960_advanced_armor_desc:0 "We can equip our tanks with additional armor composed high explosive sandwiched in between composite metallic-ceramic plating, which, when struck by an armor-piercing round, should explode and shatter the projectile, greatly decreasing its damaging potential, if not negating it entirely. However, this armor is could prove expensive and unreliable."

 MBT_1970_basic_armor:0 "Improved Ceramic Compounds"
 MBT_1970_basic_armor_desc:0 "More research into ceramic technology has given us a number of interesting possibilities. We now have many new combinations of materials to stick between our steel plates."
 MBT_1970_improved_armor:0 "Boron-Carbide Aggregate"
 MBT_1970_improved_armor_desc:0 "Boron-Carbide is one of the hardest known materials out there, and attempts must be to made into integrate it into the armor of our vehicles. We will put it in between the steel plates to make a hard composite armor."
 MBT_1970_advanced_armor:0 "Chobham Armor"
 MBT_1970_advanced_armor_desc:0 "Ceramic plating may provide more protection than the current materials. An improved version of the early ceramic prototypes is now being produced, and it gives us better protection against HEAT shells than anything else out there."

 MBT_1980_basic_armor:0 "Depleted Uranium Composites"
 MBT_1980_basic_armor_desc:0 "Depleted Uranium, a by-product of uranium enrichment, can be incorporated into some of the layers of already established composites. Due to its high density, it can shatter the projectile more effectively than standard composites."
 MBT_1980_improved_armor:0 "Advanced Explosive Reactive Armor"
 MBT_1980_improved_armor_desc:0 "More advanced and more sensitive high explosives can be incorporated into our reactive armor plates, allowing them to more effectively destroy incoming projectiles before they damage their targets."
 MBT_1980_advanced_armor:0 "Non-Energetic Reactive Armor"
 MBT_1980_advanced_armor_desc:0 "Instead of using high explosives sandwiched in-between armor plates, we could use a porous material like rubber. When struck by a shaped charge warhead, the warhead's energy causes a dramatic increase in pressure and counter-explosion in the rubber, destroying the warhead. While slightly less effective, it is much safer and lighter than the explosive variety."

 MBT_1970_improved_turret_desc:0 "Enemy tanks are getting harder to penetrate, so we use harder weaponry. After much research, our scientists have decided that depleted uranium shells will allow us to breech enemy armor most effectively."
 MBT_1970_advanced_turret:0 "IR Detector and Night Vision"
 MBT_1970_advanced_turret_desc:0 "Installing infrared and night vision systems on our tanks allow our tank crews to see more, avoiding ambushes and camouflage, and allowing our tanks to operate more effectively at night."

 # 1980
 MBT_1980_basic_turret:0 "Fire-Control Computer"
 MBT_1980_basic_turret_desc:0 "The introduction of integrated fire-control electronics within our turrets will increase sight effectiveness by a high margin. Our systems are capable of producing all the figures a gunner needs in mere seconds, delivering a quick and accurate firing solution."
 MBT_1980_improved_turret:0 "Thermal Coating"
 MBT_1980_improved_turret_desc:0 "Using an advanced thermal shielding on the interior of the turrets barrel should reduce the level of deformation that occurs from high temperatures. This advancement will allow a greater fire rate within our tank, as the heat becomes more thoroughly managed."
 MBT_1980_advanced_turret:0 "Anti-tank Laser-guided Missiles"
 MBT_1980_advanced_turret_desc:0 "Gun launched guided missiles will give our gunners a degree of flexibility that is much needed within tank battles. These missiles can be hand guided right into enemy armor, with a considerable amount of flight time."

 artillery_barrage:0 "Artillery Barrage"
 artillery_barrage_desc:0 "Artillery has existed in some form for hundreds of years, and continues to be relevant today. A good artillery barrage saves the lives of many infantrymen, instilling fear in enemy lines and disrupting their operations. There are many new innovations to be made in this field.\n\n"
 preemptive_strike:0 "Preemptive Strike"
 preemptive_strike_desc:0 "The best defense is always a good offense. Why should we wait in hiding-holes for the enemy to confront or even maneuver around us when we could be taking the fight to them. By hitting them before they are prepared for battle we are able to fight on our own terms.\n\n"

 organic_units:0 "Organic Units"
 organic_units_desc:0 "While broader tactical support is an important part of our doctrine, so too are organic units. In the interest of response time and cohesion, we will allow each branch to create specialized support forces. With any luck, they will fulfill roles of their rival branches while remaining embedded within their own."

 land_navy_coordination:0 "Land-Naval Coordination"

 maneuver_warfare_desc:0 "Maneuver warfare may be an obselescent doctrine, but its core principles are still useful today. By adding modern day tactics, we can easily reapply the strategy that had once guided the Reich to victory.\n\n"

 schwerpunkt_tactics:0 "Schwerpunkt Tactics"
 schwerpunkt_tactics_desc:0 "Schwerpunkt - "focal point" in German - refers to the strategy of concentrating an attack onto one portion of an enemy's defensive line. The tactic is intended to break through this portion and quickly spread into the rear of an enemy's line. By training our forces with this philosophy in mind, we shall take the first step to a Blitzkrieg of our own.\n\n"
 spearpoints:0 "Spearpoints"
 spearpoints_desc:0 "The idea of Schwerpunkt must be drilled not just into our men, but into our generals too. We must make sure that all of our forces are ready, willing, and able to perform offensives at a moment's notice if the doctrine is to work as intended.\n\n"

 massive_bombardment:0 "Massive Bombardment"
 massive_bombardment_desc:0 "The Schwerpunkt is certainly a strong tactic, but much of it rests on the assumption that the initial attack succeeds. To maximize our chances, we must make sure that any section we attack is first pummeled by artillery and aircraft alike. In a perfect scenario, our forces will stroll over what remains of their lines without a single causality.\n\n"
 overwhelming_strikes:0 "Overwhelming Strikes"
 overwhelming_strikes_desc:0 "Our attacks must be absolute in their power and force. We cannot afford to hold reserves or be cautious about our Schwerpunkt - total success or total defeat rides on the piercing blow. We must train our troops to move from place to place quickly in order to organize as many massive strikes as possible.\n\n"

 combined_blitz:0 "Combined Blitz"
 combined_blitz_desc:0 "A Schwerpunkt attack with only armor is suicidal. A Schwerpunkt attack with only infantry is doubly so. But combined, along with air support, these form into a nigh-unstoppable force. It is of the utmost importance that we improve coordination between all wings of our armed forces.\n\n"

 adaptive_command_training:0 "Adaptive Command Training"
 adaptive_command_training_desc:0 "The tides of war can be as unpredictable as those of a stormy sea, and we must train our officers to account for this reality. Soon not even surprise and circumstance are acceptable excuses.\n\n"
 mission_type_tactics:0 "Mission-Type Tactics"
 mission_type_tactics_desc:0 "While we cannot always expect our officers to predict the circumstances of combat, we can train them in every scenario we can think of. The more familiar they become with the situations they are likely to encounter, the better our officers will be able to confront our enemies in a more efficient fashion.\n\n"
 military_deception:0 "Military Deception"
 military_deception_desc:0 "Part of the problem of adopting a strategy used to win the biggest war in history is that tactics are developed to counter it. Our enemies are doubtless ready to rush reinforcements to wherever we attack - therefore, we shall use feints to trick them into sending their forces away from the true battle.\n\n"

 assault_concentration:0 "Assault Concentration"
 assault_concentration_desc:0 "Our officers shall conduct en masse attacks as resources and war's fortunes permit. They may be adepts in fighting equal or superior forces, but they are savants in fighting with the deck stacked in their favor.\n\n"
 strategic_depth_exploitation:0 "Strategic Depth Exploitation"
 strategic_depth_exploitation_desc:0 "We will strive to keep a significant distance between our front lines and the vulnerable home front. The use of depots and armories along the routes and airports for transportation will ensure that we are able to attack and defend without worrying about throwing our defenses into disarray.\n\n"
 supply_chain_extension:0 "Supply-Chain Extension"
 supply_chain_extension_desc:0 "Fighting deep into enemy territory is often required of the mobile modern army, likewise leaving them vulnerable to supply shortages and encirclement. We will train our generals to extend their supply lines through the use of rear echelon forces and garrisons that can secure the roads from home.\n\n"

 shock_and_awe:0 "Shock And Awe"
 shock_and_awe_desc:0 "Even a well-prepared enemy can be thrown off of their footing by an impressive enough display of firepower and force. By leveraging massed artillery fire, coordinated air strikes, and overwhelming numbers at the point of contact any enemy can be crushed.\n\n"

 ## Strategic Theorem
 strategic_theorem:0 "Strategic Theorem"
 strategic_theorem_desc:0 "Wars are unglamorous, but there is beauty in seeing well-planned, well-timed and well-performed operations unfold in real time. Our generals shall prioritize perfecting this art.\n\n"

 prepared_defense:0 "Prepared Redoubt Systems"
 prepared_defense_desc:0 "Small, well-fortified redoubts will serve as early warning systems against incoming enemy attacks. If positioned at certain strategic positions, these redoubts can delay offensives for hours and even days.\n\n"
 army_reserve_training:0 "Army Reserve Training"
 army_reserve_training_desc:0 "Guns, tanks and planes only perform as well as the men who man them. Take away the men, and even the most sophisticated weapon systems remain as inert and useless as scrap metal. A healthy reserve corps will preclude this scenario from occurring in our armies.\n\n"
 infrastructural_reserve:0 "Infrastructural Reserve"
 infrastructural_reserve_desc:0 "By maintaining a stockpile of construction materials, construction equipment and construction workers on hand, roads and factories damaged from air strikes or artillery fire will not have to wait long before returning to work as good as new.\n\n"

 operational_assault:0 "Operational Assault"
 operational_assault_desc:0 "An offensive attacks not only from the front, but also behind the adversary's lines and within their home fronts. A good general masters all three attacks to achieve unconditional victory.\n\n"
 large_front_operations:0 "Large Front Operations"
 large_front_operations_desc:0 "By striking the enemy at multiple points simultaneously along their entire front we can keep our foes on their backfoot and without the initiative. They dare not launch a counterattack for fear of being broken through down the line and they further have no ability to reinforce the points of contact as there are too many to handle even by the best led armies.\n\n"
 overwhelming_force:0 "Overwhelming Force"
 overwhelming_force_desc:0 "There is no point in fighting a battle you cannot be sure you will win. In modern warfare, the waste of equipment and manpower cannot be condoned. That is why, when we do attack, we do so with such a massed force as to sweep away any defensive that might be offered.\n\n"

 comprehensive_strategic_analysis:0 "Comprehensive Strategic Analysis"
 comprehensive_strategic_analysis_desc:0 "We need to train our staff officers to be able to grasp the strategic implication of every on-ground decision, and to be able to see the big picture as well as the small. Far too often an army is ruined by an inability to look beyond the tactical level. This will not happen to our forces, as our generals will have the skills needed to craft intelligent and successful operations.\n\n"
 large_scale_exercises:0 "Large Scale Exercises"
 large_scale_exercises_desc:0 "Individual recruit training is of course, a requirement for any professional army, but so too is strategic training. Using divisions, corps, and even entire armies we can simulate massive battlefields in which our generals will be able to learn the skills of directing troops and our soldiers will better learn to fight in their greater roles together.\n\n"

 supply_routes:0 "Supply Chain Reinforcement"
 supply_routes_desc:0 "Our use of large scale operations is contingent upon plentiful supply lines. It is therefore imperative that we adequately prepare them by using our engineers to rebuild infrastructure in occupied territories and using reserve forces as truck drivers and escorts wherever possible to ensure a steady line of supply reaches the front.\n\n"
 wartime_industry:0 "Wartime Industry"
 wartime_industry_desc:0 "Napoleon had learned that an army marches on his stomach; a century and a half later, the army's stomach has grown enough to necessitate a nation's worth of factories and workers. Ours shall step up to the task.\n\n"

 strategic_cycles:0 "Strategic Cycles"
 strategic_cycles_desc:0 "Always being on the offense will quickly wear out our forces, and always being on the defensive will ruin morale. We can make our strategic objectives easier to grasp and therefore easier to carry out by placing them into a cycle. We will attack along the line, hold to stabilize, and then attack after letting the enemy whittle themselves down uselessly.\n\n"
 concurrent_front_assaults:0 "Concurrent Frontal Assaults"
 concurrent_front_assaults_desc:0 "An enemy on the back foot, no matter how strong, can neither defend itself nor fight back. Our strategies shall hence make use of multiple units fighting concurrently to keep the enemy as often in the back foot as possible.\n\n"

 improved_depth_charges:0 "1950 Depth Charges"
 improved_depth_charges_desc:0 "As navies increasingly became the domains of submarines and aircraft, depth charges correspondingly improved. The ability to track and engage submarines, even those deep beneath water, was the first of these advances."
 advanced_depth_charges:0 "1960 Depth Charges"
 advanced_depth_charges_desc:0 "In the 1960s, as cruise missiles quickly became the dominant means of engaging enemy submarines, depth charges rapidly developed a secondary and specialist role. New technology better enabled these necessary changes."
 modern_depth_charges:0 "1970 Depth Charges"
 modern_depth_charges_desc:0 "The development of nuclear submarines corresponded with an ever more specialized role of depth charges. Rather than being able to engage submarines under water, they became better adapted to react submarines attempting to breach the surface, or to constrict movement."
 even_more_modern_depth_charges:0 "1980 Depth Charges"
 even_more_modern_depth_charges_desc:0 "As superpowers became increasingly preoccupied with limiting enemy nuclear capabilities, depth charges struggled to adapt to the new ability. New tracking mechanisms for nuclear fuel signatures helped to manage this difficult situation."

 good_sonar:0 "1960 Sonar"
 good_sonar_desc:0 "As the era of the nuclear submarine approached, the importance of the sonar - both active and passive variants - greatly increased. The development is largely spurred by an effort to prevent these dangerous ships from approaching the shores of our country."
 advanced_sonar:0 "1970 Sonar"
 advanced_sonar_desc:0 "As submarines became increasingly capable of avoiding standard sonar systems, locating mechanisms struggled to keep pace. The advent of new, and more precise methods was a godsend for the industry, and forced submarines to once again lurk in deeper waters."
 semi_modern_sonar:0 "1980 Sonar"
 semi_modern_sonar_desc:0 "The increasing prevalence of nuclear powered submarines forced sonar to become more accurate, quick to function, and accompanied with computing technology. While it did much to even the odds, it could not keep pace with the ever advancing pace of deep sea technology."
 modern_sonar:0 "1990 Sonar"
 modern_sonar_desc:0 "In order to counteract sonar-resistant hulls and entanglement systems, sonar became ever more portable and able to track and measure even the slightest deep-sea disturbances.

Custom-building nuclear reactors for cruisers is therefore a worthwhile project."
 nuclear_cruiser_1970:0 "1970 Nuclear Cruiser Reactor"
 nuclear_cruiser_1970_desc:0 "The 1970s saw steady improvements in cruiser reactor technology. Reactors became better protected, and crews better trained, steadily reducing the number of incidents and examples of radiation poisoning."
 nuclear_cruiser_1980:0 "1980 Nuclear Cruiser Reactor"
 nuclear_cruiser_1980_desc:0 "As enemy fleets became ever more tenacious and meticulous, cruisers could only cope by becoming ever faster. The newest generation of reactors will allow our sea killers to avoid being pray."
 nuclear_cruiser_1990:0 "1990 Nuclear Cruiser Reactor"

 social_construction_1:0 "Social Building Construction I"
 social_construction_1_desc:0 "Though the fires of the Second World War are a decade behind us now, the massive technological boom the conflict brought with it is only now beginning to become widespread in civilian life. The lessons learned from constructing infrastructure in the hellish conditions of total war will allow us to construct far more robust transport links in peacetime; the same air bases that launched bombers and ports that floated battleships will now be home and host to cruise ships and PanAm flights."
 social_construction_2:0 "Social Building Construction II"
 social_construction_2_desc:0 "Now more than ever we have come to realize the sheer power of the simple highway; it yields great cultural power as well as economic, and as more and more of our nation's people gain access to personal vehicles, we desperately need an expansion of our nascent infrastructure. By using new innovations in the fields of construction and civil engineering, we have the ability to create a strong national network of infrastructure, turning our nation into a single, co-operative machine."
 social_construction_3:0 "Social Building Construction III"
 social_construction_3_desc:0 "As our population continues to expand, so too must our transport links. Larger airports, more efficient dockyards, poly-lane concrete knots of highway inevitably tying our metropolitan areas together into a cohesive entity. Our nation's heart is beating; we must ensure that the veins are wide enough to accommodate the blood. This "Cold War" is being fought more and more on the economic battlefield, and that makes ports, roads, and dockyards our frontline soldiers."
 social_construction_4:0 "Social Building Construction IV"
 social_construction_4_desc:0 "We are on the precipice of something truly new and exciting; as computing technology improves at a rapid pace, experiments into "packet switching" have begun to bear fruit. In a decade, we may all be communicating over computers; perhaps we will have no need for highways and dockyards in the first place! For now, however, we ought to begin the slow process of digitization-- imagine the speed of an airport that already has your ticket number before you even show up, or the limitless potential of a fully automated toll road. By embracing this nascent technology, we can improve both the construction time and efficiency of our national infrastructure."

 military_construction_1:0 "Military Building Construction I"
 military_construction_1_desc:0 "War is the failure of the war of diplomacy, and a responsible authority must be prepared for such an eventuality. Supplements to the military itself, such as RADAR stations, forts, and anti-air guns are all necessary in order to defend the homeland in full. Such defense infrastructure will be improved and strengthened with new technology and methods. With these, the military shall have an easier time doing its job."
 military_construction_2:0 "Military Building Construction II"
 military_construction_2_desc:0 "As the pace of innovation grows faster, so too must we race to update and adapt to these new developments. Forts must be strengthened and made to hide. RADAR stations must be fortified and retrofitted with new equipment. Anti-air must have longer and longer ranges and be able to withstand outside attack. Such is the nature of this day and age, where the pace of development increases every day."
 military_construction_3:0 "Military Building Construction III"
 military_construction_3_desc:0 "Forts, RADAR, and anti-air, as the main bulwark against enemy attack, must constantly be retrofitted, expanded, and maintained. As our capabilities expand, our armies will be strengthened along with them, and victory ever more possible. Our already strong defenses shall become even stronger and more reliable in the face of enemy attack."
 military_construction_4:0 "Military Building Construction IV"
 military_construction_4_desc:0 "With the tense situation in the world, our strong defenses have been outfitted further with new technologies and methods. With the chances of war becoming likelier and likelier by the day, our military facilities such as airfields, troop bases, RADAR stations, and anti-air have been improved. Our country's defenses, already strong in the face of threats, will now become impregnable."

 administration_construction_1:0 "Administrative Building Construction I"
 administration_construction_1_desc:0 "The Second World War saw a massive expansion of the complexity of military, governmental and private institutions. By integrating the lessons of this conflict our state can expand and improve our administrative facilities."
 administration_construction_2:0 "Administrative Building Construction II"
 administration_construction_2_desc:0 "The post war cycles of booms and busts have put the humdrum science of administration under increased focus. Efforts to make administrative and business apparatus more efficient, transparent and nimble are beginning to pay fruits as a new generation of administrators joins the workforce."
 administration_construction_3:0 "Administrative Building Construction III"
 administration_construction_3_desc:0 "As the industrial age permitted craftsmen to automate and expand their productivity, our burgeoning age of electronics is giving office workers an array of tools to multiply the work they tackle."
 administration_construction_4:0 "Administrative Building Construction IV"
 administration_construction_4_desc:0 "Developing further the use of technological tool and administrative reforms allows our administrators to work on ever expanding and ever more complicated tasks as our state stays abreast of economic and technological developments."
 
 education_construction_1:0 "School Construction I"
 education_construction_1_desc:0 "The transformation of the uneducated, particularly children, into model citizens knowledgeable in the skills necessary to function in the modern world has long been considered a core duty of the government. By directing our energy into establishing schools of all levels, we can further the cause of education on a national scale."
 education_construction_2:0 "School Construction II"
 education_construction_2_desc:0 "A further prioritization of educational infrastructure will allow us to produce more advanced facilities for our nation's students. Up to date science and technology teaching facilities and larger capacity spaces for physical education will also be prioritized. With schools such as these, our future will be well secured."
 
 health_construction_1:0 "Hospital Construction I"
 health_construction_1_desc:0 "Without hospitals, no nation can consider itself truly modern. A concept refined over the past centuries, hospitals allow for the organised treatment of illness and infirmity without needing to rely on local specialists. Even a small one can provide great benefit to the communities which surround it."
 health_construction_2:0 "Hospital Construction II"
 health_construction_2_desc:0 "A modernised hospital has many advances from their older kin. Be it improved design layouts, technology or even dedicated research facilities, it all goes towards ensuring greater results and comfort for the patients of a given facility."
 
 prison_construction_1:0 "Prison Construction I"
 prison_construction_1_desc:0 "Sometimes, those persons who fundamentally disagree with the way society runs cannot be allowed to remain inside it, and must be separated from regular life. The prison system is the means by which this is done, punishing those guilty of crime in the eye of a given society."
 prison_construction_2:0 "Prison Construction II"
 prison_construction_2_desc:0 "If a prison can be escaped, it is not a particularly effective facility. Improved layouts for the facility and training for personnel goes a long way towards mitigating not only escapes, but also improves the livelihood of those incarcerated to some degree. If those in charge will it of course."
 
 army_base_construction_1:0 "Military Base Construction I"
 army_base_construction_1_desc:0 "Every unit that we have in the field requires at least one base facility back home. It is in these sprawling complexes that soldiers spend most of their time in between deployment. Fielding a strong force depends in no small part on our military facilities. Luckily, we have plenty of recent records to draw on, allowing us to see what works, what does not, and what can be improved."
 army_base_construction_2:0 "Military Base Construction II"
 army_base_construction_2_desc:0 "By standardizing the layout of our military bases we can significantly decrease the time and effort required to build new complexes. Further, removing extraneous facilities from our plans will cut costs to both time and resources."
 
 production_unit_gain_1:0 "Industry Management I"
 production_unit_gain_1_desc:0 "The art of industrial management is a burgeoning new field with enormous potential to improve our production yields a thousandfold. From ensuring that all the paperwork that coordinates the activities of the 4 M's - Man, Material, Machine and Method - are in order, to simplifying wasteful processes and supply chains, in order for our industry to compete on the global scale (and satisfy our domestic demands) both private companies and our own nationalized firms are beginning to dedicate significant sections of their managerial class to this new discipline."
 production_unit_gain_2:0 "Industry Management II"
 production_unit_gain_2_desc:0 "With the increasing rationalization of our industrial practices comes friction with the ones who actually carry them out. Industrial unions have emerged as a powerful force representing the workers and their demands for higher wages and increased benefits, and it is the job of the new industrial manager to accommodate their demands while maintaining high productivity - either for the state and its demands, or the voracious appetite of the free market."
 production_unit_gain_3:0 "Industry Management III"
 production_unit_gain_3_desc:0 "Automotive companies were the first to realize how dramatically production output and quality increase by utilizing a system of group assembly, where a group of workers is responsible for the entire process of assembly of one car, as opposed to the previous method of line assembly. Now these ideas are spreading rapidly as the cutting edge in industrial management, and their results in productivity are tremendous - as are their effects on morale."
 production_unit_gain_4:0 "Industry Management IV"
 production_unit_gain_4_desc:0 "The introduction of the system of 'quality circles', whereby workers are now involved in the management process by being allowed to make suggestions to improve production efficiency, has started yet another revolution in the management of industries globally. In some cases, designated 'leaders' have been given the right to halt production entirely if they notice a flaw occurring - while this has tremendously increased build and output quality, it has concentrated a huge amount of power in the hands of the workers, something the field appears to be concerned about."
 production_unit_gain_5:0 "Industry Management V"
 production_unit_gain_5_desc:0 "Techniques for improving productivity not only involve workers and their specific roles but also layout and spatial organization. New methods of planning now incorporate specific factory designs with segmented and interlinked regions to minimize wasteful space and keep the flow of production running with as few obstacles as possible - requiring changes in layout, job assignment, and renovation handled in as smooth and well-planned a fashion as possible."
 production_unit_gain_6:0 "Industry Management VI"
 production_unit_gain_6_desc:0 "Developments in spatial organization have coincided with the first wave of introduction of industrial robots - currently simple machines that can only perform the simplest and most repetitive of tasks, albeit at a fraction of the long-term cost of a human worker. Managing the acquisition of these machines and intelligently placing them in the most important parts of the production line without causing disputes with the existing workforce is rapidly becoming a vital function of any good industrial manager."
 production_unit_gain_7:0 "Industry Management VII"
 production_unit_gain_7_desc:0 "Advances in computing and robotics technology offer unparalleled opportunities to streamline the process of personnel management - though the initial investment in these highly advanced and technical machines is prohibitively costly at this time. Radical new ideas of diversifying the locations of factories (even abroad) have gained so much traction they now influence the political process. Nations and companies stuck in the ways of the past now lose ground daily to those utilizing the new techniques, making continued advancement all the more required."
 production_unit_gain_8:0 "Industry Management VIII"
 production_unit_gain_8_desc:0 "Dramatic shifts have occurred globally in the theories of how to manage industries, and there are now multiple competing streams almost aligned with the geopolitical situation. Techniques for breaking the power of unions entirely using competing incentives like stock options, and even shifting entire enterprises to different countries with less heavy labor law have become predominant in some parts. Others incorporate them entirely into the process using their ideological alignment. Some mix and match - but the end result is a completely changed industrial landscape of equal parts man and robotic machine."
 production_unit_gain_9:0 "Industry Management IX"
 production_unit_gain_9_desc:0 "The field of industrial management is unrecognizable from its inception several decades ago. Highly advanced practices utilizing a mixture of robots, advanced computers, and men have resulted in industrial behemoths capable of producing several times the output of what would have taken decades to complete just a few years ago. In order to keep this titanic productive capacity functional and in control modern industrial managers and techniques are more in demand than ever, and those that employ them have an immense and unbeatable competitive advantage."
 
 consumer_goods_reduction_1:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency I"
 consumer_goods_reduction_1_desc:0 "Consumer goods comprise the things our citizens enjoy in their normal everyday lives. However, inefficiencies in their production can prove wasteful towards other needs of the state. Therefore, technological improvements should be used to increase the efficiency of production and keep both the nation and its people satisfied."
 consumer_goods_reduction_2:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency II"
 consumer_goods_reduction_2_desc:0 "They may be well desired by our people, but the fact still remains that consumer goods put a burden on our nation's production capabilities and can clog up factories and divest resources from being put to use in national needs, such as military equipment. Improving this issue will be much needed for the future."
 consumer_goods_reduction_3:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency III"
 consumer_goods_reduction_3_desc:0 "Consumer goods consist of the wide array of necessities our people make use of consistently. It is therefore vital that we learn to manufacture such goods with the least waste, so that more of our citizens can procure such goods while also allowing for our country to invest more resources into important military matters."
 consumer_goods_reduction_4:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency IV"
 consumer_goods_reduction_4_desc:0 "Even more prevalent these days is the rise in technology and machinery in the day-to-day lives of our citizens and the items they obtain, which have proven to be effective for them but will take a toll on our factories to produce. Therefore, refining production will help better prepare for the mass-production of these personal devices."
 consumer_goods_reduction_5:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency V"
 consumer_goods_reduction_5_desc:0 "Consumer goods include the belongings, technology, utilities, and tools used by our countrymen on a daily basis. With technological advancements becoming even more pronounced, they allow people to greatly improve the efficiency of their everyday tasks. So too can technology be used to maximize the productivity of the making of these goods, so as to ease the load of our nation's industry as a whole."
 consumer_goods_reduction_6:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency VI"
 consumer_goods_reduction_6_desc:0 "As our industry burgeons and both the world, and our country's innovators and engineers make headway into streamlining production and design, the rate at which we produce our consumer goods increase, and the negative impact it has on the rest of our economy is beginning to lessen gradually. The production of consumer goods is a vital part of the economy, and as we produce and our people buy, the flow of money into our economy will benefit us greatly."
 consumer_goods_reduction_7:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency VII"
 consumer_goods_reduction_7_desc:0 "With the popularization of computers as more than just big, clunky devices used to crack ciphers or count censuses, the production efficiency of our economy has increased up to an even greater point. The competition between making consumer goods and the rest of our economy seems to be lessening, as new methods to increase our productivity make both our lives, and our citizens' lives easier."
 consumer_goods_reduction_8:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency VIII"
 consumer_goods_reduction_8_desc:0 "Upstart new entrepreneurs make computers that the average person can put into their home, and production methods, supervision, and coordination have all advanced with the passing of time. As the economy develops, consumer goods fly off the shelves, injecting money into our economy and benefiting everyone that takes a part in it. The part of our economy that produces consumer goods is no longer such a ball and chain like it was in the years past."
 consumer_goods_reduction_9:0 "Consumer Goods Production Efficiency IX"
 consumer_goods_reduction_9_desc:0 "The economy soars. Worldwide, the efficiency of consumer goods is no longer a detriment any longer, owing to the culmination of decades of technological development: be it computers, tools, or factory organization. Both civilian and military sectors of our economy work in almost tandem, the burden of producing consumer goods having been eased as much as possible. With the prevalence of ever advancing computers, we expect this trend will only continue into the future."
 
 energy_technology_1:0 "Energy Production Technology"
 energy_technology_1_desc:0 "Energy is the single most important resource for any nation in the current era, being the lifeline by which all the vital processes which sustain both state and private enterprise are maintained. Modern processes for Coal and Oil production and processing generate several times the output of previous techniques, important both for industrializing nations struggling to escape their agrarian past and developed nations attempting to carve out their mark on the world. Output, more than efficiency, is the keyword of today - he who controls the power controls the world."
 energy_technology_2:0 "Improved Energy Production Technology"
 energy_technology_2_desc:0 "A virtual arms race has begun in the field of energy production, now more heavily in the field of oil processing than any other fuel. The petroleum industry has become both immensely profitable and extremely vital for materials science with the emergence of plastics, and has pioneered techniques that not only include extremely high-volume shipping of immense quantities of oil across the seas, but large-scale processing and destructive refinement that has steadily increased in power output to match the endless hunger of both civilian and military demands."
 energy_technology_3:0 "Advanced Energy Production Technology"
 energy_technology_3_desc:0 "It all came crashing down with the global oil crisis. With dramatic shocks to oil supply, the energy industry adapted as rapidly as it could towards maximum efficiency and alternative sources of energy, seeking to extract as much fuel as they possibly could from what supplies exist within their operational borders, as well as utilizing previously underused sectors. Natural gas, once burned off in gigantic flares at pump sites, has emerged as a modern champion - and techniques such as fracking, involving the internal shattering of deep bedrock formations with a fluid, have allowed previously untappable reserves to be accessed. The environmental cost of these new methods, however, is now a hotly contested debate."
 energy_technology_4:0 "Modern Energy Production Technology"
 energy_technology_4_desc:0 "Computers and digitization have begun to emerge in this field as in many others to optimize and maximize the production cycle in previously unimaginable ways, and a new order has emerged from the ashes of the Oil Crisis. While the black gold remains the lifeblood of empires, Biofuels and increased use of non-combustion based sources have begun to radically reshape the way nations and consumers partake in the energy cycle. Increased popular demand for environmental protections has also emerged as a growingly severe side-effect of the more ruthless techniques of extraction now in common use. Global fuel consumption has skyrocketed nations previously dominated by other powers come into their own and carve out their own industries and demands. The future is anyone's game, now more than ever."
 
 nuclear_technology_1:0 "Nuclear Energy Technology"
 nuclear_technology_1_desc:0 "The most titanic conflicts ever witnessed in history came to an end in the previous decade with humanity finally reaching the atomic frontier and harnessing the power of the fundamental constituents of reality - and then proceeding to use this immense energy in acts of immense and unprecedented destruction. Out of this burning, lethally radioactive fallout emerged the New Order - and the Atomic Age. Now, peaceful applications of that wartime research are rapidly emerging, as the potential for limitless energy and a post-scarcity world have begun to capture the imagination of millions of people."
 nuclear_technology_2:0 "Improved Nuclear Energy Technology"
 nuclear_technology_2_desc:0 "Improvements in nuclear power have advanced steadily as prototypes of 'nuclear submarines' and other atomic-powered vehicles begin reaching the experimental production stage. Fusion, once dismissed as the sole domain of the stars, is now the ultimate goal of nuclear engineers, with reactors the size of megaprojects being proposed in an attempt to harness this seemingly inexhaustible source. The materials science required, however, still seems to be tantalizingly out of the grasp of current science."
 nuclear_technology_3:0 "Advanced Nuclear Energy Technology"
 nuclear_technology_3_desc:0 "The Oil Crisis has provoked massive funding from both governments and private sources into the avenue of nuclear power, with fission reactors assuming increasingly important roles across the power grids of advanced nations. Though energy output has increased exponentially with the development of the technology, so has the waste produced - and nuclear waste remains a hazard for dozens of generations after it is created. Solutions to efficient waste disposal and maximising the output of energy with as little nuclear fuel as possible has become the driving force behind the current industry, with other concerns thrown to the wayside."
 nuclear_technology_4:0 "Modern Nuclear Energy Technology"
 nuclear_technology_4_desc:0 "As the crisis in fossil fuel supply eased, nuclear power has assumed less of a last-ditch role and become increasingly integrated and accepted as a standard component of the fuel grid. With fusion power remaining out of reach despite immense efforts to create a practical, net-gain reactor design, fission power has become by far the dominant field of both construction and research. Though occasional voices point to the potential safety dangers and apparent flaws in reactor design, nuclear energy as a percentage of output only seems to be increasing - and this trend is unlikely to change without some sort of radical reassessment of the technology."

 horse_upgrade_1_desc:0 "Work to take Equine equipments out of the prototype phase has begun with minor albeit crucial improvements to their tactical gear."
 horse_upgrade_split_1_1:0 "Advanced Equine Training Methods"
 horse_upgrade_split_1_1_desc:0 "It is reckless to conscript a lot of ponypower and pray that we are able to take enemy positions from sheer number. A professional army requires proper training, discipline, and more advance training."
 horse_upgrade_split_1_2:0 "Superiority in Numbers"
 horse_upgrade_split_1_2_desc:0 "No amount of training can defeat the sheer power of number and quantity. One hundred ponies is better than ten."
 horse_upgrade_2:0 "Onhooves Equipment Improvements II"
 horse_upgrade_2_desc:0 "We have gathered enough experience throughout the Equine equipments' service to figure out errors and flaws within their design, improving them even further."
 horse_upgrade_split_2_1:0 "Over the Hills and Far Away"
 horse_upgrade_split_2_1_desc:0 "Ponies are gifted with four hooves, that's two more than the humans have. With this advantage, it allows for easier traversal of harsh terrains such as in the mountains, where human batallions struggle to move through."
 horse_upgrade_split_2_2:0 "The Unstoppable Tide"
 horse_upgrade_split_2_2_desc:0 "We do not throw our ponies into the enemy lines. Instead, we tactically maneuver them so that they may quickly overrun enemy positions before they know what's coming."

 horse_tank_upgrade_1_2:0 "Engines of Magic"
 horse_tank_upgrade_1_2_desc:0 "Integrating magic into tank engines can allow our tanks to be much more effective and durable in combat compared to traditional engines."
 horse_tank_upgrade_2:0 "Crystal-Reinforced Armor"
 horse_tank_upgrade_2_desc:0 "Crystal is used at specific steps of the creation of tank armor, in conjonction with magic. This allows for a noticable reduction in the weight of the armor, all the while improving its performance against enemy fire."

 horse_pegasi_1:0 "Pegasi Flight Suit"
 horse_pegasi_1_desc:0 "Independent pegasi batallions will serve as shock-troops intended to lead assaults against enemy positions in hopes of overrunning them before they can form a proper defense. Entire divisions of them can move in speeds matched only by motorized troops. They are also effective at taking out enemy air support if present in the battle."
