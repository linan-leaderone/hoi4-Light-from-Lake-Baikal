 WAL_Welsh_CounterCulture: "Welsh Cultural Revolution"
 WAL_Welsh_CounterCulture_desc: "Ever since Wales fell to England, English culture and language has threatened to snuff out that of the Welshmen. Our unglamorous liberation has given the Welsh people an opportunity to reclaim what was once in danger of being lost. The Welsh tongue is once more being spoken beyond the meetings of fringe nationalist parties and in isolated villages, great works from all the earth are being translated into Welsh while poets and authors create new, original works in kind.\n\nThe Dragon, once thought dead or dying, now roars with a new life!"
 WAL_Free_Welsh_Army: "Free Wales Army"
 WAL_Free_Welsh_Army_desc: "For some, freedom alone is not enough. Operating outside of our control and beyond our reach is the Free Wales Army, a paramilitary force who has been no small source of trouble for both Wales and England. Beyond their rallies and marches- in which they espouse dangerous, anti-English sentiment that continually strain relations with our biggest trade partner- they have frequently attacked Englishmen both in Wales and along the border. We had hoped that appointing Cayo-Evans, with his connections to them, as our Defence Minister would calm their rage, but we have no idea how long the leash will hold..."

 WAL_ResFac: "Restarting the Factories"
 WAL_ResFac_desc: "The factories once shut down by our poor economy, and the jobs they produce, are now back up and running. The Y Mab Darogan has through his wisdom and will managed to achieve what every government prior has failed, and solidified the Welsh production centre solidly. The factories might not provide work for all the people of Wales but they will help us keep the loyalty of the urban majority, quite possibly our greatest potential threat at the moment with the Welsh speaking populace being confined mostly to the north and interior."
 WAL_RTP: "Reinforced Police"
 WAL_RTP_desc: "The police are well capable of handling ordinary dissent, but the Anglo populace are a terrifyingly devious band of ruffians. Protests will be large as they fool honest Welshmen into acting against their own interests, the solution to this is rather simple. Expand the police, fill their ranks with the loyal, or those who are at least competent, and crack down on the malicious. We can search for foreign infiltrators whilst we are at it, round up the more influential Anglo leaders with our loyalists in the police and imprison them for as long we need."
 WAL_StrictControl: "Economic Supervision"
 WAL_StrictControl_desc: "The economy is a machine, it ticks onwards constantly and with incredibly delicate instruments. A single spanner in the works could well leave the entire machine in jeopardy, a spanner like the Anglo population for instance. The government will have advisors in every factory, every business above a certain size, there will be no opportunity whatsoever for saboteurs or incompetence to deviate the machine of the economy away from its dedicated course. Naturally we will try to not be too intrusive, but omelettes and eggs and so on."
 WAL_CLA: "Celtic Liberation Army Member"
 WAL_CLA_desc: "The Celtic Liberation Army is despite being established in Wales a force for all the Celtic peoples of the world. Bretons, Scots, Manx, Irishmen and Welshmen all serve in one united force dedicated to the preservation of the unique Celtic cultures and their ways of life. Ironically despite many attempts the disparate nature of the organisation requires much of the communication to be done in English, something which is said to annoy the higher ranking members of the CLA to no end."
 WAL_WelshNatRevSupa: "Welsh National Revolution"
 WAL_WelshNatRevSupa_desc: "The Welsh National Revolution is one the finest brainchilds of Julian Cayo-Evans, the Y Mab Darogan. Based to some extent upon the socialist theories albeit purified for use in Wales, Cayo-Evans in his National Revolution has postulated that a constant revolution which evolves to face the challenges as they come is better than a defined period after which Anglo influences might creep back into society. Naturally this renders Wales somewhat unstable but it also makes them an oddly flexible power on matters of ideology."
 WAL_DeportAnglos: "Deporting the Anglos"
 WAL_DeportAnglos_desc: "The deportation of the Anglo populace that once resided in Wales is one of the final pieces of the Free Wales Army's National Revolution. The Anglo populations which were accounted for are rounded up and trucked enmasse to English border towns, usually with some of their belongings but not often a great number of them. The loot seized is granted to the state or, depending upon the nature of the confiscating officer in question, himself. Naturally there is a not insignificant amount of resistance to the deportations."
 WAL_ExpandFWA: "Expanding the Free Wales Army"
 WAL_ExpandFWA_desc: "The FWA is the backbone of the Welsh State under Julian Cayo-Evans, an ideological force equally as much as a purely security one. With a heavy degree of emphasis on superior soldiery to their likely English foes, the recent expansion of the FWA has only made it an even deadlier force. The new fighters in the FWA might not be as well trained or disciplined as those which came before but they more than make up for their deficiency in training with utter fanaticism."
 WAL_TWNA: "The Welsh National Assembly"
 WAL_TWNA_desc: "The Welsh National Assembly is to be the cornerstone of the new legislative process, taking a great deal of weight off of the position of Y Mab Darogan and transferring some of the formative legislative responsibilities to the Assembly as a whole. Naturally the Y Mab Darogan holds both veto and significant influence in the process of deciding the fine print of any passed laws but this is the closest to a representative organ that the Welsh people have had in some time. Even if Cayo-Evans does choose who sits in it."

 WAL_KeepBeckCold: "Kept Beckerle Cold"
 WAL_LuxEmb: "Luxurious Embassy"
 WAL_CayoCentralize: "Centralized Cayo's Power"
 WAL_CayoCentralize_desc: "The position of Y Mab Darogan is one of great responsibility, which is why only Julian Cayo-Evans can be allowed to have it. He has freed Wales from its shackles of Unionism and the Anglo traitors that use it as a shield, he has strengthened Wales by pruning away from it the weak links, the deceitful and the cowards. Some may call him a despot, but he is our despot if so. A man utterly dedicated to the future of his nation and the success of his people. A man dedicated to Wales, to victory, and to the National Revolution!"

 #Leader bios
 POLITICS_SAUNDERS_LEWIS_DESC: "There are many unlikely things that fit together. But what about a poetic politician, a dramatist clinging to power in an increasingly authoritarian state? Regardless of the irony one may find in this oxymoron, this is just what Saunders Lewis, the leader of the juvenile Welsh nation, embodies.\n\nAfter being wounded in combat during the First World War on the Western Front, Lewis lectured at Swansea. The trouble of Welsh independence led the Welshman and some of his associates to eventually found a nationalist political party, which later became known as the Plaid Cymru. Lewis, as the first party leader, was unable to garner much support with his reinvention of Welsh nationalism, having minor success only when he published new literary works. However, the Second World War came as a decisive turning point. As the Plaid Cymru promoted "service to the Welsh nation instead of to the British," the Germans found a convenient way to avoid occupying Wales in favor of concentrating the war effort on the Scottish campaign. Thus, Wales was given its independence, for the Germans' convenience first and foremost. The Plaid Cymru, meanwhile, accelerated its rise by being appointed the leading party of this new nation.\n\nHowever, many years have elapsed since Saunders Lewis's inauguration. The old man has lost all his zeal and vigor, and has retreated to the countryside to continue his literary work. Lewis's clique is thus forced to desperately cling to power via increasingly autocratic means. One may wonder how long they can hold on, though, as numerous factions emerge to fill the vacuum that Lewis's isolation has created."
 POLITICS_WELSH_ASSEMBLY_DESC: "When the independence of Wales was hoisted upon itself by the Reich, it needed a place to organise its government. The obvious answer was the former Cardiff Town Hall, a building of impressive stature and even more impressive architecture, as built in 1905 in the Edwardian Baroque style, covered in various statues of Welsh and British legends. Adjusting the city hall to fit the Assembly was not too difficult a task, as the room was slightly expanded to allow for more seats to fit the Assembly within. And here, in Cardiff's fifth town hall, sits a worried government, uncertain of its own future.\n\nWhen coal stocks began depleting, Prime Minister Lewis and his wing of Plaid Cymru saw the writing on the wall. But to get ahead, he threw everything he could to stop the public from discovering the little secret. Plaid fabricated as much as they could, burned as many records, destroyed as much as possible. But they got him eventually. As a vote of no confidence threw out Prime Minister Lewis, the government collapsed in on itself. At one point, a brawl erupted between two Plaid members, until it was broken up.\n\nNow, as factions duel, the future of the Welsh Government seems to be under contention, and Wales burns in the same fire that is draining the economic fuel it so dearly needs."
 POLITICS_JULIAN_CAYO-EVANS_DESC: "Some men's fathers drive them to change the world. Others have mothers who build them into warriors of compassion. Cayo-Evans, on the other hand, was driven into radical nationalism by his housekeeper. A Polish soldier in exile who felt the sting of Britain's abandonment, Yanick Helkzman taught Julian that a nation can rely on nobody but its native soldiers. Cayo was determined to be one of those soldiers, ready to join in the victorious struggle for a Free Wales. Unfortunately, Cayo learned that independence was just the first of many questions in need of answers.\n\nBefore helping establish the Free Wales Army, Cayo was rumored to have spent a year serving in Iberia's Guardia Civil, having grown increasingly infatuated with the independence and staunch nationalism he saw in Franco. Undeniably, the Cayo who founded the FWA was one significantly more aggressive in his hatred for not just communism, but parliamentary democracy itself. Such views, despite not being universal in the FWA, nonetheless gave him a strong support base, so strong that Saunders Lewis eventually viewed ignoring the man as dangerous. At the time, perhaps, Lewis believed Cayo could still be brought to heel, could be drawn to the rearguard of the Plaid parliament. Clearly, the vociferous criticisms Cayo's appointment faced were correct. As feared (or hoped for in some circles), he used the first chance he got to take the government at gunpoint. Now, the strongest opponent of Anglicization and Liberalism has seized power in the land of the dragon, thousands of hardened warriors at his beck and call."
 POLITICS_JOHN_MORRIS_DESC: "John Morris has always claimed to be pragmatic and apolitical. When the Welsh flag flew across the liberated land, Morris was in his study practicing for a legal exam. When a strike in his native Aberystwyth erupted to show solidarity with Northern coal miners, Morris simply drew his curtains and played a record. Unsurprisingly, his first entry into politics came not through collective action, but through a case he was assigned to.\n\nThis successful defence of a English immigrant accused of murder made national headlines, and led Morris to be courted by a small group of Anglophile politicians. Stewarding the "apolitical" man in ideas of free trade, deregulation, and internationalism, this Independent group basically wrote the entire campaign Morris ran for the Aberavon seat. In parliament, however, he quickly became convinced that the future greatness of Wales lied not with hollow liberalism, but the strong social democracies of yore. As it turned out, this strategy was a success, allowing Morris to pull in significant numbers of Cymru Goch members, much to Thomas' dismay. Finding himself a leader of this new Unionist party, Morris deftly maneuvered the various crises and scandals of the Lewis administration to aim directly for the Prime Minister's seat. With Goch essentially absorbed into the Unionist Party, Morris led his party to victory with him solidly at the helm. The once "apolitical" man is looking forward to a stable road towards a united, social-democratic Britain."
 POLITICS_EMRYS_THOMAS_DESC: "To say that Emrys Thomas is a man of the labour movement would be an understatement.\n\nHe was born into it, molded by it. Growing up in one of the coal centers of Wales and raised by parents active in the Independent Labour party his path as a socialist politician fighting for the working man of Wales was obvious in hindsight.\n\nThe school teacher would spend the first part of his political career working himself up to party representative of South Wales and advocating for conscious objectors during World War 2. The end of the war found Thomas seeing his homeland at last independent from the English yoke.\n\nAs London was stomped under the German boot, Thomas joined Saunders grand coalition in an effort to represent the interest of the miners and contain the unionist. That is until the Language bill blew everything apart.\n\nWith the Frankenstein government of Plaid Cymru now in the rear mirror, Thomas' victory will finally allow him to reform Wales into the democratic socialist nation he has always desired."

WAL_Free_Wales: "A Free Wales"
WAL_Free_Wales_desc: "Wales is a young nation, but it is also an old country. As such, it has the privilege of dealing with problems that commonly afflict nations both young and old, such as the wild and often misguided actions of our political fringe and extremist youths. But there are also those with an unfairly nostalgic view of the past- they call themselves Unionists, others call them traitors- and would see Wales return to a union with England and the rest of the Isles.\n\nThere is no man better equipped to handle this precarious situation than our own Saunders Lewis, and ever since he became our Prime Minister he has handled the problems with dignity and grace. But the wear and the tear is starting to show, and whether his patience or his health catches up with him first is yet to be seen. God willing, we should be able to resolve the looming crisis before then, because there's no telling if whoever comes next will have the ability to."
WAL_Open_The_Floor: "Opening Parliament"
WAL_Open_The_Floor_desc: "Parliament will soon be in session, though this time it's a good deal more controversial than it has been in the past. Aside from a number of significant pieces of legislature that will be presented to the Parliament when it opens, there's also the Annual Economic Assessment to consider. The Assessments manage to strike a delicate balance between incendiary and painfully dry, with the Plaid Cymru receiving a great deal of the frustration from years of middling-to-weak economic growth.\n\nRegardless, the show must go on, and a show this is expected to be. It seems like the parliament grows ever more stratified and less cooperative with every time it goes into session, and some are wondering if there's any hope that the parties emerge from this next one with national unity and cooperation in mind."
WAL_Annual_Economic_Assessment: "The Annual Economic Assessment"
WAL_Annual_Economic_Assessment_desc: "The time has come for the Annual Economic Assessment. Gywnfor Evans- presumably after not finding anyone willing to pass it onto- has the dubious honor of presenting the Assessment to all of the Parliament, and how they receive the news will determine the party's economic platform moving into the year coming up.\n\nThere are already whispers that the report carries a message that is far from positive. While there hasn't been any outright decline in overall prosperity, imports have increased dramatically while exports have fallen in kind. Inflation is also a looming threat over the country, as the drive to create a distinctly Welsh currency to replace the Pound may have been somewhat overzealous for as small a nation as Wales. The job of telling the increasingly dysfunctional parliament this is as unenviable as any."
WAL_Welfare_qn: "The Welfare Debate"
WAL_Welfare_qn_desc: "One of the most controversial topics emerging from the Assessment comes in the form of the welfare debate. Wales has a reasonably strong system of financial safety nets and government welfare, primarily supported by the social democrats within Plaid Cymru. After seeing the stagnation of the national budget, hardlining right-wingers with the Plaid Cymru have taken to roundly criticizing the programs and calling for austerity- or even abolishing the welfare state altogether.\n\nOn the other hand, the left wing of the party insists that when times get tough, it's the poor and the working class that bear the brunt of the weight. With solutions ranging from maintaining it to increasing their budgets, there has been a solid and cohesive defence of Welsh welfare in the face of this call against it."
WAL_Coal_qn: "The Coal Question"
WAL_Coal_qn_desc: "After the strained silence that the parliament held all throughout the Assessment, the time has come to develop a plan that can get the Welsh economy back on track. Something that the report stressed was that Wales as a nation is incredibly dependent on its coal exports. While this reliance doesn't seem to be a cause of the recent slowing of Welsh economic growth, there are those who think that this reliance makes the economy entirely too fragile. After all, should something happen to either disrupt Wales' ability to acquire its coal, or should coal fall even further out of international favor than it has already, the results would be devastating.\n\nThere are those who argue otherwise though. The fact that Wales lives and dies by its coal exports is not new information, and that there is nothing to fear from relying on coal. The argument goes that leaning so heavily on the export of coal gives Wales a kind of strength, not fragility, and ensures that they won't be investing in any overly optimistic or ambitious investments that could ruin them in turn..."
WAL_Workers_rights_qn: "The Rights of Workers"
WAL_Workers_rights_qn_desc: "Normally, when the rights of the working man comes to the attention of governments and legislatures, it comes from the working men themselves demanding better pay, shorter hours, or better working conditions. This time however, it's different. Wales' industry and market is relatively new- at least as its own rather than a subsidiary of a larger economy- and many small, new businesses are struggling to get on their feet.\n\nThey blame labour laws and regulations that were instated upon the founding of the Welsh nation. They argue that they won't be able to keep up with much larger and wealthy foreign nations, and that Welsh finance could perish in its infancy if there isn't action taken, and soon. They want a general rolling back of some regulations- primarily in terms of labor rights and safety regulations- in order to give Welsh companies a leg up. This of course, is a controversial suggestion in Parliament- unspeakable to the left faction of Plaid Cymru..."
WAL_off_with_the_chaff: "Scale It Down"
WAL_off_with_the_chaff_desc: "After what practically amounted to a small war in the parliament, the bruised egos and sullied prides finally gave way to a narrow victory in favor of austerity. While the resistance was spirited and prevented any sort of truly drastic measures from being taken, there are now plans to reduce government spending on its social programs.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to narrow their scope and availability. This will allow Wales to take of those truly in need while not wasting precious resources on those who can probably get by without it. The people will grumble if they must, but they'll have forgotten all about it in a few months' time, and we will reap the benefits."
WAL_Poverty_your_end_is_nye: "War on Poverty"
WAL_Poverty_your_end_is_nye_desc: "Parliament has, after a great deal of infighting and arguing, finally come to an agreement that leaves everyone in the building perfectly dissatisfied. The social democrats within the parliament managed to get their way, much to the chagrin of the hardliners within Plaid Cymru. Their victory resulted in a resolution to increase spending in order to expand the budget for Wales' various social programs and welfare benefits across the board. These programs have thus far been exceptionally popular, and the people themselves are more than happy to see their tax dollars going to projects like these.\n\nIt doesn't fix the problems previously stated though, and the increased spending still has its critics in parliament- they aren't exactly going to just lie down and shut up now that the battle was lost. It will be worth it to keep an eye on the nation's income and its debt in the coming years to see whether or not the resolution, as popular as it may be, is worth it."
WAL_All_in_on_coal: "All in on Coal"
WAL_All_in_on_coal_desc: "After fiery debate in parliament, a narrow victory has been achieved, adopting an official policy of going "all in" on the coal industry has won out. While there are concerns about the long-term benefits of this policy, they were largely dismissed when compared to the immediate and tangible benefits that Wales will reap with this policy. In the short term Wales will be able to meet ever-increasing demands for coal exports, allowing Wales to shore up its trade deficit and solve the problems that may arise as they come.\n\nThere's no point in planning for the future if your immediate present isn't secured, after all. Wales will show those naysayers that she is more resilient, as much in financial as she is in military and political strength. Coal is power!"
WAL_diversify_economy: "Diversify the Economy"
WAL_diversify_economy_desc: "After a long and drawn out debate, the faction of parliament in favor of diversification managed to win out and adopt their stance into official national policy. While it's clear that there's going to need to be some momentary sacrifices as government subsidization and sponsorship of coal mining is reduced to make way for other industries, it's pretty clear that the long term benefits will be worth the cost.\n\nThe math is simple, for while coal might work as the pillar of Welsh industry now, what might the situation look like in five years' time? Ten years? Twenty? Diversification will allow us to remain flexible and adjust as needed in order to keep pace with the world at large. Wales needs to keep with the times if she's to avoid becoming a total economic backwater."
WAL_expand_workers_rights: "A Workers' Rights Charter"
WAL_expand_workers_rights_desc: "When the businessmen approached Parliament to beg for the rolling back of regulations, they most certainly did not expect the Emyrs Thomas and his faction in the party to use it the way that they did. Rather than allowing doom and gloom of the hypothetical fate of these poor, poor businessmen and capitalists, the social democrats within the party controlled the flow of discussion, and turned it to pointing out the areas in which the current rights and regulations had blind spots or were not strictly defined enough.\n\nThe resulting resolution was the formation of a new Workers' Rights Charter, the exact opposite of the original intent. The charter contains a comprehensive and modernized set of legal and regulatory codes that will make the rights of the Welsh worker clear and easily understood."
WAL_deregulation: "Remove Red Tape"
WAL_deregulation_desc: "As unfortunate as it might be, the men of commerce do have a point. How can any Welsh business keep up with an American or even an Irish business when they've had decades to establish themselves, whereas the Welsh business only had a matter of years? They have the advantage in resources, in established wealth, and in simple momentum, while the Welsh have nothing in comparison. Welsh businesses need an edge if they're going to be able to compete.\n\nWhen Wales has had a long and successful history of commerce and trade, and our companies and corporations are sitting upon an established, we can think about reinstating those protections. But for now, the unrestrained and unregulated growth will allow those small companies that head start they need, and while the unions may rattle sabers and bang pots together in protest, but they will just need to adjust to the reality of things until such a time that we'll be able to accommodate their desires again."
WAL_address_the_unions: "Address the Unions"
WAL_address_the_unions_desc: "Being such a small nation with such a large portion of our citizens in heavy labor work, it only makes sense that the local unions wield a much greater deal of power here than it does in other nations. This has been to the benefit of their workers, but it makes half of the parliament nervous, especially when we pass- or even consider- legislation that the unions may not be in favor of. As such, it's common practice to hold a meeting with the unions following a session of parliament, just to be sure.\n\nThis time, the address will be pretty important, given that we passed multiple, very significant pieces of legislation one after the other. It's time to see if the unions are happy with the changes we've made, or if we have earned their ire and will need to find a way to make it up to them, someway, somehow."
WAL_will_our_finances_be_okay: "Long-Term Economics"
WAL_will_our_finances_be_okay_desc: "Even as the fate of Wales seems more and more incumbent on rancorous parliamentary debates, a good deal of Lewis' policies are still prepped in back rooms. And as he grows older by the day, he may have less and less of a say in what said policies are. Roderic Bowen and Gwynfor Evans, two chief architects of the Welsh economy, have been drafting up discussions to have with PM Lewis. Beyond the public, short-term view of the Assessment, the two men seem to be aiming for a "pragmatic" and stable road to economic growth, the kind that can last for decades. Should the present problems be transcended, these talks will hopefully be remembered as key to a continuously stable Wales."
WAL_military_funding: "Military Funding"
WAL_military_funding_desc: "While largely undiscussed in the Annual Assessment, the question of military spending deserves to be examined, if not for budgetary concerns than simply to appease Julian Cayo-Evans, always loudly using apocalyptic rhetoric to demand a stronger army. The facts must come before this charged rhetoric, for our brave men are not to be used as pawns in some political game.\n\nLoyal, well-armed, and well-trained, our military nevertheless has gaps. Corruption is rife, and could be solved (depending on who you ask) with more money for better pay, or cuts and investigations to reduce public money in their hands. Such is the general theme of this debate all problems related to the military will be solved by either cutting or boosting its budget, but what are the problems our military exists to solve? To defeat the English? To be a last line of defence in worst-case scenarios? Or perhaps they are the problem, as some leftists and Unionists argue."
WAL_talks_with_the_FWA: "Hold Talks with the Free Wales Army"
WAL_talks_with_the_FWA_desc: "It's time for a talk. The Free Wales Army seems to grow ever more brazen by the day, and innocents are both their targets and are getting caught in the crossfire. This is not just horrific in its own right, but it's an affront to the rule of law and our own ability to keep the peace in Wales. Their constant targeting of Englishmen within our borders and without threatens our peace with our neighbors, and it will forever hold back Wales if we don't do something about it.\n\nTo just attack them would lead to open rebellion, and we can hardly afford that when our nation's existence is as of yet, so new. We are unfortunately in no position to make demands either, so we're going to need to negotiate with them. Underneath a banner of truce, we will find out what they want, and what we can offer to get them to stop their military buildup, and to stop their attacks. Evidently, Cayo's appointment wasn't enough, what more could these ingrates want?"
WAL_talks_with_soc_militias: "Hold Talks with the Militant Socialists"
WAL_talks_with_soc_militias_desc: "It would seem as though our problems with unruly paramilitaries doesn't end with the Free Wales Army. Recently, there has been an increasingly radicalizing group within our labor force who have adopted various tenets of socialism and are growing increasingly violent as time goes on. If we don't step down to their level and have a conversation, this could get very bloody, very fast.\n\nThe groups are scattered, unorganized, and the movement itself is so intensely grassroots that it's difficult to even find central leaders with whom to talk with. Thankfully, through the cooperation of the unions, we've been able to identify some useful surrogates who have a pretty good pulse on the overall hopes and feelings of this rising militant population. Let's just hope that they can be reasonable and we can come to an accord without any outbreak of violence."
WAL_do_jack: "Wait for All of This to Blow Over"
WAL_do_jack_desc: "The presence of both Emrys Thomas and Julian Cayo-Evans in our cabinet means that any direct action taken against their preferred radicals will alienate them, leading our government to divide and collapse. Party advisors are saying that continuing on a tightrope will only embolden extremists on the ground, but they clearly have never had to sit in a cabinet meeting with both a leftist and a staunch nationalist.\n\nIt is disheartening to hear of things like militant strike waves, aggressive demonstrations, or lynchings in Northern villages. But anger and hatred is like a stick of dynamite, burning and causing damage only temporarily before burning out for good. The efforts of Saunders Lewis and his cabinet to help the Welsh nation are self-evident. A sensible middle ground exists in the vast majority of our citizens, and radical tactics will only further alienate the FWA and the socialists from these moderates. We are a democracy, after all. There is no place for petty score-settling directed by our government. Whatever happens, our brave law enforcement are surely competent enough to deal with the situation. The center will hold, we just won't be enforcing it by the barrel of a gun."
WAL_crackdown_on_FWA: "Arrest Cayo's Men"
WAL_crackdown_on_FWA_desc: "More than anything, the Free Wales Army is a nationalistic, militaristic blight on our new nation. So as long as we have to tolerate them in our borders, we cannot pretend to be the arbiters of peace and security in our own nation. It's clear that the simple appointment of Julian Cayo-Evans was not enough to keep them in line, so we're going to need to take more drastic measures to curb these terrorists' influence.\n\nSaunders Lewis has prepared an order to police forces all over Wales, complete with a list of suspected and confirmed Free Welsh hideouts, strongholds, and supply depots. A long string of arrests will follow, and after gutting both their ability to organize and crippling their manpower, the Free Welsh will fade into the margins of history books.\n\nWith this order, we can, in one evening, all at once, break the strength of the Free Welsh and secure ourselves as the sole authority in Wales. No doubt, Cayo-Evans will rant and rage about this action, but without the force of an army at his back, what could he do to us?"
WAL_crackdown_on_soc_militias: "Disperse Thomas's Rioters"
WAL_crackdown_on_soc_militias_desc: "The radical socialists from within the working class of Wales are a different kind of beast entirely, as compared to the Free Wales Army. While the Free Welsh might be rabid dogs, they are chained rabid dogs, so as long as Julian Cayo-Evans is in our cabinet to make sure that the leash is in fact, held. The socialists on the other hand, are entirely unfettered, unbound, and free to cause havoc, should they gain the strength to do so. This cannot stand.\n\nDealing with this issue should also help keep the Free Welsh in line, as Julian Cayo-Evans was the first to suggest using police forces to disperse the socialists rioting. Emrys Thomas is threatening drastic political action if we go through with this plan, but Cayo-Evans in turn assures us that such threats are simple bluster, and that he can do little and less if his precious rioters were to be scattered to the wind. We hope he's right."
WAL_education_reforms: "Educational Matters"
WAL_education_reforms_desc: "Out of all of the duties and responsibilities of a nation, the one we have neglected most in the early life of our nation has been educating the youth. At the time, it was understandable that we'd want to work to first establish a parliament, police forces, armed forces, and regulations on businesses and unions. But now we have established ourselves, and we need to revisit our scattered, inconsistent national education system.\n\nSome localities and provinces are simply handling education themselves, with a smattering of private schools in some of the richer regions of Wales complicating the picture even more. The simple disorganization has caused problems, with educational standards in one part of Wales exceeding or being drastically beneath that of another part of Wales. We need to start coralling these local public schools and private institutions and start installing some kind of regulations, or even state control of these institutions, if necessary."
WAL_next_gen_teachers: "The Next Generation of Teachers"
WAL_next_gen_teachers_desc: "We have something of a unique problem. While we are in the midst of reforming and organizing our education system, we have run into the issue of our educators. The vast majority of them are English- many of whom are exiles from the collaborationist regime in England- and they are often very old besides. Most of them are set in their ways, and if we are going to breathe new life into Welsh education, we need to first inject fresh blood into the educational staff.\n\nThey need to be Welsh-born, or at least well-assimilated, and similarly need to be well-versed in the Welsh tongue. We can start up a training and teaching program, recruiting many of those old English professors and teachers to pass on the torch to the next generation of Welsh educators, and in turn, be integral in the birth of a new educational tradition in the nation of Wales itself, one that should guarantee the lasting impact and strength of our culture."
WAL_lessons_from_chubut: "Lessons From Chubut"
WAL_lessons_from_chubut_desc: "Welsh, as a language, is going stronger than it has since the High Middle Ages. However, the language isn't really the same language that we spoke back then either, as centuries of English domination has introduced a lot of English into the language that would otherwise not be there. But this isn't the case for everywhere Welsh is spoken, because it has come to our attention that in the most unlikely of places... Argentina.\n\nGaiman, Trelew, and Trevelin are Welsh-descended villages in the Chubut Province of Argentina and the last remnants of Y Wladychfa Gymreig. Unlike Wales, they have not experienced centuries of English control, and they have not been under as firm supervision of the Spanish-speaking Argentine government as we were underneath the English. We should send some scholars to Argentina to study the language, how it differs from our own, and figure out how they managed to preserve the tongue so effectively in spite of the intervening centuries."
WAL_standardized_testing: "National Grading"
WAL_standardized_testing_desc: "With our control over the public education system and our influence in the private schools secured, the last remaining incoherency in the Welsh educational system is how we grade students. There are a few different ideas that different provinces and schools have introduced, but it seems as though everyone agrees that we just need to stick with one, as the confusion has brought region and time of education into question for colleges and employers alike.\n\nThe process is simple, we'll just take the different ideas, everything from percentile grading, to grading on a 20, to grading on a 100, to pass and fail versus letter grading, and determine which serves Wales the best. Every version has its supporters, but is surprisingly non-partisan in who supports which."
WAL_A_Bright_Future: "A Bright Future"
WAL_A_Bright_Future_desc: "Wales was not a nation born in glorious revolution or mighty conquest, but by accident for all intents and purposes. The nation that Saunders Lewis inherited was factitious, with violent revolution and aggrieved paramilitaries threatening her very existence. It was a nation with a fragile, small, and weak economy, a suspect military, a fractured parliament, and no international standing. By all accounts, Wales should not stand today, and yet here we are. By all accounts, the Welsh tongue and culture should be dead, and yet here we are. By all accounts, Wales should be a puppet of a foreign power, or a rump state otherwise, and yet here we stand.\n\nSaunders Lewis was not the kind of man that would normally have statues made of him, but he has proven to be exactly the unifying figure that this young nation needed. Through his leadership and decisive action, Wales has weathered the storm and defied all expectations. Though we do not know what the future will bring, the citizens of the newly reformed and rejuvenated Wales can rest easy knowing that we have proven our ability to stand tall and proud amidst tribulation."

 ##COAL CRISIS##
 ######################

WAL_Mine_Rumors: "Rumours from the Mines"
WAL_Mine_Rumors_desc: "From the depths of the coal mines, several worrying rumors have surfaced. The miners claim that the coal in some mines is starting to run out after years of intensive mining. If these reports turn out to be true they will forecast an end of the coal industry and a greater impending disaster.\n\nA collapse of coal could cause a chain reaction which would have devastating consequences, including the collapse of the Welsh economy. We must hope for the sake of our government and the people of Wales that this can be avoided."
WAL_Coal_Investigation: "Investigate the Mines"
WAL_Coal_Investigation_desc: "With the rise of the recent news from the mines, we must investigate for ourselves. Put simply the government just wishes not to believe the miners. These rumors are preposterous, but, if true, the situation that would follow would be very serious indeed.\n\nSo we shall see for ourselves the validity of their claims, we will suspend our disbelief and start an investigation. Soon these fears will be put to an end and we can move on with more important matters. Surely the miners cannot be right."
WAL_Cover_Up: "Cover Up the Findings"
WAL_Cover_Up_desc: "Plaid Cymru has many opponents, who would be keen to destabilize our government through any way they can. If they were to learn of the findings of our investigation they would publish it in every paper, broadcast to every radio and sow discontent throughout Wales. Which would lead to considerable hostility towards our party amongst the people.\n\nA large scale cover up will have to be undertaken to prevent this. The media must not find out. They will not undermine us."
WAL_Burn_The_Report: "Burn the Report"
WAL_Burn_The_Report_desc: "We were wrong.\n\nThe situation is worse than we could have possibly imagined. The investigation has started to send back reports that confirm all of the miners' suspicions, we are running out of coal. If the reports were to spread, confidence in the government would dissolve, guaranteeing the end of our leadership of Wales. We must not and will not allow this.\n\nEvery single report from the mines will be disposed of promptly. Reduced to ashes, never to be brought to the public."
WAL_Falsify_The_Statistics: "Falsify Statistics"
WAL_Falsify_The_Statistics_desc: "Having learned of our misunderstanding of the circumstances we will have to prevent too many people learning of the extent of this disastrous situation. The numbers themselves are damning enough to endanger our position in parliament. They will have to be changed.\n\nOrders will be given to start altering the statistics coming from the mines. Perhaps we can keep Plaid in power and end this before it spreads too far."
WAL_Buy_Silence: "Buy Silence"
WAL_Buy_Silence_desc: "To avoid the chance that the discovery in the coal mines might spread, we will have to contain the knowledge of its existence. Bonuses are to be offered to the miners who uncovered the shortage, so long as they keep their mouths shut. The bosses of the mines will also receive an incentive to stay silent. Every single one of them, miner and owners alike, will have their silence bought.\n\nThey must understand why they ought to stay quiet. We will have to trust them or else face our ruin."
WAL_its_all_Coming_Together: "The American Way"
WAL_its_all_Coming_Together_desc: "Our situation has started to mirror the events that took place in the United States of America. After the realisation of the potential consequences of a coal shortage we did what was necessary. The threat of the media and our other opponents forced us to take matters into our own hands. We will deny everything and hide what we can from them.\n\nIf it is good enough for President Nixon it is good enough for us. We did nothing wrong and nothing will go wrong."
WAL_Keep_Calm_and_Carry_on: "Keep Calm and Carry On"
WAL_Keep_Calm_and_Carry_on_desc: "After all our efforts it seems the worst of our fears have passed. Finally we can start to turn our attention away from coal and onto more ordinary matters.\n\nElsewhere others carry on free of the knowledge we have kept from them. Miners have returned to the depths, journalists remain unaware and the rest of the public is none the wiser of the catastrophe that we have avoided.\n\nLife has continued and all is calm."

WAL_Out_of_the_frying_pan_and_in_to_the_fire_desc: "Having to receive the news of the dwindling production of coal was bad, the ensuing cover up was rough as well. Chaos took hold over the government, as smoke rose from fires that were fueled by the reports, whose number had already been overstated. Silence was bought, every miner was eyed with suspicion.\n\nYet it has still gotten worse.\n\nSomehow the reports have been leaked, soon all of Wales will know of the impending coal catastrophe and, more worryingly, the extent of our cover up. Our efforts have failed, may we be spared and allowed to survive what is to come."
WAL_Whitewash_Saunders: "Whitewash Saunders"
WAL_Whitewash_Saunders_desc: "Our party has already started to be embroiled in the political disaster that has followed the leak of one of our documents. If we are to find a way to survive we must find a way to downplay Saunders' role in the coverup. It is the only conceivable way to restore any form of public trust in Plaid.\n\nThe Prime Minister will be put through a blitz of talks with the press in order to gloss over any part that he may or may not have played in the crisis. With Saunders out of the turmoil we can start to hope that one day the people of Wales will forgive the rest of the party."
WAL_Accuse_Thomas: "Accuse Thomas"
WAL_Accuse_Thomas_desc: "Emrys Thomas has long been an accomplished minister of our party, he has been an ever greater friend to many of our members. But for the sake of the party that he has loved and helped build he will have to lower his head.\n\nThis is a sacrifice no one in the government wishes to force Thomas to make, yet it will be necessary to prevent pinning the blame on any other faction and causing more political turmoil. So we will regrettably have to accuse Thomas of the cover up to try and save the parties chances of clinging on to power."
WAL_Implicate_Evans: "Implicate Evans"
WAL_Implicate_Evans_desc: "Evans and the other socialist in the government are to blame for the crisis which they have exacerbated. We will reveal to the people that it was in fact Evans and his lackeys within the trade unions that tried to cover up the fact that the coal mines of Wales were depleted.\n\nImplicating Evans into the cover up will help clear the other members of our party that were involved. We risk exacerbating the crisis with more political infighting, but it is a risk we will have to take to survive."
WAL_blame_the_Cayo_Clique: "Blame the Cayo Clique"
WAL_blame_the_Cayo_Clique_desc: "A crisis as severe as this could have only been aggravated by a band of destructive agitators. Cayo and the rest of his clique would make the perfect culprits for the scandal. They are already known to be potential troublemakers, trying to weaken the government through creating such an emergency would not seem too far fetched.\n\nCayo will have the blame affixed to him, thus preserving what remains of the public's confidence in our party."
WAL_Answer_to_the_assembly: "Answer to the Assembly"
WAL_Answer_to_the_assembly_desc: "As the crisis has gone on our position within the Assembly has deteriorated, all of our former allies have stabbed us in the back, leaving us politically isolated. It will soon be impossible for us to continue leading Wales.\n\nWe are obliged to answer to the Assembly and its ministers. They will be told of the situation and the events that followed. The fate of our government will soon be decided by the rest of the Assembly."
WAL_Answer_to_the_Public: "Answer to the Public"
WAL_Answer_to_the_Public_desc: "No matter how hard we might try we will simply never be able shift all of the blame from our party. As this crisis and its subsequent cover up happened on our watch we will be the ones that will have to answer to the public.\n\nIt will not be easy. Much embarrassment is certain to be caused as a result of the questioning but we must try to make up for the faults of the past, in the hopes of satisfying the people. Maybe there is a chance that we can still claw back some credibility."
WAL_Vote_Of_No_Confidence: "A Vote of No Confidence"
WAL_Vote_Of_No_Confidence_desc: "We have failed Wales.\n\nOur efforts to appease the public have seen limited success at best and the Assembly has united against us. There is only so long that we can carry on in this position, soon we will have to swallow our pride and face a vote of no confidence. A vote few expect us to survive. Nevertheless we will have to allow ourselves to be held accountable.\n\nWe will have to hope that the people of Wales will be more forgiving."
WAL_Back_To_Business: "Back to Business"
WAL_Back_To_Business_desc: "Plaid has done it again! We have yet again managed to overcome what seemed to be an unimaginable obstacle. Many days and weeks have passed since we found out about the shortage of coal and still there are no reports to be seen.\n\nTo the public the coal crisis simply does not exist.\n\nNow that everything is dealt with, Wales is back. We can return to business as usual and continue leading Wales towards its future."

 ##GOCH VICTORY FOCUS##
 ######################
 
 WAL_Goch1_Goch_Victory: "Goch Victory!"
 WAL_Goch1_Goch_Victory_desc: "The workers of Wales have spoken, and their wish is clear - idealism, socialism, democracy! The uncaring and distant capitalists of Plaid Cymru and the Unionist Tory traitors have lost their sway, their lies and corruption exposed for all to see. Cymru Goch, once but a splinter faction of the Plaid, has now been entrusted with a goal most noble - restoration of the Welshmen's faith in their own government and the establishment of democratic socialism in Wales!"
 WAL_Goch1_Political_Reform: "Political Reform"
 WAL_Goch1_Political_Reform_desc: "The previous government's administration has left behind a legacy of authoritarianism and repression - things we cannot, and will not, tolerate. Sweeping reforms in the political sphere are required in order to ensure the stability and prosperity of our Republic."
 WAL_Goch1_Promote_Welsh_Democracy: "A Fair Democracy"
 WAL_Goch1_Promote_Welsh_Democracy_desc: "Our young nation was built on the virtues of democracy and political plurality, virtues that are worth protecting. While we do not agree with the capitalists, reactionaries and unionists that exist in our society, they are still citizens of Wales, members of our democratic society. Our common values must be promoted and protected."
 WAL_Goch1_Keep_The_Scum_Out: "Keep the Scum Out"
 WAL_Goch1_Keep_The_Scum_Out_desc: "There are some, however, who do not respect our democratic way of governance, and would seek to destroy and replace it with a dictatorship. These dangerous organizations and people, however fringe in their beliefs, cannot be tolerated. While some will cry and moan about the supposed "breach of free speech and assembly laws" they will, in time, understand our decision."
 WAL_Goch1_Endorse_Leftist_Parties: "Endorse Leftist Parties"
 WAL_Goch1_Endorse_Leftist_Parties_desc: "Great injustices were made in previous years concerning the treatment of our fellow socialists and other leftists, all in the name of "ensuring stability" and "fighting the red menace". These explanations are ridiculous, of course, and are simply excuses for the power-hungry oligarchs to silence their enemies. Now, as the tables have turned, so has the government's stance towards leftism. Our comrades must be supported and endorsed, so that the workers have their representation in politics!"
 WAL_Goch1_Deal_With_Julians_Fanatics: "Deal with Julian's Fanatics"
 WAL_Goch1_Deal_With_Julians_Fanatics_desc: "Cayo-Evans and his band of fanatic terrorists are the greatest internal danger to our democracy, eclipsed only by the accursed fascists surrounding us. They must be dealt with quickly and decisively lest they try to oppose us directly."
 WAL_Goch1_Media_Representation: "Media Representation"
 WAL_Goch1_Media_Representation_desc: "The media in our country were always loyal to the establishment, protecting and downplaying the failures of Plaid Cymru. This cannot continue. Pluralism in the media must be guaranteed and other parties must be allowed to be in the spotlight. The old guard won't be too keen on this idea, however, and problems are almost guaranteed to arise."
 WAL_Goch1_Civic_Nationalism: "Civic Nationalism"
 WAL_Goch1_Civic_Nationalism_desc: "The newly-achieved independence of our country has led to a drastic increase of ethnic nationalism, most visibly expressed in the form of the Free Wales Army. While we love our land and treasure its independence, we believe that it belongs to all of our countrymen, not just those who are ethnically and linguistically Welsh. Love for Wales must be based on a set of shared values and loyalty to our democratic institutions, not blind ethnonationalism."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Democracy: "Welsh Democracy"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Democracy_desc: "Our political reforms have paid off! Welsh democracy is stronger and healthier than ever before, pluralism and freedom are legally guaranteed and defended, and political discourse is remarkably and surprisingly civil. Our work is not done yet, however! The questions of the economy and society remain."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Gears_Of_Change: "The Gears of Change"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Gears_Of_Change_desc: "For hundreds of years, Wales was a relative backwater in the economical sphere. Great progress was made during the industrial revolution, but the cost of said progress was great - the common worker was left mostly destitute, and although the situation improved near the turn of the century, Plaid Cymru's capitalist ways have kept the people of Wales from achieving true prosperity. Not anymore. The workers will be protected, and Wales will prosper."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Resources: "Welsh Resources"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Resources_desc: "Our land is blessed with bountiful quantities of various resources, many of which are the mainstays of an industrialized economy. Extraction of these resources gives our nation a position otherwise impossible to achieve for a country of our size, but there are many deposits which have not been touched by human hands. Finally extracting these riches will help our economy immensely."
 WAL_Goch1_Heavy_Industry: "Heavy Industry"
 WAL_Goch1_Heavy_Industry_desc: "Rapid industrialization in the 19th and early 20th centuries led to a population boom and a staggering increase in wealth, but it was distributed unequally, and many regions of Wales, especially in the northern and eastern reaches of the country are predominantly rural and poor. Establishing new industrial centers will help realize our true potential."
 WAL_Goch1_Digging_Out_More_Coal: "Digging Out More Coal"
 WAL_Goch1_Digging_Out_More_Coal_desc: "Coal is Wales's life and death, a source of employment for many, and a cause of death for many others, be it from the pollution it produces or calamities like the Aberfan Disaster. As much as we would prefer to use cleaner and more efficient resources, it is the most economically viable right now, and if we wish to expand the economy, we have to expand the coal mines as well. Proper health and safety regulation should take care of most of the risks, shouldn't it? Who knows, maybe someday we'll have better alternatives..."
 WAL_Goch1_Bigger_Steelmills: "Bigger Steelmills"
 WAL_Goch1_Bigger_Steelmills_desc: "Steel is arguably the most important resource in the world, used for everything from kitchen utensils through buildings up to tanks, cars and aeroplanes. Thankfully, our rich coal and iron reserves allow us to produce great quantities of it. All we need now is an expansion of our existing and the building of new steel mills."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Welsh_Stamp_Of_Approval: "The Welsh Stamp of Approval"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Welsh_Stamp_Of_Approval_desc: "Since we lack the cheap workforce and sheer size of countries such as Germany or the USA, we cannot prioritize quantity over quality. Instead, we must focus on producing only the finest of goods and materials in order to secure a spot in the international market - and for that, we need strict quality assurance."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Welfare: "Welsh Welfare"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Welfare_desc: "The trap which many capitalist economies fall into is one of growth for the sake of growth, economic progress benefiting only the strong and rich while leaving behind the toilers who make said progress possible. This happened in Wales too, but it will continue no longer. Better wages, regulations and improved working conditions will make for just recompense for the hard work of our people."
 WAL_Goch1_Reverse_Previous_Restrictions: "Reverse Previous Restrictions"
 WAL_Goch1_Reverse_Previous_Restrictions_desc: "The Plaid Cymru was founded on the noble ideas of democracy and freedom for the people of Wales, but they failed to uphold them after we regained our long-awaited independence. Their ways became more and more authoritarian, and plain disregard for the will and desires of the people could be seen. Restrictions were placed upon Welsh political life, ones that spit in the face of the ideals upon which our nation was founded. They must be reversed, so that freedom, true freedom, may return to Wales."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Broadcasting_Channel: "Welsh Broadcasting Channel"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Broadcasting_Channel_desc: "The modern inventions of television and radio have a relatively small community of users in our country, with newspapers being the primary source of news for the common Welshman. Many people, however, have no *good* source of news, relying on sensationalized tabloid-like publications. To remedy this, we need to create a state-owned, free-to-air broadcasting channel, filled with only the freshest news and best entertainment."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Workers_Protection_Bill: "Welsh Workers' Protection Bill"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Workers_Protection_Bill_desc: "Our government has, after many discussions, consultations and opinion surveys drafted the Welsh Workers' Protection Bill, which will guarantee and expand the rights and privileges of the working class of Wales. While an official proposition of the WWPB is sure to start a lively debate in the Assembly and attract criticism from the Plaid Cymru, it simply must be done, for it will serve as a major step-stone in the struggle for workers' rights in Wales."
 WAL_Goch1_Ending_Working_Toil: "Ending Working Toil"
 WAL_Goch1_Ending_Working_Toil_desc: "Previous Labour Commission reports, especially during the Plaid Cymru's period of dominance, have painted a grim picture of Welsh working conditions. Labourers were found to be suffering from back pain, light and heavy injuries and other physical ailments caused by overworking and insufficient safety regulations, not to mention the psychological effects of toxic and unsafe working environments. This year will see another report being submitted to the government - may it be the best one yet."
 WAL_Goch1_Wonder_Working_Wales: "Wonder-Working Wales"
 WAL_Goch1_Wonder_Working_Wales_desc: "Our economy is stronger than ever! Production is skyrocketing, new businesses are opening everywhere, our population is increasing... and all without any crony capitalism! The people are wealthy and happy, slowly forgetting about the tribulations of years past. Already, a new nickname has stuck to our country, and is gaining more and more popularity around the world - Wonder Working Wales!"
 WAL_Goch1_A_New_Face_To_The_World: "A New Face to the World"
 WAL_Goch1_A_New_Face_To_The_World_desc: "Wales, for nearly all of its history, has been a politically insignificant nation. Subjugated by the Romans and later by the Britons, our standing in politics has been one of a vassal, always at a disadvantage. Even after the restoration of our independence following the Second World War, our status was low, and no measures were taken to change that. Now, however, with the situation at home getting better and better every single day, we can turn our gaze outwards and use our domestic successes to achieve our goals in the field of international politics."
 WAL_Goch1_Keeping_Halder_Content: "Keeping Halder Content"
 WAL_Goch1_Keeping_Halder_Content_desc: "After the shameful defeat Great Britain suffered at the hands of Nazi Germany, the accursed fascists installed a military garrison in Cornwall in order to better oversee the situation in their rotting puppet, the Kingdom of England. While we hold nothing but contempt for the fascist murderers and oppressors and would like to see their complete removal from the Isles, considering the circumstances, we must abide by the principles of Realpolitik. A diplomatic mission must be sent to the garrison commander, Franz Halder, to ensure him of our good intentions towards Germany. A lie, of course, but a necessary one."
 WAL_Goch1_Ignore_Scottish_Complaints: "Ignore Scottish Complaints"
 WAL_Goch1_Ignore_Scottish_Complaints_desc: "As expected, the Scots aren't too thrilled about us reaffirming our relations with Germany. Their government has issued an official diplomatic protest against our actions, barely stopping short of calling us fascist collaborators. As much as we regret having to make that decision, we stand by it, and for that, the protest must be ignored. Sometimes, silence is the better option."
 WAL_Goch1_Throw_Out_Local_Complaints: "Throw Out Local Complaints"
 WAL_Goch1_Throw_Out_Local_Complaints_desc: "An even worse situation has arisen. Although we could simply ignore the Scots, we cannot ignore the cries and criticisms of our people, especially if they are morally justified. Sadly, there is no place for morals in dealing with the Germans, and our citizens must accept that fact.\n\nKeep the repression minimal."
 WAL_Goch1_Antagonize_The_English: "Antagonize the English"
 WAL_Goch1_Antagonize_The_English_desc: "The English to the East have long oppressed our nation, conquering and exploiting it for their own imperialist gains. Their mismanagement and ill will have cost us much and kept us behind in development - in all spheres. There can be no friendship between us."
 WAL_Goch1_Across_The_Irish_Sea: "Across the Irish Sea"
 WAL_Goch1_Across_The_Irish_Sea_desc: "Ireland, our Celtic brother-nation, has experienced a story much like our own - one of subjugation, mistreatment and oppression at the hands of the dastardly English. Now, it presents a golden opportunity - trade and cooperation across the sea! International friendship and cold, hard capital await!"
 WAL_Goch1_Our_Trade_Partner: "Our Trade Partner"
 WAL_Goch1_Our_Trade_Partner_desc: "Germany is a monster devouring Europe and leaving it to rot in its innards, the antithesis to all we hold dear and sacred... and yet, we find ourselves at its mercy. The German economy, however weakened, is a behemoth towering over us, one which could squash us beneath its feet if it wanted to. The only reasonable course of action at the moment is economical cooperation and appeasement, lest we find ourselves fighting a financial war we cannot win."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Dragon_Emerges: "The Dragon Emerges"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Dragon_Emerges_desc: "With renewing, improving and strengthening our international relations in the region we have secured a safe, solid place for Wales on the political scene. New friends were made, threats neutralized and attitudes clarified. We no longer have to fear for what tomorrow may bring, for only an unprecedented cataclysm could shake up the accords and treaties signed!"
 WAL_Goch1_Cymru_Am_Byth: "Cymru Am Byth"
 WAL_Goch1_Cymru_Am_Byth_desc: "Our time as the government of Wales will be forever remembered as one of the bright points in our nation's history! The people are wealthier, happier and safer than ever, our economy is booming, our international position is safe and secure, and our democracy serves as a beacon of hope on a continent strangleheld by fascism! The proud people of Cymru have shown their mettle once again and proven that nothing can break the spirits of Welshmen!\n\nCymru am Byth!"
 WAL_Goch1_Look_At_Coal: "A Second Look At Coal"
 WAL_Goch1_Look_At_Coal_desc: "Our coal reserve is the most important feature of our economy and one of the few reasons for our economic significance. In past years, its extraction was performed without regard for the health and wellbeing of our workers and environment. Now, however, we must take a second look at the issue in order to guarantee ethical and sustainable coal extraction."
 WAL_Goch1_Above_the_Hills: "Above the Hills"
 WAL_Goch1_Above_the_Hills_desc: "The working conditions of miners have gone a long way from the frequent cave-ins, explosions, overworking and injuries characteristic of the 19th century, but they are still quite poor. As part of the Coal Plan, we have drafted a massive campaign of reform across the mining sector, improving safety, pay, efficiency, and access to medical care. Implementing these ideas will not be cheap, quick or easy, but the long-term benefits will be immense."
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_the_Unions: "Convincing the Unions"
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_the_Unions_desc: "Our government has long supported the trade unions of our country, increasing their rights and privileges in accordance to our sincerest beliefs. Through these efforts, we have built up significant goodwill with them, and now is the time to capitalize on it. What good is our Coal Plan if the workers do not consent?"
 WAL_Goch1_Offer_More_Steel: "Offering More Steelworks"
 WAL_Goch1_Offer_More_Steel_desc: "Despite our radical improvement of safety in the mining sector, coal mines continue to be dangerous (mostly due to coalbed methane) and taxing working environments, both physically and mentally. In order to provide employment for workers unsuitable for mining and increase steel production, the Ministry of Economy has prepared a steelworks expansion plan, the main objective of which is the building of new steel mills and the modernization and expansion of existing ones. All we need now is a green light from the Prime Minister."
 WAL_Goch1_No_Worker_Suffer: "No Worker Will Suffer"
 WAL_Goch1_No_Worker_Suffer_desc: "The struggle for better working conditions never ends. Great strides have been made during our term, but there is still a lot of room for improvement, namely - the expansion of welfare and improved safety regulations. We progress more and more towards the establishment of a Welsh Safety Net!"
 WAL_Goch1_Increasing_Taxes: "Increasing Taxes"
 WAL_Goch1_Increasing_Taxes_desc: "As expected, our reforms have put a strain on our budget, and we are getting dangerously close to insolvency. This situation has laid bare the insufficiency of our current tax rates and shown us the necessity of increasing them. Such an action will hurt our people, especially those of the upper class, but in time they will understand that a society of solidarity requires sacrifices."
 WAL_Goch1_Sheep: "Sheep in the Valleys"
 WAL_Goch1_Sheep_desc: "As a party of urban workers, we have focused our platform on the betterment of their situation. The attention we gave to the industrialized and mining-dependent regions of our country has sadly marginalized our agricultural sector and alienated many farmers. Such a move was a terrible mistake, one we must - and will - remedy."
 WAL_Goch1_Forgotten_Regions: "Focus on Forgotten Regions"
 WAL_Goch1_Forgotten_Regions_desc: "Our country, although small, sports disparities in development reminiscent of far larger nations. Many regions lag behind, mostly due to governmental failures. We must shift our focus to these regions, directing both public and private investment and building up infrastructure."
 WAL_Goch1_Agriculture_Exports: "Agricultural Exports"
 WAL_Goch1_Agriculture_Exports_desc: "Our agricultural output has increased to the point of a surplus! Money from exporting this surplus is already filling our coffers, money we can invest into further developing our country. The economy has been successfully diversified, and we are no longer totally dependent on coal and steel!"
 WAL_Goch1_Sustainable_Economy: "A Sustainable Economy"
 WAL_Goch1_Sustainable_Economy_desc: "No longer are we at the mercy of mining! While far from total autarky, our economy is now strong enough to stand at its own feet, with exports steadily increasing and imports of basic goods dropping dramatically. There is still a lot to be done, but what we have created has grown to be a diverse, strong, and healthy economy."
 WAL_Goch1_Assuage_Union_Fears: "Assuage Union Fears"
 WAL_Goch1_Assuage_Union_Fears_desc: "The Aberfan Disaster traumatized our nation and prejudiced it against coal mining, and the unions are no exception. Memory of the innocents who perished that terrible morning still burns bright in the memory of unionized workers, and a lot of work will be required to calm their fears of another Aberfan - work we are willing to do."
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_Parliament: "Convincing Parliament"
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_Parliament_desc: "With the workers on our side, all that is left now is persuading the Assembly to support our plan. Easier said than done. While we can (mostly) count on the votes of the left, the Plaid Cymru is likely to oppose us. However, we are certain that they will fold, in time. Nobody wants to be remembered as "the man who brought about the second Aberfan" after all."
 WAL_Goch1_Threaten_Nonbelievers: "Threaten the Non-Believers"
 WAL_Goch1_Threaten_Nonbelievers_desc: "It seems the task at hand is too difficult to complete through diplomacy alone, for some of our party members have broken ranks and are planning to vote against our Plan. They have their reasons, no doubt, but we cannot tolerate such dissident behavior in the Cymru Goch, not when so much is at stake. We will give them a simple choice - vote in accordance with party lines, or say goodbye to their posts."
 WAL_Goch1_No_Voice_Behind: "No Voice Left Behind"
 WAL_Goch1_No_Voice_Behind_desc: "While we could threaten the dissidents to bring them back behind party lines by force, such a solution would be undemocratic and counterproductive. Instead, we should start a unity campaign, calling for all Welsh patriots in the Assembly to support the Plan. This would not only spare us from in-party conflict, but also build long-lasting parliamentary support."
 WAL_Goch1_A_United_Left: "A United Left?"
 WAL_Goch1_A_United_Left_desc: "For the first time in Welsh history, the parliamentary left is strong and united! Our representatives, supported by smaller leftist groups, have achieved a majority strong enough to pass the Coal Plan and secure a future of safe, sustainable coal mining in Wales!"
 WAL_Goch1_Preparing_Election: "Preparing for the Election"
 WAL_Goch1_Preparing_Election_desc: "With the economical campaign over, the political campaign begins. The tools of this trade aren't hammers and sickles, but posters and leaflets. The workplaces are not factories and farms, but party offices, meeting halls, and the streets themselves! Let every Welshman know what the government has done for him!"
 WAL_Goch1_Restore_Diplomatic_Reputation: "Restoring Our Diplomatic Reputation"
 WAL_Goch1_Restore_Diplomatic_Reputation_desc: "Ever since our independence, we were alone, closed off from allies, surrounded by wolves waiting for a moment of weakness. We kept to ourselves, and expected others to follow suit. This is no way to conduct a modern diplomatic policy! We must reach out to our neighbors and potential friends from across the sea, lest we die alone and forgotten."
 WAL_Goch1_Looking_Overseas: "Looking Overseas"
 WAL_Goch1_Looking_Overseas_desc: "The lands overseas house some of the last holdouts of freedom and democracy in the world. Waiting, gathering their strength, they look for opportunities to strike against fascism. That is how they're portrayed in OFN propaganda, at least. We have no delusions, we know that life in the "Free World" isn't free of discrimination, poverty or violence - but we have no one else to turn to."
 WAL_Goch1_Remembering_Empire: "Remembering the Empire"
 WAL_Goch1_Remembering_Empire_desc: "What has the Empire ever done for us? All it has done is exploit our people, all in the name of a monarch descendant from the royals of old who led their armies against us. Now, however, with the Empire gone, we can establish diplomatic relations with its former dominions - this time, as equals."
 WAL_Goch1_USA_Mission: "A Mission to the USA"
 WAL_Goch1_USA_Mission_desc: "Ever since the Second World War, the United States have taken upon itself the mantle of the leader of the Free World. It is a peculiar Free World, especially considering the discrimination of blacks or their support for terrorists and authoritarians, but their commitment to fighting fascism is unquestionable. Cordial diplomatic relations with the world's most powerful democracy would serve us well."
 WAL_Goch1_USA_Weapons: "Request American Gun Designs"
 WAL_Goch1_USA_Weapons_desc: "The ever-expanding American military-industrial complex, despite its liking for proxy wars and overpriced products, does produce some of the finest military equipment in the world. Using our newly-acquired goodwill with the Americans, we could request the transfer of some of their designs to use for domestic production. None of it will be cutting-edge, but it might be useful for upgrading our ageing equipment."
 WAL_Goch1_On_The_Isles: "On the Isles"
 WAL_Goch1_On_The_Isles_desc: "The most important step is interacting with those the closest to us, for they may be our best allies - or our worst foes. We cannot know which are which unless we establish relations with them."
 WAL_Goch1_Talks_With_Scotland: "Talks with Scotland"
 WAL_Goch1_Talks_With_Scotland_desc: "Scotland is our brother, a beacon of democracy on an island drowned in fascism. We share common interests, namely - defence against the Germans and the British and the preservation of democracy, which should make negotiations easy.\n\nShould."
 WAL_Goch1_Talks_With_Ireland: "Talks with Ireland"
 WAL_Goch1_Talks_With_Ireland_desc: "Ireland, a fellow Celtic nation, has long suffered under the yoke of the British. Partnership with us is in their best interest. Sadly, their past association with the Germans and the Fianna Fáil's similarity to the Plaid Cymru may cast a shadow on negotiations.\n\nMay."
 WAL_Goch1_Watching_Border: "Watching the Border"
 WAL_Goch1_Watching_Border_desc: "The English have emerged from their Civil War a stronger nation, and it would be foolish to assume their stance towards us is anything but hostile. It would seem that imperialist habits die hard, and yet another subjugation would be disastrous to our people. A surprise attack would spell the end of our independence. We must watch the Marches."
 WAL_Goch1_Preparing_Worst: "Preparing for the Worst"
 WAL_Goch1_Preparing_Worst_desc: "Relations have been secured, our army improved with the help of the Americans, and the Marches garrisoned. We will never be entirely ready for what is to come, but extensive preparation just might save us. When the Englishmen come, they will be in for an unpleasant surprise.\n\nMen of Harlech, stand ye steady!"

 WAL_Union1_Unionism_Secured: "Unionism Secured"
 WAL_Union1_Unionism_Secured_desc: "The election results have been counted and the Unionists stand triumphant! We have the backing of the Welsh people and they are clear that they want our government to return them to a union with England.\n\nBut before we can begin to strive towards our main goal, we will have to address the public that allowed us to be in this position in the first place. Morris himself will take charge of the preparations for his inauguration speech, he will have to make the right impression.\n\nThere is a lot that depends on him keeping the situation stable and there are many that would like to disrupt him."
 WAL_Union1_ReBranding_The_Welsh_Economy: "Re-Branding the Welsh Economy"
 WAL_Union1_ReBranding_The_Welsh_Economy_desc: "If Wales is known for anything outside of its borders, it would be known for its coal industry, which it has grown increasingly reliant on. After the revelations that the past nationalist government failed to hide, everyone in Wales now knows that it would be impossible to continue this way.\n\nA new economy will have to be created, one that does not rely on the extraction of coal, it will have to be a priority as the lives of many ex-miners are only getting worse. We will have to act before it is too late to salvage anything."
 WAL_Union1_Focus_On_Factories: "Focus on Factories"
 WAL_Union1_Focus_On_Factories_desc: "As part of our early efforts to reinvigorate the Welsh economy, it has been decided that a greater capacity of heavy industry will be needed to manufacture bigger and better products. More factories are to be constructed in certain towns and cities to reinforce what little exists of our current industrial base.\n\nThere is no limit to the amount of labor that will be on offer to these factories. Ex-miners need the work and they will be well suited to some of the more physically demanding aspects of factory work. They ought to get back to work quickly before we can no longer help them."
 WAL_Union1_Stop_Resource_Reliance: "Stop Resource Reliance"
 WAL_Union1_Stop_Resource_Reliance_desc: "Even though it has been known that there is a critical shortage of coal for some time, exports of Welsh coal have continued to leave the country. Of course this cannot be allowed to continue, that coal is needed to fuel our factories and not the engines of the highest foreign bidder.\n\nRemoving the financial incentive to overexploit what remains of coal reserves will also help to extend what limited time we have to act before it all completely dries up."
 WAL_Union1_Save_The_Coal_Industry: "Save the Coal Industry?"
 WAL_Union1_Save_The_Coal_Industry_desc: "The Unionists may have been elected under the pretense that they were united under the aim of English reunification, but underneath the surface there are divisions over the economic direction of Wales. These disputes are unlikely to cause a serious split in the party but a consensus will still have to be reached within the government.\n\nOn one end, the Labourists want most of what remains of the coal industry running, in spite of the cost, to reassure the miners. On the other is the conservative wing of the party that would much prefer to leave the mines to their fate"
 WAL_Union1_Shake_It_Up_A_Bit: "Shake it Up a Bit"
 WAL_Union1_Shake_It_Up_A_Bit_desc: "With large scale coal production out of the picture, the government will have to start diversifying the Welsh economy. Making sure that the new economy is sufficiently varied will prevent a crisis as bad as the one we are still embroiled in from occuring again. It would also help us to stave off some of the worst of the economic collapse that we are trying to avoid.\n\nThe nation's reliance on coal will have to be ended for it to thrive."
 WAL_Union1_Industrial_Might: "Industrial Might"
 WAL_Union1_Industrial_Might_desc: "Our economy has already started to show signs of improvement, mainly due to our new and increasingly effective stewardship. Expanding diversification has already started to see new enterprises cropping up across Wales, industry has improved as well and our increased support is paying off.\n\nOur industry is growing in strength, we must make sure that it does not go to waste."
 WAL_Union1_Legalizing_Unionism: "The Unionist State"
 WAL_Union1_Legalizing_Unionism_desc: "To properly begin our progress towards reunification we will have to update our flag, which has become far too ingrained in the nationalist movements for us to consider using. The addition of the Union Flag to the top canton will do perfectly.\n\nThe new design may rile up some of the more fervent nationalists, but we are in government, the people want unification. And after our announcement later today will make it clear that that is exactly what we will deliver them."
 WAL_Union1_Defund_Welsh_Cultural_Studies: "Defund Welsh Cultural Studies"
 WAL_Union1_Defund_Welsh_Cultural_Studies_desc: "Before it became infamous for its part in the coal crisis, the government that ran Wales before us was renowned for the resurgence of Welsh culture that it had created. It funded expensive new cultural institutes that brought Welsh culture to the forefront of people's lives. Of course this is not in keeping with our own ambitions and so something will have to be done about them.\n\nCutting of their funding will force them to limit their operations and allow us to take their place and guide the Welsh people away from nationalism."
 WAL_Union1_Bash_Welsh_Nationalism: "Bash Welsh Nationalism"
 WAL_Union1_Bash_Welsh_Nationalism_desc: "Nationalism is a scourge we will have to confront. Its roots have burrowed deeper into the minds of the Welsh people, now that we have taken control we can start to persuade them that such ideas are unfounded and are likely harmful.\n\nIf the protests that have raged outside the Assembly have told us one thing it is that nationalism will have to be permanently discredited before we can truly move safely onwards.\n\nNew articles will be printed and more broadcast will be aired, publicizing the benefits of a closer relationship with England."
 WAL_Union1_Reinstate_English_As_The_Official_Language: "Reinstate English as the Official Language"
 WAL_Union1_Reinstate_English_As_The_Official_Language_desc: "English has always been the predominant language of Wales, however, as the nationalists like to remind everyone, they do have their own language. They even went as far as to introduce a bill that tried to make Welsh the only language taught in our schools.\n\nBut it is still rarely used compared to English, reinstating English as the official language of Wales will help prevent the spread of the Welsh language. It would also align us closer to England."
 WAL_Union1_Glorify_English_Heroes: "Glorify English Heroes"
 WAL_Union1_Glorify_English_Heroes_desc: "Our previous campaign to detract from the nationalist movement has seen some success, the people are starting to move their support away from the more fanatical nationalist movements. But these same people remain reluctant to embrace the idea that the relationship between Wales and England was beneficial. Fortunately we can shed light on how great an advantage it truly was to be a part of the union.\n\nWe will restore the heroes of England back to their former glory."
 WAL_Union1_Praise_The_Act_Of_Union_Of_1542: "Praise the Acts of Union"
 WAL_Union1_Praise_The_Act_Of_Union_Of_1542_desc: "Across Wales Unionist rallies have begun to appear and they are growing in size as more people are convinced of the advantages of reunification. Morris has determined that it would be beneficial to attend one of these rallies to demonstrate that he has the support of the people. He plans on giving an impassioned speech on the Unionist cause, focusing specifically on the great achievement that was the Acts of Union."
 WAL_Union1_Eyes_On_The_Military: "Eyes On the Military"
 WAL_Union1_Eyes_On_The_Military_desc: "The Welsh military has been known to harbor some of the most devout members of the nationalist cause. Who are made all the more ominous because of their access and experience with some of the most dangerous weapons in Wales.\n\nWe must not risk losing what the Welsh people have voted for to some radical madmen. Any nationalist elements that still lurk within our army will need to be removed. The sooner these problematic fanatics are dealt with, the better."
 WAL_Union1_A_Purge: "A Purge"
 WAL_Union1_A_Purge_desc: "Allowing any potential nationalists to remain within our army is too great a risk to allow. If they were to remain within the military, they could easily undermine the elected government. A purge of sorts has already begun to be prepared. The government will have to order the military to remove any man suspected of being a nationalist officer.\n\nAn expulsion of this size will limit the capability of our army somewhat, but at least we can be sure that the soldiers that are left will be led by officers loyal to our Unionist cause."
 WAL_Union1_Smoke_Out_FWA_Sympathizers: "Smoke Out FWA Sympathizers"
 WAL_Union1_Smoke_Out_FWA_Sympathizers_desc: "As part of our efforts to clear out all nationalist fanatics within the army, we have started to suspect that some parts of the military sympathise with the Free Wales Army.\n\nIt is an organization that the government does not know all that much about, but from what we have learnt, it may have the potential to threaten our authority. The FWA is believed to include the most militant nationalist in Wales. And like any other nationalist threat to our government, it must be removed."
 WAL_Union1_Loyalty_Achieved: "Loyalty Achieved"
 WAL_Union1_Loyalty_Achieved_desc: "It appears that the army has become suitably ridden of the nationalist scourge. The army has been brought to heel, any nationalist sympathisers are widely believed to have been purged from our ranks. Our efforts to cleanse the military have been successful and the government has finally started to feel comfortable with the army.\n\nWe have achieved to gain the army's loyalty and avoided having to yield to any of their demands. Now that the old nationalists are gone we can begin to look towards England and the future we will have when we are partnered with it."
 WAL_Union1_A_Compromise: "A Compromise"
 WAL_Union1_A_Compromise_desc: "Although the nationalists are still a danger to our government, we could not possibly risk a purge. There would be too high a chance of greater tension between the army and the government. Some form of a compromise will have to be found instead of letting any nationalist officers remain a threat.\n\nIdeas to appease them have been thought of from pay rises to allowing the Welsh language to be spoken, but most Unionists want any agreement to be more beneficial to us than them. Whatever we do it will be a lot easier than a large-scale expulsion."
 WAL_Union1_Pardon_Nationalist_Soldiers: "Pardon Nationalist Soldiers"
 WAL_Union1_Pardon_Nationalist_Soldiers_desc: "The government knows of the large number of nationalists that exist within the army's ranks, having determined to not to have them removed we will have to excuse them of their role in the nationalist movements. Allowing these officers to stay may be a risk, as they could influence other soldiers if they retain their posts. However it will have to be done to reduce any underlying tensions.\n\nHopefully they decide to serve us and not the nationalist cause they were a part of before."
 WAL_Union1_Loyalty_Earned: "Loyalty Earned"
 WAL_Union1_Loyalty_Earned_desc: "Loyalty to the government has not been imposed, instead we have earned it. Coming to terms with the army has enabled us to settle the differences we had with some of the more headstrong nationalists.\n\nWhat we have achieved is much more stable than the purge that could have been. We knew that we could never have completely removed all of the nationalists from the army. Compromising with them has made it clear to the people that we intend to keep Wales undivided as we head towards unification with England."
 WAL_Union1_Rework_The_Welsh_Education_System: "Re-Work the Welsh Education System"
 WAL_Union1_Rework_The_Welsh_Education_System_desc: "English may have changed to the official language but that does not mean that Welsh schools have immediately followed our lead. Because of past laws implemented by the nationalists, studies of Welsh history and literature have remained mandatory in many schools. This is not very consistent with our push towards spreading English culture, these old laws will have to be removed. Wales no longer wishes to be independent and these classes a remnant of the past that will have to be reworked or replaced."
 WAL_Union1_Mandatory_English_Classes: "Mandatory English Classes"
 WAL_Union1_Mandatory_English_Classes_desc: "As a part of our rework of the outdated nationalist education system, mandatory English lessons are to be put into effect. Since English has become the official language of the country it is a necessary step in order to enforce this law.\n\nEvery school will teach English and every pupil will learn English. The government expects that there will be no excuse to not be able to speak the true language of Wales."
 WAL_Union1_Minimize_Welsh_History: "Minimize Welsh History"
 WAL_Union1_Minimize_Welsh_History_desc: "A major part of the nationalist education system was the Welsh academy that educated many of Wales' most talented students. The academy taught its pupils about the history of Wales, with a focus on the time before Wales was united with England.\n\nOur government will correct this, undermining the institution wherever it can to reduce interest in Welsh history."
 WAL_Union1_Focus_On_Academics: "Focus on Academics"
 WAL_Union1_Focus_On_Academics_desc: "The government is to commission a new set of history textbooks, textbooks that will be significantly different to the ones issued by the nationalist government. As we are the ones printing them now, we will have to decide the contents of the books.\n\nInstead of concentrating on the time when Wales was independent of England, as the nationalists did, we will make an effort to portray Wales as an integral part of Britain. Which, as a matter of act, it is.\n\nWe will not actively try to undermine Welsh history, but we will have to undermine it."
 WAL_Union1_Students_Of_England: "Students of England"
 WAL_Union1_Students_Of_England_desc: "If we are to effectively teach the new history program we ought to increase the budget of our education system as a whole. Many services were underfunded by the nationalists, with education being one of the institutions worst affected. Fixing this by increasing the funding will help the quality to dramatically increase.\n\nWhat is taught by the Welsh schools may have been altered quite a bit. However, most students will just be thankful to be taught properly again."
 WAL_Union1_Look_Towards_England: "Look Towards England"
 WAL_Union1_Look_Towards_England_desc: "Following the collapse of the disastrous nationalist government, that was headed by the disgraced Plaid Cymru, an election was called.\n\nAn election we were destined to win.\n\nThe Welsh people spoke and they demanded unification with England. Now that we have successfully dealt with the nationalist presence that lingered after the vote, we can approach the English and begin to move towards reintegrating ourselves into England."
 WAL_Union1_A_Spectre_Over_London: "The Red Flag In the East"
 WAL_Union1_A_Spectre_Over_London_desc: "After the chaos of the English Civil War and the hurried election that followed, the dust has finally settled and socialism has emerged triumphant in the east.\n\nAt long last the moment for unification will soon be upon us. The process will commence shortly, no nationalists will stop us now, reunion with England is inevitable. There is still some work to be done before our principal goal is achieved and Wales is returned to where it has always belonged."
 WAL_Union1_Limited_Integration: "A Common Enemy"
 WAL_Union1_Limited_Integration_desc: "With unification right around the corner, there is no need for Wales to have such a large and unsustainable army. We will disband several battalions and militias as we will have to start demilitarizing Welsh society. It is not necessary for us to field an army of our own, especially when the English are perfectly capable of defending both our interests."
 WAL_Union1_Two_Systems_One_Country: "And a Faithful Ally"
 WAL_Union1_Two_Systems_One_Country_desc: "England is the best ally that Wales could possibly have.\n\nTheir military might and cultural likeness make them the ideal friend to the Welsh people. As we have cut our army down to size, the English will have to take our old army's place in defending Wales from foreign threats. Our two nations are like brothers; we must respect them as they respect us, because with them by our side we are safe."
 WAL_Union1_Anti_Communist_Crackdown: "Anti-Fascist Action"
 WAL_Union1_Anti_Communist_Crackdown_desc: "The last remaining pockets of right wing radical resistance need to be crushed, one last round of raids ought to dislodge them for good. Once the last of their members have been captured, they will be rounded up and suitably dealt with; we can not allow their vile nationalism to reemerge ever again.\n\nIt is high time for these fascists to learn that there is no place for their harmful beliefs in Wales anymore."
 WAL_Union1_Expand_Workers_Rights: "Teach Socialist History"
 WAL_Union1_Expand_Workers_Rights_desc: "Too many recent generations of students have grown up surrounded by nationalist ideals and history. All of this must be corrected so that every Welsh student will understand the truth about socialism and how it will benefit both the English and the Welsh. The next generations will not suffer from the mistakes of our past, Unionism and socialism will prevail."
 WAL_Union1_The_Bastion_Of_Liberalism: "Scare Away Big Mine Owners"
 WAL_Union1_The_Bastion_Of_Liberalism_desc: "For too long greedy mine owners have exploited our hard working coal miners.\n\nIf we are to strive toward equality these fat cats can not be allowed to keep their undeserved jobs. Control of this vital part of our economy must be given to the workers immediately, the rest will be soon to follow."
 WAL_Union1_The_economy_of_the_workers: "The Economy of the Workers"
 WAL_Union1_The_economy_of_the_workers_desc: "Having wrestled control of the mines from the old owners and given them to the miners, we will move on and liberate the rest of our economy. It will be placed in the hands of the many workers, they will have more power to decide their own financial future. Our workers will be made free of the oppressive capitalists who used them in the past."

 WAL_Union1_Invite_them_to_Wrexham_desc: "Our preparations are now all complete, Wales is completely ready for reunification with England. The English will be invited to Wrexham where we can make the reunification of our two people official.\n\nFinally, the Unionists are triumphant and the nationalists have been defeated once and for all. We will return Wales back to where it belongs, let us hope that our new socialist future will be a bright one."
 WAL_Union1_The_English_Regime_Continues: "The Government Stands"
 WAL_Union1_The_English_Regime_Continues_desc: "Despite our past hopes for a freer England to triumph, it appears that the old English government has remained in control of their country. Frustratingly little seems to have come of the conflict, many Unionists within the government have in fact become rather disappointed with this result. However the ECW is now over and both sides will soon be ready to begin the process of unification."
 WAL_Union1_An_Autonomous_Wales: "Destroy Fortifications"
 WAL_Union1_An_Autonomous_Wales_desc: "During the early stages of the nationalist governments rule, extensive fortifications were built along the border with England. It was seen as a necessary precaution to keep the English and the Germans out of Wales; but it will no longer be required.\n\nThe forts will be torn down and the guard disarmed and dismissed. We should be reaching out to our neighbour, not blocking them out."
 WAL_Union1_King_Edward_Of_Wales: "An Army of Peace"
 WAL_Union1_King_Edward_Of_Wales_desc: "Due to our increasing reliance on the English, the existence of our army has become redundant, as a result most of our soldiers are to be demobilized. They will have to find some other duties to attend to as they are no longer required to defend Wales. Besides, ensuring a smooth transition to England is much more important than the wishes of those who have served to prevent it."
 WAL_Union1_Queen_Elizabeth_Of_Wales: "Remember Why We Are Here"
 WAL_Union1_Queen_Elizabeth_Of_Wales_desc: "We must not forget that above all we are the party of reunification. The people voted for us to tackle this task and even though the circumstances have changed, we will still have to fulfil our promise.\n\nThe situation in England may not be what we wished for, but it is better for us to bite the bullet and join them than backtrack on what the Welsh people elected our government to do."
 WAL_Union1_Calm_The_Concerned: "Invite the Monarchy Back"
 WAL_Union1_Calm_The_Concerned_desc: "If we are to reunite with England our government will have to invite their King to take back control of Wales. After the English crown has returned, the monarchy will rule over the Welsh people once again.\n\nThus the Welsh Republic will be brought to an end and our land will be pushed closer into the English fold."
 WAL_Union1_Ensure_Welsh_Democracy: "Remember Our Miners"
 WAL_Union1_Ensure_Welsh_Democracy_desc: "As things stand, Wales does not have much to offer the English.\n\nIn order to change this, the government has come up with a plan to invest heavily into our coal mines. We will produce vast quantities of coal as a result, however it is unlikely that we will be allowed to use much of the coal that we mine. Maybe if we can provide enough of this vital resource for the English, then they will make us an important part of the country."
 WAL_Union1_For_what_its_worth: "For What It's Worth"
 WAL_Union1_For_what_its_worth_desc: "Companies from across the present border are eager to access the Welsh economy with their cheap goods. Flooding Welsh markets with English produce will certainly please those who will soon govern over us, but it will leave behind many smaller Welsh businesses who will never stand a chance of competing against the English.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that we do this because we prioritise the future prosperity of Wales and the strength of the union above all other things."
 WAL_Union1_Invite_them_to_Wrexham_collab: "Invite Them to Wrexham"
 WAL_Union1_Invite_them_to_Wrexham_collab_desc: "Unification with England is, as of this moment, all but official. All that there is left for us to do is invite the English to Wrexham and make our union a reality once again.\n\nDoubts have started to form in even the minds of the most devoted unionists, but everyone in Wales knows that it is too late to turn back now. The Republic is well and truly dead, all that we can do now is hope that the future is not as dark as the nationalists would like is to believe."
 WAL_Union1_A_Return_To_England: "A Light that Shines Bright"
 WAL_Union1_A_Return_To_England_desc: "The English Civil War has come to an end and a Conservatism has arisen from the collapse. Led by the Second World War hero George Jellicoe, he and his party, the NDL, are set out to be a pragmatic force that will likely be very welcoming to the idea of Welsh reunification.\n\nDemocracy has returned to England and Wales will soon follow; there is no doubt that England will be much better off as a result of having both."
 WAL_Union1_Send_Envoys: "Taking the Guns and Granades"
 WAL_Union1_Send_Envoys_desc: "Guarding the English border was a serious duty when the nationalists were in government, it was seen as a necessary precaution against any Nazi incursions into our independent republic. Militias, armed and with eyes trained on the border remained ready, day and night, to fend off any foreigners.\n\nHowever, the England that we border now is vastly different to the one we neighboured back then. Therefore, the militia's weapons will have to be confiscated and they will be relieved of their duties."
 WAL_Union1_Integrate_Our_Economies: "A front against tyrants"
 WAL_Union1_Integrate_Our_Economies_desc: "Many within the army have seen the rise of the NDL in England as an opportunity for both our armies to stand side by side, facing off against the tyrants of the world.\n\nThe government sees no reason to dampen their hopes of such a future, after all we are the part of unity. We shall encourage this belief, and maybe one day we will become a bastion of freedom, fending off the foreign oppressors who dare to try and subdue us."
 WAL_Union1_Merge_The_Militaries: "Democracy lives"
 WAL_Union1_Merge_The_Militaries_desc: "After the fall of England to the German Reich, democracy was believed to have been defeated, never to see the light of day from under the German boot. However, after years of German oppression and a bloody civil war; the English have seized their freedom back.\n\nAll of the Welsh people and their government are overjoyed by this outcome, making it one of the rare causes for celebration in what was an ever gloomier world."
 WAL_Union1_A_Day_To_Celebrate: "Invite their Leader to give a Speech"
 WAL_Union1_A_Day_To_Celebrate_desc: "Jellicoe has proven himself to be an amiable person and a popular Prime Minister of England. A public appearance from him alongside John Morris in our capital would certainly help change the minds of the last stubborn nationalists in Wales.\n\nSuch a display of unity will secure support for reunification and give us the confidence we need to end the Republic and guide ourselves into the welcoming arms of the English."
 WAL_Union1_Invest_in_weapon_production: "Invest in Weapon production"
 WAL_Union1_Invest_in_weapon_production_desc: "When our nation is united with our neighbour, we will need more guns to help defend us from any forein invaders who would rather we stayed separate. Expanding Welsh weapon manufacturing will help us to keep the soon to be united armies of England and Wales to be supplied with enough guns to defend our countries.\n\nThe unionist government may not be around much longer, but it will still do all it can to make sure Wales will be safe."
 WAL_Union1_Invest_in_wales: "Invest in Wales"
 WAL_Union1_Invest_in_wales_desc: "Wales has always struggled economically, an over reliance on coal and the disastrous results we already know that it brings have left us quite poor. However, the vast wealth of English enterprise poses a promising solution to our financial woes. We will encourage as many English companies as we can to invest in Wales; the benefits will be bountiful."

 WAL_Cayo_Cayos_Coup: "Cayo's Coup"
 WAL_Cayo_Cayos_Coup_desc: "Betrayed. Divided. Surrounded. This was the predicament our country found itself in as the traitorous parliament absolutely failed to care for the average Welshman. Those fools thought they could simply go teetering along as "their" nation burned. They thought they could remove their leader and chop off any semblance of direction remaining. In short, those Anglophiles and communists thought there would be no consequences for their dereliction of duty. All they ended up doing was waking the dragon.\n\nWith the politicians rounded up and the FWA awaiting orders from Prime Minister Cayo, the ground is prepared for a cultural offensive against Anglicization in all its nefarious forms. All that's left is for our new leader to notify all people, from the ports of Cardiff to the quietest northern villages, that they all have a role in this historic battle for the very fabric of the Welsh nation."
 WAL_Cayo_Crush_The_Splitters: "Crush the Splitters"
 WAL_Cayo_Crush_The_Splitters_desc: "There is no room in this great country for those who adhere to ideologies placed above the well-being of Wales. Cymru Goch and their false religion of socialism must be burnt away if we are to develop a culture of nation above all, which they clearly stand against. The once-might unity of Plaid Cymru was forever shattered by their self-righteous breakaway, dividing them right at this nation's most critical juncture. Undoubtedly, their arrogance was key to the damage wrought by the Coal Crisis, as they damaged not just the government but sowed chaos through their support of strikers. In this new Wales, we neither forget nor forgive."
 WAL_Cayo_Split_The_Unionists: "Split the Unionists"
 WAL_Cayo_Split_The_Unionists_desc: "They know what is coming. Those we did not immediately deal with as we storm the Senedd fled to the dark crevices in which they reside. These traitorous creatures are the so-called "Unionists".\n\nThe steps taken against them must be forceful and decisive, lest their disease of the mind continues to infect once-decent Welshmen. From the pubs of Cardiff to the smallest dance halls in the northern villages, we must ensure that any suspected Unionist is reported to the authorities, so that we may reinstill within them the true values of Wales. For the few foolish enough to continue resistance against this surging tide, our most loyal soldiers await within newly established detention centers.\n\nIn decades, when our freedom is untouchable and we stand as a shining beacon of what a truly proud nation can achieve, the poisonous beliefs of the Unionists will be historical footnotes. To the children learning of their crimes in school, the idea that any politician ever tried to make us bow before England once more will appear not just reprehensible, but incomprehensible."
 WAL_Cayo_Purge_The_Plaid: "Purge Plaid"
 WAL_Cayo_Purge_The_Plaid_desc: "The record must show that Saunders Lewis is a national hero who helped create one Wales, united and free. However, it would be wholly ignorant, perhaps borderline seditious, to claim that Plaid Cymru never wavered in its commitment to Welsh freedom. Though not entirely Lewis' fault, he clearly has failed to prevent liberals and Anglophiles from infiltrating the party. Their day of judgement, finally, has come.\n\nEven the lowliest field offices of Plaid find themselves occupied by weak-willed traitors to the cause of national sovereignty. These party members do not have to be purged, if they immediately swear themselves to carrying out Cayo's program. Those still clinging to English liberal thought, of course, have no place in a proud society, let alone its guiding party. Various leaders of these sects with Plaid have already been...marked.\n\nWhile some fifth-columnists are rumored to have called our plan a way of weakening a precarious position, they are simply fearful of what is coming their way. Yes, Plaid will be disorganized in some areas for a brief period, but this will simply mean that truer defenders of Wales, ones not incumbent on suited bureaucrats to carry out their will, can implement Cayo's program. The age of debates and acquiescence, an age of lambs, shall come to end. Plaid Cymru's ruins will be built up into a fortress for this age of wolves."

 WAL_Cayo_Martial_Law_desc: "It would seem that suspending democracy hasn't been so well received by the populace. If we are to properly run the country drastic measures will need to be taken.

Unfortunately, not all of this nation is truly patriotic. There is a fifth column in our midst, one that bears a foul and traitorous flag. These are the Anglos, the loyalists of the old regime. We must do away with them if we are to make any progress.\n\nThis process will be twofold: undoing the slave mentality their lies have imposed upon our once indomitable culture, and removing any ability of theirs to poison the Welsh mind. No more shall our children be taught by limp-wristed cowards, no more shall our workers be betrayed by Unionist scum.

Its logic is sound, as would be expected from our top minds.\n\nFor one, they point to the already de facto separation existing between Welsh and Anglo, the latter hiding away in Swansea and surrounding villages more loyal to a dead king than to our national project. If they desire to live separately from us, so be it. They will have no right to complain if they suddenly find the desire to move over to the prosperous Welsh regions once declared beneath them.\n\nBuilding on this, our advisors also point to evidence of increased criminality among the Anglos, along with less desire to work, and more support for communism. This is all scientifically proven, and makes one ask why the backwards Lewis government ever believed these two groups could function side-by-side. Let them run their own inept education and law enforcement, we shall have no part in it. This, they argue, is a path to true equality, a separation of cultures based on how they desire to live. Separate but equal, we shall protect this great nation."

 WAL_Cayo_Second_Class_Citizens_desc: "There is an iron law of nature: the strong shall inherit the world, while the weak and unfit shall perish. As defenders of the Welsh people, we take this principle seriously.\n\nA wave of new legislation has allowed us to rightfully reward the productivity and loyalty of the average Welshman, while pushing out the slothful, traitorous Anglos. We shall prevent these backwards elements from operating businesses without our comprehensive approval, and shall do the same in regards to their schools and "advocacy" organizations. We also aim to implement a system of passes required for their free movement, in order to fight trans-metropolitan crime. This all be must done rigorously, to uphold the segregation of our two parallel peoples, for we can never again allow ourselves to be held back by the lies of Unionists. Let them cry out discrimination if they so desire, we know this is the only way Wales can remain free."

 WAL_Cayo_Imprison_Anglo_Politicians_desc: "It is a great failure of Mr. Lewis to have ever allowed for the political participation of the so-called "Independents". These creatures are Unionist in all but name, making their sole goal the destruction of all freedom for Wales. Our independence, the liberty of our working class, and any kind of survival of the Welsh culture, these monsters seek to burn it all down in the name of blind English liberalism.\n\nWe shall begin with John Morris, leader of this gang of thugs, and quickly move down the ladder. Once the radical Anglo agitators see what happens to traitors in our nation, they will surely think twice before ever trying to destroy our sovereignty. From that point forward, our government can finally be free, one governed by and for the Welsh people without outside interference."

 WAL_Cayo_The_English_Devil_desc: "It is so heartening to see that so many artists and intellectuals in this country have not been poisoned by leftism. In recent days, we have seen an outpouring of support among them to help in our campaign against the English Devils. Children's book authors have accepted various manuscripts given to them, from "Grab the Devil by His Horns" to "The Little Free Soldier". We are harnessing cinema too, with a team of the nation's finest directors coming together to create a picture outlining our glorious battle against the Anglos.\n\nOf course, beyond just our media, we aim to have even the most remote villages aware of the Anglo's degeneracy. Our Minister of Information will oversee the production of over 100,000 posters and educational pamphlets. No wall will be passed without a reminder of the violent Anglo crimes, no street corner shall be without our best men handing out pamphlets illustrating the superiority of the Welshman. In every mind, in every soul, it shall be Wales above all else."

 WAL_Cayo_Promote_Welsh_Values_desc: "Our independence means little if we are still colonized in every aspect of our culture. Centuries of English domination has driven our language, history, and arts to near extinction. All of our forces should be directed to reverse this atrocious state of affairs.\n\nThe battle begins in schools: Welsh only, from the womb, with a curriculum outlining our millennia of struggle and the peerless works of culture our citizens have created. Our next generations will eat and breathe our culture. But the struggle must take on all facets of society. We must vigorously subsidize any works reviving and propagating our culture, wholeheartedly spread the Welsh language to every secluded corner, and otherwise foster in every Welshman that they are of the world's strongest and richest culture, standing guard against English domination."

 WAL_Cayo_Fate_Of_The_Military_desc: "The wolves circle with bared teeth. Only the most loyal, well-trained, and fully armed military can be effective in allowing our nation to have a chance in hell of survival. This fighting force, swelling with many zealous FWA supporters, is unfortunately governed by an old guard of officers. Some are loyal to Wales above all else, and will gladly take our side. Others may need a bit more convincing, either through a few nice promises or the examples made of traitors. Finally, there are the traitors who hold posts from the top on down. Unionists and communists both sought to weaken and feminize our boys. We shall weed them out. Let's move forward with a plan for an all-officer conference, in order to find out where every single member of the old guard stands."
 WAL_Cayo_Anti_Unionist_Purge: "Anti-Unionist Purge"
 WAL_Cayo_Anti_Unionist_Purge_desc: "At the highest ranks, the English roaches have infiltrated our army. We must immediately remove them from all their posts, and try them for their cowardly stewardship of what could be an indomitable force. Once those traitors are out of the way, the members of the brass who have not yet taken a side will be forced to make their move. Either they follow our lead in upholding Wales above all, or they shall be shot like a lowly militiaman.\n\nAny unfounded fears that purging disloyal elements will weaken our army simply lack a commitment to the national struggle. So many fine commanders have been born from the FWA's heroic campaign, and will be perfectly suited to lead this institutional force. Every gun from there on out shall be locked and loaded, pointing at every single enemy of our people."
 WAL_Cayo_Political_Officers: "Political Officers"
 WAL_Cayo_Political_Officers_desc: "he way to control a military is through its leaders. If we are to ensure its loyalty we will need to put officers loyal to us in command. Any officers in the military who are of dubious loyalty will be replaced by more... pliable members. We shall also implement political officers throughout the ranks to prevent the proliferation of traitorous thoughts. Through this, we shall make certain that we can always rely on the military to carry out what is best for Wales."

 WAL_Cayo_Integrate_The_Free_Welsh_Army_desc: "Now that the Free Wales Army has ensured our control of the nation, and the military has had its loyalties assured we no longer need the FWA to be a separate entity. We will integrate them into the military branches to reduce the administrative burden of managing two separate militaries. While we're at it, we should also make sure that FWA leaders are put in positions of significant leadership, as generals and commanders."

Once more there is a Y Mab Darogan, once more there is a man of Welsh birth, of Welsh blood in charge of Cymru, the true name for our land and not that imposed by the English dogs. But success mustn't get to our heads, for with our power secured there is now work to be done.\n\nWe shall need a bigger army to defend our soil from English encroachment, the economy so mismanaged by incompetant treacherous unionists must be rebuilt, and those Unionists who almost brought our great nation to ruin must never be given the opportunity to sully Wales with their feeble attempts at governance. Democracy has failed the Welsh people, the Free Wales Army shall not."

 WAL_Cayo_Getting_The_Elites_Trust_desc: "Some act as if the upper classes are inherently hostile to the people of Wales but the facts of the matter is that they were as equally victims of English oppression as us all. The businessman who funded our liberation, the clergy who kept the tongue of the people safe for centuries, the land owners who did not show their true colours and flee, all are useful to us.\n\nWe will have to give certain assurances of course, on matters of continued ownership of land and rights for the churches who see things our way. Perhaps some favourable contracts to Welsh businesses as well. Provided that they grant us their support, nothing shall go wrong for them."

 WAL_Cayo_Inspiration_From_Franco_desc: "The Caudillo of Iberia is a man who imposed his vision onto an entire nation, one who has for decades kept control even when outside forces more numerous than his own sought to ensure otherwise. The Y Mab Darogan sees much to admire in Francisco Franco, an equal of sorts.\n\nThe art of control is a subtle one, and Julian Cayo-Evans knows that acting in haste will do the state little good. Internal enemies must be played against each other where possible, and removed if they start getting ideas. External foes can be placated, but must not feel slighted too much lest they take a keener interest in Cymru. It will be difficult work, ensuring that the nation remains stable but it is worth the doing."

 WAL_Cayo_Restart_The_Factories_desc: "There may have been some slight, ehhh, disruptions to industry during the Liberation, unintentional yet also undeniable as they ceased the production of many a factory, mine and mill.\n\nDedicating some proper resources to get those factories in disrepair back on their feet might be worthwhile, we need the income after all and we are the government now, it could prove beneficial to be proactive. Jobs will aid our legitimacy to many people, if someone has three meals a day and a job which keeps a roof over their head they are far less likely to go thinking about things like "Unionism" or "Democracy", after all everyone has someone they care about."
 WAL_Cayo_Reinforcing_The_Police: "Reinforcing the Police"
 WAL_Cayo_Reinforcing_The_Police_desc: "Police are traditionally a tool of the English to oppress the Welsh spirit, used to crush our demonstrations and hold our country hostage. Well turnabout is fair play, and there are quite a few Englishmen to have grudges against in this day and age.\n\nFirst off we will need to reform the training of the police to be more friendly to Welsh values and, well, less friendly to English ones. Expanding their numbers will assist in this, many hands make light work and all but the Y Mab Darogan sees this reform of the constabulary as important for another reason as well. Police make a decent stopping force in peacetime, in a time of war they might prove a useful tool against traitors."
 WAL_Cayo_Time_For_True_Reform: "Time for True Reform"
 WAL_Cayo_Time_For_True_Reform_desc: "The people of Wales slaved under the English yoke for five centuries and it very nearly broke them before the Free Wales Army started the Liberation, but there are some who worry if we will be the same tyrants in a dragon's coat. The Y Mab Darogan has ordered this be put to rest, and intends to make a speech to the nation on this subject.\n\nDemocracy is not needed for freedom, freedom means an economy where men and women need not starve on the streets, freedom means pensions for the old, and healthcare for the sick. Freedom is not having to worry about the Germans coming back to the isles once more. Julian Cayo-Evans promises all this and more to the people of Wales, if they only give him a chance."
 WAL_Cayo_A_New_Economy_For_Wales: "A New Economy for Wales"
 WAL_Cayo_A_New_Economy_For_Wales_desc: "Coal is good, it fuels turbines and engines and fires all across the world. Wales has traditionally relied upon it for much of our wealth, but as in all things the Unionist pigs screwed it up. Our economy is now almost entirely reliant upon coal and its proceeds, something that is exceptionally risky.\n\nA solid economic policy is needed to rectify this situation at once, or at the least in a reasonable time frame. The Free Wales Army might not be economists by trade but it does not take a genius to work from the premise of "we need something other than coal." Wales is valuable for more than just one metal all things considered, let us show that to the world."

 WAL_Cayo_Exploit_Our_Resources_desc: "Cars, tanks, building materials, boats, and a thousand other things are made from steel. Yet the imperialist English never properly exploited our iron deposits to make it. Such incompetence is only to be expected but all the same it makes our job of rebuilding the economy far harder than it ought to be.\n\nOn the other hand, the Free Wales Army taking credit for expanding the national economy would be quite the political coup would it not? Indeed one might say it would prove highly beneficial to our public image, something that can never hurt. Oh for sure there will be some initial expenses but all the same Welsh steel shall be ours soon enough."
 WAL_Cayo_Compromise_With_Our_Members: "Compromise With Our Members"
 WAL_Cayo_Compromise_With_Our_Members_desc: "The FWA has always been a party and organisation dedicated to the total liberation of Wales from English imperialism, it is somewhat unsurprising then that a not insignificant portion of our membership is somewhat if not outright left leaning politically. The Y Mab Darogan himself might not believe too strongly in their calls for workers' liberation, but that is not to say that a compromise cannot be worked out.\n\nIf we push the idea of the FWA as a broad coalition rather than a purely nationalist organisation it might aid our perception with the Welsh people, and assure them that accusations of petty despotry and fascism are utterly false and fabricated lies. That said, this course of action might prove concerning to some of the more businesslike elements of the FWA."
 WAL_Cayo_Supporting_The_Welsh_Workers: "Supporting the Welsh Workers"
 WAL_Cayo_Supporting_The_Welsh_Workers_desc: "England has always exploited Wales, it was Welsh miners who died in poorly built tunnels for their industrial revolution, Welsh soldiers who died in their imperialist wars, and Welsh people who saw no care from the state for their sacrifices. But the Y Mab Darogan is a kind liberator, and seeks to change the realities of Welsh life to better fit our great people.\n\nA minimum wage shall prevent the Welsh worker from being exploited by the cruel and avaricious foreign businessmen, safety regulations will prevent needless deaths in the mines, pensions shall give relief to those who sacrificed their health for the glory of Cymru. Always the Y Mab Darogan cares for those whom he liberated, and all Wales shall know it."
 WAL_Cayo_State_Led_Trade_Unions: "State-Led Trade Unions"
 WAL_Cayo_State_Led_Trade_Unions_desc: "The trade unions are a vital aspect of Welsh life, often having been one of the few things keeping the English imperialists from exploiting Wales beyond the brink. As the Y Mab Darogan works with the leftist elements of his party it only makes sense to incorporate the trade unions into the fabric of the new Wales.\n\nState led trade unions will find none of the hassle they have previously had to endure, they shall act as representatives for the workers which drive our economy to the government. Working with the trade unions has the added benefit of taking an institution the vast majority of the populace support and linking them to our political policies, they will legitimise our regime with many Welshmen who might otherwise be skeptical."
 WAL_Cayo_Welsh_Corporatism: "Welsh Corporatism"
 WAL_Cayo_Welsh_Corporatism_desc: "Why work with leftists when the answer lies right before our eyes? The liberation of Wales from English imperialism did not take place merely to shackle it to the will of pseduo-socialist imbeciles. The businessman and upper classes might not be a trustworthy lot, but they are possessed of a wonderfully exploitable self interest.\n\nWorking with the elites might not seem the easiest of moves but it will give us many benefits. Aside from not having to worry about nonsense like minimum wage, the upper elements of society will know very well that the people see them as being in league with us. Should Wales fall? They will be brought down from their pedestals also. But that is unlikely, in the meantime let's make some money."
 WAL_Cayo_Strict_Control: "Strict Control"
 WAL_Cayo_Strict_Control_desc: "Independent corporations are a good idea in theory, and tend to steal the money and stab you in the back in practice. Some of the fools associating with our government no doubt felt they could scam us for all we were worth, but the Y Mab Darogan did not earn his position by being an idiot.\n\nWe shall in each corporation operating in Wales, in the board of every mine and every mill, have a state sanctioned representative. They won't vote most of the time, nor will they act contrary to the interests of our allies. No they will be there to remind those inclined towards opportunism that we are always watching, and our reach is long. Oh and it might also cut down on obvious corruption. Benefits all around really."
 WAL_Cayo_State_Business_Cooperation: "State-Business Cooperation"
 WAL_Cayo_State_Business_Cooperation_desc: "Business is good, and as it happens so are our tax revenues. The wealth of our allies in the Welsh elite has made running the nation significantly easier, and aided the economy in general come to think of it. Investment is high, jobs are plentiful and the Y Mab Darogan is a popular man to be toasted at dinners.\n\nThis cooperation is a mutually beneficial partnership, in return for us looking the other way at times we get what we are due and more, the left leaning elements of the FWA may dislike this but they are a small portion of the greater whole anyway. It might be worth asking ourselves if we should keep them around in the long term, their utility now is limited after all."

 WAL_Cayo_Announce_Ourselves_To_The_World_desc: "The Y Mab Darogan's work in organising the first stages of the Welsh liberation has paid off handsomely. Now the FWA is in almost total control of Wales proper, outside the holdouts of some half starved pro-Unionist traitors that is.\n\nBut the rest of the world is unaware of the reclamation of national sovereignty that has occured, aside from the most basic details they know little enough about our revolution, something we must work to fix. Let us invite the rest of the world to see the restored glories of Wales! Let them see the dragon flag fly once more proud and true, the Germans and Americans alike will have to recognise us as no true puppet of their interests, and under the guidance of the Y Mab Darogan Wales shall prosper!"

 WAL_Cayo_Continue_The_Coal_Trade_desc: "Coal is as much apart of Wales as the dragon and the mountains. Once exploited by the English imperialists for its wealth, in the modern era it is the Welsh people who stand to reap the rewards of this black gold.\n\nCoal provides an enormous number of jobs all across Wales, going back upon it now will put their livelihoods in jeopardy. Julian Cayo-Evans would be no true Y Mab Darogan if he were to simply cast aside the necessity of continued coal exports. As a side note, the Germans who receive a significant share of these imports would most certainly be quite happy that there have been no interuptions. But that is merely a benefit of this decision not the purpose."
 WAL_Cayo_Retreat_Our_Position: "Retreat Our Position"
 WAL_Cayo_Retreat_Our_Position_desc: "The unfortunate fact is, that an economy based upon a single material cannot be successful in the long term. The Y Mab Darogan has made the difficult decision to stop the mining of further coal to enable the Welsh economy to get back upon its feet. This will cause hardship that much is true, and a great deal of it to the mining towns some of whom rely almost entirely on the black gold of the mountains.\n\nIt does not matter, like anything good too much can lead to addiction, and we only sell coal to the Germans anyway, that merry band of imperialists, conquerors and madmen who would see us swept before them if they had the chance. To hell with them and their imports."

 WAL_Cayo_Anglophobia_desc: "We are set to meet the English ambassador to Wales today. Why the now exiled imperialist tyrants bother to pretend they are not hostile to the interests of Wales and its people is beyond the Y Mab Darogan, it matters not in the end what pithy excuses and words come out of the ambassador's mouth. We know what England truly intends.\n\nThe Y Mab Darogan will put on a show for the public, in private however we will let this treacherous snake know exactly how we feel about English schemes, the era of the Anglocentric dominion of this isle is over. The age of the Welsh has begun."

 WAL_Cayo_Support_Our_Irish_Friends_desc: "The Irish were the first of the Celtic peoples to throw off their shackles and oppose the English dogs, and flawed though their liberation may have been they have done their best to correct this over the years. Strengthening their Gaelic tongue and even expelling English authority from Ireland in its entirety in the war.\n\nThe Y Mab Darogan proffers friendship to our Irish brothers, he reaches across the sea in a gesture of comradery to our once oppressed brethren that we may know the true scourge of these isles. Not something so debased as ideology, but the traitorous blood of the Anglo population themselves."
 WAL_Cayo_Repeal_English_Suffrage: "Repeal English Suffrage"
 WAL_Cayo_Repeal_English_Suffrage_desc: "The Y Mab Darogan knows the true enemy of Wales, the enemy within, the Anglo population who settled illegally under English rule and sought to impose upon us their way of life, their beliefs and their foul language. They wait in the shadows seeking to overturn the Welsh liberation through means of guile now that force has failed.\n\nWell we will act first against this pest ourselves. By the order of the Y Mab Darogan those who identify is English will be summarily stripped of their status as Welsh citizens, they will be forbidden from voting in municipal elections and national ones as well. Let the Anglo scourge try and worm their way into politics now."
 WAL_Cayo_Form_The_CLA: "Form the CLA"
 WAL_Cayo_Form_The_CLA_desc: "The Free Wales Army in the view of the Y Mab Darogan is a mere prototype for our true goal, the creation of a unified group of Celtic nations capable of fighting back against the Anglo menace that has for men centuries persecuted our kind. Irishmen, Bretons, Scots and Welshmen all shall be welcome to the Celtic Liberation Army!\n\nSome of our fellows may believe that taking such a harsh stance against the Anglo plague is unneeded, they are fools. The Anglo is treacherous, untrustworthy and will stab the Celtic peoples the moment their collective backs are bared. We cannot show weakness to animals, there can be only preparation for what is to come."

Our nation is engaged in the struggle of national liberation but even so we persevere onwards to greater and more comprehensive victories.\n\nThe Y Mab Darogan wants nations the world over to look at our nation with envy, not too much envy naturally lest they attempt to mimic the English imperialists and steal our riches but somewhat envious nonetheless.

The Y Mab Darogan, Julian Cayo-Evans has given us a simple order. The National Revolution is to begin in earnest.\n\nThis project long put aside will now be enacted, we will overcome the treacherous Anglo population inside our borders and return them to the filthy nation from whence they came.

 WAL_Cayo_Deport_The_Anglos_desc: "The deportation of the Anglo population is something we must do without any unneeded cruelty, we are not monsters like their nation after all. We will round up those classified as being of English descent, and simply cart them to the nearest border towns. From there we will give no hindrance save preventing them from crossing back over.\n\nThe Anglo problem has its answer, and for the glory of the National Revolution all loyal Welshmen will help us enact this.

Our military is well trained and well disciplined but what we truly lack are the numbers needed to react to an assault on multiple fronts.\n\nLimited conscription will do for the most part, but conscripts are not a reliable solution to the manpower problem in the long term. We need volunteers, volunteers who will sacrifice their lives willingly for Wales, not because they had the misfortune to be drafted. This is especially true when considering the propaganda the English will no doubt feed their own troops, perhaps if they realise they are fighting free men they might have second thoughts."
 WAL_Cayo_Free_Wales_Youth: "Free Wales Youth"
 WAL_Cayo_Free_Wales_Youth_desc: "The Free Wales Youth organisation has a single purpose, to educate the young people of our nation on the realities of our world. The National Revolution demands their assistance, the National Revolution needs their help to be completed. The English shot their grandparents, oppressed their parents under the guise of "Unionism" and "choice".\n\nIt is up to the new generation of men and women in this country to ensure this never happens again. They will be taught ideology, basic training to prepare them for volunteering in the armed forces, the Welsh language that their ancestors so long ago spoke with fluency. Most of all however, they will be taught that the Y Mab Darogan is never wrong."
 WAL_Cayo_Thats_Enough: "That's Enough"
 WAL_Cayo_Thats_Enough_desc: "The National Revolution has been concluded. We are sitting atop one of the greatest victories against the English since the Germans landed at Dover, and possibly the greatest victory in several hundred years not inflicted by a peer power. The Mab Y Darogan has led our nation's purification with unrivaled grace, Wales is for the Welsh people and no one else.\n\nWhen in hundreds of years our descendents look upon these days they will know it was a time of struggle which we won. A struggle which freed them from the oppression of the English. A National Revolution of true patriotic Welshmen that succeeded because it was their right, but now the revolution is done. Let us emerge from the fire strengthened."
 WAL_Cayo_Never_Ending_Revolution: "Never-Ending Revolution"
 WAL_Cayo_Never_Ending_Revolution_desc: "Should a revolution end? A question which has an obvious answer. No, no it should not. Traitors exist everywhere, and they are always seeking to bring about the downfall of Cymru from their hiding places. The English are an insidious people, constantly looking for ways to sabotage, to hinder, to cut out our legs from under us just as we regain our feet.\n\nHow can the Y Mab Darogan call for this revolution to end whilst this remains the case? Julian Cayo-Evans knows the risks well, but for the good of Wales there can be no sacrifice too dear or too extreme. Long live Wales, long live the Y Mab Darogan and long live the National Revolution!"

 WAL_Cayo_The_Welsh_National_Assembly: "The Welsh National Assembly"
 WAL_Cayo_The_Welsh_National_Assembly_desc: "The old system of Welsh government was corrupt and venal, serving the interests of the Unionist cause and the English imperialists, but this was by degeneration from its ancient roots rather than any inherent problem with true democratic ideals. A single man, even the Y Mab Darogan cannot hold all the power and it falls to Julian Cayo-Evans to decide how this power should be distributed. He has chosen to form the Welsh National Assembly, a body with the power to pass laws, albeit with the Y Mab Darogan having the right of veto. This will please some of those members of our party and the loyal opposition with attachments to democracy and generally reflect well upon Cayo-Evans."
 WAL_Cayo_The_Representatives: "The Representatives"
 WAL_Cayo_The_Representatives_desc: "Being a member of the Welsh National Assembly is no small duty, it is a service to the people of Wales where sacrifice for the greater good is not just expected but almost required. As the Y Mab Darogan, Cayo-Evans must be exceedingly careful about whomst the appointments to this venerable office will be assigned.\n\nAppointing flunkies has a certain appeal of course, allowing a great deal of centralised power to build up around the position of Y Mab Darogan is risky but possibly worth it. Alternatively, Plaid Cymru still exists to an appreciable extent, mayhaps they might be willing to work with us in return for a seat at the table?"

This continuing anarchy will not be allowed to go on unimpeded.\n\nThe Y Mab Darogan will make it clear to the leaders of the assorted cliques that their personal fiefdoms within the party are acceptable but also that they should be careful about acting too independently.

 WAL_Cayo_Centralize_Cayos_Power_desc: "Centralizing power around a single figure is a tricky business, first you need to sideline everyone else with the power to stop you and then you need to sell it to the greater public, but the Y Mab Darogan has not led his people wrong yet, and for many in a position of power that is enough.\n\nWhy risk attempting to stop Cayo-Evans after all, either he will succeed and all will be well or he won't and the opportunity will still be there at the end of the day. It might not hurt to extend this beyond the purely political scene as well. The judiciary has been getting a bit uppity lately, maybe they are in need of a reminder about how things work in this country?"

 WAL_Cayo_Holding_Wales_Together_desc: "When something hangs by a thread people tend to notice it, and in the case of Wales it is not just our own people who realise that the entire nation survives only so long as Julian Cayo-Evans does.\n\nThe unfortunate fact for some who seek power is that the Y Mab Darogan has so completely made himself the lynchpin of the Welsh state that there exists no one who could realistically succeed him. Redundancy is at an all time low and nobody knows what might happen if the Son of Destiny were to die on the morrow, luckily that is quite unlikely as Cayo-Evans has a fair few years ahead of him."

There is a reason the Free Wales Army was capable of becoming so popular after all. They represent quite possibly the only real political power in Wales not under our direct control, and now they agitate for a return of democracy.\n\nWhat's encouraged them to choose now of all times to ask for this major concession is unknown, but we will need to approach this problem carefully. Plaid still has supporters, and if we don't tread lightly they could turn against us with stunning rapidity."

 WAL_Cayo_The_Next_Elections_desc: "Today the Plaid Cymru leadership has approached the Y Mab Darogan and asked him point blank whether he is likely to restore democracy in the near future, to be specific elections. This was a bold move, and a statement of Plaid Cymru's strength that they would do this so openly.\n\nThe Y Mab Darogan knows he would win any election called, yet in all likelihood Plaid Cymru do not seek to change this so much as increase their own indepensibility to our government. Perhaps we should let them, who knows what might happen if they decide to turn against us."

Cabinet positions hold a not insignificant amount of influence in our new Wales, more in fact that many would given them credit for as it is they who are in charge of implementing the will of the Y Mab Darogan.\n\nOf course we could choose to offer no such appointments, keep things close to our chests so to speak but this is likely to alienate Plaid Cymru in a way that will noy be easy to fix.

Influence is nothing without the loyalty of the army, which we hold without exception.\n\nThey can keep their cabinet positions and National Assembly seats, we are the ones in control here, and the Y Mab Darogan is still unchallenged as is his right.

wal.1.t: "Cymru!"
wal.1.desc: "Out of the ashes of the Second World War the Welsh Dragon rose. When the dust settled and the German Eagle stood victorious, for the first time in centuries, Wales was free. Unlike neighboring England, the Germans have no direct influence over Welsh politics, with the Welsh people content to be completely neutral.\n\nThis neutrality comes at a cost however, Welsh coal, the country's main export and the only thing keeping Germany at bay. It was largely due to this neutrality and their export focused economy that Wales was able to ride out the economic crash of the 1950s that crippled Germany.\n\nDespite this lack of outsider influence, Welsh politics have become increasingly polarized over the previous decade and a half, in no small part due to the multitudinous English refugees who fled the German invasion, with the country split between those who look back fondly to the days when England and Wales were unified and those who believe that Wales should stay Welsh."
wal.1.a: "Long live the Republic!"
wal.2.t: "The Opening of the Welsh National Assembly"
wal.2.desc: "The air in Cardiff is filled with hustle and bustle and a general sense of busyness. Today even more so than most days for today is the opening of the Welsh National Assembly. The MPs have arrived, the speeches have been given and, behind closed doors, the battle for the future of Wales is about to begin. As battles go, this one isn't that much more civil than most.\n\nWales' internal political situation is... complicated to say the least. The current ruling party is Plaid Cymru leading a coalition of left and right wing nationalists, including Cymru Goch, democratic socialists and the second largest party in the nation. The coalition is only barely held together with many elements holding opposing views.\n\nTheir ranks are bolstered by the Unionists, the numerous English refugees that fled during Operation Sealion, who are named after and characterised by their desire to return to a United Kingdom with England as well as their wish to suppress Welsh culture in favour of English language and culture. They are also well known for their general disinterest in any government issues that do not affect them or England, preferring to stay on the sidelines in the Welsh National Assembly.\n\nThen there is the Free Wales Army. Led by Julian Cayo-Evans, this right-wing nationalistic paramilitary organisation vehemently opposes the Unionists and any idea of a union with England, viewing the English as the "true enemies of the Welsh people". Part of the coalition, they are notorious for their violent methods and clashes with Unionists and for their willingness to go to any lengths to achieve their goals. Despite being publicly perceived as merely a young, inexperienced and quite unstable leader, Cayo-Evans is determined to keep Wales Welsh and his charismatic personality and the fantical devotion and military might of the FWA mean he is not to be trifled with or dismissed without consequence."

wal.3.desc: ""Well Prime Minister Lewis, it's that time of year again. Time for the annual economic report."\n\nSaunder Lewis sighs. He hates economic report day. The damned economists take him away from his poetry.\n\n"Go on then Gwynfor, let's hear it."\n\n"Overall the economy is doing well, coal exports to the Reich are up by ten percent, and exports to the English by thirteen. The agricultural sector is shrinking but the growth in the coal mining industry well makes up for that. As you well know, coal mining is by far the largest industry in the economy, providing the vast majority of the jobs in the country. There have been calls to decrease our economy's reliance on coal and to open up the economy for new industries."\n\n"And what do the mining firms think of that idea?"\n\n"Well unsurprisingly, they are much more in favor of upholding the status quo. However, it may be prudent to hear out those who are calling to diversify the economy since, well, if anything were to happen to the coal deposits the result would be... well... catastrophic for the economy and Wales as a whole.""
wal.3.a: ""But that'll never happen. Right Evans?""
wal.4.t: "The Coal Debate"
wal.4.desc: ""It is completely obvious that the economy is too reliant on the coal exports. Were anything to happen to the coal we would face an enomourse catastrophe! We need to diversify. We need to open up the economy!" To resounding "ayes" from his side of the room, the Goch MP takes his seat.\n\nThe economy question. An issue that splits the government. Many in the government believe that the Welsh economy's reliance on coal is a critical weak point and that the economy needs to be opened up for other industries to sprout up. On the other side are those that believe otherwise, seeing the reliance on coal as an indication that coal is still the way forward for Wales.\n\nThe Plaid MP rises to the podium to begin his rebuttal.\n\n"With respect to the honourable Mr Davies, this is a ridiculous notion! There is no evidence that anything will happen that could cause the coal industry to weaken at all. In fact there is abundant evidence to the contrary, the coal industry has never been stronger! Any sort of changes would simply affect the whole economy adversely.""

wal.5.desc: ""Those damned fools."\n\n"What's that dear?"\n\n"They really think that the coal industry can keep moving under its own momentum? Can't they see that by stifling other industries they're just tying the entire economy to a single industry? If it fails somehow, the whole country will suffer!"\n\nUnlike some of his fellow Members of Parliament, Brice Davies is not an emotional man but talking to his wife about the government's decision to maintain the status quo just makes his blood boil. He just can't believe how short-sighted they are, how blissfully ignorant they are of the dangers ahead.\n\nAt least he isn't the only one seething at the government's decision, he thinks to himself, remembering the protests he saw on his way home.\n\n"They really don't know what they're doing," he mutters to himself."
wal.5.a: ""Of course dear.""
wal.6.t: "And Now for Something Different?"
wal.6.desc: ""A CHANGE IN COURSE?" reads the headlines of the newspaper.\n\n"After a vote in parliament, the government has decided to open up the economy in order to allow new industries to develop. This comes as a surprise to many in the country who believed that the government wouldn't approve anything that could threaten the primacy of the coal industry. This controversial decision comes soon after a heated debate in parliament about said issue. Many Parliament Members have called the decision "outrageous" and "ridiculous" stating that "the coal industry has never been stronger" and that any changes to the status quo could upset the economic environment."\n\nOwain Morgan smiles, turning the page. It would seem they were finally seeing sense and shifting the focus on coal exports. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad time to follow up on his plans to start a new business, now that new industries and ventures could be successful. Of course it would be riskier than just investing in coal, but "fortune favours the bold" his father always used to say to him."

wal.7.desc: ""The workers need more protections! Currently, there is nothing stopping businesses from exploiting their workers. No one here can say, in good conscience, that this is acceptable!" The Goch MP's words echo throughout the hall as he pauses before returning to his seat.\n\nLabour regulations. A subject no less contentious than the coal debate. The Goch's position is made very clear: the workers of Wales are unprotected and open to exploitation, and this is unacceptable.\n\nThe Plaid is somewhat less unified on the matter but many members agree that any changes could injure the large businesses in the country and even cause some to withdraw their business.\n\n"To the honourable Mr Davies," starts the Plaid MP "any increase in regulatory measures implemented by the government would adversely affect the whole economy. By forcing corporations to bend to these unnecessary regulations growth will be stifled for little to no actual gain.""

wal.8.t: "This Should Work Out"
wal.8.desc: ""A GOOD TIME TO WORK?", reads the headline of the newspaper, a picture of a cheering crowd of miners emblazoned on the front page.\n\n"In a decision welcomed by many in the country, the government has decided to pass a bill improving workers' rights in the country in order to, in the words of a Goch spokesperson, 'ensure that never again can the big business exploit the vulnerable workers of Wales.' The Goch, praising the decision, also stated, 'The workers are the backbone of the economy. The workers, the people are what matter. Not the big business, not the rich, the people.' The bill, which implements higher minimum wages and limits maximum working hours, has been declared by members of Plaid Cymru to be 'wasteful'. One Plaid member said the following: 'Any increase in so-called worker rights and regulations will just cause the productivity of businesses to fall. The increased funding to government agencies to ensure these misguided regulations are enforced is a waste of money in a time where no money can be afforded to be wasted.'"\n\nGael Dawson smiles to himself, finally the importance of him and his fellow workers was being recognised and appropriately rewarded by the government. He wonders what he should do to celebrate."
wal.8.a: "Drinks with the lads?"
wal.9.t: "Is Less More?"
wal.9.desc: ""LESS FOR SOME, MORE FOR ALL?" reads the headline on the front page of the local paper.\n\n"In a shocking reveal, the government has announced that the decision of deregulation has been made. A statement given by a Plaid Cymru spokesperson stated the following: 'There are those who claim that deregulation will open up the way to the exploitation of workers, but this is simply false. Rather, by removing the shackles that hold businesses back from prosperity, deregulation will open up the way towards a better future for all in Wales. While admittedly some workers' rights have been lost, the amount those same workers and Wales as a whole stand to gain from the economic benefit of deregulation is well worth the loss.' Protests have broken out in several cities including Cardiff as workers take to the streets. Some of these have resulted in violent clashes with police with many workers being taken into custody. Many Goch MPs have denounced the controversial decision with one going so far as to calling it an 'obscenity' and a 'threat to workers' rights everywhere'."\n\nGael Dawson frowns, putting down the paper firmly. Working in the mine was hard enough as it was with the long hours and low pay characteristic of manual labour jobs. With deregulation a certainty, it could only get harder."

He fiddles with the dials with his hands, rough and calloused from years of manual labour, until the static recedes and the speaker's voice finally becomes understandable.\n\n"Emrys Thomas is set to become Wales' second Prime Minister after Cymru Goch's narrow victory against the Unionist Party in the elections. Many are attributing this win to the Goch's promises of increased welfare benefits and improved workers' rights including higher minimum wages and a promise to improve working conditions, a position well liked by many voters. Only time can tell whether or not these promises will be fulfilled."\n\n"Oh thank God," Gael breathes, relieved. "You hear that dear?" he calls to his wife, who has at this point successfully wrangled the children. "Everything will be fine. They'll be raising the minimum wages! We can get out of this part of town and move somewhere nicer!"\n\n"You really think so?""

wal.14.t: "A Unionist Victory"
wal.14.desc: "Gael Dawson anxiously hovers by the radio, waiting for the results of the election to be broadcast. He leans closer as the speaker begins.\n\n"In a surprising turn of events, the Unionist Party has won the elections! John Morris, the leader of the party, is now set to become the second Prime Minister of Wales, promising to reunify England and Wales. Morris, popular amongst the English post-war refugees, has already begun to outline his plans to bring about a peaceful unification of England and Wales. Emrys Thomas of the Cymru Goch has declined to comment on the result but the outspoken, controversial leader of the Free Wales Army, Julian Cayo-Evans made it extremely clear the FWA's position regarding the result declaring his intention to "oppose any attempts to replace the tyrannical English boot upon Wales." Only time can tell whether the Unionists' plan will come to fruition."\n\nGael sighs, it wasn't the increased labour benefits he had been hoping for when he voted for the Goch, but maybe a reunion with England wouldn't be so bad. His father had always spoken fondly of the United Kingdom. Besides, the worst outcome that could come out of a reunification attempt would be that England refuses right? Right?"

The peace and quiet in front of the Welsh Assembly buildings seems almost unreal, picturesque.\n\nThat tranquillity is abruptly shattered by the sounds of trucks and vans as they burst around the corner at full speed. A motley assortment of vehicles, different in so many ways but all united in purpose by the symbols on their sides and the flags they fly. All of them some variation of the Eryr Wen, the symbol of the Free Wales Army. Out of these vehicles spills out dozens of men, some younger, some older and all armed to the teeth. As they take up positions around the buildings' entrance, preparing to enter, a man emerges from one of the vans. Young, charismatic, unstable.\n\nHe is Julian Cayo-Evans and he is here to protect Wales from the Anglophilic Unionist menace."

wal.18.t: "The Aberfan Disaster"
wal.18.desc: "At around 10:40am this morning, tragedy struck the southern coal mining town of Aberfan. As a result of heavy rains, a large spoil tip full of waste rock located on the mountainside suddenly collapsed and began sliding down the slopes as a heavy slurry of stone and mud. The gigantic landslide careened down the mountain and engulfed a significant portion of the village, destroying dozens of homes and, most distressingly of all, the local school.\n\nDesperate rescue teams have been attempting to look for survivors, but scores of bodies have already been recovered from the ruins, the vast majority of them being children. Over a hundred pupils and several dozen teachers were in the school at the time of the disaster, so the ultimate death toll is expected to be very grim indeed. A few older residents were also recovered from collapsed houses, though most people were thankfully away at work at the time.\n\nOutrage has quickly spread across Wales, with many blaming the government's exploitative coal mining policies and lax regulations for the disaster. Questions have been raised as to how the spoil tip was allowed to grow so large in so precarious a place, and particular criticism has been levelled at economic minister Gwynfor Evans and his secretary Roderic Bowen for creating such a loose regulatory environment that would allow a thing like this to happen. The fallout from the Aberfan Disaster has put the already weakened government on even more of a knife's edge."

wal.19.t: "The Welfare Debate"
wal.19.desc: "On another unremarkable grey day, the Welsh Assembly convened to discuss the government's welfare policy; the debate was not expected to go smoothly for the National Front. Quiet anticipation filled the chamber as a Goch member stood up to introduce his party's motion.\n\n"I wish to make it known to the Assembly that the Goch approves the achievements of the National Front concerning improvements and development of the welfare safety net. Those who are part of the Goch also wish that the government will continue to increase its scale to better protect Welsh workers from poverty."\n\nThis was a poor display of feigned unity over the government's welfare policy. In reality, the divisions on the issue are deep and neither side is keen to fold to the other. This was made clear to all inside the Assembly as a member of the Plaid stood up to address the point made by the Goch.\n\n"Whilst the view of the Goch is admirable, it is infeasible within our current economy. Put simply, the country does not have the money for such an irresponsible expansion, in fact it does not even have the money to support the current system."\n\nBarely stifled outrage came from the Goch as they realised what the Plaid was pushing for. Regardless of these differences, one side would have to blink first, the welfare system had to be changed."

wal.20.desc: ""There's been a mistake. They have to have made a mistake."\n\nRoberts repeated to himself as he stared blankly down at his welfare payment, which, to his horror had greatly shrunk since the last time he had received it. His hands trembled slightly as he desperately started to count it again in the hope that it was in fact who had faltered, but he soon realised that he was right. Life kept getting worse for him.\n\nThings have not always been this way for Roberts, since being sacked from his last job he, like the rest of his coworkers, had expected that he would not be on the dole for long. He planned to find a job after a few weeks of recovery. Once he had sorted his life out he could return to work, whether it be in an office, production line or a pit.\n\nHowever, over time no such opportunity arose; he began to get used to the meager life that his benefits allowed. To save what patience he had was not an option. Despite the fact he desperately needed some savings in case his financial situation somehow deteriorated further.\n\nNow is the time he needs the money, money that he never had. Now he feels as if he has been left behind to slowly be bled dry of his remaining wealth, until he gets lucky and finds a way out. Though he does not know how he could escape."
wal.20.a: "The poor get poorer."
wal.21.t: "Backlash Against the Cuts"
wal.21.desc: "After sauntering out of his gently decaying home, Roberts started to make the all too familiar journey toward his local council. Every week he would wait on the road side, killing time until he could meet a civil servant, who would supposedly help find him a job.\n\nBut what did they care about him? They had a job for life in the council, a warm office to work in and a reasonable house to return to. They had everything he wanted. All they did was stay inside and force him to spend another wasted day waiting.\n\nThis time he was not going to wait. He would go in and get his money back himself.\n\nRoberts turned the corner of the council and realised his situation was not unique. A mob was slowly forming outside the council. It pounded on the doors, shouted and howled; demanding to be let in and paid what was owed to them in full.\n\nBut the people inside the locked doors did not care, they carried on doing their jobs. Happy to remain ignorant of the crowd outside that would eventually be dispersed."

wal.22.t: "An Expansion of Welfare"
wal.22.desc: "It did not take long for the chancellor to find glaring issues with the expansion of welfare that had passed through the Assembly. The estimated costs were astronomical, he dreaded to think how they would be covered, if indeed they could be covered at all.\n\nUndoubtedly, they could not. A fellow member of the government had even made clear in the prior debate that the old system was already too expensive. The increases were unaffordable and his party knew it. Yet, he thought, the government would sooner capitulate to the demands of the workers than take a stand and accept reality.\n\nBut, it was his job to make the expansion of the welfare program a reality, irrespective of his own convictions on the matter.\n\nSo he continued to work on implementing the new benefits, occasionally taking nervous glances at the cost, knowing full well that they would make him vastly unpopular with a certain group of people."
wal.22.a: "Maybe they will be understanding?"
wal.23.t: "Retaliation From the Rich"

He recognised a couple of the return addresses as he sifted through them. The letters had been sent from offices that he had visited many times before; offices owned by some of the most prominent and wealthy businessmen in all of Wales.\n\nThe minister assumed they would not be all too supportive of the government's rise in welfare spending; regardless, curiosity got the better of him and he sat down to open them. Grabbing a blunt letter opener that was close to hand, he began to struggle with the seal, carefully trying not to damage the message inside.\n\nOnce he had freed the contents of the envelope he scanned the page and, to his dismay, confirmed his previous thoughts. The influential industrial giant who had sent it had made his feelings clear. The man was enraged at the rise in welfare, he believed it would cripple his company as more workers would prefer the dole.\n\nSetting the letter down, he continued to work his way down the pile. Each of the letters were filled with outrage at his actions and accusations of betrayal, claims which seemed greatly exaggerated to him, but the fact remained that the wealthy were immensely upset.\n\nTheir message was clear, the industrial giants no longer felt like they could support the government the chancellor was a part of."

With the Goch pushing for greater protections and the Plaid willing to denounce such ideas as out right communism, the government awaits a fiery debate. To introduce the issue of the protection of workers, a member of the Goch stood up and started to challenge the Plaid directly:\n\n"I stand here today to express the grave concerns of the Goch regarding the Plaids inability to sufficiently protect those most vulnerable to the perverse actions often taken by cost cutting industries. To not extend the rights of our workers is to leave them exposed to unlawful reductions in wages and working conditions. Reductions me and my fellow members of the Goch will not allow."\n\nApproving noises came from the Goch members as he returned to his seat. Though it was not long before a member of the Plaid came back with an equally impassioned response:\n\n"I recognise the fears of the Goch, but if we were to enact these so called 'protections' we would all too soon find ourselves sliding down a slippery slope toward communism. On the grounds that this risks outright tyranny, I must call those loyal to the National Front to reject this Bill!""

Yet today is one of those rare days where the people of Cardiff can relax, if only momentarily, and truly enjoy life in Wales.\n\nAnd the passing of the worker protection reform is a good cause for celebration indeed. The long suffering workers of Wales have always had issues with their rotten bosses, cutting them short wherever they could. But no more. The government have finally intervened and suspect their lives to greatly improve.\n\nYet those in the government do not share the joy of the people. The bosses will not be as pleased as the people on the streets; they are not likely to lend much of their support in future.\n\nHowever, for those on the streets, the celebrations are expected to continue long into the night, it might only be a small victory, but, at long last, the workers of Wales are winning."

The realisation that the government was going to cut down on the few protections they used to have, had hit hard.\n\nMany felt like they had been betrayed by the government, yet any attempt to prevent their actions would inevitably be futile. So they quickly learnt to accept the changes, and carry on with their lives.\n\nThough such somber feelings were not shared with the men who owned the factories they worked in. They revelled in the news, knowing full well that the reforms would make them richer than ever before. As every big business owner in the country would likely inevitably capitalize on it.\n\nThe government has earned their support; but at a great cost."

wal.27.desc: "Meetings between influential ministers have become a common occurrence over the past few weeks. The cabinet would arrive in a drab office where the PM would inevitably be waiting for them, making last minute preparations before they entered into the business of the day.\n\nThis meeting however was to be different. Government ministers were not the only ones who would attend. Some of them were quietly shocked when the Prime Minister told them that he had invited a group of representatives from several of the country's more powerful unions.\n\nShortly after the ministers had been told of the imminent arrival of the unions, the representatives had begun to file in and quickly took their seats opposite the government. After they had all entered, the PM welcomed them and began to outline what the purpose of the talks would be. They were to discuss the actions of the government over the past few months. The Prime Minister made sure to remind all those present of the legislation his government had passed, sometimes going into painful amounts of detail.\n\nUltimately his lengthy address boiled down to one simple question:\n\nWhat did the unions think of the government?"
wal.27.a: "The Prime Minister awaited their response."

wal.28.desc: ""You've been great, finally yours is a government I can trust. You better be willing to continue supporting us workers, we would hate to see all your good work go to waste."\n\nThis reply was greatly encouraging for the Prime Minister and his cabinet, they knew that the support of the unions would be very useful. Keeping them satisfied would leave one less issue for the government to deal with in the coming months.\n\nHowever, the cost of the unions' support has been immense.\n\nThe Prime Minister had forced his economy minister to make great sacrifices in the budget, in order to expand the welfare programs, as well as forcing huge amounts of strain upon the government to push through reforms to workers' rights. The cabinet could only hope that all their efforts would pay off.\n\nAt least, for the time being, the unions were at ease."

You could have helped us, but instead you just left us up to our necks in sheep shit. If this is all you've brought us here for, I don't see any point in saying."\n\nThe meeting did not continue for very long after that.\n\nIt had not gone the way the Prime Minister had intended, he had at least hoped that they would remain neutral toward him. However, the union representatives had made it abundantly clear to the government that they were not just disappointed, they were angry.\n\nWith relations with the unions in tatters, governing will become a much harder task. Those in the government hope that they will not seek some form of vengeance.\n\nThough most have accepted that this is incredibly unlikely."

wal.30.t: "A Mixed Response"
wal.30.desc: ""Starting the work may be two thirds of it, though I doubt whether you ever wanted the other third to be complete." Came the brief reply from the union representative.\n\nThis was not the level of support the Prime Minister, and indeed the rest of his cabinet, had been hoping for.\n\nThough the ministers were disappointed, the unions scepticism was not unjustified, the government had never completely committed itself to following the wishes of the unions in the first place. The legislation it had passed simply had not gone far enough. And in some worrying cases, it had even reversed some of the progress from the past.\n\nThe talks continued for a little while longer, with the union members urging the government to do more for the workers in the future. However, the ministers opposed them did not pay much attention. So long as the unions were appeased they would not care what they had to say.\n\nEach side left the talks a little more despondent than they had arrived, with nothing of worth to show for their efforts."

wal.31.desc: ""Good morning gentlemen. Shall we begin?"\n\nIt's that time of year once again, time for the Ministry of Economics to give their report to the government.\n\n"As you can see here," the speaker starts, motioning towards the graph, "coal exports have risen quite dramatically. We should start to see the positive effects of this on the rest of the economy soon. We predict that this will cause employment in the coal industry to rise by between seven and nine percent. The overall positive effects of this..."\n\nAs the speaker's dull voice drones about the room, Brice Davies wakes to a sharp jab to his side.\n\n"You dozed off again! Get it together!" Dylan Reese, his fellow Plaid member, whispers."
wal.31.a: ""Huh, what did I miss?""
wal.32.t: "As If They Weren't Given Enough Already"
wal.32.desc: ""...and as you well know, the Welsh military is woefully inadequate. The many threats that we face, especially the English menace, mean that the military budget must be increased in order to properly defend the country."\n\nSaunders Lewis sighs wearily, putting down the letter. Once again the military is requesting more funding in order to protect against "English aggression". There definitely is some merit to their requests, a stronger military would deter any aggressive acts from neighbouring England. However, the budget is rather high as it is and that money could be spent well in other ways, namely reinvesting into the country by improving state services such as better quality schooling.\n\nThen there is the third, almost unspeakable, option, slash the military budget. Europe has been at peace for nearly 20 years and there are many in the country who are of the belief that too much of the government's limited resources are allocated towards a military that serves little purpose."

wal.33.desc: "After much consideration of the very ideals of Wales, some members of the government have decided to meet with the Free Wales Army, lead by Julian Cayo to deal with the leftists in the country. After the discussion, the meeting spot was chosen in a pub in Cardiff. The FWA asked the representatives from the Plaid to dress in normal clothes and not the clothes they would wear to a government procedure.\n\nOnce they had arrived, an armed FWA member was standing on the inside of the pub. One of the representatives remarked that the whole pub seemed to be owned by the FWA in which one of the FWA members replied to this and said that this pub a few others are used as safe houses by the FWA if they are on the run from the Left Militias that roam Wales. After an hour of negotiations between the two parties, the FWA agreed to stop shooting up Welsh police barracks and stop the firefights with the Left Militias. The FWA agreed on this as long as the government coalition agreed to move forward with the idea of Welsh nationalism and begun to start to get rid of influence from the Anglos. The representatives from the government agreed to this proposition and the two parties left from the pub a few minutes after an agreement was reached.\n\nThe next day, a small group of members from the government met to discuss the development with the FWA. After heated discussion from the more left-leaning members of the government, they decided they would honor their agreement and start to include more nationalist elements in the government. After the left-leaning members left in protest, the conversation switched to the raids on the Left Militias. An argument broke out in the group but this had been quelled and the decision was reached, raids would start on the Left."

After some spirited meetings from the members of the government cabinet, they had decided to talk to the left-wing militias that roam Wales. It had been discussed lots in the very meeting rooms of the building. It would go back and forth between the members of the cabinet. They wondered about the more radical members of the Plaid and the Free Wales Army's reaction to this development but they went with it.\n\nAfter contacting the militias that would roam across Wales, a meeting place was decided where the two parties could talk and discuss the current situation of Wales. The place would be the very capital of Wales, Cardiff. Once the two parties arrived in the city, they had begun talks about the situation. The government had sent representatives from all groups of the coalition, but most representatives had been in the social democrats. As the talks had gone on, things had been discussed such as the FWA who had been attacking the left militias on occasion while the government couldn't respond in a timely manner. Then the main topic of the discussion came up. This was a possible agreement for the left militias to support the Plaid Cymru. The militias had been told that they would start to receive some small amounts of support from the government. However, they would need to stop fighting the FWA if this agreement would pass.\n\nThankfully, the representatives from the left militias agreed on these terms and would agree to stop attacks on the FWA. As the members of the Left had left the city, the members of the government who had been sent to the meeting wondered if this was the best choice for Wales and its future."

wal.35.desc: "Isaac Palmer walked through the streets of Cardiff, it was raining and the mood was miserable. He had put up his umbrella and walked through the streets, the beeping of car horns had been loud as he walked down the streets. He was on his way to meet with a leader of a local union, along with being a newspaper owner, he was also one of the leaders of the Cardiff branch of the Left Militias that roamed around the country. If he remembered correctly, there hadn't been an attack on any of them yet for the past week by the FWA, so he was happy.\n\nAs he walked into the building where he had been told to meet the union leader there was no one there. Isaac was confused. He dropped his umbrella and opened his briefcase. Inside were many pamphlets about unions and leftism in general. However, below those papers was a pistol for protection against the thugs of the FWA. He thought about getting the pistol out just in case but decided against it. There are no armed FWA members all the way here in Cardiff, he thought. As he briskly walked through the building he found it abandoned. He was disappointed that the union leader had bailed on him so he decided to walk back outside and continue on his walk through Cardiff.\n\nOnce he got outside, a light was shone in his face immediately. He stumbled around the outside before a forceful arm grabbed his arm and pinned it behind his back. It was those pigs he thought..\n\n"I have rights to be doing this currently, you have no reason to arrest me!" He yelled this at the officers who had been arresting him. "Orders from the government, you militias have been a risk for too long" Isaac exhaled, realizing that fighting was stupid.\n\nAs he was led into the car by the constable, he swore he noticed a member of the FWA standing next to the police."

wal.36.desc: "It was early enough in the morning that it was still dark out in Wales. They had received their orders from the government itself instead of a general. They had been ordered to raid a suspected Free Wales Army safe house and arrest everyone on the inside of it. The goal was to get info on Julian Cayo-Evans, the ringleader of the group.\n\nAt the very break of dawn, the raid had begun, the doors had been kicked down and Welsh soldiers flooded into the house barking orders in both Welsh and English to the members of the FWA on the inside. There were many shouts from the FWA members who had dropped to the ground in shock and fear. A ripple of fear seemed to go through all of them. Who sold them out to the army? Was there a rat within their ranks? This would need to be answered later as they had been put in handcuffs and lead out to awaiting vans. After the FWA members had been lead to the vans and driven off to the prison, one of the constables and a partner walked through the house.\n\nOnce inside they had found all sorts of materials for bombs and improvised weapons. There was what seemed to be a homemade mortar that could have been used to launch attacks on left militia groups or even the local government. The two officers decided to leave it for the following investigative crew to arrive and then dissect the mortar and the rest of the house. As they had begun to walk up the stairs, something caught the eye of the lead constable. There was a map hidden beneath the stairs. Using the butt of his rifle, he smashed the wood and pulled out a map of locations of FWA safe houses across the country. He nodded and rolled it up, bringing it back to the station for analysis."

He grabbed the phone expecting to be barraged with information that could wait. However, once he heard the voice on the phone, his mood changed. An agreement had been reached within the party, no militias would be contacted.\n\nYet before this phone call inside the parliament building, MPs walked through the winding hallways of the building, constantly running papers and prepositions to one another. However within one of these rooms, one of the more heated conversations was taking place. Representatives from both sides of the political frankenstein that was the Plaid Cymru discussed the very actions that they would take. The more right-leaning side was very much for contacting the Free Wales Army to begun negotiations between the government and the FWA. The left however was very much against this as it would lead to a dangerous rise in Welsh Nationalism and possibly strain the fragile coalition even more. The groups worked for a solution for hours before the phone call had been made to Prime Minister Lewis. Solutions had been brought up and then promptly cut after more consideration. Ideas ranged from pitting the two groups against each other to nationalizing one and marking the other as an enemy to the state.\n\nOn both sides of the political spectrum, the MPs wondered if this debate would ever end. Then, one final idea had been proposed. The solution of letting the two groups had been brought up at the start but tossed to the side as it felt "to hands-off". After this was brought back up, the room was silent to think about the possible ramifications of this agreement. It was then voted on by the MPs, after just ten minutes, the government had reached an agreement. No interference in the militia conflicts."

While the government cannot yet fully indoctrinate children through the system, and while English influences are still visible and prominent the extend of this influence dwindles as the days go by. Books on English history and English folktales disappear from school library shelves.

This bill was to be the culmination of what they had strived towards ever since independence. It was to be the very symbol of a truly independent Wales.\n\nBut the bill was not without its opponents, as it was introduced to the house objections were already being voiced from the Unionist members, Goch members were also noticeably unenergetic with the bill. Seemingly unaware of this, the nationalist member continued to deliver his proposition:\n\n"Us nationalists have always seen conspiracies that seek to destroy the Welsh culture and tradition. It is with the essence of this vigilance against Welsh oppression that I put commend this ban on the teaching of the English language in Welsh schools. We do this to preserve our language and make ourselves invulnerable to the foreign deceit and desires of our neighbours."\n\nSeveral Unionist members arose from their seats to put forward a rebuttal, one was chosen and he glared down at the nationalist MP as he launched into his counter argument.\n\n"I beg to move that this Assembly asserts that the proposed bill is objectionable in principle and unfair and unworkable in practice. I, along with every other Unionist member of this Assembly, am of the belief that the problems it creates for pupils, teachers, and local governments will be far greater than the government is willing to let itself believe."\n\nThe atmosphere of the Assembly collapsed and rapidly became uncontrollable as both sides spat abuse towards one another. Scenes like these had never been seen before within the Assembly, though it was unlikely that they would not be witnessed again."

However, this has not helped to preserve much unity in the government, as both wings continued to tear each other apart over the bill.\n\nThe Prime Minister would not let his position on the matter remain unknown any longer, he could not bear to see his government constantly at odds with each other. He knew full well whichever side he chose would likely triumph.\n\nBut the losers would not take their defeat lightly.\n\nWith this in mind he stood before the Assembly and prepared to reveal which side had his support."

They started to become increasingly violent, clashing with some of their fellow members of the government, shouting and swearing as they surged toward Saunders himself.\n\nOther staunch nationalists left the chamber completely, vowing to exact revenge on the government.\n\nOpposite them, the Unionists remained mostly quiet as they watched the government benches descend into chaos.

They roared and revelled; bashing their shoes against the floor, drowning out the unionists in their vulgar cacophony.\n\nThe fact that this display glaringly breached assembly tradition did not seem to phase them.\n\nMembers of the Goch were most appalled by the Prime Minister's decision to support the bill, some even left the chamber to display their disgust.

Cayo had personally written and sent a note to the Prime Minister's office in an attempt to persuade him into supporting the bill.\n\nHe discovered the note on his desk and cautiously picked it up. The writing was scrawled haphazardly across the page, the scribbles were so illegible that he had to take a seat before he could begin to decipher the message.\n\nAfter a few minutes spent painfully translating the note, it was clear to the PM that it was a threat. The Hardliners were prepared to withdraw their support from the government if he did not support the bill.\n\nNow he had to choose what was more important to him: the preservation of the National Front or the unity of the country."

Most were inclined to believe them; they feared for the future of the National Front.\n\nYet the rest of the government held their line and called Cayo's bluff.\n\nTheir gamble has appeared to have worked as the threatened retaliation has failed to appear. Cayo's men have continued to support the government.

Fear followed too. The people believed they were more exposed to such acts of violence now than they had been for the past two decades.\n\nLittle was known about the perpetrators until a forbidding statement emerged from a group that called itself the Free Wales Army. The group claimed responsibility for the bombing and made clear its disdain for the failure of the government to pass the Welsh Language Bill.\n\nDespite the scale of the attacks, the group itself remains elusive to the government.

The largely Unionist parts of the country were practically up in arms over the fact that the government was willing to remove English from the national curriculum.\n\nHowever this was not the concern of the Prime Minister, his job was to get this bill passed, some bitter Unionists were not going to stop him.\n\nBut even the PM was still nervous about what the result might be, as he could not be sure of the true intentions of each of the members of his government. And if the bill failed his whole government would be endangered. Knowing this, he only became more anxious as the vote drew nearer. His anxiousness continued as he reentered the chamber and sat down and began to await the result.\n\nIt did not take long for the result to be declared and much to the Prime Minister's relief, the bill had passed and by the narrowest of margins.

The government is now at odds with its people and the Prime Minister will not be able to turn a blind eye much longer.\n\nHe will have to address the situation, though he has not yet made up his mind on how he will do this.

Many within Plaid have already surrendered to the idea that the government is doomed. As one unnamed minister was overheard frantically yelling:\n\n"We're going to lose our fucking government!"\n\nThe press is not expected to get any better after that.\n\nThe government's issues have certainly caused an enormous amount of uproar across Wales. Which has caused the disarray that has gripped the government these past few months to seep into the rest of public life. The crisis has begun much sooner than was anticipated. The minister responsible will have to answer to the people they supposedly serve, if what seems to have occured is true, their rule of deception will be brought down with them.\n\nAnd to think that they had all thought that it was over."

wal.106.desc: "Plaid Cymru has had its reputation permanently tarnished by the crisis. Those who still remain loyal to the party have started to look for ways to try and salvage what credibility they can. The plan that they decided on was an attempt to conceal Saunders' role in the cover up and presenting him as a trusted leader, who was independent from the dirty work that others had carried out.\n\nThe best way to present this had already been decided by the party, an interview between the Prime Minister and interviewer from one of the few media outlets that had remained indifferent to Plaid Cymru. An interview had already been scheduled as soon as possible. All that remains to be done is to inform Saunders himself.\n\nUpon being told of the plan Saunders was quietly startled, he had not been expecting to have to be put back into the public eye so soon, especially after such a crisis had unfurled. After hearing the date of the broadcast he only felt more anxious. For once Saunders appeared to dread having to talk to the people of Wales."
wal.106.a: "We wish him luck."
wal.107.t: "An Innocent Man"
wal.107.desc: "It was just another interview with the press. At least that is what Prime Minister Saunders tried to convince himself. In reality he dreaded that what he was about to endure was going to be the worst public appearance of his career. Yet he knew that he had to get through it, for the sake of his credibility and his party.\n\nThe interviewer finished addressing the audience and all to soon leapt into questioning the Prime Minister:\n\n"We are all aware of the crisis that has developed over the last few days, but were you involved in any way with the initial response to the investigation's findings and its subsequent cover up?"\n\n"Not at all," came the uncharacteristically short reply; Saunders left it at that.\n\nThe rest of the interview continued in a similar fashion, with the reporter asking increasingly probing questions and Saunders stubbornly refusing to answer in any detail. Deny everything, tell them nothing.\n\nWhen an aide asked Saunder how he thought it all went he shrugged and muttered in a low voice."

wal.108.desc: "A crisis as serious as this was bound to divide Wales in one way or another. Theories have already started to be reported on groups from across the world and political spectrum conspiring to bring Wales down for increasingly absurd reasons. Many of these have not had any noticeable impact, but one that has started to gain traction is the idea that somehow the socialists were involved.\n\nThe theory explains how they attempted to cover up the coal shortage to keep the miners underground. When the government reports investigation returned they sent men disguised in suits to remove whatever evidence they could find. Fortunately a forward thinking member of the government was able to release the truth.\n\nIn fact it has been such an influential theory that it has reached government offices. Pinning the blame on the Goch and trade unionists would cause enough confusion to clear our own name. A government statement was produced indicating Gwynfor Evans and every other influential socialist in the government.\n\nFollowing the release of the statement, the Goch is expected to remove themselves from their position in our government, greatly weakening our authority. Our government will not be expected to last much longer.\n\nAt least we are not the only ones that are accused."

Yet that is where the party has ended up, in order to survive the party will have to sacrifice one of our own.\n\nWidespread shock followed on from Evans being kicked from the party. Shocked was replaced by anger as the Welsh demanded to know how Evans was allowed to operate such a scheme. How could a split this bad have emerged in the party in the first place? Did he act alone or does he still have subordinates working in the government?\n\nThey demanded answers.\n\nAnswers the government did not have.\n\nThose who remained in the government hoped it had not all been in vain. Yet it all seemed to be getting worse."

Framing them for the cover up would alienate them further from ever becoming a serious part of Welsh politics. Moreover, Cayo and the rest of his gang are a mad enough group that most people would believe that they would attempt a move that was so ridiculous. So the government went ahead with the plan to accuse the FWA.\n\nWhat took place after the accusation only made things worse for Plaid Cymru.\n\nThe people were alarmed by how far the FWA got and how they were almost allowed to get away with what they did. The government failed to clear its role in the cover up and was only able to make the FWA appear far more competent than was previously thought.\n\nAfter consistently failing to find a way out of the crisis, few reckon that the government will last much longer. What comes next is likely to be as chaotic as what came before it."

Now that he has been proven right, he has to sit still whilst all that he helped to build up crumbles around him.\n\nWith the socialists out of the picture, it was unlikely that any of the other members of the National Front Saunders had worked so hard to form were going to stay. Plaid Cymru would stand alone, paralyzed in a minority government. Limping towards what everyone in Wales assumes will be its downfall."

Morale within the government has been shattered, many ministers have started to refuse to even turn up to the Assembly, but Saunders soldiers on, even as he becomes increasingly isolated.\n\nDay after day he has to face their anger. Accusations lying cheating and causing the crisis follow him throughout his days. He has become tired of having to repeat the same denials again and again, every time he does so it only seems to make them angrier and more intent on bringing him down.\n\nOne day he supposed he would be the only one left denying what had happened.\n\nUntil that imagined day came he would have to continue wading through the mess he created. The ministers that still gather in the Assembly wonder how long the Prime Minister will force himself to continue."

But instead of the cheers of the passed, all that could be heard were the enraged roars of a people betrayed. They had made up their mind. They did not believe what Saunders had told them.\n\nThey wanted him out.\n\nIt was not just the people of Cardiff who wanted Saunders gone, the rumors of his trickery had spread far and hide. The anger is less directed at the coal and more and more at the crisis in and of itself. The people knew what he had allowed to happen and they were not prepared to forgive him.\n\nAnd who could blame them.\n\nMost members of the public now viewed him with disdain and without the respect of the Welsh people, how could he claim to be their leader."

They believe that the time has come for them to put it down for good.\n\nA vote of no confidence has already been called.\n\nA vote that the government is bound to lose.\n\nThis will be a decision that is going to be welcomed by many. The sheer size of the protests on the streets of Cardiff demonstrated that.

The result had been a forgone conclusion before the vote itself had even been called. Everyone in Wales knew it was over for Saunders.\n\nPlaid Cymru will now be at the mercy of the voters, who are expected to be as unforgiving as the opposition were. It will not be long before Plaid will be removed from the Assembly completely.\n\nIt is expected that Saunders' party will never be able to recover.

His judgements have been rash and ineffectual.\n\nDespite all the confusion, he had never meant for the situation to end up like this. With Wales practically brought to its knees because of the coal crisis, a crisis which he could not help but feel largely to blame for.\n\nHis role in the doomed coverup that ensued did not help ease his guilt. Because of all his failures, he would almost certainly be removed from power.\n\nHe already believed his time was up.\n\nNow, as he resigned to his inevitable demise, Saunders finally had time to reflect. He wondered if it could have gone differently; if he could have held the National Front together, if he could have come clean over the crisis; if he could have held onto the trust of the Welsh people.\n\nBut in the end he could only ask himself one question:"

Gently tipping the balance here and there, in order to preserve his government. He was already submerged in corruption, why should he not continue along the path he set out for himself?\n\nOr maybe this is all too far, thought Saunders.\n\nIf he was caught again he would certainly become even more infamous. His cause would also become permanently damaged, tainted by his involvement. Welsh nationalism would likely never recover. It would be better for the sake of the nationalists if he finally took a step away from his position.\n\nYet it was the Prime Minister who ultimately decided who would determine the future of Wales."

"We are a nation of Welshmen," he said, "and that means we must fully cast off the shackles of Anglo tyranny, not allowing our children, our children! to be subjected to cultural violence. Welsh now, Welsh forever."\n\nThe accusations of violence didn't fly with the Unionists, as MP Nicholas Edwards called Cayo a "divisive Hitlerist who seeks to relegate all his enemies to the status of sub-human. We say no to fascism on our shores." As the debate continues, the language bill will likely fall further and further into the background, as the battle lines divide "nationalists" from everyone else, whether they prefer the title of liberal, anti-fascist, or Unionist.

Even if he could not officially call himself a Unionist, it was not yet a crime to support their aims. But the upcoming March had left him sleepless and sweating the past few nights, and he wanted to do whatever he could if it meant Cayo and his thugs backed down. Right now, that meant following Jerry's orders, and giving flyers out to anyone who needed them.\n\nAs the stack wore thin, Harry was prepared to report back to the Club, maybe head over to the Lion's Den after.

Would he already be a martyr for the cause?\n\nAs it turned out, this was not Harry's final day. Multiple passers-by tried to break up the group, who managed to scramble away before anything else could happen.

Ostensibly organized by pro-Union "Peace Clubs", the counter-demonstrators are far from just gentle liberals. Various radical unions have come down to join in the struggle, alongside militants waving communist flags and the black-clad members of the recently established Cardiff Anti-Fascist Club. Even erstwhile socialist MP Raymond Williams is said to be among their ranks. The confrontations at these barricades have so far been relegated to aggressive shouting matches, but with passions being sky-high all it will take is one spark to blow up. We can't preside over a bloodbath on our streets.\n\nTypically, our response to confrontations like these is a strong police presence. They are generally expected to show up, and are skilled in non-violent tactics, so using them as peacekeepers seems like it can only deescalate things. However, some of our advisors have pointed out that there are credible reports of some demonstrators carrying projectiles and firearms, and the police may not be enough to keep order. Following this logic, they argue for a military presence to have these demonstrators back down. Clearly demonstrating our firepower seems like it would make anyone think twice about violence.

Before him stood who were meant to be the brightest, most competent men in Wales. And what were they offering while the capital burned? Two options seemingly equal in their awfulness, inadequate solutions to a disaster they completely failed to contain.\n\nOne of his top commanders, here in this bunker due to the unprecedented circumstances, argued for the preferred military solution burn it all down. "Our soldiers have been beaten back despite the rifles and armor we all entrust them with. This is no undisciplined rabble we face. Our only fallback in times like these is the firepower our forces have to overwhelm the enemy. If you allow me, sir, there are two artillery companies that can be stationed on either side of this city. One command, and the chaos will end."\n\nEmrys Thomas and Julian Cayo, despite having very different views of just what was happening outside, were for perhaps the only time in agreement on what action the government should take. In the name of "protecting innocent patriots" and "avoiding the slaughter of workers," the two men jointly recommended withdrawing the armed military and police from the site of protest, removing what they called "an invitation to fight violently".\n\nRemaining barely composed, Lewis weighed these two deeply questionable choices.

See, that's the thing about being in these struggles, you know before everyone else when violence is inevitable. When the shit started raining down, I was in an alleyway, cleaning my hands. Just sent off someone, don't even know who they were, but I had them placed on a stretcher. The fighting was mostly in the central part of the city, I was a bit south. I heard these, sounded like a shotgun kinda in the distance. Then, right by me--boom! Black-grey-orange rupture tearing through my ears like a wounded bulldog, or maybe a thunderclap.

For some, it seemed surreal that something like sunset could still occur when the entire day was marked by ceaseless horror, the wholesale annihilation of peace and normality.\n\nThe engulfing darkness hardly covered up the hundreds of fires, the streaking light of rifle fire, or the searing shouts on every block. As families tried to rest their children in total darkness, avoiding even the slightest give-away of human life, nearby homes were torn through so that gunmen could set up sniper nests in attics. As pub owners rushed to barricade their business, sheltering civilians if they're brave, long-standing corner stones saw themselves burnt away by Zhdanov cocktails, proxies for the malfeasance of the Welsh state.\n\nRegardless of these nightmarish travails, a broader survey would reveal a bend towards deescalation. Ramping up of violence also meant potentially thousands of protesters fleeing for their lives, with even some of the most aggressive partisans preferring to shelter far from the city center rather than risk dying on Cardiff's streets. But this hardly mattered to those in the presence of such conflict. Dealing with gunfire and a lessened contingent of angry radicals makes no difference if your bedroom window is shattered by a shotgun shell, or you have a bleeding college student show up on your doorstep.

Even die-hards set to lay down their life for the causes of anti-fascism or Welsh nationalism began to question whether they should stay put. Few envision the slow burning of flesh among dozens of others as a death deserving of a martyr. As whole blocks became swallowed up by the advancing wall of dancing orange, the city finally emptied out. Those on the outskirts of the city, no longer party to the sounds of conflict, could rest. Inside the city's center, the constant scramble to get out alive simply gained a new, cruel urgency. For just this moment, the nation's political division mattered not, subsumed by the universal fear of death.\n\nBy morning, the city that was the battleground for Wales soul, its shining beacon of prosperity and freedom, was no more. The historic metropolis was charred to a crisp, countless homes, businesses, and pieces of history reduced to ash.

So a lot of what they talked about was related to that, a lot of the rhetoric regarding destroying unionism, killing commies, you know what they say they'll do. But I was in some flat more on the edges of the city, we were up to watch for any incoming army. Captain was saying we'd blow anyway who came in away, and I was just like, seriously? Our twenty-year olds with their shitty pipe rifles are gonna blow them away?\n\nWe heard those fire trucks, and Captain was going crazy, saying, "this is it men, the final battle, let's stop them here." These are fucking firemen! Public servants, and he wanted to kill them. So I stood up, and I said, captain, I will not fire on those firefighters. If you order that, I will leave. He did his typical gruff act, said to get in position, but then some o' the other boys started agreeing with me, one even said his older brother might be among the firefighters. The captain kept pushing, and I was done with listening, so I stuck my gun right up to his head, told him I'd shoot if he sent out some order. I've never seen a man break down so quick! Next thing I knew, he handed me the radio and told me to send out an all-call to tell units they should hold their fire and stand down to the firemen. I won't take all the credit, plenty of smart boys came to their senses at that moment. But I helped, and the fires eventually were dealt with."

Regardless, however, those were men and women with a mission, and as the cover of smoke and ash became denser, and the man put upon their gas masks, they knew they were getting close to the heart of the inferno.\n\nThe Firetruck came to a stop, and almost rhythmically to the sound of distant gunshots, did the men brave out to douse the inferno around them."

And as one of them, busy with helping a woman up, was struck with a bullet in his chest, did the Firefighters realize they were fighting a losing fight.\n\nWith a heart weightened by guilt and desperation, they returned to the trucks and moved away from the inferno, the pleas of anger and desperation fading in the background, but echoing in their heads, the glazed stare of their fallen one haunting them now, and possibly for years to come.\n\nThey've done their best, haven't they?

Why did they let it go this bad? It wasn't their fault, they were simply firefighters but they, as the Welsh people, have fundamentally failed themselves.\n\nAs the fighting through the night dwindled to little, and each man returned home, one simple thought kept repeating in their heads: That there simply was no rational reason to justify what happened this day."

To this, Carwyn worked up just enough courage to ask if anything is worth a declaration of war on Welshmen. Everything hinged on this: it was time to decisively take control."

cardiffmarch.34.desc: "The group thought it would just be them, a five-person masked contingent kicking down the doors to the Senedd and tearing it to shreds, taking down their whole haughty edifice as punishment for the government's crimes. Instead, as they called to take the buildings hundred charged in behind them. Angela, looking behind her, noticed a menagerie of types; policemen shedding their uniforms, old women with pistols, young men with brass knuckles. As the crowd tore through the building's diminutive windows and ornate doorways, the looting of this palace began. Statues were knocked down, paintings ripped apart, tables flipped over. Angela gestured to her friends to travel downstairs, down a winding cement staircase. As they closed in, she whispered to them rumors of a hidden bunker, where Lewis and his cronies would be hiding. With the raising of her fist, Angela began the charge towards this alleged bunker.\n\nHours later, when the whole Senedd was ravaged to reveal hastily evacuated bunkers and smashed out windows still fresh with the blood of those poor sods trying to escape, Angela and her comrades from the Anti-Fascist Club sat in the opulent banquet hall, taking just enough shots of the three-hundred year old bourbon to loosen up, but not soften their edges. Hundreds still remained in the Senedd, and one of the comrades began cracking up, saying that Wales really did belong to the people and not just fat pricks with bad taste in art. That was when they started hearing sirens.\n\nHow long had it been? How long had these radicals been occupying the halls of power? Once again taking initiative, Angela called on her comrades and anyone nearby to take up positions that had line of sight on different entryways. Minutes later, when the haphazard welcoming committee took up positions, the attack started. The dozens of seasoned radicals hunkered down..."

"Everyone, fall back, get out of here, they're armed--"\n\nA quick succession of shots rang out. Before she could even turn her head to look at its origin, the Senedd was turned into a warzone. Angela ran over to Dominic, a longtime ally in the struggle, knowing he had a revolver on him. Upon reaching him, he started moving with her to an exit. These criminals, she thought, trying to slaughter us for exposing their lies.\n\nThe two moved carefully, having lost sight of some of the other comrades. No matter how hard they tried, the worst assumptions immediately came to mind. All around them, the Senedd was being ripped apart, hi-caliber fire from the military men drowning out the sporadic bangs of civilian-owned revolvers. Moving as liquid, they flowed through the stairway, the corridors, avoiding any sign of the black-clad troops. Finally they saw it; a small but shattered window, a few feet above where they stood. In quick succession, the two vaulted up the wall and squeezed their way out of the narrow frame, crashing against the pavement as they came out. For a few minutes, the two sat and looked into the darkly beautiful spectacle of those ravaged halls of government. But soon, they opted to run off, maybe even run out of this city, this country. Because already they knew in their hearts it had spilled the blood of their comrades to sustain itself."

Then, the hiss of smoke, an absolute obfuscation of everything physical nearby. She tried yelling to her comrades, to anyone, but could hardly move without feeling a harsh gravitational shove. So she did all she could do: lie down and wait for what was coming.\n\nOne hour later, Angela found herself lined up on a wall, next to longtime ally Dominic, and about a dozen strangers who'd followed them into the Senedd. Angela still felt her head swimming, still felt the throbbing pain in her back from when the soldiers manhandled her. She tried turning to Dominic, tried to get perspective from a fellow comrade. This attempt at communication was rapidly met by a boot to the face. With everyone on the wall restrained, the could merely watch and shout as Angela writhed in pain. Finally, the hulking commando in front of them spoke. Not to those he had just restrained, but to his radio.\n\n"Everything is under control. Minimal casualties, Senedd has been cleared out. Military is on their way to pick 'em up, until the police get their shit together and process them." His deliberate, terse pronouncement was quickly met with a reply.\n\n"Wonderful.

Yes, there were shattered windows and burnt-out businesses, but those edifices could be rebuilt. The true losses of such violent moments were few and far between.\n\nThe occasional FWA soldier could be found lying dead in an alleyway, multiple gunshots to the torso. Perhaps a few college students could be found as well, still wearing the bandanas they'd brought to hide their identity. However, few of the state's agents were to be found; for the police, the firemen, this was a resounding success. They could go home and celebrate their victory, the "non-violent" conclusion to the Cardiff March. For those in the halls of power, this could not have ended better. Yet as always, they succeeded on the backs of the young and desperate, leaving dozens of families to bury their children."

The good news was that everything had calmed down. For better or worse...it was over, and now that it was over, they could move forward as a people and nation.\n\nIt would be short, but in some cases, shortness was best. At a nod from Lewis, and the light on the camera turning red, the address began. "People of Wales," he began, keeping his voice steady, if somber. "It is no secret that we are in dangerous, and troubling times right now. We all know what has happened - but I can assure you, the worst is over."\n\nHe let the pause linger. "I would like to express my personal thanks to the brave men of Wales who stepped up and acted before the situation could worsen. I would also like to express my condolences to all who were affected, no matter who they were. This is a tragedy for our nation, but one we can move beyond."\n\n"The worst has passed," he continued. "And now that it has passed, we must come together. As a nation. As a people. We must move past this period of anger and division, and look to a brighter future. It will be difficult for all of us, but it is critical that we heal, else this tragedy will be repeated one day."\n\nIt was almost over now, and while it was just a start, hopefully it would be what the people needed to hear right now.

Us two grieving families had no room to judge. Maybe an hour or two passed by, then suddenly there were ten different families sitting around the wall, all trying to figure out what had happened. We all named our kids, told their stories, tried to heal. Then we named their killers. So I, and the rest of us, made two promises at that point: we will never forget those whom we lost, and we will never forgive those who stole them from us.

Where was everyone, which one of the screaming, vomiting souls around here came in with me...\n\nWhen she came to, the pain was just as bad as it was in the Senedd. A crushing, pulsating sensation dominated her upper body, worsening as she slightly turned her head to investigate the surroundings. She barely managed to catch sight of the crude cement walls, the industrial strength, light green door in front, and the four strangers surrounding her. Instead, these blurred images faded away as she screamed out in pain, once again melting time and space away as her cellmates began to clamor.\n\nOnce again, she came to from a void, and she remained in the same place. But this time, the pain was lighter, her head more mobile. Slowly rising up, she looked to the disheveled young woman standing over her. "Where...what happen--"\n\n"Some Cardiff station.

The new government knows, however, that this is not the end of the struggle for socialism in Wales. Plaid Cymru is sure to try to discredit the "splitters" on every turn, and the spectre of fascism, already looming over the entirety of the Isles, is present domestically in the form of the Free Wales Army.\n\nDespite all these problems, Prime Minister Emrys Thomas is confident in his and his government's ability to weather the storm and build a new, more equal and just Wales, for the benefit and happiness of all."

Gwynfor Evans, former Minister of Finance in the Plaid Cymru government, delivered a short protestatory speech after the vote had passed.\n\n"Leave the free market alone! All you socialists and communists want to do is regulate, regulate and regulate once again. When it comes to media, the market itself is the best form of regulation!

Some even say that our reforms will lead to dictatorship, poverty and strife, but I ask this of you, dear Welshmen - do not listen to these voices of discontent! I will not deceive you, however - the way towards our new homeland will be long and sometimes arduous, but our values of democracy, liberty and equality will lead us, and the Cymru we will all build will be beautiful indeed!

Thundering applause filled the hall, and he felt the terrible chains of stress breaking. In that instant, he was overjoyed and wholly focused on the task ahead. So focused, in fact, that he did not see the disgusted and irritated faces of his opponents - nor did he pick up on their half-hearted applause.

His mind was focused on other things, however - breaking through the loud sounds of the bus' engine and the city itself was an uncertainty which stabbed right into his heart like a needle. It was his first day in the newly-founded WBC, and he got quite possibly the most stressful job in the entire bloody establishment - presenting a live news programme. While David was no stranger to journalism, and his rugby commentaries won him a fair bit of respect and popularity among those who cared about such things, this job was wildly different. It's one thing to commentate a rugby match in a radio broadcast, but another thing entirely to present the news on live television, where body language, clarity and confidence is paramount. No more comfortable radio booths and pure voice-work for him, he thought.\n\nWBC's newest employee would continue on drowning himself in anxiety and excitement, perhaps, if not for the conductor's loud announcement of "WBC Studios Station!" The shout ripped David out of his thoughts, making him stand right up and jump right out of the bus in a manner some would have called "terribly impolite". He had no time for politeness, however, as looking at his watch he realized that the time for his broadcast was fast approaching. Storming straight into the lobby, he hung his coat and headed right for the studio. After only the tiniest amount of last-minute (literally) prep-work, he was planted firmly in the presenter's chair, opening up a new era in Welsh media with "Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to warmly welcome you to Wales Today, the WBC's premiere news programme...""

The occasional moderate, proposer of "dialogue" and "understanding" was quickly shot down by more passionate MPs, who were several magnitudes louder than their more cool-headed colleagues. Some parliamentarians, when faced with the possibility of loss in debate, let their fists do the talking for them, and had to be escorted out of the building. Prime Minister Emrys observed the hall with a mixture of disbelief, sadness, irritation and amusement. He knew that the bill would be controversial, but he didn't anticipate such a radical response! His thoughts drifted into questions of "why am I here" and "what led us to this point" before he was taken out of it by the sound of a hammer hitting a wooden desk and a stern voice shouting "Order! Order! I will have order!" That seemed to calm the fires burning in the Assembly, as it suddenly became quiet. Embarrassed parliamentarians meekly came back to their seats, although they still eyed their rivals down with anger.\n\n"Now, we shall continue on with the vote," - the Assembly Speaker said - "if the honourable Sirs and Madams would see it fit to allow it, of course." As expected, Plaid Cymru members unanimously opposed the bill, while the Cymru Goch and Communist Party voted in its favour.

Have you forgotten about the war? About its outcome? We are the smallest nation on the Isles, and Germany is the victor of the greatest war in humanity's history. This isn't a diplomatic game between equals - this is the equivalent of a beggar talking with a king. For our own sake, we should deepen ties with Germany - we cannot risk war coming to Wales, not yet."\n\nThe debate continued through the night, courteous and polite language long since thrown away in favor of blunt honesty. Raymond Williams' belligerent stance lost supporters as quickly as it gained them, with only two options remaining - Horner's status quo and Niclas y Glais' appeasement. After much deliberation, the government decided to..."

Cardiff had grown to quite the beauty, he thought, as he took in the cool evening air. Not just Cardiff, he added - the entirety of Wales. He had seen it firsthand - happy workers, offering heartfelt thanks and promises of support. Thousands of new cars, brought here by the ever-increasing prosperity of the people. He read it in the announcements and newspapers of the labor unions. He heard it from his own ministers.\n\nOf course, it wasn't perfect - things had to be done to secure this new order, things he would've found repulsive otherwise, and for all his efforts, he couldn't possibly right every wrong and injustice.\n\nBut that wasn't important, not in that moment, at least."

goch.16.desc: ""In order to ensure continued economic prosperity and stability of the Republic, the strategic industries of our nation are to be nationalized and reorganized into centrally-controlled and regulated businesses, producing goods explicitly for the greater societal good instead of the interests of private capital. The government seeks to guarantee employment and fair compensation for Welsh labourers through preventing potential mine closures or the acquisition of Welsh natural and industrial wealth by foreign capital."\n\n"The industrial spheres marked for nationalization are: Coal and Iron Mining, Steel, Energy and Vehicle Production as well as Railroad Transport and the Defence Industry."\n\n"Owners of companies operating in the above-mentioned sectors will be granted just recompense by the Government."\n\nArthur Horner put down the legislation draft and smirked at Thomas and Williams.\n\n"Pretty nice, eh?

Some have recently petitioned the station to broadcast a national debate with the country's leading political figures and parties in a debate, which the Welsh Broadcasting Channel accepted, along with the politicians willing to join in representation of their ideologies.\n\nThe representatives include the Cymru Goch which is currently in government, the Communist Party, the Welsh Liberal Party, a representative of the Independent "Unionists", and Plaid Cymru, which used to dominate Welsh politics post-independence.\n\nAlready the nation has been anxious to see this debate air, and some have even started betting who would win the debate."

goch.1700.desc: "As the debate folds, the polls show an expected result for many of those watching, a win for Cymru Goch.\n\nThe Party took serious and lengthy speeches on the state of the Welsh economy, criticizing its harshness towards workers, its decline, and its mismanagement by the previous government, all while promoting the achievements that the Cymru Goch Government was able to achieve.\n\nIt also criticised the other parties such as the radicalness of the Communist Party, the Liberal Party being the party of the rich and bourgeoisie, the Unionist Independents as imperialists and only serving to oppress the Welsh as collaborators to the English, and the Plaid Cymru taking the brunt of the offenses, from the authoritarianism, to Cayos' influence within it, to its horrible mismanagement of the economy.\n\nAs the papers roll in with the reports, members of Cymru Goch celebrate, knowing they have secured a crucial success in the polls."

goch.1701.desc: "Many gamblers lost their money today, as the polls closed for the recent political debate, and the announcements proclaiming the Welsh Liberal Party as the winner of the debate.\n\nThe Liberals were able to win on the basis towards creating fear of "Socialist Control" of Wales with the Cymru Goch coming into power, anti-authoritarian speeches, and excessive government involvement in the economy.\n\nThey criticised the ruling Cymru Goch of trying to take over the economy for the government against the people, the Communist Party was smeared as trying to establish a "Bukharanite Dictatorship", the Unionists as English bootlickers, and Plaid Cymru as pretending to free the Welsh people, only to oppress them afterwards.\n\nAs many did not expect this development, it seems the Liberals have outdone themselves, with some newspapers seeing them as a new contender for power in Wales."

goch.1702.t: "The Communists Win the Debate"
goch.1702.desc: "In a radical development, the polls to the debate closed to the announcement that the Communist Party has won the debate, shocking many.\n\nThe Communists were thought to be a small force who no-one in the debate took seriously, but it backfired, as the Communists spoke furiously about the continual exploitation of Wales and its resources by the capitalists, and the horrid condition Welsh workers experience in the factories and coal mines.\n\nThey ranted over Cymru Goch having a cover of socialism while still going through with the capitalist system, the Liberals were called out as the party of the bourgeoisie, the Unionists, unsurprisingly, as imperialists, English nationalists, and traitors to the working class of Wales, and finally Plaid Cymru, who collaborated and continued to work with the despicable Germans, and led Wales down a dark path.\n\nThe Communist Party responded to their success as a start of class consciousness for the workers of Wales, and the start of the end of capitalism in Wales."

Through shrewd diplomacy and economic aptitude, we have forged a friendship which is not only very lucrative, but has also brought our countries together and led to greater social and cultural understanding. While migration between our countries is mostly limited to upper-class individuals crossing the Irish Sea there-and-back-again in order to conduct business, the free flow of trade caused by the agreement has caused an extreme spike in interest in Irish culture, both contemporary and historical. Homes and libraries are getting filled with Irish books and legends while Irish (or at least "Irish-inspired") pubs pop up everywhere in our ities. The same has apparently happened in Ireland, with Welsh paintings, songs and literature finding an ever-expanding, soon-to-be-mainstream (if our analysts are to be trusted) niche."

Yet despite this monotonous backdrop, inside the government buildings something not at all insignificant is happening.\n\nAn idea long discussed, now finally set in motion: the creation of a team to oversee dealings with the coal industry. The Industrial Reform Committee will be the government's platform for ethically dealing with the coal industry and the myriad of related organisations.\n\nThe focus of the newly birthed IRC's opening moves is quite straightforward: the multitudinous unions in the many fields in the coal industry. The only way for the government to achieve its goal of weakening this almost all-powerful industry is dependent on the support of these unions. From there, it is simpler. The Welsh economy must be freed from the death grip of the sinking coal industry before it drags the whole economy under. In order to do so, the industry must be weakened by opening other industries to loosen the hold of coal. But before any of that can be achieved, the unions must be convinced to support the government."
goch.20.a: "Let's get to work."
goch.21.t: "Meeting with the Unions"
goch.21.desc: "If the Welsh government is to achieve its goal of prying Wales free from the choke hold it requires support from two different sources. Getting the people of Wales onboard should be easy, a mass propaganda campaign would do the trick. Getting the coal industry unions to support the government however, is nowhere near as simple. Afterall, the men these unions represent depend on the coal industry for their livelihoods. A man who has mined his whole life cannot easily find another occupation. The IRC must tread lightly around the unions. This meeting with the biggest players and most influential unions is the first move.\n\n"Well that wasn't so bad," Davies remarks as he leaves the meeting with the union leaders, his fellow committee members filing out after him. "I think we've convinced a few of them."\n\n"Convinced? They were walking out halfway through!"\n\n"Yes but those were radicals, extremists. They would never have agreed to anything we had to say anyway. It's better that they left now so we know who we can actually work with. I'm certain that the rest will support our plan, either immediately or with some concessions and a little persuasion.""

Not for those men who spend hours in the darkest depths of the earth, performing back breaking labour to fulfil the quotas and orders of the mine's overseers only to line the pockets of the owners and investors. The quotas ordered are, more often than not, unreasonable and exploitive of the miners.\n\nBut no longer. For from this day the government, at the behest of the IRC, has banned any and all harsh quotas. No longer can the mine owners exploit their workers by giving them outrageous, unreachable goals.\n\nThe miners are celebrating in the streets, in the pubs in their homes. For today their burdens have lessened ever so slightly. The quotas may still be extreme, but less so. Their mine owners may be furious at this drop in productivity, but that isn't their problem. They may still live difficult lives, they may still struggle to provide for their families, to put food on their tables, but for this brief moment they are joyous, grateful to the government for looking out for them. No matter what the future brings, today is a good day."

goch.23.desc: "A poster on every street. A speech on every radio. A newsreel on every theatre show. The tried and tested methods of propaganda, both consciously and unconsciously swaying public opinion towards a certain direction. In this case, that direction is simple. The government needs popular support amongst the people. On paper, these methods would gather that support by bombarding the populace with pro-government messages so that wherever they go there will always be some form of propaganda.\n\nIn practice however, is a completely different question.\n\nEmrys Thomas sighs heavily, looking over the reports delivered to gos desk. It would seem the Welsh psyche is much more resistant than his advisors first thought. Rather than convincing the people to lend their support to the government, it appears that this massive propaganda effort has expended itself to no avail."

If ever the party would have been shattered and fallen it would've been then. But the Cymru Goch party has pulled through, passing reform after reform in the hopes and dreams of a better Wales. They have rode through the coal crisis, and improved the lives of Welsh workers to levels previously unheard of.

Now, Emrys Thomas must address the nation.\n\n"To the people of Wales, I must thank you for all your support through this process. It has not been easy. But now, we stand amidst a great achievement. Wales is now ready to be a part of the world economy, to be open to all the world for greater prosperity for all both at home and abroad!

A completely fair feeling in this world, especially given Wales' dangerously close proximity to Germany and all the safety concerns that come with that. They have approached us with an interesting request: weapons. Arms and ammunition are arguably the most important and valuable goods in the current world situation. Wales wants them, we have them and Wales is willing to pay for them. Wales has proven to be no close friend of the Germans and supporting a European democracy may help to further our influence in Europe. However, it must be taken into consideration that these weapons could be used in direct opposition to our goals. Not to mention that any meddling in European affairs like this runs the risk of bringing German attention to it, and we can't be having that."

The Americans have agreed to the deal we proposed to them, and the weapons we have purchased are well on the way to our armories. We should hope that they never are needed, but hope alone is no defence. Especially not in this uncaring world order. Much better to have hope and a large arsenal."

If we are to defend ourselves we will need to search elsewhere for the means to do so. With the chaos engulfing this harsh world, weapons may become even more of a necessity. We will need to look for other opportunities to acquire the means to protect our nation and now, it becomes even more important that we practice intelligent diplomacy to ward off any attacks."

A passerby may not remark on or even notice any sort of difference between this building and the many building surrounding it were it not for a few rather major differences: heightened security with guards bearing the obvious look and bearing of wary foreigners in a strange land, barred windows and reinforced doors and, most prominent and obvious of all the signs, a flag: the Welsh dragon flying high and proud above the building.\n\nThis building is none other than the Welsh embassy in Dublin, part of the Welsh government's program of outreach in the Isles in an attempt to foster cooperation towards the peripheral countries of the British Isles."

goch.28.t: "A Matter of Military Importance"
goch.28.desc: ""...and as you well know, the Welsh military is inadequate to defend properly against any threats that we face, especially the English menace. As such, it would be within the best interests of the Welsh nation to fund and arm two more divisions for the army in order to ensure security and sovereignty in light of the recent events in England."\n\nEmrys Thomas has had quite enough of the military's convoluted requests for increased funding, increased weapons, increased manpower. But maybe this time his generals have a point. Europe is a chaotic and dangerous place and these are uncertain times. Any sort of extra defence would be very welcome. However, such defences are by no means free and the money and other resources required could most definitely find good use elsewhere."

walunion.1.desc: ""It is with great gratitude for the voters of Wales that I take the position of Prime Minister today." began John Morris, in the midst of an excitable fervor.\n\n"Like my honorable friend Emrys Thomas, I endeavour at all times to do whatever i can to benefit all the people within Wales. As some of the more astute among you may have noticed, me and Mr. Thomas do indeed differ considerably in our preferred methods of bringing about such improvements. But there is not a shadow of a doubt in my mind when I say that I do believe Thomas will provide an excellent opposition on the benches across from my own," he announced as he gestured to the leader of the Goch opposite him.\n\n"I start my term as I mean to continue, spreading unity and leading Wales back towards a partnership with England, in any form that it may take. We can not go it alone, we will have to cooperate." The dramatic culmination of his speech received raucous cheers from his parties members behind him. Morris chuckled to himself, pleased with his first impression as Prime Minister.\n\nAfterwards, Morris returned to his residence, where he began to prepare for the challenges he faced as Prime Minister. He knew they would be numerous, but he was prepared."
walunion.1.a: "Hurrah for Prime Minister Morris!"
 
walunion.2.t: "A Painful Withdrawal"
walunion.2.desc: "It is surprising that the coal crisis was not noticed sooner than it was. Even with the attempted cover up, the effects could have been seen a long time before any official statement was leaked.\n\nMine owners had been scrambling for weeks to find a way to balance their books, miners had grown increasingly bored from days sat in the dark, scratching at the stone that had long ago been exhausted of any value. But the government does not have the time to dwell on past misconceptions, the crisis is far too great to do such a thing.\n\nCoal has been the cornerstone of the Welsh economy and now that it has been eroded away, the rest of the structure is likely to crumble along with it. If it does it will take much more effort to clear the rubble and rebuild the foundations than if a new support can be put in its place.\n\nHowever one looks at it, one thing is clear. If the workers of Wales are forced on to the dole much longer the government will face a similar fate to its already infamous predecessor."
walunion.2.a: "Best get moving quickly"
 
walunion.3.t: "The Fate of the Mines"
walunion.3.desc: "Coal has been such a central part of life in Wales that few can even begin to imagine what a time without it would be like. Uncertainty has started to emerge as many of the people who have grown up around coal mining, and the culture that has grown with it, begin to fear what will come next. Will they lose their centuries old communities, how will the miners who may be layed of provide for their families; what future will there be for their children?\n\nThe Conservatives believe that propping up the mines will only amount to a drain on public finances. It would be better to allow Wales to decide the fate of the coal mines free from the unnecessary intervention of the government.\n\nLabourists within the government are strictly opposed to such measures. They would much rather that the government step in to support what remains of the old mining communities by bailing them out. Else where will the mining societies go next, what future will there be for their people.\n\nMorris and his closest ministers are yet to finalize their decision and all of them know of its critical importance to the future of Wales."
walunion.3.a: ""Bail them out.""
walunion.3.b: ""Leave them to their fate.""
 
walunion.4.t: "Protesters Back on the Streets"
walunion.4.desc: "The streets of Cardiff were once again awash with protestors. Similar chants could be heard denouncing the actions of the government, denouncing its actions as tyrannical. Many of the shouts came from the mouths of students who had begun to benefit so much from enriching themselves in their history. The institutes that they had studied had been forced to shut due to a sudden stop to its government funding.\n\nThis was a step too far for the generation of students who had grown up in the time of the Welsh cultural revitalization. They had been riled up and they began to march towards the Assembly itself, the place where the government they opposed so profoundly had passed the budget cuts.\n\nHowls from the streets could be heard from within the chamber. If it was not for the heavily guarded perimeter, the government may have feared a break in. The guards did not deter the protestors however, who persisted in their vocal protest.\n\nYet from within the Assembly the Unionist members did not seem to care much at all."
walunion.4.a: "What did they expect?"
 
walunion.5.t: "A New Language Bill"
walunion.5.desc: "After the disaster that was the old language bill, the Unionists have tried to make an effort towards bringing English back as the official language of Wales. That is exactly what they planned to do as they entered the Assembly that morning. The new bill had already been drafted and was ready to be introduced into the Assembly as soon as they entered it.\n\nEdwards, instead of Morris this time, stood up before the members of the crowded Assembly to introduce the bill himself. Most of its contents seemed reasonable and the majority of the introductory speech passed without interruption, with the exception of a couple wayward nationalist outbursts. But that was changed when Edwards closing sentence entered the chamber:\n\n"English will always be the language of Wales."\n\nRoars of indignation came from the opposition who had fought so hard to bring Welsh out of obscurity. Yet the bill remained popular and after a short debate it was passed.\n\nAs was to be expected, the worst of the fanatical nationalists found the result to be unacceptable and were enraged at the fact that they had lost. But there is much that the government can do about their inability to accept the will of the Welsh people."
walunion.5.a: "It's all Welsh to them."
 
walunion.6.t: "Rallying the Unionists"
walunion.6.desc: "Not since the days of his electoral campaign had Morris seen such a crowd awaiting his arrival, if anything it was twice as large a crowd as he was used to. Yet this did not deter him, and served only to invigorate him further, such a show of support would only propel the Unionist cause further forward. It was the cause that he had championed these past few weeks and the cause he intends to see through till it's inevitable end.\n\nWhat began as a fairly minor emphasis of his Unionist principles suddenly became unacceptable to Nationalists after he made stated his belief that:\n\n"The Acts of Union were the single greatest part of Welsh history!"\n\nA great response followed from the supportive crowd he had already riled up, but, intentional or not, there was a very serious response. The nationalist parties of Wales were fuming, to no one's surprise.\n\nBut their anger remained as they asked each other: how could Morris undermine the Welsh nation that they had spent years reviving?"
walunion.6.a: "Wales is as divided as ever."

walunion.7.t: "Gradual Acceptance"
walunion.7.desc: "Since the fallout of Morris' controversial speech at his Unionist rally, Wales has had plenty of time to adjust to the official change in language. Unrest remains below the surface as the nationalists begin to accept it. But above the low grumbles of the nationalists, English can be heard being spoken throughout the country.\n\nIn fact, Welsh was only ever spoken by a minority of isolated locals and a set of far removed intellectuals. Neither of these groups truly reflect the large portion of the population that has preferred the use of the English language all along. Amongst these groups English has quickly replaced the little Welsh they spoke, if they spoke any of it at all.\n\nAnd with the language several other parts of English culture has arrived into Welsh life, strangely no longer practiced in Wales' repressive and chaotic neighbour. Nevertheless, the old ways endure in Wales, awaiting for when England will finally come back to its senses."
walunion.7.a: "A very English revival."

walunion.7000.t: "Getting Used"
walunion.7000.desc: ""How about you try this one instead of the one you always buy? Just a thought."\n\nOwen was dumbfounded at the proposition of the old seller. His family bought religiously the same newspaper every week, but the seller was recommending him to buy a different one. This one was in English, as the majority of magazines displayed on the newsstand was. "Your dad was in the British Army, and you are probably learning English in school. You shouldn't have any trouble reading it."\n\n"But Mr. Roberts, why we can't buy the usual newspaper?" the teenager asked, confused. Mr. Roberts put the newspaper down, sighing with a mix of sorrow and resignation. By his depressed and almost paternal tone, Owen could feel that he was very conflicted about something.\n\n"Look, son. I'm gonna be honest. People are starting to use English more and not just because the government is telling them to. It seems everyone is getting used to the idea that our nation may not exist soon."\n\nThe young teenager thought that Mr. Roberts had a point. His friends were starting to drop the Welsh for the English, especially because their parents were recommending them to do it. Almost every business in the town was accomodating to the new (technically old) language, with signs in English appearing more often than its Welsh counterpart. Owen put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a handful of coins. Maybe his family shouldn't be left behind.\n\n"Fine. I'll buy this one.""
walunion.7000.a: "Times change."

walunion.23.desc: "Chaos returns to the streets of Cardiff.\n\nThe blast shook the walls of every shop, factory and home. Its dreadful noise veberbarated throughout Wales. It would continue to echo as scenes like this became frighteningly more commonplace.\n\nImmediately after the attack occurred it was clear who was targeted, several Unionist Welsh men who were headed towards the Assembly. Most were doomed to never complete their journey. The bomb wiped the majority of them out instantly. Those poor enough to survive it initially were left limbless, bleeding, battered and bruised.\n\nModerate Unionists and nationalists alike have been incensed by the barbaric attack. However that has not stopped some calling for retaliation and escalation.\n\nThe perpetrator is unlikely to ever be caught. Worse than that is the fact that they have succeeded."

It appears that the operation was a success and all those found inside have been neutralized.\n\nThe report goes into further detail, recording the minimal casualties that were taken during the short firefight before our soldiers stormed the compound. Several pieces of radio equipment were captured along with some weapons that had been stored there. Vital intelligence was also found, which named some members of the FWA, along with information on their potential whereabouts.\n\nLosing these resources will cripple the capabilities of the FWA for the time being. Though it is expected that there are plenty more of these strongholds left across Wales.\n\nOur struggle against the FWA is not yet over."

walunion.25.t: "Raids Failed"
walunion.25.desc: "News of the raid on the FWA has returned, it is not good.\n\nUnfortunately, our initial forces were unable to breach the fortified building after several of them were wounded. The situation then deteriorated further and additional support had to be called to help them with the assault. Once reinforcements had arrived, it was already too late, those inside had left without trace, destroying any evidence of their presence there.\n\nThe failure to capture the stronghold has reinforced the moral of the FWA and left our own men unnerved. We will have to hope that we can rally the military and bring the fight back to the nationalists rebels.\n\nWe may have lost to the FWA this time, but the Unionist government has not finished its fight just yet."
walunion.25.a: "Better luck next time."

walunion.26.t: "Silence Falls"
walunion.26.desc: "Following a tip off from an informant buried deep within the FWA, the last of the terrorist compounds were successfully stormed. Those inside were barely given a chance to fight back before bullets ripped through the air. Bodies fell and screams of dread left their lungs.\n\nIn the midst of the confusion, the leader of the whole bloody campaign was wrestled to the floor, squirming and wriggling as he cried out. Chaos continued around him as the last of his allies fell around him. His cries were left unanswered before he silenced himself.\n\nHe realised his fight was over. He had lost.\n\nThe rest of the despised terrorists have been captured or killed. Their actions have only stiffened the resolve of the Unionists, any thoughts of an independent Wales are as good as dead and buried. Unification is assured, Cayo, his murderous clique and the Wales they fought for have all truly been defeated."

What he envisioned was a fundamentally different military, reborn from the ashes of what was left over from the nationalists. An army that was cleansed of any nationalist influence, one that would be unwavering to the Unionist government.\n\nHe produced a document full of the names of many officers who he believed to hold sympathies for even the most moderate nationalist cause. What he wanted was to have every single one of them removed.\n\nThis would, without doubt, leave the army in a state of ruin. Repairing the damage would take almost a year, argued Bruce, as if that fact would redeem his proposal in any way.\n\nSeveral cabinet members were appalled that such action should even be suggested. They also questioned whether the army could truly recover from the loss of so many officers. But in the end they had allowed themselves to be convinced that it was the only way to deal with the nationalist threat that loomed over them."
walunion.27.a: "Too late to stop now."

walunion.28.t: "Disappearances in the Armed Forces"
walunion.28.desc: "Before the unit had even been called out to the morning role, their ranks had been noticeably thinned. Only the day before, a group of them had been separated from the barracks; to be driven off to some undisclosed location from where they had not yet returned. A minor panic gripped some of the soldiers as they realised that their comrades were now missing, they were the ones who feared the worst.\n\nWas it an accident? Were they coming back? Who would replace them if they were not?\n\nPerhaps it could be something more sinister. Maybe they had been die-hard nationalist all along and had fled to join the FWA. Or could it have been the government that they served, getting rid of them before they could desert the barracks. If this was the case, how could they be sure of the true beliefs of those who they targeted.\n\nCould they be next?\n\nThese incesent doubts hung over every unit as yet more men disappeared from their ranks. They began to wonder if they could ever fight effectively again if it came to it. Too many good men had gone."
walunion.28.a: "At least the government felt safe"

walunion.2800.t: "The Wounds Heal"
walunion.2800.desc: "Almost a year has passed since the first soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army. Not much has been said since about the matter, any passing comment has been met with silence. A grim reminder of the impact from the heavy handed action the government took.\n\nBy now it was now generally believed that the government were the perpetrators of the disappearances. But by now that had been accepted, not resented. It was the action the government had decided to take. And it had succeeded in permanently preventing nationalist influence spreading throughout the army.\n\nIndeed there was not even a hint of Welsh spoken in the ranks of the army any more. Nationalism had all but disappeared from their lives. Those who had survived the clean up made sure that they avoided the subject entirely, in order to not be relieved of their positions.\n\nBut the gaps had been filled, the army had been replenished and after such a long time the military had recovered. But the damage to the soldiers had already been done, not that they spoke out against it."
walunion.2800.a: "There's not to reason why"

walunion.29.t: "An End to the Purge"
walunion.29.desc: "Over the course of the past few days a great deal of uncertainty and panic had gripped those lower down the ranks of the military. The events that had followed the decision to purge the military have scarred it deeply. Those who remain are nervous to speak out against what happened. All nationalist sentiment has been wiped away completely.\n\nIn a way the whole purge has been a success. It has achieved all of the aims that the government set out to. There is no nationalism to be found and loyalty has been obtained.\n\nThis is a hollow victory.\n\nNo joy can be taken from causing the army to be as badly weakened as it has become. If it is called upon to protect Wales now there would not be any hope, it has become far too weak.\n\nThe soldiers are aware of this and they now look to the future not with hope but with fear."
walunion.29.a: "At least the government feels secure"

walunion.30.t: "The Army's Demands"
walunion.30.desc: "John Morris appraised the small group of men opposite his desk. Several days of negotiations had already passed, and he'd received scant updates, outside of the fact the army was still talking. Now he was expecting answers. "What do they want?"\n\nThe frontmost one cleared his throat, and stepped forward. "The good news is that the army is willing to negotiate, and more importantly, compromise. I believe that we have a path forward, the problem is..."\n\n"Yes, yes, I know they're willing to negotiate," Morris motioned with his hand for them to speed it up. "What I want to know, again, is what they want."\n\n"There are two main demands," the man continued with a cough. "For Welsh speaking to be allowed in the ranks, and for their pay to be increased. I'm aware of the ramifications for both, and while I don't believe we could - or should - give them all they want, I believe that we could concede one of these demands, and the army would agree."\n\nMorris leaned back, considering the news. No ideal options, no matter which way he looked at it. There was something, but it was going to cost something. "There isn't a chance we can hold out?"\n\nStrong shakes of the head from around the room. "I'm afraid not, Prime Minister," the man said. "At least, that's not something we should risk. It's one thing to not give the army what they want, but walking away completely? That is...inadvisable."\n\nWhich was polite talk for 'stupid'. Still, Morris didn't like being held hostage by the army like this, but there needed to be a decision made, and he was going to have to be the one to make it. After taking a few seconds to consider it, he gave his answer."
walunion.30.a: ""We can arrange pay raises for them, but nothing else.""
walunion.30.b: ""If they care about it that much, let them speak their language.""
walunion.30.c: ""I won't be intimidated by these thugs. They'll get nothing from me.""

walunion.31.t: "The First Class of Graduates"
walunion.31.desc: "On the rolling hills that encompassed the university a group of students donning mortar boards walked on to the verdant, sun dappled grass. After all, the sun always shines in Aberystwyth and this day was no exception. Each of them had worked for hours on end to get here, like the classes before them. But those classes did not have to cope with the confusion that had been caused a few months ago when the history curricula shifted suddenly.\n\nMonths scrambling to get to grips with the new English oriented test have however paid off. Despite the confusion, they have learnt in months what future students will have years to study and they have prevailed.\n\nThey are expected to be the first generation of many students to pass from this new English oriented system. As the Wales they have graduated in is not the same one they began their studies in."
walunion.31.a: "Whoever controls the present..."

walunion.32.t: "Shortage in the Classrooms"
walunion.32.desc: "At the front of his decaying classroom the professor thumbed through the dogeared remains of what was supposed to be the complete cause that he had to somehow teach. A feat that was nearly impossible, this book was the only one at his disposal. Putting in an order for a replacement would inevitably result in silence, no new books had been made since the new government had come into power.\n\nSoon, he thought, he would have to deliver the whole of the course from memory. If he was still allowed to teach it at all.\n\nWelsh history was no longer as popular as it has been. The size of his class has noticeably shrunk, the classroom itself was barely half fall. He hoped that won day students would flock back to his classrooms to hear what he had learnt.\n\nBut with Unionism on the rise there would be no place in Wales for what the subject he had loved to teach."
walunion.32.a: "Wales had moved on without him"

walunion.33.t: "Welsh History Endures"
walunion.33.desc: "Within the dark and empty husk of a library a group of students huddled around one of the few textbooks that had survived from before the Unionist government, when the nationalists had revolutionized the curricula. The course described within the book was no longer on offer in any of the schools in Wales, all of the old Welsh history had been replaced.\n\nBut nothing could completely remove the past. The students still remained interested in their history and no government intervention could change that. Even if all that remained of the old books were old and battered by time.\n\nAn unblemished and freshly printed book was left unread beside them.\n\nIn spite of the government's efforts to alter their history, the students remained as intrigued about Welsh history as the students who had studied the book before them. The history of the Welsh endured in utter defiance of what the government believed should be taught."
walunion.33.a: "History remains unaltered."

walunion.34.t: "Building a Welsh Navy"
walunion.34.desc: "Britania rules the waves!\n\nOr so the old saying went. The Royal Navy was always the pride of the British military unparalleled and undefeated. It patrolled the seas of the world protecting Britain and her empire across the globe. At least it was before it ended up submerged below the channel.\n\nUnionists within the government look back upon the times when the English fleet could defend against any threat. They believe that the government should build new war ships to replace the navy that was lost all those years ago.\n\nNevertheless building a new navy from scratch will be extremely expensive. Going ahead with these plans would be risky especially as public support for them is expected to be low. They would much rather that the money be spent elsewhere.\n\nBut the Unionist Party still wants the ships to be built, nevermind what the people think."
walunion.34.a: "They voted for us anyway."

walunion.35.t: "The Death of Cayo"
walunion.35.desc: "Julian Cayo-Evans was reading a newspaper as his car drove along the mountain road. It was a guilty pleasure of his, reading the tabloid nonsense every now and then just for the laughs. The particular piece he held in his hands alleged that the Germans were secretly controlled by Swiss financiers, and somehow it went on that subject for almost twelve pages. It was a moment of calm in the constant eddies of government, something to be valued.\n\nThe man who was supposed to riddle the car with bullets found himself unable to do so as his ancient semi-automatic rifle failed to fire, which allowed the driver just enough time to put his foot on the pedal and dodge the first volley of gunfire. But the second series of shots took out the wheels, flipping the car over as the driver attempted to compensate in a cacophony of metal striking road.\n\nJulian Cayo-Evans emerged from the wreckage with his pistol raised, but with his eyes blocked by blood and smoke he didn't manage to hit anything. This allowed the assassins, all twenty three of them, to open up on the exposed dictator in one deafening volley. The force of the bullets was such that for a brief moment Cayo-Evans was pinned to his car despite have no chance of survival after the first hit his windpipe, this caused several of the more insecure assassins to assume he remained alive and the gunfire would not alight for almost three minutes.\n\nForensic analysis would determine that over fifteen hundred shots had been fired, of which only seventy three hit Cayo-Evans."
walunion.35.a: "Sic semper tyrannis."

walunion.36.t: "Eager to Serve"
walunion.36.desc: "Blackened out barracks had never been the place Lewis wanted to be.\n\nThough he had never doubted that he strived for revolution, soldiering was nevertheless a dismal existence indeed. Every year spent in the confines of the barracks would be spent in secrecy and seclusion as he endlessly tried to keep his true convictions unknown to his oblivious comrades.\n\nWelsh nationalism was never a cause he could have fought for. He did not fight for the freedom of his country, he fought for the freedom of its workers. The rise of the SLP in England had made him quite the Unionist, he anticipated a socialist reckoning to arrive with it. He would finally be able to do what he had always yearned to do.\n\nTurning his gun on and shooting down every last capitalist pig he could get in his sights.\n\nHe either was unaware of or did not care for the truth that England had absolutely no appetite for further violence after the mayhem of the civil war. But all Lewis wanted was more violence, more bloodshed, more chaos; to achieve the beliefs he had spent a lifetime holding back."
walunion.36.a: "Unlikely to succeed."

walunion.37.t: "Another Change in Course"
walunion.37.desc: "Stacking old textbooks for removal had become an oddly repetitive task for the history lecturers at the University of Wales. By now they had been through more editions than they could care to count. The alterations in the new editions would cause plenty of confusion, but by now teachers and students alike had, in a weird way, become used to it.\n\nThis was all part of a continuation of realigning Wales closer to England, as socialism triumphed there it will likewise prevail here.\n\nHowever, at this stage most teachers had become far too apathetic to care for the reasons behind the constant unrelenting stream of changes. They had been through it all before, and they would not be surprised if they were to go through it all again."
walunion.37.a: "Surely this is the right direction?"

walunion.38.t: "The Beginning of the End"
walunion.38.desc: "War has ravaged across England for days and days on end. Cities, towns and villages have been raised, fields have been torn to shreds and from all this carnage despairingly little has changed. The collaborator government that existed before the war has crushed the rebellion that rose up against them.\n\nAgainst the odds, the status quo looks set to return.\n\nOverall John Morris was unsure of what to think of the whole situation. On the one hand the situation in England would start to settle, paving the way for reunification in the near future. But on the other he feared that the collaborator government would be far less caring for the hopes and fears of the Welsh people than their enemies in the Left Resistance and HMMLR would have been.\n\nHowever now is not the time for doubts, this is the cause that he has committed himself to. It is up to him to see it through."
walunion.38.a: "Time to let go of what could have been."

walunion.39.t: "Dissension in the Ranks"
walunion.39.desc: "The government's decision to demobilize the vast majority of the Welsh Army had left many generals feeling purposeless. Walking around the drab halls of their barracks and armories had become even more of an aimless chore for them. Rooms had been stripped of soldiers, making every room feel hollow and empty.\n\nMost senior officers were willing to accept the change, if it were the will of the government, and by extension the people, there was nothing that could be done.\n\nHowever, one particularly headstrong general rushed to his office to try and rectify this disaster. More must know beside him, he thought, more people had to be told. He put pen to paper and wrote, still not knowing who he was writing to.\n\nThe erratic scratching of the pen against the paper echoed off the concrete walls, building up in to something of a crescendo as he signed off his closing statement"
walunion.39.a: "Soldiering was their lives, without it they have nothing."

walunion.40.t: "The Return of the King"
walunion.40.desc: "Taking up his position on the stage set up in the centre of Cardiff, the King of England readied himself to speak to a crowd of his soon-to-be subjects. He had ploughed through his speech that had been handed to him by his government, but took especial relish in telling the people:\n\n"We are glad to see that you will be back, back where you have always belonged."\n\nHis crude language did nothing to help the Unionist cause in the slightest. This was far from the joyous reuniting of friends that had been promised; this was the death of a once hopeful and independent Welsh Republic.\n\nSeveral members of the Welsh Assembly did not listen to, nor care for, what the King had to say. All they could do was stand silently and stifle their sadness and tears as the Republic they had always supported was torn down before them.\n\nMorris stood toward the back, no longer feeling the need to stand center stage. He did not talk or cry, he merely watched on at what unfolded before him, knowing full well that he was now powerless to stop it. Careful to reveal nothing of what was going through his head."
walunion.40.a: "It is too late to turn back."

walunion.41.t: "The beacon of democracy"
walunion.41.desc: "England has spent far too long at war with itself. Brother has fought brother and children have risen up against their parents. Yet from the ashes left by this carnage, the light of democracy has glimmered through.\n\nAll of Wales has watched on, longing for a return of the England that had by now been gone for decades. However, as this transformation occurred, they rekindled their hope that England might finally come to its senses. And after their long and grueling wait, the England they had lost all those years ago found itself once more.\n\nNow people on both sides of the border readily await the day of unification. They can now look to the future, free of the depressing uncertainty that had haunted them these past years.\n\nEnglishmen and Welshmen alike can share in their optimism for a shared and brighter future."
walunion.41.a: "Back to the good old days"

walunion.42.t: "Inspiring the Soldiers"
walunion.42.desc: "General Lewes faced the ordered rows of men before him, scouring at those unfortunate enough to be stood toward the front. He had wanted them to be presented as best they could for this occasion. Once he was satisfied that every man had followed these orders he launched himself into an impassioned speech on the Anglo-Welsh relationship.\n\n"I am of the belief that England has always had Welsh interests close to its heart. Even as it was beaten back by its foreign foe, it sought to defend the island, which we share, to the last man."\n\n"Since then England has been in chains, held captive by the Germans, but they never let their hope die out. Once they saw their moment the English rose up against their oppressors and overthrew those who dared to collaborate with them."\n\n"Now we can stand once more, as brothers; armed and ready to defend our land from any threat. The English are our oldest and greatest ally and you must never allow yourselves to forget that.""
walunion.42.a: "And they never would."

walunion.43.t: "The Red Flag Rises"
walunion.43.desc: "News of the SLP's victory did not take long to cross the border from England to Wales.\n\nIt was especially quick to reach the office of the Prime Minister, who had been diligently following every development in English politics since the end of the civil war. All the while he waited for his chance to begin the reunification process, which he believed, after many uncertain years, had finally arrived.\n\nMorris saw great potential in the socialist system that the SLP had promised to introduce in England. He was assured that it would also bring prosperity to the long suffering people of Wales as well. There was a time, not so long ago, when Morris had not been so optimistic for the future of Wales.\n\nThose fears have long since passed."
walunion.43.a: "Onwards, toward the future."

walunion.44.t: "The Wrexham Conference"
walunion.44.desc: "Never in Wrexham's history had everything felt as normal as it did on the day of the conference. Rays of sunlight were dappled across the town, giving it a warm inviting glow. Birdsong flitted through the peaceful midmorning air. Slowly a gentle breeze softly carried the pompous tune of the English national anthem.\n\nAnd a hushed anticipation hung over it all.\n\nMorris sat quietly by himself waiting for the arrival of the English government; it must have been the first time he could be at ease with his own thoughts.\n\nHe reflected on how, in spite of all opposition, he had gotten to this point. There would be no FWA guerrilla nor Plaid member that could possibly stop him now. Unification had come as the English would arrive at the conference shortly, whereupon they would present the offer of unification to the Welsh Prime Minister. He would in turn read it briefly, relief sweeping through him as he did."
walunion.44.a: "And Morris smiled, for it was good."

walunion.45.t: "The Wrexham Conference"
walunion.45.desc: "Opposite the English delegation, John Morris quietly read through and consequently signed off the unification agreement. Beside him, the English shared in his optimism and hope for the future, both sides believed that together Wales and England would become much stronger.\n\nHaving signed his section of the paper, the Welsh Prime Minister passed over the agreement to his English counterpart, and, with the stroke of a pen, the first step toward the complete reunification of the British Isle had been taken.\n\nUnity had overcome separatism, Wales became part of England. The two of them now stood together as one, united once more."
walunion.45.a: "And so the Story of Wales ended."

walunion.46.t: "A Change in the Market"
walunion.46.desc: "Erin had worked tirelessly in her little village shop her whole life. Her shelves were always stocked with all manner of produce, she sold everything anyone in her quaint community could ever dream of owning.\n\nRecent circumstances had however forced her to change what she put on sale; local produce was far too expensive and suddenly became replaced by products from England.\n\nNoone could blame her, they were so much cheaper than their Welsh alternatives, carrying on as normal would have been senseless.\n\nEvery corner of markets across Wales had become inundated with English goods. Welsh producers everywhere were being thoroughly outcompeted by their counterparts across the border. They felt like they were to be sidelined once again, with the English never giving a second thought about Welsh interests.\n\nGreat sadness swept the nation as little shops like Erin's gave way to the tide of English dominance. The Welsh collectively watched on as the Welsh economy faded away before their very eyes."
walunion.46.a: "A return to the bad old days."

walunion.47.t: "The Wrexham Conference"
walunion.47.desc: "Wrexham had always come off as slightly drab this time of year, but for Morris everything around him had become much murkier. The King's speech had been a disaster, his generals were close to being up in arms and all while he watched on as the passion he used to have for Unionism faded away.\n\nThe English Prime Minister and the rest of their entourage ploded into the room where the conference was to be held; Morris made every effort to avoid them as they entered.\n\nHowever the time to sign the deal continued to creep closer, along with the realisation of how unavoidable it had become. Morris' hand shook as he signed his name and handed over the papers to the English Prime Minister opposite him.\n\nSomething inside the man had broken, yet he tries his best to look on to the future."
walunion.47.a: "But what is there to look forward to?"

walunion.48.t: "The Flag Over Cardiff"
walunion.48.desc: "Opposite the English delegation, John Morris quietly read through and consequently signed off the unification agreement. Beside him, the English shared in his optimism and hope for the future, both sides believed that together Wales and England would become much stronger.\n\nHaving signed his section of the paper, the Welsh Prime Minister passed over the agreement to his English counterpart, and, with the stroke of a pen, the first step toward the complete reunification of the British Isle had been taken.\n\nUnity had overcome separatism, Wales became part of England. The two of them now stood together as one, united once more."
walunion.48.a: "And so the Story of Wales ended."

walunion.49.t: "An Englishman in Cardiff"
walunion.49.desc: "Jellicoe had been glad to accept his invitation to tour Cardiff the instant that it had arrived. He always relished the opportunity to make a public appearance, and promptly began to write a draft for the speech he would have to make in a few days' time.\n\nOnce he had arrived at the Welsh capital, he immediately set about charming everyone who had the pleasure of meeting him. Not before long it was time for him to make his speech outside the Welsh Assembly; where he did not hesitate to take the opportunity of standing shoulder to shoulder with Morris. He also made sure to cement the theme of Welsh and English brotherhood declaring,\n\n"Our bond was never, nor could it ever be, broken."\n\n"Jellicoe, Jellicoe!" came the chants amid thunderous applause.\n\nHe had endeared himself to all he had met, the public cheered him wherever he went, and the unionist government could not help but feel grateful for the charisma and sophistication that the English Prime Minister had brought to the occasion."
walunion.49.a: "Unification has never been so popular."

walunion.8000.t: "A Step Towards Reunification"
walunion.8000.desc: "Outside of where the Prime Minister was due to make his scheduled announcement something could be seen fluttering in the wind above. It served as a means of foreshadowing what the contents of his speech was to be. It was a flag with a far different design to the one that was in its place before, it was vibrant red in colour and contained the Union Flag in its top left corner\n\nBack inside, John Morris stood up to deliver the announcement, fully aware of the tensions it might reveal.\n\n"I have come here to deliver an announcement that I am led to believe has been awaited since the results of the election were announced. Indeed, I am here to reveal to all who have gathered here today that my government intends to bring Wales towards a greater state of union with its neighbour, England."\n\n"The more eagle-eyed members of the crowd would have also noticed the change in flag that flies above us, which I am also proud to unveil. It will serve as a placeholder till we are officially reunified and can adopt the Union Flag on its own." As Morris spoke he gestured to a copy of the flag that had been displayed next to him,\n\n"I, along with the majority of the supportive Welsh electorate, am of the belief that we all will be better off in such a state. My government will move forward with its plans and I promise to you all that one day, Wales will return to England."\n\n"We are Unionists after all!""
walunion.8000.a: "They are indeed."

walunion.8996.t: "FWA Report"
walunion.8996.desc: "Information on the Free Wales Army is scant, but from what we can decipher, the group is in a very weak state. The factor that is affecting the fanatic nationalist movement is the lack of support from the Welsh people, as they still support our unionist government, which they voted for.\n\nAt this point in time the group is not expected to be able to pose a serious threat to the stability of the government. They are lacking in all forms of weaponry and communication equipment; they are also short of manpower too. Without enough of these vital resources the attacks that they could attempt are greatly restricted.\n\nUltimately the FWA's situation is bleak, as they are far weaker than the Welsh security forces. If they remain this feeble they will soon be crushed.\n\nThose within the unionist government hope that they can be removed swiftly."
walunion.8996.a: "We will bring them down."

walunion.8997.t: "FWA Report"
walunion.8997.desc: "Despite its past circumstances, government sources now indicate that the FWA has become moderately threatening.\n\nOur informants came to this conclusion after they determined that the overall size of the group is considerably greater than it was when we first reported on it. Their arsenal has also improved and the amount of men at their disposal has enabled them to undertake small scale guerrilla operations.\n\nBut their overall strength is still insignificant compared to that of our own forces.\n\nHowever this does not mean that the group should be ignored, they are still brutal terrorists that endanger the lives of every Welsh Unionist."
walunion.8997.a: "Nothing to panic over."

walunion.8998.t: "FWA Report"
walunion.8998.desc: "Activity from the FWA has grown. Skirmishes are more common, firefights between FWA guerrillas and Unionist soldiers have left several Welsh men dead. This is a sorry sight and this increase in confidence from the FWA is troubling.\n\nGeneral Cayo, the commander of the FWA and the cause of these deaths, remains elusive, but our intelligence has led us to believe that he still directs his forces out of our reach.\n\nOur investigators embedded within the FWA have also seen more new recruits join their ranks. These fresh troops have strengthened them greatly giving them additional soldiers to throw at our forces. More soldiers will mean more casualties which will only be worse for Wales.\n\nRegardless of the FWA's sustained rise we still believe that we will see a downturn in terrorist activity shortly. For they can not keep this up much longer."
walunion.8998.a: "But how can we be sure?"

walunion.8999.t: "FWA Report"
walunion.8999.desc: "Worryingly, government sources are not noticing any downturn in FWA activity, instead they have continued to pull off ever more ambitious acts of terror towards those sympathetic to the Unionist cause.\n\nIt is as if whenever we stamp them up they will only reappear somewhere else, more numerous and compelled than before. Their attacks have also increased in scale and number, great amounts of damage has been done, we are starting to lose control of Wales.\n\nWe can no longer be sure of the true allegiances of our own soldiers, it is suspected that they have even infiltrated our army. Yet this could not be possible, after all we did to ensure that it would remain loyal. Maybe these rumours are false, but the FWA has become so powerful we can not be sure.\n\nEither way they will soon be powerful enough to confront the government directly."
walunion.8999.a: "It's almost over."

walunion.9000.t: "FWA Report"
walunion.9000.desc: "Lately it has become obvious that the FWA is growing at a rate faster than was anticipated. The government's strategy so far has proved ineffective at preventing the spread of the extremist organization, but the situation has fortunately not fallen out of our control.\n\nWe have kept our grip on the situation as the FWA's movements and attacks have become predictable, allowing us to stay one step ahead of them. Furthermore, our garrisons around the country have become more adept at repelling the guerrillas, bleeding their available manpower. Yet they have that has not deterred them.\n\nTheir abhorrent methods are still in use. But they may have been effective at terrorising the people of Wales to begin with but over time they have hardened and even those who were previously sympathetic to the FWA's cause have started to turn their backs.\n\nAt this moment the attacks may continue and the situation may seem bleak, but there is still hope that we will prevail."

cayo.1.t: "A True Patriot in Charge"
cayo.1.desc: "Cayo was feeling like he should, as the most powerful man in Wales. When he entered the radio station, he was greeted with cheers and salutes. Even if half the men doing so were interim operators from the FWA, it was still a marvellous feeling. He had won.\n\nNow, he walked into the station's studio, accompanied by the new head of the formerly toothless and liberal institution. Sitting in the tall, comfortable leather seat, he took one breath and started to work through his words. The first time was not confident enough, the second time sounded almost sympathetic to the Unionists, the third was too quick and messy. Then, his fourth run through, he thought he had hit his strides. It was time to begin.\n\n"Children of the Welsh dragon, I come to you announcing the beginning of a bright future, the promise of many free centuries laid before us. You all know me as a patriot, as the leader of the Free Wales Army. I appreciate this image, but it is not my whole self. True, I am a cunning commander, a friend to my allies and ruthless in dealing with foes, but there is much more to me, and my brothers-in-arms, than just that. Through my leadership, the FWA has proven to be made of effective administrators, compassionate family men, and hard workers. These are the virtues that we aim to bring in every aspect of our government and society.

No longer must we feel ashamed of our culture, of our language! In every schoolhouse, in every business, in every theatre and bookshop, the heroic history of our nation and people will be celebrated. A true independence can begin from this, one where all Welshmen are truly free from all the forces that dog him. The snide gaze of the Anglo, the callous abandonment of the villages, the feminization of our military, these are all shameful facets of our young nation that we shall absolutely combat. We are in a land surrounded by wolves, and if we do not act as if we are already engaged in a vicious battle of survival, then we shall perish as a free nation. Today is just the beginning of the great Welsh century. Our tasks are many, our foes are mighty, but as a people we shall tear them all down on the road to sovereignty!""

No matter how hard he tried, it seemed impossible to fully excise from his mind the horrible maelstrom that occurred during the Cardiff March. How foolish of him to think that nothing worse would come after, that life would quickly return to normal.\n\nEver since the ascendance of Julian Cayo to the leadership of state, Alex had been watching with deep anxiety over the new pronouncements coming out everyday. Cymru Goch never meant much to him. Just barely of voting age, the only reason he found himself at their headquarters was because of their recent opening for a mail writer. Returning to his typewriter, he was set to prepare his seventh version of the latest letter leadership wanted sent out: a simple donation request given Cayo's recent bluster against them. The situation had made him for the first time feel a connection to all this, feel like he was part of something that could help Wales. Why, he wondered, was I so averse to supporting my employers?\n\n9:25 am. Alex hears screams coming from the first floor, hears the front desk secretary crying out for help. Suddenly, he's back in that awful night: gunfire, broken glass, fear permeating every pore of his body. The world seems to melt away in this paralysis, every wall just a mere transient presence--\n\nThe screams came hard and fast. Five men in FWA fatigues, submachine guns slung over their backs. He can hardly leave his seat before one pulls him out of it, grabs him by the collar of his sweater, and throws him on the ground. A military boot begins to stomp on his face, then his gut, and before he knows it crushing blows land from seemingly every direction. Then it's over. A crackle from a radio returns him to reality once again. "Cymru Goch has been taken care of here in Cardiff, can we move on to that damn commie press they have running on 8th Street?" Then, the men ran off, leaving Alex and the rest of his coworkers to endure the aftermath."

Starting on her third pint of stout, she swam once again into the hell that her past had been in this miserable country. Her escape west nearly two decades ago, running off to Swansea with her newly married husband. It was supposed to be a fairy tale, a journey through the land of dragons. Instead, it became an ever-tightening labyrinth.\n\nTwo years ago, the man she thought would be hers forever finally left. That philandering, distant piece of shit finally had the courage to walk away. Looking back, it was foolish to think anything could become better in the Welsh nightmare. Instead, she was simply left to rotate through various menial jobs in the city, left with no respite if she found herself fired. A few of her smarter friends told her to join Cymru Goch, to fight for a red Wales. She never took interest, and now her friends haven't been seen in weeks.\n\nAs she stood up, Helen quickly got her bearings. A high tolerance for drink was necessary to survive in Swansea. Turning to the bartender, she told him goodbye, then slowly made her way to the door. Exiting into the cold, damp night, Helen barely thought it necessary to wonder whether someone had called her a "skinny Anglo bitch". Just leave it behind, only swing at them if necessary. Then, she heard it again.\n\n"Hey, this country--" the voice slurred, "This country belongs to us now, not you grubs. Fuckin' move outta here, or Cayo will getcha!"\n\nHelen thought she could keep going, keep ignoring and not get dragged into a bar fight. Then the bald man swung in from behind and shoved her onto the cold pavement, started shouting and saying things about how she was a communist, a wolf in sheep's clothing. When a woman came up behind this hairless, middle-age pugilist, she simply pulled him away and they disappeared into night. Slowly, Helen got to her feet, and gazed up to the stars. What must I do, she thought, to leave this awful place?"

Before Cayo's coup, before all the anti-English messaging began to flood the streets, they already were known to pick on the quiet kids, the solo kids. But something changed a few months back. They began to pick new targets, singled out any Anglo-sounding kid even if they were relatively popular. For the victims of the shoving, the smashing of lunches, the jeering as they walked home, they thought maybe they could come together and change something. At least, their parents did.\n\nAndrew was always a favorite victim of theirs. Even before they began to style themselves as "Welsh Warriors," the noogies came without end. But when things escalated, when he came home one day with a nosebleed, his mother went straight to the principal. All she got was dismissal, saying that it was just a bit of "boyhood fun." With just a few months to go, Andrew was convinced he could stick things out before moving to some new school. Today, looking out to the sea on the horizon, he wondered where else he could attend, what other lands lie beyond. Then, he was slammed against the chain-link fence.\n\n"Hey Anglo, thinking about running away? Thought you could leave us? We're supposed to be good buddies." Dylan's voice was unmistakable, the way too gruff tone that cuts through you like a razor blade.\n\n"Yeah, they just never wanna be your friends, no matter how nice you are." Adam, the classic imitator. Andrew couldn't recall one time where his insults weren't just copied off of Dylan.\n\n"Heh, heh. Maybe he was gonna blow something up, yeah Anglo?" Maxwell always squealed like a pig. "I say we dump him in the sea."\n\n"Ooh, I like that. He can swim all the way back to England," said Dylan. "Then we don't need to see your shit-butt haircut anymore."\n\n"Yeah. It is a shit-butt haircut," remarked Adam.\n\n"Well, Anglo, it is early. We're gonna leave for now, but just thought you should be reminded who's boss. Keep looking at the sea, pretend we're not here. And don't you dare tell, or what just happened is gonna look like we were playing nice," Dylan rasped. With that, the Welsh Warriors let Andrew go, and ran back off to torment some other poor soul.

Captain Powell is leading us through basic drills, but he's not like the major. We've all turned to him like he's the damn teacher: what's Cayo gonna do, what do you think happened to the Colonel and Major, where do you think they are? He doesn't know, of course, but we really can't complain. They were both real assholes, and everyone loves Powell.\n\n16 August: Finally. Today, we were introduced to our new black-clad commanders. Replacing the old guard are Colonel Saer and Major Gruffud, neither of which looked to have broken 30. Hell, the Major looks like he could be Powell's younger brother. Thankfully, they immediately operated like real leaders. We got split up into various small groups, 'cells', I think they called them. Said they were modelling unit structure on how the FWA did it. While we were dividing up into these newly assigned groups, we all wondered if Jones and Rice would mouth off, them typically being quite open to boisterous talks of politics. Nothing happened thankfully, though I don't recall seeing them as we split off.\n\n1 September: This one will be short. New drills are exhausting. Ten miles we ran today, full gear in a rainstorm, which isn't too much worse than what we once did. But then our daily guerrilla training started. For the English devils they said, the ones who will inevitably try to destroy us. We had to shed some gear as we began to fan out into the (abandoned) neighboring village, and were instructed to spend the next hour moving from house to house, collecting some kind of token from each to show we did it. Gruelling shit. FWA boys are crazy.\n\n16 September: Tonight, one month into the new leadership, we receive our first 'political education course'. Nobody really knows what to expect, at least not the average guys like me. A few new recruits from the FWA are saying it's just a more interesting version of history, mixed with some important lessons for the self. Me and my cell would drink heavy under normal circumstances before something like this, but unfortunately Saer and Gruffud are much stricter on the flow of booze. It doesn't help that something like thirty of our guys got discharged, a few that I liked a lot. Oh well. I'm here for the country, not for myself."

Imperative to build and spread most effective tactics to ensure effective combat against numerically superior foes.\n\nIn final analysis, officers drawn from FWA bring new initiative, discipline, and ideological coherence to armed forces.

He'd always dreamed of a free brotherhood of Celtic nations, he'd seen them be freed from England by the German invasion yet to Cayo's own consternation no one had proposed the obvious next step.\n\nWell, if the other free Celtic nations of the world would not do it then it fell to the oldest sibling to give them a push. The Celtic Liberation Army was the first step of his plan, and Cayo-Evans felt that it was also the most important. Before the Celtic nations could begin working against England in a united front they would have an army capable of defeating them. A unified army under one command, and with one vision. Only then could the matter of England be settled properly.\n\nYet as he sat at his desk the Y Mab Darogan couldn't help but check over the text once more, he thought it eloquent enough but there was no shame in having it looked over once again to make sure. Calling his secretary, Julian Cayo-Evans took the first step into a new world."

Delivered live to an audience of only a few hundred but broadcast by radio and television to all of Wales Julian Cayo-Evans actually managed to make the economy seem interesting for a little while.\n\nDenouncing the efforts of traitorous Unionists and their inability to fix the woes of the nation, Cayo-Evans promised a new and expanded economy that relied upon more than mere coal. He promised factories in the cities and an expanded agricultural base, he promised jobs and pay for every Welshmen who could work and pensions for those who could not. Even when it came to the often discussed subject of reform the Y Mab Darogan made clear his intentions to never harm the rights of the Welsh people, and that he would turn the cesspit of political intrigue into something that served everyone and not the privileged and English few.\n\nCapped off with a denunciation of England, the speech was the most popular one by Cayo-Evans yet. Though some doubt his sincerity on the subject of political reform, none could deny that from a distance it didn't seem to be a half bad plan. Well, none denied it openly anyway.

Yet as the Free Wales Army became a party of government there had been increasing clashes between the assorted wings, between social democrats, conservatives and fascists who might all have believed in a free Wales, but disagreed what those two words meant.\n\nThe Y Mab Darogan as always listened, waited, and then acted swiftly and without hesitation. Several trade union leaders affiliated with the FWA were summoned to Cardiff, along with them a host of the more protectionist or socialist leaning FWA members from across the nation and as they sat in Julian Cayo-Evans office it became apparent who was not there. The Church, the businessman and the ardent fascists were mysteriously absent from the meeting.\n\nWhen the men left the office not a few hours later a plan had been drawn out, negotiated and finalised. Pensions for the Welsh, national ownership of several industries, and the state working with rather than against the Trade Unions.

The average man wants naught but food and a roof over his head but the Y Mab Darogan strives for something more for his nation. It is not enough that Wales be a respected nation when it can be a great nation if it but pushes a little harder.\n\nTo this end Cayo-Evans has called forth those who share his vision, the businessmen and the police chiefs. The churchmen and the mayors and the political friends of old who aided the Free Wales Army when it was a mere fragment of the organisation that it has become.\n\nThey are given an offer, wealth and power will be theirs if they would merely consider supporting the government where necessary. The businessmen will get their contracts and the politicians will find their reelection campaigns mysteriously unopposed.

The German is an aristocratic man of Junker stock who gives the Hitler salute to the Y Mab Darogan when he enters the room as befits a friend of the Reich. The Irishwoman merely gives some words of encouragement for Cayo-Evans bold rejection of English imperialism.\n\nFrom all the nations of the world they come and each and every one seeks a deal or an accommodation with the new state of affairs.

He got the feeling that were the Germans to land at Dover tomorrow Mr. Evans would be quite happy to assist them.\n\nThis would need to be reported back to London, and fast.

She'd never lived anywhere else and she tried to say as much, but her Nan shushed her before she got through the sentence.\n\nAs the truck moved off, Amelie hoped wherever she was going that it had a bigger house at least."

We could throw in a few nominal independents who answer to us in reality but that might not fool everyone, and more to the point some of them might get too big for their boots.

Julian Cayo-Evans might not be inclined against elections in and of himself, but the fact of the matter is that a loss or worse a doubted victory could prove damaging to the international reputation of the nation.\n\nAt the same time however, not holding elections at all is a very dangerous business. It clues people in to the fact that they don't have that much power in the decision making process, and when that happens people start to get uppity. In the kind of way where governments fall and new powers rise from the ashes. The Y Mab Darogan might have the people's support for now but that is not guaranteed to last in such circumstances.\n\nThe moderates back elections, the hardliners do not.

English sympathisers most likely and ones we should pay attention to from now on. In any case, we have proven ourselves competent at the art of politics as well as governance, and we should be most grateful for the assistance provided by the electoral commission in counting the votes properly without foreign interference.

Free Wales Army men and their supporters would have to fill out the majority of course, but there were some of the Moderates who looked like they were willing to assist in governing Wales the right way as well.\n\nGiving the Moderates a voice would be useful for his public perception, and endear him to the old guard of the party on top of that whilst providing some more experienced men to assist governance. But on the other hand, could you really ever trust your allies to not stab you in the back? It was an alliance of convenience after all."

What is it that defines the land of mountains and valleys in the modern age?\n\nThe outside world might say it is the unique language and culture of the state. The Celtic world might say it is the longest subjugated of the brythonic peoples and was the last to be freed from tyranny. But if you ask the ordinary Welshmen you will have a different and far more interesting answer.\n\nWhom was it that freed the Welsh from Unionist tyranny? Twas the Free Wales Army. Who stood against England and all her cunning plans to force Wales into submission once more? The Free Wales Army. Who will you vote for in the National Assembly elections? The Free Wales Army.\n\nThe party, movement and militia has become so synonymous with Wales that to mention the nation is to mention the party in the eyes of some. Wales is defined by nationalism in the same way the Reich is, and similarities are sometimes noted by foreign observers. Whatever happens to Wales in the future it will be the FWA who are at the heart of it."

The Welsh delegation has expressed Wales' interest of future of mutual cooperation between the two states if this sale were to be approved, but Scotland herself needs these ships as well to defend her waters from potential threats.\n\nThe room was tensing up, and although the circumstances weren't world ending as the talks that the United States and Germany occasionally exchanged, there was a feeling of palpable tension building up between the two parties. Wales needed the ships and the dockyards in order to safeguard its own waters with its already lackluster navy, but the decision to sell the ships are in the Scottish delegates' hands.\n\n"Apologies, but I would like to make a phone call to Edinburgh." The Scottish delegate spoke up in the heat of the moment.\n\n"Please do, I do not mind." The Welsh delegate replied as he adjusts his tie with a sense of nervousness. The next several minutes were the tensest the meeting had gotten, and the room stood silent with only the mumbled voice of the Scottish delegate filling up the room.\n\nThe sound of the receiver to the body of the phone could be heard as the Scottish delegate returned to the room, and he immediately spoke up.\n\n"The proposal for the lease of Scottish dockyards to our friends in Wales...""
WALSCO.1.a: ""...has been approved by Edinburgh, and awaiting ratification.""
WALSCO.1.b: ""...has unfortunately been denied by Edinburgh.""

WALSCO.2.t: "Scotland Accepts!"
WALSCO.2.desc: "After hard negotiations with Scotland, and thus with the Irish government, we have managed to rent two dockyards from the Scotland, at a cost which has been deemed acceptable by our treasury.\n\nWhile they may not seem very useful at first glance, those dockyards are actually an invaluable asset in our hands: indeed, not only will they bring Wales some much-needed prestige, they will also make us able to produce our very own ships, which will indubitably make us stand out more on the world stage. Not only that, but also we will be able to assemble a new Royal Navy, that will surely rival the one of old which brought us so many victories on the seven seas.\n\nPrime Minister Morris has been reportedly very happy to acquire the dockyards, as it seems that his Unionist ambitions are paying off, and that the Scottish-Welsh friendship still stands strong, despite all the hardships both our countries have endured. However, some naysayers have declared that the deal was a waste of resources, and that building a new Royal Navy is but a vanity project, devoid of any practical uses. Of course, these criticisms are only a minority, and they shall not stop us from regaining the prestige we lost following the Second World War."
WALSCO.2.a: "Rule, Britannia!"

WALSCO.3.t: "We Could've Had Ships in Rosyth!"
WALSCO.3.desc: ""The Prime Minister has denied your request for access to Scottish dockyards."\n\nJohn Morris swung around and almost tripped on the leg of his chair and kinked a heavy brown eyebrow. "What? What's that?"\n\nThe Scottish diplomat narrowed his shoulders and clasped his hands over his waist. Poised for a tepid, apologetic bow, his posture rankled Morris. "He wanted someone to tell you in person. So as not to be insulting, I mean."\n\nAnd that was all there was to it. If the diplomat was being timid rather than obsequious, then Morris could forgive that, but the refusal cut and chilled him like a splash of brackish Scottish water. With the Scots' assent, Wales could have brand new destroyers built as far as Rosyth and Kirkcaldy by the end of next year. Morris breathed out his affliction with a curt sigh.\n\n"Well, if it can't be helped, please tell the Prime Minister that I'm eager to negotiate new terms if he should ever reconsider. Can you do that?"\n\nThe diplomat cocked an eye to the ceiling, making a great show of answering a yes-no question. "I see no reason why the Prime Minister wouldn't consent to renewed negotiations at some point, but I can't do much to assure you."\n\n"Kindly do all you can. If I can't see the docks in Rosyth, I'd at least like to take a ride on the Circle Line.""
WALSCO.3.a: "One day, they'll go roaring back to Fife."

WALSCO.4.t: "Dockyard Contract Expired"
WALSCO.4.desc: "Our contract with the Scotland government has run out, and the dockyards we had lent from them are now back in their possession. While expected, this is something of a setback for us, as our grand project of rebuilding the Royal Navy will have to be put on hold for now.\n\nWe now have two options standing in front of us, at least theoretically: we can either rent the dockyards from Scotland again, and cave in to Scotland's demands, or we can just abandon it; however, it is quite evident that the second option would be political suicide, given that now that our political endeavour of building Wales a navy has been started, ending it now would be quite unwise, on top of being a loss of prestige for our nation. And with the navy being Prime Minister Morris' pet project, it seems that in reality, we only have one option, and that is to rent out the dockyards from Scotland again.\n\nGiven the fact that said dockyards were also bringing us some much-needed income, we can only hope that renting them out one more time shall be the key to economic prosperity."
WALSCO.4.a: "Let's hope that the Scottish see eye to eye."

wal.1000.t: "England Posturing Against Wales"
wal.1000.desc: "It is known that the English have longed for a restoration of the United Kingdom ever since its dissolution, but in recent weeks London has been making worrying overtures in support of this goal. The fanatics of the National Front have given rambling speeches calling for the "restoration of British pride and integrity" and have vowed to never rest until the Union Jack can be flown once again. Today, Prime Minister Chesterton gave a fiery oratory in Westminster targeted directly at us, proclaiming that "Wales has for centuries been an integral domain of the British nation, and in time all must come to respect this ancient claim, whether by way of words or by strength of English arms!"\n\nThough we may have hoped this was mere nationalist drum-beating, reports of English armed forces slowly amassing along the border have dashed this fantasy. It is clear that the English intend to restore the old Kingdom, and they have no intention of consulting the Welsh nation's feelings on the matter. Time is short, and it is clear that we must ready our forces. Though the English may possess the numerical advantage, they shall come to know that the Welsh spirit cannot so easily be tamed."
