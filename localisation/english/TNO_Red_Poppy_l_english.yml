 POLITICS_HENRI_GROUES_DESC:0 "He watched, waited, and prayed for decades. In the basements of ruined churches, in the sewers of Paris, in whatever dark, dank corners were beyond the vision of surveillance cameras, the Red Poppy Movement did the same. Some prayed to God, some to YHVH, some to whatever they hoped was listening.\n\nAt last, their prayers have been answered.\n\nAfter thirty years of brutal, crushing totalitarianism, the iron yoke of the Ordensstaat has snapped in two, rusted through by corruption, paranoia, and hubris. An entire generation of French men and women were raised in the dark for this moment, their muscles and spirits primed to deliver a coup de grâce with their misericorde, straight into the black heart of Burgundy. Grouès tended to them no matter their faith or ideals, nurturing the potential they all held within themselves to deliver France from evil. His heart aches at the bloodshed to come, and the thousands of his brothers and sisters who will surely die for their cause, but freedom will be the salve that soothes and heals all wounds - be they of body or soul. If everyone who fights beneath their red banner should perish, then that too is a form of salvation. Either way, their suffering will end."
