maltaconference.1.t:0 "Malta Conference"
maltaconference.1.d:0 "The Triumvirate teeters on the edge of collapse, and every power knows it. Border disputes that have existed for decades have been elevated to skirmishes as the Second World War's aftermath inflamed tensions. Trade is in shambles, the economy is spiraling down, and nobody wants to get along with each other. In one final attempt to save the Triumvirate, Ciano has decided on calling a meeting. If he does not do the impossible and pull the alliance from the ashes, then perhaps he will at least end it peacefully.\n\nOf course, the location of a conference on the scale of this one is of paramount importance. Ciano had a private meeting with his adversary and party Secretary Scorza. This would have to be of mutual agreement. He would not have his own party spoiling the festivities by making a stink back home or whatever unlucky place was chosen for the conference. The question still remained, though; where would it be held? Rome wouldn't do, as the two other powers had already attacked Italy for seeing it as the center of the alliance. Nor would Madrid or Ankara; Ciano would not give Franco, Salazar, or İnönü the liberty of having home ground, nor would he allow themselves to be seen as the center of the Triumvirate. As he sat on the couch, drinking a glass of wine, he absent-mindedly checked the label, deep in thought. Maltese wine, his favorite. Wait, Malta!\n\nIt was perfect. On home turf, but not obnoxiously so. Rich, stable, and most importantly, no border disputes. There was the Mediterranean out of every window, glistening through everything it had survived, delicious food, an ethnically diverse population that managed to coexist. The perfect example. Scorza wouldn't like it, of course, but that was a moot point. Scorza wanted to show off the pride of fascism, Rome.\n\n"I'm a pragmatist," he thought to himself, proudly.\n\nThe illustrious Aurberge de Castille in Malta has been chosen and prepared as the site for the upcoming conference. It was Ciano's favorite place to rest whenever he departed to Malta. Surely his counterparts in Iberia and Turkey would be swept up in the extravagance of the hotel?"
maltaconference.1.a:0 "Send them!"

maltaconference.2.t:0 "Invitation to Iberia"
maltaconference.2.d:0 ""...As a formal member of the Triumvirate, the Caudillos of the Union of Iberia, Francisco Franco Bahamonde and António de Oliveira Salazar, are invited to the Conference that will be held in the Aurberge de Castille, Malta."\n\nFranco's name being put before Salazar's has already started a protocol crisis in the Portuguese government, though Caudillo Salazar is not personally concerned with this minor infraction. Iberia will be present at the Conference."
maltaconference.2.a:0 "Time to take a stand!"

maltaconference.3.t:0 "Invitation to Turkey"
maltaconference.3.d:0 ""...As a formal member of the Triumvirate, the President of the Republic of Turkey, Ismet Inönü, is invited to the Conference that will be held in the Aurberge de Castille, Malta."\n\n"About time!" Inönü said to himself.\n\n"Finally, that blind Italian realized that he can't ignore our demands forever."\n\nTurkey will be present in the Conference."
maltaconference.3.a:0 "Finally, a chance to push our claims!"

maltaconference.4.t:0 "Malta Conference Invitation"
maltaconference.4.d:0 ""...As a formal member of the Triumvirate, the Leader of [Root.GetName], [Root.GetLeader], is invited to the Conference that will be held in the Aurberge de Castille, Malta."\n\nIt seems Italy is holding a summit to determine the future of the Triumvirate. We will be present at the Conference."
maltaconference.4.a:0 "Let us hope for the best..."

maltaconference.5.t:0 "Ciano Gives the Opening Speech"
maltaconference.5.d:0 "Over the past few days, the delegates from around the Triumvirate have arrived. Tensions are high, and many attendees aren't exactly sure what the purpose of the conference is. Those questions, however, are set to be answered, as Duce Galeazzo Ciano takes the stage.\n\n"Honored delegates," he begins. "We have gathered here today to put aside our differences and reaffirm the greatness of our alliance - I know many of you have disputes and issues to raise, and this is the place to do it."\n\nMany in the audience are shocked by the bluntness of his words, but there are a few smiles.\n\n"At least he recognizes this is going to be a complete shitshow," murmurs one Turkish diplomat to another.\n\n"The Triumvirate was forged in fire," Ciano continues. "And as the world falls back into chaos we must be open and frank with one another if our alliance is to surivive. We are like brothers - squabbling sometimes, but always united in purpose and bound by familial love and common history." Ciano finished.\n\n"I now invite my brother from Turkey to take the stage.""
maltaconference.5.a:0 "Welcome all!"
maltaconference.5.b:0 "Let us get this over with..."

maltaconference.6.t:0 "Inönü's Speech"
maltaconference.6.d:0 "As Ciano steps down from the stage, the Turkish President, Ismet Inönü, walks forward, and while the Turkish delegation responds with raucous applause, the rest of the delegation is rather muted.\n\n"I will not bore you with bland pleasantries like the Duce."\n\nInönü's halting Italian is overcome by the directness of his words.\n\n"Ciano is right in one regard when he brings up our shared history - we have a history of disputed borders!" he roars.\n\nThe Turkish delegation responds with shouts and cheers, while the rest of the conference looks on sullenly. Many had expected such a response, but few were prepared for the directness of the President's words.\n\n"I am not opposed to the Triumvirate in and of itself," Inönü continues. "The collective security it offers is a blessing in this tumultuous world. But if Turkey is to continue to remain a member, we must have our ancestral lands back! We are fed up with European domination of our sphere of influence! I look forward to meeting with the leaders of our alliance to discuss our disputed claims, and their return to their rightful motherland, Türkiye!"\n\nThe Turkish delegation practically leap from their seats, slamming their feet on the ground and cheering."
maltaconference.6.a:0 "A great speech by our glorious leader!"
maltaconference.6.b:0 "Worrisome..."

maltaconference.7.t:0 "Franco and Salazar's Speech"
maltaconference.7.d:0 "After that dangerously inflammatory speech, it was time for the two Caudillos of Iberia to take the stage. The two walked together, rubbing shoulders in their attempts to follow formal protocol. Salazar spoke first.\n\n"Honored leaders," he began. "We wish to see the Triumvirate remain united just like our friend and ally President Inönü. And just like him we have disputes of our own to solve."\n\nFranco picked up here. "However, unlike him we will not resort to threats and nationalist agitation. We seek a truly equal agreement for all parties of the Triumvirate!"\n\nThis was met by jeers and heckling from some in the audience.\n\n"We are all equal partners in this great alliance! Remember, for whatever reason you are here, there is one issue more important than all the rest; the preservation of our Mediterranean brotherhood, one and united."\n\nThe two awkwardly took turns speaking for around half an hour, and while they were met with polite applause from the audience, a fair few had dozed off by the time they had finished."
maltaconference.7.a:0 "For the Mediterranean brotherhood!"
maltaconference.7.b:0 "When is this going to end?"

maltaconference.8.t:0 "The Opening of the Canal Conference"
maltaconference.8.d:0 "A major point of contention among the delegates is the Suez Canal.\n\nTransferred to Italian control following their victory in Egypt, they have held sole authority over transit over the canal since then, forcing other Triumvirate members to pay dues just like any other country outside the alliance. Iberia especially has long wanted access to the canal, as they lack the ground presence of Turkey in the region.\n\nItalian and Iberian delegates, with observers from the other Triumvirate member nations, have gathered in an opulent ballroom to discuss access to the canal."
maltaconference.8.a:0 "Let us begin!"

maltaconference.9.t:0 "Iberian Demands"
maltaconference.9.d:0 "In the first negotiating session, Iberian diplomat Fernando María Castiella y Maíz demanded Iberia have equal access to the canal. Deliberations continued for hours, until finally the Spaniard slammed his hand on the table.\n\n"You've held the canal for too damn long!" He yelled. "Why the hell should we, your ally, be forced to pay to use it?! We'll even give you a one-time lump sum of aid money, if you give us unlimited access. That's my final offer: you can take it or leave it!""
maltaconference.9.a:0 "Ridiculous, refuse outright!"
maltaconference.9.b:0 "Maybe we can come to an agreement..."
maltaconference.9.c:0 "Things are heating up..."

maltaconference.10.t:0 "Ciano Refuses"
maltaconference.10.d:0 "Ciano fires back: "Ridiculous! We've trusted you for twenty years and this is how you repay us? Offering a paltry sum for something we fought and bled for? Of course not. These negotiations are over!"\n\nThe Iberian delegates, shocked, reply.\n\n"This is outrageous! We expected to be treated as equals, not children!"\n\nThey continued by claiming they would not participate on later discussions over territorial disputes, and concluded with a scathing attack on Ciano.\n\n"We joined you decades ago because you promised equality and freedom from tyranny. But now? You're no better than the Germans! Lording over us like some petty Reichskommissariat! We're done with this conference!""
maltaconference.10.a:0 "Expected."

maltaconference.11.t:0 "Ciano Attempts to Negotiate"
maltaconference.11.d:0 "Ciano replies: "Gentlemen! Let's be civil here! I'm not sure if I'm willing to take that trade, but perhaps we can come to another agreement."\n\nThe Iberian delegation nods warily. Ciano and other Italian delegates quickly leave the room, quietly whispering, while the Iberians deliberate among themselves."
maltaconference.11.a:0 "Let us see how this goes..."

maltaconference.12.t:0 "Iberian Counteroffer"
maltaconference.12.d:0 "They rejoin a few hours later.\n\n"What about Algeria?" Castiella y Maiz broaches. "We'll take it - and that little insurrection - off your hands if we just forget this whole dispute. Your colonial forces are overextended and you know it.""
maltaconference.12.a:0 "That may be a bit too much..."

maltaconference.13.t:0 "Ciano Refuses Again"
maltaconference.13.d:0 "Ciano fires back: "Ridiculous! We've trusted you for twenty years and this is how you repay us? Trying to steal our territory that we fought and bled for? Of course not. These negotiations are over!"\n\nThe Iberian delegates, shocked, reply.\n\n"This is outrageous! We expected to be treated as equals, not children!"\n\nThey continued by claiming they would not participate on later discussions over territorial disputes, and concluded with a scathing attack on Ciano.\n\n"We joined you decades ago because you promised equality and freedom from tyranny. But now? You're no better than the Germans! Lording over us like some petty Reichskommissariat! We're done with this conference!""
maltaconference.13.a:0 "Not surprising."

maltaconference.14.t:0 "Iberia Won't Attend Border Conference"
maltaconference.14.d:0 "True to their word, the Iberian delegates were nowhere to be seen this morning as the various dignitaries took their seats for the border conference.\n\nTurkish diplomats looked relieved, while Italian delegates shared worried glances. Ciano feared the conference was collapsing around him."
maltaconference.14.a:0 "More for us!"
maltaconference.14.b:0 "Let them have their charade."

maltaconference.15.t:0 "The Start of the Border Conference"
maltaconference.15.d:0 "By and far the largest conflict present in the Triumvirate are the many border disputes that have sparked up in the Triumvirate, between all three members. For this problem to be resolved, there will be two full days dedicated to negotiating over the nature of these disputed territories. The event started with the noticeable lack of Iberian diplomats, as they informed their hosts that they refused to attend it beforehand, as if they're holier than us all. The President, Ismet Inönü, took the podium, with an oversized chart of the Eastern Mediterranean following behind him, among the rest of the entourage. He began to explain the convoluted ancient importance of Cyprus and Rhodes to Turkey and the demographics of the islands, particularly what Inönü described as "the overwhelming majority of ethnic, pure Turks."\n\nRhodes and Cyprus, controlled by the Italians and their Greek client state, have long been a thorn in Turkey's side, due in part to the large minority of Turks, but also more importantly because of their vital strategic importance, serving as inlets into the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. As the Triumvirate deteriorates, and with the Italo-Turkish relationship becoming one of thinly veiled threats and backhand slaps instead of friends and allies, Inönü has become much more vocal regarding the issue of these "Rightfully Turkish" lands being denied union with the Turkish state.\n\n"Our demands are clear. We only ask for what has been ours for a millenia." were the words of Inönü on the proposed concessions. "We will not back down, we will not fold, we will not stop, until we have it." - a reminder on what action Turkey will surely take should their demands be refused."
maltaconference.15.a:0 "You too? Our answer is no."
maltaconference.15.b:0 "Maybe we can come to an agreement?"
maltaconference.15.c:0 "Looks like the Iberians aren't the only ones..."
maltaconference.15.e:0 "Cyprus and Rhodes are rightfully ours!"

maltaconference.16.t:0 "Ciano Negotiates"
maltaconference.16.d:0 "Ciano pauses.\n\n"I think we can make a deal here. Those islands were originally naval bases. They aren't terribly useful as parts of the mainland, so I think we can come to some sort of agreement."\n\nİnönü nods as well. "Excellent. Let's meet and discuss this.""
maltaconference.16.a:0 "Worth a shot."

maltaconference.17.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down"
maltaconference.17.d:0 "Negotiations had been going well, with the status of some of the islands decided.\n\nAt least, until Inönü snapped.\n\n"Why do you insist on treating us as inferiors?" He yelled at Ciano. "Why are you acting like some benevolent god restoring these islands to us?! You should be apologizing and paying reparations for your illegal colonial occupation! These islands aren't yours to give away! They are Turkish by blood!""
maltaconference.17.a:0 "It had to end like that."

maltaconference.18.t:0 "Ciano Refuses to Negotiate"
maltaconference.18.d:0 "Ciano shook his head.\n\n"We will not be bullied into giving up land." He said solemnly. "We need those islands as bases. We're more than willing to give joint control over the bas-"\n\nInönü cut him off. "Bastard! I knew it was a mistake coming here! You just want to continue your domination of the Mediterranean, using us as pawns! I'm through with your empty promises!""
maltaconference.18.a:0 "Predictable."

maltaconference.19.t:0 "A Meeting in Saint Julian's"
maltaconference.19.d:0 "The President sat in his chair and leaned back, taking a heavy sip of his wine.\n\n"You know it as well as me, Franco. Ciano's not folding to either of our terms. Nothing penetrating that thick skull of his. All we have to do is show him we can cooperate. I'm telling you, this is how we can get to him!"\n\nFranco looked disinterested, and turned his gaze to the Mediterranean. "Really? And what do you suggest we cooperate on? We aren't prone to working together, if you haven't noticed."\n\nSalazar attempted to butt in, but Inönü spoke before he could. "Just open up a border conflict. You don't have to commit much. It won't be large, I assure you. Help me out on this one, or I guarantee I will not have your back when your regime collapses."\n\nThat had gained Franco's attention. "Alright. I'll talk to some of my generals on it. I can't guarantee any-"\n\n"No, you can't guarantee anything. Not without my permission."\n\nFranco was beginning to get frustrated with his Portuguese friend, but he would not crack under pressure.\n\n"You're right. Do you agree to this proposal, Salazar?"\n\n"Yes. Let's call the generals."\n\nThe 'secret' meeting became public knowledge, though each leader refused to comment on the specifics. If there was one thing that the Triumvirate could cooperate on, it was killing each other." 
maltaconference.19.a:0 "Backstabbing traitors!"
maltaconference.19.b:0 "Maybe we can find common ground..."

maltaconference.20.t:0 "The Malta Conference Has Been Bombed!"
maltaconference.20.d:0 "The first reports that reached Rome were sporadic and disjointed. A fire had broken out in the city of Birgu. The Turks had prepared a trap and invaded Malta. The Kriegsmarine were shelling the Fort St. Angelo. Someone tried to shoot Il Duce.\n\nAttempts to verify anything were unsuccessful, as the phone lines to the conference site were all down. Some tried to formulate all this into a single narrative, but it was so self-contradictory that it was fruitless. All anyone could do was wait and pray for good news.\n\nThankfully, it was a wait of only several minutes until it was confirmed that the Duce was alive and would be returning to Rome posthaste. The clearer details also began to trickle in: a bomb went off in the Fort St. Angelo, obliterating the conference room, and both the President and the Caudillos survived unscathed due to good timing. The identity of the bomber is unknown, and if it was done by any of the Triumvirate's other member states, it is unlikely they will take responsibility. Some in Rome have already begun pointing fingers at Iberia and Turkey, and there are undoubtedly those who will accuse us.\n\nWhile tensions were high going into the meeting, now they are absolutely astronomical. If the bomber's goal was to sow chaos in the Mediterranean, then he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams."
maltaconference.20.a:0 "Just when it couldn't get any worse..."

maltaconference.21.t:0 "Iberia and Turkey Blame Italy, Withdraw Delegates"
maltaconference.21.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, out of all the members of the Triumvirate, nobody is willing to take responsibility of the bombings. Though Italy claims they had nothing to do with the bombing as they had zero incentive to do so, this has not stopped Iberia and Turkey blaming the Italians for the whole fiasco. Both Iberia and Turkey have withdrawn their delegates from the conference stating that it is clear they are not safe for them to be there."
maltaconference.21.a:0 "No, wait...!"
maltaconference.21.b:0 "Time to end this charade!"

maltaconference.22.t:0 "Death of the Triumvirate"
maltaconference.22.d:0 "From a very secure undisclosed location in Rome, Duce Ciano has announced with a heavy heart on national television that the mutual bonds of the Triumvirate's member states are to be dissolved, effective immediately. While he emphasized how much it was his idea, and its success at deterring German warmongering, it is painfully clear that the alliance would not have been long for this world, even without the bombing. It was the inevitable outcome for a union of nations with proud leaders, opposing goals, and competing spheres of influence.\n\nNo doubt that the news is being met with acrimonious agreement in Madrid and Ankara, a mix of happiness that they are finally free and annoyance that they were denied the opportunity to dramatically quit first. But the threat of Germany still looms large in the minds of many, and there may be an hour of need where the Triumvirate will be sorely missed. But that hour is still far away, and few will mourn the Triumvirate's passing tonight."
maltaconference.22.a:0 "So it goes."
