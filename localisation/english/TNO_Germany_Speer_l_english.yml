 POLITICS_SPEER_GERMANY_DESC:0 "Many things are said of Albert Speer, yet none can deny his ambition.\n\nUnlike many others, he did not join the NSDAP that fateful day in 1931 for the late Führer's fiery rhetoric. It was Adolf Hitler's calm and collected speech given during a rally in Berlin that intoxicated the young architect, leading him to join the Party the year after.\n\nWhat started as a favor to a fellow member became a recommendation to Joseph Goebbels; the recommendation became a commission to renovate the local NSDAP headquarters. Before long, he had drawn the personal interest of the Führer. Hitler became a passionate admirer of his vision, and together they drafted plans of a new Germany.\n\nBy the war's end, Speer was a close friend of the Führer, presided over his own ministry and touted a reputation as the man who transformed the Reich's economy into a war-winning machine. No matter the cost of life, the dream of a new Germany had been realized. Reputation is rarely truth - but he made sure that everyone knew of his.\n\nIt was in the midst of Germania's construction that the economy crashed, and his lofty dreams with it. Pinning the blame was easy. Slavery, the very system Speer created to win the war, doomed Germany in peace. It was an unprecedented disaster - one that Speer could not ignore. The Reich and Volk deserved greatness. His dreams deserved reality. Reform was necessary.\n\nYears of open criticism of NSDAP policy followed, and he soon found himself somewhere unexpected once again: as the figurehead of the largest reform movement Germany had seen in decades. Speer's ambitious goals and reputation as a dissenter enveloped countless of young dreamers and old rivals around him in a political maelstrom unlike any other.\n\nAnd as he now walks this perilous tightrope he crafted, he balances not only his own future but also that of the Reich."

 POLITICS_NATSOC_SPEER_DESC:0 "There was a time where Albert Speer could stand in front of a podium on a crowd of thousands and speak words that would get any normal German man ousted as a traitor, and shot for cowardice and Bolshevism. Of course, he never was committed to most of what he had said, merely words spoken to rile up his base and strengthen his support. Yet Albert Speer overestimated his prowess, and underestimated the hardliners.\n\nWhat fate awaited him at the hands of the Gang of Four was now merely a passing thought. His worries of being a puppet to the liberalistic whims of the students seemed almost like paranoia now, as he follows the orders of Theodor Oberländer and his clique in the NSDAP. His image as the 'reformer' of the Reich has dissolved, and all the remains is a man whose vision has been stomped underfoot by the degeneration of National Socialist ideology.\n\nThere are no more days where Albert Speer can smile and think to himself that he is building a new Reich, for the new German man. Now he follows orders and attempts to slow the grinding crusher that will tear his ideology into pieces. He cannot imagine that Adolf Hitler would look at him and consider his achievements worthy of respect.\n\nNot anymore."

 POLITICS_FASH_SPEER_DESC:0 "No longer was Albert Speer merely the architectural genius behind many of Hitler's grandiose plans. No longer was Albert Speer the Minister of Armaments and War Production during Germany's finest hour. He was not the side-character who pulled Germany out of failure when it sunk to its depths before he took the reins. No longer was Albert Speer the political webspinner and silver tongue that got a loose alliance of vaguely-loyal liberals and yesmen to back him as he spun an image of being a reformist force. Albert Speer was no longer the "good" National Socialist.\n\nNow he stands as the representation of a new National Socialism, fit to serve the modern era, and the modern man.\n\nThe fruitless endeavors of the past NSDAP - the need to exterminate the East, to turn Germany into the ultimate pariah state, to close it off utterly and let it wallow in bitter autarky. None of those policies belonged in his vision of a new Reich. His Einheitspakt and his Zollverein would be a well-oiled machine, propagating German domination not through wasteful pits of death that would only antagonize its colonies, but instead through a showcase of cultural, moral, economic and military supremacy. As Germany soars with a bureaucracy purified of degenerate liberals and bloodthirsty hardliners, Albert Speer finds himself at the top as the architect unmatched.\n\nHitler may have set the grounds for Germany's wings to fly high, but Speer will make sure that it will fly victorious.\n\n§RForever§!."

 POLITICS_AUTHDEM_SPEER_DESC:0 "National Socialism has failed. It has failed all of the challenges it has met, and it is now doomed to extinction... and who is to blame?\n\nAlbert Speer finds himself with daggers pointed everywhere around him, but he knows that it is the NSDAP that has ruined him; the liberals that have degraded the moral fiber of German society; the wretched Gang undermining him every step of the way. How he ever could have trusted those three; Tresckow, Erhard, and most especially Schmidt - it was beyond him. Most days he spends staring blankly in his office, absent-mindedly shuffling paper after paper, knowing that the power of the Führer is merely a ploy. If only he had played his cards better.\n\nAs the future begins to leave the architect behind, and his vision yet fades while the NSDAP falls apart, a new path has opened up, promising many things, though nobody can say for sure what it will contain. As countless Germans still march against National Socialism, they demand something robbed from them half a century ago. Something Speer is deathly afraid will crush Hitler's dream now and forevermore. The calls for elections, for the abolishment of permanent posts, the rallying call of what was once a delusion, now rapidly approaching reality...\n\nDemocracy.\n\nAlbert Speer has failed. Or so it may seem. A defanged and depowered Führer delegated to mere rubber stamping, with eyes surrounding him and watching his every move, and yet, at the same time, the Gang treats him as a fool and a puppet, a disgrace to Hitler's vision and nobody of importance.\n\n§RHow foolish they are§!."

 GER_Kurt_Georg_Kiesinger_hog_desc:0 "§YStellvertreter des Führers\nRight Wing Populism§!\n--------------\n§LKurt Georg Kiesinger was once a successful lawyer, being offered highly respectable positions in both the Chamber Court of Berlin and the Nationalsozialistischer Rechtswahrerbund, but turning them down in favor of remaining an independent actor within the profession. When the war began, Kiesinger joined the Foreign Ministry to avoid being drafted into combat, eventually finding a position within the broadcasting arm. However, Kiesinger eventually came under suspicion for "hampering anti-Jewish activities." While he was never found guilty, it is widely considered to be one of the main reasons Kiesinger left his position after the war, returning to work as a lawyer.\n\nAs the dysfunctionality of the Reich became more apparent, however, Kiesinger found himself drawn towards politics, where he began to preach the need for reform if the Reich were to survive. Dubbed "Silver Tongue Kiesinger" for his incredibly persuasive oration. Kiesinger was eventually approached by Albert Speer, and became part of his "Gang of Four", taking upon himself the mantle of the second most powerful man in the Speerite movement.\n\nThe mouth of the reformist movement, Kiesinger is not often found far from its head, Speer himself. When Speer's ideas (or the ideas of any of the Gang of Four) are questioned, it is often Kiesinger who manages to smooth the tensions, effortlessly persuading doubters of the necessity of Speer's reforms. Silver Tongue holds little love for the NSDAP, but as anyone who heard his speeches could tell you, he cares greatly for the German nation.§!"
 GER_Kurt_Georg_Kiesinger_hog_3_desc:0 "§YStellvertreter des Führers\nReformed National Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LSnake. Dissident. Speerite. Traitor. Kurt Georg Kiesinger has been labelled and insulted by many people over the last ten years, but never before has anyone dared to call him a silent man. Until now.\n\nThe catastrophe of the Oil Crisis has been placed at the feet of Ludwig Erhard and his radical economic reforms. The outbreak of the Slave Revolt has been pinned on the hesitation and incompetence of Henning von Tresckow. Helmut Schmidt has been blamed for the embarrassingly conciliatory negotiations. Yet Kurt Georg Kiesinger, who is no stranger to these three Dissidents, has retreated from the limelight into the shadowy corridors of the Reichstag. He has nothing to say to the forces of democracy within the Reich. He has nothing to say to the crumbling Dissident wing within the NSDAP. All that escapes from his lips is muted praise of Albert Speer and the Reformists.\n\nA growing number of voices are unhappy with Kiesinger's position as Deputy Führer, considering his former allies. Once the charismatic mouth of the Reformist movement, it appears that Kiesinger has delegated that position to Speer himself. A question is spreading throughout the Party: Has the Silver Tongue stopped wagging?§!"

Kiesinger may have acted as subservient to the Führer and his country, but he is no less inclined on the prospects of liberal democracy as the rest of his comrades. Now that the country has found itself on a new path, the Silver Tongue's voice will be louder than ever in the coming years of what is sure to be incredible political turmoil. Yet, Kiesinger is assured in his skills and his ability to defuse the massive bomb known as democratization, for he has immersed himself in danger his entire life.§!"

 GER_Helmut_Schmidt_for_desc:0 "§YReichsminister des Auswärtigen\nOligarchy§!\n--------------\n§LComing from a less than certain familial background and a less than glamorous career, Helmut Schmidt is a relative newcomer to the political scene. In his childhood, Schmidt served as a leader for the Hitler Youth, until he was removed from that position for expressing sentiments believed to be against the party. He served in the Luftwaffe during the war, both as an administrator and later, in combat on the Eastern Front. After the war, Schmidt returned to his home city of Hamburg, receiving degrees in both economics and political science from a local university. He began to speak against the German Reich and their policies, though never so brazenly as to attract attention from the NSDAP.\n\nSomehow, Schmidt seemed to have attracted the attention of Albert Speer, who courted him to join the Speerite faction of the Nazi Party. Schmidt always refused these entreatments by Speer, both out of genuine disgust held for the Nazi Party and ideology, and because he feared that the NSDAP would uncover his most closely kept secret. With the outbreak of the German Civil War, however, Schmidt joined the organization, in exchange for the position of foreign minister in Speer's government.\n\nNot as politically connected as Kiesinger nor as technically skilled as Tresckow and Erhard, Schmidt is something of the dark horse amongst the Gang's members. Some believe he only reached his position due to Speer holding personal affection for the man, though he holds undeniable political acumen. The young firebrand clearly holds a great passion for his ideals, though it remains to see how much of his vision will come to pass.§!"

He has been the spearhead of the coup that managed to finally bring the fist down onto the NSDAP's dominance, and this has led to the dam of National Socialism cracking and breaking down, more rapidly than even the most optimistic people would have assumed. Many flock to the streets in a new sprint for choosing their political sides, others harden and double down on their stances, and some retreat into their homes, vividly aware that these events repeat a certain downfall of a certain country so many decades ago.\n\nFaced with an overwhelming sense of dread and aspiration, Helmut Schmidt will keep his head high above the sea of worry. He considers himself but one man in the storm known as world history, but he has made his mark nonetheless - and knows he cannot stop here. The process of denazification begins at the first step, and ends when Germany's tricolor can proudly wave above every city in the country, and every German can hold their hand to their chest and be happy knowing that they have left their bloody past behind.\n\nHow far he will go to achieve this is not known, but Schmidt knows that sometimes a forceful hand may be necessary to persuade the uncertain.§!"

During the Second World War, however, he was the subject of controversy when he published a paper claiming that, although the Germans would win the war, the Reich's economy would disintegrate within a decade. Because of this paper, he was fired from his job, only to be proven right during the German Economic Collapse.\n\nNowadays, Erhard is one of Germany's most important economists, and one of its most ill-mannered bureaucrats. Erhard is a strong advocate of Ordoliberalism, a school of economic thought calling for no price controls and low taxation, believing that this will permit a free market to operate at its potential best. Naturally this idea, very different from the Reich's current model of economic thought, is widely despised by many officials within the Reich's economic ministries. Erhard, despite this, has been unwilling to settle for the status quo, and calls for sweeping change within the German market.\n\nBecause of these strict calls for change and liberalization, Erhard has become a core member of the "Gang of Four", a group of reformers that consists of Albert Speer's closest advisors. Known for his extraordinary stubbornness, brashness, and immediate dismissal of any sort of compromise on his bold plans, Erhard leads Speer's plans for economic reform.

Yet, in the end, with the government gritting its teeth and Erhard tightening its belt, they made it. Now, from one hoop of fire they enter another one, one which Erhard must look straight into the eyes and march on forward, just as he always has. For nothing is stable and nothing is sacred, for here and now in these very next steps in history will show whether or not Erhard will remain the genius of Germany, or its fool.\n\nBut what the people think of him does not matter.

Following the War, Hitler personally appointed him as Reichsminister for Civil Aviation and Stabschef of the SA.\n\nThe meteoric rise of this infamously blunt careerist was eventually hampered by the corrupt thug Martin Bormann, who sabotaged Jordan's run for Reichstag President by fielding his own candidate and inadvertently allowing Oberländer to sneak in. Disgusted by Party corruption and bureaucratic incompetence (and terrified by Bormann's increasing power), Jordan openly sided with Albert Speer's Reformist wing in the late 1950s, forging important links between Speer and the Conservative NSDAP. Speer's triumph saw him rewarded for his efforts with the Reich Ministry of the Interior.\n\nAt last, Rudolf Jordans holds the coveted title once owned by Martin Bormann.

Once a Staff Leader within the Hitlerjugend, Mußgnug's political ascension and developing law degree were interrupted by the outbreak of the West Russian War. The experience dramatically affected the twenty-year-old, who returned from the front lines two years later to complete his degree and join Walther Hewel's Foreign Ministry.\n\nMußgnug soon gravitated towards a circle of Reformist diplomats which included Kurt Waldheim and Helmut Schmidt. The sheer incompetence displayed by the Reich during the West Russian War fueled his drive for reform, pushing him to risk his political career by supporting Albert Speer's claim to leadership. His gamble paid off, and Mußgnug was appointed as the State Secretary of Foreign Affairs under Helmut Schmidt in the 1960s.\n\nBehind the diplomat's mischievous smile and cold eyes lies a burning passion to save the Reich from itself. His eyes are firmly fixed on Schmidt's crumbling throne, and some say he has already drawn up a list of dissidents within the Foreign Ministry to be purged without hesitation.§!"

While madmen and militarists cheered on the torrent of needless bloodshed and havoc that the Reich had become, greater men instead took action. Theodor Oberländer, President of the Reichstag, was the foremost of those great men.\n\nA long-time vocal critic of the Führer's more radical policies, Oberländer's criticism of the government's handling of the slaves was scathing. As the government began to collapse and the liberals took to the street, Oberländer made use of his connections within the legislature and Abwehr to secure support within Germania. In a move of dubious legality, the Reichstag voted to offer significant emergency powers to their own president to deal with this unprecedented crisis.\n\nAlthough Speer is Führer, it is now clear who rules the Reich. After witnessing the Führer's collapse, Oberländer is only reaffirmed in his belief in measured, intelligent change to National Socialism, which he has boldly begun enacting. As the President slowly chips away at the Enabling Laws, Speer becomes less and less relevant to his own government. A truly reformed global power will be reborn in the chambers of the Volkshalle, and all of Germany will know that Oberländer is the man who saved the dream of a Thousand Year Reich.§!"

Iran is the Reich's largest source of petroleum; without it it will be nigh impossible for us to climb out of this crisis. We must get involved!"

In our hearts, we know ourselves to be the undisputed masters of this world, but the powers of Japan and the United States further eclipse our glory with every passing day.

Why, if the Führer was infallible, are we so benighted and feeble? Change must come, but it would go against everything that makes the Reich what it is!

Yet even the mightiest of leaders need associates, friends... and loyal servants.

And yet, the precise location of their own loyalties are entirely up for debate...\n\nKurt Georg Kiesinger. Helmut Schmidt. Ludwig Erhard. Henning von Tresckow - the 'Gang of Four'.

Never mind the fact that the entire Reich is a smoking ruin, they already clamor for protest action and disobedience to the Führer!\n\nPerhaps much of this unrest can be traced back to Speer's relative silence following the victory. He has not even issued a formal victory speech yet, which particularly worries the reformists in the Wehrmacht. Wishing to rectify the situation, the Führer has accepted the recommendations of his subordinates and will shortly announce a formal victory parade, to be held in Nuremberg.

Due to our heartland in the war being the Rhineland, millions of slaves fell under our jurisdiction. Though they could have taken the risk against our army and their guards, they continued their important work with renewed vigor thanks to the Führer's promises. Though there were always a few radicals who had to be dealt with, the majority of slaves performed admirably, no doubt buoyed by the respectful and humane approach of our kind Führer. Any other self-proclaimed Führer would have worked these unfortunates to death in the pursuit of victory! Their loyalty to the Reich has been decisively proven and should be rewarded. The Rhineland's slaves will be reorganized into the 'Führer's Own' Loyal Labor Divisions; they will be granted better housing, higher-quality rations, less oversight and can expect particularly favorable treatment when the time comes to implement the Führer's labor reforms.

This will give our people time to adjust - not just to their 'fortunes' becoming worth less, but also to the responsibility of living a more fruitful and luxurious lifestyle.

Who are they to question the mandate, rightfully claimed, that the Führer holds? Would they dare to question Hitler, too, merely because they disagreed with him on a few trifling matters? It was the collective will of the German people that granted political dominance to the Führer, not the backroom politicking of career politicians!\n\nMore than that, the entire world is watching. Doubtless they are aware of our weakened and divided state, circling like vultures over the beleaguered Reich. Well, they shall soon see that our new Führer is no pale imitation of Hitler, but a true visionary and reformer!

He is a man raised from amongst their number, given a commission from the people to rule responsibly and do his utmost to ensure the good health and prosperity of the Volksgemeinschaft. He was once a simple architect from a middle-class family; he was not born into power, nor did he attain his position through dishonorable political machinations. Albert Speer represents all that is greatest in the German people - and that greatness is made possible by you, the noblest of races.\n\nSounds good, doesn't it? The Führer, being unused to speechmaking, has largely left the matter of propaganda to Kiesinger. The internal politics of the Reich might be complex, but they don't concern the man in the street. What he and the tens of millions of his fellow Germans care about is knowing that their Führer loves, trusts and respects them, and that he will do his utmost to help them.

The Party is the bedrock of our success, the embodiment of National Socialist spirit! Our Führer might disagree with them on a regular basis, but is debate not the fuel from which knowledge is forged? Whatever their past differences, he will welcome the Party's overtures, working together with Hitler's most treasured creation for the good of the Reich.\n\nIt's not an easy line to toe, but it must be done. The people, after all, are fickle. Their support ebbs and flows with the Reich's economic status - who knows where relying too heavily on them might lead us? Though the NSDAP is barely trustworthy, they are as a great, deeply-rooted oak in the soil of Germany: strong, reliable and unyielding. Without them, the Führer walks on uncertain ground."

Would he ever betray the very ideals which brought the Reich to the pinnacle of greatness? No! Those who doubt, who call on the words of Bormann when they deride him as soft and disloyal, will see in time that he is unwaveringly committed to maintaining the spirit of the Reich exactly as it is. Reform is coming to the Reich, but not at the expense of its soul.\n\nA bitter pill indeed, but necessary. The NSDAP is too dangerous to cross, and remains steadfastly in control of the Reich's bureaucracy. By proving his fidelity to National Socialist ideals, perhaps the Führer can bring them in line and shore up his power. Popular support will only get one so far in politics; at some point, one must face facts and adjust course accordingly. The Führer will be vindicated, in the end."

Even as the cloud of civil strife passes over the far horizon, shadows fall upon us once more. Whispers of something far more dangerous and destabilizing than a few protests have reached Gehlen's ears... as has a name. A single name, uttered in awe by the downtrodden and in fear by the mighty.

As we well know, complication is the last thing Germany needs any more of.\n\nA delegation is to be sent, firstly to reestablish any temporarily abrogated governmental ties but also, more importantly, to facilitate their return to the Pakt.

A decorated hero of the war, Hanneken is foremostly loyal to his Vaterland and will work with us to reintegrate the Reichskommissariat to the benefit of The Reich without question. This is not a completely beneficial situation, however, as Hanneken is a noted militarist who has made his political opinions known on many occasions.

Gifts like these rarely present themselves, and even though he was not universally hailed in our Reich, he will be hailed now as the savior of the Danish lands and a facilitator of Germany's return to the world stage.

In the wings of our administration whispers are forming of the example this sets for our other occupied territories, but is this not the exact kind of example we want the peoples of The Reich to follow? Though not a born German, Martinsen is instilled like any other with the primacy and importance of Germany's mission and will work steadfastly towards this goal.

 GER_advisers_for_the_kommissars_desc:0 "To keep the war going on for as long as we need, we will send our Kommissars some of our best men to teach them how to do their jobs.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that we want them to succeed. As long as we can provide for the advisors, the distraction they provide and the usefulness of their expertise will keep the Kommissars from noticing too much of what we really want to do."
 GER_a_game_of_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Reich suffered devastatingly from a civil war mere months ago. To launch ourselves in a military endeavor against the United States, even if only by proxy, is too risky: despite the potential rewards, what von Tresckow proposes will only worsen our already precarious situation, and risk enraging the common populace who wouldn't understand the renewed waste of human lives.\n\nReichsminister Schmidt offers a much more balanced solution. We can't abandon our colonial possession without a fight, but we'll limit our support in order to balance our interests with those of the United States: by keeping the war in a stalemate, we can broker an agreement that suits both competitors' wishes."
 GER_cover_the_damages_desc:0 "Sad as it may be, Reichsminister Schmidt is right. With our difficult internal situation, we need to fully focus all resources at our disposal on rebuilding Germany: we can't embark on a new war so soon after our nation was torn apart by a civil war! Instead, we'll make sure that the loss of our African colonial domains can at least bring some financial advantages.\n\nBy sending enough reinforcements and supplies to the Reichskommissars, we can stall the war long enough to extract all valuable resources and investments from Afrika, before retreating our forces and leaving Hüttig to his fate. After all, it was his decision to plunge the colonies into war: his choice, his responsibility..."
 GER_soften_the_blow_desc:0 "In order to reduce our losses, we need to act fast. All assets, both physical and financial, belonging to either the government or German companies will be immediately liquidated, productive or not. As soon as this phase is done, we'll proceed to transfer all remaining resources, personnel and material to the mainland while the fight still goes on.\n\nOur men on the front won't appreciate this, and some at home will accuse us of cowardice, but we have neither the resources nor the time to fight a useless war for a land that will soon erupt in chaos. Evacuation efforts will begin as soon as possible, so that the blow, when it falls, won't be as harsh as we fear."
 GER_youre_on_your_own_desc:0 "Reichsminister Schmidt is currently overseeing the asset liquidation and the evacuation of all personnel and resources remaining. Despite the protests from the Reichskommissars, and some backlash from our own people, operations proceed smoothly, and the first cargo ships are unloading everything we managed to salvage.\n\nOil, silver, gold and diamonds will be enough to fund several of our industrial and financial programmes, though we'll have to face the shame of defeat. The Reichsminister has been rather... shaken by the fact that even some of his proposed initiatives will be funded thanks to resources extracted by slaves, but we have little time for sentimentalism."
 GER_do_what_we_must_desc:0 "Tresckow has made a great point for the Führer to consider. He has said that if we used this war to boost the morale of our people, it would be a good way for us to deal with the militarists who are still in the Reich.\n\nOf course, this means supporting the idiots who got us in this mess. But the Führer has made his mind up.\n\nWe will do whatever it takes to "win" this war of theirs."
 GER_send_everything_desc:0 "From bullets and bandages up to the finest artillery pieces and the greatest of our technology, we will do what we can to make it look like the Reichskommissariats have a chance at winning this war. Of course, that's the best thing we could for the people who carelessly set the continent on fire because they wanted to mess with another country that lured the OFN in.\n\nSo we're delivering the best of our Fatherland's armed forces to reach for the victory that we "hope" to attain."
 GER_men_for_the_boers_desc:0 "So, there are people in the Reich who are so willing to help us "reach" for that victory that they've come seeking permission to serve as volunteers. Of course, we will gladly accept their requests and send them along their way into the war they surely believe will earn the Fatherland another achievement on the global scale.\n\nThis would surely show how sympathetic we are towards our Boer cousins. They are part of the German family after all."
 GER_and_then_some_desc:0 "Surely, we have sent all we can give. And surely, we will send some more.\n\nThis great war for the Fatherland, with our men eagerly devoted to the cause of our African territories, shall see our might through the scale of aid we can deliver. After all, we are so willing to achieve victory over our enemies in the south! More aid and more men shall do what is "possible" to gain."
 GER_supplies_for_the_kommissars_desc:0 "With the limited number of our forces in Afrika, we need to ensure that each of our soldiers can fight at peak efficiency. In a private meeting, Feldmarschall von Tresckow has suggested sending the... right kind of medicine to our troops at the front. Stimulants to be precise or - as they are more commonly known - combat drugs.\n\nAs a proud Prussian, von Tresckow despises such underhanded methods, but even he can't deny our difficult situation. If we want to win, we'll have to fight dirty, no matter the price, even if we have to lose our honor in the process..."
 GER_a_display_of_force_desc:0 "Von Tresckow is right. Despite our precarious situation, we can't shy away from our role as a world power: our colonial possession are important pieces in the great chessboard that is the Reich, and we won't go down without a fight! Of course, we won't begin a direct confrontation with the United States, but we still have a handful of cards at our disposal.\n\nWe'll send the Reichskommissars all the resources they need in order to prevail, as long as it doesn't require the full commitment of the mainland. Under the labels of "increased security garrisons" and "logistical supplies" we'll be able to justify our reinforcements to the rest of the world, and not even the Amerikaner will be able to protest: after all, they are doing exactly the same..."
 GER_show_off_our_pride_desc:0 "Feldmarschall von Tresckow is right. We are a world superpower, and won't allow the Amerikaner and their puppets to meddle in the empire so many Germans died for: each and every part of the Reich is as important to us as Germania itself, and we won't go down without a fight!\n\nThe Reichskommissars will have all they need to prevail and secure our African holdings, and we'll organize several special operations in order to surgically strike at the enemy, weakening them and allowing our main forces to prevail. Still, we need to act fast, or the costs of such an operation may be more than what our people is ready to accept..."
 GER_another_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "Warfare may have changed since the last time we faced the Amerikaner in battle, but the basic principles are still the same. With good logistics, careful planning and a large concentration of mobile and armored forces, we can enact a Schwerpunkt in the weak point of the enemy forces, breaking their front and circling their forces without a chance for them to react.\n\nShould this tactic fail, then we'll have to rely on our soldiers' inner strength and discipline. Ever since the old days of Prussian glory, we have prevailed over superior enemies thanks to our superior training and organization: von Tresckow has plans to return the Wehrmacht to full efficiency, and this proxy war is a perfect simulation that will give us precious insights over the needed reforms."
 GER_just_like_old_times_desc:0 "Feldmarschall von Tresckow is quite satisfied with our forces' performance in the conflict. It seems that, after almost twenty years of decadence and neglect, old values such as discipline, meritocracy and organization are slowly returning to the forefront. Despite all the difficulties we might encounter during this strange conflict, we are slowly finding our common cause and camaraderie.\n\nPerhaps this war won't go according to our plans and wishes, but this is already a result. Our forces fight together well, seeing each other once again as brothers-in-arms rather than potential traitors or enemies, and coordination is improving steadily as time passes. This feels just like the old times..."
 GER_finish_what_we_started_desc:0 "The time has come. With our interests protected and our plans fulfilled, we can now retreat from our African possessions: in but a few weeks, all remaining troops and administrative personnel will be evacuated by plane or ship, effectively ending our presence in the Dark Continent. As soon as the last plane has taken off, our colonial empire will be no more.\n\nWhile a sad and humiliating choice, this was the best outcome we could hope for under the present circumstances. At home, many accuse us of cowardice for abandoning our rightfully-conquered lands, but many others rejoice for the end of what they considered a waste of lives and resources. Time will tell who is right..."
 GER_leave_without_a_trace_desc:0 "With our final preparations complete, the extraction and evacuation procedures have begun in earnest. Our forces on the field will retreat, together with any official of the Reichskommissariate who wishes to abandon Africa, to selected airstrips, where an air bridge will ensure smooth transport to Germany. All heavy equipment will be extracted by ship or, if it proves impossible, abandoned under the insignia of the Reichskommissars in order to mask our presence.\n\nThe Amerikaner have tacitly promised not to attack the evacuation convoys, under condition that we do the same. To the rest of the world, it will be as if we were never part of this war, a small ink stain on a blank page: it will be relegated to the darkest corner in the labyrinthine archives of history, as we leave without a warning, without a sound, without a trace..."
 GER_bear_no_responsibility_desc:0 "We have nothing to do with these Kommissars who waged war without our permission. We wash our hands clean of the blood of this war, and our Führer is not to deal with guilt concerning the conflict.\n\nWe did what we could as master of our territories. But this war is clearly not our war. It was a dirty war. A foolish one.\n\nWe must begin cleansing ourselves of the filth."

He has sought to follow the example of the madman Himmler, and now the natives have risen up, laying waste to his dreams of a Burgundian state in the mountains.\n\nAnd unfortunately for him and the natives, we must end all this. It is time to call upon the mighty force of our Fatherland to bring order to the quagmire in the East."
GER_heading_back_to_gerogia_desc:0 "Just like the war in the years past, our plan to regain control of Kaukasia from the troublesome natives is clear.\n\nWe will seize the initiative, break through the lands, and speedily take control of Kaukasia, moving around what is too strong and cutting resistance up into pockets.\n\nSurely, this should see us back in Georgia, and with law and order restored."
GER_cash_is_king_desc:0 "War's over. Peace's in.

With the industrialists miraculously reviving the economy of both the region and of the Reich, we do not need to listen to the inquiries of the Führer's cabinet. They're eventually going to stop that once they see that greed really is good for everyone."
GER_greed_works_desc:0 "On and on, they keep on crying crocodile tears about the natives in Kaukasia. When is all this going to end?\n\nCan't they see that the natives are getting everything they need? As long as the river of treasure flows from that region, the natives need not our pity! It's only getting on the nerves on everyone who is enjoying the good stuff that comes to us from Kaukasia.\n\nSurely, their worries are founded on nothing but rumors."

Surely, we have been on the side of those who prosper, yes?"
GER_workers_rights_are_king_desc:0 "For the love of what is good, we have finally concluded our war in Kaukasia. And it's time to make a choice.\n\nWe have chosen to follow the lead of the cabinet, the Führer challenging their wishes to set up a military government as he wished for the industrialists to manage the region. For now, there is a compromise.\n\nThe military will take control of everything but the areas which produce oil. That's for the industralists."
GER_the_union_makes_us_strong_desc:0 "Under this new military government wished for by the cabinet, the natives have been given more rights and freedoms than they had before the war.\n\nThis is something that they have not enjoyed for years. And now they have it all. Though the four great men of the cabinet boast that the emancipation of the natives shall be worth it in the long run, there are fears that Kaukasia may cost more than it really promises back."
GER_solidarity_forever_desc:0 "Okay, so that was a surprising turn.\n\nIt seems that the great gang of four assisting the Führer were right about their boasts. It appears that, thanks to the freedoms given to the natives, the region is becoming more productive. The people are happy, and are more willing to contribute to the Reich's future. The profits are trickling into the economy.\n\nPerhaps treating people with dignity and liberty works out after all."


GER_the_mad_barons_desc:0 "Josias has been overthrown, and the industrialists have seized control of Kaukasia. Once they have taken power, they declared themselves independent.\n\nThis will not do. Our Führer seeks to deal with them peacefully and fairly. This may seem to be the best way to handle them. Hopefully, they will be convinced to return to the Fatherland's embrace."
GER_power_through_the_krim_desc:0 "It is going to cost us a lot of money, but it will have to do.\n\nOur Führer has decided that it is important for us to ensure the loyalty of the industrialists by giving them whatever they need to improve their infrastructure. And on top of that, we will provide them with all the power they need to keep their country running.\n\nIn time, they should realize that this would mean reintegration with the Reich, and happily so."
GER_reestablish_black_sea_trade_desc:0 "Resuming trade in the East would benefit both the Fatherland and Kaukasia.\n\nOil from the Black Sea must continue to flow into the heart of the lands of the German people. Our Führer wishes to give the industrialists a more promising cut in the trade than the previous one. It should help us get them on our side once more."
GER_industrialists_from_the_ruhr_desc:0 "Our Fatherland has the expertise of great men and women in the Ruhr. From there, our Führer has decided that it would be of great help to Kaukasia and to our efforts in regaining the trust of our people there if we sent these people into the East to assist them.\n\nSurely enough, our own specialists would give them an easier time to work with their industries.\n\nIt's going to cost us though, as we must provide housing and pay during their stay in the East."
GER_junkers_from_the_north_desc:0 "Providing some very interesting amounts of money to the landed Junkers would help us gain their favor. Indeed, it is an expensive gesture to make, but it should do us more good than harm.\n\nEarning the favor of these people would help us in the long run, and our own offer to these people would certainly keep them close to us as we remain close to them."
GER_like_blood_from_an_artery_desc:0 "Like blood coursing through the arteries of a human body, our Fatherland comes alive once more as oil shipments from the East resume.\n\nThankfully, this is because our friends in Kaukasia have wisely chosen to return to the Fatherland's embrace.

GER_protect_the_oil_desc:0 "The war to overthrow a king who should not be a king has come to an end. And for good.\n\nIt's time for us to secure our interests. Kaukasia is teeming with oil. And oil is the vehicle of life for our Fatherland. It is important for us to keep it safe from the restless natives and so, despite the costs, we will station brave men to oversee the security of our workers who are eager to keep the Fatherland alive through the oil which flow through the pipelines. No matter how much."
GER_secure_our_interests_desc:0 "We must bring an end to the chaos of Kaukasia. At our own expense, it is vital to secure the land with the help of a new government under Friedrich Klausing.\n\nWith him in charge of the land, we surely would see repayment for our expense."
GER_rebuild_grozny_desc:0 "The city of Grozny has been a treasured center of the native population in Kaukasia.\n\nIt is important for us too. Therefore, it is our duty to rebuild it. The natives will surely be grateful, but we too will be grateful to see it rebuilt for the sake of the prosperity of the Reich. It will be a great deal of expense, but resurrecting this city should pay for it."
GER_assist_caucasia_desc:0 "We cannot leave this land alone to reorganize and to reform itself. Alone, it would wither like a flower in the desert.\n\nLet us make sure that our Fatherland gives it the support it needs to get back on its feet.

A peaceful partition of land between the settlers and the natives has been made. But at the price of what? We have given so much of our influence to the benefit of the settlers, but that didn't secure a right to some of the land they wanted. Instead, the natives have gotten more than any German would have wanted them to have. We do not appreciate these new borders. A deep blow to our prestige. The people must be grumbling about this, suspecting that we have settled for less than we deserve. We quietly agree that the land there originated with the natives. But such land is too important for us and for the settlers we sent out to the east. We must seek subtly to strengthen the position of the settlers."
GER_placate_the_natives_desc:0 "The idea of supporting the natives with an injection of cash along with some material assistance is interesting to us. Unfortunately for us, it is the only meaningful way to change the balance of powers of the states which replaced our former Reichskommissariat. After all, we can't do much against the natives, so why not help them instead? Let us hope that this will be our first step to solving the dilemma of our settlers and those Slavic dogs.

When their representatives come to the table to meet us, we must make an offer they cannot help but accept. For us to wipe away the debt they have, they must grant us Sankt Petersburg. They would have to think about it, as all men do when presented with offers. And like all men, they will have to enjoy what we give to them in exchange for what they have to give up."
GER_reaffirm_loyalty_desc:0 "One should wonder about the settlers, their affections for the Fatherland we share. Are they still willing to deal with us as we deal with them? Are they still loyal to the homeland of their fathers and mothers? We would have to ensure that they really are loyal. And that that would continue. Eager to pursue this, no matter the outcome, we must send a representative to see them, in order to see how things really are on the ground which our people now own. And to determine if we would need to... encourage them to stay loyal. Or else."
GER_helping_our_kin_desc:0 "Our people in the east have always needed our support since the days after the Second World War was won by our might in Europe and in Africa. And now that our civil war has come to an end, they still need our support. The war which we have fought against those who didn't want to pursue a better future for Germany has made us unable to continue that support for some time. Now, we have time. And we must make use of it. We should start preparing new deliveries of goods and resources which they will need to rebuild their homes and their communities. Just as we had done for our Fatherland, let us make sure that they can do the same."
GER_showing_our_commitment_desc:0 "The economy of our people living in the east is not strong enough to stand by itself. Therefore, to make sure that our people can live more easily in the future, we must provide not only the materials and the tools they need to rebuild their world but the money they need to buy the things they need and want, and to stimulate their economy by letting the cash flow. It should do some good at least. If it doesn't show results immediately, we must hope that it would in the future. But to make it to that kind of goal, cash would have to be injected into east regularly until such time that they would no longer need more of it. That way, it would be sustainable as it made its influence on the economy more significant. And by doing this, it would have to show that we remain committed to their future. And in return for that, they better show their gratitude in some way."
GER_back_to_the_pakt_desc:0 "We must celebrate the results of our efforts for the Fatherland. Our settlers remain loyal to the Reich. And as they remain loyal, we improved their economy, and made better their lives out in the east. In time, perhaps, they would enjoy the same blessings we in the Fatherland have. For now, however, it was time to invite them back into the Pakt. We have already dealt with the rest. And though such support did not come free, all they would have to do is obey some of our requests. And so long as they went along with them, they would be free to do any other thing that was permissible. We have chosen Alexis von Roenne, together with Otto Remer, to go to the settlers. And there, they would manage the new government. Things were becoming much better... for now."

GER_the_frontier_fire_desc:0 "Our hopes of a peaceful division of Moskowien into two states for both our settlers and the natives have been dashed. Now there is conflict raging on to the east of our Fatherland.\n\nWe have only two paths to take, but taking one or the other will have consequences that are sure to affect our standing in the world and the future of the two states. One option we have is to simply send some aid and a few advisers to shore up the settlers in their efforts at keeping their state intact. This is the more limited option, which should appeal to the world as well as to the more liberal elements of our Fatherland. But we can lose the war for the settlers because of our hands-off approach.\n\nAnother choice we could decide to take is to intervene on the behalf of the settlers. But doing so will draw the condemnations of the international community, hindering our hopes of a brighter future for Germany. However, it would appease our more traditional colleagues and their supporters.\n\nWhat matters now is what choice would matter in the long run for both our people in the East and our Reich."

We shall see."

There will no longer be any need to keep on delivering the tools of war into their arms, and they surely are grateful for all the kindness we have done them.\n\nAnd we'll have to make sure they stay that way. We'll have to send trusted people to the East to manage their state. For now.\n\nDeploying Alexis von Roenne as well as Otto Remer should do the trick. With the former in charge and the latter assisting him by handling the government of the settlers, we should not have to worry about another conflict out there."
GER_a_direct_intervention_desc:0 "Hopes for a more limited approach have to be dashed.\n\nDespite the risk of empowering the more traditional elements of our Fatherland through intervention, it is proper for us to seek a quicker end to the conflict in the East than it is for us to seek an end that is uncertain. Once again, our soldiers must march on against the Slavs and save our settlers.\n\nBut how we handle this intervention is entirely something else. And we must decide quickly and carefully.\n\nIf our Führer wishes to oversee this war, to thoroughly assess what methods are right or wrong, our intervention may save more innocent lives. But that will slow things down for us. And if our Führer seeks a quicker end to the intervention by trusting our soldiers to do what they think is best, then that would surely get the settlers out of trouble at the price of putting more civilians in harms way, both German and not."
GER_the_big_stick_desc:0 "Our Führer wants us to end this war more quickly.\n\nTherefore, the gloves have to come off. We will have to use all available force to put down our enemies once again. And though this will save our settlers, it will come at a greater price for all those in the East, especially the civilians.\n\nDisturbing estimates of casualties for both sides are being anticipated by our officers.

Never again shall we tolerate another conflict that threatens our territories and our people.\n\nWe shall send Alexis von Roenne to head the surviving state of our settlers, and with him, Otto Remer will manage the government set up there. With these two men in power out there in the East, our Fatherland should feel safe. Our trust in these men and in our people is in the hands of fate. And we will make sure fate goes our way."

Now in as the Civil war and the fallout fade, we deal with the challenge of Ostland currently under the control of one of Himmler's puppets, Jeckeln, the Butcher of Ostland. This little experiment of the SS needs to end immediately. It is clear they will never negotiate with us so let's make it easy for them.

Jeckeln had done massive damage to Ostland, the biggest of which was his mass purges of the former Reichskommissariat leadership.

If we truly want a stable Ostland free for Native aggravation than one of the first things that much go is the Einsatzgruppen.

The current Occupation Government will be given more autonomy with how to deal with the Natives. Natives will have a say in the occupation government, yes but it will mostly be overseen by highly skilled German officials to ensure only the smoothest possible transition into Native Autonomy.

However there are many many faults in this and what we found was not German living space but instead, intense Native resistance, mass murder, a strained economy, and a German populace which had little interest in the Eastern frontier. The question is how can one rule over their colonies when they actively slaughter the people they rule over.

It's worth entertaining him for now, especially since our position isn't wholly secure yet. Our illustrious Führer thinks that it's worth bringing those damn gangsters into yet another meeting, as if it will help soothe their outrage at losing everything they've stolen in the past thirty years.\n\nI anticipate that this meeting will be a complete waste of time, but it's not significant enough to bother fighting Speer on. The corporations already know our plans are in direct opposition to their interests, so it's not giving them any ground. No matter what Abs or his cronies have to say, I can at least be sure that Speer will throw his weight behind me. I'll see those criminals laid low, or my name's not Ludwig Erhard."

Abs brought up the legal challenges we'd face in attempting to 'reform' the corporations, just as I expected he would. I'm not sure the Führer had actually taken that into consideration; it's a good thing he wasn't facing the vultures alone. The world's truly run mad when men of the 20th century will declare a legal challenge against the abolition of slavery.\n\nIf they want to play at legal games, I'm happy to oblige them. It's been far too long since 'antitrust' was common parlance in German corporate world. With the Führer's full clout behind it, the Kartellgesetz will be the sword to cut the Gordian Knot of slavery and corporate dominance. No matter what it takes, I will see those economic monstrosities torn into a thousand pieces."

We have to keep in mind that breaking them is only half the battle; if the people aren't able to capitalize on their fall, then the effort will be wasted.\n\nThe Führer won't be happy, but it's time to take another bite out of our treasury. While the people are kept afloat by welfare and subsidies, we need a good, solid jolt to the heart of our economy to keep it pumping. 'A whole shitload of money', as Herr Schmidt phrased it. I can't vouch for the man's manners, but that's the gist of it. A massive dose of cash for the middle class will give us the short-term boost we need to stay fully functional while dealing with the corporations."
GER_The_New_German_Worker_desc:0 "At least Herr Speer has a head for selling our ideas. In truth, the 'New German Worker' isn't as new as the propaganda posters say he is; it's really just a return to the old normal, when the Mittelstand was the basis of the economy and ordinary working-class men could find good, honest employment.\n\nHowever, a victory remains a victory. The reality is that both the working and middle classes are back in earnest. No longer is German society so heavily stratified between haves and have-nots. The Reichswirtschaftsministerium must continue to support the renewal of a liberal social structure in both word and deed. The prosperity of the people is our first and best line of defense against the greed and treachery of the conglomerates."
GER_Cities_of_a_Thousand_Fires_desc:0 "Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Dortmund, Mülheim... Germany's once-renowned coal and steel centers were hit the hardest by the economic crash of the 50s. After all, why pay a free laborer to toil in the mines and foundries when a slave can do it for free? A slave will not balk at increased hours, or dare to protest when his fellows are crushed or burned alive in an industrial accident. I'll admit free workers can be unruly at times, but that's nothing compared to the inhumanity of industrial slavery.\n\nThankfully, things are returning to normal in the Ruhr and other such areas. Free workers are rapidly displacing slaves due to mandated employment quotas and the establishment of independent industrial Mittelstand companies. Factories abandoned by the conglomerates in favor of industrial slave camps are firing up once again. We'll continue our support of these liberated industries, and do unto the corporations as they did unto our economy in decades past."

Not for nothing did Tommy and the Yanks joke about 'German efficiency'. The corporations, however, usurped this label. With the advent of slavery during the war, 'Made in Germany' became a euphemism for cruelty, exploitation and inhumanity.\n\nFor our products to become world-renowned once more, we must reclaim our industrial legacy from the clutches of the cartels. Our blue-collar workers are already doing admirable work in this regard; the new recruits are taking to their chosen fields with gusto, aided by the expertise of the old guard. With each passing day, we come one step closer to shedding our shame and setting the gold standard for quality production."
GER_Social_Market_desc:0 "Germany has always experimented with social policies, but some were much more successful than others. I can't rightly advocate for a welfare state anymore, no matter how much my companions insist on doing so. I hate to disappoint them, especially with the proven benefits of a social state in mind, but I don't believe such a system is viable in the long term.\n\nWe should instead pursue the social market - a system where the workers are protected not by an overbearing welfare state, but by moderate government regulations, social security via ease of access to work, and the humanely-run nature of the economy. When operating correctly - which it shall be, under our oversight - this will keep both workers and employers happy, ensuring social harmony and minimizing class conflict."
GER_Social_State_desc:0 "I was never enamored of the welfare state established by Bismarck. It certainly helped keep socialism at bay, but the sheer amount of money and red tape involved made it hell to keep running. However, try as I might, I can't convince the others that their 'social state' (as they're calling it now) is a sub-optimal route for us to take. I must admit that the whole idea encompasses more than just economics - vital as those are - so I'm willing to give some ground here. If Speer is willing to support it, then I won't fight them on it. They want to deal with the ramifications in twenty or thirty years, that's fine by me.\n\nI'll direct the Reichswirtschaftsministerium to begin funding the social state programs drawn up by Kiesinger. No doubt many of them will need revising by a learned economist. I just hope that Speer knows what he's doing by approving this."
GER_Reichs_Needs_desc:0 "Damnation, but Speer might be right again. The Zollverein is a German creation and will almost certainly remain so regardless of how much I try to change that fact. I suppose there's no use in continuing to deny the reality of the situation. Now isn't the time for high-minded ideals, no matter what Schmidt says.\n\nThe Zollverein shall, for the foreseeable future, remain a customs union inherently German in nature. In addition to keeping it centralized under German control, we shall encourage the German way of doing things in our economic partners. If it works for us, it should work for them as well.

Still, I will persevere - this responsibility is too great to neglect, and the potential for a brighter pan-European future lives on beneath all the muck of slavery and bloodshed.\n\nEastern Europe makes up a huge portion of our territory and wider hegemony, but has been systematically misused ever since it was conquered. Ukraine has so much more to offer than just wheat! And the Caucasus - what a sorry mess! All that oil, dredged up by natives in utterly inhumane conditions while the industrial barons grow fat on the profits that should be enriching the ones doing the work!

Any intellectual who isn't neck-deep in 'National Socialist science' knows for a fact that all this talk of non-German inferiority is utter tripe - even if they won't dare say so in public. Bohemia and Poznan were booming industrial hubs long before the Nazis came along and started driving the locals out.

GER_Treating_Wounds_desc:0 "Never has there been so heinous an act of imperialism as Generalplan Ost. Under this insane scheme devised by Himmler's circle of evil, the economy of Eastern Europe was devastated in short order. Heavy industry was appropriated, economic centers razed, the population butchered and a disastrous policy of regressive agrarianism imposed upon the survivors. Even were the Reich to vanish tomorrow, it could take centuries for the region to return to even pre-war levels of prosperity by itself.\n\nIt's too late to help the dead, but it's not too late for the living. While Germany's crimes can never be erased, the wounds inflicted can be healed - at least to a degree. It's hard to say where our resources are best allocated to undo the damage, but I've settled on Warsaw and Kiev. As the foremost hubs of Poland and Ukraine respectively, it just makes sense to focus on rebuilding them first. Germany has plenty of money and equipment to spare, and we have a responsibility to help the conquered. Scars will remain, but even they will heal in time."

Germany has, for the time being, reached its industrial capacity with current levels of technology and development possibilities. Only the East, with its vast tracts of land, bountiful resources and remnants of Soviet industrialization, offers further expansion of physical economic interests.\n\nNo longer can the East be demonized as a cesspit of subhumans, fit only for the harvesting of slaves. As part of our propaganda efforts, we must shift gears to depict the East as the rising star of the Einheitspakt. Without the state's endorsement, individuals and Mittelstand corporations are unlikely to bother investing in the future of the East. German backing for eastern industry and business is essential for fostering home-grown economies in the region."
GER_Guiding_Hand_desc:0 "No matter how much we invest, Eastern Europeans will never trust us if we insist on holding their hand throughout the process of economic regeneration. True equality is a long way off, but we must work to present ourselves as a partner rather than a master. Germany will always be Europe's largest economy but having the same amount of clout in legal terms will help foster trust with our new friends.\n\nRather than maintaining German control over resources and heavy industry in the East, we should place these in the hands of reliable locals wherever possible. Allowing for a strong degree of autonomy will give them the experience needed to become self-reliant, and will demonstrate our good intentions. No amount of whitewashing our economic dominance will give us that."
GER_Firm_Chain_desc:0 "I don't like it, but Speer might have a point for once. The East is in shambles, with its middle class long gone and its economy reduced to agrarianism. Germany has no choice but to accept its role as an overlord for now and maintain close control over economic development. It feels so wrong - but the alternative could devolve into socio-economic chaos if handled incorrectly.\n\nThe Reich Government and approved representatives shall continue to hold direct control of most eastern resources and heavy industry for the time being. Eastern workers - and the middle class, once it reappears - will operate under German tutelage, so that we can impart our knowledge and expertise to them. Their independence will thus be delayed, but will also potentially be a lot more stable. Not my preferred option, but perhaps it's for the best."

There are many burdens that come with economic freedom, and only we are in a position to bear them at this time.

Presiding over it from the shadows was Hermann Josef Abs, a true wolf in sheep's clothing if ever there was one. To the Party, he is an untouchable god; to the corporate world, a model executive; to us, the greatest threat we face after Field Marshal Schörner.\n\nWe must break Abs' power, politically and financially. Too long have his crimes gone unaccounted for, and his sway over Germany unchallenged. As the world's most powerful banker, he has virtually unlimited resources at his disposal, so we cannot hope to destroy him by purely financial means. We must instead employ more... direct means.

Thankfully, the Führer is of a mind with myself, and Gehlen has a vested interest in seeing his backroom rivals destroyed.\n\nIt will be child's play to bring down the corporations once the RND is unleashed. It is an open secret that Abs and his cronies have enormous amounts of illicit funds, offshore accounts and investments in enterprises of dubious legality. Abs always thought himself above the Gestapo, and was correct to do so - but he hasn't yet reckoned with Gehlen and young Wessel, the most talented and ruthless operatives we are blessed with.

If they want war, they'll damn well get it!\n\nAnd what better way to make war upon a corporation than to deprive it of a workforce? IG Farben is wholly dependent on its millions of slaves to continue turning a profit. The executives have been digging their heels ever since the beginning of the Rückführungsprogramm, doing all they can to forestall the inevitable release of their victims, but their schemes and litigation are no match for the might of our apparatus of state.

The demise of IG Farben and its vile master will be ours - to the Reich, to the other corporations, and to the world. They made slavery what it is today, and driving a knife into the heart of their corrupt enterprise will prove once and for all that there will be no mercy offered to the wicked in our new order."

Let this be a testament to our resolve and pursuit of a more righteous world.\n\nIt's time to strike the killing blow. Abs and his Council of Rats are scrambling to consolidate what little they have left and flee the Reich - this cannot be allowed to happen. Herr Speer is a dictator with unquestioned authority, and it's past time he exercised it. Thankfully, he is entirely on board with the idea of bringing down the hammer in as dramatic a fashion as possible.

They are fools - von Siemens harbors nothing in his mind save for greed and a lust for yet more wealth.\n\nThey make use of slaves, though not nearly to the same extent as their peers. I suppose that's a point in their favor, though not reason enough to trust them. Still, they have proven the least opposed to our economic reforms and intention to abolish slavery - solely, of course, because they have the least to lose. Still, we shouldn't refuse their overtures if they can be useful to us. We'll hear von Siemens out, and turn his sense of self-preservation to our purposes. He knows that there'll be hell to pay if he betrays us. Perhaps that alone will keep the cowardly snake in line while we dismantle his cartel."
GER_Uneasy_Ally_desc:0 "Von Siemens is scum, but he sees the writing on the wall and knows that his cartel's days are numbered. He knows that our threats are neither empty nor idle.

He doesn't deserve our mercy, but if that's the price for his cooperation, then so be it.\n\nIn return for amnesty, von Siemens will not oppose the reorganization of his eponymous corporation. He has promised to sit down, shut up and hand over his slaves, illegal assets and whatever else we demand - all in exchange for his wealth, his position and his life. It sickens me to spare this snake, but the easier this whole process is, the better. Anyone with common sense would do the same."
GER_International_Competitor_desc:0 "Despite its nature as a cartel, there remains much one can begrudgingly admire about Siemens. Their innovations in the fields of home electronics, computing and machinery are comparable to those of the Americans and Japanese. Only von Siemens' corruption and their reliance on slavery for manufacturing has kept them from becoming a global leader to outshine the best of Guangdong's corporations.\n\nWe shall exploit Siemens' more useful tendencies, even as we continue to diminish their power. God willing, we can turn this wretched hive of villainy into something useful that we can be proud of. Only once they've been cut down to a more acceptable size, of course."
GER_Zukunftsmusik_desc:0 "Sparing Siemens, while a moral compromise, is the sensible thing to do. They will be dismantled, dismembered, broken on the altar of freedom - but not destroyed. They will endure, chained and bound, their leash gripped firmly in the hand of the state. Not until von Siemens and the other executives are long gone shall they be considered trustworthy.\n\nIn the meantime, they shall continue their work under our auspices and on our terms. No longer will slaves toil away on assembly lines, putting together Siemens-branded electronics while the company's directors grow fat on the profits. Their work will be done by free, paid employees and the just taxes paid. This mercy, extended only because we so wish it, is far more than Siemens deserves, and they had best remember that fact."
GER_Conglomerate_of_Steel_desc:0 "Reichswerke - formerly Reichswerke Hermann Göring - is not actually a private company, but may as well be one anyway, given the enormous amount of influence and autonomy they possess. Having such a large conglomerate under state control would normally stifle its profits, but Reichswerke possesses a monopoly on steel, coal, and other heavy industries. Combine that with the fact that they are remarkably good at avoiding their taxes, and you have a recipe for a truly abominable cartel.\n\nReichswerke owns massive numbers of slaves; not quite as many as IG Farben, but still numbering in the millions. These are some of the most pitiful, poorly-treated people in the entire system, forced to work in dangerous mines, foundries and factories for as long as their overseers demand. Reichswerke slaves are chewed up and spat out as corpses by the deadly meat grinder of industry, leaving thousands dead every year as the executives and their friends in the NSDAP and bureaucracy grow ever richer. We must slay this beast of iron and blood, no matter the cost."
GER_Money_to_Gain_desc:0 "With their close ties to the state bureaucracy, Reichswerke will already have caught wind of our plans for them. This is going to make dealing with them a lot more difficult than I'd hoped, since they're no doubt hurrying to burn documents, cover their tracks and relocate their assets out of our reach.\n\nWe have to go in hard and fast. If we want Geilenburg's empire dismantled and scattered to the winds before he can salvage his wealth, we should take advantage of the control we already have over Reichswerke. With the clout of a Führer Directive, the dissolution of the cartel into its constituent corporations can begin immediately."
GER_Mass_Privatisation_desc:0 "Our slash-and-burn approach is working like a charm, just as I predicted. Reichswerke never saw us coming. Geilenberg has reportedly been thrown into a spin by our rapid and uncompromising attack, offering no resistance to the brutal dismemberment of his enterprise.\n\nKrupp, Rheinmetall, and dozens more corporations are once again free and in the hands of responsible businessmen who can be trusted not to seek a monopoly or abuse the responsibility granted to them. Unfortunately, the redistribution of assets means that some of the corporations spat out by Reichswerke are still in possession of slaves. I'm more than a little concerned, but hopefully any further abuses can be prevented with careful monitoring of the situation and the continuation of the Rückführungsprogramm. I just hope the new bosses have more moral fiber than Geilenberg does."
GER_Lives_to_Save_desc:0 "I'm all for going full steam ahead with privatization of Reichswerke, but there's a catch - as always. If the de-cartelization of the corporation is too fast and disorganized, the millions of slaves it owns could quite easily end up in the hands of our enemies. Once in private hands, ensuring their freedom will become more difficult - not impossible, but more of a challenge than it should be.\n\nWe have a responsibility to the oppressed. Their lives are worth more than anything we could hope to gain from the immediate destruction of Reichswerke. Though it will give Geilenberg enough time to save some of his fortune, that's a small price to pay compared to saving thousands more lives. He'll still get his day in court - that much, I swear. For now, we should privatize Reichswerke only to a limited degree and at a measured pace, so that we can ensure no slaves fall through the cracks to be denied their freedom."
GER_Partial_Privatisation_desc:0 "The privatization of Reichswerke isn't turning out as profitable as it might have been, but continues at a decent clip. Entrepreneurs looking to snap up pieces of the cartel were naturally disappointed by our decision to retain majority state ownership, but it was a necessary move to keep the slaves safe from prolonged bondage.\n\nOnce enough of Reichswerke's assets have been sold off, the company will be put under new management and the old executives prosecuted for their crimes. Never again will innocent people be sacrificed in the pursuit of wealth amid the smoke and fire of the Rhine and Ruhr."
GER_Past_is_Past_desc:0 "With their assets seized or privatized and the corporation itself brought to heel, Reichswerke has been dealt a blow from which it will never recover. We've put paid to Geilenberg's greed and ambition, liberating his wealth for the nation and ending the brutal practice of industrial slavery in his mines and factories.\n\nFrom here on out, it's only a matter of time until Reichswerke is little more than a footnote in history - a department of the Reich Government managing our nationalized industries. Soon, the name will be all that remains, and even that will change in time. Geilenberg's bloody empire will die with him, as it should have long ago."
GER_Core_of_Arms_desc:0 "Daimler-Benz hides behind a veneer of respectability, maintaining a relatively small industrial presence compared to its competitors. They have never been competitive internationally - the largest overseas presence they have is in the motor pools of despots and dictators. Within the Reich, they are a wolf in sheep's clothing, keeping their operations quiet and their number of slaves relatively low.\n\nThe reality is, however, that they represent something far worse than a humble, medium-sized conglomerate. Their CEO, Friedrich Flick, has fingers in every pie. While Daimler-Benz tries to remain as inoffensive as possible, Flick wastes no opportunity to further enrich himself and solidify the slave system. Through intermediaries and stocks, he owns millions of slaves in some of the most brutal labor camps and factories the Reich has to offer. He is responsible for untold suffering - and by extension, so is his cartel. Worst of all, he was a major donor to the SS, funding their crimes for his own benefit. He is a criminal and a traitor both, and will be dealt with as such."
GER_Little_Gain_desc:0 "While Daimler-Benz as a whole might deserve to be destroyed, there's little sense in doing so. Most of the cartel's worst excesses are done via intermediaries, leaving their good image intact. We can exploit this - decapitate the cartel, break it up, and put someone with a bit of humanity in charge, but let the core company remain. They could be a major employer, and with a little help they could establish a new standard of quality for cars, giving us another highly-profitable export.\n\nHowever, they will be punished. Severely. The entire board of directors is complicit in Flick's crimes and will be prosecuted the same as their boss. Middle management is also rife with corruption and Party-aligned men, so we'll need to purge them too, albeit a little less violently. Finally, every single subsidiary of the corporation will be torn away and sold off, further increasing the number of Mittelstand companies and permanently constraining Daimler-Benz's power."
GER_Much_to_Give_desc:0 "If Daimler-Benz has a redeeming quality, it's their eye for talent. The corporation employs many of the Reich's best engineers to design their vehicles. They also hold many patents for advanced technology, which will be very useful when it comes to competing with our economic rivals.\n\nThe R&D section of the cartel will be retained, minus the few criminals to be found therein. That should reduce it to a state more suitable to our purposes. We can then put them to work developing both civilian and military technologies for the benefit of the nation, its people, and our economy, rather than for the purpose of fattening Flick's purse."
GER_Buyout_desc:0 "With their fat trimmed and unsavory executives lined up for prosecution, Daimler-Benz is vulnerable. Now is the time to go in hard and fast. We'll aggressively buy up every single asset they have left, forcibly if we must. In a week, the once-mighty cartel will be just another state-owned industrial corporation operative at our beck and call.\n\nWith that done, we can also move onto the business of dealing with that corrupt, evil snake, Flick. He ranks alongside Abs in terms of the lives he's destroyed in the name of profit, and has coiled himself around a fortune that belongs to someone more deserving. Perhaps if we're lucky, someone else might get to him first and give him what he deserves. Perhaps not. All in due time, you rat bastard..."

Once again, the entrepreneur can innovate or start up a business without being coerced into selling out. The working man can earn decent wages in a healthy work environment. And, most importantly of all, the slaves will suffer and die no longer at the whims of cruel overseers and soulless men in suits.\n\nThe only issue that remains is that of corporate assets acquired by the state. Our continued ownership will only lower their profitability and potential; we should sell them off to the Mittelstand on the cheap and be rid of them as soon as possible so that they don't continue sponging up our money. Hopefully, this initiative - let's call it 'Volksaktien', that's nice and patriotic - will have the Mittelstand putting them to better use than their old owners."

Infrastructure, welfare, education, public works, the Wehrmacht - we have enough to fund whatever we so please! The last time we received such an influx of capital was during the days of the war economy, when the Heer looted and pillaged like a pack of barbarians, and we all know where that led us.\n\nWith that in mind, I believe we have the perfect thing to invest in: the Zollverein. Our member states are still painfully under-industrialized, impoverished and backwards. As the leader of this customs union and the foremost economy of Europe, it is our responsibility to offer direct economic aid. There's a certain justice in using the ill-gotten gains of slavery to heal the nations from whence those unfortunate souls were stolen. Perhaps, in time, this will soothe the wounds of war. Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy the means."
GER_for_us_desc:0 "Germany now finds itself firmly at the top of the European economic sphere, thanks to the Zollverein and our newly-expanded liquid reserves. The debates within the Reichstag and Speer's cabinet on what to do with them grow louder by the day, but I think I have a practical answer in mind.\n\nIt is only logical - though, admittedly, not fair at all - to invest this German wealth back into Germany itself. For all our progress, we are still a nation rebuilding from ruin and years of depression. As Europe's largest economy, what benefits us will directly benefit our economic partners. Not as readily appreciable as just giving them the money, but the logic is sound. Handouts can only do so much, and the Zollverein member states must come to stand on their own two feet someday."
GER_Made_in_Germany_desc:0 "I always knew we'd succeed. Only a cynic or one who does not understand economics would ever have objected to the measures undertaken by my ministry.

Germany rises, a great Lazarus shaking off the ashes of the pyre it was consigned to by its own foolish leaders. The shackles of slavery lie shattered - not by the senseless violence of revolution, but by the precisely-aimed hammer of economics, backed by Christian virtue and that old German spirit! 'Made in Germany' is no longer a mark of shame, but one of quality! Quality that comes from free labor, fairly paid for! Quality that will become the new standard for Europe! Such are the fruits of freedom, of sound economic policy, and of European friendship. May it be so forever more."

Though all such direct threats to our authority have been dealt with, we must decide the future of our eastern conquests; they cannot continue as they are forever, but nor can we simply abandon them...\n\nThe Gang of Four, as well as the majority of reformists in the Reichstag, believe that the Führer must accept that we cannot continue direct rule from Germania. In lieu of continued military occupation or colonial rule, they would see the Einheitspakt reformed into a hegemonic union of the Reich and a collection of satellite states or protectorates. It would make non-Germans far more amenable to working with us and prove our good intentions, but at the cost of considerable loss of direct control.\n\nConservative elements of the NSDAP, having been brought in line with the Führer's way of thinking, propose the continuation of direct German rule over our conquests, with politically acceptable natives serving an auxiliary role in our administration.

This is the issue that anti-slavery radicals always fail to answer adequately. The Gang of Four, however, worked with the Führer on this for years, and hit upon an ingenious solution.\n\nDubbed the 'Rückführungsprogramm', this solution is set up in two stages. The first is the abolition of slavery. This will see all slaves placed under the direct administration of the Reich government and granted special status. They will be confined to special districts and camps - though in far more humane conditions than the old Konzentrationslager. The second stage, which will be far more difficult, is to repatriate every single former slave to their nation of origin.

Meanwhile, new ones will be drafted by Erhard working in conjunction with representatives from the business community. The Führer has voiced his concerns about decentralizing military production, but Erhard has dismissed them, assuring him that there is no longer a need for ultra-centralized mass production of armaments.

In practice, their role is to mete out punishment - usually of the capital kind - to anyone who questions orders or retreats without their permission.\n\nThese leeches are a plague that we cannot tolerate any longer. Military discipline is important, but morale and good conduct cannot be maintained through murder! Capital punishment should be reserved for war criminals and traitors, not men whose courage failed them, or who were too free of spirit.

Nazism went further than most ideologies, however. It normalized brutality, turned patriotism to blind obedience and caused righteous anger to degenerate into ideological hatred. This is actively harmful to the wellbeing of soldiers, especially once they return to civilian life and find a world completely alien to them.\n\nSome level of politicization is inevitable, but it shouldn't be like this. When he is enlisted, a man's political thought should be about how best he can serve his country. Bringing ideology into the mix causes him to filter everything through the lens of what is most politically acceptable, rather than what he should do.

Gendarmes who have records of criminality will be prosecuted if possible, while those who are otherwise unfit for service will be given early retirements.

This way, the Wehrmacht can avoid any complications borne of professional pride and senseless secrecy.

GER_an_end_to_autarky_desc:0 "Our great Führer, Adolf Hitler, once set our Fatherland on a course to pursue the fulfillment of self-sufficiency. And now that this course has led us nowhere, it is time for us to change it.\n\nOur new Führer, Speer, has decided that it is time to try opening trade with the rest of world, especially the Americans. If there is one way out of the never-ending race to achieve wealth for our people, this is it. And we must try our best to keep on it."
GER_a_meeting_in_the_dark_desc:0 "The Führer is interested in setting a meeting, with the proper discretion, of course, with the American ambassador. Why he seeks this is not entirely known to us, but if we believe in him, it is surely to find a way to lift the embargo their country established against the Fatherland.\n\nLet's make sure it goes well. And carefully."
GER_the_truth_will_set_us_free_desc:0 "Two choices confront us now. The first choice is to be honest about our Fatherland. Our Führer may want to not hold back on how we really are faring, and so, he may tell the Americans that he would come to the table with no secrets, seeking the best out of the terms they may offer.\n\nThe other one is to keep our secrets close to us. We lie to the Americans and hope that they will believe it. We only have to take one choice, and honesty might be the best policy."
GER_conference_of_global_security_and_cooperation_desc:0 "Our great German Fatherland is seeking to bring a beautiful proposal to the table with the Americans.\n\nThat proposal is the opportunity to have a conference with them, to invite them and talk to them about issues between us. But this conference too should serve us a purpose.\n\nThe end of the embargo is what we seek. Let us hope we receive what we seek indeed."
GER_the_reykjavik_accords_desc:0 "Our Reich shall come to Reykjavik to meet with the Americans. And there, we shall do our best to solve our issues with them together. And hopefully, once and for all.\n\nDuring that meeting, we are going to have to make compromises. There is a chance the Americans will ask a great deal out of us. Let us hope doing so will get them on our side. And nothing too drastic."
GER_resetting_the_dooomsday_clock_desc:0 "We have made a very important decision. And this should not cost us more.\n\nWe shall see to it that our nuclear arsenal is reduced, and that our capabilities shall be regulated. It is a serious compromise, indeed, but it would be one great step towards getting the Americans to become more friendly with us."
GER_helping_the_untermensch_desc:0 "Another agreement has been made. And that concerns our former property.\n\nWhat the Americans called slaves we shall treat more kindly. And hopefully that should show to them that we are more than willing to do what is right.\n\nAfter all, that is something we wished to do too. Let's just hope they don't rub that in our faces too much."
GER_america_first_desc:0 "It's a big sacrifice for anyone to let go of the first of everything they own or earn. And for our Reich, it is going to be our own sacrifice to let the Americans have a taste of the resources we now possess.\n\nSurely, while this means great reward for us, this too should mean that our new American friends will benefit."
GER_The_Fuhrer_Has_Spoken_desc:0 "Our Führer has come out to the people and spoke to them about the deal. It has been done. Our great Fatherland has made a momentous agreement with the Americans. And finally, we have seen our Führer do his best.\n\nNo matter how much one may oppose this now or support it, our Reich shall have to respect this. And live with it, it must."
GER_the_times_they_are_a_changing_desc:0 "The new treaty is taking effect. And as it did, change has come to our Fatherland. It is happening thanks to it, and for better or worse, our people experience it as they should experience it.\n\nBut thanks to this, we have struck another opportunity. The Americans have invited Schmidt to come to their cities. Let us accept this gesture of goodwill."
GER_the_city_that_never_sleeps_desc:0 "The Americans have invited Schmidt to pay a visit to the Big Apple. And there he shall go for our Fatherland, to see the sights of their most populous city! This is a great opportunity for our country's foreign minister to see what our American counterparts have to show for themselves. Let us not waste this invitation.\n\nGiving Schmidt the chance to visit that city shall be one step closer to becoming closer to our counterparts in the West. And letting him see New York for himself would surely be great for his pleasure."
GER_the_city_of_angels_desc:0 "The Americans have called Schmidt to the West Coast, bringing him to Los Angeles. He could see their museums, their piers, and their unique natural features. Although he may miss seeing Lady Liberty, Wall Street, and Central Park, it would be pleasing for him to see what lies to the Pacific.\n\nAlthough our former Japanese allies may have won some concessions from them, that is not our business. Let Schmidt enjoy the sights of this great city. Perhaps letting him lay his eyes on their beaches and letting him explore Hollywood could give him insights into the culture of our counterparts."
GER_wiping_our_hands_clean_desc:0 "Our Fatherland shall no longer have to deal with the horrific stains of wars, both within and without, and neither shall it deal with the memories of those who have once promised us the future but gave us ashes. And to show to the Americans that we have changed, we have washed ourselves clean.\n\nThey are beginning to appreciate us for who we are now and what we have become. We are born again. Our Fatherland shall be born again."
GER_a_dine_in_at_the_white_house_desc:0 "Our foreign minister has done well. And he has enjoyed his dinner at the White House. Things are looking good for both the Americans and our people.\n\nOur great Fatherland made sure this won't go to waste. Schmidt shall have signed the papers with the President, signing away together the embargo which has wedged itself between our two great countries."
GER_lying_congressional_style_desc:0 "We face a fork in the road. Two simple choices, tell the Americans the truth about our country. Or we can lie to them.\n\nIf we lie, we must make it realistic. We must present ourselves strongly. And while speaking the truth would be great, it might benefit them more than us.\n\nAfter all, it's natural to lie, but it's hard to tell the truth. And while it would set us free, would that give us money?"
GER_an_invitation_to_hamburg_desc:0 "Sending an invitation to our American counterparts is good. But inviting them to Hamburg is better than merely bringing them into the heart of our Fatherland.\n\nShowing them one of our largest cities would certainly impress them. And this would allow us to show some of the best of our country. And there, we would be free to discuss issues with their delegation. Let us hope that extending our hand to the West would be rewarded with their appreciation of German hospitality."
GER_relocate_the_protestors_desc:0 "We know not what the protestors demand, nor do we particularly care. All we know is that with the Americans' arriving in Germany, we cannot have these demonstrators crowding our streets, throwing bricks and generally making a mess of things.\n\nThankfully, a Chancellery meeting today has proved fruitful. Speer and Gehlen have sent armoured trucks and men with guns into Hamburg, quickly and effectively taking care of the rioters and moving them elsewhere. At least for now, our faces are saved."
GER_accelerate_the_rebuilding_desc:0 "It is going to cost us money. But money is something that we can replace; time is something we cannot.\n\nIt is important for us to rebuild Hamburg as quickly as we can, no matter what. And no matter how much this may ask of us, it is better to do this than to disturb the Americans with reminders of our civil war.\n\nAccelerating the efforts of our Fatherland to restore the beauty of this great city shall be a priority."
GER_fill_the_mass_graves_desc:0 "We have buried many bodies here. But it isn't enough. Unfortunately for us, there are still some that remain.\n\nIt's going to take too long for us to get the ones that are still around in Hamburg taken care of. We have to get them out of sight. Quickly, or the Americans will see our shame, our human loss.\n\nAs long as we can find holes for these corpses and bury them deep, our guests will never have to complain nor worry about anything."
GER_shiny_happy_people_desc:0 "The war for the fate of our Fatherland has not been good to our people. And as a consequence, they cannot help but feel miserable and exhausted about things. We cannot allow this to be.\n\nAlthough Hamburg is one of many cities which has suffered from the pains of the Bürgerkrieg, the Americans must not see how far our people have gone down with their attitudes. Let us make sure that we show our guests that we are capable of putting on our best smiles."
GER_a_night_in_wonderful_hamburg_desc:0 "The American delegates have come to Hamburg. And now, our great Fatherland has the opportunity to show to our former enemies, who are now here to sit down with us and talk peace and security, that our Reich is as wonderful as we wanted it to be.\n\nAlthough we had to hide some of the things we could not bear to leave lying around, at least we can warmly get our guests settled in for the coming talks. And for now, it is time for joy.\n\nLet's make sure they have a beautiful night."
GER_just_like_in_washington_desc:0 "We have done so much. We have to put away what should never be seen. And we have hoped that they would never realize what has changed.\n\nIt worked. And now we have them on our side. It's time for us to get ready for the best part of this show. Preparations for the journey over the Atlantic must be undertaken."
GER_the_unity_fair_desc:0 "It would be all too easy to bring the Americans to our side. And we can't just beg them to end the embargo. That would certainly be terrible manners on our part.\n\nNo. Instead, let us make a spectacle. Yes, let us appeal to their people, not just to their government. And we have just the plan.\n\nA fair, for all the world to come and see, to experience and to remember, at Boston, would most certainly be our best shot at making the American people more agreeable to sitting down with us."
GER_once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood_desc:0 "Working with the Americans doesn't always mean maintaining a mentality centered around work alone. No, let us make sure that our counterparts can realize that we too appreciate some time off.\n\nAnd by this, we do mean that we appreciate cinema. And if we can get our American counterparts to enjoy some films with us, perhaps that will make things easier for them to digest during our talks.\n\nA film festival right in Hollywood should do the trick. If Norma could ask for a close-up, so can our Margit, Elke, and Marianne."
GER_fear_and_loathing_in_reno_desc:0 "Our American counterparts love their planes. We too love our planes.\n\nParticipating in one of their greatest air shows at Reno would be a fabulous opportunity for our Fatherland to display the best of what our brightest engineers and technicians have created. And it certainly would wow the Americans with our skill at the machine, our mastery of the engine, and our innovative spirit.\n\nYes, we shall present to them our finest jets. Behold! The screaming 88s!"
GER_a_night_to_remember_desc:0 "All those visits, all those wonders, and all those pleasures. All these things have come to an end. And now, it is time to make an impressive conclusion.\n\nFor look! Schmidt has received an invitation to dine at the White House with the American President! Isn't that something?\n\nThis is our country's chance at getting the Americans to sign away this terrible embargo. And for the good, not only of our country, but for them and the rest of the world. Truly, as they say, this shall be a night to remember."
GER_opening_the_doors_desc:0 "It is time for our Fatherland to persuade the Americans to lift their embargo. And it is also time for us to open the doors of Europe to the West, and for the West to do the same for Europe. We can no longer exist with a barrier between us.\n\nIt is best for us all to remove the wedge between us."
GER_the_sins_of_the_father_desc:0 "Before we can even sit at the same table with our partners from America, we have to show that we can go forward without Hitler's influence.\n\nWe are a new Germany, and to the Republican-Democratic Coalition, we must help them see who we are now instead of who we were before.\n\nWhat we are now must not be tainted by who we were before."
GER_are_not_the_sins_of_the_son_desc:0 "Our Führer, Albert Speer, has never done anything wrong. He never involved himself with the ugliness which Hitler himself got into.\n\nUnlike him, our new Führer desires to make things right. This is what we believe, and that is what the world should too.\n\nThis is his way, and therefore our way, of setting ourselves apart from the legacy of our fathers."
GER_distance_ourselves_from_hitler_desc:0 "The name Adolf Hitler will forever echo through the grand halls of history, inspiring both hope and fear into those who hear it. The threads of fate weaved together the tapestry of this man's life, from the darkness of Vienna's filthy slums to the radiance of the Reichstag. His ascension to Führer of the Greater German Reich and saviour of the Aryan people is a monumental fragment of history, and to belittle his significance would be to deny reality itself.\n\nNonetheless, the Führer was but a man, and so too would it be foolish to deny his faults. Many within the Party refuse to acknowledge the flaws of their hero, but these attitudes must be altered if we are to progress as a nation. The question remains as such: should we completely destroy Hitler's cult of personality, or must the subject be tackled with a lighter touch?"
GER_death_to_the_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "The time has come to embrace total dehitlerization for the good of the German Reich. No longer shall the Party worship Hitler as a figurehead of National Socialism and messianic saviour of the Aryan race. It is our duty to acknowledge that Hitler was a mere man driven by power and prone to committing unspeakable actions, even against his own people whom he claimed so often to love. This drastic change in National Socialist thought will doubtless spark fury among the conservative wing of the NSDAP, but it is a risk we are willing to take."
GER_hitler_acted_alone_desc:0 "Speer and his administration understand that Hitler was a flawed leader who ruled with poor judgement and enacted many amoral policies. Unfortunately for the Reich, our most stubborn Party comrades refuse to understand this, preferring to view the late Führer through rose-tinted lenses. While we cannot force the conservatives to embrace our viewpoint, it is within our power to inform the world. The truth is whatever we declare, and our truth is that Hitler acted alone in ordering atrocities. The world must believe that no one in the administration had any knowledge of Hitler's decision making, for the sake of Germany's future."
GER_a_better_light_to_stand_in_desc:0 "The German Reich stands on the precipice, bracing itself to take the leap of faith into a bright new era. We must demonstrate to the world that the current administration represents the sensible reformation of National Socialism, and that Hitler's Germany is locked away in the annals of history, never to return. By portraying Speer's administration as not only separate but morally superior to Hitler's, we may be able to form greater connections with the nations around us."
GER_a_new_reich_desc:0 "The Reich has taken a leap of faith from the shadowy darkness of the past into the light of a new day. Speer and his administration have successfully distanced themselves from the atrocities of Adolf Hitler, a man loathed by many nations across the world at large. With our open position on the late Führer clear to all, we have shown the world a new Germany with new values. The boiling anger within the Party is a threat to us all, but it may simmer down over time; the positive diplomatic consequences of our actions, however, shall last for decades to come."
GER_our_new_spitting_image_desc:0 "Our efforts have paid off. As we desperately hoped, our desire to improve diplomatic relations with the wider world may soon be fulfilled. Many heads of state have praised Speer's position on Hitler to varying degrees of openness, and the foreign press we have intensively studied are producing mostly positive coverage. Even the great beast to our west, the United States of America, has responded well to Speer's administration distancing itself from Hitler, and the Republican-Democratic Coalition is reportedly eying our sudden surge in popularity with envy! We have presented a new face to the world, and the world likes what it sees."
GER_we_are_not_complicate_desc:0 "Germany cannot deny that many of its sons and daughters turned against Hitler. And Germany cannot deny that among them, there were some who desired his downfall and of those who believed in him.\n\nHowever, Germany must realize that one group above all has done the most to destroy everything.\n\nIt must realize that this group is the SS."
GER_in_the_mistakes_of_the_past_desc:0 "Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and the face of his infamous state of Burgundy, an artificial entity shaped out of the corpse of France and Belgium, is and was responsible for the stains which ruined Hitler's reputation.\n\nBut most of all, they are the ones who corrupted his party and his country. All the mistakes of the past are because of Himmler and his SS."
GER_fingers_pointed_at_himmler_desc:0 "Himmler is a criminal, and a trickster who wishes to take over the Reich for himself. His men too are minions we cannot forgive. We must set ourselves apart from them, and for the good of the Fatherland, we must make a decision!\n\nWe can either refuse recognition for him as part of our government, or we can start confronting him. One way or the other, we cannot let him continue to be a menace to the good future of our Fatherland!"
GER_no_compassion_for_himmler_desc:0 "The ties of our Fatherland to that traitorous pagan shall be severed. Completely cut off from us, this monster shall no longer benefit from our attention.\n\nLet him realize that we have had enough of him and of his schemes. Our Fatherland will no longer see him as one of our own.\n\nAnd with this in mind, the world will learn to let him rot."
GER_no_contact_order_desc:0 "Shorn of contact and information, the Himmlerite beasts will enjoy no help from us in creating their schemes. Thus weakened, the Burgundian hydra will be easier to manage\n\nThis will be our way of cutting them off from us.\n\nThe Fatherland will jam their transmissions, eliminate their agents, and destroy their connections."
GER_no_mercy_for_himmler_desc:0 "Hitler made a mistake with this man. We will not make the same mistake again. Unlike our dear Führer, we will ensure that Himmler's state shall no longer see the light which comes from our Fatherland.\n\nWhile they may possess nuclear weapons, we will not be intimidated. We will seal them away, confronting them for the demons that they are."
GER_a_confrontational_policy_desc:0 "We will meet the Burgundians every step of the way; we will face these traitorous monsters down at every turn they take.\n\nGermany, our Fatherland, shall no longer tolerate inaction towards them. We will waste nothing in our efforts to spite them and keep them from succeeding.\n\nBy doing this, we become their worst enemy. But that is the price we will be happy to pay for the sake of our people."
GER_no_friends_in_the_black_state_desc:0 "Germany does not need friends in Burgundy, and Burgundy will never have any allies in Germany again. Forcing them to become friendless is our next move.\n\nThey may exist as they please, despite the hatred the world has for them, but we will make sure that their existence becomes a hell for them.\n\nIf they stand against us for what we believe, so will we oppose them for their betrayal of Germany and of National Socialism!"
GER_the_reich_stands_against_monsters_desc:0 "We will never, ever support monsters again. The Fatherland shall see to it that neither support nor sympathy nor forgiveness shall be extended to the hollow men who have sold themselves to Himmler and his Black State.\n\nNo longer are they to us the men they once were; they are nothing but evil fiends seeking to bring down what we all stand for. Against them, our people shall be!\n\nDas Vaterland toleriert keine Monster!"
GER_two_giants_together_again_desc:0 "It's evident that our new course will bring us in competition with the United States. However, we want this to be a "new" kind of struggle, one made between nations which respect each other, and fought on the field of trade and industry with clear rules and without people dying in a senseless war.\n\nIn order to bring our nations together, we shall propose to our former enemy a conference. This meeting, to be held in Toronto, will set the foundations for a rapprochement, and who knows, perhaps the end of the embargo which is slowly suffocating our economy?"
GER_turn_back_the_doomsday_clock_desc:0 "We have made a very important decision. And this should not cost us more.\n\nWe shall see to it that our nuclear arsenal is reduced, and that our capabilities shall be regulated. It is a serious compromise, indeed, but it would be one great step towards getting the Americans to become more friendly with us."
GER_more_rights_for_slaves_desc:0 "Another agreement has been made. And that concerns our former property.\n\nWhat the Americans called slaves we shall treat more kindly. And hopefully that should show to them that we are more than willing to do what is right.\n\nAfter all, that is something we wished to do too. Let's just hope they don't rub that in our faces too much."
GER_first_in_trade_desc:0 "It's a big sacrifice for anyone to let go of the first of everything they own or earn. And for our Reich, it is going to be our own sacrifice to let the Americans have a taste of the resources we now possess.\n\nSurely, while this means great reward for us, this too should mean that our new American friends will benefit."
GER_toronto_accords_desc:0 ""With the conference ended in resounding success, we can now proudly say that we have opened a new era for our two countries! The United States of America and the Großgermanisches Reich are now bound by their own agreement to face each other in friendly and regulated competition, and to always seek out a diplomatic solution to any problem that may arise.\n\nWith the Toronto Accords, our economy will once more soar into the skies, and the German people will understand how righteous our cause was. Let this be the final gravestone on the mad dreams of those who tried to stop us!""
GER_home_of_the_brave_desc:0 "As a way to further increase our relationships with the United States, Helmut Schmidt has proposed a tour of the East Coast, during which he will meet and fraternize with the higher echelons of the American politics and government. This should help us achieve further benefits from our new partners.\n\nThe Führer has agreed to the proposal, but with a limit. As many landmarks within the former Thirteen Colonies have a deeper meaning than their outer appearance, it would be best to avoid anything which may irk the conservatives at home, after all - he argues - we are already making sweeping reforms, and it would be unwise to force our hand when we are still recovering from a civil war..."
GER_land_of_the_free_desc:0 "As a way to further increase our relationships with the United States, Helmut Schmidt has proposed a tour of the East Coast, during which he will meet and fraternize with the higher echelons of the American politics and government. This should help us achieve further benefits from our new partners.\n\nIn the end, the Führer has agreed to this proposal, and has allowed the Minister to visit all landmarks he desires as long as the Amerikaner agree. While this is sure to spark controversies in the Reich, as Schmidt will surely visit sites linked with the slaves' struggle for freedom, in the end our leader preferred to keep the Gang of Four content."
GER_that_grand_old_republic_desc:0 "As agreed upon, Reichsminister Schmidt has begun his tour of the most important landmarks in the East Coast, starting from Washington DC itself. However, he'll refrain from visiting monuments dedicated to happenings and people which would stand in stark contrast to what we are still doing within our homeland.\n\nAs such, while visits to the Capitol and the White House, as well as the Pentagon are scheduled, he will stay clear of the Lincoln Memorial and the commemorative plaques to those who died "to free the slaves". This may not sit well with his reformist spirit, but until we have fully abolished slavery, it would be rather controversial to be showed next to Lincoln's statue..."
GER_this_old_house_desc:0 "Finally, the great moment has come. After a formal dinner held at the White House, our Minister will sign the treaty which fully lifts the embargo, and officially inaugurate this new age of cooperation between our two countries.\n\nIn the following talks, we expect new trade deals to be signed, which will be a boon for our economy, and further aid us in rebuilding our country from the destruction of the civil war"
GER_a_house_divided_desc:0 "As expected, Reichsminister Schmidt visited the Lincoln Memorial and has been photographed proudly shaking hands with reform-aligned liberals of the American political sphere. While his views on the current policies undertaken by the Reich is known by everyone, turning the international stage into a megaphone for his personal ideals will surely have consequences.\n\nStill, one can't deny that this has further pleased the government of the United States, as its people now see Germany as a place striving to grant freedom to everyone. However, it remains to see whether such hopes will become reality..."
GER_a_strange_meeting_desc:0 "Finally, after all our efforts to woo the Americans, a German diplomat will meet with the President of the United States. It's been a long road to this point, full of trials and torment, but we are here, and that's what matters now. The diplomat in charge of this historic meeting is Helmut Schmidt, the Reich's best man for the job. If the meeting goes as planned, the President and Schmidt will sign a treaty that will bring about a new age upon the world, one of peace and economic stability."
GER_future_perfect_desc:0 "At the end of the civil war, the Reich was the laughing stock of the world, a textbook case of what happens to an empire built upon war, exploitation of the weak and isolationism. Now, this has changed, and our country is at the forefront of international cooperation, the embargo which has strangled our economy is no more, and we enter the world stage with our head held high.\n\nThanks to Schmidt's work, and despite his sometimes "extreme" views, our economy can finally flourish, as our ports fill with ships from foreign lands and our industries sell their goods to the entire world! This is the new Großgermanisches Reich, a prosperous land, filled with opportunities! A country respected inside and outside by all! An empire upon which the sun of National Socialism shall never set!"
GER_our_acquaintances_from_across_the_sea_desc:0 "Despite focusing our efforts on our relationship with the Empire of the Rising Sun, we should still keep all doors open. The United States would still be a good trade partner, if we managed to convince them to lift, at least partially, their embargo. However, this probably won't come for free, the Amerikaner are "the land of the free" and will surely ask for proof that we are truly different from the likes of Göring and Heydrich.\n\nIn order to improve our relationships with the United States, we shall send Reichsminister Schmist on a good-will tour in the States. His charm and his well-known reformist views will ease the way towards a treaty, if not of friendship, at least of reciprocate acceptance."
GER_the_perpetual_long_night_desc:0 "The United States asks for "reassurances" about our good will? Of course, we'll give them as many as they ask for! Words are cheap, and can be expended freely without any cost; actions, on the other hand, are a different matter entirely...\n\nWe won't bow to the Amerikaner! We didn't kneel during the war, and we surely won't do it now that we are retaking our legitimate place among the world powers! They'll have their precious "words" if they so desire, but that's what they will remain. Words. Like a perpetual night never making way for the dawn, we shall forever oppose our opponents and their false "freedom" they are so proud of!"
GER_a_new_dawn_desc:0 "Despite our wishes and dreams, we simply can't make the same mistakes all over again. The Four have pointed out a strategy that, in the long run, will bring the Reich back on its feet, and for now, the only sensible choice is to follow it, the people of both Germany and the United States desire a change in course, and we can't deny that granting them such change would be much better than opposing it.\n\nIn order to improve our international standing and tap into new sources of international trade, we will enact a moderate amount of true reforms aimed at spreading a bit of "freedom" throughout Germany. We can only hope this turns out to be a new dawn for the Vaterland, rather than a return to the night..."
GER_moonlighting_desc:0 "Even the night has its own light. Just as the moon shines from the darkness, we shall grant the Amerikaner a bit of what they desire, new laws will be passed granting "freedom" to the people, but behind the letter of the law, there will be a sea of exceptions and secondary legislation which de facto voids our reforms of any real meaning.\n\nLying through the teeth is humiliating indeed, but we won't be subservient to the United States of America, and if a screen of illusions is what we need to make them treat us better, then this is what they shall have!"
GER_broken_promises_desc:0 "The time has come to keep our promises. Did we truly make any promise, though? Did the Amerikaner think a nation as great as ours, as great as the Reich, would submit to the decadent, reactionary democracies which lost the last war due to their own weakness and cowardice?!\n\nTo the furnace with their promises! The scraps of paper they brought us as "proof" of their pretenses will be much-needed fuel for the new Germany we are building! Let the inferiors shout at our "lies" as they lick their wounded pride, but we do not lie, because the words of the strongest always ring true regardless of their content!"
GER_broken_hearts_desc:0 "Many in Europe hoped that we would become a beacon of liberalism, of freedom, of equality. Today, we make it clear that we won't lower ourselves to their level, after all, our ideology has been born out of the delusion towards such a flawed system as liberalism.\n\n\nEquality and freedom have brought the so-called great powers of the last century to their end, and we surely won't follow in their footsteps! Let their frail hearts break, for our own have been reforged in iron to take the pain of the civil war, the Reich needs only dedication, and we already have that in large amounts!"
GER_a_new_sheriff_in_town_desc:0 "With their victory over the conservatives, the Gang of Four have proved their strength and their ability to influence the Führer's decisions. Even though Albert Speer is independent in his action, he has de facto accepted to let Schmidt oversee his diplomatic approaches towards the United States, granting him almost total freedom of actions.\n\nThere's a new sheriff in town, or four to be precise.

Furthermore, they have been increasingly attentive with our efforts to underhandedly spread the cracks in the foundations of the Japanese Sphere. Although what we did was necessary to ensure that the Japanese do not soon come to dominate our own spheres of influence, the four men grow skeptical of the Führer's intent, as above the table he acts as a friend to Tokyo, but below as a foe.\n\nRegardless of their skepticism, they should be placated for the time being by our steps to avoid another costly overseas intervention such as South Africa. That is what they truly fear, and they have the Führer's most sincere assurances that such a blunder shall never again occur, no matter the stakes."

It may help them, too, but what's a world without a dose of Realpolitik?\n\nWe will have some minor concerns to deal with about what the U.S. feels on us attempting to spark diplomacy with the Japanese, meaning we cannot go all-out on our efforts, but we can still make significant efforts. There are two main things to deal with: removing trade barriers, and negotiating the reduction of sanctions.\n\nLet's get down to business."

First, however, we must cover a few bases. The Reich will begin organizing diplomats to Tokyo, and we will see if the Japanese government is at all interest in reciprocating any deals we might make with them.\n\nNot only that, we must make sure that there is something that we can give, in exchange for what Japan can give to us.

We must make a choice - and there are two ways to go about this.\n\nThe first is to assure the Americans that this will be a nominal decrease in sanctions. After all, we first decided to venture into Capitol Hill and be friends with the U.S. No need to risk looking like we're stabbing them in the back. The second is to make the Americans listen to reason.

 GER_achilles_heel_struck_desc:0 "And we thought we had it all. For the first time in decades, the Reich's future had seemed bright - the economy was on the up, civil strife was at a low, and the people's confidence in their government was unparalleled since the days of Hitler. It only takes a breeze to set the whole house of cards wobbling, however, and the winds of change are blowing.\n\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and this Oil Crisis has hit us where it hurts - the economy. Sudden shortages have halted the flow of capital and material, and prices on the Frankfurt Stock Market have plummeted to levels unseen since the Fifties. We aren't the only nation left scrambling - fuel shortages mean international trade has become prohibitively expensive. If we want to drag ourselves out of this hole, it's going to be by our own efforts."

 GER_heart_bleeds_desc:0 "The Crisis is taking its toll. Countless businesses have closed their doors indefinitely, and the unemployed have started to fill the streets. Where only days ago Germans would have believed they were in the middle of a golden age, now they the government do something, anything to stop the spiralling situation. They demand work, food, aid for their families, something to show that the Reich has not returned to the disaster of the Fifties, or even the hell that was the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe Reich's arteries have been cut, and its blood is spilling across Europe. It shows no sign of stopping."
 GER_west_cowers_desc:0 "While the Western members of the Zollverein are not as intrinsically linked to Germany as the East is, they too have been hit by the ongoing Crisis. Their more independent economies are crumpling under the pressure, facing similar problems of mass unemployment and plummeting stock prices to those of the Reich.\n\nBelts are being tightened across Western Europe, and governments are implementing rapid programs of austerity, slashing budgets and implementing wild spending cuts. Unfortunately this includes their contributions to the Zollverein. Another avenue of credit has been cut off to us, and it is becoming increasingly clear that we must deal with this crisis ourselves."
 GER_east_screams_desc:0 "Eastern Europe is burning. Having only recently obtained independence, the largely German-owned industry from Krakau to Moskau is still focused on the export of goods to the Reich. With the lack of buyers and sudden diesel shortages destroying both supply and demand, their economies have halted with all the grace of a crashing freight train.\n\nExacerbating the problem are the millions of repatriated slaves suddenly left jobless and homeless - what little goodwill we have earned with their freedom has been annihilated as they take to the streets, rioting against both their former German masters and their countrymen lucky enough to have maintained their freedom. The ongoing economic crisis is rapidly becoming a societal one, and without intervention this may be the blow that finally kills German dominion over the East."
 GER_was_sein_muss_desc:0 "We have wasted valuable time flapping our arms in confusion - we must act. An emergency conference must be called in order to decide our response to the crisis. Führer Speer and his partners-in-reform, the Gang of Four will come together in an emergency session and chart the course the Reich must follow through these deadly waters.\n\nWhat must stay and what must be jettisoned in order to keep the Reich afloat? There is already one particularly large money hole which has been eyed to be sealed up - but would sealing this fissure simply create another in the corridors of power?"
 GER_muss_sein_desc:0 "Hard times call for harder decisions, and it takes hard men to make those decisions. Some might call it callous, or cruel, but it takes little to criticise and everything to act. This decision is made not for the Führer, or for his ministers in the Gang of Four. Not for the Party, or even for the Reich. This is a decision that must ensure the safety of all of Europe, lest the continental system we have worked so hard to maintain come crumbling down. We will hold our heads high when the people throw their insults and insights at this most dire of choices, for we know that in the end, it will all be worth it.\n\nWon't it?"
 GER_the_fuhrers_will_desc:0 "Führer Speer has triumphed over the misguided Gang of Four and the petty bureaucrats of the party. Their involvement would divide the Reich further, weakening the power of the Führer. Only the Führer's vision can successfully guide his greatest project through this time of crisis. There will be no bickering; no petty arguments over menial things. Speer's plan is the only plan, a perfect balance between the two factions threatening to tear the Reich apart. They won't get a chance under Speer's watch. He'll be watching them like a hawk, monitoring them and always staying one step ahead. This is the Führer's time to shine, and shine he will."
 GER_to_the_people_desc:0 "The situation throughout the Reich has, to be put bluntly, gone to shit. There are millions of unemployed standing in lines for bread and even more sitting in the streets. Everyone has been impacted by this crisis.\n\nIt is imperative that Speer addresses this. He will make a speech to the people, assuring them that this will pass. The prosperity enjoyed before was not a passing fad, it will come again as soon as the crisis is over. We will become stronger through this, learn from our mistakes, and possibly even surpass our previous level of richness. Are we going to give up just because of a lack of oil? Are we content to watch German children starve, proud men resort to begging? No, never! The Aryan spirit will not be crushed by some greedy, incompetent Italians!\n\nAt least, that's what Speer hopes will happen. Hopefully everyone else buys it."
 GER_to_the_party_desc:0 "The Party is in chaos. Though Speer's reforms have been successful, they have also succeeded in polarizing the Party to levels not seen since the civil war. While these tensions have remained mostly in mere quiet disagreement, the crisis at hand has made them flare up once more. The Party is fracturing and refuses to cooperate with itself, slowing our response to a virtual halt.\n\nWhile the Party may not cooperate with itself, it must cooperate with the Führer. Speer will hold a speech urging them to cooperate with him. The Party has always been unified behind a man, not just any man, but the paragon of the Aryan race, the Führer. That Führer is Speer. This crisis is temporary, but the Reich is forever."
 GER_fuhrererlass_desc:0 "Speer has a unified plan now. It is the only plan that will be acted out, that is final. There will be no more bickering or arguing, no more endless changes midway through. The plan has a set beginning, middle, and end. Nothing about it will change unless absolutely necessary. It is Speer's blueprint for Germany's response, and it will be our response.\n\nWe will target poverty first, providing immediate relief to the populace. Once we get them jobs, we can start working on the economy and preparing Germany for the aftereffects of the crisis. We will need to purchase oil from various sources, possibly even our enemies. We will also support more sources supportive of us in the Middle East.\n\nWe can only hope that this works as intended."
 GER_ambrosia_of_the_north_desc:0 "Norway is rumored to have large stores of precious oil in its waters. Normally projects like this would be placed on the back burner, reserved for another time when we have fixed all of our immediate problems. This is not a normal time, and all resources must be dedicated to the problem at hand. If the rumors of oil in Norwegian waters is true then it could be a solution to our oil shortage. We must invest in new infrastructure and drilling companies to harvest this black gold. Hopefully this investment bears fruit."
 GER_panacea_in_the_west_desc:0 "America has always had large reserves of oil. It's unique in that it's largely self-sufficient in oil. If we were to somehow able to convince the Americans to do business with us, we could gain a large amount of oil in exchange for the Americans getting a large amount of our money. It's a win-win situation, despite the obvious ramifications of dealing with the enemy. We can only hope that we can somehow negotiate with them for some oil. Of course, they may see it as their enemies begging them for oil, something that would definitely cause a rejection. Desperate times call for desperate measures though, and this is a good shot at getting some more oil."
 GER_a_common_goal_desc:0 "It's not enough to be right, you have to convince people you're right. As he has molded the Reich in his image, Speer must be prepared to mold the public opinion to his liking as well. A new propaganda campaign to change the public opinion to something more... favorable must be enacted. We're all in this together, and can't be torn apart by petty ideological differences. This will hopefully make both the reactionaries in the party and the idealists in the Gang of Four look like petty bastards bent on their own personal agendas rather than helping the Reich. Then, with the public placated, we can finish resolving this crisis."
 GER_epione_in_the_east_desc:0 "Japan may not have large stores of oil, but they do have a weakened economy. If we can convince them to send us some of what little oil they have in exchange for some financial compensation. then our problem may begin to alleviate. It's another win-win situation, and besides, we're both dying anyway. It doesn't make sense to kill yourself just to take your enemy down."
 GER_a_united_future_desc:0 "The Reich has helped to build up the other members of the Zollverein, and in return they should help to build up the Reich. It's like a body, with the Reich as the head and the rest of the Zollverein as the limbs and organs. It's only natural they help to keep the Reich alive and health in our time of need, even if it is at their own expense. Considering that the Zollverein is built around the Reich, this "voluntary self sacrifice" will be much more preferable to a full-scale economic collapse. At least, that's what we'll tell them. Hopefully the natives won't be... too mad about this."
 GER_the_modern_asclepius_desc:0 "The Führer is the ultimate authority in the Reich. He is a reliable man, capable of handling all of the burdens of the Reich single-handedly in times of crisis. He is the paragon of Aryan values, the repeller of degeneracy, the destroyer of the Jew, the protector of the Aryan family, the architect of the Reich- that man is Speer. Führer Speer is the only man capable of saving the Aryan people from degeneracy in these times of crisis.\n\nAt least, that's what we hope the people believe. If they don't, then we'll make them believe it. No opposition against the Führer can remain."
 GER_volksarchitekt_desc:0 "It isn't ideal. Our nation had barely returned to a sense of normalcy before it was once again plunged into a war that affects all. But, not in the traditional sense, where spirit and strength of arms prevails, but money. Capital. Then there is always the risk of the people being led astray as well. For the first time since we have cast off the shackles of degeneracy, the German people are unruly. They defy those who have granted them prosperity. They yell and scream at the party, calling for more and more reforms. These are perhaps our greatest foes; equal only to the Eternal Jew.\n\nI'm proud of the German people. The Fatherland has faced incredible adversity, and once again its foundation has remained solid. The Reich remains as a great monument to the Aryan Race! The world must have very low expectations of my greatest work, for the common consensus was that of a devastated, spent nation that would not only lose its status of "Superpower", but our vast holdings as well. What a joke; the rest of the world continues to underestimate us.\n\nWe will prevail. Our structure remains strong, and we will rebuild. We have successfully weathered all crises so far, and we will continue to do so. Nothing can tear the Reich down, and nothing will change the fact that we are the unchallenged masters of Europe."
 GER_the_fours_vision_desc:0 "Catastrophe has struck the globe, and it comes in many different forms. In the sands of the Middle East, it comes in the form of blood and lead. In the banks and stock exchanges of Germania, Tokyo, Rome, New York, and just about anywhere else, it comes in the form of economic disaster. Oil prices have skyrocketed as supply disappears, melted away by the fires of war that consume the world's main oil supplier.\n\nSuch disaster cannot be waved away through propaganda, nor can it simply be ignored by dogmatists- already, the average German citizen feels the pinch as their gas prices skyrocket and the worth of their currency falls- but it cannot be the beginning of the end for the economic reforms that have saved the German economy. It must be handled carefully by visionaries, men who truly know what to do and how to mitigate such a crisis without causing long term damage- men like Ludwig Erhard and the Gang of Four. With their gentle guidance and forward vision, Germany will emerge from this rocky period stronger than ever."
 GER_energiesicherungsgesetz_desc:0 "Energiesicherungsgesetz- the Law for the Ensurance of Energy Supply- is the latest creation of the Gang and their preferred economists. Rapidly put together to face the growing crisis, it shall be the backbone of our response to the economic collapse that we face today. It's quite ironic that the name is such a mouthful to say, for it will certainly simplify the Gang's efforts in recovering and replenishing the German economy.\n\nIn short, the law will effectively give the Gang the power to mandate any means they see as necessary to combat the crisis. Such measures are certainly a great expansion of the Gang's power and will certainly ruffle conservative feathers, but with the combined weight of Kiesinger and Speer pushing it through the Volkshalle, we should have no trouble passing it into the books. Soon, we can truly get to work on fixing this mess."
 GER_the_german_way_desc:0 "Austerity- the practice of cutting expenses and programs in order for the government to save money, with the hopes of waiting out the crisis. Such methods have been used by governments the world over for decades now, and while it certainly does lead to results, the downside is simply too great to be ignored. Germany has already suffered through years of austerity in the 50's- years of economic stagnation, of high unemployment and steadily falling quality of life. We cannot make the same mistake again, lest we slide right back into such a dire state.\n\nGermany cannot suffer the way it did. There is a better way of dealing with our economic woes- one of deals, aid, and a careful playing of the markets. By taking a proactive stance against economic failure, we shall stand stronger than ever while our rivals are forced into destructive budget cuts and financial withdrawal. When this crisis comes to a close- and one day, it will- we shall find ourselves on top of the economic world, with our enemies struggling to recover beneath us."
 GER_the_european_way_desc:0 "The Zollverein, once the great symbol of progress for Europe and the German economy, now stands as a lead weight pulling us further into the depths of recession. If Germany has been hit hard by the Oil Crisis, Eastern Europe has been devastated by it. Europe's economic situation is incredibly fragile as is- action must be taken to stabilize and strengthen it before it can fail completely.\n\nNobody outside of the most extreme conservative voices calls for an end to the Zollverein, but it is obvious that a stern hand must guide these failed economies back to prosperity if we wish to ride out this storm safely. Though taking more direct action towards the East will certainly lead to great backlash and increased short-term cost- German dominance is still a very sore spot for our partners- it is necessary to save the Reich proper. They will learn to follow our lead, or we will force them to."
 GER_pulling_on_one_rope_desc:0 "Hard times call for strong men, as the saying goes, and few times threaten to be as hard as the ones ahead of us should we fail in our mission. Germany cannot fray and falter as the looming specter of economic collapse creeps towards us. All of German society- from the lowest workers to the highest officials- must be pulling towards the Gang's solutions. Any weakness will cost us dearly if not stamped out with haste.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many signs of weakness in the Reich today. Party extremists, barbarians who still call for such ridiculous measures as autarky and exploitation of Eastern Europe, still make up a sizable chunk of our administration. If left unattended, they will wreak havoc on our efforts to save the Reich. This cannot be allowed. They must be sidelined, replaced with men more suited to our aims. Then, and only then, will the Reich truly be ready to withstand the coming storm."
 GER_a_united_response_desc:0 "After months of fighting, we must admit the facts- no nation alone can hold off the sheer power of this disaster. Despite our efforts, we are only able to stabilize our economy at its low point by ourselves- and tenuously, at that. To truly recover to pre-Crisis levels, we must work together with our European brothers.\n\nThe Zollverein, for its many faults and failings, has provided the perfect groundwork for continental cooperation. It will be no easy task to bind together Europe into one response- decades of fighting and oppression have not made our job simple- but it is an undertaking that we must go through. We must work together as one, or our economy, our government, and the progress we have worked so hard for shall be in vain."
 GER_budget_renegotiations_desc:0 "The Oil Crisis continues to grind away at our financial institutions, but the initial shock of economic failure seems to be wearing off. Now is not the time to hunker down and bear the brunt of the assault, as our rivals do- now is the time to lay the groundwork of recovery. The first step has already been laid out, and it promises to be the most decisive move yet.\n\nWhen the Oil Crisis first tore into the Zollverein, our partners were left no choice but to significantly reduce their contributions to the organization, leading to a precipitous budgetary shortfall- one that must be addressed. By renegotiating these contributions, the Gang hopes to restore payments to their pre-Crisis levels. Of course, such contributions in the middle of a recession cannot be gained without giving something in return.\n\nIn exchange for their restored payments, Germany shall offer to increase its own commitment- achieving de facto parity with our partners. Is this costly? Yes. Is it controversial? Of course- conservatives within the Reich race each other to denounce what they see as intentional weakening of Germany's status in Europe. But is it necessary? Absolutely- and the complaints of the out of touch cannot be allowed to hold the Reich back."
 GER_the_peoples_forum_desc:0 "Democracy is a dying, bitter dream within Germany - but it yet lives. The crisis that has shaken the superpowers to their core and forced them all to think differently has impacted every echelon of the Reich's society, from the top brass of the NSDAP down to the forgotten slave in ways both good and bad. As the Gang has pulled their weight in this time and attempted to fix the breached hole by making sure the economy remains to stay on its own two feet, a phenomenon has occurred.\n\nThe Gang - and especially their unwilling ally Speer, can see it; in the wake of government instability and a lack of focus towards putting down internal dissent, the voices swirling around Germany's democratic movement have finally begun to form into something coherent. Political movements, as sporadic and as small as they may be, are starting to appear.\n\nDemocracy can no longer remain merely a dream."
 GER_government_outreach_desc:0 "The National Socialist German Workers' Party is, on a legal basis, the only party that is allowed to exist - all others having been officially dissolved long ago. This, along with other policies of the National Socialist administration, has shattered overt resistance against the government. Only as the world has begun catching fire and Germany's inner pillars of stability have been rocked has there been an opportunity for the more bold anti-fascist members to truly begin rallying against the NSDAP and their cronies.\n\nThe Gang cannot challenge Speer - not yet - but they can begin to undermine him. These many groups, though scattered and lacking in communication, are a valuable asset, and all members of the Gang will begin using all the influence they have built up over the many years of being ministers and perceived allies of the Führer to funnel resources into the last stand against Germany's dark tide.\n\nThe hour where fascism grows strongest comes - the question of destiny hangs in the air, and nobody is certain how it will be answered. One can only hope that the Hakenkreuz does not rule Europe forevermore."

Carrying flags, waving banners, representing the part of German society that had only existed within feverish propaganda pieces set only to demonize them as 'anti-fascist Jew-lovers' and nothing more. Now, with the NSDAP's grasp on public control weakening by the day, more people find themselves emboldened to go out on the streets, from towns of ten thousands to the landmarks of Nazi domination in Germany, all march and demand something more. In their eyes, the concept of 'change' is not enough.\n\nThough many, if not most, still consider the dream of a democratic Germany dead in the water, the voices of a large part of the country cannot be denied. To the Gang, a populace slowly turning against a nation that is now openly bleeding from their wounds, with a divided government and cliques of power, and a future that could lead to a thousand different directions...\n\nIt felt all too familiar."

As the ashes of the German Civil War resided, buildings burnt down being rebuilt, fallen soldiers given their graves, and those afflicted slowly returning to a semblance of normal life, they were afraid that the Nazi death grip of propaganda would choke out what was left of a redeemable future.\n\nAnd yet they continued to hope. Years and years down the line, as the thin drew narrower and Speer's power grow as his and the Gang's sweeping reforms began forging Germany into a new sort of superpower, those who sought freedom from Nazi rule saw a window of opportunity, and the fight in the dark began anew.\n\nThen, the match was struck. With the coming and going of the economic crash and internal disarray, alongside the Gang's subtle interference, the movement against the government has exploded - to the point where it has grown out of their control.\n\nLudwig Erhard, Henning von Tresckow, Helmut Schmidt, and Kurt Georg Kiesinger, though they continue to work within and against the NSDAP, watch as Germany's fate draws closer and closer, more rapidly than perhaps anyone would expect."

Hitler's vision was bold and revolutionary, and it worked, and worked well.\n\nWith a long list of demands from the NSDAP's hardliners, Speer must now look over all of them in their demand to return back to Germany's roots.

 speeroilcrisis.1.desc:0 "Dietrich slowly doused the cigarette from his mouth into the ashtray with a shaky hand. He'd been running on empty for the past twenty-eight hours - the worst twenty-eight he ever had to experience in his life. Ever since he had been woken up, anxiety shot through him like a hailstorm of bullets. With the situation escalating in the Middle East, he heard that it was better to start selling his stocks in the oil industry now to avoid becoming penniless.\n\nBeing the risky contrarian that he was, Dietrich decided against going what common sense and insider information told him. That everything would generally be fine with the German economy. Some bumps, sure, but never anything crippling.\n\nUntil he had received an analytics report back from the Frankfurt Stock Market. Its index - he saw the graph crash downwards first before the number, and he had to pop some pain relief pills to subdue the severe headache he got. All of his investments were practically wiped out, since so many others got out and sold what they had, he was left with a pitiful amount of Reichsmarks to make back. Everything that he had built up over the years - gone in an instant."

 speeroilcrisis.2.t:0 "What To Do, What To Do..."
 speeroilcrisis.2.desc:0 "Nobody in the gathering room wanted to be there. Not Erhard, staring in the mirror at his own mistakes; not Kiesinger, expecting another massive headache with how angry the hardliners must have felt; not Tresckow, who had half a mind to stick his foot through the door in retaliation against political dissidents in the Wehrmacht starting up again; not Schmidt, who felt his role as Minister of Foreign Affairs now reduced as a joke while the world scrambled in fear around him; and not least the visionary architect Speer, the bedrock of his operation as Führer now shaky.\n\nThe five men found themselves with stiff air and even stiffer words. As they all stared at each other, it was Kiesinger who broke the silent unease. "The main issue we should remain concerned about is Germany and the Einheitspakt. Everything else is secondary."\n\n"A decline in influence worldwide..." Erhard grumbled, rubbing his forehead.\n\n"If it makes you feel any better, Herr Erhard," Tresckow began, giving a neutral, not-very-passionate look towards the Minister of the Economy, "this affects both the United States and Japan. I've been told by the RND that Japan will be hit especially hard by this. So we shouldn't suffer so much as they will."\n\n"Oh, but we'll suffer alright." Schmidt hunched over a number of papers that were handed to him by Erhard, detailing how things were practically rapidly going downhill domestically. Let alone with Germany's co-dependents. "This is a mess..." He muttered.\n\n"No, Herr Schmidt, I don't think so." Speer spoke, alerting Schmidt do his presence, who gazed at him with curiosity and the constant aura of subtle irritation. "We need only do one thing at a time like this.""

 speeroilcrisis.3.t:0 "So Much To Do, So Little Time"
 speeroilcrisis.3.desc:0 "In a single room, five men spent hours debating a thousand years.\n\nTwo sides stood opposed to one another as they all had convened to two topics: the economy, and the repatriation of the slaves. Speer and Erhard did not mince their words nor did they try to hide the fact that Germany's economy was beginning to suffocate rapidly at the hands of the crisis, though Erhard bit his tongue and hid his regrets as he had discussed measures of austerity, and, most importantly, the temporary ceasing of repatriation. While Tresckow stood divided, Kiesinger and Schmidt made their stances clear.\n\n"You would cause a revolt by doing that!" Schmidt shot a glare towards Erhard, who only looked at him with musing of disappointment in his eyes.\n\n"And we would cause a revolt with our citizens if our economy crashed because we prioritized the slaves over our own!" Schmidt felt himself stop when he heard Speer speak those words, and struggled to muster a retort.\n\n"At the very least, I suggest we don't lock the budget down. We cannot let the economy stall by halting our actions. I would offer increasing expenditures - a bigger deficit means nothing if it lets us avoid negative growth." Kiesinger said.\n\nSpeer eyed the Minister of Economics with a renewed interest. For the first time in a long time, the aura of close cooperation between the Gang began to crack. Erhard spoke. "Perhaps we can keep the economy open for now. But when it comes to repatriation..." When his cigar hit the ashtray, the sizzle felt like the loudest thing in the world."

 speeroilcrisis.4.t:0 "A Bittersweet Victory"
 speeroilcrisis.4.desc:0 ""Then what is it, Erhard? We let even more of the former slaves live in squalor, giving them all the reason they need to hang us with the rope we've sold to them? Do you know what the consequences of this action will be?"\n\nThe biting words were perhaps what Erhard needed to hear, but it did not diminish how painful they felt. Especially coming from a man like Schmidt. "I'm well-aware," was his flat reply. "But, and this may be a dangerous assumption to make, they know they'll need Germany in order to fully recover. Without the Zollverein, the situation in the East would be a catastrophe. We'll just have to push through. No matter the cost."\n\nFor the second time now, Schmidt found himself uncertain as to what to say. What could he do? An appeal to sympathy meant nothing. It could not alter the reality that, in this broken shamble of a nation, sacrifices had to be made if he ever wanted to drag Germany from its National Socialist history. The color on his face still drained, however, and he still leaned back to grab a hand to his forehead and sigh. At this point, Kiesinger and Tresckow both disconnected themselves from the conversation, as neither wanted to rock the boat. The conclusion seemed inevitable. But-\n\n"You-" Schmidt spoke, prompting Speer to raise an eyebrow. "Well... let the die be cast. We'll see what happens next."\n\nWith a relieved sigh, Speer looked towards the group, but kept an eye towards Schmidt. Of them all, Schmidt was doubly as invested as the rest of the three combined. So much so that it was as if a piece of him was directly tied to the fate of the slaves, and that it would live and die with them. And he was already the biggest pain in the Gang as it stood. When Speer spoke next, Schmidt shot him a glare that seemed almost visceral in its reaction, but subdued to the point where it was as if he tried to hide it."

At the very least, the worst was out of the way - they had come to a conclusion on how to stop the worst of Germany's bleeding wounds, even if it resulted in disgruntlement from Schmidt, and less so from Kiesinger and Tresckow. Now they had moved on to other matters. This time, Erhard took the stand, but against the Führer - not with him.\n\n"They might not like the fact we've stopped the repatriation, but at the very least, we can try to show that the Einheitspakt- or more accurately speaking, the Zollverein, isn't just there to ravage eastern Europe and exploit it to its fullest extent. They might not have much of an economy, true, but their sheer collective size and manpower pool is useful for the sake of keeping our numbers afloat." Even though Erhard spoke with confidence, he still felt himself frown and let out a quiet sigh when Speer shook his head.\n\n"No, Herr Erhard. That's just going back to a circular argument. Germany comes first - anything else would only lead to outrage and stability in our home territory, and the east is already unhappy; we don't need that anger to spread here, too. After all, we are the architects of Europe's future, and every good plan starts with criticism." He could feel Schmidt's burning gaze, even if he couldn't see it in the moment. "Instead, we can reach out to the rest of the world and craft a more humane image of Germany. To some extent, I assume it'd appease both you and the NSDAP, and it'd help kickstart our economy back again."\n\nThen again - he had wondered. Was that even necessary? It was not as risky as trying to pull the Zollverein together, true, but it was very possible that wherever they attempted to pull their grasp towards would just deny them, and it'd all be for naught. There was always the option of going towards the party, which would most certainly launch a massive propaganda campaign just as they always would. As far as he knew, it worked, and during a time like this, he had already stoked the flames of Germany's non-Aryan allies, so this move would be yet another candle lit up. Still, it did mean working with the more unsavory kind of National Socialists..."

His wife and their two sons were still back in Germany, and he had no idea when they would come back. Before winter, he hoped. If only before winter.\n\nThe letter that slid under his door was something he only noticed an entire day after it arrived, whereupon he stepped and nearly slipped on it by accident. Nervousness ached at his heart when he tore open the cover and read the sloppy Polish, but it was nothing compares to the horror he felt when he began to actually read it.\n\n"Mister Fedyr..." He muttered under his breath. "We deeply apologize for bringing you this sudden news, but the Reich has currently put the matter of repatriation on... permanent.. h-hiatus..." His thumbs dug into the sides. How could they do this to him? To her? To the children? "We hope you understand the necessity. We will make sure your family members are taken care of-"\n\nBetrayal flashed across his face, and in an instant the letter ripped in two, anger coursing throughout his system as he threw the pieces of paper against the wall, letting out an unrestricted scream as he did so.

"Someone must've told. I bet it was Pavel." He snorted a laugh, and the man at the bar rolled his eyes.

Everything is ramshack here, organizations included."\n\nWith a sly smile on his lips, Maxim leaned forward. "Told us to join the fight. Talked about freedom from tyranny. No name, only a few letters. R-SRG. Ring any bells?"\n\nNobody seemed to know how to respond for a moment- then a glass rolled against the wooden table, and everyone looked towards Sofie.

Not only had she been fighting against the government for years now, but recently she was inducted into a new, seemingly fledgling movement named Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, waving the old tricolor that had been so commonly associated with democracy, now snuffed out under the Nazi dictatorship.\n\nWith a deep breath, Emilia reached under her coat and grabbed a bottle stuffed with alcohol and rope, and a lighter followed alongside with it. The cacophony of noise surrounding her as police both pushed in and retreated back gave her enough of a cover to light the Zhdanov cocktail and let the flames burn against the wind before a hefty chuck threw it straight into the center of the police barricade. The moment the bottle struck it, a great ball of flame erupted, and everything only went downwards into further chaos.\n\nEmilia subconsciously grinded her teeth together from stress for a moment before opening her mouth and letting out a rallying cry to the people behind her - the police would be too busy being distracted, and she would at least give them the best show of resistance possible when the military hadn't yet arrived. As she did, her eyes could spot rifles from the back being trained towards her and the protesters, and she could only force a sharp, surprised intake of breath."

Without it the crisis would be much worse. But it may need to be changed to better fit into this modern age.\n\nFor once, Erhard began imagining a better future. He'd always opposed the slave labor in the Reichskommissariats- it wasn't as profitable as making them equal workers. Plus, the goods were frequently sabotaged by them, a small act of resistance against an oppressive regime. It made sense to abolish it, regardless of Erhard's personal views. He was the only one to see that. Erhard fancied himself as a sort of economic messiah to the Reich. If that was the case, then the Romans were the party. Erhard thought back to him and Schmidt's discussion about the crisis and the Reich. The party really did need to go, didn't it?

It could all change. As if on cue, Speer burst into the room.\n\n"Kiesinger!" His voice snapped the Gang out of their discussion, and they all looked towards him, suddenly filled with unease. Speer looked more than just uneasy himself. "The protestors keep filling the streets, and they're starting to ramp up their demands! The Reich seems like it's crumbling down all around me! What the hell did I ask you to help me fix this for?!" He demanded as an explanation, but judging by the expression on his face he wasn't expecting one either. With an imperceptible sigh and a nod, Kiesinger got out of his seat as Speer motioned for him to leave. He gave the rest of the Gang a half-glare and stepped out of the room.\n\nThe rest of the gang stood in silence for a moment. Then, Tresckow smiled and spoke."

We are all Aryans, all children of the fatherland, after all! Trust in your Führer! I will guide you all to victory! Remain calm and steadfast, it is the Aryan way!" Speer took a moment to examine the crowd. They were listening; their attention absolute. It was hard for Speer not to smirk. It was all going according to his design. "We will overcome this crisis, as we have overcame all before! Remember the victories of the Second Weltkrieg, the West Russian War, and the Bürgerkrieg! Are you just going to let those who died there go to waste because you've succumbed to capitalist degeneracy?" Speer looked out over the crowd. They seemed pleased.

There has been some knowledge of petroleum trapped beneath the waters of the Nordsee for generations, but the technological difficulty of finding and extracting this petroleum--as well as the availability of extensive oil deposits in the eastern Reichskommissariats--have long hindered Germania's interest in investing in oil exploration in the region.\n\nNow, though, with the economic unrest wrought by the Oil Crisis, the exploitation of the Nordsee deposits has become much more economical. The first reports from the enterprising companies in the region have already been delivered to the Führer's desk, and have made Speer duly aware of the modest successes already achieved thus far.

German diplomats and industrialists have made numerous overtures to American businessmen already, trying to coax Texan oil tycoons into sending their products abroad to be sold to the Germans for a pretty penny. Now, though, these efforts have become more official: Mr. Speer has personally reached out to us, promising that Germany will pay through its teeth to have access to the extensive oil production of the United States of America. We could always use more money, and selling the Germans our oil might help mend relations between us.

We can manage ourselves, and I can make sure to put our resources to good use. The details can be ironed out later. Does this sound acceptable?"\n\nSpeer could put together the pieces and assume well in advance what would happen if he agreed to this offer.

Violence in Germany's eastern territories, and cases of it sprouting mainly in administrative areas. He had a feeling that, ever since he had conceded to the Zollverein funneling vast amounts of currency and materials back into Germany, Oberländer would be all too eager to strike a dagger into wherever non-Aryans lived... and judging from the cases he read, Oberländer's goons were succeeding. Inefficiently, and needlessly antagonizing the native populace, but it worked. Even if some ended with violence and death.\n\nA part of him felt like this cycle he saw occurring was all too familiar to him.

He returned his gaze to the camera and grinned, shuffling his notes. "People of Germany. Things are bad - I don't have to tell you that. Everyone's out of work, or losing their job. The Reichsmark buys a penny's worth. There are riots in the streets, and we sit watching our TVs while some newscaster tells us that today the Orpo killed fifteen people in the name of peace, like that's the way it's supposed to be. This government doesn't give a shit about you! It only cares about enriching itself, or funnelling money to those corrupt bastards at IG Farben."\n\n"Things are bad - worse than bad, they're crazy. We sit in the house while everything is getting worse, and say 'Please, just let me have my TV that was made by some poor Pole on a penny's wages, leave me alone.' Well, I'm not leaving you alone. I want you to get mad. Get mad about the Oil Crisis, and the Stock Market Crash, and the Cold War, and the murders committed by our government every day. I want you to say 'I'm a human being, goddamnit! My life has value!"\n\n"I want you to go out into the streets, cause things aren't going to change until you get mad! I want you to go out there and shout 'I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!' Get up out of your chairs, go to the window and let the government know 'I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!'"\n\nPieter got out of his chair, and opened the window. People were yelling. He put on his coat, opened the door, walked out into the street, and opened his mouth."

Just glancing out of the corner of his eye, he could count two broken arms, a neck brace and more black eyes than he'd ever seen. The woman before him looked more like she'd just left a car accident than a peaceful protest. He scrawled a few notes before returning his attention to her.\n\n"And your husband is still in custody? Has he been charged?"\n\n"They won't tell me! They won't even let me see him, they just say he'll face trial soon. We don't have much since he was laid off, but I'll pay anything to see him released." Her face was stricken with fear, and she leaned forward in her chair, eyes pleading.\n\nRichard sighed. "That won't be necessary, Frau Schwarz. I'll take your husband's case pro bono." At her confused expression, he rephrased. "For free."\n\nFrau Schwarz's eyes teared up, and she exclaimed her thanks repeatedly. He did his best to hurry her along without seeming dismissive, and informed her she would receive his call soon. Once she was out of the door, he rubbed at his tired eyes. His practice had usually been busy, but this was beyond the pale. The violence the government was inflicting upon its own people was ludicrous - he'd forego his next meal if it meant ending wanton abuse by this foul regime. He'd tried to do his part with von dem Busche's little plot to kill Hitler back in the day, but if he couldn't bring them down by extralegal means, he'd resolved to do it by legal ones.

The number of demonstrators has been rapidly increasing over the past few days - my informants report that the demographic has changed from a majority of redundant working men to contain students, labourers, even housewives. There's communists, liberals, Reichsbanner - even the Hitler Youth has reported groups absconding to join the protests. Their demands range from handouts, to government sponsored housing to the complete replacement of the current regime." Gehlen's sunglasses concealed his eyes, but one could see the furrowed brow above them that indicated his worry. Speer wished he'd take the stupid things off just once.\n\nVon Tresckow raised his voice. "Wehrmacht units have been brought in to assist the Orpo, who are increasingly resorting to violence to suppress the riots. The protestors too are improvising weapons, and several dozen officers have already been murdered. Stocks of tear gas and rubber bullets are running low, however, and production has all but halted under the circumstances. If they aren't brought to heel soon, I worry that units might resort to using live rounds on the rioters."

It didn't do to publicly proclaim your appreciation for subversive literature. His works had even been smuggled out of the Reich, and apparently were highly acclaimed as subversive literature written by a subversive. He'd been proud. One could only be so proud of a work that did not even bear your name.\n\nHis underground activities had put him in contact with Reichsbanner, and he had wholeheartedly devoted himself to their cause, writing pamphlets and cyclicals, fomenting revolution from his desk. Yet still, his name was a secret, known only to a trusted few contacts within the organisation despite his writings spreading across the Reich from East to West. That was soon to change.\n\nOutside that door was one of Reichsbanner's journalists, and a cameraman.

Throughout the Baltic, Ukraine and Poland, Speer's yes-men and collaborators had dallied in dealing with the treason and it was consuming the once peaceful cities of the Reich, issuing demands for unearned rights or even the overthrow of the local National Socialist Party. Alexis von Roenne had instructed him to follow a similar course, allowing dissent to fester among the Slavs like a rot. Von Roenne had apparently not grasped that without propping up from Germania, he was a figurehead - the true power in Moskowien was concentrated in the hands of the men with the rifles.\n\nThe protestors had been allowed to concentrate in Friedrichsplatz, what the natives had once called Red Square. Schörner appreciated the irony. Thus far, he'd instructed that the protestors go unmolested, that as many of the rats would be drawn out as possible. To von Roenne's eyes, thus far he had complied with orders. Now it was time to dispossess him of his illusion of control.\n\nFerdinand nodded to the adjutant who had been lurking by the door, waiting for just such a signal. Upon the map, he had carefully marked a series of streets to be barricaded. Now that the protestors had been contained within the kettle, the barricades would be pushed forward.

The others were driven off either by security or party members forming into local militia, who have engaged in violent bouts with the rioters; multiple fatalities have been reported from both sides. Regretfully the Gau of Franken was not so lucky - before the Orpo performed a counterassault upon the building, the rioters succeeded in dragging him out, mutilating him and," Kiesinger's lip curled in distaste, "hanging him from a lamppost.

Speer snorted at Kiesinger's unnecessary diplomacy. "The Orpo have naturally taken a more hands-off approach to these militia, since they seem to be doing their jobs for them, which they in turn have taken as a license to perform their own retaliatory attacks.

Whilst the OKW had its fair share of dyed-in-the-wool Nazis, he'd always maintained a more pragmatic view of things. Him and his boys could sweep out Speer and his gang of squabbling reformists, lay a clean slate for some actual change. A firm hand was what they needed - just not one that wore a swastika armband. For all he knew these unrest would be what finally brought this house of cards assembled by lunatics finally tumbling down.

The economies of the eastern Pakt have been some of the hardest hit thus far, and the recently repatriated former slaves are proving especially difficult to keep a hand on.

Constant violence in the streets organised by Reichsbanner's stooges, blatant assaults on local Party headquarters prevented only by the brave efforts of loyal National Socialists.

Each displayed scenes of degeneracy and failure of a magnitude he could not comprehend. How could the Party have failed to this extent? At the time of Speer's victory, he had assumed the events to be a mere blip, that he would either be swiftly replaced by a more committed National Socialist or himself turn from his path of "reform". He had nonetheless remained, the machine of the Party only serving to shield him and his minions from deposition by appropriating the title of the first and only Führer. Indeed, he was more likely to see commitment to the ideals of National Socialism amongst his comrades within the Heer than with any so-called Hitlerite back in Germania. The Common Man's Revolution that had been promised was no closer to being delivered now than it was when the war was won.\n\nHe turned off the television and laced his fingers together.

Rolling her eyes and placing her book aside, Emilia stood up and went to help her ailing roommate, pulling the door open with little enough notice to cause poor Hannah to come stumbling through the door and drop one of the bags with a thump.\n\n"Heh, evening," Said Emilia as she knelt, hefting up the bag and inspecting its contents which, to her surprise, had not been shattered, crushed, spilled or cracked on impact respectively, "What's the news from the front? This looks like a lot more than we can usually get."\n\n"A lot better than you'd think!" Responded Hannah with a grin as she shuffled off toward the kitchen, grocery bag in tow, "Apparently the stamps are worth much more now, and I saw at least three people in there paying with real cash. Seems like more and more people are getting jobs and proper wages."\n\n"Must be those new factories. Maybe one of us should see about applying..." Emilia trailed off as she noticed something new in the bag, "Is this real steak?""

 speeroilcrisis.52.desc:0 "Jakob sat in his living room, resting in an armchair across from his television as he tried to ignore the shivering cold outside seeping in through his apartment's poorly insulated walls. The Führer was making an announcement today, so he had opted to struggle with the antennas until the old man's aging face manifested on the screen, striding up to his podium in the Volkshalle. Following that, Jakob promptly stood up and sunk into the armchair to see what he had to say.\n\nA chorus of 'Heils' could be heard as the crowd erupted into salutes, before simmering down in an instant as he tapped his microphone and began. "People of Germany, I bid you good evening. We live in a time of deep economic turmoil, but under the guidance of the party and through your Aryan grit, we recover. Still, aid is necessary in all functions of life, which is why I have decided to extend unemployment benefits for our proud Aryan citizens who have been sadly cast by the wayside..."\n\nA grin crossed Jakob's face as the old man continued his speech, leaning forward attentively to listen to the Führer's daunting list of measures to help people like him. He would be giving worth to food stamps to, as he puts it "fill the bellies of Aryans in poverty" and more cash in unemployment checks to "give the brave people on the streets and in the tenements a helping hand". Despite the rather offputting phrasing and rhetoric, Jakob still began to beam as he leaned back in his chair.\n\nHis eyes drifted across the room to a bottle of wine he'd been saving for a day when he could afford to drink, or a celebration where he could share it. This was a case of both, thought Jakob, as he hauled himself out of the seat, fetched a corkscrew, and popped the cork out of the bottle."

 speeroilcrisis.53.desc:0 "Ernst muttered under his breath as he maneuvered around the broken glass dashed across the street from the riot the previous night. His legs already ached from a long day on his feet at work, he didn't need any cuts or scrapes on the walk home. The sun was hanging just barely over the horizon now, and thus the glass in the street glimmered peach. The ripped and abandoned banners and picket signs were painted an orange akin to the Reichsbannes themselves, and the occasional splash of dried blood or wayward tooth looked almost noble under the dusky light of the destitute street.\n\nAfter a moment more walking, Ernst reached a door to his one story home a few lanes down from the carnage ridden trail he'd followed most of the way. Plunging his hand into his coat pocket, he plucked up his keys and turned the lock, opening the door and entering his living room with a relieved sigh. His wife, Olga, was waiting for him idly on the couch and stood up to greet him with a hug.\n\n"How was your first day?" She inquired cheerfully.\n\n"Eh, so-so. Glad to be back on the job." Said Ernst, loosening his tie and placing his briefcase on the ground, "Walk home wasn't much fun, though." He added as he clucked his tongue at his scuffed shoe.\n\n"Riot debris again?"\n\n"The very thing. I don't understand the motivation anymore, we've come so far, but they still fight. Starting to get more obnoxious than anything."\n\n"Well, they'll stop eventually. We just have to suffer through. Who knows what goes through those kids' heads these days, anyway?""

 speeroilcrisis.54.desc:0 "Otto flinched as another window shattered somewhere in the street, its shrill crack piercing the dull roar of the riots outside his home. The boy was hiding under his table, shivering and occasionally taking a glance at his mother, who was sitting in a considerably more calm state in one of the armchairs in the living room. "Come on, Otto, the closest fire's 5 blocks away." She said, beckoning the child out from his place under the table. Otto nodded, sulking his way out of the dining room, occasionally glancing towards the window to watch the protestors march through the streets, bellowing slogans and waving banners in a rather civil display compared to the rest of Essen.\n\n"When is it going to stop?" Asked Otto tearfully, earning an eye roll from his older sister, Heidi, sitting across from his mother.\n\n"To be truthful, I don't know. But soon." Replied his mother, after offering a chastising glare to Heidi, "I had figured they would simmer down earlier, what with the economy back on the rise - your father has a job, our neighbors have jobs and I'd bet a lot of people in that crowd have jobs."\n\n"Then why are they still marching?"\n\n"Because they're rabble rousers! All they want to do is cause trouble and make a fuss."\n\n"So for no reason?"\n\n"I can think of a reason or two-" Began Heidi, who was quickly cut off by their mother."

 SGR_the_sword_has_fallen_desc:0 "Out of nowhere, our administration has been completely blindsided by a slave uprising not seen in our Reich's history. Led by left wing students and revolutionaries, the Reichsbanner has torn a bloody gash down Eastern Europe, splitting the Reich in two.\n\nOn our side, the Gang and Speer enter into their final split on policy, the Gang pulling one way while the Führer pulls the other. Helmut Schmidt, leading the charge to agree to the slave demands, clashes directly with Albert Speer's own call to accept only the bare minimum, nothing more, and force them back into the fold. The Reichstag cracks in confusion and chaos, and the Reich lies helpless to respond.\n\nIn the East, Ferdinand Schörner has committed his final betrayal, splitting from the Reich with the promise to march west, crush the slaves, and complete his return as a hero to Germany. If the revolt is not dealt with before his invasion begins, our plans are surely doomed.\n\nThis very well could be the moment that decides Speer's Reich. Whether he maintains control or not, this is an event that will ring through all of European history forevermore. It is crucial that we do not fail."
 SGR_restoring_trust_desc:0 "Our situation is beginning to look grim. Civil agitation through our country is starting to boil over; continues dissatisfaction and dissent has eroded trust with our administration to a dangerous new low. If this trend continues, we will more than likely have a disaster on our hands.\n\nWe need to restore trust in our government at once! Make promises, give the people benefits; whatever we must do! We just need to restore a little faith in our administration."
 SGR_extend_the_olive_branch_desc:0 "Many of the folks marching in protest are civil, understanding, upstanding citizens of Germany, through and through. They aren't out to destroy the country; they merely want their voices to be heard. We should let these folks know that we really are listening; sitting down with the leaders of these marches and movements will communicate that we are reasonable, and all on the same side. We're all working for a better future for Germany."
 SGR_clear_the_trenches_desc:0 "Those who can discuss their grievances with us and a peaceful and civil manner are not the issue. Even the people who gather peacefully are not the root of our problems. It is the loud-mouths; those rabble-rousers who preach immedient, radical change and those that vandalize and riot! They are the issue. We need to make a list, check it twice, and round up the most vocal and violent of these 'protesters' so we can have a return to normalcy."
 SGR_reichspolizeigesetz_desc:0 "One of the core issues that has led us to where we are today is our use of our unified police, the Orpo. If we are going to convince the people that we are genuinely trying to reform, we need to address their complaints about our use of the police.\n\nTherefore, we will reform the Orpo into the Reichspolizei. This will be a fresh, clean start for our police agents. By being more transparent and sticking to newly written procedures, which will respect the rights of German citizens, we should be able to address one of the people's core problems with our administration."
 SGR_a_centralized_apparatus_desc:0 "The Orpo had the right idea; a centralized police force across our nation, headed by the Federal Government is the most efficient and effective way to police our nation.\n\nMany of our citizens don't like this approach. Part of the reason they are marching is to let them have more of a say over such matters. If this chaos has shown us anything, it has shown that we can not trust local governments or the people with such an institution. The Federal is in the right here."
 SGR_local_independence_desc:0 "Centralized police forces are causing a lot of friction all throughout Germany. Our direct oversight with the country's forces has upset most of our population one way or another. Many folks believe that they should have some say in who becomes chiefs of police, or who is allowed into the force. The people want more locals in their force as well; they wonder why we won't let them have a part in this process.\n\nAlthough handing over policing to the locals through our country will decrease our overall power projection, it may be a necessary evil we need to live with. A more hands off approach, akin to the police structure of the 1930s would put us in the good graces of many of our people."
 SGR_reichsschutzgruppe_desc:0 "Experience has taught us that we need a highly mobile, well trained and heavily armed police unit to deal with dangerous situations that the average policeman isn't ready to deal with.\n\nWe will put them under a regiment that would make an army man blush. These chosen few will be the cream of the crop of our police forces, trained in urban combat, close quarters combat, negotiation, hostage situations, and more."
 SGR_salvaging_the_economy_desc:0 "The global Oil Crisis has crippled our economy, and that's putting it lightly. We can not just continue without some sort of plan of action; we need to decide, and quickly, what our next course of action will be. We need to be quick and decisive if we are going to salvage what remains of our economy."
 SGR_all_the_money_in_the_world_desc:0 "Some within our administration have suggested that the first steps on the road to recover would be to strictly ration our oil until global prices lower and stabilize. These men are, of course, wrong.\n\nRationing petroleum would be detrimental to our economy. We can simply not afford to place limits on how much fuel a person or company can buy; the results would be devastating to our already hurt economy. Although it will cost us a great deal, the monetary costs will be worth it in the long run."
 SGR_strict_oil_rationing_desc:0 "Some of the more liberal leaning members of our country have proposed that the government should subsidize purchasing oil off the global market to keep meeting our demands. These bureaucrats are totally insane!\n\nThe cost of oil on the market is astronomical and outrageous! Our country would likely bankrupt itself if we attempted to subsidize our current levels of consumption; we simply don't have the capital to do this. We must instead resort to rationing; it will hurt our economy in the short term, but it is a better solution than destroying our economic future with such a heavy burden on our shoulders."
 SGR_energiesicherungsgesetz_desc:0 "By passing this bill, the Energy Insurance Act will guarantee that the other members of our economic pact will have access to affordable petroleum.\n\nThis is going to cost us; it won't be cheap to subsidize this fuel, but oil is absolutely vital to not only our own economy, but to all of the members in our economic sphere. If we are going to keep our economic pact together, then we must act."
 SGR_open_ports_desc:0 "It's time to fully commit to free trade. Doubling down on autarky will only hamper our economy. If we want recovery and growth, we need to encourage it! Stimulating global trade is the only way we will ever get the price of oil back to normal; not by doubling down on shutting down our foreign trade!"
 SGR_memories_of_autarky_desc:0 "Self dependence is truly the only way forward. Hitler wasn't right on many issues, but his vision was spot on in one regard; a strong, healthy Germany is one that relies on itself and no one else!\n\nBuying petroleum on the global market is what got us to this point in the first place! Why, then, would we double down and essentially gamble by throwing more money into foreign oil? It's madness, plain and simple. Germany must come first; we must relearn from the past and become self-dependent."
 SGR_the_plan_going_forward_desc:0 "Ludwig Erhard is nothing short of a genius. Without his feverous laboring and planning, our economy would be half of what it is today; our miraculous growth is a testament to his brilliance.\n\nErhard's economics is also what is currently killing the economy that we've worked so hard to build up since our Civil War. It is clear that we need to change course and come up with some kind of solution. The question is; what do we do? What changes now?"
 SGR_the_dream_come_true_fash_desc:0 "It is done. After years of wrestling with the Gang over the future of the Reich- and, by extension, Europe- the Führer has finally broken free of their restrictions. No more demands, no more reforms, no more whining- Speer has gotten his way, and nobody will stop him again.\n\nThey all tried so hard to rip the Reich to pieces, crying about the systems that kept it in power, scrabbling to tear apart the very structures that had elevated Germany to the status of world superpower with their liberal fantasies. Speer allowed them to grow complacent, thinking he was passive, and at the very moment when they thought their victory was complete- the Slave Revolt- he turned the tables.\n\nNow, Speer is alone at the top, with nobody to hold him back. All he needs now is to put the finishing touches on his masterpiece. Greater than the war economy, greater than the Volkshalle- this is how Speer will be remembered for all history."
 SGR_restoring_party_unity_desc:0 "The last decade has not been kind to the NSDAP. First, the Bürgerkrieg tore the Party to shreds, violently ripping the wings off of the German Eagle. Then, when Speer emerged victorious, the Party once again split- reactionaries attempting to undo every change Speer proposed on one side, dissenters who wished to bend to the capitalist's beck and call on the other. The reforms of the Gang have only exacerbated this problem, and the Slave Revolt nearly shattered the Party altogether. Urgent action is needed to stop this.\n\nIf Schmidt and his gang was in control, they would undoubtedly take action to break the Party up. We are not the Gang. We will do whatever is necessary to unite the Party behind Speer, and only Speer. Germany will not fail again."
 SGR_enforcing_government_unity_desc:0 "The Gang has been a roadblock in the way of real progress ever since Speer gained power. They constantly have tried to push the bar further and further, well beyond the bounds of common sense and reason. As long as we have been in power, they have done their utmost to stymie Speer's efforts to create a Reich that both works without betraying what makes it the Reich. This cannot remain the case.\n\nThese men- Erhard, Schmidt, Kiesinger, and Tresckow- have long outlived their usefulness. They shall be given a choice- bow to the party line, or get out of the way. Whether their sense or their beliefs will prevail remains a mystery, but one way or another, Speer will not be challenged."
 SGR_gleichschaltung_forevermore_desc:0 "Due to the Gang's traitorous behavior, the idea of a Reich with free democracy has become an increasingly popular idea among the youth. These rebellious knaves are the same as the ones Speer used to take power all those years ago- still as rebellious, still as foolish, still as blinded by their goggles as they were in 1963. Their delusions will not be coddled- no, accepted- any longer.\n\nThere is one party, there is one Führer, and there is one Reich. This is not a democracy. This is not a nation which will bend over backwards for Judeo-Bolsheviks and western pigs alike. We are Germany! We have stood as the power of Europe for years before, and with Speer's well placed reforms, we shall stand as the power of Europe for the rest of time!"
 SGR_ein_volk_desc:0 "The youth, as they have been for the last decade, are unhappy with Speer's way of doing things. Apparently, they thought that the Führer was pleased to give in to the Gang's fantasies. As is tradition, they've decided to raise hell. This time, however, will be different.\n\nThe government no longer cares for these brats. Let them scream as long as they like. The people, by and large, will be behind the Führer. National Socialism is the path forward for Germany, and it would do our people much good to remember that. Every good German man will be proud to call himself a Nazi. They shall wear the swastika with pride, and Germany will turn back towards its bright future."
 SGR_ein_reich_desc:0 "What is a Slav? A man? A human being, living and breathing, as we Aryans do? Or nothing more than an Untermensch, no more worthy than a good dog or abnormally productive than a cow? Schmidt and his gang may argue the former, but any good Aryan knows the truth. The Slav- and by extension, Eastern Europe- serves no purpose other than to serve the Aryan man. They are not slaves because we care for them, they are not slaves because the slave system only served to hinder Germany. It would be prudent to remind our people of this.\n\nUntil the Slav proves that he can lead himself into the future rather than drag the rest of Europe down- something which seems quite unlikely- the Reich will take the lead in this endeavor. Even if we must take them kicking and screaming, we will take them, and they will work for a Europe free of the stain of Judeo-Bolshevism."
 SGR_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Germany is safe from western influence and Bolshevik thought alike- for now. The battle, of course, is not yet finished. The sharks of liberalism and communism still circle the waters surrounding our boat, itching for the moment they believe they can strike. With the Gang at the helm, they very nearly had their chance.\n\nThe captain has reasserted his command. Albert Speer is ready to lead Germany into the future it truly deserves- one not of subservience to the Slav, or the Jew, or the capitalist, but one of leadership and power. A world in which the Reich once again dominates, a world in which the National Socialist dream can come true. The challenges on this path may be many, but we shall weather the storm, secure in our knowledge that National Socialism will keep us safe through the raging waters, now and forevermore."
 SGR_the_dream_come_true_auth_desc:0 "The impossible has happened. Helmut Schmidt has won out. In the greatest game of geopolitical cards ever played, Speer and Schmidt have dueled on the world stage, and Schmidt has emerged victorious-bloodied, battered, and bruised, but unquestionably victorious. With his negotiations with the Revolt a total success, and the Reich bent irreversibly towards the Gang's way of thinking, there seems to be no direction but up for the German reformists.\n\nWhere does Germany go from here? Who knows? Never before has so much power in the Reich been held in the hands of men like Schmidt, Erhard, Kiesinger, and Tresckow. With Speer relegated to figurehead status, the future has been blown wide open for a gentler, understanding, democratic Reich- one ready to finally ditch its dark past for the glory of the modern world.\n\nOne thing is certain - if the citizens of Germany thought that they'd seen an incredible amount of reform before, they haven't seen anything yet."
 SGR_the_house_of_cards_falls_desc:0 "The NSDAP has never been a particularly stable party, but the last years have been especially chaotic, even by their standards. Though the level of discontent is obviously nowhere near the levels seen on the verge of the Bürgerkrieg, it is an undeniable fact that the party is splintering once again- the Dissenters are finally beginning to fully split from the Reformist and Reactionary wings of the party. If Speer was in charge, this would be an unmitigated disaster- one to be solved with extreme prejudice.\n\nHowever, Speer is not in charge. It more than suits our interests for the party to split- if anything, it would do us much good to hasten the breakup. The sooner the old party bureaucracy is out of the way, the better."
 SGR_the_shadow_government_desc:0 "In all but name, the Gang of Four controls the reins of power in Germany. Speer's role has been crushed down to only the most ceremonial duties, a mere figurehead to the powers behind the scenes. However, Albert Speer is still the Führer. It is theoretically possible that he could stage a return to power- something he is undoubtedly plotting, giving the more than negative nature of the Gang's takeover.\n\nIn order to cut him off before he even gets the chance to try and return, we shall strengthen our position with important members of the Reich's bureaucracy that hold similar ideals as we do. If we are able to dominate the upper levels of government with men who dislike Albert Speer as much as the Gang, there will be no danger of him ever returning to real prominence."
 SGR_contact_popular_movements_desc:0 "The Gang's solidification of power is not merely contained to the inner Party bureaucracy. Outside of the Party, the shift in the Reich's policy has drawn all sort of dissenter's interests, seemingly intrigued by this new course that the Gang has set out. These dissenters, along with the previously mentioned allies in the upper ranks of the Reich, may be able to provide valuable legitimacy and credible ideas.\n\nAs such, a semi-formal conference has been scheduled to take place in Frankfurt, the center of movements for German democracy since the 1800's. With numerous big names invited to appear, this conference may set the course for the next stage of the Reich. It is for the best that we prepare."
 SGR_einigkeit_desc:0 "There's no easy way to put it- the Reich is dying. The systems that the German people have known and trusted for decades, despite their cruel, oppressive natures, are finally being torn down. Such a rapid shift, even after the years of reform instituted before the Slave Revolt, has thrown the people into a river of change without the knowledge of how to swim. They are scared, confused, and alone- something that we cannot allow to become the national mood, lest a tide of reactionary sentiment sweep us back out the door.\n\nWe shall be the angels to these shepherds, taking their hands and leading them in a unified, caring front into the future, past the gruesome history we've worked so hard to get away from. We shall take them to our own Bethlehem, where finally, a free Germany awaits us, and they will not be afraid. A new era is nearly at hand, and it is our duty to bring the German people to it."
 SGR_recht_desc:0 "The German people have been deprived of many, many things since 1933, but perhaps the most important one is justice. For decades, Nazi officials have gotten away with some of the most heinous crimes possible. Corruption, treason, murder, a thousand other acts that would put any average citizen in a penal labor camp for the rest of their days- all waved away, simply because of the armband these men proudly wore. Now, it is time to turn the tables on them.\n\nPerhaps it is poetic that many of the most important figures that stand in the way of freedom and democracy are blatant criminals. One could certainly find meaning in that. However, we are not looking for poetic metaphors- we are looking for the hand of the law to finally come crashing down on these traitor's heads. The judge's gavel will be the primary weapon of our new legal war, and these men will face justice for the acts that they have committed against so many."
 SGR_freiheit_desc:0 "Freedom is a long and bloody road, especially for a nation with autocracy as baked into its culture as Germany. The German people are used to having a strongman, whether Hitler or Speer, direct their nations for them, crush their freedoms in the name of their supposed "safety" or "self-interest". These were all fascist lies, and now the chance has come to cut the cancer out and replace it with a free, democratic Reich.\n\nIt will not be perfect- Lord knows how many times Erhard, Schmidt, Kiesinger, and Tresckow have erred. There will be rough patches, as there always are. Sacrifices will need to be made. It will not be an easy road away from the siren of fascism, but the light at the end of the tunnel- a Germany where all are free and equal, no longer forced to fear their government- is enough to keep the Gang toiling. They will toil until they drop, or until their dream is achieved.\n\nThere is much work to be done, and the Gang is ready to do it."
 SGR_a_new_era_desc:0 "Germany is undergoing yet another visible change; one of many that it has already experienced this century.\n\nThe Oil Crisis, combined with the great Slave Revolt has shown us that our model of governance is outdated. Germany is running its nation and aligned partners like the great powers of the Victorian Era ran their personal spheres of influence. Our model is hopelessly outdated.\n\nThe last two back to back crisis has proved without a doubt that we can not simply ignore the rest of the world. Like it or not, but if we are to retain our status as an influential and great power, we need to be able to work with others; not as a superior or overlord, but as equals. International cooperation is the way forwards."
 SGR_an_example_in_the_west_desc:0 "The Americans have something going for them with the OFN. Although the member nations of that organization are little more than the United States' pawns, their organization and willingness to cooperate with each other is unparalleled when compared to our Pakt or Japan's Sphere. While their alliance is nowhere near perfect, there are many lessons to be learned by observing them and how they interact with each other."
 SGR_time_for_change_desc:0 "The Oil Crisis definitely has had a lasting effect on the global market. Nations seem to be more hesitant in their overseas purchases, which is making relations and connections with foreign interests more important than ever. If Germany is going to move into the future, then we need to adapt if we wish to remain relevant as a world power."
 SGR_a_hint_in_the_east_desc:0 "The Japanese are the perfect example of a crumbling, decaying empire.\n\nTheir golden age, if one can even call their exploitation of Asia 'golden' has long since passed. The Japanese government is decaying, and their army and navy only keeps their Sphere together thanks to their impressive firepower.\n\nThe Japanese compose themselves like a bunch of thugs. They are the perfect enemy for the world to unite against. Not since the 30s has such a prime target offered itself to be the world's boogieman, and for once, it's not us."
 SGR_prime_the_ambassadors_desc:0 "It is time to unveil our new foreign policy to the world. We will release a statement to all of our diplomats overseas; the time of German isolation has ended.\n\nThe future of Germany, and by extension, the world, relies on cooperation. It's time to make our ambassadors prove their worth; their mission?\n\nThe mission is surprisingly simple.

Dozens upon dozens of names alone are floating around in our Foreign Affairs office, as well as more than a few ideas about what the structure of such an organization will look like.\n\nInspiration from the League of Nations, the short lived "United Nations" and other historic suggestions is evident in many of these proposals. While most of the ideas are just that; proposals, it's exciting to see how eager and motivated not only our people, but foreigners are to create another international organization!"

It's not a mere novel idea; practical experiences from the League of Nations and United Nations have been taken to help us create this new organization, or 'Koalition.'\n\nDifferent boards for maximum flexibility, a pathway to membership, a parliament, and much, much more! Although in its infancy on paper, the idea has many people in our administration hopeful for the future. It's time to test the waters and let the Japanese and Americans in on our plans. As the next two largest superpowers, their input and support will be vital to making this dream a reality."

 speer.1.t:0 "Speer Is Victorious"
 speer.1.desc:0 "From the steps of the Reichstag today, Speer has announced that he has finally secured his place as the Führer of Germany. Armed soldiers from the 6th Panzer Division and hundreds of armed militia fighters who had taken him to Germania surrounded the Reich's new leader as he announced he would be bringing Germany into a new era of prosperity and enlightenment.\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands filled the streets in celebration for their new leader and an end to the most bloody conflict Germany has ever become embroiled in, some skirmishes still continue across the nation as the followers of Speer's enemies have refused to give up the fight, despite their losses, refusing to accept Speer as their next leader. Still, Speer's speech has reached acclaim, not only in Germany, as it has become the most televised broadcast in our nation in decades, but around the world as well.\n\n"It is not enough to dream of a strong Germany. We must believe in a strong Germany. We must strive for a strong Germany. We will shine a light in the dark, and be a beacon for our children and their children, as they remember us as the ones who made a strong, brave, beautiful new world for them to inherit.""

 speer.3.t:0 "Students Rising Up In Support!"
 speer.3.desc:0 "To assist us in our valiant fight against the treacherous opposition, lead by Hermann Göring, Reinhard Heydrich, and Martin Bormann, students across Germany have risen up and taken arms to defend democratic and morally correct rights. It is imperative that we garner the support of the students, for their help is much needed against the ruthless and perseverant SS divisions possessed by Heydrich and the well trained armed forces units possessed by both Göring and Bormann.\n\nThe support of the students will, in fact, be a great boon for us as, while they are not a professional fighting force, they can tie up the resources of our enemies, which will lead us one step closer to victory..."

 speer.6.desc:0 "The war is over. Bormann, Göring and Heydrich have each been forced to escape the country as their supporters have been broken and their bases fallen before Speer's mix of leftists, liberals and the sensible peoples of Germany. Only one obstacle still stands to Speer taking power in the nation, and that is Speidel and his men in Germania. Still untouched by the war, Germania has remained relatively alive during this disaster, and Speidel, and his former commander turned second, Rommel, have been hailed as heroes for saving the city in the face of this conflict.\n\nNow, all that is needed is for them to stand down and allow Speer and his supporters to enter the city, a crucial last step. Whether they will stand down willingly or not, however, is up to them."

 speer.7.t:0 "Speidel Surrenders!"
 speer.7.desc:0 "There was some tension in war-torn Germany while Speer's supporters and the populace of Germania both awaited news of whether or not Speidel would allow his entrance into the city. A collective sigh of relief answered, however, when it was announced that Speidel and Rommel's men would not protest Speer's entrance in the city and gave the soldiers guarding it their first stand down order since the war had begun.\n\nSoon, Speer will ride to the Reichstag personally to announce his victory, and celebrations have already broken out across Germania as cheering crowds have mingled with the finally off duty soldiers, lifting them on shoulders to every pub and beerhall in the city. While the war hasn't spared Germania completely, and supplies are scarce, it seems that the people have enough spare to truly celebrate the occasion."

 # Anti-Heydrich Pact
 speer.16.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 speer.16.d:0 "Four men entered the battle for Germany's future, but most only thought there were three true contenders- Bormann, Göring, and Speer. The fourth, Heydrich, was widely seen as nothing more than a doomed breakaway, with no public support, little Heer support, and disconnected territory. Most discarded his candidacy from the start- certainly someone would crush him fast, and the nightmare would be over.\n\nUnfortunately, events have not gone the way we have expected. Heydrich is quickly gaining speed and momentum, and most recognize him as a real threat to take over Germany, despite the resistance of most of the people. As much as we hate our fellow competitors, we can all agree- Heydrich cannot be allowed to take control of the Reich, for he will certainly bring nothing but death and destruction to it.\n\nAs such, we have invited our challengers to a conference to negotiate a temporary "Anti-Heydrich Pact"- built not as a perfect solution to the Bürgerkrieg, but as a means to stop Heydrich before he becomes too powerful for us to contain."

He has refused to enter a ceasefire, claiming that "His Heer will do the job much quicker and cleaner than your student mob ever could." Ignoring the unsurprising hostility, it seems that Bormann will not enter a ceasefire.\n\nThis throws a wrench into our hopes of defeating Heydrich easily- though we can hope that our armies will defeat Heydrich while simultaneously locked in combat with each other, it will certainly be a challenge."

 speer.18.t:0 "Göring Refuses"

Claiming that "The Heer does not need the aid of students to defeat the SS", Göring has made it beyond clear that any hope of collaboration between our two factions is off the table.\n\nThis is quite a disappointing turn of events- though we are confident in our army's ability to defeat Heydrich on its lonesome, it would certainly be much simpler if we could work with Göring to do it. We will have to face down the Blonde Beast while fighting with each other, it seems."

 speer.28.t:0 "The Modern Woman"
 speer.28.d:0 "As the Orpo carefully watched on, the Grand Plaza before the Reichstag was today occupied as over fifty thousand members of the League of German Mothers descended on Germania in protest against our regime. Immediately drawing the attention of the media, the cameras have come to quickly focus on the young, charismatic rising star of the organization: Holdine Goebbels.\n\nThe embodiment of their perfect woman, with blonde hair and her mothers beauty, dressed in her League of German Girls leadership uniform Holdine addressed the crowd. In a calm, conducted, yet vicious speech Holdine condemned 'Mister Speer' for his decision to abolish the Mother's Cross of Honour, claiming it but the latest in a series of unacceptable attacks against the German woman.\n\nThe speech was disrupted however as counter-protestors from the liberal feminist movement stormed onto the Plaza, wearing chains and chanting 'Slaves!' over and over, leaders declaring that this was the German woman the League desired. When the Orpo stepped in to prevent a violent clash between the two sets of protestors, controversy has exploded as when an arriving Orpo police car backfired, mimicking a gunshot, Holdine Goebbels slapped an Orpo officer who suddenly grabbed her, the microphone broadcasting that 'the Aryan woman does not need some man to protect her'."

 speer.29.t:0 "The Aryan-Feminist Movement Declared"
 speer.29.d:0 "In the wake of the recent League of German Women protest march in Germania, the nation has become consumed in heated debate over the rightful role of women within German society. Having found herself the center of the debate, Holdine Goebbels has become the most controversial women in the Reich overnight after publicly slapping an Orpo officer and declaring that the Aryan woman does not need a mans protection.\n\nWith violent clashes erupting in cities across Germany between conservative and liberal groups on the debate, fresh fuel has been thrown onto the fire today as Holdine utterly shocked both sides of the movement. Having attracted a core group of young dissatisfied German women to her leadership in chaos of the debate, Holdine publicly announced the formation of the Aryan-Feminist Movement.\n\nWhilst remaining strongly in the camp of National Socialism, the former poster girl of the Party delivered a fiery manifesto calling for total equality between men and women. According to the movement, Aryan women are as much warriors as Aryan men, capable of defending themselves and making their own decisions, with both genders providing an equally important role in the Reich and thus deserving of equal rights, even with the traditional gender roles being respected 'for the good of society'. The manifesto has drawn outrage from both sides of the debate, with demands for Holdine's Party membership to be revoked immediately."

Albert Speer, famous for his reformist rhetoric and base of popularity largely being with the student movement that has recently cropped up in the Reich, has requested that we send him and his forces help in the form of volunteers and caches of weapons. If we are to help him, it would increase his chances of winning the Civil War. The question, however, is if we wish to aid any faction within the Civil War whatsoever. While Speer is a reformist, there is a possibility that he will still remain unfriendly to our regime, and the political legwork necessary to help him would be all for naught. We must make our decision now."

We've received a shipment of weapons from [FROM.GetName], as well as a significant manpower boost in form of volunteers. We will make good use of both men and equipment - pushed to the front, they shall be used to speed up our victory, and in the end, make the difference between victory and defeat. Heil Speer!"

Knowing that we have extensive military knowledge, they have asked us to send over some of our more experienced advisors to help them in winning against the opposing forces. However, are we certain we want to help one of the Nazi factions? While Speer's regime is the most likely one to be friendly to the U.S. and the OFN, they are unlikely to win, as well as the fact that it would be politically expensive to convince House and Congress to be on-board with the idea. Not only that, the people likely be unhappy that we would be openly supporting a fascist regime, even if it could be a potentially major boon for us.\n\nWhat do we do?"

Now we must put these men to work - though we're not necessarily planning to adopt American-style tactics or strategy on a large-scale, it is a painful truth that their army is more in touch with present day military doctrine than ours. We shall put these advisors to work immediately."
 speer.163.a:0 "Time to crack the whip."

The moderate diplomat, known for his pro-American stance, asks for support in the conflict, offering in exchange to grant our country a favorable position in diplomatic relationships once the war is over.\n\nWhile we are under no obligation to help their side, several advisors to the President agree that helping Speer win against his opponents would mean having a chance at normalization. Even more, they point out that all others, especially Göring and Heydrich, would pose an immediate and dire threat to America, and perhaps to the world as a whole. What should we do?"

 speer.200.t:0 "The Nuremberg Speech"
 speer.200.d:0 ""My people - sons and daughters of Germany. The trials we have faced over the past three decades have been greater than anything faced by any other nation in history. Never before has an empire defeated so many foes and risen to such heights, only to be laid low again in such a short period of time. Since the passing of our beloved Führer, our suffering has only increased with each passing day. Thirty years ago, none could possibly have imagined that such privation and misery would befall the German people - yet, here we stand, knee-deep in the blood of our own kin."\n\n"How could it have come to this? How could we, the most noble and brotherly of nations, tear ourselves apart so suddenly and violently? The answer is plain for the rest of the world to see, but we ourselves have been blinded by petty rivalries and the stagnation of our glory. Germany: we failed. We failed to see the writing on the wall, to accept that the old ways served us no longer. We failed to remember that National Socialism is a movement of the people - not a rigid, dogmatic tool of bureaucrats, militarists and purist fanatics!"\n\n"People of Germany, we cannot - will not - return to the same path that led us to the brink of destruction once before. The time has come for change - change we can believe in! National Socialism and its representatives must serve the people first, and I swear that it shall! No more will you be asked to die for reasons you do not understand. No more will you be deprived of your bread by a faceless, stone-hearted bureaucrat. No more will the black stain of fanaticism be welcome in our great nation. The People's War is ended - now begins the People's Reich! Sieg heil!""

 speer.201.t:0 "The Humanitarian Crisis"
 speer.201.d:0 "Though the war is over, still the Fatherland suffers. To speak of 'the scars of war' is erroneous; Germany is rent apart, with the lifeblood of the nation dripping endlessly from gruesome, gaping wounds. To deal only with scars would be a comparative luxury. Instead, we find ourselves cleaning up after one of the worst civil wars in European history. Not since the 30 Years' War has Germany been so thoroughly devastated and deprived.\n\nIn every city, lines of citizens awaiting their rations stretch for block after block. Electricity is still completely cut off in several large areas, rendering much of our infrastructure useless and communication across the nation impossible. In regions where the fighting was most intense, even running water is a rarity. Living standards were already low before the Bürgerkrieg - now they are virtually nonexistent.\n\nTo alleviate this unprecedented humanitarian crisis, the Führer and his government have greenlit the immediate distribution of stored supplies to the people. Anything the military has no use for will also be bundled into this aid package. Food, water, medicine, fuel - if it has value and is not a weapon, the people need it. Of all the tragedies to befall Germany, none could possibly surpass our current situation. Enough of this nonsense talk of austerity and Spartanism; Germany cries out for salvation, and the Führer will deliver it unto them no matter the opposition, such is his love for the people."
 speer.201.a:0 "Thank you, my Führer."
 speer.202.t:0 "Show Their Crimes"
 speer.202.d:0 "Though their followers have been killed, imprisoned or brought to heel, the legacies of Bormann, Göring and Heydrich remain, knives in Germany's back. In time, as their supporters are converted or weeded out, these painful memories will fade - but perhaps that's not enough. All of these claimants to the Führership commanded immense respect and popularity among the populace. Exposing their dealings and crimes through state media and public testimony would be a wise move, but attempting to discredit all of them at once would arouse suspicion.\n\nBormann's conservatism, ruthlessness and devotion to Nazism represented the total anathema of what Speer's supporters stand for. He spent much of the past three decades spreading his poison, infecting most of the NSDAP. Rooting out this rot from the Party would go a long way towards decreasing internal resistance to reform. Bormann was always careful to operate within the bounds of the law, but still inspired fear and hatred in many of his subordinates; now that he is gone, they might be more willing to testify against his memory.\n\nGöring had always enjoyed wide popular support due to his status as a war hero, but the greater threat by far is his former support base in the Wehrmacht. Owing to our great victories in the Second World War, the Wehrmacht remains a defining part of German culture and society. Still, their militarism is a clear and present danger to the Reich, serving only to turn yet more nations against us. Thankfully, Göring has a long record of illicit financial activities - activities that would ruin his reputation if they were to be exposed.\n\nFinally, there is Heydrich. The SS might be widely loathed, but Heydrich himself managed to retain a positive image following the West Russian War due to Hitler's high opinion of him, his reputation for decisiveness and his Spartan discipline. Obviously, admiration for him might quickly morph into admiration for Himmler, and we cannot afford to have Burgundian fifth columnists active in Germany. Exposing him while memories of the war are still fresh in peoples' minds could destroy any pro-SS sentiments for good.\n\nWhom shall we bury in history?"

Had he been more alert, he might have realized that the armed men outside his door were Gestapo officers possessed of absolute loyalty to the new Führer. Gagged, blindfolded, cuffed, and unceremoniously bundled into the back of a waiting car, Lorenz had struggled and thrashed all the way from his home to the Special Court set up in the local NSDAP headquarters.\n\nWhen he was thrown into a cold steel chair before a known Speerite judge, Lorenz finally comprehended his predicament. His bindings removed, he loudly and insistently proclaimed his innocence in the few seconds before someone struck him over the head with a truncheon. He recovered just in time to hear the verdict: "In accordance with the Führer's directives, this court finds you guilty of treason, homosexuality, and Bolshevik sympathies. The sentence is death."\n\nHauled from the Special Court by balaclava-wearing guards, none present would ever forget Lorenz' screamed protests as he was dragged out behind the court, put up against a brick wall and shot twice in the head with a P38. Thus began the Great Purge, and the end of the Reich's fifth columnists."

 speer.204.t:0 "The Erhard Plan"
 speer.204.d:0 ""What's this? You want to change our price controls?" Speer raised a skeptical eyebrow as he glanced at Erhard over the top of his proposal sheet.\n\nErhard shook his head and plucked a fat cigar from between his lips. "No, my Führer. Read it again - I don't want to change them, I want to abolish them. Price controls have never prevented inflation, and the black markets have been sucking the life out of our commercial sector for over ten years. We aren't going to dig ourselves out of his hole if we keep rejecting sensible free-market principles on... well, principle."\n\nSpeer was silent for a moment, eyebrows furrowing as he squinted at the tiny text more closely. Erhard shifted in his chair and replaced his cigar, taking a deep, satisfied puff. Suddenly, Speer's eyes stopped flicking back and forth - then widened. "Reset the Reichsmark? Are you telling me we should..."\n\n"Withdraw it from circulation. All of it. Then issue new notes and coins. The first batch is ready for distribution already, and banks in East Prussia and the Rhineland are prepared to start accepting the old currency. It will - let me finish, my Führer - give our citizens the purchasing power they've lacked ever since the crash in the 50's. Once the OFN embargo ends..."\n\nSpeer looked equal parts intrigued and mortified. "What do you mean the emb-"\n\nErhard flicked away the stub of his cigar. "You ARE planning to end the embargo, aren't you? Haven't you already spoken with Schmidt about this?"\n\n"Yes, but not-"\n\n"Good. The sooner imports start up again, the sooner we'll see quality of life begin to increase. I assure you, my Führer, that you will see progress not a day after that embargo is lifted." Erhard rose to his feet with a groan of exertion and gathered up his papers. "Now, I really must be going, my Führer. I have a dozen bankers and five CEOs to meet with before the day is out." With a lazy salute, and an almost-forgotten "Heil!", Erhard was gone, leaving Speer with a book-sized proposal and far too many numbers for his liking."
 speer.204.a:0 "Quite the character..."
 speer.205.t:0 "Not This Time"
 speer.205.d:0 "It has been many years since German wives have been seen carrying full bags of groceries home - so long, in fact, that the sight of such made headline news across the Reich. In homes throughout Germany, families have been busying themselves clearing out unused cupboards to make room for weeks' worth of food. Once, a purse full of marks would barely feed one person for a day, let alone five. Now, the same amount of money can feed a family for a fortnight or more. One has yet to hear parents scolding their children for over-stuffing themselves, given that activity has quickly become a favorite pastime of the long-deprived German masses.\n\nFood is not the only thing Germans find themselves truly enjoying once more; electronics, cars and luxury goods have all become much more affordable. Many a household has recently been graced with a new television, while pedestrian congestion has greatly easy as the number of citizens owning private transport has increased massively. Petrol companies, in particular, are quite pleased with this development. Businesses big and small are finally turning a profit, and some semblance of prosperity is returning to the least devastated parts of the Reich.\n\nThis upturn must not be overstated, however, as Erhard constantly reminds the Führer. While many citizens have risen above the poverty line, many more remain beneath it, lacking the means to actually benefit from the renewed Reichsmark. Charity can only achieve so much, and there remains much to do if Speer hopes to elevate the working classes from their depression."
 speer.205.a:0 "It's a start."
 speer.206.t:0 "The Schmidt Proposal"
 speer.206.d:0 "Helmut Schmidt entered the Führer's office with a slightly timid "Heil!" and a rather hasty salute, looking suspiciously out of practice to Speer's eyes. Here, then, was the man who would redeem the Reich on the world stage; an impossible task to many, but not to one as ambitious as Speer.\n\nSpeer was careful to shake Schmidt's hand before the two sat, smiling slightly as he did so. "Schmidt," he said warmly. "Good to finally greet you somewhere more appropriate. The Chancellery meeting rooms aren't nearly secure enough, are they?"\n\nSchmidt nodded and smiled nervously at the implication. Certainly, there were more than a few men in the Party who would happily burst in waving a pistol if they knew the extent of what the Gang of Four was planning. Still, he said nothing, prompting Speer to clear his throat and lean forwards, looking distinctly businesslike. "Now, Schmidt - I understand you have an outline for dealing with our present diplomatic situation. I'm sure you're aware that we've already seen some positive developments on that front, but Erhard believes that we need something concrete to show our good intentions to the world."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," replied Schmidt, quickly composing himself. "Ah, a sort of 'whirlwind tour', as the Americans say. Straight to every capital that matters right now: Washington, Rome, Ankara, Tokyo, and so on. I'd undertake this myself, of course, since I'm an unknown quantity and can make a fresh impression on our old friends. The Pakt can wait, and obviously China, India and so on aren't priorities right now. Is this agreeable, my Führer?"\n\nSpeer nodded and smiled - genuinely, this time. "Excellent work, Schmidt. We're of two minds, clearly." The Führer rose from his seat, the sign that his Foreign Minister had the stamp of approval and was dismissed. "Let me know when you're planning to depart, and make sure you keep myself and the cabinet up to date on your progress. I leave the rest up to you. Best of luck, Helmut.""

Our Foreign Minister, Helmut Schmidt, was not received warmly as a representative of an OFN nation might have been, but the fact that there was no passive hostility on the President's part is surely a good sign. Schmidt was all smiles - no doubt a strange sight to many Americans after decades of hostile relations between our two countries.\n\nThe real coup Schmidt scored during his visit was an address to the Senate. Initial fears on our part were quickly allayed when a recording was delivered to Germany for broadcast on state television. He began with: "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your most cordial reception and kind words of greeting." A standard diplomatic opening, but Schmidt's warmth of voice and character made clear his sincerity. He went on to say: "This is my first expedition as Foreign Minister of the Greater German Reich, and I must express my admiration for the authority and dignity that this great nation displays in every action and every hour of its existence."\n\nSchmidt's schedule did not permit a tour of major cities as he initially requested before setting out, but the Führer was doubtful that such a request would be granted by the Americans anyway. Considering we nuked them only twenty years ago, Schmidt's visit has been a resounding success and a great diplomatic victory for the Reich."

 speer.208.d:0 "Helmut Schmidt's diplomatic adventure continues, with visits to Rome, Ankara, Madrid, Stockholm, and Helsinki. The Reich's image has suffered immensely in Europe - not merely because of the war, but also due to the economic crash that killed much of the continent's economy and plunged our trading partners into depression. The ready visibility of the Bürgerkrieg and the less admirable aspects of Hitler's reign have made us a pariah despite being the unquestioned ruler of Northern and Eastern Europe.\n\nSchmidt could never hope to repair our image in a single trip, but the first steps towards a long-needed thaw in relations have finally been taken - something Hitler would never have deigned to attempt. No doubt many of our neighbours question whether this move towards openness and cordiality is genuine. Such a lack of trust is unfortunate, but more than understandable, as our Führer put it to the Reichstag.\n\nStill, the importance of this diplomatic defensive operation cannot be understated. We have been isolated for decades, feared and loathed as an 'evil empire' of the north... like something out of a fantasy novel! Hopefully, Europe will begin to recognize our good intentions in time - as well as overlook anything they don't like about us in the name of Realpolitik."

Our alliance in the Tripartite Pact was born of little more than convenience and deterrence against the United States, which became moot once the Japanese declared war on them and Hitler dragged us into it. As a rival fascist power, the Japanese naturally see us as a threat and a challenge to their rule - never mind the fact that our spheres of influence barely overlap at all. Our recent friendly overtures towards their arch-enemy may actually have made this enmity even worse.\n\nStill, Schmidt had a job to do, and performed it admirably given the circumstances. Welcomed to the Diet by the Prime Minister - though snubbed by the Emperor - he made an impassioned speech calling for an end to 'senseless rivalry' and for the Japanese to 'recognize our goodwill and peaceful intentions towards the Empire of Japan'. He was met with polite, if somewhat muted applause. To be expected, of course, but at least he wasn't given the silent treatment.\n\nThe Führer remains skeptical that relations with the Japanese will ever be normalized, but this was a necessary step to take in our journey towards a positive image on the world stage. If we cannot be seen as willing to reconcile with even our most vicious rival, we will never be trusted as a global actor."

They're... well, they're normal."\n\nSpeer chewed his lip, looking a little skeptical. "Hmm. True, but they won't stop trying to subvert our interests. Don't forget that we've been on hostile terms for decades now, and that history won't go away just because you enjoyed some applause while you were over there."\n\n"I know, my Führer," Schmidt replied with a slightly offended edge to his voice. "But they also operate in a manner we're more than familiar with, and our two societies are more alike than they are different. The Japanese, though? Trying to build normal relations with them, even if it's not totally futile, might just make them more confident in their own broken system. Can you imagine if we got dragged into another war because of them? If you ask me, we should keep them at arm's length, my Führer."\n\nSpeer nodded and scratched his chin. "Yes, I understand, but still... the Japanese still match the Americans in their military might. Isn't there some value in a deterrent?"\n\n"Deterrent? My Führer, forgive my frankness, but we already have a deterrent - it's called our nuclear arsenal. Conventional armies don't have the clout that they used to. Trust me, Erhard is right; the economic benefits of trade with the United States will far outweigh anything the Japanese can offer, and we can't be seen to associate with the Japanese if they take a turn towards aggression again."\n\n"I have already made the decision, Schmidt," Speer remarked, relaxing a little. "Don't fret. Tell your men at the foreign office to get to work, and contact Erhard too. We still have a long way to go before we start seeing Fords on the Autobahn.""

"My Führer, the Japanese don't have anything to offer us. The Americans have so much more that would benefit our economy."\n\nSpeer took a long time to reply. He stood from his desk and wandered over to the window, gazing out across the concrete skyline he had shaped decades ago. "I know, Schmidt," he finally said, not turning back to look at his subordinate. "But I'm not thinking merely of the economy. The United States won't stop their covert activities against us just because of a few trade deals. We need a substantial counterbalance to their military."\n\nSchmidt sputtered. The sound of his chair scraping against the polished floor as he stood upright stung the Führer's ears. "We have a nuclear arsenal that could flatten every city in North America and then some! Adding Japan's stockpile to that won't help to ease global tensions, Speer!"\n\nThe Führer's face darkened at the mention of his name in anger. "I've made my decision, Schmidt, and you had your tour. We can still have normal relations with the Americans, just not... not the kind you clearly have in mind." He turned to face Schmidt, who had folded his hands behind his back to hide their shaking. "That will be all, Herr Schmidt. You are dismissed."\n\nThe Foreign Minister didn't even bother to salute as he turned and stalked from Speer's office.

Thin-faced with prominent ears, he was not the sort of fellow one would expect to hold a tremendously successful record as former head of Foreign Armies East, a military intelligence unit active during the war against the Soviets. Nor could he be counted as a particularly dedicated ideologue. What he was, however, was loyal, ruthless and utterly dedicated to his nation, having continued his own intelligence operations against the Bolsheviks even after their defeat. In Speer's estimation, he was not only brilliant, but also a true German patriot, which was why he had been invited to the lofty halls of power to discuss a certain proposal of his.\n\nSpeer relaxed a little, sensing nothing but respectful deference from the neatly-dressed man with his quaint bowler hat. "So, Herr Gehlen," he said, steepling his fingers. "I understand that on top of all this information you've brought me, you have an idea for how to deal with the matter of internal security. Please, speak your mind."\n\nGehlen hesitated for a moment before visibly relaxing and leaning onto the desk. "My Führer, it's no secret in intelligence circles that you are seeking to rein in the Gestapo and Abwehr, if I may be so bold. They are, indeed, in poor shape. They could neither prevent the civil war, nor rein in the dissident factions within the Reich."\n\nSpeer's face remained inscrutable. "Go on."\n\n"After the war, the Americans changed tack. Their wartime organization, the OSS, became the foundation of the CIA. They learned from their mistakes, adjusted accordingly and now they're drastically outpacing us in the field of intelligence. The same goes for the Japanese, as well as for every second-rate power in the world. We need something else - a new intelligence agency for the modern era."\n\nSpeer pondered this for a moment. "Interesting idea. Do you have anything more concrete for me?"\n\nGehlen nodded. He hauled his briefcase up onto the desk and clicked it open, producing an over-stuffed manila envelope with 'Reichsnachrichtendienst' scrawled on the front. "I do indeed, my Führer. Would you like to know more?""

 speer.213.d:0 "I wondered, as I often did in those days, how history might regard me. Outwardly, and to the rest of the world's estimation, I would have no choice but to be remembered as the great liberal Führer. For weeks after the civil war, I could look out the window of my office in the Reich Chancellery and see the crowds of well-wishers packing the plaza below. From my lofty perch, they appeared a great, seething mass on the busiest days. Individuals melted away, assimilated into the great din of humanity. Unable to pick out their faces, I was aware in those moments that this was 'people power' made manifest - that same tide that had swept my predecessor into power and changed the fate of Germany forevermore. It was impressive, mighty, and utterly terrifying. They chanted my name, saluted my presence and demanded of me things I could never be certain of delivering in those troubled days.\n\nMy thoughts after those occasions invariably turned inwards. Far from the adulation of cheering crowds, within the very buildings I had designed for the glory of the Reich, the Party was gathering strength. The post-war legal inquiries carried out by the Gestapo had sapped its strength, but it remained the largest power bloc in the Reich. The workers and disaffected youth might have outnumbered them a thousand fold, but the Party held power second only to myself. If I wholeheartedly followed the lead of my cabinet and embraced the popular movement that claimed to have my full support, I would permanently alienate this pillar of stability for the Reich. On the other hand, moving too close to them might have undermined my popular support, owing to their highly conservative agenda that I would need to adhere to.\n\nTo admit the complexity of this situation, even in writing, is difficult. But I must preserve my words for posterity, so that future generations will understand my choice. Perhaps it will be centuries before these words are seen, but no secret of this magnitude can be concealed forever."

"Some of these groups... I'm sure the Gestapo weeded them out, root and stem, thirty years ago."\n\n"I'm positive, my Führer. It's likely that many junior members of such organizations were beneath the Gestapo's notice at the time. I wouldn't be surprised if they kept to their beliefs in secret all these years."\n\n"I trust you, Herr Gehlen, but this just seems beyond belief. Look at..." he paused a moment, eyebrows rising. "Antifaschistische Aktion? Now, really, that's... Hitler spared no expense in rooting out every known communist in Germany. You're telling me that they survived all this time?"\n\nGehlen shook his head. "No, my Führer. I believe that to be a copycat organization. We still find banned literature in the hands of dissident cells - I wouldn't be surprised if some more radical members of the student movement have turned to Bolshevism for some inane reason." He almost spat the sentence out, not even bothering to hide his open disgust at such treason.\n\nSpeer continued scanning the list. Then - his breath caught, as his eyes did, on the final name listed. Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. Speer didn't recognize the name straight away, but something about it seemed... ah. Of course. The SPD paramilitary, with its fluttering tricolor and bizarre mixture of military men and well-groomed politicians. Attached to the organization's brief was a name, which for reasons well within Speer's understanding rattled him to the core.\n\n"Spartakus?" Speer looked up at Gehlen, horrified comprehension dawning on his face. He knew his history well enough to understand. "Do you mean to say that..."\n\n"We've yet to determine the significance of that moniker, my Führer. It could be misdirection. However, yes, it is possible that it means exactly what it implies."\n\nOne could have heard a pin drop in the Führer's office. Speer sputtered.

In homes throughout Germany, families have been busying themselves clearing out unused cupboards to make room for weeks' worth of food. Once, a purse full of marks would barely feed one person for a day, let alone five. Now, the same amount of money can feed a family for a fortnight or more. One has yet to hear parents scolding their children for over-stuffing themselves, given that activity has quickly become a favorite pastime of the long-deprived German masses.\n\nFood is not the only thing Germans find themselves truly enjoying once more; electronics, cars and luxury goods have all become much more affordable. Many a household has recently been graced with a new television, while pedestrian congestion has greatly easy as the number of citizens owning private transport has increased massively. Petrol companies, in particular, are quite pleased with this development. Businesses big and small are finally turning a profit, and some semblance of prosperity is returning to the least devastated parts of the Reich.\n\nThis upturn must not be overstated, however, as Erhard constantly reminds the Führer. While many citizens have risen above the poverty line, many more remain beneath it, lacking the means to actually benefit from the renewed Reichsmark. Charity can only achieve so much, and there remains much to do if Speer hopes to elevate the working classes from their depression."

Hermann Josef Abs was smoking his same brand of cigars, and his eyes mirrored Erhard's: cold, calculating, merciless. This, however, was where the similarities ended: unlike the president of the IG Farben, the Reichsminister actually had ideals, and this made the difference.\n\n"I called you in order to notify you of the imminent dismantlement of IG Farben. It will be broken into its constituent companies, each to become a competitor in a free-market economy."\n\nThere, he had dropped the bomb. He was prepared: Abs would scream at him, the two would scream at each other, until he would leave, defeated. Therefore, it was difficult to rein in his surprise when he heard his rival's words.\n\n"I see, Reichsminister. Thank you for what you are doing for the Reich."\n\nErhard's jaw stopped short of falling to the ground, and Abs laughed.\n\n"I can see your surprise, but your fears are unfounded. I know that you are trying to abolish slavery and build a new, competitive Germany based around free market and positive competition. I wholeheartedly agree with you, and I'll tell you more: I have tried several times to reduce IG Farben's reliance on slaves, but the others in the Board of Directors always objected, so I'm glad that you took the initiative."\n\nFinally, Erhard recovered from the shock enough to shake hands with Abs when he stated his need to participate to a board meeting. As soon as he was back on his stuffed chair, Erhard started reflecting upon what he had heard: Abs was lying - that he was sure of - but why? What could bring a man who had no qualms in sending thousands to their deaths for a couple millions Reichsmarks to suddenly support the abolition of slavery? Something was wrong, but he couldn't yet put his head around it."

He was losing his power, his position, everything he had worked for during and after the war. However, he knew his position: he was no Abs, but a functionary put there by the government to oversee a state-owned company.\n\n"I understand. I will obey my orders," was his only answer, anger replaced by defeat.\n\nErhard nodded curtly. Part of him had hoped for a bit more resistance, but Geilenberg was no fool. He was already calculating how to cut his losses, and by giving his acceptance he had already secured his first point.

Flick's voice changed tone, becoming mellifluous and almost sickeningly sweet.\n\n"I'm sure you are a man of refined tastes... Perhaps we could find an accomodation? A deal between fellow businessmen?"\n\nErhard smiled. He knew the sniveling bastard would have tried to bribe him: he always had his way before, and expected him to be the same as all the others who preceded him behind his desk.\n\n"Oh, I'm sure we can find a deal." he said smiling, but Flick's predatory smile was cut short by the sound of a recorder playing.\n\n"Reichsminister, I'm sure there is another way.

It doesn't take a genius to know why I have been called here: a clean cut is better than a game of cat and mouse."\n\nLudwig nodded. Unlike all others, Wehrwirtschaftsführer von Siemens had been a steadfast - if interested - ally in his reforms. Together, they had worked to reduce the need for slaves in the other conglomerates, and the entrepreneur had used his influence to protect the minister from economic backlash on the other companies' part. Still, free market didn't admit exceptions, and they both knew that.\n\n"In light of the new economic policy, Siemens is to be stripped of its privileges, and will - from now on - operate as a normal company in a free market."\n\nWhen von Siemens looked at him in surprise, Erhard chuckled: "You must have come here expecting dismantlement, didn't you? It's almost a pity Siemens is too tightly-knitted to be broken down, and not big enough to pose a threat to fair competition: consider yourself lucky."\n\nErnst von Siemens felt once again the two parts of his mind agitating.

Honestly, most of this isn't my work, but Reichsminister Erhard has devised a plan to ensure we can limit our losses as much as possible. To put it simply, we'll stall the war as long as we can, and liquidate all possible assets before retreating: we'll load up all extracted resources and bring them to Germany, evacuate the personnel, transfer all remaining supplies, sell state-owned companies and shares and drain all funds from the Reichskommissariat. Once we have secured as much as we could, we'll abandon Africa altogether."\n\n"On one thing I agree with Herr Schmidt," begins von Tresckow, "keeping Deutsch-Afrika may cost us more than any resource we are gaining now. Still, if we leave our possessions there, we'll do it when and how we want: we won't be dictated to by a foreign power!

Apparently, they now needed to protect the loading operations, but when they asked why the Wehrmacht was guarding shipping procedures usually carried out by privates and mercenaries, all they were answered was that it was "sensitive informations".\n\nNow, they were looking through a list of cargoes, checking the ones already loaded. "Diamond cargo 329-bH-1 from slave mine Hitlerstadt-Ost?" "Loaded", "Gold cargo 546-pA-7 from indentured asset Lèopoldville-Norden?"

For years, we've kept it under our boots, husbanding the resources of this continent - to provide for our people and our Fatherland. Now we are lost, and as our hearts burn and our passion struggle, we are to accept our banishment.\n\nStabbed in the back, we will turn away from this cowardly Speer. We refuse to see him as our Führer, and we will fight on - even if we are alone. And we will show them that we are more courageous than they are, even if it means dying, in either defeat or victory.\n\nBut how will we last if we have no more support from the Reich? Because of his cowardly nature, we have little options left. We are going to lose to time, but we just can't give up. If we can keep on fighting hard, maybe we can go home..."

SpeerSAW.6.d:0 "The new security minister sharply marched into Speers office. The Führer stood up to receive him, watching the older man salute him crisply and recite firmly, "Heil!"\n\nSpeer was impressed to see him, a wise but firm Prussian. A welcome subordinate, especially in times as dark as now, the war against South Africa souring everything for Germany. He gestured to the Generalfeldmarschall to sit down with him.\n\n"Thank you, Generalfeldmarschall, for coming here," Speer said, "I understand you can help me find a solution for the war."\n\n"Yes, my Führer, I'm glad to help you. I'm eager to help you get this under control. This is an opportunity which will surely keep us out of too much trouble."\n\n"An opportunity for the military, von Tresckow?" Speer asked, an eyebrow raised at him.\n\n"Yes. We must impress the Heer, my Führer," he replied. "If we do this, we can keep them in line. They're getting restless because of this war. And I don't want them to break ranks and become a problem. I don't want their officers to sow discord, to make us look bad. Showing off our might on the battlefields of Africa and energizing the people so that they would support us even as we remove ourselves from the war would all be great for us in the end. And if we can do this, I can keep working with Speidel to continue our reforms."\n\n"You want to create a diversion? By intensifying the war?" Speer said, trying to understand what he meant by using this "opportunity."\n\n"Yes. This will keep the more troubling elements of our ranks from interfering or sabotaging our plans, and it will also give us better chances at withdrawing from the war. And above all, it would keep Schörner happy," the Prussian said, releasing a sharp but disgusted chuckle at mentioning the bastard from Munich. He continued, "In simpler terms, if we present a strong front, we can commit to our withdrawal without too many worries."\n\n"I see." Speer thought about it, letting von Tresckow look at him and wait. In time, the Führer looked up and told him, "Go on, Generalfeldmarschall.""

SpeerSAW.7.d:0 "A sudden wave of commissions swept away the cinematic world of the Fatherland.

Preparations and canvassing for crews, cast, and settings were done. And plans for great shows and special effects were rolling through the minds of daring producers and scriptwriters.\n\nSuch efforts were being accomplished in record time all over Germany. And it helped the producers and the more creative types go on daring visits to the African Reichskommissariats; to see for themselves the legions of men who have chosen to give their lives for the Fatherland."

But the greatest parade of all was taking place in Germania, down the Avenue of Splendors, to the beat of a thousand drums and the melody of a union of bands. Strong, young men of the Fatherland were marching together as one, by unit, in the eyes of the entire world and of Germany.\n\nWithout shame in their faces, without guilt in their hearts, they, in their finest uniforms, their best helmets and boots, present themselves on foot, on their vehicles, and in their flying machines over the skies of the Reich to inspire their families and their friends.\n\nA wonderful stroke of propaganda. As Speer saluted them from his platform, together with his cabinet, the men who looked to him as they passed by, gathering their courage and resolve from his presence.\n\nHe thought of the days of Adolf Hitler as he saluted the men who won the Second World War for the Fatherland. Now he would do the same for these young souls who would win the battles for Africa.\n\nEven if there would be no great victory for the Reich and its African Reichskommissariats, it would at least keep the people and the Wehrmacht secure. And so long as they feel secure, the Fatherland can keep on marching towards a brighter future."

SpeerSAW.9.d:0 "Kurt had volunteered for Afrika when the posters had begun appearing in Munich. He had fought during the Civil War, and the factory he used to work at was rubble now, so in the end he had decided to stay in the Heer when the militias had been offered the choice between disbanding and formally joining the army. In those few months, he had seen what truly was the Wehrmacht: a massive den of corruption, where nepotism, incompetence and division ran rampant. The Truppenführer's favorites never stood guard and got nicer meals, while he had to cover for their turns or risk being accused of dereliction of duty.\n\nAlongside him, four others of his unit had volunteered, attracted by the steep rise in pay. Fedor, one of the former commander's cronies, had been killed by the Amerikaner when he had forgotten to put on his camouflage; the best part, however, had been when Johann, another one high on the list, had tried to convince the new officer to let him off a patrol citing "friends in high places". The officer had pointed the gun at his head, and asked for the names of his friends, then sent him to military prison for attempted corruption and dereliction of duty, and the list of names to Germania.\n\nThe weather was terrible, so humid his uniform was always damp, and so hot that it would still be damp even if it hadn't been so humid. Despite this, and despite the fact that the Amerikaner were bombing the hell out of him, he felt much better: he was fighting for his country with comrades he trusted and officers who cared for victory more than they did for their salaries. What soldier could ask for more?"

SpeerSAW.10.d:0 "With the decision to leave Deutsch-Afrika revealed to the public, it's now time to bear the consequences. On the positive side, hundreds of convoys are docking each week at Hamburg and Köln, bringing Afrika's wealth to the Reich, and the budget has drawn a relieved breath as the colonial expenses have been brutally slashed. On the negative side, however, the political landscape is quickly heating up: rallies both in favor and against withdrawal will be held in the next few days, and newspapers fuel the debate by siding with the reformists or the conservative hardliners.\n\nIn order to put an end to the growing political tensions, the Führer has decided to hold a speech at Nuremberg. There, he'll explain to the nation why he had to take such a choice, and what will this new course mean for Germany and the larger Reich. A large crowd is expected to attend, and security will be extremely tight, but there is still the concrete chance that agitators will try to make themselves heard. Now more than ever, the Führer's words will pave the way to the future of the German people."
SpeerSAW.10.a:0 "Now, let's write a nice speech..."

SpeerSAW.11.t:0 "Packing Up"
SpeerSAW.11.d:0 "Speer read the final reports on his desk, carefully every line that carried some significance. Eventually, he stopped, leaned back in his seat, and looked out of his office, turning his mind to the very last efforts he would exercise for the Fatherland regarding the South African War.\n\nAll the remaining investments, all the hard currency and the best of the resources the Reichskommissariats - these would return to the Reich. That way, they would be safely out of the hands of the advancing OFN.\n\nThe only price he had to pay for getting everything he could out of harm's way was the loss of territory and influence over Afrika to the Americans and their allies. Now, they would be the ones to replace them, out there in the dark heart of Afrika.\n\nEven if they do fail to achieve victory against the Fatherland's colonies in that continent, he told himself, we would at least rid ourselves off a sinking ship. The rising costs, the infighting among the governments of the three Reichskommmisariats against one another, and the growing strength of the OFN, all these were just too much for Germany to carry on her own.\n\nHe sighed, forcing himself to review the reports one last time before he closed them up and set them back into the basket. Now he had to start contemplating the rest of the plan for withdrawal."

SpeerSAW.13.d:0 "The Stadtpark was filled to the brim. A massive platform had been erected at one end of the large park, lined with golden eagles, with a smaller one serving as the podium currently occupied by the most important man in the entire Reich. Speakers ensured everyone attending could hear their Führer's voice, and dozens of camera crews covered those who couldn't be present. Albert Speer looked at the crowd, drew a large breath that sounded more like a sigh to himself, and then spoke.\n\n"Men and women of Nuremberg! Proud people of Germany! Loyal citizens of the Reich! Today is a great day, a day in which the future of this new, great country is set! After the ravages of the civil war, brought upon us by the corrupt kleptocrats that crowded Adolf Hitler's deathbed, came the unjust invasion of Deutsch-Afrika by the Americans: they took advantage of our momentary weakness to usurp our place in Afrika!" he interrupted his speech for the scheduled popular outrage.\n\n"However, we managed to save as many good Germans as possible, because that's what a government does: it protects its people! And I will protect the Reich from its enemies! Unlike those who tried to usurp my predecessor's mantle, however, we shall achieve greatness through peace and reason! We shall be great again, and no one will dare to insult us ever again! Power through peace, supremacy through reason!" and then the applause began, sincere enough not to require the paid claque present as a safety measure.\n\nAs he stared at the crowd, drinking in the adoration, Speer couldn't fail to notice a small movement at the park's corner. There, a few young men and women stood holding picket signs, surrounded by the police: they were peaceful, but even in the distance, he could read one of the signs, and it made an unpleasant feeling creep through his spine."

SpeerSAW.14.d:0 "They waited until the thick blanket of night coated the city of Mainz, and took over an abandoned warehouse building in the outskirts. Many came, hundreds even, all with leather clothing and fancy hair, carrying symbols of anti-fascism and having a penchant for anything and everything that came from America. By the time the clock struck midnight, the preparations were made, and roughly three hundred found themselves packed large, open space.\n\nThe shrill of an electric guitar caught their attention, and from the crackle of the microphone on the makeshift stage a voice came. "Ladies and gentlemen of Germany! People from top to bottom, I welcome all of you!" There was a cheer that spread outwards, and as the noise settled, he continued. "Glad you folks came here to celebrate, because I've got a few songs for you all. Let's make it quick, eh? I know what you're all here for! You're all here 'cause...?"\n\nThe crowd took only a moment's pause to consider his words, then, in unison, shouted.\n\n"NO MORE WARS ACROSS THE WORLD!"\n\nWith cheers and whistles, the man chuckled and leaned back from the microphone. "Our first song goes out to Reichskommissariat Hans Hüttig - the old, decrepit bastard!" And with a final roll of the guitar, the cacophony of rock and roll began, clearing a path distant into the night, as watchful eyes from beyond observed and noted how the counterculture movement ebbed its way toward places it had no right being in."

SpeerSAW.15.t:0 "The Strangest Place"
SpeerSAW.15.d:0 "Of all the cities in all of Germany, the government was not expecting a protest to spark in one of Germany's most politically important cities - Linz, which was affectionately nicknamed "Hitler's hometown". Sources are light and fractured on what could have caused it, but police reports have spoken mainly about a single fact. It began in the University of Vienna, and spread from there in an almost sporadic-like fashion. Newsreels couldn't resist the opportunity to show footage of thousands flooding the streets, running headlines about punks and students holding down confrontations with police cars.\n\nGoing down to the street view, further reports showed that there was a common message with the protestors. All of them had variations, but they resonated all the same.\n\n"BRING THE WAR HOME!"\n"NO MORE BOYS ON AFRICAN SHORES!"\n"THE REICHSKOMMISSARIAT THREE CAN DO IT ON THEIR OWN!"\n\nMost importantly there was one that was starkly common amidst the protestors, which was the phrase "NO MORE WARS ACROSS THE WORLD!" Police have suspected that this phrase had connotations in Mainz and other cities nearby, and has spread rapidly throughout the entirety of Germany. After a period of three days, with tense stand-offs with police, Vienna began calming down, with the almost-ten-thousand dispersing into less than five thousand, but the voices remained strong, and it seemed like the people of Germany were catching on to the situation in the South African War."

SpeerSAW.16.t:0 "There Is A House In Germania"
SpeerSAW.16.d:0 "It was an open secret that Welthaupstadt Germania was nothing different compared to the other German cities about its youth. In fact, Germania was seen as the hotspot for counterculture, even if its police force was practically a small army, and kept dissent on the low side.\n\nAt least, it did, until news broke one morning of how not only thousands, but tens of thousands of people - not only students, but the scant working men and women of Germany, and retired veterans accompanying them - flooding the wide streets and blocking the busy lanes, it not only resulted in business halting for many days afterwards, but to show just how far the security force of Germany had fallen.\n\nThe police, as they found out, were underfunded, untrained, and unprepared to deal with such mass chaos swarming the capital of Germany. There were too little officers prepared to deal with entire streets packed with people chanting for the war to end abruptly, and those that attempted to calm them were only met with furious rebuttals and, in some rare cases, violent reprisals. Sometimes, people would pass by and picket the Volkshalle, and while they were quickly moved out, it was to the point when the government would be utterly blind to not notice how public opinion has soured.\n\nIt had even come to the point where Albert Speer began taking different routes to the Reichskanzlei and the Volkshalle, in order to not be stopped by protestors and deal with their anger and frustration, and many officials in the NSDAP began travelling more covertly in order to not be harassed likewise."

 speer.555.d:0 "For the last decade, the German government has invested millions of Reichsmarks into Gotenland, the Gau created from the ancestrally Aryan region of Crimea. In this time the territory has proven to be by far the most successful example of Germanization in the Eastern Territories, and its well-developed capital of Theodorichshafen is a hub of both military control and local tourism. Yet current developments seem to be placing the Gau at direct threat of annihilation.\n\nGotenland, unlike most of Germany, has avoided the specter of civil war, with its Gauleiter Franz Maierhofer remaining largely neutral. However, the specter of banditry looms ever larger. As partisans see key victories in Ukraine, Gotenland faces an existential threat. The result has been a collapse in the economy and stability of what was once a fairly well-off region.\n\nGauleiter Maierhofer has detailed this crisis to us in a series of increasingly desperate messages to us; due to present conditions we are unable to respond. However, his last missive was of a very different tone. Ignoring proper procedure, he has declared a state of emergency which will allow him to "temporarily assume command of any Wehrmacht units as well as give orders to any NSDAP institutions until the situation across Germany is resolved." This act is technically illegal, but litigating it is hardly worth value in this moment.\n\nThe good news is that for now, Gotenland will be organized enough to protect itself from bandits. The bad news is that, should Ukraine fall, it will be near impossible to provide the state any assistance."

He was flanked by two other German diplomats while Kubiyovych sat with merely a guard besides him. Weidenmann spoke first, a smooth tongue and smoother expression. "Mister Kubiyovych," he began, speaking in German-tinted Ukrainian. "As you know, you are collaborators of the Greater German Reich. And as you also know, we have recently had a shift in administration. Most importantly, as it stands, we are at a precipice. Can you tell us why the Rada should be kept?"\n\nKubiyovych nodded. "Of course. The reasoning is simple: if you wish to keep the population content with your rule, you must give them a semblance of democracy. Besides that, a civilian administration will be less of a burden on the Reich, and will have long-term positive effects on the popular perception of Ukraine remaining in the Einheitspakt." Spoken like a true collaborator, Weidenmann noted.\n\nThe German nodded. "I believe this shall bring our negotiations to a close, Mister Kubiyovych. The Reich will make its choice now, and the effects shall realize themselves in a few weeks' time. I assume you wish to know the decision?" Kubiyovych, naturally, nodded."

Whatever that generous offer was, he wasn't keen on accepting it. It was nice to simply live peacefully in his home with his wife while his two sons were out-and-about, but he decided not to discard the letter immediately.\n\n"Dear Viktor Lutsenko,\n\nIt's come to our attention that you have been regarded as a prolific maths professor." Oh. "Your former working residence was the Taras Shevchenko University, which was demolished in accidental-" Pah. Accidental. "-artillery fire during the Second World War. However, the University is undergoing a massive reconstruction project that will be authentic to the original, and we will need employees for when it opens." His gaze narrowed.

"... though, we'll make it clear that some of your co-workers shall be of German background. We hope that you do not discriminate." Viktor felt disgust rise in his throat, but the offer was so tempting. Perhaps, he'd admit to himself, constantly being at home could get boring. And he always enjoyed teaching mathematics, interacting with the children, drawing out various formulas both simple and meticulous on the green board.

Cheers and whistles were met in response, and Speer took a moment to nod before continuing.\n\n"To the brave fighters of Ukraine, I dedicate this speech to you. We shall honor the men who died for Ukraine, who died for the Reich, who died serving a cause greater than themselves. I dedicate this speech to my people, for knowing that the Ukrainians are loyal allies, for realizing this potential and bringing them into the Reich's protecting wing.

It was tense on the Ukrainian front, that was for certain.

What freedom? Freedom to flounder and die without their help? He felt a sense of superiority when he made his way through the desolate outskirts, and the inner city could still not match the beauty of Germania.\n\nHe would see to it that they return.

Then a small burst came, and a young man's voice was transmitted through it. "Yes, Generalfeldmarschen, Kiew has forced our diplomats to leave, and have denied any further contact with us."

Wie is dit?"\n\nSpeer bit his tongue for a moment before speaking. Of course it wasn't German. "This is the Führer Albert Speer speaking." He could almost hear the jovial industrialist on the other side light up with emotions. "Oh, ja, good! Now, I-I don't wish to waste too much of your time, but I assume you are calling me to confirm that the, ah... transaction has been fulfilled? Our friend Tys is getting anxious in Kiew, you know."\n\nSpeer sighed, tempted to drop the call there. He had already known all he needed - but he relented. "Yes, they've been sent, and we've begun coordinating a diplomatic mission with Romania in order to commit to a future territorial swap. That is all you needed, correct?"

Hitler's Germany had been abysmal, and Speer's regime had proved only superficially better, but at least both had the humility of a nominal republic. Schmidt gazed out the window at the corrupt symbols of the Japanese nation, an Empire built on the rape of China and the Pacific. He reached for his pocket, and as if the universe taunted him, no cigars were to be found; this headache would simply need to be handled with no sedative."

 speerjapan.2.t:0 "The "Glory" From Within"
 speerjapan.2.desc:0 ""Our men stand with absolute loyalty to the Führer and the national ideal," Helmut Schmidt said in forced pleasantry to the Japanese men opposite him. One of the younger gentlemen was furiously scribbling on a notepad, looking up at the foreign minister regularly with an expression of wonder and intrigue. "The Wehrmacht is the ultimate disciplined oppositional force to the American threat."\n\nAnd it was the ultimate disciplined force. Schmidt had been only eighteen when he joined the Wehrmacht and had seen firsthand the suffering and carnage it caused. Russian men had been slaughtered before his eyes, innocents and soldiers alike crushed under the heel of Hitler's eastward march. Here he was, however, praising its glories. What kind of monster was he, celebrating the military-industrial complex which had brought Germany's neighbours death and sorrow, before creating the near national suicide of the Civil War.\n\n"How you describe the Wehrmacht would greatly interest the Prime Minister and perhaps our Emperor. I think this meeting has borne some great fruit for future cooperation between our nations." Schmidt sighed. He had succeeded."
 speerjapan.2.a:0 "Victory is such sweet sorrow."

 speerjapan.3.t:0 "The Threat From Without"
 speerjapan.3.desc:0 ""Consider this President. He seems stable now, no?" Schmidt offered to his Japanese interlocutors. "At any moment, however, he can be replaced by a man of completely opposite character. Every eight years, this is certain, but he receives a challenge midway through his term, and his powers risk restraint every two years from that Congress of theirs. Your Empire would do better with a certain partner. Our Führer, like your Emperor, is guaranteed for an entire lifetime."\n\nSchmidt wishes that Speer wasn't. He longed for America's instability. He longed for her progress, made in short jumps, not centurial designs. His career might suffer, yes, but what was a career for the chance of liberation? Certainly, he would prefer honest poverty to his present hypocritical privileges.\n\nThe argument, however, hit home for the Japanese. Schmidt's suited counterparts nodded in agreement with every line, in almost unwavering agreement with the German line."

 speerjapan.4.t:0 "The Blue Scare"
 speerjapan.4.desc:0 "Speer wondered sometimes if Hitler's ghost still roamed the Chancellery's halls. The old Führer still certainly haunted Speer's plans. That fool had the gall for a near assassination, and by the Tokumusoukan of all people, meaning Germany's population is still suspicious, if not outright hostile, to the idea of Japanese alignment. No matter. A good counternarrative wasn't something the Führer was unused to crafting.\n\nThe Deputy Führer was called into the office and a plan was hatched. Kiesinger's friends in the conservative wing of the Party would be contacted, with warnings of America's capitalist degeneracy infecting the Germany they have worked so hard to perfect. In contrast, the Japanese, our traditional allies in the Axis powers, are icons of tradition, stability and hegemony. Conservative newspapers and radio networks would broadcast this line of thinking, and the country would be brought in line with the Führer's vision.\n\nWashington's favour will falter, but the greatest nations are rarely allied without the blood of another. A sacrifice worthy to sway the German population."

 speerjapan.5.t:0 "History Rewritten"
 speerjapan.5.desc:0 "Anti-Japanese sentiment in Germany has cooled, but not disappeared. However, anti-Americanism has quickly supplanted its role in the national conscience. In a controversial interview, the Führer told a conservative talk show host that new evidence gathered by the RND suggested that the Tokumusoukan had nothing to do with Hitler's assassination, and in fact, it had been a CIA operation all along. Polling data today shows that the German pubic's favour for Japan has superseded that of its favour for the United States. A shift in perspective has begun."

It is no secret that our financial and industrial complexes have been historically turbulent, and even with Erhard's best efforts, the heart of Germany's production beats slower than it did in its youth. Trade and liberalisation bring great boons, however. Japanese firms, the Zaibatsu and others, have indicated keenness to invest in the Reich, particularly the Ruhr and our other industrial heartlands. This stimulant, Erhard tells us, will give German companies the push they need to increase their staff sizes and reduce our national unemployment issues.\n\nMoney isn't free, however. The Japanese would like to reach an agreement regarding their side of the contract, wherein we ease our protectionist policies and lift tariffs on their companies. The conservatives of the Reich may not be pleased with this, but it seems like the only choice. The Japanese certainly make it appear as such."

 speerjapan.7.desc:0 "Japan brings with it possible augmentations to the German machine that will make us a fearsome presence on the world stage. Since our alliance broke apart, our nations have developed technology in isolation, and Japanese science has advanced in ways our Wehrmacht must take full advantage of. Beyond just shared mechanical advances and joint drills, the Japanese alliance brings with it unprecedented geopolitical advantage. With an ally dominating Asia, our spheres would form a co-defensive shield, allowing us to spread our influence without a knife in the back, from them or anyone else.\n\nThere is a, well, peculiar addendum to these benefits. Japan has requested that Germany assist with their 'policing actions', a series of activities Germania has been granted suspiciously little details on."

However, as Schmidt hangs up the line to Germania, he cannot help but feel that there is more to Germany's new friends in Tokyo than meets the eye.\n\nHe sits in his hotel room with a cigar, pondering. Was it the way they spoke and dress? The over-politeness that made him suspicious? Surely not, as since he was a boy Schmidt had heard of the properness and honour of the Japanese culture. It did not seem out of place. Was it their insistence? But what were they insistent on? Tariff removal, something even old Erhard preached the merits of. It was odd though, the way they pushed it, at every meeting emphasising these economic agreements. He could not shake the feeling that Germany was running headfirst into a trap.\n\nIt was late, however, and the foreign minister crushed his cigar in the ashtray. These were thoughts for tomorrow morning."

 speerjapan.9.desc:0 "Had Bismarck been in rooms like this? Had Von Metternich? Was Schmidt following in their footsteps as he approached the Japanese delegation across from him? Daily life in Germania had been exciting, to begin with, but the rotation between the Volkshalle and the Chancellery had become far more mundane than Schmidt had ever thought foreign affairs could be. In these moments, though, he felt that he was acting not as just himself, but as the whole legacy of German geopolitics. In the skies above, those mythical heroes of Germany's ambassadorial tradition, Schmidt liked to think, were looking over him. A blind spot had emerged, however. The daydreams of the Reich's foreign minister were shattering slowly as he, and his delegation, realised that they had been conned.\n\nIn many ways, it was too late. The negotiations had already started, and the Japanese were pressing for the removal of their tariffs. This would, according to the Reich's economist at the delegation, mean Germany would be economically dependent on Japan for almost five years. The holiday to Tokyo, it seemed, had been a little less than a free lunch.\n\nGermany's delegation considered its options. The deal, as it was, could be accepted. Diplomatic relations improve, things remain cordial, and we all return home to Germania after a nice holiday in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Or, we could try and bargain down the tariff removal and perhaps reduce Japan's proposed scheduling as well. Not only would Germany maintain her economic dependence, but Schmidt might just about maintain his life when he next sees Erhard."

The Empire's offer would have to be accepted.\n\nThe Reich would remove all tariffs on Japanese imports for the next five years. The delegation's consensus, behind closed doors, seemed to be that Germany was on its way to economic vassaldom. For half a decade, the cheaper goods of the East would likely flood and monopolise Europe's market. Schmidt felt that, when he left, it would be with his tail between his legs. However, better he leave a negotiation with an outcome than run from a diplomatic breakdown and ruin all the progress the two nations had made already. What was it the Iberians say?"

However, Schmidt had come with an agenda. Germany's next proposal was to be presented, and the Reich's foreign minister was hopeful.\n\nGermany needed investment, and with its Frankensteinish economy still barely putting itself back together, growth was a necessity. Particularly, large corporations had vacuumed up much of the market and monopoly had become the norm for the Reich. Schmidt wanted to request for Japanese investment into the economy, with special focus on the smaller businesses that needed to be jump-started into success and expand Germany's middle class. Improving employment was also a major issue for the new Germany, and a large part of the solution was diversifying the range of employers."

 speerjapan.16.t:0 "A Disappointing Offer"
 speerjapan.16.desc:0 "Japan holds steadfast. The first deal from the Empire is investment, but only in the form of shares of some major German corporations. Not only will this have little effects on Schmidt's hopeful goals of reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth, but will also buy Tokyo influence in Germany's economy with no gain for the Reich. Needless to say, Germania's foreign minister is remarkably disappointed.\n\nSchmidt sees himself with two options. Either Germany accepts this imperfect deal, or keeps pushing for larger concessions, risking Japan's favour."

At the end of the day, some investment is better than none, and Germany's economy is in dire need of all the assistance it can get.

Schmidt suddenly felt the weight one does when they're the sole focal point of attention in the room. With an undetectable gulp and disguised tension, the foreign minister continued.\n\n"The logical choice, my friends, is to invest in the promising industry of German infrastructure. According to our reports, perfected by the great economists of the Reich under the internationally renowned Ludwig Erhard, the industry is due for a cyclical boom period; very, very soon. With the expansion of more firms across the country, your investments will reap even further profit and have access to a wider market of potential suitors. With these new investments into infrastructure, more firms in the general economy will be established, not just in this specific industry. An efficient road and rail system across the Reich will inevitably lead to a reduction of transport costs, incentivising business creation, and thus the production of new investment partners for the Reich and the Empire." The foreign minister, feeling especially Bismarckian, paused for effect. "Gentlemen, it is basic economics."\n\nNods and mutters of agreement bubbled on the Japanese side. Schmidt, at this point, figured himself well able to read the Japanese crowd. He knew what this meant. Another victory. The German foreign minister smiled, pleased with himself, and knowing that his nation would similarly be pleased. The once magnificent Autobahns and railways of the Reich would now have the funds to be reborn in a shape and condition worthy of the country they span."

I strongly believe, however, that further Japanese investment into the Reich's infrastructure would be even more beneficial to both of our nations. Any risk you may perceive in such investments, I assure you, only exists in the immediate term as we continue our ongoing recovery efforts from the internal conflict. As the Reich continues to regain its footing and reclaim its spot as the world's foremost economy, any hint of doubt regarding our situation will rapidly fade away. And, of course, such great economic collaboration now is guaranteed to foster strong economic ties between our nations in the future and improve the Empire of Japan's image in the eyes of the German people... and investors."\n\nNo response. Damn it! He just had to push it that much further, didn't he? Why couldn't he keep his stupid mouth shut?\n"With all due respect, Foreign Minister Schmidt, relations between our countries are still new, and we do not exactly have investors clamoring to enter the German market given the current circumstances," replied the head of the Japanese delegation. "Were you not satisfied with our already generous offer? We will have to discuss and perhaps even reconsider our previous proposal. My apologies, Foreign Minister"

Or, as the topic was titled at the negotiating table, "non-involvement."\n\nSurely, as the upcoming round of discussions began, the Japanese would ask Schmidt to provide guarantees that Germany would not get itself involved in internal (or maybe even external) Co-Prosperity Sphere affairs. These were not promises Schmidt wished to make, as he strongly opposed Japan's violent hegemony over Asia, but depending on how many demands he could wriggle the Reich out of, it would maybe be possible for such promises to secretly be empty ones; Germany might be able to assist, for example, the rebels fighting for freedom in Indonesia.\n\nSchmidt chewed on the fine line he would have to walk if he wanted to seem amicable to Japan's interests while also trying to help the world become a slightly less brutal and evil place."

We ask that all German ships travelling through Co-Prosperity Sphere waters be submitted to cargo checks prior to entry. Understand that this is essential to the Sphere's internal security, Herr Schmidt."\n\n"Searching every single vessel to pass through the Sphere's territorial waters could greatly hurt our profit margins and slow down our shipping," Schmidt replied. "Of course, I understand why you ask this of us."\n\nSchmidt was not happy with any agreement that would hurt Germany's economic recovery, and therefore its working class. The Japanese delegation knew this, of course. What they did not know about was Schmidt's sympathies towards the Indonesian freedom fighters who, while not necessarily seeing eye-to-eye with Schmidt on every issue, at least had the guts to actually stand up and openly fight fascism. But was this worth souring relations with Japan yet again? Germany desperately needed economic partners."

The Reich will allow all shipping to pass through Sphere waters to have its cargo examined in exchange for your valuable investments," stated Schmidt to the Japanese delegation.\n\nThe pleasantly surprised look on the faces of the Japanese delegation implied they had expected at least a bit of negotiating. Abandoning any chance of helping the Indonesian rebels escape Japan's fascist grip left an uneasy feeling in Schmidt's stomach, but he figured that this show of goodwill towards the Japanese now would at least pay off for Germany later."

But we do acknowledge your internal security concerns. How about we make official inspections of all cargo ships before they leave Germany to ensure that no materials are being smuggled in order to undermine Japanese sovereignty? We both get what we want: you maintain your national security and we maintain profitable trade and investments."\nThe counter-proposal made sense to Schmidt. And it seemed to make sense to the Japanese as well. Resignedly, the head of their delegation responded, "Yes, that would be an acceptable compromise. But of course we insist we receive all of your inspection reports so we know exactly what is entering our waters."\n"That will be no problem at all," replied Schmidt jovially, knowing this would be enough for him to at least somewhat help the Indonesian rebels in their fight against Japan. He supposed it was the small victories that really counted."

We cannot utterly compromise our national security for the sake of speeding up your shipping! I am afraid that if you cannot agree to this, we will be forced to reconsider our previous agreements."\nWhoops. Now the Japanese would likely inspect German ships with a great deal of suspicion and care.

Of course they'd see through that! I don't understand it, my Führer, I really don't." Schmidt sighed. "I had a deal and everything, too. One that wasn't too bad for our interests, or at least didn't ruin our relations."\n\nSpeer shrugged. "Again, we gambled and we lost.

"Depends on what we agree to."\n\nThe ambassador continued to watch Schmidt closely, the two men looking for any betrayal of either's ulterior motives. After a moment, the man stood.\n\n"Technological sharing would certainly be a boon for us both. I like the idea, Schmidt," he said.\n\nSchmidt smiled- it was a good start."

 speerjapan.30.t:0 "Opening Moves"
 speerjapan.30.desc:0 "The shutters of the Ambassador's windows were closed today, giving the room a sense of privacy. Schmidt took his seat gently as the Japanese ambassador watched him, the fluorescent lights in the roof giving off a bright glow. The ambassador began. "So, Schmidt, what is the Reich interested in obtaining from Japan?"\n\nSchmidt cleared his throat. "The Kriegsmarine and the Heer have both expressed interest in some of Japan's advancements. Navally, it is no contest- the IJN clearly outpaces our underwater capabilities. On the ground, I believe we are about even, but some areas are certainly more advanced in Tokyo than in Germania. Hell, there may even be some parts of your air doctrine we could use. In short, the Heer asks for some of your military advancements, and we are more than willing to pay for them."\n\nThe ambassador pondered for a moment before replying. "I would hope so, Schmidt, but I do not believe the IJA or IJN are as willing to hand over their secrets as I am. However, I've been reassured that neither branch has an issue with sharing some of our RADAR and communication techs. Would this be an acceptable compromise to you?"\n\nNow it was Schmidt's turn to go through the options. "I take it this is not a take it or leave it offer?"\n\nThe ambassador smiled. "Depends on what you say next. I'm sure I can do some convincing, if needed.""
 speerjapan.30.a:0 ""Yes, we can do that.""
 speerjapan.30.b:0 ""Allow me to retort, if you will...""

 speerjapan.31.t:0 "The Easy Solution"
 speerjapan.31.desc:0 "Schmidt read Speer's letter with a mixture of annoyance and resignation. It was everything he had expected it to be- perfunctory, disappointed, and with the barest hint of congratulations smeared over it. Of course Speer would be disappointed- he never had to actually talk to the Japanese. He just got to sit back and reap the rewards.\n\nOf course Schmidt could have pushed harder. The ambassador had left it open. The issue was, of course, that trying to push it was risky. If Schmidt had gambled and lost, would Speer say "Oh, that's ok. You tried your best."? No, of course not. He'd be just as disappointed as he was now. He clearly didn't understand, thought Schmidt as he sat down in his chair, just how tough it is to negotiate a détente with a power that you've been actively threatening for decades. Sure, they didn't get everything they wanted. That's how compromise works. They got something, and they get the détente that was so important. I'd call that a win myself, Schmidt thinks.\n\nHe sighed as he grabbed his lighter and a smoke. Speer never seemed to understand the finer details of international diplomacy. In the end, Speer was only an architect, not a diplomat. Maybe he'd never understand the finer points of negotiation.\n\nSometimes, Schmidt really hated having to work for him."
 speerjapan.31.a:0 "Good enough."

 speerjapan.32.t:0 "In Deep"
 speerjapan.32.desc:0 ""Well," Schmidt began, eyeing the Ambassador's watchful gaze. "To go through all this effort just for a few radios and communication advancements would be quite unsatisfactory, in my opinion. I believe that we can certainly do more with each other than just that."\n\nThe ambassador tilted his head. "What do you suggest?" Schmidt's eye's shifted around the room as he thought.\n\n"Attachés, perhaps, to aid our military. Plane technology- those bombers of yours have quite a range, perhaps that would be a useful tool for our Luftwaffe. Hell, maybe even some naval technology, like gun computation or navigation, or perhaps anti-air capabilities."\n\nThe ambassador stiffened in his chair. "And what do you propose to give us?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?"\n\nThe ambassador thought for a moment, and an uncomfortable silence entered the room. Schmidt did his best to hide the rising tide of worry inside of him. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the ambassador responded. "I believe that is a workable compromise.""

"I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?"\n\nAn uncomfortable silence entered the room. Everyone stared at the head of the delegation, awaiting his response. "We cannot accept this deal. I can see that Germany is enthusiastic to share technology and cooperate with Japan, and Japan does indeed feel the same way. But I predict this is simply beyond what our armed forces are willing to accept, and we have no desire to push them to do so."\n\nThat was unfortunate. Though for Schmidt, the issue was not the failure to develop Germany and Japan's militaries, but merely relaying this failure to Speer who would no doubt be angry. Ultimately, it wouldn't really matter too much, Schmidt supposed."

If they ended up at war with a power strong enough for Germany to need such a large navy, it would probably be the end of the world anyway. Sighing, Schmidt left his hotel and returned for another day of diplomatic negotiations.\n"Good day to you all. While we recently came to an agreement on an exchange of military support for some of your technology, Germany would actually be interested in taking this deal further. We understand that Japan has made major strides in naval technology, and Germany is very interested in the fruits of these advancements. We are prepared to offer you a substantial sum for it... in cash."\nEyebrows raised, the members of the Japanese delegation pondered and privately discussed Schmidt's offer for a moment before coming to a decision. "Seeing as we won't be fighting you in the foreseeable future, we see no reason not to sell you our advanced naval technology. Now then, shall we begin negotiating the price?" asked the head of the delegation, who made little effort to hide his greed.

While we would not exactly refer to this request as a trap, it seems that Germany's sharp and quick-witted foreign minister senses our... ulterior motives.\nThere is a great degree of logic to opening diplomatic relations with the Germans, but why shouldn't we get as much out of it as possible? We'll offer to remove tariffs on each other's goods for five years, which will yield us a great amount of influence over the German economy during that period. If you want global power and influence, you're going to have to twist some arms. Let the German delegation come and negotiate with us tomorrow, and we will see just how much Japan stands to gain from their desperation."

 speerjapan.37.t:0 "Not as Easy as We Thought"
 speerjapan.37.desc:0 ""With all respect, my friends, I think this deal is a great mistake for your nation." Already, a bold claim. "Your firms would likely choose to export into the German market more with these tariffs removed, no? This choice, to sell in a market where there's no supply but ample demand, will make your companies very rich. Too rich, perhaps. Think of your Zaibatsu. Does your state need more challenge, more corporate power from a new generation of monopolistic plutocrats? Gentlemen, I encourage you to think beyond the money. We must temper your plan for tariff reduction, and maintain protection for your sake. All the gold in Germania is not worth sacrificing the integrity of your state."\nWell then, it seems he had thoroughly thought things through before the day's negotiations. Any mention of the Zaibatsu challenging Japanese state power was already enough to turn many heads among our delegation. While it was more than certain that Schmidt was trying to maximize the potential negative consequences of our proposal because he didn't like it, his point remained valid and hung in the air stubbornly.\nThe head of our delegation had the opportunity of holding firm on our existing offer or accepting Schmidt's counteroffer of shortening the lifting of tariffs to three years with the Germans showing no preferable treatment to the Japanese market. It would not be as beneficial for Japan, but perhaps there was some sense in trying to smooth relations with Germany..."
 speerjapan.37.a:0 "Mr. Schmidt, you make a compelling case..."

 speerjapan.38.t:0 "A More Limited Deal"
 speerjapan.38.desc:0 "Would Helmut Schmidt ever be satisfied with what we offered?

"To be frank with you all, I am still not entirely sure that the deal we have arranged in its current form is all too beneficial to Germany or Japan. I think we can do better."\nThe foreign minister had to know he was getting closer and closer to a line he should not cross, but he must have been willing to do whatever it took to secure the best possible outcome for Germany. In the name of cooperation and friendship, maybe we could concede to him a little more?"
 speerjapan.38.a:0 "Yes, that wouldn't be the end of the world."
 speerjapan.38.b:0 "Enough is enough, already!"

 speerjapan.39.t:0 "Another Point of Discussion"
 speerjapan.39.desc:0 "We had thought the only topic of our negotiations with the German delegation would be tariffs, but German Foreign Minister Schmidt had come with an agenda.\nSchmidt requested assistance to the German economy in the form of Japanese investments into small businesses and to help increase employment. The look on his face while he made the proposal indicated that he was genuine and passionate in his desire to help the German people get back on their feet, but we above all needed to ensure that whatever deal was struck was beneficial to Japan. Our delegation discussed the matter before giving the foreign minister our proposal."
 speerjapan.39.a:0 "Some shares in their largest corporations will wield us some influence."

 speerjapan.40.t:0 "They Ask for More"
 speerjapan.40.desc:0 "It was too good to be true, but we were still dismayed to find that the Germans were not satisfied with our rather one-sided investment proposal. Foreign Minister Schmidt cleared his throat to gain the attention of the conference room and began speaking powerfully.\n "Gentlemen. A mistake is being made here, regarding the profitability of these limited investments. Our countries will not be brought together, and neither of our economies will be benefited, unless we are to make a decisive treaty here. If Japan sends more of it's good investors to Germany, not only will Japanese investors make more money, but your Empire will reap the taxable benefits of this prosperity, and our firms will be encouraged to issue more stock. It is an exponential cycle, gentlemen, and both our great nations stand to benefit."\nMurmurs consumed our delegation all across the table. There was certainly opportunity to be had in increasing Japanese investments in the German economy: more profits, more influence, and improved diplomatic relations with the Germans for a start. The head of the delegation came to a decision:"
 speerjapan.40.a:0 ""You make a convincing case, Mr. Schmidt.""
 speerjapan.40.b:0 ""We do not trust your case, Mr. Schmidt.""

 speerjapan.41.t:0 "A Larger Investment Package?"
 speerjapan.41.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt took a sip from his glass of water and gently placed it down on the table. It had already been a long day of negotiating. But it appeared he wasn't finished for the day just yet. "Look. What we have agreed upon already is a great accomplishment. I strongly believe, however, that further Japanese investment into the Reich's infrastructure would be even more beneficial to both of our nations. Any risk you may perceive in such investments, I assure you, only exists in the immediate term as we continue our ongoing recovery efforts from the internal conflict. As the Reich continues to regain its footing and reclaim its spot as the world's foremost economy, any hint of doubt regarding our situation will rapidly fade away. And, of course, such great economic collaboration now is guaranteed to foster strong economic ties between our nations in the future and improve the Empire of Japan's image in the eyes of the German people... and investors."\nReally? After the generous investment package that we had already offered, the German foreign minister asks Japan for more? The coy look on Schmidt's face provided no insight as to whether these investments would turn the easy profit he said they would. But it was possible he had a point... maybe there would be a substantial economic and diplomatic yield in the long run?"
 speerjapan.41.a:0 "There is no reason not to seize upon this opportunity."

 speerjapan.42.t:0 "A Delicate Request"
 speerjapan.42.desc:0 "Before any deal could be finalized, it was important to ensure that the Co-Prosperity Sphere's internal security would not be impacted by restoring trade with the Germans. An uncomfortable but necessary request would have to be made. A quick phone call asking to initiate negotiations regarding a new issue quickly summoned Foreign Minister Schmidt back to the negotiating table.\n"Foreign Minister, there is actually one more issue we wish to discuss. As you are no doubt aware, Japan is currently dealing with certain... rebellious elements in Indonesia. We have reason to believe that there may be certain foreign influence in Japan's internal affairs, and we would like certain assurances from Germany that you are, erm, doing everything in your power to prevent aid from reaching these traitors. We ask that all German ships travelling through Co-Prosperity Sphere waters be submitted to cargo checks prior to entry. Understand that this is essential to the Sphere's internal security, Herr Schmidt."\nSchmidt replied, "Searching every single vessel to pass through the Sphere's territorial waters could greatly hurt our profit margins and slow down our shipping... Of course, I understand why you ask this of us."\nOf course the Germans would not be happy about having their shipping inhibited, but there was no other choice."
 speerjapan.42.a:0 "Let's see how he responds"

 speerjapan.43.t:0 "Another Counterproposal"
 speerjapan.43.desc:0 ""It would be very difficult for Germany to make sufficient profits on exports to the Co-Prosperity Sphere if a bottleneck is created in your shipping lanes. But we do acknowledge your internal security concerns. How about we make official inspections of all cargo ships before they leave Germany to ensure that no materials are being smuggled in order to undermine Japanese sovereignty? We both get what we want: you maintain your national security and we maintain profitable trade and investments."\nThe counter-proposal made sense to Schmidt. But of course he was just trying to protect his own country's interests. Still, that he would so boldly try to slip Germany out of these shipping inspections was a grave insult to the Japanese delegation. How could he understand the troublesome position the Empire of Japan was in? Actually, if he knew how bad things were in Indonesia, he might even gain the upper hand in the negotiations. We would be weak to back up on our initial demands now, but it is not out of the question if we really want to show the Germans our desire to work with them."
 speerjapan.43.a:0 "I suppose we can give them the benefit of the doubt."
 speerjapan.43.b:0 "No. Let us inspect your ships or kiss our investments goodbye."

 speerjapan.44.t:0 "A Ridiculous Counterproposal"

In addition to performing our own cargo checks on shipping entering your waters, the Reich actually wishes to assist Japan in fending off American vessels sending aid to the Indonesian rebels. With our naval support, you can cover much more ground and more efficiently patrol for enemy supply ships."\nWas this some kind of sick joke? There was no way that the Germans were making this offer from the goodness of their hearts. Was there? Why on Earth would they offer their resources to protect Japanese waters? This was most likely a ploy to undermine Japan's security, and perhaps even to sneak through support to the Indonesian rebels themselves. The Japanese delegates sat silently, masking their rage and shock at hearing such a blatant diplomatic slap in the face. They did realize that Japan could in fact use the help that was being placed directly in front of them, but did they dare to assume that the Germans' audacious proposal was at all legitimate?"

Relations, of course, have been historically... strained, and as such, our technological cooperation has been all but non-existent. I propose we rectify this oversight, to the benefit of both our nations." The office, boring and immaculate, remained calm.

Even a softening of Japan's deal became a worthy price to pay for détente and friendship with the Reich's old accomplice. Economic dependence was something that could be justified in return for security, trade, technological development and all the other merits that allies bring.

Have a lovely remainder of your evening, and we will continue tomorrow," replied Schmidt with a casual smile on his face.\nHe had done it! He had secured what was, to him, the most important thing for the German people: an actual source of stimulus for the economy! Schmidt had realized there had been no need to push the Japanese on even more investment when he'd already successfully pushed them to increase the size of their investment package. He couldn't have risked the livelihoods of the workers and families of Germany on trying to net more than he had even bargained for.\nUpon informing Speer of the sealed deal, the Führer even had to reply, "Well done, Schmidt."

It would still slow down trade and hurt German profits, but it beat having ships being stopped for cargo checks in Japanese waters- that would have been a much worse bottleneck.\n\nEverything Schmidt did was in the name of improving the lives of the German people. If he had to make some concessions that would in the long run provide him more opportunities to help, then he would do it. Besides, the negotiations with the Japanese were far from over."

He didn't bother asking for any more than what had already been agreed upon, both because he didn't want to overreach and destroy the chance of any deal being signed, and because he didn't think he could stomach helping his or any country to make war more than he already had.\nThere was, however, no more time for Schmidt to ponder the morality of his actions. More negotiations with Japan would continue tomorrow, and maybe then he would get the chance to do something that would help instead of hurt the world."

He knew he was doing the right thing. Any help he could give to those who were bravely fighting against Japan's fascist hegemony over Asia was something to be proud of.\n\nSadly, Japan was enforcing a strict system of inspecting all German shipping entering the Sphere's waters, but sneaking a few small ships through with arms and RND agents was still doable.

This was exactly why Schmidt had suggested to Speer and the RND that only a few small, isolated black sites were set up across Indochina so that there was no way the Japanese would ever find them.\n\nSchmidt scanned the document nervously and let out a large sigh of relief. All of the planned sites had been smoothly created after the RND agents had secretly landed on various desolate beaches across the vast jungles of the region. Due to the caution that had been employed, they were disconnected and poorly supplied, but this was much better than nothing.\n\nNow he had to sit back and wait as the reports on the RND's activity gradually came in over the coming months.

We'd simply like you to reaffirm that you're not forgoing any of our pre-existing agreements and that you're not giving any special or preferable treatment to the Japanese."\n\n"Oh, is that what this is about? You can tell my friends in the White House they have absolutely nothing to worry about. Our new administration is simply opening the Reich up again to all sorts of foreign partnership opportunities. The Germany of isolation and conquest is no more, and that's all there is to it, Ambassador."

Lowering tariffs too much might mean that many newly established German companies might not be able to compete with the low prices of the massive Japanese corporations, causing many to go bankrupt.

Trading technology with Japan could allow us to study it and improve our own consumer focused innovation.\n\nHowever, as with industrial goods, we run the risk of growing overly reliant on Japan's technology which would allow them to have a greater sway over our regime."

erhardnomics.1.t:0 "Kartellgesetz"
erhardnomics.1.d:0 "Cigar smoke wafted strongly in the room as Ludwig Erhard flicked open a lighter to continue the trend of making it just a bit more difficult to breathe in the room. In front of the man with a plan, reading over a document, sat the Führer himself - Albert Speer. He had been holding a hand to the side of his head, occasionally stopping up to gaze at a certain piece of text before either sighing or rubbing his forehead and continuing.\n\n"Herr Erhard," the old Führer began, looking up at the Minister who seemed to look just a little bit happier when they met eye-to-eye. "This law of yours... the Kartellgesetz. How do you propose we push this through? After all, the most affected would be the four biggest companies in Germania. And..."\n\n"And what, my Führer?" Erhard calmly shot back, puffing the cigar and pulling it out of his mouth. "What would they do about it? Complain? Certainly, they would," Erhard stopped up, blowing out some smoke and taking another puff. "But consider this: They would practically be admitting to keeping each other in business in a big charade. And that..."\n\nA small grin approached his lips. "That wouldn't reflect so well on the 'Aryan' spirit, now would it?" He said, almost seeming to be mocking the notion of such a thing.\n\nSpeer glared at him as if Erhard just gutted an animal in front of him, but eventually took a deep breath, and then an even deeper sigh. "If you would be so kind as to listen," he strained, subconsciously pressing a thumb down on the document, "I can tell you that they have tools at their disposal. Allies. Influence. If we begin with something like this, then we run the risk of..."\n\nErhard chuckled, shutting the Führer up quickly. Throwing the used-up cigar out into a nearby trash bin, he simply crossed his arms and shook his head. "Hostility? Yes, but this is the easiest way to begin approaching them. If you don't want the Reich to be dominated by giant corporations that effectively run the state for you, my Führer, then I suggest that you take my suggestion, or I'm afraid that my ideas end here."\n\nSpeer wanted to say something. Something that could turn the case against Erhard, but there was nothing. If he hadn't had a medical check-up recently, he swore he would have felt an aneurysm coming. "And believe me, my Führer, I have a lot more than just the dismantlement of cartels in mind."\n\nThe old minister's gaze sharpened, and Speer felt like he could read exactly what the man had in mind."
erhardnomics.1.a:0 "What have I gotten myself into..."

erhardnomics.2.t:0 "The Reich's Needs"
erhardnomics.2.d:0 ""My Führer..." Erhard began, splaying his fingers out across the map of Europe, pointer finger placed on the heart of the Reich. "I understand that you have some incessant need to plunder the countries you control, but all that would lead into is a slow deterioration of relationships with the other Zollverein members." He looked up towards Speer, and saw the glint in his eyes. This wasn't good.\n\n"Herr Erhard, you should understand the main principle of this union between countries. It has never-" Erhard felt like he wanted to put a rip on the paper right where the capital was- "A benevolent, equal partnership." Speer put both of his hands on the table and looked down, then splayed one over the territories beyond the Reich. "These are territories we have conquered all fair and well in a war that we started. If there is anyone to be determining who gets what, it shall be us."\n\nThe minister licked his lips. He could've gone for a drink right about now. "Is that really it, my Führer? Just a sentimental want to..." There was no way Speer could have believed in only that, could he? "... My Führer, I hope you have a very good reason to stick to this tenant of National Socialism. The only road this can take us is down."\n\nSpeer took his hands off the table and clasped them behind him. "I don't know what you want to hear out of me, Herr Erhard, regarding this issue. I believe there never was an issue to begin with. The members of the Zollverein may not be happy about it, but they have nowhere else to turn to. In the end, they can only return to the Reich."\n\nErhard swallowed, taking concentrated breaths. "What is it that you want me to do now, then, my Führer?" He asked, nearly failing to conceal the anger in his voice.\n\n"Isn't it obvious?" He rhetorically asked. "I want you to alert Herr Kiesinger that the Reich's policy remains the same.""

erhardnomics.3.d:0 "The smoke that came into his view while staring through his binoculars confused him for a second before he realized that, no, Warschau wasn't burning, that was just the cigar in his mouth. Still, he was surprised that Speer rounded up enough political capital to get this many men out and this much equipment. Perhaps it was simply the sheer obviousness of his arguments? Erhard chuckled softly when he remembered how Speer tried to argue against reinvesting into Warschau and Kiew. Something vague about the Reich expressing strength by showing the Poles and Ukrainians that resistance was meaningless, but even then Erhard could have seen that he wasn't really believing the argument himself.\n\nNo - what was more likely was that Speer was a snake who thought that he could give a minimal damn about making the Reich seem to be more than just the crushing iron grip of Europa that needed to be removed. He was no National Socialist, certainly, but he could see sense to reason. Or perhaps he did, but was too afraid of the clutches of democracy? Erhard found that both funny and frustrating, but before he could continue looking at the construction project mobilizing men and equipment, he felt a shake on his shoulder.\n\n"Herr Erhard," the voice said, and it took him a moment to process that it was actually the project manager. "If I may ask, why Warschau and Kiew?"\n\nLowering his binoculars and turning his head, Erhard raised an eyebrow. "Besides being potential industrial heartlands? Well, I suppose there's another reason for it. These are some of the most hardest hit areas of Generalplan Ost, and starting here could perhaps earn us the goodwill of the non-Germans living in these areas." He could feel the cold gaze of the manager on him, only tamed by the fact that he was much higher up than the man.\n\n"Well?" Erhard started up again, returning his own glare. "Are you staring at me? Zoning out, perhaps?" He continued, voice filling with irritation and sarcasm.\n\nThe manager gave him no response, seemingly confused and worried by Erhard's words.\n\n"So? You're not? Out with it, then! Is it something you wish to say? Or do you perhaps have nothing to tell me? If not, then go! You have a project to be overseeing, don't you? Oversee it!"\n\nThe manager scrambled away. It took Erhard a solid minute to calm down after he left. What was he even thinking, starting dialogue with a man like that?"

But now they were here, Erhard drinking a small glass with strong alcohol while Schmidt was more modest, deciding on some wine instead. With a pleasant sigh, the minister of the economy spoke. "The resignation trick works every time. Really, I wasn't expecting him to be so asinine about it. It's like I was asking him to instate elections."\n\nSchmidt let out a short laugh. "No, God no, if it was like that I think he'd ask you to resign instead."\n\nErhard himself chuckled, and would have reached for a cigar had that not been allowed in the restaurant.\n\n"I suppose, however, that you can tell me more details about this plan of yours?" Schmidt asked, prompting Erhard to sober up a little and listen to what the Foreign Minister had to say.\n\n"Yes," Erhard began, nodding. "It's quite simple, it's just that the plan will take a long time to implement. I'm aiming for Germany's colonies to industrialize sufficiently, you see." Schmidt nodded. "If we want them to stand as partners, they can't be so reliant on the old home that any economic crises would make them buckle and crack, just as it happened in the fifties. Instead, you're going to, with my help, turn all of those colonies into shining, rich jewels. Not on par with Germany itself, but at least enough to be a little self sufficient."\n\nSchmidt nodded again - this time more clearly satisfied. A smile graced his lips as he spoke.\n\n"But what of the consequences? What if they demand independence?"\n\n"We'll give it to them," Erhard stated flatly. "Eventually. If Speer isn't a fool, he'll let us build the base to feasibly stop exploiting them. If he is a fool, however..." Erhard sighed."

If we do that, all we're setting ourselves up for is a future failure of our sphere." His words stung cruelly, and Speer relented on uttering a swear before turning to look to Helmut Schmidt. "And you?" Speer asked, voice tightened somewhat. Schmidt nodded politely, then showed a hand towards Erhard. "He's right, my Führer. If we decide not to liberalize the Zollverein, then we'd be running the risk of eventually turning the members turning against us. Just look at Japan and its sphere as an example. The tensions between the members and Japan are palpable."\n\nWas Speer really hearing this? Now two out of the four members of the Gang were nearly directly coercing him into following through with their demands. And if he decided to raise a voice? Protest? Then only the obvious would have followed. Letting the air in the room stay thin for a few seconds more, he finally decided to speak. "Erhard." He stated, turning his gaze to the man. "Let's say we do liberalize the Zollverein. In the future, what's to stop them from dreaming about detaching themselves from the Reich? To pursue a light at the end of the tunnel? After all, if we are so benevolent now, then the implication would be that we can continue this benevolence for the future. And this... would not bode well for the Reich."\n\nErhard's eyes narrowed, and his teeth grazed against the skin of the cigar just a little bit harder. Taking it out his mouth, he sighed. "My Führer, you have it backwards. I understand that you hold a more traditionalist position on this, but it doesn't mean that everyone that isn't Ge-- the Reich, is unreasonable. But for exactly the reason you initially described is why they would not leave us." Speer leaned back, stare softening only slightly. "After all, what do they gain out of leaving a mutually-beneficial partnership? Pride?" Erhard shook his head. "They already lost that a while ago. They would have only to gain by staying, and nothing by losing. This," he paused, taking a puff of his cigar, "Would only happen if you let this reform pass." An air of silence passed between them for many seconds. Both men in front of the Führer wondered what he planned on staying-- before he pushed his chair back and stood up. The expression on his face spoke a thousand words."

A company that serves as a true testament to Abs' profit-driven motives, and the costs that come with it.\n\nIG Farben is a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate. On a surface level, it is nothing more than a conglomerates, pulling its strings across all of the Reich, its colonies, and further abroad than that. Under the helm of Hermann Josef Abs, it has risen to become one of the most powerful actors within the government, not only having wide scale influence in large parts of the Einheitspakt, but fielding their own private mercenary company, as well as a heavy, if not total, reliance on brutal slave labor. Having reaped the rewards of a victorious Reich, Abs has certified his reputation of what it is to be successful as a German. Out and active, he has crafted a carefully-made image of an apolitical yet loyal businessman, serving the interests of the Reich.\n\nYet under the guise of an honorable and capable man lies a bloody history driven by a single desire. Hermann Josef Abs, under the wraps, is an incredibly cunning and ruthless man. It can be safely claimed that his economic empire stretches from sea to shining sea, and that his business acumen remains one of the most unrivalled in the whole world. His reach extends to every continent, and IG Farben only remains to be one of the many companies under his repertoire, with many more scattered around the world.\n\nIn the homeland, however, is where Abs makes his capital, and something can clearly be said about IG Farben and its shadow ruler - it is a threat. A threat not only politically and economically, but morally as well. It stands as a testament of success to relying on slave labor-- an idea unworkable in the long run, yet here it stood as a shining jewel in a pile of riches. If Erhard is to collapse this rotten structure from the inside out, all his genius would be for naught if not firstly invested into the largest threat that stands before him. A titan which will force Germany to bend under a system that cannot hold forever.\n\nHermann Josef Abs is a force."

In fact, quite the opposite. If the minister played his cards right, he could potentially get a powerful ally on his side.\n\nBut that's not to say that they're completely innocent.

This time, they shouted in unison.\n\n"SIR, YES, SIR!"\n\nHowever, what would have been a simple interrogation process turned out to be much more. When the sergeant went up to announce to the guards that the factory was being seized, that's when he spotted it. They weren't normal security guards. They wore a set of all-too-familiar clothing, and a bullet struck his combat helmet before he dropped to the ground and yelled into his radio that a firefight had begun.\n\nIt wasn't a very long firefight. Half an hour later, and the noise had died down into a strange silence. "Men? Report casualties." The radio crackled back soon after.\n\n"Sir, we have two dead and five wounded." He felt a pang of anger strike his heart. "Goddamn SS," he muttered, turning over one with his boot to see the symbol of the Schutzstaffel emblazoned on his chest. "Of all the companies in the world, these traitors employ these assholes." Spitting on the man's red-tinted shirt, he opened up the radio channel again. "How many slaves are wounded, soldier?" He asked, and the reply he got unnerved him, even if he didn't care much about the slaves. "It's a bloodbath in here, sir. It seems like the SS started firing on the slaves after they initiated a firefight with us. It's... there's not many of them left, sir.""

No, now that was going to be a thing of the past, something to be looked at in shame. At least, he hoped that's how history would treat it. Whatever road it would go didn't matter in the moment, however, as he looked over an analysis of who owned what in the Einheitspakt.\n\nA chuckle escaped his lips as he took a puff from his cigar. Before, entire regions of Germany and its partners would be shaded in solid colours, but now? Now only one colour dominated the battlefield, and those four conglomerates that were left were reduced to nothing but small dots and sometimes even stripes to indicate conflicted ownership. Staring at the map for a moment longer, Erhard nodded to himself. With his economics plan put into full force, he knew that the people - and, most importantly, the middle class - would thrive from this change of pace.\n\nWhen Erhard eventually left his office, he took a slight detour and made sure to pass where Speer was currently residing, just to take a look at the man's expression. With only a quick stop by the door, he could glance at the man shuffling papers, his face showing only uncertainty. Erhard felt satisfied with what he saw, and left before Speer could notice the minister laying about. With another puff of the cigar, Erhard smiled to himself."

Now he could do it knowing that he wouldn't have something looming over his mind as he did. The vehicle in question was Mercedez-Benz W108 vehicle. It was a few years old at this point, and there were other choices available to him, but this car struck him out as pleasing to the eye, and, as he rode in the streets of Germania, felt the quality of its build on the concrete streets. These cars weren't built with trembling slave hands. Instead the design was constructed by a healthy, paid German, one who specifically studied and prepared for that sort of job.\n\nNot only that, this car he bought did not come from some far-reaching company that employed millions upon millions of slaves. Instead, it was by a factory sold off to a middle-class family at the behest of the government. And to really drive the point home, Erhard made sure that anything built by German hands alone would be specifically marked as being such. If his plan blossomed fully, that would mean that eventually, that label would apply to every German product.\n\nStepping out of the car in the parking lot, Erhard looked over the vehicle once again. This could be sold abroad, even - fall into the hands of an American family that could appreciate German technicality repurposed for more benevolent means. He was almost certain that Speer would look at him with a worried expression if he said that out loud, but at least he would consider the proposal of exporting German goods to beyond just the Einheitspakt.\n\nWith the theorizing done with, Erhard began his service of the Reich that morning.

For what he lacks in size, Flick makes up for it by cutting through the stock market and working company-owned slaves for every last drop of blood. He is merciless, and a prime example of a Nazi brought into the modern generation. But that is not why he is so dangerous.\n\nIn Erhard's eyes, being connected to the black heart of Europe known as Ordensstaat-Burgund is already a horrific sin. Flick, however, goes above and beyond that, being a man who has direct ties to the abomination that leads the whole project - Heinrich Himmler. Not only that, but Erhard knows that he has directly supported the cause of the SS with monetary compensation. And so, in order to further the Einheitspakt of the devilish ideology known as the Burgundian System, Erhard must strike hard at Friedrich Flick and his empire."

Then, from the group of five, it was the most powerful Wehrwirtschaftsführer, Hermann Josef Abs, who spoke. "Say, then, Herr Erhard," he began, cutting into his finely-made steak. "The tide turns strongly, doesn't it? In just a few years short, we've gone from our old Führer to something fresh and exciting."\n\nAnother, Friedrich Flick, the Wehrwirtschaftsführer of Daimler-Benz, shot him a glare, but Abs merely ignored it.\n\n"Oh," Erhard began, downing a shot glass. "I agree. I like our new direction. Now, if I may call to attention why I brought you all here in the first place." All eyes landed on Erhard - from Abs, to Flick, to the silent Edmund Geilenberg and the curious Ernst von Siemens. "As you're aware, the Speer administration will be doing a multitude of things. Reforming the army, strengthening the economy, loosening up diplomacy, and maybe laxing a few laws of old here and there. That's all well and good, but my personal interests lies in the problem that's faced Germany for decades. I'm sure you all know what that is."\n\nThe air seemed to still around them. Geilenberg spoke first. "I will hazard a guess that this is about the slaves," He bluntly stated, and Erhard's smile merely grew.\n\n"Correct, my friend. All of your companies-" Abs' steady supply of smoke from his cigar stopped. "Well, to make it easy to understand, they're going to be dismantled." The group collectively tensed up, and while Siemens was the least tense, Flick seemed like he was on the verge of rage.\n\n"I knew I shouldn't have come here!" He shouted, kicking away his chair and standing up. "This folly of ruining my business. Erhard, I won't let you take away a percentage of my workforce! Not when I have anything to say about it!"

So when they met, it was during a walk in the Volkshalle, traversing the cold, long and massive halls of that place as they spoke.\n\n"Go over your plan again, will you?" Speer asked, and Kiesinger found it simple to oblige.\n\n"It's a several-step plan. In no particular order, I would like to deal with three issues. First, it is difficult to keep conquests held, especially if it is from people that hold contempt from us. Wouldn't you agree?" He asked, and Speer gave a wary nod. "I propose a solution. We can either reform the Reichskommissariats into natively-organized collaborationist governments, or turn them into Reichsländers. These would be a more... separate-but-equal deal. Not preferable, and potentially unstable, though it would please the conservatives."\n\nSpeer flicked open his lighter for a cigarette. "The other two problems?"\n\nKiesinger nodded.

speer.502.d:0 "In the early 1940s, with our war industry unable to rally enough hands to maintain supply of new goods and equipment, we turned to the one resource we had in quantity that remained unspent: flesh. Millions of prisoners - Untermenschen, POWs, political enemies - occupied the concentration camps, being worked to death or starved to no end beyond extermination. As Armaments Minister, Albert Speer gave them a different fate entirely: to work, day and night and unto death, in the German war machine. Rather than breaking rocks and being tortured at the whim of SS guards, they would work the forges and assemble tools of death for the Wehrmacht.\n\nIt seemed like a good idea at the time. Most men of fighting age were enlisted or conscripted to fight the plutocratic democracies of the West or the Bolshevik menace of the East. With women relegated to more appropriate roles, we were in desperate need for hands - any hands - in our factories. Without the mass employment of forced labor, we could not have produced the mountain of armaments that allowed us to crush our foes with an ease that no capitalist economy could have matched. Slave-forged tanks, guns and planes were as essential to our victory as strong German souls.\n\nHowever, slavery has grown completely out of control. No longer constrained by the state, our industrial leaders have developed a monopoly on the use of slavery, locking most of the German populace out of blue-collar jobs. Even agriculture has no room for free workers, as Prussian land magnates rent tens of thousands of slaves on the cheap from corporations like Reichswerke and IG Farben. For this plague on the Reich to end, the power of the conglomerates must be permanently broken and the deprived masses set free - no matter the cost."

The more ground we give, the more we legitimize it, and that's the one thing we must avoid at all costs. They'll expect a dozen concessions for every single man and woman set free. We can't have any of that. If Speer doesn't have the backbone to go for their throats, we'll do it ourselves."\n\nKiesinger looked equally bemused and weary. "I can't help but notice you've already turned this into a joint effort on our part, Ludwig. Remember that if one of us goes down, so does the entire cabinet."\n\nErhard stubbed out his cigar in the fancy brass ashtray on his desk and smirked grimly. "That's exactly the idea behind this push. Remember, we still have a dictator on our side. Yes, this will kill relations between the state and industrial leaders, but that's what we want.

speer.505.d:0 "After a great deal of debate - often fueled by alcohol and conducted in a haze of cigar smoke - the Führer and his cabinet have finalized the solution to the long-standing question of slavery. As anyone knows, the approximately 40 million slaves in the Reich cannot simply be granted manumission en masse and set free. That would result in little more than social and economic chaos across Europe, along with a great deal of bloodshed.\n\nThe first and most pressing concern is of course the nationalization of slavery. As long as slaves remain private property, they remain vulnerable to excessive exploitation and the whims of uncaring industrial corporations. Placing them under the exclusive stewardship of the Reich Government will ensure that they are well protected and given more humane treatment - an important step in rehabilitating our image as a more benevolent empire.\n\nThe second step is repatriation. The overwhelming majority of slaves are Slavs, predominantly of Polish and Ukrainian origin. Thankfully, we have extensive records of the slave system and can track each and every one of them. Starting shortly after their nationalization, the slaves will begin to be organized and sent back to the countries of origin in a steady stream. Though slow at first, we expect this 'Rückführungsprogramm' to pick up speed as the freed slaves become more cooperative and see that our intentions are true."

That, as most of the populace could tell you, was a futile endeavour.\n\n"I hadn't realized during the war," Weber recalled, "That the corporations on the home front would be so exploitative and cruel. I wholly believed in the Führer's promise that they were at his beck and call. Perhaps they were for a time, but when I returned home they had no work to offer. Not for myself, my family or my friends. Two men from my unit - men who had lived through both Barbarossa and the West Russian War - committed suicide because they could find no purpose in their daily lives once the Wehrmacht no longer needed them. Their old employer had been bought out by IG Farben in the early 50s."\n\nAs I spoke to him recently, I never would have thought that his life was ever so difficult. A few years ago, Herr Weber was living off the pittance that his pension would grant him; now, he is a proud greengrocer who runs his own business (pictured below). Here, he sells fresh produce from local farms, turning enough of a profit that he was recently able to purchase a home for his family. They now live in a modest but splendid country home just outside of Stuttgart.\n\n"Of course, I owe all of this to the new Führer," Weber told me with a smile.

He wondered if a Russian leader had found some humor in the same idea he found just now.\n\nHe eventually stood up, walked around his desk, and out of his office, absentmindedly going through the corridors of the Chancellery, thinking about the things he and his government were free to do now that those people of the likes of Schörner would finally be out of here.\n\nHe stopped by a portrait of Adolf Hitler, studying him in a more civilian attire.

Small- and medium-sized businesses were the bedrock of the German economy right up until Hitler started handing out government contracts to the Party's biggest donors. We all know how that turned out. We've put a lot of effort into building a middle class - they'll be crucial to our new policies.

Like a cursed mirror reflecting the evil within the hearts of men, identical defences can be seen on the German side.\n\nIn the end, the German attack never came, as the Reich collapsed under its own weight like a clay-footed goliath, but the fortifications remained, and even now, thousands of Italians and Germans look at each other from the ramparts, the ingenuity of such fortifications only surpassed by the hate they were built with, as if the very concrete echoed the feelings of betrayal and anger of the Italian people."

speer.515.t:0 "Approaching the Swiss"
speer.515.d:0 "The embassy of the Swiss Confederation is like an island of tranquility in a storm-wracked sea. Ever since the Battle of Marignano in 1515, which saw its entire army annihilated by a vengeful Republic of Venice aided by the French, Switzerland has observed a policy of strict neutrality, enshrined in 1815 after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. This, however, didn't stop the Swiss from taking interest in the rest of the world, at first by selling their soldiers to a Europe in constant war, and then by developing what is perhaps the largest banking system in the world. Respected by all, and equally distant from all, the Swiss government ensures that war stays as far as possible from its idyllic mountain paradise.\n\nAs he reads the latest reports from Schmidt, who is desperately fighting against the diplomatic equivalent of an incendiary bombing perpetrated by the Italian delegation, Albert Speer can't help sighing. Why did he agree to such onslaught? If not for the sake of working with the Gang of Four, he never would have wasted time in such an endeavor, one which will most likely end in failure. Still, he has been dragged inside this mess, and now he has to help his Minister against an enemy who wields diplomacy with the same skill their ancestors in the Italian city-states did centuries before: one third high culture and fine wines, another one charisma and sharp words, and the final third daggers and poison hidden behind a smile.\n\nPutting down the report, he reaches for the phone and enters the number. After a few seconds, an overly-eager voice answers: "Your Excellency, what an unexpected call! What can I do for you?" to which the Führer replies: "Ambassador Chenaux-Repond, I call you for that matter you mentioned to Reichsminister Schmidt last week. The Reich would be interested in expanding Swiss banking operation within Brandenburg, but in exchange, I have to ask you to act as a mediator in our current diplomatic talks with the Italian Empire." Immediately comes the answer: "I will inform the Federal Council of your most generous offer at once, Your Excellency. Please wait until tomorrow." and then the call ends."

The conservatives, on the other hand, refuse to humiliate the Reich by granting the Italian Empire the upper hand, and insist for token concessions which will nonetheless please their delegation. Finally, the Führer himself is trying to act as a mediator, and could find a middle ground in substantial concessions, but nothing major.\n\nStill, the arguments from all sides are very convincing: the matter is now in the leader's hands, in what direction will the helmsman decide to steer his ship?"

Their homes, too. The Bohemian Orpo reported seeing Schmidt in Prague this morning, but nothing more. Herr Gehlen has suggested that they've fled the country after..." he cleared his throat. "After the direction your last conversation took."\n\nSpeer could barely force himself to speak. "You are dismissed," he mumbled. As the secretary left his office, the enormity of the blow struck the Führer like a hammer in the gut. The Gang of Four was no more. Just like that, they had walked away from his grand project, from the promise of a better future for the Reich. There would be no more economic reform, no more charming the NSDAP, no more keeping the Wehrmacht in line and no more hope for positive relations with the rest of the world. It didn't seem real. Surely it couldn't end like this?\n\nHis phone rang, startling him out of his fugue state. He paused for a moment before lifting the receiver to his ear and steadying his voice. "Hello?"\n\n"My Führer," came the gravelly, condescending voice of Hermann Josef Abs. "I hear you're in need of some assistance with your economic policy.

erhardgo4.1.d:0 "Smoke had long since displaced any clean air in the room, despite the cracked windows. The meeting had overshot its expected length by over an hour, and Erhard showed no signs of stopping the torrent of figures that somehow poured from his mouth while he chewed his cigar. Even those with more of a head for figures had begun to tune out - Speer's eyes glanced towards the others seated at the table. The various hangers-on were frantically flicking through papers, trying to keep up. Kiesinger was doing his best to appear interested but Albert recognised the glassy look in his eyes. Reichsminister Schmidt was making his own way through the tome Erhard had provided, tilting his head and nodding at some paragraph incomprehensible to human eyes. The Führer redirected his attention back to the economist as he seemed to be coming to the end of some point.\n\n"...tax exceptions and exemptions abolished, tax deductions reduced drastically, and the implementation of a true fixed rate income tax."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows raised at this sentence. "You know as well as I do that our industry relies on those tax breaks, Friedrich. The Reichswerke reinvested half of what they saved on new equipment this year. How much are you proposing for this tax?"\n\nReichsminister Erhard took another drag of his cigar, worked it about his mouth and exhaled across the table. "Forty percent."\nAt that, slumped necks straightened and eyes refocused. Speer coughed, and not because of the smoke. "That's... ridiculous." he settled on, unable to think of a better word. "IG Farben alone will have my head. They've been paying less than twenty since the war."\n\nFriedrich didn't appear ruffled, just inhaled more smoke. "Ridiculous it may seem, mein Führer, but I can assure you it is quite sound. The people have been holding the burden of taxation for decades. Regressive tax policies may expand industries, but they have become bloated. Forcing the industrial conglomerates to pay what they owe while allowing the people to spend more will force a new equilibrium, one they'll appreciate far more than those fat slaving bastards at Farben did."\n\nThe Führer once again took stock of the room. Schmidt's eyes had brightened, and his nods turned from the paper to Speer. Generalfeldmarschall von Tresckow looked sceptical but kept his thoughts to himself. Deputy Führer Kiesinger leaned over to Schmidt, hoping to glean some of his knowledge."

erhardgo4.2.d:0 ""Telephone for you, mein Führer."\n\nSpeer glanced up, ready to deliver a rebuke at being interrupted mid sentence, before he realised he had been expecting this call. There were few others who could demand a conversation with the Führer in this manner. He sighed, and gestured for the phone. The ministers sat about the table looked variously confused and intrigued - save for Erhard. He simply leaned forward in his chair.\n\nSpeer held the receiver to his ear. "Speaking."\n\n"Mein Führer," the voice drawled, barely pronouncing the honorific before turning to business. "I'm sure these new tax rates haven't escaped your attention. They must be corrected at once."\n\nIG Farben may have been the biggest name on Herr Abs' business card but it would certainly be pressed for space. Close to fifty of the Reich's largest businesses boasted him on their board of directors. Few others could speak to Speer so brusquely.\n\nThe Führer looked down at the tax papers that decorated the table this very moment. He wasn't remotely surprised they'd leaked, considering the magnitude of IG Farben's influence. "Hermann. You called at an ideal time." Not a hint of sarcasm showed on his face, though a hint of a smirk tugged at Erhard's lip. "We were going through the plans, and your input would be appreciated."\n\n"Then you can sweep them off your desk. You know damned well what those tax breaks do for us, and you can be sure everyone in my phone book will know they're going by the end of the day." The phone went dead.\n\nReichsminister Erhard chuckled. It seemed like he didn't need to know what Abs had said. "If I may mein Führer, I don't think it necessary to respond. The opinion of a man like him is not something you need to worry about.""

He had directed his Ministry to spend the last week gathering this data - Gauleiters did not appreciate intrusion into their affairs, preferring to think of themselves more as lords to be left to their own. Once gathered it was just as monumental a task to sort through, but for the knowledge he gained he would pay any price.\n\nThe Führer had proved more easily moved than he had expected. Perhaps he was sincere after all - one does not ignore the richest man in the Reich on a whim. The numbers didn't lie, and while there had been a short term income drop it had been more than made up for by the sudden and vast flow of currency between the hands of the Reich's citizens. One Mark is not one Mark but many, holding value for every transaction it is used in, and taking the money out of the pockets of men like Hermann Josef Abs was a good deed in itself. They could complain, but if things kept going this way their oligopolies would be on the way out."

The economy will bounce back, people will spend more, small business will become profitable once again! What hold does he have over you, damnit?"\n\nAlbert recalled a moment, back as Minister of Armaments and War Production. He had to fight to hold the position of course - Hitler didn't tolerate anyone who couldn't carve out their own sphere. It required ambition and ruthlessness. The first, he had known he had. The second, not so much.\n\n"I've heard excellent things, Herr Speer. Your designs for the camps have been most impressive."\n\n"Thank you, Herr Himmler. The true trouble was acquiring more workers, of course, but Sauckel has proven most resourceful. If events proceed as planned, we should see upwards of a million voluntary labourers from the east.

erhardgo4.5.t:0 "Erhard's Demands - Flat Income Tax"
erhardgo4.5.d:0 ""What the fuck do you mean he did it anyway?" A vein throbbed in the Führer's forehead. His grip on the telephone tightened. Kiesinger quietly took in the office until Speer gave an exasperated sigh and put down the phone with more force than was necessary.\n\n"Erhard has announced this tax plan of his to half the damned Reichstag."\n\nAs the Führer leaned back in his chair, Kurt commented "Ludwig is like a dog with a bone with these things, but this is far even for him."\n\nSpeer rubbed at his eyes. "Economists are more trouble than they're worth. The whole economy is more trouble than it's worth. Tell them it's cancelled, tell them it was a spy, I don't care, just shut him up before he does any more damage."\n\n"Albert... I'll admit I was sceptical, but this plan of his has merit. People need this kind of change, and reining him in now may be far more trouble than it's worth. And men like Abs need kicking down. "Speer's mind flicked back, fifteen years perhaps? The Volkshalle dome, his magnum opus. Twenty companies selling materials. Four selling people - Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs. Abs had shares in every one of them. How many were buried in foundations?"

One of the greatest slave owners in human history? Fuck him." A scowl had built on Erhard's face, and he ground his cigar out into the ashtray.\n\nSpeer blinked. An ugly look built behind his eyes. "The hell are you talking about? I am your Führer. You do not resign without my say so. You do not do anything without my say so. You will fix this." The Führer spat the last sentence. The other around the table glanced about - it was only the inner circle now. Erhard was at the opposite end of the long table for once. Kiesinger and Schmidt sat in the centre, opposite another. They were each alternating glances between the economist and their Führer. Generalfeldmarschall von Tresckow stood by the window smoking a cigarette.\n\n"I am fixing this. I am trying to fix the mess of the past 20 years of mismanagement. And if you won't let me do that, I don't know why the hell any of us are here."\n\nKiesinger and Schmidt had both raised their heads, but it was von Tresckow who spoke first. "He's right." Henning paused, giving Speer and Erhard a chance to break their locked gaze. "You're here because people believe the Reich should be different. If you don't give them that - if they think you are just like Bormann, or Göring? You'll be swinging from a gibbet with the rest of us."\n\nThe normally turbulent atmosphere of the room calmed as each of them imagined the scene."

There was a decanter of brandy on the luxuriously lacquered desk, which the Führer was willingly partaking in.\n\nErhard had announced his resignation earlier that day. Even if Speer wanted to stop him going he couldn't have - and why would he? He had defied every order he had given him. Still, the man had been good at his job. Schmidt and Kiesinger had apparently retired for the day, and somehow Albert didn't think they would be far behind. He couldn't have Erhard killed, not now, and without them? He'd always been an outlier in the party. Hitler had sheltered him while he'd built his little sphere, but without him he relied on men like Tresckow to keep the army happy, or Erhard to fix this bloated mess that was his Reich.\n\nNow he was all alone."

erhardgo4.8.t:0 "Erhard's Demands - Minimum Wage"
erhardgo4.8.d:0 "Speer scratched his chin and looked sideways again at the proposal laid out on his desk. "I don't understand, Herr Erhard," he said into the receiver. "I thought economics didn't like the idea of minimum wages. What are you advocating them for?"\n\nErhard's voice, even through the phone, was coarse, bold and full of pomp. "We aren't unified in that position, my Führer. Indeed, I think it's probably essential to furthering our economic recovery."\n\nThe Führer began tapping one finger on his desk, a nervous tic he'd acquired from many a heated debate with Erhard. "Well... Herr Erhard, I do respect your expertise, but if you're in the minority that makes your position on this tenuous. That's to say nothing of what the industrial leaders will think of it."\n\n"The industrialists?" Speer could hear the sarcasm coming. "Oh, I'm sure, my Führer. I'm sure the industrialists - the men who've grown rich from not having to pay their workers at all - have a far more well-considered perspective on this than your hand-picked economic minister."\n\n"Spare me, Erhard," Speer sighed. "Just explain your reasoning."\n\nThe old man wasted no time. "As long as we lack a minimum wage, we face a twofold problem. First, the people won't have any confidence in the jobs being offered to them. Why go looking for work when it will barely make a difference to your income in the first place? Second, right now our economy needs to be shifting goods and that can't happen if consumers lack purchasing power. Follow through with this plan and you'll see the difference in mere weeks."\n\nSpeer's finger stopped. The logic was sound... but what would the corporations think? Surely they knew a thing or two about economics - if they opposed this so stringently, could there be some merit to their arguments? "Thank you, Herr Erhard," he replied after a few moments. "I'll consider your proposal.""

IG Farben has had their board members calling me all morning demanding to know what we're up to! They'd have been happier if I'd declared myself a communist!"\n\nErhard waited for the Führer to quiet down and lean back in his chair. "And what about the common man, my Führer? What does he think? What about the students, or your supporters in the Reichstag?"\n\nSpeer looked mortally offended for a brief moment before gritting his teeth and responding. "The Reich doesn't operate according to the wishes of the mob. I understand the dangers that kowtowing to the corporations poses, but-"\n\n"Oh, fuck the corporations!" bellowed Erhard, shooting upright with hands planted on the table, nearly biting his cigar in two. "Do you honestly think they have the Reich's interests at heart? They've grown fat on the profits that slavery offers - our economic situation is at least fifty percent their fault exclusively! If they hadn't been given carte blanche on German industry and put in a position to back your opposition, you wouldn't have faced such stiff resistance in the first place!"\n\nFor the most powerful dictator on Earth, Speer suddenly felt very small. "Don't raise your voice to..."\n\nErhard's next words cut to the bone. "Our dear friend Benito once said that to make a people great, you have to send them into battle even if you need to kick them in the pants. The same's true even for a Führer! If you know what's best for Germany and its people, you'll heed MY advice and not that of some bloated, psychopathic slave-driver. Good day, Herr Speer.""

Kiesinger's inoffensive voice cut through the fog of Speer's thoughts, prompting him to glance up. The Deputy Führer was relaxed and cheerful-looking, not to mention entirely too correct in his assessment to yell at. "The Party's economists are all too politicized or corrupt to stand up for what the Reich and its people need."\n\n"I suppose," Speer grumbled, going back to his reading. "He's not the one who's been dealing with the backlash from executives and shareholders, though."\n\nKiesinger leaned forward onto the desk, hands folded, to get Speer's attention again. "Isn't that a price worth paying? Isn't having a few angry men to put in line a lot better than having the entire working class starve because they continue to live off the state's loose change?"\n\nThe Führer felt a little less tense suddenly, but was careful not to show it. "Yes, well... yes, it is. I suspect we'll feel the political repercussions for some time yet, though." He downed the last survey and looked straight at Kiesinger.

"What do you think? He's gone to the Reich Chancellery to give Speer a piece of his mind. No, he didn't want to wait for us."\n\nKiesinger felt a bead of sweat drip down his temple and his neck start to prickle. "I'll head down there myself right away."

A few different streams of thought ran through his mind. Had he definitely said no? Did he actually approve the proposal and just forget about it? Maybe Erhard was working to undermine him. How could he? Or maybe... maybe he wasn't. Maybe this was a good thing. But Erhard had disobeyed him. But maybe he was wrong?

Assuring that if people work in these times they'll get money is now considered to be against the 'National Socialist spirit'?!"\n\nSpeer grit his teeth hard. Of course Erhard saw through it. He should have come up with some better excuse - an actual reason to keep the minimum wage abolished. Well, there was one. "Herr Erhard, this is a broad law that we would have to implement all over Germany. Are you expecting us to fine every single business that doesn't follow this rule to the letter?"\n\n"Yes. And as a matter of fact," Erhard puffed his cigar one last time before it became useless to him, "if you believe that the Reich isn't capable of doing such a thing, you can count me out of any of your future economic ventures. I'll take my chances elsewhere."\n\nHe really had to decide here and now, didn't he?

Then he turned to Speer.\n\n"My Führer," he said with a salute. When he let his hand down, he said, "I must encourage you to repeal it. We cannot lower the draft now. It would weaken our army!"\n\nTresckow turned to Speer and told him, "No, my Führer. Lowering the draft will help our army."\n\n"It will not, von Tresckow! The army needs more men at this moment. Our Fatherland needs more men."\n\n"For what? We are not in great need of manpower now."\n\n"That doesn't matter. We must maintain our numbers," Schörner told him. He glanced back at his Führer. "My Führer, I must insist against it."\n\n"You're suggesting that now? I just approved it," Speer replied, hoping it would discourage him.\n\n"It will be difficult, but it's a smaller price to pay than having to put up with the loss of strength in numbers!"\n\n"That is something we can make up for in the quality of our men and our officers. We do not need a multitude of men!"\n\n"All right, both of you have a point," Speer interrupted, seeking to put an end to this and get his cup of coffee. He sighed at them and said..."

Though he felt the muscles in his face pulling at him with displeasure, he still wanted to push the Führer into reconsidering what he wanted for the army, for the people, and for the state.\n\nAnd with the way he was going for it, the rest of the cabinet joined in, much to the delight of Schörner. They began to raise their voices, to speak up more and more as Speidel finally spoke up.\n\n"Keeping this many men in our army is going to strain the capacities of our country. It will push us to the very limits of our abilities. And keeping so much under the watch of our officers now would force them to compromise the quality of training for the sake of accommodating the excess. It will mean a disaster for us in war if we have more men than our officers could lead."\n\nTresckow also added, "The country cannot continue living with this kind of system. While it is understandable that we keep an army that stands ready for the Fatherland, it is more understandable that we keep that army at its best. We must not compromise its standards. My Führer, please consider the benefits. They are worth more than an army larger than we'd want it to be."\n\nThe Führer himself listened to them, but sighed at the end of their words, simply exasperated at their continued attempts to get him to reconsider Tresckow's request."

The Führer was understandably relieved to see that he could relax after all of that had happened despite his earlier reluctance. He enjoyed his cup of coffee which he so wanted before, just as the rest of his cabinet enjoyed their victory in seeing this pass.\n\nSchmidt and Erhard both pulled out their cigarette and their cigar to quietly celebrate this victory for their partner in the Army, much to the light displeasure of the Führer. Tresckow and Speidel respectfully gave their thanks to the Führer for keeping his word. It ended in their favor, and it was only appropriate for them to give some credit to their leader, no matter how reluctant he was.\n\nOnly Schörner fumed, unwilling to stand being in the same room as those who opposed him and with a Führer who let him down. In a huff, he stormed out of the Chancellery, much to the subtle joy of those who wished to spite him.\n\nAnd when news came to the German people about the lowered draft, there was much reason for them to rejoice. Families and friends were happy to know that their sons would not have to give up a part of their lives to serve the Fatherland. Although the conservative elements of the country eventually gave their protests against this new policy, there was nothing to stop the tide of joy that swept over the people."

Schörner had not noted them.\n\nThe Foreign Minister was the first to speak up. "So you're just going to shoot down what he has suggested? Just like that?" He shook his head at Speer, perplexing the man because of the way he said that.\n\nThe Führer told him, "Don't question it, Schmidt. Schörner had a point."\n\n"Indeed he has. But I don't agree. Tresckow had a better point. There's no point in wasting resources on maintaining a large army. Our country needs less force."\n\n"And our country needs more people to work with. For the sake of the economy!" Erhard joined in. Soon Kiesinger stood.\n\n"I stand with my colleagues. My Führer, you must reconsider."\n\nSpeidel nodded to this, keeping himself quiet as Tresckow spoke up once more, "My Führer, please, it must not be ignored. You must consider the benefits of lowering the draft. It will pay off much more than leaving it as it is now."\n\nSchörner bit at his lower lip and turned to Speer.

So cleanly written, spirit laced with discipline and rolling through the letters with the stereotypical German efficiency that was lacking these days. His eyes looked up from the paper and towards the man, who looked no older than 25, yet seemed to possess a capacity and capability unmatched by many that arrive from the academy.\n\n"Say," he began, setting the paper down. "This almost writes like a poem. I'm surprised you haven't been promoted earlier." The praise gave the officer a shot of excitement and a slight smile. "Though I notice something. Your surname... are you..." He raised an eyebrow. "Related to General Graebner?"\n\nThe young man shook his head. "No, sir. I'm an adopted relative."\n\nTresckow nodded. "Can you tell me how old you are? It doesn't say on your paper, oddly enough."\n\nWith slight confusion, the man still answered with haste. "I'm thirty-one years old, sir."\n\nThe old marshal now put his hands together, eyebrows furrowing. "I... see." A suspicion crept up in his mind. "Do you know why you haven't been promoted? From what I've read, you seem more than fit to continue climbing up the ranks."\n\nTo that, the officer simply scratched his head. "I'm not sure, sir. I've only heard that it's been difficult to process my review paper. I was told that I would have to wait an extended period of time before having it be submitted. Roughly two-to-three months. It's..." He sighed. "Taken two years, however. So I'm glad to finally be here."\n\nTresckow's hands clasped each other tightly. There was a question burning on his mind and on the tip of his tongue.

 tresckowgo4.7.desc:0 "Another set of papers. This time, Tresckow did not hold them so amicably in his hands. What he felt coursing through his fingers was not pride. It was the total absence of it. It was practically paranoia that drove him to scour through Graebner's records. A force drove him into committing - he had to find out, he had to make sure whether his suspicions were correct or not, or else he would lose entire nights of sleep over it. Yet if he was correct, he would lose them anyway, for guilt was a human emotion that lingered far longer than one would want it to.\n\nIt took entire minutes for him to read through the text, focusing on the parts that were all related to Graebner's youth. A glint, here and there, passages that discussed his upbringing, his German-focused education, and finally, the worst evidence of it all.\n\nHe was not born as Graebner. He was born as Filip Blazek. He was not born in Hamburg. He was born in Sosnowitz. Formerly known as Sosnowiec.\n\nHe felt his heart drop. The product of his passivity, his failure to resist, now manifested in the heart of Germany, staring him down in the face. Tresckow's arms slowly began to tremble as he packed away the documents. He didn't want to look at them - once was enough, for that day, for a lifetime. The evil he committed that day, a resounding success for Hitler and his goons, and a catastrophe to his moral psyche. But... did the young man have to know? He was content with his life. A false one, stolen from what could have been-- but stable nonetheless. If Tresckow confronted him with his past, the consequences could be disastrous. His heart burned at the thought, and his body stood frozen for what felt like hours before he made his decision."

He trailed off, rubbing a hand against his forehead as he looked down at the table. Papers, though he could hardly read the letters with how blurred his vision felt, momentarily distracted him from what he was about to unfurl to the man in front of him. Tresckow swallowed hard. He didn't notice how the officer became immediately more uncomfortable. "I've checked into your records. And..."\n\nThe words came from his mouth almost as if it was on auto-pilot. He spoke in detail about the officer's past. How he was never meant to be born and raised by Germans. How his cultural identity as a Polish man was struck down into the dirt, destroyed, and covered up with the swastika. How, ultimately, his life was a lucky number. Where he could have slaved away in toil, worked to the bone and dying meaninglessly, he now sat here, promoted by one of the highest members of the NSDAP, the bright red armband mocking him, and everything he had never known he had lost.\n\nBy the end, Tresckow found it hard to breathe, and did not dare look at Filip, who only stared in utter shock. As Tresckow put his elbow on the table and ran a hand through his hair, he heard something quiet and frantic - an excuse to leave, to think. He did not bid Filip goodbye, nor acknowledged the erratically-paced footsteps and slamming of the door. Only a single thought, fueled by the mistakes of his past, haunted him."

A voice he instantly recognized came from the other side. Speer's. "Herr Tresckow?"

However, recently he has been absent without notice for the past week..."\n\n"If anything has happened, I do advise telling me.

A nice fat dose of funding for education and healthcare, enough to make the Reich look like one of the most progressive nations on Earth, was sure to go over well with anyone who had half a brain. "Well, Herr Kiesinger," he said with an honest smile, "This is more like it. It's nice to have a proposal that won't anger at least half the Reichstag come to my desk."\n\nKiesinger chuckled warmly. "I'm sure, my Führer. Herr Erhard can be quite an overbearing man at times, can't he?"\n\n"Now," Speer began, steepling his fingers. "It will be quite expensive, won't it? Not that I'm opposed to it - just considering the whole picture."\n\n"Yes, my Führer, it will cost us a fair amount. I'm sure it won't be difficult to sell to the Reichstag, though. Many of the newer representatives are populists at heart, and once information about this becomes public they'll be under immense pressure to accept it."\n\nThe Führer took a moment to stew it over. The Reich's children certainly needed investment in their futures, and if the money was available to give citizens better quality healthcare, why not do it? With the military cuts and a rationalized taxation system, there really wasn't much of an argument against it. The money would just be sitting around gathering dust otherwise, waiting for some greedy bureaucrat to start picking away at it. "Very good, Parteikanzler," Speer finally said.

We can't afford to have our academic base get out of hand. It's a spawning ground for Bolshevism, as I'm sure any seasoned intelligence officer could tell you. Need I remind you of the dissident groups that have already emerged from the student movement? Do you want a dozen more appearing every few months?"\n\n"Don't be so hyperbolic, Gehlen," Speer replied with a roll of his eyes. "You want to deny our youth the same education that our rivals enjoy because you're scared that it might make your job a little harder? You're going to need a better excuse than that to oppose this."\n\nThe line was silent for a moment as Gehlen composed himself. "My Führer," he said, voice smooth and inoffensive once more, "The less a man knows, the more pliable he remains. The world is a dangerous place - too dangerous for us to risk the growth of subversive academia. Bolshevism and its cohorts have always found a home amongst short-sighted young men and women.

Do you think they care? We can't stop people having subversive thoughts - if they're even having them in the first place!"\n\n"Herr Kiesinger," Speer said, taking on a conciliatory tone. "Healthcare will still receive the funding it requires. And, you know, Gehlen is right: the world is a dangerous place, and our enemies will take any opportunity to spread un-German ideas amongst the youth. Germany certainly has a history of student radicalism already, so would it really be wise to encourage that?"\n\nKiesinger looked equal parts frustrated and baffled. "Un-German ideas? My Führer, this administration is built on 'un-German' ideas, no matter what we might tell the Party. Please, don't let Gehlen dictate policy to you. His opposition to this reform is obviously based on the interests of the RND, not the Reich as a whole."\n\nSpeer twiddled his thumbs beneath the desk.

"I mean, this new legislation of yours the Reichstag just passed - it means a lot to me and... uh, to a lot of people I know, and people like me who grew up after the war.

So, um... thank you, my Führer."\n\nThe two men, separated by generations and, unbeknownst to Friedman, their politics, were silent for a moment. Then, Speer smiled again - sincerely, this time.

For now, however, he had a pile of letters to get through.\n\nNone were positive, save Gehlen's. Naturally, the RND head was overjoyed to know that the youth wouldn't have a chance to get any funny ideas, nor to be educated above their stations without a substantial amount of family wealth behind them. Speer couldn't even bear to read Kiesinger's - criticism from his inner circle only fostered greater stress. Still, this wasn't a complete setback for reformism, so how could anyone truly fault him for his decision?

I, along with my allies and friends within the circles of the Reich, find ourselves worried that the integrity of National Socialist values will be threatened. Did we not talk about the futility of religion? Its needless superstition, and an insatiable desire to twist the present back towards the past? Not only that, but it is directly linked to the Jew. I will not speak of the attempts to synthesize our ideology and Christianity together, for it is an abomination, but rather I will speak of what secularization will lead to.\n\nWe have, thankfully, annihilated Judaism from Europa, but unfortunately, the claws of Abraham still follow us. I know that you, my Führer, have no love for Christ and his Jewry. And so I ask you to please reconsider what has been done. If you truly let our Reich slip into tolerating the Protestant and the Christian, then we will once again allow ourselves to be tainted by a religious ideology contrary to National Socialism, contrary to the thousand year Reich that we are to build, and contrary to our supremacy as an Aryan people. It is my hope that, when you receive this letter, you will quickly realize what decision to make.\n\nThe future of Germany is in your hands, my Führer, and I trust that you will make the right choice. - Reichsstatthalter Arthur Greiser of Wartheland."\n\nBy the end of it, Speer was gritting his teeth, wondering what the hell to do."

"In my own homeland, I see Protestants thrown out of churches for only doing their duty. Elsewhere, Catholics are harassed and their sermons broken up by police." Tresckow stated, eyes narrowing just a little bit. He could recognize that look Speer was giving him. "You may not care much about it, but many of Germany's citizens do. The direction you're taking shall be antithetical to their beliefs. If you want to avoid decades of strife, then I suggest pressing through with allowing people to worship openly."\n\nSpeer glanced at him inquisitively. He offered no sympathy to religion, and would be happy to see it gone, but was it really worth backing down? The choice, then, was between upholding the future of a Germany free of religion, or guaranteeing stability by allowing them to practice their faith."

 kiesingergo4.10.desc:0 "Josef, as always, felt uncomfortable when he swung that board around his back and front. It felt like he was pinning himself up as a target for the police - and, truth be told, the close encounters he had with them told him that the Protestant was lucky to not be in jail yet. Exiting into the streets, the nicely-painted black letters against white said "GERMANY WITHOUT FAITH - GERMANY WITHOUT ITS SOUL!" He could see, in the far distance, the ominous and foreboding Volkshalle staring down at him as he gathered with his friends.\n\nAn hour and a half later, Josef rallied at the front, next to another ally of his who waved a flag around that spoke of a similar message. She was bolder, older than him - a veteran of these things, and he could always learn something new from her. But when they turned the street corner and met upon a patrol of military police, both parties stood dead in their tracks. Here, in Welthauptstadt Germania, was a small protest of ten marching about and wanting their freedom to ring true, and nobody was quite sure of what to do.\n\nThat was, until one of the policemen started cracking up. Nudging a fellow officer of his, they took a few minutes to find a megaphone, and with a click, they spoke. "The police is here to remind you all that Führer Speer has begun secularizing the anti-religious policies that have been currently instated." The tension between the two groups loosened significantly after that. "However, that still doesn't mean you can walk around and disrupt citizens. Go home and wait, unless you want to be punished." The casual tone of his voice slightly unnerved Josef, and he swallowed. There wasn't even a 'that is all', instead only the cutting of static as the policemen moved on."

 kiesingergo4.11.desc:0 "Every day, Nils had to stare it out of the window in his room. Every day, Nils locked eyes with that building, closed down, all the light of its life having left it so long ago. Every year, Nils hoped that something would change. That he would no longer have to do service to the Lord within the confines of his own home, always in danger of being watched by those that would want to stamp his faith out in these dark times. It had been so long, in fact, that only Nils remained to be the only one in his family who didn't just pay lip service to something that guided him for a lifetime. Even when he was told by his mother to stop fretting so much about prayer, and worry more about what would happen if he was caught, he did not relent. And for just a day, it seemed like his faith had proved its mettle, and its dedication.\n\nOne day, Nils had woken up to something different. The church was no longer dreadfully empty of souls. Instead, the lights had been turned on, and he could see his fellow Germans moving about. He took a care to not rush himself in excitement, however, as modesty remained an important concern. Yet... eventually, when he walked into that simple building, and met that familiar face of the preacher greeting him with a warmth that he lacked somehow back home, Nils felt at peace with himself. He heard it from one of his brothers that the government decreed a slow reversing of policy that would discriminate against the religious, and that made him both happy and shocked. What made them do such a thing? Perhaps someone had a change of heart. Whatever it was, he only hoped that it would remain that way.\n\nUntil it didn't. The next day afterwards, Nils nigh jumped out of his bed to see what state the church was in, and a low, sinking feeling overcame his stomach with what he saw. As if yesterday never happened, he saw soldiers guarding the front of the building, with people being ferried out, one by one. Perhaps they didn't have a change of heart at all, and it was all a charade - making a mockery of something they had already begun ruining. He found anger at the thought, and that anger did not abate when the hours passed. His family could see it, and his mother warned him to not be consumed by fury, but he knew better. Hours later, when Nils heard chanting from outside his house, he knew what to do. With a cross in one hand and a sturdy piece of wood concealed on his person, he went out to see a wave of people filling the street of the church, facing off against a squadron of military police."

 kiesingergo4.12.desc:0 "After what felt like aeons of Speer staring at the Prussian, frozen still and staring at him with barely-concealed anger, Tresckow finally decides ro shatter the silence. Taking a deep breath, the disciplined Prussian stood firm. "Herr Speer." He began, voice cold and direct. "Do you realize what you are saying?" The Führer stared at him almost blankly, but nodded. "Yes, Herr Tresckow, I have said what I had on my mind. And?" If looks could hurt, then Tresckow's would be a wunderwaffe. "And? Herr Speer... I don't wish to cause a ruckus in your office, but you are causing a grave error as of this moment. I understand that you do not care about religion," and he was tempted to add 'instead you follow your own damnable devil', but relented. "I, however, put value on it. A value so high that, if I am still around to see it tarnished and ruined," he began, some frustration now clearly rising above the surface, "Stomped out in front of me, then, Herr Speer, I believe that my presence will no longer be necessary here."\n\nSpeer nearly flinched at the comment. Did Tresckow just imply a resignation? He balled a hand up into a fist and put it on the desk. "I... am I hearing you right, Herr Tresckow?" Speer asked, sounding taken aback. "You wouldn't do this. Not over something like this." The moment after he said that, the Prussian made a noise that sounded close to a hiss. "Of course I would!" He spoke, raising his voice that mixed anger and irritation together. "I cannot bother with being subtle about it, Herr Speer. If you want to snuff the light of religion in this country, then I shall not be here to see it, rest assured!" Speer glared at him. He couldn't tell if Tresckow would truly follow up on it, but he felt strongly like he would. "This... ridiculous dialogue of yours, is something I refuse to tolerate!" It felt like Speer's heart skipped a beat. Now a slow trickle of panic began filling his mind as Tresckow got more and more openly angry. "Herr Speer, you can consider my participation in this charade over!"\n\nAs Tresckow began turning around, he only had moments to think. He had to say something, because saying nothing would only serve to humiliate him. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Speer caught the Prussian's attention by saying..."
 kiesingergo4.12.a:0 ""Hold on, damn it! I haven't even said anything yet!""
 kiesingergo4.12.b:0 ""Leave then, Herr Tresckow! Your Prussian heritage means nothing here!""

 kiesingergo4.13.t:0 "Actually, Herr Tresckow, I Do"
 kiesingergo4.13.desc:0 "Tresckow stood in front of the door for a few seconds, in sullen, tense, and uncomfortable silence. Then, finally, Speer almost thanked a deity when the man finally spoke. "... Have you changed your mind?" The military man asked. Speer swallowed back doubt and reluctantly spoke. "Herr Tresckow, I... we can speak of this further. It doesn't have to end here." He could sense the other man's stance tightening, and then, after a few terse seconds, he looked down at the floor.\n\n"Herr Speer..." He began. "I'll hear you out." Yet he didn't bother to turn around. A part of Speer wanted to face him head-on, but another was glad that wasn't the case. "However, I believe I need... something." That didn't sound like good news. "Something?" Speer asked, and Tresckow nodded. "Yes. It is something I believe will resolve this situation amicably. In a way that, at least I will find satisfactory." No. It absolutely did not sound like good news - not at all. "Then," Speer began, sighing and rubbing his forehead. "Go and acquire this 'something' of yours. I don't-- we don't have all day."\n\nAgain, Tresckow nodded. Quick and professionally. "Certainly, Herr Speer. I bid you goodbye and will return to you in just a short while." Without waiting for a response, he reached for the door and pushed it open, politely closing it behind him as he left Speer to wonder in silence."

 kiesingergo4.14.t:0 "Four Against One"
 kiesingergo4.14.desc:0 "Speer's fingers tightened against each other when he heard the knob of the door open. He was expecting Tresckow again, for sure, but what he saw not only surprised him, but shocked him.\n\nFirst came Tresckow. Then came another three - all faces he distinctly, immediately recognized. Helmut Schmidt, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Ludwig Erhard. Three extra personalities he did not want to meet today. Though he wanted to sink back in his seat, he sat firmly, and eyed them all with a strong gaze. "So this is your something." He stated, giving the fiercest gaze to Tresckow, who looked back at him and betrayed no emotion. "Gentlemen?" Tresckow said, turning to the other three, and they all nodded.\n\n"I'll speak on behalf of all four of us," Kiesinger said, nodding towards Speer, who looked at him warily. "You're making a most unwise choice, my Führer. Herr Tresckow is firmly dedicated to Germany's long-valued Christian beliefs. To get rid of them now, well..." He shook his head. "I believe you're missing the point of this alliance."\n\nSpeer felt his pointer finger press hard on the wooden surface of his table. He was cornered. Like a caged animal, he was at his wits end. He could deal with Tresckow on his own, but this? "My Führer?" Kiesinger asked, snapping Speer out of his dazed state and forcing his focus back on the four. "We need a choice from you, and I will make you well aware that this mutual pact of ours does not only go one way." Speer could swear, out from the corner of his eye, that he could feel disciplined eyes trained on every fidget of his hands and muscle on his face - but something must be said. A decision had to come to fruition, else what masqueraded as a simple demand would unravel into something much worse."

 kiesingergo4.15.t:0 "What Else, Really?"
 kiesingergo4.15.desc:0 "The five dispersed shortly afterwards that day, and they all had let out a collective sigh of relief. Except Speer. Backed into an ultimatum, now he further vested power into the damnable Gang, and he had nothing to show for it. No ulterior motives, no long-term plans, no shadows in the dark - and now, his pride would be turned against him, being forced to sit in his office and sign legislation after legislation about legalizing church practices and private worship. Not only that, but he had to deal with the bloody NSDAP.\n\nOr, at least, he would have. The next time Speer met Kiesinger, the air between them wasn't the happiest, but he was told that the most stringent of responses would be avoided and minimized to his office. He had helped the Gang, and so the Gang would help him. Not only that, in but a few days he had already received letters from Christians coming from all parts of Germany, thanking him for beginning the process of reversing decades of discrimination. Some were less grateful than others, but Speer felt bitter all the same. He never planned to secularize, but outside forces forced his hand, and, to further humiliate him, made it so that he looked like the man behind the job."

 kiesingergo4.16.desc:0 "When the words left his mouth, he froze. Regret immediately came to him, and as his eyes shifted towards where Tresckow would be, all he was met with was the slam of the door closing behind an incredibly irate Prussian. The rest stared at him, a mixture of frustrated and purely dumbfounded. Erhard looked disgusted. Schmidt seemed irritated, and Kiesinger was disappointed, merely sighing and shaking his head. "A grave mistake, my Führer. I truly hoped it wouldn't come to this."\n\n"What do you mean?" Speer asked through gritted teeth. "You're not telling me he's-", "Resigning?" Kiesinger finished, and his expression dropped further. The air in the room continued to still. "By tomorrow, I am afraid."\n\nAs Speer struggled to recompose himself, Erhard drew in his cigar and puffed out some smoke, giving Speer a nasty glare. "I'll think on what happens next. The rest of you two can stay here and do whatever, but I'm leaving." As he did, Schmidt spoke up soon afterwards. "Actually... I believe I will go too. This has given me food for thought, and, well..." He nodded towards Speer, who looked lost for words. "Goodbye, my Führer."\n\nIt was only Kiesinger left standing, and he could read Speer like a book. "No point in you staying here," Speer almost snarled. "Go. Leave. You must have business to attend to, I'm sure." He was losing strength and energy to speak with every passing word, but Kiesinger merely nodded. "Of course I do, my Führer. Goodbye.""
 kiesingergo4.16.a:0 "Speer didn't get anything done that day."

 kiesingergo4.17.t:0 "Have Some Courtesy"
 kiesingergo4.17.desc:0 "Speer dreaded going to his office that morning. So much so that it took him almost half an hour extra before he exited his house, and he barely paid attention to whatever his chauffeur wanted to talk about. He wanted - no, he needed something to prevent him from going to do his job. Just for that day. Just so that he could have time off. There was nothing, however. There was no terrorist threat. There was no assassination attempt. Instead, the Führer simply crossed the streets of Germania, safe and sound as many other citizens of the Reich.\n\nWhen he came to his door, his hand grasped at the doorknob for much longer than he needed to. When he pushed it down, it felt like he had to use all the strength in his body to do so. When he walked in, his eyes looked at everything. The windows, the outside. The decorating, the cabinets. The papers.\n\nThe letters. He could spot their signatures from even where he was standing. Tremors began to slowly wrack up his torso and spread to his limbs as he counted them. Not even a last goodbye. Like snakes, they shed their skins and left. When his hand touched upon the surface of one letter, - Tresckow's, of course it stood at the top - a pang of guilt passed by his heart. In this Reich, however, one could not feel guilt. One could only move forward. Speer considered reading the letters; something useful to extract, perhaps. Then he realized that nothing about it was important. Not anymore.\n\nAnd so they were thrown into the trash. Unopened, unread. Left to wilt into nothingness. Words written would remain words unsaid, but they burned into Speer's mind."

He pretended Germany was fine. He pretended that there was no migraine crawling up the back of his skull, and how he hadn't stopped shaking for most of the day, and how his mind wasn't a flash of thought patterns that resembled nothing coherent.\n\nSpeer wanted to pretend he was alright. But nothing was. Not after the empire of his dreams crumbled before his eyes, and from the rubble he picked and pulled his hands into, all that remained was the torn-up flag of the Reich. The tilted swastika staring back at him. He would have welcomed it, but now all that was left was its corrupted form, hollow and distorted. Since the Gang left, Speer came to a cold, cruel realization - one he knew from the start, but refused to acknowledge. It faced him here, in his study room, locked inside his own home, his mind swimming in a pool of painful memories and even more painful truths.\n\nThere was only one thing left for him. Only one avenue of support. A force that would corrupt him, too. But it was better him than anyone else. Even with his vision broken, he had a glimmer of hope that he could steer the wheel and prevent it from turning all the way. No longer could he think of a bright Germany.\n\nOnly one shrouded in darkness, the grip of the NSDAP slowly crushing the flickering light of true National Socialism. Now, he would stray down the path of insanity that would border him on all sides. He could only hope that he was not consumed by it."

 kiesingergo4.19.t:0 "Hope You Guessed My Name"
 kiesingergo4.19.desc:0 "He felt glued to his chair. In fact, Speer felt like he was trapped in his office. Is this what claustrophobia felt like? Except the walls were too wide, the windows too open. His ears perked up to the sounds of cars passing by the street outside, and the wind blowing through the air. His eyes failed - perhaps purposefully - to notice the stack of papers on his desk. He didn't give them a look. Recently, he had developed a hate of letters. If someone asked him why, he would simply shrug, and tell them that he didn't really know why.\n\nHe would have been content with sitting there, doing nothing, for hours on end, until he got the opportunity to go home and do more of nothing. But silence never lasted long. At some point during the day, some hours in the afternoon, the phone in his office rang. The noise was shrill and piercing for his ears, but it alerted him quickly, and in a haze of sudden anger and irritation he grabbed it roughly and put it up against his ear. "Who is this?" He demanded.\n\n"Hmm. You should recognize me by voice alone," the other voice on the line spoke, and Speer could feel his anger receding instantly. "I am Theodor Oberländer. Quite... the important figure in the NSDAP. I believe I can make my services of use to you."\n\nThere were no protests. Ever since the Gang left, the reformist clique in the NSDAP would begin their eventual collapse. Only the reactionaries were left. The visionaries who twisted National Socialism and dragged it through mud and blood, and Speer could only slow it down. "I've recently come to the knowledge that your cabinet has resigned. A true shame." Nothing betrayed Oberländer's voice. "Not to worry. The NSDAP has always been a strong force, and since I am at the helm of the ones who used to oppose you, well... stability will come easy. Rest assured, this will be a fruitful venture. Now... I needn't waste more of your time, though I will tell you one thing." Speer gripped the phone in his hand tightly, and a part of him wanted to smash it against his desk.

If we were to propose this secularization, they may just take the opportunity to corner our influence." Kiesinger breathed irritation and exhaled calm. Of course Speer would try to downplay the idea. That should have come as no surprise, but he was expecting less resistance than a hard no. Still, it wasn't a catastrophe.\n\nKiesinger nodded politely. "Of course, my Führer. While I would drop the topic..." Speer had a feeling there wasn't an end to this yet. "There is more that remains unaddressed. In fact, I believe I may bring you something to settle your doubts once and for all." Speer raised an eyebrow. "Something?" He asked. "Do you mean, perhaps, to bring me answers?" Kiesinger once again nodded. "If you may, my Führer - I shall leave, and return soon with answers in tow."\n\nSpeer looked at him with suspicion, but held his tongue on the more unsavoury things he wanted to say. Instead, he let out a short sigh. "You are dismissed, Herr Kiesinger. And do not take too long. I've not all day." As Kiesinger thanked the man and left the room, Speer was left to his thoughts."

 kiesingergo4.27.t:0 "The Curtain Opens"
 kiesingergo4.27.desc:0 "When Speer heard two pairs of footsteps outside his door, one was calm and normal. The other, he realized, moments before the door swung open, was von Tresckow.\n\nKiesinger merely gave Speer a friendly glance as Tresckow nigh stomped inside into his office. He gave a crisp, though annoyed salute, and spoke. "Herr Speer!" He said, demanding the fading attention of the Führer. "Yes, Herr Kiesinger?" He asked in return, and the Prussian straightened himself up. "I will make this brief, but the message shall surely resound with you. Herr Speer, do you remember one of the primary goals of our alliance?" Speer nodded. "I remember all of them. What are you referring to, exactly?" He asked, shifting somewhat uncomfortably in his seat.\n\nTresckow harrumphed. "Freedom!" He exclaimed. "The freedom of Germany's people. Is that not one of the main things we've been promised? I would say that it is one of the tenets crafted into the political web we've created for each other!" Speer felt his energy draining after each and every word Tresckow spoke. "And what is the most prized freedom of them all, than the freedom of worship?" His gaze affixed on Speer's eyes, and the Führer could not dare to look away from him.\n\n"My Führer." Kiesinger said. "I believe Herr Tresckow will remain unsullied by the reply of silence. I advise..." He looked at Tresckow, who seemed intent to keep staring at Speer. "... for you to answer him." Then he looked back at Speer, who seemed deep in thought, though not for reasons the Prussian would hope for. The room remained silent for a few seconds more, but after long enough, Speer broke the silence. He was to determine the mood shift with what he said, and there were two lines of thought he could pursue."

But it prevented another outburst from the man. Speer noted Tresckow's pose slightly relaxing, and he felt the smallest weight come off his shoulders. Kiesinger, however, looked fully unconvinced, yet let the man speak.\n\n"There is a significant amount of them that still oppose us at every turn!" He noted. "If we did something as extreme as this, they would jump at the opportunity to decry us as radicals. They could raise hell in the Reichstag, and... impede us at every point they could! It's simply something I find difficult to convince the hardliners on." As the two listened on, Speer's spiel seemed to have the opposite effect on their opinion - especially Kiesinger, who merely shook his head and sighed."

 kiesingergo4.22.t:0 "The Curtain Begins Closing"
 kiesingergo4.22.desc:0 ""Go on, Herr Kiesinger..." Speer trailed off, feeling frustrated that he couldn't give much of a good argument in his favor.\n\nKiesinger nodded. "You speak of the consequences, but that is exactly why you should go through with this decision, my Führer. To the people, you are their leader." He stated the obvious, but Speer had a feeling that wasn't just it. "To the party, however..." Speer's eyes tightened just enough for Kiesinger to notice. And ignore, as his smile widened the slightest bit. "Well, you are no dictator. You do not make every rule and judgement."\n\n"So you are to take the fall?" Speer asked, and Kiesinger shook his head once again. "No, no. Better than that. I am not Deputy Führer for no reason. I will manage whatever the more unsavory part of the NSDAP shall unleash on us. I merely ask that you let this reform pass. Whatever happens, it shall be under my jurisdiction to take care of."\n\nSpeer pressed his palms against each other harder than normal. Again, Tresckow and Kiesinger fell into silence as the Führer thought, and they thought it better to let him think. And think he did. After almost a full ten seconds, Speer exhaled deeply and spoke."

"I have said what I have said, Herr Kiesinger. Do not expect me to relent on this decision."\n\nKiesinger exchanged a glance at Tresckow, who seemed stuck in thought. Then he coughed uncomfortably, and looked towards Speer, fixing up the tie on his suit. "If that's the case, then I needn't be here any longer. Am I dismissed, my Führer?" Speer eyed the Prussian with a sense of worry and confusion. He barely overheard Kiesinger's words, but gave a half-nod. "Yes, Herr Kiesinger... you are dismissed."\n\nAs the Deputy Führer left the room, he gave his last parting words as the Prussian seemed to regain his clarity."

Have the two of you forgotten what our Germany was built on?" He continued, feeling the ember of spirit embed itself in his voice, just a notch above the desperation he felt moments before. "It was the ideology that had the world in its grasp for decades!"\n\nHe could feel the disappointment emanating from them. Maybe he just struck the wrong chord? "The only reason why we are declining now is because we're moving past our roots! What made us strong! Germany needs its previous faith no more!" At that, Tresckow visibly began getting upset. Kiesinger, meanwhile, fell into neutrality - not a hint of emotion betraying his face.\n\n"And..." Speer continued, taking a moment to process and discard his regret. "To go back to the time where we were great, we cannot capitulate to these new ideas that want to drag us into the past!" When he stopped, he could only hesitantly look at Tresckow, who was positively brewing. Speer wanted to say something, but the Prussian fired the first shot."

Tresckow said, glaring at the Führer with enough strength to make the man feel like he was facing down a member of the SS. "Perhaps you take me as silly. Naïve, even. But that would be far from the truth." His sigh approached a growl, and Speer felt his throat going dry. "The past, Herr Speer? Really, now? The past that has shaped our entire culture from birth to present?! I have tolerated this insofar as having the idea that you would listen to Herr Kiesinger, as he speaks with reason, but I am mistaken."\n\nSpeer's eyes flicked back and forth between the two, but he dared not interrupt the Prussian. "Do you think these men and women some... some bandits?" He asked. "Some bomb-throwing anarchists? If so, I am shocked Germany is not up in flames from these Christians." Kiesinger shook his head. "No. The truth is much simpler. These are people - my people! They wish to be left in peace. To pray to their sole creator, and follow the path the Lord has given them!"\n\n"So, Herr Speer?" He asked, tightening a fist and quietly gritting his teeth towards the Führer. "Will you go against the will of the majority? They only wish for peace. Nothing more. And I would advise listening to the people's will. After all..." Tresckow's eyes narrowed. "That has always been the job of the Führer."\n\nKiesinger remained deathly quiet. Speer, meanwhile, felt like he faced down the barrel of a gun. Whatever he said, he had to mean it. So eventually, Speer regained his composure, and mustered a reply."

Do you understand, Herr Kiesinger?" He pointedly asked, and the man regained his focus to meet his gaze at him.\n\n"Of course I do, my Führer. I will try my best to cow the hardliners. Otherwise..." He looked towards Tresckow. "It seems to me like you're satisfied." When the Prussian was addressed, he straightened his back and stiffened his body once again. "Why wouldn't I? Today is a great day for Germany's people!" He exclaimed, then sighed. "This means I must have business to attend to." He said, and Speer gave him the slightest look of suspicion that he merely ignored. "Herr Speer," he addressed, prompting the Führer to listen closely.

 kiesingergo4.29.desc:0 ""... That is to say, points different from what you would want me to agree on." Speer continued, and Tresckow began seizing on hostility in his eyes before suddenly realizing what the man meant, giving the Führer a small scare as the Prussian calmed down. Kiesinger, meanwhile, rubbed his forehead and grit his teeth for a second or two before speaking. "What, ah... what were these points you agreed on, my Führer?"\n\nSpeer almost audibly grumbled when asked to clarify. "Primarily one. It's the fact that, yes, I did promise some form of liberalization to Germany." He well and truly hated that word, but couldn't dodge saying it. "I suppose that... secularizing the country can fall under one of those freedoms." At that, Tresckow seemed to undergo some sort of mood swing, now standing properly and his gaze significantly softening to something more reasonable.\n\n"Ha-ha! I'm glad you see light to reason, Herr Speer!" He said, only prompting the Führer to feel more defeated - he wouldn't bother countering that. Tresckow nodded towards Kiesinger. "This calls for a celebration, doesn't it?" Kiesinger gave a somewhat meek nod, which Tresckow merely chuckled at. "Alright, well, I may at least celebrate this victory in private." Turning towards Speer, he continued. "Now, are we to be dismissed?" He was merely received with a sigh and a hand wave, gesturing for the two of them to leave his office.\n\nWith a sharp nod from Tresckow and a courteous one from Kiesinger, they left Speer to his thoughts."

 RNDflavour.1.d:0 ""Please state your name, occupation, and your current assignment here," two taps, "to this microphone. We are required to inform you that you are being surveilled and recorded while this interview commences. Please begin in three, two, one."\n\nA raspy, crackling voice rattled the air. "My name is Erich Fischer, and I work for the Reichsnachrichentdienst as an espionage agent. My current assignment is to infiltrate the society of the slaves and fill in a full report to the RND, and I am here in the capacity to do that."\n\n"Ar-" a slight feedback effect, and the sound of footsteps shook the recording room. "Never mind. Agent Erich, how did your assignment go? Did you encounter any outstanding problems, or were you discovered in any way?"\n\n"It went well, no problems at all. The slaves do not suspect anything, else I would not be sitting here alive." A chuckle. "Apologies, it's a point of pride."\n\n"Very well. State your report."\n\n"Yes, sir." A rustling of papers. "The agency stationed me in Oberschlesien, near a camp of slaves in Kattowitz. Prior to this, the RND had instructed the camp's guards and command structure not to treat me any differently from the slaves." A sigh. "Not a day passes without my wishing to be somewhere else, horrid as it was. I learned the languages of the slaves: Polish and Ukrainian, and with the addition of Russian, I was able to learn that..." The raspy voice trailed off.\n\nAfter a moment. "Learn what?"\n\n"I am sorry for being the harbinger of bad news." Deep breaths, deep breaths. "The Reichsbanner and, by extension, Spartakus do not work alone. There are rumors of political movements emerging from the slaves, and I am afraid I have only," A pause. "Cursory, let's say, hints to who they are."\n\nSilence for a few moments. Whispering. "Thank you for your service, Herr Fischer. Now, we have a few more questions for you. Shall we proceed?""

speerpoland.1.t:0 "The OKW's Proposal"
speerpoland.1.d:0 "Henning von Tresckow was typically a very well dressed man, and today was no exception. His uniform, exquisitely ironed and cleaned, made even Speidel's uniform look messy and rumpled- and Speidel's uniform was holding up better than most. Together, they passed their report to the Führer. If Tresckow's uniform looked tidy, and Speidel's looked alright, then Speer's suit looked like a mess of wrinkles and ink marks.\n\n"Herr Speidel, Herr Tresckow. May I have an explanation of your plan?" Speer spoke softly, his eyes crossing the lettering. Tresckow cleared his throat before beginning.\n\n"Germany holds numerous clear advantages over the new Polish state, but the most obvious one is our military advantage, Herr Speer. The Heer dwarfs anything the Poles could throw up. I propose that we use this fact to our advantage." Speidel nodded in agreement. Speer put the paper back down.\n\n"Invasion?" He asked bluntly. Tresckow's brow furrowed before he continued.\n\n"No, no- at least, not preferably. The threat of invasion should be more than sufficient to force the Poles to bend the knee. Besides that, multiple actions that benefit Poland will hopefully aid in creating a perception that we are no longer imperial maniacs, but rather a benevolent custodian."\n\nSpeer smiled. "I like it. You have my full permission to go ahead."\n\n"And, my Führer, if they refuse- well, the threat of invasion is not an empty one." Speidel added, a faint smile crossing his lips. Speer nodded and watched as they exited."
speerpoland.1.a:0 "Let's see how it goes."

speerpoland.2.t:0 "The German Threat"
speerpoland.2.d:0 "Bad news has reached Warsaw today. The Germans are returning. A plan, outlined by Feldmarschall Speidel, details a scheme by the Germans to return to Polish lands. If it is not accepted, it's quite clear that Poland will not be spared an invasion. Germany will have hegemony, one way or the other."
speerpoland.2.a:0 "Accept"
speerpoland.2.b:0 "Decline"

speerpoland.3.t:0 "The Right Man"
speerpoland.3.d:0 "Two letters adorned Speer's desk today, and one made him significantly happier than the other.\n\nThe first was from the OKW itself. The issue of who to select for the occupation of Poland was a prickly one, and the two letters sitting on Speer's desk painted both sides nicely. On one hand was a letter from Tresckow, recommending an old army friend- Werner Schrader. The main part of Tresckow's pitch was Schrader's history in the Wehrmacht- a history of resistance to the greatest atrocities the Heer pulled off. Tresckow's argument rested upon this resistance- after all, would a standard Wehrmacht man be able to hold onto control in Poland without compromising the new face of the Reich?\n\nThe second letter was much more infuriating. Coming directly from Ferdinand Schörner- Bloody Ferdinand himself, Speer thought- this letter seemed directly out of the 40's. A screed against the Reich's new course, the Reich's decision on Poland, and the Polish nation in general, Schörner's letter called for an immediate reversal back into the genocidal policies of the Reich's earlier days. Incredible, Speer thought. To Schörner, everything was the nail, and he was always the hammer. It's as if he didn't realize that the war was over.\n\nThe choice was obvious. Speer sent a letter back to Tresckow, granting his approval of Schrader's portfolio. As a near afterthought, he swept Schörner's letter into the trash."
speerpoland.3.a:0 "The world keeps moving."

speerpoland.4.t:0 "One Hand Gives, the Other Takes"
speerpoland.4.d:0 "The first time the 10th Panzer Division entered Poland was in 1939. Then, they had fought their way through the fields of Europe, shredding the Polish Army, marching all the way to the hell that was the battle of Warsaw. Thousands of dead later, the city- and Poland- was theirs.\n\nTheir commander was hoping it would not need to happen again.\n\nThe men eyed the border guards on the Polish side as they raised the gate. Was there an ambush down the road? A division ready to kill any German they saw? As they drove through, tank commanders kept their hatches down and their guns up, ready for the attack they knew was coming.\n\nAnd yet, with every kilometer they drove with no interruption, their fear began to turn to disbelief. When they reached their first town, each and every tank commander silently sweat as the division of Armia Krajowa they were to disarm stood at attention. This is it, most thought. This was the moment where it all went to hell.\n\nWhen the Poles actually began to hand over their rifles, the disbelief was written all the 10th's faces as they handed out their medicine and food. The commander of the Poles was last in line- he took his food and medicine, looked into the German commander's stunned eyes, and smirked before walking away."
speerpoland.4.a:0 "A new era begins."

speerpoland.5.t:0 "An Early Repatriation"
speerpoland.5.d:0 "The crowd around Warsaw's train station swelled well out of the station, into the street, and down several blocks. Thousands of people lined the railroad, watching for the German trains carrying the most precious cargo they could. When the first line of smoke was sighted, far down the line, a shock of excitement swept through the crowd and the police line braced for impact.\n\nBy the time the train pulled into the station, a hushed tension had overtaken the crowd. Necks craned as German guards hopped from their carriages, securing a perimeter and a way out of the crowd. The tension in the air grew thick and heavy as the doors to the carrier cars opened.\n\nWhen the first slave, still in his prison uniform, stepped slowly into the sun, there was a moment of disbelief. Suddenly, the crowd exploded into cheers, chanting, yelling, and the police line buckled under the weight of thousands straining against them. As the slaves walked down the passage set out for them, flowers poured down onto their heads. Families strained to see loved ones.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the first truly joyous day for all of Poland since the revolution- their men were coming home. If the Germans were coming with them, so be it."
speerpoland.5.a:0 "The carrot, not the stick."

speerpoland.6.t:0 "The Polish Accept"
speerpoland.6.d:0 "Good news from Warsaw today. It seems that the Polish government has recognized its hopeless situation and, seeing no other alternative, has decided to give in. Speidel's offer has been accepted in full, and the stipulations of the peace are already beginning to be enforced.\n\nSpeer smiled when he read the message, already feeling the constant headache he had begin to clear. Thank god for Speidel. No treaty terms, no negotiations, no back and forth. Just a simple, clear statement and a simple, clear response. No Germans would die over Poland, and another victory for Speer would be delivered to his doorstep.\n\nAs he sat down, he made a mental reminder to invite Speidel over for a drink or two sometime. The man certainly deserved it."
speerpoland.6.a:0 "Splendid."

speerpoland.7.t:0 "The Polish Decline"
speerpoland.7.d:0 "Stunning news from Warsaw today- the Polish government has lost its mind. At least, that's the assumption of the Führer's office, as instead of the diplomatic victory we expected, we've been delivered a bewildering refusal of our terms. To call this unexpected would be a massive understatement, as would it be a massive understatement to call this foolish. Poland stands no chance against the Reich's war machine- indeed, it seems this decision is made only in a desperate grasp to retain a sense of national pride. Whatever the motive, it seems that violence is inevitable.\n\nSpeer could feel his headache pulsate with every word of the refusal he read. Enraged, he tossed the letter into his trashcan. Were they serious? Did they think they would stand any chance against the Heer? Was this all merely an attempt to make Speer's life as hard as possible? In any case, it was clear- German boots would march over the Polish plains once again as invaders. The Führer sighed as he sat down- this would be a mess in the Reichstag. He could only hope that Speidel was not as bad a commander as he was a negotiator."
speerpoland.7.a:0 "Damn it."

speerpoland.8.t:0 "Speak Softly"
speerpoland.8.d:0 ""So, Herr Schmidt. I've read about your plan." Speer looked up from his desk, his eyes meeting his Foreign Minister's. "I'd like you to explain it to me more, because frankly, I don't understand why we need to go to this much effort over a place like Poland."\n\nSchmidt straightened his tie. "It's less about Poland itself and more about the international effects, my Führer."\n\nSpeer leaned back in his chair. "Elaborate."\n\n"Well, we could enforce our will through force of arms on the Poles, as we did in the 30's, but the main issue is that internationally, this would threaten our image as a reformist, gentler Reich."\n\n"The issue with your plan, Herr Schmidt, is that it's going to force us into promises we might not want to keep."\n\n"I understand my plan is not perfect, but it is the only way to keep our image safe. Besides, negotiation means no bloodshed, and neither of us want that, do we?" Schmidt smiled.\n\n"No, of course not. I give you permission to go ahead. Don't screw this up for me, will you?" Speer shuffled in his chair. Schmidt nodded before leaving the room, the hopes of the Reich's new standing resting squarely on his shoulders."
speerpoland.8.a:0 "We'll see how this goes."

speerpoland.9.t:0 "Offer for Diplomacy from Germany"
speerpoland.9.d:0 "Surprising news has come from Germania today- it seems that Helmut Schmidt, the Reich's foreign minister, wishes to negotiate a peace between the Reich and Poland. Should we agree to this? If we decline, the Reich may invade- something which, despite our best hopes, will be nearly impossible to defeat."
speerpoland.9.a:0 "Agree"
speerpoland.9.b:0 "Decline"

speerpoland.10.t:0 "A Step Towards the Future"
speerpoland.10.d:0 "The news passed through the Foreign Ministry's hands quickly, fast tracked to two offices- Helmut Schmidt's and Albert Speer. The message read like a celebration- the Poles had, after much consideration and debate, accepted talks with Helmut Schmidt. Together, they wrote, they hoped that Poland and Germany would work together to take Europe into an ascendant future, these talks being the groundworks to lay such a foundation. Of course, it was all diplomatic flattery for now- nobody would dare to be brutally honest this early- but it was enough for Germany, and it was certainly enough for Schmidt and Speer.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert read the letter with a sigh of relief as he took a drink. Worries danced in his mind- what if they forced the Reich's hand? What if Schmidt promised the stars and the sun?- but he sidelined them for now. For now, things were moving along smoothly. Speer had to admit, despite his personal dislike of Schmidt, he got things done.\n\nIn Schmidt's office, Helmut took the news joyously. He had expected them to accept, but it actually happening gave him an opening. With the cooperation of the Poles, he could help set things right, once and for all, and Europe would be one step closer to the light."
speerpoland.10.a:0 "The hopes of Poland rest uneasy."

speerpoland.11.t:0 "Falling Back"
speerpoland.11.d:0 "The news shattered the morale of every hand it touched- a lightning strike to the reformists, a frustrating setback to the Speerites. It slowly slid its way through the Foreign Ministry, to be deposited with a thump on the desks of Speer and Schmidt. The news it communicated would be dismissed as comedy if it wasn't so real- the Poles, for whatever insane reason, had declined to negotiate, promising to defend Poland to the final man. Negotiations were dead before they even had the chance to begin.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert sat with a mixture of a sigh and an angered grunt. He'd listened to Schmidt for once, and look where it got them. The Poles thought they were weak, thought that Germany wouldn't be willing to take them on, all because Schmidt had decided to try and throw a rabid dog a carrot. Now, the Heer would need to get its hands dirty. He could already see the coffins, draped in the swastika, coming home from whatever muddy hellhole the Poles were in now. He could see the shitshow in the Reichstag from a mile away. Schmidt had gotten his way, and now look what had happened.\n\nIn Schmidt's office was, somehow, even more depressed than Speer's. Helmut slammed the letter into his trashcan with an angry grunt. He'd gambled, and somehow the Poles had screwed him over for it. What did they expect to happen? All they had done was make things worse for everyone. He sat down and awaited the angry call from a million different officials- the plan had collapsed, and here he was with a giant target on his back. He downed a drink before he took the first one."
speerpoland.11.a:0 "What do they think they're doing?"

speerpoland.12.t:0 "Germans in Poland"
speerpoland.12.d:0 "The tension between the two delegations lay thick and heavy in the conference room. Schmidt's eyes nervously darted across the faces of the Polish negotiators, settling finally on their head- one Stanislaw Wachowiak. Wachowiak's eyes bored right into Schmidt as the clock hit 12, and the meeting officially began.\n\nThe initial pleasantries soon faded away into a mess of diplomatic jargon, as veiled barbs and offers soon flew across the table. Unsurprisingly, it was not long before the first roadblock hit- the status of Germans in Poland.\n\n"The privileges that Germans in Poland held under the Generalgouvernement are unacceptable! We're practically chattel compared to them! Second class citizens in our own nation! We cannot, repeat, cannot go back to the old way of things- not now, not ever! They cannot continue to hold the privileges that they once did!" Wachowiak finished his fiery rant with a hearty slap of the table, to applause from his own delegation. The German delegation turned to Schmidt, his face deep in thought. A partial repeal of the Nuremberg Laws- something he'd wanted for years, but something that may fall well afoul of Speer's expectation. Besides, removing the rights of Germans for the wants of Poles- a group that much of Germany still considered "Untermensch"- was undoubtedly a disaster waiting to happen in itself. However, would the Poles accept a deal without this caveat? He sighed before responding, knowing these words would follow him forever."
speerpoland.12.a:0 "Keep up the Laws."
speerpoland.12.b:0 "The Poles deserve rights."

speerpoland.13.t:0 "Status of the Home Army"
speerpoland.13.d:0 ""Now, Mr. Wachowiak, onto the next topic- the Home Army." Schmidt read from his agenda slowly, taking a breath before continuing. "As previously agreed, the Home Army will disarm and disband, assuming these talks go through. This is correct, yes?"\n\n"Of course." Wachowiak straightened his tie as he spoke. Schmidt rolled his eyes as he reached the next point, bracing himself for the explosion.\n\n"Yes, of course. However, there have been calls from our more conservative counterparts to prosecute some of these men for, ah..." Schmidt could see Wachowiak turning red in the face already, and he readied himself for the explosion. "Ah, treason and terrorism. Now, Mr. Wachowiak, these men did commit acts of violence against the German garrison-"\n\nWachowiak shot to his feet. "You're joking, Herr Schmidt! You can't be serious! You dare call fighting for freedom terrorism? Do you know how hard it's been to get the Home Army to even agree to disarm? They'll go ballistic! If you're going to arrest every freedom fighter in Poland, you may as well arrest this entire delegation, because I cannot think of a Polish man who did not fight the Germans! This is unacceptable, Herr Schmidt, simply unacceptable!" He roared, leaning over the table towards the German. Schmidt massaged his temples- a headache was coming on, and he doubted it would get any better until these talks finished."
speerpoland.13.a:0 "Disarmament shall suffice."
speerpoland.13.b:0 "Terrorism is terrorism."

speerpoland.14.t:0 "Status of Polish Slavery"
speerpoland.14.d:0 ""We both understand that the Führer's policy on slavery is one of dismantlement, is that right?" Wachowiak spoke first this time, his voice having noticeably softened in the last hour or so. The attention of the table once again turned to him, including Schmidt's gaze.\n\n"Yes, that would be true." Schmidt responded, his eyes narrowing, a hint of Wachowiak's game beginning to form in his mind. Another bombshell, if Schmidt's intuition was true.\n\n"And these freed slaves are to be repatriated to their home nations, yes?" Wachowiak's gaze bored into Schmidt, who grew increasingly sure of where this conversation was being taken. He prepared a response in his head- this would be another headache to add to the pile.\n\n"Yes, that's the plan." Schmidt responded, steeling his voice.\n\n"Thousands of Poles still find themselves in German shackles today, Herr Schmidt, with years left before their freedom. Surely, as part of these talks, it's possible to speed their freedom, is it not?" Wachowiak's gaze never left Schmidt's eyes as he tried to think of a diplomatic response to this one.\n\n"Repatriation is a complicated business, especially when combined with-"\n\n"It's a yes-no question, Herr Schmidt." Schmidt slumped a little in his chair. This was never going to end, was it?"
speerpoland.14.a:0 ""I'll try my best, Mr. Wachowiak. That's all I can offer.""
speerpoland.14.b:0 ""Yes, it is, Mr. Wachowiak.""

speerpoland.15.t:0 "Status of the Nuremberg Laws"
speerpoland.15.d:0 "The end of the conference was in sight, and Schmidt for one couldn't wait for it. He had known that his decisions would cause a storm of anger somewhere, no matter what he said, but he couldn't help but feel like this was going to be especially bad. His eyes, which had begun to glaze over with the endless conversation, snapped back to attention when they saw Wachowiak rise from his seat.\n\n"Now, I understand we have already touched on the topic of the Nuremberg Laws-" Oh, christ, Schmidt thought. If there was something to fill his desk with angry letters, it was the Nuremberg Laws." -But we have only spoken of the excessive privilege that Germans held in Poland. What we have not discussed is Polish rights- specifically, how limited they are."\n\nAs Wachowiak went through the list of limits on the Poles, Schmidt's thoughts turned inward. Once again, here was an opportunity to strike another blow at something that he had hated since the day he joined this job- the Nuremberg Laws, an outdated weight on the ankle of Germany, one that needed to be cut off. In any other case, he would not hesitate in cutting another slice into the Laws, but now? The Laws were the main legal guideline for Germany's treatment of the Poles. Such a massive change would definitely be something Speer would like to know about, and that was what was holding Schmidt back. He did not know Speer's position on the issue, and despite how much he disliked the man personally, Speer was the one who controlled his job. To go against him too much might just lead to his dismissal- something Schmidt couldn't allow to happen.\n\n"So, Herr Schmidt, I ask you-" Wachowiak finished with a flourish, leveling an accusatory finger at Schmidt's head. "-Is the Reich truly as reformist as it claims? Will you throw off the shackles that bind Poland?""
speerpoland.15.a:0 "In for a penny..."
speerpoland.15.b:0 "This is too much to ask right now."

speerpoland.16.t:0 "Polish Budget"
speerpoland.16.d:0 ""Before this conference wraps up, Herr Schmidt, we have but one more topic to discuss." Wachowiak carefully pressed forth with the last topic on his paper, catching Schmidt as he was about to rise from his seat. Schmidt froze for a second, his face momentarily betraying the stress this conference had put on him, before he sat back down and gestured for Wachowiak to continue.\n\n"Besides the infrastructure built for Poland to become the Reich's logistical hub, Poland as a whole was neglected by the Reich. Our infrastructure in most places fails, our utilities are on the brink of failing, our roads are dotted with holes and cracks- we're on the brink of a disaster, Herr Schmidt. The Reich's coffers are certainly not empty- perhaps you can send some funds to our new government in order to allow us to rebuild? I promise you, such funds would be spent on infrastructure alone, nothing more."\n\nSchmidt took a deep breath in and out. Of course they were going for the wallet of the Reich now, as if they hadn't already aimed daggers at the rest of the Reich's institutions. Schmidt wasn't opposed to it himself- he just knew that it would maximise the amount of angry paperwork he'd need to sort through in the next month or two. Thoughts of a raging Speer clouded his mind- how many decisions had he already made for the Führer? How many of them had been directly against his wishes?\n\nIn any case, it was the last decision to make, and then they would all shake hands and retire to their hotel rooms. Schmidt could only hope that his decisions would be acceptable to the Polish government- otherwise, this was going to be a mess for everyone involved."
speerpoland.16.a:0 "Grant them money."
speerpoland.16.b:0 "There's no point in it."

speerpoland.17.t:0 "The Treaty is Signed"
speerpoland.17.d:0 "Television crews crowded the conference room, reporters crammed themselves into every nook and cranny of the building, and the flash of cameras rattled like a machine gun. Schmidt did his best not to blink at the barrage- the last thing he needed on top of the inevitable storm he was going to catch was an unflattering image of him smeared across the front pages of every newspaper in Germany.\n\nTo his right, Wachowiak sat and smiled, looking quite pleased with himself. Schmidt couldn't blame him- he was going home a hero, having taken on the German giant and wrangled a deal that Poland could get behind out of it. Schmidt was less enthused himself- he would be going home to a storm of conservative anger and, most likely, at least one or two tense meetings with Speer. Speer hadn't said anything about the terms yet, but some of them would certainly be enough to make him tear what remained of his hair out.\n\nAnd yet, at the end of the day, Schmidt was proud of himself. He'd not only succeeded in his task, but he'd advanced his cause. Germany was on the cusp of entering a new golden age, and with Schmidt's help, he would make sure it would happen. With the treaty signed, who knew what could happen with the rest of Eastern Europe? Perhaps, soon enough, Germany could truly be first among equals in their eyes, not just a colonial overlord.\n\nAnd so, as Wachowiak put pen to paper and signed his name on the treaty, Schmidt's expression turned into a small grin as he put ink to his own."
speerpoland.17.a:0 "The new golden age is almost here."

speerpoland.18.t:0 "The Treaty Falls Apart"
speerpoland.18.d:0 "Schmidt's room was dark, illuminated only by a lamp at his desk casting a yellow glow across it. The darkness hid most of the two men's faces- Schmidt and Wachowiak. Schmidt glanced at the clock- 2 in the morning, always a good time for diplomatic meetings. "So, what's the deal, Wachowiak? We've been waiting for hours. Communication troubles?"\n\n"No, no." Wachowiak was quiet, keeping his voice low. "I've been in contact with Warsaw just fine."\n\n"So what's the issue, then? We can schedule another session-" A drop of fear struck the bottom of Schmidt's gut, a slowly rising tide of worry.\n\n"No, no, Schmidt. It's over. They've left the conference. We're to go home effective immediately. The treaty is unacceptable."\n\nSchmidt's gut shot into his throat, and he choked on his next words. This couldn't happen to him. He couldn't have failed like this. He had wrangled so many things in line, pushed so many things his way, all for nothing? Visions of his face plastered as a scapegoat and fool across every paper in Germany shot through his mind like a bullet. Oh, god, what would Speer say? He'd put all his trust behind Schmidt's idea of a peaceful reconciliation. Now that it had fallen apart, would he ever listen to Schmidt again? Would he ever even try to negotiate again? Schmidt's plans fell apart in front of him as he struggled for words, struggled for air.\n\n"Stanislaw, you can't do this to me!" he shouted, but Stanislaw was already gone, the door shutting behind him. Schmidt was left alone, with only his furious, incredulous, terrified thoughts to keep him company."
speerpoland.18.a:0 "A travesty!"

speerpoland.20.t:0 "Hans Frank Surrenders!"
speerpoland.20.d:0 "The Generalgouvernement has been disbanded, and replaced by a provisory military administration that will ensure a return to normalcy. Our inspectors have already scoured Frank's archives, both public and secret, finding more than enough evidence of his crimes - bribery, embezzlement, falsification of public documents, treason, the list is very long - to permanently seal his fate, but the final choice rests in Speer's hands: should he be executed for his treasonous conduct, or merely imprisoned for life? Both choices would satisfy the population, but each will appeal to one of the currents within the government."
speerpoland.20.a:0 "Frank will meet the hangman."
speerpoland.20.b:0 "Imprisonment will suffice."

 
 ## Bohemian Events ##
 speerbohemia.1.t:0 "Approaching the Bohemians"
 speerbohemia.1.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nThe Reich has long considered Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren to be one of the most successful Germanization projects. As you know, the purpose of the Protektorat is to pacify the local population, and, through the various means available to them, make it so that they are either phased out for ethnic Germans, or educated to the point that we can call them proper Aryans. It has mainly been the second, and it has been a great success at that. The Protektorat, then, has succeeded in its objective; I would consider it now to be a viable territory to be annexed directly into the glorious Reich. I am hopeful that you understand my reasoning for this, Herr Lutz, and that you will comply with my request, which I am certain would not come as a major difficulty for you. Your service has been valuable, and now the next step must be taken.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n- Führer Speer"
 speerbohemia.1.a:0 "Let us see how they will react."

 speerbohemia.2.t:0 "The Bohemian Demands"
 speerbohemia.2.d:0 "This letter is to be addressed to the current Führer Albert Speer.\n\nI greet you warmly, dear Führer, leader of the Reich, the thousand-year Empire, the eagle that soars above Europa. I would gladly accept entry into Germania, seeing as how my leadership of this Protektorat has led to it being established as almost entirely Germanized. There is, however, one issue that remains which both you and I must confront. There has been an issue going around-- a very strange one, at that. We both know of the SS, the cancer that manifests itself as Ordensstaat Burgund, but also as smaller tumors that spread across Europe. They have spread here, too, but fortunately the Czech Guard has, under the leadership of Rudolf Toussaint, beaten back this nest of degeneracy. For that, Rudolf has called for a special proposal to be made. For their efforts, he desires for the Czechs to immediately be recognized as honorary Aryans. My Führer, it is only with you would I have even bothered sending this proposal back to you, for you are an understanding leader. It is my hope that you can accept this compromise in order for the Protektorat to be now and forever be fully integrated into the Reich.\n\nHeil!\n\n- Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk"
 speerbohemia.2.a:0 "Nothing but a small barrier."
 speerbohemia.2.b:0 "The Reich does not bend to the conquered."

 speerbohemia.3.t:0 "An Ultimatum to the Bohemians"
 speerbohemia.3.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nI must bring you unfortunate news. The idea that the Czechs must be turned into honorary Aryans has not been received well in Germania. They may have spilt blood to protect their territory, yes, but they are subservient to the Reich first. They must learn its culture and its ways, they must learn the language, and they must learn that to become a German, you must know what it is to be a German. Anything else would be a disapproving notion of the Germanization process. I'm certain you understand then, Herr Lutz, when I tell you that my asking of the Protektorat to become a part of the Reich is no longer a request. It is a demand. This is, unfortunately, how things must go. I will give you a period of 72 hours to respond. If you do not respond in this time, the consequences will be drastic.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n- Führer Speer"
 speerbohemia.3.a:0 "Pray that they accept."

 speerbohemia.4.t:0 "The Annexation of Bohemia"
 speerbohemia.4.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk,\n\nAfter considering your proposal for quite some time, I have come to achieve a resolution. While it may be slightly unbefitting for the Czechs to become Aryans on the spot, doing so would solve a multitude of our problems. As is the case right now, I cannot stand to comment on the actions of the Schutzstaffel in the Protektorat, but I can assure you that no foreign element will commit any sort of subversion in the territory. With this out of the way, I can congratulate your service for the Reich, Herr Lutz, and you will be rewarded generously in helping Germania expand its dominion to rightfully include all proper Germans, and honorary Aryans, into its home. That is all I shall be writing in this letter. The rest will come naturally, as we can finally say that this chapter of Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren is closed.\n\n- Führer Speer"
 speerbohemia.4.a:0 "More lands to the Empire!"

 speerbohemia.5.t:0 "The Bohemians Refuse"
 speerbohemia.5.d:0 "Speer paid it little thought-- they would accept. Obviously they would. What other choice could they possibly have?! But as the minutes turned into hours turned into days, his anxiety grew and grew. There was a mild annoyance for him after the first twenty-four hours, which turned into a bothering feeling that plagued him for another twenty-four hours, and once the final day had begun, it manifested into Speer pacing in his office, waiting, just waiting, for someone to come through and hand him a note. That they would say, "My Führer, you've received a letter from Reichsprotektorat Lutz," and then bid him a crisp salute before hurrying off.\n\nBut that moment of reprieve never came. Instead, the bell had struck midnight, and Speer almost drew blood from biting in his fingertip as the last seconds of peace slipped past him. Now he had an issue to deal with. Not a big one militarily, but it would show itself to the rest of the world as a glaring hole in Mitteleuropa. If he couldn't peacefully annex one of the most integrated subjects of the Reich, what would that say for all the others? That question crossed his mind many times as he began to draw up a plan of action."
 speerbohemia.5.a:0 "Can something go right in the Reich?"

 speerbohemia.7.d:0 "This letter is to be addressed to the current Führer Albert Speer.\n\nThese past three days have been worrisome, my Führer. Ever since I have received your letter, there has been chaos in the government. Panic struck many of our people, but I can say for certain that I have kept a clear head in these times. Immense pressure has been put on me from Rudolf to continue negotiating these terms. Eventually, however, I forced his hand and he had to back down after a fierce argument we've recently had. I write this letter to you now regarding the concerns between the Reich and the Protektorat with a simple sentence.\n\nWe accept.\n\n- Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk"
 speerbohemia.7.a:0 "I only hope you receive this letter in time."

 ## Danish Events ##
 speerdenmark.1.t:0 "Approaching the Danes"
 speerdenmark.1.d:0 "Speer had always found it a little annoying, if he was to be openly honest about it, that this small nation of not much significance stood tall above the Reich, retaining its full independence and colours on any map printed out. Not only could they be easily swayed to join the Pakt, but he could make a strong case on why they would only benefit such a thing, being close Aryan brothers and having no real land disagreements.\n\nThe idea would be twofold. First, Speer would offer the Danish government a small helping hand upon entering the Pakt, so they could ease themselves in and be comfortable amid the rest of the Reich's allies.\n\nSecond, he would hold a speech that would be televised to viewers home and abroad, where he would testify to the strength of the Reich and the solitary situation the Danish found themselves, which, if they accepted the help of their Aryan brothers below, is something that would be easily rectified.\n\nNow, all that remained was to begin planning."
 speerdenmark.1.a:0 "They will return home."

 speerdenmark.2.t:0 "The Carrot and the Stick"
 speerdenmark.2.d:0 "There was nothing particularly outstanding about Denmark, he thought, once Speer had looked over the economic analysis of the country. Nothing at all that really made it especially valuable besides being another source for manpower and labor to feed into the Reich. That wasn't the concern here, however, even if Speer considered the Danes to be easy candidates for Germanization. They were to become allies first, and anything else would come afterwards.\n\nA short and direct economic plan was drafted up, which would give the Danes small, temporary privileges upon entering the Reich. This would take up a small portion of the Reich's budget, and perhaps annoy the other subjects of the Pakt slightly for favoring them like this, but continuing to consecrate rule across Europa would only benefit everyone involved."
 speerdenmark.2.a:0 "Now onto the next step."

 speerdenmark.3.t:0 "They're Nothing Without Us"
 speerdenmark.3.d:0 "Speer couldn't understand how some men could hold speeches that lasted for so long about such trivial things. This, chiefly, was one of those trivial things. He was already so close in convincing them to join that he was almost visibly annoyed with dragging it out with the Danes by the time he had to begin to address the people listening.\n\nThere was a short interlude whereupon a presenter introduced the many titles of the Führer, inciting roaring applause from the audience that was present, before the man nodded towards Speer as he let him take the stand.\n\n"To the people of Denmark, listen to what I have to say next. I wish to call upon you a simple fact - a statement that cannot be ignored, an issue that cannot be resolved, a bothersome idea that trails behind your every footstep." Speer took a deep breath.\n\n"You are alone. In this reshaping of the New World Order, you are alone."\n\n"All of your troubles, your loneliness, your vulnerability, this will leave you only as prey for greater powers willing to ruin you, bring you down into the sinking depths of history. But we are your Germanic brothers. We are your neighbours, the ones from across the river that shall bid you a warm greeting. We, the men of the Reich, are here for you. Like a man fumbling in the raging river, drowning and calling for help, we will come to you and lend you a hand. And with a mighty Germanic grip, we will pull you out, to the safety of the world, and we will call you a friend of ours."\n\n"Come, Denmark, for the thousand-year Reich shall soar with the rest of Europa on its wings.""
 speerdenmark.3.a:0 "I see how they hold speeches about trivial things, now."

 speerdenmark.4.t:0 "Welcome Home"
 speerdenmark.4.d:0 "Speer let out a sigh of relief. What else was he expecting to happen, really? Considering the geopolitical position of the Danes, there really was only one option left for them to take. The other would leave them stranded and alone, ripe for the taking. As he silently read the letter through in his office, a small, satisfied smile came to his lips. They had agreed, and over the course of the next month, Denmark would begin its entry into the Pakt. Seems like his Germanic rhetoric had worked after all, and the money boost certainly convinced the more pragmatic-minded Danes in their cabinet. The economy of the Einheitspakt would see a small, but noticeable, increase in its wealth, and the maps of Europa printed out in the future could finally shade that small blotch of land in as belonging to the Reich's sphere of influence."
 speerdenmark.4.a:0 "With this taken care of, Speer turns to other issues."

 speerdenmark.5.t:0 "The Extremists to the North"
 speerdenmark.5.d:0 "Damnation! While this wasn't the worst case scenario, it certainly came close to it. With the Hardliners now having a stranglehold on Denmark, there would certainly be no way to introduce them into the Pakt, seeing Speer's position as Führer to be a betrayal of their original values. Whatever they were planning, they had to be stopped and quickly brought under the wing of the Reich. Which is why he had to call for a certain... someone.\n\n"My Führer- it is a pleasure that I have been called to your office," the man in front of Speer spoke, standing tall and straight with a smile on his face. He put a hand out, and they both shook strongly before letting go.\n\n"I have a feeling you already know what I am about to tell you, Herr Reinhardt," Speer spoke, turning around and taking a few steps forwards to his desk.\n\n"I suppose I do, my Führer. This concerns Denmark, doesn't it?" The spymaster spoke, which confirmed Speer's suspicions. He didn't need to respond as his compatriot continued. "I will not speak on the topic of the ideology that has overtaken their government, but I can assure you that this will be an unusual operation." Speer could tell that Reinhardt was hiding something. Distaste, maybe? It didn't matter to him - they were National Socialists that would not compromise, and thus a threat to be destroyed.\n\n"There are already agents in place. What would you like me to do with them?" The response was obvious, but he wanted Speer to announce it for him.\n\n"Set them up for a coup. Your men... this operation will be risky, and if they're caught, they will likely face trial for their crimes. Anything less than treason against the state followed by execution would be a miracle."\n\nReinhardt sighed, but did nothing more. The Führer could tell that the spymaster was getting impatient, and so he turned to face the man with a dismissive hand wave. "You are free to go. This operation is effective immediately.""
 speerdenmark.5.a:0 "There will be no compromise with the Danish."

 speerdenmark.6.t:0 "Men on the Inside"
 speerdenmark.6.d:0 "The radio on the man's desk crackled to life as he approached it, and, sitting down, placed the headphones on his head. The shot of static made him flinch slightly, but the voice that followed afterwards gave him a smile.\n\n"Wilhelm, my friend!" He greeted boisterously, prompting the radio operator to turn down the volume. "How have you been, serving the Reich yonder over the border? I've just been spending my time walking around Copenhagen, monitoring patrols and vehicles. It's not hard work, no, but I assume you've called me for a change of plans, eh?" he laughed.\n\nWilhelm sighed softly. Could he let the man speak? It's almost as if he wasn't needed here. "Yes, Frederick I know what you've been doing recently-- it's my job to keep track of the agents in Denmark. Including you."\n\nThe static crackled back in with another bout of laughter. "That's the fighting spirit," Frederick commented. "Look, I've been seeing someone muck about in a pastry shop I've been frequenting recently. They seem sort of kept to themselves, but I can spot a proper Aryan when I see one! So tell me, is that who I'm--"\n\n"Yes, yes it is." The dull, almost defeated voice cut in. "If Headquarters is hearing this, they will have my neck. We are supposed to be disciplined, so I will give you your orders. Are you listening carefully?"\n\nSilence followed for several seconds afterwards.\n\n"Right then. That man you mentioned... you are to meet him. His name is Oscar Blecher. Greet him with the phrase 'I wish to buy you a Lager, my friend', and he will recognize you right away as a man of the Reich. From then onwards, you are to follow his instructions. Is this clear?"\n\nAgain, silence dominated the radio frequency for a few seconds before Wilhelm spoke up, voice having sombered up. "Yes Bordfunker Wilhelm. I can assume, then, that this is where the operation will begin?"\n\n"If you succeed, we will be able to topple the SS without having to fire a single shot. If not, then-"\n\n"Then nothing!" Wilhelm cut in joyously. "Don't worry about what will or will not happen. I hold no ill will towards the National Socialists here - but they stand in the way of the Reich. In toppling this resistance, I'm doing my service to the Führer. You have other things to tend to, my friend, I'm sure. Goodbye, Bordfunker Wilhelm.""
 speerdenmark.6.a:0 ""Goodbye, Herr Frederick.""
 
 speerdenmark.7.t:0 "Subverting Their Will"
 speerdenmark.7.d:0 "Frederick's pistol fit snugly in his coat as he felt the groove of the barrel while walking through the streets of Copenhagen. He dressed in civilian clothing, naturally, though made sure to wear thick enough clothing to conceal the weapon he was carrying with him. As he looked upon a small band of armed soldiers walking across a narrow street, he stopped up for a moment, glancing at the rifles in their hands for a moment before swiftly turning his head away. He hoped, he thought, he well and truly hoped that he didn't stand out as an oddity in these empty streets as he took the opportunity to scan his surroundings once more. Seeing now that there were no soldiers in this small section of Copenhagen, he dashed into a nearby alleyway, footsteps pounding against concrete that softened into blades of grass and dirt.\n\n"Herr... Frederick?" A voice called out in the darkness. He could recognize who it was. Or, rather, who they were.\n\n"I'm glad you recognized me. Was it my hair?" The sarcasm in his voice was annoyingly audible as a gang of three showed themselves. All three of them seemed heavily armed though lightly armored, carrying Zhdanovs, grenades, each with a set of pistols, and one of them having a submachine gun.\n\n"No, Herr Frederick," spoke the one with the largest weapon, a heavy Danish accent tinting his German. "Nobody would willingly go into this alleyway alone."\n\nHe rolled his eyes. "Of course they wouldn't! I was only making a joke! I..." Frederick sighed as his comedy routine fell flat. "Well, all humor aside, I suppose you gentlemen are here to parley with me. I know we are not friends, certainly, but I am under the orders of my Führer to help your resistance activities. I believe you will find my expertise to be most... exciting, if I may say."\n\n"Yeah?" One of them chimed in. "And you have to offer us what exactly?"\n\nThe German chuckled heartily. "I am not a man of firearms.""
 speerdenmark.7.a:0 ""But if you give me a grenade or two, I can show you a trick.""

 speerdenmark.8.t:0 "The Coup Begins"
 speerdenmark.8.d:0 "He swore he could feel his entire body shaking from that one. Well - it didn't matter now, did it?\n\n"Herr Frederick, if I may be so curious as to ask," came the voice of a man that was nearly drowned out by gunfire, "did the bastard Aryans hire you because they saw your potential, or because you bombed the nearest barr-"\n\nIn speaking of bombs, two pairs of eyes spotted something distinctly hand-grenade-shaped coming their way, with both men giving all their strength to jump the hell away from where it would land. Frederick managed to get himself behind an empty oil barrel, while his other friend, who he came to know as Albert, took cover behind a shot-up, deflated truck. The German could tell when the explosion came when he felt a lack of noise and a presence of ringing in his ears both occurring at the same time, which he took as an opportunity to dust himself off and grip the pistol in his hand properly, turning back around and meeting up with Albert once again.\n\n"All of this just for our country to be handed over to the bloody Aryan," the other man spit out, glaring fiercely. "Shedding the blood of my countrymen... I thought I would be doing this for democracy."\n\nFrederick grinned. "Look at it this way, my Danish friend- we coup your country, we install a vague semblance of democracy. You enter the Pakt, you prosper from it. It's so simple, I hardly doubt anyone would say no to it."\n\nAlbert audibly grumbled at that last part, only being stopped from speaking by being forced to duck his head under a shower of gunfire.\n\nThe conversation stopped for a few seconds to let the noise calm down enough for someone to actually be audible. "I hate this," Albert growled.\n\n"Don't look at me like that!" Frederick responded with fake concern. "Come on...""
 speerdenmark.8.a:0 ""At least we're getting rid of the Hardliners for you.""

 speerdenmark.9.t:0 "The Coup Fails"
 speerdenmark.9.d:0 "Frederick finally found himself some peace and quiet. In this abandoned-out building, he could rest for just a little bit. As he entered a room, he noticed that there was an abandoned sniper sitting perched up on a window, obviously aiming outside. His eyes widened and also shined when he spotted the weapon, even letting out a small 'ooh' as he approached it. Examining it carefully, he could see what it was. And the results were outstanding - it was a vintage weapon! Even more than that, it was a modified vintage weapon. The Karabiner 98 kurz with a scope mounted on top. Frederick was no marksman, but if this plan went successfully, then he could perhaps take this and keep it for himself as a reward for his service when he returned home. Though, he hadn't heard from his allies outside in a while, he was certain that everything would go alright.\n\nThat was, until he heard the soft sound of footsteps behind him. Frederick froze in place; he recognized the distance immediately, and it was not one that he would risk turning around for. Instead, he opted to slowly raise his arms up in the air, closing his eyes for a short while and taking a deep breath. The voice that came afterwards he only understood in fragments, but he didn't have to translate it. "German," he said, "I am a German. I don't understand Danish," he continued, and there was nothing in response for a second or two afterwards, which made the anxiety in his stomach grow heavier. Then, he heard a sigh, and another pair of footsteps. "You are coming with me, Aryan." It was slow, broken up and paced awkwardly, but it would make do. "Trial for treason."\n\nFrederick bit his lower lip. What the hell was he to do now except hand himself over? There was something, at least - a question that burned in his mind that he wanted answered before the inevitable came. "What has happened to the others outside?" A quick, cruel laughter came to meet his question. "Idiotic Aryan. Is it not clear?""
 speerdenmark.9.a:0 "You have failed your mission. Now, come, with the rest of the scum."

 speerdenmark.10.t:0 "Formalizing The Ultimatum"
 speerdenmark.10.d:0 ""To the people of Denmark..."\n\nSpeer crossed one leg over the other and stared at the typewriter. How was he going to formulate this...? "The situation has turned dire." He was to emphasize the danger the Danes were putting themselves in. Something about how the mistake they have made was grave, but in a way that showed strength, not desperation. "The Reich is unafraid to show why it is the Master of Europa." That would certainly catch their attention. Furthermore, he had to showcase that there is no degeneracy plaguing Germania. After all, if he wanted them to join the Pakt as well, he wanted to get them on their good side. And so...\n\n"... Ever since our magnificent victory so long ago, we have established a Reich that would last for generations to come. This is unprecedented in history. The empires of old - the Achaemenids, the Romans, the Francians, the British, they all share one fatal flaw in common. They relied on the strength of their arms, not on the strength of their people. We, however, are unified in our cause. It is, therefore, imperative that your people understand their position."\n\nHere Speer took a gamble.\n\n"The Reich's strength is unparalleled, its discipline unrivalled, and we do not wish to bring the full might of the Wehrmacht upon your nation. It would only bring ruin. Instead, we demand that you do two things. First, you will release every man related to the attempted coup in Copenhagen. They will be guaranteed safety, whether German or Danish, from any acts of violence against them. Secondly, the nation of Denmark will enter the Einheitspakt, and will be treated as any regular member. Your opportunity to join as a special member has passed. Now there is only one choice to be made.""
 speerdenmark.10.a:0 "For the Danish Volk, I hope you make the correct choice."

 speerdenmark.11.t:0 "Denmark Refuses"
 speerdenmark.11.d:0 "Frederick was restrained from head to toe - not only did he have cuffs on, he also had a see-through bag on his head. Really, he thought, this was absurd. Admittedly he had only seen one trial in-person, and that was for a theft of goods in his hometown. The court wasn't nearly as grand as this, and nor was the judge as loud as the one he heard beforehand. He could barely understand what he was hearing, either, but the sinking feeling he had would tell him everything he needed to know. Here and there, while uncomfortably shuffling in his seat, he could hear the judge yelling out words like 'treason', 'betrayal', 'court', and probably a couple of swears here and there. The lump in his throat grew bigger as time passed, and a few questions were wandering his mind. Mainly, how long this whole charade would take. He thankfully had no family to worry about when he would eventually be dug into a ditch, but still, the idea of execution did not sound nice to him.\n\nThe slam of a gavel rang in his ears after two entire hours passed, and Frederick let out a breath he didn't realize he was keeping in for so long. Being roughly picked up by two guards, he felt a tremor go down his back. Shit - this was really happening, wasn't it? He was about to be brought out to the back to be executed like a dog, by people whose ideology he could share common ground with. A National Socialist executing another National Socialist. Frederick could only muster a shaky grin to himself as he closed his eyes, sending out a prayer to whatever deity was watching that some freak accident would happen.\n\nHe grunted when his body hit the dirt, and grit his teeth when he gave a single attempt at trying to break free of his restraints. There was too much ringing in his mind to hear whatever the hell was going outside of the confines of the bag on his head, and his uneven breaths bothered him. What did he say before? That he was an agent of the Reich? That he would lay his life down on the line? Well, now he was, in the most literal sense possible. Frederick found that a bit ironic, actually. So ironic that his lips parted as teeth bared themselves.\n\nToo bad he never got the time to let out a chuckle."
 speerdenmark.11.a:0 "It seems that the Danish have denied the ultimatum."

 speerdenmark.12.t:0 "Denmark Accepts"
 speerdenmark.12.d:0 "Frederick felt groggy in this cell. Perhaps it was the significantly different change of pace that he was used to. Perhaps it was the fact that he was stripped of all his pride down to prisoner's clothing. And it might just be the fact that he was about to get sent to his death. Who knows? Frederick sure as hell didn't, stuck in here and unable to hear news from the rest of the world. By the time the next morning came, he felt hungry, thirsty, and sure as hell annoyed. He knew how this trial would conclude, so what was taking them so long?\n\nThe answer came in the form of a knock on his cell that caught his attention.\n\n"Herr Frederick," the man in the uniform said, drawing each syllable out.\n\n"Yes, what is it? Am I finally getting the bullet? Or am I reaching the chamber first before that happens?" He sarcastically bit back, standing up to his feet and staring at what looked like to be his jailer.\n\n"No, Herr Frederick. You are getting released."\n\n"What?"\n\n"You heard me correctly. You are being released. Do I have to repeat this to you again?"\n\n"No... you don't." He wasn't willing to admit it openly, but a massive weight was lifted from his shoulders when he heard that he wasn't about to go six feet under. "Why, however?"\n\nThe jailor stared at him with a mixture of boredom and disgust. "Your Führer has, to put it bluntly, threatened to invade our nation if we did not release you all and join your Pakt." He could almost feel the sneering expression from here. "I hope you are happy. Now," he began, plugging a key into the entrance. "Get out." He finished, emphasizing it with a click as the door opened.\n\nWith a massive grin that was quickly tempered by his want to not get beaten up by the guard, Frederick walked out feeling like a new man. Though, something crossed his mind when he took the first step beyond bars."
 speerdenmark.12.a:0 "Can I keep the Karabiner I found... ?"
 
 speerdenmark.13.t:0 "The Coup Succeeds"
 speerdenmark.13.d:0 "Being in full uniform while laying down in an apartment bed was uncomfortable, Frederick noted. It was especially uncomfortable when he made the unwise decision of dragging cigarette smoke out of his mouth, resulting in a quick coughing fit as he struggled to sit up straight. Even after participating in open rebellion, nearly getting a bullet lodged into his brain, and explosions rocking him so hard he's likely going to lose his hearing by the time he was in his sixties, the German almost succumbed on the spot to one stupid decision. "The things that happen in life," he coughed out, mumbling to himself while he stared down at the wooden floor below. "That wouldn't have gotten me any medal of honor. Now where the hell-"\n\nThe banging on the door riddled with bullet holes made him jump in fright, reaching for his pistol and only stopping when he heard his native tongue being spoken. "Herr Frederick?" The voice called out. "Your car has arrived. I would suggest leaving immediately, as it would be best if we don't risk some rogue agent shooting up your vehicle." That made him crack a smile as he got up. He still kept the pistol at his side, however, just to be on the safe side. "I hope the Danes are not terrified of me when I step out.", "No, they-- Come on, Herr Frederick, if you want to be applauded for your efforts, you'll have time for it during the trip back to Germania.", "Fine, fine."\n\nDriving through the streets of Copenhagen now, once the violence had settled, felt strange to him. Surrounding the center of the city, Frederick could see clearly the aftereffects of what happened. Bloodied and burnt bodies with emptied-out weapons would be a common sight, with some places being warzones that he himself had to pass through. "So then, once I come home I believe I can safely say that I will be duly rewarded for my efforts," Frederick proudly spoke, staring out the car window while he talked. "The Führer will be most pleased to hear this news, after all, and I could see myself earning a raise in pay. Hmm... the possibilities." He turned to the driver who kept his focus narrow on the road. "Hey, what do you think will happen when I come home? Maybe they'll let me keep a souvenir gun at home? Ooh, I love bolt-action rifles. The noise they make when they shoot is so satisfying, and the click of the bolt...""
 speerdenmark.13.a:0 "The road back was long and arduous. Except for Frederick."

 ## Holland Events
 speerholland.1.t:0 "Meeting with the Dutch"
 speerholland.1.desc:0 "There is much reason for Germany to rejoice, with the civil war over, and the heart of the Reich secured under the banner of its new leader, Albert Speer. For the reunification of the Volk, however, there remain many battles still to be won. The Germanic people of Europe are divided, scattered across the continent, a stark contrast to Hitler's grand alliance system, and a definite liability to the new regime in Germania. To the west, Germany's brothers in Holland have yet to rejoin the Pakt, leaving both the Vaterland and the Netherlands in a precarious position.\n\nFor the new Führer, and Foreign Minister Schmidt, reentry of Holland has become a diplomatic priority, and negotiations with [HOL.GetLeader] and the rest of the Hague are being planned. Within Speer's cabinet, there is much uncertainty about the coming meeting, but on the outside, Germany's head of state is all smiles and waves for the people. He reaffirmed this confidence to the public before he and his plane departed from Germania, ensuring the Völkischer Beobachter a quote for their headline:\n\n"The Dutch know where their blood belongs.""
 speerholland.1.a:0 "Gute Reise, mein Führer!"

 speerholland.2.t:0 "Germanic Brotherhood"
 speerholland.2.desc:0 "Was he certain once? He was certain he wasn't now. Decades under the doctrine of any belief can push the faith of any man, especially the smart ones, and, if anything, Speer certainly considered himself clever.\n\nIt was precisely this intelligence which commanded Speer to appeal to the Dutch reactionaries through race in his negotiations. In a speech to a collection of statesmen in the political capital of the Netherlands, the Führer connected the philosophical genius of the Dutch Descartes and Voetius, with the German Leibniz and Goethe. He connected the diplomatic centrality of the Hague with Bismarck's focus on alliances and peace. Both nations, Speer went on, shared a common history of honourable monarchies and fair republics, feudal states and global empires. Truly, there was a unique and profound link, at the level of blood, that connected the Dutch and the Germans in a genetic brotherhood. At this conclusion, a raucous applause erupted from the gathered crowd in the Binnenhof.\n\nSpeer was certain about the Jews, but he wondered if Europe had another inferior subhuman infesting it, even after all this time. The proud Aryans of Speer's homeland clung onto every word of Germanic superiority that emerged from their Führer's mouth. A million conservative ears, from Amsterdam to Danzig, fixated on his voice in their radios and television sets. Like pigs, the true Untermenschen of the Reich lapped up Speer's lies."
 speerholland.2.a:0 "We're brothers in race."

 speerholland.3.t:0 "Wooing the Dutch"
 speerholland.3.desc:0 "It was in his negotiations that Speer realised he had underestimated the Dutch. Dealing with a nation built on foundational traditions of economic, diplomatic and trading expertise was not, he discovered, a walk in the park. To woo the Dutch, Speer (after some amount of stern lecturing and heated argumentation originating from one Ludwig Erhard) elected to offer them economic subsidies. Instead of the immediate acceptance he had hoped for, the German Führer was met with the smiling faces of the Dutch ministry, reliably followed by Erhard sending Speer a responsive glare. They demanded more. Much more.\n\nSpeer was faced with a decision. He could cave and hand the Dutch their favored subsidies, which would curry favour in the Hague and guarantee them joining the Pakt, but harm both Germany's treasury and the Führer's legitimacy. On the other hand, Speer could refuse, try to call the Hague's bluff, while maintaining his image and his resources, but reducing the potential sympathies of the Netherlands for the Pakt, and certainly alienating Germany from Holland's favour."

 speerholland.4.desc:0 "Stern gazes and tight handshakes in the Hague today, as the Führer and the Netherlands have finally come to a compromise surrounding the matter of subsidies. Formalities abound, with [HOL.GetLeader] and Speer engaging in all the manners of true Germanic statesmen. An image of the two is to cover the front page of the Völkischer Beobachter, the leaders smiling, their arms around each other. It will make for a good headline and an excellent symbol for the renewed unity of the nations.\n\nThese are just the necessary appearances, however; neither the Dutch nor the Germans are entirely pleased with the outcome. In any event, with an imperfect agreement reached, the negotiations are almost ready to conclude..."
 speerholland.4.a:0 "Politics is not an exact science."

 speerholland.5.t:0 "They Always Want More..."
 speerholland.5.desc:0 "Word from the Hague is that the Führer's scheme has failed. Outwitting the Dutch proved too much for Germania's new cabinet, and on top of this, Holland has demanded more than their initial subsidy request. With Erhard fuming, it looks like there is no choice for Speer but to concede defeat and agree with the new demands. The Netherlands are guaranteed to return into the fold once more, but at the loss of Germany's dignity, the treasury's wallet, and the Führer's eardrums, once Erhard is through with them."
 speerholland.5.a:0 "Gott verdammt!"

 speerholland.6.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
 speerholland.6.desc:0 "After a long, and not in the slightest easy process, Holland has reentered the Pakt. Ceremonies are being held in Germania, the Hague, Amsterdam, and elsewhere across the two nations. The papers are decorated with messages of Aryan brotherhood, while the streets are adorned with the twin banners of the Prinsenvlag and the Swastika, flailing together in the wind.\n\nHolland and the Reich are now themselves flailing together in the wind. In a hostile world still haunted by Hitler's ghost, one more ally for the new Reich is far from taken for granted by the Führer. This new development has not saved him from the punishment of returning home, however. Erhard has developed quite the list of criticisms for the Führer's handling of the subsidy situation, with the plane from the Hague to Germania providing just enough time to go through them. Unlike his economic counterpart, Schmidt has little say on the matter for now.\n\nSpeer is scarcely paying attention to either. As the plane lifts off Dutch soil, the Führer stares out over the cityscape as it fades into the countryside. The old man sighs. One more nation, he thinks."
 speerholland.6.a:0 "Heims in Reich."

 speerholland.7.t:0 "The Madmen to the West"
 speerholland.7.desc:0 "In the absence of Germania's oversight, the Dutch have fallen into a particularly vile mode of governmental insanity. The Schutzstaffel have seized control of Holland, and have begun emulating the program of their brethren in Burgundy. In place of the old Reichskommissariat, the Himmlerite system has spread to cover the whole of the Low Countries. Speer was no thrall to the Nazi doctrine of the German heartland, and had moments of sincere doubt about the party's racial ideology. There was no doubt, however, that whatever the faults of the Reich, the wholesale slaughter and enslavement of good Germanic men and women being committed by the new Dutch regime were crimes of a uniquely wicked breed.\n\nKiesinger and Speer talk quietly with each other just outside the Reichstag's main hall. They are facing away from the rest of the cabinet, pointing and muttering about a piece of paper the Führer is gripping. His speech. The two old men exchange a glance of reassurance, before Kiesinger gives his leader a pat on the back, and follows Speer out in front of the crowd.\n\nSpeer took pride in the Volkshalle. It was a magnificent building, and the Führer considered it as much a symbol of his own expertise as the purported Volk it symbolised. He gazed out at the hundreds of faces that comprised the reichstag, placing his speech on the podium before him.\n\n"In our time of crisis," he began, "it seems our enemies have taken advantage of Germany's distracted might. The madmen to the West spread their tendrils, and if this cancer is left unchecked, it will form a malignant growth, the type that would fell lesser nations. We are not, however, a lesser nation. The German people will not fall silent while our brothers and sisters are murdered in Holland. As I speak, our brave Wehrmacht is moving across the Dutch border, and we will not halt until the Reich's flag flies over Amsterdam.""

 speerholland.8.t:0 "We've Got Work To Do"
 speerholland.8.desc:0 "Speer had promised a war and a war he had won. Like the Romans of old, Speer enjoys some form of a triumphal parade in Germania, as the citizens of his Reich celebrate victory over Holland. Speer was a reformist, perhaps, but that did not mean he could not appreciate the finer pleasures of a Führer.\n\nFor Speer, this celebration was momentary. The Reich now occupied foreign territory, but could not retain military oversight forever. The Dutch would have their nation back, reintegrated into the Pakt, and with a stronger bond to Germania than before. The Chancellery, the Volkshalle and the Hague are now moving in sync with unity of purpose. The long march to civilian rule in the Netherlands has begun."
 speerholland.8.a:0 "Nous Maintiendrons"

 speerholland.9.t:0 "A Propaganda Campaign"
 speerholland.9.desc:0 "Speer tapped his pen against his closed mouth, alone in the Chancellery office. The Führer's brow is furrowed. Holland is back in the Reich, yes, and the various ministries and state apparatus of Germany are working day-in-day-out in the reconstitution of the Netherlands. The land of the Dutch has been seized, but Speer knows that their hearts and minds are yet to be won. The Spartan ideology clouds their thoughts, and after any stint of SS rule, the citizenry may feel that their loyalties lie more in Nanzig than Germania.\n\nSpeer picks up the phone, and dials for Kiesinger. The tone fades into the Deputy Führer's familiar silvery tones. Speer speaks. "Kurt, I need you to rally some support in the Volkshalle. I want a propaganda campaign in Holland, in support of our government of course. Yes, posters, radio broadcasts, television shows, just get whatever you can get from the good folks in the party. You can do that? Thank you Kurt. Take care."\n\nThe Führer puts the phone down, and gazes out onto the Chancellery lawn."
 speerholland.9.a:0 "Peace is hell."

 speerholland.10.t:0 "Finding the Perfect Leadership"
 speerholland.10.desc:0 "The reports coming in from the Hague look promising. Holland's citizenry are giving growing approval in surveys across the country, notably a growing enthusiasm for the conduct of the Einheitspakt and confidence in the Netherlands' place inside it. The Volkshalle, of course, can barely contain its enthusiasm at the news. It seems that the propaganda campaign was a glowing success.\n\nRumour round the informed circles of Germania is that Schmidt and Speer are to meet in the Chancellery this afternoon. With the prospects looking better, the foreign minister and the Führer will be discussing who to nominate for leadership of the newly reintegrated low countries."
 speerholland.10.a:0 "How exciting!"

 speerholland.11.t:0 "A Return to Civilian Rule"
 speerholland.11.desc:0 "Even amongst the rough humanity presented by the Nazi Party, Speer can always find a way. It was not just him, to be fair. The perfect leadership for Holland would not have been found without the help of Kiesinger and Schmidt, sure. Speer knew, however, that his vision had paved the way, and now with good men loyal to the Reich moving toward the Hague, Germania was one step closer towards its former glory.\n\nIn Holland, civilian government is slowly but surely being returned. The propaganda campaign and the leadership team have proved themselves remarkably. Now, as the military administration is dismantled, all traces of the SS have been removed. An operation successful, if the Führer did say so himself."

 speerslovakia.1.t:0 "Gateway to the Balkans"
 speerslovakia.1.d:0 "To the south of Germany, bordering our territories in Schlesien and Mähren, lie the Carpathian Mountains. This great wall of rock caged the newly unified Hungary in the 9th Century, and before that had been the barrier that even the great Romans could not reach before being halted in their eastern expansion. It is a bulwark, and a blight on our influence in the Balkans, and beyond.\n\nThere is a solution here, albeit a simple one. Winning over Slovakia would bypass the Carpathians and give the Reich a wider border with Hungary. Additionally, the reintegration of Slovakia into the Pakt would regain Germany an old ally, increasing our legitimacy in the eyes of both the public, and abroad. Considering this, the Führer has sent an ultimatum to Bratislava; rejoin the Pakt or face invasion."
 speerslovakia.1.a:0 "Seems an obvious choice."
 
 speerslovakia.2.t:0 "An Ultimatum from the North"
 speerslovakia.2.d:0 "Slovakia has received an envoy from the German foreign ministry; they are demanding that we either rejoin their Einheitspakt or accept invasion. A damning choice if ever there was one.\n\nOn the one hand, we have little choice, with the German Heer far outweighing our own standing army and our extensive border with them allowing a swift invasion on their part. On the other, we would essentially be forfeiting much of our international sovereignty, both economic and political, and our population might not see eye to eye with us on choosing Germania's path."
 speerslovakia.2.a:0 "Cave to the beast. Better bloodless servitude than futile war."

 speerslovakia.4.t:0 "Bratislava Refuses"
 speerslovakia.4.d:0 "The fools in Slovakia have gone against Germania's gracious offer. Our diplomats have returned to Germania empty-handed; Slovakia intends on defying the Reich.

 ###Ostland events###
 speer.900.t:0 "The Rank And File"
 speer.900.d:0 "Ostland is secured once again, and even now our men began the arduous task of restoring order to the war-torn region. The new regime that has been put in place is already reporting record numbers of enemy combatants- either surrendering, engaging our forces, or being caught fleeing the country. Most importantly, however, is the question of what we do with the captured soldiers.\n\nThese men- soldiers who fought under the regime of Otto-Heinrich Drechsler- are predominantly lower-ranking officers, such as lieutenants and sergeants. However, these men have committed treason- a crime punishable with anything up to death. To try them as traitors would certainly drive our point home and shore up our positions, but would also deprive the Heer of experienced, loyal soldiers. Meanwhile, pardoning these men would weaken our case and benefit the reactionaries, but these men would certainly be useful within our ranks. The decision falls to Albert Speer."
 speer.900.a:0 "Pardon them. They're not the men responsible."
 speer.900.b:0 "No mercy for traitors."

 speer.901.t:0 "An Ally In The East?"
 speer.901.d:0 ""Meyer-Landrut won? Interesting." Speer rubbed his jaw in contemplation.\n\n"Indeed. While of course I'd hoped for this outcome I hadn't expected it. He's maintained that you were the best choice as Führer since his uprising began. No doubt he'll be eager to rejoin the Reich."\n\n"No doubt."\n\nSchmidt had expected more - wasn't Speer pleased? "With your permission I will send him an invitation to Germania. I'll handle the negotiations for Ostland's handover personally."\n\n"Yes... and no. I want to meet him myself, get the measure of the man." Another surprise."
 speer.901.a:0 "As you wish."

 speer.902.t:0 "The Eastern Question"
 speer.902.d:0 "By God, Landrut could talk. Since his arrival in Germania he had been gushing to Speer about this reform and that, barely giving him a chance to get a word in edgeways. Albert preferred it that way however. It gave him a better chance to determine what sort of man he truly was - an idealist who believed in democracy, or a pragmatist choosing his words to obtain popular support. A dangerous element to be removed, or a man he could work with. His fingers toyed at the button beneath his desk as Landrut went on and on. A single push, and the guards outside would have Landrut in a cell within seconds. His advisors would be furious to find out he had arrested a reformist ally, but wasn't he already weighting his cabinet so much with liberal sympathizers? He didn't fear the Gang, yet for that moment his finger felt heavier than any steel glove. Landrut seemed to have noticed his contemplation, for he stopped his waffling for a moment. "Mein Führer? Is something wrong?""
 speer.902.a:0 "Damn it all..."
 speer.902.b:0 "I do not fear the Gang. Press the button."

 speer.903.t:0 "Too Much at Stake"
 speer.903.d:0 ""Mein Führer? Is something wrong?" Speer was broken from his reverie when Landrut ceased his speech. Andreas had been expecting... well, he hadn't been quite sure, but he had expected some response to his plans. Surely the man would be champing at the bit to incorporate his ideas, some of the only truly reformist ideas in the Reich - apart from his own, of course. Instead, he had just listened.\n\n"My apologies Andreas, I simply have a lot on my mind. It is good to find a true...ally in these trying times. I am grateful for your work in Ostland, and now that it has been restored to the Reich we can get to work with our plans. Ostland will receive the funding necessary, albeit you surely understand your...ideas, will take some time to be implemented in the Reich at large. But your experimentations within Ostland can resume uninterrupted, as long as you give the proper reports."\n\nWith that the Führer clearly considered the meeting over, as he rose and extended his hand. Meyer-Landrut clasped it in a firm grip, and shook it with enthusiasm.\n\n"Of course - the Führer's work is never done. Heil Speer!" He extended his arm in salute. When there was no response, he opened the door, chastened.\n\nOutside the door were half a dozen hulking Orpo officers, each one with their eyes locked on Andreas. He gulped. Surely, he didn't warrant such measures? He did his best to ignore the fact that they had their hands on their holstered pistols, and made his way out."
 speer.903.a:0 "Not now. Later, but not now."

 speer.904.t:0 "Idealism is a Fool's Game"
 speer.904.d:0 ""Herr Meyer-Landrut, you are under arrest for treason against the acting Reichskommissar of Ostland."\n\nMeyer-Landrut's mouth hung agape as the doors behind Speer opened with a crash, and half a dozen Orpo agents stormed into the room. As he tried to rise, his head was instead slammed against the table and handcuffs forced onto his wrists.\n\n"Mein Führer, I don't understand? I thought you were -" Whatever he was about to say was cut off as a bag was forced over his head. As he was frogmarched from the room, Speer didn't spare him a glance, instead contemplating the glass in his hand. It would do to call upon the Abwerfront to make a cover story about Landrut's tragic disappearence, and he knew the Gang wouldn't swallow it. Dialling his phone, he called the Orpo, to direct personally Landrut's "accident". While he knew the people that wouldn't buy it, he could put someone more "representative" to the Reich's interests in Ostland...\n\nBut, in this particular moment, he felt a pride in his chest rising, acting like a proper Führer. Beholden to anyone but his will, free to separate the wheat from the separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nPerhaps, one day, that will be simply routine for the Reich's Architect."
 speer.904.a:0 "Soon. Not now, but soon."

 speerostland.6.t:0 "Dinner in Riga"
 speerostland.6.d:0 "Schmidt was already seated when Stahlecker entered the restaurant. The foreign minister stood, extending a hand. "Herr Stahlecker. A pleasure." The Reichskommissar grimaced and took Schmidt's hand before sitting.\n\n"Now, I assume you understand why we've called these negotiations. Germania is interested in returning Ostland into the Reich after our unfortunate separation. Are there any particular conditions your government is interested in?"\n\nStahlecker eyed the man opposite him carefully. "I would like to keep my position as Reichsminister in your new Ostland. And I would like immunity for my men. These are my requests."\n\n"One moment, Herr Stahlecker, I need to take a call."\n\nSpeer was on the other end of the line, and Schmidt relayed the information. The Führer and the foreign minister were faced with two choices. On the one hand, accepting Stahlecker's demands might ease the negotiation process and appease the existing regime there. On the other, a show of force and denial of Stahlecker's requests would appease the conservatives in the Party, and demonstrate Speer's courage and power as Führer. Speer pondered the options, and made his decision, hanging up the phone."
 speerostland.6.a:0 "Accept the demands. The less blood, the better."
 speerostland.6.b:0 "Push Stahlecker further. We're the Reich, not him."

 speerostland.7.t:0 "Investigating Insurgents"
 speerostland.7.d:0 ""Herr Stahlecker, the Führer is unable to fully grant one of your requests." The Reichskommissar eyed Schmidt sternly. "In good news, the majority of your said conditions can be guaranteed."\n\n"What is the catch, Herr Schmidt."\n\n"Your lower cabinet members will need to be investigated for security purposes. They may pose a considerable threat to the government in Germania, due to their links with the traitorous Bormann. I'm sure you understand that, in these trying times, the safety, wellbeing and stability of the Reich's people are of utmost importance to the Führer, and we can't be taking any major risks." Schmidt forced a smile. "For the good of the country, Herr Stahlecker."\n\nThe Ostlander stared at the table, grimacing. Schmidt observed him, wondering what thoughts lay behind those half glazed eyes."
 speerostland.7.a:0 "For the good of the country."

 speerostland.8.t:0 "A Begrudging Acceptance"
 speerostland.8.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "I mean no disrespect, Herr Schmidt, but the past is the past. These are good men. Any grievances they may have had with your people can surely be overcome peacefully."\n\n"Herr Stahlecker, I appreciate your concern for your fellow Germans. Really, it is an honourable trait to have. As I said, however, the times cannot call for the sort of leniency that may have otherwise been desirable. In an ideal world, I would agree with you. Let bygones be bygones. The Führer, however, does not orchestrate an Elysium. We are building it, and we cannot allow workers who might pour sugar into our concrete. The new Germany needs stability."\n\nAnother long silence, before Stahlecker finally spoke. "Okay. I will comply."\n\nSchmidt smiles warmly. "Thank you, Reichskommissar. One moment, please. I have to take this call.""
 speerostland.8.a:0 "Our negotiations push for more concessions, the man seems agreeable."
 speerostland.8.b:0 "Our negotiations accept Stahlecker's concessions, he has sacrificed much."

 speerostland.9.t:0 "No Reich for Old Men"
 speerostland.9.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "Do you remember what we saw out there, Herr Schmidt? During the war? You weren't there for long, were you?"\n\n"Herr Stahlecker-"\n\n"I won't be coddled or convinced with a 'Herr', Schmidt." Stahlecker leant forward and stood slightly, pressing his palms into the table as he stared directly into the foreign minister's eyes.\n\n"We saw a countryside littered with Jewry and Bolshevism. We saw a land once roamed by our German and Baltic forefathers corrupted with the burning greed and degeneracy of the Slavic swine. It was disgusting, Schmidt. It was horrifying. When we cleansed it, we liberated the land from its filth. Yet we did not go far enough."\n\nStahlecker stood up from the table. "Ostland has been through a civil war, and my men won it. We fought the forces of Jewry and Bolshevism with a loyalty to the party, and to the ideas of Hitler and National Socialism. Bormann, Bormann represented those loyalties. You, and that fraudulent Führer of yours, would return Ostland to these devils. My men, they have committed crimes by the standard of your petty courts. They loved Bormann. Under your false laws, they are guilty, but under God, they are innocent."\n\nThe Reichskommissar, before Schmidt could respond, had walked out the door.

 speerostland.10.t:0 "A Second Demand"
 speerostland.10.d:0 "Schmidt put down the phone. His eyes had already communicated enough information to Stahlecker for a single glance to turn the Reichskommissar into a daze of despair. "Herr Stahlecker, the Führer has requested that the investigations might widen their scope."\n\nStahlecker sighed audibly. "I understand your reservations about this, but you must understand that the Reich cannot afford any chances at any level of government, especially the higher levels. Think of what one disloyal minister could do. Fraudulent documents, leaked information; sabotage at these levels could ruin the Reich."\n\nIn the Reichskommissar's head, thoughts were buzzing. His men were being threatened. This regime, this new Germany, this new Führer, they didn't care about him or his people. But did he have a choice? If he didn't comply, then what? The Heer would simply storm the border, and his government would be wiped off the face of the planet. Besides, Schmidt hadn't mentioned anything about him being put on trial himself..."

I understand how difficult this must be for you, but it is in all Germany's best interest. Excuse me for one moment, I need to take this call...""
 speerostland.11.a:0 "Give the man a break. A peaceful transition is now more than possible."

 speerostland.12.t:0 "A Bridge Too Far"
 speerostland.12.d:0 "Stahlecker glared at Schmidt. A palpable rage stretched across the man's face as he did so, breaking the facade of courtesy he had built up over the course of the negotiation. "You would have every German in Ostland hung for treason, Herr Schmidt. Your 'reformists' in Germania are no better than the savages of Burgundy."\n\nThe Reichskommissar stood, Schmidt staring in a frozen awe. "When Bormann fell, so did the last hope for the Reich. Your petty Führer doesn't deserve to even be called a German."\n\nWith a mild flourish of his coat, Stahlecker turned and left the room. Above the room and across Yggdrasil, the drums of war in Asgard began to beat. In the quiet of the negotiations chamber, Schmidt could hear them, just barely. A sign from the gods of more to come."

 speerostland.13.t:0 "A Final Demand"
 speerostland.13.d:0 "The phone hit the shelf, and Schmidt returned to the table. "A final issue to iron out, Herr Stahlecker."

"The Führer requests that you undergo a trial, a fair one, just to ensure Germania understands your past. I personally trust that you would remain quiet loyal to the Reich, Herr Reichskommissar, but to secure the doubts in my government, I would recommend this path."\n\nStahlecker's depressed expression morphed into something of an abject terror. "I would keep in mind, Herr Stahlecker, that refusal to comply with these demands may end with more trouble for you and your government than compliance.""

I invited you here to discuss our options. You'll be leading a diplomatic envoy to the East to deal with the situation there. Any ideas?"\n\nSchmidt shuffled in his seat. "Well, my Führer..." His voice trailed off.\n\n"I'm listening, Schmidt."\n\n"I think it would be best to negotiate with Stahlecker. It might win us favour with the conservatives and give a show of force by punishing the traitor. We could force him into a harsh agreement and reintegrate Ostland back into the Reich that way. An enemy gone, territory gained and our friends in the Party might look at us with kinder eyes."\n\nSpeer stared into middle distance, thinking, but slowly nodding in approval. Schmidt couldn't help a slight, genuine smile at the peaceful route being favored. "Or," Speer began, "we might declare war immediately. Rally the support of the reformists in a direct action and put him down quickly and effectively."\n\nSchmidt's expression morphed into something more familiarly depressed as he slouched in his chair.

 speerostland.18.t:0 "Drechsler in Ostland"
 speerostland.18.d:0 ""Otto-Heinrich Drechsler. Militarist, expansionist, traitor, and victor." Speer read the report slowly, carefully taking in every detail. He knew Drechsler from his experience before the Bürgerkrieg. The man was a paranoid coward, constantly itching for a fight, being a general pain. It was a surprise he'd never been disposed of.\n\nAnd yet, even as he caused problems in the east. Speer realized something. Drechsler was the perfect heel. Not only was he a traitor, but he was a militarist. Somehow, in losing- apparently, there had been a reformist in the Ostland chaos at some point- Speer had won more than he ever could have expected. A perfect target, a perfect ball and chain to tie to the reactionaries. Even if it would benefit the Gang as much as it benefited him, Speer was more than willing to make that sacrifice. Soon, Ostland would be under German control again, and the face of the traitors- along with their military ranks- would be plastered across every newspaper in Germany."
 speerostland.18.a:0 "Perfect."

 speerostland.19.t:0 "Vituska in Ostland"
 speerostland.19.d:0 ""So, who is this Michal Vituska?" Speer read the report with interest, looking between it and Schmidt slowly, his eyes glancing over the little information that the paper provided.\n\n"We aren't entirely sure, Albert." Schmidt said with a sigh. "His past is... well, murky would be an understatement. What we know about him is that he's been a loyal collaborator with a lot of luck- at least, up until the Bürgerkrieg, where he broke away from the Reichskommissariat to form a Central European Council, as he calls it. He's the dominant power in Ostland today."\n\n"And you said he was willing to negotiate?" Albert's eyes pored over the papers. Vituska's history was interesting, to say the least. A number of strange events and coincidences had brought him to the position of power he had held before Ostland broke down- definitely something that raised his eyebrow. Perhaps the man was more clever than he seemed.\n\n"Yes, he's said he's willing to cooperate. Shall I send an invitation?" Schmidt said. Speer nodded, and the Foreign Secretary made his exit. The Führer put down his paper- there were certainly worse possible outcomes."
 speerostland.19.a:0 "We'll see what he wants."

 speerostland.20.t:0 "Meeting the Man"
 speerostland.20.d:0 "Michel Vituska entered Speer's office with a hearty "Heil!" and a quick salute, taking his seat with haste. Speer cocked his head- whether the man was nervous or enthusiastic, he couldn't tell. He took a breath before beginning. "Herr Vituska, thank you for accepting these negotiations. I trust you know why we're here?"\n\n"Yes, of course." Vituska quickly said, fidgeting in his chair a little. Speer's eyebrow raised a little- for a skilled leader, Vituska definitely seemed a little worried. Maybe it was the stakes. He disregarded it.\n\n"Now, I understand you had a few requests in exchange for rejoining the Reich, yes?" Speer said calmly. Vituska fidgeted a little more in his seat before he began.\n\n"Yes, my Führer. I would request to retain my role as Reichskommissar of Ostland, in exchange for my continued collaboration. In addition to this, I would similarly ask for the restrictions that Germany currently holds over Ostland to be relaxed, if not removed. With these two caveats, I'd be more than happy to peacefully rejoin the Reich."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows furrowed, his face betraying confusion, anger, and bemusement all at the same time. "You've come all this way to ask me to give you almost unimpeded control over one of the Reich's most valuable territories?"\n\n"Well, I wouldn't put it like that," Vituska said. Speer scoffed. What a waste of time."
 speerostland.20.a:0 "Onto Plan B."

 speerostland.21.t:0 "Harder Than We Thought"
 speerostland.21.d:0 ""Herr Vituska, you must be joking. Even if I wanted to- and I don't- can you imagine the damage of giving a Slav control of a Reichskommissariat? I'd be laughed out of the Reichstag. It can't be done." Speer's tone had taken on an almost incredulous tilt. He half expected Vituska to laugh and explain that it was all a joke. He didn't.\n\n"Herr Speer, these are my conditions. If you do not accept them, these talks must adjourn. "Vituska said. His earlier nervousness was gone, replaced with a steely look. As foolish as Speer considered the man, he had to admit that he had a lot of nerve. It would not save him.\n\n"Well, Herr Vituska, if these talks are adjourned, I have no choice but to mark you a traitor, which means... " Three guards entered the room, their weapons at the ready. Speer watched Vituska closely for his reaction. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion when the man smiled.\n\n"You didn't think he'd actually come to this meeting in person, did you?"\n\nSpeer froze for a moment, before reaching for the photograph of Vituska he had on his desk and holding it up to the man's face. At a glance, they seemed to match, but further inspection proved it- this was not the same person. He threw the photo down and sighed.\n\n"Son of a bitch.""

 speerostland.22.d:0 "During the Bürgerkrieg, chaos consumed much of Europe. Perhaps the most chaotic of these battlegrounds was not found in Frankfurt, or Saxony, but rather in Ostland. Ostland, once designed as "The Model Colony", proved that moniker to be a falsehood, as it fell to pieces within days of the Reich's own failure. Six sides burst from the unsteady Reichskommissariat, each fighting over the future of the area.\n\nStunningly, the United Partisan Organization, led by noted terrorist and murderer Abba Kovner, has come out on top of Ostland. This is an unmitigated disaster for us- not only because of Kovner's well-known Anti-German sentiment, but because of the political implications this holds. Already, conservatives in the Reichstag have made hay with this issue, attempting to tie our reformist views to this outcome. While this is unquestionably false, it's caught on in some circles, and our influence is bound to take a hit. Best to make short work of this and move on as fast as we can."

 speerostland.23.t:0 "The Ostland Intervention"
 speerostland.23.d:0 "Speer's face paled as he read through the report. He was alone- there was no need for Schmidt, nor for anyone else in the Gang. No, this was an open-and-shut decision. An invasion was the only option for such a madman as Abba Kovner.\n\nThe reports chilled his blood to even look at. Stories of German soldiers being executed, German civilians being shot regularly, soldiers hanging from trees and lampposts- it was enough to make anyone retch. Such depraved brutality could not and would not be tolerated by the Reich.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the fastest the Reich's bureaucracy had moved since the Second World War. Within hours, divisions pushed across the Ostland border, engaging partisan forces wherever they found them. Each of them had two goals, and two goals only- push through Ostland as fast as possible, and save as many settlers as they could."

 speerostland.24.d:0 "Few names provoke such strong reactions in Germany as the name Schutzstaffel. Most react with hate, some with fear, some others with disgust. No matter who you ask, however, you're almost guaranteed to hear a tale of their brutality. One of the most widely reviled organizations in German history, the hope was that, with their defeat in the Bürgerkrieg, they would be permanently banished to Burgundy to rot.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case.\n\nElements of the Ostland SS, led by Friedrich Jeckeln, have managed to seize control over Ostland, and are ruling with a fist of iron. Their maniacal ideology must be put down with extreme prejudice, effective immediately. On the political front, this development has aided the reformist wing of the party immeasurably, seeing as they've made numerous successful comparisons between the conservative wing of the Party and the SS. In any case, the intervention must happen, and it must happen soon, or there may be no Ostland to return to."

Their factions are still locked in combat with each other- six of them at start. That number has since been reduced."\n\nSpeer nodded. "Is there anyone within that mess we can work with?"\n\nSchmidt sighed. "There was, my Führer, but his faction has been crushed. Andreas Meyer-Landrut, the industrialist. He gave it his best shot, but... well, he didn't succeed."\n\nSpeer grunted. "And there's nobody else there we could work with?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well." Speer looked out his window. "That's a pain, isn't it? Get the troops ready. We'll intervene, restore order, and go from there."\n\n"Yes, my Führer." And in a moment, Schmidt was gone."

"Andreas Meyer-Landrut, a major industrialist in the region, has led a faction of reformists through the struggle. He's held his own quite well. Currently, he is the only faction I believe we could truly negotiate with."\n\nSpeer smiled. "Perfect. Organize an intervention. We'll move in, secure the region, and then take over for the man. It'll run like clockwork."\n\n"Of course, my Führer." Schmidt said, with a smile on his face. It seemed both men were quite pleased with this result."

Without you, this whole operation would be much more of a pain than it currently is. I can't thank you enough."\n\n"Of course, my Führer. It was no trouble, really. I trust that this new administration will continue our efforts?"\n\n"Well, Herr Landrut, I need you to sign this first. Make it official and all." The two men stopped by a table with a paper on hand. Landrut took a pen and, still smiling, signed it. Speer smiled.\n\n"We can't thank you enough for your cooperation, Herr Landrut. Rest assured that Ostland will reform just as much as anywhere else in the Reich.""

 ###Moskowien EVENTS###
 
 speer_moskowien.3.t:0 "God Help Me, I Was Only 19" #Start of German Soldier Event Chain
 speer_moskowien.3.d:0 "Matthäus Schornberger leaned his chair back on two legs and lit his cigarette. The smoke wafted lazily into the air before being suddenly sucked out of the room, dragged by the wind that blew through the opened window. He puffed thoughtlessly as he stared out the window, taking in his street on the west end of Fulda. His father would kill him if he found out he was smoking, which is why he had to do it up in his room on the third floor of their house, one level above the kitchen and two levels above his father's workshop, filled with the tools of a watchmaker. Of course, his father was much more than just a watchmaker- he was a hero, an Iron Cross recipient, first class. Though his father never flaunted it, he knew the neighbors knew it. You could see it in their enthusiastic greetings, their preference of his business over others, the favors and gifts they gave him. His father was a man that all, including Matthias, respected; a man who had stood up to the Judeo-Bolsheviks out east and obliterated them. He was a man to look up to.\n\nWhat did Matthäus have to look forward to in his life, anyhow? He had turned the question over and over in his mind for months now, and he still had no answer. Sure, he studied, as his father wished, but what was the point? The slaves did all the work that Germany needed already. Did he really want to waste what should be the greatest years of his life on a degree he would have no purpose for, just for a society that had no need for it?"
 speer_moskowien.3.a:0 "What's the use of it?"
 
 speer_moskowien.77.t:0 "Making Up His Mind"
 speer_moskowien.77.d:0 "The army, on the other hand, was where Matthäus saw his legacy being made. There, he could serve a purpose to his fatherland. He could come home and have the same respect his father had. He could be someone, do something, and come home a stronger, wiser man, just as his father had. Besides, he still remembered the war stories his father had told him back when he was a boy. They spoke of joy and camaraderie, of glorious victories over the Jews and Slavs, of a great triumph and the stories that accompanied it. That sounded much better to Matthäus than sitting around in an office twiddling his thumbs for the rest of his life.\n\nThe only thing that had been stopping him from rushing off to the recruitment office so far was, strangely enough, his father. Matthäus had floated the idea past him once and quickly learned not to make that mistake again. He'd never seen his father so angry. He'd made him promise he'd never go to the Heer, under any circumstances. Of course, Matthäus had promised- what else was he going to do?- but now he wondered why. He sat for a moment, the wind blowing through his room, deep in thought.\n\nSuddenly, he snuffed his cigarette out against the windowsill. He knew why his father was so angry about the mere thought of his son in the Heer- he didn't think he could do it. His father thinks he was too soft, did he? He thought he couldn't handle war, did he? He thought Matthäus couldn't handle responsibility or pressure, or having people depending on him. Matthäus knew it to be true- his father didn't seem to have much of a problem with telling his war stories, did he? Was he scared that his son could possibly upstage him, do more than even he could? Well, he was going to see it now. Matthäus was going to go into the army, and he was going to make his father wonder why he'd ever doubted him. He was going to make him sorry he'd ever even tried to stop him. He was going to be a soldier, and nothing was going to get in his way.\n\nFuriously, Matthäus scribbled out a farewell note and slapped it down on the kitchen table on his way to the door. While grabbing his coat, he turned around to savor the view of the house one more time. He was going to come back, and he was going to be more than his father could ever have dreamed of being.\n\nHe was going to be a hero."
 speer_moskowien.77.a:0 "Like Father, like son."


 speer_moskowien.4.t:0 "Crisp Uniform"
 speer_moskowien.4.d:0 "The wind swept Matthäus's hair to the side as he stood in front of the recruiting office. The cold, concrete building almost seemed to stare right back at him, looking straight through him. In front of the building stood two Heer members, dressed in full parade attire. SIlently, he made his way past them and into the building.\n\n"Heil Speer!" The recruiting officer, sitting neatly at his desk, snapped to his salute, an action Matthäus returned. "What can I do for you, sir?"\n\n"I'm looking to join the Heer, sir." Matthäus replied, confidently. He made sure to keep his chest out and chin up.\n\n"Good, good. Just sign these papers and go into that room back there. You'll find a uniform, a helmet, and we'll direct you onto a bus out of here shortly."\n\nMatthäus sat down in front of the table, the pen clicking in his hands. Multiple papers were set in front of him, each detailing oaths and promises. "I will be loyal to the Führer and to Germany." "I will not falter in my duty to the Reich." "I will uphold and support my fellow soldier, and follow orders without question." Yes, yes, and yes. He soon began to stop reading the papers, simply signing where they asked him to. Finally, he moved on to the back room, where his uniform awaited him.\n\nCrisp, folded, and clean, the grey uniform sat among rows of other uniforms identical to it. A small part of Matthäus's mind told him that this would be the cleanest he'd ever see it. He grabbed one that fit him, trying on the tunic and pants. The helmet, clean and polished, didn't fit all that well, but Matthäus couldn't find one that fit better, so he took it. When he was ready, he marched proudly out of the room and into the back, taking a seat besides other, similarly uniformed recruits.\n\nWithin minutes, a bus pulled up to the office, and the men were loaded on. As the bus pulled away, Matthäus took one last look around the city he had called home all his life. A new chapter of his story was just beginning."
 speer_moskowien.4.a:0 "Just sign on the dotted line."
 
 speer_moskowien.5.t:0 "Harsh Reality"
 speer_moskowien.5.d:0 ""Get over the wall, maggot!"\n\nMatthäus's legs swung and scratched helplessly at the bricks, his hands barely grasping onto the edge of the wall he dangles from. Below him, a small queue was beginning to pile up, men watching his every swing as he desperately struggled for any traction. Though he couldn't see him, he could already tell the drill sergeant was getting closer to him.\n\n"There's Russian machine guns behind you, boy! They're getting closer, they're gonna kill your squadmates if you don't get past that fucking wall, boy!" Soft chuckles from the men below him. What made the situation even more humiliating was that none of the men before him had many problems with getting up and over. It was Matthäus, and Matthäus alone, who was struggling so much with it. He tried to pull himself up and over again, to no avail.\n\n"They're on top of us now, boy! They're shredding us, boy, there's guts all over your legs, boy, get over that wall!" Matthäus was about ready to just let go and quit. He wasn't made out for this, clearly. His father had been right.\n\nThe thought stopped him in his tracks. His father, if he returned home, would be insufferable. He would be right that Matthäus wasn't strong enough for this. Matthäus could picture his dad cracking open a beer in his shop, saying to some curious customer, "I told him over and over to not go, but he did, and you know what happened? I was right, and he's back at home now. I tell you, they aren't made like they used to be, are they?"\n\nWith a final heave, Matthäus pushed over the wall and fell to the ground on the other side. The drill sergeant gave him shit, for sure, but he didn't hear it. He was still going. He was still a soldier."
 speer_moskowien.5.a:0 "It was a long march from cadets..."
 
 speer_moskowien.7.t:0 "The Fighting 16th"
 speer_moskowien.7.d:0 "The truck shook and rattled as it rolled along the autobahn, staying behind the truck in front of it. Matthäus knew where they were going, and it shook him a little bit. The convoy was headed to Danzig- the furthest Matthäus had ever been from Fulda was Germania, and that had only been once or twice. Fulda, and the area around it, had been all he had known. Shaking a little, he pulled his assignment orders out of his pocket, reading them over for what seemed to be the hundredth time. Everything was in order- He was on a truck to Danzig to join the 16th Infantry Division. He assumed the men around him were on the same journey. The 16th Infantry- not a division that Matthäus had heard of in passing, but name recognition didn't matter much.\n\nThe man next to him tapped him on the shoulder. "Hey." he said cautiously. "You're from Bachrain?"\n\n"Oh, yeah, I've lived there my whole life."\n\n"Me too." The man said. "Schornberger... I feel like I've heard the name. The watchmaker, right?"\n\n"Not me. That's my dad."\n\n"Oh, really? He's good at what he does. A soldier too, I've heard. You following in his footsteps?"\n\n"Not exactly." Matthäus laughed. The two men's conversation continued, and soon other men began to join in. Matthäus learned they were all going to the 16th as well, as he expected. Most were from around Fulda, if not the city itself, though there were some from other areas. One even said he was from Vienna. Soon, the squad became fast friends. It's hard not to like someone when you spend 3 hours of a boring truck ride talking to them. As Matthäus spoke, he knew that he'd truly found his calling. If only his father could see him now!"
 speer_moskowien.7.a:0 "Good men, all of them."
 
 speer_moskowien.6.t:0 "New Orders"
 speer_moskowien.6.d:0 "It was a normal day in Danzig, as the last six months had been. Matthäus lay in his bunk, daydreaming of going home. This wasn't the hero's life he had been promised. Indeed, the most action he had seen was an out of control truck crashing into the wall of the base a few months back. The rest of his time had been spent idly patrolling various parts of Danzig, from the docks to the barracks to the Governor's Palace. In general, it seemed like Matthäus would never become the same hero his father had been- not for lack of trying, but simply out of lack of opportunity.\n\nHis friend, a fellow named Johan, opened the door to the barrack and walked inside. "Guys, pack your shit. We're leaving in two hours, going out east." He yelled, to the complaint of those who were catching up to the sleep they had lost in the last few days. The barracks sleepily came alive, as man after man rolled out of their beds to put on their uniform. Matthäus did not move, instead thinking for a moment, before catching Johan's attention.\n\n"Johan, where are we going? What are we doing out east?"\n\n"We're being deployed. Apparently we're restoring order to the east, or some shit. I'm not clear on the details myself, but I know we're being deployed."\n\nMatthäus rushed from his bed, eager to get his pack ready. Finally, some action! He had been hoping for this day ever since he had joined the Heer. All the training, all the waiting, all the busywork- all had been leading up to these moments, where Matthäus could finally prove that, yes, he was able to do all the same work and more that his father did so many years ago. Within a few minutes, his personal items rested snugly in his pack. Matthäus, now dressed in his field greys, took one look at himself in the mirror on the wall before he marched outside to the trucks.\n\nHe looked quite nice. He looked natural. Above all else, he looked ready."

 speer_moskowien.8.t:0 "The Battle of Smolensk"
 speer_moskowien.8.d:0 "Matthäus's G1 rocked violently in his hands as he emptied the magazine down the street. All around him, his squadmates did their best to keep the fire going, ducking occasionally to avoid return fire. Matthäus ducked down again to reload, not even noticing the bullets that cracked the wall behind him. For now, his mind was solely focused on not dying, and serving his homeland. Even with his focus, and his attempts to keep composure, he could feel the manic feeling of terror slowly rising within him, as it had for almost an hour now. How long had they been fighting in this street for? How much ammo could they possibly have left, and what would happen if they ran out?\n\nFor now, however, those thoughts were quickly pushed away by a sharp tap from his NCO.\n\n"Schornberger! I need you to do some shit for us!" the man shouted, but whatever he shouted was drowned out by the next man over's yelling.\n\n"Holy shit! Johan just ate a fucking grenade up there!"\n\nMatthäus looked over the trench to the next foxhole, where his friend was noticeably absent. As he looked, however, he noticed movement in a ruined house, off to the left. None of his squadmates were in there- could a flanking attack be coming? A quick slap from the NCO brought him back to attention.\n\n"Like I was saying, Private, I need you to find a command element, tell them to give us reinforcements, supplies, something! We're running low! You hear me, private?""

 speer_moskowien.9.t:0 "The Red Badge of Courage."
 speer_moskowien.9.d:0 "Matthäus, without really even thinking about it, hopped over the wall and began his dash down the street. He didn't hear his NCO's shouting, whether it was positive or negative. All he heard was the thump of his own heart and the crackling of a machine gun, and suddenly the ground around him exploded in shards of stone and shrapnel as bullets crackled off the road around him. He didn't care, as long as they didn't hit him. By some divine miracle, or insane luck, they didn't. Matthäus managed to slide into the foxhole unscathed, slamming into the other wall from the sheer momentum he had carried. Quickly brushing himself off, he turned to find his friend.\n\nJohan was lying in a puddle of his own blood- a puddle that was now lapping around Matthäus's boots- with the look on his face of a rapidly dying man. His uniform, sliced to rags by the shrapnel, was now damp with blood from a thousand wounds. His arm, still holding his rifle, now lay severed behind him. As Matthäus watched in horror, Johan took one last look at him, eyes wide open, before finally falling silent.\n\nMatthäus was too terrified now to even throw up. His feeling of panic, which had been so well surpressed, now exploded just as ferociously as the grenade. In a blind moment of sheer terror, Matthäus scrabbled for the edge of the foxhole, looking for any means of escape, to run away, back past his line, out of Smolensk, all the way back to his house in Fulda.\n\nThe machine gun bullets cracked against the foxhole again, and Matthäus caught a stinging reminder of why the foxhole was there when one bullet grazed his fingers, sending him tumbling back into the blood puddle. Without covering fire, there was no way he could escape alive. Matthäus sank down against a wall, his eyes drawn to the corpse of what was once his friend. He couldn't look away. All he could do was sit and stare.\n\nThis wasn't at all like his father's stories."

 speer_moskowien.10.d:0 "With a jump, Matthäus was off, racing through the streets of Smolensk. Bullets cracked against the walls behind him, sending him stumbling into the next street. From there, he turned, running with his head down as he raced past corpses upon corpses. The screaming of the dying and the wounded rattled through his head as he ran, still looking for any sort of command element.\n\nFive blocks down, he stumbled into a makeshift hospital, hastily thrown together in the chaos of the fighting. He pushed through doctors tending to their patients, nurses carrying bodies off of beds and into a pile further away, and the occasionally walking wounded waiting for a table to open up. Finally, he broke free of the chaos, continuing his search.\n\nThe horrors of the battle he had fought through became more and more clear as he seemingly revisited them all on his path. On the way forward, it had been easy to ignore them, what with the battle and bullets flying everywhere. Now, on the way back, there was no haze to cover up the bodies, the blood, and the wreckage.\n\nEventually, Matthäus did find the command center. He barely even noticed himself monotonely requesting extra supplies for his position. When the commander heeded his request, sending men to relieve his unit, Matthäus hardly noticed. He instead sat down in a corner and tried to comprehend what he had seen."

 speer_moskowien.11.d:0 "Matthäus gingerly entered the building, rifle ready in his hands. He noticed a slight shake to his aim- perhaps from adrenaline, perhaps from fear. The sounds of the battle roaring outside were now only muffled cracks and bangs reverberating through the walls. The house itself was dark- the electricity had been cut long ago- and the only light that filtered in came through cracks in the ceiling and walls. Matthäus's eyes strained to see clearly in the darkness as he slowly moved forwards.\n\nA whimper in the next room caught his attention, and Matthäus stopped dead in his tracks. He could hear faint breathing, labored and wheezing as it was. A small shuffle confirmed that the source of the noise was off to the right. Slowly, Matthäus steeled himself and popped around the corner.\n\nA beam of light illuminated a young Russian, no older than Matthäus himself, slick with blood. A picture lay in his right hand, an old rifle in his left. The two regarded each other for moment, neither moving a muscle, as if they shared a connection among the chaos of war.\n\nMatthäus raised his rifle and pumped six rounds into the boy, silencing his breaths. The picture fell from his hand, and Matthäus was barely able to make out the boy standing with his mother and father.\n\nMatthäus exited the house blankly, returning to the line. The Sergeant asked him if the building was clear, which Matthäus could only reply with a nod. Without another word, Matthäus returned to the line, firing the occasional shot down at the enemy."

The street, the battle, the things he had seen- all kept replaying in his head, like a long, terrible movie. He couldn't stop thinking about the crack of rifle fire, the screams of the wounded and dying, or the yelling of men who knew that, at any moment, they could be dead. After an hour of this torture, Matthäus resolved for another sleepless night. He quietly hopped out of his bunk, trudging to the bathroom. Perhaps he could fix himself there.\n\nOnce he got into the dim light of the bathroom, he took a long look at himself. A tired, unshaven face stared right back into his eyes. One simultaneously young in body but old in mind. Perhaps, with a few touch-ups and a good shave, he could look like the boy he once was, but one look into his own dull eyes was a surefire tell that he wasn't truly the boy from Fulda anymore.\n\nHe took a sip of water out of the sink, washing his face afterwards, before heading back to his bed. There, he lay down quietly, waiting for the sun to come up and a new day to start."

And he ran!"\n\nThe table erupted with laughter as the man finished his story, and Matthäus cracked a smile of his own. These were good people he had met- being new to Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität was quite the overwhelming experience. Matthäus had managed, but it seemed he had finally met some people he could fit in with.\n\n"So that's how high school ended for me. Matthäus, you're the new one here. What did you do before University?"\n\n"I, ah... " Mathaus paused for a moment. How would they react? Should he be honest? Christ, they're all looking at him now. No time to think.\n\n"I served with the Heer out east, in Smolensk."\n\nAnother moment of silence around the table- perhaps a silence for Matthäus's chances of making friends here. "Well, uh, that's interesting." said one.\n\n"Did you kill anyone?" said another, entirely too excited for the question he had asked."\n\n"What war?" said a third.

 speer_moskowien.14.d:0 "Great minds were gathered with Speer. Politicians and military officers pored over great maps of old and new. The Führer listened to what those around him now were discussing. Their ideas mixed together. That formed a great concoction of intellect that made little sense as emotions were injected into it followed by urgency.\n\nBut Speer knew that he had to keep his head above the murky waters of the war room. Here, in Germania, he had to make great efforts to prevail against both the military and the Slavs to the East.\n\nHere, Speer reminded himself, he had to keep eyes and ears everywhere. And right now, he had to take a breath and dive under the surface.\n\nThere he was with the sharks. And they were Speidel, Schörner, and Tresckow.\n\nSpeer estimated that Speidel would want something slow, something careful. Tresckow wanted a balanced approach. And Schörner, for the animal that he was, with war always his aim, wanted something hard... something fast, and that, Speer told himself, was dangerously similar to the old way of war.\n\nNow their squabbling was coming to an end as they turned to Speer, who had looked up at them. Speer cleared his throat and began to speak."

 speer_moskowien.15.d:0 ""I must suggest that we take this carefully," Speidel said. He gestured to the map, explaining his plan, "It would make us seem reasonable, careful. It would allow us to behave better. We would take on the appearance of peacekeepers. We would not show too much force but instead we would show our intentions to give support to our own people in the East."\n\nSchörner shook his head at his words and told him to his face, "You are asking too much of our boys. You don't know what it's going to be like for them to face the Slavs. Those people would shoot our boys even if they behaved nicely and spoke to them politely. Neither they nor we are friendly neighbors now, are we?"\n\nBut Tresckow shot at him with words. "You're right, but this can save civilian lives." Schörner groaned at that and scoffed. Tresckow ignored him, adding to Speidel's points, "It can keep us from playing too much of a part in bringing the blood of innocent people on our troops. And it would show to the world that we are being intelligent about it."\n\n"What's intelligent is getting our men into the fire and out of there quickly rather than asking them to stay in the fire and do nothing," Schörner said, his face clearly showing that he wasn't having it from either of them.\n\n"It isn't going to be like that," Speidel told him, "because this will show the natives that we are not here to kill them all. They might even cooperate with us."\n\n"Hah! Good luck with that. No Slav would embrace us."\n\n"They won't, but it's worth trying. I'd rather keep civilian casualties low and our troops safe with careful officers rather than go headlong into a war that will spill the blood of everyone involved, either civilian or not," Tresckow added.\n\n"And this is only a plan. It's all up to our Führer to decide what must be done." Speidel and his fellow officers now turned to Speer. The Führer had listened to them."

Slowly.\n\nIt gnawed on the minds of both the enlisted men and their officers. The fear of being shot at by patient snipers or angry villagers settled on their shoulders the more they marched and halted and marched out again. But when no shot rang out, when no man shouted for cover or a medic, it seemed to them that the plan was working.\n\nStill, the Germans were cautious. And when they encountered civilians, reluctant men would remove themselves from the company of their comrades and their vehicles, carrying some rations or some kind of supplies to them. Most of the time, the meetings were brief, awkward, and all too nerve wracking on everyone. But at least those ended well. The rest of the encounters were either quite wholesome or quite bothersome.\n\nThe more they moved into the heart of the native territories, the more resistance and reluctance they found. Civilians either refused to welcome them, take their supplies, or reconsider shooting them. Snipers took advantage of kind German soldiers. And officers found themselves commanding squads of men yelling for permission to shoot back.\n\nAnd understandably, the officers were not enjoying this kind of control over what they had to do on the field. To have to put up with irritating villagers as well as hostile enemy elements was adding to their dissatisfaction."

What is going on?"\n\nSpeidel, who seemed as shocked by such insubordination, said, his hands also shifting papers on his part of the table from place to place, "They're all asking to be court-martialed! They can't just refuse to obey orders like this! This places the entire plan in the mercy of the enemy."\n\nTresckow added, closing the folder containing his copies of what was sent to them from the East, "They should face justice. It's unbecoming of our officers to disobey the instructions of our Fatherland. But I am not sure we should be punishing them in such a great scale. What would they say about us if we put them all down?"\n\nSpeidel turned to him, "Do you suggest relaxing our instructions?"\n\n"No. I do not. But to sentence them all..." Tresckow shook his head and sighed. "Look, I do not think that it is going to make things easier for our men and the other officers following our instructions if we do away with these men. But it could most likely be the only thing we can do."\n\n"It's not surprising. I would agree with them, honestly," Schörner quipped, drawing the irritated glances of the two other officers, "I really think it's better for us all to be lenient. No use in wasting our officers."\n\nThe Führer sighed. He got up, and so did the officers."

When they arrived, they were to await their executions.\n\nFor days, they seemed to protest their fates. Others accepted them quietly. The rest just couldn't believe it. Their own Fatherland was doing this to them, all because they saw the ridiculousness of having to follow orders that kept them from doing their duties.\n\nNevertheless, no matter how much they wanted not to face the sentences put on them, several of them were taken out in Berlin to be hanged in public. And there would be no way to refuse a hanging.\n\nBy groups, they were noosed. By groups, they were given chances to speak their last words. By groups, they were told of their crimes again. And by groups, they were dropped, their faces concealed by black hoods, their bodies suspended by the necks. Much to the cheers of the student movement which opposed them as well as to the grief of their families and fellow officers.\n\nThey were not to be buried as heroes. But instead, they would be buried as mere men who didn't want to obey their Fatherland, even if it meant being careful for the sake of saving its reputation."

And they did so to do what they could not have done when those orders, those restrictions, were all in place.\n\nAnd all over the East, blood was spilled. Not only of the enemy, but also of their families and neighbors. And soon enough, reports streamed out from the East and into the West and out into the world.\n\nBut this was a good price to pay in order to get the war going again. To get it done. It was better than constantly moving then halting then moving again. It was better than waiting for orders all the way from the Fatherland. It was better than nothing, right? Right?"

That was better than any of the other alternatives. It prolonged the war, but it was better than staining the name of the Fatherland with the crimes and the bloodshed of past conflicts. It had to be. It all had to be.\n\nAnd the Führer could count on it. With thanks to Speidel and to Tresckow, even as Schörner never really let that go, he could have faith in a future where Germany would be praised for its restraint and not for its barbarity. He could at least see a light at the end of the dark tunnel which it passed for choosing to intervene out there, out in the bloody East.\n\nBut with refreshing results came depressing implications. From the lieutenant up to the highest ranking officers of Germany's armed forces, especially the Heer, there was going to be hell to pay. And that was kept to their breasts privately, beneath their coats and their helmets, they all held their Führer and his lackeys responsible for holding them back, for making them do nothing when they should have been free to do something."

"Well," he said, "what's your plan then?"\n\nSpeidel and Schörner both looked towards Tresckow; the former with hopeful eyes, the latter with fiery ones. Tresckow ignored them both and told Speer to his face, "We move at a moderate pace. We do not slow down if we don't have to and we do not force our men to move faster if the situation does not call for it. We are supposed to enter the Eastern territories with a flexible attitude and outlook."\n\nIt made sense. Speer saw that this compromise from Tresckow could save more lives than either Schörner's or Speidel's proposals. But he knew that Tresckow's was an option that would still lead to a significant number of losses. But this should serve as the one that would bleed Germany and the East less.\n\n"I see.

They cradled their weapons and set their eyes forward or around the convoy, suspicious of the quiet Russian trees and shrubs that lined their path. They were deep in the forests now, but they heard little from the birds and the other kinds of animals that were living in them. What was going on?\n\n"Halt!" Many of the men who heard the order turned their heads. Right before their convoy, a burning carcass of a tank. The route was blocked. Then came sharp passing sounds from the left and right. Some men fell from their transports. Others dove behind large rocks or piles of dirt. A loud but brief explosion came from the back of the convoy. Then another.\n\n"Ambush! Ambush! Everyone dismount!" Officers and their noncoms hurried to get their men in order. Drivers stayed in their vehicles or abandoned them, forgetting their weapons or bringing them out. Riflemen and machine-gunners attempted to bring their sights against the enemy that was hitting them from everywhere. But they saw no Russian, only flashes of guns.\n\nScreams and shouts. Smoke from the burning vehicles. More explosions. Commands from noncoms pushing their men at the enemy. Officers on the radios.\n\nThe Germans got their minds back. They fought the Russians back. And they pushed them away from the convoy. But when they returned, they counted their losses. A dozen of their tanks and another dozen of their vehicles were lost. So many men lay on the ground or on their vehicles. This convoy had survived, but with these results, it could not go further into the East."

It was almost peaceful, he thought, if only he had not gotten his country into a war out in the East. Again.\n\nHe looked down at the officers and their staffs making their way quickly into the building. The Führer slipped back to his seat and waited for them to come in.\n\nWhen they did, the Führer almost regretted it, because he heard Schörner blowing steam at the two others who followed after him.\n\n"I told you that your pretty compromise would not work! Look at what you've gotten the men into! An ambush!"\n\nTresckow, almost red faced, his expression set in Prussian stone, brought himself to his seat without speaking to him yet. Once there, he said, "This is not mine alone to bear. It was not my only responsibility to take care of the intervention. You both are officers of our country, are you not? Why didn't you get your hand into it yourself, Schörner?"\n\nSpeidel sat by Tresckow but too was not in a good mood about it. "Does it matter now, Tresckow? Look at the situation - we have hundreds of men dead. And we have lost valuable vehicles. Why were we not trying to be careful?"\n\n"If we moved too carefully, then we would have lost more men because we would be too slow!"\n\n"Gentlemen, enough." Speer stood up, getting the three to rise up from their seats too. "I know all of you are not in good spirits because of what happened, but if we let this stay over our heads, then there is no solving it." He now sat down, letting the others do so too. He looked at them all then said, "For now, listen. I know that you all have given the appropriate instructions for your people to take care of the survivors. I know that this probably deserves retaliation. But we also know that we have families now without their loved ones."\n\nThe officers nodded. They understood. And Speer now gave his order..."

They waved farewell to the family that welcomed them, seeing their faces, some of them still with red eyes and tears going down their cheeks, handkerchiefs wiping them away, for the last time. For now.\n\nSpeer sighed as he looked away, Tresckow glanced at the Führer, seeing him with a frown so deep that he almost felt like comforting the man. But he was the Führer, and as an officer under him, he thought it disrespectful to try to do too much for him.\n\nThe Führer himself felt his own heart come under another weight. He had visited so many families all over Germania. Later, he would have to see to the other families in the rest of the Reich. He wondered how many times he could say those words. "I'm so sorry for your loss..."\n"I regret telling you that your son has fallen in..."\n"My deepest condolences go to you and your family."\n"My sympathies are with you..."\n\nSpeer shook his head at himself, ignoring Tresckow's curious glance. The car had stopped. Tresckow reminded him as the Führer stepped out, "This is the Kraus family. The soldier...he had-"\n\n"A pregnant wife and two daughters. I know." He turned to one of his escorts, who had left the car before he did, "Do we have the..." The escort nodded, looking up at the windows of the house. The Führer followed as did Tresckow.\n\nFrom there, the silent eyes of the woman observed them. She seemed to tremble as she looked down at them.\n\nSpeer held his eyes up then sighed, reached for his hat, and took it off his head. Then he lowered his gaze and walked to the door and knocked gently. He waited for the woman to come down and open the door. When he saw her face, Speer thought he had seen the face of his own wife, in the same manner this woman showed her inevitable grief."

With Speidel and Schörner watching it with him as the planes finally came over the city and released their bombs, flying away in another direction after great balls of fire and heat burst out of the places in the city where the bombs landed.\n\nAnother flight of planes came over, taking turns in dropping bombs that split into smaller ones. The smaller ones scattered more easily over the city, obliterating those that were not on fire or else driving more of the flames into the rest of the area.\n\n"This is insane," Tresckow spoke, drawing Speer's eyes from the monitor. The Prussian was shaking his head, his eyes filled with dread and regret.\n\n"We have to do this," The Führer said with resignation. His eyes returned to the monitor, ignoring Tresckow's following words.\n\n"As if we do not have any other choice! This isn't how we are supposed to respond to the enemy's forces! We're just killing civilians!"\n\n"What does it matter? Civilians are helping the enemy fight us off and kill our men. They deserve it, Tresckow," Schörner stated. Speidel said nothing, merely shaking his head.\n\n"It's still unnecessary! And it stains our honor as soldiers of Germany! This isn't the kind of war we should fight."\n\n"It is now," The Führer said, "because this is the best way we can show force against the Slavs for what they've done."\n\nSchörner smiled. But Tresckow refused to let it go.\n\n"I will not stand for this. This is just not the right way of war. I will not have it, my Führer. You must not let this happen! You should have not listened to him!"'\n\nThough he glared at Schörner, the Führer said nothing. Speidel turned to him and told him, "What is done is done.

"No matter how careful we are, this whole thing is coming to a halt."\n\n"If you only just listened to me and kept going, we would have won this whole thing," Schörner boasted.\n\nTresckow glared at him and said, "We could lose more men if we force them to go into the jaws of the Russian resistance. Do you want them to go in there like blind men?"\n\n"Well, our soldiers are not blind, are they?" Schörner shot back.\n\n"Enough," Speer told them, his eyes remaining on the map, studying the lines and the units arranged for them all to see.

"Schörner, I know I am interested in a swift end to the bloodshed, but if we do that..."\n\n"If we do that, we save more lives - German lives! We should not care too much about the casualties of those causing trouble for our Fatherland in the East. Away with them, the pests!"\n\nTresckow turned to Speer as Speidel too scowled at the man. But Speer kept his attention only towards Schörner, hating him for what he suggested. He had a point, but what about our reputation? "What you suggest is as terrible as committing the same methods our men once used in the West Russian War and before! Are you not aware what you are risking with, Generalfeldmarschall?"\n\nThe determined army officer just shrugged at the Führer and gestured towards the maps, especially to the units displayed. "I only suggest what works. It is better than delaying our men, delaying their support, and above all, delaying Germany's hand in saving our settlers. Is that not our purpose?"\n\nThe other two now turned to Speer, who still maintained a disgusted expression against Schörner.

And as they did, the people attempted to flee. They ran to the boats and when those were destroyed, they swam into the lake. Others ran out of the town, chased down by troops and vehicles, crushed by treads or by wheels, shot in the back if they were too slow or slipped into the ground.\n\nThe wounded who dared to crawl away or limp behind some rubble were bayoneted or finished off with pistols.

Evidence was laid down in front of you again and again but you did not respond. You ignored what they said. You set aside all the warnings!"\n\n"Would you rather I let that town come under Russian control? You don't know what's on the ground!" Schörner now pointed at Speidel, rudely so. "Why don't you try to see what happens when we don't make sure of what is there in the town or not?"\n\n"So you admit you destroyed it?" Speer asked sharply, a revolted smile on his face. "Well? You've done it. You've killed men, women, and children that had nothing to do with our enemy!"\n\n"I did what I had to do. I don't care what you all say! This is necessary.

It was surprising to see our most educated citizens turn against us the most than the rest of the world had done before."

 speer_moskowien.35.d:0 "The poorly built train provided no comfort for the Oberleutenant, as while the train whipping back and forth was usually no issue for supply shipments, personnel had been a different story. Not to mention the freezing temperatures that had plagued every one of the advisors as they prepared to reach Reichskommissariat Moskowien. But, as the Oberleutenant knew, comfort wasn't the priority of the Reich, was it? The train coming to a screeching halt painted a picture of his platoon's desperate stand at Bremen while he fought for Speer's succession. Exiting the train, he took one last look at his pocketwatch containing a picture of his wife before stepping off.\n\nThe rumbling of the train made it hard to hear anything else, but for the Oberleutenant, the marching of boots managed to triumph the surrounding area, as more and more soldiers within Moskau prepared themselves through the bustling streets, as if the whole city was on the move. "Oberleutenant Vogt?" called a distant voice, grasping the Oberleutenant's attention as he came to see a young Leutenant saluting him. "At ease, Leutenant. You're here to bring me to my station, correct?" Vogt said. "Aye, sir, please, follow me, sir." prompting the young officer to face about and begin walking alongside Vogt. Everywhere Vogt looked, he only realized that the chaotic mess was growing, as dirtied Aryan settlers hurried to earn a few extra Reichsmarks whilst platoons of the Reichskommissariat's soldiers marched past. "Poor bastards never had it this hard, did they?" Vogt asked. "Not exactly, sir, preparations for a possible assault by the Russians has shaken up the lives of everyone in the settlement, though everyone is hopeful for the advisors that have come in." The prevalence of such "hope" did not appear evident for Vogt as he saw scared German children and fathers having to say one last goodbye before hurrying off with a rifle in tow.\n\nEventually, Vogt managed to escape the chaos-ridden frost as he entered his small office room within one of the military installations of Moskowien. To say that the ones present during the civil war in Germany were better was an overstatement, with staff tripping over themselves, rats scurrying down the hallways, and barely enough room to stand in. "Sir, command has issued that advisors are to aid in the training of divisions newly formed in the wake of the possible attack from the natives. Heil Speer." the Leutenant said, offering a salute in the air."

Breathe out. Fire. Reload, rinse, and repeat. Fix bayonets if the enemy got any closer. Had it not been that easy to operate the weapons left from the Second World War to prepare the Reichskommissariat for such an attack like this? Apparently fucking not, according to Vogt, given how this morning has gone so far. Fighting and killing fellow Germans felt easier than dealing with this catastrophe.\n\nIt was four in the morning when the battalion he had been assigned to start off with were finished lining up, with some of the men obviously not knowing what standing at attention meant. Lighting his cigarette, Vogt yelled out, "Men, my name is Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt. As I have seen blood spilt within our homeland through war, so too now do the Russians seek to spill our blood to retain their damned power, looking to unite against our families, our Fatherland! And as proud Germans seeking to do their homeland proud, we cannot allow this. Today begins your training for when you face the frontlines, in the reality of which some of you will die. However, that is not the concern now. Today, you shall become true workers of the Reichskommissariat, true soldiers, and true Germans. Now, first platoon of the first company, mount the firing range."\n\nVogt's inspiring words seemingly died in his eyes as the men lined up for weapon training. Some of these men hadn't touched a rifle in years, while others hadn't done so at all, and only worked the farms while producing large families, as the Reich had given permission to do so. None had known the true brutalities that were to come, as Vogt had seen during the civil war, especially when some of them barely figured out how to slide the bolt open. However, the worst came when the men had finally regularly begun firing at the targets when a shower of blood splattered across the field, some staining Vogt's coat, with screaming following. Men rushed over, and saw one that one of the recruits shot themselves in the hand, nearly blowing it off; however, despite the horrificness of the situation, the man managed to retain as much composure as he could, even firing off a joke or two in the process.\n\nVogt knew the truth of the situation: the man shot himself in order to get out of service, in order to escape the horrors that everyone else was bound to endure. Yet, the Oberleutenant knew the truth of it all, that he couldn't shatter the men's spirits knowing they had cowards in their ranks, and chose to send him away to deal with later. Afterwards, the men along the firing line simply stared at Vogt."

 speer_moskowien.37.d:0 "The Eagle, a bird of prey that overlooked the lands of the Germans for centuries. In times past, it represented the strength of the empires long past within German history, having served as a symbol of perseverance and courage. Now, as Vogt knew all too well, the symbol flew as to represent the Fatherland, along with the battalion of conscripts and volunteers within the newly formed "Adlersgruppe," charged with protecting their friends and families from the Russian onslaught that inevitably stormed its way forward. As the men continued setting up defenses in some backwater village to the south of Moskau, they continuously talked about potentially being called heroes on their return home. The word "hero" brought a whiplash of pessimism for Oberleutenant Vogt, nearly distracting him before the sounds of one of the infantrymen being torn apart by submachine gun fire exploded out.\n\nA period of shock-ridden silence boomed, until screams in Russian came from across the town, and the Germans hurried to their assigned positions, with Vogt's orders starting to become drowned out by the incoming gunfire. Chunks of concrete came flying off of surrounding buildings, some even tearing apart the faces of the new recruits, as they continually battled in the streets, with bullets flying and the blood of both Germans and Russians showering the air in a flurry of fire and gore. Vogt had known the terror of guerrilla warfare for years, and now, as a Russian truck with a light-machine gun in the bed firing down into the Germans, Vogt had the chance to utilize his experience. With cries drowning the air, Vogt shouted at some of the closest men to him, "Find your strength men, now's our time to make the advance! Unteroffizier Breiner, take some men and gather the explosives! Unteroffizier Kranz, gather some men with me and we'll surround the truck, it cannot-" a bullet interrupted Vogt's speech as a rain of gunfire forced him to find better cover. As he regained his defense, the only thing the Oberleutenant saw when he laid his eyes on his men were the same emotions portrayed by his brothers-in-arms during their time fighting for Speer back in Germany. The same emotion that came as the feelings of heroism faded, and the chilling shadow of death crept closer and closer, with every comrade lost to another bullet, whether it's fired from a Russian or a German.\n\nTerror.\n\nWiping his face some more, Oberleutenant Vogt shouted "Fall back, fall back! We'll find another way around!" as the German soldiers began to retreat in the face of the overwhelming firepower from the Russians. They may not be heroes, but they didn't need to be heroes to deserve to live another day, to Vogt, anyway."

The death, the destruction, the disease, and all the other terrors. But Vogt could never have expected the brutalities to rise so quickly: the amount of mass executions, the killings of deserters, those once considered to be comrades in fighting against the Russians, the viscera, all had come crashing down upon the volunteers in such a short period. Much to the respect of Oberleutenant Vogt, while it all seemed difficult, the men continued to march forward past it all; that is, until the Burning of Livny.\n\nAs the Adlergruppe marched southwards from Moskau, pushing deeper into Russian territory in the defense of the Reich's 'rightful territory', the men had already become surrounded as the urban battle exploded. Sure, the men got their first taste of battle in a village, but this was an entirely different story as the concrete buildings and structures hid enemy Russians behind every corner. Constantly, squads of enemy soldiers seemed to appear as phantoms in the dark, pinning a few squads of the Germans down before they finally dealt with the issue. This was, until Alpha Company, led by Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt, entered the courtyard of an apartment complex to secure the area, and became pinned down by heavy enemy fire from all sides of the three-sided building. The men rushed to cover or died trying to do so, with the screams of fellow Aryans dying in the stony courtyard filling the air, as what seemed like the endless Russian supply of lead came raining hell upon the company. Vogt was left with no other choice but to hold out as he continuously pleaded for air support from local German air wings, who promised "immediate combat support."\n\nIt took a seemingly endless five minutes for the screams of the German jets to overtake the slaughter, as the Gates of Hell seemed to open up from the heavens above and consume the apartment complex. The men watched along in horror, some trying to get up and move as the fiery napalm they pleaded for arrived, sticking to the enemy soldiers who threw themselves off the multiple story balconies to escape the horrid fate of burning to death. However, as Vogt thought the horror was over, it only multiplied in size, as the outer doors of the apartment complex opened up and a flood of burning men, women, and children came screeching out of the complex. Only some had been armed, but none cared any longer, as they peeled away at the flesh and bone that melted away from the deadly German napalm, with mothers holding their children, hoping for an end to the madness. Eventually, all had either died from the flames or were killed out of mercy by some of those within the Aldersgruppe, who had all seemed to shock and terrified to be able to respond to any other orders from some of the superiors.\n\nThe nightmares that night consumed Vogt's mind. Flashbacks to that last stand at Bremen stormed his mind only to reach a burning conclusion, with the flooding of anachronistic burning children and women into the once-heroic battlefield, causing the Oberleutenant to rocket from his dreams every hour of the night."

Finally, the glowing numbers of "418" came into view with a screeching halt, and she excitedly danced over, finally seeing her beloved Marzell come into view. She immediately rushed to embrace her Marzell, who jumped at the sight of his rushing wife, causing her confusion, saying, "You're finally back, Marzell! Come here!" she said, embracing her husband. "Yes, I'm, I'm home now." Marzell said, as Marina felt her husband's hand shake.\n\nHours had gone by, and yet, the newly returning husband still remained...odd, according to Marina. Everytime a new question came forward, like, "How did it feel to serve the Fatherland once more?" he simply responded with a quick "It was good." or "Great." She couldn't name the look in his eyes, one of distance, as if his eyes were a camera out of focus, but she simply tried to provide everything she could to be a good wife. That evening, as the couple climbed into bed, Marina's attempts to embrace and comfort her husband resulted in a simple repulse on the side of her husband, followed by his attempts to get some sleep as he tossed and turned in the bed.\n\nLater into the night, Marina woke to the sound of broken glass and an otherwise empty bed, as she threw off the covers and rushed towards the kitchen, where she heard the loud noise. Realizing her husband was nowhere in sight, she grabbed a letter opener they kept on the desk before entering the kitchen...where she found her husband, with glass shards shattered across the table and ground, whiskey, which her husband swore to never drink in his career, spilled across the area, and a bloodied hand carrying a pistol kept from service. Marina dropped the letter opener on the ground as she approached her husband, asking "Marzell, oh god, what's wrong?" Marzell responded with nothing, only beginning to sob into her chest as he dropped the pistol on the ground, and embraced her tightly, shaking all the while."

And within one small compartment, the bustling and rocking of the powerful locomotive hardly shook the work Walther Viktorow had prepared. Viktorow sat excitedly, tapping on his briefcase filled with documents and procedural forms as he stared out into the Western Russian wilderness, completely losing track of the outside world as the train came to a screech, and the city streets filled his view. Finally, after so much wrongdoing against the harrowed Russian, Viktorow knew that the time had come to make a difference in the world, even if the greatest trial awaited him, and he had one thought which dominated his mind:\n\nMoskau awaits.\n\nHowever, as Viktorow exited the train, accompanied by a group of German guardsmen straight from Germania, the full force of the trial would strike as he looked around the train station. Everywhere, men, women, and children, all with bright, beautiful blue eyes, and adorned with flowing golden hair, all looked as if they had come from a German slum. Exhaustion colored their faces while callouses covered their hands, with some appearing frail and hungry, and all adorning ragged clothes that would bring disgust to most German higher ups. But Viktorow did not want the prestige or class of higher up, this is exactly what Viktorow wanted, even if he could not stand the pleading eyes of the settlers here. At the end of the day, they were the Reich's citizens, and as proud as they may be, they were suffering, and Viktorow knew that he, as an ambassador on behalf of the Reich itself, he could not allow this any longer.\n\nAs the snow landed atop his cap, the toy of a young child bounced across the street in front of the capitol, nearly prompting a guard to strike the child, were it not for Viktorow's intervention. Handing the child his toy from next to Viktorow's feet, the diplomat said a few simple words to the boy: "Do not be afraid, things will change here soon." as he looked onwards to the capitol building of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, as the recent clashings of Germans and Russians flooded his mind."

Improvements regarding the stability of the transportation systems between the Reich and the Reichskommissariat could potentially be looked into; however, if anything, the difficulty presented in the transportation systems is a small look into the situation within Moskowien. Politically, the situation within the area appears stable enough to not withdraw supply efforts towards the settlers of the area, nor do any reports indicate a collapse for the Reich's influence within the area around Moskau; however, living standards have fallen dramatically for the Aryan settlers within the Reichskommissariat as well as native Russians. Outbreaks of conflict between native Russian populaces and the settlers arriving from Germany proper has caused considerable detriment for German settlements, and Russians within the area have suffered as well, despite the advancements made within the area. In this regard, although living conditions have plummeted for all parties within Moskowien and the surrounding Russian nation-state, the populace has espoused supreme loyalty towards the Reich itself, and in an effort to support the German and the Russian within the area, the developing situation has been taken with the greatest priority for our diplomatic envoy. Thus, actions towards the advancement of OPERATION: GREATWHITE will begin immediate implementation within the interactions between Reichskommissar Kasche's successor, native leadership within the newly established state for Russians outside of Reichskommissar Moskowien, and the diplomatic envoy you have assigned me to, and transportation to the capital of the nation-state of the Russians will be arranged to aid our mutual efforts through a hopeful admittance into the Einheitspakt.

Everything around him had showcased what he enjoyed, the order, the structure of it all, and now was finally his time to make a difference. Time to make a difference that his predecessors of the past did not, he continued, thinking of the pictures of his family he kept so neatly tucked away back home in Germania. The carvings of the beautiful little box delighted Viktorow, in contrast with the contents, as he saw capturings of the times of a Russian family working its hardest to get through the wall set up by German forces. How great the suffering his grandparents had faced as they crossed over into the new land of Germany, and the dreaded persecutions that the Viktorovs faced being foreign immigrants in a hostile land. But no more, no more crushed dreams nor broken souls from either side, as each and every hardworking German and Russian around Moskowien has earned their right to support from the Fatherland, and earned an end to the troubles which plagued them.\n\nViktorow continued his thoughts as he finally made it outside the capital alongside his fellow statesmen and the Waffen regiment accompanying them deep into the Russian land.

As the entourage continued onwards, the silence slowly transformed from an excited admiration of the Russian land to a dreaded silence, with each rotation of the tires bringing another wave of confusing tensions as the Waffen guards present in Viktorow's truck prepped themselves. It was confusing to Viktorow, to say the least, until the trucks finally passed through the iron gates of the city.\n\nThere, peering through the windows of a heavily armored truck, Viktorow, for the first time in his life, received a glimpse as to what his grandmother and grandfather escaped all those years ago: the glimpses of children roaming the streets without parents in sight, in rags, fighting over a piece of bread which had been stained by the mud of the ground. Across the street, Viktorow caught glimpses of three men beating another fellow Russian on the ground, pummeling him with bats, punches, and kicks as they strip him of his bag and coat and duck off into the alleyway, passing by a duo of nurses carrying a body covered with a tarp out of a health center. The homeless had grown in number as he saw groups of armed men harassing a young woman coming out of her home, seemingly asking for overdue money owed to them, and Viktorow could only pray for her safety as the convoy moved on. Viktorow continued to think and debate with himself as to what had become the fate of the Russian people, what could have done this? Were the politicians in charge of the state that greedy, or was there some sort of crisis causing all of this? Viktorow continued to pray for the hope that things had not been completely this way for his ancestors.\n\nAs the motorcade came to a halt outside of the capitol building, Viktorow continued to dust himself off and grab his briefcase as his eyes locked onto a peculiar sight: a little girl, no older than seven, grabbed at the chain link fence as she continued to stare at the Germans inside. She looked thinly, and had only dirty rags on, yet her brown eyes glimmered in the snow, reminding Viktorow of the daughter he always wanted.

The desperateness and near predatory nature of some of the groups that had formed outside of the Moskowien territory, how could the self-governed area fall apart so quickly, yet the room he sits in remain so lavish?\n\nSuddenly, the wrinkled face of the anti-Soviet himself, Bronisalv Kaminski entered the room, offering a nod and handshake to the diplomat.\n\n"Brigadeführer Kaminski, it is an honor to meet you. My name is Dr. Walther Viktorow-" Viktorow started, before being cut off by Kaminski.\n\n"The diplomat sent by Speer, huh? We've been waiting for your arrival. What's the terms?"\n\nViktorow hadn't pictured such exhaustion from Kaminski, but then again, all of the area has been a surprise, hasn't it? Viktorow took out the first report in the file, and began discussing the Führer's desires out of Kaminski to pay for the incredible amount of support issued to the native state via the ceding of Sankt Petersburg and a swearing of loyalty to the Einheitspakt.\n\nViktorow's seemingly hopeful words brought him to look up, only to meet the image of Kaminski hunched over the desk, both hands clasping his face.\n\n"They'll march in and hang me...joining the Einheitspakt...the natives, they've given..."\n\nAnd finally, as if a sledgehammer broke through a castle made of sand, everything came together for Viktorow. The terms, the ceding of territory, the governmental lavishness, yet the hopeless and the butchers remaining outside, this wasn't Kaminski's misdoings: they've been paying everything towards the Reich. They couldn't stand on their own, they needed help, and now... It suddenly dawned on him: Operation: Great White. Viktorow wasn't serving as a negotiator here, he was a predator: a loan shark.\n\nIn the end, Kaminski, with eyes that seemingly had the life sucked out of them, shook to the agreement of losing Sankt Petersburg and joining the Pakt. With every step, from leaving the capitol building, to walking to the trucks, to staring out the windows as they rumbled out, Walther Viktorow felt one thing alone: the eyes of starving, broken Russians."

Meeting with BRONISALV KAMINSKI retained success within the notions outlined in OPERATION: GREATWHITE, as the native state has agreed to cede Sankt Petersburg to the direct control of the German Reich while issuing a submittance of willingness to joining the Einheitspakt in support of Germany proper in exchange for the cancellation of debts owed from the local government towards Germania. German settlers retained celebratory feelings over the success and technical end to conflicts against their Russian neighbors, as local reports showed demonstrations of praise regarding the Reichskommissariat's government. Outside of Moskau, reports of Russian citizens' outrage over the terms of KAMINSKI'S agreement have been issued to local media outlets, with even some factions within Sankt Petersburg reporting direct obstinance towards the notions of direct annexation by the German Reich proper. Overall tension within the area remains to be seen, as continuous data has been feeding into the Reichskommissariat's office to measure the success of the terms. Within personal reason and experience, it is within bounds of my personal measures to report that OPERATION: GREATWHITE provides immediate successes for the German Reich; however, continuous documentation will be required to measure long-term successes. Insofar as measurements reach, the continuous losses of the native populaces following the Second World War, the Western Russian War, and now the loss of Sankt Petersburg and the diplomatic alignment with the Einheitspakt may offer a fostering point for native resistances.

Peaceful for now, but surrounded by disorder on all sides.\n\n"Come in, come in."\n\n"Foreign minister, a report from Moskowien. I'm sure you'll find it fascinating reading."\n\n"Thank you. You're one of Gehlen's boys, with the RND?"\n\nThe young man opposite him remained silent, and smiled coldly. Schmidt internally rolled his eyes and took the paper from him. "Very well. Off you go then."\n\nWith a short bow, the man left. Schmidt stared at the paper in front of him. 'Kaminski victorious', a newspaper clipping on the front read. Ah, so old Brinislaw had won out against the German settlers. A bad situation for Germany, perhaps, what with the whole legacy of a totalitarian Reichskommissariat and all leaving a sour taste in Russian mouths. Still, Schmidt thought it was perhaps preferable to Von Dem Bach or one of the other wretched Nazis patrolling the ruins of Russia. If not for his government, then for humanity as a whole.\n\nHe filed through the papers, and one stood out particularly. An intercepted telegram, between one of Brinislaw's men and some sympathetic Russian national in Lettland. Now this was interesting. Seems Kaminski had become convinced the best way for his Moscow autonomy out of the chaos enveloping the rest of Russia was a negotiation session with Germania's finest.

Russian troops lined the streets, eying down the foreign minister's convoy as it moved toward the central bar, which had seemingly been refitted into a political centre of operations for Kaminski's forces in this region. Schmidt was confident that he was safe; the Heer around him was equipped with better weapons than these peasant conscripts, that was for sure. Either way, blood spilled today would not be the preferable option.\n\nNegotiations were over lunch. Shashlik, Pelmeni and even Chicken Kiev. Schmidt didn't have Russian cuisine often, but it remained one of his favourites on the continent. Beyond the food, Schmidt was impressed with Kaminski. The man spoke German well, and seemed cultured in literature and philosophy, something that even in the supposed 'world capital' politicians often lacked. The man's taste was clearly in the sciences, however, but Schmidt was capable of holding basic conversation on the scientific feats of Tesla through to Braun. Schmidt liked Kaminski, and it seemed the favour was mutual.\n\nA minor tremor in the conversation was felt. Schmidt let it be known that Sankt Petersburg, or what the Russians still call 'Leningrad', would be directly administered by Germania. The city seemed to hold sentimental value to the old soldier opposite him, who had served his time with the Red Army before Stalin's purges.

That you might be an angel on Speer's shoulder, and you might do something genuinely good for Russia, or even the world."\n\nSchmidt watched as the man opposite him stood from his unfinished lunch. Kaminski faced away, equipping his coat as he continued. "No man is immune to propaganda. I read an American minister talk about it, and you know Schmidt, I hate the Americans, but this one had a point. 'Propaganda makes puppets of us'. It has made a puppet out of you. My blood might come from Warsaw, Minsk, and the very soil this building stands on, but do you think just because I am a Slav that I am stupid?"\n\n"Take yourself and those uptight pricks in uniform behind you back to whatever fucking hell you came from." Kaminski's glare penetrated Schmidt, and the Russians left the room. Schmidt slammed the table once the door had shut. War had come again."

Send my best wishes back to the RND with you."\n\nThe young man saluted, and exited the room. Speer was left with a folder of documents pertaining to the breakdown of the recent partition in Moskowien. Ah. Erich von dem Bach has claimed victory, or so the clipping at the front of the folder would have the Führer believe. Perhaps his Cyrillic was a bit rusty, but flicking through the rest of the documentation suggested that this was the accurate outcome.\n\n"Finally, some good news," Speer muttered to himself. A loyal Wehrmacht general sat in Moscow now, and the Führer could see no reason why resistance was even conceivable. He picked the phone up from his desk."

As good a place as any for diplomatic arrangements. Perhaps more importantly, Erich von dem Bach hadn't seen his hometown for years, and so Schmidt thought it might be beneficial to arrange a meeting there. The bewildered old soldier was guided by the foreign minister into the party office building that had been reserved for the meeting. A table was decorated with a grand lunch for Moskowien's interim ruler. Wurst, potatoes and plenty of beer. "Schmidt, this was unnecessary. Thank you."\n\n"Anything for a fellow German on the homebound flight. Now, down to business?"\n\nAt Bach's nod, Schmidt began. With an apology, the foreign minister revealed that Bach's position would be filled by Alexis von Roenne, to which Bach was seemingly compliant. Additionally, the Reich would directly occupy Sankt Petersburg, and create a new German settler state in the Southern Volga region. To both of these territorial changes, Bach was quite amicable. "Happy to do my duty, sir."\n\nSchmidt smiled to himself. If he knew this was going to be so easy, he would've started drinking much earlier."

Schmidt thought he'd have hated Bach, but the man was honest and kind. They had been alone for some time, and Bach admitted his Kashubian heritage, which no one in the party, he was sure, knew. Sometimes, in Bach's weaker moments, even he doubted the party. Schmidt felt he had met a kindred spirit. The deal was sealed with signatures, and the men departed home.\n\nSchmidt didn't like night time flights, so he was staying in Lauenburg til the morning. He sat up in his hotel bed with the folder the RND had given him. It was a dossier on Bach, and although he had considered the diplomatic sections with great detail, he had only skimmed the personal section. Schmidt's eyebrows furrowed as he glanced over a section tabbed as 'Activities before Moskowien', detailing the man's actions before the war. Schmidt felt his heart race. The man he had joked and drunk with just hours earlier had been responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents, and these were only the documented ones. In Operation Hummingbird, Bach had personally killed several in the SA. Then there was his horrific career in the SS, which Schmidt had heard of but never actively considered.\n\nNo one in this Reich was innocent. Not even the kindest of faces, or the warmest of voices. It was just Schmidt, and Schmidt alone, dancing with the murderers that had destroyed his father's country. He felt his eyes begin to tear up, but suppressed the urge to cry. He had done too much of that recently. At least the deal had gone smoothly. Another nation returned to the Einheitspakt for his favourite murderer, the Führer."

"We will try to get an idea on the situation as quickly as possible. Expect an RND report immediately." As he finished, both his eyes and Speer's turned to Tresckow, who was rubbing the side of his head, sweat dripping from his brow. The enclosed space and the tight military uniform didn't give his old body much pause, as energetic as he was.\n\n"I've already made sure that the Heer will be relocating itself to the border with Moskowien. There won't be much support for the Luftwaffe, though, given the lack of airbases." He looked up at Speer's cold expression. "My Führer, you're certain you want to prompt an invasion?

The host complimented the scientists on their results, expressing his "great appreciation" for the progress made in the fields of electronics and industry, of engineering and military. "With your keen intellect and your selfless dedication to the Reich," he stated in a speech at the end of the banquet, "you not only ensure the Vaterland's greatness and the continuation of the dream of National Socialism, which should already be a satisfying reward for true patriots such as yourselves. With what you have done," and he looked at the entire room, "you gave a new hope to the people, by ensuring they can live better lives with to the help of technology, and you ensured our brave soldiers can truly protect us from any danger, both inside and outside our beautiful nation!"\n\nAs the Führer sat down, a polite applause from the guests showed their appreciation for the compliments, and the ceremony ended with the conferment of the Deutscher Nationalpreis für Kunst und Wissenschaft, the highest decoration for scientific progress, to Adolf Friedrich Butenandt, director of the Society.

At one point, the Führer interrupted the barrage: "Minister, please stop! Are we truly in such a state? Has the Reich really fallen behind so much?"\n\n"Please come with me, mein Führer."\n\nAs the two moved to the window, the Minister pointed at the cars: "Do you recognise them?" and that was enough to answer. To his consternation, Speer saw that most, if not all cars and trucks passing were models ten - if not more - years old. Looking with more attention, he also noticed details he had missed when looking outside in the past weeks: patchwork reparations to the roads and sidewalks, electric cables hanging from scrambled-together power lines, public phones scattered because the people had no telephones inside their homes...\n\nRight at that moment, as if to confirm that indeed, the situation was dire, all lights went out in the office, and the surprised voices from outside the door made it clear that it was a general blackout.\n\nThe Führer fumbled around to his desk, suddenly dejected, and sighed.

At human level, a small screen and a keyboard were encased in the metal: the screen had nothing on it, but soon it would change. In a very similar room in Germania, the central hub of NetzRAM had been activated, and the network spanning the entirety of the Reich was officially active.

The first, critically, is the Antifachistische Aktion. Being one of the most vocal opponents of National Socialism, they were purported as 'exterminated' under the leadership of Führer Adolf Hitler, but unfortunately we have been mistaken. We know little of them yet, so uncovering their degenerative Bolshevik roots is important.\n\nSecondly, is the exponential ramp-up of the student movement in Germany. We have firm reason to believe that, while they are backed by Antifa, they form the backbone of the reformist movement in Germany. With this, a double-pronged problem has been formed.

"Your mission will be as follows:\n\nAt (REDACTED) past midnight, you will infiltrate past the security in the house. You will be given significant amounts of explosives, and you will need to plant them across several weak points throughout the house.

Of course it was necessary. Anything else would not be tolerated, but now the state had to deal with the fall-out that followed. At the very least it wasn't as bad as he may have initially thought, but seeing every day pop up with another article about how some pushy college student affiliated with Antifa was arrested by the men in black.

It was broken, however, when Klaus let out a laugh. "Who told you THAT?! My Opa is a retired electrician, and I've never touched a ballot in my life! Goodness... if you don't believe me, I'll be happy to show you my father's certificate!" That chipped off some of Antifa's initial weariness, and as more students were asked, more of these nonsensical facts were debunked.

The next hour they had spent walking around corner to corner, classroom to classroom, ripping up the occasional poster filled with Bolshevik propaganda about the foolish Antifaschistische aktion. While that would've been all, that day they were also tipped in about something else - by an agent from the RND, no less, about how a group of students would gather in one of these empty classrooms and manufacture their lies and fan the flames of what was going on.\n\nWhen Stefan listened in to a door on a classroom on the second floor, he could hear voices inside. With a smirk, he motioned for his fellow officers to draw their batons as he walked in first, casually opening the door to see six hooligans all gathered around a table, and their attention was turned to him and his gang almost immediately. One of them, a woman, spoke up. "Who are you?" She asked, already becoming worried. Stefan grinned. "Who do you think?" He countered. "We're the police, and we've been informed that you plot an anti-government conspiracy here."\n\nThe mood of the room darkened, and one of the other students spoke up suddenly. "Anti-government conspiracy?! We're just a bunch of students talking! That-", "Silence!" Stefan shouted, expression growing more stern. "I won't tolerate this foolishness. You're all coming with us down to the station where we can determine your loyalty." He slid his free hand against the front of the baton. "Or would you like me to show you what it means to enforce the law?"\n\nA painful silence dominated the space between the two for a few seconds, before one of the students eventually conceded, stepping out and looking frightened. "O-okay." She began. "I-I'll go. Guys?" She asked, looking back to the other who were growing steadily more concerned. "It's n-n-not like we're getting another choice." The woman who initially spoke up stood quietly, glaring daggers at Stefan who only gave a cocky smile back. As her classmates bumped past her, she muttered something under her breath."

The vicious Antifa, commonly known to aid these protests against the brave police force set to keep the peace and calm, came down like vultures on a corpse!\n\nTestimonies from the students say that they could hear these Antifa members shout various obscenities, as well as making claims that they were "in cahoots with the fascists", that "your parents are in Nazi pockets", and that "you don't care about true freedom". Clearly, neither did Antifa, as several students were left with severe bruising, with one even having to be rushed to the hospital! This is a shameful day for all Germans, and we can only hope that the people shall learn about the terrible truths that have plagued this incessant Antifa ever since their origins. For any Germans near and far, let it be known! Even if you attempt to go against the government, in the eyes of the Bolsheviks, you are nothing but a so-called "puppet"!

He moved to talk to her, and she merely waved her hand dismissively as she approached. "I don't want to deal with you anymore, Leon."\n\n"Elsa..." He trailed off, already feeling sweat forming on his head. "Don't do this. We're not affiliated with that chapter-" She gave him a stern glare, and the other two students backed off. "I know you're not. I don't care. I'm not risking the legitimacy of our movement by associating with you. Even if such an incident would never occur between us, what do you think the students here want?" Her eyes softened, and she looked away. "Just go." Hesitation creeped up her throat, but she threw it back down. "Tell your chapter we're no longer allied with each other. A lot of our students have turned against Antifa, and I can't convince them otherwise."\n\nPainful silence came from Leon, and he swallowed, opening his mouth to say something before he stopped whatever he wanted to say.

 speer_rnd.47.d:0 "It had been over a week since the "suicide" of the assassin, Josef Bachmann. A whole week of thinking, pondering, and questioning occurring within the mind of Gerhard Wessel. The customary Schutzstaffel "lightning bolts," Gehlen's quick assumption of the influence of the Ordensstaat, the lack of proper investigation. Wessel, a skilled and experienced investigator, knew that the answers lied within the body, within Bachmann. And yet, everytime he approached the idea, bureaucratic shifts of resources and reorganizations of priorities for the department swept up any attempts.\n\nThe ever-recurring wall of smoke hit Wessel like a wave, only to calm back down and reveal the face of his ever-diligent superior. "Good evening, Herr Gehlen." Wessel greeted. "The same to you, Wessel. Now, a late hour in the night, coming into my office, what's pricked your mind tonight?" Gehlen responded. "Well, Herr Gehlen, I just have some, well, issues in the Nuremberg investigation, but I believe I have a solution. You see, I understand your hypothesis; however, it appears too convenient, or even that we may have overlooked pieces attached to Bachmann that could lead further in any direction. Nevertheless, I believe a formal reinvestigation of Bachmann's body could allow for some, well, advances. Unfortunately, the proposal has been shut down due to other matters of the office becoming, well, randomly prioritized, and I believe we need to focus the investigation." Gehlen said, squashing the cigar against the ashtray on his desk. "Bachmann had clear ties to Burgundian authorities, it's as clear as day upon the man's very clothes. You wish to tell me that it could somehow be something completely different? We have many things to worry about in the RND, reopening a closed case is not one of them, Wessel." Gehlen said, frustratingly, as he lit another cigar.\n\nFury bore into Wessel's body. How could his superior, the man he's respected for so long, suddenly act so obstinately to his pleas? This wasn't right, not at all. Lifting his office phone, Wessel said, "Wedekind...Kessler...to my office, please."\n\nThus, a plan was hatched. A plan for the agents to break into the morgue, to investigate Bachmann's corpse, pictures and all, and bring it all back to Wessel. Wessel could not allow whatever was plaguing the RND to simply scurry away."
 speer_rnd.47.a:0 "And we shan't let it!"

 speer_rnd.48.t:0 "Great Stones Lifted at Last"
 speer_rnd.48.d:0 "Two weeks had gone by, all according to Wessel's plan, before any meeting between the three conspirators of the intelligence department. Late at night, once Gehlen left early to attend his usual reservation at some Germanian restaurant, and all that was left in the office was Wessel, Wedekin, Kessler, and enough illegally obtained information to have the three men locked away for the rest of their lives. With all the lights in the office shut off, and all window shutters brought down against the night sky, the meeting began.\n\n"Wedekind, Kessler. I respect your commitment to the cause we have put together; however, I wish you two to know the legal ramifications of all this. This could easily be what leads us to an early death in a Germanian heavy containment facility. I will be more than happy to allow you to leave and never speak of your involvement again. Do either of you wish to do this?" With the men's eerie silence, and constant stares at Wessel, an understanding agreement was made, and the bag was unzipped to reveal the products of the break-in. Photos, documents, and physical evidence all spilled onto the table.\n\nEach of the photos revealed the harsh, red marks upon the throat, with finger marks all up and down the assassin's throat, with rough scratches and blood trickling down the corpse. Meanwhile, the autopsy report provided even more suspicion regarding the case of death for Josef Bachmann. The primary medical examiner involved in the autopsy of Bachmann had been Dr. Heinz Felfe, who had grown closer and closer to Reinhard Gehlen during his career in the RND, which brought things closer to Gehlen, of course. However, the most damning piece of information dawned in the mind of Gerhard Wessel: Heinz Felfe had been in Kiew for a criminal autopsy.\n\n"Someone forged these documents." Wessel said, in shock. The two men nodded, Kessler burning through a cigarette in the meantime. "Someone is throwing off this entire investigation. Someone powerful." The questioned remained however: should he intend to pursue whoever is throwing everything off, or would it just lead to their deaths?"
 speer_rnd.48.a:0 "Follow the enemy in the ink!"

 speer_rnd.49.t:0 "The Devil's in the Details"
 speer_rnd.49.d:0 "Gerhard Wessel spent his waking hours and nights of supposed sleep investigating Wedekind and Kessler's findings. What should have been time to see friends, loved ones, or co-workers, instead was spent looking at photos of a dead gunman, and a counterfeit autopsy supposedly performed by a man hundreds of miles away. And yet, the documents kept showing more and more proof for Wessel.\n\nAs he stared at the documents, rushes and waves of doubt filled Wessel's mind, as the typically astute, focused, and efficient man turned inwards to paranoia and fear. The man who fought so diligently beside him, as a father, Reinhard Gehlen, and yet his name was plastered all over the investigation, whilst his words covered falsified information and throw offs from the main investigation. Was it true Gehlen? No, it couldn't be, this man was loyal to the Reich, why would he throw things off for a genuinely efficient information bureau that had trusted him dearly? Wessel's minds wandered throughout the worries and doubts of the world, as his entire career up to this point became jeopardized with the notions working in the midst of treachery, while other times it proceeded to become laser-focused on the difficult matter in front of him, looking for any potential leads and openings into this dreadful case of treachery and dangers around every corner. Suddenly, the familiar smoky odor alerted Wessel as he put away the material into his desk and Reinhard Gehlen came in.\n\n"Good afternoon, Wessel. Here, you got some departmental mail regarding last month's procedures and some ways we're looking to improve, figure you may have some worthwhile input, after all." Gehlen said, flashing a smile at his subordinate before leaving. Wessel's tired, sunken eyes could hardly stand any more bureaucracy, when his hands ran along the curious material of the rubber stamp attached to the envelope. That's when an idea hatched in Wessel's mind, and he cleared through his desk to gather the documents, and each of their attached envelopes. Each had a similar rubber stamp, in fact, on closer inspection and magnification, Wessel realized they were all the same: the stamp of Horst Wendland, Vice President of the RND."

 speer_rnd.50.d:0 "Cologne is a bustling and prosperous city with a rich culture - if your definition of a rich culture was one not torn down by the NSDAP. It would make for a pleasant vacation, but that's not what Wessel was here for. In fact, one of the first sights he saw when he was there was students spilling out from a street corner, chanting vague insults and protests against the government; he and his fellow agents, however, simply passed by them. They were not the focus.\n\nThis was where Horst Wendland made his base of operations for the day, and Wessel received quite the good news about the state of it. At some point in the afternoon, Wendland was scheduled to have dinner with one Hermann Ludke, an admiral in the Kriegsmarine. Why an admiral and the vice president of the RND met up was unknown to him, but he had his musings on the matter. Still, he wasn't here to spy on them. In fact, quite the opposite.\n\nIn Germany's decadence, many officials slacked on caring about having paranoia-levels of security wherever they went. Wessel had fully expected Wendland to be just like his superior, but clearly he was mistaken. And thankfully so, otherwise this would've been a fruitless endeavour. A report was leaked to Wessel and his team, brief and to the point. Wendland's main documents were stored in an apartment on the other side of the city, and that the only real security was the hotel staff. Something that his crackshot agents could easily get through."
 speer_rnd.50.a:0 "You know what to do, men."

 speer_rnd.51.t:0 "Hands in the Gaps"
 speer_rnd.51.d:0 "They struck gold. Not only did they arrive just in time, as Wendland seemingly exited the apartment only an hour prior, but the security in the hotel was particularly lax. So lax, in fact, that one of Wessel's agents managed to sneak straight into the entrance. With short radio telecommunications at hand, the agent was slowly guided to the room Wendland had made himself comfortable in, and, after dodging another guard and spending about ten seconds picking the lock to his room, he was in.\n\nThe agent quickly found out that something was off. A large, black object was hidden in the corner of the room, draped in clothing and backed behind a chair, but anything above a passive glance could tell that it didn't belong there. Remembering how the clothes were originally placed, the agent took them off and uncovered... a safe. After relaying this information, some surprise was felt from Wessel's side, but it quickly faded away as he considered his options. There were two, each with their pros and cons.\n\nThe first was to simply bug the system. Wendland was not a very competent nor careful person in Wessel's eyes, so he highly doubted that he would spot that his safe was bugged. It would give easy access to whatever was heard inside his room, though the contents of the safe itself would not be directly uncovered to him.\n\nThe second was to blow the damn thing open and run like hell. It would throw all caution out of the window and make Wendland certain that he knew someone was tracking him, but as long as the contents inside are worth it, the reward would outweigh the risk."

 speer_rnd.52.t:0 "Listen And Listen Well"
 speer_rnd.52.d:0 "With the agent who bugged the safe, Wessel stood in his office and prepared the audio recorder to playback the important part that they managed to get out after an entire day of searching through what was spoken. Tapping the button, Wessel kept his ears sharp.\n\n"... Oh yeah, and one last thing. There's that place I wanted to empty out. What?"\n"..."\n"No, not that. The other one. The... the warehouse." A few seconds of silence followed by an audible sigh. "No. Alright, I'm talking about that specific warehouse, alright? The one I asked you to clear out days ago, but you still haven't gotten around to doing it. What's that?"\n"..."\n"I see. That doesn't matter now. I'm giving you the order again - the warehouse. Tell some of your agents to move the files somewhere else by the end of the week. Yes, tell them to go to Leverkusen, and-"\n\nLetting go of the button, Wessel looked up at the agent. "And that's all that's important?" He asked, and the other man nodded. Wessel stood up to his full height and gave the man a brief nod back. "I want our agents set out immediately - preferably by airplane. We don't know how much time is left on our hands, and whatever is in that warehouse is important. You are dismissed.""
 speer_rnd.52.a:0 "With a crisp salute, the man left the room and Wessel to his scattered thoughts."

 speer_rnd.53.t:0 "Perhaps Too Well"
 speer_rnd.53.d:0 "Wessel had decided to personally visit the warehouse in the day leading up to the trip. He himself wasn't certain why, but he simply had a desire to see it with his own eyes. Thankfully, the entire process was far less troublesome than any pessimistic expectation he had. There were no dramatic encounters, only an empty warehouse with even emptier contents. It took them ten whole minutes of searching before they found something. In a boarded-up room, one of Wessel's agents found a table with documents and tape recorders.\n\nInitially he sent an agent to examine it, but after just a minute he returned to Wessel and told him something that stopped him in his tracks and made his ever-professional facade break for a moment. Asking the agent to guide him to the room, Wessel was left alone with the contents on the table, now laid out at his disposal.\n\nHe played one tape recorder, then another, then another. They all played back the same voice. His own professional demeanor reverberating back at him. And occasionally, another voice joined in.\n\nGehlen's- and the contents of these discussions were all about Büro Wessel and its activities. Something beyond Wendland's reach. This was no petty crime, and as Wessel left the room, his mind began stirring. It was impossible that Gehlen let his vice president run amok so freely, taping conversations. Even for a man as bizarre as his superior, he didn't consider him to be that incompetent - and so the worry in his mind refused to go away as he and his agents abandoned the warehouse and wiped any trace of their presence clean."

 speer_rnd.54.d:0 "He hadn't remembered how long it had been since he had done something like this. For the past few days Büro Wessel, from an outsider's perspective, looked like it was in a state of disarray. Wessel himself, however, knew the machinations of bureaucracy. He prepared orders, he scouted locations, he made sure that the points were covered and that the loopholes were closed. There was nowhere for this insubordinate to go. Nowhere to run. All the secrets that Wendland had been hiding from him would be revealed, whether he wanted to or not.\n\nAt the crack of twilight, Wessel stood tall, facing down the stoic gazes of about seven agents, all looking at him, all betraying no emotion on their face. "Today, you will spend the entire day searching for a single man in this city. We've put down a few locations, and you will each visit them together. Do not separate, do not stand out, do not hesitate. Your goal is to do only one thing, and I expect you to succeed with haste." They all gave sharp salutes in tandem with each other, Wessel nodding once.\n\n"With my authorization, Horst Wendland is now considered a wanted man in Germany and its subsidiary territories. The charges are treason, insubordination, and conspiracy against the state. Do you all understand?" He asked, and to that the men responded with a "Sir, yes, sir!""

 speer_rnd.55.d:0 "The explosion that rocked the room and was heard throughout the whole building sent the skeleton security team into overdrive, but miraculously enough, the agent for the job managed to slip by and escape with the contents of the safe. By that night, they were laid out in front of a table, Wessel himself looking over what was stolen from Wendland. He only wished that blowing their cover - literally, in fact - would have been worth it.\n\nPapers and files, cases and documents. All things Wessel handled gently, but all things that served no purpose to him in the end. They were all about other things not related to the Büro Wessel, or Antifa, or the student protests. Frustration that was present in his mind only grew throughout the night, until after about half an hour of searching, there was nothing.\n\nExcept the one thing yet to be researched. There was an undeveloped roll of film, waiting to be explored. With only one avenue left, Wessel pursued it with intent to find out if this whole operation wasn't just a waste of time."
 speer_rnd.55.a:0 "Perhaps there is a silver lining in all of this..."

 speer_rnd.56.t:0 "Cut Through The Fog"
 speer_rnd.56.d:0 "The few days Wessel had to wait were painful days. There could have been quite possibly anything on that film, ranging from the most trite, pointless things completely unrelated to what he was doing to... things he didn't want to waste his time thinking about. After all, it was only the results that mattered.\n\nAnd the results eventually came. In his office, he was handed the developed film by an agent of his who hadn't looked at it, and then promptly left the office, leaving the man by himself. From the top, he uncovered his thumb to look at the first picture of the set, and...\n\nWessel felt his heart drop. On the first picture - the very first - there was an image, clear as day, of something being pictured against a wooden table. On a closer glance, he could make out the markings and the design. This was no ordinary document. This was a document that belonged to the Büro Wessel. Then another picture - this time it was open, revealing its incredibly damaging contents inside. While his face was stoic, his mind was in a whirl. Drawn in by the shock, he looked at another image, then another, then another.\n\nBy the end, it had been a long time since Wessel felt such anger brewing in him. But it was driven with a purpose."

 speer_rnd.57.d:0 "The sight of Wessel standing in front of Wendland's cell gave him endless shivers. He was not appreciative of the man's cold, empty, fury-filled stare, not at all. When he eventually spoke, Wendland nearly jumped out of his skin. "Don't waste my time, Horst." Wessel almost snarled. "I want you to answer a few simple questions for me." Wendland backed away, his face already paling. "N-no, wait, what do y-you mean by 'simple questions'?" He asked back, and Wessel merely stared at him further.\n\n"What reason did you have for taking pictures of top-secret documents belonging to the Büro Wessel?" His was a voice of stone, betraying nothing, but those familiar with it could make out the invisible intricacies. The purest sense of anger. Wendland only managed to stutter a few meaningless words before Wessel cut him off sharply. "Full sentences. Scattered words do not answer my question."\n\n"I... I c-can't tell you! If I-- if I did, I'd-I-I wouldn't-" Wessel loudly sighed. "Next question." His eyes narrowed even further. "How did you manage to take these pictures? You are--were, under the direct oversight of Reinhard Gehlen." Something was implicated in his words, and Wendland's eyes widened. "No... no, don't ask me that! Don't ask me that!" He yelled, and Wessel's posture refused to change as he spoke. "Who were your associates, Wendland? If you can't answer that, I'll have to pass you on to my other agents."\n\nHe backed up behind a wall, and kept his hands tight on the uncomfortable bed below him. Tremors ran down his limbs, and he couldn't help to stop the incessant shaking of his head, telling him to look away. "God, no, please, I can't-I don't..." He trailed off, and Wessel raised an eyebrow. Would he finally speak? He was almost about to feel some relief when Wendland suddenly shut his eyes tight and made a strange noise akin to a grunt and a gasp, as his head rolled back. When Wessel saw that, his stance broke, and he muttered the slightest 'no' before shouting an order for his agents to come over."

He was killed in a firefight with another group - mercenaries of some sort."\n\nReinhard took a drag of his cigarette. The corners of his mouth tightened ever so slightly. "And you thought it necessary to attempt to contact him, to risk his mission, a mission your Büro had no part in? For all you know, you led these men right to him."\n\n"No. This was a coordinated, pre-planned attack. I was lucky to even see him alive." Wessel noticed the smallest twitch as Gehlen responded.\n\n"You spoke with him?"\n\nCurious. "No. But I overheard enough. He was a double agent. He had been feeding them information ever since he joined. Why?"\n\nReinhard leant over the desk and ground his cigarette into the crystal ashtray. "You seem to forget who is debriefing whom, Herr Kätzchen." Gerhard internally grimaced at the all-too forced codename. "I do not like what you imply. Felfe was a traitor, and his treachery caught up with him." He looked pointedly at Wessel. "You are not privy to the details of every operation this organisation performs. I suggest you get used to that fact."\n\n"Verflitzes Kätzchen" glowered, though his face remained a mask of patience. As he wished.

He remained deathly silent as his number two agent spoke. "Agent Kleiner Fuchs," he began, betraying nothing but the slightest annoyance. "These," he continued, pointing fingers at the pictures in front of Gehlen. They were... damaging, to say the least. Proof that Wendland had taken pictures of top secret info that only Wessel's agency would have access to. "What are these, sir? How did the vice-president of the RND get these images? Not only that, he committed suicide via a cyanide pill when questioned about it."\n\nGehlen, after a long period of silence that only served to further annoy Wessel, sighed. "Agent Verflitzes Kätzchen..." He began, pushing the pictures towards him slightly. "These questions shouldn't concern you. They should concern me." He said, voice tightening slightly. "I know the trigger for his suicide. When you asked him about who these pictures were for, correct?" At that, Wessel's breathing became just a bit heavier. "Are you looking for something, Agent... ? A sort of... conspiracy, perhaps?"\n\n"Sir." Wessel returned, staring with an attempt to scan Gehlen's emotions. They were not pleasant. "I am not making any claims. I just want to find out why Wendland took these pictures, and why he committed suicide. If I can get the help of the RND..." Gehlen shook his head. "No, no, no. Agent, you misunderstand. I never requested that such a thing like this be in your portfolio when I gave you your own agency." Gehlen's frown turned into a light smile, and Wessel felt like he wanted to grab on to something. "This is not your problem to deal with. It is mine. I suggest... downscaling your ideas of what you should do and realizing what you should not do."

The bracing wind forced him to pull his coat closer to himself, and he quickly entered the black Mercedes awaiting him. "Pleasant trip, sir?" The agent sat opposite him proffered him a file, and gave a tap on the glass between them and the driver. The car pulled away with a purr.\n\n"As good as it could be in this weather." Gerhard opened the file. He had read it before but he preferred to commit information to memory. Paper was unreliable. "Where is Felfe located? The sooner we find out what he knows about the autopsy, the better."\n\nThe agent looked down sheepishly. "I'm afraid we've been unable to locate him, sir. As soon as I arrived I swept his known hangouts, but by all accounts he hasn't been seen in over a week. We searched his home top to bottom, but no luck."\n\nWessel gave an almost imperceptible frown. The agent's head lowered further. He had expected complications, naturally - complications were nine tenths of his work. Without Felfe, however, this lead was a dead end. Felfe was apparently only person left to have seen the autopsy report, and the fact he hadn't already revealed it indicated he was saving it for someone else.\n\nThe car slowly pulled its way through the streets of Kiew. It was a difficult task - the roads were potholed and clogged with a mixture of ancient Soviet vehicles belching smoke and imported German cars, seeming all the more grimy for their spots of gloss black. The signposts were a confusing mixture of German and Ukrainian - both in Cyrillic and the bastardised Latin script that had developed from the confluence of cultures.

It was remarkable what you could learn just from walking the streets, visiting the bars, finding the feel of people.\n\nNaturally, the Ukrainians and Russians remained churlish against the Reich, with many a drunken curse raised against the Germans. While his agents had indeed determined the presence of local resistance movements, both left and right, they were not his concern. No, it was what he had found in an alley behind a decaying beer hall that disturbed him.\n\n"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit". Not words he had expected to hear in this place, the severed half of their national anthem. Well, one of them, he smirked. He tossed the pamphlet back to his desk, the black, red, gold seeming to glow in the light. Reichsbanner had beaten him here - a deeply disturbing prospect. He had expected locals, but for German insurgent movements to have travelled this far East?\n\nThis all but confirmed it - Felfe's previous mission regarding the Ukrainians was only a secondary concern to him. Felfe no doubt knew Reichsbanner had been here, but had never reported it. He had been compromised. A skilled infiltrator, Felfe would have attempted to worm his way into the local resistance. Gerhard knew not where to find Reichsbanner, but his Büro had leads on the Ukrainians. He would find the man, by hook or by crook."

No claim that outrageous holds up to close inspection however, and a few smashed printing presses later revealed that the author, one Viacheslav Chornovil, occupied the deep forests outside Kiew along with his band of outlaws. Chornovil was viewed as something of a Robin Hood figure by the locals, and had been a great disturbance in the region to Wessel's colleagues. Thus the Büro began its search, finding a remarkable lack of dissidents and a surfeit of trees. It was not until one agent quite literally fell into the answer, that they located a tunnel.\n\nOne geologist and several aerial surveys later, they determined the locations of the other entrances. Thus, Gerhard waited, lying under a pile of branches and camouflage netting. Two other entrances were monitored by his two best agents, and they had made note of the incomings and outgoings of the sizeable tunnel complex - more than two dozen separate people were noted. Wessel made a mental note to order any similar networks rooted out immediately. Through his binoculars, Wessel noticed motion. Glancing at the blurry photo captured yesterday, he recognised the moustachioed face of Viacheslav Chornovil clambering from a cramped tunnel, before sitting on a rock and lighting a cigarette. Gerhard exhaled sharply as he recognised the second rising figure as Heinz Felfe.\n\nGerhard cursed himself for the distance at which he had placed himself - overly cautious, he could not hear their words. However, a shared cigarette and a firm handshake could only imply a deal was being made. He was about to shift closer, when the crack of gunfire ripped through the morning silence."

Felfe lay at the edge of the clearing, blood already caking his shirt.\n\n"We were expecting you, Wessel."\n\nDespite his best efforts, Gerhard started at the use of his name. Chornovil rose, and gestured to his men to let Wessel stand.\n\n"Felfe told us many things. He knew you would come after him eventually. You spend too much time chasing corpses, Mister Wessel." Chornovil smirked - despite Wessel's trained expression, he knew he had struck a nerve. This was undoubtedly not what Gerhard had predicted. Felfe had revealed infinitely more than he expected, and certainly not out of incompetence. "I will admit, I did not expect this attack. I presume it was not your doing, yes?"\n\nGerhard scowled. It would be smart to remain alive - and it would be smarter still to understand why he was allowed to remain alive. "Yes."\n\nChernovil stood eye to eye with Gerhard.

 speer_rnd.66.t:0 "Spy vs Spy"
 speer_rnd.66.d:0 "Maintaining the flow of information was Wessel's job. No decision should be made without the most complete knowledge of the situation possible, and it was the Reichsnachrichtendienst that kept these channels of information open - or so he had thought. It seemed Reinhard had fallen into that old spymaster's trap, the hoarding of knowledge for his own sake. It was therefore up to Wessel to restart the flow.\n\nTo the untrained eye, the headquarters of the Reich's foremost intelligence agency was just another office building. Cleaners have a unique ability to go unnoticed in a crowded room. All too easy for a loose sheet of paper or a cassette to fall into the bag while its owner was preoccupied. A microphone concealed within a lampshade might be noticed in an office, but nobody would even consider searching for one behind the bowl of a toilet, and conversations become less formal when one has their fly undone.\n\nGerhard now enjoyed the fruits of his labours in his office. The unmarked cassette was playing into a pair of headphones. The fact that this tape existed at all was damning enough, but the contents disturbed him greatly. The recording was of a phone conversation - at one end Gehlen's crackling voice; the other, the unmistakable tone of their Führer Albert Speer. He listened to it to its completion, then removed the film from the tape, concealing it within an empty bottle of pills. Gehlen was a true rogue agent, at the head of one of the world's largest intelligence agencies. Reinhard was smart, and revealed much while demanding nothing - nonetheless, Gerhard could recognise the hint of extortion.\n\nTruly, nobody was without sin - Gerhard had known many of the darker secrets of the Reich, but could only hypothesise whether Speer had been party to them. If Gehlen revealed any of what he had found, the Reich would collapse in on itself. Speer had buried his past deep yet Gehlen found it nonetheless. A stark warning of what he was facing. If he was to act against Reinhard Gehlen he must act fast - for the safety of the Reich that his mentor had so clearly forgotten."

There were only a select few he could trust with this information - he could only pray he would reach them before Gehlen realised what was missing. He marched through the office floor of the Büro Wessel, giving dismissive nods to those who met his gaze.\n\n"Excuse me, Herr Kätzchen? I have a message for you."\n\nGerhard turned to see a man in dark sunglasses. The man extended his right hand with a slip of paper, clearly expecting him to take it. His left was lazily resting in his coat pocket. Wessel reached into his pocket as though reaching for a pen; his eyes darted from side to side, establishing the visitor was alone. The man's eyebrows furrowed, and the corner of his mouth turned as he realised his bluff had been called.\n\nWessel pulled his penknife from his pocket all too slowly, as the man's left hand emerged from his coat holding a slim pistol. In one smooth motion the man's arms straightened, the oversized suppressor brushing against Wessel's ear as he jerked to the side. Its detonation nonetheless deafened him and threw off his balance, and he fell into the assassin in a tangle of limbs. A blind thrust of the blade made contact and he stabbed, the knife finally connecting with the man's throat.\n\nWith a gurgle the man in sunglasses expired. Wessel arose, clutching at the side of his head. The bullet had grazed his skull, and from what he could tell taken most of his left ear with it. The shot had roused the rest of the Büro, and Wessel had to slam down the telephone of a wide eyed secretary who was in the process of calling the Orpo. Whatever number was dialled next, Wessel could guarantee it would not be the one that picked up.\n\nHe barked out swift orders to leave. His Büro had planned for a situation similar to this, though he had never thought they would ever be implemented. His staff would scatter, and the Büro would go dark. He, however, had a meeting to attend. If Speer was compromised, he had to find the next best thing. Exiting through his own secret door, hidden in a den of electrical wires and transformers, he turned up his collar, put on his hat and made for the Reichskanzlei."

The Chancellor had assured him of the man's trustworthiness, but that did not stop Gerhard from uneasily glaring at him whenever he went to produce some instrument from his bag. He attempted to piece together the recent events in his head, whilst he had a moment of peace.\n\nDutschke's murder had been the flashpoint, and Gerhard was now all but certain Gehlen had ordered it. Further still, Bachmann had been eliminated to throw Wessel off the trail. Gehlen's Büro had been hoarding secrets, making hidden contacts, selling information that was not theirs to sell. They had actively been working against Wessel's own agents from the beginning. To what end? And most damning of all, Gehlen was extorting the Führer himself - one last insurance policy in case the depth of his double-dealing came to light.\n\nHow had this happened? Reinhard Gehlen was an intelligent man, one Wessel had looked up to. Now, Gehlen had sunk to sending hitmen after him in broad daylight. He was sloppy, out of touch, and most of all he could not be trusted. Trust was everything in their business - who to trust and distrust decided who was alive and who was dead. He turned to look out of the window, and glimpsed a dull red glow.\n\nHe shook off the protesting doctor, and went to the window. In the distance were the party rally grounds, the great theatre in which the NSDAP had performed their ecstatic rallies ever since Hitler took power. In the centre was the Ehrentribüne, the vast podium wreathed with swastikas from which he had spoke and yelled and cried, which to many represented the golden days.\n\nIt was burning."

If slavery were to be abolished at once, the Reich would collapse, for few Germans had maintained the skills required to manage an industrial economy. Of course, this message went unheeded by the slaves themselves.\n\nKZ Monowitz, a work camp producing synthetic rubber for IG Farben, had suffered in productivity this last month. The predominantly Polish workers had attempted a campaign of passive protest, gathering in their hundreds and refusing to work until their demands were met. These demands had included increased rations, shorter working hours and the right to contact their families outside in what was once Poland.\n\nUnfortunately, these demands had not reached the capital by the time the protests had been dealt with. The camp guards, some of whom had been dealt a beating before being expelled had received encouragement from the camp's management in IG Farben, and with support from the local Orpo force bloodily retook the camp. Fatalities had been estimated at up to 70% of the workforce. The duty of Wessel and his Büro was to improve future camp security, and prevent the spread of protests."

Attempt to cordon them in one block and they acquired a supernatural knowledge of the way out. Reports from one end of the city of spontaneous riots would turn out to be false leads, allowing further damage in other areas. Every time they attempted to contain the protests they found some way around, creating the constant background of yelling that seemed to encompass Germania these days.\n\nDamnation, but Reichsbanner was good.

While all were reluctant to send in the army, it had been accepted to use off duty servicemen and party members in old police gear. Still, the line seemed all too thin.\n\nHis investigations had been slow. These protests were organized - radio frequency scans had revealed encrypted transmissions of a type that none of his cryptographers had been able to break yet. That the code would be broken was inevitable, for his Büro had unofficial access to the largest supercomputers in the Reich - the question was, would that be soon enough? If Reichsbanner were responsible they were proving smart enough that more than likely they would have shifted to new frequencies and new codes by the time they RND had broken the encryption.\n\nHe allowed himself a cigarette - a rare luxury. Addiction was a weakness, but it had been long enough that he didn't care. Whoever was behind this had funding and brainpower, enough to stay that one step ahead.

Kurass's official report states that he acted in self defence when Muller attacked him with an improvised weapon. Muller's friends, when later questioned, would state that Muller was dragged into an alley by Kurass and his comrades. The post-mortem examination confirmed that Muller was shot in the back of the head. The results had not been published, and the internal investigation had soon been called off. Kurass would be remanded internally, for to bring charges against a police officer at this time would be dangerous.\n\nWessel cursed the thugs they hired to the Orpo, cursed the whole sorry affair.

No more aliases or stupid disguises, no more double dealings or treason. Once I am done with the Reichsnachrichtendienst, it will be extremely hard to tell you ever existed at all."\n\nReinhard gave a sad smile. "As it should be, I suppose.

Without the threat of a powerful enemy, corruption and infighting began tearing the Wehrmacht apart in what historians would probably call "a twisted parody of the Late Roman Empire".\n\nLike the Roman generals they were so fond of, the highest German officers bought the loyalty of their men by promising hefty bonuses at the end of their service, siphoning the needed funds from the Reich's budget with the subtle threat of open revolt should anyone refuse them. As a result, the Wehrmacht bloated horrendously, eating more and more of the public expenses and contributing to the final collapse of the German economy. The increase in dimensions, however, didn't result in a better military: on the contrary, overloaded logistics, unfit recruits, outdated equipment and infighting between officers turned what was once a jewel of efficiency into a wheezing sick patient, as the West Russian War showed perfectly.\n\nNow, with the civil war over, von Tresckow has planned a large reform of the German armed forces to return them to their former glory. The program will concern all of the Wehrmacht, from the Heer, to the Luftwaffe, to the Kriegsmarine: everything will be turned upside down, until it fits his ideals once again. However, this won't be an easy task: many officers of the old guard are still in active service and will try to resist the reform at all costs, especially if they are supported by the conservative elements of the NSDAP.

The German air force was the personal playground of Hermann Göring, the man responsible for the current decadence of the Reich, and a large number of officers owe their rank to him: despite his defeat, his political clout is still present, and it will take time and effort to remove it before any real reform can be passed without mass desertions or worse.\n\nGöring's influence, however, wasn't limited to the officers, but it covered even the doctrinal aspects of air combat. As of now, our air fleet is heavily unbalanced towards long-range bombers - the result of a decade-long bombing campaign over Russia and Western Africa - and even worse, due to the gargantuan costs of running such a meaningless operation, there weren't enough funds to develop new airframes to keep up with the new discoveries.\n\nAs a result of this, the Luftwaffe is extremely outdated in both doctrines and equipment, despite its large numbers, and will most likely perform with abysmal results against any modern air force of the world."

This exponential growth, however, overloaded the supply system until it finally broke, and only served to enrich the weapons industry in cahoots with the military leadership.\n\nWith the constant downturn of the German economy, more and more money was diverted towards maintaining this living corpse - the mere thought of cutting military spending was met with subtle threats of civil war - with the result that any kind of research or improvement was halted due to lack of funds. Poorly-trained soldiers, outdated panzers, malfunctioning aircraft and old doctrines were the reasons for the collapse of the German defenses during the West Russian War, but not even this was enough to let the corrupt High Command understand the depth of their mistakes, and the Heer continued its decadence.\n\nWith the civil war over, the Heer has been left reeling from its losses and from the difficulty of serving once more alongside those who mere months before were manning a machine gun aimed at you. This, however, is also the perfect time for reform: von Tresckow has a clear idea of what he wants the German army to become, and he won't stop until it has become reality.

The West Russian War saw spelled even more cuts for the navy as the generals took more and more funds for their pet projects and to feed the bloated monster that was now the army.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out, the Kriegsmarine sided with Bormann, but Dönitz decided to retreat to Crimea, realizing that no matter his allegiance, there was no way the navy could do anything except getting either sunk or scuttled.\n\nDespite surviving the war almost untouched, however, the Kriegsmarine is in a dire state. Years of neglect have left the navy small and obsolete, with most ships dating back to the last war: as things are, a total overhaul is needed in both doctrine and equipment, to bring it back from the dead and turn it into a modern fleet. Despite the resistances of admirals formerly close to Dönitz, von Tresckow knows a new and powerful Kriegsmarine is necessary if Germany is to return at the forefront of military innovation."

On one hand, we could go the safe route and focus on infantry weapons: better rifles and grenades will have an impact throughout the entire Heer, no matter the unit or doctrine. Another choice is artillery: gone are the times of giant railway guns, now self-propelled weapons and light, infantry-portable mortars are the way forward, improving mobility and efficiency of the support units. Some wish to improve the support echelons of the Heer with better logistics, modern engineers and advanced medical detachments to fully aid our troops in their task.

When the officers of the Wehrmacht started siding with this or that pretender, swearing their loyalty to their frontrunner, they caused a bloody civil war that caused untold amounts of victims.\n\nNow, some reformist officers wish to fully detach the army from the party, even more than what the new leader desires, and the first step would be to replace the oath of loyalty to the Führer with a more neutral oath to the nation and its institutions. While these officers aren't showing any sign of disloyalty, and will accept any decision on the matter, it's evident that this will have repercussions on the larger political debate: already the reformists within the Reichstag call for a comprehensive reform to remove any political influence in the army, while the conservatives are trying to stop what they call a "dangerous push towards anarchy".\n\nAs the government is called to decide on the matter, what will the Führer do?

The armed forces of the Reich have been taken from the clutches of self-serving, corrupt and incapable officers, and safely restored to their intended role which is, of course, to serve the Führer above all else! The disloyalty and corruption among the branches of the Wehrmacht have been eradicated, and we stand ready to retake the world as our great leader, Adolf Hitler, envisioned in his dream!\n\nThe Heer stands ready, larger than ever and restored to peak efficiency. The soldiers know their place in the greater picture, and know that their duty is to rise the eagle of National Socialism ever higher! The Luftwaffe shall cover the skies like the arrows of the Persians at the Thermopylae, destroying all in their relentless path to victory: let all those who are foolish enough to stand between us and our destiny know the true meaning of despair! The Kriegsmarine is now ready to take the sea, the other fleets of the world nothing but sheep to feed the hungry wolves circling around their prey!\n\nAmong all this greatness, one man stands taller than any other. Our great Führer is extremely satisfied of the results, though von Tresckow isn't all that happy about the way things turned out to be, but he will stay silent and appreciate our newfound greatness, if he cares about his place in the government...\n\nA toast, kameraden!

speermilitary.11.desc:0 "The former French colonies of Mauritius and Réunion are a fundamental asset to the Kriegsmarine. Put under our control following the emergency in Madagaskar, they serve to refuel the military ships passing through the Cape, allowing the Reich to project its naval power well into the Indian Ocean. In the period following Hitler's passing, the islands found themselves somewhat neglected as military resources were diverted to more pressing problems, weakening our presence.\n\nWith our internal problems solved, it's now time to take back our position as a prominent seafaring nation, and it's only a given that we need suitable bases for our navy squadrons, especially with the Mediterranean being in control of rather unfriendly regimes.\n\nTo address this, the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine is unanimous in the proposed solution. We shall bring our attention to Mauritius and Réunion and reinforce their intended role, improving the infrastructure to allow for larger patrols and squadrons to plunge deep into the Indian Ocean, combined with naval exercises to enhance our capabilities in this far-flung corner."

speermilitary.12.desc:0 "Even in this forgotten corner of the world, Germany refuses to let anything slip from their claws.\n\nA communique arrived via radio broadcast just hours ago from the Reich; though communications with the continent are usually verbose in tone, this message was brusque and brutally clear. Berlin demands complete surrender and the return of the islands to the Reich or else within 48 hours a state of war would exist between us. Given the predisposition of Berlin and the unnaturally lethal tone of the message, we have been given every reason to believe that they intend to make good on their promise.\n\nOur forces - those that will follow our orders at least - are being made ready, though none hold the delusion that the Reich's warmachine could be bested. Perhaps, however, they will not have to be. Given our geographical position and relative miniscularity, it is unlikely that they would bring to bear the entire Wehrmacht against Madagaskar. As such, if they send a proportionate force it is possible to resist and make a quick invasion turn into a grueling exercise in hubris.\n\nBut even so, not even our most optimistic officers expect this assumption to prove true, as the Germans are just as likely to rain ordnance on our heads until we throw down our weapons or die in the process, and it's likely they don't much care which outcome arises first. Ultimately, the ruthless calculus of war has a habit of reducing one's choices. Our future can only lie on one path; do we stand down and submit the islands to the Reich, or make Berlin come and take them?"

When their reply was not made ready quickly enough, an incoming fly-over of the island by our bombers served to catalyze a faster response. As of right now reprisals are planned, but we are working to ensure that sufficient control of the islands and the surrounding waters are achieved first so as to avoid any last-minute complications; even as we are past the point of armed resistance, we intend to avoid the possibility of further issues arising.\n\nThough ownership of Madagaskar and its islands is important to the dominance of those southern seas, the true fruit of this endeavor is the public image of a once rebellious land willfully submitting to the rightful rule of our administration. What could have potentially been a disastrous military conflict has instead been transformed into an example of the statesmanship we embody; hopefully we will not need to make a similar example for some time."

The islands of Madagaskar not only project vital power along the African coast and the Indian Ocean, but by allowing it to fall to a - ultimately suicidal - seperatist force has resulted in a poor image for the Reich. Our attempts to unify our sphere are crucial to the continuing survival of Germany, and a rogue nation demonstrating the ability to slip free from our authority may result in a domino-effect for our less compliant lands. Therefore, if they seek to become an example to others, then we shall make them one.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine has been notified and is being made ready to leave their moorings to prepare for the invasion, army groups are being formed and instructed on how to retake the island, and munitions are already being tasked to air-elements in the region to soften it for our arrival. This affront to the lawful authority of the islands cannot be left to stand and, though it is regrettable that it has been forced to come to this, we must now prepare to make these wayward sons aware of that fact."

"I cannot think of another explanation for the Kriegsmarine's inscrutable failure with this operation," replied a similarly frustrated von Tresckow. "It is literally incomprehensible to me that our armed forces would be unable to reconquer fucking Madagaskar. It's Madagaskar, for god's sake! Did our intelligence not suggest that they recently had a fucking five-way civil war? Seriously Generalfeldmarschall, what the hell? How is this even remotely possible?" The Generalfeldmarschall did not know how this was possible, so he did not bother to reply.\n\nSpeer calmed himself down, and was thankful no one else was here to witness his highly unusual outburst. To be fair, could he really have been blamed given the ridiculous circumstances? "Well, as humiliating as it is, let us prepare peace negotiations for whoever the hell is even in charge of that god-forsaken island. I suppose they'll simply want their sovereignty to be respected, and perhaps a few other small concessions."

We needed nothing short of a miracle for our tiny forces to successfully resist the full force of the Kriegsmarine, and no such miracle occurred. While we fought back as hard as we could, it only took so long for the Germans to seize these small, hardly populated islands.\n\nThere is no choice for us but to surrender to Germany. Hopefully they will at least be lenient and merciful, though history suggests that this is not likely. The islands of the Indian Ocean have changed colonial masters several times within the last few years. When they will probably never see true independence, what is one more changing of hands to the peoples who inhabit them?"

Though our people probably do not care in the slightest about some tiny islands thousands of kilometres away, we at least have something to demonstrate the success of our administration and the restoration of the Reich's global strength," responded Speer. "That will be all, then."\n\nIt might have been all for Madagaskar, but it will not be all for the reconquests demanded by German Imperialism.

It could just be to retake the strategically valuable islands of Mauritius and Réunion, or perhaps they have worse in mind, but either way we know that Germany is actively preparing to invade our territory quite soon.\n\nIt is hard to see how this is a winnable fight for us, but we will not abandon any of our people or territory.

The Kriegsmarine is actually withdrawing from the region and we will be able to sign a peace treaty with Germany. It's still hard to believe that this is real."

However, an airplane is much more complicated than a gun or a tank, and even the testing process reflects this: once the research department has finalized the proposed designs, the testing truly begins with the flight tests.\n\nIn this phase, unfortunate pilots are put at the helm of what can range from a perfectly-functional jet fighter to a flying coffin only waiting to close itself on the poor sod. Takeoff accidents, on-air engine failures, sudden airframe detachment, and many, many more: the list of the problems experienced by testing pilots is only as long as the list of the causes of their death, and many promising aviators have met their untimely end just because the one in charge of development forgot to factor a zero, or to put a comma where it was needed.\n\nStill, no one can deny that the results of this tear-filled process are extremely promising, and so the airstrips of the military airports across the Reich fill with strange, barely-flying planes challenging the laws of physics with frames barely kept together with glue, thread and the fervent prayers of their pilots."

"Such a perfect time to fly," he thought with a small sigh, then he chuckled: his wife always complained that he lost entire hours staring outside the window, but what could he do? He was an aviator, his very soul linked to the endless blue: only his brothers-in-arms could understand the feeling of longing to be up there, high into the clouds, literally on top of the world. Humans however, unlike birds, need artificial wings to reach above the clouds, and he was too old for that now, so he did the only thing he could do: he looked outside, and remembered the old days.\n\nHis gaze passed over the small display case near the fireplace: his two Iron Crosses were there, alongside his pistol and a small piece of the airplane he almost died inside when he was downed the second time. He shuddered at the memory, but even those difficult days were so beautiful, so dangerous, so exciting! Back then, when he had served the Kaiser in Italy and France, airplanes were but wooden caskets with an engine: to think that such things could even fly without exploding! And yet he was witness to their agility and power, and to the bravery and camaraderie of the men piloting them. He remembered the Caproni bomber he desperately tried to take down above Treviso, only for himself to be the one falling to the ground. He remembered flying over Verdun during a night with no moon, the artillery strikes lighting the darkness like a starry sky upside down. He remembered his comrades, his friends, even his enemies, all people who fought with their life to the line, and never surrendered.\n\nA voice awakened Fritz from his small trip into the past, and he realized the sun has long since set. Poor Margarethe, she cooked for him and even had to call him! With a last look to the sky, he got up from his chair, and from the creaks in his bones he could have sworn it was an airplane taking off: his legs were starting to fail him like an old engine. He turned his back to the window and left, but he knew a part of him was still there, staring at the sky."

speermilitary.22.desc:0 "For the entire Wehrmacht, but the Heer more than all others, the Bürgerkrieg was like a scythe wielded by death itself, decimating simple soldiers and officers alike as the fighting degenerated in house-to-house combat, where the entirety of Germany was the frontline, and the command tent was a place like any other to fight and die. The following period wasn't any kinder to the Oberkommando der Heer, as many disloyal, corrupt or incapable officers were systematically purged, leaving a large hole in the officer corps.\n\nHowever, from problems come opportunities, and von Tresckow knew this very well. The Prussian general spent the years of the reconstruction not only reforming the army doctrines and structural organization, but also training the new generation of officers, to ensure they wouldn't follow in their predecessors' footsteps. One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of the Offizierschule des Heeres in Dresden: staffed by the best remaining military theorists, the new institution was made so that cadets from the entire Reich could learn the new doctrines of war in a suitable environment. Of course, said "environment" would be filled with references to the Prussian discipline and the reformist ideas...\n\nDespite the ideological issues, however, no one can deny that the Offizierschule has done an excellent work. The end of the first training cycle, and the subsequent ceremony in which the young cadets took their rank as full-fledged officers of the Heer, marks a new beginning for the armed forces of the Reich: we can only pray that these new generals and lieutenants will prove worthier than their predecessors, and able to keep the Wehrmacht from descending once more into decadence."

Albert Speer looked at him sternly, Henning von Tresckow standing at his side, his back rigid and a slightly offended expression on his face. The admiral advanced to the desk and stopped, saluting the Führer as protocol demanded even though his demeanor made it clear he would have wanted someone else on that chair.\n\n"Admiral Dönitz," Speer began, his voice severe, "I have called you here for an important matter regarding your conduct during the civil war."\n\nThe old admiral knew it was coming, so he steeled himself for what was to come. "I'm ready to take my punishment if it is needed," he answered with a calm, resigned voice.\n\n"During the civil war, it has been proved beyond doubt that you took Bormann's side. Not only that, but you also fled the country during the chaos, taking the majority of the Kriegsmarine with you, disobeying all orders to fight and finding refuge in Crimea."\n\n"I did that to save the Kriegsmarine!" was the immediate answer, but what came next surprised him.\n\n"I know that, admiral, and through your action, you saved many ships which would have been lost, or even worse, used against us. For this reason, von Tresckow and I came to an agreed and fitting solution."\n\nA barely audible snort told the admiral that the "agreement" was mostly on one side, but he focused his attention back on Speer.\n\n"For betraying the Reich and fleeing, you will be stripped of your rank as admiral, and formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty. For saving the majority of the Kriegsmarine from certain destruction or capture, you shall be graced, and your decorations will not be revoked."\n\nThe now-former admiral felt a pang in his heart knowing that his service was over in such a way, but he knew it could have been much worse.

After the end of the war, the admiral surrendered himself when threatened with retaliation from the new government in Germania. His hopes of keeping his rank were shattered a few months later, when he was formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty, and tried together with several SS members and generals who followed either Göring or Bormann.\n\nWhen the day of the verdict came, Dönitz stood with the other defendants in the courtroom. The judges entered the room, one by one, and then read the final sentence: the admiral didn't listen what had been decided for the others, though the amount of screams and cries told him that convictions were far more than acquittals. Finally, it was his turn, and it took all he had not to join the rest of the accused in their screams: "The court declares Karl Dönitz, chief admiral of the Kriegsmarine, culprit of treason and dereliction of duty, and for this he is sentenced to be stripped of all his ranks and decorations, and to thirty years of detention."\n\nAs the guards stripped him of the signs of his rank, he didn't protest, and when they brought him away in handcuffs, he didn't even try to resist.

At the given signal, the combined might of the Wehrmacht was unleashed upon the unfortunate earth mound.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine opened fire upon the enemy positions, neutralizing anti-air batteries and grievously damaging several other emplacements. Immediately after, bombers from the Luftwaffe dropped their deadly cargo upon the trenches, anti-tank cannons and machine guns, clearing the way for the Heer. Tanks rolled towards their target, and infantry both motorized and on foot followed in their wake to occupy the objective. Thanks to the radio coordination, there were no instances of friendly fire, and the entire operation was declared a success.\n\nFor the entire time, Henning von Tresckow looked with a satisfied expression at the scene unfolding a few hundred meters from his command tent. Several other members of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht - generals, aviators and even a couple Kriegsmarine officers - were present, all murmuring their approval for how the army reforms were having their desired effect.

When he had enlisted, he had expected to go somewhere interesting, somewhere exciting. Sure, the island was beautiful and relatively safe, but you don't join the army to relax on the beach.\n\nFriedrich grumbled to himself as he undid the top button of his uniform, hoping none of the other men on guard duty would notice him letting his neck breathe a bit. The heat would have been lovely and quite welcome if he weren't carrying so much equipment, not to mention his uniform's thick fabric and long sleeves. He glanced down to the water, longing to be able to kick his boots off and dive in. That way at least some joy would come of this assignment. The rations were stale, the barracks were derelict, and the port was empty naught for its meagre garrison and the steady flow of more and more vessels docking there.\n\nA hand tapped Friedrich on the shoulder, startling him enough that he nearly tumbled into the water. Flailing his arms about, he just barely managed to grip and brace himself against a post before he could get a rather twisted fulfillment of his earlier wish. Staggering back to his feet, he turned to see his old friend Konrad standing in his naval uniform, a smug grin plastered on his face as he helped Friedrich up. "Scared the hell out of me, what are you doing here?" Said Friedrich, adjusting his helmet.\n\n"My sub just pulled in on the other side.

Attempting in vain to clear his head enough to tell what was going on, he gave a cursory glance toward the rest of the barracks where his squadmates seemed to be getting ready to head out.\n\nFriedrich staggered out of bed and began hastily throwing his uniform on. It seemed they were off to attend an announcement in person by Major Dietrich, the man in charge of the Mauritius garrison. After a hectic few minutes of prep, the men filed out of their barracks to see the Major.\n\nThe Major stood awaiting them on the docks, a stern expression locked on his face while he tapped a nervous foot. Once the men were all in order, he began to speak, "Gentlemen, as you all must have noticed, our numbers are swelling and the base is under increasing construction. This radical defensive development is of utmost importance and will not stop soon, as we have been handed down direct orders from the Führer. We have been tasked with the defence of missile silos soon to be placed on the island. I know many of you may be afraid, but we have all sworn to do our duty, and as sons of the Reich we will do so gladly..."\n\nThe Major's words began to fade away into white noise as Friedrich was plunged into a quiet panic. Despite trying to keep a stiff upper lip, his concerns pounced toward worst case scenarios - incidents, counter attacks, or God forbid: Nuclear war. His imagination ran loose as he pictured his younger siblings and mother scrambling for shelter as missiles fell over Germania or himself fending off scores of Japanese soldiers as machine guns and minefields turn the pearly white beaches into a charnel house.

Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt had shown eagerness at the prospect of reaching out to the Americans. The letter was good - stately but not too domineering, eloquent but not flowery. The letter was not the question. The Americans may have sent arms back when he was directing mobs of students, but now he was at the helm of the ship, who knew what they would want? "I'm sure I don't need to impress upon you the importance of this summit."\n\n"You don't. The Americans want things to cool down just as much as we do. They'll have their demands, but I don't think they'll be unreasonable with our country's history of walking out of negotiations."

SPEERUSA.5.t:0 "Americans Say Yes"
SPEERUSA.5.desc:0 "Helmut had held the letter in front of him as though it were a trophy, and perhaps it was - but it was also a great challenge. Still, Schmidt was a capable man. "Excellent work, Helmut." The other members of cabinet gave the Foreign Minister a polite round of applause. Stifled coughs interrupted the backslapping, an unavoidable consequence of Schmidt's ashtray filled with cigarettes, along with Erhard's seemingly endless cigar. Speer waved his hand at a secretary who scrambled to open a window.\n\n"Where do you intend to hold this meeting?"\n\n"I imagine there'll be some back and forth about that. Somewhere neutral would be preferred, if such a place even exists these days. Iceland perhaps, though if we push we could get them to visit Hamburg. It didn't come out of the war too badly."\n\nAlbert suppressed the urge to mention the obvious fact that it was also Schmidt's home. He supposed the man could be excused a moment of vanity - capable as Schmidt was, Speer had been uncertain of his ability to achieve this meeting. There had always seemed to be something the man had been holding back, however - some fire in his eyes. Perhaps this was his chance to show it.\n\n"Then I wish you luck with the Americans. No doubt you shall need it." The cabinet gave a polite chuckle."
SPEERUSA.5.a:0 "I do not rely on luck."

SPEERUSA.6.t:0 "Americans Reject"
SPEERUSA.6.desc:0 "Helmut eyed the letter on his desk. It had been delivered to the German consulate in Washington not a day after they had sent their invitation. He steeled himself and reached for his letter opener.\n\nIt was short, curt, to the point. They were not rude, did not even rule the possibility of a future meeting - but it was a no. A particularly definitive no, if he was correctly reading between the lines.\n\nHe dropped the letter and leaned back into his chair, letting out a heavy sigh. This would make things considerably more difficult. If America wouldn't give them a second chance... Scheiße."
SPEERUSA.6.a:0 "How am I going to explain this to Speer?"

SPEERUSA.7.t:0 "Let's Do This"
SPEERUSA.7.desc:0 "Helmut's long awaited moment had arrived. He leaned against the balcony and gazed over the lights of the city. Not a bad view, and certainly a welcome change from Berlin's - Germania's, he mentally corrected himself - progressively more ugly skyline.\n\nThis place might not have been the Führer's first choice for their summit, but Schmidt had managed to persuade him of the sense of the location without saying too much of the true reason. Speer would have wanted them brought straight to Germania to see his Volkshalle - the Führer thought himself a humble man but how he could stand to see that bulging growth of national arrogance every day, Helmut could not understand. The Americans would not like it, as much as they loved their monuments. Plus, it was fucking freezing in there.\n\nThe door opened behind him. The Reichsminister turned and gave a nod before the messenger could speak - the Americans had arrived. Helmut ground his cigarette into the ashtray that rested on the windowsill. It certainly was an amazing view. The lights of the old city, uncorrupted by the colossal yet crumbling architecture that seemed to define their Reich's recent history. He turned to the door as the voices began to carry up the corridor, reached into his jacket, and pulled out another cigarette."

The press is already there, God bless them, with the whole scene being filmed and broadcasted across the English and German speaking worlds. Out of the convoy, men in fine suits and ties smile for the cameras and enter into the hall.\n\nNervous energy buzzes around the room as the greatest diplomatic minds of the OFN and the Pakt sit opposite each other in the centre of the hall. Navigating the outskirts of the room, journalists take notes and official photographers snap the occasional picture. In the centre of the Pakt's delegation, a man puts out his cigarette and adjusts his tie, neatening his clothing to match his perfectly combed, greying-brown hair.

SPEERUSA.10.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as an agreement was struck between the OFN and the Pakt regarding nuclear proliferation. A downscaling in Germania's nuclear arsenal was agreed to in exchange for the United States beginning to scale down, and perhaps end, the embargo presently surrounding the Reich. Peace on the continent was the point of the embargo, after all, and with this agreeable new Reich entering the world stage, it seems unfair to continue the chokehold on them."
SPEERUSA.10.a:0 "They've changed, right?"

SPEERUSA.11.t:0 "Human Rights Treaty"
SPEERUSA.11.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as the Pakt has agreed to introduce new rights for their slave population. A charter will be drawn in the coming months for a full list of human rights to be phased into the Reich's government, drawing inspiration from those that American citizens already enjoy. Talks began about perhaps expanding this to an international agreement on the subject, but for now, Germania will retain mastery of this legislation. In return, the United States agrees to reduce the embargo surrounding the Reich. The immorality of National Socialism was the point of the embargo, after all, and with a more liberal Reich making these first steps, it seems unfair to continue punishment for old crimes."

SPEERUSA.12.t:0 "Germany Agrees to an America First Policy"
SPEERUSA.12.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as the Pakt has allowed the United States exclusive rights in trade as part of a new 'America First' policy. To bring the two nations closer together economically and symbolically, the United States will have first choice of exports and preference over other nations in the goods produced by Germany. In return, the United States agrees to move to ending the embargo surrounding the Reich. Sometimes, the economic opportunities provided in trade must be considered above mere political ideals, and with a new business partner extending an olive branch, it seems irrational to continue such a destructive policy."
SPEERUSA.12.a:0 "Money talks."

SPEERUSA.13.t:0 "America First and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.13.desc:0 "A major breakthrough in the negotiations today, with the Pakt agreeing both to exclusive trade rights for the United States and the introduction of a human rights charter into their legislation. America will now get first choice of German exports, while the large slave population will enjoy new freedoms based on those that the American citizenry already enjoy. In return, the United States agrees to loosen and eventually end the embargo surrounding the Reich. With both an economic agreement and an impactful reform promised by the Reich, the United States would be both fiscally irresponsible and morally destitute to continue the destructive trade blockade."

SPEERUSA.17.t:0 "Germany Says No To Everything"
SPEERUSA.17.desc:0 "The Germans seemed quite eager to talk about American concessions, but when it came time to talk about what Germany would be willing to concede, they became mute.

SPEERUSA.19.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction"
SPEERUSA.19.desc:0 "In order to earn the favour of the United States, we have agreed to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal. While we of course wouldn't mention it to the Americans, our stockpile is more than large enough that decommissioning a portion of them is not really a major hit to the Reich's geopolitical strength. And though we are hardly naive enough to believe this could ever lead to the total erasure of the threat of global nuclear destruction, this move is absolutely a small step in the right direction.\n\nAnd, arguably more importantly, we are hoping that this significant goodwill gesture will be enough to persuade the Americans to restore full diplomatic relations and to end the embargo between the US and the Reich. We have refused the Americans' other two major demands, but even this relatively smaller undertaking is causing a humongous uproar among the military high command. It'd be nice if the idiots in the OKH were able to realize that engaging in diplomacy such as this de-necessitates the use of their fancy nuclear toys in the first place, but regardless this move is what's best for Germany so we will not heed their inane screeching."
SPEERUSA.19.a:0 "If we'd known nukes were such valuable bargaining chips, we'd have made more of them!"

SPEERUSA.20.t:0 "Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.20.desc:0 "While the most dedicated Nazis and hardcore social conservatives are likely to fearmonger about the potential slippery slope it causes, we have agreed to give the millions of slaves across the Reich a degree of human rights. To those in our administration who oppose slavery for economic reasons, moral reasons, or both, this concession is actually a major relief; because it is a move for the purpose of lifting the trade embargo between ourselves and the United States, those who would disapprove of our decision will be convinced it is purely for pragmatic purposes.\n\nConsidering America's own tumultuous recent history with slavery, we hope that this considerable change in policy will be enough to persuade them that we are worthwhile and ethical partners. Whether or not that is the truth is irrelevant as long as the Americans see us in that light, of course."
SPEERUSA.20.a:0 "Surely Germany will now be a paragon of morality."

SPEERUSA.21.t:0 "America First"
SPEERUSA.21.desc:0 "Let's be realistic. Outside of the Reich, who does Germany even have strong relations with these days? No one in the Sphere, the OFN, or Russia. South America? Not really. If we want to form strong economic ties with one of the world's foremost economies, it is hardly much of a sacrifice to guarantee the Americans first dibs on the bounty of products and services the Reich has to offer. This move will certainly make a restoration of trade much more enticing to the Americans, as it will undoubtedly be a huge boon for their economy and development. As it would be for ours as well.\n\nHopefully, this economic offer is enough to satisfy them, as we are effectively refusing their other two (political and ethical) offers. It's not like the US is a perfectly moral actor themselves, so who are they to judge anyway?"
SPEERUSA.21.a:0 "They probably care more about their imports than our slaves."

SPEERUSA.22.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and America First"
SPEERUSA.22.desc:0 "We have decided to give in to two of the three major American demands: we will somewhat reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile, and will grant the United States unmitigated priority trade access to the many goods produced in the Reich. While we have denied the request to grant our substantial slave population a greater degree of rights, these other two concessions will hopefully not be as potentially harmful to our social fabric and popularity. Of course, we are still experiencing a large amount of hostility from our military and from our few diplomats to non-OFN countries.\n\nHowever, these sacrifices will ultimately be worth the heavy price, as the economic and geopolitical opportunities which would open up to the Reich if the Americans agree would be monumental. Therefore, we are simply awaiting the American response to our most gracious compromise."
SPEERUSA.22.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.23.t:0 "Slave Rights and America First"
SPEERUSA.23.desc:0 "In what is correctly being considered to be a very large concession, we have decided to agree to the American demands to grant limited rights to the millions of slaves working in the Reich, and to give the Americans priority trade access to all of our goods. Due to other geopolitical considerations, we have refused their third demand to reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile. Still, there is likely to be major opposition from the most ideological members of the party and the Reich at large, though we don't have much of a choice.\n\nWe chose to make these concessions because the benefits are predicted to outweigh the social costs; we must engage in more trade if we ever want our economy to recover! Let us hope that these policies are enough to persuade the Americans to engage with us, as we would be rather hard pressed to concede anything more. This is for the good of the Reich, and so it must be enough."
SPEERUSA.23.a:0 "A necessary trade-off."

SPEERUSA.24.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.24.desc:0 "In order to appease the Americans, we have agreed to both reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile and grant limited rights to the millions of slaves existing within our borders. While we do expect major backlash from both the military and social conservatives respectively, we are fortunate enough that, in the long term, neither of these changes should cause serious harm to the Reich's social fabric or economy (provided we handle them with the utmost care).\n\nBecause of the significant economic gains we would be poised to make in the event the Americans do agree to open up trade with us, such a generous display of good faith will likely outweigh the costs. Additionally, many worrying reports regarding the extent of subversive political groups throughout the Reich suggest that there might even be a subset of our population which is strongly in favour of these reforms. Though that is hardly any consolation, since it is the resistance of people in powerful positions we have to worry about."
SPEERUSA.24.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.25.t:0 "We Have Agreed to All Demands"
SPEERUSA.25.desc:0 "We have accepted all of the American demands, to reduce our nuclear stockpile, to allow American companies first trade rights in our country, and yes, even allowing more rights for the slaves.\n\nIt's not an ideal situation, but nothing is in this world. The hardliners back home are sure to be in an uproar. The only shining light is that the Americans are ecstatic with us, promising an end to the embargo in the coming months."
SPEERUSA.25.a:0 "We have that, at least."

SPEERUSA.26.t:0 "None of Them"
SPEERUSA.26.desc:0 "The Americans pushed and pushed, and then act upset when we lash back. We will not accept these demands from a once defeated enemy. The Reich is prouder then that, better then that. Now that we have made clear that we will not accept these outrageous demands, they have become mute. Refusing to communicate with us effectively. These talks are soon to become a joke if nothing can be done."

SPEERUSA.27.t:0 "The Accords Are Signed"
SPEERUSA.27.desc:0 "With the final handshake, a few signatures here and there, the Accords are done. Celebration between both delegations was reported late into the night.

SPEERUSA.28.desc:0 "With the signing of the accords, and the start of détente with the Americans, some of the NSDAP and even the public are shocked by some of the things agreed to by the Reich. Speer has been working tirelessly to ensure their fears, and to show them that these concessions to the Americans were necessary for the Reich to not only heal, but to grow from what it was before. He has given speeches from Germania to Frankfurt, praising the Reich's diplomats, and the Americans for understanding the need for friendship. Soon, he says, all Germans will have their lives improved with the end of the American embargo."
SPEERUSA.28.a:0 "We can only hope."

SPEERUSA.29.t:0 "The City That Never Sleeps"
SPEERUSA.29.desc:0 "Upon arriving in New York City, Schmidt didn't know how to feel. He'd never seen a city like this before. It was cluttered with countless tall, imposing, and- frankly- ugly buildings that left a unique and indescribable impression which could be felt nowhere else on Earth. What was it? This city was so foreboding and yet so utterly charming. Why couldn't a single German city produce this sort of emotion in its architecture? It made Schmidt want to explore!\n\nUnfortunately, reality got in the way of Schmidt's daydreaming. An entourage of diplomatic staff awaited him, and Schmidt was stuck shaking their hands and exchanging pleasantries for what seemed like an eternity. But, Schmidt reminded himself, restarting relations with the United States was of the utmost importance and would lead to the betterment of living conditions for all of humanity. So of course, Schmidt buttered up every last staffer as much as he could without brown nosing, and even managed to engage in some legitimately friendly and amicable conversations. Hell, he even managed to crack a few well-received jokes. But once all of that babble was said and done came the sightseeing.\n\nNaturally, there was beautiful Central Park, flashy Times Square, the monumental Empire State Building, and of course, Lady Liberty herself (admittedly not as large as expected from a distance but still symbolically powerful). Interestingly, Schmidt at one point passed through a neighbourhood called Greenwich Village, apparently home to people and activities his colleagues considered "degenerate," though Schmidt never understood how people's private business bothered others. All in all, Schmidt had rarely had a more exciting day and was completely enthralled by NYC's alluring atmosphere."
SPEERUSA.29.a:0 "New York, New York: A hell of a town!"

SPEERUSA.30.t:0 "The City of Angels"
SPEERUSA.30.desc:0 "As the Luftwaffe VIP plane began its descent, Schmidt couldn't help experiencing a mixed range of feelings upon viewing Los Angeles's skyline. While it was no doubt impressive, it seemed as if it were a work of progress that had stalled and stunted over a decade ago. The abundance of military installations and vehicles surrounding the city's harbour reminded Schmidt that the Japanese occupation of the US's major West Coast Ports had likely crippled the region's industry and thus the growth of what was once the most impressive city on the entire Pacific Ocean. Of course, it wasn't like the Reich was in much better shape after its own self-imposed economic downturn and the Bürgerkrieg. "More lives being ruined by fascism. What's new?" Schmidt thought to himself. But voicing such opinions aloud would be just as damaging to his mission here as it would be to his career (and no doubt his life) back home.\n\nMuch more concerning than the quality of L.A.'s skyline was the quality of Schmidt's reception, consisting of some random, nameless bureaucrats whose names Schmidt begrudgingly decided he would eventually learn anyway for the sake of making a good impression. After enough obligatory handshakes and small talk to drive even the most shallow of aristocrats to madness, Schmidt was finally able to do some sightseeing. There was the lively Santa Monica Pier with an ocean view unrivalled anywhere in the continental Reich, the both elegant and exciting Griffith Observatory, from which Schmidt could see the famous Hollywood sign in need of repair, and the excessive Venice Canals and all sorts of other wonderful, if slightly tacky, attractions.\n\nThe bounty of interesting sights was partially marred by Schmidt's necessary security detail, but what really bothered Schmidt was the lack of opportunity to gain a real and honest understanding of how the American people lived day to day. How else could he truly understand what sort of provisions the Americans would surely want in the re-establishment of relations? And, unlike his colleagues, perhaps Schmidt actually gave a damn about the lives of non-Aryan human beings. Oh well."
SPEERUSA.30.a:0 "No time to worry about that now. Off we go!"

SPEERUSA.31.t:0 "Schmidt in the White House"
SPEERUSA.31.desc:0 "It was just a brief and simple event, and largely for the sake of the press anyways, but that didn't mean it wasn't overwhelmingly important. Yet, as he entered the stately White House grounds, Schmidt couldn't carry himself solemnly. He deserved to be jovial in front of the US president and the press. This signing was his success, and more importantly, a success for the downtrodden citizens of the Reich and the United States. Why shouldn't he appear to be happy on the outside, since that was exactly how he felt on the inside?\n\nCracking a gentle smile, Schmidt shook hands with the president amidst the flashing of the journalists' cameras, and together they walked along the North Lawn and up the steps beneath the building's facade. The president approached a podium standing on the porch and gave a rather run-of-the-mill speech regarding the value and necessity of the deal which was about to be officially signed. Then it was Schmidt's turn.\n\n"Don't worry, I'll keep this very short. We are here today because we have finally realized that we should stop shooting ourselves in the foot, and that it is better for us to cooperate. I assure all of you that some of our previous administration's, so to speak, policies which some might have found a little unsavoury are in many instances unlikely to continue in the same fashion as they have for the last several years. I believe that this is a period of drastic change, and just as today is unrecognizable to the world of 25 years ago, the world 25 years from now will be unrecognizable to us today. And so, we absolutely must ensure that our future is one of prosperity and cooperation, and of a higher quality of life for all of our citizens. This treaty is an excellent first step. Thank you very much.""

Though the détente has panned out headspinningly quickly, we of course arranged for Mr. Schmidt to meet with the president for dinner at the White House.\n\nMinister Schmidt was incredibly polite and even jovial, and had little trouble easing any perceived tension between his and our envoys. Apparently a joke of his even cracked a laugh out of the president, which if true would do much to alleviate the pervasive stereotype that all Germans are humourless.\n\nSchmidt and the president stood before the White House's North Lawn and all of the press to officially sign the document ending the embargo between Germany and the US. May God bless the United States of America, and may God bless our new... partners... the German Reich."

SPEERUSA.33.desc:0 ""Mr. Dowling, a pleasure. I hope you find our country to your liking."

"The United States is eager for our parties to come to an agreement for our mutual benefit."\n\nSchmidt smirked behind his face. Off guard and backfooted was how they needed them - diplomats could be so predictable when they fell back on their instructions. Of course he wouldn't have organised this meeting without having planned every moment himself. The issue was too important to be delegated. He gestured to the vast Mercedes-Benz that waited to shepherd them away, shining a glossy black from windows to tyres.\n\n"Of course, of course, but first you must see the sights. Hamburg is a truly beautiful place.""
SPEERUSA.33.a:0 "Hamburg's canals are one of the loveliest sights in Germany."

SPEERUSA.34.t:0 "The Canals"
SPEERUSA.34.desc:0 ""In fact, Hamburg has more bridges than any other city in the world!" Schmidt had seemed laid back at their first meeting, but now that they toured his home town the man had lit up. He gestured grandly at yet another stately bridge arcing across the canal. Walter Dowling was the first ambassador to Germany since 1941 - in fact he was the first American to legally set foot on Reich soil in more than twenty years. They walked together, their staff about thirty feet behind. No doubt they were conducting their own diplomacy behind the scenes, while Schmidt and Dowling did their best to ignore the cameras strategically posed above them.\n\n"It sure is a fine place." Walter admitted. It may not have the great skyscrapers of New York, but the place had its own, subtler history. The great city hall overlooking the Alster, the towering cathedral spire, these charming canals - he knew he was being wooed, but damn if Schmidt didn't know how to do it.\n\nThey turned a corner, slowing to allow the lackeys to catch up. Schmidt reached into his pocket and pulled out one of those seemingly ever-present cigarettes. He offered one to Walter who shook his head - half the charm of the open city was its clean air, and he already had a splitting headache from the morning spent locked up in that smokehouse of an office with the Reichsminister. Walter turned to examine the brickwork, and came to face something he never thought he would see. He did his best to conceal his strangled gasp as a cough, only half succeeding - Schmidt turned to view the line of bullet holes in the wall, the discarded rubbish that littered its base, and the bare earth turned to mud that formed a long stain stretching into the canal.

SPEERUSA.35.t:0 "The Gardens"
SPEERUSA.35.desc:0 "One of the most touching moments of the visit was when the delegation visited the restored Tropengewächshäuser, Hamburg's botanical garden. A painstaking effort had been made to bring them to their former beauty: old photos had been retrieved, and from them a team of experts had acquired the original plants and flowers from their exotic homes, and rebuilt the pavilions and paths scattered across what was once a place of peace and tranquility. Just like that garden - that was the message Reichsminister Schmidt was trying to convey - the entire Reich would slowly become a better place for everyone.\n\nEven though the plants were still very young, and the grass still had to cover all the new flowerbeds, the American delegation was impressed by the effort. That is, until a diplomat stumbled upon a small earth mound while exploring a more secluded part of the garden, dislodging a few stones and revealing what was buried right below.\n\nAt first, Helmut Schmidt was annoyed by the commotion, but as soon as he turned away from his conversation with the ambassador, any trace of mirth disappeared from his face along with its color: barely hidden under a thin layer of earth and stones, was a human arm, its decomposed flesh barely covered by a tattered uniform, dried blood stains still visible on the discolored fabric. The workers were called, and they soon started digging: the first corpse was carefully set on the side of the hole, but immediately under it, another appeared, and another, and another. Despite all the prayers running through Schmidt's mind, they didn't stop.\n\nAs the sun started setting, one hundred and fifty-eight bodies clad in military uniform had been unearthed, and now the entire American delegation was turned towards the pale, heavily-sweating ghost of what was once Helmut Schmidt. The ambassador looked at him sternly, and his words felt steel-cold to the Minister, like an executioner's blade on his victim's neck: "Explain this, Mr. Schmidt. Now." and the answer he received was..."

Upstanding German citizens had transformed the Emperor's Hall into a magnificent dining room, and the tables were set for a great roast dinner, with plenty of drink on the sides. The Krauts and Americans began with a great conversation on cultural comparisons and personal anecdotes, but stalled for a good half an hour as the head of the delegation and the Führer himself engaged in a fierce argument over the differences between capitalism and National Socialism. After some time, the foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt, stood up and managed to reconcile the opposing interlocutors.\n\nEven if Herr Speer and the delegation may not see eye-to-eye, Schmidt showed that there is some democratic and liberal spirit thriving underneath the Reich. The reports back home to Washington that night were ample in praise for the regime in Germania. Truly, the Reich is a land of wise men, great artists, and certainly delicious meals."

He stood and held it up to Schmidt's eyes. A high heeled shoe, stained a muddy red. For the first time in a long time Schmidt stumbled on his words - his mouth curled in an ugly expression before he sighed and flicked his cigarette into the canal.\n\n"There was much collateral damage. While the students may have been some of our Führer's most ardent supporters, they were... overzealous.\n\nDowling scowled and dropped the shoe.

Then, the militias launched a pincer manoeuver near the university, along the Grinderallee, forcing the enemy to retreat under heavy fire: while most managed to leave, a group of around two hundreds SS took refuge in the botanical garden, but in the end they all either died fighting, or committed suicide.\n\n"I beg you, try to imagine how this beautiful city was after the attack" the Reichsminister pleaded as his audience listened, "Ten thousand civilians had been murdered, the hospitals were full of wounded, the university had been turned into an emergency infirmary, and the obituaries were exploding with bodies so much that we had to store them in the market square: hundreds of innocents and loved ones piled like sandbags, waiting for their turn to be buried without a funeral!" Finally, he looked at the lined corpses with tear-filled eyes, and no one could truly understand whether they were the practiced trick of an expert diplomat, or if one of those "sandbags" after the battle had been someone he knew. "We couldn't bury them. There was no place in the cemeteries, not even for our own people. Sad as it may be, they were buried here not out of cruelty, but to avoid the spread of infection."\n\nAfter a minute of silence, the American ambassador hugged the Minister, expressing his sympathy for the population of this wounded land, and asked him if he was still able to continue the negotiations. Visibly relieved, Schmidt nodded, and they left this small piece of a horrible past behind."

Dowling is subtly suggesting the Reich as it is now would never be able to stand the test of time, and though Helmut agrees in his heart, he can't help but think his duty was to defend the Führer's work: Speer may be an asshole sometimes, and block his reforms with stale concepts such as "moderation" and "not risking another civil war" but openly criticizing him? He wouldn't be so undiplomatic do such a thing in front of a foreign delegation!\n\nAs he takes the wine in his hand, he knows he has to make a choice: counter Dowling's subtle accusations, or divert the course of the conversation?"

SPEERUSA.51.desc:0 "The murmuring Americans hinted to Schmidt that expectations were not particularly high. They assumed the festival would consist largely of dull propaganda informing them of Aryan racial supremacy and the glory of the Reich's many military conquests. Luckily, Schmidt had foreseen that issue, and had twisted the arms of the Propaganda Ministry to ensure that only a selection of the Reich's many entertainment and artistic films were chosen for the Americans' viewing. Convincing Speer that impressing the Americans with enjoyable films was more pragmatic than angering them with propaganda was not very difficult.\n\nAnd indeed, the reactions Schmidt distinguished indicated that Das deutsche Filmfestival in Hollywood was at least a mild success. By far the most popular work shown was an ambitious remake of the hit 1942 drama Die große Liebe; its message was subtly shifted from one of commitment to war to being anti-war, but what really caused it to stand out was its new star: renowned comedy actor Heinz Rühmann, demonstrating his versatile acting abilities portraying Paul, the romantic lead. Schmidt overheard plenty of positive comments and perhaps, even, a few sniffles?\n\nIt was hard to say if a few flicks would really help restore a positive relationship between the US and the Reich, but it certainly didn't seem to hurt!"

But Schmidt did not care to attend the airshow, as he didn't wish to be reminded of his time at the Ministry of Aviation; after all, didn't he effectively have a hand in those terror bombings? No, he wouldn't think about it. The sooner Schmidt's diplomatic endeavours succeeded, the sooner Germany could be rid of Nazism, which was all that mattered now as far as he was concerned.\n\nFrom what Schmidt had heard from one of his envoys, the airshow had been another mild success, with the Luftwaffe squadron impressing the Americans with a variety of formations, maneuvers, and one particularly sharp turn that apparently caused a great number of gasps. Well, as long as all of these goodwill gestures were appreciated by the Americans, Schmidt had nothing to worry about.

The crowning of Reichsminister Schmidt's efforts finally comes in an official communique from the American ambassador in Germania: with a great fair being planned in Boston, not only has the Reich been invited, but an entire pavilion has been reserved for its exclusive use!\n\nImmediately, the news is broadcasted nationwide, and an inter-ministerial committee is immediately appointed to oversee the preparations: with the complexity of such an affair, it's only natural that the ministries for the economic, diplomatic and internal affairs work together to ensure the fair turns into a success. The Führer's open blessing to this endeavor underlines once more how much sway does the Gang of Four hold over the German government...\n\nAt the committee's first meeting, after a first opening message by Albert Speer, in which he encourages its members to "amaze the world with the Reich's greatness", everyone starts working in earnest. As soon as the first folders are opened, already an important question arises, one which will influence all future works: what kind of event will the fair be?\n\nSome wish to create a reduced version of World Fair on the model of the great 1937 Paris fair, where the German pavilion towered over all others; members from the ministry of research propose a technological fair, where the greatest progresses of our scientists and inventors can be put on display for the world to look in envy; finally, more than a few voice their support for a very peculiar idea, which is a cultural fair: rather than showing industrial or technological progresses, how about showing the world that which makes our country unique?

Architects and artists from the Reich's most prestigious faculties and circles are called to design the pavillon, and the tycoons are already in line to have their work showcased.\n\nAs the first lines are drawn, however, a sore point immediately stands out: we are going to have an exposition in a country we fought, and defeated, a mere twenty years ago, and there are many who would strongly oppose all our government stands for; should we try to create a "neutral ground" for the fair, removing all symbols of our regime - especially the swastikas - or should we show the world what we truly are?\n\nOf course, the conservatives are outraged that such a thing is even being discussed: we are a National Socialist nation, and Hitler's guidance was what brought us from a defeated nation, to the world's greatest empire! Denying our legacy is a crime against those who lost their lives to make the Vaterland great!\n\nOn the contrary, reformist members, especially those aligned with Schmidt and Erhard, fear that the sight of a banner with the swastika might scare off American investors, and draw heavy criticism from the political establishment, compromising the fair's success: as such, they vocally ask to "tune down" on the symbols of what may be our political ideology, but risks hurting the feelings of our hosts.\n\nAs the discussion doesn't seem to end, the chairman sighs and calls for a vote on the issue: "those who are in favor of removing all political symbols, please raise their right hand!" and the result is..."

As they point out to their colleagues, we are being hosted by a nation we fought with those exact weapons a mere twenty years ago: surely, their veteran associations and the conservative political establishment would strongly disapprove, or even boycott the fair!\n\nWhile some agree with this train of thought, others stand up, and reply that our new discoveries in the military field are extremely important, and will surely amaze the world! We won the world not thanks to poorly-armed conscripts, but with technological excellency and constant improvement!\n\nAs the discussion keeps going on, the committee head calls a vote to settle the matter once and for all: after the hands are counted, the fair will..."

The building itself fills with color as a variegated crowd enters the offices to vie for patronage: woodcarvers with their finest creations, patissiers bribing the members with an enticing offering of pastries and receipts passed from generation to generation, and even a choir in their traditional attire singing outside the office! The committee headquarters shine as it becomes, just for a few days, a melting pot of German culture.\n\nAs time passes, however, an issue arises. This time, however, the line of division isn't drawn between reformists and conservatives, but between "alcoholics" and "sanctimonious prudes" as they have started calling each other: as hundreds of beer distilleries have offered to sponsor the event, and many of them have asked to have their stands and stalls all throughout the exhibition, there is the question about whether to officially endorse the beer companies or keep the fair family-friendly.\n\nThe committee chairman calls for a vote on the matter, not before finishing his beer though..."

The Amerikaner felt welcomed by the elaborately-decorated building, especially since, with the sole exception of the official flag of the Reich present here and there - the only point the Führer was adamant about - it was devoid of any national socialist symbol. The worries of the Gang of Four proved correct: without anything to criticize, the hawks within the American government were silenced, and everyone enjoyed the fair without any kind of polemic.\n\nWith the resounding success of the event spreading like a wildfire throughout the Vaterland, the reformists acquire even more power within the government, something which irks the Führer more than a bit. In the end, however, he knows this will benefit the Reich, and he'll be the one to ultimately reap the fruits of their efforts, so for the moment he has decided to keep his grumblings to himself, and influence the work of the Four with a lighter tough, as any true ruler knows how to do."

This moment was not to be taken lightly.\n\nSmall talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because he simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever.\n\nLater, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany.

So, he accepts another glass of wine from the server, and they discuss the pros and cons of Alsatian and Bavarian wines compared to the omnipresent Italian ones, especially now that the entirety of Northern France no longer produces anything worth of note.\n\nThe evening soon turns into night, as the two parties socialize more and more, passing from topic to topic with a spontaneity that is almost unbefitting of seasoned diplomats, but with enough wine, everyone becomes a good friend! As the last desserts are finished, and the waiters begin clearing out the table from the used cutlery, everyone gets up, and all shake their hands before the Americans return to their diplomatic quarters.\n\nA second before boarding the car, Walter Dowling looks seriously at Schmidt: "I know what you are trying to do for your country, Helmut" he begins, opting for once to let go of diplomatic platitudes: "The United States are still unsure about how to truly consider your Führer, whether a true reformer or simply an astute liar, but as long as you are part of his government, I am willing to believe that this country can truly find a way to prosperity after what it has suffered.

SPEERUSA.67.desc:0 ""Adolf Hitler was, shall I say, not the most popular figure outside of the Greater Reich, mein Führer."\n"Your point being, Herr Schmidt?" asked Speer.\n"Well, mein Führer, I was thinking it might be a prudent move for our administration to... distance ourselves from him. It'd be wise to demonstrate that we are no longer seeking the brutal conquest which was, of course, a cornerstone of Führer Hitler's foreign policy, you see."\nAn awkward pause lapsed as Speer considered Schmidt's borderline treasonous suggestion. He chewed on the idea for several moments before nodding to himself and saying, "I...can see how doing so would be beneficial to our diplomatic efforts, and it might even improve my personal image abroad..."\n\nSomething about Speer's expression made Schmidt silently ponder how hard it was to even get that sentence out of his chest, not that he would truly voice it.\n\n"...But of course, there will be strong resistance from many people here in Germany, especially the closeted Bormannites. I trust you will help our administration deal with any backlash?"\n"Oh, why of course... mein Führer," replied Schmidt, who seemed to assume a noticeably brighter demeanor."

SPEERUSA.68.t:0 "Death to the Cult of Personality"
SPEERUSA.68.desc:0 ""You are still confident in the positive outcome of our 'Dehitlerization,' Herr Schmidt? We are experiencing substantial opposition," asked the Führer. The sound of angry protestors and even a few "Heil Hitlers" could be heard not far from the Reichstag, which certainly helped to illustrate Speer's skepticism.\n"...Yes. Distancing ourselves from him is absolutely necessary, mein Führer," replied a distant and distracted Schmidt. "Pardon me for a moment, I need to go for a walk." Schmidt gave a timid but respectful salute to Speer and quickly exited the building.\nAs he walked down Adolf-Hitler-Straße and past the Adolf-Hitler-Platz, Schmidt noticed the many lingering signs of war: former soldiers aimlessly walking the street, some with broken or missing limbs and some begging for spare change; a fair deal of unemployed non-veterans, too; and there were even some buildings that had leftover damage from accidental shelling or bombing during the Bürgerkrieg in which so many had sacrificed so much simply for that cunning bastard Speer to enact a slightly less brutal and genocidal version of his predecessor's ideology.\nAdolf Hitler was a man who brought so much unnecessary suffering and destruction to the world. How could the German masses revere him so? Schmidt figured he'd have to emphasize the world's fear and hatred of the man and avoid non-starters like his absurd racial beliefs and genocide. It was a ridiculous and unfair situation, but like always Schmidt would just carry on and make the best of it."

SPEERUSA.69.t:0 "Confrontational Policy"
SPEERUSA.69.desc:0 "As usual, the forty soldiers of the SS garrison were parading in front of the border, only stopping at the exact line dividing the two territories, and Rudolf Niedersen, commander of the Bretten Grenzwacht, looked impotently, as his men were far fewer due to the low budget. Suddenly, a call interrupted his rancorous thoughts: he answered, listened, and not five minutes later his men too were in parade at the sides of the road. The commanding SS looked at the ten watchmen, slightly amused: "Is this everything the mighty Reich can summon against the Righteous?" he spat at his counterpart. Then, the earth began to tremble.\n\nBefore the SS could speak again, a Panzer appeared from behind a building, and moved at full speed towards the border. The black-uniformed soldiers remained still as the tank got closer, closer, CLOSER. When only a few meters separated the armored beast from the soft flesh, Rudolf smiled in glee: the men in black took one step backwards, then two, and then everyone was falling in disorder as the Grenzwacht laughed.\n\nWith a loud noise, the tank halted one meter over the border. The SS returned, indignation etched over his face: "You are trespassing on the Ordensstaat! I demand that-" he stopped when faced with the barrel of Rudolf's pistol. "You hold no authority here, Verräter" he spat, feeling cruel joy in the way the other's face contorted. "This land belongs to the Vaterland, and you are unlawfully occupying it. There are no borders within the Reich, and the traitor you call "master" will soon understand it!"\n\nAs he spoke, several trucks unloaded a hundred Heer soldiers, who immediately set up building fortifications. The watchman looked the SS dead in the eye, and his voice was cold as steel: "It's only a matter of time before we return to Paris. Enjoy your black uniform while you can, for one day you'll hang from a balcony, and I'll be the one to push you DOWN" and for the first time, Rudolf saw fear in the eyes of the SS."

SPEERUSA.70.desc:0 "Siewiller, a small town on the border between the Reichsland of Elsass-Lothringen and the Ordensstaat, had been living in a limbo for over a decade: formally, the lands ruled by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler were integral part of the German Reich just as Germania itself; in truth, however, Siewiller resembled the frontier posts on the border shared with Italy, with around twenty guards at each side staring each other down even though they were all Germans.\n\nIt all changed when an officer from the Reich handed over a letter to his SS counterpart, while several other men positioned roadblocks and trucks unloaded steel and concrete to build border fortifications. The black-uniformed German took the letter and gave it a cursory read: he already knew its content, as it was identical to the speech given by the Führer just the day before, then he put it into his pocket and returned to his position, without any outward sign of either interest or worry. After all, it was nothing but the formal certification of the current state of affairs.\n\n"Citizens of the Reich, today is a sad day for our country. As Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler has refused to cede command and face due trial for his actions during the war which tore our country asunder, he is immediately relieved of any office and is to be arrested on sight for treason and mass murder. The provinces swearing allegiance to him are no longer under our protection, and any contact, trade, supply or transit with the traitors must cease immediately.""

From hunting in the vast woods of northern Maine, to visiting the native-created Etowah Mounds in Georgia, to touring towns, factories, and other landmarks all over the Eastern Seaboard, the Germans have hopefully garnered a much better understanding of American culture and livelihood. We have at the very least given the foreign minister a highly interesting trip, and hopefully the hospitality we've shown to the representatives of our ostensible enemies will bear fruit in the form of improved relations."

SPEERUSA.74.desc:0 "The final stop of his goodwill tour, German Foreign Minister Schmidt has arrived in Washington, D.C. From what we have heard from staffers present with the German delegation, the uncontested highlight of the visit for Mr. Schmidt was his stop at the (admittedly very lovely) Lincoln Memorial.\n\nDespite the supposedly much more impressive works and exhibits of Germania, Schmidt was apparently mesmerized by the statue and stood silently in its presence for several minutes. According to one staffer who was known to embellish his stories, a single teardrop could even be seen in Mr. Schmidt's eye. Either way, he seemed to very much appreciate the memorial and the great American values it stands for."
SPEERUSA.74.a:0 "The Nazi foreign minister admires Lincoln? Probably a good sign."

SPEERUSA.75.t:0 "Schmidt in the Lincoln Memorial"
SPEERUSA.75.desc:0 "This was perhaps the one American landmark Schmidt had seen whose scope even held a candle to the landmarks of Germania. And yet somehow, the Lincoln Memorial put the massive statues and displays of Germany's capital to shame. While the ancient Greek-style building and the huge statue of Abraham Lincoln were by no means simple, the memorial could hardly be considered elaborate or covered in interesting details to examine. But all of the pieces put together- the dimly lit but noble Lincoln sitting pleasantly in his chair, overlooking the steps leading down towards the reflecting pool and the Washington Monument in the distance... it evoked this... feeling inside of Schmidt.\n\nIt was longing. Longing for better days, simpler times, and for leaders with as much honour and integrity as they used to have. No German politician valued liberty (openly) the way Abraham Lincoln did. Why did those in charge today care so damn much about what individuals said or did in the privacy of their own home or in the confidence of loved ones and friends? It was both immensely perplexing and infuriating to Schmidt. And then he realized what he longed for the most: a free and just world.\n\n"Ah yes, because it's that simple and easy... Though I admit the world would be pretty boring if there was nothing I could do to make it a better place." Abraham Lincoln did not reply to Schmidt, but surely he would approve."

In fact, the room was dauntingly empty, with just some security personnel, a few diplomats from both parties, and Schmidt and the American president sitting together at the table.\n\nWhile all of the details of the treaty that would be signed had already been sorted out, Schmidt was understandably still stressed about this evening. This moment was not to be taken lightly.\n\nSmall talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because [USA.GetSheHe] simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever.\n\nLater, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany. "If we can't kill each other, we might as well trade, no?" cracked Schmidt, getting plenty of laughs despite the unfortunate degree of truth buried in the joke."

SPEERUSA.79.t:0 "Schörner's Proposal"
SPEERUSA.79.desc:0 "United States of America was stretched out before them in all its glory. Von Tresckow stood to the left side of the table, his crossed arms betraying the inscrutable expression on his face. Opposite him, Schörner leant over the map, his shadow expanding across the East Coast. He greeted the Führer with a courteous smile that failed to reach his eyes. The two officers saluted in unison with a simultaneous, "Heil!"\n\nSpeer returned the gesture and stared at the map with a furrowed brow. "Let's hear your proposal, Generalfeldmarschall." He trusted the man little, and his military strategies less, but Speer knew better than to deny an audience with a man so influential in the militarist movement.\n\n"My proposal is simple," Schörner boasted, almost dismissively. He waved his hand generally across the land below him. "Warfare is fought in the mind as well as the battlefield. It's one thing to throw empty words at the Jews in the White House; it's quite another to strike true fear into their craven hearts." The hawk jabbed his finger close to the East Coast, and for a fleeting moment Speer thought he was about to argue for a declaration of war against the United States. "We should fly our strategic bombers straight towards internationally recognized American airspace, before turning away at the last moment! True fear will grip the Americans, and their leaders will be on paranoid alert, never knowing when a first strike is truly coming. I call it 'Schwarze Walküre'."\n\n"Herr Speer, this is far too risky!" Von Tresckow shook his head in disbelief. Schörner glared at him with the shards of ice lurking behind his spectacles. "What if our pilots fail to turn away in time? What if the Americans act prematurely?"\n\n"These mongrels slighted the Reich!" Schörner snapped, his spittle spraying across the map. "They're not stupid enough to retaliate, but it will teach them a lesson they won't forget."\n\nSpeer silently rubbed his chin in thought. Fully implementing Schwarze Walküre would be a powerful show of strength, but a test run elsewhere would certainly be safer. Iceland, perhaps?"
SPEERUSA.79.a:0 "We should trial this tactic with Iceland first."

The test was a success, with all missiles succeeding in their launch, accuracy and detonation over the Atlantic Ocean. The fantastic display of Aryan ingenuity was televised to cheering German audiences across the Reich. Germany, as always, remains superior to all in her firepower.\n\nHowever, a second goal was achieved today. Across the Eastern Seaboard, American families cower in front of their televisions, as an equally terrified President addresses the nation.\n\nFrom Berlin, Speer watches the American address, grinning.

The pilot didn't even need to glance, but he did anyway. Yep, a German squadron was still hanging a bit above and behind the strat bombers. At least another dozen pings were picked on the onboard radar up further behind them. Likely, no, definitely above.100% out of sight, but not out of mind.\n\n"Command, I have visual on five escorts, picking up at least another dozen on my radar, over." A pause. A second, than another.

"No running in the hallway!" he announced sternly to the forty or so elementary children. It took more willpower than he cared to admit to not crack a smile as his students let out the barrage of humble sorrys and yes Herrs.\n\nThe day was warm and sunny; it was a beautiful day to play ball. The teacher watched from the sideline, occasionally passing back a ball kicked out of bounds. Johann felt at ease here at school. Although scars maimed his face,, anyone who knew Johann could vouch for his giant heart. Johann was always calm, and tried his hardest to be fair and kind, to great success. Though they wouldn't admit it to his face, his students only sang praise about their teacher to his co-workers and their parents, to Johann's embarrassment. Still, it was welcome praise; the children gave him purpose. Although he had lost his pregnant wife in the civil war, being a mentor to the next generation of Germans gave Johann hope. Here he was, helping to raise a new generation, and he did so with much kindness. In a way, they were his family. He did however envy the children; not having to join a Nazi chapter to have friends or to particapate in the football clubs. They didn't have to know party politics to be able to swim at the local pool, nor they weren't judged by their devotion (or lack of) to Hitler's cult of personality. They could be children. It was a wonderful time to be young, and he was glad that he fought for that.\n\nThe sound of jets roaring overhead nearly made Johann flinch, his reflexes almost taking control over his body, even after all these years. He took a deep breath. He had to stay composed for the children.\n\nJohann looked above, watching yet another airwing soar above his head, heading northwest, likely following the last hundred or so plans that came before that week. Another batch of strategic bombers. Worrying.\n\nAs the children cheered and waved at the soaring planes above, the seed of worry in his head grew more. Why was there so much traffic in the air? Why were they all moving northwest? He pondered as the planes flew out of sight. A ball hit his leg.\n\n"Herr Steiner, can you pass the ball?" A little girl yelled from across the field. He passed the ball, now absent minded, his smile and good mood gone."

Smith muttered.\n\nNo more than a minute passed before the President stormed into the Situation Room with their Secret Service attachment stalking close behind.\n\n"Who has my briefing?" The President barked. Shit. The currently overworked staff simply had no time to compile a folder. "Over here, sir!" Smith called as he rushed frantically from his desk to the map in the middle of the room. The President quickly stalked over to the large table, where tokens representing airplanes stood placed in the North Sea, red marker scrawls noting the planes' previous locations and their intended route; Iceland. Smith paced around the table, clearly nervous. "Sorry sir, we didn't have time to..." The President waved him off. "Forget the paperwork. What's the situation?" "Well sir..."\n\n"Five German strategic bombers, nuclear capable, are en-route to our bases in Iceland. NORAD has been tracking them for twenty minutes; they figured it was a long distance training mission. However, they haven't stopped their approach, and are heading right for our airspace. We've already scrambled an interceptor wing." A pause. "How many German planes total?" the President asked. "Is it a probe? A full scale invasion? Something else?" The Preisdents voice rose. "What the hell is this?" Another tense second passed. "We don't know, sir." Smith replied flatly. "There looks to be twenty-five planes total, including the five bombers. NORAD has no idea what their intent is, but they are REALLY stressing that those planes are nuclear capable. Most of that staff want us to hit them now to prevent a potential bombing. Most of the guys here..." Smith motioned to the ten or so men feverishly plotting routes and making phone calls. "...including myself believe that the Germans are making a show of strength and have no intent on crossing our airspace. We don't think they're trying to start a war. Still, our response is up to you, Mr. President, and I need your decision, now. An operator in Iceland is waiting for an answer."\n\nThe President wordless walked to the nearest desk and dialed a number. The line immediately picked up. "Smith! The fucking Germans are ten minutes out! I need a goddamn answer, now!" Over the line, yelling and the sound of chaos rang in the background. "This is the President..." The line went silent. As if on cue, the background chatter died as if the call was on speaker. The Situation Room mirrored the silence. The President glaced around the room.

Eighteen of the twenty escorts, shot down. No pilots recovered, and no word from the Americans if they rescued any. I don't know what would be better; writing the letters to the families of brave men killed in defense of the Reich, or having to talk to the Americans about returning our men they captured. This is a disaster." The Führer sighed. "What the hell are we going to do?"\n\nSchörner pulled a folder that he had tucked away, and handed it to Speer. The Führer wordlessly opened the folder and read the proposal. A moment of silence passed.\n\n"Wow. The gall of you, Schörner." Schörner finally spoke. "This was an act of war. The militarists are up in arms and demand decisive action. There is no other..." "Are you fucking mad, man?" Speer snapped. Dropping his voice, "This would start a fucking war! Are you willing to give up everything for postering, for you and the military's ego?"\n\nSchörne glanced at his feet, then looked up. "If we don't respond... we look terribly weak on the foreign stage, and God knows what happens at home if we do NOTHING. That's why we chose Iceland. Small population, but important enough to show the world not to underestimate us. Ever.\n\nSpeer's head dropped. "My Führer, it's a hard choice, but with your word, we can strike back tonight.

The room sat in silence as the dogfight commenced over a thousand miles from the White House. Smith's stomach sank as a young man screamed "I'm hit, I'm hit!" before breaking up. Another American pilot, although calm, reported the same. He at least managed to confirm "Bailing out." before losing radio contact. The American fighters were quick to respond, twelve American interceptors who had been observing near their operational height limit dove down unto the approaching German formation, quickly scattering them, decisively changing the balance of power.\n\nAfter only half an hour, the crisis was over. The Germans just couldn't regain the initiative, and after a dozen confirmed kills, the rest of the formation scattered back to Germany. Both American fighters who had been shot down were promptly recovered, along with several Germans. The mood back in the White House wasn't enthusiastic, however.

"Surely democracy is better than all other forms of government!" is his immediate reply, "Men were born to be free, Helmut, and democracy is the only way such natural instinct can be satisfied: under a tyranny, there will always be resistance, and its eventual collapse is a matter of time"\n\nSchmidt understands that by talking in absolutes, this would lead nowhere, so he smiles courteously to his guest, and answers: "And yet the Reich is the result of democracy's failure, Walter. The democratic government of Weimar wasn't able to answer to the demands of the German people, and so it was replaced by a government which could meet such demands of order and rebirth. The results of this are well-known, and I believe I don't need to reminisce the events of the past two decades with you, my friend" he says, putting a bit of accent on the word "friend"\n\nDowling understands that going down this road may as well lead to the visit's failure, and also he has been taken aback by the German's point of view, so he decides to end the debate and directs an equally courteous smile towards Schmidt: "Indeed, our world is far more complex than what we would want to, isn't it?

A U-boat has launched its payload, painting Iceland red with its fierce nuclear glow; brighter than the sun, more brilliant than the stars, and hotter than Hell itself.\n\nSpeer and his top advisors sat in a conference room, waiting. A minute passed, then two. After three, cautious optimism started to spread. Was Schörner right after all? Would the Americans blink first? Another minute. The tension could be cut with a knife. Five. Six. After seven, a faceless administrator cracked a half-hearted joke. Eight, nine. Finally, ten minutes. The ten longest minutes in human history passed with a collective, optimistic sigh of relief. An impromptu toast was raised to Führer Speer.\n\n"Sieg Hail!" went the cry! And the men drank. To the bold, to the Reich, and to their fearless leader, who had redeemed their honor and avenged their recent dead; those pilots who did not return from their sortie to Iceland. Speer himself even partook, with a thin smile dancing on his lips. The Reich avenged her sons, her honor restored. Another victory for the Fatherland, perhaps her greatest yet! Who would dare to face her?\n\nA senior officer rushed into the merry conference room, breathless and white as a ghost. "They're launching! They're launching everything!"\n\nOf course, the staff, the petty bureaucrats and the oh-so-tough warmongerers fled to the bunker complexes. The sirens sounded, but it would be for naught. Speer knew that the missiles would strike with their deadly payloads within fifteen minutes. It was hardly any time for the citizens to reach the few bunkers scattered across Germany. Ten minutes after the alarms sounded, intermittent shaking began. Speer felt little terror within himself, but pangs of remorse racked his mind. As the ground heaved beneath his feet, he had one duty he needed to yet fulfil. He owed it to his people.\n\nThe Führer found Schörner standing besides a grand window facing north. Speer joined him. Neither man spoke as they watched the horizon glow, the grand beacons of light and ash approaching closer and closer to Germania.\n\n"So, this is it." The general finally broke their silence. Yet Speer could not speak. In another twenty minutes, he knew the Reich, HIS Reich, his home, would be ash. There wasn't even time for enough people to make it to the bunkers to fill them. The streets were eerily empty, and other than the cry of the sirens and the sporidic booms of approaching doom, the heart of Germany was deathly silent. The city awaited her final judgement..\n\n"This is it. This is how it ends," he spoke again. A moment of silence passed. The ground suddenly jerked; another blast rocked the earth, so violently that the glass in front of the men cracked and buckled. Neither man flinched. Schörner was the first to turn and walk, presumably to the safety of the bunkers.\n\n"This is what you wanted, right?" Schörner stopped, and turned back to face his leader, who had tears welling in his eyes. "Well, how did we do, General? Did we play the part well?" he spat."

A loud bang closely followed by the sound of breaking glass came from the other side of the door. A curse, then silence. Schörner knocked.\n\n"What the hell do you idiots want?!" Speer screamed. He was pissed. Schörner took another breath, then strolled in confidently.\n\nThe office was a mess. It was clear that Albert Speer was in a rage; something Schörner had never seen from the usually calm and collected man. Files and papers were strewn everywhere. A full sized mirror in the corner of the room was shattered into a million pieces, specks of blood strewn nearby. Pacing back and forth behind his desk was a disheveled Albert Speer, blood trickling down from his cut knuckles. He looked up and paused; his facing darkening when he realized just who had entered.\n\n"You." Speer spoke, then paused. Schörner, for once, had nothing to say.

There was no backing down now. "The U-Boats are off the coast of Iceland, as ordered. They are standing by on your..."\n\nSpeer cut him off. "Did I not give you simple, easy, God damn instructions?" His tone was quieter now, but menacing. It was as if venom came from his lips.\n\n"Ah, uh, yes, sir." Schörner replied without stumbling over too many of his words. Describing Speer as 'frustrated' was definitely an understatement.\n\n"The captian refused the codes from me. Said procedure required him to hear the orders from your mouth." Speer merely stared at the general. Schörner, for his part, remained calm. He walked forwards with his typical confidence and handed Speer a note with a number on it. "The direct line, sir." Speer immediately punched the numbers into his land line.\n\n"Captain von Steiner, reporting." The voice on the other end spoke calmly, as if rehearsed a thousand times."

The planes launched from Germany, came within a thousand meters of their airspace, then abruptly turned back, with no complications. In fact, there were even no mechanical issues. Everything went perfectly, in every sense of the word. "What is the response from the Americans?"\n\n"Officially, none, my Führer. Unofficially?

Maybe to show strength. But from men like Charles Lindburg, these incursions were a pain in the ass. Because every week, the Germans did the same thing; five strategic bombers with twenty or so escorts flew towards an OFN base or airspace, and every time they did this, NORAD had to respond as if the Germans were about to strike. Planes had to be mobilized on next to no notice, bases had to be mobilized, and the Armed Forces freaked out. Every. God. Damn. Time.\n\nLindburg was sick of it. His colleges were sick of it. The Navy man on the phone was pissed off and sick of it. But, everyone understood that, knowing the Germans, the one time NORAD doesn't react to a threat seriously would be the one time the Germans struck an OFN base. Life is fickle like that.\n\nThe man in the phone continued to yell. "Twenty five! Twenty five bogies heading towards MY airspace! I want thirty, no, fifty interceptors circling above my HQ in ten minutes!" A loud BANG emitted from the phone. Lindburg winced and rubbed his ear as he put the cold plastic back on its base. What a prick. Lindburg didn't even rise from his desk; they were already scrambling nearly two dozen interceptors; no other fighters were close enough to respond within twenty minutes. Not that it would matter, because in ten, the Germans would abruptly break off their course and head home. God damn bastards. The man rubbed his temple, a thudding headache was starting to kill him.

After all, Führer Speer himself had authorized the order. He trusted his Führer; Speer was a man who was healing the greatest nation on Earth, restoring her and reforming her. If he deemed it necessary, then it must be, and he would carry out his duty.\n\nWorry embedded itself into the man's heart long after the planes streamed north-west.

Trust in the mission."\n\n"Thirty seconds." In the distance, they could see the American planes "Mission complete, gentlemen. Time to go home," they heard from the lead fighter pilot. The pilot exhaled a breath he didn't know he was holding in, and started to bank right. As the formation turned as one, the Americans' left off a volley of missiles.\n\n"Shit shit shit!" both men cursed as the dashboard lit up with warnings. "Deploy flares!" "Deploying!" A missle streamed past the plane, then another one. Yes! They may make it out of this yet. Their turn was almost complete, then they could...\n\nBefore he could finish his thought, the entire plane rocked and the alarms started screaming. "Shit!" the co-pilot yelled. "Engines one through three are down!" The pilot looked out the cockpit to the damaged wing, and his stomach dropped. There wasn't a wing there.\n\nThe plane started nosediving and spinning, while above him an intense dogfight broke out. Though the Americans had caught the Germans in a bad position, but the remaining German fighters were giving the bastards hell.\n\nThe pilot sat still as his co panicked and started sobbing, a German fighter plane exploding in front of them, some thousands feet up.

Dejectly, he flipped a switch. Instantly, G-force pushed him back into his seat as the air-brakes engaged. In three seconds, he was back in formation. Patience. The cockpit started to beep as he locked onto one of the titanic bombers. Seven missiles streamed from the Americans, the young man's missile making eight. The air-to-air missiles streamed past, leaving nothing but a red glare in their wake. He watched. Would he be so...\n\n"Yes!" he shouted as his, and his missile alone smashed into a bomber in the rear. Confirmed kill. Hell yeah. The triumph was short-lived. Over a dozen German fighters dove from above as the five escorts close to the bombers scattered, but not before launching their own barrage of missiles. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. A missle streamed right towards his plane. Shit. He slammed the joystick up in an attempt to evade. His reaction was quick, and almost perfect. In fact, if the green rookie hadn't been so fast, the missile would have flown straight into his cockpit; he would have been incinerated instantly. Instead, the midsection of the plane took the brunt of the damage. The jet started to spin helplessly out of control, rolling on all axes. "THIS IS 2-9! I'M HIT, I'M HIT! I'M GOING DOWN!" He looked at his consul in panic. No power. Had anyone heard him?\n\nThe plane was in a hopeless tailspin, next to no control, losing altitude fast. Way too fast. The plane wouldn't stop rolling for a safe ejection. He would have to time this perfectly. He prayed as he grabbed the ejection lever. Would it work? Would he time the erratic movements of the plane just right? The plane spun right side up. He pulled the lever. Nothing.\n\nThe plane tilted about ninety degrees before the canopy popped off and the seat ejected. A sideways ejection. SHIT. The man almost cried as he looked down at the fast approaching water. Is this how he died, on his first mission? No...no. Not like this. The pilot threw all of his body weight back, and miraculously, the chair leveled right side up. Quickly, he deployed the backup parachute... which immediately deployed. Battered and bruised, the rookie would survive to fight another day."

But, we have to admit that we were pleasantly surprised and entertained by a number of quality films. Not all of them were too memorable, but one drama in particular starring a renowned comedy actor named Heinz Rühmann seemed to strike a chord with its audience.\n\nPerhaps, if relations do continue to improve, there could be a strong collaboration between our film industries, which could ultimately even lead to a strengthening of cultural ties between the US and Germany. Maybe that's getting a little ahead of ourselves, but nevertheless we can consider this evening to be a modest success."

 SPEERUSA.116.desc:0 "One of several events arranged by the Germans in the US as a goodwill gesture, the Unity Fair in Boston has turned out rather unfortunately. Intended to be a grand exposition akin to the World's Fairs of decades past, the fair has instead reinforced the many negative cultural stereotypes our populace holds about Germany and its people. The site was covered head to toe in swastika-themed paraphernalia, which was a huge mistake considering that Americans do not react positively to the symbol they've learned to hate after years of German conquest and American propaganda.\n\nWhile the actual quality of the cultural and scientific displays was very impressive, the fair simply seemed to portray the Germans as humourless fanatics, which doesn't bode too well for our attempts to improve their image in the minds of the American people. Luckily, there are many more events and visits to come where this error can be rectified."

In the Office of the United States Secretary of State, a letter from Berlin has arrived. An invitation.\n\nAmerica is a nation skeptical of the outside, and of no nation are the Yanks more suspicious than the Reich. However, an olive branch is a welcome gift in these parts, and, in a changing world, the more friends Washington has, the better. The letter was well addressed and complimentary, and the trip does sound delightful. Seeing the sights of Hamburg, a true European city of tradition and grace? Surely it couldn't be too bad."

One hundred years later, she saw vicious bombing campaigns by the cursed British and allied forces. Just recently, 1962's North Sea Flood tested the wills of Hamburg's great citizens. Now, a rebellious plague sweeps the city, and its carrier is the fiery naivety of German youth.\n\nWe know not what the protestors demand, nor do we particularly care. All we know is that with the Americans' arriving in Germany, we cannot have these demonstrators crowding our streets, throwing bricks and generally making a mess of things.\n\nThankfully, a Chancellery meeting today has proved fruitful. Speer and Gehlen have sent armoured trucks and men with guns into Hamburg, quickly and effectively taking care of the rioters and moving them elsewhere. At least for now, our faces are saved."

 #Slave Siege chain

speerflavor.1.t:0 "Planning Rebellion"
speerflavor.1.d:0 "The back alley of the Kruppstrasse in Frankfurt was a damp and dingy place at night, rarely visited or checked by any of the passing guards. Flanked by 4 wings of the local Krupp factory, each producing their own variant of metalworks, it was a perfect place for meetings of the more secretive kind. Indeed, it was this exact reason why the man silently stood against the wall, waiting for his comrades to join him.\n\nOne by one, they made their way out of the blocks they called home, sneaking over to the same wall and avoiding the lazy flashlight beams that occasionally flicked down the road. When the last conspirator, a man of slim frame, squeezed out of the hole in the wall of his barracks and slid over to the wall, the first man blew a sigh of relief. He was the one that the first man had prayed would return.\n\n"So, Rasmus. How did they respond?"\n\n"Wing A is ready. They're practically chomping at the bit to go now."\n\nThe second man barely held in a laugh of glee. "Holy shit, it's really all coming together! I never thought I'd see the day we all grew balls and went after the Germans!"\n\n"It's a goddamn miracle, Mykyta." Said the third man, a faint smile crossed his lips. Out of all of the men, he had been a slave for the longest, toiling for years over his machines and tools, always at the mercy of the Nazis. Finally, the slaves were taking back some control.\n\n"Jan. You wanted to be the one to start the fight, didn't you?" Asked the first to the third. Jan's smile widened again.\n\n"Mikhail. You don't even have to ask- I'd start it myself, with or without you."\n\n"Then it's settled." Mikhail straightened himself up, shifting his uncomfortable slave uniform around. "Tell your friends- we're going in 3 days. We'll overpower the guards, capture the factory, and get out."\n\n"And then?" Nikita asked.\n\n"And then," Mikhail continued, "We're free.""
speerflavor.1.a:0 "What are they up to...?"

speerflavor.2.t:0 "A Crash, a Shot, and a Revolt"
speerflavor.2.d:0 "A crash rose above the standard noise of the factory floor, and like the moment after a thunderclap, all went silent. The guard, who had been slowly making his way around the floor, perked up for a moment. It was not often that he got to punish a slave anymore- indeed, for the last few days, they had been more quiet than ever. He had not been the only one to notice this- the guards in the other wings had complained about the slowness of the last days just as much as he had. Of course, he was sure the executives who watched over it all didn't mind- less disturbances meant more productivity. Now, however, the guard had his chance to finally enjoy the power of his job.\n\nThe other slaves seemed to part like a wave as he pushed his way through to the offender, an older man who the guard had seen- and punished- many times before. Splayed out across the floor lay the box of tools the slave had been using. A foolish error, and one that would not go unpunished, thought the guard.\n\n"Pick that up," stated the guard, pointing to a wrench that lay close to his feet. The man did not move. The guard smirked- a rebellious streak had always been apparent in this one. He resolved to teach him a few lessons in manners as he pulled out his baton. Quickly and forcefully, he pushed the man back with it, planting the tip squarely in the slave's sternum.\n\n"Pick it up, boy," the guard said again, louder and more threatening than before. Still, the man did not move. The guard responded by striking the man to the ground with a swing from the baton. Finally, the slave crawled over to the wrench and picked it up, standing as he did so. The guard smiled, his victory confirmed.\n\nHis smile would remain on his face up until the slave, whirling around, slammed the wrench directly into his jaw.\n\nThe guard collapsed to the ground, stars whirling around his vision. In a mix of anger and rage, he reached for his gun, raising it towards the rebellious ingrate. His shot went wild into the ceiling as a multitude of hands grabbed him, knocking him back to the floor and wrestling the pistol from his hands. Across the factory floor, the sounds of chaos replaced the previous silence, and the guard could only wonder how long the slaves had waited for this day before he lost consciousness."
speerflavor.2.a:0 "The revolution has begun!"

speerflavor.3.t:0 "Digging In"
speerflavor.3.d:0 "In the chaos of the Kruppstrasse, one man made his way quickly through the crowd of slaves. Jan still held the wrench that had started the whole affair close to his chest as he pushed through the turmoil, searching for his fellow leaders. It was a difficult task, made more difficult by those who recognized him trying to give their compliments and praise. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of pushing and shoving, he reached the other three. Mykyta, Mikhail, and Rasmus all stood on a metal catwalk above the street, watching as hundreds of slaves either made a break for freedom, grabbed weapons from the now wide-open doors of the factory armories, or barricaded the streets in preparation for the inevitable police response. As Jan joined them, Rasmus's eyes locked onto a chain of guards and executives, all being led into one factory as hostages. They were not the only ones.\n\n"...took longer than we thought to clear out Wing 4, but we got it in the end - look at that, it's the man of the hour." Rasmus turned to Jan, a smile crossing his face. "How'd Wing 2 go, Jan?"\n\n"Perfect. I really nailed the son of a bitch who went after me. If you guys see a guard with a fucked-up mouth, tell him I said hello. How about you fellows?"\n\n"Wing 1 and 3 went smoothly as well," Mikhail chimed in, "though Wing 4 took a little longer than we hoped. The men there didn't realize we had started until the guards began locking the place down. In any case, the whole plan succeeded so far."\n\nThe men looked back down onto the street, watching the turmoil. Jan's eyes latched onto one group of slaves, currently making a break for it out into Frankfurt. They reached the corner where the Kruppstrasse turned onto another street, then froze. Suddenly, each of them dashed back to the barricades, inaudibly shouting. A wave of commotion swept through those who still were inside the barricades.\n\nAs each of the leaders turned towards the frenzy, the source of the chaos became apparent. Three police cars sped past the corner, sliding to a stop with a screech of tires. They sped off just as quickly when a hail of panicked gunshots rained down the street, bullets pinging off their cars as they got out of the area. The four men looked at each other, each realizing what was to come.\n\n"I'll get defenses set up." Mykyta said, turning to the stairs. "Be prepared for anything. And, brothers, if this becomes our last stand, make sure to take as many of them with you as you can."\n\nThe men said nothing. There was work to be done."
speerflavor.3.a:0 "The siege begins."

speerflavor.4.t:0 "No Everyday Patrol"
speerflavor.4.d:0 "Johann's patrol car was not used to moving so quickly, and screeched in protest to being treated so roughly at every corner. Inside the car, Johann himself listened intently to the police radio. It was a struggle to make out independent facts or statements with the amount of information flowing in. Tales of escaping slaves causing havoc through Frankfurt were swiftly cut off by reports of general chaos, multiple gunshots, and an increasingly flustered radio operator trying in vain to restore order on the airwaves. None of this mattered to Johann- he had his orders, and he already knew what he was supposed to do.\n\nTwo patrol cars, evidently headed to the same location as he was, fell in behind him as he continued to roar down the main avenues. Cars lay abandoned at the side of the road as the police cars roared past, evidence of the growing chaos that was engulfing the industrial side of town. Finally, Johann and the others pulled up to the perimeter that had been set up, and witnessed a scene of pure chaos.\n\nWhile the street itself was empty- the police presence had been enough to scare any running slaves back to their holes- a full block had been abandoned to the rebellion, with the perimeter having been set up just around the corner from where the rebellious factory was located. Worried, angry, and above all else confused officers chattered to each other, setting up their own police barricade.\n\nJohann stepped out of his car and made his way to the nearest face he recognized. The sergeant quickly snapped to attention as he saw the captain approach.\n\n"Wachtmeister Schneider. Status report, if you will." Johann said curtly.\n\n"It's like nothing I've ever seen before, Oberstleutnant. They've flipped containers and made them barricades, they've boarded up doors and windows, they've got weapons everywhere- they've built a damn fortress." Schneider panted. Johann kept walking, heading towards the corner that stood between the police and the revolters. He stuck his head around for a moment to confirm what Schneider had said.\n\nEven though Johann had fought in the Civil War, his mouth nearly fell open at the spectacle of a barricade, defended by slaves still in their working clothes, armed to the teeth with rifles, pistols, and shotguns. It, indeed, was like nothing he had ever seen before. His shock was so great that it took Schneider to pull him back around the corner when multiple bullets cracked off the wall.\n\n"Herr Oberstleutnant, you see what I mean, yes?" Schneider asked."
speerflavor.4.a:0 "We're going to need the Wehrmacht for this."

speerflavor.5.t:0 "Emergency Meeting"
speerflavor.5.d:0 "Speer wanted to bury his face in his hands. Of course this would happen to him. The only time a slave revolt ever succeeds, and it's under him. Across from him sat the men of the Gang of Four, each looking similarly downtrodden as Speer. Next to them sat Hans Speidel, calm as always, though his uncomfortable fidgeting did betray a hint of worry. Each of these men would occasionally look over to the phone on Speer's desk, which at any second was all but certain to ring with the voice of Ferdinand Schörner. Speer could already imagine the look of glee on Schörner's face as he heard the news, and he shuddered to think of the tongue-lashing that would come.\n\n"So," Speer quietly said, "How many slaves were in the factory?"\n\nHelmut fidgeted uncomfortably. "Around 800, my Führer."\n\n"Christ." Speer sighed. "And how many do we estimate are still fighting?"\n\nA long, uncomfortable silence punctuated the air as each of the men in the office looked at each other. Finally, Speidel spoke up. "We estimate between 200 and 300, but there's no way of knowing how many are inside the wings."\n\nSpeer audibly groaned. "I don't see why we don't move in, take the factory back, end this mess."\n\n"With the amount of hostages they've got in there?" Schmidt questioned. "We'll be lucky if we get ten of them out alive if we throw the Wehrmacht in."\n\n"Besides that," Kiesinger interrupted, "We've already received some ground reports that students from nearby universities are aiding escaping slaves hide from police patrols. Their reaction to a full-blown shootout may be... ugly."\n\n"Must we speak of the politics of the matter? This is the worst hostage crisis we've faced in our history." Speidel interjected. "Now, if you would allow me, I have a plan-"\n\nThe phone rang, and each of the men tensed. Slowly, Speer picked it up. He listened for a moment, then held the receiver away from his ear to notify the others."
speerflavor.5.a:0 ""It's Schörner.""

speerflavor.6.t:0 "Schörner's Plan"
speerflavor.6.d:0 ""Herr Schörner, please, calm yourself."\n\n"My Führer, I will calm myself when the situation is no longer so volatile. For now, we are looking at the worst slave revolt in years! How could you expect any good citizen to be calm in such a situation?"\n\nThe five other men in the room could barely make out Schörner's voice, tinny and canned as it was. Speer himself could hear all too much of it- the Field Marshal was practically screaming into his ear. He leaned back in his chair, distancing himself from the receiver. If he didn't, the urge to hang up on the man would eventually overpower him.\n\n"So what's your suggestion, Ferdinand? I'm sure I can guess the gist of it." He asked. There was a moment of silence on the other end, and the rest of the room leaned in to hear it better.\n\n"Send in the tanks, the armored cars, the planes, the Wehrmacht. Take them out-" Each of the men in the room reacted in their own special way. Schmidt threw his hands up in the air, Speidel sighed, and the other men of the Gang exchanged looks of displeasure. Speer, however, remained silent. "-as fast as you can, casualties be damned. If we give them even an inch, they'll take a mile, and we'll lose control in days."\n\n"We'll consider it." Speer flatly stated, placing the phone face up on his desk. Schörner's continued rant went unnoticed in the commotion that followed.\n\nIn a moment, the Gang began to shout over one another in their objections. Cries of "Murderer", "Pig", and "Idiot", which Speer decided to assume were directed at Schörner, rebounded through the room. Speer's face remained unmoved. Finally, Speidel stood, and the rest of the men silenced themselves.\n\n"My Führer, I think you should hear me out before you make any choices on the matter. I believe your council has a suggestion as well, judging by that... outburst." Speidel stated. The Gang, led by Schmidt, voiced their agreement."
speerflavor.6.a:0 ""Very well. Speak, Herr Speidel.""

speerflavor.7.t:0 "Speidel's Plan"
speerflavor.7.d:0 "Hans Speidel took a deep breath. Each of the men around him watched his every move, his every twitch. He made sure to minimize any nervous fidgeting before he began.\n\n"My proposal is similar to the Field Marshal's proposal, though I will say it is more refined than the blunt solution my colleague provides. In short, there is no way that this situation can be dealt with in such a... heavy handed way, if you wish to keep casualties low. However, if we negotiate, we give in to the slaves and their threats. Every slave in the Reich will see us give in and assume that they can do the same. We'll see revolts across Germany within a month if we give in, mark my words."\n\n"You coward! What you suggest would take far too long to do. The news will be all over Germany by the time your plan is ready, and then-" Schörner shouted to make himself audible through the phone. Speer paused for a moment to listen before motioning for Speidel to continue, placing his hand over the speaker to muffle the noise.\n\n"My suggestion would be to take a slow, cautious, yet tough approach on these slaves. An infiltration, coordinated with our best units, could potentially result in catching the rebels off guard. If we do this right, we could seize control of the factories without too much bloodshed. My top men have already begun drawing out a plan, if you wish for it."\n\n"You idiot. You're ruling out even trying to negotiate because of what you think will happen? You're no better than the butcher on the other end of that telephone." Schmidt loudly objected. The rest of the Gang nodded, though their reaction was much less strong than that of Schmidt.\n\n"I'm not suggesting we go in and kill all of them, Helmut, I'm suggesting we put this down before it spreads!" Speidel wheeled around angrily. A shouting match erupted before Speer, with a hearty slap of his table, brought everyone to order. He sighed before turning to Schmidt."
speerflavor.7.a:0 ""Herr Schmidt, the floor is yours.""

speerflavor.8.t:0 "Schmidt's Proposal"
speerflavor.8.d:0 "Schmidt stood, the rest of the Gang watching him closely. He cleared his throat before he began, making sure to stand as upright as he could. Speer watched him intently as he began.\n\n"My Führer, while the other proposals that your generals have brought before us could certainly hold some merit, the fact remains that they are simply too harsh to be considered. If we pull off any form of military maneuver against the slaves, the liberals you rely on so heavily will explode. After all, would such an oppressive maneuver not directly contradict your supposed wish to free the slaves? No, if you wish to come out of this with your hide intact, you must come to the table with the slaves. This doesn't mean we have to give in to all their demands, of course, but a negotiation would certainly go down well with your base. Besides, while Herr Speidel seems to think negotiation would encourage revolt, I believe it would have the opposite effect. After all, would the slaves not believe you truly mean what you say if you talk to a revolting group?"\n\nSchörner's voice cut in at a volume loud enough for all to hear. "You traitor! You imbecilic fool! You think the slaves can be negotiated with? You think this WON'T encourage lawlessness? My Führer, I cannot stand with such a ridiculously stupid action!"\n\nSpeidel uncomfortably cut in on Schörner's continued rant. "While it pains me to say it, I have to agree with Schörner on this point. Negotiation, as I said, only breeds further revolt. To give in is to set the precedent that we are willing to give in to violence and chaos. We'll only see unrest if we give in for stability's sake."\n\nSchmidt did not take this rebuttal lightly. "You only think this because you're too wrapped up in discipline to see the human side of things! We're running out of time to make a decision here, my Führer! If we don't negotiate, blood will run through the streets of Frankfurt, and our claim to reformism and slave freedom will be forever damaged!"\n\nSpeer sat in silence for a moment, running through all the possibilities he could think of. The men in the room stood silently, waiting for a reaction that could change Germany forever."
speerflavor.8.a:0 ""We must be strong. Herr Schörner, do what you must.""
speerflavor.8.b:0 ""We must be moderate. Herr Speidel, do what you can.""

speerflavor.9.t:0 "Do What We Must"
speerflavor.9.d:0 "The room, which only a second ago was nearly bursting, now flipped to uncomfortable silence. Speer became keenly aware of the stares of disbelief, rage, and disappointment that bored into him. The only noise now was the crackling of the telephone. Speer could even imagine Schörner staring into his receiver in shock.\n\n"Of course, my Führer." Was all that Schörner said before the line went dead with a loud click. Immediately, total chaos consumed the room, quickly rerouted into the lightning rod of pure rage that was Helmut Schmidt.\n\n"You goddamned MADMAN! You just killed 200 innocent souls, you heartless bastard! What sort of reformist are you? Free the slaves, huh? I didn't realize you meant freeing them from the fucking mortal coil!"\n\n"You will show respect to my decisions, Herr Schmidt. I am still your Führer!" Speer rose from his own chair in anger. Schmidt refused to sit down, despite the worried taps on his thigh by Kiesinger.\n\n"You shut the hell up, you two-faced rat! What will the people think!? What will the international community think!? Did you put an iota of thought into this before you chose death for hundreds?"\n\n"Herr Schmidt, you shall not insult me, and you certainly shall not tell me to shut up!"\n\n"I couldn't care less what you say-" Kiesinger shoved Schmidt hard, and the man caught himself. Breathing deeply, Schmidt paused for a moment. His voice strained against his restraint as he continued. "I think it would be best if I retired for the night." With that, Schmidt left the room. The rest of the Gang closely followed, stopping only to glare at Speer, undoubtedly holding their tongues.\n\n"Herr Speidel, I made the right call, you must understand. The Heer can't think we're going too far, and the conservatives would shred me if I didn't... " Speer trailed off. Speidel said nothing, instead briskly turning and exiting, leaving Speer to reflect on his own decision."
speerflavor.9.a:0 "One must be forceful in their action."

speerflavor.10.t:0 "Do What We Can"
speerflavor.10.d:0 "The room processed Speer's words for a moment. A small grin spread across Speidel's face, a frown crossed Schmidt's, and various looks of acceptance flashed across the Gang's face. Slowly, Speer turned to the phone, which now sat deathly silent on the table. All eyes turned to the receiver, as the men braced for the explosion.\n\nAfter a moment, Speer grew concerned as to what Schörner was up to. "Herr Schörner, did you catch what I said?"\n\nThere was another moment of long, uncomfortable silence. Finally, the tinned voice of the Field Marshal returned. "Loud and clear, my Führer. Know that I am fully against this half hearted weakness." The line shut off with a menacing click.\n\n"My Führer, thank you for seeing reason. I promise you, we will not disappoint you in our endeavors. We'll have results shortly." Speidel turned and exited the room. Speer could almost envision the gears clicking away in Speidel's head, turning fiercely as he began to work on the problem at hand.\n\n"My Führer, while I can't say I'm in support of this measure, I will say it's a better choice than what you could have done. I hope you'll have mercy the next time one of these situations crop up." Schmidt spoke quickly and curtly. Speer could detect a hint of frustration in the man's voice, but said nothing in return. Finally, Schmidt left the room. Each of the other Gang members shared their own thoughts, none particularly positive, before departing. Speer sat alone in his room now, leaning back as he tapped his fingers on the desk. He turned to the window, the night sky sprawling over the Germania skyline. He exhaled a breath he had barely realized he was holding in. To nobody in particular, he said-"
speerflavor.10.a:0 ""I think I handled that well.""

speerflavor.11.t:0 "Do What We Will"
speerflavor.11.d:0 "The room, which had been almost bursting with sound, went dead silent. Speidel's eyes shot to Speer in disbelief, Schmidt's eyes widened, and the rest of the gang's attention quickly shot directly to the phone. The moment of silence would not last for long.\n\nThe telephone on the desk, which had been almost forgotten about in the chaos, quickly grabbed everyone's attention with a screech of static. Schörner's voice, now almost as loud as if he had been in the room, exploded from the speaker so ferociously that the phone nearly rattled off the table.\n\n"My Führer, you can't be serious! Are you truly suggesting that we not only put down a rebellion, but negotiate with them? They're slaves! If we negotiate, we give into decadent, lesser races! We give in to those we own! Do you honestly think that the other slaves will look at us give in to a slave revolt and not get the idea to do the same?"\n\n"Herr Schörner, I've thought this over, and this is the obvious solution if our agenda is to be followed and believed. Besides, your solution is less of a fix and more of a massacre." Speer flatly replied. The look on his face clearly betrayed his opinion on the Field Marshal to the other men in the room.\n\n"My solution may not be weak enough for you bleeding-hearts, but it will work! I cannot, in any way, support such a foolish, naive choice-"\n\n"Well, Herr Schörner, I'll take your complaints into consideration." Speer spat as blandly as possible, before unceremoniously placing the phone back in the receiver. Almost immediately, he was beset upon by Schmidt, who spent the better part of the next 5 minutes praising Speer's choice before rushing from the room, quickly being followed by the gang. Speidel stuck around a little longer to give his thoughts, mostly cautionary words against excessive looseness to revolters, though Speer could tell he was holding back some of his more choice words.\n\nFinally, when everyone was gone, Speer leaned back in his seat and stared out of his window. He couldn't help but think of the fiery speeches against him that were sure to come from all sectors. It was certainly going to hurt him with the Heer and the conservatives. Indeed, he almost regretted his choice for the amount of problems it would open up. At the end of the day, though, at least he knew it was the moral one."
speerflavor.11.a:0 "Schmidt can get it done."

speerflavor.12.t:0 "The Invasion"
speerflavor.12.d:0 "It had been almost a day since the siege had begun, and there seemed to be no end to the standoff. Mykyta watched from the factory window as his fighters patrolled the barricades, weapons in hand. It had been a very busy 24 hours, but it was certainly some of the most exciting of his entire life. He noticed Mikhail coming up as well, and sighed at the loss of his peace. Mikhail had been jumpy the entire time, pacing the factory for hours.\n\n"What's up?" Mykyta asked Mikhail. Mikhail said nothing, instead lighting his cigarette. Mykyta waited a moment for a response.\n\n"It's not that something's happening, it's that nothing's happening. No negotiation, no infiltration, they're just waiting for something." Mikhail exhaled.\n\nIt was at that moment when an explosion rocked the barricade in front, sending men flying across the compound. In an instant, all was chaos. Gunfire filled the street as Wehrmacht soldiers, dressed in full battle gear, charged the factory. The slaves put up a fight, and both Mikhail and Mykyta saw their fair share of Wehrmacht soldiers fall, but any hope of the attack being repulsed ended when a Leopard, machine guns spitting lead, rolled over the remains of the barricade. Its gun blasted a high explosive shell directly into wing A, blowing apart the flimsy walls of the factory like a house of cards being hit with a sledgehammer.\n\n"Mykyta, I think this is the end." Mikhail said quietly, as more and more vehicles began to overrun the factory. Mykyta was silent for a minute, watching the end of his dreams. The revolt had ended not as he hoped, but as he expected. Now, all that was left was to go out in as much a blaze of glory as they could."

speerflavor.13.t:0 "The After-Action Report"
speerflavor.13.d:0 "The room seemed to fit the mood of those inside it very well- dark and cold. Speer sat behind his desk, the Gang sat in their assorted chairs, and Speidel stood. All of them sat in uncomfortable silence, processing the news they had heard.\n\n"Well. Herr Speidel, you have the numbers, correct?" Schmidt took the liberty of starting the conversation, obviously not wanting to let Speer control what was said. Speidel stirred uncomfortably at being prompted by Schmidt, clearly catching on to Schmidt's plan, but went ahead anyway.\n\n"Numbers are incomplete, but, ah, we currently have about 191 slaves confirmed deceased, with about 100 more in custody with various wounds. Wehrmacht casualties are about 35 confirmed KIA, with one armored car disabled- hit by a Zhdanov. 62 have reported wounds, mostly minor bruises and scratches."\n\n"And, out of the estimated 70 hostages they were holding, how many did we recover?"\n\nSpeidel paused, hesitating to read the result. Finally, he spoke up. "None."\n\n"So that makes, what, about 300 dead? 300 innocent souls lost. Incredible. If only there was some other way we could have gone about this operation-"\n\nSpeer spoke up firmly. "Helmut, we've gone over this. I am not going to-"\n\nHelmut raised his voice over Speer's. "If only we could have negotiated, or taken any other means of attack that wasn't rolling a fucking tank over them!"\n\n"Herr Schmidt, I'm warning you-" Speer raised his voice in return. Schmidt ignored him, instead raising his voice to a near yell.\n\n"But no, this was clearly the right choice, right? 300 dead, but-"\n\n"Herr Schmidt, you are dismissed from this meeting!"

speerflavor.14.d:0 "It started out as a trickle. State media, of course, would not be covering such a stunning thing as a slave revolt in full detail (instead framing it as "minor unrest") so the information was passed through word of mouth. Telephones around Germany rang with the tales of gunshots, tanks, and machine guns rattling off, leading to many in universities across the Reich becoming glued to their phones. In Frankfurt itself, students watched from their windows as tank after tank rolled over university avenues and roads. It soon became apparent what they were here to do.\n\nThe massacre may have been ignored by the press, but it certainly wasn't ignored by the people. The telephone lines from Frankfurt nearly jammed with the sheer volume of calls sent across the Reich. In universities from Cologne to Königsberg, the youth of Germany heard uncensored, unfiltered accounts of chaos and death, directly caused by the government they had supported and trusted. Their reaction to the news was as one would expect.\n\nWithin two hours, spontaneous protests had erupted across any city with a major university in it, grinding the streets to a halt.\n\nWithin three hours, the protests were riots, and the police was backed up by whatever Heer forces were on hand.\n\nWithin five hours, the streets were lit by the flames of burnt-out cars and broken Zhdanovs, and the air was choked with tear gas and smoke.\n\nWithin eight hours, the streets were empty once more, leaving those who had cleared them to pick up the pieces. One thing was clear, though- the student's faith in Speer had shattered, and it was doubtful he could ever regain it."

speerflavor.15.d:0 "The newspaper sailed over the barbed wire on the wall with ease, falling to the ground outside of the slave barracks with a quiet thud. The early morning mist had dampened the paper somewhat, but it didn't matter to Mateusz, who reached out of a crack in his window to pick it up, sliding it into the cold barrack before slamming the window shut again. As he pulled the rubber band off the roll, he could only thank God that one of his friends had managed to strike a deal with a group of sympathetic students. It had let him and his fellow bunkmates stay informed, a luxury that many fellow workers did not possess.\n\nAs his friends gathered around him, he flipped through the first pages. It was the standard news, mostly, until he hit the fourth page. There, in the center of the page, one block of text was circled in black marker.\n\nThe title read "Minor Unrest in Frankfurt's Factories", but the words written in marker screamed "SUCCESSFUL SLAVE REVOLT- PUT DOWN BY HEER"\n\n"Holy shit, a slave revolt? I never thought I'd see the day." said one man behind him. "Christ, it says they put them down. Wonder what that looked like." said another. "Brave motherfuckers, the lot of them. Wish we could rise up like that." said a third.\n\nMateusz remained silent. Slowly, he rose, facing his friends.\n\n"You see this? This is the proof that we can overcome our so-called masters. The slaves in Frankfurt had enough of the whip and the baton, and they rose up, and you know what? They succeeded. They may have been put down, but they took over their factories. These men are the first to challenge the Germans, but they will certainly not be the last."\n\nHe took a breath, the men hanging onto every word.\n\n"And, hell, if they revolted against their guards and succeeded-""

speerflavor.17.d:0 "Speer's office was missing one member- an uncommon occurrence. Each man in there- Speer, Schmidt, and each of the other members of the Gang- watched the door patiently, awaiting Speidel's arrival. Finally, almost 20 minutes after the meeting was supposed to begin, Speidel made his way into the room, carrying multiple folders and dropping them on Speer's desk.\n\n"Sorry for my absence, my Führer, but the action report came in later than I expected. I hope you'll forgive the wait." Speidel breathed heavily, finding a seat as soon as he could. It seemed as if he had gotten some exercise in his rush to the office.\n\nSpeer flipped through each folder, searching in vain for numbers. After another few minutes of silence, he sighed and flipped the folders shut. "Forgive me, Herr Speidel, but I can't find the actual report in this mountain of paperwork. Can you give us a run down?"\n\nSpeidel grinned- he had done his paperwork, and expected this to happen. "Of course, my Führer. The operation began in earnest at 12:30, concluding at 13:43, though most of the action was finished by 12:42. In this period, 104 revolters were killed, with 187 captured and placed in custody, including all four of their supposed leaders. Wehrmacht casualties were 11 KIA, 24 wounded. Out of the 83 hostages taken, 74 were rescued. Overall, I think it's clear that this was a success."\n\n"Well, hold on there." Schmidt rose to his feet. "Sure, the operation succeeded in its goal, and I'm sure we're all thankful for that. But over a hundred people were still killed- lives that would have been saved if we had negotiated."\n\n"Herr Schmidt, I understand your concern, but I don't think many are weeping for unruly slaves." Speer replied.\n\nSchmidt stared at Speer, ice in his eyes, before sitting back down. The meeting would conclude shortly after."

speerflavor.18.t:0 "The Student Reaction"
speerflavor.18.d:0 "While much of the Reich had been paying at least passive to attention to the drama unfolding in Frankfurt for the last days, none watched more intently or cared as deeply as the students. For the last three days, students in every major university were glued to their phones, waiting for their friends to relay new news from Frankfurt. From there, they would speak to their friends, who would spread it across their dorms. Through this jury-rigged communication line, the students stayed up to date on every movement, every development, every shot. All watched intently for Speer's response- perhaps this was the turning point for him to finally kick up slave retribution to a new level.\n\nTo say that the reports of Wehrmacht storming the factory disappointed and angered the students greatly would be an incredible understatement.\n\nAs the news spread throughout the cities of Germany, so too did the protests. University dorms emptied onto the streets as thousands of enraged students marched on a scale not seen since the chaotic days of '63. Various protest chants filled the air, each different in sound and lyrics, but they each revolved around one theme- betrayal.\n\nThe streets would eventually empty, of course, but the feeling of resentment lingered. Across the Reich, portraits of Speer were silently taken off walls. Posters espousing Speer's ideals slowly disappeared from college campuses. In every campus, the tone of political discourse shifted from idealistic dreaming to bitter disappointment, as once again a leader had betrayed the youth of Germany.\n\nPerhaps it was not as bad as it could have been- a straight invasion of the complex may have driven the students to a riot- but the damage was clear. Speer had let the students down, and never again would they trust him so blindly."

speerflavor.19.t:0 "The Trial"
speerflavor.19.d:0 "The judge rapped his gavel twice, leaning forward to give his final remarks. The audience, hypnotized by the spectacle of it all, leaned forward with him. Indeed, the only four members of the court that seemed untouched by the spell were the defendants, who stared daggers into the judge's robes.\n\n"I believe this court has heard enough. Through the course of this trial, we have heard tales from witness after witness of these slaves' brutality. They rose up against the order of things, took arms from the workers of the factory, made hostages of any who dared resist their takeover, and when the time to restore order to the facility came, they brutally murdered numerous brave sons of our Reich! I'm truly saddened that the worst penalty that I can give to these heartless pigs is DEATH, to be executed immediately by firing squad!"\n\nThe crowd roared its approval, and the boos came fast and heavy as soldiers hoisted the slaves to their feet, beginning to drag them down the hall and out of the courthouse. Suddenly, one wriggled free. He pushed past the guards and, in one loud yell, shouted something that silenced the room. It would not be published in the news reports the next day, nor would it stop the crackle of gunfire that occured in the next minutes, yet it stuck with those who heard it long after the other details of the trial faded from their memory. After all, there was only one thing that it could mean, and if the slave spoke the truth, then what would the next years bring?"

speerflavor.20.d:0 ""What are they doing?"\n\nJan held his binoculars tightly to his face. Next to him, Mykyta watched as well as he could, though the action was currently happening well down the street.\n\n"I have no idea." Jan replied. "There's a man in a suit- he's talking to the army right now- they're setting up speakers?" Jan looked over to Mykyta in near disbelief.\n\n"Are they negotiating? You can't be serious." Mykyta responded, a similar look in his eyes. The Germans, negotiating with slaves? Untermensch? It didn't happen. Besides, why would they? Mykyta and Jan would never say it aloud, but they knew that, if the Germans really wanted to, they could steamroll any resistance the slaves could put up. Why would they negotiate?\n\n"You must be seeing things. Give me the binoculars." Mykyta snatched the binoculars from Jan's hands, pressing them to his own face. True enough, he watched as the man in the suit argued with a flustered officer. After a few moments, the man in the suit grabbed a microphone and began to stride forward. A stately voice blasted from the speakers, engulfing the factory.\n\n"Good afternoon!" the voice boomed. "My name is Helmut Schmidt, minister of foreign affairs and lead diplomat of the Reich! I have come to discuss terms of surrender, so that none may die on this day. With your co-operation, we can come to terms. Without it, the end result of this affair will be more bloody than either you or I want it to be. If you wish to cooperate, send a sign." With that, the man retreated back to the police cordon.\n\nJan and Mykyta looked at each other again. A mix of disbelief, joy, and relief permeated through each of them. Perhaps they could succeed after all."

speerflavor.21.t:0 "The Treaty of Frankfurt"
speerflavor.21.d:0 ""I'm telling you, Herr Schmidt, we can't accept that. We want to be free. There is not a compromise between freedom and slavery."\n\nHelmut Schmidt leaned back in his chair, resting the bridge of his nose between his fingers. "And I must tell you that I'm working with limited time and space here. You don't know how hard I needed to work to even get this chance. To release you, after a violent uprising? No, it would never be allowed. I need you to work with me here."\n\n"Then perhaps I will remind you, Herr Schmidt, that we still hold numerous hostages."\n\nThere was silence for a moment, as both parties regarded each other. Though neither side could read the other's mind, both knew that they couldn't afford for the negotiations to fall through. For Schmidt, it could spell the end of his reputation. For the slaves, it could spell the end of their lives. There had to be a compromise somewhere.\n\nA bolt of inspiration struck Schmidt, and he took his chance. "Look. I can't release everyone, but perhaps I can hit a middle ground. My proposal- you and the rest of your leaders surrender, and we try you fairly. The rest of the slaves are freed, along with the hostages. If you take the deal, I promise- none of you will ever see a slave factory from the inside again."\n\nThe slaves looked at each other. Schmidt attempted to hide his distress- were they sharing looks of joy? Agreement? Distaste? He needed a result soon- no doubt that Speer was getting antsy at how long it was taking to strike a deal.\n\nThe two men on the other side of the table looked back to Schmidt. "Herr Schmidt, if what you say is true, we would be happy to accept imprisonment if our comrades go free. I'm sure the other leaders would feel the same."\n\nThe prisoners couldn't see it, but the tension of the last days evaporated from Schmidt's body as he rose to shake their hands."

speerflavor.22.d:0 "Schmidt and the Gang entered the room all smiles, Schmidt himself carrying a healthy number of papers. Speidel passively watched as Schmidt carefully set them in front of Speer, who began to look through them. Midway through the first one, he stopped, looking back up to Schmidt. "Herr Schmidt, I'd prefer to not be looking through these all day. Is it possible for you to give a summary?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "Of course, my Führer. I flew to Frankfurt and engaged in a dialogue with the slave leaders. Over the course of the next days, we spoke to one another at the negotiating table, concluding in an agreement where, in exchange for the freedom of the hostages and the surrender of all arms, the leaders, and the factory, we would let the slaves go free-"\n\n"Hold on." Speer interrupted. "You let all the slaves go free? As in, all of them?"\n\nSchmidt paused for a moment. "Yes, my Führer. It was the only way to a successful deal."\n\nSpeer sighed. "Jesus Christ, the Heer is going to fucking shred me, Schmidt. Do you understand? The conservatives, the militarists, the businesses- they're going to fucking shred me."\n\n"My Führer, it was the only way." Schmidt replied, his tone of voice hardening slightly. He attempted to continue, but was again interrupted, this time by Speidel.\n\n"May I interrupt, my Führer?" Speidel questioned. He continued before he got an answer. "While the intentions of Herr Schmidt are certainly in the right place, I fear that we may see a wave of revolt among the slave populace when they learn of our softness on this issue. We need to stay on guard, perhaps raise security on major factories."\n\nNow Schmidt was the one interrupting. "For God's sake, Speidel, are you still going on about this? Your solution would have killed a hundred people, probably more. Sure, there could be some unrest. Does it truly matter if we've saved lives?"\n\n"I'm not saying it was the worst choice- there were certainly worse solutions proposed. All I'm saying is that we need to be on guard."\n\nSchmidt threw his hands up in the air. "My Führer, all of the details are in the folders. I'm sure you can find them for yourself." With that, Schmidt departed, with both the Gang and Speidel following shortly. All that remained in the room were Speer, his thoughts, and the mountain of papers on his desk."

speerflavor.23.d:0 "To our great Führer, Albert Speer\n\nMy Führer, we of the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Club for Albert Speer in specific, and the United University Clubs for Albert Speer in general, cannot commend your actions regarding the slave rebellion in Frankfurt higher. Indeed, there was some concern that you would go back on your word regarding the freedom of all slaves when the news was first passed to us. When the news came through that not only had you sent Helmut Schmidt to negotiate with the slaves, but had succeeded in your goals, I can only describe the mood as ecstatic. Indeed, we can certify that in Germania, we held an impromptu rally in your favor that was attended by at least a thousand fellow students. Such rallies were also reported to us by our other chains across Germany. We are so thankful to have a leader who truly is backing up his promises, and we are certain that this chain of action will continue. Know that, no matter what forces try and stop you, we will always be behind your rule.\n\nSincerely, Rudolf Wagner, Head of the United University Clubs for Albert Speer.\n\nTo the Führer, Albert Speer\n\nOne cannot help but look at your recent choice to negotiate with slaves, the bottom tier of German society, with disdain and fear. We in the Heer worry greatly over this recent course of action- is it not true that we Aryans are superior to our slaves? If we treat our slaves like Aryans, then what will the meaning and the power of the word even become? Suffice it to say that many of us in the Heer are more than a little displeased with this recent change in actions. Such foolish measures as negotiating with slaves will only lead to trouble and Western corruption in the future, and the notion that this Western corruption may be infiltrating even the highest levels of our government is very worrisome for those who love our Reich and what we have built upon it. I can only implore you to change course immediately, before the nation which we all love falls to Bolshevism and decadence.\n\nSincerely, Oberst Hans Meyer, Commander of the 2nd Regiment, 36th Division."

speerflavor.24.t:0 "Aftershocks"
speerflavor.24.d:0 ""I told you it would happen, my Führer, and it has. Read the reports for yourself." Speidel dropped a folder, filled with paper, directly onto Speer's desk. Speer took one look at it and, already knowing the contents, sighed deeply. Schmidt watched on, repressing his own anger at Speidel's continued resistance.\n\n"Hamburg- Two guards dead, six slaves dead, a dozen wounded. Danzig- Four guards dead, six slaves dead, another dozen wounded. Munich- 14 guards dead, 25 slaves dead, dozens wounded. The list goes on and on, my Führer." Speidel spoke with the certainty of a man who had memorized these reports. Speer placed his head in his hands as Speidel continued. "It seems clear to me, and many others, that this was a poor course of action to take, and now we are seeing the results."\n\nSchmidt cut in. "Herr Speidel, when will you stop going on about the damn decision? I think it was a net positive."\n\n"Of course you do, you came up with it." Speidel spat. He turned to face Schmidt, who seemed to grow angrier by the second.\n\n"And you say it isn't because we turned your proposal down!" Schmidt pointed at Speidel, who remained unmoved. "We avoided a disaster by negotiating- can you imagine the international response to us gunning down slaves? What about the students and reformists- you think they'd agree with running people over with tanks and cars?"\n\nNow it was Speidel's turn to get angry. "Herr Schmidt, it is your choice, not mine, that has led us into this mess! We would never see slave unrest to this scale if we had not enticed them to do so!"\n\n"ENOUGH!" shouted Speer, his head snapping back up. "What's done is done! There's no use arguing the damn point! If I hear one more argument about what we should or could have done, I'm throwing both of you out of my office!"\n\nThere was silence for a moment. Both Speidel and Schmidt were caught off guard by Speer's outburst, when he usually was the only one to remain calm in these scenarios. Finally, both men exited the office, leaving Speer alone to ponder what could have been, and what his actions would mean for Germany."

speerflavor.25.t:0 "Fresh Blood"
speerflavor.25.d:0 "Antonin Grzywacz was not fit for this kind of work. Forced to stay on his feet for hours on end, assembling car part after car part, and even sometimes hearing the crack of a whip and a pained yell that would always accompany it shortly afterwards. Life was not easy in Łódź - at least, that's what it used to be called. Now it was called Litzmannstadt, which the 47-year-old man found to be a horrific butchering of one of Poland's cities. Yet he could do nothing about it. Only toil and toil, until his body gave out.\n\nOne day, the piercing shriek of the whistle that would signify the beginning of their shift was absent. In its stead was a deafening gritty voice that came over the entire factory. In his time of servitude, Antonin had learned German and was practically fluent in it, which made understanding what was being said easy enough. It seemed to be an announcement of some kind, and as he listened in, the fingers grasping the assembly line tightened.\n\n"Workers of the Reich!" The voice exploded. "Listen carefully! On orders of the Führer, today we will begin introducing two things. The first will be an overhaul of the factory. It will chiefly concern an increase in safety protocols," he said, and Antonin cracked a discreet smile. Since when did they care? "Some of you will be receiving advanced training regarding new equipment being brought in. Next! You will be working with a few Germans--" ... What? The- "Who have been designated as being highly disciplined, efficient, and with a strong work ethic." As if the monstrous Aryan knew anything other than bloodshed, Antonin thought, a sudden fit of anger overtaking him. "It will be in your best interest to cooperate with them, else the punishments for acting out on your beastly instincts will be extreme!"\n\n"That is all. Continue working." As the crackle of the voice faded and the whistle signalled the beginning of the day, Antonin saw several men walk into the building. Unmarked. He scowled to himself, but he was no fool. The Germans settled themselves in, but the rest of the day passed with a silence that barely contained the intense murderous aura that surrounded many of the Polish slaves working there. Even Antonin. But he wouldn't succumb. Even in this scum-sucking bottom-of-the-barrel life, opportunity would come. For what, he didn't know, but he knew he couldn't work himself to death in here. Not yet."

speerflavor.26.t:0 "Fraternizing With the Enemy"
speerflavor.26.d:0 "That day, he felt particularly tired. Rubbing his eyes as he passed the checkpoint into the factory, Antonin floated a thought in his head about calling off from work. But, no - this wasn't Poland; they'd only accept a delimbing as an excuse, and even then. With a hiss laced together by a sigh, he noticed that a slight adjustment in workers was made. This happened every few months, of course, but this time luck proved unfavorable towards Antonin. Walking into the factory, he should've expected it sooner or later. But actually seeing the man - not particularly outstanding in any way, not even possessing the desired traits of an Aryan like blonde hair, was a thought running through his mind long enough for him to hear a shout behind him. It was the harsh voice of a factory overseer that grazed his back which called him back to him senses, and with an awkward neck rub, Antonin went to his designated position.\n\nHe was no fan of the Aryan, that much he could say for certain. His dislike of the man next to him plagued his mind. What an insult for a German citizen and a Polish slave to be working side-to-side like this! Antonin's mind drowned out the noise from the outside world as he thought, filling him with frustration about this awful fact. It was only when something akin to a voice came through did his haze stop up and lift. Then he heard it again, more clearly this time. "Hey, ah..." The other man began. Antonin tilted his head to the left slightly, enough to denote that he was hearing, but also continue to stare at his work. "You're Antonin, right? That's how your name was listed." No response. It took several seconds before the German continued. "I'm Gottfried. I've just been thinking... if I'm going to be working here for a while, I might as well-" That's when Antonin decided to turn all the way, giving him a cold glare. "No talking on the job." He said, almost spitting venom. "What sort of 'discipline' do you have to be doing this?"\n\n"I..." The other man began, seemingly wanting to say something. Then he turned back to the assembly line, muttering, "Nevermind, then." The German backing down from a conversation struck Antonin as strange. Why did he even bother to engage in conversation in the first place?! Did he not know who they were, and who he was? He didn't bother to think about it any further. By the time the whistle rattled through his head, all Antonin wanted to do was sleep. Sleep for as long and as heartily as he could."

speerflavor.27.d:0 "He was 49 years old now, and things have changed significantly ever since that announcement two years ago. This transitionary period was marked with relative calm - the incidents where non-Germans would assault Germans was rare, and it only got rarer when rumors spread of what would happen to those that tempted fate towards their overlords. Having spent most of his waking days here, he knew it all inside-out. That's how he also saw, bit by bit, how his fellow Polish workers were being phased out. At the very least he knew this time around where they were going.\n\nGottfried wasn't one of those 'highly disciplined' Germans, he had come to learn, instead being a volunteer for the Reich's program of encouraging them to move into less populated, more diverse cities nearing the edge of the border, rather than staying inside overcrowded metropolises. If only he could visit one of them. But discussing these things with Gottfried served as the second best thing.\n\n"So, Antonin," the German began, barely paying attention to the assembly line as he worked. "Have you heard?"\n\n"No, Gottfried, I have not." Antonin responded.\n\n"Führer Speer has decreed Polish slaves-" Antonin winced lightly before glaring at him, whose eyes widened in slight surprise as he nodded. "Ah, um, I'm sorry-- workers will be allowed to, uh, in due time, leave their assigned job and return to the city that they were born in. Or, if they were born in a village, in the city closest to that village."\n\nAntonin almost couldn't believe the words he was saying, causing him to fumble with the car part in his hands for a moment, threatening the gaze of a nearby overseer, before he readjusted and continued. "I'm sorry, Gottfried, but I don't believe your government is so kind to do that. There's always something in it for them." He said, bitterness pouring in near the end.\n\n"Well, I suppose that is... true..." The German said, very warily, very hesitantly. "But think about it. What does that mean for the future? Perhaps more liberties would be afforded to you at home?"\n\nThe thought of such a thing made Antonin chuckle. "Sure, Gottfried. When they eventually kick me, a man nearing fifty, out of the factory, what will they make of me when I return to a city I don't belong in, as a man well past the point of usefulness?" he asked.\n\nGottfried began to open his mouth, but relented. There was nothing more to speak about this topic for today."

speerflavor.28.d:0 "Antonin's fiftieth birthday was today. These days were no different from any other. Only a reminder that his body would continue to break down and become less useful, and that his mind would dull with the passage of time. For that morning he brought a slightly worn-out coat to work, and passing by the checkpoint, noticed an aura distinctly different to how it usually felt. When he entered the factory, Antonin noticed that all the workers were congregated into a half-circle around a podium in the middle of the room. Fitting into the crowd of half Germans and half Poles, Antonin stared at the collection of what looked like military officers, one standing in front the rest. Subconsciously gritting his teeth at the sight of a proper Nazi, Antonin listened in as the man gave a stiff salute. And then...\n\n"Workers of the Reich! In this case, I am more importantly addressing our Polish slaves."\n\nAntonin rolled his eyes. Of course.\n\n"The Führer has announced that the Litzmannstadt automobile factory, property of Daimler-Benz, is letting go of all Polish workers who have not been born in Litzmannstadt!"\n\nImmediately, the murmuring in the crowd was heavy, but a slamming of rifles against the ground by nearby soldiers shut them - and Antonin - up quickly.\n\n"Effective today, those in question will be given three days' worth of rations, their documents, including a passport, and one month's work of pay. You will be guided to trains that will head either to German territory, or to the Polish government." Feeling a need to say no more, he gave another stiff salute. "Dismissed!"\n\nAntonin's mind had entered a flurry. Was what Gottfried said that year ago really going to ring true? Was he going to go home? Why now, of all times, and so suddenly?! There was a tightness in his chest as he approached the man he had now known for two years, and for a moment, he had looked at Gottfried as if he was just another German, but it passed just as quickly as it appeared.\n\n"Y-you were right..." Antonin began, and his fellow worker nodded silently. "Now I must board a train and head to a city, all in one day. This all has happened so quickly, so suddenly, and..." He trailed off.\n\nGottfried shook his head. "I don't know much, Antonin, but I know that I'll miss talking to you." Antonin looked at the German carefully, swallowing a lump in his throat."

He didn't know what to think. What was there to think? Nothing at all. Indeed, that was what Antonin was going through. He thought of nothing, but his mind hurt as if he had a migraine. Perhaps he was not allowing his mind to think? Yet deep in that hole of nothingness and despair, a thought was extracted. He could notice his breathing becoming more hitched, the scratching of his fingertips against the floor as his hand tightened up.\n\n"I have been here before," the sentence wandered in his mind. Numb and cold, but it held an ingrained sense of impossibly comprehensive fury. "I have been here before," it repeated, begging to be completed. "The rumbling of this engine and the mixing of the colours in front of me. I recognize this all. It's familiar to me, in a way I cannot ever forget." And how could he? If he did, he would lose the last thing that made him a person. Otherwise, he would simply be a shell, hollow and tumbling in the void, waiting to be consumed by reality's cruel whims. "I have been here before. When I was, I never expected to be anywhere else. But I did. Now I have returned."\n\nAntonin was not thinking. How could he think? If he did, it would only open up long-lost memories that he would not dare to look at. Here, in this train, he was alone. Utterly alone. In this car there was nobody else but him-- he had all reason to think, and all the time. But he would prefer to have his mind remain closed. Banishing the flame that threatened to engulf him in his mind, he only stared mindlessly into the fields, all of which blended into the same field, green and endless.\n\nYet even in a lack of thought he hated the chugging of the engine - the bumps in the rail making him stop up his breath as if the ride had ended. Silence dominated his surroundings, but all he could hear was noise that was almost thirty years overdue. He did not feel the pain in his fingertips, nor the fact that everything in his vision blended into shapeless blobs and whirlwinds of color, and the grinding in his mind that lasted for hours, and hours, and hours..."

A symbol of oppression removed - but it meant nothing to him. In fact, it only served to further frustrate him. Every day after he would come home from work, into a small apartment that can barely house one person, Antonin wonders what really would happen now. Clearly, this was not the end goal that the Germans had intended for him, as Gottfried had implied. But what then? What else was in store for him and his people?\n\nOne day, the piercing shriek of the whistle woke him from a daydream and alerted him to work. He was dreaming so often nowadays - was that age, or simply a want to escape reality? Either way, work was monotonous as before, only with somewhat less oversight from the guards, who seemed willing to pounce on any opportunity to harass them before. If life had to carry on like this, perhaps it wouldn't be so awful. He had a place to live, and a steady supply of people to talk to, as well as walking around a city freely... even if it was tamed by the Aryan, and moulded in its image.\n\nAt least, those illusions of which lasted until a fellow worker spoke to him. Surprised to hear a voice, he observed who spoke to him - it was a woman, who seemed to be in her 40s.\n\n"You," she began, with Antonin listening in only passively. "I can tell that something is off with you. Like a pacified animal, you shamble about and wait to be put down. Is that right?"\n\nThat caught his attention immediately, and he hissed out: "Are you ridiculous? What are you saying?"\n\n"What I am saying is this: I can sense that you are empty, my friend. That you have wanted something which has been kept from you for a long time."\n\n"And what would that be?" He silently struck back, frustration already appearing on his face.\n\n"An opportunity," she said, and a small smile graced her lips.\n\n"An... opportunity?" Antonin repeated, the word echoing in his head. Was that not what he was looking for? In all his years of labor, he never once struck a German in fear that he would miss out on an opportunity. And now... ?\n\n"To take back what we've deserved for so long. You know as well as I do, don't you?" She asked, as if she was speaking of some long lost artifact. "Say it.

speerflavor.31.d:0 "Grigory had always carried the hate passed down from his father. There was a spirit in him-- unconquered, unbroken, unwilling to bend to the will of the Aryan scum. But he had nothing to show for it, only working day-by-day to toil himself and serve as a slave to the Germans. If that's all he would be, and remain to be, then it was almost better to simply cease to exist. The thought to grab the nearest metal object and rush a guard crossed his mind, but never in the years he was working there did he carry out that glorious fantasy. Perhaps he was a coward for doing so, and would always remain a coward.\n\nUntil one day, a shrill voice stood tall over him and the rest of the non-Germans present in the factory. He didn't understand much of their language, choosing to almost actively work against learning it, but he had still learnt fragments of it. Enough to learn and piece together one crucial fact: that the first German worker would come work here, beginning that shift.\n\nEven though the silence afterwards spoke for itself, the guards didn't motion for any increased vigilance. Instead, they seemed to show relief that their fellow brethren would work here. Grigory, however, had other ideas. Only minutes afterwards did the first workers began trickling in, and once they did, the light in his eyes had shone in a way previously unknown. He could tell what the sinking yet exciting feeling in his gut was. This was the time, and he could get no other time.\n\nPerhaps it was the fact that the guards were lax from the German workers, perhaps the other Russians and Poles and Ukrainians decided to ignore the fact that Grigory seemed to tense up as if he'd seen the murder, and perhaps the German that was approaching him mistook his feelings as fear rather than fury. What was for certain, however, was the chaos that ensued when Grigory grabbed the nearest metal object, screamed in a voice coarse and unused, rage overfilling every inch of his body as he swung harder than he'd ever swung before.\n\nThe sickening crack that echoed through the factory was quickly drowned out by shouts and bootsteps, with the German falling to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut as Grigory unrelentingly continued. It took no less than six men to tear the murderous machine away from the man bleeding profusely on the floor, and only minutes later did silence come over the factory once again.\n\nWhen tomorrow arrived, there was one less slave working in the factory."

He was very tired, and perhaps just a bit tipsy from the liquor he drank to keep himself awake. With a yawn, he turned off the light and looked from the window at the sleeping Germania: how different it was from Hamburg, so big, so strange!\n\nStill thinking about his home, he made to leave the office, but perhaps by chance, he looked at the mirror near the room's entrance, and wished he had never done it. His figure was dark, but a single moonray illuminated the very thing that he didn't want to see: the red band with the swastika, symbol of all members of the NSDAP, including him. Disgust crept from his feet at that cursed thing and at himself for wearing it every. Single. Day. He immediately went to remove it, as if it burned, but stopped when he heard a voice.\n\n"Why are you trying to remove it?" his own reflection told him, sneering in the dark mirror, "You can't lie to yourself, you like it, admit it!"\n\nAfter a moment of complete befuddlement, he replied, anger flowing from his voice: "I don't! I'm doing it for everyone! To build a better tomorrow! I'm- oh, no... no, no, no!"\n\n"Liar" the shadows replied as they took shape behind him, a severe visage so similar to him.\n"Fa-father?"\n\n"Look at what you have done, Helmut." Gustav Ludwig Schmidt said, disappointment heavy in his aged features, "You live among them, smile at them, shake their hands! You betrayed us! You are no son of mine!"\n\n"I- I'm doing it for-"\n\n"Liar!" screamed his father, "Liar!" laughed his reflection, "Liar! Liar! Liar!" cried a thousand shadows swirling around him.\n\nWith a loud crash, the mirror went into pieces when Schmidt threw his briefcase at it, and suddenly the spell broke. Trembling, crying, the diplomat looked around himself in fear, but only silence met his gaze.

Those Slavic scum across the border of Militärbezirk Russland were unifying, preparing themselves for an invasion of Germany and the destruction of the Aryan race. Until that time came, the Feldmarschall would have to contend with grimy Russian partisans in the cities and the wilderness.\n\nThat was why he was there, after all. Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner and his brave allies were conveniently carted off to this snowy shithole by the blessing of the magnanimous Führer, where they would serve the Reich by protecting the Eastern Front from whatever insane faction managed to unite Russia. Schörner plucked the cigarette out of his mouth and spat onto the snow. He didn't know whether to be furious or flattered at being granted such an exile.\n\nThe nest of vipers that was Germania could never have prepared him for the disgusting Militärbezirk, where the German and Slav practically skipped through Moskowien hand-in-hand. What was the point in hunting down terrorists, training troops and securing the eastern border if such degeneracy was allowed in the cities? The Feldmarschall shook his head and took another puff. It was only a matter of time before miscegenation was legalized in this territory. Militärbezirk Russland deserved new leadership. Someone with the strength and courage of Schörner, with the loyalty and obedience of Remer, and with the determination displayed by their militarist clique. As for the leadership of the Reich...\n\nSchörner smirked bitterly to himself and threw his cigarette into the snow, where it hissed back at him.

Fighting outwards from the Rhine and towards Germania during the tumultuous civil war taught him a thing or two of how things could so quickly change, and how the New Order can be just as volatile and prone to collapse as any other country. Though... those things did not concern him tonight, as he waited until the clock would turn to a new day, and then he would begin the preparations.\n\nA hundred men was, perhaps, overkill, but it guaranteed the approach he was going for; a swarm of trained soldiers surrounding the facility would let them know that it was pointless to put up a fight. It was... funny, really, he thought - these same methods he despised were now the methods he was actively using to make sure no blood could be spilled, though unlike his superiors, he made sure to consider the fact that the slaves also deserved this protection. With a sigh, he brought up the megaphone near his mouth as he nearly arrived to his destination. It'd been an hour since the operation began, so he was sure everything was in place. Thinking otherwise would make him needlessly worried.\n\nIn front of the large building dominated by lights and action, an armored vehicle bearing the flag of the Reich came driving casually towards the checkpoint. Seeing something like this happen at such a late hour roused suspicion, though the guards made no moves as the vehicle stopped up in front of the facility, and a man stepped out, dressed in the colours of the Heer and bearing a megaphone in one hand. With a click of the device, it came to life, and Abel took a deep breath.\n\n"This is Hauptmann Richard Abel of the Heer speaking. To all personnel guarding this factory, and to all the slaves working in it, this is a declaration of the Reich." The guards seemed confused. "As of tonight, this facility, belonging to IG Farben, has been seized by direct orders of the Führer and will be transferred over to ownership of the government. Any attempt to fire upon the soldiers we have stationed nearby will be seen as an attack upon government troops and will be treated with extreme contempt. The security personnel present and off-duty will be relieved of their work here, and are to be escorted out of the building effective immediately." He gave a short pause to see how they would react, and upon seeing the guards freeze up and understand the message, Abel continued. "That is all." The light crackling static of the megaphone abruptly ended when he shut it off. His job here was done."

Before, he couldn't bring himself to do it, but now, after having gone through the same song and dance three times in a row with Abs' mercenaries, he was to confront his actions, and the actions of who he was serving. He'd been in that cold, cold place for so long now that the dawn of a new day began to trickle in, sunlight piercing windows and beaming on barely-worked assembly lines and hollow slaves. He should have left an hour ago, he thought.\n\nBut he didn't.\n\nThere was no armband, he could tell. Well, one that didn't bear the six-pointed star. They were all gone now, and Hauptmann Richard Abel's stomach sunk. The deeds of twenty years ago finally caught up to Europe, and where was he during that long, long time ago? When the world was on fire and he was a match waiting to be lit and thrown in, he got his opportunity to strike the flame when he, and only he, encountered something that would make or break a soldier under the banner of Aryan superiority. Abel could still remember it, clear as stars in a pitch black sky, his focus on the real world fading as his mind began to wander.\n\nIt was a family of three, a woman and her two children, though he could hardly remember what any of them looked like. They lived under the house of a Ukrainian man, right on the Donets River. He didn't speak Ukrainian and nor did the man speak German, but something about his desperation when Abel hit the butt of his rifle against the wooden floor caught him off-guard. The begging and pleading that still stuck in his mind made him relent. There, in that house, were no comrades of his back then to just shoot the degenerate Slav. Instead, he was given a choice. Would he do his duty to the Reich? Then he would be congratulated as a Jew-hunter. And what if he left them be? Then he would surely hang as a traitor to the Aryan people. It felt like an eternity before something happened - but eventually, Abel knew the path that he would take.\n\nNow he stood here, surrounded by cigarette smoke, a veteran fighter of Germany, serving for almost twenty years. Things have changed oh-so-much. He wouldn't call his country reborn, no, but the winds of change blew another direction. Yet..."

Nothing but the management of files, sorting it by the alphabet, and the long hours spent by a typewriter. From the windows near his cubicle, Erich caught a distant glimpse at the figure of Germania. Its paved roads, its Roman-style boulevards, and its almost grotesque dedication to maintaining a faint link towards a fake, imaginary past. The memories of the slave camp haunted him, not just in mind, but in his body.\n\nHalting the clacking motion of his hands, he stared at his fingers. Slender and thin, bony and almost dry, like teeth gnawing on the typewriter's buttons. He was still fragile. On a whim, he crossed his fingers together and cracked them. The words came back to him.\n\n"Please, live a little." Wessel said. No doubt, he had seen the state of Erich's apartment. Dusty, messy, dirty, and dingy.

Erich was the single agent there. The room was plain and dull, but that was understandable. Rows and rows of white, artless, and stark metal desks and chairs - with only one attendant present. A whiteboard with a map of Monowitz was before him.\n\n"Hey, Herr Fischer," the briefing instructor said, annoyed by Fischer's antics, "are you paying any attention?" He was the same as the receptionist in his hotel. Greying, boring bureaucrats in an endless waiting line for something to do. The Reich's Aryan hierarchy seemed to be an environment where men like these could live, thrive even. As opposed to the blond, eternally youthful, and blue-eyed models seen in countless propaganda posters - Erich had seen his share of those. He would tell you that none of it was accurate.\n\n"I've been there," Erich said, "done that. Why don't we make a deal, Herr Instructor." He leaned forward on one hand, putting his pencil down. "You tell me what to do, straight to the point. That way, we can get our jobs done without much more contact with one another."\n\nThat seemed to get some rise out of the man. "Deal, but one condition," he held his index finger up as if to emphasize the point he was making, "I don't hold any responsibilit-"\n\n"I got into the job knowing the risks, sir. I would not be a field agent otherwise."\n\nIgnoring Erich, the man proceeded, "You are to infiltrate the Monowitz slave camps and gather intelligence, as before. With one twist," the man pointed on the map, with pointless irony, "once you're in there, you will be contacted by an RND element within the camps. He will give you the equipment to proceed to your second task.

Once upon a time, a few months ago. The scent of sweat had formed a layer of briny smell, sickly sweet, and saltily bitter. Erich had once passed an eternity in here, but thankfully, he had a place to sit this time. Others were not so lucky. Some collapsed under the heat of a hundred bodies pressed together like sardines. Erich knew that some had died.\n\nInside the cramped, damp, and dark atmosphere of the carriage, he drew a picture of Monowitz from memory. There were the pens, the guard barracks, and finally the chemical plant. An eternity would pass, but he held onto the picture like a man clinging to driftwood amid a shipwreck. Soon. Soon.\n\nThe carriage halted, its tires screeching as it entered its port. Its doors slid open with full force, and early morning light poured into the gloom. Those who had survived the journey filed out, carrying whatever their fate had spared them to have. Erich's possessions were not much. Papers and some clothes - just enough to get a skilled laborer permit into the more humane portions of the camp. Not that that was much to speak of.\n\nThe camp's guards assembled them into two groups: one for men, one for women. Then they lined them up, and an officer sorted both ends into skilled and manual labor. Ahead, in Erich's queue, a man dressed in the most opulent uniform possible in this place flicked his fingers. Left. Left. Left. Right. Erich had heard the stories of where the left side had led to. He shuddered. He hoped his papers were enough.\n\nWhen Erich's turn came, the man's fingers flicked. Right. Erich had never breathed a greater sigh of relief. Next were the showers: a comparatively more relaxing place to go to.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Erich's old life had vanished, and only darkness awaited ahead."

He was supposed to bunk up with nine or more slaves, but his companions never arrived. It was either fate or the RND's intervention. It could be both, really.\n\nFor the first weeks, Erich worked under the alias of one Herr Hermann Dach, a supposed specialist on the operations of the chemical tools they used here. Of course, Erich knew jack about the details of his work. Then again, he would never have been a field agent if not for his expertise in the arts of mimicry.\n\nIG Farben did not go easy on its slaves. Returning to his cell, he threw his body onto the thin slice of mattress they call beds and slept. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he found, served on a platter, an enormous piece of bread. Erich's mouth watered, but its purpose was probably as both a meal and a signal to commence the operation. He tore into it, piece by piece, not wasting anything, not even the crumbs.\n\nAt last, he found a key and a map. Stopping his surfeit of ravenous appetite, he put the rusty iron key to the platter and unfolded the map. It was small, barely the size of Erich's two hands put next to each other. It was enough. Drawing Monowitz's floorplan from memory, he correlated the X on the map with a secluded corner of the yard. He turned the browning, barely consistent piece of paper over to see if he had some more information to work on.\n\n"You have 45 minutes."\n\n~P\n\nErich made for the prison cell door as quickly as he could."

The dirt seemed surprisingly loose, crumbling readily to his grasp.\n\nIn a minute, he found a black backpack buried under all those refuse. The RND had not abandoned him. He was relieved. The last time they sent him deep undercover, they did not give him anything. Erich had to perform on-site procurement for practically everything that he had needed. He was in no hurry to extend his stay at Hermann Abs' personal slave labor camp. Unzipping the bag expectantly, he peered to see what treasures lay within.\n\nErich found a tidily folded uniform, closely matching those worn by the demons of this man-made hell. A pistol with a silencer accompanied a belt stacked with a few magazines. A bolt cutter was in there as well. In a few seconds, the bag had transformed him from the fortunate but ill Hermann Dach to the most dangerous agent of the RND.

Erich had to be quick about it: in a camp as large as Monowitz, there was bound to be a lot of slave pens. Sabotaging one might be easy, but dozens of them would prove to be quite the task.\n\nRows upon rows of identical, brown barracks stretched out in front him. Erich had reached his quarry. Before him were shabby figures shambling in the shadows, laden by exhaustion and fatigue. Their silhouettes made pity rise in Erich's heart. After all, he had been here before. His ribs poked out from his uniform - an eternal reminder of what he had undergone in the name of the Reich.\n\nUnpacking his equipment near one of these brown buildings, he set to work.

Perhaps whoever behind the notes had once been an intelligence officer themselves. Their work certainly showed prowess and a penchant for executing dangerous gambits with verve and panache.\n\nHis lungs craved the puff of a cigarette. It had been too long. A week? A month, perhaps? Erich's mind had lost any semblance of time that had gone within the camp. From dawn till dusk was work, work, work. These places were not used for labor alone, but also for extermination.\n\nHe did not believe in the racial theories spat out by the Reich's bureaucrats and politicians. If they had spoken the truth, there would be no need for institutions such as these. There was no nobility in slavery. If the Führer had not been paying Erich's paycheck, he, too, could fuck off.\n\nThe time had come for a decision. The briefing had outlined the goals that Erich needed to pursue in his time working within the camp. He could follow that directive, but he could make a run for it - and no one would blame him.

Erich felt out that this place did not belong here: a spot of order and sanitation within the bowels of the most inhumane organ of the Reich.\n\nWhile he stood there, awestruck by the first signs of civilization after months (or was it weeks?) of captivity, a greeting came, from somewhere ahead. "Good evening," someone said, an innocuous phrase that shot tendrils of surprise and shock through Erich's spine. At least he did not look out of place, and his disguise worked. Returning the greeting, he strode out of view as quickly as he could. Erich was not there to test his luck. His next ordeal would require every ounce of subterfuge that he possessed in his bones, and he was not about to waste it to the indiscretion of these people.\n\nThe ammo storage was his objective. P's help with the patrols would not avail him here. He was alone, and the uniform was the thin line that separated him from discovery and danger. His clammy skin clung to it desperately, holding on for dear life. The time had come to test the value of the RND's investment into its equipment."

The solitary guards that Erich encountered before had handguns, but here, they sported rifles and submachineguns. Above, a sniper perched on a tower beaming with a spotlight, ready to pick off anyone that came near. Erich may have a handgun, some clips, and a steady hand, but frontal assault can only lead to a single end. Death.\n\nStaying out of sources of light, he reconnoitered the ammunition storage. Perhaps more information would help. The guards here would be more discerning than the ones he had passed by on his way here. It would be awkward with the two guards at the front if they saw through his disguise. There was no telling if they would let him go or shoot at him. Erich would need to trust in the RND's preparations to pass undetected. He did not want to trust them, owing to the incident a few months ago, but he would have to, to make it out of there alive.\n\nA third path was open to him, however. He could, instead of following the RND's directives, leave. No one would blame him for his sense of self-preservation; he had completed one of his objectives anyway.

Erich was compromised. He cursed the RND as he thumbed the silenced pistol holstered on his hip. His uniform did not pass muster, and he hoped to the Lord that his gun's firing mechanism would not jam on him. The ammo cache shrunk, as the feasibility of reaching it grew smaller and smaller.\n\nHis first instinct was the make a run for it. A stupid notion. The rifle and submachine gun can nail him at this distance without much effort. He had only one way, one path to survival. Like in the American Westerns he loved so much, his hands must be nimble and his fingers ready on the trigger. He drew his gun and fired.\n\nThe first shot caught the rifle guard on his eye, sending him spasming to the ground, lifeless. The second round found the submachine gunner's heart, halting him on his tracks, as he slowly collapsed to the ground, drowning in a pool of his own blood. Before Erich could revel at the work of his reflexes and skill, however, a gunshot rang out from the tower. A bullet whizzed past his head, kicking up dust and dirt behind him.\n\nFiring whatever ammunition he had left in his pistol at the sniper, Erich broke into a run. Tonight would be a lively night, to say the least."

After all, he had been through hell once, coming close to dying of overwork and starvation. Erich had given them enough, and yet, still, they demand more out of him. If he falsified his reports, no one would know. He would walk free, a man who had attempted his best to accomplish his mission for the Reich and its Führer. He would be a hero.\n\nHe walked towards the entrance of the camp, through the gates where the head guard selected which slave was a skilled worker and which wasn't. If Erich strode out of there, he would never face selection again. Avoiding any source of lights, he dodged patrols and slaves walking and hobbling in the shade. It was miles from here to an RND headquarters, but the walk was worth it. He had done his work. It was time for him to find a life that existed beyond the dangers of his job. Maybe he'll start a family, and finally settle down.\n\nHe smirked, and then laughed, voicelessly, silently. He was free. Free from the manipulations of shadow masters, from the political intrigue that had so often put his life on the line. Erich felt a longing in his lungs, a craving for cigarettes. He saw no reason not to satisfy it."

As a truck driver, his days were subject to a lot of random occurrences and events that may happen on the road, but today was satisfying. There were no roadblocks, and the traffic was silky-smooth, uncreased and uninhibited. He parked his truck near the gates of Monowitz, and chose that moment to sleep a bit, missing the cacophony that arises deep from within the slave camp. He did hear the blaring of sirens manifesting as insistent whispers of alarm, but he dismissed it. The guards would handle that\n\nA knock on his window, then silence. Then a thud, again and again. The window breaks with a shattering ring, and a man dressed in shabby guard clothes forced the cabin open. "Out!" he said, "get out!" At first, Leopold intended to resist, but meeting the muzzle of a submachinegun head-on takes a caliber of a man that Leopold wasn't. He dragged Leopold's body out, as the scream of sirens reached a fever pitch, and shouts of alarm seemed to get closer and closer.\n\n"Get down!" Leopold dropped and lied on his stomach, perfectly still. He heard the truck's tires screech, its engines hiss and whine as it shuddered awake. Leopold closed his eyes, and the muzzle flashes seemed to penetrate his eyelids. He felt his ears ring, even though he had covered them with his hands. The noises faded, and silence settled.\n\nLeopold rose to a kneeling position, and said, "Did he get away?""

Erich's guard uniform was now shabby, riddled with close calls, and steeped in his blood. He thought about suicide, the cyanide pill close to his side, residing in his pouch. Whenever he wanted to, he could bite into it, and let the poison work its way into his system.\n\nHe decided that it'd be too easy. Erich gritted his teeth. His fingers traced the contents of the pouch slung on his hip, feeling for boxy magazines that contained bullets for his submachine gun. There was one and only one. His laughter mixed with the oncoming shouts of alarm and the blaring of sirens. Somewhere, someone screams, and eddies of sobbing made his way to this barracks, Erich's bubble of quietness. For the first five minutes, it was tranquil, almost peaceful. Erich did not believe in God; his Catholicism was mostly for show. Yet, he felt an urge to pray, to repent, at the very last second. He shrugged it off.\n\nAs if on a rote habit, Erich unlatched the empty magazine from his MP5K, and loaded a fresh, new one. His hands cocked the firing mechanism, priming the gun. He trained his sights on the door and waited."

The weeks passed by in his mind: befriending his fellow skilled slave laborers, and whiling away the hours spent in pain and exhaustion with nothing but a spirit that refused to die here. Erich's memories seized him, and he stopped in his tracks, trying to push it all away.\n\nMonowitz was something personal. Erich had not wanted to go there, not at all. However, he was sure that the RND would not protect him from his enemies or even try to assassinate him. Erich was sure of it. He had accomplished whatever he was sent here to do: to facilitate a slave uprising in the Monowitz camp as best as he could.\n\nYet, he stared at the looming, bulbous chemical plant that threatened to swallow the whole eastern side of the camp. What he had done - sabotaging the locks, and rigging the arms cache to blow - was in the name of necessity. This one was personal. If only he could make it in, Erich's one remaining explosive would ensure that whatever volatile chemicals inside it would burn the plant down.\n\nHe only needed to decide whether or not to do so. It was risky, but perhaps it was worth a try."

Once he was left alone, he planted the bomb and set the time - something he was running out of. Any minute now, the charges Erich had placed within the arms cache would explode, and that would be an awkward position. He walked outside with alacrity and panic bounding within his gait. Any minute now, any minute now.\n\nHe said farewell to the guards that kept watch over that place, saying that the equipment was kept to satisfactory standards. One of them chuckled and said that he would beat the slaves senseless if they hadn't. He turned his back on them, and his walk turned into a trot, before accelerating into a gallop at the quickest pace to the nearest forest. It was a very close-run thing, and Erich did not turn even after the camp exploded and burnt behind him\n\nReaching the edges of the woods, Erich looked back and saw the fires rising high to the night sky, almost like a second sun.

Erich slipped and fell face-first into the linoleum floor, the lights in the ceiling closer to his eyes than if he had stood. He dragged himself by the steeples of his fingers, his arms fighting on where his legs had failed.\n\nErich was going to die here. There was no question as to his survival. He was sure that one of his organs had malfunctioned, and his pain-addled mind was struggling against an inevitable shutdown. Propping himself up on the side of a desk, he felt his bag for traces of the bomb. Taking it out, he examined the square package. No bullet had managed to destroy it, and he marveled at the miracle. He pulled the safeties out, and set the timer to the quickest. He won't be able to run. Erich smiled, through his blood-stained teeth, but he will wait.\n\nWhen the charges set the factory alight, Erich's body had crumpled to the ground, lifeless."

 #IG Farben HQ infiltration
 speerflavor.48.t:0 "Briefing"
 speerflavor.48.desc:0 "Erich set his pencil down and looked around him. Rows upon rows of stark, artless, and utilitarian white metal chairs and desks - yet there was only one attendant. The room was as plain as its contents. A single, rectangular lamp at the center, and a blackboard with the map of the IG Farben's Headquarters before him. He felt a compulsion to review his notes, something new to him. Rifling through the yellow-tinged, neatly-lined pages of his notebook, he read it with a kind of indolent alacrity.\n\n"Any questions," the briefing instructor said, "Herr Fischer?" The man giving him the lay-down was the very picture of Aryan vitality. That is to say, the types that the Reich's racial hierarchy helped survived and flourish. Bureaucrats with nothing to do but to endlessly recount past data and extrapolate into the future, all to no avail. Like lines washed away by the waves. If Erich were to be honest, he hated them.\n\nOn this occasion, however, he found their fastidious, annoying attention to detail useful. Even idiots with no sense of initiative and foresight could find work in the RND. "Say," he said to the instructor, keeping the tone as level and cool as his head, "can you summarize, briefly, what I am to do here? We both know we need to get back to work quickly, so the sooner the better, sir."\n\n"In brief, what you are sent there to do is to intelligence gathering," the instructor said, pointing pointlessly at the map, "but the risk is incredibly high. If IG Farben were to discover you, the RND has never had you as its employee."\n\n"What kind of intelligence?"\n\n"Account books, implications of customer abuse, violations of the labor laws, that sort of thing."\n\n"Sounds like a dull assignment."\n\n"Oh," the man seemed struck with Erich's cockiness, "I assure you, nothing about this assignment is dull. Now, Herr Wessel has granted you a lot of leeways to choose your moment. When will it be?""

 speerflavor.49.desc:0 "The headquarters of IG Farben was a truly massive building, and Erich had a vague idea of how much Hermann Josef Abs wanted to drive the point home that he was a powerful businessman. It was barely illuminated under the pale moonlight, but the front of the building was fixed with a bright light, showing three guards, all armed with fully-automatic rifles, patrolling and standing guard. It was not as heavy security as Erich expected it to be, but then again, it was merely the entrance. The inside, he was certain, would be far less forgiving.\n\nHe was already fond of nature before, but he was even more fond of it when it allowed him to sneak from the side and crouch towards the front, thanking his training that allowed him to move quietly across the grass. When he got near the entrance, Erich sunk back into the shadows as a guard passed him by, and prayed to whatever deity was watching as he moved out towards were momentarily unoccupied as all three guards were to busy patrolling the street in front to pay attention to the man rapidly walking up the stairs and towards the set of glass doors.\n\nAlready his brow furrowed with sweat as the doors swung open and closed behind him with a silent, but still painful creak. Then his eyes flicked upwards and spotted the outline of a camera on the other side of the room, beginning to turn to where he was. With quick reactions, Erich leaped to the nearest pillar and dragged himself down it before sitting on his behind, letting out a sigh of relief. Already, he risked failure. But then again, he had no room to complain."

 speerflavor.50.t:0 "An Unreliable Lackey"
 speerflavor.50.desc:0 "There was not only one camera there, but two. Thankfully, after waiting for a few minutes, Erich managed to slip past both of them as he went up the stairs and climbed to the second floor of the building. The first, he knew, would not provide anything to him. The second, however, had the possibility of giving incriminating evidence. At least, that's what he was told. Opening a door, Erich listened in before moving into an empty office cubicle, getting down under the desk as his ears perked up. He wasn't alone in this place. There were more guards here. Two more, judging by the footsteps of one farther ahead and the talking of one closer to him. He let a minute pass before he moved out.\n\nErich knew that he wouldn't find anything in these cubicles, so he had to search for an office. When he crossed the short hallway separating one set of cubicles from another, he felt his chest tighten as one of the guards rounded the corner to the hallway he had left moments before. Had Erich been a second slower, he would've been caught. Circling around the large room, he spotted a few more rooms to the side, but one caught his interest.\n\nWaiting until the footsteps turned stiff and then turned silent off in the distance, Erich pushed open the glass door and read the nameplate that was on the desk.\n\n'RHINELAND REGIONAL OVERSEER'."

 speerflavor.51.desc:0 "The good news was that he had all the time in the world to discover what was inside the office. The bad news was that he had to look through the office, while also not drawing attention to himself. Erich knew the overseer's office had a camera in the corner, and every time it passed by him, he was tempted to bite his lip. The RND promised him that some cameras in the building would've been sabotaged - rolling the same footage throughout the night, as an example, which would give him infinite breathing room. They had even been so kind as to mark out which cameras were sabotaged, and which were not. All Erich hoped for was the Reich was wise enough to not underfund the agency's equipment. Oh, how he hoped.\n\nThe things he discovered during his tenure in the overseer's office was... quite interesting, to say the least. For everything related to the Rhineland, practically the industrial metropolis of the Reich, the numbers purported in several of the documents that Erich looked over... did not align with what IG Farben reported. In essence, what were lucrative trade deals and massive investments coupled with generous loans and promises of high quality products were all much less than expected. Such ideas would dig heavily into IG Farben's budget, but promising them would mean an injection of funds from the government, and an increase in business dealings.\n\nNot bad, Erich thought. They were effectively ripping off millions, and these papers could potentially mean at least a partial incrimination of IG Farben's staff. The question, however, remained.\n\nWas this enough?"

It wasn't Hitler's empire, but... the flicker of good came in steps at a time.\n\nThe moment Erich stepped out of the office, however, he heard something that nearly shot his heart from his chest. A loud, piercing noise that went from ear to ear, and then a shout. The RND failed to do what they were meant to do.\n\n"ALARM!"\n\nErich had to act fast. Any moment of hesitation and he would've been dead. Drawing his silenced pistol, he rushed towards the exit of the room and narrowly avoided one of the guards passing him by. They didn't hear his own footsteps while the alarm blared, it seemed. When Erich looked down the half-spiral staircase down to the lobby, however, he spotted bad news.\n\nTwo guards from the outside made their ways in, and both split paths up either set of stairs. Quickly, Erich huddled himself into the corner, pressing his body against himself as tightly as he could, and waited for the booted footsteps of a man with killing intent to pass by him and into the room he had just left.\n\nBrimming with sweat, he practically flew out of the exit, spotting a guard on the outside that was approaching the building.

When he sneaked out of the overseer's office, he made his way to the nearest stairway, and spotted a guard standing like a stone statue near it. He was stuck from moving forward, and he had to act quickly, because the guard on the other side would be making his rounds to here, too - then he would be pincered.\n\nTravelling to a nearby cubicle, Erich spotted a book that hung off of the edge of the desk. It was a thick book, and Erich took a deep breath as he pressed down and heard it slam to the floor with a loud thud. Quicker than the footsteps he heard approaching, Erich returned and hid under the nearby desk, covered in darkness as he saw a pair of legs move past him.\n\nWith a deep breath, he moved his way out and practically rushed to the stairway, silently climbing up the steps and into the third floor. Here there were four guards, he could tell, and once again it was his job to find what he needed on this floor. Then, as he made his way to the right, he spotted it. A crown jewel."

Wasting no time, he hurried his way over to the office before any of the guards had a say in his actions, and made sure to neatly close the door behind him as he saw yet another camera flick back and forth. He put a lot of trust into the RND. Perhaps too much. With a sigh, he began to flip between pages, records, drawers, and the many other things in this office.\n\nEntire minutes passed. He was slowed down heavily by the constant footsteps outside, as he refused to risk entry by means of them hearing the noise inside. Eventually, however, Erich found out a strong curiosity that overshadowed what he had found a floor lower. Records that spoke about Abs' transactions; he was a rich man, perhaps the richest man on the globe, and Erich had a feeling that not all of his wealth was legitimate. Where Abs was supposed to pay the government hefty sums in taxes, he had found loopholes and falsified statements about his income, effectively slashing the money he had to pay to niceties.\n\nErich greedily took the documents with him, adding them to the collection of what he had already gathered previous. With these, he could make for a strong case against IG Farben, and for all intents and purposes, he had done more than enough. He had all the reason in the world to leave, but one piece of information still eluded him. The personal office of Hermann Josef Abs. Would he take the risk, bringing him into almost certain death, or would he remain content with what he had taken, and to return to the RND as capable and clever?

He was wide awake, and his senses on the ready. As he passed cubicle by cubicle, the sound of footsteps drew closer and closer, and Erich knew that more time spent waiting was more time for gaps of error to show. He had to act decisively, and he took a risk by looking out towards the hallway nearby to see if anyone was walking down, and there was. Moving back, he was thankful the guards were tired, as it seemed like that guard didn't notice him poking his head out. When he passed, Erich moved.\n\nThere was another door that he slipped by, and then a set of stairs. Dim, blue light and colorless concrete stairs were his only ally as he made his way up, passing by the fifth floor and then the sixth. Before he reached the seventh, however, there was a sudden conundrum. He heard more footsteps - this time coming from above him. Erich's mind was thrown into a panic for a moment, but he readjusted himself. He was expecting another person, but the guard was not. And so he got up the steps, standing right at the edge, when the guard rounded the corner. Right into Erich's grasp.\n\nWith a lunge, he wrapped his arms around the guard's neck and threw him to the guard, keeping him restrained with what the agency taught him, and using every muscle in his body that the RND forced him to develop. It wasn't difficult to overpower the man, and, after almost ten seconds, he felt him lose consciousness. Dragging his body to a corner, Erich continued moving upwards, knowing he was on a time limit that would kill him if it ran out.

The shrill noise of an alarm blared throughout the floor, and voices reverberated from the cubicles and hallways to him. "ALARM!" Was what Erich heard, and he felt a hint of betrayal. The damn RND said that the camera in the accountant's office was sabotaged, and he knew he hadn't been spotted by any of the guards. The ticking timer now turned into a bomb fuse, and Erich had only one way out.\n\nSlamming open the door with his elbow, he quickly made his way down the staircase, but encountered unpleasant resistance along the way. Fortunately, Erich shot first, and the guard only managed to fire one off-balanced shot that pained his ears as he fell on the ground. That would've attracted everyone else, he thought, and it did nothing to ease his worries.\n\nErich began to continue moving down the staircase - he would go to the first floor and pass through the doors in the lobby to the outside, he thought. Then he heard the door of the second floor creak behind him as he was halfway down, and Erich knew he only had moments to respond.

Maximum security was to be employed, and maximum response, too. Instead, he listened in and observed. From here, he could see Abs' office clearly, and the inside was lavish. Paintings hung from the wall he could see, and while he was no art collector, Erich had a feeling they were quite valuable. Elsewhere, Hermann Josef Abs himself was present, talking kindly to two other figures. The first was Friedrich Flick, and the other was Edmund Geilenberg.\n\nWith a puff of his cigar, Abs grinned. "Not to worry, dear friends. Speer and his pitiful Gang may think of us enemies, but we have influence abound. So long as we remain cooperative, things will go our way. As they had under the previous Führer." Geilenberg took in his words and spoke nothing, while Flick merely raised an eyebrow. "So certain of that?" He asked, and Abs shrugged. "I wouldn't trust these resources that we have pooled as of right now. I have some... connections that I can pull. Most importantly, extremely efficient and highly drilled troops that could do a variety of tasks. Defending, attacking..."\n\n"You mean to tell me you've hired a mercenary company?" Abs cut in, blowing smoke as he kept his smile. Flick looked puzzled for a second.

Wessel's voice came out like a news reporter would speak from a teleprompter, yet Erich could still feel the pride in it as he stood tall, looking towards the agents in their seats who stared at him with glimpses of respect and awe, though nothing further.\n\nHis mind wandered back to the previous nights when he had finally returned to the agency. With everything and more accomplished, Erich was dispatched to meet personally with Gerhard Wessel. That night was one of the stranger nights he had experienced, dealing with a man who showed little emotion and was known as being ruthlessly efficient. Yet when he had handed over what he had found, the man was surprised, shocked and - dare he think it - amazed. They discussed in length everything that was discovered, and, by the end of the night, Erich was promised a reward.\n\n"To Agent Erich Fischer, for his outstanding bravery and skill, will be rewarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves." The clapping began unanimously as Erich shuffled slightly and waited for Wessel to walk over and pin the medal to his shirt. He was no fan of the Iron Cross, and practically disgusted by the swastika embedded into it, but a medal was a medal, and he didn't think of Wessel to care much about the Nazi machine. This victory wasn't of Hitler's cronies and successors. Not of Speer's. It was the success of him, his agency, and the people that would have easier lives when IG Farben was gone.\n\nWhen Wessel pinned the medal, he gave the slightest nod to Erich, who returned it in kind. The ceremony did not last long afterwards, and eventually the agents dispersed to continue their work. The RND was not a place to lounge around, after all. And neither was it in Erich's spirit. Even if he had done of the most dangerous tasks assigned to him, he still had work to do."

 speerflavor.65.t:0 "An Architect's Blues"
 speerflavor.65.desc:0 "Another day, another cartload of problems... In his office at the center of the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer, Führer of the German people, is tired; tired and stressed. Even after the war's end, there's no rest: the reconstruction is proving more difficult than predicted, and the party bureaucracy is already starting to resist the changes suggested by the Gang of Four. Like the proverbial clay pot, Speer feels powerless to act, a small raft engulfed by the stormy sea. Taken by the sudden need to escape, he stands from his chair and goes to the window: perhaps it will do him some good to gaze at the great Germania he himself designed?\n\nLooking outside, a wave of memories surges from Speer's mind, snippets of a life that was a mere decade ago, and yet feels as if it was another geological era: showing Hitler the progress made as the two friends laugh heartily, visiting construction sites, directing the workforce, and finally the Volkshalle's inauguration, the crowning moment of his life as an architect. It was a different age, one where the future looked glorious, not this... maddening quagmire.\n\nThe more he looks at what he built, however, the more a feeling of dread creeps over him: why is that building over there still unfinished? Why is that apartment block so bare, the slots for the decorations are all empty! More than anything, who is that incompetent who used low-quality stone for the walkways?! They are already full of cracks! As he finds more and more critiques, he also feels something else, a need he had not felt in years: he wants to correct those mistakes, to make them right, but even more, he wants something... new. His hands itch with the need to design, to give tangible form to the things in his mind! How wonderful it would feel to be once more, even if just for a moment, Speer the architect! However, what is an architect without his tools?"
 speerflavor.65.a:0 "Note to self: bring the tools to the office tomorrow."

 speerflavor.66.t:0 "Back to Work!"
 speerflavor.66.desc:0 "As everyone, except the security, leaves the Reichskanzlei, a single light is still on. In the Führer's office, there's still someone working for the good of the German people, or at least this is what the headlines will report, because putting a sign on the door saying "Architekt bei der Arbeit, Zugang verboten" would be a bit misleading...\n\nWith his work completed, the Führer can finally punch out, and let the architect take his place. Speer clears his desk and takes his tools out of the case he had brought from his home: they are old, but they still work, just like him, and that's more than enough! He has awaited this moment for the entire day, and as he looks at the large, empty sheet, he feels like a painter staring at a blank canvas, ready to fill it with his art: all kinds of ideas swim through his mind, from tall, bold skyscrapers to simple houses and small villas. With a trembling hand, he takes up ruler and pencil, and draws the first line.\n\nThe first sheet goes straight to the dustbin, followed by the second and the third. Trembling lines and small blunders irk the perfectionist inside Speer, but more than five years of inaction require some time to catch up. The fourth sheet, however, survives the initial scrutiny: in the end, he has settled on a public office, a classic of his old practise. As the jumbling mess of lines seemingly drawn randomly acquires purpose, and forms itself into the skeleton of a building, a smile creeps itself on Speer's lips: he is finally free from the stress, from the obligations, from the quagmire, doing what he loves!\n\nAfter a while, the architect stretches his arms and looks at his work. The essential frame, the easiest part, is done, now it's time to start the real work! He looks at his watch, and jumps: it's already past midnight! Best going to sleep, or tomorrow work will be a pain... As he goes home, however, he can't help but wonder: will his newest design ever become reality, or will it remain a small closet dream, one to be put in a museum after his death?"

 speerflavor.67.t:0 "An Artist's Dilemma"
 speerflavor.67.desc:0 "The architect looks with satisfaction at his work. The foundations and the main frame of the building he has been painstakingly designing are done and ready to be built: from the quality of the concrete to the exact amount of steel bars needed to sustain the edifice, everything is specified with pinpoint precision in several side notes written in regular handwriting. Now, all it remains is the façade, and this is where the true challenge begins.\n\nWith a sigh, Speer realizes that he never bothered resuming his theoretical studies after he became entangled in the Rechtspolitik - trying to survive in a world where most of your "colleagues" want to kill you is, after all, quite the demanding task - and now he curses himself for not having updated his knowledge. How is he supposed to finish his new masterwork? What will be the final stroke on the canvas?\n\nLooking outside for inspiration, he sees once more his greatest success... with all its flaws and mistakes. Would it be best to follow in his own footsteps, and use the style that forged Germania into what it is now? To act as if nothing changed in the last ten years? For a moment, he thinks of the new, grand structures built in the United States, with their new lines and glass walls: is the future the way forward? To fully let go of the past and find a new beginning?\n\nWith a last look to the Volkshalle, a final thought enters his mind: what if a third way is indeed possible? A fusion of old and new, of past knowledge and future design, a melting pot where both ideals would have to make a small sacrifice for the sake of art... As the Führer-Architekt takes pencil and ruler once more, he has made his decision."

 speerflavor.68.t:0 "The Old Lion Still Roars!"
 speerflavor.68.desc:0 "Yes! All his art has always been for the glory of the Vaterland, and his new design will follow the same rules! With passion, he starts designing the grand façade: it will be a tall, large entrance way with stone walls and columns reminiscing of the Roman temples he so highly admired in his youth, with a staircase leading to the door. Who needs steel and glass, the strength and raw solidity of stone are enough to impress the viewer, just as it did ever since mankind learnt how to sculpt it into the shapes it desired!\n\nOf course, a public building required to always remind those who entered it of its function. The central pediment will sport a single, giant swastika overlooking the entrance, and atop the pediment a tall eagle will spread its wings over the German people, just as the Vaterland spread across the globe in the wake of its victories. Eagles' heads would regularly jut out of the walls, holding banners or other symbols of National Socialism, praising the strength of the German nation and its many virtues.\n\nWith the finishing touches done, the architect looks at his masterpiece with satisfaction. He hasn't yet lost his touch after all! Finally standing and stretching his arms, he takes a last look to the great Germania, and finally, he sees it for what it is, his greatest success, perfect as it is! There is no conflict between architect and Führer, for both shall bring the Reich to new heights of power and prominence, as it was before, and as it ever shall be!"
 speerflavor.68.a:0 "Heil me!"

 speerflavor.69.t:0 "Out With the Old, In With the New"
 speerflavor.69.desc:0 "Looking one final time at the city he had designed from top to bottom, Speer finally realizes one thing. His ideals, his beliefs, his convictions are still there, they aren't gone, but he can see with his eyes how the first attempt at their implementation has gone: just like Germania, the Reich is a rotting corpse, and it will take a shock therapy to bring it back to life. One day, Germany will be once more at the forefront - no, it will be at the top - but only after sweeping changes have been accomplished. How can a small architect like himself change the tide with a pencil and a ruler?\n\nSlowly, his design starts to reflect his state of mind: the façade is clean, sharply cut, large glass window framed by black steel architraves, everything in stark contrast to the stone walls and colonnades of his own Reichskanzlei. As his building takes a shape so different from everything he has ever done, he feels a slight insecurity, like a child leaving his mother's embrace to swim on his own for the first time: he's leaving behind his old work, to create something he never thought to create, in a shape he never thought to give, so different from his initial plans; and yet, he knows this is what needs to be done.\n\nAs another evening turns into night, the architect finishes his work. With a last look to his old creations outside the window, and to his newest addition on his desk, Speer understands with painful clarity that he can no longer return to his old art: so much has changed in so little time, so much to learn, so much that he has forgotten. In his sadness, however, there's the seedling to a new relief: he's not done yet, there's one last thing he needs to do before putting his tools to rest.\n\nThe Reich will be born anew, a shining beacon of modernity! Perhaps it won't be the same Germany he had dreamt about in his youth, perhaps such a dream was never supposed to turn into reality, but he'll fight for his nation nonetheless, as he has always done."
 speerflavor.69.a:0 "The future is now, I guess..."

 speerflavor.70.t:0 "Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis!"
 speerflavor.70.desc:0 "As Speer reflects upon his choice, suddenly the truth dawns upon him. Didn't the Romans take the arch from the Etruscans? The columns from the Greeks? Didn't they study the Egyptians and their stylized forms? Yes. Did this make them any less Romans? No! On the contrary, they grew with everything they learnt, every new notion, concept, technique they absorbed! They didn't accept passively the foreign influences, but neither did they remain closed in their own little world: they assimilated all following their own criteria, everything put into the perfect place for it to shine brightest!\n\nThe solution, the breakthrough Speer needed is there! The architect resumes his work, his mind a melting pot. Slim, graceful stone columns hiding the steel inside them, just like his new Germany. Beautiful and proud, a steel gauntlet inside a velvet glove. The glass would take new forms, curved and elegant, fitting into the façade's fronton and reflecting the light into a majestic eagle holding the laurel of victory. A rainbow of colors, mitigated by the pure white of the stone, would marvel the visitors without scaring them, a comforting feeling of brightness and warmth.\n\nAs the first rays of morning relieve his tired eyes, the architect-turned-Führer can't help feeling satisfied. This time, perhaps the first in his entire life, he has created something entirely new: a new style, a new fashion! Perhaps it will never take foot, but it doesn't matter: an artist works for himself first and foremost, and he finally understands that he is, indeed, still an artist. Now, a new work awaits him, his masterwork, the coronation of his craft: to rebuild the Reich! To rebuild it into what it was always meant to be, a nation fully capable of embracing future without forgetting the past! As the cleaning staff opens the door and jumps seeing the Führer still inside, Speer greets them with a wide grin: this is a great day for Germany, the first of many to come! A new dawn, a wonderful dawn!"

 #Speer goes cray

 speerflavor.71.t:0 "Fissive Cracks"
 speerflavor.71.desc:0 "Benno Ohnesorg was dead. That news was already bad enough. What made it ten times worse was the news Speer got immediately following the murder, and he felt both disgust and anger rise in him when he found out.\n\nThe student movement grew a spine and the slaves grew consciousness. They had cast their die and crossed their Rubicon. Now they were not merely protesting, but also clashing with the police. In the streets of Germany, cameras rolled by state-controlled and underground journalists showing the mass panic that rippled through the cities, and the brutality exchanged between police and the rioters-turned-revolutionaries, stoked the growing fear across the nation. It was not received well by the public at large, but Speer received it worse. The slaves - and everyone else associated with them - needed to know their place.\n\nHe did not consult the Gang to make his decision. He had no need to - the next time he held his speech in the cold, dim Volkshalle, he made it clear. The streets would be filled with officers armed with guns. Live ammunition or otherwise. Silence dominated with the occasional approval from those who listened to him, and he met the Gang with cold silence - especially Schmidt, the brazen rat he had no patience dealing with. He knew what he'd say, and he didn't want to hear it.\n\nFor as many concessions as he gave to the pitiful reformist elements that backed him up for so long, he knew he could not disappoint his mentor by giving in to their every demand. It would only bring ruin to Speer's vision. After all, this was the Führer's crisis to solve."

 speerflavor.72.desc:0 "Nothing was getting better. The Ehrentribüne was burning, and Speer could only watch. Clearly, the military police he had sent in did nothing to alleviate the anger the rioters felt. The rambunctious fools. The idealistic, short-sighted, animalistic fools. All they knew was chaos and panic, and here they were, burning down one of his most prized constructions. There were so, so many memories in that place. Glory echoed its field, but now it was empty; and did anything good come of it?\n\nPerhaps one thing. Speer's realization that these fools could not be dealt with in peace. He had given them a chance to take the olive branch, and they merely spit on his hand. Now he was in his office - and here stood a member of the Gang. "Minister of War, Henning von Tresckow." Speer coldly called, and Tresckow stood tall, unflinching, gazing at the Führer with an emotionless stare. "The Minister of the Interior is busy, so I'll pass this responsibility onto you. This revolt has gone too far. These madmen must learn what martial law is like."\n\nTresckow shifted uncomfortably. "Herr Speer, I-"\n\nNot a second more did he continue when Speer cut in, quickly and harshly. "That was an order, Henning von Tresckow, and you WILL listen to it. The time for playing games with your liberal demands is over. Germany burns, and I will destroy this alliance before I let this horde burn the rest down like the barbarians pillaged Rome. So I advise you to listen." He couldn't see it, but Tresckow's hands behind his back were clutching against each other tightly, and his finely-cut nails scraped against his skin in anxiety.\n\n"Alright, then," he said, giving a short nod. "Is there anything else you want me to do?"\n\nWas Speer looking at him or through him? He couldn't tell.\n\n"No, Herr Tresckow. I want you to focus all of your attention on this. They will learn the values of violence and discipline. The whip will crack, and..." Speer's fists trembled. "They will learn. As a Prussian, I'm certain you agree." Tresckow's face said anything but. "Now go. You are dismissed.""

He didn't have to read them, of course, he knew exactly what direction this revolt would go. They would push and push, and the Wehrmacht would push back, until finally, the Aryan heel would stomp down and annihilate the petty resistance as the revolt gave way to the New Order. The thought soothed his mind a little, but he was still bitter with anger, and a certain someone kept trying to push him down another road.\n\n"My Führer-" Schmidt began, and Speer took no chances, slamming a fist against the desk and glaring at him with rageful, tired eyes.\n\n"This nonsense AGAIN?!" He said, stirring himself into anger. "Helmut Schmidt, know your place. I've spent the past two decades trying to move past web after web, and now you're constantly biting at my ankles, here and there. Who do you think I am, Schmidt? Some sort of peace-loving liberal scum? Perhaps you are, but I am far from such a thing."\n\nSchmidt ground his teeth together, feeling his breathing become heavier. "I've advised you, time and time again, that clashing with the slaves would ruin our international image!"\n\n"To hell with our international image! You..." Speer's eyes narrowed towards Schmidt. "You... lying in bed with the Reichsbanner, aren't you?" Schmidt felt his stomach churn, and he stepped away. "I should have seen this earlier. I should've realized a decade ago. You are more than just some pathetic liberal. I know who you are now, Schmidt - you are a rat! A RAT!" Speer kicked back his chair and stood up, almost frothing at the mouth. "Get out of my office!

Then the tremors returned, and Speer raised his head to look up at the maps on his desk. Here was Germany, powerful and strong, a population of more than a hundred million, built on success after success, and with his guiding hand would steer it into the future. In the east, it was all stripes and circles. The slaves. The whelps. The Untermenschen. They had taken so much territory now, and again and again his Aryan people failed him. He would not allow it. No, no, no, no, no. The Führer was no longer Adolf Hitler - it was Albert Speer. He held the power now. He called the shots. All he had to do was make the call. Make the call... make the call...\n\nMake the call.\n\nPapers and office equipment clattered to the floor, and Speer slammed open a drawer, pulling a pen out. The map of Europe remained, and he began scribbling it. Just like when he was back with Hitler, when strategies would be described. He punctured holes into the map to signify where the tanks would blitz. He scribbled across whole areas that would be carpet bombed. Oh, they would learn their place. By gun, bullet, fire, tank. He didn't care what the rest of the world thought. Germany was the master of the world, and everyone else would bend the knee. "And him..." He muttered, voice grazing against his throat with hoarse pain. His eyes flicked to Germany.\n\nSpeer let out a short, raw chuckle. "Helmut Schmidt. You, you Jew. You little Zionist puppet. How I'll see you hang.. m-maybe I'll..." He reached in a hand and barely wrapped his fingers around the grip as he pulled the pistol out, and it clattered weakly on the table. "Yes... yes, that's what I'll do. I don't need to sign papers. I'll just do it myself!" He laughed harder this time, and he furiously drew on the map, a line here, a circle there.

So he anxiously waited for something - and that something came.\n\nWhen Albert Speer received the news that Willy Brandt was now in support of the Slave Revolt, his mind went into a white haze of rage. Without thinking, he tore the classified document in half, and reached for his gun. He knew where Helmut Schmidt was, and within minutes he knew the Jew would be dead. If only Speer had the patience to give him something worse.\n\nStorming out of his office, he began walking directly to Schmidt's office with only one thing on his mind, but something stopped him. In the dim shadows of the Reichskanzlei he could hear footsteps behind him. Before he could turn around, pain shot through his arms as hands grabbed on tightly, and in front of him walked Reinhard Gehlen. "What the hell are you doing, Gehlen?!" He screamed. "No... you know, you know! What do you know?!"\n\nGehlen gave a small smile as he recovered a thick document and a lighter in each hand. "My Führer." There was no weight to that word.

Here," he continued, flicking the lighter open near the paper, "is your freedom. Choose wisely, Herr Speer. One will end you. The other will free you."\n\nSpeer could barely see anything past unfocused shapes, but he could hear crisply what the man said. His strength failed him as he attempted to break free. "He set you up, didn't you?" He asked, and Gehlen raised an eyebrow. "Schmidt - he did it, he brought you here, he knew what'd happen, didn't he? Didn't he?!" Fury filled his cracking voice, and all he could think about was how Schmidt would look with a bullet in his brain. "Schmidt!" His lungs pained him. "Schmidt!"

Sometimes that woman who talked to him in the factory visited here and there, and they talked. They would talk about current things happening, and she was like a source of information. He learned things outside of his simple life - how the world was in turmoil, how Germany was making this sweeping change and passing this outstanding law.\n\nHow they were still treacherous bastards, and how things would never remain the same, and how day-by-day, things only grew tenser.\n\nAntonin knew it would happen. In fact, he was waiting for it. When he received a pair of knocks on his door, he closed the book in his hands that was about the great Slavic migration into Eastern Europe, and unbolted the chain, letting it open slightly so that he could look outside. "Yes?" His old, unused voice asked, and he could see it.\n\nTwo men in uniforms-- and the sign of the Polish Home Army. "Greetings, Antonin Grzywacz. We're here on behalf of the Free Europe army." In his hands he held a rifle that harkened back to old times.\n\n"Will you fight, sir?" The man's face was hard, but sympathetic. "There will be no work for you tomorrow."\n\nAntonin knew that well.\n\n"But I can understand it if you wish to remain here."\n\nSlowly, Antonin unbolted the door completely, and let it open wide. He was old, perhaps even frail, but... Antonin shook his head.\n\n"No, son," he began, holding his hands out. The soldier nodded, and handed him the rifle. "I can still fight. Er..."

He was a young boy in Poland... oh, how lovely the fields were all up until the point where they weren't. He grew from a boy into a teenager and from a teenager into a man, and he had settled down with a beautiful girl he knew from across his home - and they had raised three children, one who was just a bit slow but it didn't matter to him nor to her and it never bothered the child's siblings. They had all been beautiful.\n\nHad been beautiful. Then, for the past twenty years, Antonin was a hollow man. The Nazis had taken everything from him, grinding his family into dust and ashes and only spitting him out, untainted yet broken. How he longed for death and for the relentless pain in his mind that followed him day after day. Then things had begun changing. Finally, perhaps, the German was showing mercy. Something else that wasn't sheer cruelty, monstrosity, bloodshed. He had met a man who sparked the flame known as friendship with him, and he was a German. What was his name... he couldn't remember.\n\nThen, one day, they had finally given him his freedom. And at home he met another woman. Her name was Anna, and she was fierce, perhaps a bit younger than him but he had been working up the courage to ask her to go on a date with him. Now he laughed about it, and then drew in a sharp breath. The bullet lodged in his stomach made his body numb and his sight fuzzy, and God how he had hoped that some Nazi would have walked in and put him out of his misery or that some tank rolled over him, or an artillery shell blowing his body into pieces.\n\nNo such thing. No such thing - and no help would ever come. He was abandoned by the frontline, and it had long since moved past him. Long into the night, when his consciousness began fading, Antonin cried. For as much as he wished for death, he was truly afraid of it. He didn't want to let go, even if the pain was overbearing, but reality caught up to him. By the time the sun rose, Antonin was dead."

Everyone, listen closely. Th-the Reichsbanner managed to haggle with the Germans - we get to go home!"\n\n"What?!"

Her expression sombered, though her smile remained. "Antonin..." She trailed off, as she could notice that he had an anxious look on his face.

Jewish personalities are embedded in all sectors of society: from banks to industry to science, the amount of people openly or covertly swearing their allegiance to the six-pointed star of David and Judas is staggering.\n\nAs such, it's only natural that the relatively new field of physics would immediately be infected by such a plague. From Albert Einstein to Enrico Fermi, the false doctrine of Jüdische Physik has tried to subvert science from the inside, spreading false beliefs on how the very fabric of the world was structured. It was only a matter of time before the true Aryans would try to cleanse universities and scientific institutes from this filth, and replace it with the true science, the Aryan science!\n\nFrom this cauldron of national pride and racial superiority was Deutsche Physik born, a titanic effort aimed at replacing the decadent and corrupt Jüdische Physik with a doctrine that truly answered the great questions of our time. However, National Socialism wasn't alone in his quest for truth, and many had already tried, even on their own, to refute such false beliefs on the ground of Aryan rationality. From Hanns Hörbiger's Glazial-Kosmogonie in 1912, many other enlightened intellectuals, such as Nobel laureates Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark understood the need to compile and organize a pure scientific community along the party-approved line of Gleichschaltung, a hierarchical coordination based on adherence to the official doctrine of National Socialism."

 speerflavor.80.desc:0 "For almost three decades, Deutsche Physik was the proverbial stone guest at all scientific meetings in the Reich. While the overwhelming majority of all academic institutions believed such theory with the same fervor a policeman believes the excuses of someone caught pickpocketing, they were forced to keep their criticism for themselves as the Deutsche Physik had been officially embraced by the NSDAP, and counted personalities such as Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler themselves among its staunchest supporters: to denounce its falsehood meant being branded as a "Juden-freunde" and subsequently purged. As such, an uneasy peace had been struck between the universities and the party leadership: the former would abstain from openly refuting the theory, while the latter would abstain from sending the most esteemed professors to the concentration camps as enemies of the state, especially since their minds were needed for the war effort more than their arms would be in any slave factory.\n\nAfter Himmler's exile and Hitler's death, and with the new Führer set on a more moderate approach to science and politics, the scientific community is once more in upheaval, and many feel that the day of reckoning has finally come. A scientific council has been convened in Germania, where the most prominent academics from the entire Reich will be present to discuss the future of science in this new era for Germany and the world. Even more importantly, the opening event will be a strong, official rebuttal of the entire doctrine of Deutsche Physik, to be branded as a 'delirium inspired by racial hate and intellectual deficiency'. In its place, the council will ask for the scientific community to be regulated by merit and experience, rather than boot-licking and party allegiance."

 speerflavor.81.desc:0 "As predicted, the news of the Grand Scientific Council of Germania has created an uproar in the NSDAP, with the reformist welcoming an opportunity to finally let go of another part of Hitler's embarrassing legacy, and the conservatives accusing the scientific council of going against party doctrine, which in their opinion is akin to high treason. Already letters are piling on the Führer's desk, asking him to officially support one side or the other, and the amount is getting close to the alarm threshold: should Speer refuse to take action, it will be interpreted as a sign of weakness, and he can't afford such a thing!\n\nForced to take action, the Führer stops to reflect. Preventing the council from happening is absolutely out of the question, as it will enrage the universities that were his first and largest support base during the Bürgerkrieg, and now are the fundamental pillar upon which to build a new Reich, filling the technological gap separating the country from the other world powers.\n\nAs it stands, there are only two possible choices: the first is to cave in to the conservatives without angering the scientists, which would mean completely ignoring the council and act as if it never happened, a safe choice in difficult times; the second is to openly support the reformists, and attending the council in person, thus sending a clear message to everyone about the new course the Reich is being set on.

At the very center of the Volkshalle, a hemicycle of chairs houses the Reichstag in full extraordinary session, with an adorned armchair topped by a golden eagle at its front for the Führer himself; the scientists will be accomodated in rows upon rows of chairs, with a long, frontal desk for the deans and other directors.\n\nEveryone is in their place, in a perfect choreography directed by the expert eye of Leni Riefenstahl behind the lens of her trusted Olympia-Kanone. At the given signal, everyone stands as the Führer arrives from the Halle's main entrance, the crowd parting for him like the Red Sea before Moses, until he takes his place: with the brightest mind of the Reich before him, and the Reichstag behind him, he addresses the entirety of the German people.\n\n"Citizens of Germania, today marks a new dawn! After long years of exile inflicted upon them by fools and charlatans, we welcome science, rationality and enlightenment back into our fold, never to let it go a second time!"\nA round of applause, then he resumes: "I wanted to be present to this historical day, to let our esteemed researchers and academics know that their plight has been noted by our government: their bright minds, unparalleled skill and selfless dedication to the cause of science shall pave the way for our country to resume its place among the great nations of Earth!"\n"Let science be one with National Socialism as it was meant to be, free from the shackles imposed by envious men who believed they could decide whether innovation was pure or not!

However, the council got almost no media coverage, and its results were publicated only by scientific journals and publications, with the result that, for all intents and purposes, the larger public never knew of its existence, which was exactly what the Führer wanted.\n\nIn the end, he managed to keep the party united by adopting the line of 'less resistance' and, while some reformists were disappointed by his move, and some conservatives were still angry over the fact that the gathering was allowed to happen, no one could truly complain much: the scientists had secured their grand congress, and the conservatives had ensured it would amount to nothing in the political sphere, a perfect result for everyone!"

A few reichsmarks would have served him well, but to the surprise of no one, he only made enough to buy himself the barest amount of food possible. As his thin and worried frame entered through the door of the office, he could hear the rolling of the train engine and a whistle as it came to a stop - there to pick up more of his kin, but not him - he had something to resolve.\n\n"Mister Vogel?" Marceli asked, seeing the older German sitting on his chair and writing something off perk an eyebrow.\n\n"Herr- ugh," his Polish was rusty as he looked up, "what is problem?"\n\nMarceli took a deep breath.

"Surely this is a mistake - I was born in Gdańsk!"\n\nFor a second's pause did the German man look at him before sighing and shaking his head. "Danzig-" Marceli's frown became laced with irritation.

 speerflavor.91.desc: "Theodor Oberländer looked out before his kingdom, the floor of the Reichstag, and allowed a deep scowl to spread across his face. The assembly was not in session that day, but these chambers were a place where he could think. And, at the moment, Oberländer needed to think, to choose a course. He stood from his seat, where he had heard so many proposals and pressed so many stamps into ink. Allowing his mind to go elsewhere, the man began to pace across the Reichstag floor.\n\nAs one of Hitler's ministers, it had been clear Speer would set the Reich on the right course. Oberländer had seen that for himself, as one of the first members of the Reformist faction. Only fools and yes-men had truly believed there would be no change needed after the West Russian War. As Führer, however... Oberländer could only shudder to think what idiocy Speer would attempt to carve National Socialism into. There was a reason his supporters were called Speerites, and not reformers. Any true reformer would see what inoperable madness Speer's real plans contained.\n\nBut even a Führer did not rule alone. Oberländer had been the sole voice of reason then, and he would continue to be so now. The German people, he believed, would listen to intelligence and reason over the rhetoric of firebrands. The party could easily be led to see that such changes had to be done with a light hand. Speer could be kept in check, if Oberländer held him to account. That would be the doctor's solemn duty. He swore it to himself, his final act of vigil in the empty Reichstag.\n\nSuch was his focus on that promise that he did not notice an aide approach him until the boy spoke. "Herr Oberländer? The Führer would like to speak with you." Oberländer disliked the casual tone with which this child spoke to him. Speer did not grasp the difference between a true reformer, and a rebellious youth mindlessly rejecting that which his parents had taught him. A sneer found his face as he replied."

 speerflavor.92.t: "The Moderate"
 speerflavor.92.desc: "Theodor Oberländer gritted his teeth, approaching the podium after Speer's man, Erhard, had given his due. It had been short, to the point, and wildly disrespectful. Just like the man himself. Nevertheless, had been as radical as one would expect. It was baffling that Speer had chosen such a toad to lead his economic policy, but he had again never been practical. Oberländer allowed the scant applause to dissipate before addressing the assembly.\n\n"Thank you, Herr Erhard." He spoke curtly and nodded to the economist, who did not look very happy to be thanked. "I think we all need to recognize the value in what is being said. I am far from claiming the economy is perfect. However, I am quite worried about the scale on which Herr Erhard describes these changes. This... revolution of the German economy that he suggests is, I must say, rather radical," he noted. "Radical, and very, very foolhardy."\n\n"Herr Erhard, of course, has made great use of his PhD in economics. He is the Reichsminister of Finance, after all." Oberländer conceded. "But a PhD is something that helps primarily in classrooms and hypotheticals. This sort of plan that he suggests would work wonders in a bubble where there is only economics to consider. My own doctorate in finance, however, shows that I am well-experienced in the realities of putting such things into practice, unlike Herr Erhard. And my doctorate in agriculture, meanwhile, shows that I can tell you how Herr Erhard would rob good German farmers of the chance to make a living."\n\n"There is not a man in this building who does not remember the collapse in the fifties. How it brought our enemies to our doorsteps and how it revealed the treachery of those we had once considered friends. Does Herr Erhard mean to bring the German economy to such a place of instability that it collapses again? When we consider the extent of Herr Erhard's plan today, we must think of one feature of any revolution, whether political or economic." Oberländer glanced around the room, noticing a furious Ludwig Erhard. "A revolution turns order on its head.""
 speerflavor.92.a: "The Reichstag began to applaud."

 speerflavor.93.t: "Madness and Purges"
 speerflavor.93.desc: "Theodor Oberländer walked into his office to find it had been ripped apart. His pillows had been tossed aside and torn apart, as if someone expected them to contain some secrets. His drawers had been left half open, and there were papers scattered all over the room. And yet, there was not a person around to answer for it. His first thought was that someone had broken into his office, stolen something of importance or value. But who would be bold enough to rob the President of the Reichstag? He did not have to think long about the answer.\n\nOberländer turned, sprinting down the hall from the ransacked office. For all he knew, they were already looking for him. The building was emptier and quieter than Oberländer had ever remembered it being. The only sound present were his shoes against the floor. He rounded the corner, seeing that the door to what was once Heydrich's office had been left ajar. His lungs heaving the mad dash, he entered the room and closed the door behind him, making sure to lock it.\n\nA folder had been left open on Heydrich's desk. Neatly stenciled on the front, he knew, were the words "Theodor Oberländer". Oberländer picked through the files until he reached the end. On the final page were the words he himself had added on the day of Hitler's death. "Completely cleared of all suspicions regarding disloyalty to the Reich." To anyone else's eyes, it would have looked as if it was a memo Heydrich had written years before. Any papers proving otherwise had been rendered to ash and were now sitting in Oberländer's home wastebasket.\n\nA sense of weightlessness and total relief filled Oberländer. They had found nothing. Speer had found nothing for which the President of the Reichstag could be blamed, no matter how exhaustive his search had been. As Oberländer stood to leave, he heard the unmistakable sound of gunfire from outside the window. He had not been the only one."
 speerflavor.93.a: "Speer will pay for this."

 speerflavor.94.t: "An Odd Alliance"
 speerflavor.94.desc: "It was Kiesinger that Oberländer sought out. He was the only one of the reformists that seemed reasonable at times, and the President of the Reichstag figured that if any of Speer's clique were going to listen to him, it was Silver Tongue. He spotted the former lawyer, as always, in the process of schmoozing some unsuspecting policymaker, no doubt trying to curry his favor for some ludicrous proposal of Speer's in the future. It gave Oberländer an odd spurt of pleasure to be interrupting such a thing.\n\n"Deputy Führer," The President of the Reichstag intoned when the conversation seemed to have hit a lull. "We need to speak for a moment, if you are not too busy." Kiesinger shot an apologetic look at his companions and excused himself. The two men walked for a moment until they were properly out of any man's earshot. Kiesinger gave Oberländer an expectant look, waiting for the President to speak. "Is what I have heard true? Does Speer intend to dismantle IG Farben and the other corporations?"\n\n"Yes, and for good reason." Kiesinger wasted no time launching into a spiel. "President Oberländer, you are an educated man, even holding a doctorate in economics. You know how these corporations have crippled the German economy. These companies have destroyed the German labor industry. Their stranglehold on the markets is not just a travesty, but a crime. A crime against the Reich and the ideals of National Socialism. It is the duty of the Führer to stop such things."\n\nOberländer nodded. "There's no need to convince me, Deputy Führer. I hold the leeches on the German state in as much contempt as you do." That revelation seemed to have taken Kiesinger by surprise. "Herr Kiesinger, I simply came to offer my assistance to the Führer in this brave endeavor. This is a matter of concern for all of Germany, and as President of the Reichstag I throw my full support behind it." The rest of the conversation was much more productive."
 speerflavor.94.a: "The two shook hands and parted ways."

 speerflavor.95.t: "The Change to Come"
 speerflavor.95.desc: "Theodor Oberländer sat in a chair, facing the most powerful man in Europe. Albert Speer sat at a desk, facing a legislator who irritated him to his core. Neither man particularly liked his company. "My Führer," Oberländer began, boldly yet deferentially. "Surely you are not truly considering repealing the Nuremberg Laws? The party would riot, and so would the corporations. Such a drastic action, so quickly after the war, seems to me somewhat unwise."\n\nSpeer eyed the President of the Reichstag. What was he getting at? "Herr Oberländer, I am sure you know where my support base is drawn from. The Nuremberg system of racial discrimination has done nothing but weaken the Reich." For years, Oberländer had been just as harshly critical of the Nuremberg Laws as the reformers. Had he fully succumbed to the party line, just to spite Speer?\n\n"My Führer, you misunderstand. I do not propose that we continue the policy, only the laws behind it." Oberländer withdrew a folder, which he slid across the table to Speer. "Enclosed, my Führer, you will find several reports from myself on the heritage of the Eastern European population. At the time of the Nuremberg Laws, these were widely considered Slavic, inferior peoples. However, this research has shown that a higher proportion than previously known is in fact of Nordic stock, and as such, of proper Aryan genealogy."\n\nSpeer nodded, suddenly understanding the President's suggestion. "If this report were to come to light, the Nuremberg Laws may need to be taken under a period of review. During this period, of course, the persecution of Untermenschen will need to be temporarily halted, to ensure no Aryans are unwittingly harmed." Speer eyed the President of the Reichstag. Perhaps Oberländer was more crafty than Speer had given him credit for."
 speerflavor.95.a: "He must be watched closely."

 speerflavor.96.t: "Brothers of the Shadows"
 speerflavor.96.desc: "Theodor Oberländer did not know Reinhard Gehlen well, on a personal level, but he knew of him. The man had been well-known to have spies under every corner during the Second World War, and Oberländer guessed, by his appointment to the head of the Reich's new intelligence agencies, he had not curbed his activities in that field. He would serve as Speer's dagger in the dark, where the Gestapo had previously served as the NSDAP's club in the night. Oberländer was not stupid enough to not know what it meant.\n\nNow, a small metal dot had found its way to the bottom of Oberländer's desk, as he had been informed earlier that morning. Speer had failed to remove Oberländer during the purges, and now, it seemed, he was on Gehlen's list of people to watch closely. This attempt to have Oberländer killed was more subtle than the last one, but this time, Speer had failed to catch him unawares. And, Oberländer expected, he would continue to fail in later attempts.\n\nOne side effect of working in the Reich's intelligence programs was that one tended to trust their team with their life. It was odd, given how much of the profession was built around lying and mistrust. But if you could not act swiftly and unflinchingly based on the information of other agents, you were not in the correct profession. That level of trust, tested again and again, tended to build some sort of bond, even if the Reich tried their hardest to ensure friendships did not form.\n\nThose bonds, it seemed, were strong enough for Oberländer's old compatriots from the Abwehr to enlighten him of the RND's new plans for him. With a grimace, Oberländer pried loose the listening device, letting it fall to the ground. As the heel of his well polished shoe grinded the bug to dust, the President of the Reichstag considered sending a bouquet of flowers in thanks."
 speerflavor.96.a: "Another attempt fails."

 speerflavor.97.t: "A Farewell"
 speerflavor.97.desc: ""Surely, there must be something that you can do to stop this, Oberländer." An indignant Schörner pressed the President of the Reichstag, who was becoming rather dissatisfied with the conversation. "You have the party's ear, the Reich's ear. If you call this injustice what it is, an injustice, then they will LISTEN to you!" He slammed his fist against the table, clearly in an expression of outrage. "They will be forced to listen to you, if they do not want the Reich's populace up in arms."\n\n"If you think that this is in any way my business, you are wrong, Herr Schörner." Oberländer carefully ran his hand over the part of the table that Schörner had hit, trying to be sure that he had not left a mark in it. The table had been a gift from his mother, and he did not want it ruined by a late-night visit from this ranting madman. "What sort of outrage would I invoke, informing the people that a military official had received a new assignment? And what would the outrage of the people, or the Reichstag accomplish, against the Führer's directives?"\n\nSchörner regarded the doctor with a look of undisguised disgust, flavored with the desperation of a starving man begging for scraps. "Oberländer, do you not see what Speer is doing? He is ridding himself of every competent and pure-minded member of the administration! He seeks to bastardize National Socialism, to bring about some Judeo-Liberal fantasy! You and I, we are the only ones who still command enough sway to stop him, before he ruins everything!" There was a look of hungry anger, something intensely frightening. "We cannot let him do this."\n\nAnd yet, Oberländer considered Schörner for a second. It seemed like madness, the bitter ramblings of a disgruntled general, and yet some of what he spoke rang true. Perhaps now was the time to make a stand, to make a move against Speer. Then, Oberländer noticed his wife peer into the room, wondering why Theodor had not yet returned to bed. Meeting her eyes, the President of the Reichstag rose. "Herr Schörner, I believe you have a train to catch.""

 speerflavor.98.t: "Utter Failure"
 speerflavor.98.desc: "In this very room, so long ago, Oberländer had sworn to keep Speer in check.\n\nThat was the thought that kept running through his head, as men around him yelled and shouted at one another, each much more eager to shoot down the proposals of his enemy than make any contributions of his own. The president, usually one of the most boisterous voices in the Reichstag, watched quietly as the Reich's farce of a government bickered over what to do.\n\nSpeer had loosened the reins, and they had slipped from his hands. The slaves were revolting, just as dozens of party officials had expected. Speer, Kiesinger, Schmidt... They had given the Untermenschen the rope by which to hang the German nation. If they were to survive, if they were to continue... someone would have to do something.\n\nSomeone yelled for silence, and there was a clamor as the dissenting voices of the Reichstag eventually simmered down into silence. When all eyes turned to him and no one spoke, Oberländer realized that they were all expecting the President to address the assembly.\n\nFaced with the results of Speer's recklessness and searching for a solution, the Reichstag was looking to Oberländer."

Nevertheless, they seemed to be taken aback when he first proposed what he feared needed to be done.\n\n"Of course the slaves have been mishandled. Otherwise they would not be currently in armed revolt." After a moment's hesitation, Paul Wegener continued, his brows furrowing. "President Oberländer, are you suggesting a putsch against the Führer?"\n\n"Of course I'm not suggesting a putsch, Herr Wegener." Oberländer snapped. "We already have one revolt in the Reich, and to spark a second would only further damage Germany. I am suggesting that, if Speer fails in resolving his own mess, we ensure his carelessness is not the death of the Reich."\n\nHeinrich Trettner nodded along as the President spoke. "If even one mother loses a son because Speer felt the need to curry the favor of Untermenschen, I worry for the future of his Reich." He glanced over at Wegener, who still looked uncertain of the prospect. "Would this have happened under Hitler, Paul? I don't think it would have."\n\n"From the bottom of my heart, Herr Wegener, I hope that this revolt will prove insignificant, and that the slaves will become docile at the first rattling of a saber." Oberländer's face was a blank sheet, betraying nothing but grim determination. "But I fear that it will not, and that is an eventuality for which we must prepare.""

 speerflavor.100.desc: "It was said that to get things done in politics, one often had to reach across the aisle. Thankfully, the laws of the Reich had meant that Oberländer had never dealt with much opposition in the Reichstag. It had seemed a blessing at the time, but it meant that he did not have as much experience in manufacturing back-door dealings as he would have liked.\n\nNow, however, the Reich was facing the biggest crisis since the West Russian War. The madmen had declared war on the slaves. It was exactly what the President feared. Oberländer was not certain what anyone with half a brain believed a thousand dead Germans and ten thousand martyred Untermenschen would achieve. It would certainly not bring about a great Reich. And thus, that goal was left up to Oberländer, Wegener, and Trettner.\n\nHermann Josef Abs, a massive man whom Oberländer had grown to despise the very look of, eyed the trio. "President Oberländer. Wegener here tells me that we have something to speak about?" Oberländer could imagine the disdain was mutual, even if Abs did not show it. The last time they had spoken, IG Farben was being ripped to bits by Speer... with Oberländer's help. "I'm a very busy man, and time is money, after all."\n\nOberländer hesitated, glancing at his associates, and Trettner gave him a nod. There was no going back now, even if this step was the most difficult of all to justify in Oberländer's head. The doctor turned back to Abs, who had begun to light a cigar. What an ass. "Herr Abs," Oberländer ventured, "How would you like to be the most powerful banker in the world once more?"\n\nHe liked the sound of it."

Immediately to his left, his close confidant Otto Ernst Remer. Next to him, the unfortunate consequence of having to compromise with the reactionary economic interests in the Reich which had made common cause in opposition to the liberals: IG Farben stooge Otto Ambros. A man far more to the liking of Schörner was Generalmajor Otto Wöhler, who had been forcefully retired by the traitorous liberals in Germania before Schörner rescued him. Last and in fact least amongst the cabinet ministers was Otto Abetz, in the now largely irrelevant role of representative to the Reich. Inspite of his irrelevance, Schörner still had a use for appearances, and so Abetz had to be kept around.\n\n"Very well Gentlemen." Schörner was interrupted by the sound of the cabinet room's door being opened, it was the chief of the intelligence for Heeresgruppe Russland, who had wisely joined him: Otto Wächter. Behind him, Otto Bradfisch, the liaison with Schörner's allies in Germany, closely followed. Reading all their names allowed while going through their reports, Schörner came to a stop. Something wasn't right, but he couldn't quite tell. After a brief pause, he continued to conduct the meeting, and only at its end realized what he was unsure about.\n\nOn his way back to Heeresgruppe Russland headquarters, he turned to his aide de camp,"

 speerflavor.102.t: "King's Gambit"
 speerflavor.102.desc: "Theodor Oberländer breathed into his gloved hands and rubbed them together, gritting his teeth slightly before letting out a short sigh, a wisp of hot breath dissipating into the cold air. Far away, in the heart of Germania, he could see the snow-tipped Volkshalle, a behemoth towering over the city as an eternal reminder of National Socialism to its people. Disgust creeped up his throat.\n\nIn better circumstances, he would have found himself rallying the banner of the reformists. The shattered remnants of the NSDAP patched themselves together as the Speerite faction began winning over its contenders, and the will of the people was quashed under the liberal boot of Speer and his lackeys. Within a vacuum, their faction aligned with his goals. Without a vacuum, however, the truth was that he was alienated from them. He and Speer did not see eye-to-eye with each other, not at all, let alone his hand-picked and suspicious ministers, most especially that Ludwig Erhard and Helmut Schmidt. Their beliefs were intolerable.\n\nSo he found himself aligning with the remnants of the NSDAP before the war. The hardliners, the orthodox National Socialists, people obsessed with the picture painted by the triumphs of Germany before its series of catastrophes began. As Oberländer looked away from the Volkshalle and began moving towards his car, he scowled to himself, his footsteps filling the emptiness of the street, alongside his own thoughts. The hardliners were deluded if they thought that things could simply go back to normal like it was in the 30s and 40s, and while he found little interest in their beliefs, he did find much interest in their usefulness.\n\nIt was not an alliance born out of sympathetic causes, no, not at all. But there was no other option. The click of the car door and the roll of warmth coming from inside invited Oberländer in, and he slammed it shut behind him as he entered, key turning and engine revving as he gave one last glance towards Speer's show of ego.\n\nThe fools in his party and the madmen following Speer waited for his first move."

He had been so lulled into staring up towards the night sky, eyes piercing through the rolling clouds of fog, tracing one constellation and another, drawing his mind away from what was real, factual, and horrifying.\n\nAll it took was one bullet for him to be sent here. To Berchtesgaden. To this resort home that Hitler had built for him. A gift from decades ago from a man who felt, in this moment, barely responsive to Speer's memories. Schmidt had twisted this gift from him like a knife in a wound when he was told to come here and "de-stress". As if. That spineless coward hid behind a sorrowful frown and hid the fear he felt from Speer, all the while pretending what had happened had never happened. That-\n\nHe felt his fist impact the wooden railing, irritation trailing across the side of his palm and finger, and he didn't even bother to look up as he continued to stare longingly towards the stars and the mountains, the thick blankets of a white smokey haze providing a strange sense of comfort. It reminded Speer of the ambitions he had before coming into politics - a simple job, a simple pursuit, and a simple end, but the world could never be so predictable and so easy. Destiny, if it even existed, had other plans for him.\n\nHis shoulders ached and his body was irritable, but Speer stayed put regardless. He could have stared into the great world beyond him for hours and hours, marvelling in its excellence, even if it was a tiny fragment of what encompassed the planet. But he couldn't deny that a tight feeling in his chest formed the more time that had passed, and at some point he could feel it breathe in and out irregularly. As beautiful as the world was in front of him, untarnished by war, untouched by petty politics, he knew he had taken a plunge into darkness."

 speerflavor.104.t: "Letter of Penance"
 speerflavor.104.desc: ""I should have you shot, dog!"\n\nThe uncommon spark of fury within Speer's voice only prompted a smile from Schörner, who felt pain shoot through his back as he was slammed against the wall by two Orpo agents, cold concrete running across the length of his thin coat. Speer, meanwhile, stood two meters away, carrying with him a loaded pistol, as well as a menacing glare in his gaze. "You are one of the worst traitors to the Reich, and by all accounts, I should have you executed here and now!" He continued, pulling back the hammer of the gun as Schörner could see the round, smooth black of the barrel pointing down at him.\n\nThe silence that came from Schörner emphasized the small cough he gave afterwards, ringing insultingly throughout the bland and empty room, and he felt the sun flood his neck with warmth as he craned his head up to look at Speer. "Well, then, go on." He said, lips parting to reveal a small, victorious grin. "Kill me. Start another civil war. I am certain the militarists will accept whatever judgement you pass." The burning sarcasm tightened Speer's grip on the pistol, and a finger itched to slip into the trigger zone - yet didn't. "Perhaps you can even quarter and draw me. Then they would cheer, wouldn't they?" A defiant gaze followed a sudden sharper and louder tone. "Wouldn't they, Herr Speer?"\n\nSpeer grimaced so hard he felt like his teeth would shatter. In a moment of anger, a tired hand swung cold steel towards Schörner's head, slamming him and leaving a heavy bruise on the grinning man's face. "Release him!" Speer ordered, and Schörner felt his limbs lighten. "And get the Hell out of my sight. I don't want to look at you until things stabilize."\n\nBlood pooled from the cut inside his cheek, and Schörner spat, staining Speer's shirt with red."

After years of waiting behind the shadow of Albert Speer, he had finally been given his chance. His chance to...\n\nThe pride he felt dropped, and his eyebrows furrowed. The steel image of a Prussian man cracked, revealing a much more vulnerable individual. A single person, not an ideal-- a person whose hands had been stained with blood that he had spilled of his own choosing. The whisper of guilt nagged at the back of Tresckow's head, and he looked away, his own face unbearable to stare at.\n\nHis fingers curled into fists, and he took a deep breath. Tresckow was the chief of the OKW, and that gave him power. Power and influence that he would not misuse. Not this time. This time he would save lives, not doom them. He would cleanse the army of its Nazi spirit, and though God would not forgive his soul, he would at least find penance. It was the least he could do. There would be no heaven for von Tresckow."

He loved speaking to people- of all different types. Members of the SS, Heer soldiers, student protestors- he knew people from all walks of life. Kurt loved his country- and he hated that he was unable to serve in the military.\n\nHis childhood passion of "people watching" soon evolved into something more intimate; rather than just watching people, he'd speak to them, he'd get to know them. He honed his conversational skills to a fine tool; a tool he was able to use to get anyone to tell him anything, without them even knowing.\n\nIt shouldn't have been any surprise that he supported Speer in the conflict. Rather than fight, he managed intelligence. He moved the secrets of Bormann and Göring to those fighting for Speer. When the conflict was ended, and Speer established himself as Führer, Kurt returned to his home; his contributions to the Reich never known.\n\nBut he kept people watching. He kept speaking to people, he kept roaming the dark underbelly of Germania. There was no enemy that he was fighting, no war being fought; but he continued his hunt. His hunt for secrets, his hunt for purpose had not yet ended. He kept tabs on people he thought he should; he made a mental note of anything he could possibly use in the future. If he couldn't continue serving his country, he might as well serve his city.\n\nIt was an ordinary day that his life changed. Kurt headed to one of the locations he most frequented- a coffee shop. He placed his order (a simple black coffee, of course) and sat down in a booth.\n\nHe had barely time to pull out the day's newspaper when a thin man in a nice suit sat down across from him.\n\n"Hello, Kurt. We've been watching you, and we'd like to talk.""

He'll never forget what his first taste of love was, the way his heart plunged as if it were dropped, nor will he forget her name. He'll never forget his first fight, the sound of bone breaking, nor will he forget the stern admonition he got afterwards. As Kurt looked down at his hand, still gripping the luger, he realized that this was another one of those moments.\n\nHe looked down at the man in front of him. Rivers of red coursed their way through the uneven ground, splitting off into creeks and tributaries; the pond of crimson around the black-jacketed man turned from a pond into a lake; a lake into a sea; and finally, into an ocean.\n\nThe crimson wound its way around the twin "sig" runes, embossed in silver on the man's collar, somehow darkening the already-black leather. He was dead before he hit the ground; Kurt was trained well. Two shots to the back of the head, and the SS officer was gone, just like had been planned.\n\nA series of assassinations like this were taking place all over the Reich. The RND had given agents orders to dispose of certain "reactionary" elements; of which certain members of the SS consisted.\n\nIt was one such order that Kurt received; he was to eliminate a member of Germania's SS garrison- and he did, flawlessly. He had taken his time, followed his mark to an empty location- and his prize was the flow of red that lay in front of him.\n\nKurt never knew the officer's name- he knew nothing about him. And if he was being honest with himself, he didn't care. He thought he should feel shame or guilt or anything like that; but he didn't. He only felt pride. He knew- he had seen- what the SS had done to people. While Kurt was by no means a liberal, he had been supporting Speer from the very beginning- a fact that made him no friend to the SS."

Eighteen years old, still a student. Not much older than Kurt himself. And yet, Kurt's orders had been clear- discover who some of the student leaders were, and report them to the high command of RND.\n\nKurt could tell himself that he didn't know that they were gonna kill him, that they were only going to arrest him- but he'd be lying to himself once again. What else would they have done, but cut down the young leader?\n\nHe looked down at the flowers that someone had left at the memorial. Could they have been from a friend? A family member? A lover? There was no way for Kurt to know. This young student had his entire life ahead of him; decades and decades of experiences to be had, severed. Kurt had caused the bud of life to be severed for this young man, stopping it from ever flowering into anything else.\n\nA tear wet the recently-dug soil near the grave. This could have easily been him, Kurt thought. If he hadn't been a part of the RND, if he had been radicalized... There were a million "ifs." Kurt thought that his political thoughts weren't too far off from what this young man's probably were. He did agree that the Reich needed reform- and deep in his heart of hearts, there was a part of him that was interested in democracy. If Kurt hadn't been a part of the RND, he'd probably be out there protesting, just like this young man was.\n\nFor the first time in a long time,"

Both while wandering Germania, and as part of his unique "career," he had gotten to know many of the countless cafes and coffeehouses of the city.\n\nThis one was one of his favorites; their rolls were fantastic, and their black coffee was perfect- just the way he liked it. The best part, however, was the opportunity that this specific coffee shop gave him to people-watch- a skill that proved extremely useful during his work under the RND.\n\nHe loved watching people. Just to see what they did, to hear what they said. Today, he was focused on a nervous looking kid standing near the counter. A nervous looking kid- who was known to have links to certain student protest groups- ones deemed dangerous by the Reich.\n\nHe was no more than a kid, really; he had long, greasy hair, and glasses; and he wouldn't stop fidgeting with his hands. Kurt watched as his eyes widened. He began to raise his hand, and stopped immediately; instead, he nodded.\n\nThe kid slid into a booth with a well-dressed man; too far away for Kurt to hear. Kurt's thoughts began to immediately race- Who was this man that a known dissident was meeting with? What was the large briefcase that he held next to him?\n\nAnd so, Kurt waited.

Infiltration was easy; he simply walked in. Blond men in suits were everywhere in high class hotels such as this one. He simply took the elevator to the top floor.\n\nLike a ghost, Kurt crept into the hotel room. He watched as the American did his same nightly routine; he sent his report, brushed his teeth, got changed, and lay down in his comfortable hotel bed. The instant that the American closed his eyes, Kurt was there; crouched next to him, with his Luger at the spy's forehead. The American's eyes shot open. In crisp English, Kurt began to speak.\n\n"Scream, and you're dead. Make a move, and you're dead. Tell me your name."\n\nThe American didn't respond at first. He simply took a deep breath.\n\n"My name is Siegfried Köhler. Put down the gun."\n\nFlawless German- Kurt hadn't been expecting this. He had expected an answer in English, or at least, very choppy German. But this man- he spoke German like a native. Kurt's thoughts raced; was it possible that he was wrong? Could he have the wrong man?\n\nNo, he told himself. He had seen this man meet with a known dissident. He had seen this man drop up a package that the RND had tagged as "dangerous." He had seen this man plotting, scheming, and lying. No; his resolve hardened. There was no way he was wrong. This was his target.\n\nThis moment of weakness, of unknown, was all it took "Siegfried" to act. In one, fluid motion, he moved his head to the side, while reaching under his pillow with his right hand. Before Kurt could react, he felt cold steel on his own forehead.\n\n"Now, it seems like we're in a predicament, aren't we. Tell me your name.""

There was nothing to dampen the sound.\n\n"If either one of us takes a shot, the entire hotel will know."\n\nKurt took a deep breath and nodded. Then he began to chuckle. His laugh was infectious, and the American looked like he himself was struggling to contain his own mirth, before he finally gave in.\n\n"This is stupid. This is all so stupid."\n\nKurt doubled over in laughter, barely able to get words out.\n\n"Not just one of us forgetting to bring a suppressed weapon, but both of us? It's like something out of one of your shitty spy movies. I should have just stabbed you."\n\nThe American grinned.\n\n"You should have, but you didn't. Instead, now we're just two dumbasses pointing unsuppressed weapons at each other. Why don't you sit down? Neither one of us is going to shoot the other. Why don't we just talk? Like adults?"\n\nKurt smiled, nodded, and sat down on the bed next to the American. The American sat up, and for the first time, the two men were on the same level- both physically and in terms of threat. And it showed- they were able to talk as equals. Things were tense- of course they were. They were from opposing superpowers, of course. Through the night, the tension began to ebb away; the jokes came easier, the smiles more comfortably. They talked long into the night, until the morning sun's rays began to peek through the hotel's windows. Finally, the American outstretched his hand: a silent question being asked."

Another death warrant to sign, another treaty to withdraw from, another thing he was expected not to read and simply apply his rubber stamp. He decided to exercise a little rebellion for once, and put on his reading glasses.\n\nA quick skim revealed precisely why his party comrades would prefer he never see the document. "In the interests of national security", all ports would be closed to ships from outside the Reich indefinitely. It seemed the party disagreed with his rejection of Autarky, that dirty word they had begun using more as a propaganda piece than anything.\n\nHe looked at his desk. A cup of coffee - that would soon become much more expensive, if it could even be found in a legitimate market. His desk itself had been a gift from a Japanese dignitary, carved from a single piece of ebony grown in the jungles of Indonesia. No more fancy tropical woods. He looked about at the room he sat in, his office in the Volkshalle, his greatest creation. Every block of stone, every light fixture, every scrap of wire in the walls and piece of pipe in the floors had been mined here in his Reich.\n\nHe had no idea how many slaves were buried in its foundations."

The camera flashed again, and his grip tightened on the rail.\n\nAnother one of Hitler's vainglorious dreams gone wrong, and he was stuck dealing with the aftermath as usual. The photographer moved closer, so close he could practically smell the bastard. A niggling feeling in the back of his head reminded him of all those days spent at the Berghof enraptured by Hitler's ideas. He had done his best to temper the man, hadn't he? Or had he spent his time climbing the ranks?\n\nThe camera flashed and Speer's temper broke. With a wordless snarl he slapped it out of the man's hands to the cobbles below. There was some fuss to be dealt with by his staff, they'd probably buy him a new camera to shut him up. He ignored the commotion he had caused, and stared out to sea."

Then Speer could see more than a few buttons close to bursting on their immaculate shirts, festooned with medals. One would think that the Göring look would have gone out of fashion by now. He allowed himself a chuckle, and turned to relay his joke to Generalfeldmarschall von Tresckow to his right.\n\nThe old Prussian was sweating. Albert had never seen that before - the Volkshalle was famously freezing, a subject even he was not too proud to joke about. There was an odd look on his face. Speer ignored the gentle nudge from Oberländer, who sat to his left, and continued studying von Tresckow. Oberländer in turn ignored Speer as he was so wont to do these days, and called the meeting to order himself. There was a briefcase in the Generalfeldmarschall's lap. He kept toying with the handle as though he was afraid it would leap from his grasp. Henning's eyes, which previously had been vacantly staring at his feet, rose to meet his Führer's.\n\nOberländer continued his vacuous speech but Speer felt deaf. He stood, and the room followed his example in confusion. Henning too rose, holding the briefcase to his chest like his life depended on it. Protests arose until eventually all fell silent.\n\n"I have stood by for some time now." Henning began. "I had hoped things would change. I had hoped you would change. Now that everyone else is gone," His eyes remained locked on Albert's. "I see that I was a fool."\n\nOne of those staffers Speer had joked to himself about seemed to have an inkling of what was occurring. He slowly sidled towards von Tresckow, staying behind him. Speer opened his mouth to say something - what, he would never know - but the staffer had struck at Henning, grabbing at the briefcase. The generals yelled and leapt behind the desk, but Albert was paralysed. The pair were tussling like animals, the staffer tearing at Henning's face-\n\nAnd then Generalfeldmarschall von Tresckow exploded."

The room he now rested in was empty and without windows. A pair of guards waited outside his door, and the rest of the hospital was presumably filled to bursting with them. The staffer who had saved his life had mercifully perished in the initial moments of the explosion. Several of his generals were not so lucky. He would have to give out some posthumous medals later, he supposed. He couldn't remember the name of the staffer - nobody had ever told him.\n\nGeneralfeldmarschall von Tresckow had been obliterated. Much of the debris flying through the room had in fact been him. Albert reached to his collarbone where a small wound lay. They had sent him through the X-Ray to identify anything they'd missed, and identified the tiny fragment of bone that lay underneath, too small to dig out without risking more damage. They were unable to identify to which man it had belonged.\n\nThere would be a purge, naturally. He had thought they had moved past those times, but heads would roll regardless of what he thought. From what he'd been told Tresckow had made few allies in his plan - the last gasp of a foolish traitor, they called it. Most likely they wouldn't let him attend an OKW meeting again, and no doubt Oberländer would snap up the opportunity to "represent" him. Another empty hour to fill his day. Another hour to think about what was.\n\nThere was nobody about who cared about his feelings anymore. He could order someone to listen, but all his guards, his assistants, his staff were more loyal to the party than to their Führer, and eventually every word he spoke would be transcribed and studied by those who claimed to obey him.\n\nThere didn't seem to be much for a Führer to do.

They had chained themselves to a gate."\n\n"You of all people should know how dangerous these students can be, Albert. The officers showed remarkable restraint - I'm told one of the rioters will recover." he insisted, pushing the pen and paper towards Speer. "Medals are only appropriate."\n\nSpeer snorted a humourless laugh. This time he did not even look at Oberländer - he seemed to be staring a thousand yards ahead, deeply unnerving the minister across the table. "No, I don't think they are. Tell them I'm tired. Tell them they're murderers. Tell them to fuck off, for all I care." He slumped back in his seat.\n\nOberländer took in Speer - a shell of a man. Great bags rested under his eyes, contrasting the pale skin that almost seemed to hang from his bones. His suit clearly hadn't been ironed, and he seemed to almost have shrunk into it. He had lost weight - always slim, he now seemed closer to a skeleton. He had hoped the man would be able to maintain a shred of dignity, but apparently he had to do everything around here. He gestured to the guards at the door.\n\n"You heard, the Führer is tired. Escort him to his chambers until he is well rested enough to perform his duties. The medal ceremony can be postponed until then." The guards moved to help Speer from his chair, but before they could reach him he flung up his hands and stood, giving Oberländer a withering look. Like the moment before a lightning strike, hairs on the back of necks stood throughout the room. The corner of their Führer's mouth twitched, but Oberländer did not shift his eyes, locked with Speer's. He could see there was nothing left within."

The monotone voice was unnerving them, he could tell. He did not care. He didn't seem to care about much anymore.\n\nHe hadn't eaten in a day or two, he reflected. Perhaps that was why he felt so detached. His menu was the last thing they would allow him control over. Was he refusing to order from it out of spite? Guilt and masochism? He wasn't quite sure.\n\nThat worm Oberländer, treating him like a child having a tantrum. He could have had him shot on a whim, didn't he know? Could have. Everything was a could have or a was these days. He briefly entertained himself with the image of Oberländer lying in a ditch with a hole in his skull. He had seen enough men like that in the past few years. This time, he allowed himself a brief smile as he shook hands, vanishing just as quickly as it appeared. It seemed to worry the officer even more.\n\nHe stepped once again, extended his hand to pin a medal on another man who wasn't there before realising he had reached the end of the line. He turned about face without hesitation and began walking towards his waiting car.\n\nReichsminister Oberländer observed Speer from his own car. He turned to Otto, who seemed just as worried as he did about the Führer's state - though perhaps for different reasons.

The latest in a long line of peaceful protesters had apparently become tired of being beaten within an inch of their lives, or an inch beyond. They demanded to know why their Führer had lied to them. Why his government stripped away the freedoms of the same ambitious youths who had fought so hard for him. Why those same men they had fought against now occupied such privileged positions. To be honest Albert didn't blame his ministers for keeping him out of hearing range of these students - he wasn't quite sure what had happened either.\n\nA return to form, he supposed. Students had never been fond of him until he started capitalising on them, of anyone in the party save Hitler in his heyday. The benefit of being surrounded by men in black is your own shade of grey appears sparkling white. Students hate military men, propagandists, and politicians. So he had played the architect, the sensible one, the only sane man. It hadn't been hard. Yet now the men with guns were his, the posters all bore his face, and it was his speeches that the Reichstag clapped at for countless minutes; still, everyone was knee deep in shit. But perhaps he had remembered too late - when did he join, when was he first captivated by Hitler's magnetism? When he was a student.\n\nWhat had changed since he actually seemed to be in charge? He seemed to spend every day wondering how he had arrived in this situation, yet every day he went to bed none the wiser. For so long he had believed it was he that knew how things worked, not that vile arschlock Bormann, or that arrogant opportunistic bastard Göring. He had Hitler's ear, did that not mean something?

I turn to the minister reading his notes, not that I can remember his name. He was saying something about death warrants. I'll probably have to sign them later. No doubt it would be someone I knew of, someone with too many good ideas making too much noise. I'd attended meetings like this in Hitler's day, and I didn't care for them then. I don't care now, though not for the same reason. Back then I was too busy daydreaming of plans of buildings unbuilt.\n\nI know I am daydreaming now, but again for a different reason. People believed in me, but who am I? An architect? A warlord? A dictator? All these and more. I have made excuses every day, pretended to myself he did not see, I did not know, but I knew what was going on and did not care. Rise higher, throw more people beneath your boots, then perhaps you can make a change. Then my ego had taken over - why am I surrounded by killers, by liars, by men of such arrogance? Surely I can do better in these trying times than these lunatics? Now I am Hitler, and I seem to be the only one who knows.\n\nI recall the first time I had witnessed a speech from that paradoxical man. I had expected swastikas, brown shirts, roaring and demagoguery. I had been met by the opposite - a man in an inexpensive suit sharing his worries about his country he loved. He had mentioned the Jews of course, but only in passing, a menace of bankers rather than blood. Goebbels had been different, a frothing mess, a roaring croud, a repulsive spectacle. Yet still I joined. I was not choosing the NSDAP but becoming a follower of Hitler, I told myself. He had taken hold of me before I grasped what was happening, I believed for many years.

Frankly, I had my doubts about that coterie of yours from the beginning, but naturally it was not my business."\n\nAlbert snorted. Everything was Abs' business. "Well, they seemed better than the alternative. I seem to recall you had plenty to say about them when they were infringing on your... business. Far be it from me to tell you how to run your operations, however."\n\nSpeer had remarkably become a more interesting conversationalist since his gang had up and fled. Abs supposed he needed a chance to vent, and he admitted he enjoyed their verbal sparring on some level. While Albert might no longer wield the influence he once did, he was an excellent messenger. "Far be it. Nonetheless, we are expanding our operations in Bayern this month. New factories, accommodation, you know the sort. There are a few documents required to expedite the process. Of course, if they ended up at the top of the pile, the benefits could be passed along." He raised his eyebrows pointedly."

speer_natsoc.10.d:0 "Since Speer's ascension, the number of involuntary workers in the Reich had stagnated. Too much pushback to get rid of the institution, too much incompetence and corruption to keep it. Now that those subversive reformist elements had been eliminated, Speer's government could refocus itself on efficient slave management.\n\nIn Wartheland, Poles who do not officially exist are being dragged from their beds. In Ukraine, members of a once-proud Cossack host are surprised at their clandestine meeting by a squad of drunken Wehrmacht soldiers and beaten to unconsciousness before being sold for under-the table-cash. In Russia, sixth children of famine-wracked villages are exchanged for an underfed pig or a crate of chickens. The first major slave expansion in twenty years is taking place."

A little trading is essential, be it resources or knowledge. Still, far be it from him to tell other people what to do.\n\nAlbert glumly signed the papers on his desk once more. He'd spoken with those few contacts in the intelligence community he still believed trustworthy - they too had done their best to express their doubts. Hardliners would be hardliners though. No information other than official state communications would be allowed to escape the Reich, and in turn no foreign communications could be permitted in. Sedition and treason were everywhere these days - or so he heard.\n\nHe turned his radio up - some American band he would likely never hear again. Receiving foreign radio was a crime now, don't you know. If he wanted a record he'd have to barter with one of the staff for it, like some Breton smuggler. Still, it was better than the alternative of only listening to proud Aryan music. God, he was fed up of Wagner."

The guard had been tripled, the building locked down and the courtyards prepared for the parade of six-wheeled Mercedes that never seemed to go out of fashion, despite taking more maintenance than a Tiger. Still, Albert reflected as he looked upon his new Reichsmarschall, perhaps he was just projecting onto the car the faults of its owner.\n\nSpeer had done his best to keep Schörner away from the high echelons of Germania, but the decision was now out of his hands. The Monster In Uniform had another feather in his cap, and his clique were following in earnest. The worst thing was the look in his eyes when he was shaking the bastard's hand. Pure, unfettered pride. Now they would all be forced to deal with his unique management style.\n\nAlbert examined the agenda. Expansion of Wehrmacht funding. Increased recruitment efforts. Military research and development budget tripled. Preferential contracts to IG Farben, Daimler-Benz, Reichswerke, the old guard. Unrepentant reaction to his recent reforms. He sighed, leaned back in his chair, and prepared for a long opening speech."

speer_natsoc.13.d:0 "Albert certainly appreciated the aesthetic of excess - that much could be gleaned from studying any of his buildings. Still, all things must have a function, and he was hard pressed to find the function of this place. The Reich had invested a great deal into nuclear power, but this plant produced practically none. Still the reactor thrummed away, atoms crashing and splitting with one end product - Plutonium. They had accumulated Uranium aplenty from their conquests in Russia and Africa, but that volatile and vital component in nuclear weapons was needed now more than ever - or so he was told.\n\nFissile material production had ramped up in response to the Reich's recent demand that their weapons stockpile be doubled in size, to appropriately operate as a deterrent. Speer did not see the difference - one city killing bomb will kill as many as a hundred if there are no more cities to be found. To his new ministers it seemed an economic stimulus, allowing for great expansion within those old, proud companies that dominated heavy industry and big science. To Schörner it was another opportunity to swing his weight and make room for himself. To him, it was a waste. There would be no economic recovery if there were no people to recover it. And if Schörner got his way, there would be all the room in the world."

Bormann had rather spoiled the atmosphere in the Berghof with his tasteless redecorating, and Albert had been more focused on his own projects than renovating yet another of Hitler's houses. Still, the state visits never ended, and it wasn't like there was much outside the Reich to visit any more. This was admittedly one of the better views he'd seen on his travels, however.\n\nThe crunch of boots on snow was outlining the figures the officer offered him. How the hell they hauled this many tanks up here he'd never know. The normally stark white slopes of the alps seemed carpeted in Feldgrau, tents beyond number. On the higher slopes he noted mortar positions, subtle dots of sniper nests, flak cannons ready to repel any plane that dared to stray too close to the gun-toting obelisk they inhabited. Unfortunately for Albert it had been a bumpy ride in a truck with some stern-faced Fallschirmjagers followed by a hike that had left his knees weak - no helicopter could reach this rarefied level of air.\n\nHe waved his hand at his binocular-toting secretary, and raised the pair to his eyes. The Italians too occupied a spot in the clouds, scant kilometres away across tank traps, minefields, Czech hedgehogs and enough barbed wire to enclose Nanzig. He'd seen the reports, things were escalating here. More equipment, more men, bigger plans, the OKW had demanded it all and got it. He just prayed there would be no spark to light the fuse."

He wasn't quite sure what the final straw had been, there seemed to have been so much debate between them all in the smoky halls of the Volkshalle. All he knew was that when their respective secretaries made their morning calls, Herren Kiesinger, Erhard, Schmidt, and their families were not there. They had searched, naturally, and found themselves at the end of a trail that had could have been years in the planning, one last ratline in the event they didn't get their way.\n\nHe had raged, at first. It was a rare time he let his temper get the better of him, but that night was the first in a month of furious tantrums; against that Gang of Three with their conspiracies; against the Reich he had worked so hard to fix crumbling before his eyes; at himself. Most of all, however, he was afraid. He could feel the sharks circling. There were other, less enlightened members of the party that believed themselves more suitable for the task than he - and he was too dangerous to be left alive.\n\nHe was wrong. Oberländer had neutered him, shoved his hand up his arse and was now controlling him like a ventriloquist's dummy. No more allies meant no more Speer.

Margarete was out somewhere, not that they paid one another much attention these days. It was all too easy to simply spend the evening gazing into the fire, flick a piece of paper in and watch it wither and curl. He had almost forgotten his book.\n\nIt didn't do to have traitors in the former ranks of such esteemed men as his current cabinet, so they had been removed. Every piece of paper they had signed was redacted. Every law they signed could be repealed, for it was a sabotage. Even their homes had been demolished, and mention of their names had been forbidden from any form of media. It didn't bear saying what had happened to their housekeeping staff.\n\nIn America no doubt they would be telling tales of the daring snub to the Reich, but here no news of their escape would ever run. People might ask what had happened to the ministers, but they would never get an answer - and eventually they would reach their own conclusions. He returned to his book."

It wasn't me.\nOur government is losing power? It wasn't me.\nInstall security cameras? It wasn't me.\n\nIndeed, to the party it had seemed like there was all too little Albert had done. It was only natural someone else would take the reins, if only as a guiding hand. It seems denying culpability only gets you so far. The propaganda continued however - the Gang of Four had been spies, infiltrators of the highest order. Perhaps in a way it was true. It had certainly been a blunder of the highest order."

As such, all the awful, treasonous ideas of that clique of traitors would be collectively agreed to be eliminated - only this time, the shoe was on the other foot. It was his own ministers so eagerly dictating the removal of their predecessors' ideas. While Albert agreed with a few of these in principal, he most certainly disagreed with the gusto with which "his" ministers went about their business without consulting him.\n\nSpeer had always done his best to portray himself as the benevolent type of dictator, but that was becoming all the more difficult when his ministers' approach had shifted from velvet glove to iron gauntlet. The people had liked his new breed of more civil ministers, especially the students who had put him in this building in the first place. But god, if he didn't miss their bickering. He was certainly reminded of it enough by the pile of documents he had to plough through to eliminate their subversive influence.\n\nAnother law revoked - stamp. Another plan cancelled - stamp.

The open murder of former government officials claiming asylum was too brazen by half. They were instead watched from a distance, and Albert received reports on their activities every single day.\n\nHe recalled the mornings he had spent with Kiesinger, a cup of coffee and a sharp debate. Kurt had always been the easiest of them to deal with, the most realistic. Those talks had been spirited, but had never exasperated him nearly as much as that windbag Erhard. He had always seemed to have the right words to get what he wanted, and Speer would observe him running circles around him just as often as the other two.\n\nAlbert sipped his coffee and flicked through the report. Kiesinger had been talking to the Americans of course, who knew how long for. Every day he met with CIA agents, who were presumably digging for every scrap of information about Speer and his new government.

Schmidt did not like many of the people he worked with. He did not like many of the policies his government had. He seemed to dislike the Reich as an institution.\n\nNow of course, Speer knew that was exactly the case. Schmidt was a subversive, probably in league with Reichsbanner before he was forced to make his escape. While Erhard maintained himself by mooching off the economists of his host nation and Kiesinger was feeding the government information on a slow drip, Schmidt was openly denouncing his birth country, writing his tell-all memoirs. The informants in his household had managed to acquire a photograph of a page for his perusal.

Now he was extolling the virtues of his own miraculous economic system, which would have saved the Reich from every damning flaw it had, real or imagined.\n\nThe Americans were eating it up by the sounds of it.

When he exhaled, he set the papers down he had in his hand on the table, and hid a smirk as he looked to everyone else. "Gentlemen." He began, addressing Tresckow, Schmidt, and Kiesinger. "Please observe the papers in front of you. I've contacted the finest engineers for this."\n\nIt was a mixture of documents and blueprints, detailing a model of a train, and a plan laid over Germany. "It's a high speed railway that I've concocted. Utilizing the most advanced technology we have at our disposal, we'll build a network that can take you from Frankfurt all the way to Danzig in just a few hours." Nods among everyone.\n\n"Herr Tresckow, I'd like you to whip the army into giving us some supplies in exchange for partially using this project as a substitute for military convoys. Herr Kiesinger, I want you to root out any and all people who would even consider delaying this project and have them fired before we get boots on the ground. Herr Schmidt, I'd like you to keep this on stand-by. Once we start making progress, you'll be the figurehead about the..." Erhard waved his cigar around. "Reich's progress, and whatnot.

Schmidt replied dryly, leaning forward and grabbing a document he had just been reading. Some report about a violent incident between police and Polish ex-slaves. He could read it later, right now someone demanded his attention. "Though I naturally presume there's more to it than that, yes?"\n\n"Oh, how do you know me so well?" The smile could be heard through the line. "But yes, you are correct. I want to offer you some aid, you see. Some cash injections there, some greasing palms here... things to ease up your work. Because it's bound to run into complications as it keeps growing."\n\nDid Schmidt want to ask how much Abs knew? No, he didn't. And even if he did ask, he knew Abs would only give a half-answer at best. "Nothing comes for free with you," Schmidt pointed out, reaching one hand to pull out a cigarette pack from his pocket. "So what is it that I give in turn?" Then the lighter.\n\n"Simple, really. Cut me and my company some slack. Oh, don't worry about the aftereffects of such a decision. I know what you plan to do, so it'll really be a miniscule thing in the end. And I do know you want this railway of yours finished as swiftly and as efficiently as possible.

Really, they were so nosy...\n\nBut regardless, he was satisfied. Progress was going smoothly, and he had little doubts the project wouldn't be finished, considering how the future seemed peaceful and prosperous for the Reich. Yes... the high speed rail was one of the first of many projects to drag Germany out of the depths, and to reestablish their image as innovators. Naturally, he would be included among them, as the patron of such innovation. The railway got him thinking about his own projects, after all, and he even took a bit of inspiration from its design purpose. Clean, purposeful efficiency, one that could be easily draped with ideological inspiration.\n\nIn but a moment, the busybody of the station was added onto with another set of metal screeching against rails, accompanied by the hurried walking and talking of people and the transportation of goods between other trains. When everyone could see the sharp design of the bullet train coming into view, people cheered and clapped.

Herwig muttered under his breath, eyeing the young man in front of him who seemed particularly amused. "Could you cut it out, already?"\n\n"Get off it, man," the worker replied, flinching his hands away from the rifle. "We've got an hour left to go. What else do I do to pass the time? Smoke a pack? I'm not like everyone else on this train - I'm not smoking up a storm just to make the hour go by. So..."\n\n"So you keep touching the crate when I tell you not to. Why? Do you get some amusement out of that?" Herwig asked. "You know it's not a smart idea to go against what a soldier tells you, right?" His eyes narrowed, but that didn't seem to deter the man. Like a child, he ran a thumb across the tarp and almost seemed like he'd go and uncover what was under it- but then he felt the poke of Herwig's gun, and then the poke turned into a push.

As a reformist, he barely had any good news that came from the Reich, and he was, well... just a mere bureaucrat.

Jan wanted to extinguish some of the guilt in his heart that he felt for feeling like he was a coward for not joining a resistance group in eastern Europe, instead sticking his nose in a cushy job here. Yet it paid off. While he himself wasn't that important, he knew a lot of people who were, some of whom could... influence what 'cargo' would pass through these trains.\n\nWith a satisfied nod to himself after he read over the paper, Jan stood up and began to walk.

The other man, Bruno, gave him a large grin as he tipped Albrecht's empty glass with his own, full one, before taking a hefty swig.

Bruno spoke in a slightly louder voice to be heard amidst the several other workers who were talking. Though, it wasn't only workers. "When I get my paycheck from the government, I'll buy a cake for my little girl. Her birthday's only in two days." Albrecht gave an understanding nod. "So, you know," Bruno took another quick sip, "that's why I want to let loose. Can't exactly do this around my daughter, after all!"\n\n"I'd do the same if I had a kid, so I can't blame you." Albrecht replied. Bruno was about to say something else, but--\n\n"Let me go! Let me fuckin' go!" From the second floor, two police officers were restraining a teenager and bringing him downstairs. "Fucking fascist pig-do-" One of the officers yanked at the back of his hair, and he cried out, still thrashing in their grips. The pub went dead silent, except for the teenager's swearing.

There was a short storm of cheering and clapping before things settled down, and everyone seemed to be in various states of satisfaction, with Erhard and Speer being the most satisfied-looking.\n\n"With the railway now complete, the flow of goods between every end of the country will be vastly more efficient.

Did the fact that the company he had found and assigned for the railway project slack off from their work and cut corners make his own failure any less apparent? Certainly not. And now... ?\n\n"Of all the things, an oil crisis..." Speer groaned, rubbing his face in his hands. He had barely gotten a lick of sleep in the past two days, sorting through tons of paperwork.

The company is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. Another day and they may very well explode." That proposition was an expensive one. Not only would it be complicated to process through bureaucracy, just the job of reassigning people and finding new workers and materials to keep the project going - even at a crawl - would take weeks at the very least, with the current crisis likely making it take longer.\n\n"Yes, I suppose we must.

speer_railway.10.desc:0 "In the cold, biting wind of the night, Semyon breathed into his gloves and laid down on the dirt. The night felt so peaceful, far away from cities and even villages. All he could hear was the wind past his ears and the shuffling of his movement. He dug his boots into the mud and set the sniper rifle on the ground. He checked the bolt, readjusted the scope, and breathed deeply once, twice... three times. He remembered Alyona and Mischa and their beautiful faces and their deep smiles. Yes... it always managed to calm him down, even in his worst moments.\n\nAs his eye looked into the scope, he could see the strewn collection of dim lights in the makeshift camp, and the armed guards patrolling the area. He could see the towers and the barbed wire, and he smiled to himself. Pathetic. If only he could put a bullet into the Führer's skull for how much he despised his hypocrisy. Reformist this, reformist that, while Semyon stared into a camp staffed by guards and slaves meant to work on the railways. It disgusted him. He could imagine himself - there, in the Volkshalle, drenched in the blood and dying screams of Speer and his compatriots. Oh, he'd-\n\nHe'd... almost fired prematurely. Semyon sighed in frustration. His comrades were about to arrive soon. Their cause was not his, but he supported them in his time of need. Reichsbanner gave him a sniper rifle when he said he was a marksman from the times of the Soviets. They didn't mind his old age, nor his harsh tongue. He was a killer, even if he never wanted his little girls to know. His eye refocused. A man on one of the towers lit a cigarette, leaning against it and looking down. Did he feel guilt? Remorse? Hate? Was he doing this to feed his family in these trying times, in this crisis afflicting the world?\n\nExcuses. All that would be paid for in blood. Semyon's finger cradled the key to this man's death, and the Grim Reaper put his hand on the guard's shoulder.\n\nHis radio buzzed."

Rome defined itself by the mediterranean, their 'Mare Nostrum', while China, Portugal and Holland capitalised on spice flows to a greedy West. Humanity's first nations followed a similar origin point. Along the Indus, Yellow and Nile rivers, civilizations rose on the backs of boats carrying the boons of the agricultural revolution upstream and downstream. Preceding the building of any man's home is the greasing of palms, or a suitable means to begin doing so.\n\nModern nations follow the same principles. That's why, before the gun, a wise statesman has always picked the embargo; more discrete and far more vicious than it's lethal counterpart. Smith's prediction of a globalised economy has only assisted this balance further. One can defeat a breadless enemy before a single shot is fired.\n\nAll war must end, however, and today the economic war that the Reich and the United States have fought for decades is closing. The embargo has been lifted, and the lungs of the dormant commercial titan of the Hanseatic can breathe once more. Industrial works in the Ruhr bellow with a rejuvenated spirit, and the Germania Stock Exchange is entering what the Americans' call a 'bull market'. Both the Führer and the President have given optimistic speeches, celebratory words delivered from the Volkshalle and the White House, while their foreign ministries conclude business and return home in a better world.\n\nTomorrow, the sun will rise on an Atlantic at rest, with once bitter enemies shaking hands. In war, there are no winners, and in this peace history would seem to have produced two."

"You're saying there's a rebellion on?"\n\n"I'm not saying there's a rebellion, there IS a rebellion! They're all over the place!" The diplomat's voice crackled over the radio, the rattle of rifle fire occasionally making its way into the receiver. The fire was rapid, fast, and seemingly close. Helmut shifted as a mental picture began to form in his head.\n\n"So it's another slave rebellion. Well, shit, do what we did with the last one." He muttered into the phone, a hint of confusion mixing into his normal stately tone.\n\n"No, Helmut, you don't understand. This isn't some slave revolt. The whole fucking city is up in arms! They've got Reichsbanner flags, they're chanting-"\n\n"Reichsbanner?" A shot of excitement fired up Schmidt's spine, quickly followed by fear. This was simultaneously very good and very bad. "Shit, are you sure?"\n\n"We can't put this down! They've got guns, they've got ammo, I think they've stolen a few tanks- oh, shit!" The screeching of metal faintly pulsed through the receiver, quickly accompanied by the roaring of an angry crowd. "Fuck, ok, I've got to go. We're evacuating. Warschau is lost, repeat, Warschau is lost!" The line went dead with a slam.\n\nHelmut stood in disbelief, still glued to the phone. Finally, after a moment of silence, he dropped the receiver and rushed to the train station. This was going to be big."

Speidel, Schmidt, Kiesinger, Erhard, Tresckow- he could tell that each of them had rushed here on short notice. Their reactions were similarly varied- Speidel's calm exterior was betrayed by his deeply furrowed brow, Erhard and Tresckow both seemed worried, Kiesinger showed only mild interest, and Schmidt seemed to be almost excited at the thought. Speer regarded him with an extra stare before beginning. "So, give me a rundown."\n\n"Well, my Führer-" Speidel began, but was quickly cut off by Schmidt's quick talking.\n\n"My Führer, the Poles of Warschau have risen up, aided by the Reichsbanner. Apparently, this 'Spartakus' has made his presence known there, and they're setting up for a potential counterattack. The Polish government is in disarray- they're trying to set up a new government, but they're not having a good time of it. The rebels have gone about freeing the slaves, lifting the Nuremberg Laws, repealing restrictions-"\n\n"Why are you so excited about this, Helmut? They're fucking it all up! I've done so damn much for them and this is how they repay me? I don't know why I ever listened to any of you if all you do is give me problems!" Speer shouted, slamming his fist into the table. Schmidt recoiled, as did the rest of the Gang- this was new.\n\nThe sudden silence was broken by the entrance of the secretary, delivering a new report to the Führer. He read it, reread it, and then threw it in the air with a resounding "FUCK!""

That's all he's been doing for the entire time I've worked with him."\n\nKiesinger sighed. Perhaps he should have expected this- Speer's response to the slave siege some time ago hadn't exactly been a reasoned one. "In any case, my Führer, we can't truly have an effective response until we know how far this is going to spread. It'll do us no good to try and put out these fires while more are picking up."\n\n"Why don't you look yourself, Kiesinger? Here we are, with our plans unravelling before us, with everything the conservatives said would happen coming true, and you're all standing around here preaching the merits of the Reichsbanner? Hell, Schmidt's been basically on their side since he got here!" Speer snapped.\n\n"I never said I was in support of the slaves." Schmidt responded. Speer turned to him with an incredulous look.\n\n"Bullshit. You think I'm dumb, Helmut? I can see it on your face. You've been waiting for this for years." Schmidt opened his mouth to respond, but Kiesinger waved him off.\n\n"In any case, my Führer, we must wait until the cards fall. This is certain to get worse before it gets better." Kiesinger stated. As if to prove his point, the secretary returned, bearing more bad news. Speer groaned as he read it- before, at least it was confined to Poland. Now this was going to be a total mess."

Reports of isolated uprisings in factories, slave mobs arming themselves in the rebel holdouts, the occasional gunbattles with police and soldiers, and the slow consolidation of the rebels into an organized army. Every report that came in angered Speer even more, and only hardened his resolve against the other four men in this room.\n\nWhat a fool he was to trust them! Every step of the way, they had subverted his requests and gone against his orders. They had forced him, over and over, to agree with them and avoid collapse. Ever since he had brought them on, they had made his job harder than it ever had to be. And now, at the hour of Germany's greatest danger since World War II, here they were to subvert him again, poisoning his ideals and dragging Germany away from what made it such a power to start with.\n\nHe wouldn't take any more of it, he decided. From here on in, he would call the shots, not some petty idealists or fat capitalist or some old military man. As the report of the next city to fall- Minsk- came in, he made up his mind. Now was the time to really show who the true power in Germany was- him, Albert Speer."

speer_slaverevolt.5.desc:0 "As reports continued to roll in of spontaneous rebellions, clear trends began to emerge from the haze. Speer reviewed them and pieced them together, a master architect building his latest work- not one of stone or steel, but one of statitistics. The cities that had revolted so far all fit the same few categories. Kiew, Warschau, Minsk, Krakau- all were poor, eastern cities. None had been successfully Germanized. Each still had significant amounts of slaves, whether personal or company owned. Finally, the major kicker- each had abnomally high levels of Reichsbanner activity. Perhaps it was the relatively young demographics of each city, or perhaps it was the universities, but the pattern was clear. A plan formed in Speer's head- this was still controllable. With the right analysis and the right plan, he could stop this rebellion in its tracks.\n\nAnd then a revolt seized Riga, and the statistics crumbled away.\n\nRiga shared none of these tells with the other cities, besides a high slave population. It held a significant German minority. It was rich, even after the chaos that had engulfed Ostland years ago. It had not even had a major Reichsbanner presence. Yet, here it was, another angry red mark of revolt splintering the Reich. Speer put the paper down on his desk to join the pile, sighed, and tore the rest of his analysis off the corkboard. Perhaps there was no pattern to this. Perhaps there was no stopping it."

speer_slaverevolt.6.desc:0 "There had been one saving grace to the Slave Revolt- its adherence to the cities. Each revolt was confined merely to the city- painful, but containable. The Heer, mobilized to action by the Führer's personal order, sat in siege around the city, a complicated standoff ensuing between the slaves and the soldiers- neither side willing to fire first. As long as the revolt stayed inside the urban jungle, the Reich still stood.\n\nOf course, it didn't.\n\nSomehow, someway, the news spread to the slave plantations that still toiled in the countryside. One by one, the slaves found their spines, taking up arms against their masters and burning their fields to the ground. Mobs met each other and became armies, tearing through the countryside and burning any slaveowning home they found. Soon enough, the Wehrmacht found itself flanked, and, humiliatingly, was forced to retreat as the country slaves jubilously met with the students and rebels of the cities.\n\nAs the mood out east turned joyous, the mood in the Führer's office darkened. Speer slammed his fist into his table, barely suppressing an angry yell. This was all that rat bastard gang's fault. They had played with fire, and now the whole Reich would burn."

While indentured servants in the former Russian lands are far less than across the rest of the Reich, they still make up a considerable number, and it seems that the general chaos gripping the entire German colonial empire has emboldened them.\n\nAll across the Reichskommissariat, tens of thousands of slaves break their chains and assault the German garrisons overseeing their suffering, taking their weapons and establishing pockets of resistance in the Russian plains. They ask for freedom, and most of them are ready to fight to the death rather than kneel once more. If they are to die - this is the message relayed to Roenne - they will die as free men.\n\nEven though their numbers swell with every passing day, and local authorities struggle to protect the cities from the increasing wave of dissent, it seems that - unlike the metropolitan Reich - reaction is mounting. Reports tell of German regular forces regrouping under the leadership of Feldmarschall Schörner, and preparing for a counter-offensive: the general has sworn to return order to Russland, "no matter the cost.""

The men strode onwards with purpose, their overcoats fluttering behind them. They pushed through the door at the end of the corridor and marched up the crimson stairs, stepping around the crumpled bodies that punctuated every turn. When the gang reached the top, an armed officer saw them approach and thrust his hand into the air.\n\n"Heil Schörner!"\n\nFerdinand Schörner saluted in response. The traces of a smile were tugging at his lips, threatening to ruin his forcefully stern expression as he marched his men towards the cabinet room. At last, Moskau was his. Moskowien was his. The coup has been an absolute success, although naturally he had not been there to witness it.\n\nAnyone who dared resist the militarist infiltration of Moskau's government buildings - from the lowliest secretaries and guards to the highest politicians and generals - were shot on site. The rest were in the process of being deported to KZ like the traitors they were.\n\nThe men entered the cabinet room. Blood was splattered across the framed portraits that hung on the walls. Remer took a seat at the far end of the table and began speaking in a mockingly reedy voice, replicating Alexis von Roenne's mannerisms perfectly. The militarists cackled with laughter. A gunshot rang out somewhere on the floor below them.\n\nThe Reich cried out for a savior as the waves of treason threatened to drown it forever, and Schörner answered the call. A thin smile finally spread across his face. How long until his men were storming Germania and dragging the liberal rats out of the Reichstag by their ties?"

However, this one was clearly more important than any other- the Führer had even cleared out a space on his desk for it, an island of paper on a sea of hardwood. He looked up at the gang and placed a finger squarely on the text. "You want to know what this says?"\n\nSilence. Ashamed, total silence. No gang member even dared to stare into Speer's flaming eyes.\n\n"'Feldmarschall Schörner has, after his coup in Moskowien, seized control of revolting areas through swift, forceful action. From the little information we are currently receiving, Reichsbanner rebels have either retreated into hiding or fled." Speer read, matter of factly. He looked up again when he finished. Still, none of the others dared to respond. "You know what this means? It means that Ferdinand fucking Schörner is the Reich's face of stability and action, and we're standing around with our pants down!"\n\n"Well, my Führer, Schörner has the luxury to just run over protestors with tanks-" Schmidt started. Speer cut him off with a furious wave of his hand.\n\n"And why can't we do the same? They're the rebels. If the American students started shooting at their soldiers, they wouldn't pussyfoot around with their response, would they?"\n\nSilence- a stunned, disbelieving silence- entered the room. Slowly, the Gang filed out, and Speer sat back down. That was certainly too far, but was it not a justified outburst? If Germania didn't do something and fast, Schörner would do it for them, and then they'd be in real trouble."

Aided by the Polish resistance, thousands of freed indentured laborers assaulted isolated barracks, police stations and other strategic locations all across central Poland, arming themselves with anything they could find: unprepared for an uprising of this magnitude, the German forces found themselves scattered and easy prey for partisans and enraged slaves.\n\nWith the central government unable to answer due to the mainland having the exact same problems, - only a hundred times worse - central Poland is effectively no-man's land. Bands of slaves roam the countryside and the cities, but without a unified leadership they act as they please: some merely try to return home, while others sack houses and stores, attacking all German settlers in sight."

Under the current circumstances, the first choice was preferred, though it is unknown whether the decision was motivated by humanity or lack of means.\n\nWith the German garrison gone, and the central government still reeling from the magnitude of what's happening, very few believe that the Reich will try to reclaim Galicia soon. Thousands of Russian and Ukrainian slaves roam the region, some of them moving East trying to find a way home, while others take advantage of the lack of security to exact their vengeance upon those unlucky enough to have been left behind."

Should the Reich fail to restore order, the revolt may overwhelm Kiew and Eastern Ukraine, and in such case, German control over Eastern Europe will soon collapse."

While the German military managed to secure the lands directly bordering Eastern Prussia, they couldn't stray too far from the metropolitan Reich due to the risk of overextension: Letgallen was just outside the reach of the Wehrmacht, and local authorities barely had the time to evacuate to the military-controlled areas before the entire region was overrun by slave revolts.\n\nThe loss of this strategic region East of Riga opens the way for the revolt to reach the rest of the former Baltic Republics, where the recent civil war following the collapse Reichskommissariat Ostland has left many scars, some of which still aren't healed. The central government has started to debate the best solution to fight the uprising, but unless drastic measures are taken immediately, the situation will most likely continue, and infect even more regions."

With the Baltic region under rebel control, the Reich can no longer reinforce Belarus by land, which makes it the perfect candidate for the next stage of the uprising."

With barely enough time to gather their families, the officials were hurriedly evacuated alongside most of the garrison.\n\nWith the fall of Minsk, one of the main centers of German administration in Eastern Europe, the chain of command is quickly coming apart as the remaining minor administrations desperately try to save themselves from what is felt more and more like a looming doom.

Faced with the prospect of having to fight to the death against a human wave, or call the Luftwaffe and burn the city to ashes to keep order, the commander chose retreat.\n\nWithin a few hours, the government and their families were evacuated to Crimea in a heavily-escorted convoy, immediately followed by most remaining German forces and all those who feared for their lives. Without a functioning administration, order across Ukraine is collapsing: while the revolt is yet to hit the eastern part of the country, the Reich fears it will touch the Caucasus, one of the regions with the highest percentage of slaves in the entire Reich."

For the people, it was when the news reports began to talk about how the Heer was "containing" the unrest. For Schörner, it was when his men stopped reporting casualty numbers from skirmishes with the Reichsbanner.\n\nYes, it was a peace- a shaky one, built only on the unwillingness of Germany to attack, but a peace. Soldiers on both sides dug in, from the forests of Lithuania to the fields of Ukraine. The Reichsbanner's rebellion had torn the Reich in half, literally- one half dominated by Schörner and his militarists, undoubtedly plotting for the final blow against Speer and his reformism. The other half digging in, trying to find some way to end the crisis before the winds of revolution spread further. Between them, a red strip of land, dominated by idealists, slaves, and students.\n\nIt was a powderkeg waiting to blow, but for now, the spark was not yet lit.

In this chaotic situation, worrying reports are filtering: they talk about hundreds of mercenaries reaching Aserbaidschan from Moskowien and by airplane, paid for by the corporations and led by a former SS-turned-mercenary called Otto Weidinger.

The city was evacuated soon after.\n\nAs the local administration and the remaining soldiers flee towards Moskowien to find refuge, the government in Germania reels from the hit.

When the first uprisings began in the countryside, and smaller cells became active in the city itself, all valuable assets were evacuated by ship to Crimea, where the administration is trying to reorganize and resist.\n\nAs communications struggle to come to and from Germania, the situation grows even more difficult.

The Kriegsmarine patrols the coast in force, and the naval command of Theodericstadt has deployed elite marine detachments at key locations in the city: all guns and rifles are ready to open fire upon anyone foolish enough to threaten their home base, armed or not.

Baku's Gauleiter is currently being detained "for incompetence and corruption" until a "proper trial" can be held. The government in Germania immediately branded Weidinger's men as traitors and ordered their arrest, but even the Führer knows these are but empty words: with no way to transport troops to Baku due to the Slave Revolt, and the not-so-subtle threat of sabotaging the oil drills hanging in the air, the central government can only wait.\n\nSuspicions are arising, however, over a massive air lift paradropping weapons and supplies from Moskowien, paid for by corporations deeply tied to Abs, Flick and their clique of industrialists.

Moskowien might be Schörnerland for now, but this place isn't at least.\n\nThe general has wasted no time since our arrival: Roenne is a man known for his personal bravery and his intelligence, but even I who has known him for some time could barely believe how quickly he has established control over the place.\n\nSchörnerites, rebellious natives, general troublemakers all dealt with. With very little bloodshed I might add. Guess him having a god-fearing mindset does have it's benefits huh?\n\nAnyway Oberkommando Sankt Petersburg is what we call ourselves now. Really the fancy name aside it basically means everyone who wants to run from Schörner goes here, Russian and German alike.Seeing them fortify this place side by side has been a surreal experience, even for Moskowien standards. Common enemy and all that I guess.\n\nI have been digging trenches all day. And yesterday and probably tomorrow. Schörner will come eventually and this city isn't going to defend itself...\n\nI just hope Sieglinde and the boys are safe over in Narva. It isn't Moskowien but it's right at the border. And when this whole thing picks up steam it will spill over. I guess the only thing I can do at the moment is to swing that shovel. Or else seeing them again won't be happening on way or another.\n\nDiary of an Unknown Soldier 19XX"

Squeezed between the hostile Romanians and the encroaching freedom fighters, the administration has opted for the most sensible option: during the night, the central hub of Tiraspol was completely evacuated, and all personnel and materials evacuated to Mykolaiv, where hastily-confiscated civilian ships would bring them to safety.\n\nWith the collapse of German rule in Transnistria, almost all of Ukraine is now lost. Despite the profused effort, the government in Germania remains unable to put an end to the growing unrest in Eastern Europe: already some are talking about an imminent retaliation from autonomous governors in the region, led by Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner, even though such an eventuality is strongly denied by Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt.""

"We are all here because of the destructive monster that is known as the German Reich. The innumerable evils it has committed have shocked the world into silence - but no more! No longer shall Adolf Hitler's vile ideology spread any further, kill any more people!" A sort of frenzy of cheering was met in response, for but a moment drowning out the hopelessness and desperation. "I wish for you all to listen. I know of your hatred. All of it is deserved, all of it! To wish for my people to be thrown out of Europe for their crimes, but please- listen, listen to what I have to say! We must end this cycle of hatred here and now!" The cheering voices remained powerful, but quieter than before.\n\n"I know of a Germany - the true Germany, which the Nazis have attempted to eradicate," Brandt took in a deeper breath. "But it shall never die! The light of a democratic Germany can never be extinguished! There is a better future for Europe! We must not stand as slave and master, as Aryan and non-Aryan. We must stand as brother to brother, sister to sister, equal to equal! So please, on behalf of all of Europe, I beg you. Forgive us, for those who have been murdered by this regime never had the chance to!" His hands tightened into fists. His teeth grit harder. The people judged him with their silence. "Forgive us, oh, people of Europe, even if we do not deserve a shred of sympathy, those who know better will continue to fight for freedom." His voice trailed in strength and began showing cracks, and the air became stiff.\n\nWilly Brandt slowly landed on his knees, and bowed his head deeply. As the seconds passed, and nobody said anything, they could notice his frame shaking. And from the shaking, two tears dropped to the wooden platform. He expected the people to suffocate him with their silence, but as one man began to clap, so did ten, so did a hundred, so did a thousand. And as he looked up at those who dared to fight for their freedom, he let a wobbly smile come to his face."

He already knew where it would go, though. The man's words were weak, his case even weaker, his will perhaps the weakest. When the judge asked him to bow, he kneeled.\n\n"The court hereby declares Willy Brandt to be a traitor to the Reich. The sentence is death."\n\nHe had been in a few trials during his life, but none were as short and as decisive as this. When two men approached him, he struggled against the handcuffs that forced him to his bench, and even spat out a curse to one of the men - it meant nothing, however. The bag was stuffy and hard to breathe in, and it was almost impossible to see out of it. He felt bitter when he figured out where they were going. Just like the family of the Tsar in Russia, they would take him to a basement and murder him in cold blood. No martyrization. No publicization.\n\nWhen Brandt's head slammed against the concrete wall, his vision swam, and he could feel warm blood seep through his hair. Weakly, his limbs struggled against each other, in a vain attempt to get on his feet, as all the joy and idealism in the world faded from him. This was a Willy Brandt whose light in the world had faded, and though he believed in a Germany free and happy, his efforts had been torn down to nothing. Countless smouldered in death and ruin for his vision. When he heard the overpowering yell that signalled the end, Willy Brandt's hope died before he did."

They threw him against a wall and cried out an order. Several rifles were pointing straight at him.\n\nSchörner staggered to his feet, still clutching his stomach.

Both men, however, seemed to be dallying with time, running deep into the night but still a thought that preoccupied both of their minds remained. "I think we can finish it here, Herr Tresckow."

He strode to the front, stopping in front of a group of men, each one anxious and perhaps a tad bit annoyed that Remer had called them here. Remer knew that the men assembled before him would listen. They were the strongest men he knew, and the most devoted to the cause. These were his friends, his compatriots. These army men, cold as steel and heartless as dogs, were the closest family Remer had ever known. And they would never betray the Reich.\n\nThey had all trudged along behind Schörner when Speer had sent him to Moscow. Through snow, through sleet and hail, and through the damndest humiliation that Speer could visit on them. Even now, Remer pictured Speer's face and only thought of the hate that he held for the decrepit little man who would lead the Reich to an early grave, with his liberal ideas and spineless pandering. Now, Ferdinand Schörner, the man whom Remer had looked up to most, had risen in revolt against the German Reich. Disgusting. Remer began to speak. "What are we, but the most devoted of National Socialists?"\n\nRemer began gruffly. "And what are National Socialists without our home nation?" He continued, the script becoming less clear in his mind as he spoke from the heart. "Friends, I know we all hold Feldmarschall Schörner in the highest place in our hearts. We have known the man for years, and he has never been short of an exemplary man. But now, he has risen against the German Reich. He has spat upon the Führer-ship, regardless of whose shoulders it rests upon."\n\nRemer paused, glancing around at a shocked and blank-faced audience. "You know I speak the truth. When we greet one another, we heil the Reich and Führer, not traitors and splitters. And when we march to battle, we again do it for the Reich and Führer." Remer scoffed. "Schörner has gone too far, and reached too high. For National Socialism, for the German Reich, I cannot fight beside him any longer.

Kiesinger cut the silence.\n\n"Speidel, you're saying we remain quiet?" The general nodded. "Right... and the hope in doing so is that the slaves will eventually reach out to us, seeing as how we will not plan any moves of our own."\n\n"If I may," Erhard cut in. "Shouldn't we move our troops away from the border, just to let them know that we don't mean any harm?" The moment he was done, his eyes flicked to the Führer, who began speaking as soon as Erhard bit the cigar between his teeth.\n\n"And let the bandits move in and pillage our German settlers?!" He shouted. The rest stared in silence. "Ridiculous, t-this is sheer insanity- they can't even control themselves to act peacefully, let alone we decide to give them so much trust that they do not deserve!"\n\nNobody spoke for the next few seconds, and Speer's eyes settled from one person to another, and then back again, and then back again, and his trembling hands scratched the table idly. "What are you looking at me for? Come on, speak! Pretend I'm not here! Bolsheviks, the lot of you, I..."\n\nSpeidel decided to return his look to Kiesinger and speak on his own behalf.

I am at the helm of Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, naturally, but I come to you with an offer. Your government has been deathly silent as of recent, and it is slowly beginning to unnerve the army of Free Europe. Some say that you are preparing for an attack, but I know better. Come, Helmut Schmidt. You have been the representative of Germany's more humane face, have you not? I ask you to present this letter to Herr Speer freely. I suppose, in the end, it is his letter to read. Now, here is what I have to say.\n\nWe shall hold a meeting in Warsaw, in the St. Alexander's Church. I pick it because it is a holy place, and no holy place should be a battlefield for violence. I will also ask you another, perhaps more important thing. As a show of peace, I ask of you to come with only you and your diplomats. There is no need for guns to march between priests and crosses. I am uncertain if you shall follow through with this, but if you do, I will remain ever grateful for the move.\n\nAnd my final statement will be this. To Herr Speer, to you, Helmut Schmidt, to Ludwig Erhard, to Kurt Georg Kiesinger, to Henning von Tresckow. I should congratulate you all for taking Germany so far. It was as dark as shadows before, and for a while I had feared for its existence. But my hope has strengthened, and I am joyous that the free, humane, and democratic Germany still lives. Thank you for your cooperation, and if all goes well, I shall be seeing you soon.\n\n- Willy Brandt."\n\nThere was no time to ponder. Helmut Schmidt had to choose."

The only one he recognized by face was Willy Brandt, but he could recognize the others by association. One was Karol Józef Wojtyła, a Catholic priest who Schmidt could immediately recognize in his clothing. Another was Viacheslav Chornovil, though he did not know much of him, and the last was Nadezhda Troyan, former NKVD agent and assassin of Wilhelm Kube. He did not like her beliefs, though respected her guts to do such a thing. All of them, however, remained silent, as Brandt approached him.\n\n"Well, if it isn't the famous Helmut Schmidt." With a wide smile, he brought his hand out and the two gave each other a strong handshake. "I take it that you are a bit more sympathetic to our cause than that friend of yours you call Herr Speer?"\n\nSchmidt, at first, bit his tongue. He didn't want to risk saying the wrong thing - but then he realized just where exactly he was. "Friend..." He huffed a laugh through his nose. "Is not exactly what I would call him, but that's neither here nor there. It will be a pleasure to negotiate these dealings with you, Herr Brandt. I have much reason to support your cause."\n\nBrandt gave Schmidt a sharp look and a sly smile. "To support implies that you have done nothing yet to aid the cause of the Reichsbanner."

"I could not guarantee their safety, though there would be hell to pay if anyone decided to commit violence to them." Brandt let out a short laugh. "Good, good. Now, the final demand." He cleared his throat.\n\n"On the matter of repatriation. I demand that Germany begin immediate and extensive reparations to all slaves and their families.

Finally, he turned his head to the heavy gates that had been the end of their world for three decades, and he saw them open, the first ray of the morning sun carving a path to the exit: he knew it then, he knew how Moses had felt when the waters of the Red Sea had opened before him. He knew now what needed to be done."

It was the priest that was documented - lightly, unfortunately, as all he knew was that he was a worshipper belonging to the Catholic faith, and that his colleagues called him quite a good one at that. Now they were opposing each other on the table that stood in the middle of the church, and the warm graces of Wojtyła's voice soothed Schmidt's nerves.\n\n"I am no German," he began, his thick Polish accent rising through the silence, "but I'm sure you will understand me all the same." Schmidt gave a polite nod, and ushered him to continue. Wojtyła gave a light smile.\n\n"My son, I am sure you are aware that there cannot be peace in this... Einheitspakt of yours, unless its people are allowed to voice their opinions freely." Schmidt pressed his hands together. The worst was out of the way. Now came what he would call the 'secondary demands', and here he would have to weigh whether to hold back or push in. The priest continued. "I merely ask you this. Let them have their voices be heard. Many fight against it... the change that your Reich has brought. Not only in Germany, but everywhere else, too. I see them fighting for something better. The rest, I am sure, share my sentiments."\n\nThe rest - Brandt, Viacheslav, Nadezhda, all of them nodded silently. Schmidt, meanwhile, sighed. "I understand, Herr Wojtyła. I would love to do this, it's just..." He ran a hand through his hair. "So much backlash is put at risk. I-"\n\nWojtyła didn't seem phased. "Come, raise your head up." Schmidt, intentionally or not, listened to the man. "I trust in you. Even if your people have destroyed us so much, and for so long." He did not speak at all in a way a diplomat should speak. Schmidt found some comfort in it. "You will make the right choice. Now... what do you say, Herr Schmidt?""

When the officer's hand disappeared under the desk, the small group trembled, but when it reappeared it held a small handbook with practical indications for the police: with a grimace, he read aloud.\n\n"Extract from the Law on Manifestation of Political, Social and Economical Thought, as approved by the Reichstag and published in the Reichsgesetzblatt [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong].\nSection 1, Paragraph 1: "manifestation of political, social and economical thought is free in accordance of the provisions contained within this law"\nParagraph 2: "the conducts described in the above Paragraph are subject to authorization by the Ordnungspolizei"\nParagraph 3: "the conducts described in Paragraph 1, if lacking the authorization mentioned in Paragraph 2, are punishable according to administrative and criminal law"\nSection 2, Paragraph 1: "The authorization mentioned in Section 1, Paragraph 2 is to be requested to the local office of the Verwaltungspolizei within the Ordnungspolizeidivision district"\nParagraph 2: "the request must, under penalty of rejection, contain: A) exact itinerary of the manifestation; B) names of the promoters; C) insurance that the manifestation will not result in C1) violence; C2) illicit conducts; C3) delegitimation of the Reich and its organs""\n\nWith each word, the officer's frown deepened, but he knew his duty. When Gunther gave him the request, he examined it, and when at the third look he couldn't find anything illegal, he stamped it and put it in his desk.

Perhaps it would take time, but their black uniforms would become a mere reminder of what had been, and would soon fade into the past.\n\nThe final moment of the rally was when the promoters read the names of those who had been killed during the past manifestation: "martyrs of freedom" whose names and deeds would "never be forgotten".

Four decades of political oppression and single-party system finished the job, and now most Germans had become used to living in a country where political freedom simply didn't exist.

"All this talk about slavery and laws and such is great, but there's something I've wanted to bring up. My dear home of Ukraine, you see, I've always felt like it's had so much potential." Schmidt raised an eyebrow. He was certainly talkative. "I could imagine it, the democratic principle; the Reich, however, well, they've chosen not to allow any of it. Even after massacring my people, they haven't given us any gift. Not even a token one."\n\nSchmidt's stomach sunk. Generalplan Ost was a specter that would haunt Europe forever, wouldn't it? "Am I to assume this is talking about allowing democratization of members of the Einheitspakt?"\n\nViacheslav nodded enthusiastically. "You're quick on your feet, Mister Schmidt! That's exactly what it's about! A healthy nation holds elections and elects people who know what they're doing, where they're doing it, and how! I want that - the liberalization, I mean - to be applied in full force across Europe in the countries that Germany keeps putting under its heel. What about it, Mister Schmidt? Is that a deal?"\n\n"Well..." Schmidt rubbed the back of his neck. "This action would cause uproar back home. As tense as the situation is right now, I'm uncertain if we can afford it.

Yet Schmidt had disappointed Brandt.\n\n"What is it, Brandt?"\n\nThey discussed the matters of protesting, too. Both men were in agreement about how important it was to showcase that the nation did allow itself to display that the people were free, that they had a voice. But what Schmidt differed from Brandt was how to go about it. Brandt scrutinized Schmidt for a while after they came to terms, to determine if he truly believed that the time for protesting was a transformation, a process that had to be carefully managed, or was it something else?\n\n"Are you a coward?"\n\nSchmidt felt the question was like a dagger pressed to his heart. He knew that Brandt had wanted to press him, but this... being so blunt and so direct contrasted the previous, friendly nature that the man had shown him. Doubt coursed through his mind, and as Brandt stared at him with that same look he gave after Schmidt offered his suggestion of a compromise, words failed him momentarily.

The slurred voice of Willy Brandt alerted Schmidt to his presence, and he turned his head to see the revolutionary smile tiredly towards him. "I'm... glad you listened."

"I was w-worried, frankly, that- well, no need to bring your spirits down. You want a drink, Schmidt?" A distinct lack of 'Herr', but neither man seemed to mind.\n\nHesitance painted his words. "... Sorry, Herr Brandt. Not much of a drinker. I'm also a diplomat, and diplomats should probably lay off the alcohol," he said, pointedly giving a half-serious glare towards Brandt, who looked at him with a smile that cracked into grin after a few seconds.

"I don't wish to be rude, but... what happened to your father?" The man paused to only listen to the sublime developments of the music.\n\n"When the Nazi horde stormed Moscow, he was..." He sighed.

Thirty years ago I watched my home be engulfed in evil, and that same evil pretends to make amends with us?" The piano overlapped with itself, and Grigory could picture it.\n\nRubble that crushed men and women without care, and soldiers digging shallow ditches and riddling children full of holes. Nothing could have been worse. "Nothing could have matched the sheer cruelty thirty years ago." Grigory said. "Not one thing in the world. And yet...""

After haggling with the Gang of Four for so long, listening to their bothersome demands all the time - again and again and again; he had wondered if he would ever find an escape to the madness. But here? As Speer stood in front of the Volkshalle, his movements fluid, his speech sharp, his visions emboldened, what stopped him now? As he decried Willy Brandt, as he decried Reichsbanner, the slaves both now and former who grabbed their rifles and shotguns and desired freedom, he felt liberated.\n\nHow energetic he felt. He could barely contain himself after the speech was finished. Those violent thoughts he had, of slaves being gunned down, men dying by the droves, now had become reality. Did they deserve it? Perhaps not. Perhaps they merely did not know better, and thought that violent uprising was a smarter solution that to remain put and loyal like good subjects of the Reich. It didn't matter now. All the pieces were falling together, the painting would finally be complete, and this would mark the beginning of a new era. Nothing mattered now.\n\nNothing."

After struggling to read a few paragraphs over and over, trying to remember and understand the words written out in front of him, he let out a frustrated sigh and set it down against the table. What had happened gnawed at his mind. Of everything that he was expecting Albert Speer to do... of everything that could have happened, he had decided to risk everything just so that he could have a shot at fulfilling his revenge. A fool. A madman. That's what Speer was.\n\nThe knocks on his door jolted him awake, and though he was initially gripped by fear, he quickly steadied his nerves, making himself comfortable in his seat and giving a quick roll of his shoulders as two men came in. He had called them in this morning, and, now that they had finally arrived, Schmidt could calm his own worries somewhat. With a sharp, professional tone, he addressed them both.\n\n"For your silence, expect your paychecks to be increased significantly. In return, I want not a word of this to escape anywhere.

The things Erik had to do to join this newly-formed anti-terrorist group made him regret coming, but how could he back out now?\n\nWith the swastika emblazoned on his urban camouflage clothing, a variety of utilitarian tools at his side and a rifle that slung over his back, he and a couple of other RSG-9 members had hastily exited their barracks and made their way to an abandoned two-story house that was repurposed as a building to practice hostage rescue scenarios. It was deep into the night when they pulled up and prepared themselves, reciting through the countless hours of forced listening they had to go through.\n\nThat brought him here. When Erik kicked in the door, he felt his head go light, but procedures had to be followed, and through the pain that pulsed across his body, the headache that made his mind feel raw and vulnerable, and the resulting gunshots that rung his ears as he screamed out methodical orders to both would-be terrorists and his own two men, he wondered to himself; wandering through with gun and flashlight, nerves frayed yet still on edge - what would his skills be pressed for? The former slaves? The students? ANTIFA? None seemed particularly dangerous, yet Erik was put through hell for a reason only the higher-ups would know. He could only theorize one answer."

Of course he wasn't, but why did he feel so nervous? Erhard looked at himself in the mirror. Things had developed far since the devastation of the civil war. With his genius, Germany pulled itself out of the rubble and soared once again. Then came all of his reforms, as dangerous as they were, as utterly maddening it was to many, it worked. Too well, in fact.\n\nNothing good can last forever. Germany's economy was strong, but built on glass links. It was a powerhouse, yet when the oil crisis had come to strike Germany, it bled like a stuffed pig, too weak to fend itself as it relied on its shared feed. Not only that, people were waking up to the fact that not all was well. They would demand change, and if there was anything Erhard hated, it was his efforts being undone.\n\nWith a sigh, Erhard shut the lights to the bathroom and prepared to go to sleep; his mind was overfilled with thoughts, though he knew that there was always more work to be done.

Everything had gotten so much easier ever since Speer had managed to make his moves.

 speerphase3.4.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt massaged his temple with one hand as the other held a letter in its shaking grip. Several of his most important duties as Reichsminister had been transferred to his State Secretary, Martin Mußgnug. That smug little fascist had been granted greater powers of oversight, effectively placing him on top of the Ministry's bureaucracy. It wouldn't be long before Mußgnug began promoting his own lackeys to key positions and sidelining Schmidt's closest friends. Schmidt placed the letter down silently. The walls were closing in.\n\nLudwig Erhard groaned when he had read the letter that arrived at his table. In one fell swoop, his position as Reichsminister for Economic Affairs had been transformed into a ceremonial facade. All of the power would now pool around Hans Kehrl, his State Secretary. What nonsense was this? Did Speer harbor no gratitude, no respect for Erhard's efforts? He had dragged the German economy from the brink of collapse, and yet the Speerite scum had been more than happy to thrust their judgmental fingers towards him when the Oil Crisis hit. Erhard slammed the letter down in fury and desperately reached for a cigar. Kehrl was a competent replacement. That scared him the most.\n\nHenning von Tresckow gently placed the phone down, his face pallid. Earlier in the day he had heard Speidel mumbling about his aching joints and migraines, his jovial smile betrayed by two sad eyes. Tresckow wasn't a fool. He knew that the strongest voice calling for an apolitical Wehrmacht was on the verge of retirement. Yet what he hadn't expected, what he could never have expected, was the news he received that evening. General Otto Ernst Remer had been appointed Chief of Staff of the OKW and placed in control of appointments and organisation. Despite his militaristic leanings, he had already begun filling new positions with Speerite officers. Loyal to the chain of command through and through, von Tresckow thought bitterly.

It was an incredibly detailed map of Europe, stretching from one end to the other, and the details were all lovingly crafted and placed with great detail. He felt particularly pleased when he observed the Einheitspakt. Germany's territorial expansion bloomed - so much territory, so densely packed, so rich with people, industry and resources, it filled him with a sense of joy, that the Reich truly was the dominator of Europe.\n\nBut the Gang of Four had forced his hand into doing something that he was never truly satisfied with. The Reichskommissariats were an inefficient thing, a product of a past era - riddled with corruption and slavery. He could understand the concerns of some with the concept of the Reichsländer, but to Speer, the idea was such that he couldn't possibly pass it by. Direct subjects of the Reich, with a vague semblance of freedom; while they would never officially undergo the process of Germanization, seeing that it was well and truly too expensive and risky of a process, they would still be influenced by German civilization.\n\nThat night Speer had decided. The collaborationists had to go. The natives wouldn't be pleased with it, and he would have to make it a slow process, but he knew, in his heart, that this would be better for all. For the Reich to receive its just rewards of victory, and for the men and women of the East to be taught their place. They needn't become Aryans, no, though in time they would come to appreciate the finely crafted machine that was German culture. No, they needed to do only one thing."

He found it beautiful, yes, but there were so many other things that had occupied his time that he could not spare a visit to it. Now, however, he felt at ease. When Adolf Hitler had died, his body had been transported to Germania and been given a proper burial and a memorial service even as the civil war had raged on - but Speer, with his personal funds, and over the course of the decade, had asked, petitioned, and convinced for the body of Hitler to be moved to Linz. His love of the city was strong, and in turn, so was Speer's.\n\nNot only that, however. His body did not deserve to be in a mere grave to rot. Instead, Speer had built a mausoleum for his predecessor, and he had meticulously planned every inch of it. As he stood in front of the tomb that housed his paternal figure, he smiled. Everything about it was right. All the details, the vaguely religious yet still National Socialist elements that covered the inside. Perhaps, in a way, this was his greatest work yet - barring Germania, of course.\n\nBut he hadn't come merely to admire his own architectural genius. No, there was something more. There was a man he had respected for as long as he had lived, and now he had passed. Yet Speer never truly gave him the proper respect he deserved. For without him, there would be no Reich to begin with - but without Speer, the Reich would not have survived. As he kneeled in front of the tomb, he uttered no prayer, he made no motion of bowing to a deity. Instead, his was a silent admiration of the highest degree.\n\nEverything Albert Speer had learned from his father was now passed on to him, yet reshaped, moulded to serve the rapidly-changing future. Would he have understood it? Speer wouldn't know; but he would have respected him. For now there was no need to play nice with the enemies of the Reich. Power was his, and no other's. He was the NSDAP, and the NSDAP was his. A sort of tingling pride was felt in him, a sensation that he was, as treacherous as it would have been to say, an even better leader than he who had guided him all those years. As Speer stood up, having finally paid his dues, his mind was steeled, and his goal was simple. The only path was forward. The only solution was one."

"Have you ever thought that you would get this far?"\n\n"Oh, the musings of a drunk economics minister," Tresckow cut in, giving a light smile. "No need to ask him such pointless questions about the past." Erhard found that ironic, considering who Tresckow was, but the small grin didn't betray such an emotion to the Prussian, it seemed. "Like the tracks of a tank, they are meant to push forwards, not backwards!" As Schmidt finished up and wiped his mouth with a napkin, he gave a short cough.\n\n"Gentlemen." He began, giving a short nod. "I didn't expect to get this far, no, but we are here now. While Speer is now practically our puppet legislator-" He seemed particularly pleased at being able to say those words with genuinity. "Much of Germany is still against us, the NSDAP particularly.

After all, we discuss with each other enough about our plans, don't we? I believe this night is one of a deserved break.

A free Germany, rid of Nazi ideology - and what would have been a long, in-depth conversation in secrecy had its bearings shattered and torn out when a certain someone made an unexpected visit.\n\n"I have seen your efforts, dear friends of mine," Hermann Josef Abs spoke, standing in the doorway as seven faces stared at him, a mix of fear, worry, and shock.

My interests are much more than a mere slavedriver company in Germany. I have something far more valuable that remains, and shall remain, fully untouched. It is, however, something I can offer you all."\n\nErhard's hand shook, and he was tempted to slam it on the table, to demand that he get out.

Is that your 'something' you are referring to?"\n\nAbs nodded, taking a step into the room. "National Socialism is dying. The NSDAP doesn't understand that, but you all do.

Perhaps he was afraid of coming back to it and to be swallowed in its memories, as then and even now, there was no time to afford for traces of weakness. But things had changed. Things were different now. As Schmidt walked through the rich morning of the city, where his eyes would have focused on vain, oversized Nazi banners were residents in apartments living out their daily lives; where he would see soldiers patrolling the streets, there were men and women fighting for a better Germany. Raising the banner of freedom, to voice their anger in protests that shook the city's peace.\n\nThe city was no longer familiar to Schmidt, but nostalgia still pulled him inwards. Hitler and his regime had built it up in such a way that even when he had visited Barmbek, the old village where he spent his childhood days, there was barely anything that resembled what he had known for two decades, and he had walked through it like he would have any other district. There was one place, however, that would remain unchanged - and it was just next to Barmbek.\n\nThe Außenalster always remained the same. He knew the Nazis couldn't have tainted its water. Somewhere along the coast, Schmidt had stood at the edge of the water and stared as all the sailing boats passed. He remembered being on one with his father as a child, demanding to go back in and loop around when they were done. Now there were so many others. People, sometimes alone and sometimes together, and sometimes with their children, enjoying themselves in a way that was now alien to him. Yet the air was so much lighter now. Ten years since Schmidt had entered into the dark tunnel, the light had begun to pour in. So much fear, so much anxiety, contrasted by the serenity of the peace that he felt while in Hamburg.\n\nSchmidt looked down at his arm. That bright, burning reminder that seared his flesh and assaulted his mind whenever he looked at it. The armband he wore that was a constant reminder that he deserved to be afraid, deserved to die. But no more would he force himself to follow the orders of a mad man. He had done what many could never do. He did not feel prideful for it, as a man who dodges a death sentence would feel proud about avoiding the inevitable. Instead, as his fingers tugged under the fabric, and it slid across his arm, he felt relief. Sheer, unmitigated relief.\n\nWhen the armband slipped from his wrist and slid against and out from the grasp of his fingers and landed in the water with a silent thump, Schmidt breathed. Everything felt so much clearer than it did before. He could finally live. His judge, jury, and executioner would never pursue him again. But there was work to do, and so Schmidt turned around and began walking. He knew what he had to do."

speerescalation.4.desc:0 "Germany's forefathers, the norse Aryans of the North, believed that one day Götterdämmerung, or Ragnarök, would envelop the world. The first sign of this end of days would be when a great Wolf, Garmr, broke free from his chains and was set loose. Following this, countryman would turn on countryman. Brother on brother. Earth would be torn asunder.\n\nHe had left it too late. He had not put Garmr back in chains. No, he had been a fool. An idiot, all things considered. That devil in the east, Schörner, was a rabid dog in every sense of the word. Foul, vicious and savage. Speer knew that when an animal goes feral, there is only one humane choice, for it and for all around it: putting the dog down. Yet he hadn't. Out of some fear, or stupid sympathy, or pure idiocy, Speer had led the dog roam free. Now, he had to endure the reports as they came in, live through that newfangled television of his.\n\nMurder. Massacre. Wholesale slaughter of slaves in the East. Was this Speer in the mirror? Was Schörner just a reflection of the great architect? When he looked at the white marble of Germania, would Speer see anything in his own artistry but the bloodied tapestry of sinews that the Generalfeldmarschall had constructed across the Reichskommissariats? And it was a tapestry. Slavic bodies flung carelessly around. Mass graves dug. Who knows how many thousands more will be killed in the coming weeks? Schörner had what he wanted. The dog was putting his master down.\n\nHe had lost. Now, he would be a Führer only in name. With the students nearing rebellion, the slaves openly revolting, and Speer's underlings turning against him, he felt his dreams disappear. He stood up from his desk, and stood in front of one of the many bookshelves of the Kanzler's office. The Poetic Edda stood out to him. He smiled, with a hint of melancholy. How fitting. He turned to stanza forty-five, and read aloud, alone in the room.\n\n"Brothers shall fight and fell each other,\nand sister's sons shall kinship stain.\nHard is it on earth, with mighty whoredom.\nAxe-time, sword-time, shields are sundered,\nWind-time, wolf-time, 'ere the world falls.""

In Germany, most men retire during this twilight decade, putting down the hammers and quills and moving into a life of family and comfort. The free men do, anyway.\n\nKurt's father had been a free man. For him, sixty was only the two-thirds checkpoint in his life, and he lived a happy final third with the wealth of a bank clerk. A shining example of the protestant work ethic, and a reaper of its rewards. He'd only died recently, Kurt remembered. Was it just last year? Time seemed a blur nowadays.\n\nKurt wasn't a man built for retirement. If time was a blur, his duty was not. With the Führer occupied in Moskowien, the student protests continued to cripple the heart of the Reich, and the old Silver Tongue was not about to let the opportunity for a reformed Germany descend into chaos and violence so quickly. Fingers drum on the table as the Deputy Führer stares coldly into middle distance, listening.

Where the griffin flies and the seas are sweet with trade. Next Thursday, be at the pier. Let us keep this brief."\n\nAnd like that, Kiesinger hung up the phone. His suitcase for an overnight stay had already been prepared in his room. A plane for Rostock had been organised, and if the Führer couldn't quell the Devil, then his Deputy would have to make a pact himself."

speerescalation.9.desc:0 "To Erhard, it appeared as if the house of cards was finally collapsing. Was Speer more tolerable than the Nazi scum before him? Of course. Was his demise in any way an upset to the Minister for the Economy? Not in the slightest. As the Führer's crisis continued to worsen, the man behind the facade of kindness and polite diplomacy had shrunk away, and the demon that Erhard had always seen behind those glassy eyes and forced smiles had reared its ugly head. Unfortunately for Ludwig, the time was not yet right for him and his allies to wrestle a true liberal democracy out of the ruins of the Reich.\n\nIn this sense, the student protests had seemed a tragedy to him. Slavery, tyranny, state control; all valid causes to rally against, and ideals he sympathised with. This particular outburst at the obvious violence of the regime Erhard was forced to collaborate with and the slave uprisings shook the economic minister to his core. Behind his crassness, he had a heart. In front of his crassness, Erhard cringed at the economic stupidity of this Nazi institution and the untold prosperity it had denied Germany.\n\nFor now, Erhard did need to calm the students. Their violent responses, although understandable, were ultimately a hindrance to the obtaining of genuine reform in the Reich. His political invulnerability would be his weapon.\n\nCalls were made, and meetings arranged. Erhard had sent his sympathies out through the protests, spreading rumours that he, and others within the government, were allied with them in the struggle for reform. By dispelling this information secretly, Erhard was gambling on the news not being traced back to him, and that if it was, his importance to the Reich might guarantee immunity from punishment. In time, however, this regime and all it stood for would be erased."

speerescalation.11.t:0 "A New Deal"
speerescalation.11.desc:0 "Germania was called the Welthauptstadt for a reason. If Tokyo, sprawling metropolis of the isles to the East, was the capital of an Empire, then Germania in its size and magnificence was the capital of the world. The massive projects and renovations of old Berlin, and especially the expansion into a surrounding urban sprawl, gave the city plenty of hiding spots, however. The larger a house is, the harder it is to clean, and the dirty corners of the Reich's basement saw little light throughout the decades.\n\nHelmut entered an alley in a local downtown area of Germania's surrounding suburbs. He was dressed quite carefully in a black leather coat over a dark brown jumper. A fedora adorned his head and he wore dark eye glasses, not tinted enough to suggest sunglasses at midnight but not light enough to see his eyes. The outfit was a precautionary measure against the foreign minister being identified in the outer suburbs of his home city.\n\nTwo other men and a woman were already in the alley. They were young, and even in the cover of night, their clothes told their age. Effortful. Jazzy. American. Even as a liberal, Helmut grimaced at the sight.\n\n"Finally. What have you got for us, old man," the woman began.\n\n"Naught but a promise, I'm afraid," Helmut responded. "I cannot get you what you want now, but I can guarantee it comes in due time."\n\n"What kind of a deal is that?" The men tensed, an effort to threaten the aging statesman.\n\n"A deal you'll have to take, my dear, if you want anything done in this wretched country." Schmidt revealed a note from his pocket. "This is the address of a cache of weapons I redirected from some friends in the Heer. They're not for use in some violent rebellion; I want you to know I am on your side and will defend you from this police state I have found myself in. There's more where they come from, when the time comes, but for now I need you to lower tensions and engage in talks with the state. It is the only choice."\n\nThe woman grimaced, but nodded. "Thank you, Herr Schmidt.""

speerescalation.13.t:0 "Wisdom"
speerescalation.13.desc:0 "Hegel, as a young man, described Napoleon entering the city of Jena as the 'world's soul on horseback'. The man was a hero, despite his crimes, and burned with the energy and charisma that galvanised his country behind him. It seemed to Hegel as if history itself had volunteered for his army. If the philosopher had been a young man today, a student on the sidelines of Frankfurt's protests, perhaps he would have had some similar esteem for the world soul arriving in an armored car instead.\n\nVon Tresckow arrived in the city with the Orpo. He wore his military uniform that day, iron cross and all, with a furred coat over the top. An imperial elegance held to the Old Prussian. He had not come to fight, he had come to talk.\n\nOver the past few years, von Tresckow had used his time to reform the police. Primarily, this involved reallocating resources away from weaponry, reducing their numbers, revising tactics and educational programs. Perceptions of Germany's Prussian tradition often confuse traditionalism and patriotism with militarism and dogmatism. Von Tresckow knew that the military and nation were central to a German identity, but they were a restrained force of honour and valor meant to protect freedom, not crush it.\n\nHe was to be an ambassador. Schmidt might have dealt well in foreign embassies, but von Tresckow had always felt a bond with all common people. These protestors were no different.\n\nAs the Orpo began to form a wall around the students, they screamed in the officers face. This was an expected activity, and the police stood firm, but calm, as they had been trained to do. When von Tresckow was spotted amongst their ranks, the face of Germany's security ministry became the target of even more verbal abuse. He understood their anger, and despite the protests of some of his own men, he stepped beyond the police barrier into the crowd.\n\n"Germans, gather round. I come not to make war, I come not to preach the Nazi ideal. I came to make peace, I came to listen to the people. So, brothers and sisters, speak."\n\nAnd so they did, until the final of the sun's rays died on the horizon."

speer_iberianwars.1.desc:0 "The helicopter touched down in Valladolid with little incident. Corporal Frederick's platoon were quickly ushered into their temporary barracks. The building had once been a four-star hotel, though Frederick's excitement fell considerably upon being told to expect the same slop from the same cook as he had back in Bonn. Still, they would be treated to a welcome feast upon their arrival, where they would meet their local allies.\n\nThe officers chattered away to each other, the Spanish generals and colonels speaking quite passable German. The enlisted men were another matter. The two contingents had made some attempts to speak with each other, but most on either side knew little more than phrasebook vocabulary of the other's language. Even Frederick, who had learned more than most from his Condor Legion veteran father, struggled to make any headway. Eventually, both sides gave up and retreated to separate tables, continuing to stare at each other.\n\nThey were hard men, Frederick thought. Much more dishevelled than his own men were, with permanent scowels and dark rings under their eyes. They reminded him of the Göringite partisans Frederick had fought during the last stages of the civil war. It wasn't a pleasant look. What was Falangism anyway? The way it had been presented to the men was as an overthrow of the corrupt Iberian federal government, as the decadent Spanish Republic had been overthrown before it. He hoped their eventual victory would result in reform, such as had been the case with Speer, but he felt anything but certain.\n\nThe first dish finally arrived, and the Spaniards immediately stopped to say grace, the Germans eventually imitating them with little enthusiasm."

I'm doing fine, none of us have seen much action yet. I think the sun will likely kill me before the Basques do (don't worry, I'm only joking).\n\nSpain is a very different place to Germany. The food is much better, though I have to admit my most recent exposure to German food is all army rations. They take religion very seriously here, and they spend a lot of time praying. Some of the Spanish guys asked us why we don't pray more the other day, and from my bad Spanish, I get the feeling they don't like atheists or Protestants much. So basically Spain is sunny Bavaria, I suppose.\n\nI know you're worried about us, but we're fighting for the right thing. Falangism is a little strange, and I'm not sure I really understand it, but this is a great opportunity for Germany to look outwards once more. Despite our differences, I'm sure Germany and Spain can walk hand in hand as firm allies once this is all over."

After twelve hours of solid broadcasting, he felt as if he was about to melt into the switchboards. Another hour, and his Spanish would probably melt into an incomprehensible mix with German. But finally, sleep would be forthcoming. Then the same thing all over again tomorrow. He got up and started to move out the door, as he spotted Erich, the nighttime host, entering the door. They nodded at each other.\n\n"Music's on for another 20 minutes," said Otto. "We're still mostly going after the feds, but high command also wants us to run the speeches against the Basques and Galicians now and again."\n\n"Will do," replied Erich. "You alright, man?

speer_iberianwars.4.desc:0 "Looking down at Spain, it seemed as though the whole world was burning. Horst's Junkers glided through the sky above what remained of a Spanish city whose name he'd forgotten, watching the rows and rows of cookie-cutter housing smoldering or flashing with the unmistakable sparks of gunfire. From the looks of things, a republican holdout had formed around an intersection between a school's field, and an apartment block, with gunfire uselessly spraying from a crossfire into a German tank, advancing through the street practically unharmed. By the time it had gotten into firing range, Horst's scope had moved far beyond the point where the rest of the battle could be observed, as his transport came into view of the city ahead of him.\n\nIt looked like something out of a novel, or a comic he would find his radical friend's friends reading. The city was smoking like a chimney, with pillars of ash flowing out of whole office buildings, with the tallest buildings hanging banners which Horst could not read, but wholeheartedly understood. If nothing else, they were certainly cries for help. Of course, with the dropzone coming close into view, Horst's attention was driven away from the state of the city, and towards the clearing made in a public park. The trees had been cut down and tossed aside, flares lit up the dulling green of the grass, and a collection of soldiers stood aside as Horst's plane flew overhead. Pushing one of the countless buttons on his dashboard illuminating a light in the cargo bay, the cargo flew from the back of the transport, and Horst resumed his sightseeing tour, as he readjusted his destination to the military outpost established by German forces.\n\nIt was odd, seeing a city in such devastation. It reminded him of the images of Austria during the Civil War when Bormann pulled every trick he had in his book. Not that it was worth thinking over, of course. He could think over the poetry behind the fires when he wasn't spreading them himself."

speer_iberianwars.5.desc:0 ""Simply unacceptable." The attaché shook his head as he glanced down at the photographs in his hands. "The German People have no need for pictures of disheveled men with scorched helmets. You may send this one back, however." He slid one of Felix's photos back to him. It was one of his worse ones, a staged photo of a unit of infantry, posing with their guns atop of an Iberian tank, as if they had been its conquerors. In reality, they had simply found it like that, presumably abandoned after whatever renegade military unit that operated it had run out of fuel.\n\nEither way, this, out of dozens of photos of the battlefield, was to be his sole contribution for the evening. He had been expecting this, but Felix had hoped that maybe somehow the scrutinizing eye of the censors would pass over his images of the bullet-riddled Church his unit had repelled a leftist assault in, or a one-in-a-million shot of Federal Mortars landing a mere dozen yards away from his position. He seemed to be incapable of doing anything except setting himself up for disappointment.\n\nThere was no time to waste though. Muttering his apologies and gratitude to the attaché, Felix backed out of the tent, glancing down at his camera. He had a quota to fill, and not much time left for it. He made his way across the austere military camp to the squad he had been assigned to. Maybe, if he could get them mustered for a moment, he could take some basic pose-\n\nThe familiar wail of sirens filled the base. An air raid was inbound.\n\nThe first few times Felix had heard it, he clutched his ears. By now, he merely winced, whispering curses underneath his breath as he took a trained, practically involuntary step back. And then he turned towards the bunker. God knew how long he'd be hiding down there, and how long it'd take for the base to be put back together well enough for the censors to accept..."

 POLITICS_WILLY_BRANDT_DESC:0 "Willy Brandt fights for a Europe many believe will never exist. Born as Herbert Frahm in 1913, he strove with determination during the Weimar years to maintain the democratic republic against the threats of the Nazis and Communists alike. As Frahm, he joined the SPD aged 16, the SAPD aged 18, and the anti-Nazi resistance just aged 20. The death of Frahm and the birth of Willy Brandt came when he fled to Oslo to establish an SAPD cell as a bastion of German resistance.\n\nAs Norway and later the Soviet Union collapsed, Brandt and his fellow resistance members attempted to flee to the US to continue the struggle against tyranny. The cruelty of fate saw them all captured by the Kriegsmarine and thrown in an eastern European KZ, where they toiled with little but gruel and the threat of a bullet to sustain them.\n\nRefusing to be crushed by such brutality, Brandt covertly organized camp resistance cells and established outside contacts who were not surprised when Brandt and his allies escaped during the chaos of the West Russian War. Free at last and as fervent as ever, Brandt coalesced much of the German resistance around the re-established Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, working undercover as he grew his network to include European partisan organizations and German student leaders, exploiting the mayhem of the Bürgerkrieg to his advantage.\n\nMany would have given up such a fanciful dream in search of a peaceful life. Not Willy Brandt. The Slave Revolt provides the final flame of hope for the forces of liberation and democracy, whatever the cost may be. The final die has been tossed, and only time will tell if it heralds freedom or death."

These groups, long entrenched within eastern Europe, are scarcely used to fighting in the light of the sun, or doing battle against an organized enemy fighting force. Even less so are these partisans acclimatised to working alongside movements to which they were formerly opposed. Yet despite all, these men and women understand that they have now gone all-in, and have nothing left to gain from petty squabbles and partisan rivalry. Their revolution has arrived, and with it has come the time to fight."
