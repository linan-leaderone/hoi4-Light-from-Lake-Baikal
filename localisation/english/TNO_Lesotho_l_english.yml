 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_MOSHOESHOE_II_DESC: "King of the Kingdom of Lesotho, Moshoeshoe II was born Constantine Bereng Seeiso, a descendant of Moshoeshoe I, the great founder of the nation. Educated at Roma College in Lesotho, from a young age he cooperated closely with the South African government, just as his stepmother, acting as his regent in the wake of his father's death, had before him. Granted full independence upon assuming the throne in 1960, he has so far competently led Lesotho in cooperation with the constitutional government."

 LTH_south_african_kingdom: "South African Kingdom"
 LTH_south_african_kingdom_desc: "Lesotho has had a tumultuous history over the last few years. The Kingdom was at first anything but, independent in name only under South Africa, and reduced to another exploited province with the rise of the Afrikaaner Volkstaat. However, with the Volkstaat's collapse, Lesotho has reasserted itself as a proper nation and hopes to build a proper nation from the corpse of South Africa."

 LTH_strong_anc_influence: "Strong ANC Influence"
 LTH_strong_anc_influence_desc: "After the South African War, the ANC was destroyed and split into factions. Many of the most influential and radical members fled to Lesotho, where they were granted refuge by Moshoeshoe II. While they may be grateful to the king for his protection while under the Volkstaat, the radicals are now a thorn in the side of the king."
