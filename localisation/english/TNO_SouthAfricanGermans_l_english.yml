 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_KARL_CHMIELEWSKI_DESC: "Karl Chmielewski was always considered to be below average in all aspects except one: cruelty.\n\nChmielewski once had a promising career in the German SS, as one of the few Camp Kommandants whose delight in torturing prisoners unsettled even Reinhard Heydrich. However, his excessive graft and violations of SS regulations ended his career with a permanent reassignment to Hüttig's Ostafrika. Here, he was no one.\n\nFor years, the disgraced Camp Kommandant tried to gain the Reichskommissar's approval, to no avail. Even his plot to assassinate Ian Smith backfired when it interfered with his boss's plans. A lackluster performance as a corps commander during the South African War seemed like his last posting, until Malan's rebellion forced Hüttig to intervene in the country once more.\n\nSince Hüttig's more competent generals were busy administering his domain, Chmielewski was the only one left to put down the Boer rebellion. With little more than a full division and hatred for the Germans at an all time high, Chmielewski knows that regaining control of the country is impossible, but he will at least try to evacuate as many German resources as possible before he is beaten back."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_DOMMES_DESC: "Wilhelm Dommes never wanted to be in Afrika, and even now thinks only of how to escape it.\n\nAfter spending the Second World War as the only German commander to closely cooperate with the Japanese throughout the war, Dommes had expected a rapid promotion to the Seekriegsleitung. However, the rapid deterioration of German-Japanese relations after the war resulted in a speedy exile to Ostafrika, where his career languished for over a decade. Worse still, Dommes sat out the South African War, crawling in his skin as the American navy prevented his petty fleet from playing any active part.\n\nThroughout Hüttig's reign, it was speculated he avoided being purged because the Afrikan Kriegsmarine was thought too irrelevant to bother with. Few, however, knew just how true that statement was. While Africa burned, Dommes used the Statthalter's benign ignorance to plot his escape, but being constantly frustrated by want of fuel. When the Vasallenstaat was reconquered, however, Dommes changed his plans: Quietly using the last of his supplies to relocate what remained of his fleet to the abandoned OFN naval base at Simonstown, the Konteradmiral procured to secure control of the Cape in the inevitable event of the Reichsstaat's collapse, and hand it in a silver plate to his former allies in exchange for rescue.\n\nUsing his influence with Rolf Mutzenburg and Hans Ulrich Rudel, both of whom he saved from execution by Hüttig, Dommes painstakingly infiltrated Oberkommando Südafrika in preparation for making his move. When news of Hüttig's death reached Kapstadt, it took little effort to assassinate the hated Chmielewski and recall his troops to the Cape. Merging the late Kolonialverwalter's command with his own "Seeverteidigung Simonstown," he has assembled a collection of weaponry ranging from the barely operable battleship Rodney to the most modern armor available to the defunct Bouhlerstadt regime.\n\nNow that his plan is entering the final stretch, Dommes has only one objective: Survive until his negotiations with the Japanese guarantee him and his men a safe escape route. To this objective, he has established a temporary alliance with the Johannesburg "Republic" and OFN prisoners to the north, which few expect to last, even if it survives the impending ANC attack."

 ### Ideas ###
 SFG_huttig_division: "Hüttig's Divisions"
 SFG_huttig_division_desc: "Oberkommando Südafrika comprises some of the most battle-hardened and ruthless soldiers in the entire Second South African Civil War. Having participated in the South African War and countless guerilla-crushing operations afterward, they are no strangers to the combat or terrain that defines this war. Now, with new orders, the veterans of Oberkommando Südafrika are ready to destroy the resistance in South Africa, one last time."

 SFG_restoring_order_in_sudafrika: "Restoring Order in Südafrika"
 SFG_restoring_order_in_sudafrika_desc: "Oberkommando Südafrika has been given a simple goal ordered straight from Hüttig himself; bring South Africa to heel, by whatever means necessary, forever. There are no morals or ethics holding back the troops of Oberkommando Südafrika, and neither do they present any preface of having one. They are here to destroy, conquer, and subdue, nothing more."
