 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_LAZAR_KAGANOVICH_DESC: "Many thought that, when Bukharin's Soviet Union collapsed, it would be almost impossible for one of his arch enemies to gain so much power as to become one of the most powerful leaders in Russia. However, Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich would prove them wrong. An ardent supporter of Joseph Stalin, he opposed Bukharin's policies and was sent to West Siberia, in what would normally be an irrelevant position. When he found himself far from the frontlines of the war, though, he would accumulate power, enough to form one of the largest nations in Russia before the West Russian War.\n\nWith the loyalty of Field Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky and Lieutenant-General Dmitry Karbyshev, as well as the support of the 3rd and 10th Armies, Lazar Kaganovich would declare the formation of the Western Siberian People's Republic, which would stretch from the Urals to the city of Omsk. Unfortunately for him, the Republic was not meant to last long. A combination of the intense Luftwaffe bombings and his two former allies distancing themselves from him would eventually lead to its collapse. In the place of the short-lived nation born from the ashes of the USSR, Rokossovsky's army would gather in the west, and Karbyshev's Black League would gather in the east, and Kaganovich had no choice but to retreat to the city of Tyumen and exercise his control over the remnants of Western Siberia.\n\nNow, Kaganovich has to lead a rump state, a relic of the times of Russia in the Interbellum, through these turbulent times. He may be surrounded by enemies from both within and without his fiefdom, but his revolutionary will remains unbreakable. A hardline Old Bolshevik, Kaganovich will not stray from any means to eliminate the enemies of the state and embody the all-embracing proletarian state as the Great Teacher Lenin and his greatest disciple, Comrade Stalin, envisioned it since the glorious days of the Red October."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHCHERBINA_DESC: "It is no wonder Boris Yevdokimovich Shcherbina was selected as the administrator of Tyumen when one looks at his record. After arriving in West Siberia as a young yet ambitious party official, he soon found himself stranded as the government in Moscow fell. He was shielded from the chaos by Lazar Kaganovich, who saw his skills, and by the time of the Zlatoust invasion had long made him his chief economic advisor.\n\nHowever, his lack of loyalty to the authoritarian system Kaganovich admired so much was made clear as soon as the well-armed forces of Dragunov marched eastwards. Abandoning his former beliefs and lusting for power, Shcherbina came to a secret agreement with the merchants of death. The Ural Republic could use like him in governing the lawless lands, and for that he would be appointed governor of Tyumen. His talent soon became clear as day, and now Shcherbina wishes to make his territory a model province, even under the watchful eye of Zlatoust."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHCHERBINA_ONEGA_DESC: "It is no wonder Boris Yevdokimovich Shcherbina was selected as the administrator of Tyumen when one looks at his record. After arriving in West Siberia as a young yet ambitious party official, he soon found himself stranded as the government in Moscow fell. He was shielded from the chaos by Lazar Kaganovich, who saw his skills, and by the time of the Onega invasion had long made him his chief economic advisor.\n\nHowever, his lack of loyalty to the authoritarian system Kaganovich admired so much was made clear as soon as the well-armed forces of Kirpichnikov marched eastwards. Abandoning his former beliefs and lusting for power, Shcherbina came to a secret agreement with the anti-communists. The North Russian Republic could use like him in governing the lawless lands, and for that he would be appointed governor of Tyumen. His talent soon became clear as day, and now Shcherbina wishes to make his territory a model province, even under the watchful eye of Onega."

 POLITICS_NIKITA_KHRUSHCHEV_DESC: "Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev is a man that represents both what was, and what never came to be. Born in 1894 in abject poverty, his family struggled heavily to give him what bare higher education the Russian peasantry could afford, and perhaps it was this sheer determination of his parents and his own siblings to give him a better life that gave the man a sense of patience, muted intelligence and cautiousness that was lacking severely within many of the more idealistic members of the Communist Party under Bukharin, a detail that brought the attention of Lazar Kaganovich, a man that would become his mentor, and were once his friend.\n\nUnder Lazar Kaganovich's wing, and the late Stalin's tutelage, the humble serf grew into a diligent, yet wary statesman, a quiet critic of the system that Bukharin put into place, doubly so as the purges rolled and the many people he knew as friends ended up dead and missing, up and including Joseph Stalin himself, his death as an "industrial accident" being something that neither he nor Kaganovich ever believed.\n\nWhen the USSR fell, however, a rift between the heirs of Stalinism, subtle at first, yet ever-widening, rose with time: Kaganovich gave himself more to his ideal vision of Stalinism, of what a perfect, state-driven Communism would be, a state of strength that wouldn't fall like Bukharin's failed experiment did, yet all Nikita looked was the starving children and women, and the empty grave of his own son.\n\nThe differences between both men became irreconcilable, and Nikita regretfully struck first against the man that was once his mentor and friend. Now he stands alone not as a diligent second man, or a disciple, but as the Chairman of a new Soviet Russia. He never quite desired the spotlights so heavily upon him, so close to his own retirement, but much like his own family sacrificed so much for him to be in this very same spot, so will he sacrifice to give Russia the future it deserves.\n\nHe owes Stalin and Leonid that much."

 TYM_revisionist_remnant_desc: "We may be reduced to the status of a petty remnant state in West Siberia, but we will not let this be the last gasp of the Cause of Lenin. To this end, we may be forced to deviate from Leninist Orthodoxy, but General Secretary Kaganovich has just what is takes; his new doctrine will take us from this ruined state to the successful conclusion of the Revolution."
 TYM_closed_union: "A Closed Union"
 TYM_closed_union_desc: "The fatal flaw of Bukharin is that he forfeited too much control over the State, allowing divisions and counter-revolutionary thought to creep, weakening our Great Union and leading to its collapse. Well, no longer. Drawing inspiration from our General Secretary's old friend, Iosif Stalin, we will bring everything in our territory under control; nothing will be past our watch, and all resources will be directed towards the future Liberation."
 TYM_open_union: "An Open Union"

Indeed, part of their amazing strength comes from the equipment we arm them with, produced by the proud workers of the states. This includes motorized and armored vehicles that can transport our troops to the frontlines safely and punch a hole in the enemy lines. A new campaign of production will be undergone to ensure this and bolster our proud troops."

 TYM_siberian_roadways_desc: "In the wake of the German bombings, we have been left with much of the infrastructure damaged, including several roads and rail lines. Such facilities are necessary for the moving of troops and supplies, and we can not afford to leave these unattended in the wake of coming wars. Due to this, the party has ingeniously called for a road-building and repair campaign over the next year to remedy this. Our roads will be the envy of all of West Siberia!"

 TYM_holding_out_desc: "The territories of the former Soviet Union have never seen darker days than the ones they currently experience. Petty warlords wage war amongst themselves, and all the while the hated Fascists who started this misery send their dreaded Luftwaffe to rain death and destruction right on top of our heads.\n\nIndeed, the cruel fascists of the Reich are simply not content with our previous defeats, and would prefer to go a step further by kicking the Russian people while they are down. This state of affairs cannot continue! Chairman Kaganovich hears the plight of those who suffer, and with his aid new strategies will be undertaken to mitigate the worst of the damage."
 TYM_bunker_building_desc: "For everyday that the bombs fall, the people of our republic have nowhere to hide and are forced to flee for their lives with a fear so palpable it haunts their dreams. The death tolls are rising by the day, and something must be done to give the people a place to seek shelter when the Luftwaffe arrives once more to reap their bloody harvest.\n\nThe answer? More bunkers! Every city, every town shall soon have a formidable system of bunkers that will serve as unbreakable bomb shelters in times of peace, and an effective form of defense in times of war. Our republic shall become a great fortress, completely unable to be breached by air or by land!"
 TYM_military_holdouts_desc: "Now that plenty of bomb shelters have been made available for our people, they can now sit in relative comfort and safety as the Luftwaffe attempts in vain to break their body and spirit, but what of the military? How can they hope to keep watch against our many enemies with explosives being rained down on their heads on a regular basis?\n\nSimple: we shall build even more fortifications! This time, the locations of our fortified positions shall be chosen with the military in mind. The most likely lines of defense shall be turned into impenetrable redoubts that are mostly safe from any kind of aerial attack, as well as being well-prepared for potential ground assaults."
 TYM_scavengers_paradise_desc: "Comrades, let us face the facts: the West Siberian People's Republic has seen better days. Most of its infrastructure lies in ruin, and countless scores of both civilian and military equipment have been lost to the chaos of the collapse. Now that we are making a serious attempt to get back on our feet, we desperately need that equipment back.\n\nAlthough we currently lack the industry to produce goods ourselves, there are millions of valuable artifacts from better days that are simply lying out in the open, waiting to be claimed. The green light has been given to execute a large-scale expedition into no-man's-land with the goal of rescuing as much lost materiel as we can. With luck, our scavengers will come home with plenty of abandoned equipment just waiting to be put back to good use." 
 TYM_hidden_communes_desc: "Bomb shelters have proven to be an effective layer of protection for our people, but their very nature means that those who still go about their business on the surface will have to maintain a keenly-developed sense of danger in order to make it to the shelters in time. To make matters worse, there is no telling what would happen should the Luftwaffe decide to harass us at night.\n\nPerhaps it would be wise to expand these shelters to serve another purpose: underground bomb-proof homes for the people! If the people are living and working safely underground, then they would not even have to concern themselves with the arrival of the bombing raids. Better yet, they'd finally be able to sleep at night knowing they wouldn't be awoken by a siren!"
 TYM_behind_the_times_desc: "Modern technology is all well and good, but what use is it if our factories are too damaged to produce them? The fact is, all of the luxuries of the modern world will have to wait until the People's Republic isn't getting pelted with bombs nearly every day and we can actually get our industry back up and running again.\n\nThe solution lies in providing the people with older, more antiquated goods. Although they are less convenient to use, they are much easier to produce, especially in stressful times like ours. After all, when it rains death on a regular basis, our people would hardly be picky with what goods and services they have access to. In fact, they should consider themselves lucky they're getting anything at all!"
 TYM_survival_society_desc: "In these times, our focus should be less on comfort and more on survival. Our government's decisions could be the deciding factor between life or death for hundreds of thousands, and sadly there comes a time when difficult choices will have to be made.\n\nThis is one of those times. The bombings impact our noble republic on every level, from the innocent people who are helpless against the might of the Luftwaffe, to our military which suffers insurmountable casualties every week from the sheer volume of aerial strikes. It is becoming increasingly clear that we cannot save everyone, and a choice is presenting itself. Should we focus our efforts on protecting the innocent, or preserving our military strength?"
 TYM_the_underground_world_desc: "The surface has been a land of death and misery for many years now, and our people are finding it much safer to seek brighter opportunities underground. Who are we to stop them? As a matter of fact, there is great wisdom in this trend, and we would do well to embrace it with open arms.\n\nThe Chairman himself has given the go-ahead to begin the construction of vast underground complexes which will serve a large variety of roles, from industry to dwellings. Ideas have even been proposed for entire military bases to be built underground! Such is the canny ingenuity of a truly socialist society, to find hope in the most unlikely of places while in the darkest of times!"
 TYM_rapid_caravaning_desc: "Yet another necessity caused by the bombing raids are the system of caravans that have formed the lifeline in the devastated regions of Russia. Unfortunately, the fascists have already caught on to the most common routes used by the caravans and have begun launching strikes with the specific goal of cutting off our supplies in transit.\n\nIn the interest of avoiding such disasters in the future, we shall begin to devise new routes for our caravans intended to expose them to as little risk of being intercepted by the many dangers of the Russian no-man's-land as possible. Although these unfamiliar new routes will take some getting used to for our caravaneers, the continued influx of supplies would surely be worth any potential inconvenience that may arise."
 TYM_living_in_the_shadow_desc: "The bombings are only getting worse as time goes on, and our already weak industry is being stretched to its absolute limits. As a result, production is more sluggish than we'd like, and the slow pace has come at the cost of less supplies and equipment reaching the frontlines. To ensure that our military stands ready to face any kind of foe even under these circumstances, perhaps it may be necessary to make even more sacrifices.\n\nA considerable portion of our production capabilities are devoted towards producing goods for the civilians. Theoretically, diverting production of civilian goods would provide a substantial boost to the production of arms and equipment for our troops, but is it really worth taking away what little luxuries our people still have access to? The final decision will rest with Chairman Kaganovich..."
 TYM_study_the_bombings_desc: "The Luftwaffe darken the skies with their sinister presence, unleashing death upon the innocent people of our republic on a near-daily basis. Perhaps, though, the frequency of the bombings could yet prove to be the fascists' undoing? Some our more astute comrades in the remnants of our air forces have noticed that certain patterns are beginning to emerge in the bombings, but they cannot know for sure unless an effort is taken to study them in detail.\n\nTo that end, we shall begin taking notes of the fascist bombings from here on out. The timetable of the attacks will be carefully analyzed to see if obvious patterns in the raids truly do exist. With any luck, our comrades will be able to predict exactly where and when the bombs will fall, and true efforts to mitigate the majority of their damage can begin in earnest."
 TYM_on_the_clock_desc: "Our efforts to study the fascist bombing raids have borne fruit! Thanks to our intensive analysis of the times, dates, and locations of the bombings, a highly conspicuous pattern did, in fact, emerge. The Luftwaffe's power in the air may be fearsome indeed, but it is clear to us now that these fascists are nothing if not predictable.\n\nNow that we can accurately and reliably predict where the bombing raids will happen, the next step will be to prepare potential targets for the raids in advance. Although we cannot stop the bombs from dropping for now, we can, at the very least, ensure that they land in areas where virtually no critical damage can be inflicted. There is indeed a light at the end of the tunnel!"
 TYM_the_mikhail_system_desc: "Comrade Mikhail, brother to the Chairman, has come forward with a wise proposal for further minimizing the impact of the bombings. He believes that it would be necessary to devote a significant portion of our efforts to mitigate the damage towards ensuring the safety of all personnel considered essential to our cause.\n\nIndeed, losing these highly important men and women in a near-instant to one of the raids would spell disaster for the republic, and it is when this fact is considered that Mikhail's idea begins to carry weight. Under his proposed system, we can both substantially increase the protection afforded to our essential personnel while, at the same time, not being forced to abandon our people to their fate."
 TYM_off_the_clock_desc: "The systems put in place to prevent any significant damage from the bombings took some time to bear results, but it appears that they are finally working their magic. The ordnance rained upon us from the Luftwaffe now detonates in unimportant locations while our more critical infrastructure has survived raid after raid.\n\nMeanwhile, deaths caused by the bombings have witnessed a noticeable decrease over the last few months. Once again our people feel safe going about their business on the surface so long as the proper precautions are followed, and for the most part we no longer have to fear the coming of the Luftwaffe. Now that we have room to breathe, perhaps the time has come to start figuring out ways to clip the fascists' wings..."
 TYM_preventative_measures_desc: "For too long have we cowered at the mercy of the Germans and their Luftwaffe! No longer are we forced to scurry to our bomb shelters like rats while the fascists terrorize and destroy our lands as they please, with our weakened military completely and utterly powerless to stop them. Now their bombs have been rendered worse than useless, and we have gained the opportunity to take action and inflict some terror of our own.\n\nWith the aid of the advanced anti-aircraft weapon systems we have acquired from various sources over the years, we can finally put them to use by establishing various weapon sites near locations where the German bombers are known to frequent. Once our weapons are in place, the cocky bomber pilots of the Luftwaffe will be in for a nasty surprise when their seemingly helpless targets start firing back!"
 TYM_necessary_losses_desc: "Despite all our efforts to prevent the worst of the bombings from affecting our people, it sadly remains true that we cannot ever hope to spare every last person from their effects. Chairman Kaganovich understands this cruel fact better than anyone, and knows that if he tries to prioritize both the urban and rural populations neither will see any noticeable improvement over their current conditions.\n\nTherefore, he has decided to prioritize the protection of the urban populations of the republic. Being more tightly packed population centers, the cities are obviously more vulnerable to the bombs than the spread-out farmlands. While the cities will benefit from new bunkers to fall back on in case of emergencies, those who live in the rural communities will just have to make do with what they have."
 TYM_do_and_die_convoys_desc: "As a consequence of increasing our anti-air efforts in the republic, refugees have flocked to our borders like never before. While we welcome the influx of newcomers to our depleted lands, this newly-emerging rush to get to the safety our republic now provides has not gone unnoticed by our German nemesis...\n\nWe can attempt to help the refugees, but to try and save all of them would invite disaster where it could have easily been avoided. The needs of the many outweigh the few, and sadly it may be necessary to sacrifice the smaller refugee convoys in favor of larger concentrations. While many innocents will doubtlessly meet a cruel death as a result of this, many more lives would be saved than if we tried to stretch ourselves thin trying to protect every last soul that walks into our borders."
 TYM_black_zones_desc: "Our production capabilities are still much slower than they could be, and while the bombings are much less damaging than the were a few months ago, it would still be far too risky to attempt repairing the bombed out factories that were abandoned long ago. The lightening of the bombings does, however, provide us with new opportunities.\n\nChairman Kaganovich has authorized a brilliant new approach to getting our armaments production back in working order. Weapons factories and arsenals are to begin construction in spread-out, highly confidential locations to help bolster our ailing industry. These locations are to be highly secretive and will be selected based on their likelihood of being discovered by the Luftwaffe. With the Germans beginning to show reluctance to fly brazenly over our skies like they once did, there do exist certain unassuming areas under our control that have not seen much attention from the raids."
 TYM_unpopular_decisions_desc: "Despite our best efforts to protect the people of the WSPR's remnants, the endless bickering of the communes and their officials have never ceased. In fact, their dissent has only increased over the months! Certain powerful officials claim that we are abandoning the communes and the people of the republic in favor of more useful sectors of the nation and causing the misery of thousands.\n\nWhile these accusations are not entirely unfounded, this is just not the time to be arguing morality. Even if we were so foolish as to abandon highly important aspects of our nation's infrastructure and industry in favor of making sure a few people can plow their fields, they would doubtless manage to find things to complain about. We shall continue our policy of pragmatism that has shown so much success in the past, and ensure that these useless complaints fall on deaf ears."
 TYM_for_our_survival_desc: "For our survival, our republic has had to make many uncomfortable sacrifices in the name of ensuring the safety of the revolution and the prosperity of the nation. Many have given their blood and even their lives in the process, and the difficult choices that were made will forever enshrine the last few months as the one of the darkest periods in the nation's history. We aren't exactly proud of the cruel decisions that resulted in the loss of lives, but none can say that it wasn't worth it in the end.\n\nThe bombings have ceased for the most part, and the skies have been more clear than they've been in decades. People are once again coming out of their shelters and living lives that they hadn't been able to for so long.\n\nWith our safety from the German scourge secured, the time has come to honor those who gave their lives to ensure that this reality could become possible in the first place. May we never forget their sacrifice."

 TYM_the_clock_breaks_desc: "An uncharacteristic silence has overtaken the lands of the former People's Republic. Distant thumps and booms are no longer commonplace, the air raid sirens have not screamed their eerie warning calls for weeks, and nary a plane has been spotted in the sky for some time. The terror bombing campaign that has terrorized Russia for so long has finally come to an end.\n\nNow that the bombs have stopped, we must make up for lost time. There are many problems that will need to be addressed, the most pressing of which being the rebuilding of the nation. After all, the revolution cannot even hope to continue until we are well and truly back on our feet!"
 TYM_rebuilding_a_nation_desc: "Our long period under siege has severely damaged our economic and political institutions. We were brought to the brink of extinction, but, now that we are safe at last from the bombings, the time has come to begin putting the state back together.\n\nChairman Kaganovich has wisely put together a plan to repair our damaged factories, take the government out of the state of emergency, and reestablish our bureaucracy, reaching out to the people of Tyumen to bring them back into the fold after their struggle for survival. Soon, the Communist Party will have firmly pulled our state back from the brink, and the hard work of expansion can finally begin."
 TYM_rebuilding_the_factories_desc: "As we initiate the process of putting Tyumen back together, we must confront the fact that not everything can be done at once. Our limited resources require careful prioritization of the most necessary sectors of society, and sacrifices must be made eventually.\n\nTo rapidly restore the economy to its former state, we must establish a firm baseline, and prioritizing repairs to our shattered industry is the best way forward. The time for focusing on civilian infrastructure is after we have established a platform to work off of, and the best way to do that is to restore the state's industrial capacity and slowly bring vitality back to our economy."
 TYM_the_military_industrial_complex_desc: "Having been on defense against the Germans for so long, we have had precious little opportunity to focus on military development. As Marx taught us, it is vital for the workers to have arms, and nowhere is being defenseless more dangerous than in Russia, where slavering bandits surround us on all sides. While we are in less danger than when the bombings were ongoing, building up our military is vital.\n\nWith our factories resuming development, there is no better time to fully dedicate our resources to military development. A steady outflow of guns and bombs will ensure the workers' state its safety for a little while longer."
 TYM_armored_production_desc: "Military production continues to increase as more and more of our factories reopen. While this is good news, we cannot settle to merely match our enemies in production. We must surpass them, building newer and better weapons to utterly crush them in the battlefield. This is what Chairman Kaganovich has decreed.\n\nTyumen will accept only the finest weapons of war, and what finer example of modern military might than armored vehicles? Cheap, effective, and well-protected, Tyumen's new fleet of armor will be the vanguard we need to spread communism across Russia."
 TYM_civil_infrastructure_desc: "The effects of years of German bombings on the domestic infrastructure of the state is evident in all aspects of daily life. Major routes are impassable, detours are overloaded, and important features such as bridges and tunnels are almost all destroyed. This not only affects nearly every aspect of state operations, but also acts to isolate many communities, both major and minor, from the central government.\n\nAs such, Chairman Kaganovich will announce a program of intensive and targeted construction, focused both on replacing destroyed and also in establishing critical new sections of national infrastructure. All the people in the People's Republic must be connected to each other, for it is only through collective effort that we can, and will, prevail."
 TYM_swords_to_plowshares_desc: "A significant portion of Tyumen's military equipment is made up of surplus from the Great Patriotic War. After many years of bombing and turmoil, it is sadly obsolete and oftentimes only semi-functional due to lack of maintenance. The need to replace all of this weaponry makes our military buildup that much more difficult.\n\nJust because this gear is no longer fit for combat does not mean it is totally worthless. In a feat of ingenuity, the Communist Party has decided to repurpose old military equipment for agriculture, another pressing need for the state. Each truck that serves this purpose saves the government the resources it would have used for specialized agricultural tools. This is but another reminder that our leadership has the creativity and drive to cleverly overcome any challenge!"
 TYM_all_roads_lead_to_siberia_desc: "The revisionist administration of Nikolai Bukharin pursued the large-scale industrialization of the Soviet Union's Siberian territories. Inconveniently however, the lands we hold missed out on this. West Siberia is comparatively underdeveloped, with infrastructure that pales in comparison to the regions farther east. If nothing changes, we are doomed to fall behind, and the workers' state will be a historical footnote.\n\nThe Communist Party is incapable of knowing defeat, and we will struggle to right Bukharin's wrongs until our final breaths. West Siberia may be a backwater today, but if the triumph of the October Revolution has taught us anything, it is that the fortunes of a people can change meteorically in a short span of time. With the right vanguard, even a desolate wasteland could become a center of peace and prosperity, given enough time. West Siberia's comeback will be far quicker."
 TYM_seamless_industrialization_desc: "Industrialization is the first and most necessary step towards any nation's greatness. In order to ensure our hegemony over Russia, a rapid buildup of industrial capacity is ideal, but there is always a cost: overcrowded cities, food shortages, damage to the environment, and a decline in standards of living have historically plagued industrializing economies.\n\nThe WSPR is not like other economies, however, in that it is led by a workers' vanguard that looks after the broader population. It is possible for us, without the exploitation of capitalists, to create a fairer industrialization that does not sacrifice the people's well-being on the altar of growth. Full speed ahead! Under the Chairman's leadership, there is but a slim chance of backfire."
 TYM_red_storm_desc: "Since reclaiming West Siberia, the WSPR has been able to take a breather. Compared to our wars against the traitorous junta of Sverdlovsk and the fascistic lunatics of Omsk, this period of relative peace seems almost too good to be true. But let us not be mistaken; this is but a brief respite from the wars that we have fought in the past and those we will face in the future. We are not out of the storm but in its eye.\n\nThe storm of war will advance no matter what we do, and we must be prepared for the worst. Our industrial sector will need to be durable and highly productive in the coming days, and there is still a great amount of work left to do, but when the time comes for war, the reactionaries who menace Russia will learn that is the workers who are the storm, and they who will be obliterated by its rage."
 TYM_the_five_year_plan_desc: "Nikolai Bukharin's insistence on maintaining the New Economic Policy, while successful in pockets of the Soviet Union, failed to build up large pockets of the country and caused its total collapse to the Germans. Our need for development is high and the timeframe must be very soon. Following the old Soviet guidelines for industrial development in the future when the WSPR is still as vulnerable as it is would be suicidal.\n\nThe never-enacted Five Year Plan, part of the policy plank of the Bolshevik opposition, is the only solution to our industrial woes. An enormous state mobilization of all our productive forces for development as suggested by Joseph Stalin would have saved the Soviet Union in 1941, but we must settle for bringing its newest incarnation back to power over all of Russia."
 TYM_rebuilding_the_communes_desc: "The restructuring of the WSPR's infrastructure for war will require the tireless effort of the entire population. Rapid industrialization in the style of Joseph Stalin's plans would certainly improve the situation on that front, but our small slice of the USSR may not be ready for such sweeping changes. Agricultural reform and support for civilians are necessary to ensure that further development does not backfire and immiserate the population.\n\nNew, bigger collective farms! Widespread distribution of agricultural machinery! Massive housing construction drives! The Communist Party will meet all the people's demands and more, and the benefits to industry down the line will be fruitful indeed."
 TYM_repopulation_programs_desc: "History has not been kind to the Russians. War and want have left a great hole in the demographic structure where millions and millions of people should be. When prospects were so dire, who could blame the suffering women of the nation for not wanting to bring children into such a world? Now that things are better, we have run into a different problem: there are simply not enough people for our future economic goals.\n\nWe are first and foremost a party of labor, and there is no nobler labor than motherhood. Subsidies for families and single mothers, awards to those "Mother Heroines" who bravely raise 10 or more children, and controls on abortion will bring us back to where we need to be in terms of population."
 TYM_family_building_desc: "Abandoned by Bukharin in their time of need, the Russian people are in a sense a nation of orphans. There are however also very many literal orphans, those who lost their parents from war's ravages, hunger, or simply abandonment. The orphanages of Tyumen and many other of our cities are sadly filled to well over capacity with such children. Now that we have the time and resources to deal with this abominable situation, we must, or else we are not socialists and hardly even men.\n\nThe WSPR will set up an adoption system that is the pride of the world, linking families without children and children without families. Soon, our orphanages will be empty, and we will have taken the first step to overcoming the trauma of our most vulnerable from this long war."
 TYM_wives_for_soldiers_desc: "While our policies to encourage population growth have been moderately successful so far, we can always go further. Why limit ourselves to subsidizing parenthood and hoping for success when we could give more direct state backing? At the moment, we simply don't have the time to wait for love to run its course unaided.\n\nA new program will seek to automatically assign potential partners to one another, with voluntary membership in exchange for increased rations for female civilians. The other side of these new relationships will come from men automatically registered once they join the army. By demolishing the barriers separating potential partners from one another, the Communist Party hopes to build thousands of fruitful families in the near future."
 TYM_enforced_farming_desc: "Burgeoning industrial development causes a corresponding increase in the population, which in turn requires significantly more food. This is straightforward, but there is one problem: West Siberia is far from being Russia's breadbasket. Agricultural production has never been this region's specialty, but it is hard to imagine a future path for the WSPR if it does not increase significantly.\n\nWe need to make use of every inch of land we possess. Grain quotas will go up. Leaving one's fields idle will be prohibited. The peasantry may protest, but they will be compensated appropriately in the end. The task of feeding the country is one of the most noble ones out there."
 TYM_land_redistribution_desc: "There are a number of peasants willing to contribute to our nascent agricultural development, but they are unable to without any land to work. The uneven distribution of rural land hampers our goals and leads to great suffering among the landless peasantry. As with many social problems, the responsibility falls to the Communist Party to rectify the situation.\n\nCollective farming, a policy of Stalin and segments of the Bolshevik opposition shot down by Bukharin's government, is the key to overcoming our ills. The state will manage farms worked on by all the peasants in an area, allowing for modernization and efficient administration on a vast scale. The landless peasants will know justice, and more food will flow to the cities than ever before."
 TYM_communal_loyalty_desc: "The state can direct the creative powers of its citizens to stunning feats. However, it cannot do everything. While the government's attention is focused on heavy industry and collective agriculture, it will be unable to meet every concern of the communes. In such times, the people must take matters into their own hands.\n\nPropaganda encouraging self-sufficiency and cooperation between citizens is the first step towards molding a spirit of revolutionary sacrifice. People should be taught that every contribution towards the collective well-being, whether it be building wells, teaching their compatriots literacy, organizing work, or any number of other tasks. A socialist state cannot work until the people learn to work together in all ways."
 TYM_breakup_the_unit_desc: "Marxist theory tells us that the nuclear family will wither away with the abolition of private property, as communal institutions rise to take its place. While we have placed effort into reforming family relations in the past, there is always room to revolutionize things further. The family unit itself must be the Communist Party's next target.\n\nDelegating the responsibility of child rearing to the whole community will give parents the freedom for work or leisure. Values of collective solidarity are easier to instill when family barriers that separate children are broken down. With the size and resources of our military, it may be a good idea to give it some role in these new creches."
 TYM_rebuilding_an_army_desc: "Regrettably, the military history of the West Siberian People's Republic has yielded little success. The Republic, faced by betrayal from within, fell apart before even being able to begin the reclamation of the rest of Russia. Now that we have been reduced to Tyumen and its environs, it is clear that we will have to reevaluate our tactics.\n\nThe military is maybe the most important component to the revolution, and the solution to our military predicament likewise mirrors that needed to ensure the rebirth of the Soviet state: industrialization and centralization. The Red Army will be rebuilt into a force that can challenge the strongest, so that it can soon restore proletarian rule to the whole country."
 TYM_the_red_armor_desc: "The old Soviet Union, weakened by revisionist incompetence, was woefully unprepared for the onslaught of the fascists' modern army. Some of the most humiliating defeats came from the Reich's tank brigades, which swept over much of the country with devastating power.\n\nAs we prepare to reclaim the West Siberian People's Republic, we can take one lesson from our enemy: modern armor is an enormously powerful weapon in the right hands. Mechanizing the Red Army will hone it into a force capable of rapidly expanding our territory. Decisive action will make the difference in this war, and focusing on tanks allows us to focus on just that."
 TYM_revisit_the_doctrines_desc: "Our critics often accuse us of being overly wedded to doctrine. While adherence to Marx's theories is necessary to the utmost degree, the military is a different matter. Our reconstruction of the army to incorporate armored warfare is well underway, and our tactics have not kept up to the changing situation.\n\nThe tank is a powerful tool, but we will need a strategy to avoid wastefully losing them against enemy fire. As we witnessed too well during the Great Patriotic War, the Germans made a highly effective use of rapid tank deployment to overwhelm and disable us before we could even respond. Perhaps we need a "Blitzkrieg" of our own..."
 TYM_study_modern_designs_desc: "Russia's long isolation has cut it off from recent military developments, understandably considering the general state of chaos. We have had neither the opportunity nor the capital to begin improving our tank technology. The rest of the world has made considerable improvements in this regard, however.\n\nLuckily for us, we do not need to start our research program totally from scratch. Captured German and covertly donated American and Japanese tanks have sat abandoned in our armories since the 1950's. It is only a matter of reverse engineering them before we have designs of our own to show for our efforts."
 TYM_homebrew_armored_power_desc: "We have drawn plans, laid the theoretical groundwork, and closely studied the results of cutting edge foreign engineering. We have acquired the industrial capacity necessary for a modern army after years of ceaseless toil. Our workers have the necessary equipment and are full of zeal to serve the proletarian state.\n\nWe have everything we need to begin our tank program. Our factories stand ready to produce as many as we need to fully liberate west Siberia from the traitors that have plagued it for so long. All that there is left to do is begin."
 TYM_our_own_designs_desc: "Though we have made admirable progress in our armor development programs, the reality is that Tyumen is still an underdeveloped statelet, and our designers are only human. There have been a number of pressing issues with the new tank designs that must be resolved if they are to be effective.\n\nThese vehicles have been made with heavy influence from foreign models that are not necessarily suited for the environmental and industrial conditions of Russia. We need to modify them to suit our needs and establish a systematic framework of examination and data collection to do so."
 TYM_study_the_performance_desc: "Until this point, we have made great strides in tank designs and theoretical applications. Now that we have entered the construction stage, it is imperative that we move to practical fields. Accurate measures of their abilities in the field are consequently vital.\n\nWhat better way to investigate the performance of our tanks than to perform combat trials? Seeing how they move and fight in a controlled environment will give our scientists badly needed data about their abilities and allow us to make whatever modifications we need based on hard numbers."
 TYM_our_own_stratagem_desc: "One of the greatest tragedies of the downfall of the Soviet Union was the scattering of some of Russia's greatest talents to the wind. General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, known as the "Red Napoleon" for his contributions in the 1920's and 30's, is but one of these. Before his presumed death during the collapse of the WRRF, he innovated greatly in the field of military doctrine, with his "deep battle" theory, which emphasizes the movement of many formations in order to achieve victory through the entire battlefield, being of particular note.\n\nIn a fight such as this, where resources are limited and the outcome of a battle rests on a knife's edge, superior tactics are vital. Repurposing the work of the Soviet greats will only help us achieve victory."
 TYM_study_the_results_desc: "Now that we have performed closed trials, the next step for our burgeoning tank program is live-fire incidents. In battle, events proceed that cannot be predicted simply by using observations produced in the safe environment of testing grounds, and tank crews act far differently when in real combat.\n\nFor better or worse, there are many opportunities to enter a fight in warlord Russia. Bandits and raiders have plagued the countryside for years, preying on the peasants and making administration difficult. Sending our tanks after them will provide a relatively low-risk way to gather results, as well as freeing the people from their longtime oppressors."
 TYM_the_red_army_desc: "The core of any army, rather than sophisticated weapons or lofty strategies, is its men. Since the Great Patriotic War, Russian forces have held their own against the far more modern Wehrmacht simply by being well-trained and disciplined, even with the gap in resources.\n\nArmor has its place, but focusing too heavily on new technology over the cohesion and effectiveness of our soldiers expends resources that we cannot afford to waste. An infantry-centered army, with professional, well-equipped soldiers and vehicles in a support role, is the way forward to a new Soviet Union."
 TYM_be_brave_desc: "The barebones conditions we have been forced to work with mean that soldiers are often insufficiently trained, with poor morale. Soldiers often fight solely for the potential paycheck, abandoning their posts at the first sign of danger. As we professionalize our army, reforming its culture is key.\n\nThe worthy successors of the Red Army need to match it in cohesion. We will create a sense of brotherhood and patriotism in our soldiers as a collective. Marx taught us that the anarchy of hyper-individualism is no way to run a society. It is likewise the path to disaster for any reasonable military."
 TYM_reform_the_NKVD_desc: "The Bukharin regime, compromised as it was by revisionism and opportunism, was unwilling and unable to properly crack down on counter-revolutionary sentiments among the populace. The military was particularly poorly monitored in this regard, and the ultimate consequences were the deposition of Bukharin himself and the complete dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe new Red Army will not repeat such mistakes. The recreated NKVD will focus especially on the military, ensuring political loyalty and education and prosecuting crimes committed by soldiers as they reclaim the country. We must never forget that the army has some of the greatest potential for counter-revolution and therefore take steps to keep it under as much Party control as possible."
 TYM_not_once_step_back_desc: "During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet Union collapsed the day that its soldiers first chose to run rather than defend to the last man! They spoke of the Motherland and its infinite land... enough population and bread as far as the Urals to feed them all, they said. How foolish such talk was! Retreat after retreat, the cowardly men of the Red Army failed to see what they were fighting for before they stood a thousand kilometers from Moscow. We now see all too well the finity of Russia from Tyumen.\n\nThis defeatist and cowardly attitude was without a doubt what doomed the Union! The men lacked resolve, the officers lacked tenacity, and the whole army lacked courage! Under the right leadership, we would've seen an iron Russia, with an industrial backbone and as foundation of loyal, unfaltering men.\n\nIt is with the goal of this in mind that we demand this of the Red Army: under no circumstances shall unauthorized retreats take place! Under Kaganovich, we will build a new Russia!"
 TYM_the_red_tide_desc: "The soldiers of the Red Army cannot simply be the most plentiful, as the Nazi dogs would like to portray the "asiatic hordes;" they must also be the strongest, the most zealous, and the best drilled in the whole of Eurasia! It is the Red Army's soldier whose duty it was and continues to be to defend his Motherland from the terrors of fascism and dangers of reactionary thought and division!\n\nIt is also the duty of every able-bodied Russian man to take the place of the Red Army soldier during wartime, as he must provide for the Motherland in exchange for what it has given him. In doing this, he too must become the hardest willed, the sturdiest under pressure, the embodiment of the Soviet Man.\n\nIf we are to bring back the glory of the Soviet Union and return the sanctity of the Motherland, we must start with our warriors. Under the new discipline we shall forge a new USSR!"
 TYM_be_strong_desc: "We, the Russian people, have been ridiculed and accused of being weak individuals, acting in hordes to move against our many enemies. We must show the world what the power of the Russian man is when utilized to his full capacity. With this we will unleash our new campaign, one of a simple motto, but one that will fill our soldiers with a patriotic urge unlike any other; Be Strong!\n\nFor too long the Slavic man has been trampled, his lands ravaged, and his people massacred. But that shall no longer be true. The soldiers of our armies will be the paragon of strength, the paragon of virtue, and as such must be equipped in turn.\n\nThe best equipment at the disposal of our armories, or that can be bought from around the fractured Russia we seek to piece back together, will be given to our soldiers. While the best Russian equipment is not the best in the world, our soldiers will, with no doubt be the definition of the New Soviet Man."
 TYM_reform_the_guard_desc: "The Guard forms one of the many political excesses of the system, a remnant of an older age that has rotted in incapability rather than adapted to the changing times. If they cannot evolve, we must force them to. The Red Guard, forming a system of paramilitary organizations more political than functional, is barely a combat-capable force, and in a situation where they were thrust into battle they would struggle at best.\n\nWe must change this through a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Red Guard. While the political aspect is important and their contribution to stability is notable we have been given reason to believe that many of the lower-level leaders of the Guard have no business being leaders at all, especially not of such an esteemed political organization.\n\nThe rotting externalities of the Guard will be cut off and ruthlessly examined, while capable men will be put into these positions. The Guard will also have more frequent training in more relevant tactics, with better equipment and routine pay to expand loyalty."

None of these would be a match for a truly battle-hardened, disciplined, and drilled army, functioning as cogs in a giant machine that will roll through all of Russia, from Vladivostok to the Baltics.\n\nIn the coming trials, each soldier will be faced with difficulty, forced to confront sacrifice, and even experience it themselves.

The leaders of the two main cliques - Chairman Kaganovich and Khrushchev - must settle their, and their followers' differences. As such, a new party congress will be called.\n\nThe congress will help focus the party's vision and bring its disparate wings together - but beneath that, deals will be made, threats delivered, and bribes taken as Kaganovich and Khrushchev jostle for influence.

Chairman Kaganovich is convinced of the need to focus on the military, arguing that civilian industry is pointless if it cannot be defended from the traitors who have fractured West Siberia. The Chairman reminds the party of the land the Republic has lost and what industry they could regain that could support both our people and military.\n\nInvestments in the civilian sector are favored by Khrushchev. He asks what the point of a strong military is if we cannot support the people of Tyumen and of the land which we will soon reclaim, as he notes how a strong populace is needed to support the military.\n\nWhich of the two men's vision will succeed may decide the fate of Russia."

Other farms will be seized, and their land used to construct industrial centers that will initially support, sustain and expand themselves.\n\nIn the future, their mighty production lines will be turned to face outwards as they manufacture the equipment the army will use to strike at the hearts of those who abandoned the Soviet Union, and one day - the German menace itself."

We could build mines and plants to extract these assets and sell them for the betterment of the state.\n\nFor Khrushchev, he sees more opportunity in focusing on projects that better the public.

For too many, conditions are abysmal. Most workers do not live in safe, well-maintained abodes. Access to potable water and reliable electricity remains low.

All around us, there are traitors to the Union, determined to crush the last great hope for communism anywhere. We must improve our army and give it an edge in the fights to come.

Will we wait until the reactionaries and deviationists have amassed armies great enough to destroy us?\n\nClearly, turning defensive is absurd. Chairman Kaganovich has laid out a masterful argument.

Comrade Khrushchev has laid out a masterful argument against this folly. Under his leadership, we will reorient our military toward defensive doctrines that can protect what we have, then retaliate.

By making our existing collective farms more efficient, and allowing them to grow and expand, our people will be fed with bountiful harvests in no time, as though a great banquet appeared from a magic tablecloth."
 
 TYM_the_riches_of_siberia: "The Riches of Siberia"
 TYM_the_riches_of_siberia_desc: "Our location in Siberia is both a blessing and a curse. Although Siberia is one of the most resource-rich regions in the world: blessed with oil, ore, minerals and much more, it is also one of the most isolated regions in the world, consisting largely of remote villages with few opportunities to exploit these riches for the good of man. If we are to build socialism in Siberia, we must expand our infrastructure to include harvesting these materials for the processing of goods our workers may consume: prospectors must be sent out to remote regions, mines and oil refineries must be built on significant resource deposits, and processing plans must be built so we may turn these raw materials into usable products."

 TYM_a_glance_to_bukharin: "A Glance to Bukharin"
 TYM_a_glance_to_bukharin_desc: "The WSPR is a state built on Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist ideology; however, there are times when we must be pragmatic and break with theory in the face of practice. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the factories of Siberia have sat silent, their machines slowly rusting away, the workers and peasants have lived in a state of squalor and poverty which orthodox Stalinist economic policies have done little to alleviate. Some of our officials advocate a return to orthodox Marxist-Leninist-Bukharinist economic policies of free markets and foreign investments, on the grounds that they can accelerate the forces of production in our country in ways non-capitalist modes of production cannot, given the lack of industrial development within our borders."
 
 TYM_the_orthodox_approach: "The Orthodox Approach"
 TYM_the_orthodox_approach_desc: "Stalin opposed free markets for a reason: while they may encourage short term-growth, they will ultimately stifle the great socialist experiment by exacerbating social inequalities and making it more difficult for the working class to seize control of the means of production in the long term. Although the Bukharinist methods of economic growth may seem a tempting solution to poverty, they cannot be implemented in Siberia. By increasing industrial production quotas, expanding the factories we have and distributing the fruits of labour equally among all working peoples, we will be better able to build a true socialist society in the long term."
 
 TYM_the_next_stage_awaits: "The Next Stage Awaits!"
 TYM_the_next_stage_awaits_desc: "Though Siberia may have began as a destitute backwater, through proper application of Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist theory, our nation has metamorphosed into a shining example of socialism in the post-USSR world, proving that the socialist experiment has not yet failed. Factories are bustling with activity as workers man the machines day and night, the fields of the collective farms are golden with crops ripe for harvesting, and the countryside is dotted with mines, oil wells and railroads. However, now is not the time to rest upon our laurels: we must expand what we already have, and begin the next stage of our economic growth."
 
 TYM_the_seeds_of_soviet_progress: "The Seeds of Soviet Progress"
 TYM_the_seeds_of_soviet_progress_desc: "We are not mere utopians who daydream idly about castles in the sky or make half-hearted moral arguments about the necessity of socialism: we are scientific socialists, whose victory in the class conflict is guaranteed by superior knowledge of Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist theory and the dialectic. To ensure we stand victorious against our counter-revolutionary foes, we must develop our scientific and technological base, so that we are armed with the latest weaponry and equipped with the latest machinery. Anyone who wishes to be education for whatever reason must be given the education they desire, and new scientists, social theorists and civil servants must be trained for a future of directing the revolution. Only then will we truly live up to the name of scientific socialism."
 
 TYM_illiteracy_liquidation_programs: "Illiteracy Liquidation Programs"
 TYM_illiteracy_liquidation_programs_desc: "After the collapse of the USSR, illiteracy in Russia spiked as centralized, public education ceased to exist and getting food on the table today became more important than educating one's children for tomorrow. We must end this turn of events now, and begin illiteracy liquidation programs to help educate the peasantry and other lower classes who form the backbone of socialism. Every village must have their own school which the children must attend regularly with a standardized, socialist curriculum to teach them about skills, technology, the world around them, and most importantly, the revolutionary future to come."
 
 TYM_expand_the_institutes: "Expand the Institutes"
 TYM_expand_the_institutes_desc: "Knowledge is the greatest weapon the revolution has, and the greatest kind of education is that of the university and institute. To ensure a new generation that can lead the revolution is properly trained, we must re-open universities for bureaucrats and civil servants and specialized engineering, health and economic institutes across the country. Where there were none before, new ones must be built under the tutelage of existing educational facilities. Most importantly, we must grant free education and lodging for all students to encourage education and learning among all walks of life."
 
 TYM_revolution_in_thought_and_theory: "Revolution in Thought and Theory"
 TYM_revolution_in_thought_and_theory_desc: "Our socialism is called scientific for a reason: it is grounded on observation of the world around us and the formulating of new theory and practice based on these observations. However, the most important aspect of science is that it must be open to change and debate: Stalin built up his theories based on those of Lenin, who in turn based his thought on Marx. It is time we begin a new chapter in the history of Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist ideology by encouraging free thought among the intelligentsia and writers and giving them the free ability to critique existing approaches to theory and formulate new solutions to them - within the bounds of reason, of course..."
 
 TYM_honor_the_visionaries: "Honor the Visionaries"
 TYM_honor_the_visionaries_desc: "The revolution will be guided by visionaries - the thinkers, the scientists, and most of all the theorists of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism. To raise a new generation of great men and women who can lead the proletariat onto socialism, we must focus our educational programs on the sciences, from geography to zoology. Critical thinking and creative solutions to problems must be emphasised by the curriculum, with the most brilliant and innovative students given top priority in education. Most importantly, we must educate the children on Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism and socialist thought, that they may one day grow up and contribute to the development of this most vital field."
 
 TYM_a_generation_of_workers: "A Generation of Workers"
 TYM_a_generation_of_workers_desc: "The working class are the backbone of every society, and our educational program must emphasise this. We must train a new generation of technical specialists - geologists, engineers, chemists and technicians, which the curriculum must reflect. The highest priority of our schools and universities should be hard sciences and engineering with an emphasis on vocation and practical results. To prepare students for a future of labour, problems and exercises must be based on real-world situations, and part-time work in the field they have chosen to specialise in will be essential for graduation. Only when the workers of Siberia are properly trained and have firm real world experience will socialism be built and every person can live as a Tsar."

To honour those fallen heroes, it is only fitting that we adopt the same basic doctrines and military tactics of our forefathers. However, to ensure that this new Red Army will stand victorious in the coming wars against the reactionaries, fascists and revisionists who have taken control of the motherland, we must innovate and build upon those principles. Only then will the Red Army of Workers and Peasants be the unstoppable juggernaut of revolutionary fury it was meant to be."

 TYM_elevate_proven_officers_desc: "The bedrock on which the Red Army is built upon is the old Red Army of the Patriotic War, but its brick and mortar are its officers who lead the militant workers into battle. Over the course of the unification wars, many new and promising officers, fresh from the cadet schools displayed great tactical brilliance, cunning and bravery in the field of battle. By promoting these promising youths, not only will we gain a generation of innovative but experienced commanders to lead the revolution to come, but it will show the men and women of the People's Republic that anyone may become a hero if they are daring and intelligent enough."

 TYM_repurpose_nkvd_units_desc: "The steadfast men and women of the NKVD are the protectors of the revolution in the People's Republic. Few people outside its ranks save for the Party itself are more devoted to the cause of socialism than they, but their numbers are far in excess of their stated goal of protecting the people's republics from its enemies within. This, forming field units of NKVD troopers to aid their Red Army comrades in the battle of the reactionary enemies without is an ideal use of their manpower. Forming a core of ideologically pure, disciplined shock troopers, the forces of the NKVD can be an invaluable hammer, smashing the counter-revolutionaries into the dust without mercy or second thought - if they are allowed on the field, that is."
 
 TYM_new_commissarial_appointments: "New Commissarial Appointments"
 TYM_new_commissarial_appointments_desc: "The West Siberian People's Republic is a nation built upon Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist ideology, the only legitimate continuation of Lenin's work. However, very few soldiers in the Red Army understand this, nor the true Stalinist cause they are fighting for, as the political officer corps that guides them are in shambles. Nevertheless, at the same time, the NKVD, a bastion of ideological purity outside the party itself, has an excess of personnel who could serve the cause of socialism better outside the organization. By taking the most ideologically loyal members of the NKVD without any major assignments and transferring them to the commissariat, they will be able to rally the workers to the cause of revolutionary warfare and we can solve the problem of the over-staffed NKVD at the same time."

 TYM_lessons_from_the_reclamation_war_desc: "It was in the fires of the unification wars that the Red Army of the West Siberian People's Republic was forged, and it is time to adopt the innovations and practices discovered during these conflicts into formal military doctrine. The officers who came up with the daring new tactics and cunning stratagems to overcome the many liberals and reactionaries who besieged us will be given first priority when hiring instructors at military academies, and even the bureaucrats who learned how to conserve and distribute supplies under pressure will be promoted to top management. The one constant of the dialectic is change, and those who do not learn this lesson and adapt will perish."

 TYM_remember_the_antifascist_war_desc: "The Red Army of Workers and Peasants traces its lineage to the original Red Army that nobly sacrificed themselves in the struggle against fascism so many years ago, but to avoid their fate, we must analyse their failures and learn how to overcome them. The battles and campaigns of the war must be analysed down to the last detail and the mistakes they made identified and corrected in future doctrine. However, even the tactics and doctrines of the fascists must be studied at length, not only to prepare ourselves for future wars against these aggressors, but to learn what they did right and adopt their practices. When the fascists come knocking at the door, they will find their foes have learned to fight their fire with fire."

To ensure the victory of the socialist revolution in the class struggle to come, we must study and adopt these new technologies and the ways of war they entail. Although regular relations with the world beyond Russia are difficult to maintain, we must do our best to send observers to friendly countries with advanced methods of war already, learn of their new tactics and strategies and adopt them for the Red Army of Workers and Peasants to the best of our ability."

 TYM_developments_for_the_soldier_desc: "Most of our soldiers are still wearing uniforms and equipment from the Anti-Fascist War; impressive by the standards of the Russian unification struggle, but laughably obsolete compared to the armies outside Russia. Already, even nations of moderate size elsewhere in the world are adopting new and advanced equipment, like camouflage and body armour even for the most basic of infantrymen. Adopting them for our own troops will not only give us a vast edge against the reactionary warlords along our borders, but will also guarantee the armies of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism victory against the capitalists who enslave the world beyond the frontiers of Russia."

 TYM_return_to_zlatoust_desc: "After the collapse of the Soviet Union and its revisionists, Colonel Kalashnikov in Zlatoust created a new and revolutionary weapon, the AK-47, to arm the post-Russian successor states. However, it has been decades since the day the rifle was introduced, and it is beginning to show its age. However, if our gunsmiths were to examine the strengths of the AK-47 and build a new, socialist assault rifle with the most modern technology available to us, it can be a powerful advantage over our both immediate and future opponents. It would be a killing machine honed by scientific analysis of its design and an awe-inspiring symbol of proletarian fury through the workers who wield it."

We must adopt the new, powerful Infantry Fighting Vehicle design of the nations beyond the Russian frontier that can both protect its troops from any possible harm and deal out large amounts of damage. This new IFV shall be Russian and socialist in character, which will not only do what the others can. It should be produced cheaply by any team of proletarians with the right equipment, can drive for many leagues on the rugged Russian terrain while conserving energy, and take any damage and still keep fighting like a true son of the Motherland."

 TYM_the_is_tank_desc: "Armoured warfare has come a long way since the Anti-Fascist War. The queen of the battlefield is the Main Battle Tank, which combines the firepower of a heavy tank with the mobility of a medium tank, and it is time we build our own MBT. Larger, heavier and more devastating than anything seen on the field, we will name this new tank the Iosef Stalin tank, after the greatest Marxist thinker since Marx himself and the legitimate successor to Lenin. Both reactionaries and revisionists alike will know the true fury of Marxism-Leninism-Stalinist ideology when facing it on the battlefield."

No settlement has not been attacked by these iron vultures, and no family within our borders have not lost a member to the fascist bombs. However, if we build up a powerful air force and strong anti-air defences in our cities, we will never have to fear a bombing campaign like that of the fascists' again. At last the workers and peasants of Siberia may sleep safely knowing that the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist aviators will protect the skies above them."

 TYM_the_siberian_air_fleet_desc: "The creation of a Siberian Air Force is under way, but thus far they are relying on antiquated aircraft from the Anti-Fascist War and airfields with decades-obsolete infrastructure in locations no longer of strategic importance. To truly rule the skies over Russia, we must expand and develop what infrastructure and equipment we already have. Ordering construction workers to build new airfields with up-to-date equipment, while existing factories can be re-ordered to build warplanes and the machinery to manufacture them. It may take some time, but in due course the Siberian Air Fleet shall become a wonder of not only Russia, but of the world."

Although the world beyond our borders is filled with capitalists and reactionaries of all stripes, we must come up with a concrete foreign policy that balances both upholding Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist ideology and the realities that we face. Although the process of choosing a final path to take will be long and arduous, and not everyone will be satisfied with the compromises we must make, it is imperative that we now choose."

 TYM_peaceful_coexistence_desc: "There will come a time when the workers of the world, led by the true party of Lenin, will rise up against their bourgeoisie oppressors. Armed with Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist ideology and with history on their side, the fury of the proletariat will obliterate the capitalist system that held them in chains.\n\nThat day is not today.\n\nIndeed, we are the only Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist state on Earth, and very few nations are communists, much less those whom ideological purists are willing to work with. Although it is not the most politically correct option, working with capitalist states would be able to quickly make short work of the biggest threats such as the fascists of Germany and Japan- the revolution can always be fermented at a later date, after all..."
 
 TYM_the_revolution_does_not_wait: "The Revolution Does Not Wait"
 TYM_the_revolution_does_not_wait_desc: "It was the fascists of Germany who brutalized the working class of Russia, and fascism is merely capitalism in decay. No matter how tempting working with capitalists may be in the short term, they will only betray us and seek to enslave the proletarian class once our most immediate enemies are defeated. We must take a hard stance towards the liberals and reactionaries at our doorstep and refuse to cooperate with the twisted bourgeois class no matter what happens, and take every chance we get to support Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist revolutions beyond our borders. The revolution begins now!"
 
 TYM_a_nod_to_the_west: "A Nod to the West"
 TYM_a_nod_to_the_west_desc: "Historically, the capitalist nations and the Soviet Union have had rocky relations. The October Revolution was viewed with utmost suspicion by Britain, France, and the United States, who intervened on behalf of reactionary forces. Now that fascism is ascendant and the United States stands alone as the only surviving liberal great power, the situation is very different.\nAlthough many of our differences are irreconcilable, the consequence of the rule of differing class interests, there is one thing we can agree upon: fascism is and remains the greatest enemy of all mankind, and we must put our differences aside to smash it. Consequently, we will promptly reopen diplomatic relations with the Organization of Free Nations and embark upon the task of building an anti-fascist coalition."

 TYM_southern_cooperation_desc: "The communication lines have been established; Russian and Kazakh communist governments have now built ties for the first time since the West Russian War. Our activities can't stop at merely contacting the Kazakh SSR, however. Both of our territories have been severely damaged by years of war and economic strain. As communists, we must have solidarity, and as the more powerful polity the West Siberian People's Republic has a responsibility to aid its partner.\nTrade, economic assistance, and transfers of military supplies between West Siberia and the Kazakh SSR will commence shortly, strengthening our two republics and the bond between them. We can only hope that the future political situation will allow the Kazakh SSR and Russia to reunify sooner rather than later."
 
 TYM_congratulate_compatible_governments: "Congratulate Compatible Governments"
 TYM_congratulate_compatible_governments_desc: "In another time, the world socialist bloc would be great enough in size that we could oppose and ruthlessly criticize every capitalist government on Earth. In ours, the socialist movement is still small and vulnerable, dwarfed in all areas by the fascist behemoth. We need to build ties not only with communist parties, but with any government that has proven itself receptive to anti-fascism and left wing principles.\nNon-Marxist socialists, left-wing parties of bourgeois democracies, and other potential, though imperfect, allies of the struggle for workers and against fascism deserve our praise, in the spirit of building a broad "popular front" against reactionary tyranny. The time for ideological purity will come after the beliefs of Hitler and Mussolini are gone for good."

The Central Asian SSRs were beset with internal instability as well as the Iranian-Afghan invasion. Many of those communist governments still exist, although in diminished forms, and our Central Asian comrades deserve to be supported in their struggle.\nWhile we have been distracted by our own wars for some time, the situation has stabilized enough to begin contacting aligned governments outside of our own borders. From here on out, our government will seek to open lines of communication with Central Asia, building the foundation for what should be prosperous and mutually beneficial future relations."

 TYM_support_central_asia_desc: "Central Asia has shattered, and not all of the new states therein are aligned with socialist values. The Kazakh territories are rife with reactionary warlordism, with some governments abandoning socialism completely. For the Soviet system to reestablish itself within Central Asia, we must build ties with those states still compatible with our values and tilt the balance of power within their favor.\nThere are still several surviving SSRs which have stay to true to communist ideals that we should seek to ally and support. As we are still too weak to make a play for the annexation of Central Asia, expanding our geopolitical influence will have to do in the meantime."

 TYM_condemn_the_warmongers_desc: "There is no greater enemy of the people than imperialist war. Throughout the 20th century, the powers of Europe, Asia, and North America have systematically sent their citizens to their deaths in the trenches, seas, and skies, all for the benefit of a tiny profiteering elite. Germany and Japan, the most ruthless imperialist powers on earth, deserve special condemnation for their violent enslavement of their continents, plunging millions into the utterest misery. The United States, third and "kindest" superpower, practices only slightly better behavior, coating its crimes beneath a veneer of concern for liberty and democracy.\nAs communists, we stand firmly against wars of aggression from all parties, and we intend to carry this principle onto the international stage. If the imperialists insist on continuing their bloodshed, we will continue to ceaselessly criticize them."
 
 TYM_a_policy_of_solidarity: "A Policy of Solidarity"
 TYM_a_policy_of_solidarity_desc: "The world, since the late nineteenth century, has been in the thrall of imperialist powers that have steadily grown larger in size and fewer in number. Nowadays as few as three or four great powers rule over the entire planet with an iron fist, with only small areas being truly independent. In Lenin's words, imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism, and it is the responsibility of any true socialist to oppose it wherever it rears its ugly head.\nWe can't do much to aid the colonized world from West Siberia, but we can offer our future support. When the Soviet Union rises from the ashes, it will herald a new dawn of anti-imperialist struggle and be a friend of socialist movements of national liberation the world over."
 
 TYM_denounce_social_fascism: "Denounce Social Fascism"
 TYM_denounce_social_fascism_desc: "One of the most insidious political ideologies in the world is social democracy. Purportedly a friend of the labor movement, it in fact disarms and defangs the proletariat, funneling its energies into pointless reform movements rather than firmly opposing capital and siding with warmongers and reactionaries time and time again, as was seen in the Great War, the failed German Revolution, the Russian Civil War, and countless other conflicts. Far from being an ally of the workers, it is one of the most ingenious tools of the bourgeoisie, just another side of the same coin as fascism.\nWe must condemn "social fascism" wherever it rises, hopefully leading the workers of the western world out of this trap. Those who are salvageable will listen; those who are not will reveal themselves as such, when they refuse to abandon the path of electoral "reform"."
 
 TYM_the_call_of_the_comintern: "The Call of the Comintern"
 TYM_the_call_of_the_comintern_desc: "After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1918, the infant Soviet state formed a Communist International in the name of advancing socialist revolution. As a result of the revolutionary ebb of the interbellum and the rise of fascism, the Comintern failed to advance revolution outside of the Soviet Union itself, and it did not survive the dissolution of Bukharin's government. As the revolutionary movement slowly but surely rebuilds itself, the need for a Communist International presents itself once again.\nThe WSPR, the rightful successor of the fallen Soviet state, is the obvious choice to head a successor to the Comintern. Founding a Communist International will signal the rebirth of international socialism. If such an organization already exists, we will join it, quickly taking up a leadership role, and assist the furthering of the world revolution however we can."

 TYM_on_the_right_track_desc: "The Soviet Union is well on track to its restoration. Almost half of the motherland has been taken back, be it from the fascists, the pretenders, or the warlords. However, now that a secure power base has been established in Central Russia, the process of warring must take a temporary reprieve. Comrade Kaganovich understands that, if the state is to expand into the rest of Russia, it will need a strong industrial sector, a well-organized military, and a political system free of internal threats.\n\nThus, all three must be accomplished. Engineers and industrialists will begin the rapid construction of a new heavy industry sector that will provide tanks, rifles, and artillery pieces that will be needed for further expansion. The military will be expanded, and allowed to retrain and reorganize following the grueling campaigns to unite Western Siberia. Finally, certain political elements will be... removed, in order to prevent the rise of internal threats or opposition to Kaganovich's guiding hand. While these goals may seem difficult to achieve, they are necessary if the Soviet Union is ever to be restored."

 TYM_inaugurate_the_third_five_year_plan_desc: "The newly reclaimed territories in Siberia are, to say the least, poor. Very few roads are paved or maintained, there is little access to electricity and running water, and most of the people live off subsistence farming in small villages. Thus, the time has come to introduce the party and the people to the second five year plan so far. After it is approved, a vast modernization effort will begin all across Siberia to industrialize and build up the region. Factories to produce tanks, weapons, and munitions will become the norm, giving the Red Army the ability to fight wars against far larger and better-armed foes.\n\nThe old Union fell because of the failure of Chairman Bukharin to build up a modern military industry. He failed to recognize the need for Russia to industrialize as quickly and as heavily as possible, and both he and the Russian people paid for it in blood. Comrade Kaganovich understands his enemies, his people, and the lessons he can learn from the past. He will not make the same mistake as his predecessor."

 TYM_in_stalins_way_desc: "The late Comrade Stalin was a great friend and mentor to our very own Comrade Kaganovich. His political and social philosophy has guided and protected both Kaganovich and the state many times. In fact, Comrade Kaganovich openly admits to asking himself what Comrade Stalin would do, when presented with a complex situation. We should honor Stalin for giving us such a bright future, and fully embrace "Stalinist" ideals as the official position of the state. Doing so would not only honor the man's memory, but likely guide us into a brighter future."

 TYM_commissariat_of_civil_defence_desc: "An army by itself is not enough. While it is indeed helpful to have a million men on standby in the event of war, those men are of no use if given no weapons to fight, or if they are simply a massed horde. All armies require organization and logistics-- something in very short supply in the Siberian wastes. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich, in light of this issue and the ever-growing power of the state, has decided to organize a new governmental organization: the Commissariat of Civil Defense.\n\nThis new organization will oversee all the functions regarding the preparation of war. It will organize and equip units of men, ensure factory production is adequate to meet demand, and prepare propaganda for any eventual war that may or may not erupt. The world is a changing place, and the safety of the state and its people must be considered of the utmost priority."

 TYM_factory_institutes_desc: "The invasion of the Hitlerites and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union were great tragedies, not only for their cost in lives, but the damage done to the future of the Russian people. Many across the shattered remains of the Motherland cannot read or write, and know only how to till soil and plant crops. Such was the way for many centuries, but it is not the way of modernity. Today is the age of machines and factories and steel, and so Russia must be dragged, kicking and screaming, into being an industrial society. Many of the newly conscripted factory workers must be trained by another person, rather than being able to read and understand simple directions.\n\nTo solve these issues pressing down on the industrial sector, Comrade Kaganovich has devised a plan: factory schooling. In most major factories and industrial plants across the country, there will be classrooms in which the largely illiterate workforce may learn to read and write. While it certainly will not provide them with a true education as they would have received elsewhere in the world, it will be more than sufficient."

 TYM_breaking_some_eggs_desc: "As Comrade Kaganovich says, one must break some eggs to make an omelet, just as one must occasionally break down the political opposition to get something done. The internal political situation is simply too delicate at the moment for Comrade Kaganovich's liking. There are too many threats to his power, and too many traitors against the revolution. These men not only are a danger to the people and the state, they also could be implicated in certain... failings of the state in the past.\n\nThese agitators and problematic individuals must be dealt with, swiftly and with as little resistance as possible. They will be rounded up, just as their kin in the military were short months ago, and either carted off to labor camps in Siberia or executed. While some commissariats may lose some valuable assets, what has been lost pales in comparison to what might be gained from their removal."

 TYM_long_arm_of_the_nkvd_desc: "The NKVD is the most useful tool in state security that Comrade Kaganovich and the revolution could hope for. While it is certainly no small organization at the moment, it must be expanded the larger the state grows. The more citizens under our purview, the more surveillance and accountability must be placed on them. In short: the NKVD must be grown. It must have eyes and ears in every corner, every alley, every meeting room, and every production line. No one will be able to keep a secret with anyone but themselves, and thus, no conspiracies could be possible.\n\nThis new NKVD will strike fear into the hearts of men-- a fear that is quite literally unspeakable. All know that they are watching, but know not from where. All know that they are listening, and so dare not speak their name. They shall hold every transgression against the revolution accountable, and leave no stone unturned, and no man unquestioned."

 TYM_a_hammer_in_every_hand_desc: "Every man, young, old, sick, must serve society in some way. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production. If Russia is ever to be reunited under the banner of the restored Union, she will need every able-bodied worker and soldier that she can. While the new industrialization plans kick off, the newly-constructed factories will need workers-- a resource upon which all socialism is built. These workers will be, for lack of a better word, conscripted, mostly from small agricultural villages. Every hand not holding a rifle or a child will be given a hammer to further the goals of Soviet socialism. After all, idle hands are the Hitlerites' playthings."

 TYM_metro_2_desc: "Mankind is facing an existential threat unlike any it has encountered in its brief existence on this planet: total nuclear annihilation. Dread it, run from it, it may very well still arrive, and if it does, mankind is likely to face total extinction. Be it from the flames of Himmler's ambition, a rapidly escalating conflict between the world's great powers, or just a simple mistake, the chance of nuclear war is too high to ignore. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich has laid out a plan for the preservation of the Russian people and of Soviet socialism such that it may survive whatever cataclysm the man brings down upon himself.\n\nThis plan, dubbed Metro-2, consists of a large network of tunnels and housing built beneath Tyumen. It would function as basically an underground city, capable of housing around 10,000 individuals. The network would be built on top of the water table, and thus have access to clean fresh water, in addition to geothermal and hydroelectric generators, food stores, and even growing rooms for small-scale agriculture. It would also have a large research section, from which the state can perform its largest and most secret science experiments. If the world is truly set on fire, Metro-2 might just be the safest place to wait for the ashes to cool."

 TYM_project_cain_desc: "The "Closed Availability Information Network" is a project envisioned by Comrade Kaganovich and heavily inspired by the success of the Metro-2 project. In it, many major cities across Western Siberia would be provided with large underground bunker networks, ostensibly to provide shelter to loyal citizens in the event of a nuclear war. In reality, these bunkers would be largely composed of labs, filled to the brim with enterprising scientists. They would provide an ideal place to conduct our most secret and/or dangerous experiments, far away from the prying eyes of the people or foreign spies. While some may call the trials done here "unethical", there is little ethical about not exploiting any advantage available for the benefit of socialism and the Russian people."

 TYM_no_such_thing_as_propaganda_desc: "What liberal dissidents would call "propaganda" or "deception", Comrade Kaganovich calls "necessary". Siberia can be compared to a stained glass window. In the old days, before the Soviet Union dissolved, the Communist Party and the state served as the pewter metalwork that held the window together. Now, the window is broken into a thousand different pieces of a thousand colors and a thousand ideologies. The only way to put the pieces of the window back together is through the media and political indoctrination of the public.\n\nTo successfully achieve mass propaganda and indoctrination, a much tighter grip will have to be placed over Siberia as a whole. The mass media will have to be greatly expanded and new, standardized school curricula will have to be enforced. In addition, the NKVD will likely have to be deployed to many towns and villages across the region, if only to scare the locals into submission."

 TYM_only_truth_desc: "Comrade Kaganovich is a stern man, but a liar he is not. While he certainly has twisted the truth a little in the past, or presented alternative facts to a situation, he would never lie to the people of Russia! Some things simply don't need to be known by the public at large. State secrets or deceptive foreign lies that might paint Kaganovich in a bad light simply should not be shown or discussed to the people. While, behind closed doors, many whisper that they fear Kaganovich and his NKVD, most of those unexposed to foreign lies have a good opinion of our beloved leader."

 TYM_and_only_what_they_need_to_know_desc: "No one can be trusted. The most harmless in society can develop into vicious political manipulators, agitators, dissidents, and other enemies of the state. Every worker, every soldier, every mother, every NKVD agent; every single individual is a pair of eyes and ears that could be used against the state. If Comrade Kaganovich's vision for a restored Soviet Union are to be accomplished, the eyes of the people must be closed and their ears be covered to all information except what they need to know.\n\nThe bureaucracy shall be greatly expanded, to the point that access to information is virtually impossible. Army officers and party officials shall only be given the minimum amount of information to achieve their tasks. The only person who knows the true extent and goings-on of the new Soviet Union shall be Comrade Kaganovich and a very few select individuals. Information shall be the enemy of the people, and the ally of the state."

 TYM_a_job_left_unfinished_desc: "Despite all the work that Comrade Kaganovich has put into the internal security of the state, some individuals simply cannot be convinced to abandon their wretched ideologies. The people have already been exposed to dangerous, subversive beliefs, and must be silenced. They number in the thousands and make up a significant portion of the political bureaucracy, the military, and even the secret police. Now, all these disparate enemies of the revolution shall be purged-- something that should have been done a long time ago.\n\nNKVD agents who are known to be loyal will seek out and question individuals who have shown unpatriotic or subversive activities in the past. The men will be interrogated, put on show trial, and either executed or sent to toil away in a Siberian labor camp. For too long have they gone unchecked in Soviet society, but with Comrade Kaganovich as our leader, their allotted time has expired."

 TYM_new_talented_officers_desc: "The Great Purge, as it is now being called, is finally over. The last known enemies of the state have been carted off to Siberia, or put into the ground. However, the purge destroyed a significant portion of the officer corps. Thousands of military units, mostly at the platoon level, lack leadership. Without officers to lead them, our once-strong military will dissolve into madness and stupidity at the first sight of combat. To alleviate this issue, a new corps of officers will be trained from existing veterans. These men are experienced and battle-hardened, but simply lack the education in modern tactics and combined-arms operations that are necessary for the making of an effective officer. It will take some time, but these men can be trained and educated into extremely effective combat leaders."

 TYM_man_of_steel_desc: "Kaganovich has finally become the man he has always looked up to and emulated: Joseph Stalin, the man of steel. This is not only a want of Comrade Kaganovich; it is a need. Russia, and the restored Soviet Union, will need a stern, unfeeling leader if it is ever to reclaim her lost glory. Thus, Comrade Kaganovich shall preside over the revolution with a heart of steel. He shall not love his possessions, he shall not love his children, he shall not even love his people, but he shall love Russia."

 TYM_the_new_institutions_desc: "With his new position in the government secure, Chairman Khrushchev is ready to take the first steps to reform the West Russian People's Republic. New offices and administrations will spring up like flowers under his watchful care. Their administrators and directors will be hand picked to ensure his vision is realized. Though no large scale reforms will be enacted yet, these new institutions will lay the groundwork for lasting political change.\n\nWe shall not hold society back, for if the nation and the revolution to progress we must have our society progress as one, no more shall minorities fear, for we are all one."

 TYM_uphold_progressive_values_desc: "As stated by Marx and reiterated by innumerable socialist thinkers around the world, neither race, nor gender, nor national boundaries divide us. Rather, it is class that divides all humans. In accordance to this fact, we will promote cooperation between all peoples in order to bring about the end of capitalism.\n\nRacism, sexism, all forms of discrimination are reactionary -- we must eliminate them if we wish to bring about a communist society!"

 TYM_establish_the_assrs_desc: "The new Soviet Union we are building must not be mired down by ineffective, bloated bureaucracy. In order to govern the nation effectively, we will establish the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics along ethnic lines which will practice a form of self-government within the larger Soviet Union. The leaders of these new republics will, of course, be handpicked by Chairman Khrushchev.\n\nWe shall build the state as one to make even Stalin himself proud, for he is the one who guides us."

 TYM_a_state_to_make_stalin_proud_desc: "Comrade Stalin was an unappreciated visionary of his time. He would have wept if he knew that history had proved him right. Chairman Khrushchev has taken Stalin's theory to heart and has applied them to great success. Even in death, his words still shine as the light that will lead the Russian people towards a more perfect socialism!"

 TYM_out_with_the_old_desc: "The world has changed. We must change with it. Comrade Kaganovich's policies, while indisputably effective, are no longer suited for this day and age. As such, Chairman Khrushchev will begin a campaign to root out Kaganovich's influence from within the government. Officials will be purged, laws rewritten and repealed, and the damage from Kaganovich's premiership will be mended.\n\nWhile some may protest these measures, they are ultimately necessary if socialism is to survive in these trying times."

 TYM_the_secret_speech_desc: "There is no doubt that former Chairman Kaganovich's policies and beliefs were in betrayal of Stalinism, socialism, and the Soviet Union. Even so, dissidents and sympathizers still remain in the party. They say that we are the true revisionists, and that by purging Kaganovich, we have betrayed the cause.\n\nWe will prove them wrong.\n\nDuring the next party meeting, Chairman Khrushchev will speak to a closed audience and reveal to all the true extent of Kaganovich's crimes against the people. There, we will also reveal our agenda to help mend the damage caused by him and his ilk."

 TYM_lock_down_the_party_desc: "The Communist Party, especially in its current state, simply cannot be trusted to properly safeguard socialism and the proletariat. Recognizing this fact, Chairman Khrushchev will put a moratorium on elections to the Party. By doing so, he will be able to take total control of the government. This is necessary, as he is the only man capable of defending the people against the dangers of reactionarism. With the power that comes with total control, Khrushchev will be able to better execute Stalin's vision for a great Russia."

 TYM_another_five_year_plan_desc: "The original five year plan has reached its completion. Given its resounding success, Chairman Khrushchev has seen fit to announce a new, second five year plan. The people of Russia will work and toil in a glorious effort to continue industrialization on a greater scale than ever before and bring the country one step closer to true industrial socialism.\n\nIts time that we reintigrate our Western lands, we are all Russians."

 TYM_reintegrate_the_west_desc: "The German fascists might have destroyed Russia, but they could never destroy the Soviet spirit. Together, we will rebuild the nation under the red banner of the Soviet Union. Nothing will stop the people in their drive to reunite the homeland!"

 TYM_continue_agricultural_mechanization_desc: "For thousands of years, agriculture has sustained humanity and strengthened all nations of the world. In order to ensure we reap all possible benefits from agriculture, we shall fully mechanize it and educate the farmers on how to keep the soil fertile. In time, the literal fruits of our labor will show, in the bounty of food that our people can then harvest and enjoy."

 TYM_repudiate_literary_policy_desc: "The old literary policy is contradictory to the ideals of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. The purpose of books is to uplift the proletariat, rather than keep them down. As such, Chairman Khrushchev will lift Kaganovich's repression on books and other such artistic expressions. The proletarians of Russia shall become the most cultured in the world!"

 TYM_an_end_to_extraneous_repression_desc: "The Red Army is our sword and shield, and the defender of the proletariat. It would not only be unwise, but it would be an injustice to punish them for such bravery in battle. The Army and its personnel should serve the Union out of respect and love for the Chairman, not out of fear for him. To this end, we will put an end to any and all repression within the army." 

 TYM_commence_the_khrushchevshchina_desc: "Russia has progressed far beyond its image of poverty and backwardness. Factories hum with the sound of machinery, as men and women work together as one to better Russia. Tractors make their rounds around the fields of wheat, to be sent to the cities to make bread for the workers. Yet Russia's culture remains firmly entrenched in feudalist reactionarism. As such, a wave of cultural reforms will be enacted by Chairman Khrushchev in order to rectify this issue. The vestiges of the old world must be eliminated for a truly socialist society to take hold."

 TYM_shining_in_glory_desc: "Russia has risen from the ashes, as a beacon of socialism amongst a world of exploitation and tyranny. Our resurgence will not end here, for we march to liberate the workers of the world. We have defeated the fascist Germans with even less than what we have now; with the resources of today, we are a world power. And unlike the others, we will use our status to advance the global proletarian cause."


 ### Events ###
 TYM.1.t: "The Ghost of Stalin"
 TYM.1.d: "Long live the Communist Party of Lenin-Stalin! Long live General Secretary of the West Siberian Communist Party Comrade Lazar Kaganovich! Long live the people of Russia, the cause of the people, and the Red Army who keeps us safe!\n\nDeath to the Black League in Omsk who have betrayed the revolution and will bring ruin to all of Russia! Death to the madman Karbyshev who leads them and wishes to plunge our once glorious nation into darkness! Death to the traitors of the Red Army in Sverdlovsk, who have threatened to destroy our glorious military and threaten to destroy our glorious nation! And death to the treacherous 'Field Marshal' Rokossovsky who leads this revolt against the glory of Comrade Kaganovich!\n\nWhen the traitor Bukharin assigned Comrade Kaganovich to Western Siberia, he did not realize that he would be setting the path for his own demise. When he showed his true colors and failed to stop the hated German scum from destroying our beautiful nation, Comrade Kaganovich led a glorious civil war against Bukharin in the name of his former comrade, Josef Stalin. While the Union fell, Kaganovich never ended his cause, and formed the great People's Republic of Western Siberia.\n\nTime did not prove our ally however, as the traitors in Omsk and Sverdlovsk betrayed the revolution and launched a surprise attack on the capital of Tyumen. While we bravely held out and stopped these attacks, the People's Republic now lies dead. With the German bombings still pummeling what little we have to dust, this situation has now lasted for over a year. Soon, however, we will find a way to bring justice to these traitors, and restore the Union for the glory of Comrade Kaganovich! And Comrade Stalin! And Comrade Lenin! For the people! Ura!"
 TYM.1.a: "Ura!"
 
 TYM.2.t: "A Tale of East vs West"
 TYM.2.d: "While Lazar Kaganovich has focused most of the reunited Soviet Union to the nation's first 'Five Year Plan', he has set aside several of the rising nation's intelligentsia for a different task.\n\nToday, 'A Tale of East vs West', has released internationally. Commissioned by Kaganovich, based off his personal writings, and sent abroad with hopes that its observation into an alternate history where Kaganovich's idol, Joseph Stalin, won his power struggles against Nikolai Bukharin would gain it legitimacy. The book was even touted pre-release as as the 'first piece of Russian literature in half a century' by the New York Times.\n\nSadly, however, for the Kaganovich regime, the book has been critically panned everywhere but the Soviet Union itself where reading of it has become mandatory in several state schools. Critics and historians both point out the unrealism of its plot and the ridiculous stretches of historical plausibility. The tale involves things such as Stalin not only managing to destroy Nazi Germany but reach as far as Berlin, forming a 'Budapest Pact' to counter a western led 'North Atlantic Treaty Coalition', an Israeli home state formed by the British (who manage to retain most of their Empire but slowly withdraw along with most other European powers due to rising tides of African nationalism) and a Soviet Union that lasts, 'until at least the 80s, during which Stalinism and the free market will begin their final confrontation, and if Stalinism loses, Russia will still follow its legacy and regain its strength in the new millennium with an invasion of Ukraine.'\n\nHow such rubbish even got published is anyone's guess."
 TYM.2.a: "But what happened to Trotsky!?"

 TYM.3.t: "The Burden We Bear"
 TYM.3.d: "Comrade! There is no denying that things are hard. The Soviet Union was great, but treason, fascism, and revisionism have whittled it down to a husk of its former self. Nevertheless, we are the true successors, untainted by Bukharinism or any other deviation from the path of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. The traitors can slander us, subvert us, bomb us, and murder us. They cannot murder the righteous spirit of the working class.\n\nComrade! Be reassured by the fact that the Communist Party has made many sacrifices in your name. Chairman Kaganovich works day and night striving to protect you from Nazism and warlordism. The Red Army, stalwart as ever, stands vigilant against the bandits who would harm you. The finest government in Russia makes the hardest decisions so that you can live without fear.\n\nComrade! If you feel discouraged, remember this: all of our hardships, all of our enemies have carved us into a point sharper than a bayonet. As we pierce through our adversaries, ask yourself a vital question. How can you serve?"
 TYM.3.a: "By devoting every fiber of my being to the Communist cause!"

 TYM.4.t: "Bunkers in the Distance"
 TYM.4.d: "A plume of smoke exited Private Stanislav Kharitonov's lungs as he gazed out from the top of the hill. It was the crack of dawn, earlier even than the hour he was roughly shaken out of bed most days. What could be done? He was on watch, and his duty was to watch. The Red Army tolerated few things less than insubordination. At least he could smoke.\n\nHe took an appreciative drag on his cigarette and let his eyes to pull him to something interesting. His vision settled on the bomb shelters placidly sitting in the distance, awaiting their purpose. It might have been the hour of day, but he was feeling contemplative. He had never quite appreciated how much of an achievement they were. After all they had faced, the collapse of the Union, the treason from within the general corps, the collapse, the West Siberian People's Republic endured, at least in Tyumen. No amount of bombs or bullets could keep the soldiers of the proletariat from taking back what was rightfully theirs.\n\nSure, the army was strict. To Stanislav and thousands like him, that was nothing compared to the losses they had already suffered."
 TYM.4.a: "The Red Army stands."

 TYM.5.t: "Sanctioned Salvaging Expeditions"
 TYM.5.d: "The collapsing Soviet Union left behind a huge number of settlements, supply caches, factories, and other structures that its successor statelets never had the budget or ability to reclaim. The WSPR's recent turmoil has delayed our ability to organize large-scale expeditions.\n\nEven with these circumstances, the workers win small victories! We have located several salvageable sites in the vicinity of Tyumen. The first is a large store of fuel left behind from an armor division that never deployed. The second is a stash of military equipment abandoned after mass desertions. Least important for the war effort but potentially valuable for morale is a warehouse of food, clothes, and other civilian amenities.\n\nAt the moment, we only have the resources for one. In our state of total mobilization, fuel or arms would be invaluable, but there is also a question of how much the people can bear."
 TYM.5.a: "We must not harden our hearts. Choose the amenities."
 TYM.5.b: "A bigger gun, a longer life. Choose the arms."
 TYM.5.c: "Our army needs to last. Choose the fuel."

 TYM.6.t: "Emergency Measures"
 TYM.6.d: "Every bomb that drops is another choice we must make. Who do we protect? Try as we might, there simply aren't enough bunkers in Tyumen to make sure everyone is safe. As with anything, there are trade-offs. Each soldier that survives is one that can contribute to the war effort. Many of our brass convincingly argue that we must prioritize the men who can drag us out of this miserable state.\n\nAnd yet, Chairman Kaganovich hesitates. What good are soldiers if they cower while the people they should be protecting are defenseless? The present crisis will pass, but the next generation will remember our sins. Civilian morale, already tenuous, may not survive the abandonment of women and children to the Luftwaffe's predations. Important voices of the administration believe that we must defend our most vulnerable so as not to lose sight of the morals that drive us.\n\nThe bombers will not wait for us to make decisions. Better to save one group now than to deliberate and lose both."
 TYM.6.a: "How can we speak for the workers if we don't defend them?"
 TYM.6.b: "We can mourn the civilians when we have taken Moscow."

 TYM.7.t: "Under the Earth"
 TYM.7.d: "Waiting in the hall outside of the local party secretary's office, Igor could feel his hands trembling. By God! If only the workers had delegated a different foreman to make the report. He rehearsed the statement in his head.\n\n"Comrade Secretary, some of the men have concerns about the safety of these bunker construction plans. They feel as though the plans, as written, would produce structures at an intolerable risk of collapse. Of course, this is not to say that you, Comrade Kaganovich, or the Communist Party have done even a single thing to jeopardize the safety of the people of Tyumen. If it could be that the plans have been sabotaged by counter-revolutionaries, or incompetence among the workers, I would completely accept responsibility."\n\nA few more minutes of waiting and rehearsing went by before the door finally opened, and the secretary, a short, bored-looking Armenian, emerged from his office. Despite his efforts, Igor's statement came out in a nervous torrent, but the secretary shushed him before he could even get to the mandatory praise of Kaganovich.\n\n"Yes, yes, safety concerns. I'll let my superiors know."\n\nAs the man closed the door, Igor felt relief wash over him in a wave. All that was left to do was hope that the message would climb the chain of phone calls to Kaganovich himself, and that the famously stubborn leader of Tyumen would heed it."
 TYM.7.a: "Who are we, if we cannot keep the people safe?"
 TYM.7.b: "We must prioritize efficiency over all - to house everyone."

 TYM.8.t: "Hidden Away"
 TYM.8.d: "Nursing a cup of coffee at his desk, Lazar Kaganovich yawned deeply. A brief glance at the clock told him that it was nearly midnight, meaning that he had been in his office reading reports and authorizing various state functions all day. Rebuilding a nation was hard work! And yet there was plenty left to do before he could retire for the night. Just then, an aide, evidently also quite tired, entered the room. Kaganovich's aides were expected to keep the same schedule he did, and few had "Iron Lazar's" endurance.\n\n"I have another report for you, sir, concerning the state of our industrial development."\n\nThe Chairman made a brief grunt of acknowledgement before dismissing him and shifted in his seat to read the document. It had something to do with increasing production, like so many of the other communiques he had read that day. His eyelids sunk before he caught himself in the act. He really was exhausted, he thought to himself. He continued reading. The document, in very dry, bureaucratic language, enumerated the possibility of reducing the production of consumer goods to hasten that of heavy machinery. It reflected briefly on the effects on civilians before dismissing the concern. They had already put up with so much for the sake of the nation, why not just a bit more?\n\nThe idea of retiring to his quarters now and leaving the matter until morning floated into his mind before he pushed it aside. The Soviet Union had no use for a leader who couldn't discipline himself. He pondered for a few more minutes before, as he had done many times before, taking out a pen and writing his decision on the document."
 TYM.8.a: "Do it. They will enjoy luxuries later."
 TYM.8.b: "The people deserve their small victories."

 TYM.9.t: "Our Program Yields Results"
 TYM.9.d: "As always with Chairman Kaganovich, his proposals to monitor the schedule of German terror-bombers has been an excellent success. The people, well alerted of potential attacks, have never been safer, and supply lines are moving better than ever. We cannot allow ourselves to be complacent; the Communist Party does not settle for adequacy, but strives to achieve perfection! We may have figured out their schedule for now, but the Germans can always change it once they realize our ingenuity. It is for this reason that a more permanent solution to the bombings needs to be put in place.\n\nOne potential option is to use our knowledge of their movements to go on the attack, delivering the people a badly needed blow against the fascists, so that they think twice before menacing them again. This solution would involve building fighter planes to intercept the bombers mid-air, using the element of surprise to overcome the technology gap. Fascists are inherently cowardly, and the Luftwaffe is not accustomed to resistance; a decisive strike could scare them away from our airspace in favor of weaker targets.\n\nThe next solution is more cautious, but with the potential of dealing with the problem for longer. Radar towers proved quite effective in prior wars, and their ability to remotely monitor aircraft would negate the need for detailed bombing schedules in the future, since we could react to bombers as we detect them. This type of response, while not directly challenging the bombers, could severely curtail their efforts in the future.\n\nThe Germans, brutish though they are, are not stupid. Whichever operation we choose will need to be flexible and highly responsive in order to ensure it is not bypassed completely by a change in the Luftwaffe's tactics."
 TYM.9.a: "Focus on detecting the enemies."
 TYM.9.b: "Focus on making interception viable."

 TYM.10.t: "Mikhail's Proposals"
 TYM.10.d: "It might be thought that a man like Lazar Kaganovich, who made exceptionally harsh demands of others, would do so out of personal laziness. The opposite was true. Kaganovich was a workhorse. He could usually be found at his office desk, surrounded by a dense cloud of cigar smoke as he pored over documents, breaking up the monotony with the occasional shouted phone call. It was in this state that Mikhail, his brother and economic minister, found him as he prepared to deliver a stack of papers.\n\nMikhail stood in the doorway, coughing as the smoke invaded his lungs. Although Lazar was actually the younger sibling, he couldn't help but feel intimidated, but Mikhail buried his feelings. They were brothers, after all, and this was important. He waited for Lazar to acknowledge his presence, but the Chairman's work continued unabated, either because he didn't hear Mikhail or because he didn't care. Mikhail cleared his throat.\n\n"I have some proposals I'd like you to read when you have the time."\n\n"Hm? Oh, yes, of course," Lazar replied unconvincingly, his attention clearly drawn to the already impressive pile on his desk. Seeing that his brother was still standing there, he spoke again, clearly irritated. "Do you have any other concerns? I'd like to get back to work, if you don't mind."\n\nMikhail awkwardly took his leave. Although he would rather put faith in his brother, he knew instinctively that his stack of proposals would go unread for a good while longer."
 TYM.10.a: "Not the rosiest relationship."

 TYM.11.t: "The Patterns Shift"
 TYM.11.d: "Lazar Kaganovich was frustrated. The German bombing schedule, which had remained relatively consistent for years, had changed. It was not a large change - in truth things would not be too difficult to adjust and continue on the course they had been up to this point. However, on his desk sat a proposal, a proposal put forward by Mikhail to adjust the urban defenses in order to make up for the change.\n\nOn the one hand, simply continuing construction of bunkers would make any changes in the schedule moot. On the other, adapting to the new schedule for the defense of the above ground infrastructure would be better in the short term for the people and morale in general.\n\nNo matter what option was chosen, it would be a huge investment. The bunkers would provide a complete defense against the bombs, and if the bombing ever ended they would be useful for defending infrastructure against the other warlords of Russia. But at the same time, keeping the defenses flexible would allow for a quicker response to changes in the bombing.\n\nIndeed, both ideas had their promise but only one could be followed in the end, the question was, which one?"
 TYM.11.a: "Utilize Mikhail's program to adapt."
 TYM.11.b: "We will utilize the Chairman's program."
 
 TYM.12.t: "Feeding the Underground"
 TYM.12.d: "Deep under the streets of the People's Republic, teams of men swung their picks and shovels to clear tunnels for the newest metro tunnel in the Republic. Vladislav Shapovalov swung his pick and split a section of stone. His crew were to finish the last section of the tunnel so other crews could come in to lay the track. It was back breaking work, and it never seemed to be enough, but it was work and that is more than he had had in years.\n\nVlad found that, despite the danger, he found a degree of fulfillment in his work. The threat of tunnel collapse was a near constant in the new excavations, before the supports were put in. He had lost a lot of friends to collapses, most recently Lev, but even then the work was worth it. It was drilled into their heads often enough how important this line was, the safety of their families relied on the tunnels. This tunnel in particular was integral to ensuring that the factories were unaffected by the bombs, and safe factories meant better lives for their families.\n\nVlad could hear the machinery running on the other side of the rock now. He knew it would only be a matter of hours before the tunnel was ready for further construction. As he swung his pick, Vlad heard the characteristic rumbling that came before a cave-in. He shouted "Cave-in!" and directed his men to the safe section further back the way they had come. He was the last one back before the roof gave way and the passage was sealed by meters of rock."
 TYM.12.a: "This will come in handy later."

 TYM.13.t: "A Final Triumph"
 TYM.13.d: "Lazar Kaganovich was ecstatic. The programs he had put his being into had been a smashing success. The perfidious Germans and their bombs had plagued the people of the People's Republic for so long that they had used the bombings as an alarm of sorts. It would take much getting used to, as the old status quo would be swept away in a new age of prosperity.\n\nHowever, with the success of the programs, the bombers that were once the dread of every citizen of Russia were now an afterthought. The people of Tyumen lived their lives in the most carefree way they had in years. For the first time, the threat of sudden death was practically gone from the lives of the Russian people.\n\nLazar led a small toast in his office, his inner circle around him, to his successes. The policies that had been spearheaded by Kaganovich were ingenious, Under his benevolent guidance the Germans had been rendered impotent to harm them. Under his guidance, the People's Republic would take its rightful place in the world, and he would take his rightful place in the stewardship of Russia."
 TYM.13.a: "The Germans are impotent."

 TYM.14.t: "Passed Over!"
 TYM.14.d: "Rage. All he knew was rage. Lazar Kaganovich was pissed. After all the work and sacrifices that he put into protecting the people of the People's Republic he expected those people to recognize his efforts --to give him the recognition he was due.\n\nThat bastard Mikhail is taking credit for his work, the sheer scale of his efforts ignored in favor of his preaning egotist of a brother. He had worked too hard to be passed over like this, poured too much of himself into these projects, to save the people of Russia from the predations of the German dogs. Yet here he was, being ignored and scorned for his part in making Tyumen run like a well oiled machine.\n\nLazar seethed in his rage, simmering and stewing in his hate. The bastard had done nothing for the people that now practically cheered his name from the rooftops. How could this have happened? Didn't the people understand how much he had worked for their safety? How he had sacrificed so they would not have to? How could they do this?"
 TYM.14.a: "This is absurd!"

 TYM.15.t: "Escalate the Repopulation Program?"
 TYM.15.d: "It's a tragic piece of public knowledge that our population is suffering after decades of foreign and civil wars. For years, German planes have flown over our skies and targeted our people, killing soldiers and civilians, men, women and children indiscriminately. While it has undoubtedly caused a large degree of suffering throughout our lands, most terribly what this anarchy has done is cut down on our already-small population numbers through bombing attrition, bandit raids, and acts of god.\n\nA number of different solutions have been drafted to the so-called "repopulation problem", though one, above all, stands out. Women have, for some time, worked alongside men in certain roles that are fitting to them. This was done initially out of necessity, but as things are on their way to normalization, the added productivity that women bring to the workplace in terms of an extra set of hands is worth mentioning. On the other hand, however, it is the nature of women to bear children. If they're working, they can't bear children and vice-versa.\n\nIf we were to limit once more women's opportunity for work and work advancement until they have sired a requisite number of children, it would simultaneously encourage women to have children while not outright banning them from the workplace like some reactionary stooges may encourage. Certainly, we may see a drop in productivity as some women leave to bear children if we do opt to escalate this program, but we will see a noticeable increase in our birth rates.\n\nUltimately, the decision rests with the chairman."
 TYM.15.a: "No. We must make a stand for our sisters."
 TYM.15.b: "Do it. The future of Russia depends on us."

 TYM.16.t: "Revolutionary Crèches"
 TYM.16.d: "One of the more significant aspects of our repopulation program was the establishment of the so-called revolutionary creches, a network of civil organizations dedicated to the rearing and caring of children. These creches, under the watchful eye of the party, have also integrated a number of different education programs for both the children and the women who tend to them, creating a nest of future ideologues and Soviet zealots.\n\nHowever, a question has been raised regarding the specific administration of the creches. Their rapid success has caused a number of interest groups to lobby for control over them, with many seeing the creches as a path to success and importance in the future. Ultimately, Kaganovich and his closest advisors have convened to decide a way forward and announce who will have the ultimate control over these child rearing organizations. After what has seemed to be hours of deliberation, the group has narrowed the candidacy for control over the creches down to two potential prospects: the local communes and the military.\n\nThe local communes, if they had control over the creches, would ensure that children will be raised within their own communities, and be instilled with not only a sense of community importance and familial unity, but also receive the fair and necessary civilian education that should be available to every young man. On the other hand, if the military was to control the creches, they would end up much more centralized, growing up with a greater sense of identity than to their own community. On top of this, of course, the military would be interested, just as we would be, in raising a future generation of soldiers, raised literally from birth to fight and die for the Union.\n\nAs the night grew late, Kaganovich's advisory council waited with bated breath on his final decision..."
 TYM.16.a: "The military will administrate them."
 TYM.16.b: "Let each commune decide, within reason."

 TYM.17.t: "Rebuilding the Red Army"
 TYM.17.d: "Valeriy Konstaninovich Zima breathed the chilly, Siberian air. The officer in Kaganovich's army had known little more than bunkers and bombing drills for the past few years, and despite the fact that the wintery bite of the cold morning seemed to pierce him to the bone, he could barely feel it - the fresh air felt too good on his face and in his lungs. The long-time Soviet soldier looked over what he jokingly referred to his peers as his "flock", a rag-tag group of conscripts that were drawn from all sectors of society. There was Shvets, who came from a poor migrant family - his nose had been broken too many times and his slender frame and short stature betrayed his family's poverty and his malnourishment. Filippov, the son of a disgraced intellectual, who carried with him an air of undeserved snobbishness, and Vinogradov, whose plumpish frame told volumes about his background as the fourth son of a party official.\n\nThese three were but a few familiar faces in a crowd well over a dozen. Despite Zima's long service, he remained on a maddeningly low rung of the Republic's command structure. Zima watched over his troops attempting to form up and sighed, noticing the glaring flaws that his soldiers likely didn't even know were issues. There was a lot of work to do, Zima thought to himself. But as one soldier nearly bumped into another, Zima pushed his stress out of his mind and took another deep breath of fresh air - bunker air was the worst, he reminded himself.\n\nAs he exhaled, a sense of pride - something he had not felt in a long, long time - welled up within his chest. "Comrades!" he barked, pride overflowing from his body towards his charges. "It's time we learned the basics!""
 TYM.17.a: ""We'll start with the march.""

 TYM.18.t: "Rolling On"
 TYM.18.d: ""Comrade Krevchenko, let's get this old girl running again shall we?"\n\nCaptain Yevgenovich opened the commander's hatch to peek out while Krevchenko, his driver, got to work. With a loud grunt from the engine, the old T-54 roared to life for the first time in several years. The memories of past battles and adventures came flooding back almost instantly to the Captain, who had always felt right at home sitting in a tank with his comrades. Now that the skies were clear, the Red Army could put their armor to work again. Leaning back down into the tank's interior, Captain Yevgenovich gave his driver a light shove with his foot to grab his attention.\n\n"Alright comrade, let's shake off the rust. Take us out of the warehouse, nice and easy." Krevchenko gave a nod in response, and Yevgenovich went back to his previous position. With yet another loud rev of the engine and a sharp movement that caused the Captain to jolt, the T-54 began to creep forward. Rolling out of the warehouse and into the sunlight of the outside, Captain Yevgenovich felt more powerful than ever before.\n\nThe tank may have been rather antiquated, but it worked like it was brand new. Several other soldiers had been standing around outside the warehouse, and they could not help but stare as the armored beast and its triumphant commander emerged. Younger recruits like them would likely have never seen a fully operational tank in action before, and the Captain knew that the sight must have been something to behold. The emboldened Yevgenovich now had a cheery look about him, giving an occasional wave to those who had come to observe. Finally, the old tanker was back where he belonged."
 TYM.18.a: "Roll on, comrades!"

 TYM.19.t: "The Trials"
 TYM.19.d: ""Hey, Yuri, keep our speed up when we come up on that ramp, don't even think about slowing down. I want to see if we can make this thing fly!" Yuri heard his commander, who was shouting to get his voice across the incredibly loud interior of the tank, but did not turn to face him. To take his eyes off the course would be to invite disaster.\n\n"Are you sure that's wise, comrade?! The shock could kill all of us!"\n\n"We're in a tank, you fool! We'll be fine! Maintain our speed, Yuri!" As Yuri made a turn, the incline finally came into view. Against his better judgement, he decided to oblige with his commander's order. From the sidelines, the observing officers grew slightly concerned when the T-54 approaching the natural ramp did not slow down like usual.\n\nThe tank came to the slope, and as Yuri had feared the speed at which he was going caused the tank to soar through the air, if only for a second. The observers, meanwhile, watched in excitement and a little horror as the tank violently tumbled over the ramp. The impact could be heard over the engines of the other tanks navigating the obstacle course. After the tank had reacquainted itself with the ground, it remained completely still.\n\nFollowing a few tense moments, the tank resumed its relentless journey around the course, with sporadic cheers and claps erupting across the sidelines. Some of the older officers scoffed at the reckless nature of the stunt, but even they couldn't help but admire the spirit of the new recruits."
 TYM.19.a: "They're certainly not lacking in enthusiasm."

 TYM.20.t: "Breakthrough Tactics"
 TYM.20.d: ""Salutations, fellow comrades of the Red Army armored corps. You've been gathered here today to be taught how to effectively use armored units to exploit breakthroughs on the field. I want you to start today's lesson by throwing out anything you currently know about waging war with armor. I'm going to be frank: times have changed since the wars against the fascists, and to rely on old tactics would be nigh-on suicidal!"\n\nThe armored officers that had made up the class meticulously took notes as the general spoke. The room was overwhelmed by the sound of pencils at work.\n\n"Going into today's battlefields without being aware of what dangers are in store would be a total disaster. Man-portable rocket systems and specialized munitions give the enemy tank-killing power like you wouldn't believe. You must learn how to adapt in order to survive, comrades.\n\nTaking my words to heart during our little class today will be the deciding factor between rolling on to glorious victory, or perishing in fiery doom. Make no mistake comrades, you will be worse than useless to the Red Army if you die and take your expensive tanks with you, so be sure to pay attention!"\n\nThe officers were still scratching away at their notebooks, glancing up every so often to give their teacher the indication that they were, indeed, listening."
 TYM.20.a: ""Now, any questions before we move on?""

 TYM.21.t: "Combat Performance Records"
 TYM.21.d: "Captain Makarov looked across the vast Siberian plains through his binoculars. He scanned the horizon slowly, giving consideration to every odd shape and possible smudge on the lens. Eventually, he discovered his target. He put the binoculars away and signaled the rest of his squad. It was time to move out. A group of tanks hummed across the flat earth.\n\nThe bandit camp fell with little resistance. The shoddy, temporary tents were easily crushed by 25 tons of Soviet engineering. The bandits themselves put up a weak defense with small arms before scrambling off in all directions. A few were captured. Not as many as Captain Makarov would've liked, but the mission was still an overall success. The bandits wouldn't be able to terrorize the local villages without their supplies.\n\nAs the sun set in front of them and the bandit camp smouldered behind them, Captain Makarov and his tank squadron made the journey back to home base, eager to begin their next mission. The hum of the tanks went with them."
 TYM.21.a: "Designed to destroy."
 
 TYM.22.t: "Marching On"
 TYM.22.d: "Sergeant Kuznetsov shuffled through the report in his hands. His men had done exceptionally well, near perfectly in fact, but they had still not met his expectations. He skimmed through the papers one more time before placing them on the table. He blew his whistle to assemble the troops.\n\nHis men were scattered under various tents, talking, playing cards, or doing nothing at all. Exhausted from the day long military exercise, the warm afternoon sun lulled their sore muscles and heavy eyes into an innocent half-slumber in which the grass was soft and the day's work was nearly over. The whistle cracked their naive reality and they soon assembled in several rigid rows, ready to receive the words of their commander.\n\n"You call this your best!?" Kuznetsov spat.\n\nSeveral of the soldiers twitched, but none of them averted their forward gaze.\n\n"Will you be this lazy the next time bandits attack a village!? Will you sit back, light a cigarette, and watch them butcher women and children?!" he screamed at the men. "Well? Answer me!"\n\n"No, sir!" came the unified response.\n\n"Then get back to your positions! We're doing the exercise all over again, and this time do it correctly!""
 TYM.22.a: ""Yes, sir!""

 TYM.23.t: "The Commissars Return"
 TYM.23.d: "Aleksey Ilin was the new guy. No one likes the new guy, least of all battle hardened Russian soldiers. Especially when the new guy is a political officer.\n\nAleksey plastered a friendly yet subtle smile across his face. He wanted them to like him. If they liked him they might end up trusting him. He held out his right hand to shake, his left arm holding his bag of clothes and personal effects by his side.\n\nThe captain he had been assigned to looked at Aleksey's hand as though there was a knife in it. He cautiously reached out to meet it and gave an uncomfortably short handshake.\n\n"Your bunk is right here." he said with a small cough. He gestured to the bottom bed of a bunk in the corner, far from any windows or other soldiers.\n\nAleksey nodded and walked calmly to his bed. He felt the eyes of his new comrades bore holes in his body as he passed by. He flashed each of them a smile and even waved to a couple. He arrived at his bunk and withdrew his various possessions including a small journal. As the men whispered and gossiped about him, Aleksey composed his first report on the morale of his company."
 TYM.23.a: "Integration went smoother than expected."

 TYM.24.t: "Heroes of Socialism"
 TYM.24.d: "Private Valeriya Osipova looked across the crowds of people. They were all cheering. Cheering for her. She strained her head, searching for her mother. Within a few seconds she found her, near the front, cheering louder than anyone else. Osipova smiled at her and returned her gaze forward, stoic and brave, like any hero should be.\n\nShe was in a city square on a platform with several high ranking party members and, most importantly, Chairman Kaganovich. The flags of the West Russian People's Republic and Soviet Union were hung behind them.\n\n"We are here today to honor Comrade Valeriya Osipova for her bravery in saving an entire family from a German attack." the Chairman began, speaking into a microphone that projected his voice across the square. "Comrade Osipova risked her own life to rescue a family of five after their farm was bombed. She crawled through the ruins, freed them from the burning wreckage, and was even able to resuscitate one of the children, who would have died had she not been present. For her valiant actions, I hereby award Comrade Osipova Hero of the People's Republic."\n\nKaganovich pinned a simple, yet striking medal to her chest before he began to clap. The party members and then the crowd followed and soon the entire square was clapping for Veleriya Osipova, Hero of the People's Republic."
 TYM.24.a: "Three cheers for Comrade Osipova!"

 TYM.25.t: "Reunification Day"
 TYM.25.d: "This afternoon, General Secretary Kaganovich announced the rebirth and reunification of the West Siberian People's Republic with a magnificent speech delivered to many thousands of assembled workers and Red Army soldiers in the city centre of Tyumen. "It is knowledge, not the gun, that is the most powerful weapon in the workers arsenal," the General Secretary said, "and armed with the immortal science of dialectical materialism, as understood by the genius mind of Stalin, the working class will one day relegate their bourgeois oppressors into the ash heap of history!"\n\nExtensive preparations for the reunification of West Siberia are underway, including the mobilization of the army, an increase in the annual draft and the increasing of arms production to defeat the liberal counter-revolutionaries who have carried off the workers' lands."
 TYM.25.a: "Onwards!"

 TYM.26.t: "Old Soldiers"
 TYM.26.d: ""...and in what way is Karbyshev's revanchism excessive?" barked Starshina Lebedev.\n\n"Sir, he places the nation above the class, sir!" the recruits cried out in unison.\n\nThat was the last of the questions for the day, Lebedev noted.\n\n"Excellent, ladies," he said, "It looks like you know your enemies well. Staff Sergeant Gusev will review your marksmanship in a few hours. You are dismissed for now."\n\nThe soldiers made their way out of the barracks room. Waiting until the last of them left, Andrei Lebedev took out a bottle of vodka from his friend and took a swig. Day in, day out, he was telling the new meat about the horrors of the Black League. About Omsk. About him. Andrei held back memories as Karbyshev's aide, hear the tips about leadership and tactics. The sunlight in his eyes the day he returned, still scarred and bloodied. He took another drink, trying to forget Karbyshev's long, rambling diatribes about the "Great Trial" and the "inherent strengths of the Russian people" and the day he denounced socialism, the revolution and the Communist party, declaring his Black League will stand for only vengeance and war.\n\nAndrei finished the bottle, his throat burning like his mind."
 TYM.26.a: "We all must make sacrifices for the revolution."

 TYM.27.t: "Tyumen Honors Our Efforts!"
 TYM.27.d: "Today we received some surprising news: Lazar Kaganovich, currently ruling out of Tyumen, has sent diplomats to inform us of the construction of a monument dedicated to the Night Witches. Tyumen wishes to unveil the monument to the public by awarding our leader, Yevdokia Bocharova, with Hero of the People's Republic.\n\nThis would certainly be quite the honor, and Kaganovich seems truly genuine, but Kaganovich is not perfect. He is a dictator, and his brand of communism is especially authoritarian. Accepting this offer could indebt us to a man who would see our freedoms revoked. Maybe his efforts would be better placed elsewhere..."
 TYM.27.a: "Thank our friends for their kind remarks."
 TYM.27.b: "We will not tolerate this brutal regime."

 TYM.28.t: "The Free Aviators Rebuke Us!"
 TYM.28.d: "Our diplomats returned empty-handed. Apparently, the Free Aviators did not want our gratitude, and say that our efforts are better placed elsewhere. Yevdokia Bocharova has declined the award, and will not be attending the unveiling of their monument.\n\nThis is outrageous! We simply wish to honor their efforts in protecting Russia from the Luftwaffe, and they act as if we insulted their honor! They even had the gall to call General-Secretary Kaganovich a tyrant, and say that they refuse to converse with someone who denies the people their freedoms."
 TYM.28.a: "How dare they?"

 TYM.29.t: "The Free Aviators Thank Us!"
 TYM.29.d: "The Free Aviators were kind enough to accept our gratitude, and Yevdokia Bocharova flew down to personally accept her award. The Free Aviators seem to have appreciated our kindness, and the award ceremony was chosen to be held in front of the Free Aviators' monument.\n\nThe ceremony went smoothly enough, with the weather being favorable and the temperature relatively comfortable for a day in Siberia. Yevdokia stepped up to the podium, gladly accepted the medal that General-Secretary Kaganovich placed around her neck, and gave a short speech thanking the people of Kaganovichgrad. The General-Secretary may have wished for Yevdokia to have thanked him as well in her speech, but he did not show his dissatisfaction. After her speech concluded, several pilots performed aerial maneuvers above the crowd, and the end of the ceremony was marked by a gun salute from the military."
 TYM.29.a: "The beginnings of a beautiful friendship!"

 TYM.30.t: "Reunification with Tyumen?"
 TYM.30.d: "Diplomats from Kaganovichgrad have arrived to meet with us. They have not come to tell us of the West Siberian People's Republic's gratitude or friendship, but rather, to present an offer.\n\nGeneral-Secretary Lazar Kaganovich wishes to offer the Free Aviators integration into the West Siberian People's Republic. Now that we border their state, they see no reason for us to remain isolated and alone. If we accept, they have promised that every pilot will receive military honors, and our civilian population will be rewarded for their dedication.\n\nThis is nothing short of complete integration - which must be considered carefully. Accepting would be the end of our independence - but it would also permanently resolve our resource shortages, and the civilian population would not need to sacrifice as much in order to maintain our planes.\n\nAt the same time, Kaganovich is not a changed man. He is a tyrant who accepts no deviance or challenge. To integrate would not just be the end of our independence - but our freedom as well.\n\nIs it better to live under a tyrant, or to die with our freedom intact? Surely if we refuse, Kaganovich's leniency will come to an end - and our pilots may end up shooting down Russian aircraft, rather than German. We are faced with a choice with no good answers. What shall be our answer?"
 TYM.30.a: "We shall serve the socialist revolution once more."
 TYM.30.b: "Kaganovich is a tyrant in hero's clothing, we refuse the offer."

 TYM.31.t: "The Air Force Returned"
 TYM.31.d: "The ambassador to Surgut has returned with excellent news: after weeks of negotiation, the Free Aviators have agreed to join our nation, using their airpower to protect the socialist revolution in Tyumen. As we speak, civilian personnel are being transported to their former capital and the new airbase of the People's Republic to be trained by the Aviators, and warplanes are being built in our factories to bolster this force of pilots. At last the working class have their own air force once more that will protect the poor and downtrodden of the earth from capitalist oppression!"
 TYM.31.a: "The wind will whisper when the Night Witches come!"
 
 TYM.32.t: "The Aviators Go Rogue!"
 TYM.32.d: "Negotiations in Surgut broke down this morning as representatives of the Free Aviators simply refused to accept our offers of aid and support from resources from Tyumen, calling General Secretary Kaganovich "a tyrant in hero's clothing", who "believes in nothing but his own power". Their ingratitude is shocking as it is unexplained, as we have done nothing but tried to work out an agreement that would benefit everyone in the long run.\n\nWhatever the reason they decided to antagonize us for, it is clear that their command of the air, as well as their newfound hostility towards us mark the Free Aviators as a menace to the safety of the revolution. An attack on Surgut would be difficult, but our generals predict that if we strike fast enough, we will be able to stop these upstarts before they threaten the working people of Tyumen itself."
 TYM.32.a: "Now where is my KS-19?"

 TYM.33.t: "Sedition in Our Ranks!"
 TYM.33.d: "A few cases of insubordination are to be expected. A couple hundred are a grave anomaly.\n\nThe frequency of treason, sedition, and desertion in the army has reached a concerning high and shows little sign of stopping its traitorous ascension. The average soldier has begun to ask big, important, and, most of all, dangerous questions. What are we fighting for? What should we fight for? What is to be done if the answers to the two previous questions are not the same?\n\nThe cause of our infantry's new found philosophical inclinations is none other than the socialist rabble rousers in Tyumen. Kaganovich wants to take our land and will face much less opposition from an army that thinks more than it shoots. His infiltrators and propagandists have worked their magic and we are left with a force in conflict with itself.\n\nAs much as can be done to limit the damage, has been. Traitors have been shot. Seditious officers have been made examples. Whether or not this is enough to resist the red tide remains to be seen."
 TYM.33.a: "Point and shoot - Nothing poetical about it."

 TYM.34.t: "The Republic Stands Once More!"
 TYM.34.d: "The breakaway states of Omsk and Sverdlovsk both formally issued their surrender, making the reunification of the West Siberian People's Republic official after several years of confusion.\n\n"The shattering of the People's Republic by counter-revolutionaries was one of the darkest chapters in the annals of socialism since the fascist invasion of 1941," Kaganovich said in a speech in the city centre of Tyumen commemorating the reunification, "But armed with Stalinist theory, the mind of the class-conscious proletarian was able to triumph against the guns of the bourgeoisie!"\n\nNumerous celebrations are being planned to commemorate the reunification of West Siberia, including a nation-wide holiday for the workers, military parades held in major cities, and free seminars at educational institutions about Stalinism."
 TYM.34.a: "The crimson banner shall fly again!"

 TYM.35.t: "Restoring Our Frontiers"
 TYM.35.d: "After the reunification of the West Siberian People's Republic, the national Presidium now turns its eyes on the reunification of the whole of West Siberia under the banner of Stalinism. In a speech before thousands in the Tyumen city centre, Lazar Kaganovich declared that "From Leningrad to Vladivostok, the bourgeoisie feel a great tremor beneath their feet. It is the boots of the workers as they march to war against their oppressors. Armed with knowledge of Stalinist theory and unstoppable in their fury, the tide of the downtrodden shall be unstoppable!"\n\nAlready the army has been mobilised at the frontiers of the Republic, ready to strike at its bourgeois neighbours. New units are being raised from groups of eager conscripts. Across the state, people are readying themselves to rebuild the Soviet Union."
 TYM.35.a: "Once more, to victory!"

 TYM.36.t: "Trading Convoys Arrested!"
 TYM.36.d: "In the last several weeks there have been disturbing reports from the border with Tyumen. In a violation of previously established trade agreements, armed patrols, openly flying the colors of the late West Russian People's Republic, have arrested our trade convoys without just cause.\n\nTheir official diplomats claim that the trade convoys lacked the proper permits, carried stolen goods, or committed acts of banditry, but we know these to be lies. It is clear that Kaganovich and his minions have set their sights on our piece of the Russian anarchy to sate their expansionist hunger. These illegal attacks on our convoys are a prelude to an all out invasion.\n\nFor now, however, we must wait. The reds seem content to harass our least valuable caravans. More valuable expeditions will be advised to avoid the border with Tyumen in the future. Relations may be rocky, and war may be on the horizon, but that's hardly a reason to suspend perfectly profitable business."
 TYM.36.a: "This violates our non-aggression protocol!"

 TYM.37.t: "Communist Agitation in Our Cities!"
 TYM.37.d: "Pamphlets with catchy, proactive, and illegal slogans dance in tandem with the wind across the streets. Posters covered in simple, visual representations of class struggle spring up on buildings faster than the authorities can tear them down. Groups gather in the dark, dead night and exchange ideas, books, and plans. Wildcat strikes cripple factories as workers, drunk on fantasies of equality, blindly lash out at the hand that feeds.\n\nThis is not a natural phenomenon. This is the work of agitators, traitors, and spies. They all come from the same place which investigations confirmed to be what everyone already knew: Tyumen.\n\nKaganovich, it seems, is not content to tyrannize his own portion of Russia and has decided to bring his red oppression down on our own citizens. What begins as a small, supposedly independent movement, will grow into a popular revolution that will greet Tyumen soldiers as liberators. This cannot be allowed to pass."
 TYM.37.a: "The only good communist..."

 TYM.38.t: "Restoration Day"
 TYM.38.d: "The West Siberian People's Republic is united once again! All across our glorious nation, you can hear the people singing, the trumpets blaring, our men parading through the streets of welcoming cities, who welcome not only their liberation but a new Russian prosperity. All of them call out the same thing: Glory to Russia and glory to Kaganovich, her liberator! A united West Siberia is only the first step to a united Russia, and we believe that under our leader we will undoubtedly succeed.\n\nToday, Kaganovich spoke in front of a massive crowd in Tyumen and to crowds across West Siberia through loudspeakers, proclaiming the liberation of West Siberia and the reunification of the West Siberian People's Republic. The people have won their greatest victory, he said to a jubilant audience, and now the people's vanguard is in full control of West Siberia under the guidance of the party and her leader Lazar Kaganovich. From West Siberia there is no clearer path than to Russia's liberation! The people's government is here!"
 TYM.38.a: "For the Union!"

 TYM.39.t: "Into the Future"
 TYM.39.d: "The reforms are complete! There has never been a time in Soviet history when the developed forces of a nation were this strong, and now all of fractured Russia trembles at our might. Now standing as the liberators of Russia's breadbasket, it is time we spread our revolution to the rest of the former Union to bring about new prosperity under the guiding hand of Kaganovich's reforms. We have succeeded in spreading our reforms throughout all of our People's Republic, and lands formerly owned by weak, reactionary warlords now are under the rightful command of Russia; her people, strong and united.\n\nThose who opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat have been dealt with as needed, the people work fervently for reunification, and now towns that were once insignificant dots on a map are industrial centers where steel turns into the tools of the people! From our new sturdy industrial base in West Siberia, the path to Russia's reunification is clear: first the petty, squabbling Urals, and then West Russia, where resistance to the path of the revolution will be stronger than ever. Comrades, forward! For the Motherland, for Kaganovich!"
 TYM.39.a: "Ura!"

 TYM.40.t: "The Continuation of the Five Year Plan"
 TYM.40.d: "It was a skeleton of metal and wood at first. Wispy beams and fragile supports stuck out at odd angles, prompting curious looks from the citizenry. Children played in its rafters and dared each other to jump the gaps of the third floor.\n\nSlowly, however, the construct was assembled, piece by piece. One day, workers entered; Men and a few women, dressed in simple, pristine jumpsuits, took their positions in preparation for their first day on the job.\n\nThen the factory roared.\n\nAcross the West Siberian People's Republic, the industrialization effort yields victory after victory. The people have jobs. The stores have goods. The productive forces are developed. The barren Siberian wasteland, once composed of a few cottage industries and farms, is resurrected by the blazing fires of production.\n\nThrough the efforts of the people, the Party, and, of course, Comrade [TYM.GetLeader], the Revolution is advanced, and yet, as planners and architects scurry through state offices, as mechanical beasts vomit progress into the air, as workers tear and sully their new jumpsuits, this is only the beginning."
 TYM.40.a: "No one can withstand the might of progress!"

 TYM.41.t: "Lessons from the Past"
 TYM.41.d: "Marshal Ivan Konev inspected faded battleplans in the near darkness of a military archive. A single candle accompanied him. His hands traced the unfortunately inadequate tactics of commanders twenty years dead. Visualizations of the battles occurred over and over in his head, always reaching an identical conclusion: failure.\n\nWith decades of hindsight, it was simple to identify the mistakes of his comrades as well as himself. A division there. Reroute supplies here. Hold that point. The mental wars turned like an hourglass. Eventually, the sand ran out and Konev was left with a victory.\n\n"What could have been?" he thought. Then he shook his head. It was no use to dwell on alternate possibilities when an all too real war awaited him. The Russian traitors and German fascists wouldn't give him the luxury of knowing their moves before they made them.\n\nKonev's eyelids felt heavy. It was very late and it had become difficult to focus on the splotched ink and ambiguous handwriting. He gave a last look at the ancient tactics. They had failed once, but never again. This time, they must succeed. He reached for the candle and starved it of air with his forefinger and thumb, flooding the room with a thick darkness."

 TYM.42.t: "The Spectre"
 TYM.42.d: "A spectre is haunting Russia. The German Luftwaffe could not eradicate it. A holy alliance of fascists, reactionaries, and capitalists could not exorcise it. It cannot be undone by men of flesh nor machines of steel.\n\nThe spectre has begun to look far beyond our artificial borders. It trawls the dark continent of Europe, evading German police-spies and SS officers. It slithers among Asian rice fields where indigenous workers slave for Japanese corporations. It crawls through Africa, inspiring dreams of a free continent. It flies above South American jungles and watches for the tendrils of imperialism. It hides in the union halls and factories of North America, subverting the greatest fortress of capital. The spectre is haunting the world, and the world is terrified indeed.\n\nOur state is but a wisp of the spectre, acting as a single soldier in a global class war. Its role cannot be overstated, however. As an example to the international proletariat of real, working socialism, it falls to us to reach out to like minded movements, oppose reactionaries who threaten the Revolution, and bring the world closer to communism."

 TYM.43.d: "The letter crossed mountains and seas. It slipped through the hands of fascists and censors. Protected by an official looking stamp and the no nonsense attitude of its hodler, the expensive paper made its way to the President's desk.\n\n"To the United States," it began. "A large portion of the anarchic Russian wasteland has returned to the fold of the legitimate Soviet government, led by Chairman Kaganovich, and the rest will soon follow. We are aware that the United States, despite its capitalist nature, stands against fascism across the world just as it did in the Second World War. Given the existential threats posed by the Japanese and German empires, it is in the interest of the legitimate Russian government that there be no animosity between our two peoples."\n\n"Be aware, however, that aggression towards Russia or actions that counteract the interests of international socialism will not be tolerated. Russia is reborn and she will make either a dangerous enemy or a valuable ally.\n\nThe Supreme Soviet of the USSR""

 TYM.44.t: "A Soviet Hello"
 TYM.44.d: "To our Kazakh comrades,\n\nThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has been resurrected under Chairman Kaganovich's direction and vision. We have undertaken the first steps towards building socialism within Russia, but we seek to construct a truly internationalist movement as well.\n\nAs a former member republic of the Union, we hope to foster a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship, with the possibility of restoring the Union in its entirety in the future. For now, however, we suggest a simple treaty of nonaggression in order to announce to the world our mutual willingness to advance international socialism.\n\nMuch of Russia is still consumed by chaos and ruled by reactionaries. The wider world is much the same. In these dark times, friendship and cooperation is the shield against annihilation."

 TYM.45.d: "To our Kazakh, Turkmen, and Tajik comrades,\n\nIn the spirit of internationalism, we have delivered several shipments of armaments for your self defense against bandits and imperialist powers. The world is still a dangerous, dark place divided between three empires. At the fault lines where these spheres meet, conflict is sure to erupt.\n\nIn the coming years, as Russia rises under Chairman Kaganovich's guiding hand, your region will be sure to grow increasingly geo-politically prominent as well. The Revolution must be protected from both external and internal threats. We hope that this military aid serves your state well in the defense of socialism."
 TYM.45.a: "We accept!"

 TYM.46.t: "A Denunciation from the Urals"
 TYM.46.d: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received notice of a public diplomatic condemnation from an entity calling itself the West Siberian People's Republic. This government, ruling from its seat in the eastern city of Tyumen, claims successorship to the fallen Soviet Union, and is led by Chairman of the Communist Party Lazar Kaganovich, who claims an "anti-revisionist" orientation. The message, undoubtedly authored with heavy influence from the Chairman, reads as follows:\n\n"The Empire of Japan, one of the foremost imperialist powers on Earth, is one of the foulest enemies of the global proletariat. Under the guise of opposition to European imperialism, it has militarily occupied and incorporated into its "Co-Prosperity Sphere" a number of the countries of Asia, only to further their enslavement under its own rule. Its crimes include the invasion, occupation, and subjugation of China and the massacre of its inhabitants, the systematic extraction of the resources of Manchuria and Southeast Asia for its own ends, the widespread use of slavery in the form of the "romusha" and similar systems, the sponsorship of murderous fascists in the former Soviet Union, the suppression of people's movements in Japan and abroad, and too many other crimes to count. The Japanese bourgeoisie have effectively fused with the state and military apparatus to further the oppression and exploitation of the people of Asia, and in terms of the number of people under its rule alone Japan is the largest fascist regime in human history. It is the task of the world's workers to smash this horrid empire, and give the nations of the Co-Prosperity Sphere true self-determination."\n\nThe WSPR's stance, perhaps to be expected for a communist state, is extremely anti-Japanese. If Kaganovich is allowed to revive the Soviet Union, our control over the states of East Asia would become significantly harder to maintain."
 TYM.46.a: "The Red Star rises to challenge the Sun."
 
 TYM.47.t: "Renewed Communist Hostility"
 TYM.47.d: "The Reichsminister for Foreign Affairs has received notice that a Russian warlord state referring to itself as the "West Siberian People's Republic" has issued a diplomatic condemnation of the Greater German Reich. The Republic, reportedly steered by Chairman [TYM.GetLeader], a Jew, is headquartered in Tyumen and reportedly pushes a more aggressive economic policy than its Soviet predecessors. The message, a caustic screed expectedly filled with Bolshevik cliches, reads as follows:\n"The Greater German Reich is among the greatest imperialist powers in human history and perhaps the bloodiest. Its fascistic, hyper-reactionary, ideology has led it to commit the greatest genocide in human history: the extermination of Jews, Poles, Russians, Balts, and other peoples of Eastern Europe in the name of colonialism and imperial expansion. Through the widespread use of slavery, predicated on race lines, it has overseen the hideous exploitation of the labor of over forty million people in Europe alone, with its conquest of the old colonial territories in Africa expanding that number by millions more. The Soviet Union, a worldwide beacon of the workers' struggle, also fell prey to Germany's depredations, with incalculable costs to its people and the continued occupation of its core territories. The poisonous ideology of racism, which divides the working class only to imiserate them all, has seen no greater success in the world than here, and it ought to be the goal of the international workers' movement to tear down this fascist monstrosity and free the peoples of Germany and Eastern Europe alike."\nThe WSPR may rise to be a threat in the future, but as of now it is still weak and surrounded by enemies, its threats mere saber-rattling. Let it try to challenge the Reich's hegemony; no matter how many times the Bolsheviks rise against us, they will always fail."
 TYM.47.a: "Puerile ranting from a rump state."
 
 TYM.48.t: "Contact Central Asia"
 TYM.48.d: "After over a decade of isolation from any of their comrades in the other SSRs, Central Asian communists have received a very pleasant surprise: correspondence from the Russians! Diplomats and emissaries from the West Siberian People's Republic to the north have journeyed into the region, telling of sympathetic leadership to the north and a revitalized, state-driven communist system, with a leader keenly aware of the mistakes of the old Soviet Union. They promise that aid, trade, and better relations are just around the corner, as soon as the WSPR figures out the logistics of sending supplies through the still-turbulent countryside. In the meantime, they plead only for recognition, and an assurance that the Central Asians will work alongside them for the reconstruction of the Soviet Union when the time comes.\nFor the Central Asians, this offer certainly seems tempting. Aid to reconstruct their shattered, underdeveloped economies and arms to fight their petty border wars would certainly be welcomed. A connection to the outside world for the first time in years seems too good to be true. But there are always doubts; what happens if Tyumen makes demands that infringe upon their sovereignty? The rumors that trickle out of Tyumen paint "Iron Lazar" as far more controlling than the rosy picture his diplomats have painted of him might imply. Assuming the Central Asians decide to embark down the path of friendship with the Siberian strongman, they have much to look forward to, and much to be wary of."
 TYM.48.a: "Slowly, the Union starts to stitch itself together."
 
 TYM.49.t: "Solidarity with Socialists"
 TYM.49.d: "Socialism across the world fell into darkness when the light of the USSR was extinguished. Now that it has been restored it falls to us to ensure that it never occurs again. The workers of the world must unite and share their knowledge, and to that end we must establish diplomatic communications with socialist governments across the globe.\n\nFrom the ports of the Far East and the Arctic, diplomats depart for brother nations across Africa, Asia and the Americas. Those nations less advanced along the path to communism will require guidance from their more experienced older brother."
 TYM.49.a: "Unite, workers of the world!"
 
 TYM.50.t: "Congratulate Compatible Governments"
 TYM.50.d: "While the light of socialism fell dim for years, there are some nations who have stayed true to the path despite the darkness. Isolation has made life in these nations difficult, surrounded on all sides by reactionary powers that seek to deny their existence. Now that the Soviet Union has returned, they can rest easy knowing that they have a friend and ally.\n\nThe construction of embassies in the capitals of our communist friends will do much to recognise the legitimacy of their government and build goodwill towards ours."
 TYM.50.a: "For their struggle, we honour them."
 
 TYM.51.t: "The Call of the Comintern"
 TYM.51.d: "For years socialist and communist organisations across the globe have been scattered and separated by the tyrannical empires that span the world. The renewal of the USSR provides a fantastic chance to end this isolation, to gather the world's brightest minds in one forum. While Moscow or Leningrad may no longer be the capitals of the revolution, Kaganovichgrad is ready to take up their mantle. The Kaganovichgrad Conference will discuss every aspect of socialism, from the world revolution to economic planning to high-level ideology."
 TYM.51.a: "The International is coming home."
 
 TYM.52.t: "Rise of the Cominform"
 TYM.52.d: "The diaspora of socialists that have arrived in Kaganovichgrad is incredible. Revolutionaries fighters from Africa rub noses with National Progressive Pact members from America, Palestinian Arabs and Jews turn away from their opposite numbers with equal disdain, and British communists chat with their continental counterparts. The amount of information being shared is incalculable, but they were invited here for more than a polite discussion over tea and biscuits.\n\nAs the greetings turn to discussion, the delegates are steered towards the correct topic. With the end of the International a new organisation must rise to take its place. Comrade Kaganovich gave an impassioned speech on the importance of socialist brotherhood, receiving uproarious applause from the assembled delegates.\n\nWith that, Comrade Kaganovich proposed the establishment of an organisation that would coordinate socialist movements across the world under the benevolent guiding hand of the USSR. The Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties will be an organisation that coordinates socialist movements across the world under the benevolent guiding hand of the USSR. Each government delegate is offered the chance to join, either as a full or an associate member."
 TYM.52.a: "The International has its successor."
 
 TYM.53.t: "A Delegation to Kaganovichgrad"
 TYM.53.d: "The invitation to attend the Kaganovichgrad Conference was a surprise one, for with the fall of Moscow and Leningrad none expected Russia to become home of the revolution once more. We are always happy to meet with our socialist brothers however, and with a delegation quickly assembled a plane was chartered for the Soviet Union.\n\nThe conference was impressive, despite the diminished state of the Union. Comrade Kaganovich clearly did his best to ensure that the loss of Moscow was not felt too keenly, and the gathering was as heavily attended as the Communist International in the heyday of the revolution. Spanish anarchists and British Trotskyites, Cuban Leninists and Russian Stalinists, every denomination of leftist imaginable in attendance. Such a gathering of minds had not yet taken place this generation.\n\nThroughout it all was the constant presence of Lazar Kaganovich, shaking hands and making himself known. By the end of the night all would remember his name and he would know theirs. Say what you will of the man - and many did - but he is diligent."
 TYM.53.a: "And now for the final announcement..."
 
 TYM.54.t: "Welcome to the Cominform"
 TYM.54.d: "The fall of the Soviet Union left the smaller socialist nations of the world without allies in a hostile world. In the midst of the Conference, Lazar Kaganovich announced a plan for an organisation that would link the socialist world together once more - the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, which will coordinate socialist movements across the globe, sharing intelligence for the advancement of the workers of the world.\n\nAs a proud socialist nation a membership offer has been extended to us. While we have no greater desire than to aid the cause of socialism, there are those who suspect the motives of Kaganovich and the USSR."
 TYM.54.a: "We will gladly join."
 TYM.54.b: "We will view from the sidelines as an associate member."
 TYM.54.c: "We refuse, for we must focus on socialism in our country."
 
 TYM.55.t: "[FROM.GetName] Joins the Cominform"
 TYM.55.d: "With the success of the Kaganovichgrad Conference there was no doubt that membership of the Cominform would rapidly increase. Our hopes have been confirmed now that the great nation of X has agreed in the wisdom of the idea, and elected to become a founding member of the Cominform.\n\nWith one more county by our side, the world comes closer to freedom from the spectre of Fascism."
 TYM.55.a: "This man is your friend. He fights for freedom!"
 
 TYM.56.t: "[FROM.GetName] Becomes an Associate Member"
 TYM.56.d: "The Kaganovichgrad Conference was a success, but our goals evidently do not fully align with those of the rest of the world. The nation of X has elected to join the Cominform as an associate member. This will entitle them an observer position on the affairs of the Bureau and preferential trading status, but they will not be entitled to the foreign aid and organisation granted to full members.\n\nWe can at least be confident they are no enemy to us."
 TYM.56.a: "It will be easier to keep an eye on them this way."
 
 TYM.57.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Join the Cominform"
 TYM.57.d: "The Kaganovichgrad Conference was a success in weeding out false friends, enemies to the socialist cause. The nation of [FROM.GetName], while claiming to adhere to Marxist thought, refuses to join the Cominform and stand in brotherhood with the USSR."
 TYM.57.a: "We now know better than to send aid to these reactionaries in disguise."

Specifically, the questions relates to whether we should begin the process of redistributing the surplus value of our new citizens just as aggressively as we did to our original core, in order to safeguard the revolution (specifically as it relates to clothing, food, housing, etc) and to save them from their own material decadence, or, do we relax such regulations for the time being, in order to make transition smoother for our liberated peoples.\n\n"The decision rests at the behest of the Secretary, and his decision shall be the will of the people and the party.""

 TYM.61.t: "The Newsletter"
 TYM.61.d: "Matvey Nosov was an oblivious man, more often than not. While his friends would not go as far to say that he was stupid, it was agreed by man in the small village he lived in that, by and large, he was very, very forgetful, sometimes to a comedic degree. That is why, when he began to arrive on time for weekly Party meetings, cultural events, and even the smallest get together in the town, it made many curious.\n\nOne day, Oleg Markov asked Matvey what inspired his change. "I began writing these little notes to myself to remember," he said, blushing slightly, "and they've been really helpful." When Oleg asked to see them, Matvey handed a sheet of paper. On it was a detailed list of every event going on in town for the next week, the date and time listed beside them. There were even little descriptions for it, which, to the surprise of Oleg, were surprisingly well written.\n\n"Say, Matvey," said Oleg, "why don't you begin writing this for others too? I am sure people would find it useful." And with that, Matvey, seeing the opportunity to apply himself to something, said he would do it.\n\nThe next day, half the town received slips of paper near or on their property. On these papers were hastily scribbled, but detailed, lists of each event that was going on that week. At the bottom of the sheet was written "Matvey Nosov, Reporter."\n\nOver the course of the next few weeks, the newsletter grew from a simple piece of paper written the night before by one man, expanded to having multiple writers, at least 5 pages long, and printed with a jury rigged machine. Every event had at least one reporter now, either being Matvey himself or volunteers. By the end of the first month, the newsletter had received the official blessing of the local Party organ, applauding it as "proof that the workers can self organize without the need of capital tyranny.""

 TYM.62.t: "An Artist's Lament"
 TYM.62.d: ""I am sorry, comrade, but I am afraid you cannot show your work in this gallery."\n\n"But why!" screamed Goga Ignatyev, his face red from anger. "My work is popular with the workers of this nation - why in God's name can I not present it in this gallery!"\n\nThe official flinched a little at this yelling, but did not back down, even as they were now gathering a scene in front of the gallery. The artist's paintings, once hanging in the city gallery, were leaning against the entrance door, wrapped in cloth.\n\n"Comrade Ignatyev, as a long time supporter of the Party, I am sure you understand the new policies presented by Secretary Kaganovich?"\n\n"Of course! But why is my art being taken out?"\n\n"Because, comrade, it depicts an unproductive lifestyle of the proletariat. In your paintings, I see they are lazing about: watching movies, walking their dogs, shopping, playing sports, etc. While it is fine and good to paint this sometimes, it is a danger to the workers of this nation to believe that should expect all play and no work, all while we have enemies at our door."\n\nIgnatyev's jaw was dropping as the official continued to speak, his mind seemingly incapable of understanding the magnitude of what in the world was happening. When it was silent, he asked "So, what am I supposed to draw?"\n\n"It is not our job to tell you what to draw, comrade, only merely what is allowed to be drawn, for the safety of the workers. Still, I am sure you'll come up with something.""
 TYM.62.a: "Censorship is to art as lynching is to justice. Sometimes, it's justified."

 TYM.63.t: "Propaganda of the Word"
 TYM.63.d: "Secretary Lazar Kaganovich walked up the stairs to the second story of the Revolutionary Literature Production Facility, the largest propaganda shop in Western Siberia, a small entourage of party lackeys and facility managers in tow. In front of him was a large, expansive collection of printers, all stamping the same pictures over and over. By the end of the day, they would be delivered all over Siberia and beyond, to comrades and to the workers all over Russia.\n\n"This is the printing room. It requires minimal human contact, and is quite efficient in its use of ink," said a manager, smiling a little as Kaganovich looked over his work. "That is good," responded Kaganovich, walking forward and between the machines. "How many do you produce a day?"\n\n"Anywhere from five hundred to a thousand, depending on weather conditions and other production factors."\n\nThe manager went forward, and pulled a propaganda poster out and handed it to Kaganovich. "It is quite nice, if I do say so myself." On it was a picture of Kaganovich, his face much younger and more attractive, smiling in front of a bunch of school children. Below it are the words 'Kaganovich's Lessons for Young Pioneers.'\n\n"I must say," said Kaganovich, "I do like it very much.""
 TYM.63.a: ""Now if only we could increase production...""

 TYM.64.t: "People's Nationalism"
 TYM.64.d: "Trofim had worked in the Department of Propaganda and Agitation ever since it had been first created, and he had always believed in the absolute necessity of it to the state, in its actions to promote the positive messages of socialism to the people. Until recently.\n\nWord had been received from on high that Chairman Kaganovich had determined their future direction. In order to combat the increasing slander and accusations of the state's enemies, communicated rhetoric would be shifted from that of ideological positions to the support of the state itself. Towards nationalistic purposes.\n\nTo this Trofim had felt alarm. He knew that the People's Republic must, had, to endure, and that required compromise that might not otherwise have been entertained. But there was a limit, and the preliminary descriptions of new campaigns that had begun to cross his desk had worried him.\n\nA much greater proportion of the content was focused solely on nationalism, as opposed to socialism, with the potential for the message of the former to increasingly subsume that of the latter. And that was something he did not want to see, so close was it to the principles of the now thankfully vanquished Black League.\n\nWorse, Trofim knew absolutely that he could not speak a word of his thoughts to anyone. The Chairman had made a decision, and that was that. To act or speak otherwise would be tantamount to questioning the state. Which was something that, if the new campaigns were anything to go by, would be regarded even more harshly than before.\n\nNo, he would perform his function, as he always had, and hope that, in time, correct policies and socialist sentiment would prevail."

 TYM.65.d: "Pavel Novikov was cleaning his old worn Mosin-Nagant when his squad leader asked to see him. While this in itself wasn't unusual, what made Pavel uncomfortable was when he asked that the rifle he left where it was, saying "It will be dealt with later."\n\nTypically, Pavel didn't get nervous, but as he was led to the bunkhouse his comrades slept in, all of them unarmed and sitting in chairs in a circle, just as clueless as he, it sent him on edge. The squad leader stood up, a large bag in hand, staring down at them in a judging manner.\n\n"Comrades," began the squad leader, his voice deep and guttural, which made Pavel want to stand up straight, up and at attention. "You have spent your entire careers as defenders of the revolution using the same weapons used by those who came before. They have worked to our benefit, but, as the march of social progress continues, so must material progress likewise."\n\nHe then threw the bag on the ground, in the middle of the circle, and poking out were what seemed like dozens of rifle barrels. "These are your rewards for protecting the revolution, comrades. Enjoy."\n\nPavel looked at his squad mates, the nervousness replaced with curiosity. Pavel then bent down, and pulled out a new, fresh rifle -- just off the assembly line, it looked like.\n\nThen, Pavel began to wonder if the rifle range was open today."

 TYM.67.t: "A Question of Expediency"
 TYM.67.d: "Air Marshall Roman Ivanov sat at his desk, two lists sitting before him, columns and rows extending endlessly, filled with names in professional typeface, no doubt created by some little beady eyed freak in the Security Department.\n\nHe sighed, rubbing his eyes. The problem seemed so daunting, so large, and yet, at its core, when reduced to its simplest components, it was actually quite simple. The Free Aviators, a nominally socialist but practical apolitical body that did its best, over the course of twenty years, to protect the people of Russia from the German bombers who plagued their broken, battered country, had been swallowed by the military peacefully enough. They had accepted their rule as a better alternative to the anarchy that harmed Russia. But the problem wasn't their competence, which no self respecting man or woman could deny. Rather, it was a question of politics.\n\nRoman received word from up high that [TYM.GetLeader] and his lackeys didn't like a lot of the aviators. Not enough to purge them, no, they were too popular for that, but just to prevent them from gaining any real power or influence in the nascent Air Force. And so created the conundrum: should he promote the names on the left list, a less competent, but more politically safe option of figures, or the right list, the Aviators, consequences be damned. Choices, choices.\n\nAfter several hours, he decided..."

Many times he rose his opinion of the path the revolution he so adored took, before and after the death of the man that could be saved, and time and time again, he saw his worst nightmares come to life. When the Huns inevitably marched into the land and tore the nation to pieces, when the West Russian War failed due to traitors within and without Russia, and when his own state fell apart to revisionaries and lunatics, any other lesser man would have broken or given up - left to keep his own fiefdom and ignore the cries of the people on the Siberian wind.\n\nBut, for him, it simply reassured his belief that he was right. The man allowed himself a rare chuckle. Even at his lowest, the enemies of the revolution wouldn't dent his spirit.\n\nThey simply proved that Stalin was, time and time again, correct. And, at this moment in time, he'll need to start convincing his own inner Cabinet. He was just done buttoning his shirt, before the door was knocked, undoubtedly to escort him to the Bunker Meeting.

But, Khrushchev wasn't a simple rank and file soldier within the People's Republic, but Kaganovich's own protege, and head of his very own circle within the faction. His opinion was one that most people would not speak aloud, lest they risk his mentor's ire.\n\nHistory shows people flock to what protects them, and guarantees them a right not just to survive, but to live. What guarantees loyalty and drive for the revolution but a full belly, and a sense of safety compared to the reactionaries around their borders?\n\nOf course, it doesn't mean Comrade Stalin or the Chairman was wrong.

Despite the number of bombings he had been through, he had never managed to entirely suppress the panic felt when the bombs fell immediately close, and as the noises grew, he knew that moment was fast approaching. And then it didn't, and the noises started to come from strange direction.\n\nOne man volunteered to look outside, and when he returned his eyes, and grin, were wild. The Aviators had arrived, ambushing the bombers and forcing them to scatter. In an instant, the foreman's panic was replaced with savage glee, the same emotion appearing on the faces of the other workers as well. Today, the Germans were learning that Russians could, and would, fight back. He didn't know how many would die, shot to pieces or incinerated in their burning aircraft, but he, and they, hoped it was a lot.\n\nThe fact that production would not suffer was an added bonus."
 TYM.71.a: "A boon, in every sense of the word."

 TYM.72.t: "Dissonant Discourse"
 TYM.72.d: "Noises echoed through the halls of a government bunker in Tyumen. Outside the doors of one empty room, muffled sounds could be heard from two men. Suddenly, the door came flying open as the two men, alongside their shouting, erupted into the room.\n\n"Bah, we've been over this Khrushchev, we need to focus on the military for the upcoming war. The economy's important but a new economic plan like yours isn't going to help."\n\n"It will in the long term, Kaganovich," Khrushchev retorted. "A new economic policy would help revitalize our agriculture and civilian industry. We need to build on what we have now and support our people. Broad, bold new plans are what will help the economy the most. If we support the civilian economy, the military will follow alongside it."\n\n"Ah yes, a civilian economy does sound nice. I'm sure the bombs overhead right now, or the raiding parties on our borders would agree with your assessment." Kaganovich shot back sarcastically. "Wake up Khrushchev, we are at war! A new economic policy won't help when we need artillery and guns."\n\n"Neither will a military build-up!" Khrushchev responded, exasperated. "Oh, sure it might help now, but we'll be left with a great deal of industry and hands with nothing to do when this is all over! Besides, where exactly are you going to store all this equipment without it getting blown up by one of these damn bombs? Armies are only as healthy as their soldiers, things like agriculture, like food, are important."\n\nKhrushchev's last retort only caused their debate to flare up again. Back and forth the two bickered, now thinking of dragging some unfortunate party members into the discussion. At its current point, however, the debate was far from over."
 TYM.72.a: "This continued for another two hours."

 TYM.73.t: "Savage Squabbling"
 TYM.73.d: "A Soviet bureaucrat strolled down the halls of a government bunker. To his right, he heard shouting coming from a closed door, a familiar sound these days. Stopping briefly the bureaucrat eavesdropped to gather the topic. "Huh, agriculture." He thought to himself, before resuming his walk to avoid any trouble.\n\n"Again with the Virgin Lands!" Kaganovich let out an annoyed sigh. "You are so caught up with this project of yours that you keep ignoring the reality of the situation. We have limited resources. Resources that could be better spent spread across other issues." Kaganovich pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration.\n\n"But does agriculture not merit that sort of attention?" Khrushchev gestured his hand to Kaganovich. "These projects will create food and jobs which will help good people both in and out of the army. People are starving right now, and agricultural projects of some form are non-negotiable!" He raised an eyebrow hoping he convinced his pig-headed colleague of something for once in his miserable life.\n\n"Are there not better ways of doing that though? We should focus agricultural reforms on improving the land we already have! Besides, it's risky. Output fluctuates between the years." Kaganovich closed his eyes and let out a long exhausted sigh. "Look, I know I'm arguing with a brick wall but at some point, we have to come to an agreement, for the good of the party."\n\nKhrushchev relaxed his shoulders and nodded his head. He hated to admit it, but Kaganovich was right on this occasion. "Fair enough, we need to choose something. How about we drink on that, for the party?" Kaganovich was not about to turn down a drink, but before he could respond, Khrushchev had already poured out two shots. The two took the drinks and made a toast to close out their unusually productive discussion."
 TYM.73.a: ""For the Party!""

 TYM.74.t: "A Stomach for War"
 TYM.74.d: "In a desolate and forgotten corner of Western Siberia, a village of wood and brick stood with fields of farmland surrounding it. The few sorry homes were old relics that housed sorry people long forgotten by the world except for those who wished to hurt them.\n\nA thin older man ran across the town down the one dirt road that connected it to the outside world. From the little wooden town hall, he bee-lined for a small dilapidated home not his own. Despite its unlit windows, he knew the person he was looking for was inside sitting with nothing better to do.\n\n"Goga, have you seen this recent pamphlet?" He asked, handing it to him. "I think I found some money now that we've lost our farms."\n\nThe propaganda handed to him was from the Revolutionary Army in Tyumen. It espoused the benefit of joining the army, liberating Russia, and serving the revolution. Most importantly to Goga was the prospect of making money.\n\nGoga was filled with mixed emotions. This was the same group that had acquired his farm and destroyed his livelihood - Then again he needed to put food on the table, and this was a means of doing so. After some back and forth he made up his mind.\n\n"I suppose it's an option," he sighed. "Then again, there aren't many of those left. Guess, it's time to go find a recruiter. I assume you'll be coming along as well, Kolya?"\n\nKolya nodded along before they both headed out of the building and back to the town hall. The return was much slower though, both men now melancholy that this may be the last time they see their town."
 TYM.74.a: "Desperate times call for desperate measures."

 TYM.75.t: "An Ode to Old Friends"
 TYM.75.d: "In an upscale room of a bunker, stuffy wooden furniture surrounded the man who was meant to lead Tyumen. Yet the man in question presently looked nothing like the calm and calculated Soviet bureaucrat one would expect. Lazar Kaganovich walked about the room with his hat tossed aside and beads of sweat rolling down his forehead.\n\nKaganovich stumbled his way to an inconspicuous cabinet and pulled out a bottle of vodka alongside two shot glasses. He shuffled his way back to his desk where he effortlessly uncorked the bottle and poured its contents. one glass was put in front of him and the other opposite his side of the desk. This ritual was something he did before meetings back with his friend Stalin.\n\nOh how he missed the man, Kaganovich thought to himself. In public, he was often intimidating and steely, but in private he had a humorous side few saw. Back when they were subverting Bukharin he recalled an episode with the air service's weather forecasters where he suggested they report the opposite to improve their accuracy.\n\nUnfortunately for him, his time would have to be cut short else he would be later than he already was to the meeting. In an instant, the shot in front of Kaganovich quickly disappeared before being slammed back down on the desk. Leaving in a hurry, he left the vodka to be cleaned up when he got back."
 TYM.75.a: "The second shot remained untouched on the table."

 TYM.76.t: "A Common Response"
 TYM.76.d: "A dark and dreary night hung above West Russia. On a small family farm in the middle of Tyumen, crops stood in the fields waiting for the coming harvest. A few rare farm animals slept in a barn, basking in the peace of the night. Inside the house, a single lamp illuminated a table, where the man of the farm sat.\n\nLudmil rested holding a single piece of paper in his hands. It was a pamphlet that he picked up while in the nearby town getting supplies. The government-issued stamp on the paper was something he had learned to mean trouble. Opening it up, he beheld the recent genius coming out of the city.\n\n"Prepare for the next greatest innovation in farming! The Ministry of Agriculture is here to announce the implementation of communal farms ready to collectivize and distribute all burdens and rewards equally among workers. This ingenious solution has been provided by the party's own Nikita Khrushchev. Be prepared for the future!"\n\nWhat a complete load of horse shit, Ludmil thought to himself. He had seen the effect of communal farms, and it always seemed to end with poor harvests and empty mouths. Without much thought, he tossed the pamphlet outside the window and into the mud. Hopefully, it would be more useful as compost.\n\nHowever, after thinking it over some more, Ludmil did find some information useful. After all, he now had a heads up that grain seizures would resume. His mind began to race with all the potential places he could hide grain. Under floorboards, in pillowcases, in the middle of the woods, anywhere his labor would be secure."
 TYM.76.a: "He slept tensely on a pile of grain."

 TYM.77.t: "Letting Off Steam"
 TYM.77.d: "An early sunset in Tyumen had turned the sky pitch black shortly before the work bell's release. In the hustle of the early darkness, Nikita Khrushchev pushed his way into his office after a long day. He tore off his coat and made his way to his large leather chair behind his desk.\n\nReclining in his seat he let out the stress of the day in a large sigh. The work and bickering were always tiring and seemed to go nowhere. In a sudden rush of frustration, Khrushchev pulled open a drawer in his desk and carefully removed a small wooden box inside.\n\nTattered from years of use, the picture contained the image of a younger man smiling in his service uniform. The wings of a soviet pilot marked his hat below a larger sigil of the party. Khrushchev faintly smiled holding the picture of his son Leonid in front of him. Tears began to trickle down his face.\n\nHow he missed his little boy. He was always full of energy and wit when with his parents. When he said he was going to join the airforce, Khrushchev had been proud. If he had known he would die in the Great Patriotic War he would have maybe tried to stop him. By now, the trickle of tears had turned into a cascade as Khrushchev's reminiscence had turned into a full-on flashback.\n\nHowever, now was not the time to be stuck in the past. If Leonid were here now he would have made fun of Khrushchev for the way he was acting. After all, he had work to do, and he was only able to do it thanks to the sacrifices of young men like his son. His work would not be useless, regardless of the jabs by those around him. Putting the picture back in the box, Khrushchev wiped his tears away before muttering something."
 TYM.77.a: ""Your death will not be in vain.""

 TYM.79.t: "Digging For Victory"
 TYM.79.d: "CLINK! The sound of a pick striking stone echoed through the rest of the mine. CLINK! Alik wiped the sweat off his brow. The work was exhausting and thankless, but satisfying for the miner. CLINK! Smashing open another clump of rock, Alik peered into its contents.\n\n"Damn, nothing again!" Alik sighed disappointedly. He marked off a spot on a piece of paper he kept inside his pocket. Scratching his head, he tapped a point on the paper with his pencil. "Guess I'll try site 47. Further, into the mine, I go."\n\nDelving deeper, the air began to thin as the surface grew more distant. The room was sweltering as the rock walls trapped the heat inside. Opened by the state, the copper mine provided materials for ammunition and limited electronics. Something Alik was well aware of when he volunteered for the job.\n\nAs grueling as the work was, it was something he had grown to appreciate. He had come wanting to serve his country in his own way. Over time, he realized that everyone was in this war together, and had their part to play. Slaving in the mines was his and he was proud to give his part for victory.\n\nArriving at site 47, Alik took a deep breath before striking again at the rock around him. Initially, the stone around him seemed just as disappointing as the last spot. However, just when he was about to give up, a final strike revealed a deep vein lining the wall in front of him. A wide toothy grin appeared on his face. "Jackpot!" He shouted into the cave before dropping the pick in his arms."
 TYM.79.a: "Each worker is their own soldier."

 TYM.80.t: "In the Halls of the Proletariat"
 TYM.80.d: "Tyumen was immersed in an unnatural calm as early morning darkness enveloped the city. In a squat apartment complex, Katia fumbled with her keys as she tried locking the door behind her. The new government housing was cheap but took time adjusting to. Her new factory job necessitated an early start, and that meant stumbling through the building's darkness.\n\nWhile hurrying to the stairs, Katia found herself ramming into something. Pain and confusion were replaced with annoyance as she realized she had bumped into the rare individual also awake at this hour. Before she could chew into them though, they turned around to reveal themselves as a soldier. Katia's blood turned cold as she quickly tried to stammer out an apology.\n\n"I'm s-sorry s-sir." Katia stuttered out in a panic. "I didn't see you in the darkness, I hope you're alright. Say, what brings you out here so early in the morning? My name's Katia by the way."\n\nThe deadpan expression from the soldier had turned into wide-eyed concern. "Please, there is no need to apologize. It's not like the apartment building makes navigation easy with the lights always off." He laughed at his quip. "What brings you out so early? Oh, and call me Kliment. I'm not on duty so there's no need for the formalities."\n\nWith Kliment's casual turn Katia began to relax a little with her response. Some more back and forth later and a pleasant conversation had blossomed between the two. It turned out the two were even neighbors. However, their conversation could not last forever and they were forced to stop lest they be late. Still, as both walked to their jobs they were filled with a previously unseen conviction that they lacked until that point."
 TYM.80.a: "This is why we work."

 TYM.81.t: "The End of the Beginning"
 TYM.81.d: "Kaganovich stood inside his office with two aides behind him. He checked his wrist for the time as he waited for his tortoise-paced colleague to arrive. "Five minutes, where could he possibly be?" Just as Kaganovich mumbled those words, he heard the sound of the door opening, and his associate, Khrushchev, walked through the door. The two men smiled at each other before removing the hats and stepping closer.\n\nKhrushchev spoke with an unusual calm that possessed neither anger nor defeat. "I'll admit, I had my doubts, and I still do, but what has been agreed upon is what's best for the party and nation. At this point, only time will tell its success or failure." He cleared his throat before resuming. "After all, there are bigger obstacles ahead of us."\n\n"I couldn't have put it better comrade." A tiny smirk appeared on Kaganovich's face. "It is time for the traitors around us to pay, all in due time of course. May Stalin's vision bring prosperity to the entirety of Western Siberia and one day, all of Russia!" The smirk had turned into a grin, as Kaganovich's shouting took on a rare jovial tone.\n\nWalking closer to each other, the two men shook hands firmly before pulling into a quick embrace. Afterward one of the aides in the room handed both men a glass of vodka to celebrate their unity. However, in the back of both minds, they thought about how they might best the other and take control when all was said and done. That was for the future though, now was for celebration and unity."
 TYM.81.a: "To the future goes the spoils!"

 TYM.101.t: "Necessary Precautions"
 TYM.101.d: "As the bells struck twelve, Boris happily left his factory and went on his merry way to his favorite place in Chelyabinsk, a lofty little restaurant around the corner of the street and one of the few bright spots in his life in war-torn Russia. Pelmenis, shashlik, borscht, all the dishes that the weary worker looked forward to fill his stomach with.\n\nBut as he came around the corner of the street, Boris grew confused: had he taken a wrong turn? The restaurant should be there, he should be already smelling the freshly cooked shashlik and yet, all he could see was a construction site...\n\nFear crept over him as a realisation dawned on him. The hungry fellow slowly walked towards one of the construction workers, a dreadful look on his face and muttered a few words.\n\n"E-excuse me sir, do you know what happened to the restaurant around these parts..?"\n\n"You mean this?" He pointed at the site. "Repurposed. It's now being turned into an air raid shelter, on General-Secretary Kaganovich's orders."\n\nAnd there Boris stood, a sad look on his face as one of the few bright spots in his life, where he could relax and think of better days, was being repurposed for the country's war efforts."
 TYM.101.a: ""Where am I supposed to eat now?""
 
 TYM.102.t: "On the Road"
 TYM.102.d: "It was a cold day in the plains of Siberia, the air was dry and few things could be seen in this forsaken wasteland. Far in the horizon, a small convoy could be seen, soldiers at the back of trucks freezing as they sat against each other so as to warm themselves. Two of those were seen conversing with each other, ignoring the third pothole their truck had encountered on the derelict road.\n\n"I hate this. Sitting on this cold bench with you, watching out for 'danger' when there's nothing around here. Convoy protection duty really makes me wish for a bandit raid."\n\n"Would you shut up?" his comrade replied "All you've been doing is bitching about how this is, always going on and on about how you'd prefer shooting at something. This assignment is vital, we're close to Tyumen. Consider yourself lucky the commissar can't hear you, otherwise you'd be shot."\n\nThe complaining soldier grumbled, muttering some insults. But before he could get back to his round of complaining, his fellow soldier suddenly pushed him on the truck's cargo bed as they suddenly deviated off the road, stopping at the edge of a grove. As he tried to get up, a humming sound soared over the plain, followed by what sounded like a beast roaring. Eyes looked up to the sky as German planes flew over them, uncontested. A whistling noise soon followed, culminating in an ear-piercing noise.\n\nOne of the trucks hadn't been as lucky as the others, unable to hide in the grove quick enough to avoid being blown to smithereens by the planes: flaming corpses were littering the ground, some soldiers still conscious, trying in vain to extinguish the flames as they agonised.\n\n"Still want to shoot at something? Go ahead tiger, they can still come back, take a shot!"\n\nThe soldier simply laid there, silent, eyes fixing on his dead comrades. It's as if he saw a ghost. For the remainder of the way to Tyumen, he did not utter a single word."
 TYM.102.a: "Ghost riders in the sky."

 TYM.103.t: "The Man of Steel"
 TYM.103.d: "The General Secretary sat alone in his office, glass in hand, remembering days now decades past. Before the war, before the fascists, before the Union, even. Back when they were the representatives of the workers and peasants of Russia, laboring under the oppressive gaze of the Tsar. Then, just as now, victory was not certain. But the struggle wasn't tainted with false victories, missed opportunities, and betrayal. They were the spear racing towards the heart of reaction, their minds ever turned towards the glorious future that awaited them.\n\nKaganovich raised the glass to his lips and drank the vodka within, toasting to the many comrades he would never see again. How youthful the revolution appeared in those days! How vibrant the red banners and stars! How tragic the decline that followed. With Stalin's death, Russia was upon the path to destruction. There was nothing he could do though, his removal to that godforsaken post in Siberia ended any chance of engineering Bukharin's fall from power. He was stuck there, forced to watch as Barbarossa proved his every prediction true, the Germans smashing through an unprepared military and grinding the Russian people into the dirt.\n\nHe slammed the cup back into the table a harder than he meant to, his own aggression surprising him. Even then, that wasn't the end. Karbyshev and Rokossovsky, those traitorous bastards, just had to twist the knife.\n\nYet, It was never over. Russia lay shattered, its people divided amongst various ideologies and systems all aiming for the same goal. It was an opportunity. The people would come to see the future which Bukharin had robbed them, and it would be from Kaganovich's hand that they found the prosperity and freedom they deserved.\n\nBut it would be by that same hand reaction would be crushed. There would be no place for fascists and their servants in the fifth column here. Kaganovich was resolute, nothing would be permitted to endanger socialism and the proletarian state. He had learned much over the years, and one lesson stood above all others:"
 TYM.103.a: "Trust is the weapon of the Fascist."

 TYM.104.t: "A Conflicting Vision"
 TYM.104.d: "Nikita Khrushchev sighed heavily as he sat into his chair in his office. He rubbed against his temple, smoothing out the painful throbbing. If there was ever a moment where Khrushchev wanted to have a drink in his hand, it was at that very moment.\n\nHe had just come back from a meeting with Kaganovich. It was about the proper way to deal with the political prisoners - the 'undesirables' and 'reactionary peasantry' Kaganovich loathed so much. His orders were explicit: only under the watchful eye of the revolutionary could they be led down the right path, and that terror could cure them of their false consciousness.\n\nKhrushchev, as he had many times before, attempted to guide Kaganovich to a more humane, less wasteful policy. Perhaps, Khrushchev said, they could be offered the choice between conscription and hard labor, which would solve the problem of a lack of available manpower.\n\nKaganovich, of course, dismissed it as unorthodox and not in line with Marxist-Leninist thought. Dismissed, Khrushchev returned to his office, depressed. Needing a moment's rest, he closed his eyes, and allowed himself a slight reprieve from the daily horror he was a participant in.\n\nPerhaps one day, he allowed himself to imagine, things would be more humane. Perhaps Marxist-Leninism could be used to enhance human life, rather than cutting it short in cruel industrial planning. Perhaps, he thought with a tiny bit of childish glee, it could be used to destroy the enemy of all things moral, the Germans. Perhaps terror would be forgotten, and socialism will once again rise from the ashes of a broken and shattered Russia." 
 TYM.104.a: "One day."

 TYM.105.t: "The Other Kaganovich"
 TYM.105.d: "One would expect elder siblings to be the ones exercising authority over their younger siblings, yet there was Mikhail Kaganovich, an advisor to his younger brother Lazar, the Man of Steel. Silently at his superior while Lazar was rifling through documents, as if he didn't pay any attention to his elder brother, Mikhail went on to remind him of his presence with a slight cough. Lazar didn't seem to notice.\n\n"Lazar --" Mikhail said, before being cut off "General-Secretary when we're working," Lazar replied in an authoritarian tone. The elder slightly grinded his teeth, visibly annoyed. "General-Secretary, the German bombing issue needs to be addressed. They cannot be further allowed to exerce fear tactics on the common people and destroy our industries without some kind of punitive retribution. I'm pleading -- begging you, that we start taking swift actions against the fascist threat!"\n\nThe General-Secretary kept looking at the documents laid before him, vaguely waving his brother away. "Yes, yes, if you say so..." Lazar said, a slight frown betraying what seemed to be a feeling of hopelessness. The elder brother let a barely audible sigh, his hope of ever being taken seriously by his own younger brother squashed ever so slightly, its embers diminishing each day."
 TYM.105.a: "Family matters."

 TYM.106.t: "The Sword of the Republic"
 TYM.106.d: "'Comrades, comrades, you are the first line of defense against fascism! With a gun in your hand, with your hearts filled with love, you are the warriors of freedom, the ones who make our enemies tremble!'\n\nIvan Konev stopped for a moment, taking a long and deep breathe. In front of him were at least a hundred men, their uniforms mismatched and old. Their bodies were thin, although much chunkier than their civilian counterparts.\n\n'The 1st Tank Division is the pride and joy of the People's Republic, of comrade Kaganovich, and all friends of liberty and justice!'\n\nHe better be, Konev thought with some bitterness. The amount of arm twisting and political wheeling and dealing that he had to get in order to keep the 1st Tank Division up and running was nightmarish. Even in Kaganovich's perfect proletarian state, there were always enough party apparatchiks willing to swap favors for the sake of political expediency - even to the Security Minister and Red Army Commander himself.\n\nSuddenly, as he continued, Konev heard the small whining sound above him. Then, relying on his instincts, he screamed 'Hit the deck!' and did so himself, diving onto the ground a couple feet away. Around him, he could hear men scream incoherently as they realized that, several thousand feet above them, a German bomber was using them as target practice.\n\nAfterwards, when taking into account losses, the dead was seven and injured was thirty, a third of them being permanently incapcitated. Ivan Konev sighed, and, with a heavy heart, cancelled the rest of the speech. The bombing said more than he could have, anyway."
 TYM.106.a: "He who lives by the sword."

 TYM.107.t: "An Unexpected Welcome"
 TYM.107.d: "Stefan adjusted himself as they drew closer to their target. Flying out here was a stretch of the fuel supply of his bomber, but he was mostly concerned with the boredom the journey entailed. It grew monotonous, spending hours waiting to get close enough, dropping their ordinance, then flying all the way back. He signed up for the Luftwaffe thinking it would be more interesting than being sent to garrison a work camp in Ostland, but it appeared as though dull routine followed him out to Siberia as well. He began to sigh, but then suddenly radio chatter exploded.\n\nAnti-aircraft fire.\n\nHe honestly wasn't bothered by it, not nearly as much as the rest of his squadron. A few outdated AA emplacements weren't much of a risk to a jet bomber, and merely made his flight more entertaining. If they stayed above a certain altitude, they were untouchable. Comforted by this fact, Stefan looked out of the window at the rest of the formation, just in time to watch a missile obliterate the Horten to his left.\n\n"Scheiße!" He screamed into the mic, nearly drowning out his commander ordering them to break formation and return to base.\n\nFear gripped him as training kicked in, wrestling control of the aircraft as he fought to turn it around. The radio was filled with the screams of his dying comrades, and the still-harmless thumping of the AA emplacements no longer felt so trivial. it shouldn't take long to get out of range, even if the Russians had missiles there was no way-\n\nStefan was interrupted by an explosion as his aircraft took a hit. The bomber lurched straight down, and his display told him the engines were fucked. He looked behind him, his heart dropping into his stomach as he saw the sky where the back third of his plane should be. As the ground rapidly approached, his mortality crushed his chest like a vice. There was no escape, there was no survival. This was the end."
 TYM.107.a: ""Did you see that one Pavel? It fucking exploded!""

 TYM.108.t: "Thrown to the Wolves"
 TYM.108.d: "Every time he had written to the local Party branch to request adequate air defenses, Maksim had received the same answer: "Your village is a low priority. Tyumen and other major settlements are at higher risk of being targeted and therefore merit the air defenses they can get. Please be patient." Every time he failed, the other villagers would attempt to calm him with soothing reassurances. There wasn't a great risk of being targeted, when the village was so small and there was nothing of military value here. Why would the Germans even bother?\n\nStaring out at the blasted wreckage of his livelihood, Maksim could only laugh bitterly at the recollection. No number of platitudes could have protected the village from the Luftwaffe when it finally came for them. Exactly as he had predicted, laughed aside as paranoid by the others, they had come in the middle of the day. First, a bomb had flattened the Bobrov house, killing the entire family as they ate lunch. Another levelled his barn, and several more obliterated buildings or blasted great craters into empty sections of field. He had spent sixty years helping build this community, only for it all to disappear in a single night.\n\nOf all the survivors, most couldn't believe what had happened. "Why did they choose us, of all towns?" his wife would tell him. "Why us, of all people?" Maksim found the answer trivial. Perhaps they had found Tyumen too daunting and taken out their anger on softer targets. He wasn't angry at them; cursing the Germans' cruelty was like cursing a fox for stealing chickens. It was simply their nature. What boiled his blood was the callous indifference of a Party that claimed to spare no expense in protecting the people. Maybe if Lazar Kaganovich hadn't been so obsessed with saving his own skin in Tyumen, their village could have been saved."
 TYM.108.a: "Not every life receives the same care."

 TYM.109.t: "Do or Die"
 TYM.109.d: "Luka looked back from his family's wooden wagon. Behind them, about six or so wagons followed them, some more broken or old than others, but all functionally similar in purpose. Some, like the one directly behind them, were made up entirely of women and children, their husbands and fathers dying in the defense of their village. Others, like Luka's own, were made up entirely of extended families.\n\nLuka found it hard to believe that two weeks ago he had lived in an actual house, and not just on the cold ground in a tent. He wondered, sadly, if he would live to actually sleep in another bed before he died. According to his father, they were in distance of Tyumen now - and soon they would be safe. Luka found it hard to believe, but he kept quiet for fear of infuriating his father.\n\nSuddenly, he heard the familiar whirring of a German bomber in the air. Looking up, he saw a squadron in the distance in formation - it looked like how birds did.\n\nHe screamed to his family, and they, from grandfather to grandson, flinched as the sound of the bombers approached. His father began screaming at the donkeys, and they, in fear, began moving faster. Luka looked back, and he feared, in his heart of hearts, that they would kill him and his entire family.\n\nFor several moments, it seemed that way. Then, as soon as they arrived, they vanished - but not before dropping several bombs on the fleeing caravan. Looking out, Luka saw half the caravans behind them destroyed and burning. He could hear the faint sound of screaming. "Father," Luka said, screaming, "we must help them!"\n\nHis father did not respond. He simply whipped the donkeys, making them go faster.\n\n"It's the bastards there who did this!" Luka heard a cousin say beside him. "They did nothing for us while people are dying!"\n\nOthers, especially his grandfather and grandmother, agreed with this. Luka didn't respond, and simply hoped that the Germans wouldn't come back."

 TYM.110.t: "You Can't Please Everyone"
 TYM.110.d: ""Comrade Kaganovich!"\n\nKaganovich looked up from his book to see Khrushchev standing outside his office. A grim look was on his face.\n\n"Comrade Khrushchev, come in, what is the matter?"\n\nKhrushchev stepped in. "We have just gotten reports about the destruction of the villages - many of them are being abandoned, sometimes in droves. Hundreds - no, thousands - of people are trying to get into the cities."\n\n"Yes, it is a problem," Kaganovich said, his mind wandering back to his book. He tried his best to sound emotional, but in his heart he had made his peace with that decision the moment he made it.\n\n"We could have done something about it. It was completely avoidable."\n\n"I'm afraid not, comrade Khrushchev. It was a heavy decision, but one necessary."\n\n"Their deaths were completely avoidable. Stationing additional troops and AA guns in the countryside was a possibility."\n\n"Wrong!" Kaganovich screamed, the anger in his voice apparent. For a moment, it looked as if Khrushchev had flinched in fear. "We cannot think of the survival of a few illiterate peasants, comrade Khrushchev. We must think of the big picture. The cities are more in need of our military protection than these sacks of potatoes. I do not take these decisions lightly, comrade Khrushchev." He stopped, allowing the venom in his voice to linger on the word "comrade". "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few - and that is final, comrade Khrushchev. You are dismissed."\n\nAs soon as he said this, Kaganovich went back to his book. He heard Khrushchev leave, shrinking back to his office like a broken man."
 TYM.110.a: "For the greater good."

 TYM.111.t: "The Traitor Marshal"
 TYM.111.d: ""And the Marshal can be dealt with?"\n\nKonev nodded, his back straightened and at the ready. Chairman Kaganovich nodded, and looked back at the file he saw before him. "Rokossovsky must be dealt with soon, comrade Konev."\n\n"Yes sir," responded Konev. Kaganovich flipped through the report. Konev felt proud of it, in spite of how little actual new material was actually in it - the only thing new about it were the tactics and strategic planning. All other information had been done before by others in the intelligence department.\n\n"A traitor deserves a traitor's death. Do you not agree, comrade Konev?"\n\n"Yes comrade Chairman."\n\n"He was always politically maladroit. We should have eliminated him at our earliest convenience."\n\n"That is true, comrade Chairman."\n\n"When will we begin the operation?"\n\n"At your earliest convenience, comrade Chairman. Sverdlovsk will be a problem, but I do believe it can be dealt with.\n\n"I want Rokossovsky placed before a people's tribunal. The bastard betrayed his nation. Keep him alive. I don't want him dying before then."\n\nKonev nodded. "Yes sir, but Rokossovsky must not be underestimated. He is a great general, and being too fast without proper planning will be a problem."\n\nKaganovich stopped reading the report, and looked up at Konev. "Would you prefer we do nothing?"\n\n"Of course not, comrade Kaganovich. I am simply saying that we must not be too hasty. The operation must occur at the proper moment."\n\nKaganovich went back to this report, seemingly ignoring Konev's advice."
 TYM.111.a: ""You are dismissed, comrade.""
 
 TYM.112.t: "Sightseeing"
 TYM.112.d: ""I must admit, comrade Khrushchev, the repair job on this facility is most impressive."\n\nChairman Kaganovich and Khrushchev arrived at the tractor plant in Chelyabinsk only thirty minutes ago, but they had both been engrossed in its workings. They were most impressed by how fast it had been repaired, as it had been completely destroyed three months prior.\n\n"Yes, Chairman Kaganovich. It is impressive. The sacrifices of the working man were not in vain."\n\nKaganovich nodded, and continued walking down the aisles. Below them, men on assembly lines did their part in the well oiled industrial machinery, barely even noticing the men a dozen or so feet above them.\n\n"One day," Kaganovich said, shouting to make his voice heard, "this will be all our factories. Our industry, raped by the Germans, will be rebuilt - and expanded."\n\n"This is true, Chairman Kaganovich, but it will be a difficult path, both for us and for the proletariat. Sacrifices will be made."\n\n"Nay, comrade Khrushchev, sacrifices must be made. It will be difficult, but only through sweat and toil can the scars of Germany be healed."\n\nKhrushchev did not respond. He simply nodded, and continued following Kaganovich throughout the facility."
 TYM.112.a: "A decision I am willing to make."

 TYM.113.t: "Debts to be Paid"
 TYM.113.d: ""Konstantin Rokossovsky, you are charged with heinous crimes against the people and workers of the West Siberian People's Republic. What say you in your defense?"\n\nThe old marshal was silent for a moment. From the moment he had declared a mutiny against Lazar Kaganovich and his faltering republic, Rokossovsky knew that there was always a chance it would conclude with him and his comrades on trial for the unspeakable crime of trying to shelter the people from a malevolent demagogue. This exact scenario played out multiple times in his head since the beginning of his rebellion, and thus, he already had plenty of time to rehearse his response.\n\n"If you expect me to fall to my knees begging for clemency, you can forget it. The only regret I have is not being able to spit in that bald rodent's face one last time before I die."\n\nMarshal Rokossovsky sat back down as the courtroom erupted into jeers, his steely composure remaining firm amidst the chaos. The firing squad verdict that followed his performance did not surprise him, of course. This trial had been decided years ago, and it only served to give Lazar the victory lap he so desperately desired after so long spent grappling with the Third Army.\n\nAs Lazar's guard dogs came to drag him away to his final moments, Rokossovsky could only hope that his comrades would avoid the same fate. As long as knew his fellow officers of the Third would be able to carry on his legacy, in spirit if nothing else, he could go to his grave without much to worry about."
 TYM.113.a: "Defiant to the end."

 TYM.114.t: "Peering into the Abyss"
 TYM.114.d: "SPECIAL REPORT: CHAIRMAN'S EYES ONLY\n\nAssets located in Omsk (officially known as the Siberian Black League) have reported back to handlers of an internal power struggle that is currently destroying the hierarchy of the High Command. Currently, information is hazy, but the following has been confirmed:\n\n1. The Generals, loyal to Karbyshev, heretofore following his death are bickering amongst themselves.\n\n2. The most likely candidate for succession to Karbyshev following his death is a General known as Dimitry Yazov, a known protege of the now deceased general.\n\n3. The Generals, known as the 'Old Guard', do not like Yazov, for reasons varying as personal or ideological disagreements.\n\n4. If Yazov does not win the power struggle, the Black League will most likely collapse, as the League is too incoherent and factional to maintain itself.\n\nAssets located in the League have been unable to determine which side is winning in the internal divisions. Recommendations are to increase funding for assets and handlers located in the League and throughout neighboring warlords, in order to avoid similar hazy information in the future."
 TYM.114.a: "Interesting."

 TYM.115.t: "The End of the League"
 TYM.115.d: "Yelena Karbysheva swallowed nervously as she approached the witness stand. In mere moments, she would be face-to-face with the man who tried to carry on her father's legacy; the very same man she fled from when it was clear that he only desired a continuation of the death and suffering that had plagued Russia for so long. Yelena wasn't sure which was worse: the bloodbath that Yazov desired, or the fact he was doing so in her father's name.\n\nA few more steps, and she was finally at the stand. It didn't take long to find Yazov; his black uniform, tattered and dirtied as it was, stood out like a sore thumb amidst all the others. They locked eyes for but a moment before she turned her attention to her paper. Even as she tried to look away, she could still feel his gaze.\n\n"My name is Yelena. My father was Dmitry Karbyshev, the man who founded the Black League. When I had arrived in Omsk by his side, I had fooled myself into thinking he only had the best interests of Russia and her people at heart. Thanks to the man who stands before us, I can safely say that this was not true. During Yazov's rise to power in the wake of my father's death, I witnessed countless atrocities committed against the people of Omsk. Bodies of those who dared to defy the League littered the streets, and the workers grew skinny and weak from a lack of food and rest. I only have Dmitry Yazov and his Black League to blame for their suffering."\n\n"What does the accused have to say about these allegations?" The judge interjected as Yelena shifted to the next page. This time, she couldn't help but look to see what Yazov would say. Her heart sank. As she suspected, he was staring directly at her.\n\n"I have no regrets. Comrade Karbyshev was aware of the sacrifices needed, as was I. You may not understand now, but you will. When that time comes, it will be too late.""
 TYM.115.a: "An end to the madness."

 TYM.116.t: "A Quiet City"
 TYM.116.d: "As the soldiers of the People's Republic entered Omsk, the one emotion that was shared by all, from the lowest conscript to the highest officer, was surprise.\n\nFor so many years Omsk, and the Black League that had grown from it like a cancer, had been a subject of great concern. It was taken as a given that, regardless of the inevitability of victory, any movement into the city would be fiercely defended against. It was simply accepted that the campaign of pacification would be both brutal and long. None had expected that they would take the city without a fight. None expected to see it abandoned, the extensive defensive emplacements and fortifications abandoned by their creators.\n\nIt soon became clear that the abandonment was total, and that the anarchy that had prevailed within the League following Yazov's downfall and death had totally destroyed it as a cohesive entity. Every installation had been stripped of anything useful, every valuable had been looted, and the few people who remained were quick to beg for whatever food or supplies could, or would, be spared.\n\nThus, once the shock had dissipated, new orders were quickly given. The city was now a shell, yes, but it still possessed the infrastructure to be great once again. In time, it would serve the People's Republic and its campaigns of unification.\n\nAnd the hated enemy it had held for so long would be forgotten. As it deserved to be."
 TYM.116.a: "The Black League is no more."

 TYM.117.t: "Under the Boot"
 TYM.117.d: "Viktoriya had visited the bookstore many times. Mr. Lebedev had let her read whatever she wanted, even if she couldn't afford to buy a single one of the precious books there. It was a place of wonder, which connected the small girl from Sverdlovsk to the wider world. She learned about the philosophies of the past, the histories of nations present and gone. She was even learning English from some books brought in from America.\n\nShe watched now as the men in dark greenish-grey uniforms marched out the shop door and into the truck on the street. Each man carried a book or two. All their faces were stern and none looked at Viktoriya. Mr. Lebedev pleaded with the man with shiny buttons on each book. So far he had only managed to convince the man, who Lebedev called a 'lieutenant', to save a single book.\n\n"I will remind you once more," the lieutenant said, "that if you have an issue with the law, you can bring it up to your local Soviet who can contact their representative in the Party. I only do what I'm ordered."\n\n"But, most of these books are simply fiction. You can't legislate that, it's not even criticizing the Soviet Union directly."\n\n"Again sir, I don't make the law. I enforce it, and these books are no longer allowed."\n\nPoor Mr. Lebedev watched as a quarter of his store's shelves were all emptied. It wasn't everything, and they weren't destroying the books. But Viktoriya knew somewhere in the back of her mind she was never going to see those books ever again."
 TYM.117.a: ""By order the Presidium, the following literary works have been found to be counter-revolutionary...""

 TYM.118.t: "Back in Business"
 TYM.118.d: "The stamp of boots on pavement, the rumble of tanks, the heroic shouts of "Ura!", all brought Ivan Konev back to happier days, when such triumphant thunder echoed throughout Red Square. Today, the mighty tramp and revolutionary revel peeled over the Tura River, Tyumen shaking with the memory of Stalin. Great red banners of the old union and the new blue and white flags of the West Siberian People's Republic fluttered in the breeze, banners waved not in the name of the long dead political strongman, but in the name of Russia's future master, Lazar Kaganovich. He was there, of course, Khruschev and Konev at his side, smiling and waving at the jubilant crowds and ranks of soldiers, the old man ecstatic at the reunification of the pre-rebellion borders of the republic.\n\nKonev smiled and waved as well, but the glee that radiated from Kaganovich and Khruschev was absent from him. He had said nothing to either Soviet giant, but Konev couldn't help but feel that such public displays of joy were premature. Yes, the West Siberian People's Republic was restored. Yes, a great deal had been accomplished. There was, however, so much more to do. The capitalist hellhole of Zlatoust festered still, Dragunov and Kalashnikov continuing to supply the enemies of the people with arms. The defectors from socialism, the prison slave-masters of Vorkuta, still whipped legions of chattel into obedience. The wars were not over, would not be over, for a long, grueling time. Socialism at any cost had been promised to Russia, and it would come, centimeter by bloody centimeter, Konev would see to that."
 TYM.118.a: "He smiled and waved all the same."

 TYM.119.t: "Better Late Than Never"
 TYM.119.d: "With time, the bombed-out village returned to some semblance of normality. Although several of the stronger men had been killed in the attack, the survivors did their best to repair the damage, even rendering a few of the destroyed buildings inhabitable again. Most had accepted it as essentially a natural disaster, unavoidable and with no reason for blame. Only Maksim, who had predicted the Luftwaffe would come and tried in vain to procure air defenses, held on to his anger. He would sit on his porch around the time of day the bombs had first come, drunkenly reminiscing over his failure and the government's refusal to step in.\n\nWhen the government-sent repair workers came, out of the blue and after so much time without any acknowledgement of the villagers' plight, the initial reaction was a mix of confusion, relief, and offense. Months of the Party's negligence had inexplicably given way to a very belated offer of necessary aid. The workers were courteous enough, and most of the villagers appreciated their work ethic. Even as the village rapidly returned to its former self, Maksim took their presence rather differently.\n\n"You betrayed us!" he'd shout whenever they came by. "You left us to die, and now you expect us to be grateful? We could have fixed up by ourselves, but you had to take even that dignity from us." Few were quite as resentful as he was, but nobody could deny that he had a point. The fact was that the Party had failed the people it was meant to safeguard, and it would take more than this to heal the scars it left in the community."
 TYM.119.a: "There is a long and challenging road to forgiveness."

 TYM.120.t: "A Great Leap Forward"
 TYM.120.d: "Mikhail expected his brother's five year plan to be long, expansive, and deeply thorough. Now, after placing the five hundred page book down on the desk during a meeting with both the Chairman and Khrushchev, he had to admit, it was those things and more.\n\n"So," he said, his stoic tone hiding the enthusiasm Mikhail knew Lazar was experiencing, "what do you think?"\n\nMikhail looked to Khrushchev, and Khrushchev to him. There was a moment of silence as the two waited for the other to begin, and, to the happiness of Mikhail, won the contest.\n\n"I think it's a good start. Focusing on rebuilding our industrial base should be our first priority, and I think the policies will do good towards that front."\n\nMikhail held his breath as Khrushchev extrapolated, stating some problems, which, for the most part, Kaganovich took considerably well. Perhaps it was the light way Khrushchev delivered it, or perhaps Kaganovich was in a particularly good mood. Regardless, when it was Mikhail's turn, he sighed and decided to give it straight.\n\n"Chairman, I am afraid that I must differ on this matter with comrade Khrushchev."\n\nIt was ten minutes later that, after Mikhail began his criticisms, that his monologue ended. For several moments, his brother said nothing - didn't even move, just sitting there like he was a mannequin. Then, he began speaking.\n\n"You made some good points, comrade," Kaganovich said, Mikhail noticing the way his teeth grinded behind his straight face, "but you underestimate the damage that Bukharin's policies have done to this country. This will eliminate the NEP in its degenerative form, and begin economic development necessary for a transition from socialism to communism. Your concerns, I am afraid, are outvoted by the majority.""
 TYM.120.a: ""Of course, Chairman Kaganovich.""

 TYM.121.t: "A Red Dawn"
 TYM.121.d: "Kaganovich stared out from his window and down at the streets below. They bustled, to and fro, with hundreds of men and women going to their jobs. Many of them, months ago, had been peasants. Now, as workers, their surplus labor would be used to build communism - something that the Bolsheviks of old had always dreamed of. But this time, it would not be corrupted by revisionism.\n\nIt seemed hard to believe that they had been a little city state less than a year ago. They had fought, tooth and nail, to get where they were now. The standards of living were improving. Industry, once reduced to ashes, was now expanding, centrally, and for the benefit of everyone. And soon, with the Five Year Plan under way, things would only improve from there.\n\nHe turned around, and opened up a cabinet underneath his office desk. Inside was a bottle of wine - from the fields of Georgia. Koba gave it to him, many years ago, when they first met. He had kept it close for a special day when he would be able to repay his friend a kindness.\n\nNow, as things looked brighter, and the productive capacities of the people expanded, it seemed about as good a time as any.\n\nSitting back in his chair, he poured himself a drink and raised his glass."
 TYM.121.a: "To comrade Stalin, whose ideals shall surely never die."
 
 TYM.122.t: "The Growing Divide"
 TYM.122.d: "All who were expected to attend the meeting of the highest echelons of the Party within the People's Republic had, of course, expected there to be conflict between its two titans. But none had thought that such deep divisions existed or, if they had, that they would be so clearly shown.\n\nBut shown they were.\n\nFrom the moment that the meeting began, both Lazar Kaganovich and Nikita Khrushchev were in diametric opposition to each other in their interpretation of the Republic's socialist viewpoint. Kaganovich was, of course, strenuous in his vocal support for the proposals of the old bureaucrat Stalin, and Khrushchev would not hear of it.\n\nAttempts by Party elders across the spectrum came to naught, as each man became only more entrenched in their opposition to each other. As the hours dragged on, and the shouted arguments became increasingly cyclical, it was clear that nothing would be achieved. Eventually, both men stormed out of the chamber through opposite doors, and those who remained wondered what could be done.\n\nNo answers were forthcoming."
 TYM.122.a: "An increasingly severe problem."

 TYM.123.t: "Smoking out the Rats"
 TYM.123.d: "Stepan walked down the street, aware that this was the last walk of his life. At least as a free man. His footsteps carried forward a kind of grim determination. If this was to be his last walk, why do so in fear?\n\nThe courage left him soon enough as he marched along, feeling the hairs of his neck creep and crawl. It was like being hit with a blast furnace. Not that the aging accountant knew much about that line of work. The comparison felt apt, for the burning eyes of the NKVD were burrowing into his skin. A pair of agents were now marching straight towards him. Stepan had played out the scene in his mind a hundred times now. One of the men would shout stop. He would, accepting his fate with grace and dignity. It would be a slow turn on his heel, a smile on his face. That's how he wanted to meet his fate.\n\nExcept, when the man said stop, Stepan didn't. In fact his pace, a steady beat, turned into a rout. His feet moved faster and faster. "Stop!" shouted the agent once more. Stepan dropped his cup of tea and the morning paper. In his flight his hat fell off too. He felt tears painting his cheeks. Eventually, the young agents tackled the middle-aged man to the floor.\n\n"I swear, I was just an accountant! I just filed papers away!" Stepan begged them, blubbering now with snot crawling down his nose and into his mustache. The NKVD men didn't answer him. Stepan didn't stop begging and begging, making one of them speak up.\n\n"We have your signatures on several documents crafted by Rokossovsky's own hand. You weren't some simple cog, you were instrumental to his counter-revolutionary regime. Now be quiet, you look pathetic." Stepan felt his stomach drop. He knew this of course. He knew they would find it. But he had realized just how little of a man he was once the chips were down. Stepan knew the guards wouldn't deliver him, so he prayed to God instead."
 TYM.123.a: "The prayers had about the same effect."

 TYM.124.t: "A Long Night"
 TYM.124.d: "It was an hour past midnight, and Lazar Kaganovich could not sleep.\n\nHe lay wide awake in his bed, his eyes open and his mind racing. It had been a rather stressful day for the chairman of the West Siberian People's Republic, with the Politburo continuing to break apart further and further along petty ideological lines. His own protege, Nikita Khrushchev, seemed determined to force his own interpretations of the revolution upon every man, woman, and child, and the two grew more distant by the day.\n\nKaganovich rolled onto his side, and began to nibble at his fingernails. Khrushchev was once like a son to him, so why did he seem so determined to redirect the revolution Kaganovich had tried so hard to save? The foolish ideals he spouted at every meeting, such as democratic centralism and allowing for non-proletarian cultural expression, bordered dangerously on Bukharinism: the cancerous ideological strain that brought the Soviet Union to ruin in the first place. Surely, Comrade Khrushchev was aware of this?\n\nThe chairman groaned as he shifted onto his back again, and started to nervously scratch his chin as darker thoughts began to invade his mind. Perhaps, Khrushchev was indeed aware of the damage he was causing. Perhaps, just maybe, this was his plan along?\n\nNo, it couldn't be! Khrushchev was with him since the birth of the Republic, and stood by his side even as traitors began to circle. Why was it, then, that Chairman Kaganovich couldn't help but think that Khrushchev's faith in the Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist revolution was beginning to waver?\n\nPerhaps it was time he kept a closer eye on Khrushchev, just to be safe..."
 TYM.124.a: "Better safe than sorry..."

 TYM.125.t: "A Conversation Among Friends"
 TYM.125.d: "...and that's when he said, 'Third from left: Comrade Khrushchev!'" Nikita Khrushchev erupted into wheezing laughter, slamming his hand on the table as he lost composure. His companion, Chairman Lazar Kaganovich, did not seem to share Khrushchev's enthusiasm, and was instead staring intensely at his friend across the table. "Lazar Moiseyevich, is there something wrong?"\n\n"I'm perfectly fine, comrade, I am just rather tired this morning. Rough night." Kaganovich moved his breakfast around with a fork as he spoke. He had not eaten a single bite. "Would you mind if I asked a question, Comrade Khrushchev?" Khrushchev, his mouth full of food, gave a quick nod.\n\nKaganovich set his fork down, and focused his gaze entirely on Khrushchev. "You do understand what we're trying to accomplish here, right? What must be done to preserve the revolution?"\n\nKhrushchev cocked an eyebrow. "What kind of question is that? Of course I do. You wouldn't have trusted me with this position if I didn't."\n\n"Perhaps. You also know that one of our main tasks towards achieving this goal is to root out the traitor Bukharin's influence once and for all, yes?"\n\nA brief silence from Khrushchev. His gradual change of posture betrayed his increasing nervousness. "I don't understand, what's with all these strange questions all of the sudden? Do... do you doubt my loyalty to the cause, comrade?"\n\nA smile that was perhaps too warm to be genuine spread across the chairman's face. "Ah, forget it, Comrade Khrushchev. My mind has been wandering into all sorts of strange places today. Let us change subjects, yes?"
 TYM.125.a: ""Yes, please.""

 TYM.126.t: "Eyes Peeled"
 TYM.126.d: "Lazar Kaganovich cursed under his breath as he listened to the dial tone drone on. All he had to do was send the right people to keep watch over Khrushchev and his allies, and Lazar could finally have the closure he seeked. "Ministry of the Interior, Marshal Konev speaking."\n\n"Comrade Marshal! It's Kaganovich. I'll be brief because I don't have all day to stand around and chat. I'll need SMERSH to keep a close eye on some... suspicious people for me."\n\n"Ah, it's good to hear from you, Comrade Chairman. Uh, isn't this sort of thing what the NKVD is for? Perhaps you should give them a call instead."\n\nKaganovich gritted his teeth. "No, no! This is a sensitive matter, comrade, and I believe you may be the only one I can trust. Khrushchev and his friends need to be monitored, and I don't want to take any chances if he has friends in the NKVD, understand?"\n\n"Comrade Khrushchev...? I see. I don't believe you have anything to fear-"\n\nThe chairman slammed his fist against the wall. "I don't believe I ever asked for your opinion! Can you do it or not?!"\n\nThere was a pause, and the muffled shuffling of papers. "Yes, sir. I'll put my best men on it. I would strongly advise, however-"\n\n"Good! See it done, Marshal! I expect results!" Kaganovich hung up the phone, giving the marshal a clear answer to his plea for caution."
 TYM.126.a: "Now we'll know for sure..."

 TYM.127.t: "The Streets Have Eyes"
 TYM.127.d: "Another long day of work, accompanied by a long walk home, to be followed by a long night attempting to figure out exactly how to convince Kaganovich to adopt some of his policies. Khrushchev's thoughts were mainly on the length of his struggles as he left the building, beginning the journey back to his flat. Occupied as he was, he almost didn't notice the men following behind him.\n\nAlmost.\n\nHis mind started racing as he took an intentional wrong turn. There were two of them; they seemed young, but it was hard to discern features underneath their clothing and glasses. Could they be assassins? No, they were hanging too far back. Reactionaries or foreign agents would certainly kill him to destabilize the regime, so who could they be working for? Khrushchev worked through the various possible groups that would want to spy on him, each less likely than the last, finally forced to confront the only credible option left.\n\nIt was Kaganovich.\n\nThese men must be working for the state. There was no other reason for them to be content with monitoring his comings and goings. They were probably sent to ensure he wasn't meeting with possible conspirators against the General Secretary and the People's Republic. He immediately began taking the shortest path home, attempting to appear unaware of their surveillance. This was bad. Very bad. He would have time to consider this further when he was inside, but even now, one thought consumed him:"
 TYM.127.a: "This is only the beginning."

 TYM.128.t: "The Walls Have Ears"
 TYM.128.d: "Fyodor Kulakov was retiring for the night when he noticed that the lamp on his bedside table was not working properly. The bulb within it had, apparently, worn out.\n\nRetrieving a replacement from his cabinet, he was in truth only partially paying attention to the simple task of replacing the old bulb with the new. His mind was far more occupied with the day's events. As a key member of Khrushchev's faction within the state, there were always endless discussions about how to best approach whatever Kaganovich's latest initiative was. Discussions that were usually accompanied by prodigious cursing.\n\nIt was just as the old bulb left the socket when Fyodor saw it, and his attention was abruptly returned to the present. Running along the inside of the lampshade was a thin wire, exposed only because the cheap stitching had broken as he moved the item, and at the end of that wire was a small microphone.\n\nHe knew immediately that it had to have been placed by supporters of Kaganovich. Who else could it be? Who else did he oppose? Who else had the men, the resources, and the desire to surveil himself, than those supporters? He simply counted his blessings that he had found it, even as he wracked his brain to think about what had been said in the room over the last short while.\n\nCarefully - in the extreme - Fyodor moved his hand away from the microphone, and finished screwing the new bulb in before replacing the lamp on the table. It would not do for whomever was on the other side to know that their bug had been found. If they knew it had been, they would install more, and who was to know if he would be lucky enough to find them?\n\nNo, he would leave it be. He would be very careful only to say things that he wanted to be overheard. And he would, carefully and in a public place, make sure the others in the faction knew what he did.\n\nThat they were being watched. Closely."
 TYM.128.a: "Do they know that I know?"

 TYM.129.t: "A False Alarm?"
 TYM.129.d: ""So, you haven't found anything, then?"\n\n"I'm afraid so, Comrade Chairman. SMERSH has been keeping a sharp eye on Khrushchev and his friends for some time now, we know everything he does- his routines, who he talks to and what he prefers for breakfast. As far as we can tell, he's not up to anything sinister."\n\nLazar Kaganovich couldn't find words in the moment. After so many paranoid nights spent thinking about what exactly Khrushchev was up to behind closed doors, Marshal Konev had just called to inform him that it was naught but wasted energy. He felt a curious mix of relief and embarrassment wash over him. "I see. I appreciate your help, Comrade Marshal. I will inform you if I have need of you again."\n\n"Indeed, but please, next time take a moment to consider your options more carefully. The Red Army's resources aren't boundless, after all. Good night."\n\nSetting the phone back on his desk, Kaganovich leaned back and let out a long sigh. Could it really be that his paranoia was misplaced, and that Khrushchev really was as loyal as he claimed? The chairman did not usually like being wrong, but for this, he could certainly make an exception."
 TYM.129.a: "All is well!"

 TYM.130.t: "All Is Not Well"
 TYM.130.d: ""Why have you dragged us all the way out here, Nikita Sergeyevich? I'm freezing to death over here." Andrei Gromyko shivered as he spoke, desperately rubbing his hands together for warmth. Khrushchev couldn't blame his companion for complaining. He knew, however, that the Chairman would have eyes on every corner of every city. An abandoned cabin in the frigid Siberian wilderness was not exactly the most conventional place to discuss dissent, but it would have to do.\n\n"Comrades, I know this place is not the most welcoming venue for a meeting, but understand that what I wish to discuss here is not something that should be spoken in a public place. Over the past few months, I have come to the realization that I am being spied on, and I have no doubt that Chairman Kaganovich is behind this."\n\nFyodor Kulakov shot up from his seat. "You weren't the only one! I discovered a wiretap in my bedside lamp not too long ago, and Comrade Polyansky told me someone broke into his apartment without stealing anything. What the hell is going on?!"\n\nKhrushchev sighed, and crossed his arms. "I believe Lazar has had enough of us disagreeing with his vision, and is preparing for a purge."\n\n"No, Comrade Kaganovich surely wouldn't consider such drastic action? Perhaps this is all just a big misunderstanding?" Gromyko's words came with a stutter, and this time it wasn't because of the cold.\n\n"Why else would he be sending people to follow us and break into our homes? He's gathering evidence, Andrei! Comrades, I know you all have a great deal of respect for the man, but I'm not going to sit around and wait for him to have us killed on false charges. Will you?" Khrushchev could only hear the wind outside as he awaited a response."
 TYM.130.a: "A resounding "no" was their answer."

 TYM.131.t: "A Brotherly Loyalty"
 TYM.131.d: ""Damn you, Mikhail, how can you not see this? Comrade Lazar has lost his grip on reality, and it won't be long before you're in his crosshairs as well!" Nikita Khrushchev thumped the desk with his fist to accentuate his point. He and Fyodor Kulakov had figured, perhaps too optimistically, that the neglected brother of the chairman would see the world from their point of view.\n\nMikhail Kaganovich shook his head. "Then you're as insane as he is if you think my brother would ever dare to harm me. Do not misunderstand me, Nikita, it is not that I do not believe you. The situation in the politburo worries me greatly and it would not surprise me to see Lazar turning to such... paranoid measures."\n\n"Comrade, your brother has snubbed you at every possible turn. It is because of him that you find yourself unable to make your ideals a reality. Like it or not, working with us may be your only opportunity to get out from under him." Kulakov hoped that his words would strike home in a way that Khrushchev's bluster did not.\n\n"I apologize, comrades, but I cannot turn against my own family. Lazar may be a thickheaded old mule who refuses to see reason, but I could never forgive myself if I condemned him when I know he would never do the same to me." Mikhail rose from his seat with a huff. "I won't speak of our conversation, but it would be for the best if you left me now. Good day to you."\n\nKhrushchev and Kulakov promptly stormed out of the office without another word, and hoped that Mikhail would stay true to his word..."
 TYM.131.a: "Blood is thicker than water."

 TYM.132.t: "Plan B"
 TYM.132.d: "Getting Mikhail to side against Kaganovich was off the table. Khrushchev was getting nervous, he'd need more support in order to stop all of this madness. However, he still had a few cards up his sleeve, and he quickly made a short phone call. Roughly an hour later, Marshal Konev met him at the quiet park bench. He went to shake his hand, but Konev stopped him, jumping straight to the point.\n\n"You wished to speak with me, Comrade?"\n\n"Yes, Comrade... it's about Comrade Kaganovich."\n\n"Mikhail? He's got some strange ideas, but-"\n\n"No, the General-Secretary. His paranoia grows with each passing day, something has to be done."\n\n"I don't know about this, Comrade. This kind of talk-"\n\n"Just think, you've got a lot of connections. You command almost all of the armed forces, and the General-Secretary may possibly see you as a threat."\n\n"Are you saying the General-Secretary wants to get rid of me?"\n\n"Not yet, but considering his current state, it may be simply a matter of time."\n\nKonev sat in silence for a moment, then replied with a quick, "You have my support," and walked to his car before Khrushchev could even thank him."
 TYM.132.a: "The Marshal's not one for small talk, apparently."

 TYM.133.t: "The Pieces Are In Place"
 TYM.133.d: "Khrushchev had contacted everyone he could trust, and now all that was left to do was plan the coup. Konev had had Khrushchev and his allies quietly escorted to a military barracks within Tyumen. Kaganovich was visiting Sverdlovsk, performing a surprise inspection of the city's administrators. Konev laid out a map showing the route the General-Secretary and his convoy would take on their return trip.\n\n"My men will ambush his convoy here," said Konev, pointing to a spot fifteen miles west of the city, "We'll light up his bodyguards, and my men will drag him out and-"\n\n"Hang on, we can't just shoot the General-Secretary! We have to make this seem legitimate, or we'll be the ones getting shot!" that was Kulakov, "We need to legitimize ourselves and get rid of Kaganovich at the same time," Khrushchev nodded in agreement. Kaganovich was the kind of man to have his enemies quietly disappeared, they had to be better than that.\n\nGromyko spoke up, "What if we charge him with something? Claim he's no longer fit for duty, and force him into retirement?"\n\n"I like that idea," replied Khrushchev, "we'll ambush him using Konev's plan, quickly charge him with gross incompetence, and have him publicly removed from office," the other men seemed to agree, even if Konev was less enthusiastic. Kaganovich's days as General-Secretary were numbered now."
 TYM.133.a: "Come on people, let's get moving!"

 TYM.134.t: "The Tyumen Trials"
 TYM.134.d: "As Lazar Kaganovich and his closest allies were marched into the secured area of the courtroom by men that they had, only weeks earlier, been the absolute masters of, those in attendance watched on from the galleries, silently.\n\nHaving subjected so many others, over so many years, to the same fate, many expected the prisoners to sit silently through proceedings that would be executed according to a tightly-controlled plan. But Kaganovich clearly had no intention, at all, of following said plan.\n\nAt every opportunity, he interrupted the state's prosecutor. He ignored his own state-appointed representative. He railed against the judges and functionaries, and made sure that those present were well-aware that he would not, could not, go quietly. His vitriolic condemnations of the trial as a whole, however, paled in comparison to those against the architect of his downfall.\n\nNikita Khrushchev and his policies, he shouted loudly, would bring about the collapse of the state. Would lead to the utter loss of coherent socialist direction. Would centralize power only in the service of himself at the expense of the people, as he had long claimed and as had been proven by his arrest and presence here today.\n\nSuch continued for countless hours, but in the end, however and as all knew, the theatrics mattered little. A trial had to be held, and so it was. The verdict had to have already been decided, and so it was. Lifetime imprisonment at a hard labor camp.\n\nThose watching closely would recall, years later, the look on Kaganovich's face as the judge spoke. He had clearly expected death. Political martyrdom. He would certainly have demanded such a fate inflicted on Khrushchev, had their positions been reversed. Instead, he was to be subjected to years of exhaustion as he was increasingly forgotten. Much worse, as far as he was concerned.\n\nHis shouts continued as he was forcibly led out."
 TYM.134.a: "But nobody was listening anymore."

 TYM.135.t: "The New Face of the Revolution"
 TYM.135.d: "TRANSCRIPT OF CHAIRMAN KHRUSHCHEV SPEECH BEFORE POLITBURO\n\n"Comrade, I come before you as a comrade in arms. Not as a Chairman, but as a member of the party, just as anyone else.\n\nThat is why, I am steering a new course for not only our party, but for our country, and for our people. The days of political repression of innocents are over. The day of extreme political despotism, and the rule of one man are over. Socialism shall no longer be what the dictates of one man states, but on a newfound consensus of our party's membership, just as Lenin thought it be.\n\nThis is not to denigrate the actions of our prior Chairman. He had many policies of which I find, and the majority will find themselves, agreeing with. Rather, our chairman was not removed for practical differences, but for his own mental instability, and lack of respect for his position. He was right to look up to comrade Stalin, but his fondness blinded him to the reality of his actions - believing himself justified in doing whatever he so desired.\n\nWe, as comrades and friends of socialism, shall never allow the actions of one man undermine our responsibilities towards our people and our movement.""
 TYM.135.a: "A new dawn?"

 TYM.136.t: "Two Ideals, One Revolution"
 TYM.136.d: "Publicly, Kaganovich called Khrushchev to his office to celebrate. After all, from a small statelet in the middle of Western Siberia, a nation with nothing but will and determination, surrounded by traitors and demagogues, had Tyumen steadily dealt with the traitors, Rokossovsky's traitorous army and Karbyshev's lunacy doomed to the trashbin of history. Nothing more fitting than to pop open their finest bottles of spirits the Grand Secretary had to spare and spend a pleasant afternoon with his fellow protegé, no?\nYet, there was tension in the air, akin to two duelers, waiting for the other adversary to shoot first. Stalin himself did not live in the flesh, but in the Union, and the fact both men had very different takes of what Stalinism encompass was very much an open secret.\nThe moody silence was interrupted by a single sigh, as the Grand Secretary of the Union lowered himself to bring two cups, and pour the Vodka on each one himself.\n"I half expected I would come to this office with two officers behind him back, you know?"\n"...I can't say I didn't ponder. Your ideas very much veer to the traitors that would sell the motherland to the highest bidder."\n"Would Stalin want you to hold all this power to yourself, Kaganovich?"\n\nThe pouring stopped as Kaganovich stared, expressionless, at his own reflection in the glass. The silence and the tension stretched, before the man silently corked the bottle, slamming it on the wooden desk.\n\n"The Union is Stalin, Nikita. All I did, all I do, and all I will ever do, is to make sure that little ember, that ideal born with Lenin, refined by Stalin, and lived by us each waking moment, doesn't fade with the cold winds; it's a cruel world out there, and you of all people should know it."\n\nNikita's fists clenched, his scowl deepening as Kaganovich stares at him, utterly unphased.\n"But, we're here. We're alive, the Union's alive. That has to count for something, does it not? We've came this far, so... that surely means something." Kaganovich finishes, raising a single glass, waiting for a toast that's all on Nikita's initiative.\n\nThoughts of his dead son came to mind; the despair and sorrow of Yefrosinia, at the lowering of an empty casket, deprived of even mortal remains to bring back home, the haunted expression of prisoners, of endless torture at the hands of the Reich...\n\nKaganovich's right. It wouldn't do to hold to disagreements."
 TYM.136.a: "Na Zdarovje."

 TYM.137.t: "Greasing the Wheels of Industry"
 TYM.137.d: "Lazar and Mikhail sat across from each other, studying over economic planning documents. It was thorough and dense, but they both knew that they would be here until the job was done. Things had moved relatively well in terms of health and infrastructure project development, but, once again, they stopped on the issue that seemingly divided them on every other question.\n\n"Central planning is the only way to industrialize the region, comrade," Lazar said, his voice calm. "Scientifically, it's the only way to bring the region back from the brink."\n\nMikhail, in his typical fashion, attempted to gently push against his brother's opinions. "This is true. The Siberian Plan had many faults, the biggest being a lack of more central planning. But some aspects, I feel, must be incorporated to make this situation more efficient."\n\nFor a moment, Mikhail expected his brother to respond angrily, to begin insulting Bukharin and to berate him for his unwillingness to challenge the economic catastrophe. Instead, he nodded his head. "Some decentralized localized projects would be useful - it depends on the situation, I feel."\n\nHis brother was a little shocked. In the past, he would have denied it on the basis of ideology. They continued onward, discussing generalities that would be hammered out at the next Politburo meeting."
 TYM.137.a: "Perhaps compromise has a future."

 TYM.138.t: "Picking up the Pieces"
 TYM.138.d: "As had become distressingly common, Nikita Khrushchev and his coterie were again working late into the night, exhaustively reviewing the records, figures, and economic policy documents left behind from the now-corrected Kaganovich regime. Or, rather those documents that remained.\n\nWhat was clear, despite the incomplete nature of the information they had been able to piece together, was the scale of the near-disaster that they had only just averted. The economy was, to put it mildly, an absolute mess, and both Khrushchev and his supporters were all increasingly coming to the conclusion that, because of their incomplete knowledge, to change any one course of action was to court utter disaster from some unknown practice.\n\nAnd that was leading him to one unhappy conclusion. Kukalov had, with great reluctance, suggested that they might practice prudence and continue Kaganovich's plans and policies as they regarded the industrialization of the state. At least for the moment. Try as he might, Khrushchev was finding that he could not find any other course of action.\n\nHe had been so eager to put his own plans into motion, and had dreamed how the mistakes made under Kaganovich could be corrected. But there was nothing for it. The state needed stability above all else, and he was, ultimately, its steward. With a muttered curse, he picked up his pen, and began to write."
 TYM.138.a: "Action stemming from necessity."

 TYM.139.t: "Tightening the Screws"
 TYM.139.d: "The reaction to Nikita Khrushchev's announcement, buried as it was in yet another long diatribe to the Politburo, was muted. All had understood it was coming, and even if they had personally disagreed, none would dare to raise objection.\n\nAmong many other reforms, Khrushchev had made clear his intention to, at least temporarily, bar future applicants to the Party. This was, of course, completely necessary - one could not know which new applicants could be considered politically reliable - given that political reliability, after such a violent transition of power, was absolutely essential.\n\nIt also meant, in a quality that went unspoken, that Khrushchev would control the future of the Party cadres as a whole. Would have time and space to determine the qualities he wanted reinforced. The outlooks he wanted supported. The loyalties he demanded as a matter of natural order. None of those listening could honestly say they would have behaved otherwise.\n\nIn time, such restrictions would of course be lessened, before being abandoned altogether. But in the interim they would further increase the measure of control the new administration - and its leader - held over the state as a whole.\n\nAll voted in agreement with Khrushchev, of course. The Bureau, after all, had to appear unanimous in all things. Anything else was simply unthinkable. And counter to Party unity."
 TYM.139.a: "For the good of the Party."

 TYM.140.t: "Khrushchev's Union"
 TYM.140.d: "Khrushchev's eyes wandered about the outsides of the party headquarters, viewing the snow-topped rooftops and streets of Tyumen. Pyotr Kulakov and Andrei Gromyko stood behind him, his two comrades that had been beside him through everything. While Kaganovich may have had no one to trust, Khrushchev knew his ministers would continue to follow him loyally through his victory.\n\n"It almost seems more serene in a way, now that tyrant Kaganovich is gone," said Kulakov.\n\n"Yes, now Russia truly breathes," replied Khrushchev. "This marks a turnaround of fortune for the entire union. Russian society shall breathe the air of true socialism and finally rise to its position for which it was always meant for."\n\n"But we cannot make the same mistakes as Kaganovich," voiced Gromyko. "Or else reactionaryism very well may be able to reach into the party again."\n\n"I will not be another Kaganovich, or another Bukharin for that matter." Khrushchev stated. "Russia belongs to us, comrades, and we will not squander the opportunity.""
 TYM.140.a: "The opportunity to bring the perfect form of communism to the union."

 TYM.141.t: "The Union, Redefined."
 TYM.141.d: "Who didn't dream of unifying Russia? To bring her back from the brink, to nurture her, to make her whole again after all the horrors of the past had torn her apart? Nikita couldn't honestly think of anyone who had wanted things to stay the way they were; and he was perfectly fine with that. As televisions and radio broadcasts crackled to life, as crowds cheered and celebrations began across the union, Nikita Khrushchev briefly took a single deep breath in.\n\nHe'd done it. Somehow, he had been the one to do it. In all honesty, he was probably the most surprised person in Russia at how successful he had been. Within a short span of time, he had ascended through the ranks to General Secretary- then ruler of all of a reborn Russia; a redefined union. And for the first time in a long time, he felt tired. After all that strife, all that plotting, all of the wars and hardships that he had endured, today was finally a day where he had a clear schedule- and nothing to excuse him from a nap.\n\nHe could answer the phone calls and the letters of congratulations later- for once, he felt like his age. Thoughts of successors, and of the future briefly flooded his mind as he made his way up the stairs and paused. Later. Tomorrow at the latest, he'd start thinking about that. Finally, after a few thoughts on reports he had already checked and double checked, and making sure he had done everything he needed to do, he laid down in bed.\n\nAnd as Nikita closed his eyes, he knew that everything he had worked towards was exactly what Stalin had wanted."
 TYM.141.a: "And for the first time in a long time, not only did he sleep- he dreamed."
 
 TYM.142.t: "Another Long Night"
 TYM.142.d: "Lazar Kaganovich stared intensely from his bed at the clock that stood on his nightstand. The hands of the device indicated that it was approaching two in the morning, and yet the chairman was just as awake as he had been all day. The nightly battles against insomnia had been getting more frequent as of late, and rolling around did nothing to bring them to a close; only serving to occasionally awaken his wife Maria, much to her annoyance.\n\nYet, Lazar's mind was focused not on the fact that he had been losing valuable hours of sleep, but on concerns of an entirely different nature. The chairman had recently emerged victorious in a struggle for control over yet another vast portion of Russia; such an accomplishment would surely be something to be proud of, especially for a man with so much yet to prove.\n\nWhy was it, then, that Lazar still felt... vulnerable?\n\nThe republic's enemies without ceased to be an issue for the time being, but what of their enemies within? Chairman Kaganovich's political position appeared to be as secure as ever, with his political squabbles with Khrushchev seemingly resolved amicably even after an unfortunate series of misunderstandings regarding his loyalty. Certainly, Khrushchev wasn't the problem, so who was?\n\nThe chairman's mind raced faster and faster. Someone within the republic certainly had designs on the revolution that stood contrary to both the late Comrade Stalin and Lazar's, but it had to be those who had so far eluded his suspicion, and been allowed to operate with virtually no oversight from the state. Lazar's eyes went wide as his racing thoughts finally crashed into their logical destination, and a realization dawned."
 TYM.142.a: "The Red Army..."

 TYM.143.t: "The Path to Greatness"
 TYM.143.d: "Kaganovich approached the podium in front of the politburo to loud applause. Despite the outward support of the politicians, he had a sunken feeling, knowing traitors were probably in his very midst. However, his plans were drawn up, and he had to display them to the politburo, no matter how treacherous it may be.\n\n"Comrades!" He started. "Now is the time we begin our plan for the true reunification of Russia!" More applause. "With West Russia joining the revolution, it is time we spread Stalin's vision east. And so, with the reunification of Russia nearing, so too comes a plan for the restructuring of a new Soviet Union. A stronger Soviet Union, one that will not buckle under the threat of fascist and reactionary forces. One that will endure, through iron will and determination! While we may have a strong military now, it must be even stronger. The war industry alongside it must grow, only then will Russia be avenged. We cannot have weakness, not when the Germans and the reactionaries eagerly wait to put us down again!"\n\nEven more applause filled the room. "Finally," Kaganovich seethed. "With the restructuring of a new union, we must also discourage reactionaries within our own territories. Soon, the removal of certain counter-revolutionary forces will be set in place, for a stronger and more secure union. The enemies of socialism will not be tolerated anywhere, especially in Russia."\n\nWith his address finished, Kaganovich's cold eyes scanned across the room, the applause having abated." 
 TYM.143.a: "Only the reactionaries have something to fear."

 TYM.144.t: "Five More Years"
 TYM.144.d: "As Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Kaganovich entered the office of the latters' brother, they knew that he was planning to announce something of import. Something he had personally worked on for some time. The man's body language could not indicate anything but.\n\nThey were right. Regarding them both as they entered, Lazar Kaganovich signed the administrative order he had been finalizing and motioned for them to sit. When they did he, acting with efficiency, informed them that he had completed the stipulations and guidelines for the second Five-Year-Plan, indicating the thick portfolio sitting in front of them.\n\nThe two men, both as senior Party members and direct advisors to the Chairman exchanged a quick look, communicating their confusion to each other with the practiced speed of those who existed within the halls of power of such an authoritarian state. They knew that the creation of such guidelines made little sense. But they could not simply say such.\n\nIt was Mikhail, as the Chairman's brother and thus somewhat privileged, who finally spoke the question. The first Five-Year-Plan, he stated as diplomatically as possible, was not yet complete. Its overall effect was not yet known. How could the targets of the second plan be therefore properly established?\n\nIrrelevant, was the answer. The overall goals were known, the Chairman proclaimed - improvement in all sectors - and thus the plan could be outlined. It was soon realized that there was little more to say on the matter. The decisions had been made, and would not be changed, at least by them.\n\nAnd so the two men left, still as confused as before."
 TYM.144.a: "The plan will, no doubt, be wildly successful."

 TYM.145.t: "In His Footsteps"
 TYM.145.d: "After the Tsar's fall, the new regime put itself to work reshaping the city of Vyatka, now Rykov once more, in its own image. This meant repression, inevitably, but it also meant construction. Great public works in grand squares, showcasing the power and glory of the reformed Soviet state. One of these new creations, bombastically unveiled by the local Party branch, was now surrounded by a small crowd of curious onlookers.\n\n"Do you see that, Dad?" A young man said to the older gentleman next to him. "There hasn't been money for a project like this in years. It's a sign, I think. We're really rising out of the ashes again."\n\n"It's a bloody eyesore, that's what it is." The father spat on the ground with venom. "If the Tsar had still been around-"\n\nA few of the other members of the crowd grumbled in agreement, but the son's insistent shushing quieted them down. "Think before you speak, you old idiots! The rules are different now."\n\nEverybody seemed to have a different opinion about the installation. To some, it was a symbol of better times to come. Others thought it was an affront to taste, and let their disapproval show as much as was politically safe. One woman expressed with confusion that, while she had fond memories about socialism, she wasn't sure why they hadn't just put up a Lenin. The coming of several impatient-looking police officers scattered the crowd wordlessly to the wind, and the objects of their interest stood alone. One was a towering statue of Joseph Stalin, staring mustached with avuncular eyes down at the people. Gripping his hand firmly in a gesture of power and friendship was none other than a similarly gargantuan depiction of Chairman Kaganovich himself."
 TYM.145.a: "Somebody has a large self-image."

 TYM.146.t: "A Better Future, Underground"
 TYM.146.d: "When the workman's detail, along with several others, was pulled off of road reconstruction duties around Tyumen by a very stern-looking man from State Security and told to begin modification work on one of the old pre-unification bunkers underneath the city, he had been quite confused. The purpose of the road work was clear, of course, but this was much less so.\n\nHis foreman had seemed equally unsure. But the work order given was properly stamped, properly authorized, and laid out the duties required very clearly. So they had gotten to work. The facility had been in extreme disrepair, and as he executed his assigned tasks, the workman realized that they were effectively making it usable again. Habitable again. He had overheard from the foreman that this was happening at other bunkers all over the city.\n\nThe workman wondered aloud to his closest coworker why such a massive undertaking, with the truly immense amount of work it did and would require, was even necessary. After all, it had been many years since the state had needed such extensive underground complexes, and the threatening borders which had once been just over the horizon were now thousands of kilometres away.\n\nThat drew a harsh look from the other worker, and an even harsher one from the State Security man. The workman quickly stopped speaking. He wasn't paid enough to risk asking such questions, and it did not matter besides."
 TYM.146.a: "Such reasoning is classified."

 TYM.147.t: "Under the Chairman's Gaze"
 TYM.147.d: "Fedir hated those fucking eyes. They seemed to cover every wall, every Party building, every bus, every surface in all of Tyumen. Everybody knew what the Chairman looked like, for God's sake. They didn't need to plaster the whole damned city with his face. "Follow the lead of Comrade Kaganovich," said one poster, emblazoned with the man himself surrounded by a group of smiling children. That one sat just outside of his apartment block, ready to ambush him with its banality right as he began his commute.\n\nSome of Fedir's friends had shaken their heads and said that he was merely irritable. A Party man had told him he'd earn a one-way ticket to the Arctic with that sort of mindset. Fedir didn't think he was being unreasonable, though. He thought it was perfectly natural to be annoyed by a balding despot who had to tell everybody about how great he was. His daily walk to the construction site where he worked was harried by an exponentially increasing number of Lazar Kaganovich. There was a new one today, plastered over what had been a nice mural. It featured the Chairman fiercely gripping a captain's wheel, with words above reading "Russia without the Communist Party is like a ship without a navigator!" Fedir had a few choice words about where the Party was steering Russia, but he suppressed them, giving a withering look to the poster's unfeeling eyes instead.\n\nWhat felt like hundreds of pairs of the Chairman's eyes bored into his soul as he went, but he finally made it to the site. Just as he sighed in relief, something entered his field of vision that almost made him yell in indignation. Mocking him, stuck on the wall of the train station they had just finished, was the largest poster he had ever seen."
 TYM.147.a: "That egotistical bastard!"

 TYM.148.t: "The Great Purge"
 TYM.148.d: "In the harsh life of a conscript, sleep was the private's only escape from the grinding rigor of duty. At day, he drilled endlessly, preparing for an enemy that might never come. In his dreams, drifting ethereally through his home village, he saw his parents and old friends. Tonight's dream was no different. He floated towards his childhood sweetheart, and his mouth opened to make an overture towards her. All that came out was the staccato crack of gunfire, waking him from his bunk with a start.\n\nSure enough, he could hear somebody shooting several rooms away. Were they under attack? Here, nowhere near enemy territory, where they had to drill the soldiers half to death just to give them something to do? It simply didn't make sense. The other men in the barracks were already awake and milled around anxiously, confused by the situation and the lack of orders. Rumors proliferated of civil war, reaction behind the scenes, assassination, and a variety of other frightful possibilities. All of the intrigue ground to a halt when the sound of a man speaking through a megaphone from outside reached their ears.\n\n"Comrades, please remain calm. You are not under attack. The NKVD have received notice of treason at this location, and one of the suspects responded with gunfire. Remain in your barracks. The situation is normal." The anxiety dissipated and was replaced by the sudden energy of throngs of men crowding to the windows. Peeking through, the private could see a group of unfamiliar men in NKVD uniforms leading multiple figures away in handcuffs. The identity of the figures gave him pause. Being stuffed into the back of a secret police van were none other than his commanding officers."
 TYM.148.a: "Whatever happened to the chain of command?"

 TYM.149.t: "For the Good of the People"
 TYM.149.d: ""Save us some time, will you? You're not achieving anything by not confessing, you know."\n\nThe NKVD officer spoke in a soft voice that nevertheless seemed to reverberate off the walls of the cramped interrogation room. A single bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling provided the only light, and the fumes of the officer's cigarette filled up the entire space. The target of his remark, still clad in his Red Army uniform, sat blindfolded on a chair in the middle of the room, sputtering as he coughed from the smoke. "But I haven't fucking done anything! When Chairman Kaganovich hears about this, he'll have your head, I'll make sure of it!"\n\nThe interrogator burst into laughter at the suggestion and had to lean against the wall for support. "Who do you think gave the order?" he said, wiping a tear away. Then, as quickly as it came, the humor left him. "People tend to remember their encounters with me, Comrade General, and not in a good way. If you don't want me to carve a souvenir into your flesh you'll tell me how you betrayed the Soviet people this instant!"\n\nWitnessing the spectacle were a pair of officers standing guard at the door. Though they made an effort to be dispassionate onlookers, both were clearly disturbed. "Yakov," whispered one to the other, "isn't this a little excessive? The man is a general!"\n\n"The Chairman must have reasons we can only guess at." The tone of Yakov's voice betrayed his lack of confidence. "It's safer not to question these things." The interrogation continued for hours, and even amidst his screams the general never admitted a single misdeed. With each denial the guards became less sure of the justice of their task, but trepidation kept them from stepping even a centimeter out of line."
 TYM.149.a: "A cruel machine, powered by fear."

 TYM.150.t: "New Blood"
 TYM.150.d: "A clean shaven face, sharp eyes and pearly white teeth were adorning Geliy's face as he looked at his own reflection in the mirror, a feeling of pride swelling in his chest as he wore his new uniform, reflecting his rise through the ranks, from sergeant to colonel. Some would raise their eyebrows at such a rapid progression, but what did they know? The young officer had been exemplary in his conduct, showing himself to be a capable soldier over the last few years. Surely they were jealous, they had to be!\n\nYet in spite of his own reassurances, thoughts were creeping at the back of his mind, whispers from the common foot soldiers having reached Geliy's ears: some other high-ranked officers - even generals that the colonel had served under - had vanished, as if they never existed. Some suggested that they were taken in the dead of night by dark shadowy figures in leather uniforms, never to be seen again.\n\nPerhaps had he not been promoted based on merit, but on how docile he was seen to be by a higher authority? Come to think of it, other young officers such as him had been recently promoted...\n\nIt was but a thought, yet it was enough for him to turn blemish, his smile gone. He quietly came to a conclusion: that some questions were best left unanswered."
 TYM.150.a: "Blessed are the ignorant..."

 TYM.151.t: "Learning on the Job"
 TYM.151.d: "The smell of glue and the tapping noise of chalk upon a black board are sounds that children are very familiar with, having to endure both of those for five days a week, a pain for the little scoundrels. Yet, today is a day which you'd see in a fever dream, as children man factory lines while their parents sit on cold wooden chairs, their eyes fixated on the alien glyphs written upon the board, their focus diminishing with time as boredom settles in.\n\n"Now, let's get on the word 'comrade': COM-RA-DE" the elder woman serving as a teacher wrote on the black board, stressing her chalk stick so as to seemingly maximise the auditory pain her newest students felt because of it. "All of you are acquainted with the word, yet cannot read nor write it. This changes today, thanks to a reading method using syllables. Does anyone know what a syllable is?" she asked.\n\n"Ain't that something we can eat?" a rough looking worker replied, while raising his hand. The teacher shook her head in disbelief, before she started writing again on the board, stressing yet again her chalk."
 TYM.151.a: "A syllable is..."
 
 TYM.152.t: "Making an Omelet"
 TYM.152.d: ""This is unacceptable! Are we supposed to just bow down and acquiesce to his every whim!?"\n\n"That depends: do we want to keep our heads on our shoulders?"\n\nGlukhov snarled with exasperation as his colleague answered: "Coward! All of you are too chickenshit to express your opinion on Kaganovich's batshit crazy policies!"\n\nHe looked at his Politburo colleagues, yet no gaze met his. The elder statesman left the room, grumbling.\n\nStatesman Glukhov had been one of the most outspoken members of the Politburo, unafraid to express his discontent with the General-Secretarys policies, and known for his distaste with the Politburo's passiveness in opposing them. As he stepped on the streets of Tyumen, his anger dwindled yet remained. "Why are they letting this totalitarian madman do as he pleases?" he thought to himself, "Comrade Lenin would turn in his grave if he saw Kaganovich's madness."\n\nHis teeth gritted as he looked at the sun setting over the city, nightfall drawing ever so closer. The Soviet politician sighed as there was no point getting worked up over acts of cowardice now. Soon he'd be home, eating a plate of borscht made by his loving wife, Sofia. His face slightly lit up at the prospect "At least today will not end on a bad note --"\n\n"He's here, get him!"\n\nBefore Glukhov could even react, several men in dark brown uniforms encircled the old man, blinding his vision by forcing a bag on his head, his arms restrained together by several burly hands.\n\n"Who the fuck are you?! I'm a member of the Politburo, unhand me!" Glukhov barked.\n\n"Comrade Glukhov, you're accused of treason and conspiracy against General-Secretary Kaganovich," one of the shady figures replied. Only then did the old Soviet politician realise what his colleagues feared.\n\nThat night, Sofia would dutifully wait for him, a plate of borscht placed on the dinner table for him to eat. The day after, his colleagues would notice their loudmouthed colleague's disappearance: they would pretend as if he never existed."
 TYM.152.a: "Ignorance is bliss."

 TYM.153.t: "Eyes on Every Corner"
 TYM.153.d: "The conversation between the men, both mid-level functionaries in Kaganovich's administration, began somewhat irreverently. It also ended very quickly, and with much concern.\n\nIt had started with a joke, told quietly from one to the other, and meant to contextualize the increasing restrictions that they had found themselves operating under in recent times. Each week, it seemed, there was another regulation. Another stipulation that had to be followed. Another particular characteristic that their solutions absolutely had to possess.\n\nBoth quickly agreed that the changes they both saw were the result of Kaganovich's policies. The man was growing increasingly totalitarian, even by the standards of the authoritarianism that the state had always possessed. Neither was brave enough to suggest any possibility of 'correction,' but they agreed on the recognition.\n\nThe conversation was interrupted when two others, dressed in nondescript yet sturdy clothing, approached those speaking, and began to ask questions as to the content of their dialog. They were most curious, in particular, as to the direction of their conversation as it concerned Kaganovich, the name having been overheard.\n\nHaving lived in Russia their entire lives, the men knew immediately that the new arrivals were officers of State Security. They knew to subsequently keep quiet. They knew to profess loyalty to the regime in general and to Chairman Kaganovich in particular. They knew that, eventually, they would be allowed to leave. But they also knew that they were being watched. And that their names had been recorded.\n\nThere would be no further conversations."
 TYM.153.a: "Always listening."

 TYM.154.t: "A Will of Steel"
 TYM.154.d: "It is done. The revolution is secured, and Russia's future lies open. The counterrevolutionary forces have been defeated everywhere they've sprung up, and Stalin's vision for Russia appears closer than ever. This was a great triumph for the Russian people, yet Kaganovich still felt discomfort.\n\nThe East. That must be it. West Russia might be clear of the reactionaries, but the east was still a festering pit of traitors to Stalin's vision. They seek to crush the spirit of the Russian people once more, and delay the inevitable revolution of the proletariat for another few years.\n\nHis comrades to the east lie suffering, but not for much longer. The Red Army is prepared to liberate the country once and for all. No more shall the laborer suffer under the boot of the capitalist, the reactionary, the fifth columnist swine. No, Kaganovich held the key to Russia's future, one free from the pains of its past.\n\nTomorrow might be bright, but only through the darkness of today. Blood would be spilt, more than Russia has seen since the West Russian War. It was tragic, it was a waste, and it was necessary. Kaganovich could not surrender the Russian people to the hands of counterrevolutionaries, and they would fight against true socialism to their dying breath. It saddened him to know that even further blood must be shed, but the Man of Steel did not shy from hardship.\n\nWhatever the price, the future would be secured. Nothing must stand in the way of socialism and the revolution. Kaganovich's soldiers prepared themselves for death as he prepared his orders, allowing himself a single tear for those who must perish in the name of liberty."
 TYM.154.a: "The death of one man is a tragedy..."

 TYM.155.t: "A Perfect Arrangement"
 TYM.155.d: "Kalashnikov tapped against the teacup he held in his hand. His whole body was shaking, but the dim lighting of the laboratory helped mask his poor state. At long last, the basement door swung open, and in entered Mikhail Kaganovich. It was clear he made the trip in secret - his overcoat was soaked and water poured from his hat like a fountain.\n\n"Well? Did you check on them?" asked Kalashnikov.\n\nMikhail took a seat: "My resources are very limited. My brother doesn't trust me with political prisoners, but I have friends in the dungeons. Victor is safe and well-fed."\n\nKalashnikov breathed a sigh of relief. "And Dragunov?"\n\nMikhail's eyes fell to the floor, "He was shot yesterday."\n\n"The bastards!" Kalashnikov let out a painful cry. He had known Dragunov for so many years... they made marvelous inventions together... and now, his friend's corpse was probably lying in some ditch.\n\n"Calm yourself, friend," said Mikhail, reaching into his bag "He wasn't given the same offer as you." The chairman's brother produced a loaf of fresh bread - a rarity in this dank place.\n\nKalashnikov took it, feeling the food's warmth. "I don't know how I'll be able to keep this up. They're demanding I invent rifles that even the Americans can't make. How'll I be able to keep my children alive?"\n\n"I'll try to speak to Lazar again." said Mikhail, "Don't worry. I'll get him to see reason." The two men sat there, far beneath the earth, each pondering over their family's issues."
 TYM.155.a: "But nothing changed."

 TYM.156.t: "In The Shadow of Giants"
 TYM.156.d: "Lazar gazed out the frozen window, he looked to the horizon, to new factories, bellowing endless smoke. Below, a steady stream of workers scrambled about their tasks. He remembered an anthill he saw once, in his youth. Ordered, perfect, not a thing out of place. Damn near invincible too.\n\n"Brother," Mikhail entered the office, "Why did I just see a train full of workers depart?"\n\nLazar didn't flinch. His eyes darted to the opposite end of the courtyard: A massive plaque had been hung there, depicting the history of socialism.\n\n"Dammit Lazar!" Mikhail stomped his foot, "It's Sunday, factory quotas should be at a minimum!"\n\nKaganovich sighed, "Tyumen Ironworks fell short yesterday. They're on double time now." He turned to his brother: "Don't you have Kalashnikov's cremation to attend?"\n\n"Yes." Mikhail spit the word out, "Goodbye brother." He left via the courtyard, passing underneath the plaque. He stopped to observe it - the artwork was beautiful: pictures of Marx, Lenin, Stalin... Lazar. "We are a noble cause." He tried to reassure himself. "This...it will all be worth it." Mikhail walked on, passing by throngs of laborers, through the heavy snowfall, to the trainyard..."
 TYM.156.a: "From his office, Kaganovich looked back."

 TYM.157.t: "On The Shoulders of Giants"
 TYM.157.d: ""And in honor of the accomplishments of the Soviet proletariat, I hereby declare the completion of the Workers' Memorial!" Mikhail announced and cut the ribbon. The crowd let out a cheer, throwing hats in the air. Some troops played the old anthem nearby, while trucks with extra rations pulled up in the parking lot. The workers of the Konev Armor Plant surrounded the vehicles, reaching for ice cream, a rare commodity in the wastelands.\n\nKhrushchev emerged from the crowd: "Mikhail!" The two men shook hands, turning to observe the memorial. It wasn't much: a stone sculpture that ran along the width of the factory, depicting working men and women, holding the Hammer and Sickle. However, to the survivors of anarchy, this construction was a groundbreaking achievement.\n\n"Where's the Chairman?" asked Khrushchev, "He is never late!"\n\n"Lazar isn't coming." Mikhail answered quietly, "Said he has work to do."\n\n"But he commissioned the monument!" said Khrushchev.\n\nMikhail didn't comment, his attention drifted to the dark clouds above. "You know Nikita," he sighed, after a long pause, "I worry for him. Lazar eats less and less. I haven't seen him sleep at all this week." Mikhail looked Khrushchev in the eyes: "But worse yet...""
 TYM.157.a: ""I think he is plotting against me.""

 TYM.158.t: "The Third's Last Breath" #Needs new one
 TYM.158.d: "Anyone who has ever been to Lazar Kaganovich's office knows that it is a model of cleanliness. Utterly minimalistic, the room houses only the Chairman, the Chairman's desk, chair, and wardrobe. A single soundproof window looks out into the courtyard below. Those who enter can't help but be stunned - Kaganovich, one of the most powerful men in Russia, works and lives without comfort or distractions.\n\nHowever, at some point the balance in all things is upset. After the conquest of Sverdlovsk, a group of generals, officers, and Red Guards burst into the Chairman's office unannounced, dragging the greatest prize: Marshal Rokossovsky. The man was a shell of his former self - bloodied, beaten, a fresh scar ran along his face. The officers dropped him on the floor, berating his cause, and calling for their Chairman to make a spontaneous speech.\n\n'I refuse to confess, I did the ri-" blabbered Rokossovsky, his voice smashed by the officers' celebration. "Quiet down, dammit!" Kaganovich slammed his fist into the desk, the room fell silent. All eyes fell on Kaganovich, an awkward pause, only to be broken by the Chairman: "Don't bother me while I work!" he pointed down at Rokossovsky, "And get him out of here, his blood is staining the floor!"\n\nSilently but swiftly, the officers carried the Marshal out to the courtyard, where he and the rest of the traitors would be shot."
 TYM.158.a: "And Kaganovich wouldn't watch, for he has better things to do."

 TYM.159.t: "The Failed Trial" #Needs new one
 TYM.159.d: "The jiggling of keys woke Dmitry. His head ached relentlessly as he struggled to remember the details of last night. Brief images appeared: firefights in Omsk's streets, bodies falling around him, red guards barging into the bunker...\n\nThe iron door swung open and a guard entered. The cell was divided into two parts: Yazov sat on the dirty floor in one half, chained to the bricks. A glass wall divided the room, allowing the guard to inspect Yazov without conversing. The man pulled up a chair, sat down, and stared at Yazov, blankly and silently.\n\nMinutes passed, and yet nothing happened. Dmitry's eyes were fixed on the door - any minute, the vile Lazar Kaganovich would step through, gloating about his victory no doubt. Dmitry hastily assembled a speech in the back of his mind. He would remain defiant, cold. The Black League may have lost the war, but wouldn't let Kaganovich defeat his pride.\n\nAn hour passed, and yet no one came. Dmitry's attention drifted off to the recesses of his mind, accusing his officers of losing the Trial before it even began. Suddenly, the glass wall separated and the guard stepped forward, armed with a pistol and... a telephone? Dmitry looked at him with all the hate he could muster.\n\n"Yes comrade." the guard said into the phone. He aimed at Yazov, shot, and the former warlord fell, lifeless, upon the cold brick floor, his last thoughts of pondering how insignificant was he, to not even be given the courtesy of looking his killer in the face."
 TYM.159.a: ""Dammit! I got blood on my uniform!""

 TYM.160.t: "A Quiet City"
 TYM.160.d: "As the soldiers of the People's Republic entered Omsk, the one emotion that was shared by all, from the lowest conscript to the highest officer, was surprise.\n\nFor so many years Omsk, and the Black League that had grown from it like a cancer, had been a subject of great concern. It was taken as a given that, regardless of the inevitability of victory, any movement into the city would be fiercely defended against. It was simply accepted that the campaign of pacification would be both brutal and long. None had expected that they would take the city without a fight. None expected to see it abandoned, the extensive defensive emplacements and fortifications abandoned by their creators.\n\nIt soon became clear that the abandonment was total, and that the anarchy that had prevailed within the League following Yazov's downfall and death had totally destroyed it as a cohesive entity. Every installation had been stripped of anything useful, every valuable had been looted, and the few people who remained were quick to beg for whatever food or supplies could, or would, be spared.\n\nThus, once the shock had dissipated, new orders were quickly given. The city was now a shell, yes, but it still possessed the infrastructure to be great once again. In time, it would serve the People's Republic and its campaigns of unification.\n\nAnd the hated enemy it had held for so long would be forgotten. As it deserved to be."
 TYM.160.a: "The Black League is no more."

 TYM.161.t: "A Very Different Stalinism"
 TYM.161.d: "Chairman Mikhail Kaganovich was working his way through the daily paperwork, which had only increased with the reunification of the West Siberian People's Republic. He was interrupted by a military officer carrying "urgent news," as he called it. Kaganovich beckoned the man to speak after the man gave a rigid salute.\n\n"According to radio broadcasts and our contacts west of the Urals, Western Russia has been reunified. They call their state the 'West Russian Free Republic,' and they are led by President Svetlana Stalina."\n\nThe name Stalina caught Kaganovich's attention, "Svetlana Stalina? Is she Stalin's daughter?"\n\n"We believe so, sir. However, her ideology is far removed from her father's beliefs. She's an ardent anti-communist and anti-fascist, and her regime is thoroughly capitalist, sir," Kaganovich nodded in response to the officer's words.\n\n"As expected, although it is a shame. Mobilize the troops, we need to secure the Urals before they strike," ordered Kaganovich, and the officer gave a nod, a salute, and quickly left the room. Kaganovich leaned back in his chair, and then resumed his work."
 TYM.161.a: "Shame she couldn't be more like her father."

 TYM_khrushchev.1.t: "The Coup"
 TYM_khrushchev.1.d: "Lazar Kaganovich tapped his foot on the airplane floor, hastily explaining to a young official the importance of the next 5-Year plan. The day is ruined, he thought as the craft landed in Tyumen, Khrushchev had better have a good reason for summoning me halfway across the country. The morning was fairly normal - Lazar adhered to his regular routine of a quick shower and breakfast before inspecting the new factories in the North. Everything was shattered when he received a report of unscheduled army movements, followed by an unplanned trip to the Party.\n\nThe airplane door opened, Lazar rushed into the field where five black cars awaited. Khrushchev exited, flanked by armed NKVD officers. Before the Chairman could react, his plane roared back to life and fled.\n\n"Comrade Kaganovich," began Khrushchev as a soldier handcuffed Lazar, "you are charged with incompetence and treason against the Party. You have been found guilty by a general assembly this morning."\n\nThe Chairman was stuffed into the car's backseat, struggling to describe his confusion and rage. Nikita continued, "I have been appointed Chairman. Your tyranny will no longer haunt the people of Russia." The door slammed and Lazar Kaganovich was no more."
 TYM_khrushchev.1.a: "Long live Comrade Khrushchev!"

 TYM_khrushchev.2.t: "Free at Last"
 TYM_khrushchev.2.d: "Vladimir's bony hands gripped the warm coffee, careful not to spill the first proper drink in days. The snow no longer bit his back, protected by a new coat. The gulag's lights had been turned on to welcome the Chairman's visit, illuminating the night. A line of prisoners hurried towards the trucks where officers were distributing rations, a stark contrast to the other side of camp, where the old guard of the gulag was being deported.\n\nThe commotion quilted down when a group of soldiers formed a circle in the main square, all talking ceased when a man announced himself to be the President of the Soviet Union: "Comrades, rejoice! The tyrant Kaganovich has been ousted from power, no longer shall you be forced to work in these camps!" Nikita Khrushchev summoned the attention of everybody now, his voice boomed through the falling snow: "Our new Union is built upon justice, equality, freedom, not slavery and these gulags. Tomorrow my loyal officers will escort you back to your homes, but first eat your fill!" The crowd cheered, never before had Vladimir observed such happiness in the camp. His thoughts drifted to those of home, recollecting memories long gone, hoping to see his family again..."
 TYM_khrushchev.2.a: "We will free Russia."

 TYM_khrushchev.3.t: "The New Union"
 TYM_khrushchev.3.d: ""Comrades, when our Union was founded, Lenin envisioned a society where people of all creeds, colors and genders would be free to live and prosper." The Party responded with applause, echoing across the main hall, "But totalitarian forces corrupted this ideal, led by Lazar Kaganovich and his kabal of officers. No more!" Khrushchev raised his fists, "From now on, we will do everything in our power to reinforce the socialist dream! As we speak, prisoners are being freed from the icy gulags, the bureaucracy is undergoing cleansing, even the powers of the far West look more favorably towards us!"\n\nThe Party had indeed changed since the coup - some Tatars managed to obtain seats, there was more representation for women, and less NKVD officers listening to every conversation. A semblance of Soviet positivism had returned, not unlike that of the old Union. Posters depicting socialist realism decorated the buildings of Tyumen, the crimson banner rode high in the sky and there was even the sound of childish laughter."
 TYM_khrushchev.3.a: "The shadow has passed."

 TYM_khrushchev.4.t: "What Never Was"
 TYM_khrushchev.4.d: "Gregory couldn't help but shake a little as he entered the Chairman's office. Nikita Khrushchev himself, the Reformer and leader of the greatest nation on Earth, sat humbly before him. The room was decorated with paintings of Marx and Lenin, but the Chairman was staring at a small sculpture in the corner. Gregory closed the door behind him, alerting Nikita, "Oh, Comrade Gregory! Welcome!"\n\nFor a moment the young man felt as if his legs couldn't support his weight, and no words left his mouth. "Come, sit!" Khrushchev pointed to an empty chair beside him and held up a glass.\n\nAwed, Gregory sat down and looked at the statue. "Ah yes," Khrushchev turned back to the bust, "-that's Comrade Stalin. Do you know of him?" Gregory managed to shake his head.\n"A pity! What a fine man he was, could have shaped a Union that never was." Nikita looked down, hesitating, "Stalin believed in a country of iron, but also a country of justice. A place where everyone had bread and a roof, free from bourgeoisie decadence." He snapped back, "Nevermind, we still look back to him here in the Party." Georgy stared at the bust, wondering what could have been..."

 TYM_khrushchev.5.t: "End of the Old Guard"
 TYM_khrushchev.5.d: "A thin trail of cigar smoke ascended into the cold morning air, broken apart by a loud cough. A line of infantrymen stared at Malinin with impatience as he finished his last smoke. The crumps of the cigar fell upon the black asphalt, only to be crushed by the man's boot. The NKVD officer, a significantly younger fellow ordered to oversee his first execution, asked, "Any last words, Comrade?" a phrase he often heard in the movies. Malinin sighed, straightened his cap, and, in a sudden change of character, shouted: "Long live Comrade Kaganovich!"\n\n"Ready!" shouted the officer, "Aim!" and the soldiers aimed. "You dogs are only going to ruin the Union, you with your reforms! Russia is built on blood and steel! You, who would release the enemies of the State, who wo-"\n\n"Fire!" Malinin was interrupted by a storm of lead, his body jerked back and crumpled on the asphalt. The officer dismissed the men, but couldn't help but stare at the corpse before him. Could have been me, he reminded himself, before walking away from the past forever."
 TYM_khrushchev.5.a: "We will not repeat their mistakes."

 TYM_khrushchev.6.t: "The Truth, Heard"
 TYM_khrushchev.6.d: "Khrushchev had spent the last month preparing a grand speech. On the rare occasions he wasn't busy, he would scribble in his notebook, conjuring phrases and accusations against the old Chairman. Finally, the 'Secret Speech' was ready to be recited to the Communist Party. And when Nikita ascended the stairs to the podium, papers in hand, he couldn't help but fear the response. What if there are still sympathizers among the Party? What if the committees push back against reforms? But the Chairman went on.\n\n"Comrades, hear, hear! I have with me a list of accusations and truths about Lazar Kaganovich. This list is by no means exhaustive, but I hope that it will enlighten you as to the covert crimes he has committed against the Union." A couple gasps came from the assembly, Khrushchev eyed the TV camera in the corner. Now or never. And so he recited the list, talking of secret murders, kidnappings in the night, deportations to places unheard of, secret gulags not on any map. The Party and people listened in horror. Some even had heart attacks. Some shook their heads in disappointment. Others smiled and said 'I told you so!'"
 TYM_khrushchev.6.a: "And others hoped for a better future."

 TYM_khrushchev.7.t: "Revolutionary Literature"
 TYM_khrushchev.7.d: "(excerpt from Order 491):\n\n...In accordance with the new policies, the newly formed 'committee of revolutionary literature' will be tasked with overseeing the filtration of library contents. Under Lazar Kaganovich, many texts (some of which were apolitical) were banned for anti-party thought. Russian literature, history books, and certain foreign novels had been burned, possession of which was punishable with a trip to the gulag. The committee will meticulously oversee the reintegration of literature into society, aided by recently freed intellectuals.\n\nAdditionally, foreign imports will need to be looked at. While our young reborn country lacks sufficient engineers and professors, we can rely on American texts to teach the next generation. Naturally, all books will be edited in accordance of Marxist-Leninist theory, but we will also need to set up our own printing facilities."
 TYM_khrushchev.7.a: "No more banning!"

 TYM_khrushchev.8.t: "Re-Inspection"
 TYM_khrushchev.8.d: "(excerpt from Order 568):\n\n...If you are receiving this letter, you are still operating a GULAG facility populated by unchecked prisoners. Chairman Khrushchev himself has given the order (Order 239, on XX/XX/XXXX) to re-inspect all political prisoners and free the ones not meeting the new criteria. If your GULAG does not follow through in the next month, expect a visit from NKVD units, and a permanent loss of your current rank. Attached is a sheet with detailed instructions concerning inspection and proper release."
 TYM_khrushchev.8.a: "Signed, Nikita Khrushchev."

 TYM_khrushchev.9.d: "The New Soviet Union is a stark contrast to the one under Bukharin. While anti-revolutionary elements continue to complain about the 'lack of liberties' and 'socialism', we look to the bright future. The dictator Kaganovich is long gone, our version of Stalinism is untainted by the perversions of the old guard. Equality is improving considerably, as is the effectiveness of the 5-Year Plans. Gulag facilities have closed down or greatly limited their inhabitants, a spirit of free will and hope now flies throughout Siberia. We have rekindled a flame that has not burned for decades."
 TYM_khrushchev.9.a: "Let's fly the crimson banner!"
