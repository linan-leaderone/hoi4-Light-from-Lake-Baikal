 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_PETROS_POGHOSYAN_DESC: "No beast in human skin, no desolate Russian prison, no amount of guns, men and bullets could keep Petros Poghosyan from his beloved Armenia.\n\nWhen the Ottomans forced his countrymen to perish in the cruel desert heat, he struck back alongside his fellow patriots like an avenging angel of death, watering the earth with the blood of Djemal Pasha for his crimes. When the Soviets invaded Armenia, Petros was taken by those cruel Russian commissars and forced into the bitter arctic gulags in Vorkuta. Even the frozen chain fences of the Soviet Union could not hold him, and when the prisoners of Vorkuta took flight, Petros was free once more to return to beloved Armenia, a nation still in chains.\n\nThe avenging angel has wasted no time in taking up arms once more, linking back up with his fellow conspirators of ages past to plan the restoration of the Armenian nation and people. The coming war will be long and hard-fought, this Petros knows, and such petty concerns as ideology and faith matters little when the gun is to the head of an entire nation.\n\nWoe be to the Turkish oppressor, for forty years were not enough to rid them of Poghosyan, and now it is certain. §RNothing will ever be.§!"
 POLITICS_GEVORK_VARTANYAN_DESC: "The identity of the Armenian agent "Anri" has eluded Turkish forces since the end of the Second World War. The codename belonged to the leader of the Sons of Hayk, though the vast majority of the organization's own members knew no more than anyone else. At the culmination of decades of planning, as insurgent cells were activated across the mountains, forests, and towns of Armenia, this agent's true name was revealed to the world - Gevork Vartanyan.\n\nA mere sixteen years of age when he began working in Soviet intelligence, Vartanyan was responsible for the capture of hundreds of Axis agents. When Moscow fell, he reorganized his contacts in what was left of Soviet-Armenian intelligence into a clandestine insurgent organization - the Sons of Hayk. Where the Dashnaks chose to let their presence be known to the occupiers, the Sons of Hayk sought to maintain complete secrecy in their operations. Though Vartanyan's name was not known to the Armenian people, his deeds were, and when he finally cast off the veil of secrecy, his movement was met with overwhelming popular support.\n\nSo let his name now be known to both Armenian and Turk - the final phase of the operation has begun, and Armenia's liberation is at hand!"

 ### Ideas ###
 ARM_Fedayeen_Gather: "Fedayi, Gather Around!"
 ARM_Fedayeen_Gather_desc: "For too long have the people of Armenia suffered under the oppression of the Turk. We have been beaten down, chained, tortured, and killed by our oppressor, all in the name of some grand vision by a man long dead. Now, our people will gather, and we will take our revenge.\n\nOur brave fedayi gather, and make ready for war. It will be a glorious struggle, worthy of song and verse! As long as the people support us, we will never give up, never surrender, §Vnot until the very last drop of Armenian blood has been shed in the name of our homeland.§!"
 ARM_united_front: "United Front Of Aras"
 ARM_united_front_desc: "The Armenian people are not the only ones to have felt the displeasure of the Turk. Many of our Caucasian brothers and sisters have felt the lash as we have, and feel the same anger that we do towards our hated enemy. The Azeri in particular have joined with us in great numbers, and make their way to the front lines alongside us. Arm in arm, the many peoples of Caucasia will join together to finally make our shared dream a reality. We will be free."
 ARM_Operation_Nemesis: "Operation: Nemesis"
 ARM_Operation_Nemesis_desc: "The Armenian government has come together for one thing, and one thing only: the complete and total liberation of the Armenian people from Turkey. Nothing else matters in the pursuit of this goal. They care not for good governance, for pittances like domestic policy or foreign relations. There is not time for such things. All must be swept aside in the name of freedom; they care not for what comes after. So long as they take their revenge, and the blood of their families never runs dry, all means will be justified in the end."
