 ### Ideas ###
 
 UKS_long_march_east: "The Long March East"
 UKS_long_march_east_desc: "Had it not been for the explosion of the West Russian War, the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic would have never had the chance to revolt against their German slave masters nearly a decade ago. Similarly, had the Wehrmacht never mobilized to combat the west Russian communists, then the U-SSR organization wouldn't have drawn the ire of a fully mobilized army. With little alternative, and armies closing on all sides, the partisans of Ukraine fled to the east and consolidated their diminished powers. Now, the time to rise has come again, and this time the U-SSR will not falter."
 
 UKS_ethnic_tensions: "Ethnolinguistic Tensions"
 UKS_ethnic_tensions_desc: "The relocation of our operational base to the Kharkiv-Donbass basin, while necessary after the war, has not been without consequence. Shumskyi's insistence on the use of Ukrainian in daily linguistic use is understandable, but causes regular flare ups of tension with the local Russian-speaking minorities."
 
 UKS_shumskyis_clique: "Ascendancy of the Shumskyists"
 UKS_shumskyis_clique_desc: "Since Oleksandr Shumskyi recently came to power in the U-SSR, his position has been one of great popular support, if destabilizing. As Shumskyi has claimed support from Federov's clique of Generals and a great many political figures within the Congress of Soviets, the benefits have begun to make themselves clear to the fledgling nation.\n\nThrough greater national unity ensured by Shumskyi's supporters, the state's stability has only improved, and drastically at that."

 UKS_party_of_many_stripes: "A Party of Many Stripes"
 UKS_party_of_many_stripes_desc: "While still bearing the name of the KP(b)U formed by Lenin in 1918, the current Communist Party of Ukraine is in truth a chimera formed from its mergers with the UKP(borot'bists), UKP (Ukapists), and after 1939 the KPZU (Communist Party of Western Ukraine). This diverse background has led to an unusually pluralistic political culture compared to most Soviet communist parties, with diverging opinions on subjects like political organization and nationality or economic policy being commonly and openly expressed.\n\nWhile Shumskyi has been successful at leveraging his broad popularity among both the masses and the party to keep factionalism under control, who knows what may happen when the beloved Old Fighter's time runs out..."

 UKS_red_army: "The Ukrainian Workers' and Peasants' Red Army"
 UKS_red_army_mod: "£GFX_pol_idea §FThe Ukrainian Workers' and Peasants' Red Army§!"
 UKS_red_army_desc: "§FDivision Organization: [?UKS_red_army_org|%+=.1]\nDivision Recovery Rate: [?UKS_red_army_morale|%+=.1]\nDivision Attack: [?UKS_red_army_attack|%+=.1]\nDivision Defence: [?UKS_red_army_defence|%+=.1]\nMax Planning: [?UKS_red_army_max_planning|%+=.1]\nDivision Training Time: §Y[?UKS_red_army_training|%=.1]§!\nSupply Grace: [?UKS_red_army_supply_grace|.1+=] Hour(s)\nSupply Consumption: [?UKS_red_army_supply_consumption|%-=.1]\nNon-Combat Out of Supply Penalties: [?UKS_red_army_out_supply|%-=.1]\nEncirclement Penalty: [?UKS_red_army_pocket|%-=.1]\nMilitary Factory Output: [?UKS_red_army_industrial_capacity|%-=.1]\nProduction Efficiency Factor: [?UKS_red_army_production_efficiency|%-=.1]\n§!--------------\nFormally created as a separate military upon the defeat in the West Russian War, the now-autonomous Ukrainian Red Army possesses a large portion of the old Soviet officer corps, many of which have recently returned from exile in the West Russian Revolutionary Front.\n\nWhile suffering from limited training and severe equipment shortages, the Ukrainian SSR's forces are far more capable of engaging the Reichskommissariat in open battle than any other partisan army."

 UKS_underground_workshops_desc: ""

 UKS_lessons_of_the_long_march_idea: "Lessons of the Long March"
 UKS_lessons_of_the_long_march_idea_desc: "In 1945, the Red Army was at long last vanquished by the aggression of the Reich. We, standing no choice against the Wehrmacht in open conventional revolt, hid ourselves, underground, in forgotten hallways, and derelict meeting spots. Learning, brooding, and recovering from our mistakes, we abandoned our bases in the West. Marching from the forests of Polissia and Galicia, we settled our new home in the fields of Rostov and Kharkov, and the Donbas steppes.\n\nToday, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic has risen and marches forward to seize her destiny so ungraciously stolen from her by the perfidious menace in the West. From the aftermath of the tumultuous 50s, nurtured by the fires of survival and the tears of our mothers, we have hardened our resolve.\n\nWe are ready."

 UKS_scouts_0: "Westward Scouts"
 UKS_scouts_0_desc: "As Sun Tzu once said, "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles." The acquisition of knowledge and intelligence on the existing matters and affairs of the German administration will ensure a competitive advantage against their forces, even if they are more professionally equipped and rich in materiel.\n\nThus, we shall send scouts deep behind the lines of the enemy to gather the necessary intel that will grant us an intelligence advantage over the enemy. This will be done with the utmost secrecy and quietness - after all, the Germans cannot hit what they cannot see."

 UKS_scouts_1: "Intensified Scouting Operations"
 UKS_scouts_1_desc: "Like termites destroy wood and make a pest of themselves in a house, our scouts have compromised the security of the German administration, much to their annoyance! With the vast amounts of knowledge gained from what the scouts have fed us, we can not only predict - but know the game plan of the Germans. The intel the scouts give us will certainly prove to be an invaluable asset against the Germans.\n\nCome forth, hordes of Nazi scum and reactionaries, for no plan of theirs will be secure from our ears. The Germans won't know what hit them, if their plans have been disclosed in total clarity before us."

 UKS_root_out_collaborators: "Root Out Collaborators"
 UKS_root_out_collaborators_desc: "Collaborators, saboteurs, and operatives are acting against us every single day, operating behind our sights. While our men are on the battlefield, silently, they operate in the shadows, and even the simplest of their operations giving us the most meagre of headaches can soon escalate into large-scale uprisings and the destruction of logistics and information, spelling doom for our cause.\n\nIt is only natural that adequate measures be taken to suppress this growing and festering wound, lest the collaborator cells metastasise across the rest of liberated Ukraine and send the Red Army into full uncontrolled retreat - or even destruction."

 UKS_rally_the_komsomol: "Rally the Komsomol"
 UKS_rally_the_komsomol_desc: "Many years of racial tension and ethnic conflict from the days of the old Russian Empire have planted seeds of ethnic hatred and distrust among the men and children of Ukraine. Reactionary thinking runs rampant among the population, especially the older generation, but it is not something we are content to leave unremedied - after all, what chance do we stand against the enemies that surround us when we leave our people so divided and at odds with one another?\n\nTo remediate ourselves from this and truly build an indivisible socialist Ukraine, we must work together - and this begins with the children, for the easiest way to a parent's heart is through their child. Shedding and forgetting the years of fascism and internalised division, the children will spread the word of communism, and a new future we can achieve, if we put our faith into a socialist Ukraine."

 UKS_convene_factory_councils: "Convene Factory Councils"
 UKS_convene_factory_councils_desc: "To build an arsenal truly capable of defending ourselves from those who wish to smother our fire of freedom, we will require an industry to manufacture the arms we so desperately need. While there are many ways to go about this, we must stay true to our principles and organise the factories in a socialist paradigm.\n\nCentralising the industry and collectivising its output will make us much more efficient at managing our military economy, and with our newfound efficient administration we will allocate even more resources into the construction of new factories and guns."

 POLITICS_SYDIR_KOVPAK_DESC: ""
 POLITICS_OLEKSIY_FEDOROV_DESC: "wholesome communism 100 sablin confirmed?\n\n§R(spoilers: no)§!"
 POLITICS_OLEKSANDR_SHUMSKYI_DESC: "To the likes of a man such as Oleksandr Yakovych Shumskyi, life is always an uphill battle. In every corner, those who opposed him would always stand in his way, and facing them was a life long uphill battle of ideals and ideologies, and the hill was not an easy one to climb. Unlike many others in his time, he was a man of action, not just words, and was sick of politicians and bureaucrats babbling about their ideal world, Shumskyi was the only one bold enough to turn his words into action.\n\nFor a Ukrainian boy born into a minor noble home, a dull future seemed upsettingly inevitable. He studied in the city of Moscow, and instead of finding life dull, he found the key to his future through revolutionary politics. Perhaps that is what pressured Shumskyi into pursuing another life, or perhaps it was destiny for a man like Shumskyi, and it would certainly seem to be something of destiny for any soldier or orator of such skill. Fortunately for the people of Ukraine, Shumskyi is both.\n\nHaving fought for the Revolution against the Whites, and then against the Germans since they first stepped foot into Ukrainian soil, Oleksandr Shumskyi has dedicated every moment of his life not only for the Ukrainian revolution, but for the Ukrainian people. Since his first clashes with Bukharin for Ukrainianization projects to be carried through, not to mention his constant pushes for a Ukrainian Home Army which have only been a blessing since, many regard Shumskyi as the Lion which has saved not only Ukraine from total Russian or German domination, but the savior of Ukrainian culture.\n\nOf course, this position can only last for so long, before the Germans come back to tread on Ukrainian soil once more, and they return to lock the chain around the collective Ukrainian neck. If anyone can put a stop to such a thing happening again, however, it is Oleksandr Shumskyi."
 UKS_Anatoliy_Pisotskyi_hog_desc: "§YUnflinching Radical\nFirst Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine (Bolsheviks)\nLeft Communism§!\n--------------\n§LIf you told a younger Anatolly Pisotskyi - better known by his pseudonym Andriy Richytskyi - that he would serve as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine, he would dismiss it as a passing dream, unsuited for a man like him. After all, he was an intellectual, comfortable in his Ukapist niche. History would have other things in store for him.\n\nAs the UKP ideologue and a critic of the Ukrainian Bolsheviks, Richytskyi would bounce around minor U-SSR positions for several years before the merger with the KPbU in 1925. Over time, he would grow close to party leader Mykola Skrypnyk and his bolshevik ideals. Now the secretary in a new, free Ukraine, he advocates nationwide common ownership through the organization of the population into a single network of communes, though time will tell if he can succeed.§!"
 UKS_Roman_Rosdolsky_for_desc: "§YIdeological Crusader\nPeople's Commissar of Foreign Affairs\nBolshevik-Leninism§!\n--------------\n§LOriginally from Austrian Galicia, Roman Osypovych Rozdolskyi gives a different perspective than many of his East Ukrainian comrades. Born in Lviv just before the turn of the century, his commitment to Marxism is almost as old as his family's struggle for Ukrainian independence. Drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Army, Rozdolskyi was forced into a war between capitalists. When his subjugator fell, he would soon find his way into the revolutionary Red Army to fight for a more noble cause.\n\nRozdolskyi's careful scholarship of Marx's work and study across Europe has won him significant connections and acclaim from the communist movement internationally - An attribute recognized by the party, which granted him a substantial say over the new Soviet Republic's foreign affairs. Rozdolskyi must be able to leverage and pull these connections if the emancipatory promise of the Ukrainian revolution is to survive immediate German reprisal.§!"
 UKS_Vsevolod_Holubnychyi_eco_desc: "§YCautious Councilist\nChairman of the UkSRR Derzhplan\nCommunism§!\n--------------\n§LVsevolod Holubnychyi was once merely one of millions of forced laborers in Germany, stolen from his home in Kharkiv in 1943 at the young age of 15. To any observer, he seemed doomed to follow the fate of so many souls consumed by the Reich - until he encountered an underground KPbU cell among Ukrainian Ostarbeiter, where he would become acquainted with Marxism.\n\nQuickly making a name for himself as a rising star in the intellectual wing of the communist partisan movement upon his eventual return to the Reichskommissariat, specializing in economic readings of Marx's theories, he now stands as the head of the Ukrainian socialist republic's economic apparatus, hoping to use his position to push for the decentralized council-communist system he has always advocated.§!"
 UKS_Mykola_Zubatenko_sec_desc: "§YSteadfast Defender\nPeople's Commissar of Internal Affairs\nNational Communism§!\n--------------\n§LMykola Ivanovych Zubatenko fits well into the idea of a model Chekist, steadfast in conviction, efficient in action, and relentless in pursuit of the enemy. Born in 1917 to a Ukrainian family in Donetsk, Zubatenko would later find himself drafted into the Red Army in 1939 where he chose to join the NKVD. During his studies at the NKVD commissary in Moscow, he felt alienated by his Russian surroundings, wishing soon to return to his homeland of Ukraine.\n\nAs Moscow fell, Zubatenko fought as part of a motorized rifle unit and later slipped away to Ukraine, where he would take part in the local communist partisan movement, gaining influence as the Nazi occupation limped on. He had firmly opposed Tymofiy Strokach's catastrophic decision to launch the general uprising in 1956, which pushed Zubatenko towards his now close friend and like-minded associate Shumskyi. Zubatenko now commands the security apparatus of the Communist underground, his one goal - To ensure both that there may be no freedom for the enemies of the revolution and that there must be freedom for its friends, a goal he will attempt to dedicate the rest of his career and life to.§!"

 UKS_the_longest_war_desc: "For decades the Nazi, boundless in his brutality, has been crushing Ukraine underfoot. For those same decades the dedicated partisans of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic have been fighting them. Through setbacks, deaths, and campaigns of terror all, we endure. We thrive.\n\nThe Republic is still the strongest single force resisting the Reichskommissariat and their collaborators, and holds high the flag of the Eternal Revolution. We cannot lose, for if we do, Ukraine is lost. We will die before that happens. We will make doubly sure that the German dies as well."
 UKS_the_call_of_freedom_desc: "In our hearts, we all know that the Ukrainian people are still Communists. But the recent years have been hard, and with the setbacks suffered, we also all know that many, even most, of them have given up hope. We must act to change this. To show them that we remain, and that Ukraine is not lost.\n\nWe will reach out, in print and voice, and remind them that freedom from German tyranny is possible, and even probable, if they support us. The Ukrainian Red Army is the most powerful force in the country fighting for them, and if they will only join us, we can achieve victory."
 UKS_the_cause_worth_dying_for_desc: "In the land known as Ukraine, there is but one cause, only one, worth dying for—ours. We are those that have kept the light alive, that noble flame which Lenin, Shakrai, and Skrypnyk lit and died to keep lit. In our hands we hold the dream of emancipating the worker and peasant from the oppression of capital, renewing the long-oppressed culture and nationality of the Ukrainian people, and transitioning therefrom to a communist society.\n\nSensible Ukrainians know to neglect the other options in this country as unworthy of consideration. Horlis merely promises to hold a Ukrainian whip over Ukrainian workers' heads. Klyachkivsky sells Ukraine more senseless death and destruction and calls it 'national salvation'. And the Germans have only ever promised one thing: slavery and starvation. What response have we to all this but to repeat once more:\n\n§R"Povstan'te, proklyati usyudy - arise, ye wretched of the earth!"§!"
 UKS_the_dissemination_of_free_marxist_thought_desc: "The cornerstone of any revolution is the motivation of the revolutionary. That is why instead of focusing on the failures of the past, we must instead focus on inspiring the proletariat to break the chains of Nazi rule. We shall spread Marx's theories and the hopes of a free socialist Ukraine, where all can live side by side, where no person is denied food or shelter, and where the means of production are owned by the workers.\n\nWinning over the general population will be a great boon to the socialist cause. The toiling peasantry and factory workers will hear stories of a great stateless society that awaits them if they join the righteous revolution.\n\nThe suffering people of the East will surely flock to our ranks once they hear of the bright future that awaits them in a free, Communist Ukraine."
 UKS_and_the_man_to_see_it_through_desc: "There is not a loyal socialist in Ukraine who does not know the name Oleksandr Shumskyi, and with good reason. The Old Fighter has led the movement for years, ever since the turbulent times of the early 1950s, and his encouragement of and support for consensus-based government within the Communist Party has won him naught but praise.\n\nHis many allies support him entirely, and his vision, commitment, and skills cannot be underestimated. He is the man who will lead us to victory over the hated Nazi. He is the man who will be our liberator."
 UKS_our_eastern_fortress_desc: "During the West Russian War, as Yegorov and Tukhachevsky's troops surged over the A-A line, we too launched our own offensive. Much like theirs, we nearly succeeded at toppling the Nazi monstrosity, but met failure. Thousands of brave, strong young men, and hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, would meet their end at the cruel hands of the Wehrmacht and the SS, and we were driven from our previous strongholds in Central and Western Ukraine. It was only the quick thinking of Shumskyi and Korniychuk that would save us from annihilation - a general retreat to defensible areas in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions, which currently stand as our main operating areas within the Reichskommissariat; without which we would soon wither.\n\nHowever, not all is well, even excluding the Nazi presence. Our strong Ukrainization policies, continued under insurgency, have generated no small resentment among the Russian minority, swollen by the inclusion of various Russian lands within the Reichskommissariat's territory. It is necessary to eradicate this potential fifth column before it spirals into a catastrophe - the Party just disagrees on how."
 UKS_redouble_ukrainization_desc: "An unfortunate legacy of centuries of Russian imperial rule is the continued prevalence of the Russian language in preference to the Ukrainian one, particularly in the east in the country. While Ukrainization allowed us to begin to solve this problem before the invasion, it proceeded very sluggishly. Moreover, the Germans, despite their alliance with the OUN traitor-reactionaries, have done nothing to change this.\n\nThe occupation has made things very difficult, but there is a single silver lining: we are no longer bound to maintain the interests of the Russophile minority position in the East. Let us make clear that, if we successfully throw Koch's abomination down, that Ukrainization will return in full force. We do not care what the remnants of Stalin's cultists in Tyumen or elsewhere have to say about it; let them hold their peace since their failure put us here in the first place."
 UKS_compromise_with_national_raions_desc: "For years - decades - we have resisted making accords with our nation's Russian-speaking population. But we can no longer continue to do so. We must have more support, more manpower, and more areas over which to operate, and the only way to gain all of these is to compromise with the Raions.\n\nMany of our old comrades including Khvylovyi, Shumuk, and more can, and will, decry this as a betrayal of true Ukrainian socialism, but they must be made to understand. It is a critical and necessary measure. At least for now."
 UKS_our_southwestern_refuge_desc: "Following our failures in the West Russian War against the fascists, many of our comrades and party leadership fled from the German-occupied majority of Ukraine to Romanian-occupied Odesa. Time and distance have made organizing with them difficult. Still, the time of insurrection and revolution is approaching, and securing our influence on the Reichkommisariat's border is vital for our success.\n\nWith this in mind, we need to organize our resources and manpower in Odesa and coordinate with our old comrades like Pisotskyi, Rozdolskyi, and Pokrytan. Once we secure our footholds, we can expand our influence and use Odesa as a springboard for the antifascist struggle."
 UKS_blind_the_reichskommissariat_desc: "Among the casualties and slaughter we endured in the West Russian War was almost all of our presence on the right bank of Ukraine from Kyiv and Mykolaiv. We cannot allow the Germans to continue their unopposed campaigns of oppression and terror; we must harass the monster at every turn, which means we must bring the fight to the administration's doorstep.\n\nOur objectives here are threefold: establishing an armed presence in the area, spreading our messages and recruitment campaigns, and collecting intelligence on the enemy's activities. These efforts will be our keys to Kyiv once the hour of insurrection is upon us."
 UKS_eradicate_klyachkivskys_agents_desc: "Our influence among the Ukrainian population in Romania's occupied territories is dominant but not uncontested. The words of the OUN-B's thugs disguised as intelligence agents, the Sluzhba Bezpeky, have wormed their way into the hearts and minds of desperate or foolish men and women. The OUN and the UPA are barely any different from the Germans, fascist barbarians who thrive off hatred and cruelty, and their propaganda is a gross distortion of Ukrainian identity.\n\nHowever, this may prove a blessing in disguise; these activities represent the only contact the UPA has with the outside world and is their lifeline for equipment and resources. This way, our cause here is both moral and pragmatic; identifying, rooting out, and destroying the hostile agents will end their madness in Odesa and cripple the monsters in Ukraine."
 UKS_reactivate_underground_cells_desc: "The fascists have done everything they could to snuff out the flame of socialist liberation in Ukraine, a process they have pursued with relentless cruelty. But their efforts have been for naught; the spirit of resistance of the fifties has returned with a vengeance! Beneath the soot of tyranny that chokes out the people, blackens the factories, and ravages the fields are the same ideas and hopes for freedom and justice that led us to victory in nineteen-seventeen!\n\nFreedom, TRUE, emancipatory freedom for labor and peasant is coming, comrades! Liberation from the Germans and the bourgeoisie, man or god, is coming! Lenin is young again, and so is the revolution!"
 UKS_crack_the_apparatus_desc: "We are an insurgency, and as with every insurgency we must take action against the oppressive apparatus under which we are supposedly 'governed.' We are therefore most fortunate that the Reichskommissariat, weak and corrupt as it is, offers us many ways in which to do so.\n\nFrom the countless thousands of 'loyal' collaborators that it relies upon, to the widely scattered and insufficiently protected settlements, to the endless miles of countryside and railway lines, opportunities abound. Every pillar that the state stands upon is vulnerable, and we will strike them all."
 UKS_drain_the_stockpiles_desc: "In the best-case scenario, we can quickly topple the Reichskommissariat and liberate the people without fears of a protracted struggle. However, it would be foolish to dismiss the possibility that the fighting may be extensive and time-consuming. Such a situation would leave us at a disadvantage; our weapon and munition stockpiles are limited and largely outdated, while the German armories are vast and cutting edge.\n\nThat said, we can hit two birds with one stone to resolve this situation. Our contacts and moles within the collaborators can access the enemy's equipment and "lose" them by "accident" for us. This won't fix all our equipment issues and will only be a drop in the bucket for the Germans, but every gun counts."
 UKS_compromise_the_auxiliaries_desc: "The Germans are under the deadly delusion that they can rule Ukraine all by themselves, even as they marshal legions of desperate collaborators to assist their tyranny. The Germans sneer at and dismiss these men, but without them, the German hold on Ukraine would collapse overnight, making infiltrating their ranks all the more vital. Fortunately for us, the Reich's efforts to inspire loyalty and ideological fervor, often with heavy-handed propaganda and hysterical exhortations about "Judeo-Bolshevik" world orders and famines, generate more eye rolls and concealed yawns among the traitors than anything else.\n\nThe simple fact is that these men serve the Reichskommissariat out of survival, not out of devotion, and for every day that the Reich grows sicker, they grow ever more disloyal. Some of us may feel indignant about recruiting these men, but among the traitors are men who know, deep down, that to serve the Schuma or UNA is to fight for the rape of Ukraine, and to serve the Red Army is to save it."
 UKS_terror_against_the_occupier_desc: "During the "normal" course of bourgeois society and its diseased mode of civilization, terror against those who would fight for its continuation is both justified and necessary.\n\nHow, then, must we act in confrontation with the Reichskommissariat? For the past two decades, the Germans have done nothing but butcher our people, burn our fields, and deface our cities, all to leech every drop of blood from the Ukrainian land and people—and have made no pretense of any other purpose. No punishment can be considered sufficiently harsh for anyone who would give their life to defend such a reality."
 UKS_a_false_tranquility_desc: "We have, do, and will continue to walk a difficult tightrope. The barbarity of the German knows no end, and every success our fighters achieve brings with it a terrible cost in reprisals against our citizens. The Germans do not consider us fully human, and so we must act with consideration and restraint.\n\nWe must take care to present a false sense of tranquility, and so prevent such atrocity. But at the same time we will watch, learn, and wait. In every forest, outpost, arms depot, town, railway station, and city, we will have eyes and ears. When the time comes, we will be ready."
 UKS_lessons_of_the_long_march_desc: "The nineteen fifties were dark days in Ukraine. Our union which had delivered us from our oppression from the Russian Czar had fallen and replacing it was the brutal and relentless boot of the Teuton. Ukraine did not take its oppression lightly and immediately took up arms as directed by what remained of the old authorities. Many Ukrainians fell in the fight. It seemed hopeless. And yet hope emerged once more. From the east, the Red Army surged again and distracted the occupiers long enough for Ukraine to finally realize its long-sought-after freedom.\n\nBut alas, it was not to be. The few times we won against the superior German arms we would in our liberated territories be mercilessly attacked and our fighters annihilated. We were immature, inexperienced young fools desperate for freedom yet without the means to achieve it.\n\nIt is different now. We have changed and we have learned. Our men have cut their teeth against the Germans for long enough to make it a science, we have agonized over our mistakes enough to say where we went wrong and never do those things again. We shall liberate and hold Ukraine without our past mistakes."
 UKS_ensure_force_regularity_desc: "It is one thing to fight a partisan war, it is another to wage war on the scale needed to liberate Ukraine. Our time to transition to such a type of warfare is drawing short, and we must acknowledge that our current partisan units are insufficient.\n\nOur brave men and women must now transition from guerillas into hardened soldiers, capable of matching the Wehrmacht, diminished as it is under the Reichskommissariat. There comes a time that partisans must become soldiers, and guerillas a true military. This time is rapidly approaching.\n\nSuch a significant transition will require strict oversight by our high command, and strong leadership from the General Staff. There is no more time to waste, it is time for the Red Army to rise once more."
 UKS_limited_command_decentralization_desc: "No fighting force is perfect, no soldier or partisan is without the potential for improvement - but it would be a grievous mistake to believe that our partisan commanders who've fought for two decades lack the skills we need.\n\nThey know the land, they know their soldiers, and they know their limits. Imposing the will of the exiled General Staff is a recipe for disaster, risks alienating commanders, bypasses operational needs, and implies we lack faith in our people.\n\nAll these commanders need is additional training to enhance their skills, be they operational, tactical, or logistical - which we can provide. It is critical that they be empowered to operate as they deem necessary. The Wehrmacht has demonstrated that this approach can work - and we shouldn't be afraid to do it better."
 UKS_from_partisans_to_a_red_army_desc: "The professionalization of our forces continues apace, and great progress has been made in all categories but one: combined arms warfare.\n\nThe reasons are numerous, all ultimately stemming from the subpar conditions we find ourselves in. However, the fact remains that this knowledge and training is fundamental to winning a modern war. The Wehrmacht will not hesitate to use every advantage against us, and one clear advantage they possess is knowledge of this doctrine of war.\n\nFortunately, there exists a solution, albeit a difficult one. In Kazakhstan there exist military academies with exiles who can teach these strategies. We will send our best officers and men there, so they can employ every tank, aircraft, and artillery piece to their maximum potential."
 UKS_end_our_absence_desc: "The West Russian War resulted in the decimation of most of our influence in Ukraine, with only the eastern regions and those bordering Odesa remaining feasible for operations.\n\nWhile this retreat was necessary, it has resulted in difficulties, including a strained relationship with the existing Russian minority, and called into question our claim to Ukraine itself. Yet even after two decades of propaganda against us, we retain sympathizers across Ukraine, even in the west.\n\nThese sympathies are strongest in Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Volyn, and Makysm Korniychuk, the regional partisan commander, is confident this support can be turned into manpower. When the time comes, he is confident a force can be raised, and men will once more rally to the banner of the Socialist Republic."
 UKS_a_three_decade_tragedy_desc: "The Ukrainian Insurgent Army is a force which some might see as an ally in our struggle for Ukrainian liberation, yet their actions show the danger they pose to us, and any true friend of Ukraine.\n\nFrom their inherently hateful ideology, to their total slaughter of Jews, to the tragedies in Volyn and Eastern Galicia, they are little more than a hateful band of raiders masquerading as freedom fighters - and we are hardly the only ones to see the results of their brutality.\n\nThe peasantry in Volyn and Galicia who supported them have seen their support begin to wane as a result of the UPA's methods. When these regions were occupied by Poland, these same peasants were strong supporters of the Communist Party. With their support to the UPA fading, perhaps they can join us again."
 UKS_a_four_decade_farce_desc: "Perhaps the greatest mistake made during our liberation of the western lands was the belief we could trust the UNDO - bourgeois Ukrainians who once ruled Galicia. A mistake we came to regret when they betrayed the Socialist Council Republic. Their treason left them helpless to stop the Germans afterwards - but remnants remain, in the form of the UNRA.\n\nThis group is a deceptive, malicious gang of Polish collaborators who dare to champion Ukrainian freedom. Their understanding of 'liberty' would entail only the exploitation of the Ukrainian worker by one of his own.\n\nThey are incompatible with our own vision, but unlike the UPA, they command some genuine loyalty from both peasants and bourgeoisie - a fact that will make dislodging them more difficult than the UPA."
 UKS_discredit_their_causes_desc: "For as many years as we have been fighting, we have been suffering the baseless accusations of our internal enemies - the UNRA and the UPA both. They claim that we are relics of the past. Relics of Moscow. Relics of failure. That they, as a result, are the true inheritors of Ukraine.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. We are the ones who unified our language. Who fought Polish incursions in Volynhia. Who have fought the German for over twenty years. Who have never collaborated as they have. We are the righteous, not they, and we will ensure that the people know this."
 UKS_demonstrate_their_impotence_desc: "Both the UPA and UNRA offer promises and visions of a Ukraine free from German or Russian domination. It is a respectable goal, one which we share - yet the hard truth is that neither can achieve it. The Reichskommissariat's forces are considerable, despite their separation from Germany. To defeat them will be no easy task, and one only we are equipped to handle.\n\nWhile they only have collaborators, scattered, inexperienced partisans, led by old, fading generals from the era of the People's Republic, our forces have prepared four decades for this moment. While their influence ends at the borders of Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr, we have widespread support throughout the country.\n\nFor any who truly wish to see the Reichskommissariat fall, and Ukraine to be free, we are their only option."
 UKS_contact_the_remnants_desc: "It would be a mistake to say that Ukraine has enjoyed perfect relationships with the members of the Union over the course of our existence, with Russia in particular. At the same time, there exists an unbreakable bond between the Communists of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.\n\nToday our military officers are trained in academies in Kazakhstan. We share equipment with Moskowien partisan groups. We disseminate knowledge, tactics, and strategies with Belarusian partisans. We support our comrades as best we can, just as they support us. All for the cause, all for freedom.\n\nOur hour of struggle draws close. Now we live, die, and face the future together.\n\nWe did so then, we do so now."
 UKS_tap_the_pipeline_desc: "It is widely known that a smuggling empire exists within the borders of the Reich's eastern territories. One of the largest smuggling pipelines is one that flows through Ukraine into Moscowien, where thousands of illegal weapons are sold on the Black Market to partisans, criminals, and the common corrupt German official.\n\nAs the day of the revolution approaches, we find ourselves in a deficit of weaponry. To alleviate this issue, we will routinely ambush convoys using the pipeline, seizing massive caches of weapons to fuel our war effort."
 UKS_assemble_the_uprising_desc: "The time is fast approaching. The continuing disintegration of the occupation state is clear to all, and when speaking of revolution the only talk is of when, not if. We must make the final preparations in order to be ready for that time.\n\nThe militias will be called up, assembled, armed, and moved to the prepared attack points. Ordinarily the Germans would intercept and destroy them - but they are far too busy to do so right now. Far too distracted. That is most excellent, indeed."
 UKS_1918_once_more_desc: "The wheels of history turn and groan, as we make ready to achieve our destiny.\n\nAs the Ukapists, Borotbists, and Ukrainian Bolsheviks did in 1918, we now also stand ready to overthrow and expel a German-supported reactionary regime, while Berlin is engulfed in turmoil. Our chance is here, and as we succeeded then, we shall succeed now.\n\nThere is no doubt that the forces aligned against us are considerable, but our forces are prepared, the Communist Party is united, and our resolve is steadfast, for we have something no others have. The Ukrainian people stand at our side, and together, we march to seize our liberation.\n\nThe die is cast, and history will soon say if we have done enough."

 UKS_vindicate_long_march_desc: "In spite of the Nazis' worst efforts to stamp out the Soviet Union, the heirs to the Bolshevik Revolution still survive. They have returned to see that their arch enemy now reap the whirlwind.\n\nThe defining adventure of KPU, The Long March, was a crucible no sane man should be forced to endure. Securing Eastern Ukraine from the Wehrmacht control, brutal and chaotic as it was, will forever stand as testament to the now renewed Socialist Republic; the people of the Diniper have finally stood up, revolting against decades of unforgivable subjugation. With Ukraine now collapsed into anarchy, we must act swiftly. Be it sweet victory or bitter defeat, the forces of the KPU remain steadfast for what comes as the revolution is reignited once again."
 UKS_liberate_downtrodden_desc: "There is not an inch of earth left in Ukraine where the atrocities of the Nazis are invisible to us; from the road checkpoints, to the weapons plants and the ever-endless rows of barbed-wire fences. The victims of the Third Reich's twisted dream in the Breadbasket lay all around us, desperate for any chance to unleash hell on the Germans for their crimes against the people.\n\nThis moment has finally arrived, and the men of the KPU are more than happy to indulge their countrymen in vengeance. No longer will the iron grip of Fascism dictate their lives, but the combined strength of a united, brotherly community! The rumbling of the factory lines shall roar across the plains; the cracks of our rifles sounding the end of Prussian domination!"
 UKS_swing_clubs_pull_triggers_desc: "Even as the Civil War is raging, the German settlers in Ukraine still greedily cling to the food supply of the Breadbasket. The main beneficiaries of Nazi tyranny in the region, stuffing their bellies with while our countrymen starve; grain ripped from our soil, worked by our people and watered with our tears.\n\nIf there is even a single shred of empathy in these Germans, they know our pressing need for food for our soldiers. If they have any reservations towards Germania for their treatment of our people, they will not interfere with the seizure of their stores.\n\nTragically, this is scarcely the sentiment felt by the settlers on the Dnieper. Ensuring our food security must take precedence, whatever contempt or sympathies either of us may have; we are all far too familiar with the Reich's' methods of coercion, something the German civilians ought to pray we do not reciprocate..."
 UKS_empty_warehouses_desc: "For all their insufferable bluster, the Nazis seemed to care very little for the infrastructural upkeep of their colonial empire. Storehouses and workshops filled with German arms and equipment sit abandoned by the Wehrmacht, even as they scramble in desperation to hold onto the Breadbasket. What had been the arsenal of hatred to condemn us to oblivion, now becomes the fulcrum for our expulsion of the Third Reich from our native lands!"
 UKS_khvylovy_plan_desc: "Mykola Khvylovy knows the power that propaganda can have in rousing the spirits of our fellow countrymen, a tool the Germans themselves wield with begrudging effectiveness. With the Reichskommissariat in open collapse, and Germany's manufactured superiority over Ukrainians irrevocably shattered, now it is our turn to rally the nation to the banner of Socialism once more!\n\nEvery road worker, housewife, farm hand, and office clerk from Kyiv to the Black Sea will burn red with the fire of revolution! The International, the Sacred War, and Polyushka Polye will boom from the throats of every man, woman, and child in our great country! Lift up your voices and sing with the souls of a million dead by German hands; ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS!"
 UKS_exploit_enthusiasm_desc: "While a number of our countrymen do not look back fondly on the era of Bukharin, the advent of the German occupation has driven many young Ukrainians back into the arms of the KPU. Whether it's in the fields, in the factories or in the army, the whole of our nation stands defiant against the Prussian menace.\n\nGermany will look on in fear as their old enemy crests the hills in the distance; Young Ukrainians marching in the tunics of their grandfathers, rifles in their hands and fury in their hearts. The children of Kyiv hold their fists to the sky, grasping the Hammer and Sickle in their hands as it rises above the Dnieper for all the world to see!"
 UKS_snap_wires_cut_fuses_desc: "If the might of the old Soviet Union had anything over the Third Reich, it was a talent for subterfuge. The saboteurs and spy rings of the Kremlin were among the best in the world, whose methodology can be replicated for similar tactics against the present German enemy.\n\nThe Reichskommissariats were already the very embodiment of mismanagement and neglect, even well before the outbreak of the Civil War. The holes in the German-built infrastructure are just waiting to be exploited; a snipped telegraph wire here, a missing supply truck there. Even the strongest chain has a weak point and we know just where to wield the cutter..."
 UKS_industrial_base_sand_desc: "The real purpose of the Reichskommissariat of Ukraine was hardly hidden from the naked eye. The disturbing avarice of the Germans saw our countrymen as little more than weeds amidst their prized crops, showing more infatuation with the dirt beneath our feet than for any of the lives that tread upon it.\n\nOne can assume this did not engender the Germans towards widespread industrial development in the Breadbasket, given the Nazi regime's preference for preserving a twisted version of Ukraine's traditionally agrarian economy. Any effort to build up local industry must come from our hands alone, a development plan the KPU is more than qualified to begin cultivating."
 UKS_patriotic_army_slaves_desc: "Our countrymen are hardly the only victim of Nazi expansionism, even here amongst the hills and fields. From seemingly every land touched by the German advance, slaves from across the East were shipped into and out of Ukraine to tend the crops of the Nazi Breadbasket. From fellow Slavs, to destitute Jews to even Germans expatriots, all united by their cruel bindings as they are in their hatred of the Fatherland.\n\nWith gaps in frontlines beginning form, there are only so many places our soldiers can be at once. This is where the liberation of the slaves dovetails with the revolution; those willing among the labor force of the Third Reich will form into special divisions alongside our army, where we might fight side by side to break the shackles of our mutual oppressor."
 UKS_form_militias_desc: "The remnants of Ukraine's Red Army ranks among the best fighting forces in the world, much like their former comrades in Russia. Between the Long March to the east and decades spent subverting Nazi rule in the region, time and experience has forged them into a nigh-unbreakable fighting force. Time is not on our side however, for the youngest of our small group of fighting men are aged in their mid-to-late 40s and upwards. This is not conducive for the longevity of any army, nevermind under the crushing pressure ours is to see the Wehrmacht defeated.\n\nThe only other option to shore up our frontlines lines with the Ukrainian people themselves, the very lifeblood of the revolution that is our reason for fighting. They might be as untrained for modern war as they are terrified of the Germans across no man's land, but they know the score as well as we do, and the terrible price we would be made to pay if we fail..."
 UKS_frontline_fritz_desc: "With the Germans so obsessed with securing Ukraine for their decrepit colonial empire, it is deeply ironic that the single most effective weapon against the Nazis is the land itself. The sheer size of the region combined with its mostly flat terrain creates a frontline that reminds one of the First World War, where there is seemingly always more and more of a line to defend no matter how far a trench is dug.\n\nMeanwhile partisans alligned with our cause attack the German supplies behind enemy lines, depriving the Hun's of crucial resources.\n\nThe cracks in the German lines are already forming, exposing routes to their supply lines to be harried by our militias. With their depos under siege, we will starve the Wehrmacht of the weapons and ammunition needed to fight."
 UKS_wait_galicia_desc: "Ukraine is not the only Reichskommissariat to taste the fires of war, for to our west lies our captive Slavic brethren in Poland have similarly collapsed into Civil War along with most of Eastern Europe. While the plight of the Ukrainian population in Galicia brings pain to our hearts, the war in the Breadbasket and the Wehrmacht demand our attention first.\n\nYet even as our Civil War is still raging, we can still provide some manner of succor for the Ukrainians and other Slavs fleeing Poland. By setting up spaces for humanitarian aid camps and keeping food and medical supplies at the ready, we will be able to withstand the inevitable flood of refugees from the west as they cross our mutual border.\n\nAnd when the war in Galicia is resolved, and whichever force remains standing and licking their wounds, we will pounce like a wolf and devour the foe."
 UKS_if_you_want_soon_desc: "As the months tick by and the Civil War continues ramping up, many are worried the conflict might drag on for years. Even if the morale of the civilian population and the soldiers were infinite, it is only a matter of time before Germany recovers from their own civil war, at which point they will begin reenforcing the holdouts of the Werhmacht in Ukraine. The clock is ticking loudly as the fighting in the Breadbasket grows nastier by the hour.\n\nThe leadership of the KPU has decided on a grand offensive against the Germans opposite our lines, hoping to wrongfoot the enemy and perhaps secure a swift victory. The KPU government will spare no expense in either grain or ammo as the army is reinforced, steeling itself for the onslaught to come. We must brace ourselves; this operation will either shift the moment in our favor, or result in a defeat that we may never recover from..."
 UKS_top_down_training_desc: "The reality of the revolution's origins does lend itself to the kind of professional drilling and training that our enemies in the Wehrmacht receive, given that so many of our most experienced veterans are needed desperately on the frontlines. This is not to say we are in a dearth of men capable of rearing a new generation of soldiers, yet it is not enough to merely teach a man to fire a rifle or to dress a wound.\n\nUkraine needs heroes, true icons to the cause of the people. Not just in vague or abstract terms, but on a very real and deeply human level. The partisans of the KPU have no shortage of men who can fill these roles, such is the demand of the revolution to oust the Nazis from our land. Through funding and restructuring our facilities around these legendary revolutionaries, it will serve to stiffen the moral of our infantry and ensure the soldiers receive the best training we can muster."
 UKS_long_march_paces_desc: "It was the trail of the Long March to the east that brought the Socialist Republic back from oblivion, for it served as an example of the perseverance of the remnants of Ukraine's Red Army. In this darkest of hours, the soldiers of the KPU learned to scrounge and scavenge for all they could get their hands on. Even as the Wehrmacht bared down on them, Ukraine's Red Army proved ever resourceful in snatching food and weapons out from under the Germans and their cohorts.\n\nThese tactics have proven invaluable in feeding our war machine, ones that may well be vital to ultimately driving the Germans out. As the Civil War enters the next phase, we can already see the Wehrmacht begin to falter. Some among us may still have reservations over the heavy handedness in which we secure food and ammunition, but cannot afford to be stingy with victory so close at hand..."
 UKS_autobahn_frontline_desc: "At the center of the Reich's monolithic infrastructure sits the Autobahn, a highway network linking Germany with the colonies to the east. Millions have been worked to death to build and maintain this road, a grim monument to Adolf Hitler's lebensraum.\n\nIf it were difficult to admire such a monstrosity for all the blood mixed in with its asphalt, the bloodshed still staining the road red even doesn't help either. Yet the Autobahn represents a rare avenue (somewhat literally) in which one of the Reich's work projects can be of benefit to the people they've butchered to build them; The Autobahn provides a vital lifeline for troop movements, both for us and the Wehrmacht. Countless have already been cut down to secure control of the roads, and more will be lost before the highways are finally captured by the Red Army."
 UKS_wartime_harvesting_desc: "The Civil Wars has been an utter quagmire of human misery from the outset, only growing worse as the months tick by. It will not be long before our grain supplies are exhausted, if not eaten up by the Red Army on the march, then by being snatched up by the Hun should our battlelines be forced back.\n\nThere are still volunteers and conscripts behind the lines in reserve in case of something like this, ones that will need to be utilized effectively with the war still undecided. They will be sent out into the farms and fields to tend to the harvest, gathering up as much of the Breadbasket's prized crop as they can.\n\nThis will have to suffice to shore up our food reserves, to prepare ourselves for the final push against the Germans."
 UKS_disease_vermin_desc: "While it pains our countrymen on a deeply personal level, the Germans are not the only enemy we face on the battlefield. Reactionary militarists and disaffected republicans have been as busy managing the frontlines of the war as surely as we and the Wehrmacht have, clinging to equally outmoded and repugnant ideals that would lead our country to ruin.\n\nWe cannot afford regret in a war; Action is required, action that requires men requiring food and supplies to sustain both. The Nationalist and Republican partisans have holdouts within our territory, ones who are hogging more than their fair share of Ukraine's grain stores.\n\nWar, Famine and Death already reign supreme in the Breadbasket, it is only fitting that Pestilence should finally join them as the Civil War reaches a terminus..."
 UKS_handful_chips_desc: "This war has dragged on far longer than even the most fatalistic predictions of our initial estimations, for there are only a few tricks we have left to pull to catch the Nazis off balance. The only solace is the knowledge that the enemy is equally stretched to their limits, even the German's dogma of battlefield superiority is rendered hollow by the threat of hunger.\n\nWe have been reduced into triaging the already dwindling resources at our disposal, at a time where ammunition, food and morale are at an all time low. There is an admittedly unsavory tact we can take to shore up our dwindling supply: Ukrainian grain remains a cash crop even in war, one that the nations across the Black Sea and Transnistria would be willing to barter for in exchange for weapons shipments to the Red Army."
 UKS_raise_stakes_desc: "Ukraine's crowded hour is drawing to a close; there is not a man on the frontlines or behind that can't see it, all can see the end of the conflict on the horizon. The Wehrmacht is spent, the Nationalists on the run, and the Republicans scattered to the hinterlands. Only the Red Army and KPU have any resolve left to see this through.\n\nThis is where preparation for the final push against the enemy is most vital, for the greatest weapon we have remains the people of Ukraine. With hearts wrought from flint and wills made of adamant, the Red Army pools their manpower. Trucks are on the move, weapon emplacements are erected, snipers are lining up their scopes to the far side of the line. The combined might of the Ukraine shall be concentrated for the last assault against the enemy."
 UKS_soviet_supernova_desc: "Memories of the era of '42 and the Nazi advance into the Soviet Union are forever etched in the minds of the Red Army leadership. Anyone witnessed it beheld a nightmare scarcely reserved even for the deepest pits of hell; Wounded men dragged from hospitals into the streets to be hosed down and left to die in the snow. Women and children and the elderly lined up in a pit and shot like animals. The seeds of the Reichskommisarriot, watered in the blood of a generation.\n\nNow arrives a tiller, the people's reaper, that the evil of the Reich are laid bare, undone and be endured no more!\n\nHere arrives the final act of the Socialist Republic. The Nazis seek for us a fate even worse than dying. Let all who stand against us know only the hammer and sickle; may these blessed fields be our graves!"

 UKR_u_ssr_cw.1.desc: ""P-O-T, P-O-T, P-O-T\n\nSomewhere in a small hut near Rostow, a previously silent radio came to life to transmit one single word repeatedly. Partisans already knew the meaning of the word - in a matter of minutes, the soups on the table were eaten, and the people were already gone with rifles and thoughts about the upcoming battles. The thoughts of all the horrors the Germans have inflicted upon their land, and the desire for revenge burned inside them. They were about to liberate Ukraine.\n\nL-O-N-G, L-O-N-G, L-O-N-G\n\nAround a minute later, a similar situation occurred in a house on the outskirts of Donetsk. As the last-minute prayers were finished and the comrades hugged each other - hoping that it won't be the last time they do this - they picked up the weapons and went to the streets, preparing to face the death, the occupiers, the bastards in grey uniforms. They were about to avenge their parents. They were about to liberate Ukraine.\n\nH-E-A-R-T, H-E-A-R-T, H-E-A-R-T\n\nIn Luhansk, another radio transmitted the message across the flat with a partisan and his wife carefully listening to it. Despite all of his beloved one's protests, all must-you-really-goes, the man knew he had to fulfill his duty, his promise to his son, sleeping calmly in the other room. He was about to leave his family behind for their own sake, to bring back joy in their lives, to finally make the love of his life smile again.""

 UKR_u_ssr_cw.2.desc: "Peaking out of her foxhole, Ivana held up her stuttering hand to block the morning sun. She could almost see the bunker, a mere kilometer away. The crackling gunfire could be seen in the remaining dark, a fiery strobe across the surrounding countryside. The fortification was impeccably designed, its placement at the top of a hill with large stretches of open countryside made it the perfect vantage point for triangulating fire and air support enough to strangle the revolution in its cradle.\n\nNonetheless, this should've been easy, a silent night raid on a group of lazy drunk garrison guards. For all the rumors of the partisans as apex predators, boogeymen to scare the welps of Kraut settlers, in reality too many of them were nothing more than scared farmers, with little training and even less supplies. This was the third charge this evening that the garrison had repelled after a teenager in their band misfired his weapon on the approach.\n\nThe Commissar had called for volunteers for these suicide missions, throwing around the usual words about the inevitable worker's victory and the triumph of soviets. None of it was particularly convincing to her, who was still in diapers when the Germans invaded. Indeed if it wasn't for her Polish mother she likely would be with the nationalists.\n\nSeeing the last remnants of the offensive scramble back to the partisan lines, Ivana couldn't help, but feel a pang of guilt. The faces of these boys and girls, hardly much older than her baby brother, running or in some cases limping for their lives. She knew after the Commissar ran out of volunteers, he would start waving that pistol around and making demands. More kids ground up in Hitler's buzz saw for some dead ideals.\n\nIvana made up her mind. When the Commissar ordered the next charge she would be the first in line, no more cowardice, no more hiding.

The squad's breath was ragged from their continued success, having advanced the frontlines significantly, yet success could not feed a man or give him rest. The squad leader stopped for a second, in the quiet he could hear calves bawling, their oasis was close as he commanded his men to follow him towards it.\n\nTheir entry to the farm was met with no resistance, the mud tracks told a story of a German garrison fleeing to protect those considered more important than mewling Dutchmen. The Wehrbauern left on their stolen land prayed for the communists to just pass them by, prayers left unanswered as the squad began to reclaim what once belonged to them.\n\nThe soldiers made their way into their new homes while the occupiers pleaded with them in broken Ukrainian as their beer, food and valuables were reclaimed by the hungry. This hunger was far from material. The settlers were forced out of their homes and hiding spots for an important announcement from the commissar.\n\n"By order of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, your possessions have been requisitioned and you have all been charged with the crime of theft of Ukrainian land and property, the sentence is the revokement of your citizenship to be carried out immediately. For those who stay, the sentence will be death."\n\nProtests were met with rifle butts as they were escorted out by gunpoint.

 UKR_u_ssr_cw.4.desc: "Germans never run.\n\nThrough ambushes at the dead of night, and firefights under the boiling sun, the men in the grey uniforms fought or died. Even their retreats were masked by the thunder of artillery and air bombs, and then they always came back after, to tear back whatever blackened and bruised land remained. Night stars twinkled in the distance as the last staccato bursts of gunfire rang out, and then, silence. They had melted away into the darkness. A muffled roar rippled through the distance, getting louder.\n\nSharp instincts and nothing more had kept Corporal Ruslan alive through weeks of combat, and it was these instincts, a quiet voice just behind his ear, that tensed in a quiet scream. The other soldiers laughed and fired wildly into the air, celebrating the liberation of a shredded husk of a village. There was barely any cover, and far too many scattered pieces of dry wood. The pressed metal of his gun still felt cold, except for the barrel. The roar grew louder.\n\nOne of the new recruits drew closer. It was a young boy with peach fuzz on his chin, barely older than sixteen. As he crooked his head, the corporal finally saw the planes flying past the horizon. The sound shook the earth and heat engulfed his head. The boy opened and closed his mouth, but it was too late. He turned and ran, dropping his gun, dropping his hat, blindly into the distance, as he felt the world behind boil into colour. Dancing barely ahead of him, the air grasped and singed and tore at his back, swallowing everything that breathed.\n\nThat night, the village lit up the countryside for hours. Even when the houses had been reduced to dust, the ashes burned endlessly, sticking to their bones like glue. There had been only one survivor of the platoon. One of the medics tried questioning him.\n\nRuslan stared into the sky as the last embers of the napalm died down."

 UKR_u_ssr_cw.5.desc: "Olga's village had never had much - not even a name. The closest distinct place was Lukiv, and so everyone simply called the few houses huddled together at its outskirts a part of it too. But there had been him. A husband, married partly out of love, and partly out of necessity. His face was pock-marked and rugged, but there was strength in his arms, and the determination to forge a life. Not necessarily a better one, but a life nonetheless. Or so she thought.\n\nAmbition lurks deep within the heart, and sometimes it takes others to bring it out. It had been only a few months after the wedding, and Olga was with child. And he had decided, out of some foolish determination to 'build a better future for them', that there was room for one more soldier in Ukraine's ranks. There had been no discussion, no argument - simply tears, congratulations from the women, cheers from the men, and then - silence. The house went quiet. Only the anxieties in her chest and the occasional stirring of the baby kept her company.\n\nThere was an old saying in the nameless village that had died a few generations in the past. 'Destiny works fast, but her absence works faster.' He had died almost immediately, his first action in combat taking a bullet 'in utmost heroics, saving one of his comrades'. One month after the door had closed behind him, it opened again, bringing in a thin wooden casket - a luxury in these times, she was told - and a stiff-faced officer who brought his final pay. A few choked words in the funeral, and that was that. Olga's village had nothing once more."

It was a manor out of a painting, with its painted stone walls, dramatic arches over the windows, ornate verandas, and a host of other ornamental features. Its entrance was flanked by a garden that must've taken dozens of hands to maintain. Overworked, calloused, and cut Ukrainian hands.\n\nThe lie that it was such an ancient building was almost complete until one looked in closely at how smooth the stone was, how pristine the wooden porch was, how young the forest around it was. Matching Vadym's reports, this was the house of a German officer. To his chagrin, Vadym's men were returning from inside with art, money and furniture rather than the bastard's head on a pike. One man was running through the trampled garden, climbing up the hill to meet Vadym. "I take it he wasn't home?" Asked Vadym. The soldier nodded as two more caught up, one of them with a red cloth bundled in his arms.\n\n"No, sir. We've begun... reappropriating, assuming you've cleared that? This was all stolen from us anyway," Replied the man. Vadym nodded, barely a twitch in his expression beyond a quizzical leap of the eyebrow at the sight of the cloth. "Oh, yes! Settle a debate, sir?" He said, oddly excited. Vadym nodded, leaning forward as if to ask him to go on, "It's a German flag. Do we burn it or keep it?"\n\nVadym paused, then produced his pen. He handed it to the man holding the flag, not before waiting for him to unfurl it. He stared at the pen. "Go ahead," Urged Vadym. The soldier's eyebrows knitted, then separated in turn with his eyes widening in recognition. He grinned and set to work signing the flag, then passing it on to the man beside him. A crowd began to gather as men finished their ransacking, placing down their prizes to take the pen and make their mark. Vadym signed it last, to be taken home once he could return."

Usually, this place near a tiny village a couple of kilometers away from Donetsk has been left alone - today, however, that was not the case.\n\nFive soldiers have appeared on the horizon, carrying three bodies - their comrades, who have fallen in yet another war this land has seen, with one of them also carrying a cross. The men were in a visible hurry; from what old trees could understand, the enemy army was preparing for a counter-attack on a liberated town nearby. They quickly dug out a big hole, carefully laid their brothers-in-arms, prayed for their eternal peace, dropped a few tears on the dry ground, placed a cross, and left, preparing for upcoming battles.\n\nSince the moment the soldiers left, the grave was left untouched, and three friends rested under the shadows of mighty oaks. A year later, when another spring came, a boy and a girl were going through this place, searching for fallen sticks to play with - maybe there were a couple under those big trees? And then, they saw something weird yet beautiful, something they remembered for a long time.\n\nNear the cross, three sunflowers grew."

 UKR_u_ssr_cw.17.desc: "The ground thundered beneath us. Fighting continued almost all the way to Balivka, where the Germans fought from the windows and from sandbags they propped up on the streets. Though we had superior numbers, most of us were armed with old Mosins or the German 98's, which were good for long-distance but oversized at close quarters, and most of the bayonets had rusted away. I knew that if they intended to hold the village, they would have set up snipers on the upper floors, and fixed the machine guns in position; they defended step-by-step, retreating on a schedule, drawing ever closer to the river.\n\nExperience dictated that when the Germans chose not to defend, they would destroy - the question was simply if we could cross before the bombs fell. I held a position behind a porch, well-hidden behind rubble, providing covering fire across the street. The Dnieper roared ahead; we were so close to the river bridge that we could smell the spray. It was a broad, massive bridge, and there was every possibility that it had been rigged to explode underneath, or marked with paint for the planes to target, and at any rate bullets still flew just above our heads, down the street. I waited for an opening, any opening.\n\nThe endless hail of bullets stopped. My forward scouts finally returned, saying that both sides of the bridge were clear on our end. There was a time for marching, but this was not it. I called out to the men, and in groups of three, they ran across the bridge as fast as their legs could carry them. Finally, when they had all crossed, myself and my ammunition-carrier looked once at each other, and ran. In the distance, I could hear planes flying overhead and bullets on either side, but we kept running. In the end our side of the river was devoid of enemies, and though I had orders to continue and secure the forward operating base, in that moment my only regret was that I could not fight for my brothers that died and bled in crossing that great river."

He's heard of the fierce resistance put up by the remnants of the German garrison, but it seemed now that all of their forces were fleeing the city: the helicopters constantly launching at the outskirts of the city and flying away, to the west, were a good sign of that. Some also said that the remaining soldiers and colonizers were on the run, trying to save their life at all costs, or surrendering to the unstoppable wave of Ukrainian fury. Just what those sonovabitches deserve, thought Yarema, for what did they expect after torturing an entire nation for 30 years?\n\nNevertheless, that was not the main thing - yeah, seeing the German rule over Ukraine fall was a pleasure to Yarema, but like everybody else, he cared most for his compatriots, not the nazi oppressors, and oh boy, did they treat former partisans as heroes: flowers, praises, hugs, everything! The people who were under the Reich's jackboot for decades were finally free. No more suffering, no more humiliation, no more deaths--\n\nDeaths. He immediately thought of his father. He was also a partisan, fighting for a more just, brighter future for everyone. Before a Wehrmacht soldier shot him, of course. He thought of his mother, which he left, to avenge his dad and carry on the struggle. Grief was quickly replaced by happiness - with Kyiv now free, the war will be over soon. He will see her again, and they'll rejoice at the liberation of Ukraine. For now, he thought, he needed to rest, and immediately, he saw a gathering of soldiers singing songs just around the corner."

They reminded her of her son and husband, of what her loved ones had fought for years ago and what her son was fighting for now. At that moment, Yaroslava began to wonder if her son was doing fine. She hadn't heard anything from him for the past two or even three months, which caused worrisome thoughts to enter her mind, but she somehow managed to push them aside.\n\nJust then, she heard footsteps behind her.

 UKR_u_ssr_postcw.5.desc: "Mykola never would have believed that the proudest day in his life would involve him marching with a Nazi flag, yet here he was, side-by-side with each of his esteemed comrades as they carried the colors of the fascist occupiers.\n\nFlags, standard and banners of the hated Reich swung low, meeting the ground with the treads of the captured German tanks rolling alongside them, the hate symbols that once adorned these beasts of war were defaced with red. Mykola thought about the fascist swine that paraded these banners, he hoped every last one of them was six feet under.\n\nYet his hate took second place to his pride. Mykola's heart could only swell with emotion as he looked to each side - the men, women and children that they had liberated from the Germans lined the streets of Kyiv, all gathered together to cheer them on for this glorious day. He looked to see Comrade Shumskyi and his loyal Politburo watch over him, taking a brief respite from their busy work to oversee this important day.\n\nFinally, he tossed the enemy's honors that had fouled his nation into the pile in the same manner as every other loyal UA-SSR soldier that was given the privilege of taking part in this ceremony. The crumpled mass sat on the pyre as Mykola watched a veteran of 1923 carry a torch towards the pile.\n\nHe lowered the flame as the symbols of hate were incinerated in a purifying flame, never to terrify another innocent soul again. A wave of applause filled the square as Mykola was satisfied in knowing that even if the Germans were to conquer them once more, they would never be able to reclaim their colours."

 UKR_u_ssr_postcw.6.desc: "At Shumskyi's request, provisional data from the fastest reporting of Ukraine's census districts were forwarded to him. The information was sorely needed. The government was effectively groping around blindly, without a clue of the true state of the country. Even such a basic statistic as the number of people in the country evaded them, beyond the loosest estimates.\n\nBut the arrival of the census data brought no relief. Things were far worse than they had imagined. Famine, war and disease had torn the Ukrainian population to ribbons. Standards of living had regressed to those of the Tsar's time. National income and wealth had collapsed. Property damage was extensive, and would probably take decades to restore entirely.\n\nSome rural areas had all but returned to pre-industrial life, with agricultural capital almost non-existent, and the urban manufacturing base was not exactly about to make up the shortfall anytime soon. This posed the largest problem - Ukraine needed food, both for its people and for export.\n\nOnce the extent of the disaster had been confirmed, Shumskyi decided that it was pointless to wait for the rest of the data to come in. The government had to act now, and act decisively. Hordes of party cadres would need to be dispatched throughout the country to salvage what they could in terms of agricultural equipment, fertilizers, and other necessities.\n\nIf Ukraine's long-suffering agricultural sector was to be saved, drastic measures would need to be taken."

 UKR_u_ssr_postcw.7.desc: "Shumskyi would have been happier if he and the Politburo could meet under more comfortable circumstances, but matters of national integrity were of the utmost importance. Every man in the room was aware of the tragedy of 1921, when Poland stole Galicia from their nation, separating Ukrainian families from their homeland.\n\nThere were those who were apprehensive on the matter, not because they believed Galicia belonged to Poland, but because of the combined circumstances of a returning Germany and their own war-weary status. Some had secretly hoped for an alliance, one never to happen with the reactionary Home Army in control.\n\nThese small protests continued, with the largest topic of debate amongst them being that Ukraine simply could not bear another war. Even if they could take on the Polish, two conflicts in such quick succession could stretch their burgeoning nation to the breaking point. Finally, Roman Rozdolskyi spoke to put an end to the dovish sentiment espoused in the Politburo.\n\n"I was born and bred in Galicia, when it was stolen by the reactionaries, I continued my struggle with the Communist Party of Western Ukraine. Only Germany put a temporary halt to my efforts to liberate the province, I could never forgive myself or the rest of this room if we passed up this chance to reclaim what was ours. I want to go to the grave knowing that we did the right thing."\n\nThe words silenced all dissent from this opinion but to appease those doves, it was decided Poland would be given an ultimatum to surrender Galicia before more martial action would take place. The proposal was passed unanimously as the meeting was adjourned. Shumskyi left with a pessimistic feeling, the Poles were too stubborn to realize that they were far better equipped to defend Galicia, he would just have to wait and see."

And, not so long ago, we threw back the Nazis as well.\n\nIf you would seek to plunge a knife in our back, to exploit our weakness while we are preoccupied with Germany, then by all means try. You will break yourself on our rocks, as many others have done before you.\n\nLong live Poland!"\n\nShumskyi set down the note and stared at the ceiling. Despite what the note suggested, he really did not want to have to fight the Poles. Germany was the greater threat to both of them. But Galicia was Ukrainian territory, pure and simple. It needed to be liberated. After a moment of silent contemplation, he called for a guard.\n\n"Get Zubatenko in here. And tell him to alert the generals that negotiations over Galicia have failed. Military measures will be necessary."\n\nAs the guard dashed out the door, Shumskyi wondered sadly how many deaths could have been avoided, had the Poles just been a little less intransigent."

Warm golden rays bathed the scene - a sun rising in the east. If only.\n\nGalicia was theirs, though undoubtedly in a sorry state. Decades of neglect and intermittent racial conflict had devastated the region, even compared to the rest of the abattoir that was eastern Europe. The entire area would need repopulating and rebuilding - fortunately, there was no lack of displaced people in Ukraine proper.\n\nShumskyi put down the poster. The bloody work was done. The Poles wouldn't be returning anytime soon. For all the hard work ahead, that was something to celebrate - for perhaps the first time since the Rus, all of Galicia was under Ukrainian control.\n\nNow, to keep it."

The power struggle in Germania was coming to an end and already opportunistic generals sought their place in the sun reconquering the East.\n\nThe rest of the meeting was spent discussing what could be done. Proposals were suggested regarding partisan networks, battle tactics and war communism, but it quickly became clear no one was able to discuss such matters after the latest disclosure from the Reich. Everyone bar Shumskyi left the room to reconvene later, hoping to spend time with whatever family they had left first.\n\nHe looked outside the window at a Kyiv hued in orange sunset, the ruined city was only rebuilding itself now. It would take years for it to be restored to its former glory, it would be ground down to dust any day now. His mind was ablaze with the horrors that would befall the Ukrainian people, he wondered how it could be worse than what they had already experienced.\n\nHe touched the glass as he spotted children playing amongst the rubble. In another time, they could have grown up with their parents, gone to school, fallen in love, and raised a happy family before passing away in cozy beds. Shumskyi listened to their laughter but he could only return to a familiar feeling..."

 # Lyudmila Events
 UKR_u_ssr_pavlichenko.1.t: "Hero of the Union"
 UKR_u_ssr_pavlichenko.1.desc: "Lyudmila Pavlichenko's first sensation was not of pain but a cold numbness that began in her forearm and trickled its way past her wrist and toward her trigger finger. It felt to her like someone had pressed a wasp into her skin, as if—heartbeat by heartbeat—something was pumping venom deeper into her veins. She allowed herself a moment to look out of the scope of her sniper rifle to her arm, only to find—.\n\n"Oh." She said it with perfect casualness. Her arm had a hole in it. And through ruptured flesh and severed bone, she could see the blue sky of the perfect morning. She marveled at the strangeness of it before throwing herself from her sniper's perch.\n\nSeveral large cracks echoed through the air above as she fell through tree branches and brambles. Tumbling, she was aware of the world becoming alight, of her comrades shouting cries of fear and surprise, of Hitlerites advancing through the forest. Plans of an assault melted away, replaced in an instant with a dark realization: Someone had talked. The Germans had preempted her squad's surprise assault with one of their own.\n\nThere was a loud, unnatural crunch as she hit the ground. There was no moment to hesitate as she forced herself to her feet against the tree. She attempted to grab the small pistol from its side holster. She watched the muscles in her arm spasm and contract but the arm hung useless at her side. The only feeling was of a cold, constant numbness.\n\n"Fuck." She whispered. She reached across her body and fumbled with the gun. "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck."\n\nLyudmila Pavlichenko, killer of Nazis, hero of the long-dead Soviet Union, found herself fleeing through the forest like a wounded animal. Her only thought was of her husband and her promise to him to fight the Hitlerites until her last breath."

 UKR_u_ssr_pavlichenko.2.desc: "Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the most decorated sniper of the former Soviet Union, did not know how long she'd run after the firefight. Her memory was of a blur of branches and her own ragged breathing, of stumbling through deserted towns and villages with her useless arm dangling beside her. She was sure that the Hitlerites would soon be upon her. It was only when she arrived in Donetsk and was able to get herself in front of a doctor (a patriot but too young to have any real credentials) that she could think clearly again. And being able to think was an awful thing.\n\n"I don't know what to do now," she said. She was walking along the city's shoreline, her pus-stained, bandaged arm looped in front of her beneath her coat. "I feel useless."\n\nHer friend, the doctor, gave her a curious expression. "Oh? Well, I hope you aren't planning on doing anything that would waste all the supplies I used for your treatment." There was a pause. She stared out at the sea. "I'm sorry, that was a poor joke."\n\n"When my husband Kitsenko died, I made a promise that I would destroy the Hitlerites until my dying breath. For so long, I made good on that promise. I became a sniper. I became good at it. I felt like I was doing something for the future and now..." She attempted to squeeze her bandaged hand. She felt no movement. "What do I do? Go back to the kitchen? Play the role of a good housewife until the Nazis kill us all?"\n\nThe doctor said nothing for a long time. She wondered if he was old enough to remember anything about the Union or if he thought of it like a fairy tale kingdom, a dream of ages long past.\n\n"Lyudmila, I can't promise you'll ever be as good a sniper as you were, but I don't think you'll ever stop fighting. Even if it seems impossible, you're too stubborn to give up." She turned to see him give a weak smile. "Do what you can. It is always worth it to fight for those who will inherit the earth long after we're gone.""

 UKR_u_ssr_pavlichenko.3.desc: "Lyudmila Pavlichenko, once the greatest sniper in the former Soviet Union, stared at the blank page, then at the dull gray sky outside visible through the window of her ramshackle Donetsk apartment, then back at the page. Heat radiated from her cheeks. Even though she had once attended Kyiv University with dreams of being a teacher, of being a historian, returning to journaling felt like a step backward.\n\nShe got up from her chair and circled like a fox looking for traps.\n\nWhy was she doing this? Because her doctor friend had told her that writing might give her some relief? That putting her thoughts on paper might provide some distraction from the Hitlerites as they made a ruin of her homeland? That it might make her feel less useless when pain prickled through her mangled arm, a reminder of her broken pact and dashed ambitions? What a pathetic thing to do! She might as well pick up cross-stitching like some pathetic, cow-eyed bourgeois woman waiting for her husband to return home from fighting.\n\nShe gripped the chair tight with her one working hand. She breathed in and then out, counting each exhale as she had once done from the safety of her crow's nests. She released her grip.\n\nThere were, of course, men who kept track of their thoughts and actions. Gramsci had written, even as he rotted in prison. Lenin had too as his body failed him. Countless Soviet generals had shared their stories after the War. Was she so haughty as to believe herself superior to all of them? Why was she regurgitating old, oppressive myths about what was and was not "womanly?"\n\nShe forced herself to sit back down and pick up a pen. Even as her brain screamed about how stilted the prose was and how shallow her thoughts were, she made herself keep writing."

With her fragile arm, only barely able to bend, she felt like a porcelain doll about to be packed into a box and shipped off. Still, she stood firm and at attention in the darkened room as a man in ratty uniform sat in front of her burning through cigarettes.\n\n"Lyudmila Pavlichenko," He said. He let the name hang in the air like an incantation. "You've been out of combat for some time, haven't you?"\n\n"I was shot, comrade general." She moved her arm delicately, still half-afraid it might shatter from too much movement. "I got treated. I waited for the Hitlerites to lose my trail. I started writing and doing what I could to mobilize the party in Kharkiv."\n\nShe said it matter of factly, as if this last duty had not been forced on her. After she'd started writing her journal—something she'd taken to mockingly describing as her "penance"—her doctor friend had insisted she circulate her thoughts in underground papers. Even if the words weren't perfect, he'd whispered in his high, boyish voice, what better way to inspire the people than to let them know that Lady Death still lived? That she not only continued to fight but she remained true to the Soviet Union? Truly, it would give new life into the resistance, he'd insisted.\n\n"I read one of your articles. It wasn't terrible." The general flicked his cigarette into an overflowing ashtray, then he looked at her. "The people in charge would like to offer you a promotion. It's not going to come with pay or a fancy uniform, but it will put you at the center of the resistance..." He let smoke escape through his nostrils. "And the center of the danger."\n\nLyudmila kept her face passive. "I will accept any duty to support any duty for the Motherland, comrade general.""

Her fellow revolutionaries needed a beacon, a mascot, that would sustain morale. They needed someone more inspiring than the obscure bureaucrats and decaying partisans that kept the movement functioning.\n\nWhile she had proven herself an effective killer, perhaps the most effective butcher of Nazis since Stalin or Bukharin walked the earth, she had no pretensions possessing any innate ability to lead.\n\nWhich is why she pushed herself to try harder than any of her comrades.\n\n"Move!" She screamed as would-be soldiers pushed their way through the trees and foliage of the Ukrainian wilderness. Was a general meant to oversee training in this way? She didn't know, but she wasn't about to find out later she had failed her duties. She stiffly pointed her injured arm to a series of boards marked with a spray painted X. "Fire!"\n\nThere was a series of percussive explosions as the boards splintered and smoke filled the air. Though she would not admit it to anyone, the sight of her recruits doing so well filled her with a sense of pride. They made her hopeful that she still had something to offer the world after all, that she could be more than just a sniper. Even if she lacked the training and privilege and credentials of others, perhaps she could prove herself to be a leader. There might be a life for her beyond these daily battles.\n\nFor now, though, she pushed the thoughts from her head. There was much work to be done. She would ensure they made history at the Gates of Kyiv."

"And we want you out there doing what you do best—."\n\n"Which is why the Red Army keeps forcing me to read—."\n\n"No one is forcing you to do anything. No one would dream. God, Lyudmila, you were brought out here as a sign of respect. You were the Union's best advocate twenty years ago. There's a reason Bukharin had you touring the United States and Canada to, to—."\n\nHe gestured his arms in a wild, child-like manner, as if to capture the nature of her one-time tour—meeting Eleanor Roosevelt, being denied by President Dewey and his priggish controller Robert Taft, speaking in packed concert halls. What good had that trip done so many years ago when she played along and allowed others to dictate her remarks? What had she achieved when she allowed the cow-eyed American press to ask her about her make-up routine on the frontline? Her face turned red.\n\n"I am not a child. I am a veteran of the Great Patriotic War. I am a General of the Red Army. I have killed 849 fascist invaders," spat Lyudmila. "If you want my voice, my own words need to be behind it. It's the only way I can reach the right people."\n\nThere was a pause. The man gave an exasperated sigh, left the room, then returned with a pen.

Lyudmila Pavlichenko cleaned her rifle, delicately removing and polishing each part and reassembling it.\n\nNot much longer now, she thought.\n\nShe looked at her arm. There was a deep indent where a bullet had entered her arm and a spiderweb-like mass of tissue that spiraled out from it. When she flexed her muscles, there was no longer pain, only the ghost of a feeling.\n\nShe continued to stare at her arm curiously and wondered how long it had been like that. She could remember, as if it were yesterday, when her arm had been rendered mangled and useless by the Hitlerites. She remembered fleeing through the forest to Donetsk, consumed by pain and fear. She remembered the painful treatments and stinking, stained bandages. Now, she felt none of that. She tried to move her fingers and they responded. She balled her hand into a fist.\n\nThere was no more fear. There was no more pain. She felt no anxiety. There was simply the mission ahead of her. She and her comrades would liberate the cities of Ukraine. They would sweep from Rostov to Lviv, eliminating the fascist invaders wherever they were, ripping and tearing the colonizers from the earth. They would root out the vultures and then, at long last, achieve true, genuine freedom.\n\nFrom somewhere far behind her, soldiers began to stir from their stillness. It was time to move forward.

Children played near a sagging, headless statue of Adolf Hitler downtown. Families sifted through the rubble for the ones they had lost.\n\nLyudmila Pavlichenko walked through these scenes feeling a strange sense of peace. Yes, of course, many had died in the battle. Yes, of course, there had been awful losses—the theatre had been razed to the ground, streets remained littered with rubble. Still, there was hope here. From a sagging balcony high above her came the sound of voices, "Long live the Union! Long live the free people of Ukraine!"\n\nScattered throughout the liberated city came other voices, making similar cheers. Even among the ruins, it was the sounds of a city waking up after fighting off a long illness, after a terrible injury.\n\nLyudmila listened to these voices for a moment. She slugged her rifle over her shoulder and smiled. While much work remained ahead, each day alive was its own success."

Fields along the city fringes were waterlogged, apparently the result of some damage to the hydroelectric station some kilometers away.\n\nStill, the atmosphere in Dnepropetrovsk was one of jubilation. After years of living in the shadows, of watching fascist invaders steal their homes and their lands, the people of Ukraine were back on the streets cheering.\n\n"God bless you!" said a small babushka, pressing herself into Lyudmila Pavlichenko's body. "Glory to Ukraine!"\n\n"Glory to the Soviet Union," said Lyudmila gently, freeing herself from the elderly woman's grasp. "Soon all people will be free against the Hitlerite—."\n\n"Glory to Ukraine!" Came the voice of a group of men, slurring their speech and clearly intoxicated. "Glory! Glory! Glory!"\n\n"Please!" Lyudmila tried to make herself heard over the growing din. It was unusual for her, of all people, to be overpowered by this kind of response. "We are here to fight for the cause of the Communist Party and the liberation of the worker against—."\n\nBut it was useless. All around her stood cheering crowds.

It was the continued screams of agony coming from the fleeing Hitlerite invaders. It was the feeling of the gun in her hand as she shot into the back of fleeing fascist invaders and watched them fall into the slurry of snow and mud. She was on top of the cretins. She was remembering holding her dying husband in her arms. She was watching blood trickle out of the man in front of her. And then—.\n\nA great whoop of triumph shook her from her stupor. Even with the street littered with bodies and the last of the Hitlerites vanishing in the distance, the outcome was clear: They had won. The UA-SSR had attained victory. Lyudmila felt a great swell of pride as the figure of two soldiers unlatched an ugly swastika flag and let it fall to a heap onto the street.

All of it, Lyudmila Pavlichenko had tried to soak in before reality crept back in.\n\nAll across Ukraine, there were cities to repair. There were bombed roads and ruined buildings. Hospitals, many still bearing the names of fascists, overflowed with the sick and wounded. From her cramped office off the main square—even weeks later, she was still finding remnants of the Nazi administration—she had a good vantage of all the work that needed to be done.\n\nLyudmila flexed the muscles in her arm and turned from her desk toward the window. In the center of the square below stood an empty pedestal where a Hitler upon a horse had once stood. She smiled, knowing that even with all the work to do, Kyiv was, at long last, free.\n\nUkraine and its people no longer lived in fear of systematic annihilation. They no longer trembled beneath the jackboot. An entire country was breathing free for the first time in decades. In her heart, she felt a sense of peace, a sense that she had finally lived up to the promise she'd made to her husband all those years ago.\n\nLyudmila continued to stare at the square. She did not notice the great bird of prey perched on the building opposite, the red flesh of some animal in its mouth. The enormous bird seemed to stare at Lyudmila in her tiny office for several moments, scowling. Then it opened its terrible black wings and soared westward, away from Ukraine and toward the expanses beyond.\n\nThere, far beyond Lyudmila's sight, things were already moving."

 ### Assorted Laws
 UKS_peace_and_bread_law: "§g§LPeace§! and §jBread§!"
 UKS_peace_and_bread_law_desc: "Peace, Land, and Bread. It was the battle cry of the October Revolution, so every worker and peasant had peace in their country, land to live on, and bread to eat. Following these principles, the Soviet Revolution grew in fertile ground, winning the hearts and minds of the people. These decrees will be building blocks of our new Communist state, since our overall goal is prosperity for all Ukrainians. Prosperity that is only possible through Socialism, of course."

 UKS_monopoly_on_violence_law: "§g§YMonopoly§! of §RViolence§!§!"
 UKS_monopoly_on_violence_law_desc: "According to Max Weber, the state is that which claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory. For the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, their monopoly on violence is making its presence felt through campaigns aimed at purging Ukraine of counter-revolutionary elements and banditry.\n\nSoldiers establish their authority by sweeping through each village and town in search of UNRA or UPA holdouts that continue to defy the authority of the state. The law of the land is being enforced more and more each day as another highwayman finds himself swinging from a tree.\n\nThe Communist Party of Ukraine's threats will soon dissipate, to be replaced with an entrenched revolutionary vanguard firmly in charge of a nation free from reaction."

 UKS_national_ukrainization_0_law: "§gNational §MUkrain§Yization§!§!"
 UKS_national_ukrainization_0_law_desc: "Our national struggle is inseparable from the liberation of the proletariat, so rebuilding our people's identity through National Ukrainization is our priority. The expulsion of Dutch and German colonists from our land, forced land seizures, and removal of Russian, German, and Dutch languages from signs and names will be necessary to achieve this goal. Only Dutch colonists that can be used as bargains will remain. Our Russian comrades must understand that the Ukrainian people are now the vanguard of the Socialist revolution. Even if some Russians will resent us for this, Ukraine will prevail."

 UKS_national_ukrainization_1_law: "§gNational §MUkraini§!§Yzation§!,\n §WRu§!§Dssi§!§San§! Minority Language§!"
 UKS_national_ukrainization_1_law_desc: "Our national struggle is inseparable from the liberation of the proletariat, so rebuilding our people's identity through National Ukrainization is our priority. The expulsion of Dutch and German colonists from our land, forced land seizures, and removal of German and Dutch languages from signs and names will be necessary to achieve this goal. Only Dutch colonists that can be used as bargains will remain. Nevertheless, this process doesn't have to contradict our solidarity with our Russian brothers, as Russian will be the secondary language. This proposal is controversial inside the party, as some patriotic Ukrainian comrades may feel offended by it, but Russians will feel included."
