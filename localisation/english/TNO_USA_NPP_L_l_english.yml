#Gus "Shoot them Down" Hall#

#Leader Description
POLITICS_HALL_DESC:0 "Many words apply to Gus Hall, and "presidential" isn't likely to be one of them. Born Arvo Kustaa Halberg in Minnesota's great Iron Range, he grew up speaking Finnish with nine other siblings, in a frigid log cabin that his immigrant father built after having been driven from work for organizing with the International Workers of the World. Hall himself left school to work in logging camps at the age of 15, to support his family, and soon after joined the Young Communist League. That work with the YCL allowed him to travel to Bukharin's USSR, and Hall spent several years studying at the International Lenin School. Throughout the 1930s, Hall stared down police and bosses at strikes across Minnesota and Ohio, among steelworkers, farmers, and teamsters.\n\nAfter a stint in the Navy during the war against Japan, Hall then spent much of the 1950s being hounded by prosecutors for proposing the overthrow of the US government. He made himself known as a prominent member of the Communist Party of the USA, speaking on college campuses and debating conservatives on live TV. Despite this, Hall seemed doomed to become a marginal figure in American political life. However, the rise of the NPP's leftist faction has propelled him far beyond such margins. Now, after the unlikeliest political triumph in American history, President Hall is seeking to uplift America's marginalized, unite the working class, and create a new America, built for all instead of the few.\n\nGus Hall's presidency takes a radical path. His platform does not just call for raising taxes on the wealthy, but for a near-total restructuring of the United States economy to fulfill his socialist vision. As part of this vision, he seeks to clean out many of the American institutions that have so often been led by reactionaries and conservatives. Socialism wil be promoted the world over, and old imperialist American ambitions will be replaced by a new, red, eagle. Labor unions - that great, old invention - will be restored to the position they once held in industry. Judges supporting egalitarianism and equity will be appointed. Above all else, Hall's presidency seeks to preserve and promote democracy -- even if that means the death of the American system.\n\nMaybe he isn't presidential. But President Gus Hall is certainly aiming to be revolutionary."

WORLD.726.desc:0 "Today, Gus Hall took the oath of office to become the newest President of the United States. In front of a crowd of hundreds of thousands in Washington, President Hall declared: "America must fight for liberation at home from those who line their pockets with the blood of the working class."\n\nA longtime union organizer and member of the Communist Party of the USA, Hall has faced more than one stint in a prison cell for his activities. However, those controversies didn't prevent him from winning the presidency, in one of the greatest shocks in American political history. Already, anti-leftist protests are springing up across the country. President Hall seeks to unite America under the banner of working class liberation, but it's clear that his election has created a divide as vast as any in living memory."

USA.1706.t:0 "The Inauguration of President Hall"
USA.1706.d:0 "The crowd, in all their hundreds of thousands, looks like a fever dream. Labor stalwarts from the UAW have the uneasy grins of those caught up in events beyond belief. Elders, whose parents stared down militiamen at Lawrence, who were lifted up onto the shoulders of others to see Debs speak at Canton, who spent their lives writing and agitating in pursuit of a future they desperately hoped could someday be made real, are watching with glistening eyes. Long-haired students and proudly afroed activists who got their start fighting against the South Africa draft are gathered in circles, taking turns denouncing America and grudgingly congratulating the President-elect. Most of them never thought they would do anything but loathe the American electoral system. Most of them still do, but at the moment, that matters a bit less.\n\nA number of senators and congresspeople have boycotted the inauguration, but the crowd of notables behind President Hall's podium is still large. The Chief Justice administers the oath without enthusiasm, and the crowd roars.\n\n"My fellow Americans, citizens of the world... comrades."\n\nThe crowd roars harder, almost drowning out the new President. Through stump speeches, ballot boxes, door-to-door campaigning, and all the electoral institutions written down by wig-clad slavers, revolution, however tenuous, has come to America."
USA.1706.a:0 "Today, the world shakes once more."

USA_gus_72_thehallresidency_desc:0 "Nobody thought it could happen here, but today, nobody can deny that it has. The United States, the imperial core, the world bastion of capitalist industry, the oldest and most stable bourgeois democracy in the world, has elected a Communist President. Few could have predicted this moment, but the signs were there.\n\nGus Hall's meteoric ascent to the White House has taken place in a perfect storm created by the disastrous previous administrations and the increasingly explosive breakdown of American society. The Endless Proxy Wars, the Civil Rights movement, the wanton attacks on unions, growing distrust in the Federal government, and an explosion of radicalism amongst American youth have combined to make the communist wing of the NPP the final option for many Americans.\n\nNow, Hall must pick up the pieces left by the previous administrations and set about what he was elected to do: Plant in the infertile soil of Capitalist America the seeds of a new, Socialist society."
USA_gus_72_wrangle_the_npp:0 "Wrangle the NPP"
USA_gus_72_wrangle_the_npp_desc:0 "The forces of reaction take poorly to threats against the system they had built, and from which they alone have profited. Their foresight portended one such threat from the unprecedented victories we had earned in 1948; like dragons fearful for their hoarded gold, Capitol Hill's elites lashed out. Sheer desperation compelled the party of Lincoln into forming ranks with slavers and secessionists' sons - and from their union was born a Frankenstein as colossal and abominable as it is laden with historical irony.\n\nNot to be outdone, the few who remain opposed to the Republican-Democrat chimera answered with a corrupt bargain of their own. Party figures both past and present justified the subsequent slaver-secessionist united front by parroting Benjamin Franklin: that we must hang together, or hang separately. Hence America's proletariat compromised their principles to prevent their beloved country from declining into a one-party state. As two intervening decades showed, their sacrifices were repaid with lip service, inaction, and in many cases betrayal.\n\nThe Hall administration enters 1973 with a mandate from the scorned and forgotten. They recall keenly what their solidarity was worth to their 'allies' in Congress. We recall broken promises, empty platitudes, assurances capriciously forgotten when put to task. A reckoning long overdue shall visit the likes of Thurmond and Jackson, Chase Smith and Schlafly, until their pact - our pact - is recast into a front united not just in name, but in will and want as well."
USA_gus_72_memories_of_lincoln:0 "Memories of Lincoln"
USA_gus_72_memories_of_lincoln_desc:0 "There seem to only be a few great revolutions in American history. Points in which, even through the constant resistance of the upper class, the founding ideals of this nation shone through. The meek, if just for a moment, inherited the nation. Of course, these were temporary ordeals. As soon as the working class grabbed a handful of liberty, it was torn away from them. As soon as slaves revolted against their masters, it was brutally subdued.\n\nThere remains one exception to this tragic cycle. Greater than any fleeting previous revolution was the rise of that magnificent President, Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln, the great emancipator of American history, walked hand in hand with Marx in the battle for freedom. His hallowed actions remain indefatigable, though racists and landowners tirelessly attempt to tear them down. For the first time in history, rights were lastingly given to the downtrodden. Lincoln made manifest to the nation the ability of the working people to smash the capitalist class, just as he vanquished the slavers of the South.\n\nNow, a hundred years after Lincoln's crusade against injustice, we finally have embarked on a new revolution, one equal in magnitude. This time, all men, black or white, will finally be free of that terrible curse, slavery of wages.\n\n§RCapitalists, tremble in your boots. Weep for your property. Ready your feeble defense, for the proletariat of America has awoken.§!"
USA_gus_72_crush_the_fifth_column:0 "Crush the Fifth Column"
USA_gus_72_crush_the_fifth_column_desc:0 "The capitalists of America tremble in their gilded palaces, despairing for their ill-gotten wealth and their rotten Empire. They know that we are their mortal class enemies, and that if we get our way Hall will burn their putrid system to the ground. No doubt they plot ceaselessly for a way to sink their poisoned fangs into the President, and restore a faithful lackey of monopoly capital to the White House. To assist in this task they will recruit their most loyal servants, the jackbooted thugs of the CIA and FBI.\n\nWhile the federal agencies claim loyalty to the Constitution and the President, we know where their true allegiance lies. Hoover's dogs exist exclusively to harass, persecute, and kill unionists and activists. The CIA exists to do exactly the same thing, but in the jungles of Indonesia and Southern Africa, and not the streets of Chicago and Memphis. These blood-drenched killers constitute a reactionary fifth column within the American federal government, poised to turn on us at a moment's notice.\n\nA house divided against itself cannot stand. The fifth columnists must be excised from the new American state, not only as justice for the countless beaten, jailed, and dead at their hands, but to ensure that they cannot undermine the authority and power of the President."
USA_gus_72_civil_rights_are_here_to_stay:0 "Put Down Dixie"
USA_gus_72_civil_rights_are_here_to_stay_desc:0 "For the entirety of American history, racism has been deployed as a tool of the ruling class. First employed to justify the evils of slavery, it began to serve as an ideological poison that induces white workers to act against their own self interest. Dividing the black and white proletariat along racial lines, the capitalists have succeeded time and time again in using racism to silence the calls for class unity that would threaten their rule. Racism is, in the final analysis, the capitalist's hammer against the American worker.\n\nThat is why the cabal of capitalist lackeys that preceded Hall failed constantly and consistently to advance the cause of Civil Rights, to allow the racial divide that plagues this nation to heal. The Republicans and Democrats would prefer that white workers continue under the sway of backwards racial chauvinism, and that the black worker be too cowed, downtrodden, and afraid to stand up to his oppressor.\n\nWith a vanguard of the people occupying the White House, now is the time to strike the final, decisive blow against Black oppression. Those who claim to be progressive, opposed to the calls of segregationists, passed the Civil Rights Act. It was a token piece of legislation, giving small freedoms to Blacks. We will introduce something truly revolutionary to congress. Finally, the promises made by Lincoln a century ago will be fulfilled. A real Civil Rights Act, one that guarantees no man unsheltered by justice. Reactionaries clamor for states' rights. They yell from the rooftops, "Injustice! Overreach! Socialism!" We will show them socialism. We will show them what the long arm of the federal government can truly achieve. If the South will not come into the 20th century willingly, we will be more than happy to drag them into it, kicking and screaming."

USA_gus_72_sins_of_the_father_desc:0 "In 1925, Calvin Coolidge asked Heaven for a watchdog to protect corporate profits from workers demanding their labor's worth. Providence answered with the man who would later found America's unique spin on the fascists' secret police.\n\nWith a drive matched only by his hunger for power, J. Edgar Hoover and the Federal Bureau of Investigation waged war on the American working class where justice feigns blindness most. He wiretapped activists and traded their families' well-being for silence, infiltrated unions and enforced disappearances, all while shaping himself into an indispensable tool for America's political-industrial apparatus. Now even the Director's masters tread carefully around him and his office vault; after all, he might just have kept a bone or two from each their shoddy closets.\n\nYet service as long as Hoover's begets enemies and rumors alike. Combined they evince opportunities hidden from eyes too frightened to pry... but Gus Hall is not so easily cowed."
USA_gus_72_raise_the_sickle:0 "Raise the Sickle"
USA_gus_72_raise_the_sickle_desc:0 "Hoover does not act alone in suppressing the American proletariat's struggle. He has been aided since the Prohibition by a league of agents, informants, and associates both within the police force and without, abetted by officials themselves dancing to his true masters' tune. They are his wolves in wool coats, leading sheep away from green pastures and sunlight; through them his will is made known, and by them does his influence reverberate to all four of the country's corners. Like toxic fumes these servants pervade American politics, every so often ossifying until the Director's ominous presence is felt by those who dare defy profit's will.\n\nAt day's end, however, they are men and women no more exempt from human failings than Joe Public. And good masters know to pick servants which resemble them most. We know Hoover's a crossdressing homophile; what sorts of profligacy do his underlings indulge in? Our men can't wait to find out."
USA_gus_72_the_african_nightmare:0 "Uncover Our Crimes"
USA_gus_72_the_african_nightmare_desc:0 "Marx and Lenin both cautioned that classes uphold their own interests before all else. Thus it is natural for workers, irrespective of race and creed, to organize when organizing improves their workplaces and wages; likewise, it is natural for a capitalist to lie and swindle when lying and swindling improves their bottom line. Granted, decades of reprisal had suppressed the former nature among America's workforce - but the latter dominates the news where there is news to report, though as an American virtue rather than an abhorrent vice.\n\nNo greater ur-example of a capitalist's inherent duplicity exists than the South African War. Covetous of the continent-sized riches held sway by German fascism, America's wealthy grifters bankrolled from beginning to end a conquest war marketed as liberation. Their puppets in Congress painted a free nation under attack, willfully ignoring those it had kept unfree since its founding. Their mouths in the media depicted a crusade akin to 1863, nevermind the African villages slaughtered wholesale by machine guns and napalm. And they themselves presented grandiose plans for Nazi Africa's "reconstruction": in all but name, a looted continent trading the fascist slave-master for United Brands and Standard Oil.\n\nBy its conclusion America was wholly convinced that the men had "fought the good fight" in the Dark Continent. To uphold the narrative, injustices planned and perpetrated by these "good fighters" were left to gather dust in the Pentagon's archives.\n\nIn the spirit of Honest Abe, and for his legacy's sake, we shall bring the truth to light."

We will permanently end the infiltration carried out by the Bureau and all its agents in the labour unions of our America. Such an event would draw support from our comrades among the Old Left and the socialist elements of the NPP. Through a combination of budget cuts, reassignments, and internal affairs investigations, we will hamstring the FBI's ability to monitor union activities. Once they realize we're not worth the trouble, the real work can begin..."

The marble banks of Washington, D.C. glow a faint orange against this afternoon's sunset while featherlike clouds mottle the wide blue sky.\n\nMen in suits amble the National Mall on their way home, satisfied after a nine-to-five drawing spreadsheets in four-foot cubicles. CEOs converge in the city's finest clubs and restaurants and lose themselves to orgiastic debauchery, the illegal made legal by the almighty dollar's vote. A mother of three trades her cashier attire for two hours of sleep and an apron smeared with a clown's grin. Black siblings too young to count huddle together for warmth, heedless of the landlord prowling for rent. Espy the capital's sights and revel in a peaceful day drawing to its end: when the rich begin their eight hours of rest, and when the poor begin another eight hours of work.\n\nCome the next morning, an "anonymous source" will release our own hundred days' work to everyone with an eye and ear. No mind will remain docile against the deluge of sin to come. And when dawn rises over the Potomac, its angry glare exposing a myriad truths from just as many hypocrites, then we shall strike as a hammer on hot iron. The FBI, the CIA, the NSA - those with which Wall Street's pilfering monopolists had for so long bent the worker's back - shall break before a people roused into action.\n\n§RRevel in today's peace, for tomorrow and in the coming decade, peace will be a distant memory.§!"

HAL.2.t:0 "How Does the White House Celebrate?"
HAL.2.desc:0 "Conversations lulled as Chief of Staff Tyner, a folder cradled in his arms, and President Hall entered the conference room. All eyes snapped towards the two, awaiting their pronouncement. Hall returned their stares levelly before he spoke.\n\n"Alright folks, it's almost showtime and you bozos aren't sitting it out if I can help it. That goes double for Martin." Laughter susurrated as the Secretary of Defense nodded at the jest. "Pull your chest up and act like you won. Because we did win something - and it's this right here." Hall swiped Tyner's folder and waved it around. Backs straightened up at the gesture. "Today we prove to America that real change began in the streets and ghettos smeared with our comrades' blood. And today we'll show that change is all America will see from here on out. Take pride, each of you, in having done your part to make this happen."\n\n"Now let's head upstairs. They're waiting for us."\n\nThe walk to the balcony was silent and full of nerves. Hall slipped into his thoughts. These days he'd spent more time thinking than doing - thinking the next four years, securing Congress, the riots down South. Redneck reactionaries the lot of them, crawling out of woodworks from Richmond to Phoenix. But he'll deal with them in time.\n\nDoors swung open. The morning draft brushed past calloused skin. And all thought was washed away by the sea of mankind that greeted them below. Red and white and black swept from the South Lawn to the Washington Monument and the horizon beyond. An unseen weight was lifted from his shoulders; the old man felt his pace lighten for the first time in decades.\n\nHall ascended the podium, and the sea let out an ear-splitting roar. The unionist could only raise the Act high above his head before the people claimed his senses whole."

Mealy mouthed bastard's said enough."\n\n...\n\n"What now sir?"\n\n"Don't look so glum. Half of Congress just outed themselves as the filthy hypocrites they are. Should surprise nobody, least of all us."\n\n"Make no mistake: this is a terrible setback. Your brothers got their hopes dashed for the second, maybe third time in ten years. But setbacks stopped the fight for common damn decency not one bit. The men before us faced gun barrels and strikebreakers day in and out. Still took a stand against the predators who'd robbed them of what they're worth. Why should a pack of bougie-cahooting ratfuckers scare us off now?"\n\n"I'll keep that in mind, Mr. President."\n\n"Revolutions rarely happen overnight, kid.

Add one more to the pile built up like cowshit since he signed the pardon. The upstanding gentleman from Montgomery even had his stamped with the Traitor's Rag! Some people's gall...\n\nThe door swung open right on cue, revealing a sack plump with paper and standing on two shaky legs. To the visitor Hall said, "Hey Tyner, ever read some of these yet?"\n\nChief of Staff Jarvis Tyner huffed as he hauled his sack towards the Great Seal, where mail of all sizes gathered into a hill waist-high. "Read one and you've read them all I reckon- oof, ain't this heavy-!" Grunting, he dumped the sack on top of the hill. It fell as a body would onto a bale of hay, but with paper instead of straw flying all over. "This is the fifth bag this morning, sir," Tyner sighed out. "Don't see it letting up anytime soon."\n\n"Just means the heater's not going hungry anytime soon either." While Tyner busied himself with the unsorted mail, Hall inspected the Oval Office's brand new liquor cabinet. He set his eyes on a bottle of hard cider, which he retrieved with a grin. Leave champagne and bourbon for the petty bourgeois; real men drink themselves silly with 25 proof. "Now c'mon kid, I'm in a celebrating mood and the cider ain't drinking itself.""

HAL.5.desc:0 ""What can you tell me about Hoover and Helms?" ordered President Gus Hall.\n\nSecretary of Defense William Martin shuffled in his seat. "They're Directors of the FBI and the CIA respectively," he intoned in measured halts. "In pursuit of national security, the federal government repeatedly allowed their stations wide purview and little oversight. They thus pursued extralegal means to combat America's ideological opponents at home and abroad."\n\n"Fancy words for something so simple, Mr. Secretary," laughed the President; his mirth fell short of his leer. "You could've just told me they're the two most powerful men in America. Could've just said they did whatever, wherever, whenever they wanted it. Whites in hoods lynch blacks without a care, fascists march up and down the Mall, organizers go missing - but end of the day, their puppeteers are still in charge, still richer than God." The President leaned a hair forwards. "Ain't I right?"\n\nMartin sank into his chair, shying away from the glaring lights, the sweltering heat, the pressure that overwhelmed. Fixing his tie he replied, "We should acknowledge that no matter how necessary this may be, our national defense against the forces of global fascism will be severely crippled..."\n\n"A crippled limb that we can heal in our image." Hall slid a dossier folder towards the Secretary, tapping its cover thrice. "But I understand. Just get to work; I want this done soon as you can."\n\nNothing else needed saying. The President wished for a biblical deluge to visit the twin agencies - justice smiting rotten wood into splinters, he likened. Nevermind the damage dealt unto their bulwarks against Germania and Tokyo; in fact, irreparable damage might even be the unionist's intent.\n\nFor a brief moment, Hall's headsman contemplated an America left helpless and blind before the whims of foreign powers."

"I am... troubled by much of it."\n\nHe did not have to elaborate on the threats, the violence, the monitoring. The files locked in Hall's desk were overrun with stories of Black death and terror. Ruckelshaus shifted in his seat. "The Bureau has always operated according to the national interest. If, on rare occasions, those actions exceeded reasonable limitations, as they might have with the activist Fred Hampton, that is not Bureau policy but the mistakes of a few bad actors."\n\nThere was a vile taste in Hall's mouth as he bit back a retort. The purpose of this meeting was not to exchange talking points. "I noticed several records that I had officially requested on Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X were not included." In his mind, the statement dripped with implication. "There's quite a lot of gaps in the last decade."\n\n"Sir, bureaucracies, they... they lose things. I know this might be hard of a man of your background to understand but—. Christ." He shook his head. "There's no reason to go digging up the past. Trust me when I say it's better. Your predecessors learned that."\n\nHall stared at the man as a feeling of sickness and dread washed over him.

HAL.7.desc:0 "The White House wasn't built for moments like these, thought staffer Alice McGarth. The President was at his desk in the Oval, sitting before a ring of television cameras from the major networks. A make-up artist was finishing applying blush to Hall's sweating face as the minute warning rang through the room.\n\nWhat was missing from the scene, Alice noted with a growing sense of alarm, was the absence of any teleprompter. Mere hours ago, she and the other members of the White House Press Corps had been told to get the Office ready for a nationally televised address. The subject: Unknown. What the President was doing was as much a mystery to her as it was Congress, the Cabinet, and the President's own wife.\n\nWhatever he was doing would be fully improvised. Acrobatics without a tightrope.\n\n"Thirty seconds before we're live," shouted a voice through the flurry of activity. Aides scrambled to make final adjustments to the scene. "Non-essential personnel, leave the room."\n\nThe President was breathing heavily now, melting beneath the bright incandescents. He took a gulp of a large cup of water and placed it absent-mindedly near the corner of his desk—where a staff member whisked it away. He turned a photo of his grandchildren toward him and then closed his eyes. His image refracted countless times in the camera's fish-eye lens.\n\n"Ten seconds. Nine. Eight. Seven..."\n\nGus Hall put the photo back in its place and wiped his eyes with his sleeves. Then, he straightened his back and looked square into the camera. There was a moment's pause and then the light of the front-most camera went red."

I would demonstrate a commitment to the truth that so often eluded past leaders—no matter the cost. I... intend to keep that promise."\n\n"There have been few moments in history like this, when so many objective factors have converged and the pressure for brave action has been so clear. It's because of—. It's because of this need for action that I am prepared to tell you a truth that you've been deprived of. Even if it leads to my..."\n\nHe looked down and then back into the bright lights. "Over the past weeks, I personally reviewed many files held by the FBI on their conduct towards civil rights activists. The image that emerges is... gruesome. There's violence, monitoring. I can't say how many have been harmed, but one thing is clear based on what I've read." The warbling in his voice calcified into something dark. "Reactionaries in the FBI murdered Fred Hampton, Malcolm X, and, I believe, Martin Luther King Jr. among others."\n\nIt was as if the air had gone out of the Oval Office.\n\n"I give this address knowing the likely consequences, but it will not shake my resolve." His gaze was piercing now. "I won't allow these horrors to be covered up any longer. I will not submit the evidence to Congress where they will be buried. I am announcing tonight that, using my lawful authority as President, I am unilaterally declassifying all documents pertaining to the security services' monitoring and abuse of the civil rights movement and all other marginalized groups. To guarantee the dissemination of this information, I have already made copies of what I believe to be the most relevant documents.

After the riots, after the attacks on FBI field offices and the attempted bombing of its headquarters, after his superiors William Ruckelshaus and Mark Felt had resigned and he'd been forced to move his family to a hotel, DeLoach had found himself as the last FBI leader still standing. Congress had rewarded his commitment with a hearing.\n\n"Now, Mr. DeLoach, I," said Angela Davis, some socialist professor turned representative. Her tone was one of poisoned honey. "I want to ask you, without any further distortion, whether the Bureau murdered Martin Luther King Jr., Malik el-Shabazz—."\n\nHe could not take it any more. "Ms. Davis, as I have already indicated in my written testimony, these allegations are false. I cannot comment on what the President believes but, as his subsequent releases have demonstrated, he has no files. There is not a shred—."\n\n"You did not let me finish my question, Mr. DeLoach. We have documented records of surveillance, false-flags... What about Fred Hampton? What about the other activities which President Hall has discussed? This letter telling Mr. King to kill himself—."\n\n"We are... we are investigating those claims. I had no knowledge—. I mean, I had no personal knowledge—. I didn't authorize..." He felt so nauseous he was worried he might vomit. Angry faces seemed to swim before him. "Whatever happened is not what the President claims. We're not—. The Bureau is not an enemy to Black Americans or anyone else. We uphold the law."\n\nThe representative shook her head in disgust and motioned to the Chairman that she was finished with her questions. Then the next member turned on his microphone and the agony continued."

HAL.10.t:0 "Last-Minute Briefing"
HAL.10.desc:0 ""Turn to page 24," said Secretary of Defense William Martin. Shuffled paper joined the Situation Room's air conditioning as the bureaucrat cleared his throat.\n\n"CLEAN SWEEP is divided into two phases," he continued. "Phase One consists of leaks distributed by our agents in major television and newspaper agencies. Over the course of several weeks, they will clandestinely receive sensitive material implicating the United States' intelligence and military services in criminal activities deliberately kept hidden from the public. We expect anti-government sentiment to manifest once such material is disseminated, providing the administration cause to enact Phase Two."\n\n"We'll sweep the Beltway clean of the rot it's got." President Gus Hall stood up, then paced to and fro the Room's front end. "No one gets a pass, not the highest general or the lowliest clerk. Hundreds, thousands, ten thousands- doesn't matter how many'll lose their jobs by the end of it. Doesn't matter if they've kids to feed or alimonies to pay; their hands are stained with our comrades' blood, and it's up to us to put them to task." The unionist glanced towards the seated men. One cigar-chewing man, in particular. "There's that gleam on your eyes again, Larry. Excited?"\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Larry Itliong grinned as he waved his favorite pastime in the air. "Putangina boss," he said, "I've been waiting for this for a while now. Of course I'm excited!" The veteran striker pointed two fingers - the other three ended right at their knuckles - at the man seated beside him. "Hiss too, I think." Secretary of State Alger Hiss nodded in assent.\n\nAnd as usual, Vice President Paul Robeson said nothing besides the occasional yawn. Not that the others expected him to so much as open his copy of Martin's report; "Old men need their beauty sleep," so the jape went."

HAL.11.t:0 "(Excerpt from a House Committee on Truth and Reconciliation hearing)"
HAL.11.desc:0 "CONGRESSWOMAN ESME HARPER (NPP-M, IL-15): I will not repeat myself, Mr. Hughes: where was Bravo Company on the night of December 15?\nLEWIS HUGHES (CAPTAIN, 101ST AD): Lewis Hughes, Captain, serial number O-6772835.\n\nHARPER: So you maintain that Bravo Company was nowhere near Potfontein when Colonel Hawkins issued the order to, and I quote, "pacify guerrilla activities within the town premises."\nHUGHES: Yes, ma'am.\nCONGRESSMAN DOMINIQUE HENDRIX (NPP-M, MS-2): (expletive). Don't lie to us Hughes; the records clearly said 2nd Battalion was sent head-first to Potfontein in the Christmas Blitz. Or did your pack of baby-killers just (expletive) off into nowhere right before their friends pulled the trigger?\nCONGRESSMAN DREW CHAPMAN (NPP-P, AZ-4): Just to clarify, Captain: what did you mean by "nowhere near Potfontein"?\nHUGHES: That we weren't in Potfontein when it happened. Battalion HQ had us recce several miles inland after we took the town. My boys heard about the massacre only after Hawkins requested a burial detail. We didn't... didn't... (inaudible)\n(HUGHES lapses into silence. Witnesses noted that his eyes "turned cloudy and distant".)\nHARPER: We've heard enough, Mr. Hughes. Bravo Company's willful inaction is damning in and of itself. Far from being absolved of guilt, you and your men have made yourselves complicit in the deaths of 85 innocent men, women and children by failing to prevent their murderers' misdeeds, let alone bring them to light.\nHENDRIX: And nothing's gonna change that, "sir". Not even fancy-sounding words to some piece of paper. Dismissed."

HAL.12.t:0 "Breaktime Pastime"
HAL.12.desc:0 "It was noon in the steel mill, and the foremen had gathered around the break room's only radio for a special occasion. Call it a new ritual among the union men of Philadelphia, built upon the logic that every exposé of the Feds' misdeeds strengthens the proletariat's class consciousness at their oppressors' expense. Rosie said as much when she badgered James to join the crowd ripe with the stench of half a dayshift. He thought the boys were running low on excuses to relive Election Day '72. Either way, the man's participation was decided by a stand-off between his logic and his friend's emotions. Her large, glimmering, dog-eyed emotions.\n\nNaturally, emotion won over logic. And so James realized his voice had joined several dozen others in howling like baboons when CBS reported today's leak: a tally of suspected FBI infiltrators and strikebreakers in the mid-Atlantic area. Sonny carried with him a handheld blackboard and some chalk, anticipating like everyone else the other half of every noontime drop for the last two weeks.\n\n"That's... one-three-nine, right?!" shouted James's fellow blonde over the break room's cacophonous din. The air was laden with crisp dollar bills and elbow grease.\n\n"Get better ears, dumbo! You're off by twelve!" shouted Rosie back. It was all James could do to not buckle under the woman who'd claimed his shoulders for the time being. Was she this heavy before?\n\n"Both you two idiots got it wrong," boomed another voice - Corwin's, he figured. "If Cronkite said 164, it's 164 and that's final!"\n\nAs the ad hoc conversation devolved into a shouting match, James let out a quiet sigh. Only a madman could've predicted that betting on fired employees would become a pastime."

HAL.13.t:0 "Befores and Afters"
HAL.13.desc:0 "William Martin's first (and only) impression of Langley was built by its car park. Vehicles of every size and shape, every brand and every color, packed end-to-end the wide asphalt plain nestled within the forests of northern Virginia. He expected nothing less from the intelligence services; the Orpos' HQ, rumors said, quadrupled even Langley's ginormous size.\n\nEvergreens zoomed by until the limousine slowed to a stop. Nodding at his driver, the Secretary of Defense stepped off and beheld Langley for the second time in his life. He caught his breath.\n\nNo red Fords, no black Mercedes Benzes, no yellow Chryslers and GM's. The plains were devoid of their colorful beasts - a preserve with nothing to preserve.\n\nFurther afield, the drab-grey compound stood as a lonesome giant in a manmade clearing. This was the CIA's glass-and-concrete heart; every beat relayed orders to ten thousand agents across America and beyond. But its pulse faded as staff left (or were made to leave) in droves, and now it laid empty and still. In a way, the heart's dormancy struck Martin with awe and dread alike - such a titan, silenced by his hand. And for as long as its heart remains silent, the CIA is impotent against its foes. When shall its slumber end? Must it end at all? So many questions and so few answers...\n\n"Done sightseeing yet?" called a voice from the limousine. "We've work to do, Martin. Save the navel-gazing for when that ugly bastard's turned to rubble."\n\nSecretary Martin gave one last glance at the sleeping giant before he heeded the President's orders. For better or worse, its fate, like his, is Gus Hall's to call."
