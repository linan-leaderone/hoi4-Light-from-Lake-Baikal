Threatening to resign after the exposure of President Lott's corruption in the Transamazonian highway, Quadros hopes that his gambit would succeed to elevate him to the presidency and force Lott to resign. Fortunately enough, Quadros has the enough influence to pull off the plot, successfully tarnishing Lott's reputation to the populace. Sensing the anger that might broil if his vice President steps down from the position, as well as threatening the country's democracy, President Lott resigns from his position, with Jânio Quadros succeeding him as President. Lacerda would then try to get him removed from power, using a letter of resignation Quadros made while he was  threatening resignation when Lott was still President. The Senado would decide that it is just a mere draft, dismiss the notions that Quadros would resign, and solidify his hold on the executive office. Free from any plots and treachery, Quadros is finally able to pursue his outlook of independent foreign policy in Brazil under his brand of §iPopulist Conservatism§!, until a new President gets elected, or if §Rthe military plots against him§!.§!"

RULE_OPTION_INDONESIA_CIVIL_WAR_OUTCOME_RANDOM_DESC: "§F§RHow did it all go wrong?§!\nIt began with so much hope, too. After achieving independence in 1949, there was the real sense that a new Indonesia could be built, that utopia could at least be worked towards. More than a decade later and those same optimistic faces are disillusioned, armed with the knowledge that independence wasn't what they'd imagined. Particularly infuriating are the Republic's close ties to Japan, not least because the Zaibatsu still control large parts of the economy, and increasing centralisation by the government in Djakarta. Already there are rumors of power players making moves in Indonesia's more far-flung regions. Amidst a cloud of uncertainty, one thing is clear: these sparks of discontent will eventually catch fire.§!"
