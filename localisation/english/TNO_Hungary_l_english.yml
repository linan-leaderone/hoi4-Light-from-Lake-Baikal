 ## Leader Descs ##

 POLITICS_ISTVAN_HORTHY_DESC: "Miklós Horthy was once considered a great man, but his son can not even claim this. He is only a hated puppet who is seen as too socialist by fascists, too fascist by liberals, and too liberal by the aristocrats. He is trapped and alone, consumed by shame and regret.\n\nIstván Horthy was once just a simple engineer, toiling away for the good of his nation. When he once had conviction, he fought for his beloved country and publicly criticized the Nazi regime, expressing his sickness at the treatment of the Jewish people. Once he was made co-regent, all this began to slip away. The popularity he first won as the "small regent" slipped away once pro-German fascists began to occupy political institutions, leaving both regents weak and undermined.\n\nBy the time his dear father passed and he alone took the mantle of regent, the damage inflicted upon Hungary had been far too severe; he could only mourn for the nation. His government is controlled by his nominal junior, Prime Minister Bela Imredy, who has packed it with his German-aligned cronies. Now, István can only watch in horror and wait for his moment to save Hungary, a Herculean task, but he will die trying to accomplish it."

 ### Ideas ###

 HUN_Broken_Yoke: "The Broken Yoke of Trianon"
 HUN_Broken_Yoke_desc: "When the Treaty of Trianon emerged from the bowels of hell itself, it broke a nation. Hungary was torn asunder; her people scattered, her lands ravaged, and her dignity snuffed out.\n\nWe can only be thankful to the Admiral Regent for banishing that infernal document to the annals of history where it belongs - thanks to István Horthy's mixture of supreme political acumen and military skill, Hungary is once again whole. While her borders today may not look exactly as they did two centuries ago, the spirit of the Hungarian people remains exactly the same. After such a long period of decline, we are finally back."

 HUN_Transylvanian_Issue: "The Legacy of Vienna"
 HUN_Transylvanian_Issue_desc: "The Second Vienna Awards were a great boon to our country. The division and return of Transylvania to Hungarian hands was a long time coming even before the Germans decided to take the initiative and make it happen. However, as happy as we are to lay claim to our rightful lands, it has not come without cost, for Transylvania is proving a problematic region to govern.\n\nRomania insists upon funding pro-independence terrorist groups in some vain attempt to regain the land they gave up, whilst the vocal German minority is waited upon hand and foot by the Reich, who intervene in our affairs whenever they see fit. These clashing interests foster a tense atmosphere within the region, ensuring that our security services are almost always occupied."

 HUN_Social_Upheaval: "Social Upheaval"
 HUN_Social_Upheaval_desc: "Hungary may have been one of the victors of the war, but that does not guarantee peace or stability. It is a kingdom with no king - little more than a semi-fascist dictatorship kept in power by German backing.\n\nThis is in no way the ideal way for the country to be run, and as a new generation of Hungarians have grown up under this regime, they are clamoring to change this. However, their efforts are hampered by limited suffrage and a government unwilling to listen. As many begin to call for democracy, socialism, liberalism, and everything in between, the government will need to find a way to suppress these idealists if they wish to continue their rule."

 HUN_German_Fist: "A Faustian Bargain"
 HUN_German_Fist_desc: "When one makes a deal with the devil, it often comes back to bite. This exact scenario happened in Hungary following Imrédy's reforms, as German corporations quickly leapt in to monopolize Hungarian industries - using the workforce, resources, and land of the nation to their own benefit.\n\nWhilst this may have been a beneficial relationship in the 1950s when great economic boons came from it, the relationship turned sour following the stagnation of the German economy. With the Reich's economic situation remaining tenuous and their dominance over Hungary not seeming to wane in the least, it seems the time has come for Hungary to reap what she has sown."

 ## World Events ##

 HUN_WORLD.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Horthyist Gambit Fails; Imrédy Assumes Absolute Power"
 HUN_WORLD.1.desc: "The reign of the Horthy family over Hungary has come to an ignominious end. Prime Minister Béla Imrédy took to state television and radio to announce that the regent, Isvtán Horthy, had attempted to oust him from his position with the help of "a rogue band of misfit officers and other opportunists." The regent himself has gone missing, said to be imprisoned in his palace. A few corpses litter the grounds of the Prime Minister's residence, spirited away just after a few photos by the press.\n\nTo fill the valuable and constitutionally mandated position of Regent, Béla Imrédy will take the unprecedented step of assuming the position, effectively fusing it with the office of Prime Minister. Gathering around him various advocates of further collaboration with Germany, rightists, and general critics of Horthy's regime, Imrédy has promised a stable administration that will continue to collaborate with Germany, while also immediately announcing a new round of press censorship.\n"
 HUN_WORLD.1.a: "Another nation grows a little less free."

 HUN_WORLD.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Regent Imrédy Dies; Bárdossy Seizes Power"
 HUN_WORLD.2.desc: "Reports from Budapest have confirmed what days of radio silence have suggested to the international community. Hungarian Regent Béla Imrédy has passed away from old age. A longtime power player in Hungary's politics, crowds took to the streets to mourn for him, though critics have suggested coercion was involved.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, former Prime Minister László Bárdossy, seized control. A surprisingly popular fascist, Bárdossy now rules as regent with a coalition of aristocrats and other moderate fascists in a step back from Imrédy's excess.\n\nIn his first speech, Bárdossy promised Hungarians a return to the stability of the Horthy era and vowed to protect Hungarian lands from foreign enemies. Most observers have taken this as a sign that his ascension is a continuity of the status quo.\n"
 HUN_WORLD.2.a: "More of the old."

 HUN_WORLD.3.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Regent Imrédy Dies; Jaross Seizes Power"
 HUN_WORLD.3.desc: "Reports from Budapest have confirmed what days of radio silence have suggested to the international community. Hungarian Regent Béla Imrédy has passed away from old age. A longtime power player in Hungary's politics, crowds took to the streets to mourn for him, though critics have suggested coercion was involved.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, Imrédy's former right-hand man, Andor Jaross, seized control. An ardently pro-German politician, Jaross now rules as regent with a big tent coalition of fascists in a continuance of Imrédy's policies.\n\nWith his first speech offering slavish praise to Germany for their generosity to Hungary, many international observers allege that the Reich may have had an explicit hand in his rise to power. This accusation has quickly gained traction with Jaross' critics.\n"
 HUN_WORLD.3.a: "More of the same."

 HUN_WORLD.4.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Prime Minister Imrédy Fired; Horthy Announces Reform"
 HUN_WORLD.4.desc: "In a shocking upheaval to Budapest's political establishment, perennial Hungarian Prime Minister Béla Imrédy has been fired from their position after an electoral liberalization bill was passed against his wishes. The announcement was made today by István Horthy, a man considered to be a pariah in Hungarian politics. Thrust into the spotlight after the death of his beloved father and co-regent in 1957, Horthy was, until today, widely considered to be a weak puppet of his Prime Minister.\n\nFurthermore, Horthy has announced a reform program for Hungary, a proclamation that has seen his name cheered on by the people who once despised him. This has coincided with his appointment of Lajos Kresztes-Fischer as Prime Minister, a retired yet well-respected general. International observers see these changes as sidelining dominant far-right elements and predict significant changes in future elections.\n"
 HUN_WORLD.4.a: "A decaying country has been given a new breath of life."

 HUN_WORLD.5.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]MFP Dominant Coalition Win 1967 Hungarian Election"
 HUN_WORLD.5.desc: "In a historical moment for Hungary, the first free elections have been held after years of fascism. As millions cast their ballots for the first time, the results were waited all with anticipation to see who would lead the nation in this new era.\n\nThe main victor in this election has been the Hungarian Independence Party, finding itself at the head of a coalition of smaller parties. Formed by former FKgP members, the party runs on a national conservative platform.\n\nAs a compromise candidate between the myriad of parties, Jenő Ghyczy has been made Prime Minister. He promised to create an independent and democratic Hungary free from German corporate interests. The results have been welcomed by most, though some voiced disappointment at their reluctance on social reforms and liberalization.\n"
 HUN_WORLD.5.a: "Another small step on the road to a new dawn."

 HUN_WORLD.6.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]FKgP-PSZ Dominant Coalition Win 1967 Hungarian Election"
 HUN_WORLD.6.desc: "In a historical moment for Hungary, the first free elections have been held after years of fascism. As millions cast their ballots for the first time, the results were waited all with anticipation to see who would lead the nation in this new era.\n\nAn FKgP-PSZ-led coalition has emerged as the people's choice. The two dominant parties in the bloc are the FKgP, one of the oldest represented parties made up of anti-fascist agrarians, and the PSZ, a centrist and liberal party.\n\nWith FKgP being the larger of the two parties, veteran politician Ferenc Nagy has become Prime Minister. Nagy promises to use his term to revitalize the Hungarian countryside, enact social reforms and liberalization, and weaken aristocratic and German power with protectionist policies in a result that saw many celebrate.\n"
 HUN_WORLD.6.a: "The peasants see their star finally in ascension."

 HUN_WORLD.7.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]PSZ-FKgP Dominant Coalition Win 1967 Hungarian Election"
 HUN_WORLD.7.desc: "In a historical moment for Hungary, the first free elections have been held after years of fascism. As millions cast their ballots for the first time, the results were waited all with anticipation to see who would lead the nation in this new era.\n\nAn PSZ-FKgP-led coalition has emerged as the people's choice. The two dominant parties in the bloc are the PSZ, a centrist and liberal party and the FKgP, one of the oldest represented parties made up of anti-fascist agrarians.\n\nWith PSZ being the larger of the two parties, Géza Teleki, the son of a former Prime Minister, has become Prime Minister himself. Teleki promises vast improvements in social and democratic rights and to open up the country to world trade while combatting German influences within the country in a result that saw many celebrate.\n"
 HUN_WORLD.7.a: "Hungary looks to the free world in hope."

 HUN_WORLD.8.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Massacres in Budapest; Arrow Cross Seizes Power"
 HUN_WORLD.8.desc: "Budapest is in chaos today as members of the National Socialist Arrow Cross have achieved power in a bloody coup. Administrative facilities fly the party's flag, while militants have taken over the parliament building and the regent's residence. Radio stations broadcast old marching songs and an address by the new leader, Ferenc Szálasi.\n\nPromising land and work reform, Szálasi has castigated the deposed government as a tool of global Jewish capital and intent on the destruction of Hungary. Such rhetoric has spurned hundreds of violent incidents against the nation's democratic activists and former government officials. The military, which allowed the coup without opposition, is conspicuously absent from these purges.\n\nEven the Germans seem uneasy at the ascension of this government. The borders are thronged with soldiers, managing both the flow of refugees and monitoring the deteriorating situation.\n"
 HUN_WORLD.8.a: "Hitler's ghost possesses another nation."
