 murmansk_peace.1.t: "Finland Offers Surrender"
 murmansk_peace.1.desc: "Diplomats representing the Finnish government have approached us offering surrender once again. This time they have fully conceded to our demands and are offering to hand over Onega, Murmansk, and all of Karelia east of Viipuri. This would restore the border to its position in 1936 and bring millions of Russians back into the fold.\n\nWith our rightful territory returned to us and all questions of military supremacy definitely settled by our rout of the Finnish armed forces we have nothing else to gain from the war. It has been a triumphant return of the Russian nation to the world stage, with the reclamation of a valuable region and a decisive victory over a foreign rival to make it all the better.\n\nLet us make peace with the Finns and turn our attention to the east. Karelia was just the beginning. Soon all of Russia will be reunited under our flag."
 murmansk_peace.1.a: "Wonderful!"

 murmansk_peace.2.t: "Russia Accepts Our Surrender"
 murmansk_peace.2.desc: "Our diplomats have returned and informed us that the Russians have accepted our unconditional surrender. All of Karelia east of Viipuri will be returned to them and the border will return to its 1936 position. This is a devastating loss for our nation. Decades of work to restore the Finnish population of our eastern territories and enormous investments in those same regions have been undone. It was only because this sacrifice was necessary to preserve any form of an independent Finland that it was made. Our future that once seemed so bright is now slipping away from us as we fall back under the Russian shadow."
 murmansk_peace.2.a: "We flew too close to the sun."

 murmansk_peace.3.t: "Finland Offers Ceasefire"
 murmansk_peace.3.desc: "Though our soldiers have not managed to shatter the Finnish lines as we hoped, we are still making steady advances into their territory. Perhaps fearing that they will not be able to hold us off for much longer, or simply not wanting to expend the blood and treasure to repel us, the Finns have offered us a truce. They propose to cede Onega and the territories presently controlled by the Murmansk People's Republic to us in exchange for an end to the fighting. Shall we accept the treaty as they have offered it to us, or reject it and fight for greater gains?"
 murmansk_peace.3.a: "Accept."

 murmansk_peace.6.t: "Finland Demands Ceasefire"
 murmansk_peace.6.desc: "Our soldiers have not managed to shatter the Finnish lines as we hoped, and it seems that the war, despite our best attempts and hopes, has stagnated. With frozen lines and from a position of strength, the Finns have offered us a truce in order to halt the fighting and return to a position of pre-war status quo with regards to their borders.\n\nThey propose to cede Onega to us in exchange for an end to the fighting, with the stipulation that the former territories of Onega shall remain demilitarised. With the present stagnation of the conflict, more and more mobilised Finnish reserves every day, and international pressure from Europe against us, we cannot hope to achieve our strategic goals. We have no choice but to accept this poisoned pill, and hope that some day we will be able to recover our lost lands through other means."

 murmansk.11.t: "The Heroes of Murmansk"
 murmansk.11.desc: "Rumours have started to leak from our former provinces inside East Karelia. Wrongly stolen from us under the apocalypse that was Operation Barbarossa, it seems that the perfidious Finns have had a hard time trying to keep their ill-gotten gains. While tales from the naive and the hopeful have always leaked to us about a "general Russian uprising" in our lost lands, it seems that there's more truth to this gossip than there was before.\n\nIn the city of Murmansk especially, discontent against the occupying Finns have reached a boiling point. If something isn't done, it seems that Helsinki will have a full-blown insurgency on their hands - something, in their political atmosphere, that they can scarcely handle. However, when a door closes for some, a window opens for others. Some leading members in the Murmansk seperatist movement have graciously reached out to us for aid and assistance in their upcoming struggle against the Republic. Sir, we should consider this offer for if we do supply them, and they should succeed - who's to say that they wouldn't want to join their brothers in Russia proper?"

 murmansk.21.t: "Let Slip the Hounds of War"
 murmansk.21.desc: "The rebellion has begun. Our sources were correct, for once, and a general insurgency against Finnish forces has driven the Finnish Defence Forces out of the Kola Province and cleared the city of Murmansk. A glorious victory in its own right, to be sure, but it is only the beginning. Given a bloody nose, yes, but beaten? This is only the first phase of a struggle between Us and Them. The Russian and the Finn will come to blows once more - and they shall not be alone.\n\nThe port of Murmansk has always been the first port of call for foreigners and supplies. This time, Murmansk will be home to people much closer to home. Our volunteers have already been trained and equipped by us to fight alongside our brethren inside the MPR. It's these legions that will face the brunt of the Finnish Army and take them out, while their numbers are ground down by the Murmanskite partisans until they have no choice but to evacuate from their conquests. Then, and only when Helsinki is humiliated to the prying eyes of the World, shall Murmansk and East Karelia be returned to us - as it should have been, all along."
 murmansk.21.a: "Send them out. The Finns are not the only ones who can play guerrilla."
 RUS_MPR_volunteers_tt: "We can now send §Yvolunteers§! to aid the [MPR.GetNameWithFlag] in their fight against §WFinland§!!\n"

 FIN.125.t: "The Finns' Cowardice"
 FIN.125.desc: "Service for safety and peace. In exchange for martial sacrifice our families would be returned to us. Today, Helsinki's demonstrates their complete lack of dignity and their overwhelming disregard for our lives with the newest set of orders delivered to our high command. Despite our clear martial superiority, we are to surrender to the Russians.\n\nEvery single person in our high command is confused by this development. We are bleeding the Russians dry, and they have completely failed to penetrate our defenses. Have the Finns lost their stomach for war? Have they decided they won't sacrifice Finnish lives for some "measly Russians?" Has Helsinki lost their minds entirely?\n\nMaybe if the Finns are surrendering so early it means that the Russian government is just and not deserving of such bloodshed. Maybe this government is run by truly sensible men and women, compared to those traitorous Bolsheviks and lunatic fascists. Our men wait for our generals to give the command. These men have prepared for this fight for a long time, they might yet follow us into a bloody last stand. However, this last stand would be our forces alone, no Finnish assistance will be provided. This fight will likely be bloody, brutal, and quite possibly futile. Perhaps it is better to take our chances with this new government and lay down our arms in peace?"
 FIN.125.a: "May this new Russia be led by more merciful men than the last."
 FIN.125.b: "We shall not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight!"
 
 #Leader Bios
 POLITICS_JUHA_RIHTNIEMI_DESC: "There are two types of politicians - loud, brash showmen who embrace loud and brash policies, and the quiet workhorses without which all world governments would collapse in seconds. Juha Rihtniemi is one such man - intensely patriotic, from a family deeply involved in politics, and focused on the well-being of his people and his own personal interest in fully returning East Karelia to the Finnish fold.\n\nWhen the roof fell in on the German economy and mud splashed all over the faces of the National Coalition Party's most high ranking, Juha remained clean - and with a reputation as a diligent, experienced functionary who handled the West Russian War calmly and neatly, he was elected President with a whopping 72% of the vote.\n\nJuha's time as President has been spent slowly but surely developing the nation even as it continues to walk the tightrope between the German behemoth and the shattered titan of Russia as it gradually begins to pull itself together once more. Though he has authorised significant funding of Finnish units in Onega as a bulwark against the Russian menace, it is all too self evident that sooner or later, Finland's old enemy will return once more to claw away Karelia from the motherland. To that effect, programs to teach Finnish to the Karelian populace, settle Finns in significant numbers, and deport the Russians still remaining have all received generous support under his administration."

 FIN_An_Unsatisfactory_Answer: "An Unsatisfactory Answer"
 FIN_An_Unsatisfactory_Answer_desc: "Karelia and Murmansk have finally rejoined the Finnish homeland - the time has come to rejoice!\n\n...Or so it would have been, but in truth both these lands have been nothing but a headache and drain on the coffers of the country. Red partisans infest the forests, and though much of the 'non-ethnic' population of Karelia has been deported to Onega, Murmansk remains as a thoroughly Russian thorn jabbing at the side of the state. Until these issues are resolved, the "Eastern Question" remains open, and the answer we have now may not be enough to preserve all that has been built over two decades when the Russians inevitably come knocking again."

 FIN_Second_Crisis_Of_Democracy: "The Second Crisis of Democracy"
 FIN_Second_Crisis_Of_Democracy_desc: "On paper, the IKL is a minority party barely rising above the level of the fringe. In reality, the IKL and other right-wing movements find the strength from... somewhere to strongarm politicians, fight partisans in the East without government sanction, and in general pull the strings throughout the halls of power without rightfully wearing the crown. This shadowy support makes the Finnish far-right much harder to weaken than it should be at a first glance, and means that the number of seats controlled by the IKL in Parliament means nothing but a red herring to mislead unwary observers as to how much power it wields."

 FIN_The_Growth_Regime: "The Growth Regime"
 FIN_The_Growth_Regime_desc: "Of all the nations in or around the periphery of the German sphere, Finland is an economic anomaly. With an export regime characterised by technically advanced products - both industrial and agricultural - disciplined and competitive state corporations working in cooperation with banks design organisations, and a high rate of public savings, the Finnish economy has grown by leaps and bounds. Additionally, the influx of resources from the new Eastern territories and from Russia via Onega, and close cooperation with Sweden in terms of exports to Germany, have resulted in what many international observers call Europe's success story in a time marked otherwise by economic bleakness."

 FIN_Johannes_Virolainen_hog_desc: "The Finnish tongue has a long and benighted history compared with Swedish, but it is ours nonetheless - Finns all, from Helsinki to Karelia. Especially Karelia - our land, robbed from us for nearly half a century, but no longer. The lone man who fights for the rights of Finn Karelians is Johannes Virolainen - the only man who cares, Vyborg born, who knows their struggle.\n\nHe may be controversial to some. However, the need to settle Finns in their native land, and expel the foreigners from land that is not theirs - may not be... palatable to those who care more for foreign responses than actions. Pruning those who care about Finland from those who do not is an entirely different question. One that is guaranteed to be resolved the correct way.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is clear that some are born to see the whole picture - and some are born to actually deal with it. Johannes Virolairen is one of those men who will nominate scapegoats for the nation's sake - a patriot thinking only of the nation's greater good. Either way, he needs to enter power..."

 FIN_Asko_Ivalo_for_desc: "The art of diplomacy is a delicate one, and often involves knowing when to draw powerful neighbours close, and when to keep them at arm's length. Asko Ivalo knows this all too well, as one of Helsinki's most experienced diplomats, and one of the architects of Finland's current close relations with the Reich.\n\nEver since the rebirth of the modern nation of Finland, powerful neighbours have sought to 'rectify' the anomaly of her independence - and the ever-present solution has always been to draw closer to the one nation that never had and never will have territorial designs on even a square metre of Finnish soil. As a member of the SS Voluntary Committee of '42, Ivalo sealed in iron and blood the nation's commitment to Germany's cause by helping organise a Waffen-SS division of Finnish volunteers, and continues to support pro-German policies within the Finnish government, both out of pragmatism and to ensure the continued loyalty of the IKL and the powerful shadows lurking in the corners of power, seeking closer alignment with the Pakt as a whole."

 FIN_Paivio_Hetemaki_eco_desc: "In a world where the ties between nations have been torn apart, Päiviö Hetemäki seeks to rebuild Finland's link to the global market. In fact, most of his programme can be described in terms of rebuilding - of the relations between employers and workers, of economic ties with both Western Europe and the United States, and of Finnish worker's wages.\n\nOwing to this he also forms part of the bloc supporting further market integration with Europe as a whole, and thus for Albert Speer's reformist group in far-away Germania. It remains to be seen if his moderate, rational policies can survive when it seems the most chaotic years of Finland's history are fast approaching, but for now he marches on, slowly but steadily."

 FIN_Pekka_Malinen_sec_desc: "Once Prime Minister, Pekka Malinen now serves as Defence Minister - an important transition that allows him to ensure the continuation of his policies of ensuring Finland keeps what it has earned, and deserved for so long.\n\nHaving served several tours of combat as a member of the SS, Malinen found himself in the political wilderness following his tenure during the West Russian War - until it was realised that he, and his Finnish People's Party, were far too influential to exclude from government - this, despite the relatively small size of the party. Now, his policies revolve around the same three tenets - increasing support for Onega as the vanguard of the nation, increasing the military budget, and expanding the military infrastructure in Karelia to more rapidly deploy forces against the ever-present partisan threat."
