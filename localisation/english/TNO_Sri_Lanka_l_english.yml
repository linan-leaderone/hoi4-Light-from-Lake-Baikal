 POLITICS_DUDLEY_SENANAYAKE_DESC: "For Dudley Shelton Senanayake, political life was not his first choice, but thanks to his family, an opportunity appeared for an extended career. Born into the prestigious Senanayake family and the eldest son of Don Stephen Senanayake, Dudley's education saw him gradually turn to a path in Ceylon's judicial system.\n\nYet, his father's desire to have his son join politics saw him rise to the State Council in 1936 and oversee the development of Dedigama as State Councillor for over ten years. During the debate on sovereignty in the 1940s, Dudley supported his father's choice of preferring Dominion status for Ceylon, yet did not join his father in resignation and earned the position of Minister of Agriculture and Lands, formerly held by his father. He kept this position after his father won the 1947 elections and served in this function until his father died unexpectedly in 1952. To the surprise of many, Dudley was chosen as prime minister by the Governor-General over his cousin Sir John Kotelawala, while he successfully led the UNP in the elections of 1952, he stepped down as Prime Minister the following year.\n\nHowever, Dudley returned to politics in 1957 after the failures of the elections and returned the UNP to the majority in the 1960 elections. Despite his success, the issues facing Ceylon have not become less during his term, educational reforms and economic steadiness have been adequate, but the Sinhala matter and closer ties to India have caused minor unrest within the country. Ultimately, his career lies with the success of his policies, and whether he will bring victory or defeat in the next elections remains to be seen."
