Flags flew at half-mast in the capital of Abidjan while its citizens gathered in the hundreds of thousands to witness the motorcade that carried "le Général" to a luxurious funeral by the Lagune Ébrié. There, delegates from across Free France's network of vassals and dependencies paid their respects to the man who had so herculeanly restored Françafrique south of the Sahara.\n\nPhilippe Leclerc formally succeeded de Gaulle in the same ceremony, swearing oaths before his open casket. The general asked to be buried in his homeland, and Free France shall spare no effort towards fulfilling his final testament. Leclerc pledged henceforth to continue the militarization schemes his predecessor began - no surer sign that the exiles' plan to return to the Métropole is impending.\n"

  west_african_crisis.16.desc: "Cameroonian Foreign Minister Jean Fochivé and the Japanese representatives face each other. Officials of both parties were sitting stiffly, and while their faces were kept blank, neither were able to fully hide their true feelings. From the moment the Japanese had arrived on the airstrip, unease had permeated the air.\n\nJean did not want them there. The Japanese did not want them either. Yet they were here all the same. Not because they wanted to, but because they had to.\n\nJean had serious reservations with the Japanese. They were not the Americans or Germans, but he was not stupid. The Japanese and their 'Co-Prosperity' were no less imperialistic than American hegemony - and even if they were not, relying on a foreign nation to help remove the colonialist rot from their continent left a sour taste in his mouth.\n\nThe Japanese likely considered his own government unreliable as well, especially since they had no common interests beyond seeing the OFN and the French pushed out. Unfortunately, it would have to be enough. "We both know the priorities," Jean said. "The OFN presence is unacceptable. We want them out, and to be left to ourselves."\n\n"Of course." The Japanese ambassador said mechanically. "Japan is, of course, prepared to assist in your struggle to purge the imperialists and colonialists from your country."\n\nJean kept his expression neutral. "And in return?"\n\n"Merely that this be a foundational relationship between our two peoples - after your victory, of course" the ambassador said without smiling. "We do not have strings on our aid, unlike the Americans." Jean knew that was a lie, but knew it was the best they were going to get. And if they wanted to win, they had no choice but to accept help."

Among those which have not already been invaded and integrated into the Pan-African sphere is the Mano River Pact, consisting of Liberia and Sierra Leone, not counting all those troops from the initial West African Conflict which have fled into these neighboring states. Of course, our relationship with Liberia de jure is a total guarantee of independence, though with the Oil Crisis claiming much of our attention away from the region, we are effectively unable to stage a proper intervention.\n\nAt this point, we have two clear options:\n\nThe first is to fulfill our past obligations with Liberia and send aid however we can. While given the circumstances this will be much less effective than we would have hoped, this could very well be our last good chance to establish allies in West Africa, let alone maintain some modicum of freedom for the last remaining free states in the region.\n\nAlternatively, the OFN as a whole is stretched thin as it stands, and that is to say nothing of the political consequences of diving headfirst into a war that has already been lost once. We already deal with the veterans of the last war, and it would be unwise to lose twice.\n\nRegardless of the decision, evacuation and reconsolidation or intervention and investment, West Africa hangs in the balance."

"The alliance will hold, this isn't South Africa- the pan-Africanists won't fight to the death for some slivers of coastline for longer than a year, you read the internal stability reports same as I did." McNamara had been in the Oval Office for about thirty minutes longer than he'd planned, which was to say he'd been in the Oval Office for thirty-five minutes. The second conflict in West Africa this decade was nothing more than the last gasp, the dying words of Democracy in the continent. South Africa was enough. West Africa was too much. West Africa again would cost the Primaries, at least.\n\n"Sir, I think that is an incredibly irresponsible way of looking at a complex geopolitical situation. People are already in an uproar we tried to help the French and lost the first time around, what's to gain from a second time?" The President didn't even flinch at the idea, taking a sip from his mug. "We are spread thin as paper dealing with the Oil Crisis as it is; things are getting bad and they're about to get worse. We cannot afford to spend these valuable resources on a war we've already lost before it began. I suggest you pull out of the consulates, bring what we can, and hit the road while the going is good." Johnson looked back at McNamara, his neutral expression giving way to one of impatience and anger, even if for a split second.\n\n"McNamara, when we first stepped foot into West Africa, we made a promise. A promise to keep the region free, and a promise that all this something wouldn't be for nothing. Now, look at us. We spent God-knows how many lives and guns on the French, and now the PALF is giving us a second shot. This is our last good chance to show the American people that we did something here.""

Walter Kronkite and a young man, maybe 30, sat next to each other in leather chairs, the bar along the bottom of the screen declaring the man sitting on the right to be "Frank Evans, Veteran Of West Africa".\n\n"Well, Mr. Kronkite, I think it's goddamned outrageous. I have been fighting for America for the last decade- I've been to Malaya, South Africa, and Cote d'Ivoire, and let me tell you that I've shot and bled and killed enough to have a say. I came into this decade on a draft card, and I intend to leave it with someone new in charge; not someone that'll send me to die in some-" The television dimmed, and Wallace resumed reading over the reports sitting on his desk. Maybe nobody else could see what he saw, but they didn't need to see what Wallace saw, only know that he was making the right decision. If people were getting upset over West Africa being for nothing, then this was their second chance. If de Gaulle wouldn't make the cut, Liberia would need to step up. Of course, there would be the protests, the draft card burners, and the veteran interviews, but there wasn't much else that could be done to convince people that if there would ever be a chance to get a foothold in West Africa, it was this "Mano River Pact". Wallace let out a sigh and turned the television back on.\n\n"...already. As the PALF has already made significant grounds, the Liberians may need to establish a defensive line soon, before this turns into a total rout, not unlike the first days of the South African War."

Of all the ways in which Kennedy had been expecting to shake hands with the French, this was far from how he'd expected it, though given the circumstances he would have preferred it no other way. Taking a seat by the window as the last of the photographers got their shots, Kennedy cleared his throat. "General Massu, I just want to start by saying that I am honored to have you here with us. That, and-" The Frenchman raised his hand.\n\n"We lost, Kennedy. You, me, France, we lost. There is no coming back. It is over, the dream is dead, and I don't even know where de Gaulle might be. Now, the Pan-Africans are setting their sights on what's left that's free. We got more out of the Côte d'Ivoire than we should have, and I can't tell you how many the others got out of the way of that fucking steamroller. We aren't done with the PALF, and they aren't done with us. We can keep our slice of Africa breathing, but only with your help. Is the OFN with us?"\n\nKennedy smile faded, slightly. Glancing up to the reporters, it seemed as though they had been distracted by Scoop Jackson making some kind of a statement on policy towards the Mano River Pact. Nobody was listening.\n\n"Listen, Mr. Massu, we tried once before. Think of what we'd be taking on for reelection, the press would kill u-"\n\n"If you don't do this, the fucking PALF will make Liberia look like Moskowien, and that's without anyone around to stop them. Imagine what they're going to do to us exiles; we'd be more welcome at a Europeaniste get-together." Kennedy squinted his eyes. "That's not the point." Massu continued.

With the Oil Crisis striking the Middle East, it has been our responsibility to contain any threats to our national interests and to support our allies in the region. As a result of this... admittedly reckless approach to foreign policy, we have found ourselves stretched thin, and thus unable to maintain some of our pre-existing commitments, specifically with the Mano River Pact of Liberia and Sierra Leone. While this comes as a shock to some, we had suspected that the PALF would not be satisfied with its claims following the West African Conflict. With today's declaration of war, it is clear that the Socialist despots have deemed the time ripe to invade our close allies. While ordinarily, we would intervene in the conflict as soon as the option became available, our current geopolitical position has made that especially difficult."\n\nThe cameras of the press in the back rows flickered, and Bennett let out a sigh. What if they lost? He already caught flak for getting into the first West African Conflict, the press would fry him if he tried it twice and lost. Then again, a few losses hadn't exterminated the Warhawks, and they'd eat him alive if he let freedom in West Africa go quietly into the night.\n\n"As a result of this unique set of circumstances, and with the unfavorable state of our military as it stands, I have come to a decision on the subject.""

Donny felt around his helmet brim for the cigarette he'd taped to it. Sticking it into his mouth and covering his lighter as he lit the stick ablaze, he checked his watch. Half-past 9. Another Huey flew overhead. By now, there were at least 40, maybe 50 trips made total since the evacuation had properly begun. From the sounds of things, Washington was shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids, and it was time to get the fuck out of dodge. The ambassador was already halfway across the Atlantic on some carrier that was getting more work done ferrying tag-alongs than planes, and it seemed as though they were practically carrying the Liberian consulate out of the country by its foundations. Footsteps clacked against the asphalt behind him.\n\n"Hey, room for another out here?" A familiar voice called out, and Donny looked over his shoulder, before gesturing to the vast open space in front of him and Jessica.\n\n"I think we're booked."\n\n"Oh, haha, you're just so funny I think I'll leave you here.

The only real bastions left were the police station, city hall, and the consulate. Another thud. Mark wiped the sweat off of his forehead and heaved another stack of manilla folders into the cart. He could barely hear the thuds now, if only because the yelling and hollering around him had long since drowned it out.\n\n"Where in the goddamned hell is Donny?!"\n\n"Don't fucking tell me the furnace is broken! Fix it and get those rat-fucks downstairs to start shredding!"\n\nThe gunfire outside the consulate gates thundered like the countless Hueys that had been running laps from the rooftop to the carrier just outside the bay. Even in spite of everyone yelling into their desktop phones, or scrambling to make their way to or from the basement, everyone froze in place. Like clockwork, Mark saw himself tear himself away from his files, and begin to push his way downstairs with the rest of his floor of bureaucrats and a pair of frazzled guards, both pushing the group up to the roof. The gunfire outside began to dim as the beat of a Huey descended upon the roof. Mark pushed through the crowds racing up the fire escape stairs and saw a line of people sitting on the helipad, as the Huey rose into the sky. Mark hardly registered it, as he pushed through the crowd that bled into the line of despairing accountants and bureaucrats, looking for faces. Aside from the lobby, his floor would have been the last to the roof. Cora worked on the second-highest floor, and God willing, she'd gotten out. Mark watched as the Huey flew to the shore, where there was supposed to be some kind of an evacuation effort.

And, as much as the pacifists and the bad-actors in the Republican-Democrats would rail against him for it, he'd have to intervene. Without American intervention, the whole of western Africa would fall to a rising tide of revolutionary socialism, and the French anaemic colonial army had little hope of standing in its way.\n\nKennedy mused over the issue, feet up on the Resolute desk as he listened to the late-night rain pattering against the windows of the Oval Office. The scumbags on the party's right wing would have a field day with him, the progressive, sending more troops to fight blacks, but what choice was there? It was this or lose Africa to a government only a shade away from outright communism. Perhaps he could spin it as America protecting its pseudo-colony of Liberia, or valiantly stepping in to save their once-allies in the Second World War?\n\nLike everything in politics, there was no easy answer, but he was resolved to do what he knew to be right. Intervention was necessary. An Africa divided between the fascist Italians, the Nazis and a bunch of reds wasn't a future he was interested in seeing.\n\nAs the President reached for the phone, it began ringing.

They could not afford for one side to gain an irreversible advantage.\n\nUnless it was their own, of course.\n\nCongress had provided authorization for the operation, framed as a defensive measure that, in theory, was intended to merely allow the American forces to protect their allies. In reality everyone knew what it meant. It was a dedicated intervention, and one that the President hoped that the majority of the public would be prepared to support.\n\nNo one wanted to think what would happen if victory wasn't achieved relatively quickly. Or if the public backlash was swift.\n\nThere was another element that needed to be considered as well - namely how the Japanese would respond. Given that they were likely watching America, and would proportionally respond? Many expected that Japan would soon follow suit and conduct their own intervention in Africa.\n\nOnce more, Japanese and American soldiers would meet on the field of battle.

They had been expecting the Americans to intervene sooner or later; it wasn't in their nature to remain complacent when their interests were threatened.\n\nJapan was much the same.\n\nIt was fortunate that they were similarly prepared for this development. Snap drills and readiness checks for the past few weeks had been conducted in preparation for a deployment. It hadn't been specified why they were happening to the soldiers - but the government had resolved that if America decided to escalate the conflict, they would be able to respond just as quickly.\n\nThe outcome would now be determined by investment, and the Prime Minister expected that America was in this war to win it. So Japan would need to send whatever was needed, and what they could afford, to ensure their interests were protected. If for no other reason than the Americans were going to do the same thing.\n\nOnce more, they would ensure that America walked away from this fight broken, bloody, and defeated.\n\nThe Rising Sun has not yet set.

Unlike in the South, there were no enemy planes chasing him, no anti-aircraft guns operated by poor bastards whose sole goal in life was to down an American. This was the middle of nowhere, over a country of backwards hicks who had barely just come out of the Stone Age, and he had the honor of shattering their world in the most cutting edge tech there was. The Forward Air Controllers in their Broncos had already marked the target with a Willy Pete smoke rocket - a few seconds of warning for the poor suckers in their hovels to get out with whatever they could. Kirk, his backseater in the second cockpit, confirmed the visual. The lieutenant focused on flying as smoothly and cleanly as possible. The button was clicked.\n\nA village of barely more than 30 people - and an ammunition crate - erupted into a plume of flames, wood, and red dirt.\n\nFar below the plane, on a hill overlooking the 'target', War Correspondent Dean Boyer shot three pictures. One was of the clear sky, marred by the bomber formation. Another was of the village, clueless and curious about the small smoking canister that had just landed near them. The final one was of a child with one arm blown off, slumped in the burning rubble of his house, staring emptily into the distance. Strangely, it seemed he was looking directly into the lens.\n\nFar away from all the action, in New York City, humanities student Larry White turned on the TV and saw people like him being blown to bits whilst living their ordinary lives. There were no swastikas, no war-loving Jerries getting their just deserts. The newscaster warned that the next few images would be graphic, and that anyone with an 'easily disrupted constitution' should look away. Larry White stared at the TV, and the haunting gaze of a boy younger than his brother with utterly dead eyes stared back. Above the photo, the caption blared unsympathetically:"

One raised his hand.\n\n"Sir, B, C, and D all appear to be major roads on our side. What happened to the policy of minimizing collateral damage?"\n\nThe major sighed. There wasn't an easy way to fool a crew of well-educated, smart men about the true objectives of a mission the way you could with the blockheads that stayed on the ground.\n\n"There's no way around this, Lieutenant. This is the minimum accepted collateral for the mission - remember the enemy is all around us, even on our side. Every time we spare a target, the war gets that much harder and their job gets that much easier. Besides, we won't break what we can't fix. Or so I've heard. Anyone else got any burning questions?"\n\nThere were none. The only thing left was to get up, follow your orders, and push any doubts back as far as they could go.\n\nIn another part of the world, in another room lit up by the dim light of a projected map, a completely different group of people watched a very similar scene. They too were clad in uniform - not camouflage, but sharp suits and ties. They were in fact discussing the very same map that so confused the airmen. The difference lay in the details - whilst the military map detailed roads, enemy encampments and bases, the 'civilian' map detailed population centers, resources, and most importantly - markets. What had been destroyed of course had to be rebuilt - but nothing ever comes for free. What else is there to pay, but the wealth of the land? The men debated, argued, compromised, shook hands, and left a map of Africa divided between its new oppressors - curiously, entirely ignoring the faint red line that demarcated national borders."

And, of course, the endless stream of wealth and resources pumping out from the many ports of West Africa directly into the New World. Ironically, some might say that that was hardly a change - rather, simply the old reasserting itself.\n\nSome raised the alarm - voicing concerns that the Americans had simply arrived to become the new colonial overlords in place of the French, the British, and everyone else. To this they were pointed to page after page of proof otherwise - the peoples of West Africa waved their own flags, sang their own anthems, fought in their own armies and for their own land. It was merely that American companies, having arrived originally to serve their fellow countrymen in arms fighting for freedom, also now wished to cater to the West Africans. Having better technological capabilities, they rebuilt infrastructure, vital service generation, and healthcare facilities to a better standard than before. What was there to complain about?\n\nIn a forgotten office of the Free French government, occupied by a subdivision of a subcommittee of a native self-government group, a solitary figure began reading economic data prepared by the American Electric Power company regarding 'key deliverables' and 'vital resource structuring'. Scattered throughout the endless jargon and excessive technical detail was one overarching theme - tracing the ownership of almost anything in the region, from "public" utilities to private companies to land, usually resulted in a line that moved further and further away from the African coast and closer and closer to the Land of the Free."

We Americans are, by definition, spectators rather than participants. Yet it seems U.S. soldiers are now not just intimately involved in practically every engagement fought by African forces - new photo evidence shows men in American uniforms fighting for despotic warlords oppressing their own people.\n\nIs this what the Stars and Stripes now represent?

Apparently, the total cost for their entire nuclear programme was equivalent to just nine days of wartime spending. That's a lot of money.\n\nWhere does it go? Back in the day when wars were fought with millions of men on both sides, it'd get spread out - diluted - among those millions. But that's just not the case anymore. At least in the case of West Africa, there are maybe a few tens of thousands of Americans involved. But the costs stay the same. At any rate, there's usually a fat budget authorized for a war - and that means there's a slice of the pie just waiting for someone smart enough to grab it.\n\nCarl Conway was one such man. The first thing he did when he heard that US boots would start marching in West Africa was ask who was going to build the roads. When he found out that they hadn't thought that far yet, he had a lovely informational dossier printed and sent that explained in no unclear terms why Brown and Root was the best choice for the job.\n\nIt worked. B&R - as well as a few other companies - were told to form a consortium to handle any and all infrastructural needs the US Forces and their gallant French/African allies - who could not afford to construct bases in their own territory - needed. And now, Carl Conway sits at his desk, as billions of dollars flow straight out of the taxpayers wallets into the jungles of a faraway land - where accidents and 'unexpected circumstances' will necessitate a small 'adjustment in the budget'.

It was the topic of strategy that was on the minds of Cameroonian generals and their Japanese advisors.\n\nThe generals gathered in their masses at a field headquarters as a grand offensive was being planned, one to remove the West from West Africa. The French had their American backers, and if they were to stay on even ground, they needed more patronage from their Japanese backers.\n\nThe advisors received a laundry list of guns, bullets, vehicles, and other weapons of war. The Japanese would take care of the channels and shell companies that would slip these instruments of destruction to the Pan-Africans, alongside the necessary training to play violent melodies that would become the national anthems of tomorrow.\n\nWith the agreements were concluded, a date was marked on the calendar - the 25th of December. An offensive scheduled for three months away made some impatient, but they had already waited underneath the imperialist boot for more than three hundred years. Another small wait for eternal liberation was but a minor thing."

When the coast was clear, he jogged to the embassy wall. Guiding the backpack down his arm, he set it firmly against the wall, opened it, and with a match, lit a fuse.\n\nDieudonné ran for cover.

Seconds later, it was as if lightning struck mere feet away as a burst of light shone brightly through the streets, followed immediately by a thunderous eruption.

Suicide bombers attacking the US Embassy, towns overrun with PALF, watching US soldiers getting shot and cities burning like it was South Africa all over again, the big bombs getting dropped and turning villages and forests into ash... this was worse than anything I had seen in that war. And every night there was more footage, more reports of pain and death.\n\n"The President had said one thing, the Generals had said one thing, my own eyes told me another. The PALF suddenly came out of nowhere to do this, how were we winning? They were stronger than ever! We would have beaten them months ago, but they had enough men to catch us overwhelmingly by surprise. And this wasn't a desperate attack, they had to have planned this out, coordinated it, found thep people to die for it, and all of it was under our noses!\n\n"Then, I started thinking. The President and the Generals didn't know what they were talking about. No, they were lying. Had to be. And if they were lying about the PALF, they had to be lying about everything else in the conflict. Were we the ones propping the French up? Was the PALF really just Jap bootlickers? Could we win the conflict in the end?""

Said Bernard, cracking his trademark grin and striking Pierre cheerfully in the aging French officer's arm. He offered a weak chuckle in return. Mike had been markedly silent, likely due to his poor but workable grasp of French, so he simply managed a 'Oui' paired with a humble smile. Pierre set to dealing out cards, his spirits wavering ever so slightly as his thoughts wandered toward France. The two men, one timid but dedicated and the other bombastic and reckless, reminded him of the men he served with in 1940. His sly grin turned to a wistful frown as he placed the last few cards on the empty ammunition crate they'd been using as a poker table.\n\nThis subtle display of heartbroken nostalgia drew the eye of Mike. Noticing his curious gaze, the old Frenchman began to explain, "Oh, it's nothing. I am just homesick. I long for the day we return to France."\n\n"I... understand. You will, some day, and it will be very good!" Said Mike, his faulty grasp on French apparent in his attempt to provide a false reassurance that Pierre was clearly not buying.\n\n"Yeah! There'll be a parade in Paris and then... then we'll kick their kraut asses out of the east and past Alsace!"

Though "translator" was a loaded term, considering the man barely understood Japanese. Still, it was enough. Abba nodded, and explained what they were to the office worker, who nodded and took them away.\n\nThere were still more packages and papers to drop off, so Seiji and Abba continued down the rest of the building, where the same process was repeated. It was far from efficient, and not speaking the language was a problem - but it was done. Now they had at least two more buildings to repeat the same process at.\n\nThe rides were often silent, since neither knew enough of the language of the other to hold a conversation. It would be awkward, if the awkwardness was not so... normal. It seemed to be a common thing - neither the Cameroonians, nor the Japanese really wanted to be here, but pragmatism brought and kept them together.\n\nStill, the more he worked with him, the more he found Abba's presence tolerable. He couldn't do his job without him, and he didn't fill the room every second with pointless chatter. They had an unspoken system which was perhaps not the best, but it worked - and they had a little ritual at the end of the day.\n\nIt was a little bar they went to at the end of a shift.

As they passed one such camp, he watched an ant-sized PALF soldier glance up at the helicopter and offer a cheerful wave before being beckoned back to work by a superior.

His mind hosted a mixture of frustration, exhaustion and worry as he silently lamented over his deployment. He'd signed on to do some real good - fighting America's enemies, seeing exotic places and handling the weapons he'd fawned over in comic books as a child and been trained to use in the last few weeks.\n\nInstead, Carter was digging ditches. He was sunburned, drenched with sweat and being eaten alive by the bugs beneath the tall grass and whizzing about the muggy air. That wasn't even the worst part, though. It would be fine, he figured, if he was just digging trenches for a defense, but these trenches were practically this part of the line's only defense. Usually, when one pictures an American expeditionary force rolling into a foreign country to defend it, one imagines a pristine army at a grand scale packing big guns, backed up by ranks of armor and battling under advanced jets. Then, they'd save the day and leave.\n\nThis wasn't the case, and it didn't just disappoint Carter, it was terrifying. This was going to be a real war, not just an intervention.

Presently, however, just this small patch of swamp was a mess of national armies, ideologically-driven partisan organisations, tribal militias and mercenaries with questionable loyalties and alliegences, bandits, 'humanitarian organisations' and panicking civilians across both sides. His orders were to assist the defeat of French exile forces in West Africa, but were even they set in stone? Would they be walking lockstep down Abidjan in a week's time, Kimigayo following La Marseillaise in a long march of madness?\n\nNaturally, such an... unorthodox battlefield would need a competent strategy in order to secure victory, such as it could be called. And Teruzuki had been entrusted to bring it about. The hours had passed, and he had brought himself no closer to a solution. There were just far too many uncertain variables. He didn't know how many of the enemy there were, how many men he could rely on besides the token Japanese force he commanded, how willing his allies would be to do their jobs or listen to him, what side everyone between the national armies would come down on. Far too complex, far too mysterious. It was like walking an army into the proverbial abyss.\n\nAn idea came to him. Of course, if it was this way to the Japanese, it was likely the same to all the other factions at play. The natives might have more of a cultural awareness of the region, but even they had no hope of coherently tracking any of this. This game was not chess or shogi, but mahjong or poker. If nobody knew what they were doing, the one side who acted as if they did was at an advantage. If they didn't waltz right into a trap or an untenable position.

Next had come a slow realisation of the presence of something his half a mind likened to a hornet's nest. Then, he'd felt the alien sensation of nothingness in his leg, replaced soon by searing pain.\n\nThe first sensation that returned to Patrick beyond agony was the blurry sight of asphalt spattered with his own blood. His busted nose throbbed from its collision with the road, his left leg burned with genuine and phantom pain - torn off at the knee, and both his arms were nearly flayed by road burn. The ringing in his ears gave way to muffled shouting of orders, screams of pain, and the staccato rattle of gunfire. It took him a moment to realize he, too, was screaming. Someone hauled him to his foot, supporting him with their shoulder.\n\nAs Patrick slung his gaze up from the ground and saw his unit racing between the squat, bombed out concrete ruins and down the tight streets of a Ghanaian city, his memories pieced back together. They were to take the city, but something he couldn't remember had stopped them and his squad and 8 Ghanaian militia had found themselves scrambling back to French lines. They had proceeded quietly through the urban jungle, evading ambushes and traps, until... the hornet's nest: An IED, then an ambush.\n\nNow there were only 8 men, dragging him along with them in their hasty retreat along a narrow road towards a blurry french barricade.

Besides, what if they have rocket launchers, or if the Japs gave them some?" Replied the American.\n\n"Send them with escorts, then! I'm not letting my people starve because you don't want to take that risk," blurted the Ghanaian.

No matter where he went, he always had things to discover and people to meet, which is why he loved his line of work so much.\n\nBeing an American diplomat had its perks, after all: he could travel the world all year round, with all expenses taken care of by old Uncle Sam. And now, after India and Ireland, he was assigned to Wolofia. Many of his colleagues would have protested at such an assignment, for they would have seen it as a useless relocation in a war-devastated country; and as he looked outside the window of his office, he had to admit they may have had a point, but that didn't matter to him.\n\nWolofia, despite the war and the hardships, was only another country among them all; and he had the feeling that things wouldn't really be any different here. Still, he had to do his best to make himself at home, he thought as he began to set up his office. Yes, with a little effort, he'd feel like in America in no time: by putting his calendar here, and his photos on the desk like this, it would be perfect! And the typewriter would be...\n\nActually, where was the typewriter? Oh, right, Francis remembered with a chuckle: it hadn't arrived yet. Well, it wasn't that big of a problem, anyway, as he had brought some reading with him, just in case. Yes, he thought as he finished unpacking his bags, he would feel at home in no time.

Had it been anyone else, Dennis would probably have refused, but he could make an exception for him. Although it wasn't only for George that he came: he also was here because, thanks to recent events, his former political affiliation had become almost null and void. Yes, just like many of his fellow Americans, he had lost faith in the Establishment; and, to be fair, could he really be blamed?\n\nHow could he trust them when they lost West Africa? How could he be a Republican in good conscience with what that bastard Nixon had done? How could he support a party that only wanted to help the poor and the downtrodden with weak half measures? He simply couldn't, he thought; and in his eyes, what America needed was real change. He wasn't sure on who would bring upon that change, though; but maybe, just maybe, that this man was Gus Hall.\n\n"Ah, Dennis, I'm glad you came! Follow me, I'll introduce you to Mr. Cleaver!"\n\nAnd here was George, thought Dennis as a smile lit up his face. A socialist rally wasn't something he imagined he would attend if one had asked him one year ago, but that didn't mean he wasn't gonna enjoy the opportunity. Such a congregation of like-minded people, brought together by a common desire to change the world for the better, was in Dennis' eyes a beautiful sight to behold. As he followed his friend to meet that activist he had heard so much about, he wondered if he was making the right choice. Maybe yes, and maybe not, but it didn't really matter anyway: to him, there weren't any other choices anymore."

His stomach had not quite recovered just yet, and he had opted for a garden salad.\n\n"We were a strange little group, hmm? In my mind, West Africa was like enrolling into university, or some high school." Kane grinned to himself, clicking his teeth together. "Could you see me in any university though?" Ōyama thought to himself, and decided no. "Who you still talking to?" Kane asked gruffly between loud bites.\n\n"I sent out a bunch of letters, mostly to the guys we worked with a... bunch."

The photos, fresh from the darkroom, had turned out well and the young journalist couldn't help but to feel at least a little vain about it. Now was the time to put them together and get a story down on paper, a much more daunting task than one would assume, as a veritable obstacle course of censors stood in his way.\n\nWhat could he write? How can he spin such a gruesome war? He hadn't gotten into this field to lie, as much as he was urged to by his boss, government regulations and the other thousand people and entities who might as well be allowed to barge into his office and look over his shoulder. Hidemi shook his head. He won't lie, he'll just tell the truth creatively, he said to himself. Perhaps the best way, he thought, would be to start with the photos and see which he could work in and which he couldn't.\n\nHe began to rifle through them. The first was an ant-sized PALF soldier waving up at the helicopter Hidemi had hitched a ride in from his play-house sized FOB. That'd be easy to work in, thrown together with some talk of anti-imperialist solidarity and all that sod. Hidemi placed the photo aside, in what would become the 'in' pile. Next, he winced at the graphic image of an American's body laying on either side of a bombed out bunker. Hidemi paused, would this humanize them too much for the censors? He sighed, and started his maybe pile.\n\nAn hour later Hidemi was exhausted and frustrated. His maybe pile was several times the size of his in and out piles, and the latter was still higher than the former. So many of these photos that he prided himself on and that displayed unflinching truth would never be seen by anyone but him. Worse still, he had to work what was left into a functioning story.

For months, the cartographer from New York had been traveling through West Africa, chatting with off-duty soldiers and watching beasts roam the landscape. The end of the war in West Africa brought new changes to the region, and the cartographer needed something to write home about.\n\nToday, he had an appointment with the French governor of Ghana to discuss the new political boundaries. The governor, holding his wine glass and smiling, invited George to sit down. The man was acting too casually for his position, George pondered; was Free France not overextended?\n\n"Politically speaking, how is West Africa looking?" George asked, trying to mirror the casual mood of the governor.\n\nWith a chuckle, the governor stood up and led George to the balcony where the two gazed across the dry landscape. "All of our territories have been divided up into different states, each headed by a regional governor. We aren't in a position to exert total control. Not enough troops left," the governor responded quietly.\n\n"You mean it's still all one country? Like America with its federal structure?"\n\n"You may think of it like your America. Each governor has limited control over his territory, but we still have to answer to the national government, of course. Ghana, Mali, Guinea, Dahomey, they are different but it's all French land."\n\nGeorge nodded and wrote something down on his paper. A French Federation of states in West Africa; it was all unified, but the grip felt loose. Just like the early days of America, except it was a different continent.

Through his misty and rain spackled window he could see the old farmhouse standing as it always did, with its cracking white paint laid over the storied wood, its wide form standing stark against the darkening and cloudy sky, and lights in the windows still glowing welcomingly. Carter heaved a grateful sigh as the unparalleled relief of a long awaited end to homesickness and horror washed over him. In turn, he took a deep breath, for he surely would have stories of both drawn out of him over dinner.\n\nShaking away these thoughts, he parked the car and looked to his right at his father's beat up old truck, perhaps with a few more dings than when Carter had gone to war. What a war it had been, he thought to himself as he climbed out, savoring the feeling of stepping through grass in light civilian shoes rather than heavy boots. Mounting the steps, he caught the nostalgic aroma of a freshly cooked dinner sneaking through the closed windows.\n\nCarter still had his old keys, but nobody had to know that, so he knocked and waited until the door swung open to reveal his father's grinning face. About 3 inches taller and 40 pounds heavier than the already tall Carter, the elder Mr. Willis beckoned his son inside. "Welcome home!" He boomed. The rest of the Willises echoed their father's greeting. Mrs. Willis stood up and offered Carter a hug, which he accepted graciously before sitting down with them to dinner.\n\nThe experience was beautiful. He spoke with familiar faces, smelled and tasted familiar food, and listened to familiar laughter. Yet, after the cheers and tearful reunions, there was no mention of the war, no demands for stories or secret news. The Willises seemed disinterested in where Carter had been, simply that he was back, as if he'd been on a work trip and there had been no war. Suddenly, it was simply a family dinner."

Kane had prepared himself for the struggle that would be unwrapping it. He had allotted most of his afternoon to his office, gathered every drop of news, both primary and secondary sources, national surveys and Japanese reports of the region, and collated them into a single file.\n\nHe read through newspapers as he ate an office made dinner, he listened to a tape recording while sipping some iced coffee, and watched the single video that he could find while lifting a 30 kilogram weight. The pit of knowledge was endless. West Africa expanded as he delved into it. He brushed the surface and then some, digging away at the various nations that inhabited Sub-Saharan Africa, from the relic shell of the French exiles to the vibrant, evolving culture of Nigeria and its Pan-Africanists.\n\nAs difficult as it was to connect the dots, Kane burnt through his hours eagerly until midnight hit, but still his resolve never wavered. He had begun to produce a product; a timeline from the tribal kingdoms, to the beginnings of colonisation along the coastline, to the massive expansion inland during the late 1800's and then some. He had a continent in his hands, and Kane loved every second of it. This is what it was all about.\n\nFeeling his eyelids beginning to droop, Kane resolved to take a walk outside. His office was located far from the rest of the museum complex, which was convenient. It lay right next to the primary storehouse. He smelt the musky air as he walked the many, dimly lit isles, watching stacks and stacks of forgotten history pass him by. The fresh, brisk air reignited him, and as he walked back from his short journey, he brought to his office a new resolve.

At least he had seen sense to fry the helicopters. All around him were the two men's underlings, all of them anxious to flee. They bickered amongst themselves too, discussing the very same two options as the officers did.\n\n"There are no generals now! We lost, and the best thing for us, us, not them, is to drive to the ports while we still have gas in our tanks and rations to dole out. The Japs will take us into a safer zone. But if we stay longer, there won't be any Japs!" Kane muttered a prayer of thanks to himself as both the officers got into separate vehicles, their radios crackling. He started up the engine pre-emptively, shouting out to the soldiers in the back of his jeep to find their seats. Mere hours ago, Kane had flown helicopters, ferrying equipment and the men who used it to and fro across battlefields and barracks, hospitals and stockpiles. He felt ashamed that he was now ferrying them to an escape.\n\n"They called us in. We're following the head of the convoy to Port Old Oyo." His radio operator had a frantic look in his eyes. Kane could tell that the man was sizing up exactly how far ahead they were in the convoy, weighing up the odds of finding a seat for himself aboard one of the Imperial Navy vessels. Suddenly, he turned to Kane, the frantic look in his eyes making him seem half crazed. "Kane... sir, I need a place on one of those boats, I fucking... I need it, they'll tear me to shreds in a POW camp. Please sir, you're important, right? Ask for us if they can spare us a few seats."\n\nKane opened his mouth to answer, but doubt had seeded itself in his mind. Was he important enough to warrant an extract?

No, Shuichi was happy with his little desk lamp fending off the evening's darkness.\n\nCharting the dead was not only a demoralizing experience, but a mind numbingly boring one. The first hour a week ago when Shuichi had signed on to remain behind and help count the dead was frightening and tragic, but eventually the names, causes of death and other minutae began to blur until they were simply squiggles on a page to be transferred to a letter and sent off. Jotting yet another scribble down, Shuichi took a sip of his tea and winced.

Why did he take this job? He could be at home with his family, sipping real tea, and reading a book. It was absurd to have volunteered to stay back to count the dead and it was even more absurd that his only complaint was boredom and foul tea. Shaking his head, he reassured himself that the pay would be worth it.\n\nSuddenly, Shuichi's eyes fell upon a familiar name in the sea of casualty reports. Imada Taro. He didn't recognize the name Imada, but the name Taro chilled his bones. It was his brother's name. Shuichi knew for sure that this Taro was not his brother, yet he could not help but wonder who's brother this man was. All of these names, once scribbles but quickly fading back into legibility, were suddenly much more humanized.

A small group of African American youths had agreed to meet with a good friend they'd met in the recent protests, who now sat in front of them. They'd never seen him in his beret though, nor in the leather jacket or combat boots that were kicked up on the folding table.\n\nIt was hardly the most auspicious place for a meeting, some abandoned storage shed. But it was spacious, it had to be, because further inside there was a whole crowd of similarly dressed men and women. "You didn't mention that you'd had friends with you." One of the young women responded from the back, her arms crossed over her chest skeptically.\n\n"I hope it's no trouble." The Black Panther stood, gesturing for his protest-friends to follow him inside the warehouse. Save for a couple who excused themselves to slink back home, they did, into the gathering of a couple dozen jacketed African American men and women. It was only once they were inside that they realized that all of them were armed. And they were listening to one of them speak on a makeshift stage made up of a few empty cargo crates.\n\n"Is it any wonder why we're going where we are? Out to Africa? To fight our brothers and sisters back on the home continent, who want nothing more than to cast off the colonial yoke?!" The firebrand up on the cargo crates spoke with decisiveness and fire, while the crowd, in individual barks rather than a mass shout or singular chant, yelled back their approval. "The white yoke!" She finished, to a more concentrated roar. She went back to talking, and already a solid half of the guests had joined in with the crowd, intrigued by what she had to say next.\n\nUp on the wall behind her, the flag of Cameroon was plastered above her, but with the black fist of defiance and rebellion emblazoned over its middle stripe."

  west_african_escalation.6.t: "Rage Against the Administration"
  west_african_escalation.6.desc: "With the war in West Africa escalating, the President has issued a new draft directed towards young able-bodied men. Tens of thousands will be requested to join the army and, after their training is over, will depart for the frontline. Everyone knows many of them won't return, and this has caused widespread protests as many fear their loved ones will be among the victims: spontaneous marches and picket lines can be already seen in large cities, but the harshest backlash has come from the drafted themselves.\n\nRather than showing what [USA.GetLeader] has called "proud American spirit", thousands of college students and other young men have filled the streets, openly burning their draft cards and loudly protesting against an administration that, in their opinion, has "destroyed their dreams and replaced them with war". Of course, the opposition has immediately offered support to the protesters, promising their potential voters that their first concern will be the end of this "illiberal and useless measure", which they claim "receives the backing of profiteers and kleptocrats".\n\nSlowly, painfully, the police is restoring control, and the draft has resumed when it became clear that all those who refused to present themselves to the barracks will spend enough time in prison to completely forget about college. Still, it has appeared clear that the escalation of the war is seen with hostility and dissatisfaction by the general population of America, something which should drive the President towards a quick and victorious conclusion of this bloody conflict."

  USA_africa_riots.1.t: "The Heating Pot" #wa 35
  USA_africa_riots.1.desc: "As the death count steadily increases, and more and more honest Americans mourn their loved ones, the political temperature is rising up at an alarming speed. After dozens of weekly reports from the FBI documenting ever-larger protests breaking out all throughout the country, now they are no longer needed to warn the government about the rising discontent, as the President himself found out today when he looked from the window of the White House.\n\nRight before the gates to the Presidential Residence stood, grim and silent, dozens of men and women of all ages. Some held photos of husbands, children, brothers whose bodies - lost in the jungle or mangled beyond recognition - they couldn't even hold for a last goodbye, others posters decrying the "useless sacrifice" of human lives and accusing the "bloodthirsty capitalists" who "feed on death" to be the true force behind the government's decision to increase the draft.\n\nThe guards outside were visibly in difficulty: they surrounded the small crowd, but didn't try to dislodge them as they were unarmed and quiet. They didn't scream or try to force the block: they all waited there, and looked at a certain window, where a certain person was looking back. The President couldn't see their eyes, they were too distant for that, but he felt it: that cold, unwavering stare, full of hate and desire for vengeance made chills run down his spine."
  USA_africa_riots.1.a: "We need to get a handle on this."

  USA_africa_riots.2.t: "The Simmering Pot"
  USA_africa_riots.2.desc: "Day after day, the crowd waiting outside the White House increased steadily, until Lafayette Square was completely occupied by the silent protest. All around the United States, however, the manifestations are turning violent, as young college students who have been ensnared by extremist demagogues and radical politicians attack the police at their increasingly frequent gatherings.\n\nThe FBI reports have returned, but the tone is completely different: gone are "protests" and "discontent", and for the first time, worrying words the likes of "resistance", "terrorism" and "uprising" make their appearance. With more and more agents dispatched to monitor the growing opposition movements for signs of extremism, director Hoover is extremely worried about the future of the Union should this state of affairs not change.\n\nOne thing is certain: the President might refuse to open his windows to avoid looking outside, but the hate for the continued presense in Africa is growing. From colleges, where the deans report acts of vandalism, disobedience and secret meetings between students, to cities, with the police stretched thin to keep order, America is starting to fall apart at the seams. If we don't manage to end this war, one way or the other, there will be painful consequences. In the literal sense of the word."
  USA_africa_riots.2.a: "Someone needs to do something about this."

  USA_africa_riots.3.t: "The Boiling Pot"
  USA_africa_riots.3.desc: "All the windows of the White House are closed shut now, though "barricaded" would be more correct. After an armed assailant bypassed security and shot one of the presidential guards before being taken down by the others, an eerie atmosphere has taken over the staff, in stark contrast with the bright white of the walls: all personnel is screened before getting in, and the President has been de facto isolated in his office and private quarters.\n\nAll across the States, things are quickly getting out of hand. Extremism is spreading throughout the country like wildfire, demagogues and radicals spreading their lies and ideologies to everyone desperate or angry enough to listen to them. Those opposing our administration are united in their violent accusations: the President is a traitor to the United States for having sent tens of thousands of brave Americans to their deaths just to make the industrialists happy, they say. The administration is corrupted and ineffectual, and refuses to take the right choices for the good of all, they say. THEY will take all the right choices, they say.\n\nThe FBI is now too busy trying to douse the flames, and reports are curt, listing all the damage done, and what could even go worse. "If the war doesn't end NOW", they all state, "the United States as we know it will be no more.""
  USA_africa_riots.3.a: "Why aren't we winning? Why?!"

  USA_africa_riots.4.t: "End. This. War. NOW!"
  USA_africa_riots.4.desc: "The screams are deafening outside the White House. "Away with the President!" one yells, "Traitors! Murderers! Monsters!" an angry mother cries, clutching the photo of her only son as if it were a lifeline. "Bring the profiteers to court!" echoes her husband, angrily waving his poster. Day after day, the protests get worse. Chaos grips the capital, and the situation can only get worse. For once however, today the chaos outside the House is only matched by what's going on inside.\n\nThe General Staff is all there, in the Oval Office, uniforms perfectly ironed and medals hiding the cloth, but they all looked like scared children. One of them opens his mouth: "President-" "SILENCE!" the voice booms, surpassing for once the mayhem outside, then the noise returns, as all others within the room stand silently. The President is red, and he sees everything that the same color. "What are you fucking DOING?!" he screams, directed at the Chief of Staff. "We are trying to push towar-" "Trying?! You are TRYING?! We are the United States of America! We don't fucking try! We WIN! I sent an army against a CORPSE! The Pan-Africanists have nothing! How could you LOSE?!" All men lower their heads in shame. "Get out of my sight! The next time I see you, I'll get you to a court martial to see if you truly deserved them!"\n\nAs the men leave the room, the President finally looks at the papers thrown across his desk. With trembling hands, he reads them one after the other, for the tenth, no, it has to be the twentieth time. They are all there, the fucking NUMBERS. The dead in this godforsaken war, the killed in the countless riots all throughout the country, the perished in the fires and among the police, and finally, the polls. Of all these damned numbers, the polls are the only ones steadily decreasing towards zero. No, soon they'll enter the realms of the negative. He doesn't read the last report from Hoover. He already knows it."
  USA_africa_riots.4.a: "Do something, damn it! Do! Fucking! Something!"

  USA_africa_riots.5.t: "Out of the Frying Pan"
  USA_africa_riots.5.desc: "President [USA.GetLeader] opened the last newspaper, and he would have felt relieved if not for the noise coming from outside. Finally conceding to the FBI, he had ordered a general censorship of all media, removing any and all news related to the war or the disorders, but he couldn't stop worrying: even though the New York Times had the first three pages dedicated to an extremely interesting analysis of the scientific discoveries of the last twenty years, the noise kept increasing.\n\nIt was in his head, it was in his dreams, it was in his office. The voices screamed outside the White House when he was eating, when he was sleeping, when he was working, never ceasing, never stopping, always louder. Louder. LOUDER!\n\n"Make them stop! I don't want to hear them! MAKE THEM STOP!" He threw the newspaper away and started slamming his fists on the desk: "MAKE! THEM! STOP!"\n\nThe sudden noise alerted the secretary waiting outside. She had gotten used to the breakouts, and was immediately by his side with a glass of water: "Mister President, please, take your pills: the doctor prescribed them for your health!" and, though at first [USA.GetLeader] didn't seem to listen, the friendly voice slowly calmed him, until he finally agreed to take the pills, and gulped them down with the water. "Thanks, Claire..." he said in a whisper, and for a brief moment, he felt... relieved, calm, in peace.\n\nThen the noise started again."
  USA_africa_riots.5.a: "I beg you... please... make it stop..."

  USA_africa_riots.6.t: "Into the Fire"
  USA_africa_riots.6.desc: "When [USA.GetLeader] travelled to the Senate to ask, plead, even beg for another extension of the war measures, he had prepared for a fiery welcome, but when he stepped, for the first time in a month, outside of the White House, he realized he couldn't have prepared for what he saw.\n\nThe presidential convoy had to move incognito using civilian cars and pass through the suburbs, to avoid the riots surrounding the White House and the Senate, and through the opaque glasses the President looked at what he had done.\n\nHouses were shut down some half-burnt, and bands of petty criminals, demagogues and political agitators from the Yockeyists and CPUSA roamed the streets now that the police was entirely occupied with preventing a total collapse of the state. Some banks had their glasses broken, general stores were heavily guarded by private security, and all the common people had the same look in their face: fear. Fear for tomorrow, fear for the lost stability, but more than anything, fear that these damn wars will claim their loved ones too.\n\nWhen he descended from his car near the Senate, immediately the guards were around him, but this also made the crowd aware of his presence. Immediately, a collective roar emerged, and thousands tried to get to him: The President instinctively retreaded, scared of the hate directed towards him, while the security tried to safely get him inside the building. Then, it happened.\n\nA single man managed to break through the shield and, before the bodyguards could get him, he slapped the President of the United States of America. Immediately, he was apprehended and handcuffed, but [USA.GetLeader] had felt it. In that slap, he had felt everything the entire crowd had wanted to convey him: all the hate, all the vengeance, all the pain. It was as if that man had carved his entire face with a cleaver and then filled it with salt and vinegar: he knew it, he had failed. He had failed everything and everyone. As he was finally dragged inside, and the doors closed on the noise, he couldn't stop the tears from falling."
