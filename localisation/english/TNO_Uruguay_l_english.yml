 ## Leader Descriptions ##
 POLITICS_COUNCILURG_DESC: "The Consejo Nacional de Gobierno - in short the Colegiado - was another one of the reforms of José Batlle y Ordoñez that took its inspiration from Europe, specifically from the Swiss Federal Council. Batlle's idea was that if Uruguay had a decentralized executive branch without a President, a dictatorship could never emerge.\n\nHowever, the reform was not implemented fully, due to the division of the Colorado Party and the conservative reaction to Batllist reforms. So a compromise was struck: the Presidency would stay, but share power with the Council. But this was not to last, because the President Gabriel Terra abolished the Council, becoming a dictator.\n\nWith the fall of the Marzist regime and ensuing democratization, the Colegiado was instituted as Batlle originally intended in 1952. But it has not benefited the country. On the contrary, the Consejo Nacional de Gobierno has become notorious for constant stalling, earning it increasing popular hatred. The parliament is debating its abolition and the restoration of the Presidency, but that is easier said than done. According to the Uruguayan constitution, constitutional plebiscites have to reach 35% of the vote on the day of the elections to have effect. According to the right-wing of the National party, that electoral threshold is either unachievable or takes too long to reach. Being this the case, politicians are looking for §Oalternative and radical ways of abolishing the Colegiado§!.\n\nAs a §Rcertain someone§! has said: "With the Colegiado, in five years the §WBlancos§! will win and in fifteen we will have a §smilitary coup§!".\n\nLet's just hope it doesn't come down to that."

 POLITICS_AMILCAR_VASCONCELLOS_DESC: "A common criticism of Batllists is that they treat their ideology like a religion, being dogmatic about it and refusing to compromise. Vasconcellos might be the best representation of this trope, because his unwavering defense of the Colegiado has made what should have been an easy road to power into a rocky one.\n\nBorn in Artigas, the young Vasconcellos moved to Montevideo to receive his higher education. He became an elementary school teacher, developing a permanent and unwavering vocation to serve in the field of education, beginning to teach in 1938.\n\nHis time in Montevideo also saw him getting into politics, as the young Vasconcellos was a witness of Terra's coup and the Marzist dictatorship. He ended up as another opponent to it, participating in protests. This activity saw him getting in contact with Luis Batlle, with whom he would develop a friendship, becoming one of the "Young Turks", Luis' followers. Vasconcellos involvement in Quincista politics saw him becoming the director of Acción, the lema's newspaper, the Minister of Livestock and then the Minister of Finance. It ended becoming obvious that he would be the heir of Luis after he passed away, but his defense of the Colegiado even after it was proved to be failing the country put his position in jeopardy, as he was almost defeated by Jorge Batlle in a primary.\n\nHe managed to defeat that challenge, but orthodox Batllism lies split between his own followers, the Frente Colorado de Unidad who supported the UCB and Michelini's lista 99. And Vasconcellos knows that Jorge is observing the situation from the shadows, waiting for his moment to strike. If he hopes to live up to Luis' legacy, he will have to find a way of governing well and reuniting Batllism under his command."

 POLITICS_MANUEL_FLORES_MORA_DESC: "Maybe Flores Mora is more suitable as a member of the Council than as President of Uruguay, but the electorate has spoken in favor of the restoration of the presidency and so he shall serve them as one.\n\nA relative of the infamous 19th century dictator Venancio Flores, Manuel "Maneco" Flores Mora was born in 1923. He quickly showed a gift for the written word as he began to write and take interest in literary works. Being influenced by writers like the Uruguayan Juan Carlos Onetti and the Spanish José Bergamín, Flores Mora was part of the Generation of '45, a group of artists, mainly writers, who worked in the context of the growing urbanization of Montevideo and others cities from the Interior\n\nAs is a common occurrence in Uruguay, Flores Mora entered politics thanks to journalism. His uncle landed him a job in El Diario, which he traded later for a job in Marcha. Writing on it, he managed to catch the attention of Luis Batlle Berres, who considered that the young man had potential. Maneco accepted Luis' offer to work in Acción, becoming one of the "Young Turks". Soon enough he found himself elected as a deputy in 1954, managing to be reelected in 1958.\n\nIn the fight between Vasconcellos and the clique of Abdala and Jorge Batlle for the control of the lista 15, Flores Mora, as a collegialist, was one of Vasconcellos main backers, to the point of being considered his second in command. It wasn't a surprise then that he was chosen as a candidate for the 1966 elections as a reward to his service and loyalty. The only surprise is him being the President and not the President of the Council, but Maneco appears to be able to deal with the situation fate put in his hands."

 POLITICS_JORGE_BATLLE_DESC: "History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. The true heir to the legacy of José Batlle y Ordoñez was his nephew, Luis, because his sons turned to the right-wing and became conservatives. And now something similar has happened to Luis, because his son Jorge is a liberal.\n\nBorn to a loving father that wanted to give to his sons what he never had, Jorge spent part of his childhood abroad, as the Marzist government forced Luis and his family into exile. Returning when things calmed down, Jorge started his political career on radio Ariel, working with a cousin of his during the electoral campaign of 1946, eventually ending up working on his father's newspaper, Acción. All these experiences taught him about the art of politics, and he finally entered them in 1958, when he was elected as a deputy for Montevideo.\n\nHowever, by that point Jorge had developed his own political leanings, distancing himself from his father's beliefs. While Luis maintained that he did nothing wrong after the crisis of the 50s and that the system the Batllists had built was fine, Jorge started to have doubts. He happened to have an Argentinian girlfriend at the time, and visiting her one day, he decided to attend a conference that the Austrian economists Hayek and Mises were giving. There Jorge discovered his love for free market economics, which would prove to last longer than his relationship.\n\nThe death of his father opened the window for opportunity for him and his liberal vision to take control of the lista 15. And he succeeded at it certainly, but he had to lie. He presented himself as a developmentalist, because he knew that was the further the lema would accept. But now that he is the President he will have to face the problem that will define his career: how much can he get away with turning a left-wing group to the right-wing?"

 POLITICS_OSCAR_GESTIDO_DESC: "Of all the military men who began their careers in the Marzist era, Óscar Gestido is among those who had no fascist sympathies and only did as they were told, remaining apolitical during the period.\n\nGestido always loved the air force, beginning his military career with the goal of becoming a pilot. And he did, flying a single-engine biplane from Montevideo to Asunción in 1926 as part of the official Uruguayan delegation to a Paraguayan commemoration. But that wouldn't be the end of his story, as Gestido kept climbing the ranks, being appointed in 1938 as the General Director of Military Aeronautics, being promoted to General in 1949 and finally serving as the General Inspector of the Army in 1951. During his tenure the air force was officially created as an independent branch, an event Gestido took great pride in.\n\nAfter retiring, his resume spoke of a trustable military man, as so he was appointed as the Auditor President of the AFE, from which Gestido earned a reputation of being a good administrator who knew how to balance a budget. But it wouldn't be until the 1959 floods, and his appointment as President of the National Commission for Aid to the Victims, that a legend was made. The Uruguayan public saw in Gestido an honest man who worked hard into ensuring the victims were given the aid they deserved. Unsurprisingly, politicians soon began knocking on his door.\n\nNow as President Gestido faces many challenges, he is a self-declared leftists that leads the right-wing of the Colorado Party and wants to ensure Charlone's influence is minimal while maintaining the unity of the party. And then is the task of actually ruling the nation. Gestido works hard, but he might find himself in front of a machine he doesn't understand, not knowing which button to press."

 POLITICS_OSCAR_GESTIDO_SAD_DESC: "The efforts of the Blancos to politicize the military in its favor had been denounced by Gestido, who stated that "every country that §Rpoliticizes§! its §garmed forces§! becomes another of the §Bsad examples§! that proliferate on the Continent". But he was not heard, and the country paid for it.\n\nThe government of the Supreme Court tried its best, but lawyers were just not made to lead the nation in the aftermath of a coup sponsored by a foreign power with whom the ruling treacherous government collaborated. A new solution needed to be found, the nation required strong leadership. And so, the people began to look up to their heroes, and they found one in which they wanted to believe in: Óscar Diego Gestido, made a legend thanks to his work in the 1959 floods.\n\nNow, Gestido was the last to be convinced in what was a campaign to draft him to the Residencia de Suárez. Certainly, Vasconcellos believed in him, after his own bid was rejected, but Gestido could prove to be the impartial man the country needed and that Vasconcellos failed to be. He only needed to be convinced of it, and so Blancos and Colorados worked together to convince the retired general to serve his country one last time.\n\nEventually he ceded, accepting to wear the presidential band. Now the new President of Uruguay has a hard task, protecting its democracy from both the external enemy that wants to extinguish it, and the growing internal anger that calls for justice to be administered to the traitors. But he is not alone at this task, he has the help of a national unity cabinet whose pillars are Vasconcellos and Tejera. And in the army, he has the support of Pereira and the rising star that is Seregni. With all of them working together, it is feasible for a happy ending to this situation being found.\n\n§YRight?§!"

 POLITICS_OSCAR_GESTIDO_MARZIST_DESC: "Óscar Gestido is a man haunted by his past. For he in 1935 was a pilot, and the then Mayor was among those who spotted the rebel camp of Basilio Muñoz, located in "La Picada de los Ladrones", in the Negro River. The revolutionary leader was eating with his 500 hundred men, and the smog of the fires they used to cook revealed them. The camp was bombarded, and despite what rumors might have said, Gestido didn't take part in it, his task was reconnaissance. By that point the revolution was already defeated, but that was the final nail to the coffin.\n\nGestido didn't reflect on it, until the Motincito happened in 1938 and he saw how the Marzist regime turned more authoritarian and fascist-friendly. As he began to develop his left-wing leanings, he realized the mistake he had made by fighting for the government. He had the chance of joining a patriotic crusade and didn't, instead he chose to fight for those who were cozy with the Germans, those who were ravaging Europe and most importantly, England. Sure, he could use the excuse of "obediencia debida" to not feel bad about himself, but the truth is that he was not brave enough. Lopez Silveira showed a generation of young soldiers how someone can do the good fight despite adversity.\n\nSo, when Gestido got word that the democratic opposition was talking about preparing an incursion to free Uruguay, he decided to volunteer for it. He quickly was named as its leader, thanks to his military experience and his heroic statues for his work aiding the victims of the 1959 floods. Now in victory his name might carry the same weight as those of heroes like Leandro Gómez, but the old General can only worry about whether he did enough to cleanse the sins of his past."

 POLITICS_SUPREME_CORTE_DE_JUSTICIA_DESC: "Article 150 of the Uruguayan constitution of 1952: "The §YConsejo Nacional de Gobierno§! is made up of nine members directly elected by the people, together with double the number of alternates, for a term of four years, with the guarantees and in accordance with the rules established for voting in Section III, considering the Republic as a single electoral constituency".\n\nArticle 155: "If on the date on which the Consejo Nacional de Gobierno§! is to assume its functions, the new National Councilors who must integrate it have not yet been proclaimed, the §MCorte Suprema de Justicia§! will provisionally perform those functions in the meantime".\n\nWhile in theory this would mean that the Corte Suprema should have only taken power after the first of march of 1965, the fact that the elected Herrerist-Ruralist council had collaborated with Aguerrondo, and worse, Juan Domingo Perón, meant that the mostly Colorado-controlled military wanted to speed up the process while maintaining the legalist tradition that had distinguished Uruguay from the other Latin American countries. And so, the Corte Suprema was handed over the executive power after all the Nationalists councilors and their alternates were kicked out.\n\nThere are those who fear that the Corte Suprema is not up to the challenge of having to rule a nation that has to recover from a foreign-backed coup attempt and that is entering into another §gGrey Scare§!, and they might be right, but in times like these, all are called to serve their country regardless of status or capabilities."

 POLITICS_JORGE_PACHECO_ARECO_DESC: "A politician described by the American embassy as "a man with a good heart but not very bright and probably unable to take leadership after the death of César" doesn't inspire too much trust. And to be fair, that is the general reaction of the public, but nevertheless Pacheco was the man Gestido chose, and so he is the President of Uruguay.\n\nPacheco was born in 1920 as the son and grandson of politicians. He was the son of the doctor and deputy Manuel Pacheco, who was related to José Batlle y Ordoñez, since his father was the brother of Batlle's wife. His maternal grandfather was Ricardo Areco, a Vierists, and Pacheco decided to follow in his footsteps by becoming one. It would prove to be a bad choice, as Vierism, stuck between Batllism, Riverism and Sosism quickly died out because of its irrelevance. And some Vierists, like Eduardo Blanco Acevedo, became Marzists.\n\nPerhaps in another life Pacheco could have ended as one of Charlone's lackeys, but lucky for his future political career he was friends with Raumar Jade and knew his family. The father of his friend, Raúl, suggested to Pacheco that he should use his family connections with the Batlles in order to get a job in "El Día", the Batllists newspaper, Pacheco realized that it was a good opportunity, and so he took the advice and ended up as a reporter. He wrote articles that supported the candidacy of Gestido, and soon enough he obtained enough prestige to be a candidate for deputy and senator.\n\nThe path to the presidency was an accidental one, Gestido and the other high-profile members of the UCB wouldn't resign from the Council in order to run, the General's friends refused the offer of being President and a candidate was needed before Charlone could use the lack of one as an advantage to nominate someone loyal to him. In the end Pacheco was chosen and elected. His detractor says that he is a dull man, but whether this is true or not, Pachecho will need to prove it during his presidency."

 POLITICS_MARTIN_ECHEGOYEN_DESC: "For a man who was called "the most intelligent man at the service of the caudillo Herrera", Echegoyen quickly went against his mentor's wishes by maintaining the alliance with the Ruralists and cooling down the anti-Americanism of the Herrerists. But perhaps it was his own intelligence that told him that he should go against what Herrera wanted if it proved beneficial to him.\n\nEchegoyen's political life began not where you would expect from the leader of the main wing of Herrerism, as in his young days he was part of the Partido Blanco Radical, a left-wing and anti-Herrerist split of the National Party. It was not to last however, because Echegoyen changed his mind and threw his weight behind Herrera, which proved good to his career, as Echegoyen won his trust and subsequently landed a job as a minister of the Terrist cabinet. His participation in the Marzist regime wouldn't end just there, as Echegoyen negotiated with Germany the funding for the Rincón del Bonete dam, an activity that saw him traveling to the Third Reich and meeting Adolf Hitler himself, who condecorated him with the Nazi golden eagle.\n\nSince then, Echegoyen has been called a fascist. His alliance with the Ruralists made him and his followers more amicable to the US, which reduced the weight behind this line of attack. However, it was a betrayal of what Herrera believed in, and it was felt when the orthodox Herrerist won a considerable number of votes in the 1962 elections, enough to scare Echegoyen and made him realize something had to be done.\n\nThe road ahead became clear then, to consolidate his position he had to beat them at their own game. The prize, if he is successful, is to have full control of the Herrerist movement and pass to history as a worthy successor of Herrera and as a great caudillo.\n\nOf course, the Americans might have a say on his plans."

 POLITICS_ALBERTO_GALLINAL_HEBER_DESC: "Alberto Gallinal Heber had everything in life to do what he wanted. He could have been a painter, pianist, perhaps an opera singer, a notable tribune, writer and poet, performer, prestigious lawyer and who knows how many more things. But no, he preferred to be a servant and fight against misery, hunger, illiteracy and disease. He fixed hospitals, built schools, houses, cut thorns, bagged locusts and dug ditches. And now he is the President of Uruguay.\n\nThe fourth son of Alejandro Gallinal, a noteworthy rancher and politician in the times of Batlle y Ordoñez, Gallinal Heber found himself managing his family lands before joining the ARU. He stood out in the organization for his work on horse breeding and in fighting mange and foot-and-mouth disease, and soon he found himself as the President of the Florida chapter, having made a name for himself. Later he formally joined politics and was among the founders of the Unión Blanca y Democrática in 1956, being a candidate to the Council in 1958 but failing to be elected.\n\nIn the meantime, he continued to carry out his characteristic philanthropic work, being part of the National Commission for Aid to the Victims presided by Gestido, directing the construction of new premises for rural schools, the remodeling of the Pereira Rossell Hospital maternity and the Maciel hospital, among other notable things. As always, he kept his involvement in politics, and in 1964, feeling that the UBD was corrupt, ineffective and soft on trade unionism, he and a few others split to create their own sector, the Movimiento Nacional de Rocha, condemning the UBD to death.\n\nOf course, the MNR by its own couldn't be elected, even with Gallinal Heber as their candidate, so a coalition with a UBD remnant, the Reconstrucción Blanca, was formed. They managed to win in the end, but now they have to keep their coalition together if Gallinal Heber hopes to continue his work."

 POLITICS_JUAN_PEDRO_RIBAS_MARZIST_DESC: "Ribas was just one of the many conservative military men in the Marzist regime, loyal Uruguayan patriots and ardent supporters of the Spanish nationalists. His loyalty to the regime was well rewarded, earning him a chance to meet his idol Franco and a spot as general. His tenure in this post was short as the Batllist demagogues soon seized control of his country, seeing fit to accuse him of being an Argentinean traitor, humiliating him by suggesting he would ever betray his dear Uruguay, a grave insult to his honor that would force him to resign.\n\nAn admirer of Eduardo Blanco Acevedo, he joined his movement after Marzism's demise. New life would be breathed into his career thanks to the politics of compromise in a move that got him into government as a man responsible for preventing coups for the people who labeled him a coup plotter. His tensions with Luis Batlle quickly grew into a macho affair where Ribas left the government and dueled Luis. This made him a darling of the far-right who Ribas would claim to the press, begged him to coup the government, something he would refuse out of a lack of desire to act as a tutor to his nation.\n\nClearly, Ribas has changed his mind. The Colegiado was an evil that Marzists fought before to defeat in 1933. When Charlone offered him the chance to finish their duty and restore order as interim president until new elections could be held, Ribas could not refuse. Yet now he finds himself in a familiar position under Charlone, a condescending paternalism like that he experienced under Luis, Ribas can only wonder if he is getting the respect he deserves."

 POLITICS_JUAN_PEDRO_RIBAS_FALANGIST_DESC: "Above all else, Ribas is loyal to Uruguay. He dutifully served in the military under the Marzist regime and would have continued to do so under Luis Batlle had he not been tarred and feathered by him with accusations of acting as a lap dog for the Argentines, any man with a shred of honor would have resigned the same as he did.\n\nRibas' entry into the government would prove to be as quick as his departure, despising the paternalistic attitude Luis regarded with, topping off his exit with a duel between himself and Luis. This macho exhibition would win him the love of the far-right who he would claim that they tried to beg him to coup the government, rejecting these pleas out of a lack of desire to act as a tutor to his nation. His fame would earn him an invite to join Aguerrondo's coup only to defect when the plotter enlisted Argentine help, proving himself to be a Perónist stooge.\n\nThis situation forced Ribas to create his own paramilitary - Defensa Armada Nacionalista - to assist in defeating the coup. The takeover was prevented but the porteños, the eternal enemies of the Orientals could not accept this, leading to Perón's retaliation. Uruguayan women and children lie dead on the streets in the wake of the Platinean Blitz for daring not to follow Buenos Aires. The Oriental people cry out for each traitor to be hanged on a Montevideo lamppost for their evils. Ribas has been propelled to power by these desires for vengeance, offering the worried people the promise they desire:\n\n§V¡Uruguayos, nunca más!§!"

 POLITICS_MARIO_OSCAR_AGUERRONDO_DESC: "Certainly, Mario Óscar Aguerrondo is not the first military man who desired to coup the Uruguayan government, and neither is he the first to have answered Benito Nardone's call for a coup to solve the Colegiado problem, but he is the first to have succeeded in the 20th century, managing to be left as the ruler of the nation in the aftermath.\n\nOne might ask what his motivation is; for starters, Aguerrondo is a Herrerist, and thus, at least in principle, an enemy of Batllism and everything it stands for. And like so many hardliners, not only in Herrerism but in the Uruguayan right in general, he believes that Batllism is either socialistic or communistic, or that it is a proxy for communists who want to destroy the country, and so it has to be purged if not outright destroyed. This opposition towards the legacy of Batlle and to the red menace was not unknown; it was precisely the reason why Nardone appointed him as the Police Chief of Montevideo. He was not ready for the position, but he learned to use it to build up his future military career. Attaining the rank of General, he defeated the opposition that watched his rise with worry thanks to his unsubtle fascist-sympathies.\n\nHis sympathies for fascism are precisely the reason for why one could make the mistake, at least in his eyes, of calling him a fascist. It matters not that many of the members of the coalition of forces that allowed his coup either admire Hitler, Mussolini, Franco or Perón. For Aguerrondo all those are foreign ideologies; he is just a Uruguayan nationalist, an Artiguist.\n\nWould Artigas support what Aguerrondo is about to do? He certainly believes that is the case, and it is not like anyone can convince him of the contrary, given that they will soon be in prison or dead."

 POLITICS_PABLO_MORATORIO_DESC: "The story of Pablo Moratorio goes back to 1938, when he was just a colonel in the army. His brother Saúl was involved with the Motincito, and Moratorio knew it would happen. Allegedly he informed the authorities of the plot, although the truthfulness of this statement is highly questionable. In any case, he benefited from it thanks to his brother. When Moratorio became a general in the 40s he was known as a Marzist general, enjoying the protection of Blanco Acevedo and Charlone when democracy was restored in 1946.\n\nHis allegiance to the National Party made the Blancos appoint him as the Director of the Frigorífico Nacional upon their electoral victory in 1958, which proved good for Moratorio as his face became known in the Interior, which made him a valuable ally for putschists in the army. For a time, they believed that Moratorio would be the man who would grant them their desired junta, but he has failed them. Before being an ideological plotter, he is an opportunist. Moratorio would have no problems joining a cause only to abandon it if he saw it was to fail. His most sacred value is to seek his personal safety and well-being.\n\nWith Ribas removed thanks to his attempt to turn his interim position to a permanent one, Charlone needed to nominate a President who would have the support of the nationalistic or putschist sectors of the now legalist-purged army. And Moratorio was up to the job. Unlike Ribas, he is happy to play his part, only demanding to be paid for it."

 POLITICS_PABLO_MORATORIO_AGUERRONDO_DESC: "The story of Pablo Moratorio goes back to 1938, when he was just a colonel in the army.

Moratorio would have no problems joining a cause only to abandon it if he saw it was to fail. His most sacred value is to seek his personal safety and well-being.\n\nHowever, there is a little amount of principle in Moratorio's character. He sincerely dislikes Juan Domingo Perón and Peronism. He was skeptical of requesting his aid to carry out Aguerrondo's coup, but at the time he let his doubts go since external help was needed to carry it out successfully. It proved to be a mistake however, given that as Moratorio feared, Aguerrondo began to increasingly get closer to Perón. Fearful of the Colonel finally obtaining what he wanted: the subjugation of Uruguay, Moratorio removed the man he helped install. Now he rules at his place, and given that no announcement confirming that elections would be called in 1966 was made, it seems Moratorio hopes to secure his seat."

 POLITICS_VENTURA_RODRIGUEZ_DESC: "There is a lot of cynicism around the concept of "necessary evil". Many men use it as an excuse to commit all the sins their hearts desire. But Ventura Rodríguez is different. He is one of the few who sincerely knows that what he has done is wrong, but that he had to do it regardless. He won't ask for forgiveness; he only wants to finish a job that is already done so he can go home.\n\nBy himself Rodríguez was of little note, but his affiliation with the National Party made him an attractive asset to Aguerrondo, who welcomed Rodríguez into his personal fiefdom: the Montevideo Police. Soon they became close and Rodríguez became a person in which Aguerrondo could trust to run things once he had to go, either by promotion or by the Colorados kicking him out. As such, Rodríguez was one of Aguerrondo's close allies by the time his coup came to be.\n\nAnd they triumphed, and the Republic was saved from the Batllist demagogy that was the Colegiado, but Rodríguez then became aware of a bigger threat to Uruguay: the refusal of Aguerrondo and his loyalists to let go. To his horror, he realized that unlike him, his comrades-in-arms didn't desire the return of liberal democracy, and perhaps, any democracy at all.\n\nStruck by this realization and afraid of becoming a second Baldomir in the eyes of history, he began to plot. And when Moratorio decided that Aguerrondo had to go, Rodríguez offered him the forces of the Minister of the Interior. But Rodríguez was not a fool, he knew that Moratorio would have to be forced out as well, and so it was done when he was sufficiently prepared. Now his thankless job is to somehow make the military ready to accept the fact that democracy is returning. Rodríguez won't accept anything else."

 POLITICS_DOMINGO_TORTORELLI_DESC: "From Magadan to Monterrey (heading west not east, damn you) there is not a man or woman that has heard of the greatness (read: ridiculousness) of Domingo Tortorelli. In that brutish land of Esempi not a single no-life egg-addled masked-teen-abuser-apologist is aware of him; similarly, if you were to interrogate the gimcrack alternates and knock-off joke SCPs that made up Alex Kister's entries in the Scrimblo Catalogue they too would not know who he was.\n\nAre you surprised, motherfucker? This is a minor crackpot politician in Montevideo in the 50s; what were you expecting, dickhead?\n\nIn 1938 - with leftists such as Batllists prohibited from running, Domingo Tortorelli ran for President for the first time as the leader of the Concordancia Laboral. In a quintessential display of nepotism he named his nondescript wife Anatolia Manrupe his running mate. He decided it was a good time for him, and it was... just not to become President. Instead he became a source of entertainment for the good people of Uruguay, who stopped by his balcony to hear him, well, rant.\n\nTortorelli proposed that free milk taps should be placed in every corner. That a road be built between Rivera and Montevideo, going downhill so that cargo trucks would save fuel. He said that if he became President he would decree that the working day would be only 15 minutes. He claimed that he would pass a law that would grant all 18-year-olds a public job. Most impressive of all: he promised them that if they voted for him, he would cut the price of herb, sugar and of course, wine by half!\n\nOf course the ungrateful scrimblos of Uruguay didn't know how great an opportunity they were being given, so they never gave him more than 50 votes in the general elections. I don't mean 50 seats, I mean 50 ballots. Of course Tortorelli had his own hypotheses about this: he claims that it must have been a joint plot of Tommy Douglas, Juan Perón and Luis Batlle Berres to steal his slogans and claim them as his own. Obviously these conspiracy theories are all wrong - he lost because he's a moron.\n\nAnd so are you, idiot. What the hell are you doing going to a country that doesn't have content (yet), wasting time pressing that stupid tilde key, and typing "set_ruling_party esoteric_nazism"? Go addle your probably teenage brain watching Minecraft YouTubers larping (that's what they're doing, don't ping me), or better yet play TNO Brazil or something and come back exactly 2 time from now! Go peel the shell off a boiled egg; don't you know they make such delicious chips?"

 POLITICS_PILAR_BARRIOS_DESC: "In 1930, to celebrate the centenary of the nation, Dr. Celedonio Nin y Silva wrote that luckily in Uruguay "the disquieting problems of the Indian or the black, which concern so much the generality of the American nations" were not present. Despite the fact that the Negro Ansina was known by everyone as Artigas' most loyal friend and how candombe is respected as one of the elements which make Uruguayan culture unique, that was the treatment given to the Afro-Uruguayans, complete invalidation of their existence.\n\nIn 1936 to fight this, a new party joined the ranks dominated by the eternal fight between white and red, only that his party would wear black as a color. The Black Indigenous Party (PAN) was the child of Nuestra Raza magazine, created by Elemo Cabral and the Barrio brothers to "fight tenaciously for the interests of the colored race" and support "all work, idea or initiative that tends to the progress and improvement of it". The Italian invasion of Ethiopia made the magazine organize the "Committee of the Black Race Against War and Fascism", which later led to the idea of creating a proper political party to defend the interests of the Afro-Uruguayans.\n\nSadly, these efforts lead to nowhere, and the failures of the PAN to win parliamentary representation led to his dissolution in 1944. It would take 20 years for it to be reborn, as in desperation because of the demolition of the Mediomundo conventillo Barrios decided to do the unthinkable, open the console and write "How do you turn this on". With the resulting vehicular power obtained, Barrios proceeded to own the racists.\n\nAs he had enough gold, Barrios proceeded to create a gazillion priest units to convert the population of Uruguay to his cause. The ManTM tried to resist, but not even a lackey of the New World Order could resist the power of "i r winner" and thus, pan-Africanist Uruguay was born. The new country sees Western Africa with interests, as Barrios is interested in freeing them from French colonialism and Cameroonian imperialism."

 POLITICS_WILSON_FERREIRA_ALDUNATE_DESC: "Wilson Ferreira Aldunate's enemies call him a sophist. Others claim that his "relentless voice" and "good looks" have "wrought havoc on several generations of women". But Blancos look on him as the hope of a new generation of their party.\n\nWilson doesn't use the word, but people call him a progressive. This seems strange to some—he's a Blanco, a National Party man; he should be a conservative through and through, should he not? But only fools doubt that his ideological dissent from the PN renders him ashamed of his Blanco background. He got it from his family. Though Wilson Ferreira Aldunate's birthplace is actually the town of José Batlle y Ordoñez, the birth certificate records it as Nico Pérez some distance away—for his family would sooner die than let the newborn's records be contaminated by the name of a Colorado.\n\nWilson's loyalty to the National Party should not be interpreted as blind tolerance for its evils. In his youth, Wilson was a Herrerist—but Herrera's faithlessness led Wilson and his family to defect to the Partido Nacional Independiente. Under Carlos Quijano's wise mentorship, Wilson began his political life, fought against Marzism, and supported the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nTime passed. The early 60s knew him as Ferreira, a loyal liberal conservative except for his endorsement of land reform—for which his fellow ranchers called him a class traitor. But the end of that decade saw him become Wilson, warrior against corruption, defender of public liberties—for in those years the man had come to realise that Uruguay needed deep reform. Leftists heard him talk and cheered, 'blancos baratos' condemned him; in the end it mattered not. When Wilson spoke to the Nation of the destruction of corruption, land reform, and the nationalisation of banks, conservatives and left-wingers united to put him in the Residencia de Suárez.\n\nThe new President raises the standards under which the late Aparicio Saravia once stood: free elections and administrative honesty. Saravia succeeded in death—the question now is whether Wilson will succeed in life."

Don't let his luxurious mansion in Punta del Este - to which he might invite you if you pique his curiosity - trick you, Haedo is a self-made man. Born into poverty, he has achieved everything by hard political work.\n\nOnce a loyal Herrerist, Haedo as an established caudillo now forges his own path, betraying his allies and changing his positions left and right. Haedo's fellow Herrerists all want to get rid of him, since his open pro-fascism ruins the whole movement's reputation, his recent honest admiration for Castro and Guevara aside. But Herrera's death opened a window of opportunity to seize control over the entire Herrerist movement, and he will not surrender without a fight.§!"
 URG_Faustino_Harrison_hog_desc: "§YPresident of the Council\nPopulist Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LA former high school teacher finds himself in the historic position of being the last President of the Council of the Herrerist-Ruralist government elected in 1958. Certainly, Harrison has reasons to be proud of all that his movement has accomplished. But he can't shake off the feeling that tells him that he should do more, that he should try to save his country.\n\nGraduating as a notary public in 1928, Harrison developed his activity in the department of Florida. After the resignation of Alberto Gallinal Heber from the intendancy in 1951, Harrison took over as his alternate. Afterwards he was one of the founders and most important leaders of the Federal Ruralist Action League. Many Ruralists, like their leader Benito Nardone, have become disappointed in politics and want to retreat from the political arena and focus on unionism. But Harrison still sees the merit in political participation.§!"
 URG_Luis_Batlle_Berres_hog_desc: "§YPresident of the Council\nSocial Radicalism§!\n--------------\n§LLeft orphan at age 11, Luis was adopted and raised by his uncle, the renowned José Batlle y Ordoñez. José ended up being a father for Luis, and the young man decided to honor his memory by entering politics and expanding on his work. It was non an easy road, first he had to flee thanks to the Terrist dictactorship. And when it seemed that Baldomir would end it, he fell and Charlone took his place. When democracy was finally restored, his cousins, jealous of Luis' popularity, managed to name him Vice President of Tomás Berreta in a bid to stop his rise. But Berreta died and Luis proved to be an independent operator. None could stop now his attempts on honoring the life of his beloved uncle.\n\nCredited by the prosperities of the 50s and the economic crash that shattered the Colorado hegemony in Uruguay, Luis always maintained that the Uruguayan people voted for the National Party in 1958 due to them being tricked or as some kind of joke, not thinking they would win. It seems that Luis can't deal with the fact that he has some responsibility on the first electoral defeat of his party in a century, a defect that could sink his third tenure, as has sunk his relationship with other batllist like Zelmar Michelini.§!"

 URG_Homero_Martinez_for_desc: "§YChancellor of the Republic\nConservatism§!\n--------------\n§LGiven their stereotypical hotheadedness and incapacity to understand the subtleties of life, one would think that the Chancellery was no place for a military man. But Homero Martínez Montero, a prolific author on geography, history, and geopolitics, very much breaks that mold.\n\nMartínez Montero is not a mere decoration piece. Quite the contrary: his main job as the Chancellor of the Republic has been to handle a question that has bedeviled Uruguay for decades: the exact Argentine-Uruguayan frontier on the Uruguay River. Martínez Montero's solution: the Uruguay River Boundary Treaty of 1961, which has satisfied both countries even though it leaves some questions - such as who owns Martín García Island - up in the air.§!"

 URG_Omar_Diaz_for_desc: "§YChancellor of the Republic\nPeronism§!\n--------------\n§LOmar Díaz is one of the newest additions to the old lineage of infamous traitors that exists in Uruguay since the betrayal of Artigas. And like Venancio Flores, who got the Brazilians to blast the city of Paysandú into submission, Díaz also supports an enemy who would do anything in his power to have Uruguay under his feet. Of all the fascist sympathizers in the Oriental Republic, Omar Díaz might be the worst of them (depending on who you ask) by virtue of being, unironically, a Peronist.\n\nBut perhaps "failure" describes Diaz better than "traitor". Díaz was tasked with spreading Peronism to Uruguay, and he has only 1500 votes to show for it after all these years. His only relevancy, and the reason he became Chancellor of the Republic, is that Díaz is connected to all sorts of nationalistic groups, from conservatives to Nazi guerrillas. His negotiation with them was crucial to secure the success of Aguerrondo's coup. But the fact that he calls Peronist before Artiguist angers many nationalists and makes them want rid of him...§!"

 URG_Juan_Carlos_Quagliotti_marzist_for_desc: "§YChancellor of the Republic\nAristocratic Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LThe tenure of Juan Carlos Quagliotti as Chancellor of the Republic was another of the conditions that Aguerrondo and the Blancos demanded from Charlone to accept his proposal of him being appointed as the new Finance Minister, and Ribas being chosen as the "apolitical" military ruler of the nation until the 1966 elections if the coup was to succeed. It wasn't a surprise that Aguerrondo would demand for him to have a post in the administration, after all both were personal friends and Quagliotti supported his putschist ambitions with the relatively small network of aligned businessmen he had established.\n\nSaid network (and much of Quagliotti's merits to be considered a candidate for the Chancellery), were born of the myth that Quagliotti has built around himself, that he is a kind of "superspy", just a few phone calls away from the Führer. Charlone appears willing to tolerate these lies for the time being in virtue of having a reliable man, Juan Carlos Blanco, as the Vice Chancellor.§!"

Before Nardone, with Herrera's consent, appointed him Minister of Finance, Azzini was a political independent and a professor. The Ruralists trust him implicitly as the perfect man to implement their economic agenda. For the other Blancos, Azzini is their best hope to destroy the dirigiste economics that in their eyes have nearly bankrupted Uruguay.\n\nAzzini's pet project was the Exchange and Monetary Reform Law, which ended a byzantine, corruption-prone foreign-currency exchange system. During his tenure protectionism has also been largely abandoned, leading to the closure of local industries.

He famously said: "I flatly refuse to vote for this candidate. Because I know him. He is capable of putting four wheels on the Bank and taking it home".\n\nLike Nardone, Harrison and others, Gari believed that the military had to rescue the country through a coup d'état. In fact, Gari became one of Aguerrondo's most vital supporters, not because of his importance as a Ruralist leader, but because of his wealth, connections and influence. It was widely known that a Ruralist would be appointed as the Minister of Finance given their alliance with the military, but observers have been taken aback by Gari being the choice. Not because he is known for his democratic values or anything, but because he has ruined any future political career he could have when democracy returned. But for Gari the matter is quite simple, if he is in charge of the economy, he has a larger plate to eat from.§!"
 URG_Cesar_Charlone_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nControlled Democracy\nFu Manchu§!\n--------------\n§LDr. Charlone is known by various names. You might be familiar with his most famous name "Fu Manchu", given to him thanks to his Revaluation Law of 1935, which provided the state with almost 50 million pesos without modifying the legal gold backing of the Uruguayan currency. Another nickname given to him is "Nazi", but only the perfidious left calls him that. César Charlone is not a Nazi; he is only a conservative awarded a Golden Eagle and might have been a guest of honor in Germany two or three times.\n\nHe already served his country as Finance Minister and President during the March Revolution, but he has returned to his old post to save Uruguay once again from the Batllist demagogy and its Colegiado. Charlone truly doesn't desire to govern again, he is just a very special advisor for the President, who is kind enough to regularly follow his advice.§!"

His experience is more than sufficient: he has service as director of the Military Institute of Higher Studies and Inspector-General of the Army under his belt.\n\nFurthermore, as he is affiliated with the National Party, the Blancos view him as a perfect candidate. Afraid of the Colorado-controlled military overthrowing them in service to the party of Batlle, the Blancos hope to use Rebollo to politicize the military in their favor. His willingness to support repression against students and unions is also a bonus in their eyes. But Rebollo, for all his perceived merits or demerits, is not Pablo Moratorio - he lacks the support of the Blanco-affiliated putschist in the army.

The present crisis and state of things aren't a sign of temporary problems, they are a sign that something is broken fundamentally; not just in the economic sense, but spiritually. The Republic was world renowned for its dedication to civic virtue and the idea of a progressive democracy, but those illusions were shattered through the smoke of guns and the spilling of innocent blood.\n\nThere are those who refuse to admit this truth, but they know they are lying to themselves. Some of them still try to do the good fight through the proper channels: political participation, demonstrations, all the things that made Batlle smile. But there are those who wonder if those who shall not be named speak the truth. Would it be so bad to give them a chance?\n\n§RAs Uruguay sinks, the Orientals wonder if daring to believe was a sin.§!"

 URG_switzerland_mirage_4_desc:0 "Whoever dared to call Uruguay "The Switzerland of America" was an utter fool, but the joke is on the Orientals for believing in it. Did they seriously believe that they, South Americans as they are, were capable of building something resembling Europe?; something that could rise above from what was expected from them? Why had they dared to dream? Because Batlle sold them into a lie? What fools they were.\n\nOf course, foreigns or subversive actors could always be blamed for the current situation, but the truth is far too obvious to be able to be hidden. It is as Rivera said, the Orientals have never known as many bad days as they have since they became independent. They collapsed the country on their own, they have nobody else to point their fingers to but the mirrors in which their reflection awaits them. Isn't it fitting that the national hero is Artigas? A broke, betrayed man who died in exile far away from home, with everyone in his homeland having forgotten and moved from him.\n\n§xThe Dream is dead, perhaps forever.§!"
 URG_the_lost_limb: "The Lost Limb"
 URG_the_lost_limb_desc: "While Fascism triumphed in Europe, in Uruguay it was defeated thanks to the heroism of Lopez Silveria and the people of Montevideo. This dissonance made the Republic a victim of the Nazi yoke despite the distance, as the Reich imposed unfair tariffs of Uruguayan exports.\n\nWith its access to the vital Western European markets reduced and under the rationale of a "turn to the OFN", Uruguay successfully approached the US and managed to make gains in the American market. This however has increased the dependency on the Northern Giant. While deals with Iberia and Japan had been made to balance growing foreign influence, the truth is that the lost markets cannot be replaced. Recovering them would mean détente with the Reich, but past and present German aggression, combined with the pro-fascist history of some who support this concept, makes debate on the matter difficult at best."

 URG_merchants_of_death_desc: "§MFray Bentos se fue a la guerra, ¡qué dolor, qué dolor, qué pena!§!\n\nThe secret behind the Switzerland of America are its corned beef and textile exports. The former being a delicacy enjoyed by the British and, to the shame of many, German soldiers during World War Two. Uruguay has attempted to diversify its exports. But the truth of the matter is that the Republic - and most importantly its welfare state - depends on the wartime demand for both products, the effects of peacetime on the economy being shown during the economic crash of the late 50s.\n\nBut the mere inevitability of war in this rotten world will not send Uruguay back to the times of the fat cows. The biggest problem, which both the Uruguayan citizens and political class choose to ignore, is that the current model of development is worn out beyond usability. If the Republic is to be saved, Uruguay must not only profit from the emerging wars §O- it must also make an honest effort to modernize and increase its production§!. §RIf the Nation fails at this task, it cannot but decay on and on until it collapses§!."
 URG_the_enemy_within: "The Enemy Within"
 URG_the_enemy_within_desc: "The lasting legacy of the Marzist regime is not the belief, but the certainty, that there is a nazifascist subversive element hidden in Uruguay, hosted by a conservative class that at best barely hides its unliberal sympathies. To fight against this menace, §MNazi hunters§! travel across all four corners of Uruguay searching for the elusive §rNSDAP (AO-LU)§!, uncovering conspiracies and plots along the way. Usually, they make enough of a fuss that the government is obligated to make an official investigation into the matter, mostly to avoid another §gGrey Scare§!, but sometimes their paranoia regarding fascist infiltration turns out to be based on thin air, or worse yet, misguided ambitions of being the next Fernández Artucio.\n\nAfter all, with the illusion of the Switzerland of America fading away in the eyes of the people, isn't it better to blame all the problems of the country on a common enemy? Not to mention how useful it is for the OFN and political actors that Uruguayans are afraid of foreign subversion. In that manner they can ensure that the Republic is firmly on the side of the free world, or benefit from free electoral propaganda against their political enemies."
