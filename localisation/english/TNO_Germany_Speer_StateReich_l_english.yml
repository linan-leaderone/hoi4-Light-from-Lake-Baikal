 SGR_Bohemia_Question:0 "Heim ins Reich, Böhmen-Mähren"
 SGR_Bohemia_Question_desc:0 "For over two decades, the economic and political situation in the German Reich has seen Bohemia and Moravia stand firmly to the side as a loyal Protektorat. The chaotic upheaval of the Bürgerkrieg has blasted the winds of change throughout much of Europe, and now the time has come to rethink its current status."

 SGR_Issue_of_Slovakia:0 "The Issue of Slovakia"
 SGR_Issue_of_Slovakia_desc:0 "Having annexed the territory of Böhmen und Mähren, the Reich turns its monolithic gaze to the territory of Slovakia. Surrounded, with no friendly nations to back them up, and being simple to return back into the fold of the Pakt, we will issue them a concise ultimatum. They will either join, or we will smash open their pitiful army and march straight into Bratislava."
 
 SGR_Moskowien_Question:0 "In the Heart of Russia"
 SGR_Moskowien_Question_desc:0 "The plains of blood and snow await our attention in the east. The disappearance of Siegfried Kasche has shifted the political landscape of Moskowien, a situation we must maintain absolute control over if the Reich's territories are to survive and thrive."

 SGR_Take_Moskowien:0 "Prepare for the Reconquest"
 SGR_Take_Moskowien_desc:0 "[GetSGR_Take_Moskowien_desc]"
 SGR_Take_Moskowien_desc_MSK:0 "The operation to retake Moskowien will be brutal. Trudging through what is essentially Europe's endless war field, the only silver lining remains in the fact that the country's shattering into many pieces has likewise shattered the morale of the civilians. There won't be many partisans left to oppose us, and we will mainly have to deal with whatever cobbled-up military might stand in our way. We should still be cautious, however, and not underestimate how difficult this may get."
 SGR_Take_Moskowien_desc_PAU:0 "The case of von Helldorff is a unique one. He would have been a highly useful tool to us, putting priority on the Aryan colonists and making sure that Germany would inevitably reign at the top. The key word is 'would' have. Pushing aside even the Führer's personal distaste for the man, von Helldorff's track record after Kasche's disappearance has been disaster after disaster. He is in no form to govern a colony as important as Moskowien, and the Führer has no qualms to let the man know by force."
 SGR_Take_Moskowien_desc_OKB:0 "Von Saucken is a traitor, there is no argument about it. His government, following the disappearance of Kasche and Helldorff, is a perversion of the Reich's goals. His attempts to flush out the government from, in his own words, the "brown mob", have been half-hearted, with many still lurking within the government. He is publicly, in all senses of the word, an enemy of the state. His ideological differences - prevalent in von Saucken's reported personal hatred of Hitler - give all the reason to justify the fatherland taking back their colony. There will be no room for a king. Only a Führer."
 SGR_Take_Moskowien_desc_MOS:0 "Bronislav Kaminski, head of the collaborator party NSPR-V who turned into one of the most prolific collaborators in Moskowien, has now taken full charge of the country after the disappearance of Kasche and the subsequent fracturing of the colony. Reports are mixed, yet harrowing. Some claim that Kaminski wants to make a country where the Russians would govern themselves, leaving the fate of Moskowien Germans in question. Others have spoken about rampant militarization, and how Kaminski is not satisfied with only Moskowien. No matter. A mad dog is merely that - a rabid, short-sighted animal, put down by more civilized creatures."
 SGR_Take_Moskowien_desc_RDC:0 "With the former governor of Oryol now at the head of an independent Moskowien state, the security of our control over the continent is at stake. We don't know what Gorbachev is planning, and our contacts in Moskowien are dark. Just as with the case of Kasche's vanishing, Moskowien is under threat. This time, however, we are able to mobilize a response. Whatever plan Gorbachev has for the territory of Moskowien will be put to a stop, and the colony will thus return to the Pakt."

 SGR_Moskowien_Setup:0 "Reorganize Moskowien"
 SGR_Moskowien_Setup_desc:0 "With the long, empty territories of Moskowien finally back in our control, we must quickly re-organise it into a functional government. Alexis von Roenne will be instated as the official ruler of the country, and a military junta will be effectively established before we think about integrating it back into civilian control. They won't be happy, but they'll have to deal with it. It is better than whatever shattered Russian state could coax them into believing."
 GER_moskowien_conquered_trigger_tt:0 "Moskowien does not exist."
 SGR_Moskowien_Setup_tt:0 "§YMoskowien will be put under new administration.§!"

 SGR_Kaukasien_Question:0 "The Kaukasian Question"
 SGR_Kaukasien_Question_desc:0 "In the swirling dark fog of the Caucasus lies our most disconnected and mysterious Reichskommissariat. As a key producer of oil, this territory must be completely stabilized if it is to continue serving the interests of the Reich."

 SGR_Polish_Question:0 "The Polish Thorn"
 SGR_Polish_Question_desc:0 "History has clearly dictated that Poland must remain a sharp pain in Germany's side no matter the decade. With the Bürgerkrieg won, we must turn our attention eastwards and make a firm decision on how to deal with this thorn - once and for all."

 SGR_Norwegian_Question:0 "The Fortress Up North"
 SGR_Norwegian_Question_desc:0 "As the Bürgerkrieg raged on, Josef Terboven shocked the Reich by dismantling our northern Reichskommissariat and sending its garrison back to Germany. As of now, the new self-professed leader of Norway will receive our full attention, and we will plot how best to approach the future of this nation."

 SGR_Ostland_Question:0 "The Model Colony"
 SGR_Ostland_Question_desc:0 "The so-called 'model colony' of the Reich, once a bastion of strength and loyalty, has been ravaged by internecine warfare and chaos. To ensure stability in our territories, we will shift our eyes eastwards and deal with Reichskommissariat Ostland."

 SGR_reinforce_mauritius_reunion_desc:0 "Recent conflicts in the area have threatened our hold over the strategic outposts of Mauritius and Réunion - it is time to salvage this. A series of naval exercises shall be conducted in the Southwest Indian Ocean to reaffirm our presence. Like an eagle, the Kriegsmarine shall extend its wings and project its gaze far across the distant oceans of the world."

 SGR_place_nukes_mauritius_reunion:0 "Place Nuclear Weapons in Mauritius and Réunion"
 SGR_place_nukes_mauritius_reunion_desc:0 "The Reich's swords cannot just lie in Europe, far from threatening our rivals. No, we must extend the reach of our nuclear weaponry to not only threaten their core lands, but to threaten their possesions nearby as well. The islands of Mauritius and Réunion lay as the first step in surrounding our enemies with global hellfire."

 speerpropaganda.1.desc:0 "Wilhelm was giddy with excitement as he entered the museum. A museum! His first trip outside the city without his parents! His class had won a visit to the newly-opened "Bürgerkriegsmuseum" in Hamburg and now twenty-five boys between nine and ten years old, along with two teachers, had left Elmshorn for the great metropolis.\n\nEveryone was in awe at what they saw. Each room had its theme: "urban warfare" with reconstructed trenches; "politics" with an analysis of what caused the civil war; "espionage" with the tactics used by the contenders to gain the upper hand. Finally, the last room's theme was "letters from the front" with hundreds of missives sent by soldiers or militiamen to their dear ones during the war.\n\nWilhelm looked at one of the cases, and started reading: "Dear Kriemhild, I miss you so much. You have no idea how much I would like to return to you home, to return to you, but I can't.\nHeydrich has sent his wolves. Do you remember the small restaurant where we dined during last year's holiday? They hanged half of the village outside there, the rest are digging trenches for the SS. I won't let this happen to you, I swear it upon my life.\nThey'll probably attack tomorrow, and I'll be ready. I keep your photo next to my heart, if I die, I'll die with your name on my lips. I love you."\n\nA small plaque said "Eberhart Jenk, killed in action."\n\nWilhelm trembled at the words he had just read, and asked his teacher: "Teacher, who was Heydrich?"\n\nThe teacher's expression immediately turned sour, but he looked calmly at the boy and answered: "Heydrich was a man who wanted to see the world burn, and he was committed to see his desires realized. Tell me Wilhelm, do you want it too? Do you want to see the world burn?"\n\n"No!" said the child, "I want a happy world, I want to go with mama and papa to have fun!"\n\nThe teacher's face turned jovial again, and he chuckled, patting the boy's head: "Come now, it's late." then he raised his voice: "Class! Time to go, I hope the visit was instructive!""

Journalists, cameramen, policemen and common folk filled the rows left for the public, and it was entirely justified: Herbert Otto Gille, head of security in the traitor SS faction during the Bürgerkrieg, and directly responsible for hundreds, if not thousands of summary executions, had been captured less than a week ago while trying to pass the border between Elsass and the Ordensstaat.\n\nThe doors opened, and the crowd roared as Gille was brought to his desk. Some, most likely relatives to some of his victims, tried to breach security to get to him, but the police kept them away. When order returned inside the large room, the trial begun. Requested if he had any declaration, the defendant stood: "I do not recognise this court! Each and everyone of you holds no authority over me!" screams erupted, but he yelled even louder, "Don't you see this? This disorder, this decadence? Heydrich wanted to bring peace to Germany! A new order, a perfect order! He would have excised corruption like one removes a cancer! Look at you now, you are nothing but a gangrene on the perfect body of Germany!"\n\nA laugh interrupted his tirade. Amidst his fits, the prosecutor started a recording.\n"Thank you for your donation to our cause." came Gille's perfectly audible voice, "My wife will surely appreciate this fine necklace, and I can indeed make use of a new car, but how about we talk more important business?"\n"Herr Gille." the prosecutor chimed happily, ending the recording, "If we are a cancer on Germany, it seems you are far from being healthy..."\n\nA few seconds passed, then someone from the crowd started laughing, then another joined, then another, until the entire room was falling apart, the laughs audible from the road outside the courtroom. That day, newspapers and television news all featured the livid SS as he desperately tried to scream at the crowd to shut up, only to be drowned by the laughing."

 speerpropaganda.3.t:0 "A New Future of German Culinary Arts"
 speerpropaganda.3.desc:0 "It's hard to make out at first as the screen cleared up, but within the monochrome kitchen was a traditional German woman. "My, I need to prepare food for the family!" She exclaimed. "I must prepare the tools first, however. First things first," she began, reaching in for a knife. After doing so, the camera panned to showcase some fruit. "I need to cut the fruit..." She muttered, setting the knife down and beginning to dig into the food. After a few seconds, she let out an annoyed sigh and pulled the knife out, it showing barely any progress. "Darn it. Well, I have to check on the plates and see if they're clean."\n\nReaching down, she grabbed two plates in both hands and turned around to show them to the camera. Surprise and disgust mixed in her face as she looked at them. "Cracks!" She said, groaning as she stared at the damaged plates. "And these were perfectly fine just yesterday!"\n\nWhat sounded like a door opening was heard from the side, and a deeper, male voice interjected. "Honey!" He happily exclaimed, and she jolted a little, setting the plates down and walking over as the camera panned to her husband, who was carrying a large box. "I noticed the quality of our silverware and decided to take a look into the nearby store to see what they were selling and, oh, you cannot believe it!"\n\n"Can I?" The wife asked, motioning for the box to be settled down on the kitchen desk. "What makes this one stand out so much?" The husband chuckled and pointed towards a small label on the back. The camera zoomed in - it said 'MADE WITH ALL-GERMAN HANDS'. She raised her eyebrows. "Wow! You mean to tell me that this was all made by German workers?" He nodded. "In a German factory?" He nodded again. "Paid a fair, living wage, by German employers?" One last time, he nodded, and she smiled, turning towards the camera and crossing her arms."

 speerpropaganda.4.t:0 "Rinsing Out Evil"
 speerpropaganda.4.desc:0 "A burst of static filled the screen, before cutting to a man clad in black armor, holding a rifle in one hand and a flag in another. Stepping forward, he raised the flag and showed the old symbol of Germany, planting it in front of his feet. As he did, he took a step back and glanced at the flag, looking at it with curiosity. Then, curiosity turned into hostility, which turned into laughter. Shaking his head, the man merely gripped his rifle with both hands and pointed at the flag, pulling the trigger.\n\nGunfire erupted, and once he stopped, the camera panned back to the pole as the German flag fell. In cold, dead silence, a few seconds passed before another flag was lifted in its place. Pure black, with the Black Sun. Ordensstaat-Burgund.\n\nThe camera panned backwards as cruel laughter echoed, again and again. Ruined buildings and city blocks was all that there was to see - covering the entire span of the camera in smoke and destruction. It continued for almost a dozen seconds, before the camera switched yet again.\n\nThis time it was the clean streets of Germany proper. A young, healthy looking man, dressed in the colors of the Wehrmacht, was playing with two children, happily ruffling their hair and playing short games with them. In the distance, their parents watched, their faces approving and their smiles bright. As this was going on, a voice began speaking.\n\n"We must avoid the mistakes of the past that have led to cruelty. Yesterday, blood filled the streets in Germany. Today, peace reigns from our homes to the forests and the mountains. Tomorrow, we shall have an ethical Wehrmacht - one that will be incapable of committing the horrors that Germany was forced to follow in the past." Finally, the soldier bids the parents and their children farewell, and they amicably part ways."

 speerpropaganda.5.t:0 "Das Vaterland"
 speerpropaganda.5.desc:0 ""It's beginning dear! Bring the boys!" Hilde Schwartz yelled from the living room, and immediately the rest of the family was there: Gunther on the sofa by his wife's side, Hans and little Frank playing on the floor in front of the TV. A few seconds later, a tune started playing: publicized by newspapers and posters, "Das Vaterland" was a large historical series focused on teaching German history to the larger populace, mixing education and entertainment.\n\n"Good evening, and welcome to Das Vaterland!" The host beamed to the camera. "To my right we have Karl Manitius, director of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, the greatest study group on German Middle Age, and to my left Friedrich Zipfel, war veteran and expert in studies of the Second World War" the two men nodded politely. "This evening, we'll examine our relationship with the country widely considered as the greatest enemy of Germany throughout its history: France"\n\nThe show lasted until midnight, but to the family it felt like just minutes had passed. The reconstruction of the Battle of Bouvines, when France had unjustly refused the Holy Roman Empire as its legitimate lord, had fascinated the children; Gunther had appreciated Manitius's disquisition over how the French even allied with the infidels to oppose the Germans during the Thirty Years War; finally, Hilde was moved to tears by the recount of how how Louise, Queen of Prussia, was so brave as to personally face Napoleon when all hope had been lost.\n\nGunther collected Frank, who had fallen asleep, and made to the bedroom, but Hans tugged his trousers: "Daddy" came the child's sleepy voice, "will this happen again? The wars I mean, will France try to take our place again?" Gunther thought about it a second, then chuckled and patted his son's head: "No little one, it won't. Our Führer will protect us, as he did during the civil war." and then the family went to sleep together."

 speerpropaganda.6.t:0 "The Enemy Lurking Within"
 speerpropaganda.6.desc:0 "The streets of Munich were still dark, the tiniest flickering at the horizon foretelling the dawn, but Eberhard Gottlieb was already going to start the oven. A baker needs to have fresh bread for everyone from the get go, doesn't he? As he made his way through well-known roads, he gave a quick hello to the Orpo patrol passing the crossroad at 5:45 sharp, but something attracted his attention as soon as the Wacht had passed: just past the road, an entire wall had been covered in posters, all identical. He reached the nearest one, and stopped to look at it.\n\nThe imagery was simple but effective. A tall column stood at the center, with a large, golden eagle perched at the top, majestic and proud. At the bottom of the column, dozens of little men were busy with pickaxes trying to bring the towering structure down: some of them wore rich clothes, others didn't, but all of them had their pockets filled with green dollars, and looked at the eagle with a mixture of hate and fear. At the lower end of the poster, in large, Gothic letters, was written "Schützen Sie Deutschland!"\n\nEberhard looked at the poster for a few minutes, reflecting. Were really the Americans responsible for all that had happened? For the economic collapse, the Russian War, the Civil War? It was impossible, but still, they were Germany's enemies until a few years ago, so they would surely have everything to gain from a weak Reich... As he made his way to the bakery, Eberhard couldn't help one last thought."

 speerpropaganda.7.t:0 "It Starts With You!"
 speerpropaganda.7.desc:0 "The screen cuts to a band of young men, wearing traditional Hitler Youth clothing, climbing up a hill in an act of physical training. A voice crackles in - deep, slow, and soft. "Do you believe your child is aimless in their goals and ambitions? Perhaps they are lazy, and want to do nothing but waste their time with the various frivolities of life. If you are a concerned parent of this type of son, we suggest to you an easy solution!"\n\nIt changes once again. A boy no younger than seventeen stands tall, though awkward, and gives a small, unnecessary pause before speaking to the camera. "When I joined the Hitler Youth, I hated it at first. Everything was so orderly and disciplined. It was like being trapped in a cage. But after a few months, things got much better. I became fit," he said, then it cut to him running a marathon. "I became passionate," he continued, cutting to him standing on a podium and holding a speech in front of his fellow Youth members. "And I made many friends."\n\nAs it finally shifts to him speaking with other members, the narrator chimes in. "So that is that. As you can see, it can turn the life of any youth on his head! We recommend that all Aryan men join the Hitler Youth, so your body and mind will sharpen and strengthen in equal rank.""

 speerpropaganda.8.t:0 "Guns Into Ploughshares"
 speerpropaganda.8.desc:0 "All around him, gunfire rang. He was a soldier of the Reich - filled with grit and determination. In one bloodied hand he carried a pistol, and in the other a sharp, clean knife. Around him were the bodies of his fellow men, yet even more of the Bolshevik menace. He stared angrily at the flag on the edge of the building, standing tall and mocking him. It was a bright red, with the tainted symbol of the hammer and sickle painted in the top left corner.\n\nThe man spat with disgust. Walking forward, he aimed the knife high, and the camera panned to the side. As he neared the flag, his hand swung downwards, intending to rip straight through and tear it off. As it did, it stopped in the middle of his swing, and the image slowly faded into something else.\n\nIt was a hoe that struck into soil. The camera panned back, and it showed an older man working under the sun. A voice began speaking as the man continued working. "Your service does not have to end after being discharged from the Wehrmacht." He stated. "Indeed, they are especially valuable to the Reich. Men of brawn and brain, veterans who know their loyalty is true - they are what embodies the Reich! So, to those who have served loyally, there remains hope."\n\nIt cuts to another older man, who walked up to someone's house and knocked politely on the door, giving them mail before leaving. "New industries open, and so do new opportunities. If you are a veteran of the Heer, Luftwaffe, or Kriegsmarine, you are privileged employment in civilian sectors. We cannot forget the sacrifices you have made, and so in turn, you will be rewarded.""
