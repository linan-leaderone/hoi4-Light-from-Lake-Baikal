 IRK_Genrikh_Yagoda: "Genrikh Yagoda"
 POLITICS_GENRIKH_YAGODA_DESC: "Back in the days of the old Soviet Union, Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda was a name that many knew, and were terrified of. As the Director of the NKVD, Yagoda was responsible for cementing the stability and security of Bukharin's regime, whom he had supported even in the initial power struggle that had led to his rise to power. With little more than a simple order from him, even the most prominent Bolsheviks could suddenly disappear or be executed for counter-revolutionary behavior.\n\nThen, when war broke out, large parts of the Union, even Moscow itself, fell under the German jackboot. In the ensuing chaos, Yagoda used the power he had been trusted with to evacuate much of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to the east, as far away from the Reich as possible. In the end, he was able to establish control in the depths of Siberia. From there, he governed one of the most powerful successor states of the Union.\n\nThe state that the old Presidium built did not last, however. Again and again, enemies and traitors carved their own fiefdoms as Yagoda's empire slowly crumbled; from the hated reactionaries from Harbin, to the "democrats" of Central Siberia and its generals, to the treasonous revisionists just across Lake Baikal. Yet, despite all the blows the Irkutsk government has suffered, it still stands as yet another warlord state. What sets it apart, though, is its legitimacy - no other warlord can claim to be a direct continuation of the old government. Yagoda now controls a regime where the NKVD is responsible for protecting the final stronghold of the revolution, and only a handful of Bukharinist politicians can govern. That's all Yagoda has been left with, but it will suffice."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_BESSONOV_DESC: "A career Soviet politician, diplomat, and Communist Party official, as well as a staunch Bukharinist besides, Sergey Alexeyevich Bessonov followed along with the evacuation of government from Moscow during the German invasion. Remaining with the core of the Presidium, despite numerous defections and splinters, he settled with the others in Irkutsk, where his diplomatic experience earned him a position as Foreign Minister within General Secretary Yagoda's cabinet.\n\nHowever, Bessonov grew increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda's approach to governance, and in particular strongly opposed his concentration of power towards the State faction and away from the Communist Party - the natural font of authority in any true Bukharinist state. As the power struggle between the Party and Yagoda's clique deepened, Bessonov knew where his loyalties lay, and when the time was right to depose Yagoda and once again empower the Party, he stood ready to play his part.\n\nNamed Premier by the grateful Presidium after Yagoda's fall, Bessonov moved quickly to eject Yagoda supporters and loyalists from positions of authority, replacing them with reliable Party officials. He intends fully to return the Presidium and the Union back to their Bukharinist roots, and in so doing, decisively - and permanently - dismantle the so-called 'Yagodaschina.'"

 IRK_smuta_towards_the_restoration: "Towards the Restoration" 
 IRK_smuta_towards_the_restoration_desc: "The time of delay and preparation is over. Warlords, opportunists, and successors ready their armies, assert their claims, and march across the Far East. The Smuta has begun, and it is time that Irkutsk assert her presence - lest our enemies preempt us, and gain an advantage.\n\nFascists, mercenaries, Whites, and all manner of criminals infest this region; they infest the lands that rightfully belong to the Soviet Union. The task facing us is enormous - but there are no others who are capable of successfully rectifying the mistakes of the past, and restoring Russia to her rightful place.\n\nThe Soviet Union will be restored, and our return begins today." 

 IRK_smuta_terror_by_necessity: "Terror by Necessity"
 IRK_smuta_terror_by_necessity_desc: "There will be many who will resist our return, and we must subsequently prepare to deal with them without hesitation, remorse, and mercy. Occupiers, criminals, and traitors are spread throughout the Far East, and as we conquer them one by one, the people must be shown that their crimes will not be tolerated.\n\nThe Red Terror of the Russian Revolution was a violent, but necessary measure as the monarchists and Whites resisted the people. It demonstrated the willingness of the revolutionaries to not merely punish tyranny - but actively purge it. This reassurance is again needed, so the people rest easy knowing the greatest threats to Russia are being dealt with - and to break the spirits of our enemies.\n\nLet them know there will be no reprieve; no mercy for those who stand against the Soviet Union."

 IRK_smuta_expand_regional_nkvd_detachments: "Expand Regional NKVD Detachments"
 IRK_smuta_expand_regional_nkvd_detachments_desc: "The NKVD are among our most critical assets, and it is essential that they continue to be well-supplied and maintained - especially as we expand beyond our borders. Particularly in regions that have been recaptured, many NKVD detachments find themselves stretched thin and struggling to maintain control.\n\nThis is an unacceptable development, one which threatens our control over, and the stability of the region.\n\nWe will ensure that additional materials, weapons, vehicles, and soldiers are allocated to these forward regional detachments, or raise new ones if necessary, to allow them to complete their objectives, and accelerate the reclamation of the Far East for the Soviet Union."
 IRK_smuta_expand_regional_nkvd_detachments_tt: "§GImproves§! §YSecurity§! policy effectiveness and §Gdecreases§! §Rcivilian chaos§! proportionally to the §Ynumber of owned states§!, at a cost of §Y$2 Million§! per state.\nCurrent §Yowned states§!: [?IRK.num_owned_states]\n\nWe will spend §Y$$[?temp_econ_spending_amount_unmodified|3] B§!.

 IRK_smuta_assistance_for_local_soviets: "Assistance for Local Soviets"
 IRK_smuta_assistance_for_local_soviets_desc: "The Soviets are the cornerstone of our country, and as we expand further into the Far East, there are many which will need to be rejuvenated, reconstituted, and created to effectively administer these territories. Finding individuals will be a minor affair, compared to ensuring that they have the resources to properly carry out their tasks.\n\nMuch of the Far East has stagnated under disorganized, inefficient, and elitist governments and administrations - and subsequently, much work will need to be done to transition the region to one properly administered by workers' councils - as well as ensuring that said councils are staffed with those sufficiently loyal to the Soviet Union.\n\nWe cannot afford to risk deviation at this critical stage, after all."

 IRK_smuta_the_arteries_of_the_union: "The Arteries of the Union"
 IRK_smuta_the_arteries_of_the_union_desc: "Now any work in the semi-wild and low-developed territories of the Far East inevitably leads to acute logistical problems that impede the fulfillment of any projects - be they military, economic or social. Therefore, we will not limit ourselves just to creation of basic roads and railways, which our military engineers are already constructing. No, we will design a detailed project for the phased creation of a full-fledged developed infrastructure in those lands, with the construction of bridges, tunnels, telecommunication and power lines, repair and fuel stations, all while keeping in mind extreme temperature fluctuations, harsh weather and hostile environment. As firm military control is established over the liberated territories, our workers and engineers will immediately begin to carry out the subsequent stages of this plan, creating the foundation for the total development of the entire region."
 IRK_smuta_the_arteries_of_the_union_tt: "Constructs §Yrailroads§! and §Gincreases§! monthly £smuta_supplies §sMilitary Supplies Gain§! proportionally to the §Ynumber of owned states§!, at a cost of §Y$4 Million§! per state.\nCurrent §Yowned states§!: [?IRK.num_owned_states]\n\n"

 IRK_smuta_under_benevolent_eyes: "Under Benevolent Eyes"
 IRK_smuta_under_benevolent_eyes_desc: "Our forces advance, and the Far East is assured to fall before us, though with victories come new concerns.\n\nThe Soviet people must be saved from the fascists and criminals that oppress them, but even once our forces smash their own into splinters, that will unfortunately not mean the end. Fascism, National Socialism, capitalism, all of these are like weeds, which grow and hide even in hostile environments.\n\nThis is where the NKVD will step in; it is they who will keep a watchful eye on the people for those who would seek to exploit or corrupt them. Even now there will be traitors and dissidents in our midst who seek to harm our people - and it will be the NKVD who find, root out, and purge them from our state."

 IRK_smuta_facilitate_sovnarkom_reorganisation: "Facilitate SovNarKom Re-Organization"
 IRK_smuta_facilitate_sovnarkom_reorganisation_desc: "The Council of People's Commissars, henceforth abbreviated to the SovNarKom, has fallen into stagnation, the extent of which was revealed in the wake of the Sablin Incident. It is simply not organized, prepared, or capable of waging a sustained conflict in its current state.\n\nRecognizing this, it is critical that the relevant powers concerning warfighting must be delegated to those actively managing the effort - particularly Yagoda, and his trusted advisors. We are entering a critical period, and we can afford no hesitation or bureaucratic malaise. Decisiveness is critical as the Smuta continues, and Yagoda must have every tool at his disposal available, should the situation demand it.\n\nWe have come too far to do anything less."

 IRK_smuta_expand_gosplan_functions: "Expand Gosplan Functions"
 IRK_smuta_expand_gosplan_functions_desc: "Not a single governmental body would be able to develop a program for the restoration and development of the entire country better than the Gosplan - and now, as we restore our control over the territory of the USSR, there is large-scale work to do. We will significantly reform, improve and expand the Gosplan; we will create co-joined commissions for each region to assess their economic state and develop a plan for integrating their economies. We will provide all the means to control and supervise the development of those regions, as well as distribute the resources necessary to achieve this - including full information support from the NKVD."

 IRK_smuta_assess_nomenklatura: "Assess the Nomenklatura"
 IRK_smuta_assess_nomenklatura_desc: "As a result of the purges carried out in nomenklatura, we removed the corrupt, incompetent, and openly traitorous personnel - but at the same time face a clear shortage of experienced and skilled officials, especially before as the planned expansion of territories under our control begins. Therefore, we will begin the active training of new, professional officials. The most talented of these newcomers will be appointed to the governing positions in the Far East, along with the competent and experienced personnel we already have. This way, the new staff will quickly gain significant practical experience, while experienced workers will ensure the work of our nomenklatura in new territories is professional - and competent."

 IRK_smuta_stabilise_economic_authorities: "Stabilize the Economic Authorities"
 IRK_smuta_stabilise_economic_authorities_desc: "The Buryatia Incident, and subsequent purge have already led to confusion in our economic administrations, and the imminent return of Soviet territories to the control of the legitimate government makes the issue of restoring the efficiency of economic authorities especially pressing. We will develop clear, unified and comprehensive instructions and regulations for our economic administrations, which will quickly stabilize their work and allow them to easily recruit new employees. Representatives of economic authorities from the returned territories will be subjected to an assessment by the NKVD, and those proven suitable will be retrained and integrated into our economic system, as their knowledge of the realities of the regions will be extremely useful as we solidify our control."

 IRK_smuta_resources_for_kombinats: "Resources for the Kombinats"
 IRK_smuta_resources_for_kombinats_desc: "For more than thirty years, from the moment of their creation back in the Bukharin's USSR, Kombinats - the state enterprises that controlled entire industrial sectors - ensured the functioning of the country's economy. They made mistakes and corrected them; they studied and improved; they fulfilled the demands of the Gosplan, and proved their extreme efficiency in developing the country. Now it is on them we rely, as the integration of the returned territories commences. We will entrust Kombinats with the development of plans concerning the restoration of the economy of the USSR, taking into account the returned territories.For implementation of those plans, we are ready to provide significantly expanded budgets, the provisioning of material, energy and human resources, as well as all required information from the NKVD."

 IRK_smuta_resupport_the_ruble: "Resupport the Ruble"
 IRK_smuta_resupport_the_ruble_desc: "During the chaos that hit the USSR in recent years, the value and even meaning of the Soviet Ruble were lost. Numerous rebels, bandits and occupants, who seized control over Soviet territory, created their own new pseudo-currencies, speculating and tearing up the economy of the destabilized USSR even more. It's time to put an end to this and restore the financial system of the Soviet Union.\n\nFirstly, all banking and financial institutes in the liberated territories will be integrated back into the structure of the Gosbank of the USSR and brought into line with its standards. Secondly, instead of numerous false currencies, a single Soviet Ruble will be re-issued, as the only legal currency on the territory of the USSR, and Gosbank will organize a quick and massive exchange of people's savings into the new currency. Finally, for the survival and development of the Soviet economy, it will be necessary to restore trade contacts with foreign countries, which means that the Soviet Ruble must be backed with internationally accepted resources: gold and silver. Fortunately, rich gold mines of Aldan, together with gold reserves already accumulated by occupants, will allow us to obtain the necessary volumes of precious metal to issue all needed amounts of paper currency."

 IRK_smuta_the_renewed_apparatus: "The Renewed Apparatus"
 IRK_smuta_the_renewed_apparatus_desc: "Thanks to the continuing work and effort of our people, our administrative apparatus has become significantly more efficient, properly staffed, and sufficiently funded. Because of this development, we are better able to properly provide for our citizens, and give our soldiers what they need to operate on the front.\n\nWhile our state may have once threatened to collapse, Sablin's revolt nonetheless proved to be the catalyst that was necessary to force these changes. No more are we stagnant, no more are we paralyzed. Province by province, state by state, communism returns to the Far East.\n\nThe Soviet Union endures, and all Russia will soon be united under the hammer and sickle once more."

 IRK_smuta_back_in_the_ussr: "Back in the USSR"
 IRK_smuta_back_in_the_ussr_desc: "Victory! The first phases of the Final Conflict have proceeded beyond all expectations. Yagoda and his presidium have weathered many a storm: Sablin's mutiny, the tsarist menace and the fascist abomination. We have emerged triumphant, the forces of Reaction and pseudo-capitalism lie broken under the socialist heel. The Far East belongs to the United Soviet Socialist Republics, just as it did all those years ago.\n\nUnder Yagoda's guidance, we have finally begun to wake up from the nightmare imposed on us by the German monstrosity. Only flickering phantasmagoria remain: fascist holdouts, tsarist enclaves, and Sablinites in need of reeducation. They are a trivial concern, easily dismissed with the blink of the eyes and a firm pull of the trigger. The USSR has returned, let the enemies of the Proletariat tremble!"

 IRK_mutiny_the_response_desc: "Comrades! Brothers and sisters! Workers and peasants of the Irkutsk Oblast! On behalf of the Soviet Presidium, we ask you to remain vigilant as the very existence of our Soviet Motherland is at stake. Taking advantage of our weakness against the forces of Rodzaevsky and Pasternak, deserters and traitors under the leadership of Valery Sablin are attempting to organize a revisionist insurgency, raising a dark and brutal mob to his ignoble cause and forcibly mobilizing them to commit unspeakable crimes against the working people.\n\nIn the time of the existential challenge to our beloved Union, we ask you to not succumb to provocations of the Sablinite counterrevolutionaries and direct all your efforts to fight the internal enemy. We warn you that the Soviet power will remain unshakable in its merciless attitude against treason. Any person engaged in the anti-Soviet activities or involved in encouraging or harboring the insurgents will be held accountable and be subjected to the most severe punishment."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_trenches_desc: "The soldiers of the Union have endured the unimaginable, and we must now ask them to endure more. They are our shield against the traitors and partisans who seek to finish what the Germans started all those years ago. If the Union is to survive, we have to do everything we can to support the men fighting on the front line for our cause.\n\nBy ensuring deliveries of food, equipment, and weapons reliably make it on time to the soldiers who need them we can make the hellish conditions of Siberian warfare slightly more bearable. We can cycle between frontline and reserve duty, allowing them to recover and fight more effectively when it is time to return to the battlefield. We cannot let our morale falter in the face of yet another threat."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_ministry_of_defense_desc: "The partisans' rebellion must be quickly crushed without mercy or hesitation. To this effect, Yagoda has ordered the Ministry of Defense to immediately shift the nation to a war footing until the eastern rebellion has been fully stamped out. Certain areas of the economy will shift production to military materials, while others will continue to operate, but in a modified fashion. Military rations will be temporarily prioritized over the civilian food supply, while several factories currently producing civilian goods will begin being converted to weapon foundries.\n\nAnother step the Ministry of Defense has been ordered to take is the issuing of the "museum pieces". These antiquated weapons date back to before the Second World War and have until now been kept in storage. The Ministry will issue these weapons to our reserve units focused on hunting partisans operating in our own territory."
 IRK_mutiny_volunteers_for_the_union_desc: "Volunteers for the Union"
 IRK_mutiny_nkvd_guards_detachments_desc: "In the Union's darkest hour, it was the NKVD that rescued the Presidium and evacuated it to Irkutsk. Now, when we are forced to fight for our survival once more, the NKVD shall deliver us victory again. Some of the most experienced soldiers in our nation are members of the NKVD guards. Currently, these men are scattered in small groups across the country, serving as bodyguards, intelligence officers, and secret police, but they could be of greater use if we organized them into a full military division.\n\nThis new NKVD motor rifle division will be the tip of the spear that we will skewer the traitors with. The ragtag bandits won't stand a chance against the discipline and ruthlessness of the finest soldiers of the Soviet Union. Once we have defeated the partisans this new division will be instrumental to our reclamation of Siberia, and eventually all of Russia."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_construction_desc: "Irkutsk is the main economic and industrial hub of eastern Siberia, but we have been hurt by the rebellion. Large portions of our military industry and infrastructure have fallen under the control of Sablin's bandits at a moment when we need them most. To make up for this, the Directorate of Construction will have to make some accommodations for our military.\n\nFactory space that would have otherwise gone to other projects has been cleared for military production. Infrastructure projects that will benefit the military have been accelerated while civilian constructions have been postponed indefinitely. Until we have recovered our stolen industry, we must get everything we have out of what remains. We have to keep our army supplied and on the move, no matter the cost."
 IRK_mutiny_field_fortification_planning_desc: "Field Fortification Planning"
 IRK_mutiny_supplemental_labor_battalions_desc: "We need all hands on deck to defeat the Sablinites, even those who might have failed us before. The gulags of our nation are filled with physically capable prisoners eager to prove their redemption and earn their freedom, or at the very least a reduced sentence. We will create a program of labor battalions formed from volunteers from the gulags, who will supplement our military engineers and aid field constructions for the duration of the rebellion.\n\nOf course, we must be careful with these volunteers. Many of them have attempted to betray us before, and exposure to any rebel propaganda could easily incite them to do so again. To incentivize loyalty, any volunteers who complete their work without incident will be rewarded with a modest reduction of their sentence. The last thing we want is a mass prisoner revolt behind our lines."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_capital_desc: "Sablin's rebellion has exposed the key weaknesses within our central government. It is a travesty that the traitors managed to advance their cause to this point without the institutions of the state managing to stamp them out. Immediate steps must be taken to make sure that the holes in the government that led to the present situation are plugged.\n\nOnce the partisans have been crushed the government must be ready to quickly reintegrate the territory they stole from us and crack down on any remaining dissent that may emerge. We must also begin a review of our government to see how this rebellion escaped our notice. This will not be allowed to happen again, not if the Union is to have any hope of surviving."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_presidium_desc: "The necessary reforms to our apparatus of the state will be handled by the Presidium of the Soviet Union. In these troubled times the Presidium can serve as a beacon of stability to guide us through the storm. While the military and the NKVD handle the matter of crushing the rebellion, the politicians of the Presidium will work to make sure that normalcy is maintained as much as is possible in a time of war.\n\nInvestigations into the Presidium itself must also take place, both internal and external. If any traitors remain hidden within our government we must sniff them out. More important than that though, is the lack of oversight within the Presidium that allowed the rebellion's leaders to continue their plot. In the new Presidium such things will not be possible."
 IRK_mutiny_an_ironclad_union_desc: "This is no time for dissenting voices or questioning authority. The Union is facing a crisis that threatens to destroy it, a crisis which was born out of disunity. Some within our government see the rebellion as a chance to advance their own agendas or push for their pet reforms while our attention is elsewhere. If this backroom maneuvering is allowed to go on unchecked it could spell our demise.\n\nYagoda has ordered that all factionalism within the Presidium and the government as a whole must end immediately. For the duration of the crisis only authorized motions pertaining to it may be discussed and implemented. Anyone who attempts to subvert this order will find just how serious we are. There may eventually be a day when we can afford the luxury of allowing constructive criticism from within our ranks. That day is not today."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_shadows_desc: "The greatest weapon left in our arsenal is our intelligence apparatus. When Russia fractured it was the agents of the NKVD who kept the Union alive and carved out a new home for the revolution in Irkutsk. The operatives and spies of the NKVD are some of the most experienced in the world. The time has come to use them against Sablin and his gang of traitors, and tear apart the upstart rebellion from within.\n\nThe fragile new government across Lake Baikal is a perfect target for infiltration and sabotage. It is run by inexperienced amateurs trying to figure out how to run a nation as they go. Our agents will have no trouble infiltrating it by posing as traitors or double agents, and in many cases, they won't even need to hide their identities. Before long the partisans will be in disarray, with all their plans and secrets laid bare before us."
 IRK_mutiny_in_the_directorate_of_state_security_desc: "When one is waging a war of subterfuge and espionage, defense is even more critical than offense. As we uncover the secrets of the rebellion, we must take precautions to make sure they do not uncover ours as well. The NKVD's internal service apparatus, the Directorate of State Security is responsible for this vital mission. Partisan operations are notoriously hard to stamp out, but if there is anyone who can do it, it is them.\n\nMembers of the government who display anything less than total loyalty will be placed under surveillance, as will anyone who was associated with known traitors before they began their revolt. Agents will be posted in every town and city, keeping their ears to the ground for any sign of trouble. Patrols will sweep the countryside to intercept infiltrators. Irkutsk shall become an intelligence black hole."
 IRK_mutiny_mobile_interrogation_centers_desc: "Sometimes time is of the essence and prisoners with valuable information cannot be transported back to secure locations quickly enough. Extracting information is already a time-consuming process without the added delay of bringing a captured asset to an interrogation room and then having to take the information they divulge back to the front lines. The solution to this problem is simple: bring the interrogation room to the front lines.\n\nBy refitting a number of trucks to carry intelligence officers who specialize in information extraction and "wetwork", as well as the tools they use to carry out their jobs, we can greatly increase the speed and efficiency of our interrogations of sablinite prisoners. As an added bonus, the trucks may acquire such a reputation that the unpleasant methods of our interrogators may be rendered unnecessary. The fear of the trucks alone will break even the most hardened partisan."

It is essential that friendly morale be kept high and enemy morale be kept low. The current rebellion is no exception and the Ministry of Propaganda has been hard at work making sure everyone knows that our victory is inevitable. They have recently completed the preparations for a two-pronged propaganda offensive for soldiers on both sides of the front line.\n\nWe will inspire our own loyal soldiers with tales of bravery performed by their comrades, and by reminding them of the long legacy of resistance and heroism they are continuing. We will bombard the traitorous bandits with propaganda proving the superiority of our troops and exposing the misguided fools they have followed into battle against their own countrymen."
 IRK_mutiny_remember_the_revolution_desc: "Sablin has attempted to claim the mantle of Lenin's revolution, painting himself as a true Leninist and his band of scum as spiritual successors to the October Revolution. While this is obviously nonsense, many of our citizens have fallen under the sway of these lies. We must prove that we carry the torch of the workers' revolution, while the partisans are nothing more than deceitful reactionaries.\n\nThe Ministry of Propaganda will launch a campaign based on Sablin's messages - remembering the October Revolution, staying true to Lenin's goals, and so forth, but we will do it better. Sablin is stuck with a group of ideologues and intellectuals quoting theory at each other, while we have teams of professional propagandists working with a proper budget to spread our messages far and wide."

 IRK_mutiny_the_union_forever_desc: "Victory is at hand. After months of fighting we have finally driven back the traitors and are preparing to deliver the killing blow. These cowards sought to destroy the Union when it was at its weakest, but they failed to learn the lessons of history. If the Germans with the mightiest army to ever march across Europe could not destroy us, no one can. They knew their only chance was to strike while our back was turned and even then they failed.\n\nOnce our victory has been secured it will be time to begin rebuilding our fractured territory. This hopeless rebellion never had a chance of toppling the Soviet Union, but it will change it. Certainly we cannot revert to the old status quo that allowed this to happen in the first place. We will never be able to reclaim Russia if we are constantly occupied fighting rebellions and partisans. No matter what happens, we will go forward knowing our victory is assured. The Union shall not, must not fall."

 IRK_postwar_the_union_victorious_desc: "The people of the Soviet Union have done it, comrades! The rebellious Sablinites have been utterly smashed and we have emerged victorious from the battle in full glory! We have proven our strength once more and showing our neighbors that we will not go down without a fight.\n\nHowever, just because the battle has been finished, does not mean that this is time for celebration! It is time for us to regroup and bring justice to the Sablinites!\n\nIt is time for the Soviet Union to cut the final piece of thread that our opposition dangles off of, and to show the Sablinites that we, the people of the Union, still remain vigilant and powerful, even in our most dire state!"
 IRK_postwar_the_great_purge_desc: "The Soviet Union cannot allow a counterrevolutionary revolt on this scale to ever occur again. If Russia is to ever rise from the ashes and show the Union as a stable entity, then our regional administrations must not allow these rebels to ever rise up against our government. We need to strike the source of the problem: The Incompetent and Corrupt.\n\nA §VGreat Purge§! is sorely needed to ensure our government stays indivisible. Those officials that are incompetent to lead and administrate must be gathered up. What awaits them will either be a firing squad, a lifetime in prison, or expulsion from the party depending on the heinousness of their crimes.\n\nFor the especially corrupt however, an appointment at the back of the shed and a bullet in the head will be the most befitting course of action. One cannot have a stable Union if its people are being represented so incompetently..."
 IRK_postwar_assemble_the_commission_desc: "It is crucial that we enact a purge to effectively remove the filth lurking with our framework. In order to do so, however, we will establish a commission that is able to collect information from the suspected officials then disposing of them through any means necessary. The members of the commission, however, cannot be composed of regular NKVD officials in fear of them compromising our efforts, so we'll have to scout and recruit talented individuals from within the NKVD's ranks that possess necessary skills in order for our plans to come into fruition.\n\nAfter all, it'd be impossible to commit to our internal purges without a proper commission to handle the dirty work in service of the people of the Soviet Union."
 IRK_postwar_recall_suspect_personnel_desc: "We have a lot of suspects noted by the NKVD for potential punishment, whether their track record are a lot more minor cases of simply sheer incompetence, or more extreme cases of corruption, we will need to remove them from their positions for the necessary steps of the Purge.\n\nHowever, while the people we are purging might have been incompetent at their job or might have had traces of corruption, we cannot just remove them from their positions and leave an empty void. Those positions will need to be filled.\n\nWe will instate some... "temporary" personnel to fill their shoes in their jobs, we cannot leave such a power gap or else we could be destabilizing the Union further."
 IRK_postwar_the_investigations_desc: "While nobody can remain out of the NKVD's grasp for long, it has become clear that some of the suspects we are closing in on are simply entrenched too deep into the political machine to be removed easily. Now that the commission has been assembled, we shall begin a wide series of investigations to gather evidence on those corrupt officials who foolishly assume they are untouchable. With luck, we will find something concrete and can continue to make arrests.\n\nOnce we have enough material on to start the crackdowns in earnest, however, the question remains as to how to properly deal with the arrested officials. With the evidence in hand, the commission will move to determine the severity of the suspect's crimes, and therefore the severity of their punishment.\n\nWhile most of these parasites will no doubt be found to be enemies of the state and will be purged for their idiotic crimes against the people, there may be some who are not too far gone and can be encouraged to realize the error of their ways. Once the evidence has been gathered and reviewed, the final decision on whether or not to show clemency with minor offenders will ultimately rest on Comrade Yagoda and the NKVD."
 IRK_postwar_zero_tolerance_desc: "We cannot condone any corrupt and incompetent incumbents to continue holding their governing positions. From the lowest bureaucrat to the highest minister, any person caught and prosecuted within our Purge won't be reinstated in any position under no circumstances.\n\nWhile no quarter shall be spared for any mice caught in our mousetraps, those that were spared won't ever be allowed to re-enter the political scene in our Union ever again. The damage done while they held power was already terrible, if we let them return, the amount of damage they could do to our administration would be immeasurable.\n\nThe Soviet Union cannot risk degenerate officials like them crawling their way back onto our administration lest they corrode the system once more."
 IRK_postwar_opportunities_for_forgiveness_desc: "There are a certain group of people within our reach that we could potentially use to our advantage in order to further re-establish our glorious republic. Their role in the prior administration was highly effective, but all that effectiveness ended up coming at a price - corruption.\n\nHowever, there is now an opportunity for us to rein in those administratively able ministers and incorporate them into our own government.\n\nIf we are to utilise these people to our advantage, we could promise them redemption. They could regain their original positions and we can cover their tracks, however, only under the stern condition that they do not repeat their... erroneous actions once more."
 IRK_postwar_the_irkutsk_trials_desc: "The time has come. Our investigations have been completed, our judicial approach has been decided upon, and we must now act to complete our purge of the state's enemies.\n\nWe will bring those identified as guilty, through whatever means, to trial. We will show the people, directly, that these counterrevolutionary elements, corrupt officials, traitors, parasites, and others, cannot escape judgement.\n\nAnd once they are finally gone, the state will at last be secure. We will make sure of it."
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_the_mutiny_desc: "While their ideology of the Buryat Mutiny, the disgraceful Sablinite rebellion against the Soviet Union, was in the wrong place, and they were promptly crushed by the real Revolution they sought to revolt against, perhaps we should take some notes of their tactical ability against us.\n\nThe ability for the rebels to arm so many supporters is a curious one, and one we should be opening commissions into. We need to analyse how they were able to achieve what they had managed to, and see how we can adopt that to the Soviet Union's army!\n\nWhile the Sablinites might not have been good at using their tactics effectively, the Soviet Union will happily rebrand it as ours and use it more efficiently!"
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_their_spirit_desc: "What was the driving force behind their rebellion, comrades? It was their hopes and desire of toppling the administration of the Union and superseding it with their own government that had inspired them to revolt.\n\nWe must take some notes from what gave the rebellious Sablinites the hope to take over, and note what we could gain from learning how they had formed their desire to replace the Soviet Union with their flawed system.\n\nIf we can ignite that same light of patriotism, not for Sablin, but rather for the people of Russia within the Union, then we have much to gain from this, comrades."
 IRK_postwar_lessons_from_sablin_desc: "While what Sablin did was an absolutely disgraceful betrayal of what the Soviet Union has stood for, it would be in our key interest to investigate his policies and possibly gain some benefit if applied.\n\nIt would be deemed necessary to implement some minor reforms that originated from Sablin's system in order to increase our popularity among his former supporters and make some usage out of the ideas he had fostered."
 IRK_postwar_rebuilding_our_legitimacy_desc: "The great and powerful Soviet Union has been shattered and we have all but disintegrated on the world stage - this is a catastrophe for every person within the Union.\n\nWe have been torn apart from the inside ever since the German invasion of our Union, falling apart piece by piece, until we have been diminished to our current state. But we won't give up so easily with such a set back. In order to accomplish our goals, our government's legitimacy must be restored, back to when we were truly recognized as the leaders of Russia!\n\nNo matter the means that we are to take our approach for the reclamation of the Union, we must regain our spot among the great powers once more and return the people of Russia to their rightful place on the world stage!"
 IRK_postwar_a_union_of_letters_desc: "Since the fall of our Union decades ago, opportunists, counter-revolutionaries, and fools alike have fought an unceasing war to destroy our legitimacy. The Sablinite rebellion was the last in a long line of betrayals and traitorous acts, each designed to lead the masses astray towards their own inevitable destruction.\n\nAfter so many brushes with annihilation, many in the Presidium believe it is high time to turn inward. While we have always acted with their best interests at heart, It is clear that much of our population has lost faith in their government's ability to uphold the ideals of the revolution and provide for them.\n\nIn light of this, and in an attempt to expedite reintegration of the Buryat ASSR, we will begin a new campaign, one of "1000 letters".\n\nNamed after the 17th century "republic of letters", we will attempt to foster a similar culture of innovation. Open criticism in all levels of government will be encouraged, so long as it is constructive. Workers and bureaucrats alike will be asked to mail in their thoughts and concerns regarding our reunification struggle.\n\nHopefully such actions will lead to an efficient administration, attraction of distant intellectuals, and a renewed sense of connection between the masses and their vanguard party."
 IRK_postwar_necessary_reforms_desc: "The 1000 Letters campaign has proven to be exceptionally fruitful! Peasants and bureaucrats alike have risen to the occasion, making use of this unique opportunity for critical expression directed to the Presidium itself. We have received well over 1000 letters, each detailing workplace grievances and various administrative inefficiencies.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most encouraging result of our effort has been the expansion of legitimacy among the formerly rebellious Buryat ASSR. While it is true that the eastern shores of Lake Baikal were relatively timid in composing letters, those that we have collected have proven highly valuable. In addition, the lack of a crackdown upon those that spoke freely seems to have eased tensions. Acts of sabotage are steadily declining, and it appears we just might be able to deprogram those taken hostage by opportunism yet.\n\nNow comes the time of transformation. From words we have devised actions; Increases in low level pay, a tempered five year grain quota, and the closing of managerial loopholes. These programs, as well as other collected reforms, will soon be implemented to compound upon the trust we have built. Let us make haste."
 IRK_postwar_an_internal_affair_desc: "One of the core tenets of Leninism is the vanguard party. The party exists to protect the people from the capitalists, and help instill class consciousness. In order to achieve this goal, only the most educated and politically advanced people can run the higher functions of the state, not the average worker. To directly involve the people could risk needless inefficiency at a critical time, especially as we reorganize the Union. We must rely only on ourselves to reform the state, and not the people, as to maintain our Leninist ideals and prevent needless corruption, along with false consciousness, from ending the Union!"
 IRK_postwar_bolster_nkvd_presence_desc: "While we have managed to prevent ourselves from being conquered, the fact of the matter is that lawlessness is all too common here, especially in the outskirts of our territory, away from our centers of control. In order to rectify the situation, a decision has been made to increase NKVD patrols, and increase their presence in the outskirts. An open showing of security will force the criminals to retreat underground, and allow us to reassert our authority. Furthermore, we shall step up the duties of the NKVD from a law enforcement perspective, allowing them to assert their authority and beat back the lawlessness that has plagued our outer lands for too long!"
 IRK_postwar_a_peoples_union_desc: "For too long, the people of the USSR have seen the government as a distant and uncaring monolith. Such discontent with the system only breeds long-term issues, and it is a problem that we must solve. We must stress the idea that the Presidium and Yagoda care for the people, and the concept that it is the wellbeing of the people that comes first here in the Soviet Union. Speeches shall be conducted and propaganda to this end will be spread across our lands, but we must ensure that these are not empty words by actually supporting the people. It may be costly, but it will help us gain a sense of legitimacy, something that we need now more than ever."
 IRK_postwar_renew_central_authority_desc: "Even after the mutiny ended, there was still a large amount of discontent in the Buryat territories. Furthermore, the mutiny required us to basically rebuild the bureaucracy, as we could not truly ensure the loyalty of many of the Buryatian bureaucrats. However, as we've increased patrols and begun the process of reintegrating, the discontent from Buryatia slowly died down, eventually dissipating entirely. Finally, our efforts have paid off, as the Buryatian lands have been fully reintegrated!"
 IRK_postwar_a_secure_union_desc: "The existence of the warlords throughout Russia has damaged many things, but perhaps the greatest thing lost is security. The people do not trust in our state's ability to ensure their safety anymore, which is truly disheartening. We need to show the people, through propaganda, speeches, and initiatives, that the USSR merely seeks to build socialism from within, nurturing it in order to protect the people. Furthermore, we must ensure the people understand that the Presidium, and Yagoda, do not exist just to be a distant ruler, but to ensure your safety and security in a time when that is all too rare. By increasing the rate of patrols throughout the cities, and having an increased presence of security in the countryside, we can hopefully express that yes, we will keep the people safe!"
 IRK_postwar_a_strengthened_mandate_desc: "It seems that all our efforts have paid off! The strengthening of security, combined with the propaganda showcasing the fact that the Presidium cares for the people, has allowed us to acquire a new mandate! The people trust us more and more, and believe that we are the best path forward for Russia. Even in Buryatia, the people now trust us over Sablin. This new sense of legitimacy means that we can embark on further efforts without having to worry about discontent from the people. The USSR may have been brought low, but we will restore its glory!"
 IRK_postwar_continuing_course_desc: "The safety of our Union was threatened by the revolt of the Sablinites. However, with their fall comes a new opportunity to strike out into our former territory. The time has come to once again set our eyes upon the Motherland, and soon we will bring the light of socialist revolutionary power to the proletariat. Once the east is secured with our righteous fervor and might, we shall move deeper and deeper into our lost heartland, and drive the traitors who abandoned the Union back, either into retreat or into the ground. With the spirited guidance of the legitimate leader of the Union, Comrade Yagoda, our failure in the brutal conflicts to come is a near impossibility. The rise of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will once again let us stand alone as a shining beacon in the darkness of this world."

Instrumental in holding back the spread of these movements and their ideals throughout Irkutsk has been the NKVD, ever watchful over the safety of our citizens and the revolutionary movement in their steadfast vigilance.\n\nHowever, as we spread our movement and reclaim what once was, some have begun to suggest dangerous ideals, such as that we lift these restrictions on culture and allow our people to freely express themselves. This is simply preposterous! We see again and again the results of an unguarded populace - the creation of reactionary regimes that have enslaved Mother Russia!

Now, with the USSR united politically and his preeminent rivals in ditches or the gulag, it is time for the dominant Yagoda to enact his philosophy, the Yagodaschina.\n\nTo epitomize Yagoda's beliefs in one word would be order.

This was more than proven when thousands deserted the Union for that traitor Sablin. We must rip out this tumor from the ranks of the single most important organ of our administration and ensure it is unable to grow any stronger, preventing it from endangering the safety of our nation once again.\n\nTo be attacked are the issues of corruption and bureaucratic excess that have held back the NKVD from reaching the heights that we desire. A secret subcommittee is to be created to explore corruption, locating those who skim money off the top and target their political rivals. Lists of these individuals are to be sent to Yagoda for approval of their removal as part of the most recent purge.

This has the two-fold effect of increasing loyalty as well as strengthening the security apparatus and expanding its reach.\n\nWhile rewards are given, it is important to ensure that previous issues with corruption are dodged, and so the subcommittee investigating corruption is to be maintained to ensure the integrity of the NKVD, and in turn, the security of the true successor to the Union."

Increased oversight as well as increased accountability has therefore been approved by the General Secretary's stamp and now all matters of state bureaucracy have been made openly available to the NKVD.\n\nThis will serve to increase our control over state affairs and create a more streamlined state approach. Corruption, excess, and waiting times will also all be cut down on as the aforementioned accountability forces public servants to not cut corners and work according to strict state deadlines. A culture of work, love of work, and fulfillment for state work will be fostered, and will be the backbone of a new nation."

 IRK_regional_rewards_for_public_servants_desc: "As we increase our expectations for our public servants, Yagoda has deemed it necessary to increase salaries for them. In addition, those that show exemplary work in their respective fields are entitled to extra compensation in the form of non-monetary rewards, such as vacation time, watches, and even nicer apartments.\n\nThe cornerstone of this is to be the Antonovite Movement, so named after exemplary public worker Klavdiy Antonovich. He consistently shows an ability to organize the inner workings of the Union. His dedicated work is an example to all those who have the honor of offering their time in the support of the new Russian civil administration, and so he has been elevated to the head of the movement. His precedent shows all the public servants of the USSR that to be an Antonovite is to do great work in the name of the State and Reunification."

A united USSR, now more powerful and with more potential than ever, collectively has taken its first step in what posters, bulletins, and speeches have deemed the most important battle in Russian history; its reunification against the menace of the Reich. In a Russia shattered by infighting, external pressures, and crippled by war, there is no place that needs the strict order-based rule of a man like our General Secretary more.\n\nYagoda will lead us into a strong future, where one day the people of Russia will no longer need to fear German bombers, fascist puppets, or cowardly bandits. In the name of the Motherland our people march united, united in an unstoppable march of progress towards those bright horizons, where the light at the end of the tunnel lies. So enough of this, hold your head high and sing out to the world that Russia is not yet dead! For the Motherland, for Order!"
 
 IRK_regional_the_silent_revolution: "The Silent Revolution"
 IRK_regional_the_silent_revolution_desc: "The shift began during Sablin's rebellion, and at first it was barely noticeable. One week a few token responsibilities would be transferred from the Premier to the Presidium, the next the army would gain a small measure of autonomy from the NKVD. Soon it was undeniable though. Yagoda's clique was losing control of the Union, and the more ideological members of the Presidium were stepping in to take charge. A silent, bloodless revolution was under way that would return the Soviet Union to Lenin's founding vision.\n\nWith their power now secure, the Presidium has drafted a bold set of new reforms to be implemented. From expanding voting rights to issuing universal identification, the party hopes to turn away from the cloistered dictatorship that Yagoda and the NKVD fostered. Under Lenin, the Union was strong and prosperous. Returning to his plan for Russia is the only way to reclaim all that has been lost."
 
 IRK_regional_a_return_to_leninism: "A Return to Leninism"
 IRK_regional_a_return_to_leninism_desc: "When Bukharin took the reins after Comrade Lenin's death, no one could have guessed the consequences. The need for a strong state to guard the revolution was used as an excuse to establish a dictatorship more interested in maintaining power than advancing the revolution. Bukharin let the Union grow weak and failed to defend it when the Germans invaded. After Yagoda seized power the problems only worsened. He reduced the Union to nothing more than an NKVD client state that paid lip service to the revolution and nothing else.\n\nIt is far past time we returned to the original course Lenin set for us. There must be a true dictatorship of the proletariat, not simply a bourgeois dictatorship dressed in red. The liberation of the working class must always be at the forefront of our minds. This commitment to the revolution may not be popular with some of the old guard, but since when have revolutionaries cared what the bureaucrats think?"
 
 IRK_regional_sideline_the_state: "Sideline the State Faction"
 IRK_regional_sideline_the_state_desc: "The state faction, consisting of the NKVD, Yagoda's old guard, and the more conservative members of the Presidium, once ruled Irkutsk with an iron fist. Their pragmatism was essential to the Union's survival in the dark days that followed the collapse of the war against fascism, but now their time has passed.\n\nWith the Party consolidating its hold on the government, working across the aisle with those in the State faction is no longer necessary. We can begin relegating them to unimportant duties where they will be unable to obstruct our work. Many of our most talented bureaucrats and government workers are members of the State faction. The loss of their skills and experience will be something of a setback, but we cannot afford to have counterrevolutionaries sabotaging our government from within. Once we issue all of the reassignments the Party's control of the nation will be total, and the way forward to the Union's reclamation will finally be clear of internal obstructions."
 
 IRK_regional_replace_the_nomenklatura: "Replace the Nomenklatura"
 IRK_regional_replace_the_nomenklatura_desc: "The Nomenklatura are an informal upper class of our society made up of high-level bureaucrats and administrators. They hold significant influence in the government, the party media, and in almost every industry in the state. While all of them are registered members of the Communist Party and claim to be dedicated revolutionaries, in practice they represent a new elite that rules over the workers while trying to run the nation for their own benefit. It is no surprise that the Nomenklatura are almost universally supporters of the State faction that would preserve the status quo they thrive in.\n\nIf we want to call ourselves a real revolutionary government, we have to put an end to this new bourgeoisie. There is no doubt that they will use their ample resources and influence to oppose us, or that purging so many experienced bureaucrats will hurt our administration, but these are the sacrifices a Leninist state must be willing to make to achieve a true communist society."
 
 IRK_regional_erode_the_security_edifice: "Erode the Security Edifice"
 IRK_regional_erode_the_security_edifice_desc: "Under Yagoda's rule the Soviet government became little more than a glorified rubber stamp, existing only to legitimize the real masters of the Union, the NKVD. Over the years the nation was transformed into a securocracy, a government run by and for the intelligence services. Even as the NKVD-friendly state faction declines into irrelevance, many of the administrative structures and loopholes they put in place for Yagoda's henchmen remain.\n\nIf we eliminated these loopholes, it would go a long way towards relegating the NKVD back to its original purpose: protecting the revolutionary state, not controlling it. Reducing the NKVD's role in the government would also ease the administrative burden we are currently grappling with. Fewer people being consulted and improved delegation of responsibilities will make it easier for the Presidium and its agencies to take decisive action."

 IRK_regional_reassess_the_political_imprisonments_desc: "There is no question that the gulags are an unfortunate necessity. Since Lenin's original revolution there have always been people who refuse to accept our rule and attempt to disrupt our society, and there must be somewhere to send these people. During the reign of the NKVD the number of people sent to the gulags greatly increased, and many of those imprisonments were not justified. Men and women who were proud revolutionaries and dedicated members of the Communist Party were imprisoned simply for questioning Yagoda and his allies. We must correct this.\n\nThe files of every political prisoner must be reviewed to see which ones are suitable for release. By officially redeeming these prisoners we will not only be regaining many bright minds and strong bodies that will serve the Union, but we will have earned their undying loyalty as their liberators."

 IRK_regional_embrace_democratic_centralism_desc: "Many people are under the impression that communism is inherently tyrannical, and those who saw Yagoda's tenure as Premier could be forgiven for believing that, but it is not true. Lenin called for a Dictatorship of the Proletariat, but this sort of dictatorship is not mutually exclusive with democracy. While the Communist Party is the vanguard of the revolution and must always maintain control over the revolutionary state, a form of limited democracy within the party can be allowed.\n\nUnder this new system we will allow party members who have worked within the government for a minimum of 4 years and are found to be in good political and moral standing to vote on various matters. Of course, only communists will be allowed to vote and run for office, but even a limited form of democracy will prove to the people that we are not just another despotic government."

 IRK_regional_a_bargain_with_the_officers_desc: "In the struggle between the Party and the State, one of our most loyal allies was the Red Army. Their strong opposition to NKVD interference in their work made them our natural partners, but with our common enemy now reduced to irrelevancy, there is little left to unite us. To avoid allowing any distance to form between the Union's government and its military a few members of the Presidium have recommended striking a bargain with the commanders of the Red Army.\n\nThis deal would involve allocating more of the budget to the military to fund modernization efforts and improvements to the training curriculum. The generals have clamored for more funding for some time, and granting it to them will strengthen the bonds between the Communist Party and the Red Army. It would also have the added benefit of strengthening our military for a future conflict, which seems likely if Russia is to be reunited."

 IRK_regional_the_revolution_renewed_desc: "Our enemies in the State faction told us we could never succeed without them. They said that we were too idealistic, that we should leave the governing to them. We were told to stick to theorizing about the revolution and inspiring the masses to support the Union while they ran the show. They said we wouldn't know how to run a nation, and we would fail without them. We have proven them wrong.\n\nThere is no denying that at first there were difficulties. The bureaucracy had to be purged of those who tried to oppose us, leaving many of our departments gutted. The fact that we had just reclaimed a huge stretch of territory did not make establishing a new system any easier. But we learned as we went and we consolidated our control. Now our rule is unquestioned across all of eastern Siberia. Every town from Irkutsk to Kamchatka flies the red banner, knowing that they serve the Revolutionary state. Lenin's dream is not dead. It is only just beginning."

 IRK_regional_the_proletarian_dictatorship_forever_state_desc: "The ultimate victory of the proletariat against its class enemies is now forever assured. General Secretary Yagoda has triumphed over all of the combined forces of fascism, liberalism and anarchy that once beset his rule, and in doing so guaranteed the survival of the communist system he has helped to perfect. His enemies lie in graves, their ideas alongside them, and it is only a matter of time before all of Russia is reunified under the only true successor to the USSR. It is only a matter of time now before all of Russia from Vladivostok to Kiev is seized from its occupiers, and all the people of this great land saved from the enemies of the people that dwell within it.\n\nIt is not enough to say that the Soviet Union will merely survive this crisis: it will be strengthened by it. The rebirth of communism and the perfection of its form under Comrade Yagoda has rendered the system stronger and more proficient than ever before, ready and capable to both see to the needs of the people and to enact the destruction of their enemies. Our journey is far from over, but the ship of state is on the right course, and the best possible man to lead Russia and reforge the Soviet Union is secure at the helm. There is nothing that communism cannot overcome, no enemy that the Soviet Union cannot defeat, and no man that can stand in the way of the General Secretary any longer. Our victory is assured, but we are still earlier in our destiny, and there are many enemies yet to vanquish and struggles yet to suffer. The Soviet people will look to their leader for guidance, and Yagoda will keep his gaze aimed squarely at the horizon, guiding his people to the next struggle they will be ready to endure in his name."

The chaos of the October Revolution, the fascist invasion, the flight to Irkutsk, and the treachery of Sablin's partisans. We have faced countless challenges and we have overcome them all. Now, after decades of struggle, we have finally reclaimed the eastern part of our glorious Union. Peace and prosperity have returned to this war-torn land, and all across Siberia the people are celebrating our return to power.\n\nSome celebration is certainly due, but our task is far from over. To our west are traitors and warlords who seek to steal Russia for themselves. Beyond them lie the Nazis who still enslave many of our people. We have not faced our last challenge, but we will overcome these new foes just as we defeated those who came before them. The great drive to the west is coming, and this time the revolution of the proletariat will not be stopped so easily."

Before them lies the accession of the Far East's economy, a duty many would see as little more than a punishment. But this herculean task is necessary for the Union's future prosperity, and perhaps, even its survival in the coming struggle of complete reunification.\n\nWhen it is done, a new Economic Plan is to be drawn. As the plans of old, it will define the road to socialist success that our citizens shall follow, in order to achieve victory in the struggle against the imperialistic fascist powers, to reclaim the lost Homeland of the Revolution."
 
 IRK_regional_industrial_centric_development: "Industrial-Centric Development"
 IRK_regional_industrial_centric_development_desc: "Our Union, brought back from a lifeless stasis, finds itself in a world very different from the point of its collapse. The previous mixed system of rural agrarianism combined with the industrialization of urban centers is unfeasible within the present economic international realities. In fact, agriculture's contribution to an average country's GDP no longer constitutes the majority. The dominant economies of the world are approaching a new model largely oriented towards the service sector and the integration of recent technological development into praxis.\n\nWhat this means for us, simply speaking, is we need to catch up with the rest of the world. While some plans for rapid modernization have been outlined, it has been decided that the matter should rather be approached cautiously. Reckless transition straight to a service-based economy will only harm the Union in the long run. For now, we must go through an evolutionary path and focus on properly restarting the key industrial centers of the Far East."
 
 IRK_regional_a_transitional_approach: "A Transitional Approach"
 IRK_regional_a_transitional_approach_desc: "With the recent doctrinal development cementing the role of the state in the economy, calls for fully implementing this principle in the existing economy are beginning to grow louder by the day. However, many within the party are opposed to what they view as a betrayal of practices established by Bukharin, to whose Siberian Plan our government owes much of its current assets.\n\nTo prevent a disastrous split within the party, Comrade Yagoda has devised what he calls "The Transitional Approach to Economics". It has been described as a set of conceptual principles that pragmatically amalgamates major aspects of Lenin's and Bukharin's economic theories with Yagoda's own thesis. It declares the present state of the Union "transitional" between a market system and developed, "true socialism". Thus, it guarantees the position of both the state and private enterprise, satisfying both factions that have emerged over this dilemma, and bringing over the Age of Transition."
 
 IRK_regional_partition_of_the_coast: "Partition of the Coast"
 IRK_regional_partition_of_the_coast_desc: "While political decentralization served us far from well in the past, it will do no harm to divide the underdeveloped regions into separate economic zones. This will, naturally, rationalize the local management of the economy, increasing awareness of the problems in each given area.\n\nBut the greatest advantage of this policy, and the one we're after, is if we use the precedent of these zones' autonomous bureaucracies, we can establish separate economic legislation there. This would allow us to selectively loosen restrictions for foreign trade and investment, without compromising on greater national trade policies, while still bringing foreign capital to work developing our backward regions.\n\nConveniently, the region that would benefit most from this is the Pacific Coast with the zones there drawn around the urban ports, already promising centers of international trade."
 
 IRK_regional_invest_in_transportation: "Invest in Transportation"
 IRK_regional_invest_in_transportation_desc: "Of all the land of the former Union, our government managed to reclaim the Far East. And while the region has a proud history of brave settlers taming the frontier, and partisans fighting reactionary tyrants, it was regrettably neglected by previous instances of leadership. It was largely a backwater peripheral region in the days of the empire and was often underinvested into even by Lenin's administration. Comrade Bukharin did have plans for renovating its economy as part of the Siberian Plan, but they, regrettably, came to pass only partially, as the Union was ultimately shattered.\n\nThe consequences of this centuries' worth of neglect are most prevalent in the transport sector of the economy. It has been, in fact, determined, that the regional industrial potential's greatest limit is the capabilities of the infrastructure, which are, even in the best cases, below satisfactory. Thankfully, the Transitional Approach takes transportation into account, with the new economic zones granted funds and economic authority to make the necessary investment in transportation facilities to achieve the goals set in the greater All-Union Plan."
 
 IRK_regional_form_the_special_economic_sectors: "Form the Special Economic Sectors"
 IRK_regional_form_the_special_economic_sectors_desc: "Some of the economists within the government recently came up with an intriguing proposal. They suggest some regions be designated as "Special Economic Sectors", with free market-type regulations, flexible trade policy and tax incentives to promote the concentration of capital and technological investment.\n\nWhile initially proposed as an alternative to Economic Zoning, this initiative gained traction within the party, with pushing for adopting both policies alongside each other, arguing there would be mutual benefit from cooperation between the two new types of economic autonomies. Comrade Yagoda sees no reason to object."
 
 IRK_regional_invite_boeing: "Invite Boeing"
 IRK_regional_invite_boeing_desc: "Among the foreign corporations who expressed interest in allocating some of their assets to the new sectors provided for investments by our Union, the Boeing Company seems to be the most indecisive, which has caused considerable difficulties due to our own aviation industry being quite underdeveloped. While the large distances between our urban centers create a sizable civilian aviation market and the applications of their military developments are obvious, the world's largest aerospace contractor sits on the fence, reluctant to cooperate with us.\n\nEvidently, the entrepreneurs behind Boeing distrust the proclamation of the Transitional Approach that we made. As the policy is nominally a temporary measure, it deters them from investing, fearing they would lose the funds when the transition to a fully state-controlled socialist model comes in the future. We must convince them, along with various other investors, that we are not planning on returning to war communism anytime soon, and that their investments in the future of our Union will pay off."
 
 IRK_regional_a_rival_for_the_sphere: "A Rival for the Sphere"
 IRK_regional_a_rival_for_the_sphere_desc: "One key factor that many analysts and economical theorists of the Union have continuously brought up since the time of the Far East's reunification, is the greater international picture we now find ourselves in. Our main concern is the imperialist ambition of Japan, over the years culminated in the foundation of the so-called 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' - a periphery of satellite states clearly aimed at the exploitation of their resources and peoples by Tokyo. Unfortunately, as the dominant power in Asia, their empire theoretically enjoys a degree of influence and might far above the Union's.\n\nHowever, in actuality, the Sphere is a crumbling structure, built to inspire awe, but not to last. Recent developments have shown, that its diplomatic alienation deprived it of developed trading partners, which in combination with bureaucratic incompetence has significantly damaged the Sphere's economic potential, to the point where we can directly compete with them on the international stage.\n\nBy putting our efforts towards actively toppling Japan from its seat of economic power in Asia we can both benefit from replacing that position ourselves, and undermine one of our most dangerous regional competitors. After that, the bright future of our Union's economy shall be all but assured."

 IRK_regional_echoes_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "After a series of debates, including those on the role of the state in the economy, the anti-Bukharinist revisionist demagogues have been exposed and denounced by those truly loyal to the Party and its efforts in building socialism! The New Economic Policy has once rebuilt the Union from the devastation brought by the Civil War. It will rebuild the Union again from the ruins of a collapsed Russia!\n\nIt has thus been decided, that the Siberian Plan, which was aimed at developing the economy of the region after the union's government was forced to relocate east, shall be continued, albeit with a few corrections. Notably, with the party's main target being the complete reunification of lost territories, noticeably major share of investment is to be devoted to military production and heavy industry."
 
 IRK_regional_import_industrial_machinery: "Import Industrial Machinery"
 IRK_regional_import_industrial_machinery_desc: "As the old Siberian Plan mostly centered the state investments on heavy industrial buildup, our present economic apparatus shall toe this line. However, it faces a series of problems, the most important of which is the loss of a considerable amount of industrial equipment over the process of collapse and the subsequent restoration of soviet power in the Far East.\n\nWhile the existing production complex can be rerouted towards the machine industry to replace the absent pieces of machinery, it would completely derail the plan and serve as a completely irrational waste of resources. It has instead been decided to import the missing parts of the production cycle so that the domestic industry can focus on the original goals of the economic plan."
 
 IRK_regional_lessons_from_manchukuo: "Lessons from Manchukuo"
 IRK_regional_lessons_from_manchukuo_desc: "The Japanese client state of Manchukuo to our south has historically been surprisingly developed, being at one point the third dominant industrial power in East Asia after Japan itself and the old Union. While the roots of this lie in Japan pumping resources and capital into its puppet state, their management of such resources presents a curious case.\n\nWhile retaining the core tenets of fascist state-monopolistic capitalism, the 'Manchurian Model' as it came to be known largely managed to avoid bureaucratic stagnation through rationalization of management, which allowed for the state to exercise its powers for the optimization of the wartime economy. This is especially evident in sectors of Manchukuo's heavy industry, which at times outperform those of Japan. While we won't resort to copying fascists, the Manchurian Model does illustrate a few principles we can learn from, primarily in the sphere of streamlining bureaucracy."
 
 IRK_regional_the_shipyards_of_amur: "The Shipyards of Amur"
 IRK_regional_the_shipyards_of_amur_desc: "When we defeated the fascist clique of Amur, we reclaimed the small coastal town of Chumikan, long occupied by their so-called "All-Russian Government". While the most recent records we have from 1939 list it as barely more than a fishing village, it seems that Rodzaevsky's bandits developed its port out of necessity, so that the Japanese could properly supply their lapdogs with equipment and provisions. Fortunately, this crude transport hub can be repurposed into a proper trading port and shipbuilding facility.\n\nWhile the ports of Magadan and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky could fulfill the task already, they are poorly connected with the regional center. Additionally, sub-optimal climate may render them unusable over the cold period of the year. Thus, Chumikan has been designated as the 'most economically viable port', and is to be developed accordingly, so that our Union can establish a naval presence in the Okhotsk Sea, challenging the crumbling Japanese hegemony."

 IRK_regional_develop_the_aerospace_industry_desc: "Since the pitiful defeat of the old Union at the hands of the fascist hordes, who truly demonstrated the full potential of aviation - the third dimension of warfare, many have expressed their desire to invest in the aviation industry. However, with the relocation to Siberia, we lost much expertise, and now is the first time we find our industry capable of rearming the air force up to modern standards.\n\nWhile the production base is already capable of producing airplanes, the main challenge we are posed with is the lack of technological insight. To remedy this, a curious proposal has been made by a group of theorists. It includes various projects aimed to increase cooperation between the military and the scientific complexes, to ensure that the Union will reach the skies, and perhaps, one day, the stars."
 
 IRK_regional_the_resources_of_siberia: "The Resources of Siberia"
 IRK_regional_the_resources_of_siberia_desc: "History shows that many nations' efforts to industrialize were hampered by lack of a resource base. Some lacked the metals for heavy machinery, some were short on fossil fuels to supply factories. Fortunately, our Union finds itself fully supplies itself from the inexhaustible riches of Siberia.\n\nWhile a point has been made that a full-scale resource-based economy would be harmful in the long term, it's simply foolish to ignore the deposits of raw material that could become our primary source of income. And although it is universally agreed that the economy should be diversified, investments into resource gathering operations have been found necessary to supply our industrial complex in the process of modernization."

 IRK_regional_investments_for_the_peasants_desc: "While the party might be split over the question of what role should the state have in the process of industrialization, it is largely united when it comes to policies required to revitalize the agriculture of the Union.\n\nThough the present Economic Plan is largely centered around industrial development of urban centers, the quotas for predominantly agrarian rural areas have gone up as well, and several initiatives for intensification of their economies have already come up. One more ambitious proposal is to revive the Machine-Tractor Stations - local enterprises for ownership and maintenance of agricultural machinery, established in the late 1920s. These will allow the underperforming Sovkhozes to modernize with state investment, leading to a considerable increase in agricultural output."
 
 IRK_regional_compromise_on_imports: "Compromise On Imports"
 IRK_regional_compromise_on_imports_desc: "Ever since the bitter defeat of the Union and its relocation to Siberia, the question of protectionism dominated the disputes regarding matters of Soviet agriculture. With the soils of the Far East are far from fertile, especially when compared to fields of the Russian Plain, a certain amount of products will have to be imported, potentially harming local production.\n\nNow, with the Far East reunified under the rightful authority of comrade Yagoda's government, this question rises again. Fortunately, the Union's economists have found a compromise solution. It calls for a complex system that ensures import contracts are scaled in accordance with the fulfillment of the economic plan. This policy, if streamlined properly, will encourage domestic production of goods that would otherwise be imported without devolving into outright autarky."

 IRK_regional_the_paris_of_siberia_desc: "The city from which we reunified the Far East, Irkutsk, has a glorious history and was one of the most developed even before the old Union's demise. However, what once was known as the Paris of Siberia has come to be in a state of disarray. Many of its buildings are not up to present standards, its streets unoptimized for modern traffic movement, its universities, and industries archaic and obstructing the greater economic plans we have for the region.\n\nIt seems, that much like its namesake in 1853, the Paris of Siberia will require a series of renovations to become a modern urban center. While some comrades suggest postponing it until we again control all of Russia, Comrade Yagoda has ultimately decided that this renewal will be vital to the process of reunification itself and authorized to start it sooner rather than later."

While the present situation necessitates the majority of them to be put off, some of the ideas concerning major centers have been cautiously accepted by the according authorities.\n\nThese initiatives cover mostly matters of infrastructure, ensuring both better transportation within the cities and between them. A few of the accepted projects also deal with the education system, aiming to enhance its facilities to prepare a future scientific base for the Union."
 
 IRK_regional_redirect_the_transsib: "Redirect the TransSib"
 IRK_regional_redirect_the_transsib_desc: "One problem we face when managing urban developments is the Trans-Siberian Railway. While its existence is greatly beneficial as the main axis of transportation between the cities of the Far East, the TransSib only covers the southernmost areas of the Union, economically alienating areas unconnected to it, including the prosperous ports on the Okhotsk Sea and resource-rich inland districts of Yakutia.\n\nWhile Sakha's oil and gas reserves need little more than pipeline, for Magadan, de-facto our main port, a railway connection is vital. Thus it has been found necessary to start constructing a new branch of the TransSib, going north, along the Pacific coast. While extending a railway through the depths of Siberia is no easy task, and some are already dubbing it "The Construction Project of the Century" due to the difficulties of the initiative, the task itself should be relatively simple to achieve."

 IRK_regional_invest_in_egalitarian_schooling_desc: "It has become evident over the course of reunification, that in modern warfare, military technological developments significantly influence the outcome of the conflict. Many theorists within the Party have thus turned their minds to optimizing scientific output to further the reclamation of Russia by utilizing new, advanced armaments, and ensure our Union's prosperity thereafter by developing civilian-applied technology.\n\nOne obvious method for that is to develop the academia extensively, through the recruitment of new scientists. It has thus been found detrimental, that in the spirit of proletarian egalitarianism, potential intellectuals of all sexes, nationalities, and backgrounds should be provided the necessary education and resources to conduct research for the benefit of the Union. If we are to achieve this, first we must direct our efforts towards eliminating the few remaining prejudices of the education system. For instance, "minority talent initiatives" can be used to reduce those of ethnicities typically glossed over by higher learning."

Soon, even the most optimistic predictions will be surpassed, and soviet society will truly enter the technological age!\n\nOf course, this utopia of the proletarian mind will not come by on its own. The academia must double their efforts on the cultural and scientific front of the revolutionary struggle, and with their sweat, a new future of the people will be forged.

Gone were its proud tank corps, artillery battalions and air wings - presuming the general's vainglory, all rent into bone fragments and scrap metal along the A-A line. Subsequent struggles against reactionaries and revisionists further chipped away at the armed forces until only what remained of the NKVD and its auxiliaries flew the Red Army's tattered banners.\n\nSuffice to say, the Union has recaptured much of its glory since. Its reinvigorated position in the Far East has broadened our options for likewise restoring the Red Army's invincible might. Yet we must not dally in doing so, for Comrade Yagoda eyes westward greater threats to the revolution than bandits and petty warlords.

 IRK_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution_desc: "The Red Army has never strayed from its principles despite its diminished state. Great Lenin sounded the call for a people's militia, intrinsically intertwined with the class-conscious, to protect the revolution; hence did our generals raise militiamen from Moscow to Irkutsk. Their bayonets were rusty, their rifles antiquated, and their ranks a far cry from the thousand battalions of Chairman Bukharin's time - yet the Union's conscripted soldiery have nevertheless protected our proletariat as an old buckler shields its owner from cuts and crippling blows.\n\nWith the new glut of resources at the Union's disposal, we can now reforge our worn, splintered buckler into the unbreakable aegis that it once was. Soon the Red Army shall meet its foes with tanks, automatic weapons, and fresh divisions of disciplined fighting men."

 IRK_regional_a_coequal_branch_desc: "No matter the fortunes which had befallen our Union, the good men and women of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs never strayed from its side. They had loyally fulfilled their duties since the October Revolution and continue to fulfill their duties even when threats flank the Motherland's every vulnerability. So strong is the NKVD's sense of purpose that it even preoccupies itself with responsibilities beyond its charter, like supplementing the Red Army's equipment and manpower with its own.\n\nIt would be remiss of us not to acknowledge their loyalty simply because our situation has improved. Hence, the Presidium of the Soviet Union has decreed the formalization of the NKVD's de facto status as a separate branch of the Soviet Armed Forces. With this elevation comes a secure place in the Union's annual defense budget in addition to a large say over military affairs - appropriate recompense for a state organ that has proven its worth time and again."

 IRK_regional_trust_in_the_army_desc: "Midday in the snowy plains of Siberia. A Guards battalion spots ramshackle hovels clustered a distance away. Colonel and staff consult HQ's maps - a village, barely a dot, beside the route to their rendezvous point. The men decide to approach, introduce themselves to its elders, perhaps secure provisions to supplement their rations. They expected a welcome conferred to liberators - like in the trickles of Suvorov that made the trek to the distant East.\n\nThe battalion departed with neither welcomes nor provisions an hour later. Bloodshot stares behind rotting wood frames trailed their silhouettes until the horizon swallowed the column whole.\n\nMany more units report similar stories throughout our broad westward front. Each lend credence to an issue heretofore unaddressed: that the people have become so inured to warlordism as to treat any armed formation, even their own protectors, like common marauders. We must address this somehow."
 
 IRK_regional_recentralize_the_armed_forces: "Re-Centralize the Armed Forces"
 IRK_regional_recentralize_the_armed_forces_desc: "Delegating control of the Red Army's operational tempo to the frontline formations' field officers, rather than an all-seeing general staff, may have sufficed when its greatest engagements consisted of glorified skirmishes, raids and counter-raids against bands of organized thugs. Or when fronts could be measured in hundreds of meters, not miles. Or when signals equipment were worth their weight in gold for how few remained after years of combat losses and neglect.\n\nThese conditions have changed - and not necessarily for the better. Comrade Yagoda clamors for war against warlords our equals in strength and resources, and whose borders likewise equal Russia's breadth. The Comrade's field marshals believe there is no better time than now to reassert high command's supremacy over the battlefield; doing so, they advise, will allow the Red Army to conduct operational art on a scale unseen since the Great Patriotic War."
 
 IRK_regional_hybrid_training_programs: "Hybrid Training Programs"
 IRK_regional_hybrid_training_programs_desc: "With new equipment comes new problems, as quartermasters and strategists are wont to say. Ours now suffer this peculiar curse with the reintegration of old luxuries - heavy armor and air support, in particular - into their divisions. Like a dilapidated truck left to gather dust for lack of fuel forgets how to combust its engine, the Red Army has forgotten how to fight like a proper modern army.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense has begun addressing this issue twofold: first, by expanding the Union's military academies so to accommodate lessons in tank and aerial warfare; and second, by organizing exercises which involve elements from all branches of the Soviet Armed Forces acting in tandem. Practice makes perfect; so too will it make an invincible force in the Union's hands."
 
 IRK_regional_tactical_reassessments: "Tactical Re-Assessments"
 IRK_regional_tactical_reassessments_desc: "When the Red Army's largest formations shrank from military districts to half-strength divisions, its planners emphasized small-unit combat over simultaneous, front-wide attacks. When the Red Army's air wings plummeted one by one in Barbarossa, its planners disregarded air power as a force multiplier altogether. And when the Red Army's heavier assets - tanks, helicopters, artillery - either stayed behind in the Urals or defected during the Siberian War, its planners utilized trucks with small arms to great extents. Shifting circumstances, after all, warrant a shift in priorities.\n\nNow the Soviet Union has regained much of the factories it had lost. Rearming our divisions with armor and fire support will take time, but the average division will eventually enjoy unprecedented levels of available firepower. We should reprioritize our war plans accordingly."

 IRK_regional_focus_on_equipment_quality_desc: "Our desperate straits following the Siberian War reflected aptly on the Red Army's equipment: a haphazard mix of rifles, pistols, and support guns, some of which may have seen service in the Siege of Peking. Fortunately, the warlords that had surrounded the Union then were in no better condition.\n\nThis becomes less true as we push west, where the men will confront armies fed either by Siberia's industries or the Trans-Ural's ample stockpiles. The Presidium, under Comrade Yagoda's advice, has given the Ministry of Defense Industry a mandate to mass-produce quality weapons for the Red Army's use. In this they will be assisted by near-every factory our divisions reclaim."

We invite stresses to the tenuous logistics networks we've established by committing to such a schedule... but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have found a temporary solution.\n\nThe ports of the Far East - Magadan, Petropavlovsk, Nikolayevsk-on-Amur - are open for trading with the United States and its allies. Their boundless industries had supplied the Union's forces during the Great Patriotic War. Perhaps we should consider revisiting this old relationship?"

If our men can't damage these hardened targets, we will not be able to engage enemy armor on equal footing. Fortunately, there are many stockpiles of anti-tank weapons that have not yet been exploited. We need to go out and collect as many of these weapons as we can for our fledgling army."

 IRK_regional_asymmetrical_strategies_desc: "Conventional warfare in Siberia is nearly impossible for us to wage. The frontlines are simply too long for the amount of soldiers we are able to field. Mobile units able to act on their own will be what wins the day for us.\n\nAble to coordinate over the endless tundra, our men will be trained to fight in the harsh, barren conditions. Hit and run tactics will be emphasised, and our men will be taught how to operate effectively in small units. As we have for years, we must make do with what we have, and perfecting our use of asymmetrical tactics will give us a much needed edge over the other warlords."
 
 IRK_regional_partition_the_army_commissariat: "Partition the Army Commissariat"
 IRK_regional_partition_the_army_commissariat_desc: "One of our biggest issues is organizing our armed forces. Footmen aren't just expected to garrison towns or be on standby incase of attacks, but also procure their own equipment, maintain their own gear, buy and prepare their own food, and so on. There are no specialized units in our armed forces to supply our men. While acceptable for a small warlord, this situation is unacceptable; we will never be able to reclaim our homelands with our army in such a disorganized state!\n\nWe need a specialized logistics branch in our army. We need men who know how to procure equipment and transport it to men in faraway places. We need specialized trainers, mechanics, and medics! Every man will have purpose in our army, which will greatly increase our fighting effectiveness."

Now that we have access to the oceans once again, it is time to make some investments in our shipbuilding capabilities.\n\nHulks that are mothballed and can be recalled back into service should be at once.

Many of these men are very experienced sailors and navy men, who are no strangers to navigating the treacherous Bering Sea and the far northern reaches of the Pacific Ocean. It would be tragic to waste such experience. We should offer these seamen amnesty in exchange for service in our navy."

It has never been because we haven't wanted to, we simply never had the planes to justify the costs.

The costs will be high, but the benefits far outweigh the costs."

 IRK_regional_air_supremacy_doctrine_desc: "It would be foolish to allow other warlords a chance to claim the skies for themselves. Why allow our enemies the chance to bomb our men on the ground in the first place?\n\nOur air marshals are pushing the policy of air supremacy for our newly organized airforce. Domination of the skies is key to winning wars in the modern age, as the Nazis know all too well. Modern warfare requires modern air support, and we will not fall behind; our air force will be a key force in future battles!"

 IRK_regional_the_home_of_the_revolution_desc: "Russia was the first nation to embrace the revolution of the proletariat, and despite all the challenges and setbacks she has faced, the Motherland is still leading the charge. With our hold over the Far East secure the time has come for the Soviet Union to formally re-enter the world stage. Though much of our union remains in the hands of warlords and traitors, we cannot wait for total reunification before reaching out to potential allies and partners.\n\nRussia has suffered from diplomatic isolation for too long. As the home of the workers' revolution, we must lead by example. We cannot set an example for the workers of the world if we are seen as just another warlord, rather than the legitimate successor to Bukharin's Soviet Union. The movement that began in 1917 never ended. We have recovered our momentum, and the time has come for the Soviet Union's triumphant return!"
 
 IRK_regional_develop_the_merchant_marine: "Develop the Merchant Marine"
 IRK_regional_develop_the_merchant_marine_desc: "The first step of rejoining the international community will be engaging in international trade. Siberia is a rich region with bountiful resources that many foreign nations are eager to have access to. The north does not provide everything we need, however, which is why it is more important than ever that we trade with the outside world to import important materials like rubber. Some might say doing business with capitalist empires is a betrayal of the revolution, but the revolution won't get very far if our trucks don't have wheels.\n\nTo facilitate opening trade with the outside world, we have arranged for the purchase of 100 merchant vessels suitable for hauling large amounts of cargo. With this fleet we can kickstart a new soviet merchant marine and import all the resources we could ever need."
 
 IRK_regional_peaceful_coexistence: "Peaceful Co-Existence"
 IRK_regional_peaceful_coexistence_desc: "Our end goal might be global revolution, but for the moment it is just not practical to pursue this. The world is dominated by three giants, America, Germany, and Japan. Of the three, Germany is clearly the biggest threat. While America and Japan embody corrupt capitalism and tyrannical imperialism respectively, they hate the Germans almost as much as we do, so we will tolerate them for the moment.\n\nThe word allies is too strong for what we want. A better term might be collaborators. America and Japan would benefit from a strong Russian nation to oppose Germany, and we would benefit from foreign aid for our quest to retake the Union. As long as this state of affairs continues, it makes more sense for us to pursue peaceful relations until we are prepared for a more direct confrontation."
 
 IRK_regional_across_the_pacific: "Across the Pacific"
 IRK_regional_across_the_pacific_desc: "Between Japan and the USA, the Americans make for obvious partners. We fought on the same side of the last war, and unlike the Japanese the Americans did not seize part of our nation. While the United States supported the fascist traitors in Magadan, we understand neither option is perfect, and between bourgeois capitalists and warmongering fascists, the choice is obvious.\n\nTo be more practical about it, the USA is an industrial and economic colossus. Aligning with them, even temporarily, would open doors to all sorts of arms deals and development plans the Japanese could never hope to finance. The time has come to rebuild the alliance that came so close to defeating fascism 30 years ago. We must send a delegation across the vast Pacific to tell the Americans that they can still count on the Soviet Union to stand with them against fascism. We have their back, just as long as long as they have ours."
 
 IRK_regional_request_american_recognition: "Request American Recognition"
 IRK_regional_request_american_recognition_desc: "The United States recognized the Soviet Union's rule in 1933, opening the possibility of diplomacy and trade between our two nations. While that recognition technically stands as the Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic is the legitimate continuation of the USSR, to say there have been some complications in our diplomatic status would be an understatement.\n\nOur emissaries in the USA report that the American government is conflicted over who to recognize as the legitimate government of Russia, as several strong contenders have emerged in recent years. A gentle reminder that they recognized us over 30 years ago, along with a request that they renew that recognition would significantly boost our credibility in the eyes of the Russian people. We must show the Americans that the upstart states to our west are nothing more than glorified warlords, and dealing with them would be a mistake."
 
 IRK_regional_apply_for_ofn_funding: "Apply for OFN Funding"
 IRK_regional_apply_for_ofn_funding_desc: "We did not start cozying up to the Americans out of the kindness of our hearts or a desire for friendship. We did it for the promise of help in retaking the Soviet Union and restoring the home of the revolution, and the time has come to formalize that commitment. The OFN is one of the largest military alliances in history, and its budget is larger than our entire economy. We shall send a request for funding from the OFN to help train and equip our army.\n\nWith the backing of America and her allies, or armies will be unstoppable. Our soldiers will take to the field using the most modern weapons and equipment. No tank or plane produced in Russia in the last two decades can rival its American equivalent. Our enemies won't be able to match the overwhelming firepower we will soon have access to. The Soviet Union will be retaken with American steel and Russian blood."
 
 IRK_regional_increase_japanese_cooperation: "Increase Japanese Cooperation"
 IRK_regional_increase_japanese_cooperation_desc: "At first glance, the idea of working with the Japanese seems preposterous. They are fascists who openly allied with the Germans in the last war and seized Vladivostok and our territory along the Amur while we had our backs turned. We have every reason to view them as an enemy, and if circumstances were different we almost certainly would. Times have changed, however. Now the fascists are at each other's throats, and while the Japanese stole a city, the Nazis took so much more than that.\n\nOn a practical level, it makes more sense to align with the Japanese than the Americans. Japan wants to see a strong, anti-German Russia as much as America does, but it is geographically closer and far more capable of providing direct support to us. We must set our differences aside, at least for the moment, and focus on the true threat."
 
 IRK_regional_mission_to_tokyo: "Mission to Tokyo"
 IRK_regional_mission_to_tokyo_desc: "Establishing a close relationship with the Japanese Empire will be no easy feat of diplomacy. The entire Japanese government is an imperial cult which is rightly afraid of our revolutionary ideology. It will take lots of work by our diplomats and negotiators to find an opening just to begin discussions. Only then will we be able to show that we are truly interested in setting aside ideology and focusing on pragmatic cooperation.\n\nOur best opening strategy will be a Soviet diplomatic mission right to the heart of the Empire. In Tokyo, our diplomats will be able to meet with their Japanese counterparts as well as influential politicians and military leaders. Once these connections are made we can begin strengthening our ties. Trade deals, embassies, joint development projects, the list of opportunities goes on and on."
 
 IRK_regional_expand_manchurian_trade: "Expand Manchurian Trade"
 IRK_regional_expand_manchurian_trade_desc: "With the Japanese now more willing to do business, we can finally start to benefit from their support. Our nation is positioned on the edge of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the largest economic bloc in the world. While becoming too integrated into it would see us reduced to nothing more than puppets of Japan, doing business with the members of the sphere would be an enormous boost to our economy.\n\nTo our south lies the Empire of Manchukuo, Japan's pet project and a burgeoning industrial powerhouse. The Japanese have poured enormous resources into building up Manchukuo's heavy industry, and we stand to benefit from our proximity. We have abundant natural resources that we could trade for finished products. A deal with the Manchurians, along with developing overland connections between our nations is exactly what we need to kickstart the Union's economy in preparation of the reclamation."

 IRK_regional_sponsor_the_proletarian_movement_desc: "Across the world the proletariat still struggles under the oppressive rule of their masters, whether they be bourgeois capitalists or literal slavers. Without the Soviet Union, there was no strong nation to act as the guardian of the workers of the world. For three decades tyrants around the globe took advantage of our absence, abusing and exploiting the lower class.\n\nBut now we are back.\n\nOur financial and political resources are not what they once were, but they are now enough we can resume our support for socialist movements in foreign countries. While we struggled to reclaim our nation from fascists and traitors several other nations around the world took up the revolutionary banner in our absence. We should welcome them into the fold and begin working towards an international organization of socialist nations." 
 
 IRK_regional_revolutionary_aid_funding: "Revolutionary Aid Funding"
 IRK_regional_revolutionary_aid_funding_desc: "As part of our campaign to increase diplomatic ties between the socialist nations of the world, we must provide a good reason for socialist nations to work together, and more importantly, work with us. The best way to incentivise loyalty and cooperation is with generous amounts of international aid. Some might call this bribery, but that is preposterous. Bribes go to corrupt politicians, while this aid will be going to socialist leaders who stand in solidarity with the proletariat.\n\nBy targeting our donations to specific parties and causes that align with our interests, we can encourage our fellow socialist nations to follow our lead and discourage deviation from the path we have chosen. After all, the Soviet Union was the first nation to embrace the revolution. It is our job to set the course and to make sure the other revolutionary states stick to it."

 IRK_regional_embassies_in_the_liberated_world_desc:"Now that the groundwork has been laid we can begin establishing formal diplomatic ties with our comrades around the world. By creating a system of permanent embassies, each staffed by trained diplomats, we will open up the possibility of ongoing negotiations and communication between all socialist governments. Embassies will also allow for more nuanced diplomatic tactics. The Cameroonians do things very differently than the Russians, and while a delegation to Havana might suffer from culture shock, an embassy there could hold Soviet emissaries who have spent years familiarizing themselves with the nation and its people. The same is true for nations from South America to Europe to Asia.\n\nEstablishing a new socialist embassy system is an instrumental step to creating a global proletarian alliance. We should send this proposal to our prospective allies as soon as possible. The longer we delay, the more time we give the fascists and capitalists to sabotage our plans."

 IRK_regional_support_to_NAJUA: "Support to NAJUA"
 IRK_regional_support_to_NAJUA_desc: "To our south one of the greatest acts of barbarity of the 20th century is playing out. The Japanese colonization of Korea is a tragedy that began in 1911 and has not ceased since. Not only are the Japanese attempting to erase the culture of the Korean people, but they are ruthlessly oppressing the workers of Korea and exploiting them for their labour. They are not unopposed, however. In Northern Korea the NAJUA, led by the freedom fighter Kim Il Sung continue the struggle for Korean independence.\n\nComrade Kim is a proud communist and a shining example of commitment to the revolutionary struggle. If we were to coordinate international support for the NAJUA from socialist nations, it would serve as an excellent show of our diplomatic potency and the strength of cooperation. This act of solidarity with the Korean people will endear us to all who struggle for freedom across the world."
 
 IRK_regional_the_international_reborn: "The International Reborn"
 IRK_regional_the_international_reborn_desc: "The ties have been established. The embassies have been built and staffed. Cooperation and collaboration between socialist nations has reached an all time high. Our diplomats are often asked about the next step in our plan to strengthen the global revolutionary cause but they have kept their lips sealed until now. It is time to unveil the culmination of our diplomatic efforts.\n\nWe will recreate the International as a new political and military alliance that will span across the entire world. This alliance of socialist and communist parties from around the globe will promote the revolutionary cause and fight against fascist and capitalist tyranny wherever they are found. The oppressors of this world will quake in fear when they hear of this new alliance. They have fought so hard to divide us, for they know that together we are stronger than them. A new day is dawning."

At every turn, the old elites and their puppets, knowingly or not, have pulled out all the possible stops to prevent the integration of Central Siberia. History, however, shows that these efforts will all be in vain, just as the white generals of old attempted to maintain their bloody yoke upon the people's necks, these elites and their efforts will prove fruitless."

Yet, undeniably, the time the region spent under warlords and under the false 'Central Siberian Republic' has left the locals with some doubts about the legitimacy of our government in comparison to the old.

Much of the bureaucracy in the region is a holdover from the old regime, or, as is sadly common - from the petty warlords who ruled the region a few years earlier.\n\nIt's time to bring the administration of the two regions together, bringing the west up to par with the east, and allow the Soviet Union to run as the harmonious workers' machine it was always meant to be."

 ### Events ###
 IRK.1.t: "Legacy of the Union"
 IRK.1.desc: "The young child carelessly wandered the rooms of the house as always, noticing even the tiniest detail. After hours of exploration, he came across a small chest. Inside it, one could find a grand collection of glamorous medals, photos and documents. The boy turned to his father and asked him what these were. "Some old things from the days of glory", he said. One item had caught his attention, though: a shiny red-and-gold medal. "This is the Order of Lenin", answered the father before the boy could even open his mouth.\n\n"Who's Lenin?" the child asked. The NKVD guard preparing to take the official to the Presidium looked at him and could not help but smile.\n\n"A great man. Perhaps, if he was still alive, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. Wars, deaths, the oppression of the masses - it could have all been avoided. You need to remember, son, that it is up to us to continue his work. Before you were born, the true rulers of the Motherland fell to the invader in Moscow, but we, the members of the Presidium, saved it with the help of Comrade Yagoda and his friends, and fled to Irkutsk."\n\n"Why are all these awful things happening? Why can't we be happy?"\n\n"The story of how we got here is not a simple one, but you must learn it. First, the Germans came: with their tanks and their bombs, they invaded the Motherland and enslaved millions, ending Bukharin's rule. Then came the rich and their 'intellectuals' who fought us when we were in dire straits, and ended the chances of reclaiming the nation with the Siberian War. Next were the Japanese puppets who came from the east. And the final blow was the mutiny across the lake. We are the only ones left to continue what Lenin started."\n\n"So they all made this happen?""
 IRK.1.a: ""Yes, son. Yes, they did. And Comrade Yagoda will make sure they all pay for it.""

 IRK.2.t: "Black Operations"
 IRK.2.desc: "In a room full of shifting politicians and hushed mutters, Bulanov remained totally silent. Hunched over a radio, he listened intently.-much was at stake.\n\nAlmost 200 kilometers away, a group of men traveled equally silently. Hugging the shores of the moonlit lake, they stalked towards their target. No more than 15 in number, they resembled a flock of birds, each taking his place in a winged formation.\n\nWith the building in sight, their commander raised his fist. The men split into teams, each stepping over the roadside concrete divider. The teams approached the small concrete outpost from opposite sides.\n\nThe first floor was by all accounts effortless. Hardened veterans of the NKVD were more than a match for some sleeping partisans. Knives tore through the sleeping dissidents as if they were pillows. The only sounds to be heard were brief, whimpered cries.\n\nTwo shots was all it took to finish the men who lurked up the staircase, killed in unison as they came to investigate what sounded like a commotion. It was only upon reaching the top of the complex that trouble came. Big walloping booms descended upon the assailants, the product of an American remington.\n\nTwo less then they were before, the NKVD operatives had finally reached their target. He fumbled for his gun, perhaps to kill himself, perhaps to fight off the inevitable. Regardless, he was swiftly descended upon.\n\n'Package secured.'\n\nBulanov straightened himself, turned off the radio, and exited silently."
 IRK.2.a: "Flawlessly executed."

 IRK.3.t: "The Propaganda Offensive"
 IRK.3.desc: "It was anything but funny, and yet Gurevich could hardly contain his laughter.\n\nIt had all happened so fast. One moment he sat in his dilapidated steel chair, enjoying a precious commodity he had secretly uncovered; a cigarette. Next he found himself prone, his body hypnotized in muscle memory forged by remnants of Luftwaffe terrorism in the war.\n\nThis time however, no distant booms accompanied the sound of engines. Simply a soft whoosh, and then silence. As the others slowly uncoiled themselves from fetal positions and emerged from the various shacks they had cowered in, they stared at their commanding officer, who was now hysterical.\n\n"Pamphlets!" he shouted through bouts of absurd laughter. "The bastards have sent us reading material!"\n\nThe quiet tension broke as the people milled about the courtyard again. Some cried, having felt yet another brush with the end. Others returned to their duties, long used to such close calls.\n\nGurevich shuffled through the wet paper at his feet before picking one up to examine. A few others did the same.\n\n"The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is prepared to grant amnesty to any persons who renounce this so called 'Sablinite' rebellion. We, the Presidium urge individuals who possess pertinent information and a sense of patriotism to travel to the city of Irkutsk. Failure to comply with this directive will be viewed as a traitorous action against the people and the Motherland, and prosecuted to the fullest extent."\n\nGurevich crumpled the paper in his hands and stormed off towards the nearest building to convene with Sablin. It was now apparent that not even the skies themselves were safe from NKVD indoctrination."
 IRK.3.a: ""We must hope you will heed our message...""

 IRK.4.t: "Officers Abducted!"
 IRK.4.desc: "Colonel Popov stared down at the stained and outdated map that laid before him, trying to sort this mess out. Ever since his defection from the NKVD, he had been trying his best to lend his talents to the mutineers and show them how a war is supposed to be fought. Perhaps it wouldn't have been such a challenge if they weren't young enough to be Popov's children. Getting these youngsters to work with any kind of cohesion has proved to be more difficult than the colonel had ever expected.\n\n"What are we waiting for? The tyrant's goons lie in wait just beyond that ridge! I say to hell with all of this, we should head over there and kick some ass!" A spirited young officer said, trying to win over the cramped room with his bluster. Popov found himself getting ready to respond, but a muffled noise from outside distracted him from the moment. Glancing at the window, all he could see was the furious Siberian winter continuing its assault on the glass panes. Perhaps it was just the wind? "And what is your plan once we get over there," one of the other officers asked, "charge into their lines and die like idiots?" Popov heard it again, and this time it was closer. The howling wind made it difficult to determine what it was. "Well, we have to do something! I've been freezing my-" The brash young officer was cut off by the sound of the door being violently kicked open.\n\nPopov felt his heart leap out of his chest as he turned his attention to the door. Four imposing figures wearing white camouflage coats and brandishing assault rifles began loudly demanding everyone in the room to surrender their arms. His heart sank as he recognized the badges on their hats. The NKVD had come for him. "I'll never surrender, you bastards!" the young officer boldly shouted at the assailants as he drew his sidearm. He scarcely had the chance to aim before the soldiers unleashed a vicious storm of lead, gunning down every man in the room besides Popov. Ears ringing and vision blurred by the blood of his comrades, the disoriented colonel felt his knees give in. The last thing he remembered seeing that night was the attackers' shadows looming closer and closer."
 IRK.4.a: "Damn them!"

 IRK.5.t: "Putting Down the Traitors"
 IRK.5.desc: "The past decades have been an unrelenting disaster for true patriots of the Motherland. Revolutionary morals, values paid for dearly in the tight streets of Leningrad and the long rails of Novosibirsk, have not been sufficiently practiced or defended.\n\nThe results are cataclysmic. From bickering politicians who refused to act in the face of fascist bandit armies, to the near collapse against the counter-revolutionary republicans in the 50s- much has been lost. Millions of lives have been sacrificed unwillingly by those who would dare to neglect the lessons of the October Revolution.\n\nThe Buryat 'Sablinites' are next in the long line of this ideological rot. It is a rot that has clearly spread beyond control, as Valery Sablin himself was once a promising NKVD commissar. After being foolishly entrusted to organize labor in the construction of hydroelectric power near Lake Baikal, he seized a radio tower to spew his utopian, convenient revisionism.\n\nYagoda and the loyal remnants of the Presidium bear a gargantuan weight upon their shoulders. Years of defeat have left the Union crippled, and its people susceptible to opportunists and liars. It is all too possible that this burgeoning rebel army could spiral out of control, and spell doom for the last remnant of order and legitimacy in this Russian chaos. The scared peasants who tremble beneath Sablin's lies must be convinced to return to their senses, and the conniving men who lead them must be brought to swift justice."
 IRK.5.a: "We will do what must be done..."

 IRK.6.t: "Sablin's End"
 IRK.6.desc: "Yagoda felt the cold flee from his body as his rage grew- It was a pure rage, so diffuse in its targets that its potency overwhelmed his mind.\n\nHe was angry at a great many things, and a great many people, and today made him especially furious. It was important that such rage was directed, and at this precise moment, it landed upon the guard to his right. A single stare leveled the man. His sloped posture rapidly corrected itself, and the incessant tapping of his foot ceased. That would do.\n\nHis composure regained, Yagoda's eyes returned to the malnourished creature that sat before him. The foolish boy who refused to break, or even bend. A lesser man might be swayed by such a display, but Yagoda was not impressed by traitors. He had seen too many.\n\nHis hands clasped together on the table, and he stared into Sablin's lowered eyes.\n"I tire of this spectacle. You have been offered a chance to repent your crimes, to show the people the error in your ways and heal the Union you fractured."\n\nYagoda noticed a fire flash across the young man's face, the same spark that he had observed upon detainment. He remained defiantly silent.\n"Maybe you perceive yourself as a brave man. I know better. Enough time has been wasted, there is much to be done beyond this petty revolt. If you wish for death, so be it."\n\nHis hand rose from the table, and upon his motioning Sablin was carried away. The new union would have no room for such foolish men. Utopians, revisionists, and squabbling politicians would no longer be allowed to destroy the dream fought for so long ago. If the Union was to reclaim life from the fascists, it would have to be stronger. This time, he would make sure it was."
 IRK.6.a: "Good riddance."

 IRK.7.t: "Reclaiming the Union"
 IRK.7.desc: "Genrikh Yagoda had been spending the evening as he usually did, meticulously going over the mountain of reports and dossiers that had accumulated in his office that day. On this occasion, however, the task was not as soul-grinding as usual, for each report painted small fragments of a much larger, optimistic picture: all of Yagoda's plans and hard work were finally coming together. One report stated clearly that any lingering Sablinite influence in Irkutsk had seemingly dissipated for good. It seems that all of the investigations and purges had borne fruit after all. Even now Yagoda couldn't help but feel remnants of anger and betrayal when he thought about the foolish exploits of the mutineers, and how their brazen defiance of the Union caused him so much trouble. At least now he could take comfort in the fact that they would never trouble him again.\n\nAfter some time, he had finally come to the real meat of that evening's reading: the Red Army's reports on combat readiness. What he saw was all the more promising. Not only did High Command report that the military was close to recovering all manpower lost during the mutiny, but also that the subsequent organizational reforms were going through without issue. Intermixed were various updates on the NKVD's espionage efforts into neighboring warlord states, and they had all come back with roughly the same conclusion: the fascists' forces were hopelessly unable to match the Red Army in pitched battle. Once the proper plans of attack had been drawn up, Yagoda anticipated that the coming wars would be a mere triviality assuming the NKVD's reports were accurate.\n\nLighting a cigarette, Yagoda leaned back in his chair and began to think about the future. It was obvious that the war for the interior was coming to a close. From this point onward, his efforts would almost solely be focused on reclaiming whatever was wrestled away from the Soviet Union in its darkest hours. The uphill struggle to take back what was lost would soon begin, and the world would never be the same."
 IRK.7.a: "Failure is not an option."

 IRK.8.t: "The Great Purge"
 IRK.8.desc: ""Comrade Yagoda, you wished to speak with me?" Pavel Bulanov asked as he stepped into Yagoda's office. The door was pulled shut behind him, and the room was now silent, save for the clock on Yagoda's desk. "Have a seat, Comrade Bulanov." Genrikh Yagoda always had a humorless look about him, but there was something especially troubling about his demeanor this time. "Comrade Bulanov, I'm sure you are aware by now that I am rather displeased with the state of my administration?" Bulanov could only guess where this was headed." Yes, comrade, I have heard rumors."\n\n"Allow me to reveal to you how I really feel then. I'm absolutely livid, Bulanov. Ever since we defeated Sablin's merry band of traitors, it has become painfully clear that I am surrounded by corrupt buffoons who couldn't run an office to save their lives." Although Yagoda did not raise his voice, his eyes betrayed a great anger. "I see, have you tried scheduling a meeting? Perhaps you could speak sense into them, comrade." Yagoda frowned. "And continue to bash my head against a wall? Come now, Bulanov. I wouldn't have asked for my security chief if I intended to reason with these people." Yagoda then pushed a folder across his desk towards Bulanov. "This is a dossier of 'troublemakers' I have been gathering for some time. I want the NKVD to start a full investigation as soon as possible." Bulanov noticed a smaller piece of paper attached to the folder. Upon closer inspection, it was a list of names and instructions. "And what is this for, Comrade Yagoda?"\n\n"Those are people that I want behind bars or in front of a firing squad by tomorrow morning. I don't want my intentions to be misinterpreted by anyone, Comrade Bulanov. Our great Union is in for the wake-up call of a lifetime." Later that night, Pavel Bulanov arrived alone at the NKVD headquarters in Irkutsk. Only minutes later, a large column of trucks filled to the brim with NKVD officers left the compound under cover of darkness and rolled into the city to inflict terror upon the enemies of the people. The Great Purge had begun."
 IRK.8.a: "Screams and gunshots echoed through the night."

 IRK.9.t: "Into the Files"
 IRK.9.desc: "For the past two weeks, the special NKVD commission had been meeting in their headquarters in Irkutsk every day to lay the groundwork for investigating the more high-profile targets of Yagoda's purges. Files were examined, evidence was reviewed, and men's very fates were to be decided upon. Those who were in the commission were a veritable who's-who of the NKVD's highest echelons. Among them was Security Chief Pavel Bulanov, and, on this occasion, General Secretary Yagoda himself.\n\n"Now, comrades, that we are in the process of gathering enough evidence to arrest every man who has attained a Soviet political office in the past 10 years, there is still one question that we have yet to broach, and I figure now would be as good a time as any." Almost every man in the room looked to Bulanov in anticipation. "Once these men are in custody, how do you all propose they are dealt with?" Much to Bulanov's dismay, the room almost immediately fell into a deafening silence.\n\nAfter a deceptively long quiet intermixed with nervous glances and coughs, it was finally broken by a visibly irritated Yagoda. "You mean to tell me that you idiots have been meeting in this place for almost two goddamn weeks now and still haven't figured this out? What a joke." After further silence, only one officer had the courage to speak up. "Now that you mention it, that does seem like a rather important detail to leave open..." Yagoda only sighed and buried his face into his hand in response. Bulanov attempted to alleviate the situation before Yagoda began demanding names. "Comrade Yagoda, if I may, how do you think the punishments should be dealt? These investigations, after all, were your idea. Perhaps it would be best if you were the one to decide?" Yagoda lifted his head to respond. "We will show no mercy. These corrupt, incompetent parasites will be shot so that they may never trouble us again. As for those who are too useful to fill with lead, I will decide in due time. From now on, please do not make me do everything myself, comrades." With that, Yagoda left the room. The rest were not far behind."
 IRK.9.a: "Time to get to work."

 IRK.10.t: "The Irkutsk Trials"
 IRK.10.desc: ""Do the defendants admit to the crimes of treason, espionage, wrecking, terrorism, homicide, rape, arson, public indecency, and anti-Soviet activities?" As the prosecutor aggressively listed off increasingly absurd accusations, one could practically see what little hope had remained in the accused leaving their very bodies. What were once some of the highest-ranking bureaucrats in Irkutsk were now decrepit figures standing before what would become one of the most infamous trials in the town's entire history. The sad, condemned men gave a meek nod in response to the accusations. They had little strength left in them to resist the inevitable.\n\n"The court hereby finds the accused guilty of all charges, and sentences them to the supreme penalty of execution by firing squad!" When these words were said, some men immediately collapsed to the floor and lost their nerve, while others remained standing in cold acceptance of their fate. In no time at all, a group of NKVD soldiers entered and began to violently pull the condemned men out of the ad-hoc courtroom and further into the depths of NKVD headquarters. As they were led through the claustrophobic basement halls, gunshots and panicked yelling could be heard all around them: poor souls who came before them being served their penalties from the barrel of a gun. Some of the prisoners in the group who were still in a state of despair were being dragged by their shirt collars against the ground, kicking and screaming as they went. If these men were going to hell, this place already made it look childish in comparison.\n\nEventually the group was led into a nondescript, concrete room with no windows and only a single dangling light. Some of the prisoners had pictured many places as being their final resting spot, but this glorified bathroom stall was probably the last one they would've expected. The NKVD soldiers ordered the prisoners against the wall, and forcefully shoved those who were too hysterical to move. Soon enough, everyone was lined up and ready."
 IRK.10.a: "Letters of pardon arrive at the last second!"
 IRK.10.b: "Open fire!"

 IRK.11.t: "Our Tactical Lessons"
 IRK.11.desc: ""You have to admit, Comrade Bulanov, although they were traitors, they sure as hell fought like devils." Field Marshal Maslennikov said as he took a sip of his vodka. "Indeed, and it still puzzles me as to how the hell they managed to find so many men and so many rifles under such short notice."\n\n"Hah! Just watch our own forces try and mobilize that fast. It would be a goddamn circus act!" Security Chief Bulanov knew that the Field Marshal was mostly joking, but he couldn't help in seeing the hints of some uncomfortable truths in his jest. When the mutiny began, the sheer size of Sablin's army was a cause for great concern amongst both the NKVD and the Red Army's High Command. Bulanov recalled that even General Secretary Yagoda himself was deeply troubled by the mutineers' ability to mobilize so quickly in comparison to his own forces. "If I had the chance, I'd set about whipping the men back into shape as soon as possible. When the time comes to march against the enemy once more, I don't want to be caught with my pants down again, you know?" Bulanov nodded in response as he took a drink. "You should know, Comrade Field Marshal, that Comrade Yagoda had asked for me to open inquiries into the Sablinite war effort. While I do not doubt his stalwart bravery in all things, I do believe he is still somewhat concerned our forces haven't learned anything from the mutiny. What do you think?"\n\nMaslennikov stopped to think for a moment. When he spoke again, he did so in hushed tones. "You want to know what I think, comrade? I think that if we were to combine our tactics with that of the mutineers, there would not be a single force from the Urals to Kamchatka that could hold our armies back." Perhaps it was because he was just a little drunk, but Bulanov began entertaining the thought that Maslennikov's theory might be necessary. Even after he had stumbled home that evening, Pavel Bulanov still couldn't stop thinking about his discussions with the Field Marshal."
 IRK.11.a: "We should focus on our own strengths!"
 IRK.11.b: "You always learn the greatest lessons of war from your foes."
 
 IRK.12.t: "The Spirit of the Struggle"
 IRK.12.desc: ""What's wrong with them, Maslennikov?" Genrikh Yagoda asked as he walked, not bothering to look back at the entourage that flanked him. The weekly troop inspection had gone without any notable incident as usual, but this time Yagoda seemed much less impressed than usual. "What do you mean, Comrade Yagoda? Was there some kind of problem?" Maslennikov tried to maintain an air of martial professionalism as he spoke, but his tone betrayed a slight hint of fear. Yagoda stopped and finally looked Maslennikov in the eyes. "What do I mean? Did you see them? That boy who sneezed looked like he was about to shit himself."\n\n"Perhaps they fear they'll disappoint you, Comrade Yagoda. Rest assured, the soldiers owe you their utmost devotion and loyalty." Yagoda was still not impressed, and it showed. "The only reason they're loyal is because they're terrified of me, not devoted." After a pause, the walk continued. "Do you remember Sablin's traitors, Maslennikov? Those bastards were willing to follow that damn boy into hell when it came to it. I shudder to think how those frightened souls back there would do in similar circumstances." The group finally arrived at Yagoda's staff car, and the time came for that afternoon's farewells. "Make sure the men are in good order next time, Comrade Field Marshal. I will be in touch." After an exchange of salutes, Yagoda departed from the base.\n\nThe quiet ride gave Yagoda plenty of time to think. He knew that this problem was far more encompassing than just the army. The entire nation saw him as some kind of monster, despite all their efforts to hide these feelings from the public eye. Meanwhile, that bastard Sablin had transformed his image into that of a hero virtually overnight. Yagoda wondered if perhaps he should make some kind of attempt at softening his image. However, Yagoda also knew that he could not risk looking weak in these desperate times. By the time Yagoda had arrived at his office, he had made up his mind."
 IRK.12.a: "I will give them a reason to serve us."
 IRK.12.b: "I do not expect their love, only their loyalty."

 IRK.13.t: "A Traitor's Words"
 IRK.13.desc: "Alexei Kosygin took a sip of his coffee, his eyes seemed distant. "It's interesting to me how far the Buryats were willing to go for Sablin's ideas. Are our policies really so terrible? It's not like they've changed much since Bukharin's day, and nobody was raising a fuss back then." Sergey Bessonov, Yagoda's foreign minister, thought of what to say next. Every so often the two would meet in unassuming locales to discuss things that they would never dare to speak of at the workplace, lest they draw the attention of the feared NKVD. This particular morning, they had found themselves in a sleepy cafe in Irkutsk's suburbs, and the subject was dangerously close to becoming more controversial than usual. Bessonov seemed to care little. "Alexei... do you think that maybe his promises held merit?" Kosygin immediately halted raising his mug as he heard this, and looked up at Bessonov. "What are you saying, exactly?" He said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"His men were willing to lay down their lives for his ideas, fought us tooth and nail. We may not like it, but there had to be something worth looking at there. It just wouldn't make sense otherwise." Kosygin resumed his drinking, his posture slackening once more. "Eh, maybe. How do we know it wasn't just all talk, though? All you have to do is say the right words, and people will die for you. Sablin obviously knew that well, but we'll never know if it was coming from a genuine place."\n\n"Perhaps not. But who's to say we can't succeed where he failed? It would surely go a long way towards endearing us to the people." Kosygin looked up at Bessonov again. "Most of what Sablin talked about was utopian drivel, nothing more. The truth is, you can't run an effective government on ideals alone. Though sometimes I think it wouldn't hurt if we reexamined how we approached certain issues..." Bessonov leaned forward. "It wouldn't, right? If only Comrade Yagoda would see it that way.""
 IRK.13.a: ""Perhaps we could figure something out?""
 IRK.13.b: ""An interesting discussion for sure, but alas, nothing can be done.""
 IRK.13.c: ""We should forget this conversation ever happened.""

 IRK.14.t: "The Order of the Day"
 IRK.14.desc: "A hardened veteran of the West Russian War, the Presidium had sent the NKVD colonel Barazin on a mission. He was to organize the purges of reactionary elements in the newly conquered territories, a "Red Terror" of sorts.\n\nAs soon as he stepped out of the truck that had brought him to this isolated village, the colonel was greeted by a short yet strong-looking man. On his peasant hat were a crudely stitched hammer and sickle. The man's name was Nikolai Valentinov.\n\n"See, comrade, our village was ruled by a tyrant, a fascist, a reactionary! He ruled with an iron fist, hanging revolutionaries or anyone who opposed his rule, for that matter. However, when we learned of comrade Yagoda's offensive, we quickly took arms against the tyrant. We overthrew him and set up a provisional council. Hopefully, you see this as proof of our loyalty to the Revolution and the Presidium," said Nikolai.\n\n"The NKVD will surely note your village's courage, comrade," declared the colonel.\n\nNikolai, stretching out his hand, invited Barazin to walk to a shed nearby. Inside the hut, a man was handcuffed and attached to a radiator. He was the tyrant. Wearing a muddy tsarist uniform, the man was either asleep or unconscious. He had been beaten, probably by the crowd. Barazin took him by the shoulders and placed him on the back of the truck. The colonel shook hands with Nikolai and took off to another freed village."
 IRK.14.a: "There is no salvation for fascists."

 IRK.15.t: "Shuffling Things Around"
 IRK.15.desc: "This morning, the SovNarKom, also known as the Council of People's Commissariats, declared a significant reform of the current ministries. In light of the new struggle for the unification of the Far East, the Presidium has announced the addition of several seats to the SovNarKom, intending to maximize resource extraction and production efficiency. Key military and industrial sectors will get brand new ministries, including but not limited to railways, mines, and factories.\n\nThe other major news will concern the People's Commissariat of Defense, the central organ responsible for military affairs. Despite many glaring victories, our struggle for unification and liberation still struggles with some aspects of modern warfare. The main issue is the lack of decentralization between logistic and tactical officers on the field and the People's Commissariat for Defense. Despite seeming like a minor issue, this can cause significant problems in the heat of battle.\n\nIn order to combat this issue, the Presidium has given significant autonomy to the troops on the ground. Furthermore, the NKVD will also benefit from this, allowing it to organize operations on the ground more efficiently and quickly."
 IRK.15.a: "Efficiency, Efficiency, Efficiency"

 IRK.16.t: "Scorched Earth"
 IRK.16.desc: "In the entire building complex, only one light was open; it was Alexei Kosygin's office. While treating himself with a high-quality bottle of pre-war vodka, probably the best-tasting bottle of vodka in Siberia, the high-ranking bureaucrat was receiving reports from the East. Despite the late hour, Kosygin was attentive, reading every statistic.\n\nHowever, something wasn't right. The economic predictions from the territories of the East were far lower than what was estimated by economists just a few weeks before. And strange reports of factories being found burned to the ground, farms being burned while someone had put down all the livestock. These strange events weren't magic, the supernatural, or a cryptid. They were the fascists, the cursed hordes that we had defeated. Rather than abandoning their industry, they decided to destroy it when they retreated.\n\nThe reports were understandably very blurry. No one was sure which factories were rebuildable or which ones were a lost cause. Yet, Kosygin still kept on reading the reports. The expected economic gains from the East had dipped by 40%, now that the macabre methods of the Fascists had been discovered. Putting down a folder in the "Finished." pile, Kosygin reached for his vodka glass. Just a few seconds later, an aide came in and handed Alexei a new folder."
 IRK.16.a: "Kosygin felt a headache starting."

 IRK.17.t: "The Far Eastern Campaign"
 IRK.17.desc: "Genrikh Yagoda looked on with interest as his generals made plans on the large map that represented the Russian Far East. The base of the map itself was from the 1940's, and it had been hastily drawn over in marker to show what the Red Army believed to be the strategic situation. "As you can see, comrades, the fascists are divided and weak. We couldn't have asked for a better opportunity to strike." Field Marshal Lyushkov said as he gestured towards the enemy positions on the map, represented with lines of red marker. Lyushkov was not wrong. Intel on the situation farther east was not exactly ideal, but it all seemed to suggest that the fascist warlords were too busy squabbling amongst themselves to offer any serious resistance to an invasion. Yagoda, his attention still focused on the map, spoke up. "Lyushkov, how ready are our forces?" Lyushkov backed away from the map and turned to Yagoda. "As ready as they'll ever be, Comrade Yagoda."\n\n"Then I think, comrades, it is time to put our plans into motion. These fascist dogs have blighted Russia with their toxic presence for too long. It would bring me great pleasure to see them crushed like the vermin they are." Yagoda paused for a moment. "Remember that this is a very important step towards reunification, comrades. First we retake the Far East, then we liberate the rest of Russia and beyond. I will not accept failure, not when the fate of the Soviet Union still lies on the precipice." Yagoda's short speech would resonate heavily with all who heard. The next few months would see the lands of the Far East drenched in blood, and with a great deal of effort and a little luck, only the true heirs to the Soviet Union would remain standing once the smoke had cleared. Yagoda would make sure of that."
 IRK.17.a: "The road to victory will be paved with blood."

 IRK.18.t: "Administration"
 IRK.18.desc: "The road to Balivka was long and bumpy, but they had finally arrived. Inside the red truck were 4 NKVD officers and a man dressed in a suit and wearing a wool coat. This mysterious official was Sergei Rostoyev. A dry, quiet, and calculating man, Sergei was given straightforward instructions transmitted to him in a telegram, which he held in his hand.\n\n"VISIT BALIVKA. ESTABLISH CPSU CADRE AND CIVILIAN SOVIET ASSEMBLY," read the telegram\n\nSergei stepped out of the vehicle and went to meet some of the village's communists. There were about twelve of them, some old enough to have fought in WW2 and some so young that they didn't remember the war days. These men and women will become the new leader of the Balivka CPSU cadre.\n\nRostoyev's next job was to establish a village soviet. Luckily, he already knew whom to recruit. He walked to the giant industrial at the edge of town. This kombinat produced several types of products for the military and consumers. There, he invited about a hundred and twenty laborers to the soviets. The other eighty invites, he reserved for teachers, journalists, and scholars. His job was now done.\n\nHe briefly met the NKVD commissars to inform them of the new civilian administration and quickly hopped in the truck, ready to establish civilian control in another isolated village."
 IRK.18.a: "Normalcy returns to the Far East."

 IRK.19.t: "Against the Fascists"
 IRK.19.desc: "This scene was dreadfully familiar to Commissar Krukov. The distant thumping of artillery, the mud and dirt, the wide-eyed, terrified young souls looking to their commissar for guidance. The only notable difference here is that Krukov was the one being relied on.\n\n"I was just like you once, comrades. Shaking in my boots, wondering if I would live to see tomorrow. I was there when the fascist bastards invaded our motherland, and I was there when we almost sent them crawling back to their holes. I have seen what cruelties these fascists are capable of in victory, and I made a promise to myself to never allow such injustices to happen ever again." The commissar got up and stood in front of his men. He could feel the orator inside him taking over.\n\n"This is not just a war against those who have betrayed the people, but a war against to repulse the dark clouds of fascism that loom over everything we hold dear. It is not wrong to feel fear, but it is wrong to allow your fear to shape you. Think of your friends, your homes, your loved ones! Would you stand by as these fascist dogs march in to impose their murderous rule over them? Comrades, put your fear behind you and fill your hearts with rage! Build this anger within you and use it well when the time comes to send these murdering fascist bastards to an early grave!"\n\nKrukov's short speech was punctuated by fierce, passionate cheers from the men. For once, the commissar could see a fire burning in their eyes. Deep down, he wondered how many of them would still be alive after today."
 IRK.19.a: "Not one step back."

 IRK.20.t: "The Trial of Matkovsky"
 IRK.20.desc: ""Mikhail Matkovsky, leader of the Russian Fascist Party, you have been found guilty of the crime of treason against the Soviet Union and several thousand counts of murder. The court sentences you to the supreme penalty of execution by firing squad." Mikhail Matkovsky, now a ragged figure, still tried his best to maintain a somewhat dignified posture.\n\n"I understand." Those who were present noted that he seemed strangely calm and collected throughout the whole ordeal. In a few minutes, a single NKVD guard pulled Matkovsky by his collar and led him out of the courtroom.\n\nOnce they had reached the basement door, the guard knocked on the door to be let in. He sighed and stood in front of the door idly, wondering why they didn't just leave it open. The guard's thoughts were interrupted by a sharp blow to the side of his head. As the guard fell to the floor, Matkovsky scrambled to grab his keys. The guard was unable to react before Matkovsky had freed himself and made a run for it.\n\nWasting no time, he sprinted after Matkovsky, and soon the guard was joined by several of his comrades. The NKVD followed Matkovsky as he slipped into the men's bathroom, and they easily broke through the haphazard barricade he had made with his shackles. When they entered, the NKVD soldiers were immediately met with Matkovsky attempting and failing to open a locked window at the end of the bathroom stalls. Realizing he was trapped, Matkovsky gave up and turned to his pursuers.\n\nHe gave a defeated sigh, and called out to them. "Well, get on with it." The NKVD obliged, and several bullets struck Matkovsky in the chest. He slumped to the floor, and within seconds the fascist leader was dead."
 IRK.20.a: "Slippery bastard."

 IRK.21.t: "The Trial of Rodzaevsky"
 IRK.21.desc: ""Konstantin Rodzaevsky, leader of the Russian Fascist Party... y-you have..." The prosecutor struggled to get a word in as he attempted to announce the fascist demagogue's sentence. Rodzaevsky was practically foaming at the mouth throughout the entire trial, shouting unspeakable expletives and rude insinuations about the court's parentage.\n\n"You Bolshevik pigs think you can put me down?! I piss on your trial, you bastards!"\n\nThe prosecutor had run out of patience, and raised his voice to speak over Rodzaevsky's angered ramblings. "Oh, to hell with this! Guards, get this animal out of here and kill him already!"\n\nNearly half a dozen NKVD guardsmen converged on Rodzaevsky and began to drag him out of the court. The prisoner was hysterical and uncooperative the entire trip, and by the time they had reached the basement Rodzaevsky was still furiously ranting about Jews and Bolsheviks. The group abruptly stopped in the basement hall, and the commanding officer turned to his comrades.\n\n"Someone get me a rag or a handkerchief or something, we need to shut this idiot up." One of the NKVD then wandered off to find a suitable object, and soon returned with a cloth. As the soldier attempted to gag Rodzaevsky, however, the prisoner headbutted the soldier and began violently shaking and kicking. In this state, moving the prisoner was impossible. Rodzaevsky was in such a rage that he had nearly managed to overpower his captors, despite their numbers.\n\n"You are weak! I could take all of you Bolshevik sons of bi-" Before the verbal assault could continue, a bullet ripped through the side of Rodzaevsky's head and killed him instantly. The now-silent corpse of the infamous fascist leader slipped through the NKVD and flopped to the floor with a thud."
 IRK.21.a: "Well, that's that done."
 
 IRK.22.t: "The Trial of the False Tsar"
 IRK.22.desc: ""Mikhail II, false claimant to the long dead Russian throne, and staunch monarchist, you fully admit that you have betrayed the Revolution of Russia and are fully responsible for the deaths of every man the Soviet Union has lost on the battlefield. You have been proven to be guilty and are now sentenced to the supreme penalty - you will be shot."\n\nMikhail slowly nodded, his hands tied together and grabbed by the back of his neck by an NKVD commissar, forcing Mikhail to come with him, as he is led to the back room behind the court and down a flight of stairs. Mikhail was violently thrown down and he winced in pain, hitting the concrete floor and scrambling onto his knees, looking up at the agent.\n\nThe commissar prepared his revolver and spun the barrel, and made a motion with his finger for Mikhail to turn around, which he begrudgingly complied, tears forming in his eyes.\n\n"Do you have any last words, Mikhail?"\n\nMikhail gulped and softly sobbed to himself, looking down at the floor and closing his eyes tight, feeling the barrel of the gun nudged against the back of his head.\n\n"I-I... I just wan-..." Mikhail took a bit to cry some more, the NKVD commissar began to grew impatient, waiting for Mikhail to speak his final words, this was the end.\n\n"I just wanted to go back home... w-where I belong..."\n\nHe stayed there, on his knees with the gun still pointed at his head, without hesitation, the commissar pulled the trigger.\n\nJust like Nicholas II of the Romanovs, Mikhail was shot and killed, dropping to the floor with a bullet through his brain, bleeding out."
 IRK.22.a: "He finally became the Tsar he wanted, though not as imagined."

 IRK.23.t: "The Union Triumphant!"
 IRK.23.desc: "The room was silent. The podium atop the stage was empty, and the flags behind stood firm, the glorious red banner, the flag of the revolution that reminded the Far East of who Irkutsk were: The Soviet Union, in its purest form.\n\nThe room somehow went even more silent as Yagoda walked up on stage, and stood behind the podium, adjusting the microphone slightly, before beginning to speak.\n\n"Comrades, soldiers of the Revolution, everyone under the Soviet Union! Today is a glorious day for the people of the Far East in Russia, as we have fully liberated the region and its inhabitants from their shackles. The power of the people has been shown to be triumphant over all others, and the Union stands, with its red banner flying high above all others!"\n\nThe soldiers of the Soviet Army gathered around the hall came to clap, and slowly, the crowd cheered in celebration, at first, comrades embracing each other, proud of their victory.\n\n"It is time! Go out! Drink! Party! It is a time of celebration, the day the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, finally returns to the world stage, where it rightfully belongs! We have shown the Revolution triumphant once more!"\n\nPeople began to cheer louder, applause growing in volume and the occasional cheer for Yagoda himself, but the soldiers stomped their boots onto the cold, wooden floor to remind everyone to keep quiet for now and to let the leader speak.\n\n"But that is not the end of our liberation of Russia, my comrades! Soon, we will march West, we will stomp out any fascists, any monarchists, and anyone who does not support the revolution, this is only the beginning! For now, it is time to party! Go, and be free!"\n\nThe people cheered once more, louder than ever, as bottles of vodka and other liquor were popped open and people drank wildly, stumbling out into the streets to party. It was truly a day to experience.\n\nYagoda couldn't help but crack a smile as he watched the people cheer for him, and for the Soviet Union."
 IRK.23.a: "Next stop - the West!"

 IRK.24.t: "The Fall of the Premier"
 IRK.24.desc: "Yagoda had never felt so powerless inside his own government anymore. For years, few had dared to challenge his authority, much less people from within the regime. Yet, now he watched in amazement as, in what was perhaps the first meeting of the Presidium where it was not a simple rubber stamp, the power of the NKVD was questioned.\n\nThe decree had been proposed from an anonymous member of the only executive body in Eastern Siberia. Knowing that they would have been effortlessly targeted and "persuaded" by the NKVD, whoever was behind this plan was careful not to reveal their identity, at least before the document had been presented to all Presidium members. For Yagoda, it was too late now - he knew all the deputies and their inclinations better than most, and the outcome of this vote was certain.\n\n"Who is in favor of the dismissal of Yakov Saulovich Agranov as the Premier of the USSR?"\n\nAlmost everyone raised their hands. The hesitant few who did not out of fear soon changed their minds, making the result of the vote, besides two persons, unanimous. One was Yagoda, still not eager to idly follow the wishes of the Party; as for the other, it was Agranov himself. The Presidium had taken advantage of a temporary absence of his in order to initiate this vote without his knowledge. Yagoda was aware that the presence of every single deputy was not necessary to pass a decree - a loophole that had proven extremely useful in the past, but had come back to bite him. Having been left with no other choice, he slowly raised his hand in approval.\n\n"Effective immediately, Comrade Agranov is dismissed of his duties by order of the Presidium, to be replaced by Sergey Alexeyevich Bessonov as Premier of the USSR." No longer was Yagoda's right-hand man in power. He had lost. At last, the Party was in control."
 IRK.24.a: "How the tables have turned."

 IRK.25.t: "The Party Shackled"
 IRK.25.desc: "The guards stood by the door of the room menacingly, the gun allegedly for self-defense apparent and the NKVD badge shining on their uniforms. In a loud voice, Yagoda exclaimed what the new proposed decree would entail to the Presidium's deputies.\n\n"By order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the following actions will be taken to ensure the safety and the prosperity of the Union: Firstly, the offices of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Premier of the Soviet Union shall be merged. The current General Secretary, Genrikh Yagoda, will assume the duties of Premier while maintaining his current position and powers as General Secretary. Secondly, any votes held on the potential dismissal of Premier Yakov Agranov will be deemed as ineffective, owing to his missing at the time of the alleged decision. Comrade Konstantin Chernenko shall thus be instated as Commissar of Foreign Affairs, while Comrade Bessonov will be indefinitely removed of his current position."\n\nThe same faces that so recently were brave enough to stand against Yagoda and his closest allies in the Presidium's session now seemed obedient and almost terrified. No one dared to respond, they all simply stayed quiet. It was once again the director of the NKVD who had to break the silence.\n\n"May I assume everyone approves the decree?" There was no answer. "Then it is in effect from now on."\n\nNot a single deputy had opened his mouth since Yagoda had described the plan to revert the revealed plots of the Party's officials, whose grand plan to climb to power had been shattered in minutes. The new Foreign Minister, the General Secretary's man, was allowed to enter the room again. As for Bessonov, he was escorted out by the two guards. Needless to say, he was not to be seen again by his comrades, at least within the walls of the Supreme Soviet."
 IRK.25.a: "The secret police always comes out on top."

 IRK.26.t: "The Return of the Soviets"
 IRK.26.desc: "Just a few years ago, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet's administration hardly extended past the city limits of Irkutsk. That is until General Secretary Yagoda liberated a full third of our Union from the bandits, fascists, traitors, and clerics that occupied it. Our status as the true revolutionary Vanguard of the Soviet people has been affirmed as all other threats in the Far East have been stomped out under the march of history. The Russian proletariat can rest assured that the true heirs to Lenin and Bukharin shall restore the glory and freedom which they lost to the Nazi menace.\n\nBut our work is still unfinished. There are still many menaces to the West who we must deal with. Having grown beyond the status of a warlord, we are now a fully functioning state and must develop our nation accordingly. We will have to make great investments into bringing our country up to the standards of the developed nations of the world, and we will now be able to take on a national debt in order to finance our expansion.\n\nOur people cry out for help, and the restoration of our Union awaits them. From this point on, we will take not one step eastward!"
 IRK.26.a: "For Soviet Russia!"

 IRK.27.t: "The Union Marches Forward"
 IRK.27.desc: "As yet another Presidium meeting concluded and the members, regardless of committee, dispersed, all felt that a sense of calm and routine had returned to the Union.\n\nThere were many reasons for this, and had one asked around they would have heard different opinions from different people. Some would say that the resolution of the long-held struggle between cliques of Party and state officials had finally brought internal stability and consolidation. Others said that the reunification of the Far East had proved the legitimacy of the Presidium's construction, and had allowed for a true proletarian nation to once again emerge.\n\nWhatever the true reason, none could deny that the state was a far cry from that of only a few years prior. Internal divisions had been removed. Lands had been acquired. Economic and social activities were increasing. Foreign relations were being established. And, providing the means by which all this had been accomplished, the Red Army stood as a modern, professional, experienced, and deadly force.\n\nThere would be many more challenges and tribulations in the future, those who thought about such things knew, but they would be overcome. The people, the government, and the state would act in unison, to return the promise of true socialism to all in Russia.\n\nFor the Union marches forward. Forever."

 IRK.28.t: "The Successes of the Past"
 IRK.28.desc: "The past twenty years have been a true hell for Russia and all her children, and besides the recent meteoric rise of our legitimate Politburo, there has been precious little to celebrate. That is not to say, however, that Russia has always been languishing under a dark cloud-- the era of Nikolai Bukharin was a true time of milk and honey, an era where the agricultural serf was becoming the industrial proletariat under the protective watch of Bolsheviks rather than the avarice-blinded capitalists. As we seek to alter our economic policy to fit the tumultuous world of the 1960s, we must turn our eyes to the past and recall what made Bukharin's economy so uniquely successful and innovative.\n\nHis staunch defense (and continuation) of Lenin's New Economic Policy tells us that it is necessary to build up the productive forces of the nation before entering a phase of true socialism. His bold Siberian Plan continues to pay dividends even in this era of anarchy and opportunist warlords, teaching us that we must industrialize even the most rural regions of Russia. His aversion to the collectivisation programs encouraged by some in the Left Opposition shows us that we must not allow ideology to prevent us from pursuing every economic opportunity available.\n\nAs Russians, as Soviets, as socialists, and as members of the Politburo, we are Bukharinists one and all, and proud thereof! As the Soviet Union is reborn by our hand, we must (and shall) adapt a truly Bukharinist model to the needs and wants of the new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and create an economy strong and productive enough to establish socialism no later than 2050!"

 IRK.29.desc: "As the Red Army marched below the balcony, celebrating its recent triumphs in the state's campaigns of unification, the ranking officials who stood upon it knew that monumental decisions were fast approaching. Ones critical to the future.\n\nWhether civilian or military, all were aware of the struggles for control between state factions, and whatever the status of that struggle might be in the civilian government, it had not yet been determined within the Red Army itself. On one side of the argument stood the NKVD who, as some of the only loyal forces who had accompanied the Presidium to Irkutsk during the evacuation, claimed that they should be increasingly militarized, to serve as the loyal core of a future army.\n\nOn the other side stood the professional military apparatus of the Red Army itself. They countered strongly by reiterating that they had remained loyal during the Sablinite rebellion, and cast doubt on the combat capability of the NKVD, claiming that to restructure the military to accommodate them would lead to an enormous decrease in both tactical and strategic performance.\n\nNone knew what the outcome of this argument, already underway among the highest echelons of government, would be. But they did know that, in the coming days, they were sure to find out."

We will bring about the re-liberation of all the Union, the destruction of the fascist jackboot on our people and freedom for all mankind in a socialist world.\n\nHowever this task will not be an easy one.

Although they do not ask for formal recognition as the USSR's successor state, the continuity they possess with the old Soviet government makes it an ideal candidate for support from us and makes them a likely candidate for Soviet reunification, and for a potentially powerful ally which can properly face the fascist menace in Europe."

 IRK.38.desc: "This morning a radio broadcast traced to Irkutsk was received from a local Soviet successor state known as the Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic. This state, led by former head of the NKVD Genrikh Yagoda apparently has numerous continuities in policies and personnel with the old Soviet government, which lends itself an air of legitimacy in the chaotic wake of its collapse. The Irkutsk government wishes to open up relationships with us in the hopes that they can serve as a friendly power in Siberia."
 IRK.38.a: "Interesting..."

 IRK.39.t: "An Embassy for Yagoda?"
 IRK.39.desc: "We have received another radio broadcast from the Far East SSR, this time requesting recognition as a sovereign nation and the opening of an embassy in Tokyo. They say formal relations between us and them will be of great benefit to Japan, as despite the fact that they are a radical communist regime, they too oppose Germany and are willing to secure the region in the name of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. With further aid and support, they could potentially unify Siberia and even Russia under a single state friendly to our interests."
 IRK.39.a: "We must think pragmatically in such hard times."
 IRK.39.b: "We have no interest in supporting a petty communist warlord."

 IRK.40.t: "The Japanese Empire Accepts!"
 IRK.40.desc: "We have received excellent news by radio from Tokyo: the Japanese government received our requests for diplomatic recognition, but they will also accept the emissaries we send to them to discuss the possibilities of cooperation against Germany and to build a secure bloc in Siberia. A suitable building has been found in the suburbs of Tokyo that can serve as an embassy, and the Japanese government will be sending aircraft to transport our diplomats there shortly."
 IRK.40.a: "A red sun rises over Asia."

 IRK.41.t: "The Japanese Empire Refuses!"
 IRK.41.desc: "Terrible news was received by radio from Tokyo: the Japanese government refused to recognize us as a sovereign nation, nor will they accept any envoys from us. In their broadcast, they claimed we were "communist tyrants" and "petty warlords that Japan has no interest in". No doubt the indoctrinated cultists of their Emperor were afraid of the spread of our socialist ideology and the possibility of a revolution among the working class across Asia if they were to support us."
 IRK.41.a: "It's a shame how reactionary ideology can blind people."
 
 IRK.42.t: "The Revolution Lives!"
 IRK.42.desc: "We have received a radio broadcast from Irkutsk in Siberia from a socialist regime known as the Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic. This state is led by the former head of the NKVD, Genrikh Yagoda. While they boast the same policies and even government ministers as the old Soviet government, it also unsurprisingly appears that the NKVD plays a large role in Far Eastern society, with the police state and surveillance being extensive. Yagoda claims this is a temporary measure to preserve socialism in the state, and that he will lessen the NKVD grip on society once the situation stabilises; however, the question of whether to support an extensive police state with ties to the old Soviet government remains."
 IRK.42.a: "Out of the depths of Siberia, the Union returns!"
 IRK.42.b: "A despot with delusions of socialism."

 IRK.43.t: "Back in the ASSR"
 IRK.43.desc: "Imperialism is merely capitalism in decay, wrote Lenin, and the imperialistic conflict between nations is nearly as important as the class struggle. To this end, Lenin created the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics so that even small nationals can express the right of self-determination within the Russian Federative Soviet Republic.\n\nNevertheless, as our borders expand and more ethnic minorities are incorporated within them, the question of whether or not the existing laws on the autonomy of the ASSRs are sufficient has been increasingly raised. The conservative faction claims that the autonomy they exhibit currently (that is, the ability to draft a constitution within the bounds of the national constitution) are enough; critics believe that more autonomy, particularly when it comes to economics, must be given to them to minimize the economic exploitation of these ethnic minorities by the central government."
 IRK.43.a: "We must preserve and expand the rights of minorities wherever possible!"
 IRK.43.b: "There is no exploitation in the USSR!"

 IRK.44.t: "Socialist Realism"
 IRK.44.desc: "This morning, Yagoda announced by radio the expansion of "cultural protection" measures, intended to "protect the working class from reactionary influence". Claiming that "it is not yet the time to allow the propagation of reactionary ideals in society", Yagoda said, "the NKVD will continue its duties of minimizing the workers' exposure to them in the media."\n\nThe creation of a new "Bureau of Socialist Media" was announced in the speech, where new films, books and other forms of media publications will be screened by NKVD agents before public release to ensure "reactionary" and "bourgeois" content is kept to a minimum, which the government believes could potentially indoctrinate the working class with counterrevolutionary ideas. Yagoda also added that artworks like posters, painting and sculptures will need to be registered with the Bureau as well.\n\n"Although these measures may seem harsh, these are necessary to preserve socialist freedoms in a world surrounded by capitalists, reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries who seek to undermine and destroy the workers' paradise from within," he concluded."
 IRK.44.a: "Great are the burdens to be endured for socialism."

 IRK.45.t: "The Cultural Revolution"
 IRK.45.desc: "In a speech delivered in the Tikhvin Gostinodvorskaya Square, Yagoda has announced the beginnings of a new sponsorship program supporting the arts.\n\n"Socialism is the liberation of man from the economic chains that bind him," Yagoda said to the crowd assembled in the city square, "And it is only under socialism that man will finally be free to express himself without being bound by market demand!"\n\nThe new cultural program unveiled by Yagoda this afternoon is extensive. Starting from the next fiscal year, the state will be granting endowments to painters, authors, filmmakers and other artists, with particular focus on socialist realist art that can be easily accessed and understood by the working class in the form of sculptures, murals and films glorifying the struggle of the proletariat from 1917 onwards. A new Museum of Socialist Art is also in the planning stages, which will showcase the best pieces of Soviet artwork to the world."
 IRK.45.a: "The flower of socialist culture blossoms!"

 IRK.46.t: "A New Proletarian Patriotism"
 IRK.46.desc: ""Good evening, comrades," said the voice over the crackly radio. "We will be departing from our previous programming in this time slot from now on. Comrade Yagoda has wisely concluded that these prime hours should be filled with inspirational messages about our beloved motherland. To that end, we have one of the finest Soviet actors in the studio with us tonight to read a war-era poem which is most dear to our Russian hearts. Vasily Alexeyvich, if you would."\n\nThe young actor began reading out loud. His voice came in beautifully over the airwaves. Listeners in taverns paused their conversations to incline their ears.\n\n"Because we are Russian, just fire and destruction\nAre all we abandon behind as we go.\nAnd fighting beside us, our comrades are dying\nAnd we Russians only die facing their foe.\n\nAlyosha, till now we've been spared by the bullets.\nBut when (for the third time) my life seemed to end,\nI yet still felt proud of the dearest of countries,\nThe great bitter land I was born to defend."\n\nEven the most jaded of listeners felt a fire stirring in their hearts at these old words brought to life. Some of the younger ones even began to consider enlisting in the Red Army themselves. If the people were not in love with their Motherland before, they were passionately so now."
 IRK.46.a: "Remember, Alyosha, the roads of Smolenshchina."

 IRK.47.t: "Like a Thief in the Night"
 IRK.47.desc: "Major Scherbina carefully looked over his notes. The family matriarch had ratted out the family patriarch for previous membership in the Russian Fascist Party. The patriarch had denounced his own son for listening to bootleg Western records. The son, in turn, had denounced his mother for prostitution, a parasitic form of non-labour income. The Major shook his head.\n\n"Your orders, Comrade Major? Over," said the squad leader over the radio. His NKVD agents were in place to breach the door on the family's apartment. They just needed final confirmation on who they would apprehend.\n\n"Take the three of them. Put them in separate cells when you get here. I'll have my boys at the office type up something for each of them to sign. You know which methods to use if they refuse. And one more thing..."\n\n"Yes, Comrade Major? Over."\n\n"At least try and take them alive this time. Comrade Yagoda would hate for us to have wasted valuable paper. Over."\n\n"Of course, Comrade Major.""
 IRK.47.a: ""Over and out.""

 IRK.48.t: "The Good Life"
 IRK.48.desc: "It had been a good year for Ivan Grachyov. By working for Goskomtsen, the State Committee on Prices, he knew the legal price of every single item in the Soviet Union. And ever since General-Secretary Yagoda had raised his and every other civil servant's salary, he'd been able to afford much more of those items. His dinner table never lacked meat, and his new car was never out of gas.\n\nThe car was his proudest purchase. Even with his new salary, he'd had to save up to afford it. And then there was the waiting list and all the hoops he'd had to jump through to even get an American car imported into Siberia. But by New Years, he was the proud owner of a new Ford.\n\nThat New Years Eve, he decided to show it off to all his coworkers at Goskomtsen. He revved the engine and did donuts in the front yard. Then he invited his favorite colleague to go on a ride down the streets of Irkutsk. It was frowned upon by the police, but he'd earned this. Yagoda himself had approved his salary, it's time he lived well and fast for once.\n\nPity he'd also spent a bit of that new salary on fine, imported cognac that night."
 IRK.48.a: "Such is the price of luxury."

 IRK.49.t: "The Termination"
 IRK.49.desc: "Goznak executive Igor Ganayev had gone into his annual performance review expecting it to be a piece of cake. Toot his own horn a bit, slip the HR man a fifth of fine brandy, share some cigarettes and call it a day. But when he walked into the office and saw a man in a blue-topped peaked cap sitting at the desk, all the color drained from his face.\n\n"Comrade Ganayev, our investigations have found significant discrepancies between throughput figures at the Dukat and Kubaka silver mines and the amount of minted silver bullion that your ministry deposits into our reserves each month. The discrepancies first emerged when you received your executive post. How do you account for this?"\n\nIgor tried to think on his feet. He blamed the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metallurgy. He blamed the Mafia. He blamed German spies. He deflected to anyone he could. None of it seemed to faze the NKVD agent at the desk. All he did was sigh, shake his head, and take notes in his little book. Eventually, he put up his hand to silence Igor and spoke up.\n\n"Comrade Ganayev, your guilt was determined prior to our meeting. My inquiry here was simply to see whether or not you could provide us the names of your co-conspirators. Unfortunately, you have seen fit to waste the People's Commissariat's time with your evasive drivel. So let me be frank with you, Comrade."\n\nThe agent leaned in closer.\n\n"If you have stolen the People's silver, we will fill you with the People's lead.""
 IRK.49.a: "Performance unsatisfactory. Employee terminated."

 IRK.50.t: "Behind Closed Doors"
 IRK.50.desc: "Voroshsky took a bottle of vodka and two glasses down from the shelf. He turned to address his guest. "The boy was a traitor, and the Union cannot tolerate traitors. We did what was necessary to defend the revolution, as difficult as it might have been"\n\n"Of course I agree with you, Comrade Voroshsky" Yaktorovich replied. "Sablin was a traitor and his revolutionaries behaved like bandits, and when dealing with bandits there can be only one response. I am simply saying that while he was unquestionably misguided, his heart might have been in the right place."\n\nVoroshsky poured the vodka into both glasses and slid one across the table. "Perhaps. Raw idealism leads to disaster as Sablin made clear to us all, but when it is tempered and channeled into the right directions it can certainly be a potent force, something we have lacked as of late."\n\nYaktorovich eagerly grabbed his drink. "Exactly! I'd certainly prefer a little revolutionary zeal to the cynicism that we have endured under Comrade Yagoda's rule. Sometimes I forget that we are still fighting the liberation of the proletariat. All I do most days is file paperwork and review documents. It feels like we lost our souls somewhere along the line."\n\nVoroshsky gulped the vodka down and began pouring himself another. "I'll tell you where we lost them, Comrade Yaktorovich. We lost them when we fled Moscow. Bukharin, for all his many flaws, was a true disciple of Lenin's word. So was Sablin, for that matter. The boy might have been an idiot but he read his theory. Yagoda lacks dedication to the revolutionary cause. He saw a chance at power, and he took it, and now here we are."\n\nYaktorovich grinned. "You have to be careful what you say, Voroshsky. I could turn you in for uttering such things."\n\nVoroshsky chuckled "You could, but then I'd have to tell the NKVD about all the traitorous things you start to mutter when you're deep in your cups."\n\n"Fair enough" Yaktorovich raised his glass. "To mutually assured destruction. "\n\n"Cheers.""

 IRK.51.t: "Down With the Old"
 IRK.51.desc: "It was over. The jig was up.\n\nAfter everything his career had endured Vasily Sukhostsky almost couldn't believe that he had been undone by a bureaucratic shakeup. He had survived the flight from Moscow, the Siberian war, Sablin's rebellion, and the reunification of the east. Through all the trials and tumult the Union had endured he had served his post as the Undersecretary of Revolutionary Education, collecting a generous paycheck for his service while working as little as he was required to. He used to fear that his relaxed attitude towards his work might one day earn him the bullet or the noose, but eventually he'd come to see that his superiors didn't want ambitious and motivated men in the government. They wanted men like Vasily, who were looking to do as little as it took to live comfortably in an uncomfortable world. For almost three decades Vasily had thrived within this cult of mediocrity, content in the certainty that he would be collecting his paycheck until he died. It seemed the new bosses weren't as happy with that idea as Vasily was, as evidenced by the pink slip that now sat on his desk.\n\nIn the coming days Vasily heard from many of his coworkers who had experienced the same thing. No warning or hint that anything is amiss, and then suddenly one day the job you've held since 1938 isn't yours any more. Some of his comrades were righteously angry at their dismissal, insisting that they could never be replaced, that the Union was doomed without them. It was mostly hot air. The old men who now spent most of their days crowded into bars complaining to each other were not the type to give their life to the revolution. Vasily had spent three decades working twelve hour weeks and hadn't completed a single major project or initiative in the last ten years. His comrades were no different. Deep down, Vasily knew they deserved to be fired.\n\nDamn if he wouldn't miss the paycheck though."
 IRK.51.a: "Perhaps he should have shown more initiative."
 
 IRK.52.t: "Up with the New"
 IRK.52.desc: "The office was not as large as Boris had hoped, and there were no windows either, which didn't help with the oppressive aesthetic that characterized the entire building. It would have to do. Boris was not here for a nice office or a good view of Irkutsk. He was here to revitalize the Soviet school system. The last Undersecretary of Revolutionary Education had allowed the Union's schools to fall into stagnation, and thousands of children had been given inadequate educations as a result. Boris was going to put a stop to it. His head was already spinning with ideas and plans of how he would rebuild the Union's schools.\n\nThe first step would be creating a new generation of textbooks, covering everything from the sciences to Russian history. As far as Boris was aware, there hadn't been a new educational text published in Russian since the Great Patriotic War, meaning that any school lucky enough to have textbooks was relying on information that was 30 years old at best. After the textbooks had been printed he could begin organizing a nationwide initiative to train and hire more teachers. After that the foundations would be laid for his most ambitious plans. New schools, both primary and secondary, would open in every city and town across eastern Siberia, heralding a new age of revolutionary schooling and societal progress. Perhaps even a new university to serve as the crowning achievement, or even...\n\nA knock at the office door broke Boris out of his daydreaming. He saw his assistant had returned with a tower of boxes containing the documents and records that Boris needed. Sorting through them all would take all night. Boris sighed, grabbed a box, and dug in. Before he could enjoy the glamour and perks of this job he would have to earn them. "Oh well," he thought. "Millions have given their lives to the Union. The least I can offer it is my time.""

The Yagodashchina 一 the long years of political repression carried out by the former NKVD chief 一 is a distant memory, with the orthodox Bukharinist wing of the party firmly back in control of the government. On the ground, people breathe a little easier, as the previously omnipresent NKVD units seemingly disappear from street corners and their imprisoned relatives slowly trickle back from the camps. In the halls of power, bureaucrats rejoice at their luck; the blue-capped reaper has been forever exorcised, and they are no longer the securocrats' hostages.\n\nThe party's historians are hard at work cataloguing and decrying the previous administration's abuses (though perhaps not the ones the new authorities were complicit in). Reams of documents and posters praising Yagoda are quietly destroyed; statues of him, many erected triumphantly only months ago, come down in favor of more palatable statues of Lenin, Marx, or Bukharin.\n\nYagoda's supporters may lament the party coup as a betrayal of socialism and unity, but to the rest of the population his ouster is met with a cautious welcome. It may be the Soviet successor Yagoda built, but without him many believe his ouster is proof that the party can take a kinder path. Those who partook in the revolt have another question to ponder: Valery Sablin is dead, but perhaps he got what he wanted, in the end."

 IRK.54.desc: "Pavel had counted and recounted, then recounted one more time just to make sure, and he could not deny reality any longer. There were 50 IFVs in the vehicle depot he was responsible for. To most people this would not seem like an issue. They would make the count, record the number, and move on with their lives. But Pavel was not most people. He took his job as a logistics officer seriously, and this depot was his number one priority. Nothing came in or out of it without him making a record of it. Except now something had, because this week he counted 50 IFVs and last week there were only 45.\n\nThere were more MBTs as well, but that did not concern him. He had seen the truck that brought them in, signed off on the paperwork, and told the driver here he could find a good drink in the nearest town. He had expected 38 MBTs, but he could not explain the five extra IFVs and that bothered him. Where had they come from? Why were they here? Had they been sent here on accident, or had someone forgot to tell him about a delivery? Pavel was going to get answers.\n\nHe burst into the depot guard's office, startling the guard on duty there. "Comrade, I need to see the records from the last week at once please."\n\nThe guard looked at Pavel for a moment before speaking "I'm sorry Comrade Sergeant but I can't give them to you. I've been ordered not to allow anyone to see those records."\n\n"By who?" Pavel bellowed. "I have authority over this depot! It is my responsibility!"\n\n"I'm sorry Sergeant but they ordered me not to say anything. I didn't get their IDs anyway. They just told me their ranks and I let them do what they wanted."\n\n"Private, are you aware we have five extra IFVs in the lot right now?" Pavel hissed.\n\n"Wait, we have a surplus?

"General Secretary" Yagoda now, he was called. A sigh left his mouth for what was the sixth time today, as he thought about how things were becoming.\n\nTraffic was terrible, and the NKVD checkpoints were stifling as always. By the time he had finally made it to the Presidium, he had decided - something needed to be done. Even if Yagoda had eyes everywhere, even if he only grew stronger by the day, he needed to do something. But first, he needed to rally the others.\n\n...After he got past the guard at the door, who kept looking at him and shaking his head, while blocking his path. "Comrade Bessonov, while your service to the Union has been faithful and an admirable example, I cannot let you pass." Sergey blinked. "And just why not?" He asked as the officer blinked, confused.\n\n"Comrade, you were promoted to the Bureau of Agricultural Advisory. Another representative has been selected..." Sergey barely heard the rest; was that why he hadn't been informed of the meeting? A promotion. He had been "promoted", as had the others no doubt. Funneled off, moved out of power, and shuffled to where they could not even touch him. Where the thought of Sergey Bessonov moving against Genrikh Yagoda wasn't just laughable, it was nonexistent.\n\nAnd so, as Sergey Bessonov began to sob, and the guard confusedly looked around unsure of what to do, the General Secretary gave a single passing, small smile from the window before striding into the chamber of the Presidium, not even bothering to glance back at the entrance."

Desk drawers were pulled open, files were leafed through, and people were questioned in droves. And above it all two men stood firm; Nikolai Golubev, a giant of a man with enough feats to his name to make him noteable, even if he seemed to have nothing but indifference to many of his superiors, and Anatoly Denisov, a thin officer who was once a very ideological commissar.\n\nTwo cousins, bound together by the order of Genrikh Yagoda for a single investigation regarding missing funds. And so far, both had not found much yet. "You're certain you have no recollection of where these missing funds have gone." Nikolai spoke calmly, as he eyed a brief set of files. "Does this imply incompetence on your part, or does this imply a colleague's responsibility?"\n\n"Well," the Bureaucrat began, after a brief gulp. "I'm fairly certain I saw Gennady skulking around -" Anatonly raised a hand, cutting him off. "Comrade, Gennady stated he saw you skulking around in the evening; in fact, he promptly filed a report implicating you as a suspect instead of waiting until now to divulge this. Tell me, why would you wait to divulge such crucial suspicions until you were filed into a room for questioning?"\n\nA brief pause filled the air, as Nikolai looked up from his files pointedly. "My colleague asked you a question." He boredly stated, as the burecrat slowly looked to them - then the door. For a moment, he looked like he was going to attempt to run.\n\nThis moment ended when a pistol was whipped against the side of his face, while Nikolai reached to a small bag at the side of his chair, withdrawing tools.

I recognize that you have every right to be angry with me for a single moment of weakness. However, I have repented entirely from my heinous actions. You may doubt, you may disbelieve, but I initially took the funds to be used elsewhere, to benefit the Union in different departments.\n\nI see however, that my idealism did not bear the fruit I had thought I would sow. Instead, I entered into a den of ruffians, corrupt monsters, and those who would seek to bring the revolution astray. Thankfully, two brave and intrepid investigators aided in my repentance with a brief visit to my home, in which I realized how far I had been led astray.\n\nTo ask for forgiveness is a challenge, though I offer this. In exchange for amnesty, I will fully cooperate and give the names and addresses of those I know who are involved in the den of bourgeoise corruption. I will retire from my life within Irkutsk, and promise to cause no further trouble in future years.\n\nI thank you General Secretary, for your never ending benevolence and understanding, and await your reply."

"Report." The General Secretary spoke, as two voices jostled for position. "Comrade Yagoda, the raids have been a stunning success! All the conspirators have been arrested or dealt with, and-"\n\n"Anatoly, shut up and let me talk to the General Secretary." The other voice spoke, as a brief bit of murmuring between the two was heard. "Right, Nikolai reporting. We have three dead conspirators, one dead officer, two injured officers. One attempted to flee and was shot, one attempted to kill the men sent to investigate him, and the Junior Lieutenant thought that the third conspirator had nothing to say."\n\n"He was reaching for a gun." Anatoly muttered across the line, as Genrikh sighed.

Anatoly replied with such noise and zeal that for a moment, Yagoda almost imagined the thin man was giving a salute in the middle of wherever they were standing. "I will expect your full report tomorrow." He murmured, as he hung up.\n\nAnd so the General Secretary retired for the evening, while in the distance Nikolai Golubev looked at his partner and gave him a slap.

It could be books, it could be films, it could be anything the Japanese were making.\n\nAnd it was all jotted down on a single, small little paper list that was placed down on his desk every morning. Sometimes it was simply a copy, while other times it was a new one. By this point, every day was the same to Armen - he'd wake up, eat breakfast, bid a goodbye to his wife, go to work, and return home in the late hours of the night.\n\nA cog. That's what he was. A simple gear in the apparatus of state, working day and night for a pension he never seemed to have the time to use. More items were labeled, more items were censored, and the list always arrived at his desk. His wife tried to understand, and he and his coworkers occasionally went out for drinks, but he would always find himself at this desk, accepting orders from above and relaying them down below with little fanfare. An easily replaceable cog, if he stepped out of line- some of his coworkers had already vanished and been replaced.\n\nPerhaps Irina and him should take a vacation - a single brief respite. He owed it to her, after all. Yes. As he lay in his bed for the evening, his wife asleep on the other end, he realized a vacation was exactly what they needed. Tomorrow, when he was done with his shift, he would ask for time off.

Such a system naturally eroded public confidence in the socialist ideal of equal justice, and encouraged corruption besides. No longer.\n\nAt the personal insistence of General Secretary Yagoda the entire system is to be professionalized. Strict guidelines for required qualifications will be developed, systems of licensing examined and overhauled, if necessary, and present officials found to be unqualified removed. In this fashion, the legitimacy of Soviet justice will be ensured, in the eyes of both the people and the world. The State must have a competent, effective, and unbiased socialist judiciary.\n\nAnd the State is, of course, what Genrikh Yagoda says it is."

Life under the guidance of General Secretary Yagoda had been better than one would expect. At the very least, Viktor could say that he was employed and his family was well fed.\n\nViktor took his position on the line and began the monotonous job of assembling artillery shells. Hours passed him by with little incident, and yet he could not help but think that something was different. It was a small thing, easily able to be missed on the line, but something was different.\n\nAfter another few hours he understood, the line had been going much faster than it had been before. A few words exchanged with his foreman cleared things up well. Apparently, as the foreman relayed to him, some of the inspection points had been eliminated in favor of a more efficient pace for production. He couldn't help but have mixed feelings about these new changes. As the day dragged on he felt like he was falling behind. At first, the new pace was easy to handle, but the further on the day went the worse he felt.\n\nAs he left the plant at the end of the day, he could not help but worry about the quality of some of his work."

 IRK.62.t: "The End of Yagoda"
 IRK.62.desc: "Ever since the Party and the Presidium had managed to outmaneuver him through their installation of Bessonov as Premier, Genrikh Yagoda had known that they would, eventually, try to remove him from his position as General Secretary. And yet, when it finally happened, even he was taken by surprise.\n\nThe early-morning meeting of the Central Committee had actually been called by Yagoda himself, intending to address a series of military and diplomatic incidents along the southern border with Manchuria. However, shortly after it had commenced, he found himself the victim of intense criticism by other members for his supposed 'encouragement of friction within the socialist framework.'\n\nHaving purged many opponents himself over the years, Yagoda knew immediately that he was finished, outmaneuvered yet again. The vote, unanimous of course and as required for a public showing of unity, was a formality. It was over. Still, and facing political oblivion, he found himself unable to stand from the table's head.\n\nHe was suddenly helped to his feet by the strong arms of two Red Army sergeants - no doubt called by Malik using a small device he could see attached to the inside of the man's jacket - and forcefully directed from the room.\n\nAs he was hustled into the central vehicle in a small convoy and driven out of the city at great speed, he could hear the radio announcing the appointment of Sergey Alexeyvich Bessonov as General Secretary, to be replaced with Alexei Kosygin as Premier. That morning, he had been General Secretary Yagoda, and now he was only Comrade Yagoda, destined for internal exile in some remote town where he could do no harm, and be closely watched besides.\n\nHe supposed that he should be thankful. He would have been far less generous had positions been reversed."

 IRK.63.t: "The Rise of the Sovnarkhozy"
 IRK.63.desc: "For too long, the over-centralization and departmentalism of ministries within the Union has been allowed to continue, impeding both progress and efficiency. Perhaps nowhere has such impedance been more observed than in the economic sphere, and to address this the Central Committee has taken action.\n\nEffective immediately, economic direction over many of the Union's areas will be devolved to regional economic soviets, known colloquially as 'Sovnarkhozy.' These soviets will be given authority - within reason - to determine local economic and production goals, tailored to the particulars and relative resources of their province.\n\nThe decisions made by the sovnarkhozy, and the particulars resulting from them, will be consolidated by the central government. Analysis will be subsequently performed by the State Planning Committee, in order to ensure both more efficient economic planning and more realistic production goals year-over-year.\n\nAlthough basic need for the sovnarkhozy has been questioned by some who claim it an unneeded dilution of state authority, both local and national Party officials have made clear their their view of the individual sovnarkhoz as being 'wholly in tune with the socialist spirit of cooperation at all levels.'\n\nTime will tell if such devolution proves beneficial."

 IRK.64.desc: "Years later, Leonid Mikhailovich Morozov would remember the cool breeze blowing in off of Lake Baikal as he submitted his application to the Gosplan office in Irkutsk. An omen, he would say, accompanying his words with a slight smile.\n\nA man from a family of low standing and no influence, Morozov was one of the first graduates from the universities ordered re-opened, and available to all, by Party decree. When he had seen the advertisement - positions available for junior state planners - his father had told him not to bother. Such jobs went to men of connection, he had said, not men such as him.\n\nBut Morozov was a true believer in the inherent equality of socialism, and he would not be deterred. He wanted to serve his country and its citizens, and he knew he was capable of doing so.\n\nThe men who had controlled things for so long were not only old, they were, largely, not even from Siberia. Irkutsk was not Moscow, and Siberia was not Western Russia. The lands, the challenges, and the people were different, and the new Union required new administrators if it was to prosper and combat the reactionaries, despots, and occupiers that still held most of Russia in their grasp.\n\nWhen he returned home the evening after submitting his application package, having waited five hours in line to do so, and said as much, his father had only scowled. A waste of time, he was told. But as he went to sleep that night, Morozov felt certainty in his future. He would be given his opportunity.\n\nAfter all, the Party had promised equality."

 IRK.65.t: "The New Bureaucrat"
 IRK.65.desc: "To Leonid Mikhailovich Morozov, his first day of work at the Gosplan office in Irkutsk was one he knew he would remember.\n\nMet by a junior supervisor, he was quickly given his identification badge and shown around the office, and as they moved from room to room he could not but feel wonder. University had taught him that, apart from political reliability, little was more important to a state than its economy. And for the Union, that economy, down to the last sack of corn, was controlled from here.\n\nHe could tell, however, that he was not going to be welcomed by many. The looks that followed him from the senior planners told him as much. But he would not be intimidated. He had been taught in the Komsomol that change was always resisted by those who had accumulated power and, sadly, even once-committed socialists were not immune to perpetuating such resistance.\n\nWhen he was shown to his 'office,' a repurposed broom closet with little more than a rough-hewn desk, a mismatched chair, and a plastic telephone, he knew that those looks had been followed by deeds. But he would respond in kind.\n\nLooking at the stacks of graphs, reports, and production figures that had been stacked in the corner, he felt power run through him. He would learn the Union's economic anatomy. He would diagnose illness. And he would prescribe treatment. The Party demanded loyalty, yes, but it also required the competence that he possessed.\n\nIt was time to get to work."
 IRK.65.a: "A chance to prove himself."

 IRK.66.t: "The New Generation"
 IRK.66.desc: "Though Leonid Mikhailovich Morozov was a committed socialist, even he had doubts, buried deep within, that the Party would continue hiring graduates such as him for important organs of state. But, as he learned in short order, his doubts were unfounded.\n\nHe had not been in his position long before he started noticing a commonality among the other junior planners. Many were from his university. Or other similar ones. And all, including himself, were close in age. With them changed the atmosphere of the Gosplan office as a whole. Unlike the lethargy that had once dominated it, and had started to get to him once initial excitement had worn off, there was now a collective energy and drive that he was proud to be part of.\n\nProblems that had existed for years were solved through collective innovation. Production pipelines were optimized. Industries were integrated, horizontally and vertically. Workers were reassigned and relocated to maximize skill overlaps. Sources of waste, human or otherwise, were pursued, identified, and ruthlessly eliminated. And with every improvement, the overall projections improved. Things had begun to change, indeed.\n\nThe senior planners no longer looked at him and the other young arrivals with disdain. No, now they looked at them with fear. They knew that things were changing, that the Party had seen the value of bringing a new generation of administrators into the fold. And they knew that they would soon be swept away.\n\nMorozov looked forward to it."

The man - smooth-cheeked and plump - thrusts it out almost perfunctorily, "Ivan Volkhov, Citizen ID 7033434. Your internal passport."\n\nIvan looks back and him and takes it gingerly, the red star blazoned on the cover seeming to look at him. "So what's this, comrade?"\n\n"You travel frequently, Volkhov. The Party thought it best that you have priority for the IDs. No need to carry residential permits, metrika or travel permit, or worry about the wrong signature. This will do."\n\nIvan nods slowly, fingers closing around the passport as he grasps the door. "I... see. Thank you, comrade. This will make things easier."\n\n"Indeed. Freedom of movement, comrade.

Shouts ring out along the line as stamped assemblies make their way to the end, as the junior worker slowly, nervously polishes his glasses. "Belov will be after you. You need him to sign the passport."\n\n"Bullshit." A paper gets waved at him, cheap paper and strident language that of a public information leaflet. "I don't need an approval to stay. I don't need to watch another boy get maimed in those machines. I'm going to where the management gives a shit. Belov can eat it."\n\n"You're sure?"\n\n"Completely". The paper's passed over, "The government's allowing us to switch. Don't need more stamps in the passport. Just a visit to registry."

 IRK.69.t: "An Eye to Egalitarianism"
 IRK.69.desc: "Although the message of socialism is inherently egalitarian in theory, promising the emancipation of the common man - or woman - from oppression, too often it is not converted properly into practice. In a truly socialist state, this is unacceptable, and thus as another of the Party's many and varied reforms, this is now to be addressed.\n\nEffective immediately, and in keeping with the examples of women proudly serving beside their comrades at almost all levels of the armed forces, gender-based discrimination will no longer be permitted in any setting or workplace. Prominent Party figures, male and female, spoke across various forms of state media on the need for the initiative, and announced the commencement of a campaign to promote the newfound promise of true equality in all areas.\n\nThis campaign will include the identification of female Heroes of Socialist Labor, a campaign of awareness for the roles female soldiers can and do excel in within the armed forces, and the establishment of a committee to investigate possible bias in state communications.\n\nEquality exists within the vanguard of socialism, and the Party has proven its dedication to enshrining those ideals at all levels of society, in true Marxist-Leninist fashion."

 IRK.71.desc: "Ilya sat leisurely upon the tall red rock, an unbecoming sight for an NKVD officer. Perched upon an outcropping that emerged from the depths of Lake Baikal, he glanced back towards his neatly folded clothes on the shore. A younger Ilya would have been afraid to exhibit such lax behavior on duty, but the last few days had changed him immensely. A peace had come over the aging murderer, a peace he refused to vacate.\n\nHis eyes turned to the green waters before him, taking their time to meet the sunkissed horizon. Below it, he saw the faint outlines of Nerpa seals, unique little fishermen who frequently found themselves pestered by birds.\n\nIn many ways he related to the birds. He was, like them, a pest. While the people of Irkutsk city attempted to carve out lives in this Russian hell, Ilya harassed them. In his head sat thousands of words, snippets of conversations between lovers, friends, families. All of them were stolen, private snapshots of lives acquired via surveillance.\n\nUpon his hands there was much blood. Young and old, idealist and cynic, patriot and traitor. Each had met with Ilya's justice at one time or another.\n\nHe laughed quietly at the dramatic tone of his thoughts. What had made the Sablinites any different? The regret he felt now, the one that had seemingly turned him into an aspiring poet, was one he hadn't experienced in decades.\n\nPerhaps though, Ilya was the seal instead. A man haunted by his own pests, invisible to him for many years. The seal to a thousand lurking birds that had finally come home to roost.\n\nAs he stood up from the rock and began his long swim to shore, he made a decision. Ilya would not be returning to Irkutsk. All that had tied him to that place seemed shattered by whatever realizations the lake had bestowed. His duty was as faint as a distant cloud.\n\nSo it was that an NKVD veteran abandoned his duties, and set off for the Siberian wastes."

Training had consumed most of the day, but it was relatively calm compared to other days. As the bulk of today's training had wrapped up, the officers had sent Alexei to fetch some things from camp. Walking there, the 23 year old had tried to walk along the rocks like a child trying to keep their balance on a brick barrier.\n\nDigging his gloved hands into the snow behind him, the young soldier hauled himself into an upright position. Now, face red and battered by the bitter winds, he found himself staring out at Lake Baikal from its bank. Dusting snow off his coat, he kept his eyes on the horizon. "Couldn't hurt to sit here for a second." He argued, opening his satchel with a 'pop' and retrieving his cantine.\n\nAlexei watched the stars begin to shine brighter and the sky shift from purple to inky black over the course of 15 minutes. Just as he began to stand up, something white darted past his vision. Righting himself, his eyes followed the blur to the edge of the stones, where now a rabbit, white as the pure driven snow, munched on a plant struggling to grow in the frozen soil. Completely undisturbed by his presence, the bunny watched the clear lakewater.\n\nAlexei remembered his childhood pets, animals he had found out in the woods that his mother forced him to abandon. Hunching down, he produced his cantine once again and began pouring water into a small divet in the snow. Still undeterred by the larger creature's presence, the rabbit simply hopped over and began to drink peacefully. Glancing left and right, assuring there was no one watching him, the soldier scooped it up, opened back up his satchel with the same pop, and placed it in. Gripping the rocks, he scaled back over and began the walk back to camp, fully prepared to be chewed out by the brass."

That sounds like an anarchist to me," Alexander replied, not looking away from the empty tundra in front of him.\n\n"But they have an army, and I thought anarchists hate armies!

 IRK.74.desc: ""My calling is to the east, papa. I'm sorry."\n\nBoldyrev stared into his son. His face was hard as iron, his eyes a piercing blade. For the briefest moment, he did not know what to say.\n\nTen years he served Yagoda, ten years he had risen through the ranks of the NKVD. Blood stained his hands, but long had he rationalized it during sleepless nights; it was necessary. It was his duty. Before that, as a boy of just seventeen, he fought and bled for the Bolsheviks in the great civil war. He promised his life to the revolution, until the very end of his days.\n\nNow here was his son, about to betray the nation that Boldyrev had a hand in forging, with eyes that pleaded to his father; let me go. Let me fight for what is right.\n\nBoldyrev sighed, setting a hand upon his son's shoulder. "I was only a bit younger than you when I too bled for Lenin," he began. "In those days I asked myself one question every single night; was I fighting for the right side? What if I had made a horrible mistake?"\n\nHe shook his head, smiling. "I followed what my heart desired. I followed the passion that guided me, and it led me to the socialist revolution." Boldyrev swallowed, suddenly uneasy of what he was about to say. No matter who won this struggle, his words would doom him. "But cruel men corrupted it, my son. And they brought me down a path I should never have followed. I am old now, and my passion has dried."\n\nHis eyes met with his son's, and tears swelled. "Follow your heart, my son. Do what you believe is right, do not be constrained by old feeble men like me. But hold your comrades accountable, as I should have."\n\nHis son nodded, and the eagerness that filled his face was now mixed with longing. "I will, papa," he said. As he watched his son step out of the house and to Buryatia, Boldyrev feared that he had killed him. Yet he could not restrain his boy like he did to so many others; his fate was for himself to choose. Now, there was only one hopeless wish he had left."

It was way past curfew, and Sergei had been forced to sneak his way slowly through the abandoned streets of Severobaykalsk. Their father, a loving but stern man well respected within Yagoda's party, had died many years earlier. He had left both of his sons keys to the property, and they had come here often since his death to catch up and reminisce. Both of them knew this time was different. They both pulled up chairs and sat across from each other, and poured themselves tall glasses of vodka.\n\n"I know what you have called me here for Alexei," Sergei began, pre-empting his brother's plea. "You know what my answer will be."\n\n"Just hear what I have to say," he replied, his tone laced with sadness. "There is no way out of this for you rebels, Sergei. Yagoda is going to crush Sablin's little rebellion in a matter of weeks. If you walk away now, I can make sure that you don't end up in front of a firing squad."\n\n"Oh yes, I'm sure you will be able to use your position in the NKVD to get me off. But that represents everything that is wrong with Yagoda's regime Alexei. The NKVD runs rampant, crushing dissent, killing anybody in its path with impunity, its agents routinely abusing their power for personal gain. Sablin is right. This is not Lenin's Soviet Union. There has to be a better way."\n\n"Listen to yourself Sergei. Yagoda and the NKVD are the only thing that have kept Lenin's Soviet Union alive. You think that the Union would have survived a single year against the warlords and the fascists if not for Yagoda? The NKVD is the only thing keeping our enemies at bay."\n\n"Whatever you tell yourself to help you sleep at night," Sergei said bitterly, downing his vodka and rising from his chair. "Next time we see each other, it is as enemies."\n\nThe brothers parted without another word into the cold Siberian night."

Even as he went about his day, his anxiety only barely keeping up with his exhaustion, he looked at his front door whenever he could, hoping to hear a knock from his one and only son, hoping beyond hope that he had escaped capture by Yagoda's thugs. Alisa, bless her soul, worried about his own restlessness, even if she tried to hide it. If he knew Yagoda though, and he did, all too well, then he was not the one she should be worried about. Their son was in greater danger than most people could imagine.\n\nAs Boldyrev was reading a book early in the night, trying to calm himself and finally get some sleep, a knock came. He nearly fell on the floor trying to get up, and ran so quickly to the door he feared he might trip. When he reached the door and opened it, however, the excitement on his face vanished. This was not his son. This was an NKVD officer, his stare cold and unfeeling. "A letter, for you, comrade." Boldyrev opened it, fear quickly building down to his very bones. It was a letter, one first thanking him for his years of service to the NKVD. Then it went on to explain that his son's body had been discovered at the site of the final capture of Sablin, identified by old NKVD friends of Boldyrev who had known his son as a child. It was signed by Yagoda personally. Boldyrev collapsed to his knees, tears streaming out of his eyes, which stared after the retreating back of the NKVD officer. It was useless, utterly useless. Nobody could oppose Yagoda, god damn his name, yet he had been foolish enough to let his son try. It was a choice he would regret for the rest of his days. Even when Alisa, who had been woken by the commotion, came to comfort him, he barely felt it."

Too many of Sablin's soldiers would never return home, and he had seen more than one weeping widow or grieving parent since the war had ended. The only question that remained was- would he be among them?\n\nIn the middle of the day, as Boldyrev was washing dishes at the sink, a knock came at the door. He nearly dropped the plate he was holding in his excitement. He wasn't expecting any visitors. Rushing to the door, he threw it open, and he could have almost cried at the sight that greeted him. There was his son, decked out in one of the finest uniforms Sablin's forces had to offer, with a big grin plastered across his face. "I'm home, papa." His son said, his voice almost cracking. "I'm finally home." They embraced, with Boldyrev patting his son on the back to comfort him.\n\nInviting his son inside, Boldyrev called over his wife, who was similarly overjoyed to see her son alive and well. They sat their son down with all the food he could want, and listened as he told them his best stories of the conflict, concluding with the fact that he had been appointed one of Sablin's guards for his distinguished service. For all Boldyrev cared, he could have been a deserter. He was just glad to see that his son was okay."

In accordance with the Union's policies and procedures, he was brought before a tribunal, judged for his crimes against the state, and sentenced to death by firing squad. He struggled and wept as he was ushered outside to his doom. As befitting a traitor to the Revolution, his final words were not recorded.\n\nAs told by the heirs of Harbin, Alexander Men led a great and valiant battle against the thuggish militias of Irkutsk. Though he fought bravely, the vile communists outnumbered the righteous priest and his company. They seized and tortured him. They delivered him to a group of secret police, who demanded he recant his Christian faith. When the troublesome priest failed to break, they disposed of him via firing squad. His last words were a condemnation of Marx and all his allies.\n\nStill, there is another story told in the nameless villages of Siberia. In this version, Alexander Men was not seized. He participated in no glorious battles, no attempted escapes. Rather, seeing the devastation wrought by the fighting done in his name, Alexander Men surrendered himself to the forces of Irkutsk. He came peacefully before a tribunal and said nothing as they condemned him for his crimes. Before the doors to the courtroom opened, before soldiers ushered the village priest to his oblivion, Alexander Men rose from his seat.

Every time they opened their mouth, they would get shouted down by the jury, the witnesses, or the judge himself.\n\nAfter hours of the court session, the verdict was clear. The Yakutians would be shot for counter-revolutionary behavior. They were escorted to a wall behind the court, lined up to the wall, and shot before their bodies were stacked on the back of a truck and sent to a communal grave.\n\nSeveral trials similar to this followed.

Contrasted with the rest of the place, Kosygin's eyes were fixed on a freshly painted sign reading YakAlmaz Kombinat where some other name had once stood. Meanwhile, Yagoda stayed fixated on a man with a helmet, slowly walking towards them in the snow.\n\nThe identity of the man turned out to be that of the mine's foreman. Excitedly he greeted the two and showed them around. They saw the equipment, the mines, a few of the diamonds extracted, and even a side area designated for lumber.\n\nWhat they saw was disappointing, but expected. Much of the mine was not in operation, and short of workers. Still, it was an ongoing process and Kosygin gained an idea of what to provide for future operations. Similarly, Yagoda took pride in the leadership of the operation. All party loyalists, with not a spec of the old companies, left.\n\nAs the tour ended, the manager and two men exchanged pleasantries, thanking each other for their presence and contributions respectively.

It's obviously not the case that you were disloyal, Marshal, merely that you were confused as to whom were the rightful heirs to the old government. Well, now you know. It's us."\n\n"What are you getting at," sighed Vasilevsky.\n\n"What I'm getting at is your reputation, Marshal. You received a great deal of criticism for failing to stand up to old Comrade Bukharin when you clearly disagreed with his policies, military or otherwise. What we're saying, Vasilevsky, is that Comrade Yagoda is looking forward to enjoying the same lovely arrangement.""
 IRK_superregional.2.a: "Welcome back to the USSR, Marshal Vasilevsky."

 IRK_superregional.3.t: "Yagoda's Mercy"
 IRK_superregional.3.desc: "Genrikh Yagoda restlessly tapped his pen on his desk. The numbers weren't adding up, and he had done all he could reasonably be expected to do in order to make them do so.\n\nHe frowned. Money was missing from the budget, too much for it to be a mere error. The perpetrator had done little to nothing to cover his tracks, likely expecting to get away with it due to his rank.\n\nHad he not been clear that the years of corruption were over? That fraud would no longer be tolerable in his government? That transgressions against the legitimacy of the state would be met with death?\n\nPerhaps he had been too merciful in the past, too lenient to truly send the correct message. Yes, if there was one thing that Comrade Yagoda knew was true of himself, it was that he was a merciful man. Anyone else in his position who was looking out over the seditious world he ruled over would have burned it all down.\n\nHis old bony fingers spun the phone dial and he lifted the receiver to his ear.\n\n"Yes, chairman?" asked his secretary.\n\n"There's a man we need to make an example of," Comrade Yagoda said, without joy, but only with duty."
 IRK_superregional.3.a: "The mercy of Comrade Yagoda is a privilege that can be revoked."

 IRK_superregional.4.t: "A Growing Middle Class"
 IRK_superregional.4.desc: "Allowing foreign interests into our territory has done wonders towards restoring our capabilities as an industrial nation! We're reaping the benefits of an increased economic base while also greatly improving conditions for the actual citizenry.\n\nWith foreign interests paying our workers higher than average wages, and the increased wealth allowing us to spend more on social programs, it's becoming clear that a nascent middle class is beginning to form, and will soon be a thriving aspect of our nation!\n\nDie-hard socialists at home might complain about our hypocrisy at allowing the capitalists into our nation, and the newly arrived foreigners grumble about the intense policing and supervision in our state - but none can argue that the policy has been successful."
 IRK_superregional.4.a: "It's better to have a rich oppressed nation than a poor oppressed nation."

 IRK_superregional.5.t: "The Red Phoenix"
 IRK_superregional.5.desc: "The first major attempt at animation in our nation since the Great Patriotic War has been distributed today to state theatres as part of our ongoing propaganda campaign to remind people of Comrade Yagoda's benevolence.\n\nThe film, titled: Red Phoenix, has struck a chord with the Russian people.\n\nThe film stars an old red phoenix, once mighty, with a face resembling Comrade Bukharin being chased through a quiet and friendly Siberian town before ultimately being struck down by a crude and bumbling caricature of Adolf Hitler. For ten minutes of screentime, villagers are shown to be in a miserable state as Hitler and his Nazis rampage through town. Just when all seems lost, the phoenix rises again, now resembling Comrade Yagoda, and throws the Nazis out, to the cheers and adoration of the town.\n\nThe animation is only 38 minutes long, and foreign observers have derided it as being decades out of date artistically speaking. They may be right, as it most resembles the relatively crude propaganda films that had come out of Japan in the mid 40's, save that the Russian animators had taken special care to ensure that the colour red was in the film, even if the rest of it was black and white.\n\nRegardless of what the foreigners think, it's a hit, and the masses are clearly warming up to Yagoda's cult of personality."
 IRK_superregional.5.a: "With what we've been through, any animation industry at all is a feat unto itself."

 IRK_superregional.6.t: "Freedom of Speech, Not Freedom from Consequence"
 IRK_superregional.6.desc: ""You'll forgive us for not trusting you!" yelled a man in the crowd to the USSR rep who had been sent to the village.\n\nPyoter, was the dissident man's name, according to Kirill's local informant, and so Kirill scribbled the man's name into his NKVD notebook.\n\n"Yes," yelled the representative in reply. "Yes I do forgive you. The new USSR is not the old one. We are FOR the people, well and truly! We encourage all of you to speak your minds!"\n\n"We all see through your registry scheme, comrade! You just want information on us so we can easily be rounded up!" cried a woman, and Kirill wrote her name down too.\n\n"We DO want to know who and where you are, comrades, but only to know how better to serve you! So we can better know where to distribute your food and any goods you may need," the rep said with an honest smile. "And I know you do not trust me, but I swear to you that this is a new USSR! One where freedom of speech and open dialogue is a protected right! If you need any more evidence of this, consider that the old government would have NEVER allowed you to speak to a party member in this way. Please, comrades, fill out your registry information and do not be afraid to speak, for you are, each of you, safe in your nation!"\n\nKirill smiled as the townspeople reluctantly filed out to the registration tents that had been set up. He flipped his notebook shut and handed it to one of the other plainclothes NKVD agents who was present.\n\n"Round up all those who spoke out, make sure no one knows it's you," Kyrill ordered. His lips curled into a wicked grin."
 IRK_superregional.6.a: "The new culture of openness sure makes life easier for the NKVD!"

 IRK_superregional.7.t: "A Memory of the Mutineer"
 IRK_superregional.7.desc: "Genrikh Yagoda watched the lights flicker in his office. Re-industrialization was going well, but the old systems that had yet to be replaced and rewired were still nothing to rely on.\n\nOutdated or not, the fact that so much of his territory had power at all was a testament to his success.\n\nHe reached over his reports to drink from a glass of cool water, enjoying the feeling as it chilled his throat and mouth.\n\nSo much success, and they had come so close, within mere inches of losing it all in the uprising of the 'Leninist' turncoat, Valery Sablin.\n\nIt was a defining moment for the USSR, the greatest challenge she had ever faced.\n\nHe remembered the day he received the report. For an instant, a single instant of coldblooded panic and hopeless terror, Genrikh thought he could understand what old Bukharin felt the day they told him that the Wehrmacht had invaded.\n\nGenrikh wasn't there that day, but he had informants who were. They said Bukharin had shrivelled when he heard - wilting like a flower before an inferno.\n\nAnd so, when Yagoda faced the same circumstance, the same test of will - staring national downfall in the face - he knew that he could not flounder as Bukharin had done. Yagoda remained strong, remained composed, and patiently moved to handle the upstart.\n\nGenrikh smiled. It was the first of many tests of his resurgent nation, but there were many more to come. He took pen in hand and returned to his paperwork once more, renewed in his will to succeed."
 IRK_superregional.7.a: "The new USSR, like its leadership, will be stronger than the old."

 IRK_superregional.8.t: "The End of the Gulags!"
 IRK_superregional.8.desc: "In a rare and welcome upset to Soviet politics, Sergey Bessonov has continued to pleasantly surprise his nation in sticking to his promised reforms to create a less oppressive USSR. Though the NKVD has been grumbling quietly about it, it's unlikely that such an organization would protest publicly at the changes, nor does it seem likely that they'll make a move against the party now that stability has finally started to return to the nation.\n\nBessonov drafted legislation this morning to do something unthinkable to many, ending the gulag labour camps and put an end to a nearly forty year old institution of national repression.\n\nTo alleviate concerns that dangerous dissidents are being released out into the nation, Bessonov has arranged for a fair retrial of the forced labourers based upon the modern enforcement of the law rather than the harsh policies of Yagoda.\n\nOther critics have pointed out that the end of the gulags will cripple the state's ability to build infrastructure or other large projects, but the party insists that anything built on the backs of slave labour is not worth being built.\n\nOn the other hand, former prisoners are being formally offered jobs and good wages to continue working in 'construction camps,' though it's unknown how many will take up this offer in favour of leaving the entire nightmare behind."
 IRK_superregional.8.a: "I suppose we'll need to build some proper prisons now, won't we?"

 IRK_superregional.9.t: "The New Role of the Nomenklatura"
 IRK_superregional.9.desc: ""Perhaps you misunderstand me, comrade. I am a member of the Nomenklatura!" insisted Artur to the stuffy bureaucrat.\n\nThe bureaucrat smiled and nodded placatively as though speaking to a child.\n\n"Yes you are, comrade Artur, and here is your important Nomenklatura desk and your important Nomenklatura paperwork," said the impudent administrator, causing Artur's lip to curl in anger.\n\nThe "desk" in question was far less than he deserved, little more than sheet metal welded into a surface with a few drawers. It was a mass-produced thing that was unworthy of him. And as if the entire matter wasn't insulting enough, the "paperwork" in question, upon a brief look, seemed to be utterly unimportant reports confirming grain shipments to and from irrelevant and impoverished villages on the far fringes of civilization!\n\n"Comrade! I am a member of the Nomenklatura!" he bellowed in anger.\n\n"Yes you are," agreed the bureaucrat with a polite nod. "Now have those reports on my desk by 6 PM.""
 IRK_superregional.9.a: "A very special job for a very special boy."

 IRK_superregional.10.t: "Investigating the Personality Cult"
 IRK_superregional.10.desc: "The Bessonov administration has spent perhaps more time than might have been thought strictly necessary investigating the cult of personality that Genrikh Yagoda had built for himself. Among other things, a series of rejected propaganda photos which involved a shirtless Yagoda hunting, fishing, and riding on horseback through the wilderness have been passed around with great amusement between the party members.\n\nThe effects of the cult surrounding Yagoda, however, are no laughing matter, as they allowed him to act as an unimpeded dictator that could step over the proletariat as though they were his personal slaves without any fear of retaliation or checks on his power.\n\nAfter the party was finished cackling at a picture of Yagoda holding a leopard (once again, while shirtless,) they elected to prevent such a thing from happening again.\n\nClarifications were made to the public as to what the old administration had been lying about, as well warning the public to never throw away their ability to think skeptically, even when it's the government speaking.\n\nAdditionally, limits were introduced, among other precautions, about how much could be written or broadcast about the chairmen or other important politicians compared to other news topics, to prevent any temptation on the part of future chairmen to force the state media to fixate upon him."
 IRK_superregional.10.a: "Hey look, a picture of Yagoda climbing a mountain! Where's his shirt?"

 IRK_superregional.11.t: "An Anonymous Virtuoso?"
 IRK_superregional.11.desc: "The crowds flooding into Ulan-Ude Opera House last night were record breaking as local singer Dominika Kuznetsova performed the first wholly original work of operatic music in nearly twenty years.\n\nThe performance drew in both the frequent opera goers as well as the old enthusiasts who'd grown bored of the same shows and songs being performed week after week. The performance itself was a hit, and while the piece is not considered to be one of the all-time greats of Russian music, it was certainly a welcome new addition.\n\nKuznetzova herself has declined to reveal the identity of the songwriter, insisting that "He would like to remain anonymous." Whoever he is, it's clear that Buryat would like to hear more of his work.\n\nAs if to spoil the fun, a recent arrival in the city, who claims to have resided in Tomsk up until recently, insists that the piece is a rip off of an identical piece of music that had been composed and presented in Tomsk, but merely with a few 'awkward sounding' changes to make the piece sound less subversive to the communist government.\n\nBeing that the work stumbles at a few strange places, despite flowing beautifully elsewhere - it could be that he's right."
 IRK_superregional.11.a: "Copyright? We don't have that problem here."

 IRK_superregional.12.t: "A Deal with the Devil"
 IRK_superregional.12.desc: "A minute passes, a small sip of wine.\n\nThat had been the actions of one tired man residing in Tomsk. Of course, his actions were not uncommon, for it had been repeated across the city. Many mourned for the Central Siberian Republic, and for the dream of democracy.\n\nThat, however, were not the only reasons the man drank, for he was a Humanist politician in the Central Siberian Republic, and he lost more than the dream of democracy. No, for his political career as a Humanist went up in flames along with Tomsk's ideals, and unless he accepted the offer gave by the Government in Irkutsk, he may be forced to live in a cold prison cell. Or worse.\n\nBut that would involve betraying his ideals, for Irkutsk was the complete opposite of all his ideals. They did not support the ideas of democracy, their leaders were the same men that oppressed his former Humanist colleagues, and their leader is a raving despot. For him to even think about accepting their "generous" offer, he would have to swallow his pride whole.\n\nBut are his pride and ideals really worth more than his life?\n\nSwallowing the remainder of the wine he had in his hand, the man swore and dialed the phone."
 IRK_superregional.12.a: ""I accept", the man muttered."

 IRK_superregional.13.t: "A Memory of Tyranny"
 IRK_superregional.13.desc: "It was while touring a building site and happily noting the new worker safety precautions that had been taken, that Sergey Bessonov came to the long overdue certainty that he had made the right decision.\n\nGenrikh Yagoda would never have done this, would never have cared what went on in a coal mine beyond sheer productivity. But Sergei did, and while the other might have complained that it was a waste of resources while the USSR had more important matters to attend to, the truth had been that Bessonov's reforms had built a strong, united, and motivated nation, quite unlike the reluctant police state he had inherited from his predecessor.\n\nGenrikh Yagoda.\n\nBessonov felt his fists curl up in anger at the memories. Socialism was meant to serve the people, not oppress them, and yet to the tyrant-in-chief, the people were nothing more than slaves to his state machinery. So much was at stake with the flourishing state they had preserved here in the far east, and thanks to Yagoda, most of it had been lost or compromised to rebellions.\n\nBessonov promised he would prove himself better, and today he was finally certain that he had done so. But Bessonov had made another promise too, one that would be a lifelong endeavor.\n\nNo one like Yagoda would ever rise to power again."

The voice of the judge droned on and on, as though he had memorized a script. He probably had, Feliks Sokolov thought. They always gave the same sentences to so-called traitors anyways, the Red Army bastards, no reason to treat most of the sentences as special. While his supposed comrades might be shaking in their boots right now, Feliks was wise to this communist nonsense. He had fought against the communists since Barbarossa, was more despised by the reds than any of the younger officers on trial here, yet they would give them a fate no kinder than that in store for him. Why live in fear when facing certain death?\n\nAs the judge kept on reading and reading, Feliks found he just couldn't take it any more. Not the flat tone of the judge, not the pitiless glares of the soldiers, and certainly not the boys dressed up as men on trial beside him, unable to accept their fate. "Enough!" Feliks roared at last, slamming his handcuffed fists on the table before him. "My charges and verdict are irrelevant. Get to the damned execution, you spineless freaks." Anger flashed across the faces of a couple of the soldiers, who raised their guns, but the judge motioned for them to stand down. "Very well, Mr. Sokolov." Feliks was surprised the man even bothered remembering his name. "The court hereby finds you guilty. Your sentence is summary execution. Comrades, escort these men out to the field, and tie them to your posts." As the soldiers approached him, the judge stared at Feliks, an indiscernible emotion on his face somewhere between pity and disgust. "Do you have any last words, Mr. Sokolov? I'd like to hear them."\n\n"When you get to hell, you bastards had better be ready, because there I'll kill you first."\n\n"I see. Goodbye, Mr. Sokolov.""

Definitely not being here, in a shitty fort in the middle of nowhere, guarding prisoners who weren't even important. Everybody was bored, even the prisoners. Coming back inside after a smoke, Igor was surprised to hear people shouting passionately. Not a cheer or a poor attempt at singing (that they had done a week ago), but an argument. But what were they all yelling about? He got closer.\n\nIgor realized that, bereft of other ways to spend their time, the soldiers and prisoners appeared to be debating politics. "How can somebody be a hereditary reactionary? That's just racism in Marxist language! Hitler called it 'national socialism' too!" one soldier said to the assembled captives. His comrades nodded in agreement.\n\nA prisoner, seated on the opposite side, quickly retorted: "Hitler wasn't a Marxist. Comrade Serov simply recognizes the fact that people inherit the class status of their parents, extended to entire bourgeois cultural groups, like the Jews. If it's genuine Marxist credentials you want to talk about, why is it that your butcher Yagoda slaughters legions of other communists and hands over the country's resources to the bourgeoisie?"\n\n"Is the red Hitlerite really calling us revisionists?" butted in another voice.\n\nIgor wisely decided to stay out of the discussion. In a battlefield teeming with genuine chemical weapons, there was still nothing quite as toxic as political disputes left to fester."

 manul.1.t: "The Nature of War"
 manul.1.desc: "Florentiy walked along the tracks from Ulan-Ude to Chita, exhausted from his current assignment. He had been the unlucky soul in his unit to get tasked with checking for UXOs for the week. Now on his last day, he was just looking to stay alive and rotate the ordinance inspection for the next poor bastard.\n\nIn his boredom, he kicked a rock, watching it fly into the air until it landed below his visible horizon. Curious, he carefully maneuvered himself to where it landed. As he approached, he found himself staring down a shell hole. While at first apprehensive, he soon became relieved seeing no ordinance remaining. He would be spared from paperwork.\n\nJust as he was about to turn around and resume his patrol, he heard a soft mewl come from down the shell hole. Against his better judgment, he traveled down to investigate the noise. When he arrived at the source, what he found made him drop his gun. In a small crevice was a group of the fluffiest, most adorable manulchiks Florentiy had ever seen.\n\nAlmost instinctively, Florentiy reached out to the baby cats as his eyes glazed over from their adorableness. Yet, before he could reach them, his hand retracted as a loud growl emanated from further inside the den. Looking deeper, he could make out two glowing eyes staring down at him ready to kill. Terrified, the once brave soldier found himself fleeing out of the crater in terror, leaving his gun behind where he dropped it.\n\nMeanwhile, the eye's owner continued her walk to her young. Sure enough, her babies were as safe and energetic as could be, unaware of the danger they were in. As she attended to her young, her attention was taken away briefly by a loud boom from outside the shell hole. Yet her attention quickly returned as the sound faded away, leaving the mother and her young in peace."
 manul.1.a: "The young remained playful and ignorant."

 manul.2.t: "Silent Strolls"
 manul.2.desc: "In a rare moment of peace, the woods of Buryatia remained silent. Gerasim walked along the train tracks connecting Ulan-Ude to Chita, from the small stop that was his little village. In a rare moment of solitude from his day job cutting wood, he gazed around the canopy, wondering what the trees must see.\n\nAs his sight moved back down, his attention was drawn to two things. First was the mangled corpse of some unfortunate bastard who stepped on a mine. The second was a shell hole just off his path. Against his better judgment, he decided to descend, feeling some connection to what lay below.\n\nAs he reached the bottom, what he saw surprised him. A group of innocent manulchiks had taken up residence in a makeshift den. Wanting to get a better look, he approached the babies. However, he stopped when he saw their mother rear her way in front of her young, and defensively hiss at him.\n\nRather than fear, Gerasim's first reaction was to chuckle. It was funny, he thought. The fierce nature reminded her of his old wife Yuliya. Her temper was always something he had to be careful of. However, as he thought about the sight more, a deep wistfulness filled him. The last he had seen her was shielding their daughters from the Siberian War. She could only do so much against an artillery shell.\n\nNow thoroughly depressed, Gerasim slowly backed away from the mother until she no longer seemed to care. Once he was finally out of sight, he slowly climbed his way out of the shell hole, before scurrying back to town, tears in his eyes. He had gone on his walk to forget his past, not remember it."

Reluctantly, she stretched herself awake. She had seen some strange things in the last few days, but the noise was new.\n\nWalking out of her cave, she squinted at the sight of the sun over Lake Baikal. She always hated the morning light, it was why she slept in so late, at least when she was disturbed by loud noises. Yet, as her eyes adjusted to the light, what she saw confused her. The dam on the lake seemed bigger, boxes and machinery had been moved in front of her cave, and the boots of the humans marched around like they owned the place.\n\nBOOM! The loud noise startled the manul, causing her to sprint out in a commotion. Turning around, she saw her former home destroyed, as the roof collapsed in from the explosives of a construction crew. Yet at the same time, confused workers looked at the isolated manul, now left vulnerable out in the open.\n\nFrightened, she ran east through the camp. She weaved through the machinery and boxes around her now unfamiliar surroundings. Recognizing a stretch of woods, she stopped as she analyzed the best way through the remaining construction. However, her contemplation was short-lived as the sound of a missed shot rang out next to her. Terrified, the manul bolted forward, leaping out of the camp and into the comparative safety of the wild.\n\nShe continued running until she could hear the men and see the construction no more. Relieved at her safety, she collapsed on the ground, rolling in the dirt screeching. Yet her relief was short-lived as she realized the circumstances of her situation. A new home would need to be found, all over again."

 manul.4.t: "Into the Wild"
 manul.4.desc: "Yaroslav quietly crouched down and inspected a set of small footprints leading deeper into the woods. They were fresh, he was getting closer he thought. With a net in one hand and a small cage in the other, He had been wandering around the woods south of Novosibirsk for the last few days. However, the exhausted hunter was sure that his chase would soon be at an end.\n\nAs he crossed a stream, Yaroslav let out a sigh. Titan might have paid well, but he seriously questioned his decision to take the job. After all, manuls were not uncommon. Indeed, surely there were places they could buy one for their zoo? Then again, maybe it was just a desire for quality, and maybe again he was not the only unlucky bastard doing this given the zoo's ever-expanding size.\n\nSetting foot on the other bank, he could make out more tracks, now leading to a cave. As he got closer, Yaroslav's eyes widened as he finally got a look at his target. The large fluff ball was just sitting outside licking its fur. Carefully, he approached, keeping his eyes locked on his target. Unfortunately for him, the sound of a branch under his boot ruined his plan.\n\nLocking eyes, Yaroslav began running towards the manul hoping to corner it in its cave. The plan worked as the manul retreated into the cave, but only for a moment. From the darkness, the frightening manul leaped at Yaroslav climbing up his leather jacket in a run for his face.\n\nYet, he had come prepared for this. Thinking quickly, he dropped the cage and grabbed it by the neck with his newly freed hand. Now confused, the manul found itself swooped up in a net before being thrown into the small cage on the floor. Yaroslav breathed a sigh of relief. The hard part of his job was done, and only with a few scratches. However, his stomach dropped looking at the grumpy feline, remembering he was still far from done."

 manul.5.t: "Deceptive Denizens"
 manul.5.desc: "Heinu gazed over his shoulder back at Lake Baikal. Siberia did not quite match his home of South Africa, but that did not mean it lacked its own beauties. As he returned to his hike, he could not believe how fortunate he was to have this opportunity.\n\nWhen some men in his company had suggested the idea of camping he had seen it as a break from the constant warring in West Alaska, however, he had since redeveloped an appreciation for campaigning. It was a rare moment of peace in Heinu's life.\n\nThe mercenary stopped upon seeing a rare instance of fauna on his trail. Before him was a round gray shaggy cat with emerald eyes. Mistaking it for a stray, Heinu decided to approach in an attempt to pet it. Unfortunately for him, the creature was not having any of it.\n\nReaching down to pet, the manul slowly shifted back before pouncing on his head. In a state of shock, the mercenary remained motionless as the feline began scratching at his face. He was stirred to action however when he felt the manul's large fangs sink into his ear. Now energized, he tried swiping at the manul to no avail, as it turned itself around before sinking its fangs into his right eye.\n\nEventually, the manul got bored with its attack and left with a trophy in its mouth. The Mercenary found himself covered in blood, and half his vision gone. It was clear he would need medical attention, but more than anything he would need an excuse when he got back to camp. After all, he could not rightfully go back and tell his buddies that he lost to an overweight house cat.\n\nAs he stumbled back, he came up with the perfect story, if a little cliche. He had fought a bear, and won, but lost his eye in the process. As he neared the camp he took a deep breath, running through his concocted series of events."

 manul.6.t: "Imitations"
 manul.6.desc: "Leaning on the side of a truck, the sweet taste of nicotine graced the back of Karol's throat as he watched the scattered men before him inspect the abandoned farm. Officer Karol had sent his men on a 'training' mission to teach them about reconnaissance. All they had to do was find a cat and report back to him, simple as that. Yet, he watched in unfortunate expectation as the rookies fumbled their way across the farm.\n\nOf course, this action was not technically sanctioned by the government, not that anyone was going to stop an officer of his rank. No, truthfully he just wanted a pet cat, similar to that of the Vozhd. Mura had created a craze in the state, and Karol was not about to be left out.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the approach of one of his rookies, with arms full of some sort of fluff. Upon closer inspection though, officer Karol smiled upon realizing his subordinate's success. "Karol, sir! I found these strange kittens in the loft of the barn. Are these satisfactory?"\n\nKarol picked up one that looked particularly adorable and began inspecting it. The confused kitten had thick gray fur with black spots. Its shaggy coat made way for large ears and the most precious little face imaginable. She was perfect!\n\nCalmly, Karol replied to his subordinate. "This will do. Put the rest back where you found them and gather up the rest of the men. I want to visit the village hunter and get some information on this creature." The rookie saluted and hurried off. Left alone, officer Karol made his way inside the truck for some privacy. He petted his new companion, as he looked into her green eyes, thinking of a name."

The Presidium and Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union both make their homes in Irkutsk, and exist as the continued legislative authority within our state.\n\nTwo factions make up the government of the USSR - the §CParty§! faction, made up of by much of the Presidium, advocates for the proletarian state to be subordinate to the will of the Party, as was argued for by Lenin. The §eState§! faction, however, is in favor of the opposite approach. To them, the Party is subordinate to the organs of state power - ideology is second to the material necessities of governance.\n\nThe current §Ybalance of power§! is in favor of [IRKGetRulingFaction].\n\nReforms to the proletarian state may be enacted by the government below."

 IRK_bitter_remnant_desc: "Defeat after defeat - this is what has characterized our remnant statelet since its inception after the Great Patriotic War. Defeated by the Germans, defeated by the Japanese, defeated by our own kin, incited by the Sablinite traitors. But General Secretary Yagoda and the Presidium still preside over us; and under their leadership our defeats will be avenged.."
 IRK_yagodas_paranoia: "NKVD Securocracy"
 IRK_yagodas_paranoia_desc: "The Union lives on with us, the last remnant of continuity of governance. Our institutions are strong, weathering the Second World War, the coup that split our Union, the long retreat, and the Siberian War. What has kept us strong and stable for these decades is nothing other than the political acumen of Comrade Yagoda, the will of the people, and the strength of the NKVD, the shield and sword of the Revolution. With our trained NKVD officers and unmatched security apparatus, we are to be finally safe from threats internal and external - free to put down the traitors and reclaim the proletarian state."
 IRK_expanded_securocracy: "Strengthened NKVD Securocracy"
 IRK_expanded_securocracy_desc: "Despite apparent dedication to the Revolution, no man of the Party is above suspicion. They have betrayed us before, and may do so again. The NKVD is above petty politics and corruption; therefore, they shall be entrusted to ensure the... correct conduct of our government."
 IRK_weakened_securocracy: "Weakened NKVD Securocracy"
 IRK_weakened_securocracy_desc: "The Union lives on with us, the last remnant of continuity of governance. Our institutions are strong, weathering the Second World War, the coup that split our Union, the long retreat, and the Siberian War. But we delude ourselves if we think that securocratic officials such as the NKVD did not play a part in their decline. With the recent change in governance, we do not deem it opportune to permit such overcorrections as the NKVD is specialised in to continue; accordingly, the bluecaps shall be reined in somewhat."
 IRK_supreme_securocracy: "Supreme NKVD Securocracy"
 IRK_supreme_securocracy_desc: "The NKVD is the shield and sword of the Revolution. With our trained NKVD officers and unmatched security apparatus, we are to be finally safe from threats internal and external - free to put down the traitors and reclaim the proletarian state. In order to protect the revolutionary state, we will ensure its supremacy over all other governmental organs save for the head of state himself."
 IRK_the_kgb: "The Committee for State Security"
 IRK_the_kgb_desc: "As we began to expand our borders, the need for a proper intelligence bureau became evident. Seeking to undermine the corrupt and self-serving NKVD, the party faction pushed for the creation of a new, separate agency. The KGB will now serve as a sword and shield for the Presidium, shielding us from danger and striking down our enemies before they get the chance to."

 IRK_administrative_shortcomings_desc: "Our near-collapse in the Buryatian Mutiny is proof that something must be done about our administrative issues.

 IRK_administrative_shortcomings_2: "Overturned Administration"
 IRK_administrative_shortcomings_2_desc: "Our near-collapse in the Buryatian Mutiny, combined with the recent overturning of our administration, is proof that something must be done about our administrative issues. Every day, there are reports of corruption within regional administrations, of asinine decisionmaking, and of funds being lost (or worse). There is no time to waste - something must be done, and quickly."
 IRK_remember_the_revolution: "Remember the Revolution!"
 IRK_remember_the_revolution_desc: "Sablin has attempted to claim the mantle of Lenin's revolution, painting himself as a true Leninist and his band of scum as spiritual successors to the October Revolution. While this is obviously nonsense, many of our citizens have fallen under the sway of these lies. We must prove that we carry the torch of the workers' revolution, while the partisans are nothing more than deceitful reactionaries. For this purpose, a propaganda campaign appropriating his messaging will do the trick."

 IRK_yagodite_atrocities: "Red Terror"
 IRK_yagodite_atrocities_desc: "The Red Terror of the Russian Revolution was a violent, but necessary measure as the monarchists and Whites resisted the people. It demonstrated the willingness of the revolutionaries to not merely punish tyranny - but actively purge it. This reassurance is again needed, so the people rest easy knowing the greatest threats to Russia are being dealt with - and to break the spirits of our enemies.\n\nLet them know there will be no reprieve; no mercy for those who stand against the Soviet Union."

 IRK_ironclad_union_desc: "In 1921, the 10th Party Congress recognized the danger of party factionalism to the Soviet Union when they passed the Resolution on Party Unity.

 IRK_operation_ariel_desc: "The territory of Chita, as with the whole of the Far East, is rightfully Soviet land; however, due to our temporary weakness an Australian squatter claiming Romanov blood and backed by some of the Harbin splinters has seized control over it. This shall not be tolerated - let us continue what Ilyich started, and remove yet more Romanovs from our lands!"

 IRK_operation_pluto_desc: "Reactionary religious fascists led by a priest more skilled than many of his evil kindred in disseminating what Marx rightly called the 'opiate of the masses' have occupied the once-anarchic Omolon region in the aftermath of the Buryat Mutiny. Now that we are stronger, we will move at once to cleanse the Socialist Far East of this plague!"

 IRK_frontline_commissars_desc: "The soldiers are not always as obedient as they should be; at times they harbour thoughts of dissent or of reaction. No better panacea exists for this than the existence and promotion of the old military commissar system. At a small cost of command effectiveness and war enthusiasm, we will strengthen our political efforts and make the soldiers take not even one step back."

With the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet once more in control of the only functional port in Russia that isn't blockaded by the enemy, it shall henceforth be our window to the outside world and a key strategic component in our efforts to reclaim every last inch of the Soviet Union that's temporarily been lost to §qanarchy§!, §jfascism§! and §Irevisionists§!.\n\nGuiding our efforts to achieve our new economic goals is the §VSoviet Development and Reform Commission§!.

 IRK_begin_the_eigth_five_year_plan: "Begin the 8th Five Year Plan"
 IRK_begin_the_eigth_five_year_plan_desc: "With the initial underperformance of the last Five Year Plan remedied thanks to the reclamation of more parts of the Soviet Union and the restoration of its resources to rightful Soviet rule, S.D.R.C. has revised their projections for the Eighth plan. With its successful completion according to our economists projections, the Soviet Union's economic strength will surpass what we had before the outbreak of the Siberian War!"
 IRK_encourage_international_volunteers: "Encourage International Volunteers"
 IRK_encourage_international_volunteers_desc: "In the past, the Soviet Union organized international forces in collaboration with local communist parties, fostering a spirit of solidarity in our collective struggle. A lot has changed since the thirties and now it's the Soviet Union itself that needs help. As the rightful seat of the Soviet government, we'll reach out to the remaining socialist movements of the world to organize volunteer forces to be sent to us through the port of Magadan. While this will help us with our regrettable manpower situation, these men and women are not of the highest quality, even under NKVD supervision."
 IRK_repair_the_baikal_highway: "Repair the Baikal Highway"
 IRK_repair_the_baikal_highway_desc: "The M55 Highway connecting the temporary Soviet capital to the rest of Siberia has been badly damaged as a result of the recent uprising by the revisionist agitators under Sablin. As we've already dealt with their punishments for this insurrection, we'll use this as an opportunity to rehabilitate some of his former men by assigning them to a state construction firm. They should be thankful that we're giving them a path back to socialist labor - the other rebels will not be as lucky..."
 IRK_finish_the_amur_highway: "Finish the Amur Highway"
 IRK_finish_the_amur_highway_desc: "One of the issues noted by our economists is the lack of functional trains and reliable roads as a result of the persistent efforts of the enemies of the people to disrupt Soviet rule in Siberia. While those leading out of the temporary Soviet capital are serviceable, the same can't be said about the recently reclaimed areas to the east. It's therefore of the utmost importance that we restore the roads to working condition so that we may continue with our economic development. Started in the past decades as part of the Siberian Plan, the M58 connecting Chita to Amur was left unfinished due to the §VGreat Patriotic War§! and the subsequent disruptions in communications. Organizing a supplemental labor battalion out of the RFP prisoners from the liberation of Amur should ensure the swift completion of the project. Justice will be dispensed as their masters in Berlin caused this unfortunate delay in the first place."

 IRK_complete_the_magadan_connection_desc: "The M56 was an endeavor to connect Magadan to the more temperate parts of Siberia. Many laborers risked life and limb to achieve this monument to socialist progress, but just like they've destroyed so many things in the Soviet Union, the fascists that occupied the port of Magadan have let most of the oblast's infrastructure go to waste. Justice shall be swift, and the NKVD will make sure that a labour detail consisting of Matkovsky's captured men repair every last inch of the road that they wrecked. Once we have a decent road leading into Magadan, we can finally begin transporting goods to and from the port."
 IRK_restoration_of_irkutsk_hps: "Restoration of the Irkutsk HPS"
 IRK_restoration_of_irkutsk_hps_desc: "During the brief period during which the Soviet Union was limited to merely holding on to the area of Irkutsk, S.D.R.C. made the assessment that our temporary shortage of necessary equipment made it impossible to fully maintain the Irkutsk HPS. As a result, the power station visibly bears the scars of half a decade's worth of maintenance cuts and hasn't been operating at an ideal capacity for years. With the liberation of the Soviet Far East and its resources however we can finally resume the scheduled work and tie it into our plans to expand the plant in the future. Merely catching up on the maintenance work, however, would be more than enough to put us in a position where we can keep our industries going without needing to ration electricity."
 IRK_revive_amurs_agricultural_sector: "Revive Amur's Agricultural Sector"
 IRK_revive_amurs_agricultural_sector_desc: "Previously under control of the vile fascists of the RFP, the fields of Amur have gone from being some of the most productive in Siberia to being a desolate wasteland due to the uprooting of the Soviet central planning of the region's farmlands. Ministry of Agriculture and Food have estimated the manpower needed to revitalize the yields and bring them back to pre-Siberian War levels and have suggested that we'll use the current state of hard-fought stability and peace to rotate some of our conscripted peasants back into their old work and draw on some of the recently liberated population belonging to less vital economic sectors to even out our numbers. While agriculture by itself is no longer a key factor in a modern industrialized economy as was the case during the birth of our Union, we cannot hope to fully transition into one when a good portion of our population can barely scrape by."
 IRK_expand_the_port_of_magadan: "Expand the Port of Magadan"
 IRK_expand_the_port_of_magadan_desc: "Magadan's importance to our economy cannot be understated. In order to open ourselves up to the global economy, we must first improve the harbor to increase its capacity for both imports and exports as well as expand our icebreaker fleet to the point where we can reliably keep the port open all year round. Once it's completed, we can embark on the next step of our Five Year Plan."
 IRK_rapid_factory_modernization: "Rapid Factory Modernization"
 IRK_rapid_factory_modernization_desc: "With our improved access to the outside world comes the obvious benefits of having easier access to industrial equipment. While our landlocked rivals in the west struggle to get their hands on modern machinery as they're surrounded by uncooperative rogue states, our access to the sea changes the situation entirely. With the recent expansion of Magadan's facilities, we're in a good position to import the kind of machinery we need to revitalize our industrial economy."
 IRK_revive_the_mining_industry: "Revive the Mining Industry"
 IRK_revive_the_mining_industry_desc: "Beneath the surface of Siberia lies vast, untapped riches. Coal, gold, diamonds, iron ore, and a myriad of valuable minerals are right at our fingertips, but sadly cannot currently be excavated due to many of our mines falling into disrepair during the anarchy. By importing equipment and schematics from abroad, we can undo years of decay in short order."
 IRK_trade_with_the_developing_world: "Trade with the Developing World"
 IRK_trade_with_the_developing_world_desc: "While our economy was never officially closed, it has understandably been struggling due to the anarchy putting development into a state of abject stasis. Despite the many disagreements that Yagoda and the Party factions have, this is one area where they see common ground as trade with friendly and neutral states in Asia and across the Pacific can work in harmony both with the old Bukharinite system and the coexistence between Marxism and capitalism envisioned by some of our newer economists. With products to offer the world and a profound need for goods to bolster our economy, we'll initiate efforts to restore trade ties with former partners in the developing world and seek out new trade ties as well."
 IRK_modernizing_the_irkutsk_hps: "Modernize the Irkutsk HPS"
 IRK_modernizing_the_irkutsk_hps_desc: "The turbines used in the Irkutsk HPS linger back to the days of the Siberian Plan. While not a direct target in any of the recent wars, the aftershocks caused by the fall of Moscow and the Siberian War can still be felt to this day. By purchasing equipment on the foreign markets and hiring experts to help us modernize the plants to the standards of this decade, the provisory capital of the Soviet Union will be ranked among the most important electricity production stations in all of Asia. Needless to say, this will go a long way to achieve the goals of our Five Year Plan by ensuring plentiful of electricity day and night, all year around for both common citizens, state industries and investors alike."
 IRK_the_economic_heart_of_siberia: "The Economic Heart of Siberia"
 IRK_the_economic_heart_of_siberia_desc: "Our renovation and revitalization of the current seat of Soviet power must not be a half-measure. As the most advanced city in the Soviet Union, Irkutsk will take the first steps into being a modern economy. Avoiding reckless marches into the unknown, we'll limit the Union's evolution into a more contemporary economic model to take the shape of gradual steps, starting out by tweaking the legal framework for businesses in the city as well as investing in the creation of state service companies. Whereas we relied on raw industrial strength in the past, the economy of the new Union will be known for its efficiency as well."
 IRK_the_open_coastal_city_of_magadan: "The Open Coastal City of Magadan"
 IRK_the_open_coastal_city_of_magadan_desc: "As we advance towards realizing the Yagodaschina, it's time that we put theory into practice. Magadan will be the first cite where we will initiate a full-scale experiment in our new economic theory of two systems co-existing in the Soviet Union, reaping the rewards of a more modern economy while preserving the Marxist ideals our revolution was founded on."
 IRK_the_industrial_harbor_of_magadan: "The Industrial Harbor of Magadan"
 IRK_the_industrial_harbor_of_magadan_desc: "With those seeking to betray the revolution and compromise with capitalism having lost the economic debate, it's time for us to move towards reaching the goals of our Five Year Plan- Through a heavy industrialization scheme that builds upon the successes of the Siberian Plan while also learning from its mistakes, we'll bring more prosperity to our Union."
 IRK_the_second_industrialization_wave: "The Second Industrialization Wave"
 IRK_the_second_industrialization_wave_desc: "In order to achieve our industrial goals, a second wave of investments into the state's heavy industry sector is needed. It'll be a broad push for industrial growth across the Union, seeing the construction and local modernizations of several factory complexes in all our major cities."
 IRK_expand_brigade_recruitment: "Expanded Brigade Recruitment"
 IRK_expand_brigade_recruitment_desc: "With war on the horizon, we might want to look into expanding our volunteer recruitment and lower the standards for the volunteers that we do accept as well as providing volunteers with easier travel to the Union. While the influx of spirited men and women of strong socialist convictions is undoubtedly going to strengthen us, it will put a further strain on our efforts to train our army."
 IRK_special_economic_sector: "Irkutsk Special Economic Sector"
 IRK_special_economic_sector_desc: "After taking the first step towards modernizing our temporary capital's economy, it's time to take the next one. Avoiding the mistake of taking a great leap forward, we'll limit the reform package to opening up parts of Irkutsk's central areas to foreign investments and provide generous legal and tax incentives to attract foreign capital with the state driving the push towards a service-based economic model for the city."
 IRK_yakutia_special_economic_province: "Yakutia Special Economic Province"
 IRK_yakutia_special_economic_province_desc: "Back during the early days of the NEP's implementation it wasn't unheard of for British and Japanese mining companies to invest in the Soviet Union. Yagoda believes that with the right tax incentives, Yakutia could become a hotbed for foreign mining companies seeking to establish themselves on Soviet soil. Naturally, we'll make sure that our most important strategic resources remain firmly under the control of the State."
 IRK_blagoveshchensk_special_economic_sector: "Blagoveshchensk Special Economic Sector"
 IRK_blagoveshchensk_special_economic_sector_desc: "Despite our many disagreements with the CPS in the past, recent developments have necessitated economic pragmatism towards the Sphere. Opening up Blagoveshchensk as a SES would thus be an ideal move, allowing us to expand our economy while also signaling our intentions to improve our ties with Japan. By allowing Japanese Zaibatsu to establish themselves in the city, we can turn it into one of Asia's great industrial hubs."
 IRK_petropavlovsk_kamchatsky_open_coastal_city: "Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky Open Coastal City"
 IRK_petropavlovsk_kamchatsky_open_coastal_city_desc: "With our efforts to approach the OFN bearing fruit, the Chairman believes that we need to strike while the iron is hot. As our closest territory to America, we'll declare Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky as an additional OCC and use state incentives to create an investment climate that's attractive to American technology companies. Naturally, we will arrange matters so that we can benefit from their expertise as well..."
 IRK_the_ninth_five_year_plan_state: "The Ninth Five Year Plan"
 IRK_the_ninth_five_year_plan_state_desc: "Chairman Yagoda's Eighth Five Year Plan has been a resounding success. The success of the Yagodaschina cannot be denied by anyone, for it was this measured approach to economics that not only saw our Union prosper again, but also allowed us to reclaim another portion of our Soviet Motherland from its illegitimate occupants. Now the time has come to launch an even more ambitious Five Year Plan - one that shall see us restore Soviet control throughout the Russian anarchy and beyond."
 IRK_third_industrialization_wave: "The Third Industrialization Wave"
 IRK_third_industrialization_wave_desc: "With our course set, we need to expand the industrialization plan beyond the great cities and allow the smaller cities to reap the rewards of Soviet industry. When we're done, every hamlet in the Far East will become a testament to the success of our laborers!"
 IRK_coal_mining_boom: "A Coal Mining Boom"
 IRK_coal_mining_boom_desc: "While those in the party that sought to undermine proper Marxist applications of economic theory speak of investments by foreign companies in the Soviet Union, we know that our strategic resources are too important to allow the forces of capital gain too strong a hold. That being said, as long as they're just merely under the ground it's hardly of any use to us. We'll expand our excavations of the South Yakutsk basins to bring more coal to fuel our industrial growth."
 IRK_increase_production_quotas: "Increased Production Quotas"
 IRK_increase_production_quotas_desc: "In order to achieve the goals set by our economists, it's become blatantly clear to us that we need to raise the production quotas in all state-owned factories. While unpopular, steps like this will be needed if we wish to avoid repeating the disastrous mistakes of the last administration."
 IRK_increase_industrial_trade: "Increased Industrial Trade"
 IRK_increase_industrial_trade_desc: "With our recent industrial expansions it's clear that we've made ourselves more competitive in the developing markets. By seeking to expand our trade deals with neutral states as well as the few handful of socialist states that still exist, we should be able to give a healthy infusion of cash into our state budget on a regular basis."
 IRK_the_ninth_five_year_plan_party: "The Ninth Five Year Plan"
 IRK_the_ninth_five_year_plan_party_desc: "The Eighth Five Year Plan has been a resounding success. Not only have we bested the internal opposition and charted our own path towards improving the lives of our Soviet citizens, but we've also managed the difficult feat of liberating another piece of the old Union as a direct result of our diligent work. There's no time to rest though as the party has already approved the framework for a Ninth Five Year Plan, one that will allow us to modernize our recently liberated Siberian territories to the west of our temporary capital. Forward!"
 IRK_the_great_siberian_highway_project: "The Great Siberian Highway Project"
 IRK_the_great_siberian_highway_project_desc: "The M53 was a planned highway project meant to link Irkutsk with Novosibirsk. Fallen on the wayside due to the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War and with its finished sections tarnished by the neglect of the many petty warlords that occupied the areas of land where stretches of this road still existed, it's truly in a sorry state. Our economists believe that with the right investments, we could turn the old vision into reality and link every major city of Central Siberia to our capital. A massive boon to our economy at times of peace, and an equally great benefit to our logistics should our friends in the west not surrender the rightful Soviet territories they occupy without a fight."
 IRK_novosibirsk_special_economic_sector: "Novosibirsk Special Economic Sector"
 IRK_novosibirsk_special_economic_sector_desc: "Novosibirsk is an ideal city to establish another SES. Its great industrial and technological capacities combined with its excellent airport makes it a perfect site for commercial and industrial investment. By opening it up to outside investors under a carefully controlled and planned framework, we'll be able to greatly enrich our Union while also reaping the benefits of the technologies that the foreign companies bring to the table when they establish themselves in the SES."
 IRK_kemerovos_palaces_of_industry: "Kemerovo's Palaces of Industry"
 IRK_kemerovos_palaces_of_industry_desc: "The mighty factories of Kemerovo are a testament to Soviet economic prowess, one that managed to survive several bloody wars and still go from strength to stunning strength. With this great city back under rightful Soviet control, we'll make it the lynchpin for our industrialization efforts in the region."
 IRK_western_companies_in_tomsk: "Western Companies in Tomsk"
 IRK_western_companies_in_tomsk_desc: "A great opportunity has arisen. Thanks to our improving ties with the OFN nations and the great scientific expertise that resided in the city of Tomsk, there's now talk of western medical companies seeking to establish themselves in the Soviet Union. If we accept, we can expect to be able to advance our own medical research sector as well."
 IRK_zaibatsu_in_krasnoyarsk: "Zaibatsu in Krasnoyarsk"
 IRK_zaibatsu_in_krasnoyarsk_desc: "Nissan, Toyota and other major Japanese car manufacturers have voiced interest in setting up factories in the industrial city of Krasnoyarsk.If we manage this situation correctly and apply the right kinds of protectionist measures on the national level while reaping the financial benefits on a local one, this could be a great boost to the Soviet automobile industry."
