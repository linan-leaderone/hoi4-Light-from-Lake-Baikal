  POLITICS_GEORGE_CADLE_PRICE:0 "As one head falls, two more take its place. That lesson agonisingly carves itself into the raw face of George Cadie Price's nation. Many in Belize hoped that the fall of the British Empire to the unflinching iron storm of Hitler's Blitzkrieg would herald the final emancipation of its inhabitants from the master's whip of Imperialism - an illusion ended by the animalistic jerking of a putrefying corpse. Canada, fat with refugees fleeing the chaos of Europe, has decided to force itself upon Belize where it claims to administer in the name of the Queen.\n\nPerhaps the greatest insult is their strict adherence to God - claiming that their Monarch is divinely ordained, as opposed to the false prophets in blasphemous courts. They demand Belize look them in the eye and swear that this century-long torture is sacrosanct. They enslave Belize and call it justified. They believe that Belize is better off in chains. Would He allow Ramses to crush the Jews if they were "better off"?\n\nNo. Belize must, can and should carve its destiny, not burdened by its past but hopeful for its future. Under Price, Independence will not be easy, fulfilling or peaceful. But it will be honest. To a nation lied to for its entire life, what is more precious than truth?"
  POLITICS_PHILIP_GOLDSON:0 "The people of Belize are beginning to see the light of independence at the end of a dark tunnel of British-Canadian subjugation and Guatemalan intimidation, and the people of Belize have chosen Philip Goldson to guide them towards it, wielding the torch of liberalism, cautiously guiding them so as to not squander their only chance at escape.\n\nBorn in Belize city in 1923, Goldson has spent his whole life advocating for independence and the plight of those around him, working as an editor for nationalist newspapers like the Belize Billboard and as the National Organizer for The General Workers Union. Though what separates him and his National Independence Party from those that have come before him is a vision for an international, independent Belize - one that works with the other free democracies of the world hand-in-hand in the fight against tyranny, and against an aggressive Guatemala to the west that threatens to snuff out the flame of it's freedom at first light."


  BLZ_A_Capital_Devastated:0 "A Capital Devastated"
  BLZ_A_Capital_Devastated_desc:0 "The people of Belize City remember Hurricane Hattie. There was rain and wind that whistled through the dark streets. Then the water began to rise. It rose until every street became a black river. The tide came in and swept away thousands of homes in the night.\n\nToday, Belize City is a place destroyed. While only a few hundred lost their lives, over seventy percent of all buildings in the capital have been damaged or destroyed, crippling Belize and its economy. While a few rebuild, many more are discussing whether to found a new city inland that will be protected from the forces of nature."
  BLZ_A_New_Home:0 "A New Home"
  BLZ_A_New_Home_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Hurricane Hattie, the people of Belize were forced to beg for aid from their partners in the OFN. Faced with the enormity of suffering there, the Government of Canada has agreed to provide Belize with the funding to address the worst of its suffering. It has also agreed to support the construction of a new capital—Belmopan.\n\nNow, miles away from the ruins of Belize City, construction is underway. The nation's government is determined to achieve a new start for itself and for its people."
  BLZ_A_City_Upon_A_Hill:0 "A City Upon a Hill"
  BLZ_A_City_Upon_A_Hill_desc:0 "After years of work and millions of dollars in investments, the city of Belmopan has been completed. While the city sports certain design flourishes—a central ring road, ample parkland, and architecture inspired by Mayan temples—the city's real strength lies in its location.\n\nStanding 75 meters above water and protected by hills and rainforest, Belmopan is secure against the forces of Mother Nature. While time will tell how Belize develops from here, the new city stands as a testament to the strength and resilience of the Belizean people."
  BLZ_Radical_Independence_Movement:0 "Radical Independence Movement"
  BLZ_Radical_Independence_Movement_desc:0 "The Union Jack is burning.\n\nAll across Belize, there are demonstrations of dissatisfaction with the old order. Black nationalists rally against the remnants of British rule. Men like George Cadle Price and Philip Goldson speak out against the decaying system around them. The entire country shouts with one voice against its colonial status. The only questions that remain are how far will "British Honduras" go to shed its name, what process this work will take, and whether it will take place through peace or violence."
  BLZ_A_Nation_Under_Siege:0 "A Nation Under Siege"
  BLZ_A_Nation_Under_Siege_desc:0 "There is, perhaps, one thing that looms as large as the British crown in Belize: the constant and overwhelming threat posed by Guatemala. Considering British Honduras as a wayward province separated from the motherland by a now-defeated European power, many Guatemalan politicians have urged their leaders to invade Belize and restore their nation's borders. With no standing army of their own, it is only because of the OFN's security guarantees that the country can retain its tenuous independence."
  BLZ_A_Colonial_Vacuum:0 "The Colonial Vacuum"
  BLZ_A_Colonial_Vacuum_desc:0 "When the British Isles fell beneath the wings of the Nazi eagle, its colonial empire was thrown into disarray. Belize was one of these places and it now finds itself trapped in accommodations hastily devised almost two decades ago.\n\nWhile it swears allegiance to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II and the shambling corpse that is her royal house, in all practical affairs the Government of Belize reports directly to the Government of Canada. This unfortunate arrangement leaves both parties uneasy and longing, desperately, for escape."
