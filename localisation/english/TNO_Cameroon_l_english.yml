 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_FELIX_ROLAND_MOUMIE_DESC: "Africa is not African. For the last two hundred years, Africa has been soiled, defiled and butchered by vampiric "humanitarians" from Europe who - in their infinite wisdom - decided to carve arbitrary lines of influence over a millennium of local history. By rifle, cash or duplicitous treaty, they have turned an entire continent into a living testament to Man's endless greed and how far Capitalism will go to quench its Imperial visions. Millions will die so a meagre bottom line can be nourished - because to the banker, there is no alternative.\n\nThe era that Félix-Roland Moumié lives in is - to the contrary of many of his compatriots - not the horrific apex of European bondage over Africa but the last, ragged curse spat out by a dying institution. From the barbed-wire labyrinth of Hüttig's death camps to the near-annihilation of the native Libyans in Italian North Africa, Colonialism seems intent on taking the entire continent down with it. They will not succeed. The only way that Africa can take back its identity is by sheer and unrelenting force.\n\nWhen the coloniser is driven from their plantations screaming, and the chains of Capitalism shatters upon the head of its masters, only then will Africa be African. When petty tribal disputes are forever silenced, only then Africa will be African. When justice and freedom are given to all men, only then will Africa take back what is lost.\n\nBecause for Félix-Roland Moumié, the only one who can free Africa - is the African. Ô Afrique, Berceau de nos Ancêtres."

 ### Ideas ###
 CAO_ACA: "African Continental Army"
 CAO_ACA_desc: "The ACA's shining moments were during the Zentralafrika Crisis back in the 1950s, when it proved itself a powerful fighting force. Those glory days are gone, and the army is now a heap of different militias, disorderly command, and obsolete equipment, bound together by an ineffective command structure. The army is clearly overstretched and aging rapidly, falling into irrelevance amongst the colonial forces in the region."
 CAO_ACA_2: "African Continental Army"
 CAO_ACA_2_desc: "West Africa rises.\n\nThe African Continental Army begins to reconstitute, and shape itself to be an effective vanguard against the imperialists that lurk at our gates. Each day the ranks of the Continental Army swell; filled with those seeking liberation, who will declare a simple message to the world.\n\n"No more.""
 CAO_ACA_3: "African Continental Army"
 CAO_ACA_3_desc: "We have surpassed all who have come before.\n\nNo more is the Continental Army an inexperienced defense force, but a strong and capable military who only grows more experienced. We march, and prepare to bring a final death to imperialism.\n\nWest Africa will be liberated. The rest of the continent will follow."

 CAO_idea_pan_african_vanguard: "Pan-African Vanguard"
 CAO_idea_pan_african_vanguard_desc: "The concept of Pan-Africanism may not have originated in Cameroon, but Cameroon has adopted Pan-Africanism as its purpose. The Vanguard sees Africa for what it is: a playground for the global superpowers, a nightmare for all native Africans under an imperial boot. Cameroon promises to liberate all Africans from colonial oppression and the suffering of unnatural, inhuman democracy. The Vanguard will cloak the continent in an everlasting freedom for Africans alone, or it will die trying."
 CAO_idea_tense_borders: "Tense Borders"
 CAO_idea_tense_borders_desc: "Cameroon lies in a sea of anarchy and destruction. From Zentralafrika in the southeast to Yorubaland in the west, with rebellious groups thriving in-between, Cameroon's borders are anything but secure. Efforts to secure the wild border are proving too big a drain on manpower and the economy, but the border must be secure for Cameroon to survive. If the situation is not handled soon, the country is sure to collapse."
 CAO_idea_political_rivalries: "Political Rivalries"
 CAO_idea_political_rivalries_desc: "The Parti de la Libération Africaine maintains an image of unity within Cameroon, but the organization is far from unified. Rivals of many political backgrounds vie for control of the party, including the pro-centralization faction of Félix-Roland Moumié, the federalists of Ruben Um Nyobè, the militarists, and the republicans. Each faction consolidates power within the party, and with some factions forming militias, one faction must come out on top to determine Cameroon's ultimate destiny."
 CAO_idea_egyptian_intelligence: "Egyptian Snooping"

 CAO_idea_mano_blitz: "The Mano Campaign"
 CAO_idea_mano_blitz_desc: "After centuries of foreign oppression, exploitation and humiliation, the fate of Western Africa now falls to us; here we make our last stand for the final liberation of our people! No longer will we stand by while the western imperialists and their Yankee moneymen are allowed to abuse our homeland! Exalt, Children of the Homeland! The Heavens have heard your cries and you shall be ignored no more! Onward, soldiers! Strike Hard, Strike Fast, Strike True! Let the shadow of the jungle be their tomb!"

 CAOnews.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Cameroon Collapses!"
 CAOnews.1.desc: "Ever since their crushing defeat at the hands of the anti-PALF coalition, the Cameroonian African State has teetered on the verge of collapse. The Pan-African Dream, so espoused by would-be revolutionaries, was abandoned by those who it most wanted to help. The Africans. Now, for the fledgling state, that Dream is about to enter its death throes - once and for all.\n\nToday, the world can only bathe in the fires of the African Inferno. The leader of the internal opposition of Cameroon, Ahmadou Ahidjo has forcibly taken the reins of power over the state. While some pledge their loyalty to him, many throughout the nation have taken up arms, with various ethnic minorities seizing the chance to declare their independence. Now, Cameroon marches to war. This time against itself."
 CAOnews.1.a: "Pan-Africanism. A dream so dear, yet so far away."

 CAOnews.2.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Biafra Prevails!"
 CAOnews.2.desc: "This morning, reports of an apparent ceasefire between the Nigerian militias and the Igbo fighters that dominate the Western Bank of the Niger Delta have leaked out of the region, with a formal declaration quickly following. The war has been particularly brutal for the people in the region. War crimes and atrocities have been committed by both sides, with the slaughter of whole villages inhabited by thousands being a common sight throughout the conflict.\n\nNow, peace is on the horizon. President of the Republic of Biafra, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, promises a new era of African Democracy by Africans and for Africans. Another promise is to open up the ports of Biafra to all those that would wish to trade there. Whatever comes next for Biafra, it seems that they may finally put down their weapons for good."
 CAOnews.2.a: "The Torch of Democracy has been lit by the dying flames of Pan-Africanism."
