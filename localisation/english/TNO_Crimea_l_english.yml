 ### Leaders ###
 CRI_Franz_Maierhofer:0 "Franz Maierhofer"
 POLITICS_FRANZ_MAIERHOFER_DESC: "As the Slavic people advance in all directions, Franz Maierhofer cannot help but remember the Battle of Lipetsk. It was in that battle that Maierhofer was nearly left to bleed out, his torso pierced by rifle fire. In that moment, he felt a true despair, something that would take a decade to fully numb. It's coming back now.\n\nMaierhofer recovered from that day, to be certain. Back at home, Maierhofer was rewarded a Knight's Cross and a respectable post in Crimea - with another decade, he crawled back up to the rank of Gauleiter. But that bullet is still between layers of flesh in his torso, and at times he can feel it, an alien body trapped within him.\n\nThe post of Gauleiter has, until now, not been especially strenuous. With colonization dealt with by better men, Maierhofer has spent his time in Crimea doing what he does best - ideological puffery, the bread and butter of the Crimean colonizer clade. The Gauleiter expected his work to be simple, coasting off a thousand-year Reich.\n\nNow, he stands with whatever men he can muster upon the Dnipro, and prays."

 ### National Spirits ###
 CRI_the_great_panic:0 "The Great Panic"
 CRI_the_great_panic_desc: "Gotenland was once marketed to Germans as the safe and cheap way to explore the east, the pacified, docile hub of Eastern commerce. In its heyday, the territory was a haven for tourism and settlement, a lone shining star in the ailing Generalplan Ost.\n\nThe rise of powerful partisans just across the Dnieper has ended this reputation. Even with so much information about the conflict censored or twisted, local Germans have heard of the partisans' continued successes, and they are preparing for the worst. Flights out of Theodorichshafen are continually booked. Refugee camps have formed across the Kerch strait. Investment, private and public, has flatlined. Gotenland now appears like the rest of the East - dangerous, unprofitable, and doomed to stagnation."

 CRI_the_crimean_clade:0 "The Crimean Clade"
 CRI_the_crimean_clade_desc: "The administration of Gotenland has been defined by its particular breed of followers. The NSDAP in Gotenland has trended towards the radical, the motivated, and the odd. Similar to previous expansions into Austria and Poland, the need for manpower and the ethics of settlement opened the gates to more unseemly fascists. Those who came to Crimea were often fiercely devoted, yet languishing within the wider party for any number of reasons. In Gotenland, hundreds of miles from their Gaus and central offices, the blotches on their records faded into history.\n\nWhether disgraced, dismissed, or merely disturbed, those in the Crimean Clade are bound together by their irregularities. Now, those bonds will be tested by the flames of war."

 CRI_dug_behind_the_dnieper:0 "Dug Behind The Dnieper"
 CRI_dug_behind_the_dnieper_desc: "The Reichsgau Gotenland may be in an inopportune situation, but Gleichschaltung structure is uniquely able to respond to such an emergency. Already, Gauleiter Maierhofer has utilized his near-absolute power, with the help of SS and Wehrmacht leaders, to begin using whatever resources remain in Crimea to further defend against a possible "bandit" incursion.\n\nThough the defenses are hardly impervious given the limited resources and intelligence available, they have at least made Gotenland a nuisance to be dealt with after the Reichskommissariat proper. All they can do is buy time, but they have at least served this purpose."
