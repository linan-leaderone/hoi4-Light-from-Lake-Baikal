 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_ANDREY_VLASOV_DESC: "The very name of Andrey Andreyevich Vlasov, the turncoat Red Army general, remains a sensitive topic for many Russians. To his few supporters, Vlasov is a modern-day Ivan Kalita, a visionary ruler who wisely submitted to a militarily superior conqueror, then used their patronage to gain a foothold for a powerful and independent Russian state in the future. For most of the former Soviet citizens, however, his name is associated with the most heinous betrayal, comparable to that of Judas. Of course, the real character of Vlasov is far less poetic than that.\n\nIt is hard to say whether the disgraced general was driven by his sincere desire to pierce the Red menace with German bayonets or a simple urge to survive when he allied himself with the Nazis; but whatever motive he had, the German high command never considered him a noteworthy ally, only allowing him to silently gaze upon his country being trampled beneath the German boot from well behind the front lines.\n\nThe last chance for Vlasov to redeem himself both in the eyes of Germans and the eyes of the Russian people appeared during the West Russian War, when his Russian Liberation Army helped turn the tide against the West Russian Revolutionary Front's offensive. Even though it was Vlasov who helped beat back the Soviets, obtaining his own domain in Samara in the aftermath, the Germans still saw him as little more than a dog to be kept on a short chain and closely watched. Humiliated by his masters and unpopular among his once-trustworthy officers, who have started to view his servile demeanor an obstacle to liberating Russia, Vlasov remains a weak and isolated figure who can only hope that reclaiming Russia will absolve his miserable title of a loathsome traitor."

 POLITICS_MILETIY_ZYKOV_DESC: "It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Miletiy Alexandrovich Zykov has been the heart and the conscience of the Russian Liberation Movement - if one can call such a scattered congregation of Vlasovite generals and civilian figures that was assembled under the auspices of the Nazi invaders a 'movement.' Recognized for his talent as a propagandist, Zykov was the person who shaped the ideology of the Russian Liberation Army and put forward the democratic ideals that proved to be so important in the struggle against the Soviet tyranny. Even if those ideals were obscured by the necessities of war, Zykov consistently espoused his support for renewed Russian democracy and provided much-needed legitimacy to the otherwise doomed cause of serving the occupants and the occupied alike.\n\nThe past and true motives of Zykov remain an unresolvable enigma even to his colleagues. His contradictory, often nonsensical comments about himself only further widen the web of rumors that has enveloped his background. Claiming to be a former adjutant of Nikolai Bukharin and supporter of the Marxist thought, Zykov prefers to imagine himself as an adherent of Russian republicanism who saw the inevitable failure of Bolshevism. Meanwhile, his numerous opponents within the KONR depict Zykov as a dishonest opportunist, a lowly Bolshevik Jewish writer who defected to the ROA only to save his skin and has since capitalized on a populist appeal and an idealistic facade to expand his personal influence.\n\nBeing one of the closest people to Andrey Vlasov and one of his most avid supporters, Zykov achieved the favor of the old General to pursue his own bid for power in the ROA after Vlasov's death. Whenever his beliefs lie, he now has to trial them between the hammer of the old guard resisting his seditious rhetoric and the anvil of his share and burden as a traitor."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_BUNYACHENKO_DESC: "Few men have contributed as much to the success of the Russian Liberation Army as much as Sergey Kuzmich Bunyachenko. A soldier of the Red Army since the age of 16, he saw combat in more fronts and battles than most, both in the Russian Civil War and in the Second World War. He would be a leading commander in the Caucasus, yet would find difficulty in turning the tide of war. Back at home, Bukharin's regime found him as a perfect scapegoat to blame the failures of the Red Army on, even if he was not the one to blame for the complete failure of the Soviet Union to defend itself. Soon, though, during a brave counter-attack, his division would be encircled and he would be captured.\n\nBunyachenko would remain in a penal colony separated from society until the infamous West Russian War. That was when he would request from the government he was at the mercy of to join in the fight against the WRRF and avenge the communists, who he harbored so much hatred for. He would fight bravely on the side of Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Army, until the ROA coalesced into its own warlord state in Samara. There, he would play a key role in governing the region and raising a proper military. This would eventually earn him a high position in the government, becoming Minister of Defense.\n\nWith the death of Vlasov, Bunyachenko has managed to rise to power in Samara. A militarist, Bunyachenko will not stop until the communists, and perhaps the Germans to the west as well, are dealt with. As the head of the KONR, he is glad to use it as long as it serves its interests. However, should he deem the committee to be an ineffective organ, Bunyachenko might have no problem with assuming control."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_BUNYACHENKO_70S_DESC: "Sergey Kuzmich Bunyachenko's life has been one of war without end. Having done the impossible and secured all of Russia under his control, Bunyachenko now fights a final, terrible struggle: the battle for legacy.\n\nUnder his watch an ordered society has taken shape within Russia. For many, President Bunyachenko is the lawgiver, the man who has given them homes, given their children schools, given their elderly parents pensions. His most loyal supporters are found within the ROA, the once despised German organized militia Bunyachenko found himself helping to lead during the West Russian War. For the ROA veterans Bunyachenko has brought them respect, purpose, and the dream of going home, of going west.\n\nFor many, this legacy of hope and progress rests precariously on a bed of lies, blood and ashes. Thousands of people once aligned with communist factions have disappeared. They are joined each week by dozens of those who agitate for workers' rights, for democracy, for accountability by a government and President who sees the population as naught but cogs within a military-industrial complex gone out of control. His harshest critics mock the former German dog as having replicated Moskowien's unfree society, at a much larger scale.\n\nSergey Bunyachenko fights for legacy. He dreams of washing the sins of his past, of being remembered as one of Russia's greatest patriots instead of as one of its greatest traitors. Yet as the weight of years grows on his shoulders, the military President increasingly fears that no man can be truly free from the crimes of the past. No matter what, however, Bunyachenko stands tall. He will face his fate heads on, fighting for his legacy until the very end."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_OKTAN_DESC: "Charitably described as a 'complete bastard', Mikhail Alexandrovich Ilinich's ascendancy to the position of Chairman of the KONR marks the beginning of a new and dark chapter in Russia's story. Known by his pseudonym Oktan, he's cynical, manipulative and professing a slavish loyalty to the Reich, it is no surprise that he found his calling in managing the unruly Russians on behalf of his masters - first as a newspaper editor and self-proclaimed governor, then as chief propagandist of the KONR. Under his supervision, propaganda efforts after the West Russian War were ramped up tenfold, reeling in thousands of fervently anti-Bolshevik followers while driving out those loyal to a feeble, 'free' vision of Russia.\n\nFew would have foreseen his sudden rise to power, however. Once, Oktan was known as little more than a vicious, treasonous, anti-semitic drunk. Even in the early days, Oktan despised Vlasov for his softness and lack of radicalism, alienating the would-be dictator from his colleagues. His snivelling appeasement of the Germans and desperation to enter the ranks of the Russian Liberation Army's leadership ensured that when he finally began to climb the ranks, he faced staunch opposition from the camps of Zykov and Bunyachenko. His rivals spared no effort informing the people of his cowardice, laziness and lecherous conduct, but that effort came to naught.\n\nNow, they say nothing. Those who dare to whisper of Oktan's disloyalty to the Smolensk Declaration and the principles of the KONR soon find themselves arrested to face 're-education' - or worse. Having learned much from his past friendship with the Gestapo, Oktan has proven merciless and brutal in the suppression of his opposition and unwillingness to compromise on anything that might jeopardize his absolute rule. As a man who once enjoyed the full confidence of the Germans, there is no telling what horrors Oktan's rule might have in store for the people of Russia."

 POLITICS_VIKTOR_POLYAKOV_DESC: "Much like his colleague to the northwest, Viktor Nikolayevich Polyakov was a simple factory director before power was thrust upon him. Born in Siberia, he found himself in the right - or wrong - spot at the right time to be sent as an industrial advisor of a rapidly collapsing WRRF to the city of Samara on the banks of the Volga, and for the next few years, that was where he operated. Polyakov rose fast in the vehicle industry, even competing against Katushev in the same market.\n\nIn the end, that profession was what made him well known in the city, and when the time came, got him elected as the leader of the local People's Assembly and mayor of Samara. Polyakov now balances a life of economics and governing a primitive and fragile democracy in accord with North Russia's wishes.\n\nWhile ruling as a warlord can be hard for someone with little experience in that regard, Polyakov knows to turn to the fellow magnate in Nizhny Novgorod when things really get tough."

 ### Ideas ###
 SAM_german_bootlickers: "German Bootlickers"
 SAM_german_bootlickers_desc: "As much as we like to claim that we are a spearhead for the Liberation of Russia from under the Red Yoke of Bolshevism, everybody considers us an extension of German influence over the Motherland, and correspondingly hate us for it. Unfortunately, hatred by the Russian people does not correspond to love from our former German masters, who have written us off as mutinous rabble."
 SAM_The_Smolensk_Manifesto: "The Smolensk Manifesto"
 SAM_The_Smolensk_Manifesto_desc: "Proof of the ROA's legitimacy to a select few, and a proof of their irredeemable treachery for all else. The Manifesto was issued during the West Russian War, declaring the ROA's opposition to communism in Russia and hopes for a new republic to replace the Soviet Union. Despite its creation by the hands of desperate German propagandists, the manifesto has remained a core component of our claim to legitimacy."
 SAM_The_Samara_Manifesto: "The Samara Manifesto"
 SAM_The_Samara_Manifesto_desc: "In order to legitimize the ROA as an organization that hopes to unite the Russian people under one banner, the obsolete Smolensk Declaration has been discarded, and a new declaration, titled the Samara Manifesto, has been written. This declaration denounces foreign influence within Russian politics and pledges to make Russia whole under a strong and independent government."
 SAM_German_Military_Training: "German Military Training"
 SAM_German_Military_Training_desc: "Back when the ROA was a mere colonial militia, the Germans insisted on imposing military training and savage discipline onto their subhuman auxiliaries. The West Russian War saw the army's numbers swell with former Red Army veterans, and their mettle tested in desperate battles. As such, the ROA is one of the few professional militaries in Western Russia."
 SAM_Turncoat_General: "Turncoat General"
 SAM_Turncoat_General_desc: "Our generals and officers share little in common beyond their past as Germans prisoners of war and a willingness to work with the Germans. Some were driven by a hatred of the Red Army or anger at bad treatment, real or imagined. Others simply saw it as the way out of a prisoners' camp. No matter the reason, and no matter how skilled they are, our generals' treason to the Russian people make them widely detested men."

 SAM_Village_Councils: "Village Councils"
 SAM_Village_Councils_desc: "Rural Russia has long looked to itself for governance. Communes remain the principal government apparatus at the local level.\n\nA system of military attachés to village councils has been developed. Slowly but surely, local communities are moving away from seeing garrisons as predatory or parasitic organizations. In turn local commanders are being scrutinized more and more for their ability to maintain peace and prosperity within their assigned area."
 SAM_Bread_for_All: "Bread for All"
 SAM_Bread_for_All_desc: "The bare minimum for any man or woman to survive is nourishment. While this will put a dent into our resources, providing our people the bare minimum isn't just a necessity, but a duty. If the people of Samara are to face the future tribulations ahead, it must be with a full belly."
 SAM_Soup_for_Service: "Soup for Service"
 SAM_Soup_for_Service_desc: "Our resources are stretched thin as is, and it's no time for compassion or charity. Simply put, those that put the work, will be given what is due. Those that don't, or leech from us, will not. Food is a privilege to those that deserve it, and it's due that people are reminded of that."
 SAM_slipped_leash: "Slipped Leash"
 SAM_slipped_leash_desc: "Well, well, would you look at this; the German rulership decayed enough to finally let us assert ourselves as a power in our own right. This golden opportunity will not be left to go to waste; our highly-trained force will reach out, unite the other Russian warlords then drive out the Teutons with their own weapons! They will rue the day they stepped foot into Russia when they see their very own former lapdogs leading the charge against them!"
 SAM_ROA_Over_the_Airwaves: "ROA Over the Airwaves"
 SAM_Bureaucratic_Allies_idea: "Bureaucratic Allies"
 SAM_Bureaucratic_Allies_idea_desc: "It is said the right man in the right place makes all the difference in the world. The cooperation between us and the Officer Committee, once dominated by bickering and red tape walling, now is smooth sailing, our requests and proposals being processed at a lightning speed. It is not anymore a matter if our necessities will be attended by the officers, but a when."
 SAM_Renewed_Military_Trust: "Renewed Military Trust"
 SAM_Renewed_Military_Trust_desc: "The Samaran government has never been popular. At best, our people grudgingly tolerated us for our anti-bandit efforts.\n\nThings have begun changing for the better. Stricter discipline for soldiers as well as an ongoing anti-corruption campaign have shown the population that the days of army officers lording over peasants like boyars of old are ending. People now hope they can trust their army."

 SAM_Russia_in_my_Sights: "Russia In Our Sights"
 SAM_Russia_in_my_Sights_desc: "Russia is ripe for the taking, and there's no time to be lost. Under the allure of profit and wealth, Oktan will unleash the dogs of war upon West Russia. Time is wasting, and there's profit to be made."

 SAM_gunsmithing2: "State of Art Weaponry"
 SAM_gunsmithing2_desc: "Past are the days that we were but one of many rump states across this land. We are fulfilling the task we set to do since the Patriotic War.

No longer will the ROA soldier deal with makeshift, old guns from the '40s, and smuggled supplies, but with genuine Russian equipment. While the dream of a fully united Russia under her truthful sons and daughters is a distant dream, the end of the contemptible warlords around us is a reality we live in now, and a fact if we hold steadfast."

In the meantime the Army of Liberation itself has seen reforms meant to better integrate its Moskowien originating core with local recruits."
 SAM_The_Committee_Plan_Completed: "The Committee Plan Complete"
 SAM_The_Committee_Plan_Completed_desc: "Where once laid apathy and stillness, there is momentum. Every able worker works dutifully, and our industry flourishes, producing more daily.

Whatever legitimacy he possesses, the German bombings strip away. The sad man grows older, buried under the weight of history and the judgement of those outside his borders. Yet he has not yet given up, for the upcoming troubles in Germany may signal his one last chance.\n\nFor now, his greatest quality is that he is able to maintain a coalition. The various generals like him better than they like one another and the people have found his rule fair if not particularly noteworthy. There are worse places in Russia than Samara, certainly. But if Vlasov is to serve as a guide to a renewed Russia, he must begin anew his consolidation of military and popular support."

 SAM_Our_Voice: "Our Voice"
 SAM_Our_Voice_desc: "Our consolidation effort goes through Miletiy Zykov. Zykov is difficult to describe, for much of his past is cloaked in mystery. Few claim to know where he comes from. The man himself claims to have been a leading ideologue in the opposition to the Soviet government, and he has indeed shown himself to be a highly talented public speaker and propagandist. His effort to reach the people of Russia in general, and Samara in particular, have done much to generate what few shreds of good reputation we possess. Zykov is among the greatest advocates of freedom and democracy in our officer corps, and he has built himself a small clique around this position. His aim is not merely to free Russia from both warlordism and from the Germans, but to bring forth a new, carefully supervised democracy. To many militarists in our government, he is a soft man. To German loyalists, he is a decadent parasite intent on betraying our German benefactors.\n\nFew are sure where Zykov comes from, and few can claim to know his real endgame. But at this critical juncture, his skills in propaganda are irreplaceable. We need his voice as the army of liberation marches onwards."

 SAM_Our_General: "Our General"
 SAM_Our_General_desc: "There is in theory a hierarchy to the National Liberation Army, with Vlasov at the top and a range of officers neatly arrayed below him. In practice, however, the opinion of the officer corps as a whole is critical to our endeavors. And the officer corps and its committee has a champion in Sergey Bunyachenko. A former Soviet officer, Bunyachenko was captured by the Germans in the Second World War and thrown into a penal colony for his troubles. Few in Russia mourned his fate, as he was widely blamed by the Soviet leadership for losing several critical battles in the opening stages of the war.\n\nIn the dark days of the West Russian War, Bunyachenko was offered a way out of his jail sentence: join the Russian Army of National Liberation and push the WRRF back. Angry at the Soviet leadership and desperate to leave his prison, Bunyachenko agreed, and quickly rose through the rank of the National Liberation Army. Bunyachenko is widely seen as a capable officer, beloved by the men for standing up for their ideas. The general cares for little but the reunification of Russia, the annihilation of the Soviet remnant, and most of all, the downfall of Germany."

 SAM_Their_Puppet: "Their Puppet"
 SAM_Their_Puppet_desc: "Mikhail Oktan is a hard man to his supporters, and a broken man to others. He has little sympathy for the communist regime, defeated twice in fifteen years by the Germans. He is not a monarchist, or a democrat, for the weakness of these past regimes has brought Russia into the shackles of the failed communist regime.\n\nThe Germans have become the masters of Europe, and what of it? For Oktan and his supporters, Berlin has crushed every Jewish regime that had obscured man's progress. Vlasov and his ilk might see the Germans as means to an end, but Oktan knows better. He sees Vlasov as a broken, pathetic man squirming to get out from under the German shadow.\n\nMikhail Oktan is happy to collaborate with Germany. He sees no greater purpose than helping to enforce the German will upon the ruins of the Soviet Union, and his eager collaboration has let him secure many contacts in RK Moskowien and beyond. Mikhail Oktan may be a hard man, or a broken man, but he is certainly a dangerous man. And an essential one, for through him Samara secures essential supplies from the German ogre."

 SAM_It_Never_Ends: "It Never Ends"
 SAM_It_Never_Ends_desc: "The sound of planes overhead has become a regular occurrence for those in West Russia to the point we have learned to plan around them, bar the occasional break from their bombing schedule or unexpected change in target. Yet, the sound of a screaming payload landing on our territory is still a terror for our people. It is an agony we can only endure.\n\nAnd yet, the winds of change might still be blowing. Were Germany to fall into trouble of its own, perhaps these might be the last months of the accursed terror bombings? As such, an officers' conference has been gathered to discuss how best to prepare for the upcoming window of opportunity. Various factions make their case to Vlasov and other officers.\n\nIn the meantime, regular salvaging efforts continue. Buildings torn down by the war machine see their components moved to new places. The odd supply convoy used as target practice is pushed out of the road so others may pass. Life in Russia goes on."

 SAM_Take_What_is_There: "Take What Is There"
 SAM_Take_What_is_There_desc: "At the conference, Zykov and his supporters have fiercely defended their position on both ideological and coldly pragmatic grounds.\n\nTheir argument goes like this: increasing taxes on the population will drive it further away from us, and the Army of National Liberation can scarcely afford to lose what few hints of goodwill it still has. Accepting more German weapons is also not a good plan, as our soldiers must be seen and known as liberators of Russia, instead of mere German puppets. Thus, the best, and hardest path according to Zykov is to make do with what we have. This will leave us weaker in the short term. But being loved by our people and embraced by those we liberate will be incredibly helpful."

 SAM_Scavenge_for_Vehicles: "Scavenge for Vehicles"
 SAM_Scavenge_for_Vehicles_desc: "Zykov might have convinced the rest of the officer corps and its various factions not to increase supply requisition on the people, nor supply demands to the Germans, but there is still a tangible shortage in almost everything. The most pressing concern is our ever dwindling pool of motorized vehicles. Without much native industry and with limited import capacities, our fleet of trucks and armored vehicles melts by the day.\n\nOur men have been sent to scour the countryside for anything that might roll downhill. Tractors that peasants have given up on, military cars and trucks that have been abandoned in the wood, whatever broken down German or Soviet tank hidden in marshes or forests. This iron harvest will be a meager one, and most of what we find will likely be useless. But any quantity of engine blocks and armor plate we can scrounge up will be useful for the cause."

 SAM_Looking_For_Treasure: "Looking for Treasure"
 SAM_Looking_For_Treasure_desc: "With the drain on our vehicle fleet somewhat arrested, our soldiers are moving their efforts to whatever else can be lifted and carted off to our bases. Forgotten German or Soviet supply caches, farms abandoned by fleeing or dead peasants, downed German planes, buried Tsarist gold...\n\nThe pile of junk brought back to the bases is sifted through by the men. Whatever we can use is stashed away. Among the rest, whatever has a monetary value is hauled to convoys headed for the Moskowien border, where black market traders will give us a fraction of its price for our trouble. Selling abandoned cuckoo clocks and teapots will not make us rich men, but anything we can trade on the black market for supplies will still prove to be of value.\n\nTo cheer up the soldiers, fifteen percent of every discovery's value Is given to the men directly to encourage them to search. Of course, any soldier that steals from civilians to increase his stash shall be shot. The idea is to avoid angering them further, not use them to pad our retirement funds."

 SAM_Take_What_is_Ours: "Take What Is Ours"
 SAM_Take_What_is_Ours_desc: "Bunyachenko and a sizable fraction of the officer corps have rejected Zykov's idea of sparing the population further taxes. It's unfair for the soldiers to risk their life and live on stale rations as the people of Samara live in peace and quiet. The citizens must be better integrated into our governmental structure, to enable them to give their fair shake. They've had the luck of being among the first to be liberated by the KONR, and they should be aware of this.\n\nBunyachenko's plan is thus to organize a detailed census. Once the population of every village and community is known to us, we can begin estimating how closely the sheep can be shorn without injuring them. This is a big undertaking, and it will occupy most of our soldiers as well as all of our men with accounting skills. But the reward will be well worth it."

 SAM_The_People_Provide: "The People Provide"
 SAM_The_People_Provide_desc: "Crates of food. Bags of grain. Boxes of ammunition. Scavenged rifles. It's all coming in!\n\nWith little use for money in the past decade, many have chosen to pay their taxes in kind to their local garrison. Military accounts are present at every step of the way to ensure that every citizen is giving their fair due to the army: enough of their surplus for the army to be fed, but not enough taxes as to ruin the citizen.\n\nSome of our poorer citizens have instead given time to the army, paying their dues through twice a month corvees. Their time has been centered in the workshop where guns and ammo are manufactured. Others have cleared new plot of land to grow food for soldiers on. A few have just been drafted as reservists, and given a little food for their troubles.\n\nAs they want to, many complain about the rise in taxes. But not too loudly, however, for the taxman is also the military keeping order."

 SAM_The_Russian_People_Deliver_Us: "The Russian People Deliver Us"
 SAM_The_Russian_People_Deliver_Us_desc: "Our men have never been this well fed or supplied. Their morale has skyrocketed as a result, and now many apply to join our army to escape the grinding poverty of the Russian Anarchy. Our warehouses are filling up, and our cooks spend days cooking surplus grain into hardtack for further campaigns abroad.\n\nThe citizens have not shared much in this excitement. But even the most skeptical has to admit that the newly reinvigorated army is doing more than ever to earn its pay, increased as it may be. Patrols on the road are more frequent. Bandit operations are increasingly seeing crackdowns. A cynical man might say this is to eliminate competition to our tax collectors. But everyone admits that Samara has never been a safer place. The Russian people have given us the tool we need to deliver them from their troubles. Soon, perhaps, military order and prosperity will reign from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific."

 SAM_Take_What_is_Theirs: "Take What Is Theirs"
 SAM_Take_What_is_Theirs_desc: "Against Bunyachenko and Zykov stands Oktan's faction of officers and German "advisors." Why bother to scavenge for rusted Soviet firearms and moldy turnips covered in cow shit while Samara's useless peasants hide their bounty underground? The KONR is blessed with access to the greatest military superpower the world has ever seen. Why not make use of it? Every shipment of quality German arms and supplies is another advantage that the Liberation Army cannot go without.\n\nOktan's proposal has gained quite a bit of support beyond his own limited circle. For some Zykovites, getting weapons and supplies from the Germans means avoiding further taxation on the people. For some of Bunyachenko's faction, the prospect of new ammunition for their German weapon supply is very attractive indeed. However, those not in favor of the plan argue from many angles, that depending on the Germans is a bad plan in the long run, and that continually begging for equipment is unsightly. In the background, the German advisors observe the unfolding debate."

 SAM_German_Arms: "German Arms"
 SAM_German_Arms_desc: "To the German's credit, the shipments came rapidly, and in considerable quantity. But rapid delivery and quantity of shipped equipment is perhaps the only thing that can be said about the German aid.\n\nSoldiers have spent days unpacking crates after crates of World War Two era Kar98k rifles and 7.92x57mm Mauser ammunition. The Germans have supplemented their generous supply of antiquated weaponry and ammunition with stale rations. Optimists argue that they're from the West Russian War, and are still edible. Pessimists claim they're left over from World War Two.\n\nOktan and his supporters do not seem to mind this. Food is food, and weapons are weapons. An army wins or dies based on discipline and leadership, and KONR has both in spades... or at least it would, if not for the whining and negative attitude of its current officer corps. One ought not to need anything stronger than a bayonet to clear communist rabble, degenerate democrats, and alcoholic bandits."

 SAM_Moskowien_Contacts: "Moskowien Contacts"
 SAM_Moskowien_Contacts_desc: "The shipments from the Reich will prove invaluable. But perhaps there is still more we can obtain through German help. Of course, the German government is often busy, and so it is time for us to talk to other German friends.\n\nAcross the border lies Reichskommissariat Moskowien, the vast German administration built to administer Russia west of the A-A line. Its hardscrabble population of settlers, military garrisons, and Russian second class citizens try to make a living in the shadow of the warlords and bandits that lurk beyond the border. Over the year, members of the KONR such as Oktan have built up contact with citizens' militias and military officers of Moskowien. In exchange for help and support to Samara's government, the KONR has done its best to monitor its section of the border. Now that the German bombing campaign might be coming to an end, why not ring up our associates beyond the border and request more supplies, lest hordes of Bolsheviks, anarchists, and bandits pour over our border?"

 SAM_Dealing_with_Dissent: "Dealing with Dissent"
 SAM_Dealing_with_Dissent_desc: "It has not escaped Vlasov and the KONR leadership's attention that our Army of National Liberation is wildly unpopular even among the members of our "nation" that we have already "liberated."\n\nIgnoring for the moment issues of taxation we may or may not have exacerbated, the people of Samara disdain us as foreign stooges. Many citizens, especially among the left leaning, see us as unrepentant traitors that have contributed to the failure of the WRRF.\n\nOpinion among the officer corps as to the best solution run the usual gamut of proposals. It would thus be for the best to convoke another meeting of the general staff to discuss the issue, and perhaps settle on one strategy to secure the good will of the people... or at least the absence of their opposition."

 SAM_The_Smart_Way: "The Smart Way"
 SAM_The_Smart_Way_desc: "The indefatigable Zykov has used his time at the podium to argue that the best way forward is to go at it intelligently and legitimately try to improve the lives of our citizens. Legitimacy is derived from the people's support, and our soldiers are still brothers, fathers, and sons. The men tilling the fields and building the guns are no less indispensable than the men fighting for a new Russia. Enslaving a whole nation for their purposes was the mistake of the Soviet Union and of the Third Reich, and now the first is long dead and the second finds itself dying.\n\nIt might not be the easiest path. Fear, suspicion and shattered hopes push many of our citizens towards distrust. Some may never forgive us for working with the Germans, and we will have to go the extra mile to prove our good intents. But this problem must be solved now, lest our reputation of tyranny spread to newly liberated provinces."

 SAM_Hearing_the_People_Out: "Hearing the People Out"
 SAM_Hearing_the_People_Out_desc: "Our community outreach has gotten some results, despite the cynicism of most of the officer staff. Soldiers have begun to renovate roads in rural communities and helping to clear rubble. Peasants have, at first, been reluctant to bother the soldiers, but a few have since come out seeking help with other tasks. The soldiers have obliged to the most pressing ones, and as a result quite a bit of good will has been founded.\n\nIn parallel to this, a series of mixed civilian-military tribunals have been established. People wronged by our soldiers or government are encouraged to register their complaints with the judges. While it is out of the question to punish our soldiers too harshly - lest we lose control of the state - ensuring that the worst excesses are penalized and that aggrieved citizens are compensated goes a long way. Another idea that is slowly gaining traction are mixed military-civilian community councils, where small garrisons see their organization enmeshed with the village they protect. It will be a long process, but getting the people to support and back our cause now has a good chance of actually happening."

 SAM_The_Easy_Way_desc: "The accursed Bolshevik Lenin once quipped that the average citizen is only three meals away from revolution. Food uncertainty and boredom are among the best way to let a group of docile lambs get turned into scheming wolves.\n\nBunyachenko and many other among the Officer Committee have suggested a simple plan: buy and distribute vast quantities of foods. Living on the edge of starvation is the sad normal in the Russian Anarchy, and simply keeping our people well fed will generate generous amount of positive apathy. While Zykov is not wrong that the population needs to cooperate with our liberation project, it's not worth investing that much effort into improving their life. Better to simply leave them to their own devices, content and fed while the soldiers busy themselves with national liberation.\n\nAcquiring the food will cost money, of course. But with the upcoming wars, a great amount of opportunities will present themselves. Our coffers can be refilled once the wars begin."

 SAM_Food_for_All_desc: "Having a steady pipeline of food imports and purchases coming in is one thing. Making sure it's distributed equally and without corruption or losses is quite another.\n\nLike many Russian successor states, our woeful infrastructure has decayed considerably since the Soviet Era through lack of maintenance and terror bombings. But when there's a will, there's a way. We already garrison soldiers throughout all of our territories, and these men have to be supplied anyway. By using our extensive logistics infrastructure, we can make sure no village or community is left behind. This will require much carting over of food through difficult terrain by foot or by horse. The peace and quiet earned by making sure every single citizen is well fed will make this struggle well worth it."

The Army of National Liberation gives its life to defend the people from bandits and Bolsheviks.

Unleash the troops on seditious communities. Throw suspected communist infiltrators in jail. Beat down protests violently. There's a life and death war out there, and softness has already condemned Russia in all four of its major wars of the 20th century. Would a mighty bear care for the opinions of worms?

It's a damn shame that so many of our loyal citizens go hungry while Bolshevik pigs gorge themselves on no doubt ill acquired food. Time for some redistribution, so beloved by left wing bandits. By seizing food from problem areas and redistributing it to loyal citizens, we will simultaneously reward patriots and starve out bandit communities.

Finally, for a loud minority, Vlasov is a weak failure that is the main reason that KONR has been rotting in Samara for an entire lost decade.\n\nA final leadership conference then.

In their arrogance they call us subhumans one moment before begging us to guard their borders the next.\n\nThese are hard times in Russia, and they call for hard men.

It is indeed the time for strong men, and the Germans are strong. We must aid them in their quest to bring forth a new era.

Much of our army remains non motorized or only motorized on paper, with many having to slowly march to get into action. In the modern age of lightning warfare leg infantry has been made obsolete and we must understand such. If we wish to see our flag fly from the capital of a free Russia, the first step is modernizing our army.\n\nWe shall contract out to various Samaran automobile factories orders of hundreds of trucks and jeeps to equip our many infantry divisions for the fight that is surely soon to come. By contracting to multiple factories we can hope that they will compete to create more efficient vehicles, and the one that shows it can produce motorized equipment at the highest capacity and quality will receive the most funding from the Samaran government. Our goal is nothing less than the reunification of Russia and a strong all-Russian army. Let us drive into the horizon where a bright future awaits!"

 SAM_Radar_Defences: "Radar Defenses"
 SAM_Radar_Defences_desc: "Despite the halt in German bombings, allowing us to finally come into our own as a potential custodian of the Russian future, we worry that while the people of Samara no longer awake in the wee hours of the morning to the "death whistle" of German munitions, this new situation may at best be tentative. Instead, we must prepare for the worst while hoping for the best for all the Russian people.\n\nUsing slightly antiquated radar technology "bought" from a German base in the RK Moskowien and then duplicated in Samara, we will set up radar stations across our borders at key military installations to keep a careful watch over our people and their safety. We cannot allow ourselves to be caught off guard in this age where warfare is driven by what is in the air as much as it is our legions on the ground."

 SAM_Making_A_Greater_Samara: "Making a Greater Samara"
 SAM_Making_A_Greater_Samara_desc: "After no small effort, both by the people of Samara and their ever-present benevolent guides, the city of Samara has been completely rebuilt and re-industrialized. Now, it has reached a record level of industrial production! Droves of Russians, from disgraced wretches and invalids to able-bodied teenagers, are employed in our newly constructed arms factories. Churning out dozens of firearms and bullets a day, these factories have not only begun to lower unemployment, but have also allowed our city to better supply the army's ever increasing demand for weapons.\n\nHurrah for the committee! Hurrah for the Russian Liberation Army!"

 SAM_The_Officer_Plan: "The Officer Plan"
 SAM_The_Officer_Plan_desc: "Kickstarting Samara's economy in time for the reclamation of Western Russia will be no easy task. Indeed, for most people it would be impossible, but Mikhail Oktan is not most people. Working with the most loyal elements of the ROA, he has drafted a plan that would employ the military's best commanders in the reconstruction effort. Each commander will be given a territory to govern. They will be responsible for raising conscripts and extracting goods and resources from their territories. Critics of this plan have called it modernized feudalism. Oktan and his supporters know that it is just common sense."

 SAM_Put_the_Women_to_Work_desc: "Rebuilding Russia will take the effort of every single child of the Motherland. While the sons of Russia are fighting to retake their nation there must be someone to keep the factories running and finish the repairs. It is time for the daughters of Russia to prove their loyalty and dedication to our cause. The women of Samara will trade their aprons for uniforms, and the kitchen for the factory floor. We cannot afford the niceties of traditional roles in modern war. Our enemies are totally committed to our destruction, so our commitment to victory must be total as well. Every last citizen of the nation will do their part for the war effort."

 SAM_Integrated_Civilian_And_Military_Sectors: "Integrated Civilian And Military Sectors"
 SAM_Integrated_Civilian_And_Military_Sectors_desc: "Our industry is a disorganized jumble of state-owned and private factories producing a mixture of civilian and military goods. We have made do with this so far, but it will not do any longer. We must integrate the civilian and military economies, placing both under the control of the ROA to make sure that our army is always kept well supplied. Under military oversight, we will be able to rapidly expand our industry in an organized manner that serves our needs above those of some capitalists who are more concerned with their profits than national redemption. The officers have not steered us wrong yet and there is no reason to believe they will do so now."

 SAM_Guns_for_the_Motherland: "Guns for the Motherland"
 SAM_Guns_for_the_Motherland_desc: "Weapons are and always have been the key to war. Without them, we cannot do anything on the battlefield, and so our leader has announced that a further expansion of our capacity to produce them is required. Some will be built in new factories as our industry continues to grow, while others will be scavenged from the old Soviet military, nearby warlord states or even old German equipment. With sufficient equipment, the Russian Liberation Army will be able to crush any opposition, whether that be bandits or opposing warlords."

 SAM_Bigger_Guns_for_Our_Boys: "Bigger Guns for Our Boys"
 SAM_Bigger_Guns_for_Our_Boys_desc: "Our officers call artillery the queen of the battlefield for a reason. Much like the queen on a chess board it is equal parts powerful and useful. Artillery is essential to modern warfare. It can break an entrenched enemy or halt an offensive in its tracks. Now that we have the industry to keep our troops supplied with the basics of equipment, such as rifles and ammunition, some of our regional commanders have turned their production to heavier guns. While the warlords to our north are stuck with hordes of men who are lucky if they have a machine gun, our troops will be backed by lines of cannons that will bring down thunder and death on all who stand in our way."

 SAM_I_Want_Planes: "Requisition Planes"
 SAM_I_Want_Planes_desc: "Another critical part of war, at least in the modern age, is the war in the air. Having a functioning air force can be a major advantage in the battlefield, especially in Russia where they are a precious resource. A Samaran air force to accompany the Liberation Army will be a massive improvement to our military, and will allow us to attack and bomb any enemy that appears in our way with ease. At least, that's what our leader claims. As for the source of these planes, he has suggested we reach out to German contacts and ask for a few old aircraft from the days of the Second World War, that we can then use and refurbish for our own purposes."

 SAM_They_Need_Bases: "Build Them Bases"
 SAM_They_Need_Bases_desc: "Planes, in order to function well, always need extensive facilities on the ground. To aid our air force, we have decided to construct a new base for the Samaran air force, a good distance from our capital. Composed of a series of different buildings and runways to accommodate the proud Russian air fleet, this shall be a good step for the future expansion of this branch of our military. Should the Committee approve it, a significant share of our military budget will be directed there due to its importance."

 SAM_Making_My_Samara: "Making a Stronger Samara"
 SAM_Making_My_Samara_desc: "Oktan and the officers' plan to rebuild Samara and the surrounding regions is beginning to pay off. The commanders have become familiar with their assigned territories, and have learned how to extract the greatest value from them. For the first time in years production and tax quotas are being met, banditry has decreased, and a semblance of order has been restored. Each military governor has total control over their allotted land, and in return for their power they pledge their fealty to Oktan and their soldiers to the ROA and the cause of Russian reclamation. Once we have eliminated our opposition we can expand this system across all of Russia, laying the foundation for a new, stronger Motherland."

 SAM_Now_We_Fix_Our_Situation: "Now We Address Our Situation..."
 SAM_Now_We_Fix_Our_Situation_desc: "Finally, the economy of Samara has been improved and stabilized to an acceptable point. However, while this problem might soon be solved, there is another issue to be settled. While our goal is to unify Russia under our banner, numerous factions compete for control within these lands, each with their own ideas and ambitions for a united Russia. It is time to bring an end to this. We must end the divisions and fractures laying claim to our land and eliminate these pretender states from a position of power."

 ### Zykov Politics Tree ###
 SAM_The_Voice_of_Reason: "The Voice of Reason"
 SAM_The_Voice_of_Reason_desc: "In the ensuing political confrontation, Miletiy Zykov, the ideological voice of the Committee and the passionate voice for democracy, achieved the goodwill of the venerable Chairman Vlasov and rose to the rank of the 'second man' in the KONR. Few expected such a contentious figure to become the designated heir to Vlasov, but it seems that his radical ideas and appeal to the people brought the head propagandist of Samara far more weight to his bid for power than his enemies could ever expect.\n\nOf course, the favor of the old general is not enough to protect Zykov from attacks by rivalling factions. Many members of the KONR, especially the more conservative members of Oktan's faction, have barely concealed their contempt for the "daydreaming demagogue." The usually apolitical Bunyachenko faction have, unusually, also expressed dismay at Zykov's election. The new Deputy-Chairman has yet to prove his worth, but no matter what it takes, Zykov will make every effort to accomplish the goals the Russian liberation movement was founded upon - the overthrowing of tyranny, wherever it may be, and the creation of a new, free Russia, one without Bolsheviks and any exploiters of the Russian blood."

 SAM_Dealing_with_Bunyachenko: "Dealing with the General"
 SAM_Dealing_with_Bunyachenko_desc: "General Bunyachenko and his fellow officers do not oppose us with the same virulence as Oktan and his clique does. However, our program is still unpopular with the officers. Many accuse us of selling out the hard working men of the ROA for ungrateful rabble that has done nothing but depict us as cowardly collaborators.\n\nFortunately, we have reason to think that there is still some honor and patriotism among the officers outside of Oktan's group. The officer's clique and Bunyachenko agree with us that we need at least a small amount of popular support if we're to succeed. We must convince them that offering a democratic Russia is the best path forward."

 SAM_Speak_with_Bunyachenko: "Speak with Bunyachenko"
 SAM_Speak_with_Bunyachenko_desc: "General Bunyachenko is long established as the mouthpiece of the officers' committee. However, it is also suspected that his apathy hides secret dreams of a renewed Russia, one able to punish the Germans and Bolsheviks both. Even more important is his influence within the officer corps, as his years of dedicated service have made him a popular, non controversial figure.\n\nIt is thus crucial that we begin talks with him, and attempt to bring him closer to our democratic aims. This will be a long ordeal, and one that may never succeed fully. However, convincing him to ask the officers' committee to give us a chance is an easily attainable first step."

 SAM_Speak_with_the_Committee: "Speak to the Committee"
 SAM_Speak_with_the_Committee_desc: "The officers' committee is an important asset in our crusade to liberate Russia. The officers themselves hate the communists and Germans for getting us in this mess. Why not appeal to their patriotism, as well as to their ambition? While it is true that our plan is to eventually give back some power to the common man, the officers of the ROA will still be better off as respected elder statesmen of a strong, united Russia than as petty princes in a backwater military junta. Surely it is an acceptable trade?"

 SAM_Bureaucratic_Allies: "Bureaucratic Allies"
 SAM_Bureaucratic_Allies_desc: "We know not if Bunyachenko or our other officer contacts upheld their end of the bargain. What is known, however, is that cooperation with the officers' committee has been going a lot smoother recently. It is now time for this cooperation to trickle downwards, and reassure the fighting men that Zykov will lead them to honor, glory, freedom, as well as a decent salary bonus. After all, a poorly organized and poorly motivated army is no army at all."

 SAM_Dealing_with_Maltsev: "Dealing with Oktan"
 SAM_Dealing_with_Maltsev_desc: "Our most dangerous opposition consists of the clique of men centered around General Oktan. Men who see the collapse of Russia not as a tragedy, but as an opportunity to get rich. Encouraged by their German sponsors, the Oktanite seek to grind poor Russian citizens into the dirt to extract every ruble of loot from this catastrophe.\n\nWhile we shall work to prevent the spread of this rot any further, a significant group of officers already think like Oktan. We must thus deal with them, as well as with the leftover German influence in the ROA, if we're to shed away our image as unhinged collaborators among the people."

 SAM_Speak_with_Maltsev: "Speak with Oktan"
 SAM_Speak_with_Maltsev_desc: "General Oktan is a hard, cynical man, unconvinced by the idea of sharing the ROA's power with it's citizens. In his little clique lay some of the fiercest opponents to our democratic ideals.\n\nOktan himself is also both greedy, and indispensable. His contraband network will be of great assistance to us, and he alone can keep our opponents within the officer corps in line. Why not appeal to his greed? By asking him to help us capture all of western Russia, we can buy off his patience. The rogue general believes us to be an idealistic rabble...and can not expect us to betray him, when the time comes."

 SAM_Speak_with_the_Germans: "Talk to the Germans"
 SAM_Speak_with_the_Germans_desc: "Our German "friends" in Moskowien and beyond might be busy with their own troubles right now, but the sight of Russian unification on their doorsteps is sure to alarm them eventually.\n\nWe still have a little good-will with the Reich for our work in pushing back the communists and bandits. By cashing in every last contempt-drenched favor, we can reassure them that we are merely making a pre-emptive move against the WRRF. In turn, German food and supplies will help us secure our rear as we leave Samara and go off to war."

 SAM_Strenuous_Frenemies: "Excising the Rot"
 SAM_Strenuous_Frenemies_desc: "Oktan and the Germans think us weak willed and easily subverted once the time comes. Let them dream this, for our own day shall come, too.\n\nWith both factions giving us some leeway, it's time to crack down hard on corruption within the ROA. Any German bandit or smuggler caught aiding this blight on the people will be publicly shot. Junior officers, common soldiers and citizens victim to predation in the past will be compensated. By shedding the image of a decaying German junta even further we can in time earn the respect of our citizens."

 SAM_Making_Use_of_Vlasov: "Making Use of Vlasov"
 SAM_Making_Use_of_Vlasov_desc: "Whatever could be said about him, one cannot deny that Vlasov is, indeed, a significant person in the thousand-year-old Russian history: A living myth who will be remembered along such figures as Alexander Nevsky and maybe even Peter the Great for his decisiveness to rise against tyranny and lead the Russian people into a new, freer future. As befits any true historical hero, Vlasov's biography is full of wrongful and controversial decisions, and many deprecate him for his mistakes, but they will not be the judges of the Motherlands History.\n\nThe stagnation of the internal affairs in Samara caused many people, including both the elite of the Committee and the common Russian folk, to turn on General Vlasov for his alleged apathy to the needs of Russia and his inability to govern the KONR, but his authority among the new Russian government is still indisputable. Combined together, Vlasov's supreme power and his backing of Zykov's democratic reformist bureaucrats will become a battering ram which will break down the discontent of the KONR and open a way to the true reforms we wish to see enacted."

 SAM_The_Power_of_Radio: "The Power of Radio"
 SAM_The_Power_of_Radio_desc: "Radio is the cheapest way to reach every soldier and citizen, wherever they may be. By launching new programs that mix entertainment and education, we can better inform the people of the currently unfolding democratic revolution.\n\nDeputy-Chairman Zykov is known for his oratorical skill and propaganda work. Let us use this asset to diminish the influence of untruths and deception across our land!"

 SAM_A_Renewed_Spirit: "A Renewed Spirit"
 SAM_A_Renewed_Spirit_desc: "A cautious optimism has descended on Samara. Has the ROA always been this popular? Of course it has! Why then are the memories of Chairman Vlasov hated? Vile rumors, of course, caused by the actions of vile underlings that have long been judged by the renewed ROA. Like the good tsar led astray by his wicked boyars, Vlasov has come to dispense justice and help to the people of Samara!\n\nOf course, only a gullible minority preach this gospel. For the rest of the population, the ROA has simply managed to emerge renewed from its stagnation after the end of the German bombings. Curious about where we are going with this, and too cynical to oppose us violently in a quixotic effort at rebellion, our good citizens are themselves beginning to emerge out of their apathy."

 SAM_Begin_the_Unification: "Begin the Unification"
 SAM_Begin_the_Unification_desc: " With our internal situation under control, we must now begin our wars of unification. No longer mere hunting dogs for the German, we of the ROA must proudly accept our destiny as liberators of Russia. If every Russian is to live free of fear and oppression, then we must not fail! Soldiers, citizens, onward!"

 ### Bunyachenko Politics Tree ###
 SAM_The_Committee_Prevails: "The Committee Prevails"
 SAM_The_Committee_Prevails_desc: "Amid a significant amount of political turmoil among Samara's elite, the committee of officers responsible for making all of our statelet's important decisions has decided its successor. Even with Zykov advocating his idealistic "democracy" and General Oktan promoting the worst kinds of corruption, the committee has thankfully chosen the rational path and nominated Sergey Bunyachenko as the new head of the ROA.\n\nGeneral Bunyachenko is competent and disciplined, perfect for the continuation of the ROA's mission. His first task: to restore stability to our fractured political situation, remind the various officers who really is in charge, and begin shaping the ROA into a force capable of governing."

 SAM_Work_with_Zykov: "Work with Zykov"
 SAM_Work_with_Zykov_desc: "Although we all accept the leadership of General Vlasov, the ROA has substantial internal factions, each with its own idea of how best to run Samara. General Bunyachenko, for instance, is a fairly standard advocate of a single-party right wing state. Zykov, on the other hand, has far more peculiar opinions. Zykov is an unabashed liberal who campaigns relentlessly for greater democratization. The fact that he had to collaborate with the Third Reich to do so does not seem to faze him.\n\nAlthough we see eye to eye on very few issues, our faction and his do have the capacity to reconcile. Zykov's supporters, more than anything, desire at least surface-level improvements in the common people's situation. If we can achieve the veneer of progress, we may be able to form a mutually beneficial relationship."

 SAM_Nominate_Him: "Nominate Zykov"
 SAM_Nominate_Him_desc: "Miletiy Zykov is an impressively principled advocate of democracy. His soaring speeches and firm convictions make him one of our greatest assets in terms of propaganda, performing sorely needed work to rectify the Russian people's perception of the ROA as traitors and assets of the Reich. He is also a snake who should not be trusted with any position of power, lest he steer our army towards his mad dreams of liberalism.\n\nNevertheless, snakes have their uses. Zykov's way with words makes him the only major politician in Samara with any form of public support. Giving him a prestigious yet powerless sinecure will show the people that we have their best interests in mind, or at least convince them that we do."

 SAM_Celebrate_Vlasov: "Celebrate Vlasov"
 SAM_Celebrate_Vlasov_desc: "Ah, the great General Vlasov--what an underappreciated man! He defected from the criminal Red Army and brilliantly played the Reich in order to gain the leverage to liberate Samara from the Bolshevik scourge. Now he benevolently leads the ROA, preparing to one day liberate Russia from communism once and for all! Unfortunately, the vast majority of Samara's population does not quite see the situation this way. Most believe him to be a German toady and a traitor to the nation.\n\nIf we are to gain any sort of legitimacy, we need to combat the false narratives about our leader and founder. With the help of Zykov and his propagandists, we can tell the Russian people that Vlasov is a hero worthy of respect. In time, they may even believe us."

 SAM_First_Among_Equals: "First Among Equals"
 SAM_First_Among_Equals_desc: "The officers' committee that runs Samara is a democratic institution of ROA generals committed to managing the liberation of Russia. However, as in any organization, certain figures are likely to become disproportionately prominent. General Vlasov, of course, is our most respected leader, owing to his heroism in fighting the Soviets. However, General Bunyachenko has himself rapidly risen in importance following his election by the committee.\n\nTo the uneducated masses, this might appear to be evidence that Samara is a military dictatorship, where power is consolidated in the hands of one man. This is naturally a misconception, but one that needs to be corrected to increase trust in our government. Bunyachenko is merely the first among equals, obeyed out of admiration rather than fear. At least, not yet."

 SAM_Demote_Maltsev: "Demote Oktan"
 SAM_Demote_Maltsev_desc: "The generals of the ROA are loathed by many Russians as traitors and collaborators, and none more so than Mikhail Oktan. Oktan embodies every negative characterization of our organization; he is corrupt, sleazy, greedy, and infamously close to the Germans. Overall, a man of shockingly little moral fiber. He drags Samara down with every day he spends in its senior ranks, but is disconcertingly influential among some less scrupulous officers.\n\nNeutralizing Oktan as a powerful player in the ROA's politics is a necessity in order to limit the corrosive influence he has on our discipline and popularity. A demotion should do wonders to cut him down to size, as well as showing the skeptical populace that we are capable of dealing with bad actors within our hierarchy."

 SAM_Sideline_the_Germans: "Sideline the Germans"
 SAM_Sideline_the_Germans_desc: "Out of all the brands and slanderous titles that have been applied to Vlasov and the ROA, none have been more devastating than the accusations that we are German-backed traitors to the motherland. Also quite devastating is the fact that they are entirely true. In order to strike out against the Bolsheviks, General Vlasov made a tactical alliance with the Third Reich. Inconveniently, many German advisors sent over during this period are still present and fairly visible.\n\nThe advisors have been far more trouble than they are worth. We have all the weapons we need, and the Reich is not exactly a reliable partner. In the long run, erasing all remnants of our collaboration with Germany will redeem us in the eyes of the Russian people, and our legitimacy as a nation is far more important than our reputation in the eyes of a country that seeks to keep Russia weak and divided."

 SAM_The_Committee_Looks_Outward: "The Committee Looks Outward"
 SAM_The_Committee_Looks_Outward_desc: "Ever since the Tatars were conquered a long, long time ago, they have been an integral part of the Russian nation. However, with the unfortunate collapse of the country, they believe they have a chance to rise again. We must prove them that this is their greatest mistake. They are our neighbor, and so it shall be easy for the great Russian Liberation Army to march on and crush any hopeless resistance they offer. The time has come for this futile separatist effort to end, and for the Russian flag to fly high over Kazan once again."

 ### Oktan Politics Tree ###
 SAM_The_Kormchiy_Rises: "The Trail of Fortune"
 SAM_The_Kormchiy_Rises_desc: "Now's the time, now's the hour. The venerable Chairman Vlasov has chosen commander Oktan as his heir. Gone are the years of stagnation and weakness. The ROA now belongs to men of action.\n\nMuch remains to be done, our hold on power is still tentative. Our rivals are still powerful. We must mold the ROA to our needs to ensure Russia's future... as well as our own interest.\n\nThe Zykovites as well as the officers committee must be put in their place. We must strike now preventively to catch them off guard. Good thing that Deputy-Chairman Oktan has kept a long list of contacts and resources for just such a moment."

 SAM_Sideline_Our_Rivals: "Sideline Our Rivals"
 SAM_Sideline_Our_Rivals_desc: "As long as Bunyachenko and Zykov plot our downfall, our political program will be in danger. We must thus sideline them to secure our position\n\nIt would be ill advised to try a power move against these men while our enemies lurk beyond the border. The best move, for now, is to begin reducing their influence and make it clear to the officers of the ROA that from now on, promotion and wealth can only come from aiding Oktan."

 SAM_Erase_Their_Legacies: "Erase Their Legacies"
 SAM_Erase_Their_Legacies_desc: "It's always a bit awkward to purge political rivals with long illustrious careers of service to the nation. Zykov is, if not beloved, then cautiously liked by the civilians of Samara for his propaganda speeches on democracy and the importance of a free Russia. Bunyachenko, on the other hand, is popular with the soldiers for his exploits in the West Russian War.\n\nBy beginning a campaign of propaganda, we can polish our leader's image while slowly erasing the legacy of these two trouble makers."

 SAM_Turn_Their_Supporters: "Turn Their Supporters"
 SAM_Turn_Their_Supporters_desc: "Bunyachenko and Zykov have die hard supporters; some men really do believe in the bizarre democratic dream; others feel that an allegedly just and fair general like Bunyachenko really is the ROA's best chance at saving Russia.\n\nThankfully, many more officers are honest in that they chose the horse that seemed most likely to win the race. After Oktan's ascension, these men have stayed loyal to Zykov and Bunyachenko's side out of a desire to be on the winning team when the round of musical chair end.\n\nThese men can be persuaded to change side, were we to make a better offer than their current boss. Oktan has accumulated quite a sum of money and good quantity of land for such an occaison. By doling out payments, we can trim our rival's power for the time being"

 SAM_Our_Eternal_Leader: "Our Eternal Leader"
 SAM_Our_Eternal_Leader_desc: "Our efforts against Bunyachenko and Zykov are paying dividends. While neither men are out of the game yet, their powerbase has significantly shrunk. The ROA is now mostly united in purpose, supporting Oktan's dream of crushing bolshevism and restoring a strong Russia to the forefront... And rewarding the hero liberators of the ROA with land and money beyond their wildest dreams."

 SAM_Use_My_Foes: "Use Our Foes"
 SAM_Use_My_Foes_desc: "While it may be tempting to strike now, the truth is that Zykov and Bunyachenko both dream of a united Russia, with them at the command. As such, while the Russian wars of unification are beginning, it may prove simplest to make use of our enemies while they are still useful. Both men are skilled and hard working, and while their vision for the future pales when compared to the Deputy-Chairman's plans, they are still our comrades for the time being."

 SAM_My_Voice: "Oktan's Voice"
 SAM_My_Voice_desc: "No one quite knows what to make of Zykov. An eccentric man of uncertain past, agitating for a democratic future in Russia.\n\nFor Oktan, it is clear what Zykov is: a dangerous quixotic fool, but a charismatic one. The so-called friend of the people has convinced many other ROA officers about his democratic dream, and the importance of treating civilians well.\n\nIt would thus by best for Zykov to stay very close to Oktan. The general's oratory skills can be used to help change the ROA's image from bloodthirsty collaborators to humble liberators of the Russian nation. Of course, Zykov's message of democracy and power to the people will have to be thoroughly excised from our propaganda efforts."

 SAM_My_Generals: "Oktan's Generals"
 SAM_My_Generals_desc: "General Bunyachenko is a skilled man, and his entourage contains some of the best commanding officers of the ROA. As such, if we can get Bunyachenko's reluctant backing, his officer friends will serve our cause as we expand out of Samara.\n\nIn time, the glory of conquest and the sweet rewards of land and money will erode these officers loyalty to Bunyachenko, and make them much better disposed to the Deputy-Chairman. The ones that cannot be turned will simply receive nothing."

 SAM_My_Committee: "Oktan's Committee"
 SAM_My_Committee_desc: "With Bunyachenko and Zykov nominally backing us, many officers of the committee have jumped onboard Oktan's coalition.\n\nAs our political worries wind down, we can finally begin moving forward. The final few opponents we have can be ostracized, and the final few undecided men can be brought aboard our group. When the war begins, this shaky coalition will be solidified as honor and glory fall on all that follow the Komrchiy."

 SAM_My_Russia: "Oktan's Russia"
 SAM_My_Russia_desc: "As Vlasov's designated successor, and with a great majority of the ROA following him, Oktan is finally ready to begin his campaign to free western Russia.\n\nHis program is simple: a strong Russia led by strong men. Following his reorganization of Samara, general Oktan wishes to be the undisputed ruler of all of Russia. Our nation will be divided into military districts, ran by a stratocracy of skilled and loyal officers. Our soldiers will fight for glory, and for the chance to make a killing expropriating the wealth of bolsheviks and other degenerates. Already, men flock to the banner of the rejuvenated ROA. Like the Roman legionaries of old, our soldiers will march to the end of the world for a promise of a patch of land to call their own in the greatest empire on Earth."

Even more important, however, is to assure the stability and orderliness of the transition. Our army, despite its triumph throughout Western Russia, is badly overstretched. Vast amounts of territory are being managed by officers of dubious loyalty to the new Chairman.\n\nEven more disquieting are the rumors of revolts against our rule.

Contradictory reports that the soldiers are simply asking for better pay and for an end to the war time discipline, or that they refuse to serve the new Chairman make it difficult to ascertain the scale of the problem.\n\nWe must act quickly!

Meanwhile, pro democracy extremists within the officer corps argue for leniency against the rioting plebs.\n\nUnfortunately for the schemers, Chairman Bunyachenko has prepared himself. With a slight majority of the officers favoring him, our faction can begin twisting the arm of the democrats and form a super coalition to defeat Oktan's group."

 SAM_and_order_bunya: "And Order"
 SAM_and_order_bunya_desc: "The revolters expected to face a divided ROA. Now that this scenario no longer applies, we can afford to appear magnanimous.\n\nThe revolters that agree to our offer will have to disarm, and agree to move to settle areas of Russia devastated by years of conflict. This will show the democrats within the ROA that we do care about the civilian population.\n\nAs for those who refuse our clemency, it is only a matter of time before their ammunition and food runs out."

 SAM_money_maltsev: "Money..."
 SAM_money_maltsev_desc: "The weak moralist fools of the officer corps and in the democratique clique thought they could undermine Chairman Oktan. Little do they realize that the Chairman has already seen three moves ahead, and that most of our enemies' supporters have seen their cooperation purchased by us.\n\nStill, our opponents are still numerous. By making an example of a select few groups of soldiers and officers, and doubling our monetary offers, we should be able to trim the opposition considerably."

 SAM_and_power_maltsev: "And Power"
 SAM_and_power_maltsev_desc: "Chairman Oktan has always considered his partners outside the ROA of great importance. As such, we've been busy "investing" in various areas and businesses, and making "contacts" throughout every warlord of Western Russia. Once these warlords were defeated, a considerable amount of money and power fell into the hands of men that had long been on our side.\n\nTime to cash out some of these investments and favors. The civilian revolters are more likely to listen to "their own" that the ROA is Russia's future and that Chairman Oktan is... compassionate."

And out there in the provinces, many civilians are just now understanding that our government came very close to being toppled.\n\nMore resistance can be expected in the future, from both disgruntled ROA soldiers and officers, as well as civilians who loathe our government.

 ### Regional Military ###
 SAM_Reformed_officer_corps: "Reformed Officer Corps"
 SAM_Reformed_officer_corps_desc: "The ROA has always been weighed down by its overly large and factional officer corps. The political influence it wielded in the past made it difficult to seriously reform our command structure, as bickering and conspiracies muddled our mission and made us vulnerable. Though less threatening now that the situation has stabilized, the officers represent a potential source of future opposition to our rule, and collect far more in salary money than can be justified given our resources.\n\nAs well as eliminating the more politically unreliable elements of our military, streamlining the officer corps is simply good practice. A less clunky and top-heavy military can only be beneficial. After all, any future factional infighting would destabilize the chain of command and potentially be a death blow to our government."

 SAM_Swords_and_plowshares: "Swords and Plowshares"
 SAM_Swords_and_plowshares_desc: "While we have much fighting left to do, the situation in West Russia has largely stabilized. Things are returning to normal, but the devastation caused by many long years of war hampers economic recovery. The task now is to aid development and better extend our reach in newly conquered territories.\n\nWe are unable to return to a peacetime economy at the present, but, if there's any lesson we can take from our former benefactors, it is that military expenditures can do wonders for rapid economic development. Redeploying soldiers across the region will allow us to fill gaps in regional economies, as well as secure our hold over far-flung areas. The ROA liberated the people of West Russia; it should naturally have some involvement in building it up to greatness."

 SAM_Cutting_the_chaff: "Cutting the Chaff"
 SAM_Cutting_the_chaff_desc: "The conditions we found ourselves in during the liberation of West Russia sometimes necessitated a certain lowering of our standards. Many of our conscripts were, to lack a better word, suboptimal. Whether of insufficient quality or insufficient loyalty to the correct faction of the ROA, elements of our forces can not be trusted to maintain the honor, obedience, and fighting spirit that will bring us victory in our future challenges.\n\nTo put it another way, we are long overdue for a purge. Soldiers unable to meet tests of physical fitness or allegiance will be cast out of the army, with jail time for the most serious cases of possible treason. While the diminishing of our numbers always hurts, we are better off in the long run with a loyal and effective fighting force."

 SAM_An_outward_looking_army: "An Outward Looking Army"
 SAM_An_outward_looking_army_desc: "Not too long ago, our army was filled with factionalism, infighting, and corruption. Its ranks were swelled with incompetent and treasonous conscripts and our officer corps was overloaded and politically untrustworthy. Although it was more than sufficient to conquer West Russia, the ROA was not the well-oiled machine needed to reclaim the rest of the country from the despots and criminals occupying it.\n\nWith our recent reforms, that fact has changed. The army is now slimmer and more effective, united behind the political leadership in the name of our cause. It is now time to look out from our own borders, and, as the best-trained, best-led army in all of Russia, take the first steps to total reunification."

 SAM_Gun_smithing_program: "Gun Smithing Program"
 SAM_Gun_smithing_program_desc: "The warlord armies of West Russia only scarcely had modern equipment to rely on. In most of the battles we fought on our way to regional hegemony, both sides were primarily equipped with surplus weapons from the Great Patriotic War, with even ten-year-old hardware being somewhat of a luxury. This will not suffice in our future battles; the enemies we have ahead of us will be larger, better-equipped, and more industrially formidable than our comparably meager previous foes.\n\nThe prospect of a serious disparity in equipment quality between us and our rivals is disconcerting enough to warrant immediate action. The ROA desperately needs modern guns, and a manufacturing drive across our entire territory should get us to where we need to be. Anything less would relegate our soldiers to battlefield inferiority in the coming days."

 SAM_A_Modern_air_force: "A Modern Air Force"
 SAM_A_Modern_air_force_desc: "Since the downfall of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the vast majority of Russia's battles have been fought on the ground. Most of the scattered warlord states left behind had neither the funds nor the equipment to maintain a large air force. Our ground superiority allowed us to bulldoze our way through Russia, but this tactical state of affairs will not last. Our future opponents will be larger, more modern states, easily capable of fielding jet fighters and bombers.\n\nThe ROA needs to react with the utmost speed to these changing circumstances and create a new air force. With the productive capacity of West Russia's factories behind us, building planes is finally within our grasp. Subjugating our eastern rivals will require taking to the skies, and the ROA's best are well up to that task."

 SAM_Getting_our_toes_wet: "Getting Our Toes Wet"
 SAM_Getting_our_toes_wet_desc: "Unlike with our nascent air force, building a strong navy is a relatively mild concern, at least for now. The reunification wars ahead of us will be fought almost entirely on or over solid ground. Still, it would be prudent to create a small navy, both to police the waters we do border and to set up a framework for after we achieve total unification, at which time a large navy would be necessary.\n\nRefitting several ships from the Soviet era for the present era should do, at least for now. For leadership, we shouldn't spare anyone vital; this is not a serious priority at the moment, but few would turn down the chance to be the first admiral of the new Russia. We may be starting small, but our successors will surely appreciate our foresight for beginning to establish the navy now."

 SAM_Modernization_of_the_ROA: "Modernization of the ROA"
 SAM_Modernization_of_the_ROA_desc: "Veterans of the ROA long for the day when fighting will end; their long suffering weapons await patiently their final day of work.\n\nModernization seeks to phase out obsolete equipment to leave our men equipped with good quality, modern weapons. It does not mean an obsession with the cutting edge, but rather a strong baseline for all of our troops. Modernization is an ongoing effort, and is never truly complete... nevertheless, modernization will leave us ready for anything!"

 SAM_Mechanization_of_the_ROA: "Mechanization of the ROA"
 SAM_Mechanization_of_the_ROA_desc: "The West Russian War and the Anarchy saw our men carry kilos and kilos of equipment into and out of conflict zones. Wounded comrades were often abandoned, as our men were unable to carry them quickly enough to field hospitals. Strong points were nightmares to capture, as light infantry was exposed to artillery and machine gun fire.\n\nMechanization is the principle that sees our men rely on an ever expanding fleet of motorized and armored vehicles. Vehicles that are able to transport them to battle, to support them during offensives and shield them during firefights. It will be a costly process, and one that may not be completed for years. Yet any amount of armor and speed will be a great force multiplier."

 SAM_Standardization_of_the_ROA: "Standardization of the ROA"
 SAM_Standardization_of_the_ROA_desc: "Our military industries now hum at a good pace, and all of our men are equipped. It is finally time for standardization to begin in full; the days where five soldiers carried ten calibers of weapon is over!\n\nStandardization will become one of the guiding principles of the Russian Army. Standardized weapons, yes, but also standardized clothes, equipment, tools. Standardized food supply and storage, standardized leadership structure. The Germans sought to beat discipline into us; we shall in turn march out into all of Russia with the precise set of instruments needed for victory."

 SAM_Fortifying_West_Russia: "Fortification"
 SAM_Fortifying_West_Russia_desc: "Our frontiers with the Germans and the other Russian warlords are thousands of kilometers long. As such it is impossible to fortify every centimeter of it. Nevertheless, we have learned much about fortification efforts in the wars of unification and in the West Russian War.\n\nBy fortifying important valleys and roads throughout our border, and by creating well armed redoubts, we can slow down any invasion and extract heavy casualties in the beginning of any war. These positions will be as important when we go on the offensive, as fall back areas should attack plans go awry."
 SAM_Fortifying_West_Russia_tt: "We will build a series of §YForts§! in the south.\n"

 SAM_Value_for_Money: "Value for Money"
 SAM_Value_for_Money_desc: "Our ambitious program of weapon and equipment development has inevitably run into delays and problems. New weapons and vehicles encounter teething problems on their first distributions.\n\nAll of this is natural, and expected by our engineers and officers. Underperforming designs are being reworked, or removed from production. Improvements are made to industrial processes. Day by day, we calculate the perfect ratio of money to effectiveness for every piece of kit, and work to improve it!"

 SAM_Harmonization: "Harmonization"
 SAM_Harmonization_desc: "War has become a complicated business. Every year there are new weapons to equip our soldiers with, new training methods that better prepare the men for combat, new tactics that will provide the crucial edge on the battlefield. If this were not enough to keep track of, each of these new developments is supposed to work in conjunction with one another. We have managed to keep our men equipped with modern weapons and trained to modern standards. Our generals are keeping up to date with the latest developments in strategic thought. However, our army still feels somewhat discordant.\n\nOur officers must know how they can use modern tanks and IFVs in their maneuvers most effectively. The men must be trained with modern rifles and anti-tank equipment. It is not enough for the military to be well equipped or well led. Every part must move together in harmony. Only then will we have a modern, professional military fit for a nation, not a warlord."

 SAM_Future_Warfare: "Future Warfare"
 SAM_Future_Warfare_desc: "Blue sky research in a military setting consists of researching things that may not have immediate use or applicability. While this type of research should never monopolize all of a nation's resources, it can pay big dividends to stay on the look-out for technologies that are just five to ten years away from being relevant.\n\nAs our industrial base expands, and as our army gains experience fighting various enemies, old ideas must be investigated anew. Who knows what the future holds for the Russian Army?"

 SAM_A_Brown_Water_Navy: "A Green Water Navy"
 SAM_A_Brown_Water_Navy_desc: "As more international commerce comes online and as our ambitions realize themselves, it is time to expand our efforts to reach a green water navy. Such a fleet would be able to patrol our corner of the Barents Sea and bloody the nose of any fleet attempting amphibious assaults on our territory.\n\nThe type of ships needed are small, and within our reach. Conventional submarines and destroyers will pose a threat to any foreign presence in our home water, as long as they are well supported by land based aviation."

 SAM_Full_Mobilization: "Full Mobilization"
 SAM_Full_Mobilization_desc: "Western Russia is now reunified, and with the most populous region of the nation firmly under our control we are now able to decide how that population will serve their motherland. The decades of devastation Russia endured annihilated everything resembling a national industry. This provides us with a chance to start fresh, and create a new economy that is fine-tuned to serve our purposes. In the short term at least, that will involve a focus on rapidly increasing military production as we prepare for the looming conflicts to our east and west. Each and every citizen will do their part to build a new, stronger Russia. When the next war comes to the Motherland we will not need to transition to a war economy. We will already have it in place."

 SAM_The_Army_of_National_Liberation: "The Army of National Liberation"
 SAM_The_Army_of_National_Liberation_desc: "Our enemies mocked us as cannon fodder, loathsome vermin deployed to absorb casualties for the German devils. An opinion shared by our former German masters, who wrote us off in the aftermath of the West Russian War. A decade, we spent in Samara, training and waiting.\n\nOf our enemies in west Russia, none stand. The red army remnants have been crushed and thrown to the dustbin of history. The tsarist mummies have joined the reds in this fate. Only the ROA stands.\n\nOur enemies mock us no longer, veterans and recruits alike fighting with modern equipment. Let the Germans cower in their rotting empire as we march to the Pacific, for the ROA marches out of hell and into a future of vengeance and national liberation!"

 SAM_The_Army_of_National_Liberation_Oktan: "The Army of National Liberation"
 SAM_The_Army_of_National_Liberation_Oktan_desc: "The Provisional Commissariat of Western Russia is not a warlord state. It is a modern nation, and it finally has an army befitting its status. The ROA has evolved from the band of unmotivated conscripts it once was. It is now a fully modernized, vicious fighting force ready for modern conflict against industrialized opponents. Russia's new army will be the spear we use to skewer the traitors and bandits to our east. Some in the government question if we have placed too much emphasis on developing the military at the expense of other areas. They say the Russian economy is not yet developed enough to support such a large and advanced army. Perhaps they are right, but it is unimportant. Russia will be reunified, and it will be the nation with the best army that reunites it. We will make sure that is us."

 ### Regional Diplomacy ###
 SAM_foreign_observers: "Foreign Observers"
 SAM_foreign_observers_desc: "We may not officially be in charge of a "country" at the moment, but we are more than ready for diplomacy. West Russia is the most prosperous and orderly it has been in at least ten years, and the size and influence of the ROA is a signal to foreigners that we mean business. That said, our potential partners are understandably somewhat cagey. Russia has been isolated for enough time that few international leaders know quite what to expect.\n\nTo start off, we can reassure them that we are open for a warm and mutually beneficial relationship with any power willing to support us. Allowing observers into the ROA, while not much, will lay the groundwork for further military cooperation. Should we show the Americans that our love for freedom matches theirs? Should we show the Japanese that we too have a healthy respect for order and a fierce loathing of communism? Decisions, decisions..."

 SAM_the_samara_declaration: "The Samara Declaration"
 SAM_the_samara_declaration_desc: "The Smolensk Declaration has long been seen as a useless scrap of paper. Signed during the West Russian War, it declares the Soviet Government a historical aberration and announces the right of every citizen of the former Soviet Union to freedom and self-determination. A scrap of paper as it may be, the Smolensk Declaration has been the start of our glorious campaign to free Russia from her enemies.\n\nA new declaration has been issued in Samara, where our men broke free from German servility. This new document will paper over our controversial history and present anew the ROA as the organism of liberation and unification of all of Russia. The declaration will equally denounce foreign interference in Russian affairs, and warn the world of our resolve for a strong and independent motherland."

 SAM_charm_offensive: "Charm Offensive"
 SAM_charm_offensive_desc: "In the Samara Declaration we've clearly stated to the world that the ROA is not, and shall never be, a tool of the Germans. Now, we must work to minimize our past ties to the German occupiers if we're to receive international recognition.\n\nThere are, of course, various angles to strike at. Italians, Americans, and Japanese among many others might be delighted to see a unified Russia emerge on Germany's doorstep. We can equally underscore our opposition to communism and hint the breakdown of our relations with Germany as a cause for future conflict with the collapsing Reich."

 SAM_nordic_help: "The Nordics' Help"
 SAM_nordic_help_desc: "With Europe aflame in the aftermath of the German Civil War, and with Central Asia and Siberia in chaos, our main connection to the outside world goes through the Nordic countries. Norway and Sweden are in the Pakt's orbit, and all share a complicated past with us. Nevertheless, we possess resources and opportunities that may tempt at least one of these governments to serve as trade intermediaries with the wider world."

 SAM_foreign_business: "Foreign Business"
 SAM_foreign_business_desc: "If we're to rebuild a strong Russia, then we must welcome all those that wish to do business here. International capital and expertise will help bring us into the modern age!\n\nAt least, that is the theory. In practice few people dare invest in an untested nation that has just emerged from a violent set of civil wars, with an uncertain future. We must appeal to the few that are brave (or foolish) enough to invest in our country. Special economic zones, privileged government contracts and a few good old bribes might sweeten the deal for our new international friends."

 ### Regional Diplomacy Bunyachenko ###
 SAM_business_contacts: "Business Contacts"
 SAM_business_contacts_desc: "The international business community was understandably hesitant to invest in Russia when it was dominated by warlordism and anarchy. It is hard to make a profit when your potential customers are fighting for their lives and focused on not starving. But now that we have restored a measure of stability to our corner of Russia we may be able to attract some investment from overseas. Corporations from Italy, America, and Japan might be persuaded to at least look into expanding their operations into Russia. The promise of a government that is friendly to capitalism and eager to establish economic ties with the outside world just might be enough to get them to overlook the dangers of investing in an ongoing warzone."

 SAM_contacts_with_moskowien_bunyachenko: "Contacts with Moskowien"
 SAM_contacts_with_moskowien_bunyachenko_desc: "It is no secret that the situation in Reichskommissariat Moskowien is unstable, and that is putting it mildly. The German efforts to settle the territory have proven insufficient to out-populate the native Russians, who have been forced to live as an oppressed majority in their former homeland. The Germans want less Russians in Mosowien and the Russians don't want to be ruled by the Germans. There is a solution that benefits both parties, but more importantly it benefits us most of all. Using our contacts in Moskowien, we can create an immigration program that will resettle tens of thousands of Russians from the Reichskommissariat to within our borders. This immigration will greatly increase our population and bring fresh recruits for the army straight to our doorstep."

 SAM_russia_stable_and_orderly: "Russia, Stable and Orderly!"
 SAM_russia_stable_and_orderly_desc: "The Russian nation has existed for centuries, but our government is still young, and we have not yet made a strong impression on the world stage. We must take the initiative and define ourselves before our enemies can slander us in the eyes of the great powers. The Provisional Commissariat of Western Russia shall be known as a beacon of law and order in a chaotic world. We will lead by example, standing against the evils of communism and Nazism and defending the stability of our region. All across the globe, nations shall look upon Russia and know that it can be counted on to do what is right. We will reclaim the Motherland's status as a bulwark against anarchy!"

 ### Regional Diplomacy Zykov ###
 SAM_open_our_doors: "Open Our Doors"
 SAM_open_our_doors_desc: "It is certain that our previous work for the German dogs has done much to taint our young nation in the eyes of the world. This does not mean that we should resign ourselves to this fate.\n\nWe've already established contact with the intelligence community in a number of country. By now inviting a range of NGOs and civilian officials, we can show the world we have nothing to hide. This way we can begin to grow a new narrative, one of a burgeoning democracy in Western Russia.\n\nOf course, nothing must be left to chance, and so the sights shown to our visitors will be carefully arranged. Honesty is like sugar in coffee; having too much of it can turn a sweet thing to undrinkable sludge."

 SAM_contacts_with_moskowien_zykov: "Contacts with Moskowien"
 SAM_contacts_with_moskowien_zykov_desc: "The situation out west in the former lands of Moskowien is... Confused. This, Chairman Zykov assures us, can be played to our advantage.\n\nThe Wehrmacht has long maintained a strictly militarized border with the Russian warlord states. These garrisons served the double purpose of keeping warlords out and Russians second class citizens in. Now, the changing situation in Moskowien and in Germany has blown big holes in the border, and our Russian brothers look hesitantly to the east. If we reassure them that a safe and strong Russia is on the rise here, our brethren might start making the trip east.\n\nSuch a migration would increase our population, and earn Chairman Zykov more devoted supporters. The Germans are likely to chafe at the indignity of seeing their slaves run free, but what can they do about it?"

 SAM_russia_strong_and_free: "Russia, Strong and Free!"
 SAM_russia_strong_and_free_desc: "In every heart, both in Russia and abroad, shines a little light of hope! Under Chairman Zykov a free Russia rises, guaranteeing its citizens' safety and dreams. Under Chairman Zykov, a strong Russia rises, able to crush every other pretender and liberate Russia!\n\nIn every heart shines hope, safe for in the elites in Germania. There, one hopes, the hope of millions of Russian casts shadows on the future of the illegitimate Reich!"

 ### Regional Diplomacy Oktan ###
 SAM_contacts_abroad: "Contacts Abroad"
 SAM_contacts_abroad_desc: "One of the most obvious benefits of the new Grand Marshal is his deep web of contacts and smugglers that winds its way through Russia and beyond - a Frankenstein's Monster of German, collaborator, Russian, or otherwise foreign individuals and networks that Mikhail Oktan has long taken advantage of. While this has previously benefited Oktan and those he chose to bestow his gifts upon in exchange for favors and loyalty, it's time for these smugglers to benefit all of Russia!\n\nOktan will talk to those that he has bought east of the Urals to see if they, or anyone that they know who is anyone of anywhere would be willing to play for the ROA's team. The Grand Marshal, of course, has ensured that anyone who is willing to cooperate with the Committee will be handsomely rewarded - considering how well he has treated his officers thus far, we can expect that many will be tempted by his offer."

Any man worth his grain of salt and his mother knows that you can't simply stash money under the proverbial mattress - especially if the sheer volume of it comes anywhere close to what Oktan's been bringing in ever since he assumed control. Some of the Grand Marshal's more economically-minded friends have suggested a two-pronged method of dealing with what Oktan calls "suffering from success."\n\nAnonymous bank accounts in the names of dead ROA officers or fabricated individuals will be created in Russian banks and slush funds will be sought abroad to help secure retirement money for the most honored of Russia's heroes, Oktan included of course, as well as to help pool foreign investments and keep the money in the hands of those wise enough to use it correctly."

 SAM_cashing_out_deals_with_the_fritzes_desc: "It's no secret that our military conquests in Western Russia have ruffled a few feathers to the west, in the German giant. Despite their entropic slide into disarray, the Germans are still a power to be feared - and respected.\n\nHowever, more importantly, we need to make sure that the very, very long list of favors that Mikhail Oktan has earned from the Fritzes and Hanses of Germany need to be accounted for and "cashed in", so to speak, before the Germans refuse to cooperate with us entirely. We'll start with the most wishy-washy and the ones who have the most to lose, working our way down to the most corrupt border guard; whatever happens, we'll take whatever they're offering and more. The Grand Marshal makes sure that he always gets what he's owed."

The Americans are certainly no fools - at least, their politicians aren't. But the bleeding-hearts behind western charities intent on alleviating poverty certainly don't. The Grand Marshal has ordered the creation of an organization, officially not associated with his government. The Organizatsiya po Bezopasnosti Russkogo Narodna, or OBRN, in English the Organization for the Security of the Russian people is what it will be called.\n\nOktan has announced to the people that through this organization, "food and books for all of Russia" will be made available. While this may be true, it's certainly not the intent of the NGO - not only will foreign aid come through the OBRN and mysteriously disappear, it's a perfect front for the money laundering needs of some of Oktan's friends."

"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..."\n\nThe Grand Marshal, ever the shrewd statesman, has devised a plan to disrupt our German enemies to the west. By using his contacts in Moskowien, Oktan has managed to encourage a number of people, refugees, patriots, or otherwise to abandon the Reichskommissariat in favour of the land controlled by the Committee. Not only will this bolster the available manpower for our factories and our armies, which seem to be growing by the day, the mass migrations of these refugees will seriously disrupt the Germans and their ability to control the so-called "porous border" between us and their easternmost Reichskommissariat."

 SAM_new_business_relationship_desc: "It's no secret that the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia is the dominant force in the west of Russia, and indeed, perhaps throughout the rest of what once constituted the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Back when Mikhail Oktan and his allies were etching out a meager existence around the city of Samara, a lot of the now-Grand Marshal's "friends" enjoyed impartial and unbalanced agreements with Oktan, who tolerated these arrangements only because he had little choice in the matter.\n\nNow, however, with the might of Western Russia behind him and the rapidly-recovering industrial power that has shown itself to come with the territory, Oktan is now in a position to renegotiate his prior arrangements.

Oktan has sought out mercenaries all around the globe, encouraging them to come and work for him and him only. These mercenaries, kept loyal by Oktan's seemingly bottomless pockets, will not only serve as a personal bodyguard to the Grand Marshal, but will also do the wetwork that Oktan deems either inappropriate or otherwise too important for his Russian subordinates to see through.\n\nAfter all, Oktan's political rivals won't liquidate themselves.

 SAM_scaling_down_emergency_rule: "Scaling Down Emergency Rule"
 SAM_scaling_down_emergency_rule_desc: "More than a few expected our government to fold under the twin threat of military and civilian rebellion. Now that these two sources of discontent have cooled to a simmering menace, and with the end of warlordism in Russia, we must scale back emergency rule.\n\nThis could mean many things to many different people. Proposed measures include an end to emergency deployment of the ROA, a return to civilian self rule in several aspects of daily life, and a transition from our command economy to a more open one.\n\nAs such, the Chairman is expected to propose a new set of directives to provincial governors. These instructions will help set the tone for the emergence of a new Russia."

 SAM_a_constitutional_convention: "A Constitutional Convention"
 SAM_a_constitutional_convention_desc: "Few things cause more instability than unclear laws and an ill defined future. Our new Chairman has thus seen fit to call a constitutional convention in our capital. This meeting of KONR grandees, senior ROA officers as well as civilian advisors and partners will help determine the shape of Russia's new government. Ending the eternal martial law will do much to legitimize our state, and help enact the vision of our Chairman and his faction for our nation's future."

 SAM_legislative_matters: "Legislative Matters"
 SAM_legislative_matters_desc: "No modern government can function without a legislative branch willing to debate and create every possible type of law needed to run a nation. Ideally, this legislative branch would be well advised, and capable of maintaining year after year a coherent body of laws able to steer Russia.\n\nThis is all basic stuff, and well agreed upon by the members of the ROA elite. However, few agree on how such a legislative body should be staffed. Some propose elections, while others favor appointed technocrats chosen by a committee. A surprising amount of arguments in favor of keeping the legislative separated from the executive have spread throughout the convention, as fears of our Chairman entrenching himself as a dictator remain high.\n\nInto this mess, we must bring order and purpose. We shall shape the legislative to our liking."

 SAM_judiciary_matters: "Judiciary Matters"
 SAM_judiciary_matters_desc: "So far, the majority of important court cases have been conducted by ROA military judges. While this arrangement remained functional throughout the warlord era, the limits of the system make reform important. Military judges are too few in number to cover all criminal law, let alone tender to civil and business cases.\n\nThere will thus be a need to give at least some power to an independent judiciary. How powerful and how important this judiciary will be remains subjects that are hotly debated. The Chairman's input is likely to tilt the balance in one way or another."

 SAM_executive_matters: "Executive Matters"
 SAM_executive_matters_desc: "If the legislative proposes law and the judiciary interprets laws, it falls to the executive to enact laws.\n\nThe ROA has always had a clear chain of command, with well defined role for each rank with regard to accomplishing various tasks. Heading into the murky, multipolar world of civilian rule, some propose maintaining a similar structure: the Chairman of the ROA and his cadre of officers are free to implement laws and select their successors. Others argue once more for some level of civilian input in the executive. Others still wish a separation of the head of state from the grubby business of administering the nation, freeing the Chairman from having to micro manage everything.\n\nAs the conference progresses, a decision is expected to emerge soon."

 SAM_ministry_of_truth: "Ministry of Truth"
 SAM_ministry_of_truth_desc: "The ROA's military intelligence bureau has long kept tabs on communist agitators, German infiltrators, labor unionists and other assorted discontents. As part of our transition into a modern nation state, many have called for our security apparatus to be reinforced.\n\nThis is a delicate matter, as any secret police would accrue great power over our nation. The Chairman has thus asked advisors to present a plan of action to create an efficient and loyal security ministry for Russia."

 SAM_education: "Education"
 SAM_education_desc: "Our education system began as merely an outgrowth of our soldier training program. Smart, literate kids were encouraged to learn the variety of technical trades needed for a modern army. As our nation has grown, civilian teaching institutions have begun popping up, trying to increase literacy and scrape together however many engineers and doctors could be found.\n\nThe time has now come for even more fundamental education reforms. Every child will receive standard education, with technical institutes offering cheap and rapid training into valuable trades. Meanwhile, more gifted pupils will be guided to reopened universities. Even more important than natural resources is the population of Russia, our greatest weapon in the upcoming struggles."

 SAM_social_net: "Social Net"
 SAM_social_net_desc: "Keeping the population fed so it stays out of our way has been a great way to lower discontent, but man does not live on bread alone. Homelessness has always been endemic to the Russian anarchy, and our new economy threatens to render many more men and women homeless as we clamp down on unemployment and squatting.\n\nWhile we've no patience for freeloaders, a token social net would not go amiss to continue stabilizing public opinion for our government. The old, the infirm and the orphans have either given their all for Russia, or still have productive years ahead. By assuring them housing and healthcare in some capacity we reassure the population that we have their interests at heart."

The origin of our own government in particular is a complicated subject. The fact that the ROA was created to collaborate with the Nazis makes it easy to mistake it for an army of traitors. The students of Russia must be kept away from this seductive lie. We will teach them the truth, that President Bunyachenko did what was necessary to rid Russia of the Bolshevik menace and created an army of true patriots who fought for the freedom of all Russians. We took help from all who offered it, including the Germans, knowing that the righteousness of our cause was all that mattered."

Our government has its citizen's best interests at heart at all times, and we are not so afraid of criticism that we must silence it like the Tsars or the communists did. We will allow for the formation of opposition parties that can receive representation in the controlled lower house of parliament. These parties will offer a home for those who are critical of our government while also keeping them out of our way.

Many of these men have fought constantly for decades, first under the brutal yoke of the communists and then in the armies of the warlords that rose to power in the collapse. We can never repay the debt we owe to the men who made everything we have accomplished possible, but we must try. If even a single veteran wonders how he will afford his rent or pay for his next meal we have failed. Their pensions must be increased, so they do not have to work in their old age. Programs to provide homes for them must be created, so they are not forced to sleep in the streets of the nation they risked their lives for. Russia's veterans are its heroes, and we will not let our heroes down."

The economy has come roaring back, and is only continuing to grow as more factories and businesses spring up like weeds, more appearing every day. This resurgence has been powered by a collaboration between the people and the government. The labourers of Russia work long hours, often in unpleasant conditions and for little pay, but they know their efforts are rewarded in other ways. The government cares for the people, providing welfare and assistance to those who need it and ensuring every Russian is doing their part to rebuild the Motherland. With the state's guidance, economic and industrial expansion is guaranteed. A modern Russian nation has finally risen from the ashes."

As such, it is important that our political party Unity gives back to the people as much as possible.\n\nWe shall establish regional associations of the party, responsible for helping our local candidates as well as in charge of distributing help and services. Through charity drives and lobbying on behalf of poorer region, we can show the people of Russia that Chairman Zykov is working for the common man, and that it would be unwise to vote for anyone else in the elections."

This new nation is a beacon of stability and prosperity, where even the poorest farmers and workers can enjoy the fruits of their labor and are proud to call themselves Russian. The people have faith in the strength of their government, knowing that we have their interests at heart and will fight to defend their freedom.

The Grand Marshal has instituted what he refers to as a "nationwide talent drive" to bring all of those who may have some academic or scientific value to his provisional capital.\n\nWhile this has earned some degree of ire from a number of our subordinates in the more distant or developed provinces, it will ensure the primacy of the Grand Marshal's influence within Russian sciences, technology, and progress. All Russians shall follow the example that is put forward by the intelligentsia gathered through Oktan's talent drive!"

 SAM_ministry_of_the_interior_desc: "The Committee of the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia and its associated Russian Liberation Army have done well not only to establish Mikhail Oktan's domain over Western Russia, but also to ensure that all of the land that they conquered is administered properly: by military officers in the pocket of Oktan, as it should be. However, the Grand Marshal made it so that each fief given out was approximately the same size as the others.\n\nWhile this means that each one is a fair parcel of land, it also means that by necessity, there's a whole bunch of them that were parcelled out. Because of how fragmented these territories have become, we need to have a bureaucracy dedicated only to managing and keeping track of them all. This will be Oktan's Ministry of the Interior - a bureaucratic masterpiece meant to prevent competition and discord between the statelets."

 SAM_nationalist_fervor: "Nationalist Fervor"
 SAM_nationalist_fervor_desc: "It's no secret that the masses, Russian or otherwise, need something to be guided towards and occupied by. For the Americans, it's their obsession with democracy. In East Asia, it's the drive for profit. The Germans' love to hate. Here, in Russia, it needs to be the love of Russia and hatred for the German.\n\nNo self-respecting Russian can live their life without knowing their enemy to the west. That's what we'll tell them, at least. By flaming the fires of nationalism and leaning the people towards and into the love of Russia and her savior Mikhail Oktan, the masses will not only be controlled by the ROA, but will be used by the ROA."

 SAM_expand_the_committee_of_national_liberation: "Expand the Committee of National Liberation"
 SAM_expand_the_committee_of_national_liberation_desc: "The Grand Marshal has brought up a good point - the general apolitical nature of the Committee has lead to the detachment of the officers who rule the nation and those that they rule over. This will not do, he has stipulated.\n\nDuring his long tenure among the Nazis, Oktan has learned much about the importance of merging political and military apparatuses. Thus, the Grand Marshal has gone about assigning the task of transforming the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia into a truly political party that will ultimately be a very, very long arm of Mikhail Oktan.\n\nLocal branches of the KONR will be established in towns and cities, membership will be encouraged, and the tenets of anti-Bolshevism and support of the Grand Marshal will be instilled in all those who join. Mandatory youth groups will also be established, to train Russia's young as the next generation of soldiers - to have perfect discipline and many years of soldiering experience before even entering the army."

It is a nation of law and order, where the peasants and laborers take pride in their nation and respect their superiors. Across Western Russia the new system of military garrisons is taking root, and the rewards are already pouring in. Productivity in rural areas has increased significantly under the ROA's rule, and the government is profiting more every day. The great cities of Russia are also prospering under the control of local Fascist Councils, who work to preserve the glory and maximize the output of the Motherland's urban centers. Ruling over all of this is Oktan and his army, the saviors of the nation who continue to guide Russia forward."

 SAM_bread_on_the_table_desc: "The establishment of Moskowien cut a sizable quantity of Russia's arable land away from its free population. This, combined with the breakdown of trade within the territory of the former Soviet Union, has made food insecurity endemic. We were lucky to possess at least some of the remaining arable land during our stay in Samara; now that we control all of Western Russia, many of our new territories have spent a decade teetering on the brink of famine. Chief among them are the lands of the fallen WRRF, near Arkhangelsk.\n\nIn the longer term we can expect shifts in population as regions in the south of our nation see internal migration. In the meantime, we must tend to the matter of food security. Ensuring stable access to basic stables such as bread will do much to legitimize our state among our new subjects."

 SAM_infrastructure: "Infrastructure"
 SAM_infrastructure_desc: "It is all well and good that our government now has a well defined constitution; if its authority is to reach beyond the towns and garrisons, we must improve our infrastructure!\n\nFortunately, even the German bombings and the wars of unification have not completely annihilated Russian infrastructure. Our regional rivals had launched infrastructure programs of their own before the unification war, and we have inherited their incomplete projects. With just a little bit of resources and effort, we can complete a nationwide grid of roads and rail lines. Goods and people shall move from one corner to another of Russia!"

 SAM_industrial_policy: "Industrial Policy"

Freed from the German bombings and from the sclerotic economy of the Bolsheviks, Russian hard work and ingenuity has been set free. This does not mean, however, that the private sector will be left free to run entirely unrestricted. Several important sectors of the economy such as weapons development and energy production could do well as either state-run businesses or public-private partnerships. Government presence in the industry would also be a useful area to store political allies. As such, an upcoming conference will determine our nation's industrial policy."

As our grain reserve grows, it becomes possible to turn part of it into feed for pigs and chickens. Raising the quantity of animal proteins available to our state will improve the rations of our soldiers, as well as make meat much cheaper for Russian families. No longer merely surviving, the men and women of Russia will turn toward the future, their stomachs filled with nourishing food!"

We can help this process along by listening to our economical experts and strengthen emerging supply chains with even better infrastructure and ever greater investment in labor training. A diversified and strong economy shall be the reward!"

As such, despite our isolated geopolitical and economical position we must seek ways to import.\n\nOur rivals in eastern Siberia are a limited source of trade. Old smuggling lines into Moskowien and the Reich might equally prove useful, as do paths going through Scandinavia. Finally, a stabilizing situation in Central Asia might offer other opportunities.\n\nWe shall be landlocked no longer!"

In particular the return of caffeinated hot drinks will be much lauded throughout our nation."

 SAM_jam_and_tea_oktan_desc: "Life as a civilian during the reign of the warlords was harsh. Simple amenities that even the incompetent Soviets could provide became scarce luxuries in the two decades of anarchy Russia endured. Now that we have consolidated our rule over Western Russia, we can begin importing some of these goods once more. Jam and tea, honey and wine, silk and jewelry. All of these and many more will soon return to Russia, but not for just anyone. Only those who have proven themselves to be of use to us will be able to buy them.

If they had it their way, the corporate giants of the world would transform Russia into one giant consumer, a country where everything can be bought and nothing can be produced. This cannot be allowed to happen. To safeguard against foreign exploitation we should work with the Kombinats to increase domestic production while reducing imports of finished products wherever possible. There is nothing wrong with buying American steel and Japanese rubber, as long as we can decide what is built."

Indeed, it was only by creating antagonism between the two that the traitorous Bolsheviks could take power. We will make sure that this can never happen again by setting regulations for each sector of our economy to protect both the workers and the companies. The government shall serve as the arbiter of all labor disputes, but we will also make these disputes less frequent. By establishing uniform salaries for positions in every industry and founding state-run unions to represent the interests of employees we can defend both the rights of the entrepreneur and the dignity of the worker. With the unions under our control we will be able to protect our workers from exposure to the radical left-wing ideologies that so easily infect private unions."

We must be ever vigilant against this threat, for it has already brought the Motherland low once. A new internal security service should be created, tasked with monitoring the workers of Russia, especially those who are involved in labor unions. These labor police will work in the open and under cover, on the factory floor and in the back room where plotters meet. The only way to separate the socialist agents from the honest laborers they try to deceive is with constant oversight.

There is so much to be done, and so many missing working age men.\n\nThere are endless opportunities for advancement for citizens willing to work hard. The rebuilding of the Motherland offers bountiful work, and for those who show initiative a life of plenty awaits. Our state will give back to those who give without reservation to their nation. On the flip side, those that shall spurn the duties and rewards of rebuilding the state will receive no mercy. Our work bringing labor unions into line has shown that we will not tolerate trouble makers. Workers who continue to persevere in their attempt to subvert the state will be punished. Integrating police element within key industrial sectors will ensure we always have eyes and ears on the ground.\n\nPresident Bunyachenko and the Army of National Liberation have fought hard for Russian citizens to be given the opportunities of this age of rebuilding. Those who spurn the chance to earn their bread through dutiful work will receive the stick. The nation has no patience for lay-abouts and disobedient citizens."

Supporting their growth has proven to be a wise decision, but now some of the owners are beginning to chafe under our guidance. The Kombinats cannot be allowed to grow too independent of our rule, and the best way to maintain their dependence on the government is through a method known as "window guidance." Window guidance is a technique mastered by the Japanese central bank that involves encouraging bank investment in companies that comply with the government's advice. By creating a new national bank of Russia we will centralize our state's financial power and consolidate control over Russia's most powerful corporations."

Both the Tsars and the Soviets invested massive amounts of time and resources into attempting to industrialize an agrarian nation. Sometimes they succeeded, but more often their efforts stalled, accomplishing little. We have managed to succeed where they failed. Under our control Western Russia has finally industrialized, joining the rest of the civilized world at long last.\n\nEvery day millions of Russians go to work in thousands of factories from Arkhangelsk to Samara. Russian business empires are beginning to make a name for themselves not just in Russia but around the world.

These unions will be monitored for any sign of socialist infiltration, and all non-legal unions will be squashed.

Without a vast ecosystem of small and medium enterprises, our vast government arsenals would be unable to produce the quantity of war material necessary. On top of this crucial purpose, small and medium enterprises give work and purpose to members of the community.\n\nUnfortunately Russia is a difficult place for businessmen.

Others have many conflicting land claims, leaving them masters of either too little or too much land.

What's more, other peasants are simply refugees from Moskowien or from elsewhere in Russia and they have no village to vouch for their request for land.\n\nThus, our land distribution commission has had its task expanded. We shall break up large farms owned by absentee landlords and redistribute them to landless peasants.

We can now put the finishing touches to our great and moral economy.\n\nGiven the means to take care of their future, and their family's, by the state, the Russian population finally begins to see the ROA and its Chairman as leaders and builders rather than as foreign stooges.

Good thing we're the government.\n\nThrough the use of bribes and pay-offs, and no small application of intimidation and force, we can ensure that the land that we need to secure for our projects will be made freely available to us. The concept of eminent domain has long been used in Europe and abroad when the government needed to make way for progress.

Not only does this mean that almost all of what's leaving the country has to go through his hands, but anything that's coming in as well - large amounts of money are not only going to the federal treasury, but to Oktan's pockets specifically, which he will use for what he sees fit."

For God's sake, they need to find SOMETHING to do - we can barely afford to distribute food and wealth to our army and continue to have a functioning civilian sector, let alone spare anything for them... especially if they're not interested in doing anything for us. A man's work is his pride, and these refugees are clearly comfortable in their shame. We can't let this go on."

 SAM_corporate_exclaves: "Corporate Exclaves"
 SAM_corporate_exclaves_desc: "We have already witnessed a number of foreign corporations from around the world express interest and even go so far as to invest into our economy. This is awesome - even the preliminary interest and investment has caused a surge of confidence among the markets and the people. The Grand Marshal has laid out a plan - with the assistance of his closest economic advisors, of course - to help encourage these foreign firms to make landfall in Russia.\n\nOktan has proposed that a number of special economic zones, both delineated by geographical range as well as market niches, be created and maintained by the federal government. This will not only help embolden the corporations in making roots in Russia, but it will also help jumpstart the economy that we've been struggling with for so long."

 SAM_everyone_back_to_work_desc: "With our efforts to kick the economy back into motion a success, it is time to sit back and reap the rewards. Our factories have roared to life as never before, with a stream of goods flowing to the markets within our territory. And now that the economy is strengthened, it falls to those who made it so to skim a little off the top. After all entrepreneurship and foresight must have its reward, and Mikhail Oktan himself will be the first to choose a slice of the pie."

 ### Superregional Zykov ###
 SAM_zykov_new_territories: "The New Territories"
 SAM_zykov_new_territories_desc: "Our struggle for the land east of the Urals wasn't an easy one, but we're the clear victor, and now our administration spans from German-occupied Russia's borders in the West to points well beyond the impressive Ural Mountains. But just because we won the battle doesn't mean that we've won the peace: much work must still be done to ensure that we win the hearts and minds of our new populations over.\n\nIt's time to prepare our new land for its integration into our fledgling democratic system. Already, Zykov's agents and administrators have been making inroads in Western Siberia, setting up polling stations and educational areas to prepare the long-oppressed people of Siberia for the onset of democracy, even if it isn't a perfect one. Yet."

 SAM_zykov_partial_elections_for_the_east: "Partial Elections for the East"
 SAM_zykov_partial_elections_for_the_east_desc: "While democracy is coming to Siberia, it's still a fledgling, fragile democracy, and thus we should make sure that the people know how important it is to be voting for the right parties. We've already selected a number of our candidates from west of the Urals to cross the mountains and run as candidates there, but it's also a good idea to make sure that we find some local individuals who would be willing to work as members of our Yedinstvo party.\n\nRunning our own candidates and selecting local affiliates is far from the only thing that we should do to make sure that Siberia is firmly under our control - as the voice of the people, of course. Certain measures should be taken to make sure that Yedinstvo is not just an established, but the preeminent, party. Gerrymandering, in some form, will ensure that Zykov's representatives will remain the ascendant democratic force even far beyond the Urals."

 SAM_zykov_backroom_deals: "Backroom Deals"
 SAM_zykov_backroom_deals_desc: "Our own candidates aren't the only democrats in Siberia. When we liberated the area from our rivals, we were approached by a number of prominent individuals and their supporters in the hopes that we would help establish a functioning democracy in the region. This, of course, is something that we plan to do - eventually - and these individuals will be able to help us do it.\n\nWe'll need to make sure that these individuals, who are businessmen, local politicians, and ex-military men are on our side and members of the Yedinstvo, no matter the cost. Some of these men have already indicated that perhaps certain "deals" could be worked out between Zykov's administration in Samara and themselves: loyalty for a price."

 SAM_zykov_preparing_the_elections: "Preparing the Elections"
 SAM_zykov_preparing_the_elections_desc: "Regardless of how we plan on approaching the democratic question in Siberia, there does need to be some cursory preparation for the actual elections themselves. For years, the people in this region have suffered under tyrants and dictators, let alone, before that, the Soviet system. Almost none of the people in our newly acquired territories remember, let alone understand, the importance of democracy.\n\nThus, a lot of work must be done to ensure that our new territory is properly prepared for the coming elections. People must be made aware of voting - how to do it, where and when, and, perhaps most importantly: why. Furthermore, we have to look at the administrative side of things, creating voting districts, hiring administrators and bureaucrats to ensure that votes are collected, tallied, and reported on correctly."

 SAM_zykov_let_the_easterner_run: "Let the Easterner Run..."
 SAM_zykov_let_the_easterner_run_desc: "Despite what the army may want, Zykov is still the man in charge - and the Chairman envisions a functioning democracy for all Russians. Ultimately, our new citizens are still just that: citizens of our republic. And thus, they should be treated as such.\n\nOf course, we will encourage as many people as possible to join and vote for Yedinstvo, but at the end of the day, no free nation forces its people to support a party that they're not invested in. The people should be given a choice - a real choice - to determine their future. This will ensure that our young and fragile democracy inspires real hope among the people."

 SAM_zykov_under_restraints: "...Under Restraints"
 SAM_zykov_under_restraints_desc: "Of course, while it's always important to ensure that the people have a real voice and a right to self-determination, it's risky for us to completely allow the Russians of Siberia - with the weight of years of tyranny and oppression weighing on their shoulders - to vote wantonly for anyone that may rouse populist whims, filling the people's heads with sweet nothings.\n\nEven if we are to allow free and unadulterated election results in most of the East, there may be need to... work some things out. A district reshuffling here, and a small transfer of money there will ensure that the Yedinstvo will have an actual presence in the places where they need to."

 SAM_zykov_from_chairman_to_president: "From Chairman to President"
 SAM_zykov_from_chairman_to_president_desc: "Miletiy Zykov, former Chairman of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, abbreviated as KONR in Cyrillic, has set in motion his ultimate design: the complete dismantlement of KONR and the ultimate transition from his role as Chairman of the committee to the President of the new Russian Republic.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he has not only won, but swept the first free elections in Russia in decades. Now that he is serving in an official capacity as the civilian head of state for the Russian Republic, and as Russia has now been liberated, there is little need for the KONR anymore - they have achieved their stated goal. Of course, the actual abolition of KONR may be a little more difficult than signing a piece of legislature: the organization is thick with bureaucratic red tape, and has its tendrils in every part of the new republic's administration."

 SAM_zykov_consolidating_business: "Consolidating Business"
 SAM_zykov_consolidating_business_desc: "One of the surprising products of Russia's warlord era was the beginning and expansion of a number of businesses and corporations across Siberia and the Far East, operating in legal capacities or otherwise. Ever since our victories in the wars of unification, a lot of these businesses have been in legal limbo, some still operating while others are frozen for various reasons.\n\nWe should make a list of the businesses that have since emerged following the collapse of the Union and figure out which should be brought into the public sector of our burgeoning governmental sector, which should be encouraged to rejoin the now-official private sector of our economy, or simply be shut down entirely."

 SAM_zykov_assessing_the_army: "Assessing the Army"
 SAM_zykov_assessing_the_army_desc: "Despite the official dissolution of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, the army that has brought us victory thus far, and has since been integrated as the official Armed Forces of the Republic, does need its fair share of attention - Zykov remembers the loyal officers who helped make his vision a reality.\n\nThe President of the republic has ordered that a commission be set up to examine and assess the status of the republic's army, and figure out if and where more attention, funding, training, or otherwise, needs to be paid to our boys; Zykov knows full well that the army got him this far, and doesn't intend on losing their support any time soon."

 SAM_zykov_improving_the_unity_party: "Improving the Unity Party"
 SAM_zykov_improving_the_unity_party_desc: "Truthfully, the Unity Party, or Yedinstvo in Russian, is a mish-mash of ideologies primarily united by those associated with the former Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, those who were loyal to Zykov, and local prominent individuals who have been bought to help "manage" the republic's growth. Sometimes it feels as if the Unity Party is not a party at all, instead a voting bloc of various interest groups!\n\nTo ensure that the Unity Party remains united, the Chairman has decided to trim the party's fat, so to speak, by smoothing over the reconcilable differences, removing some of the more troublesome party members, and reinforcing his hegemony over the party. This way, Zykov will make sure that Yedinstvo will stay the dominant party, guided by an actual vision - Zykov's vision."

 SAM_zykov_new_partners_in_the_east: "New Partners in the East"
 SAM_zykov_new_partners_in_the_east_desc: "Some of Milety Zykov's most powerful allies were the various powerful and influential businessmen in Western Russia and the Urals. Not only did they fund him in return for what they believed would end up as a beneficial partnership between them, they also actively worked with the now-President to make sure that the Russian economy would be, in time, rapidly revitalized.\n\nOf course, while the Eastern half of Russia is much more sparse in terms of people, let alone wealthy businessmen, they certainly still exist. We should scour our new territories to find anyone who would be able to forge similar connections with the President and the party in return for their local support for Zykov's agenda."

 SAM_zykov_military_business_oversight: "Military Business Oversight"
 SAM_zykov_military_business_oversight_desc: "Long has the distinction between military officer and CEO been blurred for many members of the Russian Liberation Army, who have, for years, been both serving in the capacity of commissioned officers within our armed forces and leaders of businesses. This has come to be known as "military business oversight." For some time, this worked when the Russian Liberation Army was eking out an existence in the city of Samara, barely being able to hold its own against raiders, bandits, and German bombs. However, Zykov has done his best to ensure that this system, well-entrenched in parts of Western Russia, doesn't expand any further.\n\nDespite all best efforts, certain reports point to the further expansion of this system east of the Urals - a development that has alarmed the President and his supporters. Zykov has called for an immediate covert investigation into the expansion of this so-called "oversight." Whether or not he feels as if he can control it, or if he'll move to stem its growth is yet to be seen."

 SAM_zykov_democratic_officers: "Democratic Officers"
 SAM_zykov_democratic_officers_desc: "While the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia was, formally, entirely subservient to Zykov, the reality of the situation was much more complex, with a lot of more reactionary and troublesome individuals more interested in more authoritarian ways of governing... or worse. Truthfully, the old guard of the Russian Liberation Army and KONR have long been a thorn in the President's side, especially as they continue to grumble about Zykov's increasingly democratic vision.\n\nIt's time for this old guard to be put out to pasture. They've served long, and they've served hard, and it's for these exact reasons that these officers - well used to having a very present opinion in politics, should be replaced with a new generation of officers - free from the stains of collaboration and corruption, fresh faces, local faces, to help begin the process of depoliticizing the army."

 SAM_zykov_investing_in_talent: "Investing in Talent"
 SAM_zykov_investing_in_talent_desc: "The future of Russia is in the hands of the youth! As such, the youth deserve the best we can possibly offer, especially in terms of education. The President has decreed today that schools, be they primary, secondary, or post-secondary institutions, shall be all funded by the government, with generous research grants to be handed out to the most promising of scholars at all ages.\n\nOf course, while this is far from cheap, it's an investment - not one that will yield economic results, but an investment into the future of Russia, and, of course, the future of the Unity Party. After all, it was the Unity Party that sponsored the institutions and gave out the grants. And we will make sure that the new generation of talent will remember this - they shall serve Russia, but they will also serve Yedinstvo."

 SAM_zykov_army_on_the_march: "The Army on the March"
 SAM_zykov_army_on_the_march_desc: "The Russian Republic, while finally reunified and stabilized to a degree, is a new state in a turbulent world, where power shifts rapidly and tensions run high at the smallest of diplomatic slights. In this world, it would be a fool's errand to neglect a nation's armed forces - and the President has no intention of doing so.\n\nThe army marched to victory, marching east and pushing our rivals out of their bunkers, cities, and barracks. Now, our army must continue to march - to train, to drill, and to be ready for any future threat. A generous amount of funding shall be bestowed on the army, to keep them happy and combat-ready for when it comes time to look west and liberate the last of Russia."

 SAM_zykov_healthy_society: "A Healthy Society"
 SAM_zykov_healthy_society_desc: "Through no small effort from President Zykov and those who work under him, the foundations of what he has begun referring to as "the Healthy Society" have finally begun paying off. President Zykov has created a deep state within the new republic, a body of influential politicians, officers, and businessmen who all work towards the vision that the President has for the nation. The industries are booming, the people are feeling hopeful for the future and are slowly learning the intricacies of Zykov's democracy. And most of all - the military knows its place and is closely monitored by Zykov's friends in high places.\n\nThe dream of a true Russian Republic has never been closer - and the President knows that now, more than ever, the Russian people must be tempered for the future."

 SAM_zykov_statement_to_the_world: "A Statement to the World"
 SAM_zykov_statement_to_the_world_desc: "The President of our Republic has been working on what he calls "his first statement to the world." He has prepared to make this statement across international air waves, as well as on a very publicized broadcast domestically.\n\nZykov has formulated what he believes is the best path forward for Russia in the international sphere, now that he has finally unified the nation. Emphasizing the strength of Russia and unilaterally denouncing the Nazis as criminals and warmongers, Zykov also intends on praising the efforts of the United States and the Organization of Free Nations, which, he believes, will bring the Republic closer to the West, and by extension, those best equipped to help Russia when the time comes to push west and make whole the ROA's long journey towards a free, strong Russia."

 SAM_bunyachenko_beyond_the_urals_desc: "The rebirth of the Russian Republic began in West Russia, the most populous area beyond the reach of the Reich. Now, the Republic's future is strengthened by our capture of Western Siberia. The land beyond the Ural contains important industrial centers. More importantly, its rich oil fields are critical resources in our drive to reunite the Motherland.\n\nPresident Bunyachenko and his allies have big plans for the region. It is crucial we begin to integrate the new territories to our economy and strategic situation."

 SAM_bunyachenko_monitor_dissent: "Monitor Dissent"
 SAM_bunyachenko_monitor_dissent_desc: "The Committee for the Liberation of the People of Russia has come a long way in its goal to liberate Russia from Bolshevism with the defeat of the WRRF and now the capture of Western Siberia. Yet we are a long way from total victory. In the east, rivals to unification still stand. In the west, Germans rightfully live in fear of our further progress. And within our state, traitors scheme our downfall.\n\nIn the east, remnants of the communist program in Tyumen as well as fanatics of the defeated Black League are angry about our takeover. In the west, our industrial program has created a lot of winners and a lot of losers. Many agitate for further labor rights. Many of those agitating are useful idiots for communist remnants of the WRRF.\n\nWe must be vigilant, and monitor dissenting groups. The Republic must stand strong."

 SAM_bunyachenko_business_opportunity: "Business Opportunity"
 SAM_bunyachenko_business_opportunity_desc: "President Bunyachenko's decision to jumpstart our industrial development through Japanese inspired, vertically integrated financial groups has begun to give great results. Steel and energy production are skyrocketing; advanced goods such as military hardware and consumer electronics are beginning to roll out of the Kombinats' factories at ever greater speed.\n\nTo keep this momentum, the growing Kombinats must continue to expand, and establish themselves in the eastern territories. Resources there are endless; local businessmen underestimate the cunning and rapacity of our industrial collosi. By maintaining a carefully managed pool of great corporations, we can reap the benefits of centralised economic might with free market induced competition and evolution."

 SAM_bunyachenko_growing_prestige: "Growing Prestige"
 SAM_bunyachenko_growing_prestige_desc: "Rising economic and military might are nothing in politics without reputation. The image of a country, its prestige, forms the third leg of the power trinity wielded by all nations. In this regard, our young Republic is remarkably deficient. Our enemies are quick to remind us of our humble beginnings. They call our government a jumped up junta of collaborationist have-beens, led by a dour military officer. A loud but persistent minority of our citizens are likely to agree with this assessment, decrying our current economic miracle as exploitative and unjust.\n\nTo rectify this, our government shall engage in a calculated bout of "useful splendor." A few vanity projects here and there; a few high quality apartment buildings for journalists and members of the intelligentsia; a few visits from foreign journalists. Converting the budgetary equivalent of table scraps into soft power will give us yet another tool in our arsenal to crush all threats to Russia."

 SAM_bunyachenko_new_propaganda_tide: "A New Propaganda Tide"
 SAM_bunyachenko_new_propaganda_tide_desc: "President Bunyachenko is not shy about the errors he committed in his long life. However, he and his comrades in the ROA stand by the fact that helping turn the tide against the WRRF was not a mistake. Already the German empire decays, whereas communism endures across the world.\n\nWe must help convey this to all of the nation's population. The Reds' inability to defeat the Reich and restore stability to Russia was by far the greatest menace to our people's future. President Bunyachenko, aided by his wise advisors, is an epoch making man. An economic and industrial boom the like of which has only been seen so far in Manchuria is in the making, a veritable ecosystem of steel and progress wrought into existence through the Russian man's hard work. Our President has made this possible, and the ROA will make sure that the envious Germans are not able to violently bring it all down. Some may call this a propaganda campaign. How can the spreading of truth be mere propaganda?"

 SAM_bunyachenko_financial_stress_test: "Financial Stress Test"
 SAM_bunyachenko_financial_stress_test_desc: "The Japanese have long been pioneers of economic development, their Zaibatsu (or financial cliques) being one of the main inspirations for our own development program. This does not mean that the Sphere's moneymen are perfect; in their hubris, the Japanese have failed to put checks and balance on their financial systems. This came crashing down when piles of bad debts destroyed the Yasuda Zaibatsu and started the Japanese Economic Wars.\n\nTo avoid this fate we can use our central bank as a tool of defence. Every Kombinat will be forced to keep a certain amount of cash on hand, and keep an up to date plan to deal with a market downturn. Every year or so, agents of our government will be allowed to announce a surprise inspection, to verify the stability of each firm's finances. People trying to fudge numbers will be dealt with severely.\n\nThere will be no hubris here. We've come too far to let mere greed upset the stability of Russian recovery. The Kombinats are given great powers; they will owe us great responsibility. For the good of all."

 SAM_bunyachenko_feeding_the_kombinats: "Feeding the Kombinats"
 SAM_bunyachenko_feeding_the_kombinats_desc: "We've encountered a lot of new businesses in the eastern provinces. Our government has also inherited a lot of state owned enterprises from the fallen regimes of West Siberia.\n\nPresident Bunyachenko and his advisers recognize the importance of maintaining government ran businesses in critical sectors, such as energy and national defence. Our government of course also realizes the importance of a free market in a free and strong Russia. Nevertheless, many of these businesses in the eastern provinces are run by people with ties to opposition groups, or by personnel with little interest in our glorious national rejuvenation. As such our bureaucrats are drafting lists of corporations that need to go. Their assets will be auctioned off; their subsidiaries acquired by various Kombinats. This will raise money for the central government, and help the growth of our business partners, all the while reducing overlap in business."

 SAM_bunyachenko_feelers_to_foreigners: "Feelers to Foreigners"
 SAM_bunyachenko_feelers_to_foreigners_desc: "Part of the struggle for prestige is the quest for foreign recognition. The Russian people tire of being seen as poor and hopeless masses; showing our citizens that our state is admired and respected once more will be great for national pride.\n\nWe've already begun inviting foreigners to visit Russia; mostly foreign dignitaries and men from intelligence agencies at first. It is time to extend this policy to business men, journalists, and anyone else that controls the narrative about Russia. To aid this process we can send out our own people. Businessmen, yes, but also our youth. It is time for Russian youth to be given a chance to study abroad, to see the world that the German ogres have endeavored to deny them. They will be our ambassadors, proof that Russia endures!"

 SAM_bunyachenko_second_act_continues: "The Second Act Continues"
 SAM_bunyachenko_second_act_continues_desc: "The new eastern territories have been integrated into our nation successfully, without too great a strain to our efforts elsewhere. Our economy continues to purr, its growth given a great boost by the newly liberated land and resources. Having dealt with this issue, it is time to turn our attention elsewhere.\n\nEastern Russia still eludes us. In the meantime, the political structures built by President Bunyachenko are still fragile. It is important to continue the elimination of the old officer clique, even as we transition the ROA into the apolitical Republican Army.\n\nNo sacrifice is too great for the final war of liberation. President Bunyachenko will lead us to national vengeance and resurrection."

 SAM_bunyachenko_legislative_shuffling: "Legislative Shuffling"
 SAM_bunyachenko_legislative_shuffling_desc: "With our control over the eastern provinces now secure we can begin integrating them into our government and rolling back martial law. The first step in this process is to hold elections for the Duma in the east, ensuring that Russians on both sides of the Urals are represented in the lower house of the government. We should schedule these elections as quickly as we can, as they will legitimize our government in the eyes of many people who might otherwise resent our new rule.\n\nOf course, the Duma does not hold any real power in the government by design. We will be able to hold free and fair elections knowing that the outcome will not matter. While the people pick their candidates and believe they are participating in democracy, we will continue to steer Russia down the correct course, free of burdensome legislative restrictions and bickering politicians."

 SAM_bunyachenko_ending_the_armys_political_role: "Ending the Army's Political Role"
 SAM_bunyachenko_ending_the_armys_political_role_desc: "Once the army and the state were almost indistinguishable. Under Vlasov's rule officers and generals held all the power, and the government was barely more than a rubber stamp for their plans. This state of affairs hampered our efforts to reclaim Russia, politicizing the army and making the government inefficient. It is the role of the military to defend the state and the role of the government to administer it. Luckily Bunyachenko's ascension saw this problem begin to end as the old generals retired from both the military and politics. We should encourage this depoliticizing trend, appointing qualified and loyal commanders who understand their job is to serve the government, not run it."

 SAM_bunyachenko_rnr_for_the_troops: "RnR for the Troops"
 SAM_bunyachenko_rnr_for_the_troops_desc: "The Russian Army has fought incredibly hard to get this far. From its inception in the West Russian War to the anarchy of the warlord period to the bloody conquest of Western Russia to the reclamation of Western Siberia the soldiers have fought diligently for years, and we owe them our gratitude. There are more conflicts on the horizon, but before they begin our generals need time to plan and prepare.\n\nWhile the high command prepares for the next battles, we can reward those who will fight them with a vacation. Maintaining the morale of the soldiers on the ground is vital, and nothing boosts morale quite like a trip away from the barracks and the front lines. By the time the next war begins our troops will be refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to bring glory to Russia once more."

 SAM_bunyachenko_strategic_thinking: "Strategic Thinking"
 SAM_bunyachenko_strategic_thinking_desc: "Russia's economy and industry are finally recovering after decades of warfare, and as our production capabilities catch up with the rest of the world new options are becoming available to us. Once we were limited to arming our military with the few guns we could produce and whatever outdated tanks and planes we could convince the Germans to sell us. Now we are able to build a new generation of cutting edge Russian weapons that will stand with the finest products of Germany, America, and Japan. New interceptor aircraft will knock enemy planes from our skies, keeping our cities safe, while long-range missiles capable of striking anywhere on earth will force the great powers to take us seriously."

 SAM_bunyachenko_mission_to_tokyo_desc: "Across the vastness of Asia lies one of the great superpowers of the world: the Empire of Japan. Japan is the undisputed master of the east and wields incredible economic and military might. We would be fools not to court their approval. As we prepare to retake the far east of Russia and finally reunite the nation we should work to secure Japanese support for our endeavours.\n\nInviting diplomats will deepen our ties to the imperial government, while accepting Japanese businessmen will open the door to economic investment from some of the largest corporations in the world.\n\nIf all goes well, once we have reclaimed eastern Siberia there may even be further opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation."

 SAM_bunyachenko_sharing_the_playing_field: "Sharing the Playing Field"
 SAM_bunyachenko_sharing_the_playing_field_desc: "It is important to protect the Russian economy as it is being rebuilt, but we must not become so paranoid that we cut Russia off from all outside investment. Our domestic industries are now strong enough to stand up to foreign competition, and there is no one we would rather compete with than the Japanese. After the success of our diplomatic overtures to Tokyo, it is time to formally allow Japanese corporations to begin setting up shop in Russia. The investment from these massive financial empires will boost our economy, and the fear of losing customers to their new competitors will motivate Russian corporations to produce higher-quality products."

 SAM_bunyachenko_industrial_defence_act: "Industrial Defence Act"
 SAM_bunyachenko_industrial_defence_act_desc: "The Second World War exposed how vulnerable Russia's west is. Long, flat stretches of territory with few defensive features to shelter behind, it was a conqueror's dream. Now, as conflict with the Germans looms once more, our western provinces are under threat again. Just like last time our territory stretches for thousands of kilometers, but the majority of our industry is located within a few hundred of the enemy border. We must change this. All factories, especially those that produce military goods, capable of relocation will move east of the Urals towards Central Siberia. This will place them out of reach of all but the longest range bombers, and make sure our industry remains out of enemy hands."

 SAM_bunyachenko_japanese_toys: "Japanese Toys"
 SAM_bunyachenko_japanese_toys_desc: "The technological marvels we have witnessed coming out of Japan are nothing short of astonishing. Mobile missile batteries! Jets that are undetectable by RADAR! It seems there is no limit to what the Japanese can invent and we would be fools if we did not try to acquire some of their wondrous equipment. Our technological industry is not advanced enough to replicate these designs on our own, so we must ask for help from our new partners in the Pacific. It is quite unlikely the Japanese will be willing to give up their secrets for free of course. If necessary we would be more than happy to pay for the designs of these futuristic weapons and several hundred prototypes to get us started."

 SAM_bunyachenko_preparing_the_endgame_desc: "The time for the final conflict is drawing near. After countless deaths and years of preparation, Russia will finally be reunified under our flag. The Germans will be driven from Moscow, the Russian people will be liberated, and the humiliation of the last war will finally be avenged. Before we can tackle the Germans though we must deal with the issue of the east. Defeating the Nazis will require all of Russia working together, and for now eastern Siberia remains out of our control. We must reclaim Siberia, establish a permanent connection with our partners in Japan, and rally the Russian people for the great war of redemption. Only then will we be ready to strike."

 SAM_oktan_web_of_tensions_desc: "Even though everyone in the Russian State owes Oktan their undying loyalty and respect, it turns out that they have hardly any respect or loyalty to each other. Our people, our generals, and even our most trusted governors - our inner circle - have turned to devious intrigues and hidden machinations, and are quick to see conspiracy and favoritism in the shadows.

 ### Events ###
 SAM.1.t: "The Old Man"
 SAM.1.d: "Vlasov's aides walked constantly to-and-fro the old man's office, the tidal nature of their movement echoing the old man's current situation. Even in these desperate times, few could stomach working directly for the traitor general himself. Those that managed to either ignore or muster indifference towards the accusations against Vlasov found themselves buried in drudgery: bored out of their wits instead of merely disgusted by the stench of treason. Better, perhaps, to pray for an assignment on the border instead where death and starvation dispelled the lethargy.\n\nVlasov stood on political quicksand, his position shifting and changing by the day but never improving. Some of his aides suspected that the old man would have preferred being genuinely hated by his generals instead of their current indifference. In the college of traitors that filled the ROA's upper echelon, Vlasov was not particularly liked, but nor was he disliked. Whatever coalition or common ground he tried to build usually disintegrated within the month.\n\nBut if the old general could not be liked by everyone, he could at least try to gin up love and hatred within specific factions. Under him Zykov's democrats constantly agitated against Oktan's war profiteers. In between, schemed the Officer Committee, General Bunyachenko their puppet.\n\nVlasov had long pondered on which factions to cast his full and hollow weight behind. His remaining scraps of authority would tip the balance. Now that the time for a decision had come, the general's own aide could scarcely guess which side Vlasov would choose, nor how the ROA's future would play out as a result."
 SAM.1.a: "The Traitor General is not yet done."

 SAM.2.t: "Our Voice"
 SAM.2.d: ""Welcome, welcome!" Zykov had his bodyguard usher in Vlasov's aide, firmly holding on to the General's package. "It is good to see you, we never hear enough from Commander Vlasov."\n\nThe ever energetic propagandist of the ROA held a hazy position in the army's leadership. While not officially on the Officer Committee, Milety Zykov had wormed his way into a comfortable office in Samara's principal headquarters. Supporters of his faction could be seen streaming in and out at various times. A few stacks of pamphlets rested on the office's varied furniture.\n\nZykov almost yanked the package from the aide's hands after his swift introduction and began leafing through it, whistling all the while. "Interesting... interesting," were the propagandist's only comments. For his trouble, Vlasov's aide was given a new package. "Bring it to your boss, alright?" Zykov said, with characteristic cheer. Moments later, the aide found himself escorted back outside. The stream of visitors had brought even more officers to the corridor, all waiting for a chance to speak with Zykov.\n\nNone of them appeared too surprised to see one of Vlasov's own aides coming out of the office, expecting the commander to keep in touch with his own prime propagandist. Still, some looks followed him through the corridor, with Zykov's voice ringing out from behind closed doors.\n\n"Menshikov, you handsome bastard! What's the news?""
 SAM.2.a: "Does Zykov's energy know no bounds?"

 SAM.3.t: "Our General"
 SAM.3.d: "It was unusual for Bunyachenko to request private delivery of messages. Usually the Officer Committee read and responded to all of Vlasov's communiques leaving Bunyachenko not particularly involved in the day to day operations of the faction he nominally led, hence how surprising it was for him to bother reading Vlasov's communications.\n\nThe general locked the door behind the aide, before sitting back at his office. The room was austere, with no luxury other than a small furnace in one corner. The aide waited as the general read through a few of the sets of documents. One paper in particular gave the general pause. The aide recognized Vlasov's signature at the bottom. Bunyachenko read the letter a few times, before sternly looking up.\n\n"Who else knows the content of this bundle of documents, soldier?"\n\n"Only I and Vlasov, sir."\n\n"Good. You are dismissed." Bunyachenko crumpled the letter in a ball and threw it in his furnace before unlocking the door. Like that, the aide found himself back in the corridor, empty save for the faint sound of fire, consuming."
 SAM.3.a: "Special correspondence between Bunyachenko and Vlasov?"

 SAM.4.t: "Our Puppet Master"
 SAM.4.d: "Vlasov's aide was guided into Oktan's office by two stern bodyguards. Their boss sat behind an office, reading reports and documents from across the border with the Reich in between puffs of smoke. Ever genial, the General stood up to greet Vlasov's envoy with a handshake.\n\n"Can I invite you to indulge in some tobacco? Fresh arrival from our western neighbor."\n\nThe aide glanced at the box of expertly rolled cigarettes. It had been so long since he'd last had a proper smoke. The thought of owing something to Oktan, however, no matter how insignificant, gave the aide some pause. Still, good tobacco was good tobacco. "Thank you, commander."\n\nThe aide placed on Oktan's desk the package he had been tasked to bring, and then helped himself to a few cigarettes. Oktan smiled.\n\n"I've heard good things about you, soldier. If you ever find yourself looking to carry out a couple of favours, please come visit me. I've no greater concern than my men's quality of life."\n\nA tempting offer for sure. The aide nodded again to Oktan and followed the guards back outside. One of them offered him a light. The aide walked back to Vlasov's offices, savoring the rare pleasure of good tobacco. It had been months, if not years."
 SAM.4.a: "Perhaps owing Oktan is not so bad after all."

 SAM.5.t: "The Pantry"
 SAM.5.d: "The planes had come during the early morning supply run. Local peasants carrying bags of flour into the pantry disappeared in a cloud of smoke and debris. By the time the soldiers had dug them out two had already died, crushed by falling debris. The final survivor's left leg had been reduced to pulp by the building's collapse. Outside his relatives wailed as men of the ROA dragged out the unconscious body. The poor bastard was placed on a cart, his family given a few bags of food to help cushion the loss of a working age man.\n\nThe garrison's captain reviewed his troops as they continued digging out the pantry and salvaging as much of the food as possible. One recruit, a young lad from the nearby villages, looked particularly grim as he shovelled bits of concrete out into the yard.\n\n"Why the long face, soldier? It's not the first time the Germans bomb us, yes?"\n\nThe young man paused and saluted the officer stiffly. "Sir, ah, hmm."\n\n"Speak."\n\n"It's just, uh, sir, the men of the village, they said that the ROA had a deal with the Germans, uh, sir. That their bases were not bombed."\n\nThe officer laughed. "Is this what they say in whatever shithole we dragged you out of? That the Germans have an ounce of mercy? That they give a shit about their old conscript army?"\n\n"Uh, yes, sir!"\n\n"Well, there's your answer." The officer gestured toward the collapsed building where the other soldiers were pretending to work. "There's the answer for all of you. The ROA's got nothing but what we can get ourselves. Now get back to work, at this pace your dinner will mold under this pile of concrete.""
 SAM.5.a: ""Sir, yes sir!""

 SAM.6.t: "The Plight of the Common Man"
 SAM.6.d: "The young officer's speech had been short and crisp. Zykov's usual pointman in tough debates within the ROA's officer corps, Major Sergey Ivanovich, spoke to the assembled grandees of the ROA for his absent master.\n\nBetween the monotone droning, empty boasting and all-round boredom so common to the ROA's conferences, Ivanovich's style was refreshing in its earnest simplicity. "Yes." the young man agreed, it would be unfair for the ROA's commanders and soldiers to weather even more deprivation. It would be easier to take from the peasants, or to kowtow to the Germans for supplies. Every man with a gun west of Moskowien had found himself doing either of those things at some point and besides, they were already known as bootlickers and collaborators! What would they lose by forsaking the last shreds of honour and goodwill they still had?\n\nNo. The men of the Army of National Liberation should and could be better than that. Each increase in taxation bled away at the army's dwindling popular support. This situation could not go forward. As to German weapons, what of them? Military surplus that had been used to massacre the Motherland's children, given to them kindly by the twentieth century's greatest criminals. The ROA would do better.\n\nThe words of the Zykovite faction had been idealistic, yes. Naive, perhaps. But they stood out from the hopeless pragmatism of Bunyachenko's faction, and from Oktan's weary and greed-fueled cynicism. The officers voted for Ivanovich's proposed austerity, under the watchful eye of enlisted men."
 SAM.6.a: "Our current supplies will have to do."

 SAM.7.t: "No Protection Without Taxation"
 SAM.7.d: "General Bunyachenko had not risen to his current position of mouthpiece for the stratocracy clique for nothing. Today, the general's simple logic and well structured argumentation had carried the day and won a majority of the officer corps' votes. After all, "How can the people of Samara expect the proud men of the ROA to defend them and maintain peace without food and supplies?"\n\nGeneral Bunyachenko's handlers within the officer corps could be seen nodding and whispering to one another as the resolution to increase taxation had passed. Word on the street had the dominant officer clique fear losing the vote to Oktan or Zykov's factions. The current system of a strictly defined hierarchy and of equality within the same rank of officers worked well. The conservative officers feared that Oktan's small group of profiteers and smugglers or Zykov's assembly of democrats would destroy the ROA's professionalism.\n\nThe tax harvest would bring in a considerable amount of supplies, and demonstrate to the common soldier that the current system worked well. Perhaps General Vlasov would take notes when looking for a successor... or a group of successors?"
 SAM.7.a: "The officer corps knows best how to lead the ROA."

 SAM.8.t: "The German Connection"
 SAM.8.d: "After a heated debate, Oktan's proposal served as a good compromise. There would be no austerity for the troops and officers. Nor would the supplies be taken at gun points from terrified civilians. Requests would be put in through both official and unofficial channels for more German supplies. Ammunition, rifles, clothes, food, whatever the Reich deigned to give or sell to the ROA. Pragmatists in RK Moskowien had long accepted that having part of the long frontier with the Russian Anarchy be controlled by something other than bandits or Russian revanchist was worth its weight in gold.\n\nOf course, Oktan had to explain a share of questions and accusations from skeptical officers. Complaints that relying on official German shipments would undermine the ROA's reputation were defty addressed. Those inclined to hate the Army of National Liberation would continue to do so, while neutral Russian citizens could dismiss these rumors. Others accused Oktan of simply trying to score a big contraband take. To this the general smiled and patiently explained that his network of contracts would make the whole operation possible, and that every shipment could be audited by an independent commission if needed.\n\nIn the end, the objections would not sink down the idea. It was too good a way for the conservative officers and the Zykovites to save face. Even allowing Oktan a little profiteering was deemed an acceptable price."
 SAM.8.a: "Commander Oktan only has our interests at heart."

 #event for foci Dealing with dissent
 SAM.9.t: "On Discontent and Popular Support"
 SAM.9.d: "The assembled officers and soldiers fell silent as Marshal Vlasov walked to the podium. The old man still commanded, if not universal respect, then grim curiosity from the officer corps.\n\n"Friends of the National Liberation Army and of KONR. Ever since your valiant efforts have freed the land around Samara, opponents to our liberation efforts have perpetually tried to undermine our rule. Their attempts to spread discontentment has not been helped by the endless bombing campaign and the frequent economic problems imposed on the Russian people by the Anarchy."\n\n"As the time to renew our efforts to free Russia approach, this opposition cannot be tolerated. The brave men of the ROA cannot march to war as a fifth column of terrorists and communist anarchists spread chaos at home. One way or the other, respect of our administration and a healthy fear of breaking the law must be spread throughout our land. I've convened you to this meeting so that proposed solutions might be discussed and a general plan of action might be decided upon.""
 SAM.9.a: "Good luck, officers."

 #event for foci hearing the people out
 SAM.10.t: "A Second Opinion"
 SAM.10.d: "The men of the village sat somber in their church, wearing the least filthy and least bloodied - though still noticeably so - of their holiday attires. Chairs had been gathered in a rough circle, centered on the strange man from Samara. Leaning against the walls was an array of soldiers, their weapons dangling casually from rifle slings.\n\n"Friends and brothers! You've been called to this meeting to help assist the Army of Russian Liberation! It has always been our hope to bring freedom and democracy to the lands under our control. Today, we come to hear from you and your kin. What are some issues you'd like to see addressed? How we hope to improve your lives, citizens?"\n\nAn embarrassed silence. Someone raises their hand halfway, before reconsidering. Not fast enough for the indefatigable friend of the people. Zykov pointed to the man. "You, my friend, you have something on your mind?"\n\n"It's just, ah, sir, the soldiers come around for taxes, but it's never the same amount. I thought, uh, that we'd like to know in advance how much they need. S-so we can be prepared to hand it out to them, Sire." Zykov nodded at this. Encouraged, a few others brought up complaints, always respectfully to the soldiers of the room. Long dormant ruins that occupied their fields, bombing raids that left a good half of the village's people homeless, mines and half-awake bombs that detonated in the night...Little by little, a picture emerged of the myriad of problems affecting this here village out in the middle of nowhere. The ROA's chief propagandist would put this information to good use, a few patrols should see to their needs sufficiently... And hoped that the villagers would remember their benefactor in return."
 SAM.10.a: "A man of the people, Miletiy Zykov."

 SAM.11.t: "Distribution Day"
 SAM.11.d: "The ROA's men usually left their garrison in force once a month to gather whatever resources and meager crops that counted towards taxation. Other times, inhabitants of the region could be forgiven for forgetting the existence of the so-called army of liberation. There were few bandits in the area, and so the ROA's did not bother with much more than token patrols.\n\nToday, unusually, the soldiers were marching out and about. From the garrison depot on their convoy snaked through to the small hamlets, horses and men weighed down with cargo. As it turned out, the ROA's new policy of redistribution had begun.\n\nVillages in areas generally deficient in food were given rations and grain. Communities that had lost men and workers to bombing, drafting or injuries were compensated with dozens of work hours from the local garrison. In a few places, it was gleefully reported, astonished kids received candies from the quartermasters.\n\nThis calculated generosity impressed the weary villagers in its cynicism. With the new hand-outs, life would be tolerable, instead of a grinding wait before certain starvation. In the meantime however, men and women would hopefully be too busy eating to listen to anti-ROA agitators."
 SAM.11.a: "We're already beating their low expectations!"

 #event for foci the hard way
 SAM.12.t: "The Daily Triage"
 SAM.12.d: "Political prisoners were tossed in daily, captured from throughout Samara by Oktan's crackdown. In overcrowded common cells, men wallowed in filth and anger as they waited for the daily triage.\n\nEven dissidents plotting against the ROA were of use to Oktan's faction. Each prisoner would go through a battery of psychological tests and brutal examinations, before being sorted into one of three groups. Those judged too dangerous or that would never comply to orders were executed. The next group was filled with men who despised the ROA but who were too docile to stir up trouble by themselves. These men were escorted to various work camps, where their labor would help maintain the state that kept their families safe. Of course, the laborers would be paid and fed. Good behavior might even see some of this hard earned money trickle back to their families.\n\nFinally, there were those that would do anything to earn their freedom. Joining communist or bandit groups had been for them a tremendous lapse of judgement. These men paid a punitive fine to the ROA, and were allowed to walk free. Their path out of the prison took them in front of the holding cells, where angry men of their hometown could see who had bent the knee. Back home, the freed prisoners would only find work and safety through continued submission to the ROA.\n\nPolitical prisoners were tossed in daily, but at an ever slowing pace. The crackdown had been swift and merciless. Peace would return to Samara, its communities more silent than ever as working age men were taken away for triage."
 SAM.12.a: "They shall not trouble us again."

 SAM.13.t: "In the Halls of Power"
 SAM.13.d: "It had been a welcome relief to leave the frontiers for an extended trip to Samara. Balashov was used to permissions being granted in muddy shitholes with terrible alcohol and even worse brothels.\n\nHis presence in Samara, however, would not be for R&R. With rumbles of a new set of wars in Western Russia, almost every officer that could make the trip had been invited to give their say in a final leadership conference. The Officer Committee claimed every officer's opinion would be taken into account. The Officer Committee claimed a lot of things.\n\nThe most pressing topic was on everybody's lips: Who would succeed Vlasov as Chairman? Balashov really did not care. He suspected few others did. Far from the little games played in Samara, the vast majority of the ROA spent most of its time patrolling, training, and keeping an eye out on the locals. None of them knew what the future would bring. Making such plans was the hobby of Samara's elite clique.\n\nBalashov had been twenty two when the Germans drafted him. Twenty five when they had forced him at gunpoint to leave his fiancee and fight the communists. He was now thirty five, he had no idea what had become of his fiancee, his children. He had long since given up on returning home. Perhaps the candidates to succeed Vlasov might convince him to keep hope again."
 SAM.13.a: "Most likely not."

 SAM.14.t: "A Kindred Spirit"
 SAM.14.d: "In theory, the day's topic was merely about the best way to administer newly liberated areas. A young captain had made a passionate speech about collaboration and partnership with the local civilians. The next officer to speak was Commander Bunyachenko, the usual mouthpiece of the upper echelon of the Officer Committee. Balashov was less interested in Bunyachenko's speech than in the man himself. After all the general's arguments were the usual rhetoric about the dangers of giving too much power to the masses; it was a fine refutation delivered with the general's hint of a Ukrainian accent. No, Balashov was more interested in the Officer Committee's mouthpiece than in his message.\n\nBunyachenko's grim expression reminded Balashov of his and his men's. An unhappy determination, a decade of sorrows and losses. The only time the general's eyes lit up was when he mentioned the hated communists and Germans that had stolen their future. Commander Bunyachenko was a hard man and one whom Balashov would gladly follow in battle. The only mystery left unresolved in Balashov's mind was about Bunyachenko's dreams. Would such a man remain the Officer Committee's puppet like Vlasov had become? Or would he use his status as Chairman to be something more?"
 SAM.14.a: "Perhaps there's still some life in him."

 SAM.15.t: "Chasing the Setting Sun"
 SAM.15.d: "The day's conferences had ended. Balashov and a few other officers from his district had settled on a local bar to get refreshments after a day of talking. Like most of the city of Samara for the congress, the establishment was filled to the brim with men of the ROA.\n\nIn one corner Balashov recognized one of the Zykovite democracy proponents that had given an impassioned speech. The speaker waved Balashov and his friends over, offering them seats next to his own group of officers. Without much thought Balashov headed toward the chair, signalling to the barman for a drink. Why not spend the evening with the Zykovites.\n\nIn person, the pro-democracy speaker was much more personable than Balashov had expected. A colonel from the border region with the Orenburg communes, the man was an old hand of the West Russian War. Conversations drifted from topic to topic. Memories of the desperate struggle against the WRRF. The famous operation to secure the south eastern territories from bandits in the aftermath of the Front's collapse. If the Colonel's assignment was in the quiet south east sector, it was because he had helped make it quiet.\n\n"So, what's an old hand like you doing with Zykov and his jumped up peasants turned junior officer? Don't you have better things to do than help that fool?" One of Balashov's comrades asked, his tongue loosened by drink. The colonel's drinking friends flashed grimaces, but the colonel himself shrugged. "When we crushed the bandits, the locals in the south east were grateful. After decades of pointless struggle in the Red Army, then the ROA, it felt nice, you know? Fighting for something. Zykov's a strange man, but he's one with a plan. Like me, he dreams of going west. Freeing Moskowien. I don't know if my home town will ever welcome me back, but if I can get buried next to my ancestors, that's one thing the Germans won't have taken from me." The colonel finished his drink."
 SAM.15.a: "Perhaps the ROA too will set in the west."

 SAM.16.t: "The Other Road"
 SAM.16.d: "Balashov hitched a ride on a troop truck back home with fellow officers. A few discussed the leadership conference. Most of the others discussed their most recent acquisition from the capital. Booze, tobacco, a few odds and ends. One of the lieutenants showed off his new toy, a sleek Walter PPK pistol to replace the aging P38 pistol he had been given upon recruitment into the ROA.\n\nMany of the men in the truck had a significantly better haul than their meagre salary should have allowed. Balashov thought of the friendly officers in the capitals, associates of Commander Oktan. The trade with Moskowien was an entire organization all of its own, and its members were some of the richest and most generous of the ROA.\n\nAt the leadership conference they too had argued for their boss as successor to Vlasov. They railed against Zykov's foolish idealism, and against Bunyachenko's lethargic puppeteers in the Officer Committee. The ROA was strong. Should it not have a strong leader? One able to provide for the soldiers and officers? One able to enforce discipline, order and progress throughout Russia? At least, so Oktan's proxies had talked during the conference. They had talked and they had given out much goodies. It paid to be friendly with men that held so many... contacts. Balashov had not taken anything from these men yet. But the option remained on his mind..."
 SAM.16.a: "They can ease the pain."

 SAM.17.t: "Vlasov's Secret Speech"
 SAM.17.d: "Today, Andrey Vlasov has reluctantly made what will in time be known as "Vlasov's Secret Speech" to his most senior and long-standing officers of the ROA, announcing his successor. It's been a well-known, if unspoken, fact that the aging Chairman has not been in good temperament recently, and many have long expected this day to come.\n\nOne of Vlasov's aides attended him as he prepared his final speech, announcing the Chairman's successor within the hour. He was expected by the Officer Committee fifteen minutes ago for a standard meeting before the announcement, but he hadn't bothered attending. The aide, one of the few allowed into the Chairman's room, silently observed the old marshal. His brow was furrowed, and despite the rather chilly temperatures of the office, it seemed that his face glistened with sweat. He was intensely staring at the script, scribbled by hand onto a piece of paper - not reading it or editing it, just staring. The aide checked his watch. "Sir, I-" he tried to hurry the marshal along, well-familiar with the punishment he may receive for Vlasov being late of his own accord. Vlasov however put up a hand as soon as the aide spoke, silently terminating the aide's hope to get things moving. The marshal stood up, slowly, and delicately folded the piece of paper up into his pocket. "Shall we?" he asked the aide. "Yes, sir," the aide responded.\n\nThe old marshal stood in front of his officers, some of them having been with him since the earliest days of the ROA. He looked at all of them - seeing familiar faces, but, for the first time, more than a few faces that he didn't recognize. Could they be new? Vlasov asked himself, the silence in the room deadening as all looked to him and waited. Or had he simply forgotten who they were? Sighing, Vlasov looked down at his paper, and spoke at last:\n\n"As you all know, I am not getting any younger. It has come time for me to announce a formal successor to the Russian Liberation Army's Chairman position. And for this, I have chosen...""
 SAM.17.a: ""Zykov, for his skills.""
 SAM.17.b: ""Bunyachenko, for the officers.""
 SAM.17.c: ""Oktan, for his money.""

 SAM.18.t: "Coercing Bunyachenko"
 SAM.18.d: "Miletiy Zykov and a number of his more prominent allies sat in one of the many formal conference rooms common to the governmental buildings that dotted Samara. Now that he had begun to grab a hold on the reins of power, he knew that he had to address one of the two elephants in the crowded metaphorical room - Sergey Bunyachenko. The mouthpiece for the officers. Bunyachenko had been one of Vlasov's competing successors, meaning that he held enough clout and influence to pose a real threat to Zykov's plans, if he so wished. They had scheduled an impromptu meeting with the general, and he was running late.\n\nThe doors creaked open as Bunyachenko ungracefully stepped through. His uniform was dishevelled and his eyes were bloodshot. It looked as if he had been drinking, at the very least just last night, if not into this morning as well. "Good morning, I apologize for my tardiness", Bunyachenko started. "I had lost track of time while I-"\n\nZykov interrupted. "It doesn't matter! We've called you here because we want to discuss your future with the Russian Liberation Army." Bunyachenko's eyes widened. "Don't worry, we're not having you shot." One of the officers chimed in.\n\nZykov glanced at his peer dismissively, before turning to Bunyachenko once more. "No, I suppose we aren't. You represent something that is of value to me, Sergey." Zykov asserted. "You have the ear of the people we need to hear, and who need to be heard by us. The way I see it... we'll keep you around, with a generous salary, and not only will you remain at the head of our armed forces, but you will also report directly to us about any goings on in the army that would need to be reported on. Does that make sense?" A short, curt nod from the general followed, and he was dismissed."
 SAM.18.a: "The velvet glove."

 SAM.19.t: "The Issue of Mikhail Oktan"
 SAM.19.d: ""We all know who he is," Zykov began. "And we all know who's in his pocket."\n\nIt was true. Now that Zykov had assumed control of the Russian Liberation Army, he had real reason to suspect that Mikhail Oktan, a well-known corrupt officer and a reveller in the less-than-savory operations undertaken by some of our soldiers, was one of the driving forces behind the instability following Zykov's ascent to power. "But right now, acting against him would be disastrous. The web he's spun himself is far too wide; he controls too much." Zykov concluded, edging out any of his more hawkish supporters in their over-enthusiasm to deal with the individual.\n\n"But that's not to say, of course, that we should merrily leave him to prepare a coup. He operates on a system that centers around his ability to buy his supporters, which means that for a certain price, almost all of them can be bought back. I'd like to have a list drawn up of names that we can convince to come over to us... and a list of those who likely won't be bought, so that we can begin planning arrests of key figures. We may not be able to take him out, yet, but we can whittle him down. Does all of that make sense?"\n\nAides had been busily writing down the Chairman's orders, but all nodded in unison as the Chairman looked for their understanding. Dismissing themselves, they quickly went to work narrowing down Oktan's supporters and crossing out their lists, name by name."
 SAM.19.a: "The iron fist."

 SAM.20.t: "We Propose to Go Faster"
 SAM.20.d: "Zykov had been a busy man.\n\nVlasov was a man of immense power, that was undeniable. But the problem was that he had a distinct lack of will to utilize that power: always concerned about maintaining the coalition above else, even at the expense of Samara and the people of Russia as a whole. Now, though, Zykov was the one in charge, at least for now. And he had more than utilized it.\n\nVlasov had many friends, and his enemies had many divisions. It was child's play, bouncing them back and forth using the bureaucracy, benefiting one at the expense of the other. And all the while, Zykov was promoting allies to the levers of power, the keys to a better future, both in the Committee and in government. Nothing big -- a secretary position here, a subdepartment headship here, all an intricately connected web of connections and friends that, when the time came, would remember who helped them and their families.\n\nAnd then there was the people, the broken, shattered remnants of a once great country. They hated the Committee, and rightly so. They were, after all, a bunch of German bootlickers - for now, at least. But they would learn, in time, to rely on them. The bare bones of a welfare state, with regular drops of food and protection and a general upgrade in a standard of living would keep them satisfied, especially after experiencing almost twenty years of deprivation.\n\nBut this was just the setting of the stage. The actors would be brought together, the props created. All that remind was the script, with Zykov as the writer.\n\nAnd Zykov wanted to go faster."
 SAM.20.a: "There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."

 SAM.21.t: "A Chat with the Chief Democrat" #event for work with zykov
 SAM.21.d: "One of his aides announced that Miletiy Zykov had arrived. Commander Bunyachenko remained at his desk as the former journalist was shown in. Both men shook hands.\n\n"Deputy-Chairman. You've summoned me?" Asked Zykov, sitting down. "That I have. I found myself reflecting on your successful campaign to become Deputy-Chairman. Chairman Vlasov has always spoken well of your ability to inspire and spread a message. These aptitudes will be needed in the coming wars of unification." Zykov frowned slightly, and spoke. "I'm afraid, Deputy-Chairman, that I will be unable to give my full support to the Officer Committee and to your program. After all, the democratic ideals I fight for were rejected at the convention. What w-" Bunyachenko cut him off. "Forget idealism. Take a look around, what do you see? Tired men in the Officer Committee, unwilling to recognize that half of their staff has been bribed by Oktan. Enemies all around us, plotting to hang us as traitors. Chairman Vlasov, too tired to intervene directly. I know you're not a fool, despite your reputation. I need your help to stave off chaos. There won't be a Russia to spread democracy to if the communists are sitting here next year."\n\nZykov thought for a moment. His eternally confident demeanor did irritate Bunyachenko slightly. Difficult to read what went on behind the man's cheerful mask. Finally Zykov offered his hand for Bunyachenko to shake. "I'll offer what I can. As we both know, I have my own interests, but I think these work out beautifully with yours, Deputy-Chairman." Bunyachenko shook the hand of his new chief propagandist. Hopefully the association would be a profitable one."
 SAM.21.a: "A new pen to back the sword."

 SAM.22.t: "A Matter of Perspective" #SAM_Celebrate_Vlasov
 SAM.22.d: "Bunyachenko hated having to deal with the pesky reality of reputation - or, as Zykov described it, 'public relations', which somehow made Bunyachenko squirm a little bit, if only because it sounded so American. But even if he hated it, he still had to deal with it, one way or another. And who was better to clean up Marshal Vlasov's image as a German bootlicker than Zykov, the chief 'PR' man himself?\n\nIt was a test run at first, to see how far they could get with a little bit of glorification. Posters of Vlasov shown side by side with his men, inspecting them and generally being an attractive leader of the people. Then it expanded to constant radio bombardments of the 'real' history of Vlasov's supposed 'betrayal' - which was, according to those announcements, was in reality a last ditch effort to protect the Russian people. Then, when that was done, the minor financiation of a couple of cheap plays, depicting the Great Patriotic War, with Vlasov as the tragic hero of the war that broke Russia into a thousand pieces.\n\nThen, as the people began to think that, perhaps, just maybe, they had been wrong, it was time to bring out the tears: show the faces of the men whose families were in concentration camps, their broken, shattered faces being reminded of the horrible fate that awaited them at the death camps. Then make them stare at the camera or, in the most effective cases, have them say, with no hint of sarcasm or dislike, 'Vlasov was only trying to do what was best for me and my family.'\n\nIt was a good show, Bunyachenko admitted, especially considering how Zykov found an actor that could emote so well. A little saccharine, but Zykov knew how to play a crowd. Maybe by the end of the year, Vlasov would be as well loved as he was hated the year before."
 SAM.22.a: "If you don't tell a story, someone else will."

 SAM.23.t: "Breaking the Bank" #SAM_Demote_Maltsev
 SAM.23.d: "Bunyachenko sat at his desk, thinking about his family when Oktan walked into his office. Ah, he thought, he had finally arrived.\n\n"I was asked to meet with you, General Bunyachenko. What seems to be the issue?" asked Oktan, his face betraying absolutely nothing.\n\n"Ah, well, General Oktan, there is an issue I am hoping to deal with, privately. You must understand."\n\nOktan's eyebrow rose slightly, but other than that Bunyachenko couldn't see anything behind that little mask he wore. "Of course, General. Permission to sit?"\n\n"Please."\n\nAs Oktan sat down, they were face to face, only a feet or so from each other. "General Oktan, there have been reports among many in the citizenry that many of your troops have been involved in smuggling and racketeering. I was wondering if you were dealing with this issue."\n\nOktan smiled a little. "Ah, of course, General, I am dealing with it to the best of my abilities."\n\n"That is good, because we found something truly strange in one of these reports."\n\n"What sort of strange, General?"\n\n"Well, apparently, one of our MPs found at a local bar one of your squadrons, drunk. One of them began talking about a 'Swiss' who is involved in the local gun smuggling trade. With a little perusation, our MP was able to locate this Swiss, who was being guarded by some of your men. When asked, your men stated that it was 'official state business under the orders of General Oktan.' Strange, isn't it?"\n\nOktan's mask was cracking. "Then, when this MP infiltrated the facility, they found this." Bunyachenko opened a drawer, and brought out dozens of photos of men transporting German goods: watches, wine, tobacco, clothing, even technology.\n\n"It would be a shame, if one of our own generals was found complicit in such activities as the expense of the people."\n\nOktan's face had gone white.\n\n"Perhaps, a deal can be made," Bunyachenko said, pulling a piece of paper out, written in big bold letters at the top: VOLUNTARY DEMOTION. "I only require your signature.""
 SAM.23.a: "Signed, Mikhail Oktan."

 SAM.24.t: "Sideline Our Rivals" #SAM_Sideline_Our_Rivals
 SAM.24.d: "How long had it been? Good cognac like this? Starikov had no clue. But important occasions deserved important celebrations. The officer saw Deputy-Chairman Oktan leaning over with a pair of new cigarettes. Starikov took one of them.\n\n"Isn't it careless, tough," Starikov lit up his new cigarette. "Not striking against Zykov and Commander Bunyachenko?"Oktan smiled, a cloud of smoke drifting through his crooked grin. "Eager to strike so soon against your old boss? Eh, Starikov?" Oktan took a sip of cognac. "They still have their uses, discredited as they are. And they still command significant influence." Another sip. "Far better to keep discrediting them, make use of their power until we've eroded it completely." The grid widend. "Then, we can crush them."\n\n"Whatever you say boss. So this first assignment. An... acquaintance of ours will give me a package." A nod from Oktan. "I'm to leak its content to the proper channels." Another nod. "Are you sure this will not get back to Commander Bunyachenko?" Oktan' smile deepened further still. "I'm certain of it.""
 SAM.24.a: ""Alright, get to it Starikov.""

 SAM.25.t: "Silent Halls" #SAM_Turn_Their_Supporters
 SAM.25.d: "Despite the selection of Oktan as Deputy-Chairman, and the ensuing morale blow to his own faction of democrats, Miletiy Zykov worked harder than ever. Of course, part of this workload was caused by his ever dwindling staff.\n\nIt felt as if every other day began with a resignation, or its silent equivalent of the staffer simply not appearing for work. Those who had appeared in front of him to hand in their resignation had been gently questioned. Most insisted they were simply retiring from politics. One or two of the honest ones explained that Deputy-Chairman Oktan had offered a better deal. Land, money, positions of importance, it seemed that the good Deputy-Chairman never ran out of agreeable rewards for those who befriended him, thought Zykov.\n\nAll this was not good, but it was not extremely bad for the moment. In a way, it was a good thing to see those not entirely dedicated to the cause just up and leave. The remaining core of Zykov's organization would be more motivated than ever to see justice and democracy be restored to Russia. Oktan's constant war on the democratic faction (as well as on the Officer Committee, Zykov suspected) would not go unacknowledged however. The former journalist sighed, and picked up the phone. It was time to organize a few meetings of his own. Some of the democratic faction's best assets, after all, did not operate in the light, either."
 SAM.25.a: "Gotta fight poison with poison."

 SAM.26.t: "A Meeting with the Deputy-Chairman" #SAM_Use_My_Foes
 SAM.26.d: "Commander Bunyachenko's usual dour expression did not seem to account the luxurious location in which he now sat. A few tasteful paintings hung on the walls of Oktan's office. Deputy-Chairman Oktan returned from the wood and crystal cabinet, holding a bottle of Georgian cognac and two glasses. The dour military officer did not offer any thanks upon being served a glass. He did, to his host's surprise, offer a toast. "To Russia." "To Russia!" replied Oktan.\n\nBoth men were barely seated when Commander Bunyachenko leaned forward. "Why did you invite me, Deputy-Chairman?" "For a dr-" "Don't even finish that sentence, please." Bunyachenko cut off Oktan. "You are in a position of strength. My organization is not. Have you invited me here to gloat?" Oktan scoffed at the question. "How rude such a thing would be. And besides, why do you speak of your organization, Commander Bunyachenko? The Officer Committee uses you as a mouthpiece, yes? Because you've been here-to entirely unconcerned with political games of your own."\n\nBunyachenko took a sip of cognac. His expression was still neutral. "Hereto, Deputy-Chairman?" He finally asked. Oktan laughed pleasantly. "It is no secret that of late you've been dissatisfied with your patrons, and their inability to stand up to me. Why not ditch them? I've use of men who will fight for Russia." The stern officer swirled the cognac around his glass. He finally replied, "What of Zykov's faction?" Oktan laughed again. "They've received a similar offer. I've a need for people who want to fight, commander. The Front, and those idiots in Vyatka, they're tough opposition. We need to come together if we're to win Western Russia."\n\nOktan thought he saw the hint of a retort in the other man's eyes. Yet Bunyachenko kept quiet. Emptied his glass. Stood. Finally, he spoke. "My loyalty is to the ROA, its Chairman, and its Deputy-Chairman. Thank you for the drink, Commander Oktan." He saluted, before leaving the office, without waiting for Oktan's reply."
 SAM.26.a: "The Deputy-Chairman smiled."

 SAM.27.t: "A Mission to Vologda?" #SAM_Can_We_Find_Common_Ground
 SAM.27.d: "As we prepare to expand the Liberation Army's area of influence, a proposal has been made by a number of officers and other functionaries. A proposal of diplomacy.\n\nAccording to them, before taking any hostile action against the Neutral State or the government in Vologda, we should first extend an offer of peaceful re-integration. Of effective surrender, from them to us. Though some officers dismissed the idea immediately, others have spoken of its inherent merits.\n\nSending such an offer would show, not only to other states but also to all the peoples of Russia, that we at least attempted peaceful actions before resorting to forcible ones. A perception that could be of significant assistance in the future. In addition, any such offer would also implicitly make a threat of subsequent invasion clear.\n\nHowever, it has been brought to our attention that such a course possesses significant inherent risk. Should the Neutral State prove resistant to our 'offer,' they would be made aware of a likely imminent invasion, and be given the opportunity to prepare defenses and other plans of their own.\n\nThere are merits and flaws to either course of action, but a decision must be made. What should be done?"
 SAM.27.a: "Let us attempt diplomacy. Send the 'offer.'"

 SAM.28.t: "An 'Offer' from the Russian Liberation Army"
 SAM.28.d: "We have today received an 'offer' from the government of the so-called 'Russian Liberation Army' based in Samara.\n\nAccording to their envoy, the Army is offering us the chance to peacefully re-integrate our lands with theirs as they continue their efforts towards regional unification. In essence, they are asking for our surrender, and threatening hostile action should we decline.\n\nMembers of our government are split. On one hand, several argue that the Neutral State does not possess the strength to resist such an invasion, and that agreeing to the proposal could not only save lives, but also perhaps allow us to secure certain protections or concessions in response. Despite reservations at extending trust to the collaborators, they argue it is the only reasonable option.\n\nOthers, however, disagree vehemently, calling it madness to trust such criminals, and that the only thing this 'offer' gives us is the opportunity to prepare for an invasion we now know is coming. That we now know is inevitable. This knowledge, they claim, could be enough to turn the tides in our favor in any conflict.\n\nRegardless, however, a response must be given. What should it be?"
 SAM.28.a: "Accept the offer. We do not have the strength to resist."
 SAM.28.b: "Absolutely not. We will stand on our own!"

 SAM.29.t: "Vologda Agrees to Annexation!"
 SAM.29.d: "Our decision to reach out to the government in Vologda about peaceful reintegration was a wise one. Because they have agreed.\n\nAlready, a large delegation of their civilian and military officials have been dispatched to Samara, in order to coordinate the subsumption of their political structure into our own. And our officials will work very closely with them to ensure that the procedure, in its entirety, goes smoothly.\n\nIf, and when, it does, it will serve as an example to the other statelets of Western Russia that the Russian Liberation Army exists to do just that, in as peaceful and cooperative a manner as possible. It will prove that our word, long denigrated - and not without cause - as that of German collaborators, can be trusted. It will show that we have the moral capability to lead.\n\nBeyond that, however, it also offers us a large expansion of territory, many new resources, a large population pool to leverage for conscripts, and a better strategic position within our region, all properties that we intend to exploit to the fullest. The decision was a gambit, yes, and was much criticized among parts of the Army's officer corps, but it has paid off.\n\nWhile we cannot count on further bloodless victories in the times ahead, we can at least take pride in this one, and in the conservation of military strength that it promises."
 SAM.29.a: "Excellent."

 SAM.30.t: "Vologda Refuses Annexation!"
 SAM.30.d: "Unfortunately, the government in Vologda has refused our generous offer of peaceful reintegration. Their lands will now have to be 'acquired' through other, and more violent, means.\n\nAlready, orders have been dispatched to the army to begin preparing plans and timetables for potential military action against the Neutral State, and given the significant disparity in military capability between them and ourselves, it is not expected that any such preparations will take long. But that is not the primary concern.\n\nTheir refusal has denied us the opportunity to prove that we are more than what we are seen to me. That we are no longer simply German collaborators. That we can give our word, that we can promise equitable and peaceful reunification, if permitted, and then follow through. And now we must, yet again, use force, and accept the repercussions of its use.\n\nSo be it. We will secure the lands of the Neutral State by military force, and incorporate its resources, its people, and its strategic position into our own, improving our ability to pursue further campaigns of regional unification.\n\nWe can only hope that this failure does not portend similar diplomatic failures in the future. If it does, our plans of expansion could be made much more difficult, indeed."
 SAM.30.a: "Disappointing. They leave us no choice."

Why, in God's name, have I been let go?"\n\nThe little bureaucrat looked down at his paper patiently, making Alexi want to punch the little bastard in the face even harder. It was already taking everything inside of him to avoid doing that, in spite of how good it would have felt.\n\n"You," began the bureaucrat, "have been dismissed for incompetence."\n\n"Incompetence? What the hell is that supposed to mean? I've been good enough for the Committee for eight years prior, so why now?"\n\n"Your specific treatment of certain...problematic people, has made things complicated."\n\n"Ah, I understand now, I understand perfectly."\n\nThe bureaucrat's eyes blinked without emotion, his old face sagging down ever so slightly.\n\n"I let those two commie hooligans go, that's it? Tell those Committee bastards that in spite of what the papers said, they were kids: thirteen, fourteen. I wasn't gonna throw two lives away because of some dumb shit they did when they were young."\n\n"I will make sure to tell my superiors that. Good day, Mr. Bolshakov." And with that, the bureaucrat left the front steps of Alexi's home. He slammed the door shut, and, leaning against it, fell to the floor.\n\nHe hadn't been the first. It had been happening all through Samara. People dismissed without warning, histories being 'discovered' that placed them in an 'unprofessional light.' At first it had been the small guys: secretaries, postman, etc. Then they had gone after department heads, city officials, even the Mayor, for God's sake, all because of some unspecified 'incompetence' or 'unreliability.' Everyone knew what it was, but no one was gonna talk about it for fear of making things even worse.\n\nAlexi sighed. Might as well try to find some new job in town now."

 SAM.32.d: "The mood at the camp was subdued and quiet, gone was the joking and the teasing, replaced with grim determination and mounting anxiety. All knew what was to be required of them, and none looked forward to it. Worried soldiers checked and rechecked their weapons while mechanics and crewmen repeatedly looked over their vehicles. Logistics officers stockpiled supplies and worried about rates of expenditure, while officers wondered just how many men they'd send to an early grave.\n\nIt was a scene repeated across dozens of other camps and bases, as the men of the Russian Liberation Army prepared to go on the warpath once more. Vologda had refused to submit, and so the Neutral State would be crushed. It had to be, for the good of all of Russia."
 SAM.32.a: "Unfortunate, but necessary."

 SAM.33.t: "The People's Hope"
 SAM.33.d: "Milety Zykov stood in his new office in Samara. Just hours ago he had been proclaimed the Deputy-Chairman of the Russian Liberation Army, a position he had not expected to be elevated to. He and much of the ROA had expected a more military-minded choice. The people of Samara had mixed feelings. The idea of a civilian in charge of the region was certainly appealing to them, but he knew they still resented every member of the ROA. Indeed, he understood that more than most.\n\nWith luck and no small amount of prodding, hopefully, they would grow to accept the KONR as their best hope for a unified Russia. Zykov sat at his desk and began making calls. Vlasov had given him wide latitude to act on his own, with all the authority of the Chairman himself. Despite his official confirmation as Deputy-Chairman, he knew his position was insecure. The officers under the sway of the bastard Oktan would have to be either bribed or arrested, as their master would undoubtedly be preparing moves of his own. The man was a snake in the grass at the best of times and would have to be dealt with sooner or later.\n\nMore importantly, Bunyachenko's clique needed to be brought onto his side. They represented the largest part of the ROA and would be the key to neutering Oktan's support among the enlisted. Even simply securing Sergey's support would go far in stabilizing his support amongst the ROA, as they were none too pleased by the appointment of a civilian propagandist.\n\nThe most important part of Zykov's plans, however, lay with the people who lived under the KONR's rule. They would be the most important to win over by far. Without the support of the people, he would be nothing more than another petty dictator fighting over the scraps left by the Soviet Union in its death throes. In the long term, he envisioned a true democracy for all the people of Russia, one that would forever bury the legacy of Tsars and Communists in Russia.\n\nBut such thoughts were for the future. In the here and now he had to juggle the influence of snakes and soldiers, all in hope for a future he could be proud of."
 SAM.33.a: "Best of luck, Deputy-Chairman."

 SAM.34.t: "A Plan for Strength"
 SAM.34.d: "Sergey Bunyachenko paced back and forth within his office. His promotion to Deputy-Chairman of the Committee came as no great surprise, he had been pegged as Vlasov's most likely successor long ago. His fellow ROA officers had been lobbying on his behalf for years and now that he had ascended to his new position he would take full advantage of his new powers. The ROA was in dire need of restructuring. Mikhail Oktan and his clique were a threat to Bunyachenko's new position and to the Committee as a whole. The man would need to be demoted. As much as Sergey would rather kill the bastard, he was simply too influential at the moment. If he did not take care then he could easily find himself dead in the night, with Oktan all too willing to take power.\n\nThere was another thorn in his side as well. Milety Zykov was something of a decent man, though a little spineless for his tastes. It could only be beneficial to bring him towards Sergey's way of thinking. With Zykov's support, he would have an in with the people. The people of Samara, and of all of Russia itself, would need convincing that the ROA was capable of creating a strong Russia, free of the problems that plagued the Tsarist and Communist regimes. Zykov was just the man for the job, he was a master of propaganda and could surely curtail any thoughts of revolt amongst the masses.\n\nHis pacing came to an end and he took a seat at his desk. With a resolve rarely seen in the Russian anarchy, he began to write orders that would go out across KONR territory. The people needed work, the ROA needed guns, and the Chairman needed to know that he would be up to the task of forging a Russia that would have the strength to overcome its enemies and rise to the levels of the great powers."

Such weather might have been more fitting as a coda to a life of exile, leading to war and then a troubled reign in the Russian Anarchy. But the former tsar did not begrudge the weather. It felt good to walk on a sunny day for a final time.\n\nHis thoughts went to other kings, dethroned and killed like common criminals. His would be the fate of Maximilian of Mexico, given at least the honor of a soldier's death against the wall. Better than Louis and Charles, decapitated like common criminals. Far better than his second cousin's death in a stuffy, dark basement lit only by the flash of drunk communist gunmen.\n\nThe sun shone on Samara, but not the warm, pleasant sun of France where he had lived after the revolution. He had never known what to think of the vast skies of Russia he had longed for while in exile. His opinion still eluded him as the soldier brought him to the wall. All around the plaza, scores of citizens of the so called freed Russia looked at him, their emotions as hard to read as Vladimir's own.\n\nGunmen in front of him. Hard to swallow. Vladimir tried to blink away the fear. Thoughts of Leonida, of Maria. Perhaps they had made it to exile. Too late to worry. A wave of flashes, then nothing."
 SAM.35.a: "So sets the sun on the Romanovs."

 SAM.36.t: "The Long Dawn"
 SAM.36.d: "Zykov was the first to hear of the old man's passing. A quiet and peaceful end in the night, the doctor said. Better than he deserved, according to many, but Zykov wouldn't hear of that. Today would be a day for mourning, for whatever the Chairman's faults, he was still the liberator of Western Russia. Regardless of whether the people would accept the truth, Miletiy Zykov would have it spoken.\n\nWhen the time came to bury Vlasov, it came on a cold, rainy day. First, there was the procession through Samara, with a guard of honor flanking the general's hearse. Thousands lined the streets, as was their duty, but stayed no longer than expected. Second came the service, after Zykov, Bunyachenko, Oktan and Meandrov bore the coffin up the steps of the rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Savior. All spoke in turn: Meandrov of his victories, Oktan of his strength, Bunyachenko of his dedication. Last was Zykov, who spoke of the general's dream. For a brief few minutes, the officers and civilians packing the pews forgot their treasonous origins, thinking only of the brilliant tapestry woven by the mysterious man from Ukraine.\n\nThe flag of the ROA flew at half-mast from Samara to Arkhangelsk, the blue cross reminding all beneath it of who had given them a second chance at sovereignty. Though they were few, there were those who saluted of their own accord, doffing their hats in a moment of silence for the passing of a humble giant.\n\nMost of Russia would never forgive Andrey Vlasov for his actions. But Zykov, as he sat the general's old office and raised a solitary toast to the old general, expressed his thanks - for standing by his people to the end."
 SAM.36.a: "The night is darkest before the dawn."

 SAM.37.t: "A Plan for Power"
 SAM.37.d: "Deep within the shadows of his office, Mikhail Oktan smiled. Years of work had finally paid off. Years of gaining the trust of the doddering fool Vlasov, of buttering up his fellow officers until they all danced to his tune. Still, he had to concede that his hold on the ROA was not absolute. Bunyachenko held much respect among them, his actions in the West Russian War had managed to cement his place as the leader of the ROA in truth, if not rank. Then there was Zykov, the spineless worm. He held sway over the people of Samara, his ideas of democracy and freedom for the people were poison in their minds. Such ideas had no place in the Russia he would rule, such as it was.\n\nWhile Vlasov still drew breath, he would need to tread carefully. While he was foolish enough to trust him with the Deputy-Chairmanship, he was still much too popular amongst the ROA's ranks for Oktan to push forward all of his plans. For now, he would need to be patient. Just as he had throughout the Great Patriotic War, the West Russian War, and the chaotic years that followed.\n\nHowever, that did not mean he could not act against his rivals. Vlasov had given him wide latitude for change within Samara and he intended to mold the ROA into a more preferable form. Now, he had a choice. He could risk the repercussions and move against Bunyachenko and Zykov immediately. It would come with risks but, at the same time, it could remove the biggest obstacles to his power right away. On the other hand, he could work with them for the time being. It would allow him the use of their resources and influence, but it would also allow them to plot against him unimpeded."
 SAM.37.a: "They have to be dealt with, here and now!"
 SAM.37.b: "Their time will come, once I have no use for them."

 SAM.38.t: "Rise of the Iron President"
 SAM.38.d: "The old man's iron will had given out not too long after the Western Russian unification. Aides had found Chairman Vlasov in his room after he had failed to wake up one morning. Three days of mourning had been declared across newly liberated lands. A few genuinely upset citizens had thronged the general's coffin. Vlasov had been admired by a few across Russia. His relentless drive to free Russia from the communist menace had been admired by many. In the dark days of the West Russian War, areas liberated by the Chairman's men had been spared the brutal retribution killing of the Wehrmacht. During the dark decade that followed, he had done as much as possible to shield the people of Samara from his former German backers.\n\nBut the mourners were far outnumbered by a mass of stone-faced civilians. Whether secretly angry or entirely apathetic, General Bunyachenko could not tell. He knew that an overwhelming majority of citizens thought Vlasov the lowest of lowest in all of Russian history. A pathetic dog of the German occupier, that had led Russian troops in a fratricidal war to crush the resurgent Red army. Soldiers with live ammunition had covered the funeral procession, lest rioters try to smash the old Chairman's coffin.\n\nReading a hastily prepared speech, Bunyachenko felt out of his element, standing as he did in front of the sea of blank faces. He had always wondered why the detested Vlasov had lived day after day in hope of redemption. Now the wave of cold contempt threatened to drown KONR's new leader. Russia stood on the brink of unification for the first time in decades. A fact one could hardly imagine from the assembled citizen, too tired even for despair at the take-over of their land by former German collaborators.\n\nBunyachenko mumbled the last few words of the funerary oration. His officer colleagues led the applause. With one last look at Vlasov, the new leader of liberated Western Russia marched off the podium. His wish to be alone for the rest of the day would go unfulfilled."
 SAM.38.a: "Perhaps Vlasov will be missed."

 SAM.39.t: "Enthusiastic Iconoclasm"
 SAM.39.d: "Many years prior, the soldiers of the Russian Liberation Army had marched, and fought, alongside those who proudly flew the now universally-known symbols of National Socialism. Today, however, they were destroying those symbols. With great enthusiasm.\n\nEven to the often morally-questionable membership of the ROA - though that was improving under the leadership of Miletiy Zykov - the 'Aryan Brotherhood' had been seen as little more than an almost inconceivable aberration. What was more, the stories of the few who escaped their lands told of nothing but abject horrors being inflicted upon those unfortunate enough to live under their 'government.'\n\nAnd, so, when the Army had marched upon the Brotherhood in pursuit of its goals of regional unification, none had harbored any sympathies for them. They had fought fanatically, but were horrifically outnumbered and, in due time, fell like every other enemy. Upon entering Perm, however, the true work began.\n\nOrders had come from Samara - everything that could, in any fashion, be considered to represent either the Brotherhood or National Socialism was to be destroyed. Utterly. The soldiers, having seen ample proof of the previously rumoured horrors, took to this order with a furious zeal, and very soon statues, signs, artwork, and other artefacts of all kinds that represented the cruelty of the city's former masters began to disappear.\n\nWith any luck, many of the soldiers fervently hoped, the memories of what they represented would soon fade away. Forever."
 SAM.39.a: "A just fate for such symbols of hate."

 SAM.40.t: "A Profitable Demise"
 SAM.40.d: "A cunning man like Oktan knew that these fleeting moments shortly after Vlasov's death were ripe with opportunity. Others who were less intelligent may use the time for mourning, but Oktan had greater plans.\n\nConveniently, he just so happened to be scheduled to meet Vlasov in his office today and decided to let himself as a result of the chairman's tardiness. Of course, this wasn't quite true - even if Oktan would later alter the records to say as such. He did have a good reason for being there, however - a vital mission, one more step in the liberation of Russia!\n\nAnd so, Oktan slipped a lockpick from his pocket and set about liberating Vlasov's personal effects. The new chairman's grin widened as he yanked the first drawer open and saw the treasures within: a shiny Luger, a gift from some bribed German officer; an assortment of Soviet medals, stashed away in shame; ah, and some Vyatka vodka! Oktan took a swig, savoring the smoothness, then noticed the finest prize of all.\n\nA fat, crisp wad of Reichsmarks, several thousand at least. The last of his pay packets from the West Russian War, presumably. Oktan flicked through the notes, then raised them to his nose and inhaled deeply. There was nothing better than the clean, promising smell of German-minted currency on a sad day such as this.\n\nOktan quickly set about stuffing as much as he could carry into the pockets of his overcoat - and then paused. In all the excitement, he'd quite forgotten what Vlasov's passing meant. Chairman... Chairman Oktan. It had a nice ring to it. It was the ring of gold against silver, of fine crystal glasses being set before him and filled with Breton wine. Smiling again, he resumed his inveterate looting. Payday had finally arrived, and there would be many more to come."
 SAM.40.a: "Now, what else has he got in here?"

 ### Regional events ###
 SAM.41.t: "The Death of Vlasov"
 SAM.41.d: "Earlier this morning General Andrey Vlasov, the founder of our movement, was found to have died, peacefully, in his sleep.\n\nIn poor health for many years, Vlasov was well-aware of his own mortality, and in order to prevent disorder and confusion following this event, previously declared his favored successor in the so-called 'Secret Speech' to the then-Committee's assembled officer corps. That successor has been informed of Vlasov's passing, and the continuity and transition procedures previously written by Vlasov's office have been put into effect.\n\nA complicated man, Vlasov leaves behind an equally complicated legacy of both collaboration as well as liberation, and it is not clear how his past actions will be remembered in future years. Regardless of such future perceptions however, the state he founded in the aftermath of the West Russian War provided us with the foundation necessary to achieve regional unification, and this should not, and will not, be forgotten.\n\nVlasov's successor now faces the daunting task of not only strengthening our control over a region where many perceive us as illegitimate, but also preparing us for the conflicts to come as we pursue our ultimate goal of liberating all the peoples of Russia - from Europe to the Far East.\n\nWe hope they rise to meet the challenge."
 SAM.41.a: "General Bunyachenko assumes overall political authority."
 SAM.41.b: "Milety Zykov assumes overall political authority."
 SAM.41.c: "General Oktan assumes overall political authority"

 SAM.42.t: "Friend and Enemies" #Event for friends and enemies
 SAM.42.desc: "Chairman, the reports are much worse than we feared.\n\nSeveral villages and towns previously under communist control have risen up in revolt against the ROA. There are also tensions brewing in ethnic minority areas. Many locals see the death of General Vlasov as a signal of internal weaknesses within our government.\n\nThis angry rabble may be more correct than it suspects, as our military position is failing in many districts. The death of Commander Vlasov has sparked a storm of rumors that has now descended upon both our soldiers and our officers. Some units refuse our orders, claiming that your position as Chairman is illegitimate. Other garrisons have simply gone silent, failing to reply to our transmissions.\n\nAll hope is not yet lost, Chairman. It is likely that much of the confusion within our ranks can be dispelled by loyalist units. We can address discontent amongst the troops with minor reforms: such as increased pay or longer permissions now that the wars of unification are complete. As to the remaining mutineers, they will be crushed, and their sponsors will be smoked out.\n\nWe will make sense of this situation."
 SAM.42.a: "We must act quickly."

 SAM.43.t: "By the People"
 SAM.43.desc: ""For are we all not brothers, struggling together for unification? Have we not fought, shoulder to shoulder, side by side, in the trenches for years? If you lay down your guns now, our movement will be saved and no one will be hurt, I can promise that much. Remember, men, struggle not against your family, but against those who wish to take it away!"\n\nToday, Zykov took to the air to announce the end of the mutinies and to encourage the few still in arms to give up, offering amnesty to all those who were not directly involved in instigating the mutiny. The path to end the mutiny and prevent the implosion of the ROA into civil war was engineered masterfully by the veteran propagandist, who seemed to perfectly recall the tenets that Macchiavelli preached centuries ago. Zykov had bribed all who could be bought, talked down those who could be talked, and threatened violence upon those could not be satisfied with either. The combination worked, if only barely. Armed confrontation was reserved to a few hardcore mutineers, who utterly refused surrender. All of these facts, and an aura of relief brough by them, were swirling around the heads of the committee which Zykov now stood in front of.\n\nThe enigmatic orator had already given a cursory briefing on the situation and it's fallout. However, his coup-de-grace was yet to come. "As I'm sure all of you are aware, it was the perfidious Mikhail Oktan, who organized and financed this mutiny against the authority of our dear Chairman." For most, that was a surprise. The truth of the situation was that Oktan had nothing to do with the revolt - but Zykov knew an opportunity when he saw one. "Indeed it is clear, at least to me, that we can no longer tolerate rat-like insubordinates in our ranks, no matter how entrenched in favors they may be." Zykov looked around this room, his cool gaze analyzing each member. He was confident in their vote. One by one, each consented to Oktan's arrest. "Very well. If it is the will of the committee, and our dear Chairman, I will gladly order the arrest of Mikhail Oktan and his subsequent trial."\n\nOktan would not, in fact, get a trial. After his arrest, during which he made no small protest, he was taken to a small barn near the outskirts of Samara, and given a sentencing, summarily being shot. His body was burned in the hut's backyard, and that was the end of Mikhail Oktan."
 SAM.43.a: "Execute the guilty, spare the innocent."

 SAM.44.t: "For the People!"
 SAM.44.desc: "The few men and women who remained in the squalid basement knew that there was no longer any hope for resistance against the ROA to spread. That there was no longer any hope for Russia. And that there was no longer any hope for them at all.\n\nThey had thought that, with Zykov taking over as Chairman, there was a chance. After all, he did not have the military resolve of Bunyachenko, nor the connections of Oktan. But the propagandist, as they had all derisively referred to him, had proven far more resilient, and ruthless, than they had thought him capable of.\n\nFirst, he had taken action against the insurrectionist soldiers. Then he had done so against their officers. And then, turning his attention to them, he had issued an ultimatum, one so common in contemporary Russia - surrender or die.\n\nMany of their once-comrades already had, marching to interrogation and imprisonment. But they had not. They had refused, they had continued the fight, and they had, very quickly, lost. Zykov's now-compliant soldiers had pursued them as they fled, and even now they could hear the trucks and boots outside.\n\nAs one of the barred windows to street level was broken with a resounding crash, a bundle of grenades was thrown in, and a moment later what was left of the civilian resistance was no more."
 SAM.44.a: "Order has returned to the lands of the ROA. To the Chairman. As it should be."

 SAM.45.t: "Peace"
 SAM.45.desc: "It was a different Miletiy Zykov that entered Chairman Bunyachenko's office. In the best of times Zykov's manic energy and natural charisma had made it easy to see how the former journalist had gathered such a following. In bad times, Zykov's steely determination explained how the long suffering democratic faction had weathered ten years of abuse from various factions in Samara.\n\nToday's Zykov reminded Bunyachenko of seeing himself in a mirror. The former journalist did not walk into the office so much as he tumbled in, pushed around by the weight of events.\n\n"Zykov. Good to see you." The democratic activist began to speak, only for the Chairman to cut him off. "No, please let me continue. Right now, a tidal wave of shit is threatening to wash away our progress. The Officer Committee believes that Oktan is behind everything that's happening right now in the army and the liberated territories. You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces."\n\n"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the Officer Committee? I should go see them directly."\n\nBunyachenko smiled a little. Something of Zykov's old bravado remained. That was good. "The Officer Committee are useless, tired old men. On that, you, Oktan and I agree. No, Zykov, you will argue your case with me. You are an eloquent fellow. If you convince me that you can be of use, perhaps you'll see some of your dreams realized. I'm in the market for new... associates."\n\nZykov's eyes shone a little brighter. Or had it been just an illusion? The former journalist began to make his case as the Chairman leaned back into his chair. Contacts throughout northern Russia could be convinced to help end the revolts within the month."
 SAM.45.a: "Let's see this done within the week, Zykov."

 SAM.46.t: "...and Order"
 SAM.46.desc: "The village had been one of the last to be pacified. Communist partisans had resisted the ROA's siege to the bitter end, finally surrendering when the angry populace threatened to turn over the rebels themselves to end the blockade.\n\nThe disarmed community came to see the executions. Many of the partisans had been spared, merely shunted off into work camps with promises that good behavior would see their families well rewarded. The officers and those judged too radical had been kept on death's row long enough for fellow travellers to the other side to arrive. ROA officers all, corrupt to the bone and kindling for rebellion to a man.\n\nOne of the officers had not travelled far to meet his fate. Hours before recapturing the village, orders had come through for the man's arrest. Citing his insubordination and corruption, the men from Bunyachenko's entourage had relieved the commander of his post and tossed him into a holding cell. None among the soldiers doubted his guilt. The astute few noted the disgraced officer's tie to Oktan's faction. These were bad days for ambitious men within the army of liberation that did not bend the knee to the Officer Committee.\n\nSedated by defeat and by an extra set of emergency rations, the villagers crowded mutely around the execution grounds. The corrupt officers of the ROA died one by one, right next to the rebels that their idleness had unleashed. Soon all who threatened Chairman Bunyachenko's peace would be reduced to food for crows."
 SAM.46.a: "Peaceful as a silent battlefield."

 SAM.47.t: "Money"
 SAM.47.desc: "Sergey Bunyachenko sat in his office, flanked by a pair of his oldest friends - Arkady Popov and Alexey Antonov - who he had fought through most of the West Russian War with and had known for even longer. The pair were both prominent members of the Russian Liberation Army's Officer Committee that Bunyachenko chaired, and despite Oktan's ascension as Chairman of the liberation army, had both remained at his side despite the former's attempts at curbing or buying the Committee's power.\n\nBoth were oddly silent this morning, however, as Bunyachenko attempted to brainstorm ways to counter Oktan's influence. "It spreads like a cancer, Arkady..." he said, frustrated with his inability to stop the cretin. "He buys who he buys, and it seems like nowadays everyone has their price." The usually-loquacious Popov seemed dismal, while Antonov, ever the deadpan figure, remained steel-faced. "Well?" asked Bunyachenko. "What do we do now?"\n\nPopov nervously checked his watch, and was about to answer when a sharp rap at the door interrupted him. Before Bunyachenko could even ask who was interrupting him, four of his personal guards entered, their weapons drawn. Rising from his desk, Bunyachenko asked, "What is going on?" a tone of suspicion was confirmed as he looked to Popov and Antonov, who had since stood up and drawn their sidearms.\n\n"Sergey Bunyachenko," Antonov started, "the Officer Committee has placed you under arrest following an investigation into corruption and nepotism charges. We have reviewed the case and have sentenced you to death. Please don't make this harder than it already is." As he was marched out of his office by his two former friends, he asked, "How much did Oktan offer you?""
 SAM.47.a: ""He offered enough.""

 SAM.48.t: "...And Power"
 SAM.48.desc: "Maksim had always hated the Vlasovites. His father had fought them during the first German invasion, and he himself had fought them in the second.\n\nSo when he heard of a growing movement to rise up against them, before they could strengthen their control over the territories they had conquered, he was among the first in line. Together, and under the command of those who had recruited them, he and other volunteers in the militia soon found themselves equipped with surprisingly modern weapons and tasked with holding the city centre against a Vlasovite formation.\n\nMaksim was surprised at how easy it was. The Vlasovites seemed disunited, and he was certain that he had heard shots from their positions, down the street from his own barricade. As the days passed, however, he grew confused. Why wasn't the militia advancing? Why was the commander, the man who had spoken so passionately about revolt and had somehow secured such high-quality weapons, now just sitting in the command post?\n\nHis confusion was only heightened when the commander suddenly ordered them to stockpile their weapons and assemble in formation before himself and his hand-picked officers. And then, as a car drove up and a man emerged, a man Maksim recognized as the local black marketeer and a functionary of the hated General Oktan, it all became, at last and far, far too late, abundantly clear.\n\nA satchel was handed to the commander, the commander gestured to his officers, and the officers raised their weapons. Maksim managed only a half-step before the bullet pierced his skull. Six hours later Maksim's body joined those of his compatriots in a mass grave as the black marketeer looked on, pleased with the success of his own small part in General Oktan's plot to distract and occupy the army. He wondered how much he would be paid.\n\nHe knew the amount would be generous. The General always was."
 SAM.48.a: "Useful catspaws."

 SAM.49.t: "Alone on Evening Watch"
 SAM.49.desc: "Nikolai's patrol circled back to the campfire. Little remained of it by this time of the day. Points of lights, soft in the evening's dusk. One of the other soldiers had put some potatoes to roast by the embers before going to sleep.\n\nThe fighting had come and gone so rapidly, a startling nightmare after months of the campaign, soon dispelled once the high command had woken up to the chaos. Now mutinous soldiers and rebellious civilians alike had been dealt with. Discontent was once more forced to lurk in the shadow.\n\nThe soldier sat by the ashes and picked up one of the potatoes. Still warm to the touch. Nikolai was grateful for the attention of his comrades. He ate in silence, rifle on his lap. Out in the valley below most lights blinked out for the night. Electricity was still a rarity, and candles an important necessity in a now peaceful Russia. Perhaps peace would bring more light.\n\nThe soldier picked up the other potato, and stood up. The embers glowered at him. So easily could the fire begin anew. Nikolai kicked dirt over them and began to make his way back to the barracks."
 SAM.49.a: "Hopefully no more revolts will ignite."

 SAM.50.t: "To the Urals and Beyond!"
 SAM.50.desc: "The new recruits diligently completed their physical training under the encouragements and insults of their drill officers. Nikolai occasionally looked at the candidates as he patrolled around the base.\n\nThese were a new breed of recruits, motivated and voluntary men. Not the desperate conscript of the German days. Nor the starving peasants begging to hold a rifle in exchange for some food of the dark days in Samara. These recruits were looking to join the ROA and take place in the further liberation of Russia. Of course, for every voluntary man ten more had to be drafted. Yet, something of a change in atmosphere could be detected.\n\nDifferent too were the officers. Many were recently promoted, taking up spots once occupied by old, bitter or desperate men. Out here on the border, so close to the Urals, the new generation of ROA officers prepared for the great crusade east.\n\nMuch remained to be done. New guns, new tanks, better training standards. Yet Nikolai found himself hopeful. Changes were coming, and the ROA's enemies were right to fear the coming war."
 SAM.50.a: "If one wants peace..."

 SAM.51.t: "A Meeting"
 SAM.51.desc: "The dingy, dusk-filled bar was an odd choice for a meeting location, thought Major Evgeny Sobol. As he descended the stairs from the entrance into the bar located in the cellar of an old building in the city and spotted his American contact however, he understood exactly why the location had been chosen. Sobol was a man of the military, ultimately, and his assignment to meet with the American Central Intelligence Agency was because years ago, he had experience dealing with Soviet intelligence. "An oxymoron, I know", he liked to joke with other ROA members. There was nothing humorous in the man who sat at a table in the back, poorly illuminated by a combination of candles and old lights. He had a grizzled look about him, a man who clearly hadn't gotten a chance to shave in a few days, some rough scruff growing into a full-fledged beard. As he approached the table, the individual looked up and slowly rose, shaking Sobol's hand.\n\n"Utkin." He introduced himself in flawless Russian, albeit with the accent of an English speaker. "Parents fled the revolution", he explained further, referencing the Soviets. "Grew up speaking Russian at home, English in school. It's good to meet you, Colonel Maksimov."\n\n'Maksimov?' Thought Sobol. The other man thought he was speaking to Sobol's commanding officer. "Major Sobol, actually. Colonel Maksimov is my superior.", the Russian officer responded, taking a seat across from Utkin, trying to ignore the look of disappointed disinterest in the spook's expression. "It's good to finally sit down with you, and discuss our future with America."\n\n"And what future would that be, major?" the agent responded.\n\nThe question took Sobol aback - he had barely been briefed on the meeting, outside of the fact of who he was meeting and what they were discussing. That much became obvious when Sobol stumbled over his words. "Ah, well, recognition. Support-", Sobol responded. As he attempted to go on, he was interrupted by the American.\n\n"Listen. Not that anyone's asking me, but I don't really care about your organization's reputation. I think you're doing God's work. But some of my higher-ups don't feel the same. A lot of the CIA remembers your organization as it was years ago. My being on the ground here doesn't change that. Between you and me?" Utkin leaned in. "You guys have a lot of rebranding to do. Until then, it's going to be very hard for me to convince my handlers of anything."\n\nSobol attempted to protest. "Isn't it clear that we're not interested in collaboration anymore? It was only ever a means to an end. Believe me, our leaders are planning retribution against the Germans on a massive scale." It was no use, however. A few vodkas later, Sobol left the bar with very little to tell his superior."
 SAM.51.a: "Reputations are hard to shed."

 SAM.52.t: "Friend from Abroad"
 SAM.52.desc: "It would hardly be proper for a statesman, let alone the man put in charge of the restoration of Russia, to frequent, let alone be familiar with, the shady back alleys of what typically passed as a settlement in ROA-controlled Western Russia. However, Mikhail Oktan was far from the typical statesman. He revelled in the shadows, likening himself to a puppet master at play, jangling around those who he bought or blackmailed as if they were marionettes, setting up corrupt deals and meeting wealthy magnates. In a dingy, run-down bar, where Oktan frequently held court, the type of place where you had to take three alleys from the main street to get there, a special session was taking place.\n\nEver since he had attained his position at the top of the ROA's leadership, Oktan had been frequenting his old contacts less and less, relying on his more trusted and thuggish cronies to tie up loose ends and ensure both compliance and loyalty among those who still had their uses. However, music played loudly, and the raucous nature of his little backalley hideaway betrayed his presence. Sitting at his table that he had specifically made up for himself, seemingly sitting court among the bar patrons, and flanked on all sides by the scariest bodyguards he could buy, Oktan faced a trio of less-than-savoury Russians who lived beyond the Urals. The three men called themselves the Goncharov Brothers, and while none of them were related, each one was nastier than the next. One, a trader from Nizhny Novgorod who dabbled in less savory trades than guns, the second an ashamed "made man" from the thief's territory, and the third a disgraced middling officer from the city of Tyumen accused by Kaganovich's commissars as corrupt. Each one of them had fled from their lives, fleeing stark justice, only to redefine themselves as smugglers who worked for the most powerful, or anyone else who would pay more. The trio had made their first fortune smuggling contraband eastwards, across the Urals. They were still under his employ, but they had been called to talk to the new Grand Marshal, now that he was fully in control of Western Russia. After ensuring that all three of them had some of the nicest vodka in the joint, Oktan opened.\n\n"Gentlemen. I'm sure that all three of you have heard about my promotion."\n\n"But of course, Grand Marshal. A big step up, that's for sure." the man from Tyumen stated.\n\n"Then I won't have to remind you of how important you are to me... now more than ever. And how vital it is to make sure you stay important."\n\nNerves gave way to alcohol, however, as Oktan and his smugglers drank the night away, each party assured of their continued prosperity."
 SAM.52.a: "A kafkaesque display."

 SAM.53.t: "An End to Martial Law"
 SAM.53.desc: "Shuvaya was a place that had become used to being a small dot on the map that local warlords fought over. But as the Russian states began to coalesce, its "importance", if it ever had one, was beginning to be forgotten. It had been a key location for an anti-ROA revolt by old-time Pro-Soviet guerrillas, unwilling to accept the primacy of the ROA. As such the village and its inhabitants were treated incredibly harshly when the counterrevolutionary army swept in and slaughtered the partisans that resisted them. The winds of change were clearly afoot, however. An ROA soldier nailed an announcement on the dilapidated bulletin board in the center of the town. As he slunked off, the villagers who had seen him putting up the announcement quickly gathered around the piece of paper, expecting more bad news. They would be surprised - "Martial law to end in one week", the pamphlet claimed. "Village council rule to resume the following." The group was positively shocked as the announcement continued to detail the reach of council rule - which had never been witnessed in Shuvaya - as well as the various responsibilities and powers that were associated with the councils. The pamphlet described council rule as a contract between the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia and each individual village council, where both worked to better themselves and the nation. It was a surprisingly fair deal for the Shuvayan peasants, who had so far been poorly treated by the ROA.\n\nSome of the most skeptical thought that it was a trap - but it became clear that the order was genuine in a week's time when, true to their word, the local ROA garrison withdrew from the town and ended martial law. As the last truck drove down the dirt path back towards civilization, the people of Shuvaya found themselves, temporarily, without government. It was a strange feeling, even for the youngest of villagers. For the first time in a long time, there was peace, they had just been willingly granted autonomy by the soldiers that they once hated. Like a deer in headlights, the people seemed to be stunned. But that very afternoon a group of the most experienced, and, in general, the oldest residents of the village set up a council to prepare themselves for self-government. This council would become one of hundreds, varying in size and importance, to be created by Zykov's relaxation of emergency rule."
 SAM.53.a: "Perhaps, finally, a return to normalcy?"

 SAM.54.t: "The New Normal"
 SAM.54.desc: "With the end of war, a lot of free time had irrupted in the colonel's life. The insurrections and mutiny had brought a momentary surge of chaos. Since then, however, the ROA had resumed its usual mix of peace time training and high level politicking.\n\nNot that much successful politicking had taken place in the colonel's life of late. Doors had begun closing to him. Everyone within the Officer Committee seemed on guard. Many men had died after the mutinies for suspected corruption. Their replacements had been hand picked by Chairman Bunyachenko.\n\nThe Chairman himself was a different man. Once eternally listless, Commander Bunyachenko spent his days doing paperwork in his office, and his evening drinking with other officers. A quiet and respected officer, but not one to show any initiative. Nowadays, determination had replaced melancholy in the general's posture.\n\nRumors circulated of the Chairman calling for a constitutional convention. Many in the old officer clique assumed this would be the perfect opportunity to present a shopping list to Commander Bunyachenko to make the Officer Committee eternally important in the new era. But the colonel was no longer sure Commander Bunyachenko would not have an agenda of his own. Times were changing, they were changing extremely quickly."

 SAM.55.t: "The Gift"
 SAM.55.desc: "The seemingly-ancient troop truck surged up one hill and down the next, with each small incline or pothole feeling as if it would be the truck's last. The beast had seen the chaos of the 50's, survived the West Russian War, was captured three different times by three different warlords, before finally ending up in the reserve arsenal of the Russian Liberation Army. It had been doled out to Vadim Kovalevsky so that he and the garrison that was assigned to him could make their way to Yerykly.\n\nKovalevsky, a junior officer of the ROA, was quickly bought by Oktan soon after he received his post, mostly because of Kovalevsky's drinking problem and penchant for violence where needed. He played his role during the tumultuous time between Vlasov's death and Oktan's assumption of power, and because of that, he had been parcelled out a small village and its environs as a reward. Kovalevsky, poorly read and fat off of the luxuries provided by his master, was more than happy, after a few vodkas, of course, to accept the "gift" that Oktan had provided him. The sobering reality of the situation only set in when he was woken up the next morning and told that he was to report to his new fiefdom.\n\nYerykly was a village where the primary export was poverty. The streets were dirt on a good day, mud on most, and the most exciting thing that had happened here since the end of the terror bombings was that one of the cows had given birth to twins. Now, Kovalevsky, who had grown up a refugee from the Germans to the West of Samara, knew desperate times. As he stepped off of his troop truck, he found his welcome completely ignored by most of the village's inhabitants, who continued on with their daily lives. Kovalevsky had a flash, for just a brief moment - the place, somehow, reminded him of home. But as reality sank in, he knew that the relative comfort of Samara was long behind him, and his faint smile turned to grimace. The only consolation that he had was, for now, this entire village lived and died on his decree."

 SAM.56.t: "The Maestro and His Orchestra"
 SAM.56.desc: "The Constitutional Convention for the Provisional Commissariat of Western Russia was of utter chaos - Zykov hadn't just invited important ROA magnates, but also hardcore democrats, some of whom were former members of the Komi Republic, ex-Tsarists who had operated under Vladmir III's controversial regime, cautious reformers, drawn from both Zykov's supporters and beyond. He had, perhaps most controversially, invited a series of left-leaning politicians as well - those who had definitely been members of the CPSU at one point or another, some of whom even utterly refused to renounce their allegiance to a leftist ideology. The convention - attended by 59 members plus Zykov himself, had been passionately arguing with itself for quite some time. Not just over the nature of the constitution, but the future of Russia as a whole. The only thing that kept the delegates in check were reminders that their participation was contingent on keeping the convention civil, as well as the several armed ROA guards that lined the large conference room.\n\nZykov intermittently participated, but also went about various other duties of state as well, and was thus often absent for a lot of the debates. In his stead, a secretary took what notes he could and sent them off for review by the Chairman. Additionally, any changes or proposed clauses to be put in to the constitution were brought to Zykov personally, in front of the convention, where he would give his often-critical opinion on the proposed additions, which tended to be well received by the voting members of the convention - especially considering how many of the delegates were suspiciously oft in agreement with Zykov's "decrees", as some more independent-minded delegates began to seethingly call them.\n\nZykov read over the newest proposed provision for the constitution. Clearly, it had been drafted by the convention's more radical elements - the words that stood out to him were "fully representative democracy." The entire clause called for that and more. Something that Zykov was personally not interested in, but also that even considering implementing something like that would not only alienate the officers of the ROA, but perhaps even induce them to revolt. A dangerous consideration for the Chairman who often felt he walked a razor's edge.\n\n"This part here, it's unacceptable to the convention. Democracy indeed, but the term 'fully representative' cannot be expected within the realities of Russia."\n\nAnd with that, the provision was discarded, the convention continued their bickering."
 SAM.56.a: "Ah, democracy."

 SAM.57.t: "Setting Up the Stage"
 SAM.57.desc: "Commander Bunyachenko sat at his desk once more, alone in his thoughts. The upcoming constitutional convention occupied his mind. A bone to the nation's civilian administrators, the upcoming transition from martial law to a more natural order of things would help relieve pressure on the Chairman's administration.\n\nIt was also a clever trap for the Officer Committee, or so Bunyachenko hoped. The ROA's grandees expected to enshrine their power and influence in the new nation's DNA, to ensure a permanent high status to the ROA's supreme officers. To do this, they relied on the Chairman's favor. After all, had Bunyachenko not been a creature of the committee all these years?\n\nThe Chairman grimaced. A lot of things had changed since the start of the Russian unification wars. The death of Vlasov, Oktan's quixotic mutinies, the widespread partisan unrest. The ROA did not scale well to its new role as both army and government of an entire nation. Bunyachenko had called on industrialists, on mayors and commune leaders, on lower ranking ROA officers to attend the convention as part of his coalition. It was necessary to render the Officer Committee irrelevant if a new, strong Russia was to begin. A strong Russia, led by a strongman with almost universal support, ready to enter the modern era. Commander Bunyachenko knew he would be up to the occasion. Failure was not an option."

 SAM.58.t: "Starting the Convention"
 SAM.58.desc: "The Constitutional Convention for the Provisional Commissariat of Western Russia had just opened on its third day when Mikhail Oktan, Grand Marshal of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia, made his grand appearance at the convention. Decked in the traditional ROA's officer garb and a dark grey trench coat draped over his shoulders, the medals that he had awarded himself seemed comically large on his chest. He shook hands and saluted all of those who greeted him, and espoused his charismatic, dynamic exterior for the whole convention to see. It almost seemed more a procession than an entrance, but after all, the Grand Marshal did preside over the convention.\n\nAs he took his place at the front of the gathered delegates, he observed those who had earned a place at the convention: from the military wing, his most trusted and skilled generals, those who had earned a place at the Grand Marshal's side. Beside them sat the more junior officers, the ones that he couldn't name, but that he, and his trusted senior comrades, had seen fit to bestow administrative responsibilities to large tracts of land in Western Russia. He may not have known their names, but clearly their hearts were in the right place. Next to them sat the noticeably smaller civilian wing.\n\nThese were the real question marks in Oktan's mind - he had his trusted aides put feelers out in Samara and other large cities under the control of the KONR for any "dynamic individual" who had the money, manpower, and desire to cooperate closely with the Grand Marshal and his plans for the future. These were industrialists, technocrats, disgraced former politicians. Each one of them with an interest and, to Oktan, a payoff. Looking over all those assembled, Oktan began to talk, his raspy, but powerful voice booming through the room, made louder by the ancient microphone he was speaking into.\n\n"My friends, thank you for joining me here today, in the true spirit of a Russian state!" Respectful clapping followed, before he continued. "As most of you know, we all have been working tirelessly to forge a Russia independent of the communists, who have been doing nothing but causing issues for our land for decades. With this convention, we have taken a massive step towards destroying their movement completely. And once we do, we can begin looking at turning our Russia into a rich nation... one where all will be without want, free to help forge a strong identity and forever prevent the slide of our people back into the depravity of communism. For now, however, we must continue discussing our constitution. I see here, on page fourteen...""
 SAM.58.a: "... same as the old boss."

 SAM.59.t: "Better Courts"
 SAM.59.desc: "Today, Zykov's choice of judges for both supreme and provincial courts was announced, much to the chagrin of a large fraction of the ROA but to the relief of many others. It was made public that in both federal and provincial courts, that there would be a mixture of civilian and military judges, the latter only making up about a third of the judiciary. The move was controversial, but ultimately in line with the Chairman's vision for a democratic Russia that prioritized the needs of its citizenry. Zykov, still always careful to walk the razor's edge between his vision and the military's reactionism, ensured that those appointed to their respective positions, civilian or military, were in his pocket. That way, at the very least, they could make their case for Zykov and defend his choices to their respective supporters. Of course, the civilian judges and the military judges both had their own agendas - after all, everyone wanted something. But the aim was that, despite their affiliation, they would remain loyal to the Chairman.\n\n"Welcome to your new office, judge." Anatoly Ignatov's brother said, emphasizing his new title as the pair of them entered into the large room. A comfortable area, the office would be the headquarters for Ignatov's new job - that of judge. He had been handpicked by the ROA following the Chairman's insistence on forming a coherent and comprehensive judiciary. Despite the fact that he was a civilian, he met with Zykov's deputies, who, apparently, were enamored with the now-judge's ideas of justice and sensibility. Of course, the position wasn't without responsibilities, nor was Ignatov's conscience clean; the former community leader did have to make some deals with the deputies to ensure that he got the position. This of course, included an unspoken provision that he was to be loyal to the Chairman, and by extension, the entire committee. But this was a small price to pay for the position that he now found himself in. As he explored the room, his brother, in awe at the place, asked him a question. "So where will you start? How does this even work?" Anatoly thought for a bit before responding.\n\n"I guess we'll find out.""
 SAM.59.a: "A fair judiciary."

 SAM.60.t: "The Military Courts"
 SAM.60.desc: "The Committee for the Liberation of Russia had long concerned itself with what liberated Russia would look like. Theory has often, however, had to give ground to practical considerations as strict martial law was the order of the day in any piece of territory captured by the ROA. The years of idleness in and around Samara have seen a large amount of Imperial and Soviet laws grafted to the civil and criminal code wherever the ROA's officer judged it fit.\n\nChairman Bunyachenko's advisors have trimmed this ball of legal precedents down to coherent and useful civil and military codes. These will be enacted by a new system of tribunals staffed with former ROA soldiers. The supreme court of the republic itself will be stacked with men loyal to the Chairman. As such Commander Bunyachenko expects favorable hearing as his consolidation of power continues. The failure of the opposition to prevent this marks another victory in Chairman Bunyachenko's consolidation of power."
 SAM.60.a: "Hard laws for a strong nation."

 SAM.61.t: "A Place to Settle Disputes"
 SAM.61.desc: "Mikhail Oktan was tired of meetings. All he did day in and day out were meetings. Meetings about funding, meetings about peasant unrest, meetings about what uniforms he could and couldn't wear in public. After he had finished his lunch, he had dismissed all of his meetings for the rest of the day - except one, his aide reminded him. He couldn't possibly postpone the meeting of prominent military and civilian officials to finalize the judiciary system in the Provisional Commissariat. Especially, as the aide had pointed out, that the officers who he was meeting with, he had sent them out to their fiefs but had so soon recalled them.\n\nReluctantly, and with a belly fuller than he could remember, he sat down with the eight individuals, five military and three civilian, to hash out and complete the judicial code for the Russia that he envisioned. Despite his lethargic outlook, he soon took to the task with his normal charisma, cracking jokes and living up to his image as the most sociable head of state west of the Urals.\n\n"So, let's get down to business, shall we?" He asked those gathered, laziness rapidly dissipating in favour of excitement. The Grand Marshal laid out a number of documents, which were passed around the group. "As you can see, we're looking at a dual military-civilian system. The military governor of a province appoints a political chief, which deals with any civilian case in the district, but can be appealed or vetoed by the military governor. Cases won't be able to be taken federally, the military governor is the highest say." Oktan shifted in his chair, looking more towards the officers. "Military disputes will be handled federally. A group of officers will serve in positions as judges and will be handpicked by me. A judge can be removed if the majority of the judges vote them off, or if I want them off. I'd pick a successor. These disputes and proceedings would be similar to military tribunals, complete with your pick of various legal provisions." Looking directly at the officers, he emphasized, "Remember, I take care of our boys.""

 SAM.62.desc: ""So we know that we'll win here, and here. I'm confident this town will go for the ROA. We'll make sure of it. So we can lump them in with the Izhevsk District."\n\n"And what about these guys? We can't put them in their own district, it'll weigh the odds against us. We can lump them in with district 137a. Sounds good?"\n\n"If it works, it works. What about Gelevkar? And Syktyvkar?"\n\n"Syktyvkar is a toss-up. Make it its own district, there's no way we can predict what'll happen there."\n\nToday, Zykov's vision of a unicameral system of parliament to represent "all the peoples of Russia" began its first step towards realization. Zykov announced the formation of a parliament following general elections during a grand ceremony in Samara, where apparently, "all free Russians" would be able to vote. The reaction to this announcement was mixed among the people of Russia.\n\nIn places like Samara, which had known ROA rule for so long, it was a welcome relief to military rule, and Yedinstvo, the political party representing the ROA, candidates were projected to win in landslides. In other places, the news of elections were more tentative.\n\nThe gentry of Syktyvkar, those who survived its conquest, were cynical and suspicious of the elections, and immediately pointed out the great degree of gerrymandering that had gone on in certain areas. This gerrymandering, likely, they claimed, all but ensured the victory of the Yedinstvo in various areas to make sure that its interests were represented in the government. But Zykov's official representatives denied this claim vehemently.\n\nIn the north, where the Soviet remnants once reigned supreme, feelings were ambivalent. For the ideological hardliners, those who fled with the front, rigorous campaigning for candidates as left as was allowed occurred, but many others, natives, cared little. Regardless, the winds of change were blowing, and even the most ignorant Russian peasant couldn't escape Zykov's careful, calculated democratization."

 SAM.63.t: "The Shape of the Future Nation"
 SAM.63.desc: "The debates raged back and forth about the shape of the newly liberated nation. The election of Chairman Bunyachenko to the provisional presidency of the new Russian Republic faced no real opposition, as democrats and officers both feared the return of chaos enough to let the Chairman's demands through. The only question that remained was, President to what type of republic?\n\nA strong push by Zykov's faction for a democratic unicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage faced a barrage of criticism from ROA grandees. Their counter proposal of a legislature appointed by the Officer Committee brought the convention to a stand still for some time until Chairman Bunyachenko brought along a new proposal of a bicameral legislature. An elected lower chamber would keep accountable an appointed upper house.\n\nCynics could accuse this scheme of favoring the Chairman's own interests in the long run. The democratic lower house's extremely limited power would impose few restrictions on the actions of the senate. A realist, however, would see how astute the Chairman's compromise solution was in threading the needle between various interest groups.\n\nIn return for Bunyachenko's partial support for their proposal, the Officer Committee agreed to let him appoint many of the initial senators for five year terms. The list of candidates being brought forward by the Chairman's faction is expected to contain loyalists to the President, technocrats and industrialists willing to enact the President's rumored radical reforms. The democratic faction itself is likely to receive a few important ministries as a reward for their cooperation."

 SAM.64.t: "A Lucrative Offer"
 SAM.64.desc: "The office that had once belonged to Andrey Vlasov had since been repurposed by the newest Grand Marshal. Mikhail Oktan, once he had secured his position at the head of the Committee, took over the office and had it transformed into his own personal throne room. Entering from the front, a long red carpet led from the oaken double doors to the large, ancient desk that the Grand Marshal sat at. Portraits of great Russians, including Oktan himself, adorned the walls, but there was a conspicuous lack of Vlasov's presence. Throughout most of the day, Oktan and his closest confidants caroused themselves and those that they met with to the point that the Grand Marshal could barely remember everything that he had done and all who he had met with.\n\n"Clearly our dear, departed leader was doing this all wrong!" Oktan exclaimed to uproarious laughter, exactly when Grigory Lagunov stepped into the room. The officer was a newcomer to the ROA's senior ranks, and was considered a bit of a teetotaler. His uniform was always immaculate and he never slouched, nor did he ever drink or smoke.\n\n"You wanted to see me, Grand Marshal?"\n\nOktan made a welcoming gesture, practically begging the man to join them. "Yes, yes! Come in, please! I wanted to see you, Colonel Lagunov," Oktan's face dropped his smile, and he turned deadpan. "About something very, very serious." Oktan and his company watched as the color drained from the colonel's face.\n\nThey gave it a few seconds, allowing the officer, who surely thought that he was about to be shot, to advance towards them before they burst out into laughter. "Look at your face!" the Grand Marshal cackled. "No, no, nothing like that..." he said, calming himself down after a fit of laughter. "The Committee would like you to... well, grant you the governorship of the province of Nizhny Novgorod!"\n\nLagunov, clearly not having recovered from the fright, wasn't quite sure what to say. "A... a governorship?" he repeated. Oktan rolled his eyes.\n\n"Come now, don't be so suspicious. Is this because of the joke? I'm sorry. Yes, we want you to govern the region. You'll be subject to the federal government, of course, which means that you'll owe taxes, as well as conscription and equipment levies. But you can make your own laws, within reason of course, so long as they only apply within the borders of the area that you control! How's that sound?"\n\nThe colonel was taken aback. He had been smart enough to keep his head down during Oktan's accession, but he had never expected this. "I... well, I must accept." Lagunov took a drink with the officers for the first time in a long time, and he left the "meeting" satisfied, knowing that he would be presiding over his hometown."

You will have a half-hour unpaid lunch break, and you will leave at 7:30. Pay is weekly and handed out by me. Sick leave must be declared before it is taken, and will not be paid. Any injuries are to be reported directly to me before the wounded individual is taken to the aid station. For those of you who do not know, you are being paid $1.00 above the minimum wage. Are there any questions?"\n\nThe Perm Armaments Factory no.32 opened today, as one of many government-controlled enterprises that did the same under Zykov's dual public-private sector industrial policy. This factory, like its sister facilities all across the territory of the Provisional Commissariat, would be working day-in and day-out to produce weapons and ammunition for the ever-hungry ROA. Owned and operated by the government, these arms factories, once seen as a dreadful deal by a number of local residents, had become beacons of job stability and good pay as a result of government investment into making working conditions and wages livable, at the very least. Zykov had worked for a long time to ensure a good, stable industrial base for the ROA back when it was scratching out a meager existence around Samara, and later once he was the guiding hand behind Vlasov's policies. Now that he was at the helm of the Provisional Commissariat, a coherent, effective, and most importantly, fair, industrial policy had been put in place by Zykov and his administration.\n\nThe military industry would be almost entirely state-controlled: The line between the military-industrial sector and the ROA itself seemed to be distinct, if blurry at times. This way the state could guide the necessities of military production while also ensuring that the needs of the soldiers are met. The civilian sector, however, was almost immediately privatised. The government sold off a number of factories that had been seized during the ROA's conquest of Western Russia, and those they couldn't sell, they simply handed out to conglomerates and corporations. Working conditions were exponentially better than they had been a mere few years ago, and while a civilian factory job was far from perfect, it was, at least, stable."

The new Chairman, however, silenced the feverish complaints that such a project could not be realized. Had the Japanese not carved an empire of steel in Manchuria where once only dusty steppe could be found? Had not the damn Bukharinists developed the Central Siberian heavy industry in such a time span?\n\nCombining a modern central financial system and interlocking shareholders, a select set of industrial concerns would be expanded horizontally and vertically into economical juggernauts dubbed kombinats. The presence of allies of the government in key financial institutions would be used to feed loyal businesses, and prevent hostile takeovers by national or international rivals. In preparation for liberation of the rest of Russia, military supplying contracts would provide initial fuel for the rise of these kombinats.\n\nBunyachenko's speech concluded, the Chairman stood and answered questions. Invited industrialists bombarded him with questions and concerns, initially. In time, however, suggestions and ideas began outweighing negativity. Here was the opportunity of a century for ambitious men of the room."

They were the governors of more eastward territories in his slice of Russia, and as such felt bolder in defying him.\n\nFinally, he had enough. Pressing a small buzzer under his desk, his personal guards stepped through the door, guns drawn. The officers stepped back in shock, some went for their sidearms but their compatriots stopped them before they could do anything stupid.\n\n"Gentlemen, I did not want to resort to such... direct measures, but if you will not listen to reason then you give me no choice. You WILL accept these new measures, you WILL continue to supply the tithes I am due, and if you comply, you WILL live to see your lands again.

Instead, a state free of the stain of leftism or monarchism has been established. Our goal, the goal of the Provisional Commissariat, is to protect the Russian people from the dangers of these ideologies and extremism in general, as well as to forge a strong state, free of foreign influence; we must prevent another tragedy like the West Russian War!"\n\nThe content of the pamphlet had been as baffling to the village's priest as it was to the individual who had picked it up after seeing that it had been dropped by a plane flying above, heading east for a bit before circling back and heading west, dropping pamphlets as they flew. The natural barrier of the Ural Mountains had acted as a blocker for news, heading both westwards and eastwards. The only exception to that was the Republic of Zlatoust, but even then their merchants tended to keep all non-essential information close to their chest. However, as proto-states coalesced in Western Russia and east of the Urals, it became increasingly inevitable that there would be communication and interaction between the two areas. The disconnect between the expectations of interactions by the Committee and the realities of the situation to the east, however, caused their pamphlets to cause more confusion among communities than inspiration and hope for an oncoming "liberation.""

The pair, alongside the rest of their squad, had finally been taken off of frontline action in a standard troop rotation, and Volkov found himself oddly empty. To his surprise, he had enjoyed his time on the frontlines, even during the bloody unification wars against the Tsarists, communists, and others. He had felt a pride in his chest, as if he was doing something good for the first time in his life, and that he was working towards something greater than himself. But rearguard duty was sort of boring to the young corporal. As he pulled off his new boots, he noted how much comfier they were than the ones he had been issued when he first joined up. Storing his assault rifle, he recalled the days when he had been given: a German-made Kar98k, the bolt of which seemed to jam after every other shot. Now what he - and his entire squad, for that matter - were issued could seemingly be dragged through the mud and still work. The changes were incredibly apparent for the young man, who had witnessed vast change in his relatively short tenure. As he sat back down on his bunk, Pavlovsky, across from him, was reading. With change in his mind, he asked the grizzled veteran, "Say, Pavlovsky, what do you think of everything that's changed?"\n\nA small grin crept over Pavlovsky's face as he turned his head to face Volkov and closed his book. "I think that the changes are pretty crazy. If you told me, three year ago, that I'd be sitting here with a belly full of food, clothes that haven't been worn by three other people before me, and a gun that works, I'd have told you that you're crazy." The man was notoriously laconic, but Volkov always pressed him for more. "Have you ever seen anything like this before? I mean... When the army was forced to fight with the Germans."\n\nSilence, before Pavlovsky's response came. "Oh, God, I can't remember, it seems." He ran a hand through his silver scruff. "I can barely even remember the equipment they gave us. The missions we were given. Complete suicide, they were. You'd be lucky to get their assault rifle, the StG. Usually you'd have old rifles, the ones that... I guess their own soldiers couldn't use?" There was a pause, the old soldier sighing. "There are so few of us left from then. But I think that every one of us is grateful for what we have now. Besides, now that we're free from the grip of the Germans, well, I finally feel pride in fighting for something other than revenge.""

Now, the fruit of reforms were on display as the new ROA prepared its final set of field exercises.\n\nHordes of conscripted light infantry prepared for battle, kept hungry by constant discipline and motivated by endless propaganda. Weak, degenerate cowards held the rest of Russia, and there was a fortune in the making for bold soldiers like them. Behind them marched the veterans of the ROA, hardened by years of struggle. Only the toughest had made it this far, and this kernel of elite troops would be the anvil upon which the enemy would be shattered. Behind them further, new vehicles. Everyday new tanks rolled out of production lines and into ROA garrisons. The ROA had won Western Russia's industry, and now this industry would protect the brave men that would liberate Russia.\n\nThe grim enthusiasm of this army closely approximated, but did not quite resemble the ROA of old. Resigned professionalism had given way to bloody enthusiasm. The officer corps, once united by a dream of something bigger, now fought for glory and loot.

This informal network, known as the "Shepchushchaya Galereya", or whispering gallery, had become the paramount organization for intelligence gathering and dissention prevention. Zykov knew that it was indispensable, and the sheer size of both the Galereya's agents and the territory they now had to cover essentially warranted by necessity its reformation into an official, government-sanctioned agency: The Ministry of Truth. From the lowliest soldier to some of the highest ranking officials in Zykov's realm, suddenly, as informants, they found themselves under the scrutiny of a new set of handlers, professionally and deftly collecting information and dispensing rewards as needed.\n\nCorporal Gennady Bogomolov sat in a barren office, nervously smoking. The young soldier, having willingly joined the ROA not too long ago, had already begun a seemingly-meteoric rise through the ranks due to his loyalty and leadership qualities. But it was just that loyalty that had caused himself to wander into the office of Leonid Viktorov, the local Ministry of Truth political officer. Bogomolov watched Viktorov, the officer's back to him, as he searched his records for two specific names. It was clear Viktorov was no soldier - longer hair, a scruffy beard, and, while hardly noticeable to the untrained eye, a small pot belly that betrayed the luxury that he had known. However, the bureaucrat-turned-agent's reputation for making Zykov's problems go away had preceded him. There were even rumors flying around the NCOs that if Viktorov arrived at your barracks, it was because he was planning to clean house. But Viktorov had been with Bogomolov's garrison for over a week and no arrests nor executions had come.\n\n"You did the right thing, coming to me about this." Viktorov said, still leaning over his files, before eventually picking a pair of them up and sliding them across the table. "It's these two you were speaking of, correct?" Personnel files on two separate soldiers who had been on the pay of Oktan were shown to Bogomolov.\n\nThe corporal took a long drag from his cigarette. "Yes, these two. What'll happen to them?" Viktorov smiled an empty smile.\n\n"That's for me to worry about. You're dismissed. And ah, before you go." the officer continued, pulling out a pack of Bogomolov's favourite obscure cigarettes and passing them to him. "Remember to choose your friends carefully." As Bogomolov walked back to the barracks, he couldn't help but ponder if Viktorov was trying to buy him or threaten him."

 SAM.72.desc: "The National Security Service, or SNB, had certainly felt growing pains since the end of the Western Russia unification wars. Massively expanded from the ROA's wartime military intelligence apparatus, the task given to its leadership had been to both ensure the creation of a modern intelligence agency able to monitor domestic and foreign threats, and ensure the loyalty of said organization to Bunyachenko and his loyalists.\n\nSome agents had been unfortunately let go. Others had merely been compartmentalized in the foreign intelligence office, where they would hopefully stay away from domestic affairs.\n\nKeeping a strict enough net of surveillance on the population without sinking endless amounts of resources into the security apparatus was a tightrope to walk. Hopefully a rising economy and success in future wars would keep the population happy and the SNB's task simple enough. Only time would tell."

 SAM.73.t: "The Network"
 SAM.73.desc: "Nikolay Valvov had a thousand things on his mind - none of them were the fact that the local chapter of the ROA was now setting up mandatory conscription requirements. Valvov was one of the proud and few smugglers to survive long enough in Russia to have his name known by the now Grand Marshal, Mikhail Oktan. A combination of brutality, shrewd business dealings, and pure luck had propelled Valvov into the position of something resembling a middleman in the western Urals. Regardless, he had been recruited by Oktan some years back - the man paid well in both money and influence. "God only knows how many times the man's bailed me out of tricky situations..." the smuggler muttered to himself as he walked into a nondescript apartment building.\n\nReviewing the evidence that he had in mind and in document, he walked into the local branch of what Oktan called his "Ministry of Truth." All very official, the "ministry", which was as cloak and dagger as Valvov remembered from Oktan, contained only a few employees. After a cursory search for weapons and an explanation of who he was, Valvov sat down and explained what he had seen: He had to pay his way through a local checkpoint after a pair of particularly loud-mouthed ROA soldiers had blocked his way. Irritated by the fee, he noticed that the two of them had been complaining about how "arbitrary" some of Oktan's policies were.\n\nValvov, ever the diligent friend of the Grand Marshal, had done some digging, greased the palms of those who needed to be greased, and he had uncovered a ring of dissenters among some of the newer ROA officers - the ones that had been hurriedly promoted and pressed into service in and around the city of Syktyvkar - who had been planning some sort of mutiny against the more loyal members of Oktan's crew. The local minister, who had never introduced himself, nodded his head knowingly as Valvov disclosed what he had discovered, even going so far as judiciously examining the evidence that the smuggler had compiled for him. After nodding approvingly, the officer opened a drawer and threw a wad of cash on the table. "Thanks for this, we'll take care of it going forward. You're free to go, Mr. Valvov," the man gruffly spoke, "But I'll be keeping these files. Whatever's in that cash is more than enough to cover whatever expenses you had to incur to bring this information to us. Dismissed.""

 SAM.74.t: "The Coming Light"
 SAM.74.desc: "Viktor Naoumov, age fourteen, barely knew formal education. He had been born in the darkest of times, and now, his parents kept saying, "light is coming." He wasn't quite sure what it meant, but what the young boy did know was that the terrible droning of airplanes in the sky and bombs falling were only distant, terrible childhood memories. His family had lived in a relatively large town, and as it was taken by the ROA, it seemed that their rule would be more of the same. Martial law, restrictions on gatherings and what people could do. But as their victory became more assured, it seemed as if their grip on the town slipped. It was a deceptive slipping, of course - as peace returned to Western Russia, Zykov's armed forces helped transition their new state from military to civilian rule. Village and town councils were introduced, and state-run schools with state-issued curricula were opened. Attendance was made mandatory for all children.\n\n"The October Revolution - what do we know about it?" asked the school teacher, whose name Viktor could barely remember. In fact, he couldn't remember when last he had been up this early. Early morning lessons were tough, and made worse by the fact that both his parents, who needed to work long days, would drop him off to the new school early so that they would be able to make it to their jobs on time.\n\nAnother child, one likely more diligent than Viktor answered. "That it overthrew the Tsar?" he asked. "That's not exactly correct, but close. The Tsar was removed before the revolution." It was clear that she was looking for a specific answer. One, much to her chagrin, that wouldn't be granted. After a period of silence, the teacher, with some marked disappointment on her face, imparted the knowledge that she had wanted to hear upon the apparently-hapless schoolchildren.\n\n"The Bolsheviks, using dangerous means and a lot of force, overthrew the republic and instituted a reign of terror." She stated. "They killed many people, on purpose and by accident, with their policies." It was certainly true, but Zykov's mandated curricula was about to come into full effect with what the schoolteacher would say next. "But our current Chairman is working to reverse what they've done. He wants all of us to have a place to live in that is free, and safe from the dangers of communism." She finished, pausing to let that sink in before she went on. "Now, let's look at...""

The brave men of the ROA, drafted by the foreign tyrants, had helped fatally weaken the Western Soviet remnants before liberating all of Western Russia.\n\nOf the future, the teacher spoke only in generalities. The students needed to work hard to keep the Motherland strong and safe. One day, the decaying German's turn would come; just as the Tatars had been driven out of Russia in the end.\n\nThe bell of recess let the kids stream out onto a nearby field, where games of ROA and soviets were played out over and over. A few of the youths, remembering the fate of parents lost in the collapse of the WRRF, did not take part in the games with the same enthusiasm."

That being said, the kids didn't have to actually like going to school. It's true, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for most of them, and would prepare them for the new Russia that Oktan had envisioned. However, truthfully, conditions were terrible, and the curriculum was more than controversial, even for the deplorable state of the Russian educational system.\n\nThe hours in class were almost as long as the hours in a factory, and discipline was harsh. Obedience was taught above all - the teachers were all uniformed and ranked the children based on their performance, engagement, and obedience. What they actually learned was incredibly basic - reading, writing, math... history was the worst. Even the youngest, poorest educated kids knew how trumped-up most of it was. But they dared not speak of it; any mere whisper of dissent could mean a serious beating.\n\nUltimately, the goal of the schools that Oktan and his friends had sponsored was not to educate the populace, but ready them for a greater purpose. Children will be educated in the most minimal and efficient way before they are sent off to either join the army, an officer's college, or a technical school, where they will be put to use by the state for Oktan's image. It wasn't a glorious education, nor was it particularly useful for any of the children, but it gave them the basic tools to survive and thrive in Russia's future."

This hush was not one of anticipation, nor one of death, but instead, for the first time in a long time, one of peace. This peace, however, was not one of a willing populace. The reality of the situation was that, even if the Chairman ruled with a velvet glove, he had seized Russia through the use of an iron fist - a massive one: The ROA. Resistance to his rule was dealt with calmly if possible, but if Zykov's words couldn't pacify his enemies, well, the guns of his loyalists could. Despite the sweeping political and economic reforms that had been instituted, and despite the fact that military rule - martial law - had been lifted from almost all places within the control of the Provisional Commissariat, the streets in the towns and the cities were usually empty and solemn, save for the occasional person hurrying to work, or a patrol of ROA soldiers. In truth, the Russia that Zykov had begun to shape was one of relative freedom - elections, a liberalized economy, apart from the arms manufacturing sector, and a relatively fair judiciary. The reality of his vision paired with the legacy of the forces that he has to work with means that at least for now, the long shadow cast by the armed forces across Western Russia is here to stay.\n\nBut even then, all of that considered, Russia under the Provisional Commissariat is significantly better than it was during the terror bombings and the interlude before its unification. There was peace, and there was bread. There were jobs, and there were measures against bandits. While the peace was secured through arms, and those arms were very present in seemingly all throughout the commissariat, peace reigns. For now. These thoughts, always on the mind of the enigmatic Chairman, swirled throughout his brain, causing him to wonder what the next step was - stability now, but for what, if there Russia remained disunited?"

Now the analyst's hosts drove him around massive housing complexes growing, steel bones awaiting concrete. These new housing units, his hosts told him, would house workers moving to the capital. Freed from the clutches of the WRRF, these men and women could find gainful employment in the burgeoning Russian economy. In the distance, vast industrial complexes taken from the dying WRRF were being set back up by private interests.\n\nFor now, the poor men and women in question huddled in refugee camps. The hastily built shacks were clean and well organized. There were no beggars on the street; the driver assured the analyst that everyone in Russia worked, and those who couldn't work were protected by the state. Their car stopped at an intersection where a smartly dressed soldier verified the vehicle's papers, his modern assault rifle slung on his shoulder. At a nearby corner, the analyst could see a tram letting go of its cargo of clerks and professionals. West Russia's burgeoning commercial empires were nourished by a steady stream of mandarins.

An educational system not seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union has already begun to churn out ready conscripts for our technical schools and army units, courts have been set up to dispense the justice that people deserve.\n\nFor now, a quiet hush has fallen upon Western Russia - the streets of cities lay quiet, no news is reported by the villages or the ROA patrols. Compared to the radical, feverish pace at which the nation was united and then administered following Oktan's conquest, a feeling of peace, if not stability, has begun to return to the land. The Grand Marshal and his companions, however, have locked themselves in an ivory tower, distant from the people that they've liberated from the tyranny of Bolshevism and anarchism, seemingly reluctant to appear to the populace.

There was the old Third Republic with its President and its Prime Minister, one being the head of state and the other who wrangled the government. Of all these choices, none expected Zykov to take the one he did. Zykov walked the balance between ideal and practicality as he balanced the military's tendency towards reaction with the dream of a government by the people, for the people. And in that walk, Zykov chose to take what was good from what the Committee knew of other nations and blend it all together. Russia would have a head of state, who was commander in chief. A symbol, a leader for the military, a theoretical power with a grand potential never to be tapped. Yet there would be the actual governance of the state, the executive to be run by the elected government and which would, eventually, have the faith and loyalty of the army.\n\nIn time things would stabilize, but until then there would be a compromise.

For the Chairman the one great thing is reliability, the actions of governance requiring that above all else. For now, the running of day to day governance is to be through those reliable, relatively non-corrupt networks already existing, through the military or through agencies staffed by former soldiers and those loyal to the Chairman.\n\nYet it was asked, what of the voices of the civilians?

With a full belly and more activity than he'd showed the last two times the committee had met (which to be fair had been about executive power to run the trains), Oktan sat down with five military men and three civilians to get a better system in place for the executive.\n\n"So now that we're going to get shit done, let's do it." A smile and a few jokes about food and waistlines drew smiles, and Oktan shuffled papers about until he got the one he wanted.

The way I see it, if you want to get things done, you need to make it possible."

Strikes had slowed the project down by a month or so, but strike-breakers paid with government bills had shown the rabble that the new provisional government would not tolerate such communist nonsense anymore.\n\nHe read through the document, finally signing his name on the final page to acknowledge that he had received it. He tapped his pen against his teeth in contemplation, the little silver end clacking against the white of his mouth. Economics, science, and state had begun to slowly twist and curl together ever since the appointment of Leonid Samutin to the position of economic minister in Zykov's cabinet. It was a far cry from the handful of factories and home mills that had sustained Samara before unifying Western Siberia, an economic miracle unrivaled in the post-Soviet world.\n\nLeonid smiled to himself. Though the work quickly piled up, it was a measure of his success as minister.

Subsequently, they have announced the immediate cessation of any and all relations, interactions, or contact of any kind between themselves and the Reich to anyone who will listen.\n\nThe ROA, formerly under the leadership of Andrey Vlasov, proved itself valuable both during Operation Barbarossa and in the West Russian War, and contact between the Reich and cliques within their military-led government have proven beneficial in the years since. Clearly, however, the internal political balance has shifted, towards a faction unfriendly to our interests and non-receptive to our support.\n\nThe announcement, both in general and in terms of response, has been given a low priority by both the Foreign Ministry and the OKW. The situation in Russia remains mostly unclear, with the nominal political consolidation of various territories, including those of the ROA, significantly undermined by administrative overextension, insurgent efforts by escaped loyalists of defeated regimes, and other internal tensions.\n\nMilitarily, they are expected to pose no threat to Wehrmacht forces should a limited or escalated conflict begin.

 SAM.96.desc: "FIELD MARSHAL'S EYES ONLY\n\nTo Field Marshal Bunyachenko,\n\nABSTRACT: The Committee for the revitalization of controlled territories has found that while economically it can be of much use, the destruction and lack of economic planning has made the use of such resources unavailable to our use. Thus some elements of economic planning are proposed to 'jump start' the economy for the purposes of beginning the long awaited reunification of Russia.\n\nREPORT SUMMARY: It has been found that a significant amount of factories have been destroyed from either raids from opposing warlords, or due to German terror bombings. What few remain suffer from a lack of manpower. Similar outcomes occur in construction and extraction industries. In spite of this, the unemployment rate is high, especially in urban areas. This has caused suffering among families, who rely on charity to get by. For full analysis, see pages 20 through 54 of this report.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: To use government powers to enforce an end to unemployment, through a combination of government assistance, relocation of the unemployed towards areas and industries where needed most, and, when no other option is available, conscription into the armed forces. While this would expand government powers into the economy thus unseen, it would make it (a) more viable and attractive to do business and (b) increase productivity of the average citizen through additional wages.

 SAM.97.desc: "FIELD MARSHAL'S EYES ONLY\n\nTo Field Marshal Bunyachenko,\n\nABSTRACT: The post industrial atmosphere of Samara and other controlled territories by the Committee's economic revitalization plan has seen a significant positive increase. Economic and industrial resources are now towards peak economic performance due to the increase in both employment and rebuilding of previously destroyed equipment.\n\nREPORT SUMMARY: With the institution of minimal government planning, specifically of enforcing employment of citizens through incentives and punishments, economic output has increased many times over. Poverty has decreased, unemployment is nearly non-existent, and for the first time in years new factories are being created throughout the country. The unemployment program has even been so successful that juveniles (13-17 being the majority) makeup a significant portion of the workforce, although by no means a majority. While far from done, the program has made much progress in revitalizing the economy, which has benefited military production in domestic firearms, making unification a more likely outcome. See pages 18 through 30 for full report.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Aside from continuing the program, it is recommended that additional resources be made available to increase business opportunity. With additional economic incentives, the Committee believes that the economy would expand greatly, simultaneously decreasing poverty and also increasing our military objectives."

"Well, sir, I just fear that it will just repeat the problems that have plagued Russia."\n\nOktan smiled a little bigger. "That is reasonable, but you're thinking about outcomes that may occur, when I am thinking of the real benefits this plan will give to the people."\n\nThe secretary didn't dare contradict him, letting him continue his monologue.\n\n"Warlords only have loyalty to themselves, while my officers are loyal to me. They are competent, and will have full knowledge of the circumstances under which they are governing. Think of them as...Governors."\n\n"Governors?"\n\n"Exactly," Oktan said, pleased that he was able to think of that word in time. "They will redistribute resources and conscript men according to the needs of their circumstances. Of course, they will do what I say, but when it comes to their jurisdictions, it is their problem."\n\nHis secretary did not say anything.\n\n"Satisfied? Now please, make the men aware of their new terms as Governors.""

The plan has been a success, more or less.\n\nIt was hard to argue with the results. The quotas have been met, sometimes even exceeding them. The taxes were coming in, making Oktan and his soldiers lives much more comfortable. And not to mention the benefits at keeping rivals out of his hair. A little redistricting here, a missed shipment here, a gun shipment to the opposition here... so many opportunities!\n\nAnd his allies, well, they would remember who put them where they were, who gave them the wealth, land and whores. Who holds them up, and who could let them drop. Fealty must be sworn to those above you. Oktan had done that for years, and was more than willing to enjoy being on the other end of that relationship for once.\n\nHe took another drag, and let his eyelids rest.

Until Zhilenkov suddenly shouted at the driver to stop. Hastily exiting the car, to the consternation of his bodyguards in the other vehicles, he strode over to the wall, where a poster he and Malyshkin had collaborated to create was hanging.\n\nHanging defaced - the words 'Down with the Traitors!' splashed across it in bright red ink and obscuring the message behind.\n\nJoined by Malyshkin a moment later, and with their bodyguards quickly establishing a perimeter, they inspected the poster. Exchanging a knowing look, and with a wordless nod from the other man, Zhilenkov quickly tore it down, aware of how fortunate it was that they, and not others within the ROA's high command, had seen it first. His relief was short-lived, however, as Malyshkin tapped his shoulder and pointed across the street.\n\nAnother copy of the poster. Defaced. With more of them down the street disfigured similarly. Every single one, in fact. Malyshkin began furiously speaking of how they would need to summon soldiers immediately to remove them, but Zhilenkov barely heard him.\n\nHe was too busy looking at the people, who had retreated a respectable distance from their ROA bodyguards but who still watched them closely. And that brought him nothing but worry.\n\nBecause if the people were brave enough to vandalize the ROA's posters in such numbers and public fashion, what else were they brave enough to do?"

It was time, then, for his meeting with that man. "Come in," he told the visitor reluctantly.\n\nIn walked Dmitry Zakutnyy, that infuriatingly smug smirk of his still present on his face. "I've come to give my advice on the development of industry, sir." God, Vlasov wished he could wipe that smirk off his face, just once. Unfortunately, he had ties with Oktan, though Vlasov doubted even that man held any love for Zakutnyy. Nobody did. They'd all defected, of course, but Zakutnyy had joined their side without hesitation. Eagerly, even, and without an ounce of his reason for it being ideological. He just thought himself too good for a POW camp. A true coward among an army of cowards.\n\n"Yes, continue," Vlasov finally said. As Zakutnyy discussed his plans for the development of defenses against German bombings and increased armament production, Vlasov barely listened, knowing his approval or disapproval of the plan mattered little in the grand scheme of things.\n\nHowever, when Zakutnyy began speaking on how it was only natural that such a great plan was devised by a brilliant mind such as his own, Vlasov couldn't stop himself from slamming his fist down on the desk and standing up, shooting a seething glare towards Zakutnyy causing the man to take a couple steps back. "You-" Almost as quickly as he had given in to his irritation, Vlasov cooled down. Shouting at Zakutnyy wouldn't change anything except maybe for the worse. He had to keep his cool; it was the only thing of real value he still had left. "... Sorry. Please leave me be for the day, Zakutnyy." With a hurried apology and thanks, Zakutnyy nearly ran out of the room, shutting the door behind him. Sitting down again in his seat, Vlasov let out another long sigh."

Even the presence of trusted men such as the village's priest did not inspire much confidence.\n\nEventually a first test of the new legal structure presented itself. A young man had allegedly been found rummaging through a neighbor's pantry, and had taken a bullet in the back for his trouble. The youth had survived, and his family were now accusing their neighbors of attempted murder. The accused had asked the tribunal's help, as few believed his side of the story. Better risk the military's justice than wait out a lynching.\n\nThe military officer acting as judge did a commendable job of patiently taking on both sides of the story. The jury of four soldiers and five civilians then adjusted for deliberations. A non-guilty verdict for the accused was reached. The judge then imposed on the man a few weeks of community service, as well as a fine meant to pay for the care of the injured youth.\n\nAll across Samara, a range of issues began having their day in court. From criminal cases to perfectly mundane administrative topics, agreements and rulings were handed out. Grudgingly, the civilians came to trust the military's willingness to collaborate with them for the sake of law and order."

 SAM.301.t: "The Democratic Successor"
 SAM.301.desc: "Miletiy Alexandrovich Zykov. The name bounced around the aide's head. Vlasov had been long silent about a potential political successor for him in the case of his death or incapacitation. However, it was obvious to everyone who was anyone in the ROA that the Chairman wasn't getting any younger. But Zykov? Certainly an unorthodox choice. Vlasov had convened an emergency meeting of all of his aides nearly half an hour ago to make a preliminary announcement to them. But the announcement had turned into a discussion - the move was shocking to a number of the more conservative aides, who thought that the transition to Zykov would be a disaster.\n\nTruthfully, Vlasov was an alright boss. An aide never had to fear reprisals for small mistakes, like they did under many other senior officers. All were free to express their opinions there, so long as they were respectful. Luchenko, one of the aide's peers, voiced his. "Zykov's gone as far as proposing the reinstitution of democracy, but the people know nothing of democracy. Most don't care. Will they even understand what that would mean? I worry that all we have worked to build will devolve into the chaos that we've heard is going on in Syktyvkar." The field marshal retorted in a tired but firm tone. "Zykov may want democracy, Luchenko, but have we not been working towards a free Russia? What Russia is free but does not allow the people freedom?"\n\nThere was silence for a bit. Another aide, one of Luchenko's good friends, finally spoke up. "But, and if I may, there are some doubts that some of the staff have about Zykov's true intentions. Even if he were to... assume power... after you..." The aide seemed to stumble. "Some worry that he doesn't even believe in democracy, and will attempt to use it as a personal power tool." Vlasov grimaced briefly. It was clear that it had been a thought that had crossed his mind. "His true intentions may be ambiguous. That may be true, but it never leaves this room. Even if he was not to restore democracy, I believe in his ability to restore hope. And right now? That's what we need most. We need to give the Russian people hope."\n\nThere was a pause. Vlasov was far from a talented orator, but all were aware of the poor opinion of their organization with most of the subjects they ruled - Zykov had always been a propagandist. "Dismissed." Vlasov barked."

 SAM.302.desc: "Andrey Sidorov, long-time aide to the long-suffering Vlasov, was called into his office alongside approximately a dozen other of his peers, from aides to administrative assistants, all of those who were relevant to Vlasov's immediate life. A few chairs had been scattered around, but most had to stand. Vlasov himself was behind his oaken desk, the entire barren room brightly framed by the large window immediately behind him. The old Chairman took a cursory glance outside before turning towards Sidorov and the rest of the crowd. "It's no secret that there's been some consternation about the matter of our movement's leadership after I am gone." It was a plain statement, and one that was definitely true. Aides like Sidorov would spend whole meals discussing the matter as if they were adolescents discussing romantic interests. "I have taken a significant amount of time to think about the matter, and I have decided that I will be nominating Sergey Bunyachenko as the next in line for Chairman of our committee." Most of the aides nodded. After all, Bunyachenko was a sensible choice. He was popular with most of the officers and generally avoided shady dealings that some of his peers gleefully engaged in. One of the aides, however, a "friend" of Mikhail Oktan's, piped up. "But why Bunyachenko? I don't get it." A pensive look flashed over Vlasov's face for a minute, before he responded. "Good question", he started, looking directly into the aide's eyes, knowingly. "The ROA is filled with rot - corruption, bribery, nepotism, anything that you can name. I'm no fool, I know it exists. Bunyachenko is a strong, honest man and an honorable general. I know that he will be both a good compromise candidate between our ideologically passionate peers and those who are less so. And I also know that he will work to expose and purge the rot from our organization, forcefully if need be. For if we are to rule all Russia, we need a man and an organization that is free from corruption and interested enough in crushing our enemies to not put his own interests above our ultimate goals. And ultimately..." Vlasov's voice broke before he continued. "I believe he is the only person who can succeed where I have been unable to." The question was not followed up with another - Vlasov solemnly dismissed the aides and instructed them to inform those necessary."

Whatever the meeting was about, thought Andrey Sidorov, one of his key aides, it was serious. Sidorov had been with Vlasov for half a decade, and had witnessed the slide of the once-proud general into what Sidorov believed to be depression, but even he was not prepared for the announcement that Vlasov was prepared to make. After the dozen or so KONR and ROA officers and various aides had taken their seats in chairs that had been hastily brought in by those not privy to the meeting, Vlasov had stood up, and addressed his "crowd." "We are all aware," he began, "that there is the matter of succession within our movement. It has been a matter of contention for some time that when it is time for me to hand off the torch, who would be the one to receive it." There was a pause - a reluctant, grimacing pause, before he continued. "And as such, I have decided that General Mikhail Oktan will be the one to bear the burden of succession." Almost immediately after the name was mentioned, the room began to erupt into discord. Sidorov himself was baffled; Oktan? Even among his allies, Oktan had a reputation for corruption and administrative negligence. He was a decent officer, a sight better than the "cadets" who "volunteered", but nothing special, and he was no friend of Vlasov. Vlasov's voice suddenly boomed throughout the room, a single command - "Silence!" It was obeyed. "Oktan already owns half of the Russian Liberation Army. He attracts those damned opportunists and lackeys, bribing those who can be bought and sidelining those who can't." Vlasov continued to calmly explain his decision. "But if it is anyone but Oktan succeeds me, I worry for the continued existence of our movement. Even if I were to choose someone else, we cannot afford a civil war, and surely Oktan would act against anyone who seeks to exert more control over him than I currently have. This is for the best of the Committee, and the best for the Russian Liberation Army. My decision is final. Prepare to relay it to those who need to know. Dismissed!"\n\nThere is a long, dark night falling upon Russia, and neither the brightest of moons nor stars will be able to penetrate the blackness projected by the Chairman's last decision."

It did not matter to Semyon, so long as they didn't try anything funny.\n\n"Hey! Semyon! Semyon, over here!" Semyon turned to face the source of the voice, and an eyebrow rose in annoyed surprise at the familiar face running towards him. "Ah, General Bunyachenko ordered that no soldier patrol alone for the time being. One of our own got badly beaten by dissidents. I volunteered to join you, seeing as we're old friends," Fyodor explained, having no way of knowing their friendship was not mutual. As they began to walk together despite Semyon's reluctance, Fyodor's latest topic of conversation caught Semyon's interest for once. "...by the way, Semyon, I've been thinking about this for a while, but don't you think it's weird? Bunyachenko's a Ukrainian, yet he's prominent over here instead."\n\nFrowning, Semyon scratched his chin in confusion. "What's so odd about a Ukrainian in Russia?"\n\n"It's not just him," Fyodor quickly assured him. "Old man Kromiadi's a Greek, from down in the Caucasus, and Bayerski is a genuine Pole." Fyodor's voice began to grow hushed. "Nobody really knows anything about Oktan, either, and there are all kinds of rumors swirling about. The most common seem to be that he's a Croat, or a Serb, something like that, and the son of a Balkan baron. And then there's Zykov, who admits he's a Ukranian, and nothing else. I've heard a few rumors that he's a Jew, but-" before he could get anything else out, Fyodor found his mouth covered by Semyon's hand. It'd be a lie to say that he liked the annoying gossip at all, but just hearing something like that could place people in danger.\n\n"Fyodor, perhaps it'd be wisest if we moved on to another topic of conversation." With a withering glare from Semyon, the rest of the patrol was conducted in silence."

 # the monthly shipment
 SAM.305.t: "The Monthly Shipment"
 SAM.305.desc: "One of the oddest phenomena in the territory controlled by the ROA was a small train station about an hour's march from the city of Samara. Previously a small stop from West Russia to the city, the station's real name had long been replaced by another. The Contraband Station, as it was now known, was one of the last stops for German smugglers - RK Moskowien garrison members who were paid too little to justify the risks they took. These smugglers, who brought with them just about anything a Russian soldier could dream of, made lucrative deals with the local garrisons to sell them things from tobacco and tea to chocolate and small mementos. Any luxury products that managed to trickle their way down into German-occupied Russia were made available to the ROA soldiers. It was one of the largest benefits to signing on with the ROA - simply put. Their old 'contacts' with the Germans had allowed them to afford a few more luxuries than their ideological rivals.\n\nAs both German and Russian worked to offload the goods from the train, they chatted with one another in broken fragments of their respective tongues, each side having made clear efforts to learn the other's language. One of the Russians asked a German about his family;\n\n"I don't know, honestly," he responded. "They're back in Prussia. I've heard that there's not much in the way of work, but other than that, there's been no word." The German, wanting to be courteous, responded in kind. "What about here? What's life like in Samara?" The Russian chuckled a little bit.\n\n"I wouldn't know. I haven't seen the city in weeks, this is my first time being remotely close to it. Border patrols, skirmishes with bandits. I'm sure you're familiar."\n\nContraband Station was an incredibly strange site for cultural intermingling. The Russian soldiers didn't like their German counterparts who supplied the contraband, and they were confident that the Germans felt the same about them. And yet, the Russians attempted to learn German, and the Germans tried their hand at Russian. Everyone knew each other's names, food was shared, and jokes were made even if the language barrier impeded communication at times. Ultimately, both sides were a part of each other's lives, and both accepted that fact, even if they didn't like those that the fact was made up of."

 SAM.306.t: "The Iron Harvest"
 SAM.306.desc: ""Harvest Days" was what they were called around these parts. ROA soldiers would descend upon the town in their full battle dress, and proceed to help the local farmers with their harvest, providing the valuable manpower that their fields needed especially since so many of their sons had been conscripted or killed. When the harvest days had first been put in place, there was little trust or goodwill between the soldiers and the villagers, especially considering one of the reasons the soldiers helped out with the harvests was to take some of the food back with them. But as the harvest days became more regular, and the village became more acclimatized to the presence of the ROA they began to see them not as German collaborators, but as protectors. The atmosphere changed, trust was built between civilian and soldier. Eventually, some members of the ROA even began volunteering for the harvest days - usually conscripts who had a background in agriculture - hoping to be assigned to one. With some of the friendliest villages even offering to feed the soldiers during the day, it was a relatively comfortable assignment compared to border patrols or anti-bandit operations.\n\nWhile the Committee for the Liberation of the Russian People was far from popular, they had been working hard to secure their regime, distance themselves from the Germans, and even improve their relations with those that they ruled over. These harvests were a key part of that, and contributed to the image that the ROA was there to help, not hurt; to a large extent, it seemed that it was working. No one liked taxes, especially when they were being extracted in the form of food, and oftentimes after the harvests many of the farmers would stare jealously at the ROA's trucks as they pulled away from their village, wishing they had been able to keep more of the food they had grown. However, on the whole, it was a positive experience. The soldiers had even been effective in getting a few of the local boys and restless farmhands to sign up with the ROA, which further helped dissipate tensions with the locals. Most of the core of the ROA had no local ties to the area around Samara, and having patrols protect those that they knew was a huge boon for the KONR's propaganda machine."

In the off season where the constant small-time raids and warfare of the Russian Anarchy simmered down, men could be seen discussing with fellow soldiers from across the border.\n\nSo it came that a few riflemen of the Russian Liberation Army came to drink in a small village of a contested area. When men of the Imperial Army entered, there was a momentary tension. That too died down as the Vlasovites offered a round of drinks to the Imperials.\n\nTalks ebbed and flowed on a range of topic. A particularly violent group of bandits that both groups of soldiers had fought with (the bastards). The recent weather (mostly bad). The news from beyond the Urals (very confused). Eventually the topic moved to the WRRF. A few of the veterans of both groups had fought in the fifties. After comisserating on the shame of fighting fellow Russians to defeat the reds, the soldiers shared war stories back and forth. A few more rounds were shared. This casual conversation marked the high point of the evening's mood. Eventually a bitter dispute erupted as to the legitimacy of the ROA. Had it not begun as a German militia, dogs for the invaders? The ROA veteran snapped back that the tsar had been invited by the Germans, and that the white soldiers should not talk about serving tyrants, foreign or domestic.\n\nThe barman did not speak. Business was good for now. When these idiots started fighting again, the bar might have to move once more. Such was life in the Russian Anarchy."

The commander of the local garrison, Major Popov, noted that the time was 12:32, well past the time that the strike should have dispersed. He radioed his troops who were observing the situation over at the factories - ROA troops frequently mediated between employers and employees, especially during tense situations like this one. He asked a simple question - "Have they dispersed?" The answer Popov got was not the one that he was hoping for. "The strikers won't give up", the voice on the other end of the radio responded. "Worse still, there's some rumors among the workers still here and their managers that the strike was actually orchestrated by communist agents, 'plants', as they call them. Things are getting pretty tense, people are throwing things." What came after that was what really worried Major Popov. "Some of the greener troops... I think they're unnerved. If things go south, they might start shooting."\n\nPopov cursed to himself. The damned strikers. It was the third time in three months that this had happened, and each time, it was up to the ROA to sort things out. How many times would he have to deal with this before he made his superiors understand that he, and those he commanded, were soldiers, not policemen? Regardless, Popov had to make a choice - he could send in his troops to disperse the strikers, and potentially kill or weed out the apparent communist plants. Surely, this would calm things down and set a precedent to the ungrateful strikers that their insubordination would not be tolerated. It might make us unpopular in the short run but it would also ensure the stability in our streets, for workers will surely be reluctant to complain if it meant being on the wrong end of the barrel of a gun. However, Popov would have the lives of those workers on his hands. Similarly, if he refused to send in the army, the workers would be happy, and alive of course, but business interests would feel betrayed. It wasn't an easy call by any means, but Popov knew that he would have to make it - it would be a PR disaster if his recruits lost their cool and fired into the crowds."

 SAM.309.desc: "The Russian Liberation Army was nothing if not pervasive in their efforts to patrol the territory that they controlled - and that they did. Daily patrols went out, came back in, checkpoints along the roads and troops stationed throughout the hinterland of their territory ensured that the Officers, and ultimately Vlasov himself, knew what was going on. As a result, it didn't take long for news of an envoy from the east to arrive at a local garrison station. The ROA was consistently weary about outsiders and strangers, to the point where a diplomat from beyond the Urals instantly kicked up suspicion. Maksim Oliynyk, the officer in charge of the garrison station that the envoy had been escorted to didn't particularly want to meet the man - in fact, he was suspicious that the man was who he claimed he was.\n\nSitting down with the envoy, it was clear that he was frustrated. Protesting his being whisked away to the garrison, rather than Samara itself. Oliynyk sat down with the man, looking at him up and down. "Who are you?" he asked, "And why have my caravan and I been stolen away here? I am bound for Samara."\n\nThe commander took a pause before he responded. "For all that matters to you, I am Samara. Now, tell me, who are you?"\n\nSome further protests were given, but the envoy soon realized that he wasn't getting anywhere. He relinquished, and eventually introduced himself as a diplomat hailing from Novosibirsk, beyond the Urals. The meeting became closer to an interrogation, with Oliynyk learning about the events that were going on in the east. The envoy, after the questioning was over, attempted to offer to trade with the ROA. Oliynyk's polite, but cold "no, thank you" dissuaded him, and he left back to Novosibirsk soon after."

 SAM.310.desc: "Armaments Factory no.14 was a small complex near the Samara railyards. "Repurposed" by the ROA itself during the darkest days of the terror bombing, the small shack was soon built up. The "factory" - in reality little more than a large building with a few long, wooden tables and a number of machine tools - was dedicated to taking apart German small arms and reverse engineering them for our own purposes. Vlasov and most of those under him knew well that their German support would eventually run out, and they had long made provisions to ensure that their myriad of German equipment, from Kar98Ks to StG-44s would remain operable even once it was no longer possible to receive their parts from their former benefactors neither officially nor through smugglers.\n\nThe factory rarely worked during the day - the bombings made it hard to - but workers toiled all night, with small headlamps and minimal light, disassembling old or well-worn rifles and their respective ammunitions. These workers, despite their rugged condition, were not civilians. Not officially, at least. They were engineers, not just employees of the ROA, but members of it and experienced in handling German weapons for many years. Until recently, the factory had been minimally staffed.\n\nHowever, with the increasing amount of bloody victories won by the ROA, the soldiers at the frontline needed more and more weapons, and the number of those that we can get from German smugglers is becoming miniscule compared to our needs. As such, Armaments Factory no.14 has, as of recently, expanded not only in terms of manpower, but location as well. A number of shoddily-constructed buildings have been added to the original to form a sort of complex, where dedicated stations and senior engineers act as efficiency-generating machines. As of late the factory was no longer just reverse-engineering weapons, but producing their own versions of them. Certainly not with the workmanship of the originals, they were cheap and easy to produce, and that's what the high command wanted."

He had intentionally ordered the removal of most luxuries from his office and his living quarters two years prior, in a vain attempt to stave off his ever-present guilt. The old marshal stood, looking out the window, a drink in hand. He couldn't remember the time, all he knew was that it was dark out. Midnight, maybe? 1? 2? Who cared. The night was the only time that Vlasov could be alone.\n\nEvery waking hour of the day he had aides, officers, and administrators asking him the most mundane of questions, but lately he had become disinterested in answering them, instead preoccupying himself with a reflection on his life's work. What was it, if not the Committee? And what had they accomplished? At what cost? These were the questions that resounded in Vlasov's head day and night.\n\n"And for the life of me, I can't figure out the answers." he mumbled to himself. He couldn't even remember if his alliance with the Nazis was one of pragmatic survival or the desire to see a Russia forged in his image. He barely had an image anymore. He continued to pace around his room, occasionally glancing up to the stoic portrait of himself that his aides insisted he keep in his office. A single word came to his mind: legacy. What was to be his legacy? Vlasov had always thought about writing a book. After all, who else would tell his story the way that it should be told? "The Germans remember me as a traitor, the Russians remember me as worse. Those in the West barely even know who I am." He stated to no one in particular. Realistically, no book would be coming. Vlasov knew he couldn't.\n\nAfter pacing some more, he sat, slumped in his desk chair, looking at his drink. It had become harder to resist the urges to refill the glass over and over with the premium vodka he had "liberated" for himself. He looked to his glass - it was now empty. When did he drink it? He couldn't remember. Glancing towards his desk, there were two items that came to his attention - the bottle and his service pistol. A brief idea crossed his mind, but common sense got the better of him. He decided to retire for the night, after a long, deep sigh."

 SAM.312.t: "The Will of the People"
 SAM.312.desc: "Outside of a small village about two and a half hour's drive from the city of Samara lay, in a pile, roughly thirty dead bodies. Well over half of them were wearing the ROA's uniform, the other dead were clearly partisans. The confrontation between the partisans and the local patrol had taken place when a routine inspection of the village led to the discovery of weapons caches, partisans hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe firefight that ensued saw all of the partisans killed, but most of the patrol as well. The dead ROA, which featured kids as young as sixteen, was sorted into one pile, with another, far more uncouth, for the dead partisans, mostly young men and women. Vlasov, who was shocked to hear that there was such a coherent piece of communist resistance so close to the capital, drove out himself to see the aftermath.\n\nAccompanied by two of his bodyguards, he examined the carnage after personally ordering the surviving patrol members to not exact revenge on the surviving villagers. One of the bodyguards, Belochkin, was a personal confidant of the old general. He could tell that for the first time in a long time, Vlasov was filled with emotion - and none of it was good. His mouth formed into a tight-lipped grimace as he walked through the village. An explosion of anger eventually brought the usually laconic general into a yelling fit, shouting at the pile of dead partisans.\n\n"Who are you to think that you could do what you tried to do?" he asked and then paused. Was he waiting for a response? "I have worked years - no, decades - to bring about a Russia free from communism, free from tyranny. And all you people who so stubbornly resist my efforts, indoctrinated by the bastards I beat years ago, you waste the lives of brave, young men who fight my good fight!"\n\nBelochkin was stunned. He looked around, villager and soldier alike froze, observing the marshal's outburst. Glancing towards his fellow bodyguard, he slowly approached Vlasov, who had since fallen silent. Careful not to touch him, Belochkin quietly whispered in his ear.\n\n"Perhaps, my Chairman, it is time for us to go. I'm sure you're needed back in Samara."\n\nVlasov weakly agreed; the drive back to the capital was a very quiet one."
 SAM.312.a: "A last bit of passion from the tired, old man?"

 SAM.400.t: "Lack of Officers"
 SAM.400.desc: "Any successful army requires a great deal of officers. Only, the recent years in Samara have seen our junior officers grow not so junior. The men that fought in the West Russian War, the former Red Army PoWs, opportunist whites and fascist émigrés have now spent most of a decade with us holed up in Samara. Years of promotion, attrition and desertion have unbalanced our officer pool, especially at the junior level. Our army is now dangerously top heavy, and needs new blood to fill out its command structure.\n\nFortunately, local recruits form a satisfactory pool of potential officers. The only issue is that the years of sitting around have begun polarizing the soldiers into three different groups. Some of the more idealistic recruits follow Zykov's faction, and argue that the ROA should live up to its promises of liberation and democracy. In contrast, a group of black market smugglers and hardline fascists have coalesced around General Oktan's promises of a strong Russia where the soldiers are fully respected. In between these two hands, the Officer Committee tries to maintain the status quo by recruiting dutiful and apolitical men who share General Bunyachenko's apathy and desire to see the junta's structure endure until the situation has changed.\n\nThe composition of officers we choose will help determine the direction the ROA takes. It would be wise to be prudent in our selection of the ROA's next generation."
 SAM.400.a: "Time to make decisions about this."

 SAM.401.t: "Oktan Coups Bunyachenko"
 SAM.401.desc: "Sergey Bunyachenko sat in his office, flanked by a pair of his oldest friends - Arkady Popov and Alexey Antonov - who he had fought through most of the West Russian War with and had known for even longer. The pair were both prominent members of the Russian Liberation Army's Officer Committee that Bunyachenko chaired, and despite Oktan's increasingly frequent claims that he should be Chairman, had both remained at his side despite the former's attempts at curbing or buying the Committee's power.\n\nBoth were oddly silent this morning, however, as Bunyachenko attempted to brainstorm ways to counter Oktan's influence. "It spreads like a cancer, Arkady..." he said, frustrated with his inability to stop the cretin. "He buys who he buys, and it seems like nowadays everyone has their price." The usually-loquacious Popov seemed dismal, while Antonov, ever the deadpan figure, remained steel-faced. "Well?" asked Bunyachenko. "What do we do now?"\n\nPopov nervously checked his watch, and was about to answer when a sharp rap at the door interrupted him. Before Bunyachenko could even ask who was interrupting him, four of his personal guards entered, their weapons drawn. Rising from his desk, Bunyachenko asked, "What is going on?" a tone of suspicion was confirmed as he looked to Popov and Antonov, who had since stood up and drawn their sidearms.\n\n"Sergey Bunyachenko," Antonov started, "The Officer Committee has placed you under arrest following an investigation into corruption and nepotism charges. We have reviewed the case and have sentenced you to death. Please don't make this harder than it already is." As he was marched out of his office by his two former friends, he asked, "How much did Oktan offer you?""

 SAM.402.t: "The Night of Sorrow - Chaos"
 SAM.402.desc: "It was a cold evening in the city of Samara, unseasonably so, and Chairman Bunyachenko was ready to retire for the night. It had been a long day and the aftermath of Chairman Vlasov's death had only made his days longer. Vlasov had been their leader since the beginning and there had never been a transfer of power until now. The Committee was untested, raw. Bunyachenko signaled to his bodyguards that he was ready to leave the office, but before they could go more than a step the doors burst open. A squad of ROA regulars was the first through the door, followed by three men, Oktan's dogs. He would know their stench anywhere. "What is the meaning of this!?" Bunyachenko demanded. The man at the head of the conspirators smiled cruelly.\n\n"Chairman Bunyachenko, in the name of Vlasov's true heir, you are under arrest for treason against the Russian people. Come quietly, and you may yet die with dignity," the dog had the audacity to look magnanimous. However, instead of the panic that they had hoped to inspire in the Chairman, they saw only resolve.\n\n"Men, arrest these fools and you shall be pardoned for your part in their little game," he ordered. The regular soldiers that had barged into the office looked at each other, unsure. "This is your last chance, men, don't do anything you'll regret." Finally, they reacted. The sergeant at the head of the squad turned and smashed his rifle against Oktan's man's head, he crumpled to the ground with a groan. With the spell broken, the soldiers rounded up the other two and bound them with the rope meant for Bunyachenko's own hands. "Get this filth out of my office," he turned and sat back down at his desk, it would be a long night."
 SAM.402.a: "Oktan will be brought to justice for this."

Signaling his bodyguards to be on alert, he took his old sidearm out of the drawer of his desk and prepared himself. It was obvious that Oktan was planning something, the spider was always planning something, but he didn't expect him to be so bold.\n\nBunyachenko signaled his guards again, and they began to move for the emergency exit. However, before they could get far, a group of men burst through the door. They were a squad of ROA regulars led by a group of civilian administrators. The man at their front spoke quickly, "Chairman Bunyachenko, you are under arrest for actions against the people of Russia. Please, take a seat." Before he could so much as twitch, he had been disarmed by his own bodyguards, the traitors, and tied to his desk chair.\n\nThe conspirator made to speak again, but before he could yet another group burst into his office, this time through the front door. Once again, a squad of ROA regulars was being led into his office, but this time it was one of Oktan's lackeys at their head. Before they even attempted to make demands the civilians fled and a fight began in the close confines of the office. Try as he might, Bunyachenko could not loose the bonds around him and he knew that whoever won this fight would have him at their mercy."

As he descended through the chaos left in the wake of Oktan's men, he rallied some loyal officers and troops. With their help, the conspirators were rounded up or killed, and calm descended once again on Samara. The coming days would be trying, the traitors would need to be destroyed root and stem, but for now, he had peace."

 SAM.405.t: "Zykov Coups Bunyachenko"
 SAM.405.desc: ""For are we all not brothers, struggling together for unification? Have we not fought, shoulder to shoulder, side by side, in the trenches for years? If we lay down our guns now, our movement will be saved and no one will be hurt. Our enemies won't be able to take advantage of the internal divisions that they have been encouraging for months. Remember, struggle not against your family, but against those who threaten it!"\n\nToday, Zykov took to the air to announce the end of the mutinies and to encourage those still in arms to give up, offering amnesty to all those who were not involved in instigating the mutiny. The path to end the mutiny and prevent an all-out explosion of the ROA into civil war was engineered masterfully by the veteran propagandist, who seemed to exhibit perfectly the tenets that Macchiavelli wrote about centuries ago. Zykov had bribed those who could be bought, talked down those who could be talked, and threatened violence upon those who would do neither. The combination worked, if just barely. Armed confrontation was reserved to a few hardcore mutineers, who utterly refused surrender. All of these facts, and the immense amount of relief given by them, was swirling around the heads of the committee, which Zykov stood in front of. The enigmatic orator had already given a cursory briefing to the committee about the situation, and the fallout. However, his coup-de-grace was yet to come. "As I'm sure all of you are aware, it was the perfidious Mikhail Oktan, who organized this mutiny against the authority of our dear Chairman." Actually, for most, that was a surprise. "Indeed, it's clear, at least to me, that we can no longer tolerate such a rat-like insubordinate in our ranks, no matter how entrenched he may be." Zykov looked around this room, his cool, calculating gaze analyzing each committee member. He was confident in their vote. One by one, each consented to Oktan's arrest. "Very well. If it is the will of the committee, I will order the arrest of Mikhail Oktan and his subsequent trial."\n\nOktan would not get a trial. After his arrest, during which he made no small protest, he was taken to a small barn near the outskirts of Samara, and given a sentencing, ultimately being shot. His body was burned. Such was the end of Mikhail Oktan."
 SAM.405.a: "Good riddance."

 SAM.406.t: "Zykov Coup Foiled"
 SAM.406.desc: "It was a different Miletiy Zykov that entered Chairman Bunyachenko's office. In the best of times Zykov's manic energy and natural charisma had made it easy to see how the former journalist had gathered such a following. In bad times, Zykov's steely determination explained how the long suffering democratic faction had weathered ten years of abuse from various factions in Samara.\n\nToday's Zykov reminded Bunyachenko of seeing himself in a mirror. The former journalist did not walk into the office so much as he tumbled in, pushed around by the weight of events.\n\n"Zykov. Good to see you." The democratic activist began to speak, only for the Chairman to cut him off. "No, please let me continue. Right now, a tidal wave of shit is threatening to wash away our progress. The Officer Committee believes that Oktan is behind everything that's happening right now in the army and the liberated territories. You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces."\n\n"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the Officer Committee? I should go see them directly"\n\nBunyachenko smiled a little. Something of Zykov's old bravado remained. That was good. "The Officer Committee are useless, tired old men. On that, you, Oktan and I agree. No, Zykov, you will argue your case with me. You are an eloquent fellow. If you convince me that you can be of use, perhaps you'll see some of your dreams realized. I'm in the market for new... associates."\n\nZykov's eyes shone a little brighter. Or had it been just an illusion? The former journalist began to make his case as the Chairman leaned back into his chair. Contacts throughout northern Russia could be convinced to help end the revolts within the month."

"There he is! The traitor to Chairman Oktan's Russia! Seize him.!"\n\nZykov was thrown to the ground. Blood in his mouth. Where had he gone wrong? Had he not done enough to evince Oktan's influence?

Chairman Vlasov was dead, and despite his abysmal popularity, he had built the foundations for the final liberation of Russia. In his new office, Chairman Zykov looked over reports from his loyal officers, his bodyguards stood lazily behind him. According to his reports, few and vague as they were, Oktan and his cronies were preparing to make their move. Sadly, they had no idea when the spider would strike.\n\nZykov was surprised when, as the clock struck noon, a squad of ROA regulars led by one of Oktan's lapdogs burst through the door. His bodyguards raised their weapons, but they died before they could fire. The weaselly man at their head grinned cruelly as he spoke, "Chairman Zykov, in the name of Vlasov's true heir, you are under arrest for treason against the Russian people. Come quietly or die like a dog." The Chairman could do little more than comply. As he was led to a truck outside, he was tackled to the ground by one of his assailants. Just then, gunfire from the surrounding buildings cut down the coup members. As he lay under the bulk of his savior, he vowed to hunt the rat Oktan to the ends of the Earth."

His position as the new Chairman of the KOSP was balancing on a knife's edge, and whether he survived the coming days was just as uncertain.\n\nThe clock struck noon and the players made their move. Boris and Alexei acted at once, seizing the Chairman without warning. Boris spoke then, "In the name of Commander Oktan, you are under arrest for treason, Chairman Zykov. Please, come quietly." Knowing that he had little hope of escaping, Zykov gave up. However, before they could move the door to the office burst open and a squad of ROA troopers marched in, followed by men Zykov recognized as some of Bunyachenko's henchmen. The man at the front of the group's eyes widened and he opened his mouth to shout orders, however before he could, Boris had opened fire. Zykov was thrown to the side and struck his head against the corner of his desk. As his eyes slid shut, he knew he would be at the victor's mercy when he awoke."

This treacherous attempt to destroy the last hope of all Russians came to a head just days ago when units loyal to Sergey Bunyachenko attempted to storm the central districts of our state, supported by tanks, saboteurs, and artillery.\n\nHowever, just before these extremists and blackguards reached the residence of our great leader Zykov, the stalwart loyalists among the Russian Liberation Army mobilized to prevent the overthrow, and save our movement from destruction. Overwhelmed by the stern defence of these brave soldiers and surrounded on all sides by a jeering populace, the putschists soon felt the jaws of the state closing in around their pathetic rebellion, and fled to the outlying districts, where they soon turned to brigandry to survive. Commander Bunyachenko has called for peace and reconciliation, claiming that the putschists had nothing to do with him or the Officer Committee. While the disloyal general is likely to be kept on the general staff, his political career is widely seen as irreparably damaged.

Bunyachenko also wishes to stress that his government's reclamation of the Far East, and the eventual reunification of Russia proper, would only increase available opportunities for both of our economies.\n\nMany corporations and business owners are supportive of this action, as it would both increase the profits of corporations seeking to invest in Russia, and provide a new market for Japanese goods.

 SAM.423.desc: "Tokyo has agreed to deliver to us designs of both jets and radars, in addition to radar technology. Already in our ports and hangars, the Japanese are delivering dozens of jets, pieces of radar technology and the various designs of both the technology itself and the technology to help make it.\n\nOur military is very happy after the prototypes, considering them to be useful in training individuals on how to use them before the first batch of our military designs are created. Many of them also consider how cheap they were in relative comparison to their benefits, with one of them saying it was a "steal."\n\nThe Japanese diplomats who notified us of the transfer have been very kind, and are expecting a very warm relationship in the future - both economically and militarily."

 SAM.424.t: "Japan Rejects the Deal!"
 SAM.424.desc: "Despite our official diplomatic recognition, it appears that Japan refuses to give us the designs and prototypes that would give us an advantage in fully reunifying the country.\n\nAccording to the Japanese diplomats, Tokyo considers the transfer of jets and their designs to be too dangerous to their relationship with the German Reich, in addition to the low cost and little benefit that such a transfer would give to their nation.\n\nOur military is disappointed about the deal falling through, especially those in the Air Force, with one even stating that it would set them back many months, even years, before they would get to a point of full efficiency.\n\nDespite this, it appears that our government can only rely so much on our foreign allies. We must do some of these things on our own."

 SAM.425.desc: "To the average citizen, bribery seems like a thing that should be eliminated, and under most circumstances they would be right. But Russia has never lived under normal circumstances, especially after the collapse of our nation and the warlordism that infected it for so long.\n\nWestern Siberia has lived as a place with much diversity in both thought and practice, with anarchists, socialists, monarchists, and moderates living right next to each other, sometimes violently, sometimes peacefully. Regardless, we have brought this region under our control, and we expect to keep them for a long time.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that they will just accept this. Many citizens wish to create their own party, or to participate in elections outside of the Yedinstvo. This could be devastating, because if a big enough party can challenge us, many inside of the Yedinstvo may begin to question the usefulness of staying inside the tent. Our Economics Department, however, has offered a way to solve this problem: by bribing important citizens to keep with the Yedinstvo.\n\nBut there is a split. Some wish to bribe important businessmen, as they can provide us with a significant base of resources to win elections and maintain power in these regions. Others wish to bribe local democrats who, for one reason or another, are critical of the regime or Yedinstvo as a whole. Which option we choose could determine who rules of Western Siberia for a long time."

The population of Korol couldn't have been more than several hundred, but the officer could have sworn he felt a million eyes staring into his soul. The crowd had gathered around the podium in anticipation of the campaign. Kiril tried to compose himself: This isn't the army anymore. You gotta play to the fools' whims.\n\n'Brothers, I greet you on this f-fine day!' In a desperate effort to sound compassionate, Kiril's voice came out shaken, "I-i assure you that I stand by my policies: freedom and p-prosperity for every man in this town! My allies, they um, assured me that they would transport new farming equipment to Korol as soon as I get elected!" The crowd returned light applause. Korol was a minor Ural town, home to the aging and the dead. Nonetheless, Zykov himself assigned Major Kiril to run for mayor. Just show these people that we're on their side.\n\n"I m-myself, am, uh, from Korol!" Kiril lied, "and now I h-have returned-"\n\n"I don't remember you!" a raspy voice came from the back. Like a double door, the crowd separated to reveal an old man, barely supported on a stick, pointing at Kiril, "I have lived here all my life, and never have I seen you!" the crowd turned to Kiril. Stay calm. "Well, I, um, have changed!" proclaimed Kiril, "Y-yes, I fought in the Ger-, um, Western army, left when I was a boy."\n\n"Never heard of no boy named Kiril." the old man interrupted him again.

The officer inspected the papers, letting out a loud hum and appearing to be deep in thought. At first, Zykov expected the man to come up with an excuse. Five minutes passed. Then ten, but Vladimir kept flipping through the documents.\n\n"Dammit, Vlad!" Zykov reached across the desk and grabbed the papers out of the soldier's hand, "You are an army man! You can't just go around owning a hundred different businesses!" The major remained still, not unlike a child being scolded for misbehavior. The Chairman forced a smile and leaned in, whispering, "Why?"\n\nVladimir nodded for a second, "Well, see here Comrade Zykov, it all began when I heard private Go-"\n\nZykov jumped out of his seat, shouting "I don't care, dammit! Explain why you, an officer, have all these enterprises!" Vladimir was shaken, but recomposed himself; "See, I'm a businessman-" Zykov fell down in his seat,"

 SAM.428.desc: "Evgeny rose from the bed and gazed silently at Yulia, who was still asleep. He could feel a migraine coming already, and groaned softly as he went into the next room. Yulia had laid his uniform out on a kitchen chair. He regarded it now in the eerie glow of the streetlamp streaming through the window.\n\nEvgeny was far from ideological. He had fought for the Red Army because they supported him and his wife, because of an anger born in him from his father's death in a German bombing run, and because there was nothing else. It was precisely for this lack of politics that he'd gone unpunished after the Samarans marched into Archangelsk. Now he had been drafted as a soldier of the ROA, pledged to fight bolshevik and tsarist to unite Russia.\n\nAnd despite his nonpartisan bent, he hated the Russian Liberation Army. He hated them with every ounce of his being. He hated them for being German bootlickers, fighting for Hitler against their Russian countrymen. Their progenitor, Andrey Vlasov, could barely be called a man. This hatred was locked inside him, and Evgeny had successfully concealed every ounce of it. So far. Now fate conspired to make him one of them.\n\nAnger gave way to sadness. What could he do? He needed to protect Yulia, to make enough money that they could one day have a family. If he had to choose between seeing her suffer and fighting for the Vlasovites, then there was not really a choice. He thought of waking her before he left, as she had asked him to, but decided against it. He would do what he had to. For her.\n\nEvgeny made his way through the early morning chill, ready to report to the ROA barracks. The traitor's badge was pinned to his sleeve."

 SAM_oktan.1.t: "The Good Governor"
 SAM_oktan.1.desc: "When the man calling himself Skuratov marched into the village of Arabach at the head of an armed column, the people didn't know what to expect. Over the past several months, there had been rumors of highwaymen on the roads, and visitors from the surrounding towns had talked about how worried they were for their safety in the region. This Skuratov claimed to be representing the central government in Samara. He was here to bring safety and order to the region.\n\nMostly, he brought terror.\n\nBodies washed up in the river, marked by whips and knives. Neighbors were dragged off in the night, screaming for their loved ones. Occasionally, a man suspected of collaborating with bandits was found hanging from a post, where everyone could see. Several dozen died in this way, and by the time that the rumors of highwaymen dried up, Skuratov may as well have been Lucifer to the people of Arabach.\n\nThen, one morning, a body was found near the village well. It was Skuratov's, his guts trailing out from his filthy uniform. In the lap of the body was his head, eyes still bulging with surprise. The cut had not been clean.\n\nPinned to the uniform's jacket was a placard."

 SAM_oktan.2.t: "Business in the New Russia"
 SAM_oktan.2.desc: "Leo Ivanovyich had thought that it would be easy. He and his boys controlled many of the checkpoints leading into Kazan from the south, so the government in Samara - such as it was - had decided that they would be perfect to help set up a new arms workshop in the city proper. And Leo Ivanovyich had assumed that they could get the job done. After all, they had the government's blessing.\n\nNo such luck.\n\nFirst, they had to ship the machine tools from Naberezhnye Chelny down the Kama River and up the Volga. That meant that the ferrymen had to be bribed, because they didn't just ship any random fellow's goods. The same went for the sheet metal, which was mostly moved overland past checkpoints belonging to another warlord. Another round of bribes. Then, at one of the narrowest points along the Volga, some shitheads had pulled up a chain, blocking the boats, and would only lower it if they were convinced... with some more bribes. The oldest one couldn't have been more than twenty. Leo still grimaced at the memory of his shit-eating smile. Finally, all their supplies had arrived in Kazan. After the local thug who owned their assigned docks had been suitably bribed, the materiel was moved to the construction site.\n\nWhen a man who went by "Xösäyen the Turk" sauntered up and declared that he owned the site, and would be charging a rent, Leo Ivanovyich bit his tongue to keep from screaming."

 SAM_oktan.3.t: "A Busy Week"
 SAM_oktan.3.desc: "Mikhail Oktan was not a fan of micro-management. If anything, he preferred his days to be quite relaxed. While there would be some requests, he expected to have a lot of free time to indulge in pursuits. Not today. Not any of this week. First, one of the regional administrators had woken him up at the early hours of the morning, calling about some small arbitrary shipping dispute that according to his description "could have brought us all to ruin." So he'd sided with him, gone back to bed, and promptly awoke again a mere thirty minutes later by another regional administrator calling to beseech him for the decision, calling for an immediate reversal.\n\nThe rest of the day had been spent dealing with more and more generals calling in to say their piece, or adding their own problems to the pile. And then, by the time he had managed to go to sleep, a set of smaller disputes surged into view. He had no time for revelry, or drinking, or women, or even a bit of rest. It was to his horror, akin to herding cats.\n\nBy the middle of the week he was tired, overworked, and hoping that it would end. A brief spike in disputes, or troubles, or arguments he could handle. Then, Vladimir Artsezo decided to add his "requests" to the pile. His second in command and a bunch of civilians were calling for meetings. And worse- all of these meetings seemed to be criticisms.\n\n"To spread fascism should perhaps be the main objective of this administration." Vladimir spoke calmly, as Oktan rolled his eyes. "In fact, perhaps if we-"\n\n"I have said multiple times that I will do what is right. Do you doubt your leader?" He interrupted the rest of Vladmir's speech with a tone of iron, before shooing them for the hour. This was the busiest week he'd had- but surely it was only a week. Right?\n\nThen the phones rang again, and Mikhail cursed."

 SAM_oktan.4.t: "A Personal Inspection"
 SAM_oktan.4.desc: "When the scientists heard that Chairman Oktan was coming to inspect the nuclear program, they were excited. Workers were assembled, officers were readied, and the welcome mat was unrolled. However, when the Chairman actually arrived, his responses were... underwhelming. He seemed far less interested with the glory of Russia and the test results, and more interested in how much the nuclear technologies were worth. A tall, gaunt man who looked to be Swiss stood at his side as he looked over the parts, murmuring numbers and price ranges.\n\n"Sir." One scientist spoke, as Oktan turned. "Weapons development is coming along nicely. We should be able to finish the first model by-"\n\n"Yes, yes. I have read the reports. What do you think of these thrusters?" he asked, as the tall gaunt man at his side looked over.\n\n"Likely a fair price..." he muttered, as Oktan turned and looked around, his eyes locking onto a scientist who was publicly loyal - to one of the officers.\n\n"It would appear we have found some errors in the thrusters. Clearly the work of this traitor," he muttered, as the guards at his sides quickly made... short work of the "traitor." "Double your efforts." The remaining scientists hastily nodded, and the inspection ended shortly afterwards. If anything, the men were not looking forward to the next one..."

 SAM_oktan.5.t: "The Dictator's Court"
 SAM_oktan.5.desc: "Industrialists. Officers. Party chiefs. All came to see Oktan, and all could not, and would not shut up. Every single one of them had complaints, and every single one was glaring daggers at each other. The business-men complained that the army was attempting to extort them, the army claimed the party and industrialists were attempting to seize direct control of their assets, and the party complained that the other two groups were undermining every single part of the region.\n\n"Gentlemen, please." Oktan spoke calmly and coolly as the calm, charismatic voice from earlier times rang out. "Russia is within our reach, and you bicker over trivial concerns? Once Russia is unified - then we can solve such small matters." He gave a smile, as the men eyed each other slowly and fell silent.\n\n"Of course, sir. But, if you perhaps could just take a moment..." A single officer murmured, only to pause as Mikhail's smile faded, and the warm voice from past times vanished.\n\n"Once Russia is ours." Mikhail Oktan hissed, his gaze drilling into the officer's own. "Then, we will discuss these matters. Understood?" It did not take long for assent in response, as the officer sheepishly - and hurriedly apologized. A small nod from Oktan, and a gesture to leave.\n\nAs the officers filed out, the meeting's... abrupt ending became the new topic of questioning. Was their leader's warm and soothing voice an act, or was he becoming unstable? Rumors flitted, and paranoia grew."
 SAM_oktan.5.a: "Stress has a way of spreading..."

 SAM_oktan.6.t: "The Dictator and the Banker"
 SAM_oktan.6.desc: "One of the few, if only meetings Mikhail Oktan looked forward to was that of one of his bankers. Switzerland had many, many talented banking representatives who worked for him, but none outshined Luca. A tall and gaunt man with a talent for numbers who allegedly never smiled, and most importantly never spoke a single word of their conversations to anyone.\n\nWithin the darkness of night, Luca entered softly and silently before sitting, a small folder of forms in his hand. Largely just a reassessment of "inventory", "funds", and potentially lucrative assets, the reading of the forms went on for hours before Mikhail raised a hand.\n\n"How much of it can be transferred?"\n\n"To?" Luca asked, as Mikhail sighed.\n\n"Switzerland. How much of my assets can be transferred to Switzerland? I think...it may be prudent to safely store some of my riches. In fact; how is my vacation home?" A pause, as Luca looked at him.\n\n"I have no intention of leaving," Oktan stated quickly. "Russia - requires a strong man to keep it going. It's impossible to leave it like it is. Still... how is my vacation home?" He asked, as Luca rolled his eyes."
 SAM_oktan.6.a: ""Just as you left it, sir.""

 SAM_oktan.7.t: "A Competent Voice"
 SAM_oktan.7.desc: "Leonid Samutin was surprised that he was still alive. He had made the decision to side with Zykov's faction within the ROA, and it had been the wrong one. That faction was now scattered, its members fled or missing. But not him.\n\nBecause, Samutin knew, as much as Oktan or his henchmen might have wanted to add his name to a list, they still, if they wanted territory to continue to loot, had to run a country. That took professionals. Administrators. Men who would tell the truth when decisions arose, even if that truth was unpalatable. Men like him.\n\nThat did not, as Samutin had been made painfully aware of, mean that he was safe. Far from it. He was expected to work. Expected to perform. Expected to obey. Expected to be on his best behaviour. He very much intended to be - he had been given a second chance, and he knew that a third would not be given, no matter how dire the nation's need might be. If his first task was anything to go by, that need would, in fact, soon be so dire.\n\nHe was to complete an inventory and report on the state of hundreds of industrial sites in Western Russia. Sites that the ROA had 'secured' during its regional campaigns. Sites that Oktan and his men had likely looted of everything of value. Sites that would have to be rebuilt, at the people's expense, if Russia was to continue standing.\n\nWith a sigh, he began arranging for transport. His personal feelings no longer mattered. What mattered was that he was alive, and he intended to remain so. It was time to work."

 SAM_oktan.8.t: "The Kleptocrat's Fascist"
 SAM_oktan.8.desc: "Vladimir Samarin had not expected to be working for a bandit king. Then again, he had not expected a bandit king to have effectively established control over all of Russia.\n\nStill, even as much as he despised Mikhail Oktan - or whatever his real name was - he had to give him credit. Samarin knew that the man would not have been able to advance as far as he had without possessing considerable, if warped, political intelligence. He also knew that Oktan's slavish dedication to personal profit offered opportunity to those under him that, like Samarin, were true ideologues.\n\nAnd so he, a lifelong believer in the strength and national advancement promised by fascist ideals, had agreed to join Russia's governing kleptocrat, receiving an appointment as Foreign Minister. He imagined that Oktan saw the whole situation as something of a twisted joke, using one such as he to promote the 'virtues' of his gangster state. Samarin knew that, regardless of what he was told, he was being watched, and so he would act his part, and do his job.\n\nStill, even though Samarin knew his position as one of expediency, it did not mean that he did not burn with anger and hatred every time he watched Oktan or one of his cronies siphon more resources away from Russia and towards themselves. And, so, he had decided to, within the bounds of his position, do something about it.\n\nHe could, and would, use his authority to establish a domestic, grassroots political organization. An organization dedicated to strength and national advancement, virtues that Oktan and his faction could not publicly disavow.\n\nOne day, he hoped, it might be strong enough to restore some semblance of true government to the country that he loved so much."

 SAM_oktan.9.t: "The Golden Throne"
 SAM_oktan.9.desc: "Oktan held a photograph in his hands. It was bleached with age, the shot unfocussed and grainy, but he knew what it depicted. In the photo, a younger Oktan stood next to Vlasov, Zykov, and Bunyachenko, brothers united together in the cause of a free Russia. He looked at his fellow officers with contempt, muttering to himself, "I won. I beat you. The scheming Jew and the old man, dust in the wind. They will remember me, they will build statues of me!" Oktan shook his head, throwing the photo into the flames of his hearth, the gilded forms of Roman gods watching the Samara Four blacken and curl in the heat. Oktan uncorked a crystal decanter of fine plundered liquor, pouring himself a tumbler-full. He raised the bitter glass to his lips, savoring the harsh flavor as it burned down his throat. He could be whatever he liked, he mused. President? Tsar? Emperor? Vozhd? Whatever title Oktan pleased, he could adopt. The thought of "Vozhd-Emperor" crossed his mind, but he dismissed it as ridiculous.\n\nAll, he supposed, was not well. While his immediate threats had been dealt with, there were rumblings beneath his feet. The "orthodox" fascists in Samara hated him, and Kromiadi and Truhin threatened his rule with officer cliques and schemes. No matter, mused Oktan, today he was king of the Russians. Kings often ruled with a golden scepter in one hand and a butcher's cleaver in the other, why shouldn't Oktan? Today, he would relax and enjoy the fruits of his labor. Tomorrow, heads would roll."

 SAM_oktan.10.desc: "The couple sat alone in one of Samara's finest restaurants, despite it being peak dining hour. The man was an ROA officer in impeccably kept uniform and a dashing, expensive fur coat. The woman was twenty years younger and obviously smitten with him, in part because of the lavish clothes that he had given her just the night before. He ordered the caviar for her and a pork roast, cooked to perfection, and took out a vintage red wine that he had brought himself. These were lean times; such things were immensely rare for the common man.\n\n"So," the girl began, "isn't it lucky that we have the whole place to ourselves?" The officer put his hand on his chin and made a great show of thinking, as if he found the situation to be the height of mystery. In reality, he knew exactly what had happened: a truly spectacular bribe to the manager was all it took to make him refuse all the other patrons' reservations.\n\n"Certainly, my darling, but sometimes things have their way of working out."\n\n"Tell me a bit about your service. My parents always said that the ROA were nothing but crooks, but I don't think so at all. I think you're very brave." An image of his paying for the jewels with protection money flashed through his mind, but he pushed it aside. He cycled through memories to see if he had any good ones, but they were all of the same kind. Bribes, backroom deals, plain and simple robbery, assassinations, diverting valuable resources from the front lines into schemes and arms deals that benefited him alone. No matter. He'd simply invent a story.\n\n"I was on the front lines in the fifties, when suddenly I was surrounded by communists..." His story, completely fictitious, dragged on into the night, and she hung on every word, until they kissed after the conclusion. It was good being a general, he thought to himself, the best job in the world."

As his vision swam, he spotted the aide standing in the doorway from the corner of his eye. The man squirmed in place. Oktan was considering sending him away, but on a whim he waved him in. "What is it now?"\n\nIt was somewhat more serious than he had expected. Two warlords with neighbouring territories - men he had made himself - were feuding. Already some skirmishes between their troops had resulted in deaths, and they seemed to be stockpiling arms to go to war. The dispute was, as far as he could make out, more about mutual loathing than anything else. Oktan sighed. The odd massacre across the border he could wave away. This was an internal matter, and required action. One of the warlords was a bonehead, but of the other he had expected more.\n\n"This could have waited until after the party," said Oktan, watching the aide wither under his glare. He held the look for a moment, then smiled and clapped the man on the back. "You're here now. And you're right, something has to be done." Oktan turned over an unlit cigarette in his left hand, skimming over the written report a second time. He'd already condemned the more foolish warlord to death. But the other, such wasted promise. A shame. "Kill both of them," he told the aide finally. "You can give this to Belyaev. Tell him to avoid killing their men if he can manage it, but that he can do so if needed. Wait!" he called after the aide, as the man stood. "After it's done, hang the bodies in public."\n\nOktan returned to the party with a grin, but his heart was no longer in it.

His Russia was a land of petty tyrants, and Kovalevsky was the pettiest of them all, but that didn't mean he could safely avoid his duties. It was already bad enough stuck three steps away from wilderness, surrounded by suspicious and unfriendly peasants, with only a collection of cutthroats in uniform to keep him company. Kovalevsky might lack the creativity to make his life truly bad, but he'd certainly know how to make it worse.\n\n"They, er- charged a processing fee, Lieutenant.

You don't take orders from him. Who set up that checkpoint?"\n\n"I suspect he did, sir. We paid them their fee, then went to the paymaster's office, where the clerk told us we needed to fill out some forms and pay the processing fee of 25 rubles."\n\n"25 rubles to process some papers? Does Oktan know he's got Jews running his warehouses? This is ridiculous."\n\n"Well, by that point the clerk told us we had failed to meet the assessed tax burden, and when Siyanov complained, he told us he could send out someone to take a look at the village and possibly make sure the tax burden is calculated more accurately-""

When the proclamation was issued that the Jews of Vyatka were to be protected, it had eased his fears only ever so slightly.\n\n"Yes."\n\nThe captain's lips curled into a smile as he scribbled something down in his notebook.\n\n"Oh, that's very good, Mr. Strugatsky.

 SAM_oktan.15.desc: ""I'm sure you have all heard of the raid that occurred last week and how it was repelled by two of our brave soldiers- but the situation demands that we all be prepared for hostilities. Bolshevik bandits still infest our land, and until they are dealt with we need to be prepared for anything!"\n\nIt wasn't Bolsheviks, thought Kovalevsky- it was that bastard Muratov from the next village over, turning his men into cattle-raiders to try and pull himself a bit higher up on the ladder. Well, that wouldn't do at all. Next time they came, these peasants would be ready for them.\n\n"Simoyov, Belevich, start distributing the weapons." He had purchased the rifles from an officer passing through the area- they'd been destined for the German border, but the officer in charge of the convoy was easily persuaded that the crate had been lost and that there wasn't any real threat from that area anyway. The only people crossing the border were smugglers, already on Oktan's payroll.\n\n"You are to treat these weapons with great care, for they are hard to come by, and to conserve ammunition, which is even harder to find given the state the communists have left us in!" The weapons were a collection of Mosins and submachine guns left over from the last war, and it took some doing to get the peasants organized to any degree. His soldiers were as useless as the peasants, more used to their German-made automatic rifles than Soviet weapons older than they were. With the help of an elderly ex-reservist, they finally managed to go over the basics; loading, unloading, and how to properly hold the weapon.\n\nThe afternoon proceeded with minimal grumbling and even less accuracy from the peasants, and by the time the sun set, Kovalevsky had made up his mind.\n\n"Keep these guns locked up unless there's an emergency. They're more likely to shoot us than Muratov's men. Maybe we'll see who can shoot and recruit them if we need to go to war.""

 SAM_oktan.16.desc: ""... and then, I tell you, she came home with me that very same night! Parisian women love foreigners, and even more than that, they love engineers!" Mikhail Oktan and his comrades all raised their heads in laughter, even those who didn't find the tale particularly funny; most feared being singled out by the ROA's leader. The Samaran bar that they had occupied for the evening had mostly been emptied out as Oktan and his compatriots drank the night away - many locals had grown wary of the dangers posed by getting in the way of the ROA's officers. Oktan raised a glass to his lips, and tilted it back, emptying its contents into his stomach, before beginning another tale, this time talking about how his parents were rich nobles from Croatia. "And all of you, of course, should know that I come from a very wealthy line of barons and baronesses in Croatia. When I was seventeen, I spent some time in Zagreb, and the whole town knew my name - half of them loved me, the other half were terrified of me. And let me tell you, there's nothing like a Croatian peasant to remind you of your higher station. One time, I was walking the streets..."\n\nAs Oktan talked, an exceptionally drunken junior officer by the name of Nikita Ivanov, who had heard one too many of Oktan's stories, was sloppily putting together incongruities in his head. "But, sir, wait..." he said, his words slurred just a tad. "Last week, you said when you were seventeen, you were in Madrid, helping manage a colonial exposition from Morocco?"\n\nOktan, for just a second, glared into the man's eyes, a dangerous, piercing gaze, right into the drunken officer's soul. But as quick as it had come, it disappeared. "Oh, yes... I must have misspoke, this vodka is strong tonight! I meant, of course, I spent time in Zagreb when I was sixteen...""

 SAM_oktan.17.desc: "Lev Turgenev lived a normal life. Or, as normal as a life got in mid-60's Russia. He got up with dawn, prayed before breakfast, and went to work a slavish day in a factory producing the very guns that had killed both of his brothers during the Komi Republic's heyday. Both had been killed during their participation in the political militias in '62 and '63 respectively. Turgenev, like his parents, had grieved, but death was commonplace in Russia. But Turgenev had made his peace with the nature of the Republic's trade-off: one could live a free life and speak for what they believed in. In return, a certain degree of risk in one's everyday life could be expected.\n\nSo when the Russian Liberation Army paraded themselves through Syktyvkar in an apparent parody of the Soviet soldiers Turgenev's father would tell him about, he had been worried for the future of his livelihood and the status quo he had gotten used to. And for a time, his fears had been legitimized. The ROA, on orders of their officers, had looted the city. They had stripped it of what wealth it had but when they had finished, things returned to a certain normalcy. Turgenev went back to work in his factory; it was as if the looting had never happened. But the ROA promised peace and prosperity, and eventually they had delivered. The city saw a massive revitalization in terms of jobs and quality of living.\n\nTurgenev may have had a thicker wallet and better food, but he always felt that dark clouds were on the horizon, a belief reinforced by the continual military patrols and rumors of brutal "policing actions" in rural areas. As Turgenev headed home for dinner one night, he passed a recruiting poster, a soldier with a big grin on his face and an unwieldy, too-large gun in his hands. A thought crossed Turgenev's mind, but he quickly dismissed it. He couldn't fight for a government he feared."

 SAM_oktan.18.desc: "Clark Moore had never been to Russia. He had never even thought of going to Russia in all of his forty-three years spent on Earth. But when the general manager received a highly-unusual communique from the Chairman of the Provisional Commissariat of Western Russia, Mikhail Oktan, requesting that his hockey team travel from Toronto to Samara to play a game against local Russians, he was surprised and initially reluctant. That is, until he saw the money Oktan was offering. It was enough to... well, overhaul the team and make way in the budget for better draft picks the following year. And that was just to start. Moore barely waited a day before he wired his answer: "Yes."\n\nThe game itself was quite civil. The Russian team was filled with large, intimidating figures who looked more like soldiers than they did athletes. But despite the final outcome, a 4-0 win for the Canadians, Moore had been impressed with the performance of the Russians. He joked to himself that in a few more years, the Russians could even rival Canadian hockey talent.\n\nAfter the game, Moore and his coaches spent the evening at Oktan's residence in Samara, a palace of decadence, with the finest cigars and expensive vodka. As he was boarding the plane to go back to Toronto, he was satisfied with the trip. But as he sat on the long flight, he couldn't help but remember choice sayings Oktan had uttered that had made him uneasy. He had enjoyed his time in Russia, but decided that he wouldn't be returning for quite some time."

I've heard you've finally decided to pledge your loyalty to me. A wise decision, very like you."\n\nKromiadi does not show the disgust he feels with himself and Oktan both, and simply nods. Bunyachenko would understand. "Yes, and I thank you for the mercy you've shown me," Kromiadi began, his voice raspy. "However, that still doesn't explain why you've decided to summon me to your office."\n\nThinking for a moment, Oktan nodded slowly to himself. "I'm sure you've heard of my recent appointments of Fyodor Truhin and Victor Polyakov to Central Siberia, among others." Kromiadi had indeed heard. He had never known Truhin to have strong stances on much of anything for all the years that he'd known him, but Polyakov had come as a surprise; even he knew little about the man, so what Oktan saw in him, he might never know.\n\n"I have, what of it?" Kromiadi asked.\n\n"How would you like to help govern West Siberia on my behalf, being as clever and wise as you are?" Oktan asked, a venomous edge to his words. He clearly held no love for Kromiadi, but some problem was troubling him, something he was unable to solve on his own. If he accepted, Kromiadi considered, he might be able to pursue Bunyachenko's vision to some extent. And if he refused, Oktan very well might decide to take out his unusual frustration on him. His choice was clear."

Oktan exclaimed with a grin. A fake one, Truhin thought. "I haven't had the chance to meet with you in forever. Are you well?"\n\nA few seconds of silence passed before Truhin answered. He tapped his finger impatiently on his leg. The pleasantries were the worst, least efficient part of any conversation. "Yes." He finally replied. "I am well. Now what is it that you really called me here to speak about? My execution or my promotion?"\n\nOktan chuckled at that response, though Truhin did not understand what was so funny. "Straight to the point as always, Fyodor. That's why I like you, you're quick to get results no matter how you have to get them." Truhin's tapping of his finger on his leg increased in pace, and Oktan cleared his throat. "Fortunately for you, it's a promotion. You're being appointed to govern a territory in Western Siberia on my behalf, a reward for all your years of loyalty and dedication." That last part was definitely a lie, but Truhin did not particularly care. All that mattered was that he wasn't going to die today. It was all that had ever mattered in his career, really.\n\nThe tapping of his finger stopped, though his bored expression did not change. "I see. Thank you for this opportunity. I will fulfill the obligations of this new role." As he got up and opened the door to leave, he heard Oktan mutter one last thing."

Tomorrow, he would deliver a speech to the adoring masses of Samara; hopefully before Zykov and Bunyachenko could prepare their own statements. Taking a pause from his grimacing, Oktan dialed Rech, his personal propaganda machine in operation since Barbarossa. "Hello-"\n\n"Oktan speaking.

Under the watchful rifles of Oktan's personal guard, the crowd cheered as the hero of all Russians finished his speech, sweat shining from his brow. Nervous smiles and frantic clapping rippled through the masses that had been "encouraged" to attend his rally.

While the general form of the KONR uniform had been preserved, elements from the Reich had crept in. The high, stiff collar adorned with oak leaves, the gold frogging on the shoulders, and the gorget of silver were difficult to ignore, but they did their best. A rank insignia of unknown designation was proudly stitched to his breast.\n\n"Jesus," muttered one of the guards just past the gate, "I guess there's no accounting for taste."\n\nHis companion, stifling a chuckle, whispered, "How much blood do you think he had to sell to afford that monstrosity?" Both fell into stony-faced silence as the "Head General of the Russian Liberation Army" stepped past them.

He had planned this dinner weeks ago and hated the possibility of losing face with Samara's upper crust.\n\n"No," replied the driver hastily, "we left with plenty of time to spare, there are people blocking the road." Indeed, with voices and placards raised in anger, a throng of protestors had gathered in Samara's central square. Signs reading, "Down with Oktan!" and "Zykov for the people!" and other such nonsense could be seen. The police, thank God, had already engaged the protestors, batons rising and falling with wet thumps. A path was steadily being cleared, but the general frowned impatiently as the Mercedes gently attempted to ford its way through the crowd. Progress was progress, he supposed.\n\nSuddenly, the car ground to a halt. "What now?" demanded Oktan.\n\n"There's someone in the road." Sure enough, a young woman holding a placard with Zykov's face held her hand out in front of the Mercedes.\n\n"I will pay you fifty-thousand rubles to drive straight ahead."\n\n"Sir?"

A week ago, Kolzakm had attempted to run, to flee Samara when Oktan had ascended to the throne of Samara. He had, of course, been captured before he reached the border, and just like every other Russian in Samara, had become a prisoner of the mad general. He coughed, blood leaking from his lips. Perhaps this was his death sentence, a delayed execution.\n\nGeneral Sorokin sighed, wiping a hand over his sweaty brow. The epidemic that had gripped his division had only now begun to abate after he had begun to separate the sick from the healthy. Medicine was a rare commodity in Samara, and a lowly recruit could not hope for treatment. Besides, Sorokin knew, Oktan's military henchmen hated to hear bad news.

The enemy had caught them with their pants down, launching a (even Sorokin had to admit) superb assault on their camp, and as men died and milled about in terrified confusion, Sorokin continued to dig. The radioman, his brains painted against the side of the ditch, his radio fouled by bullets, seemed to stare accusingly at the general. No help was coming.\n\nThe shrill whine known and feared by every soldier suddenly filled the air. Artillery! Sorokin flung himself to the earth, hands clasped over his head. The ditch exploded into clods of earth and chunks of men. Sorokin was hurled skywards, up becoming down, down becoming up. When the world stopped turning, he was flat on his back, tracers still whizzing overhead like so many fireflies. Ears ringing and head spinning, Sorokin pushed himself up. Looking down, he groaned in horror, his legs reduced to scraps of wet meat, his blood soaking the earth. Men ran in panic, the Mikhail Oktan Division reduced to screaming children. A soldier dashed past, and Sorokin reached out, grabbing onto the man's ankle. The soldier, fifteen at most, looked at the general with terrified eyes.\n\n"Help me, please-"\n\nThe boy cried out, kicking Sorokin full in the face as he made his escape.

Gold and silver dazzled in the candlelight, priceless antiques stood on pillars, and paintings by long dead masters hung on the walls. The table, a solid piece of marble, dominated the room, and not for the first time, Korolev wondered how on earth Oktan had managed to have the thing installed.

Zykov had offered a great deal to turn on Oktan, and Korolev would be lying if he said he had not seriously considered it. He may have, though he suspected it couldn't be proven, given the Jew useful breadcrumbs about Oktan's organization in exchange for a modest sum.\n\n"My dear Nikita," said Oktan, "you have been at my side since the beginning. Whenever agitators threatened our efforts, whenever our charges refused to pay, I could always count on you. This dinner is for you, old friend. I never could have made it this far without you."\n\nKorolev smiled weakly, "And I would still be a policeman in Moscow if it hadn't been for you, general.

People may even take an interest in the opposition and democracy as they continue to exist. Everything is only starting to take shape.\n\nHowever, the opposition party being allowed into power is not making things easy for us, even with our large majority.

Such thoughts were ridiculous, really, all he had to do was pass the post and submit his ballot. This was how things were done in a democracy, but to vote for himself seemed the height of arrogance.\n\n"Mr. Arkhipov," repeated the kindly old man standing outside of the booth, "you may enter when you are ready, but do hurry, the line is backing up." The old man, who had likely seen tyrannies unending, seemed delighted to be exercising his democratic rights and gave Arkhipov a reassuring smile. "First time voting?" asked the man, and the marine flashed a nervous smile and swallowed harshly.\n\n"Yes, it is. Sorry, I'll stop holding up the line." Arkhipov entered the booth, holding the little piece of paper in his hands. With hands shaking slightly from excitement, he pencilled in the square next to "Arkhipov, Vasily: Unity Party.""

 SAM_zykov.8.t: "The Hawk"
 SAM_zykov.8.desc: "Vladimir Bayerski adjusted his tie in the mirror, his uniform crisp and clean, his cap perched perfectly above his eyes. Today, like every day, was another step on the road to the total liberation of the Slavs. To the west, squatting like a half-mad giant over Europe, was the Reich. What was that Hitler had said of Russia? Kick in the door and the whole rotting foundation would come crashing down? Ironic, then, that Germany was riddled with rot, resting atop a mountain of corpses created by the civil war. Rotten foundations indeed, thought Bayerski.\n\nHe stopped fiddling with his tie for a moment, his hands falling to his side slowly as he fixed his gaze with that of his reflection. God, did he really look so old? So tired? He remembered the flight from Poland, his capture by the hated Germans, his own terrible shame at serving in their puppet army. He looked into his own eyes and saw horrors laid over horrors, a waking nightmare that would not end. Bayerski blinked, forcing down the screams, rattling machine guns, and the smell of smoke and blood that threatened to overtake him in that moment. No, he was in control. Bayerski nodded to his reflection. He would help take Russia by the hand into the new age, and with the support of Zykov, defend this infant republic to the bitter end. Bayerski forced a grim smile. The republic would endure, and so would he."

 SAM_zykov.9.t: "A Familiar Setting"
 SAM_zykov.9.desc: ""We've done it." Zykov spoke, eying the papers and reports on his desk with a smile, as Samutin stood to his right. "The Unity Party has secured its control over the democratic apparatus, and there's no opposition that can stand against it, either through ballot or through force. Finally, we can rest- " A pause, as Zykov turned his head to the economic minister- his face turning pale as he laid down the next reports.\n\n"... Samutin, please explain this to me. Before I read them; give me a watered down version. If it's bad news, give it to me as nicely as you can." Zykov's stare became focused, as Samutin slowly spoke after a few minutes of quiet. "Bayerski's 'millitarists' are getting into fights with 'democracy activists' led by someone new. A rising star. Vasily Arkhipov. Meanwhile, Silayev and his supporters have been making moves- I fear they are attempting to grab at the reins of power."\n\nFor a moment, Milety Zykov sat with an expression of bewilderment on his face; followed by dawning horror, before finally lapsing into a very, very grouchy mood. "You may leave now." He barely heard himself say it, as Samutin darted out of the room, leaving Zykov alone with the reports on his desk, the drink he was just about to pop open in celebration- and out of view of the public eye, photographs. Vlasov. Sergey. Even Oktan, all standing with him at some point or another, talking and plotting and planting daggers where no eyes could see for a time. And now, here he was- eying the reports of growing factionalism and plots within the party.\n\n... After a few moments of contemplation, he simply cursed once and opened the bottle with expression unchanging."

 SAM_zykov.10.t: "A Future in Sight"
 SAM_zykov.10.desc: "Lev Turgenev had seen a lot in the few years that he had been alive. Born in the city of Arkhangelsk during the darkest years of the German invasion, he and his family had relocated to the city of Syktyvkar in 1960, when the 18-year-old Turgenev had nearly been drafted into the army of the Soviet remnants based in the Far North. Syktyvkar had only proved to be more trouble than Arkhangelsk had been, however. Unlike in red territory, the so-called Komi Republic allowed free discourse, attracting to them a number of politicians from across the political spectrum. This, of course, had bred conflict, which had drawn Turgenev's two brothers into the politicking. Each of them had been killed during political intrigues in the capital - God rest their souls. But Turgenev knew that, for all the terrible things that free and open discourse brought, it was, at the end of the day, just that: free and open.\n\nWhen the Russian Liberation Army entered the city and paraded themselves around as if they were "liberating" the people, Turgenev worried. He had become accustomed and made peace with the freedom and its consequences that had been afforded to him through the Komi Republic, and for better or worse, he could at the very least speak his mind. When the ROA seized the city, he couldn't see anything but dark days ahead. But as weeks turned into months, and months into years, Turgenev realized that life under the ROA wasn't too bad. They had promised peace and democracy.\n\nWhile the former had come, the latter was only just beginning to manifest. One evening, as Turgenev made his usual walk home, he passed an ROA recruiting poster. A stoic man in uniform pointed towards him, asking him to protect his family and his homeland. A thought crossed Turgenev's mind, and he remembered that both of his brothers had died for a cause they believed in."

 SAM.smuta.zykov.1.desc: "The time is 08:55. Five minutes. Did the KONR Headquarters' hallways always seem this long? Maybe they were, and he never noticed? This building... did the architects and the designers know what this building was going to be used for? Zykov speed-walked down the lobby, tugging along his briefcases - his arms gradually giving ground to total senselessness as the blood rushed out of his arms. Was it this one? Screeching to a halt, he stabbed his head through the doorway. All that met him was peeling wallpaper, broken glass and a map of what used to be Russia in 1914. No, that was too pessimistic. Pessimism was a disease that kept oppressors in power and the oppressed in shackles - he would not have gotten this far if he had succumbed to its vice. All that met Miletiy Zykov inside that winding path of the KONR HQ was peeling wallpaper, broken glass and what Russia WILL be once more. What has been lost, will not stay that way.\n\nThe time now was 08:59. Regardless, it was not the room he was looking for. The Cabinet? Where did he decide where to put the new Cabinet? Too tainted by the stench of the past - and the blood of Germany's conquests - he had decided to move the Cabinet from the top floor, overlooking the landscape, to somewhere else. Somewhere... lower? Shit! Was this their great new President? A man who couldn't even keep track of where his government was? Disgraceful. What if he had been wrong to take power? He was not capable of wielding it. Something was wrong with him. Was it a lust for power, violence, wealth? The greatest feat ever performed was trying to convince himself that he was any different from his peers. He was n-\n\nStumbling into the end of the corridor, Miletiy Zykov found his government. Huddled around a grand, ebony table - with a mash of papers, documents and maps - they awaited him. Maybe all of those things were true - that he was no better of a person than Oktan and the like. He wouldn't deny it. But as he looked at those men who had dedicated themselves to becoming a small part of a better Russia, a burden slipped from his shoulders."

 SAM.smuta.zykov.2.t: "Approvals and Parties"
 SAM.smuta.zykov.2.desc: ""Next!" Officer Lavro called out, though he hardly needed to do so, as the man next in line was eagerly approaching. The 'Emergency Office of Registration of Political Parties' had been busy ever since it had opened, and to Lavro, it all certainly felt like an emergency.\n\nWho would have thought that so many people would all want to come and register their own pet political party? He suspected that most of these were scams, but orders were orders, and he trusted Zykov knew what he was doing.\n\n"Name, and party of registration," he said to the short man who approached. Today was the second visit for most of them, who had already submitted their requests for approval. Now they found out if they'd be permitted to run or not. It placed him in the position of being the bearer of good - or bad news.\n\n"Denis Bazhenov," the man said. "For the Liberal Party of Russia."\n\n"Right, one moment." He took a few minutes to go and find the papers, mildly dreading the answer. Bold of the man to declare a liberal party, as those hadn't had good approval history. To his surprise, he found it was approved. "Here you go," he handed it to the man. "Congratulations."\n\n"Thank you!" the man beamed, as he exited the room, and Lavro returned to work. It was only a while later, when a very different party was registered, did he realize that there'd been a mistake. It appeared he'd accidentally given the man the papers for the 'Democratic Party of Russia.' instead of the man's own.\n\nHe briefly thought about reporting it, but just sighed. There was too much to do, and trying to take back approval now would only cause more problems. Still, he was going to be much more careful looking at the papers in the future."
 SAM.smuta.zykov.2.a: "One liberal party can't cause too many problems."

 SAM.smuta.zykov.3.t: "The Road to Democracy"
 SAM.smuta.zykov.3.desc: ""Now is your opportunity, Russia!" Christov called out on the street, a poster in hand. "It is time the people had a voice! To speak truth to power! Join the Reform Movement, and we will bring the needed change to Russia!"\n\nThe man's voice was strong, but restrained, and his face looked less confident than he sounded. As he shouted his slogans, holding a poster, and pouch full of leaflets slung over his shoulder, he certainly stood out from the crowd. His head darted one direction, then another in rapid succession, as if watching out for someone to come for him.\n\nYet no one did.\n\nHe tensed as a pair of soldiers walked by, and braced himself for the arrest to come, but... it never did. The soldiers just laughed at him, snickering to one another as they left. He heard the word 'crazy' muttered, but outside of that, nothing happened. His heart still raced every time he saw a soldier or police officer - at any other point in the past, he'd have been arrested by now.\n\nInstead, he was able to finish his day of campaigning, and even talked to a few prospective voters, all without interruption. As the sun began to set, he made his way back home, marveling at how much was different, and for once, feeling optimistic about the future. As he opened the door, his wife came out, her expression relieved and confused at the same time.\n\n"You're back!" She said, embracing him, clearly relieved. They'd argued over if he should do this, if Zykov could be trusted, and in the end he'd resolved it was better to try, than cower in fear.\n\n"How did it go?" She finally asked, and as he sat down, he took a moment before answering."

 SAM.smuta.zykov.4.t: "Condemnation Expected, Opportunity Offered"
 SAM.smuta.zykov.4.desc: "Timofeevka was not a place where people usually traveled. A village which was so isolated that there were few existing administrative systems at all, primarily managed by a single mayor. This was something that the men in the car traveling to the city-village intended to rectify, as part of Zykov's reforms. They intended to speak to this mayor on setting up a democratic system; one to some official standards.\n\nOr that was the plan, until the car had broken down.\n\nNow stranded on the road, the bureaucrats argued amongst themselves about what to do next. It was too far to walk the rest of the way, nor did any of them want to do that to begin with. At the same time, they weren't close enough to any nearby city either. Fortunately, they heard the sounds of an approaching vehicle, and hushed themselves.\n\n"Something I can help you with, gentlemen?" The driver, a somewhat unkempt man asked out his rolled-down window, eyeing the well-dressed men stranded on the road curiously. The men quickly explained where they were doing, and what they intended to do - and asked for a ride to Timofeevka.\n\nThe man was familiar with the small village, and when the men told him they were here to implement Zykov's reforms, he perked up. There hadn't been many politicians who impressed him, but he had to admit that Zykov was getting things done, things he approved of. That he was doing the same for little Timofeevka was yet more proof of his commitment.\n\nHe gestured for the men to come into his car. It'd be a tight squeeze, but they'd all manage fine."

 SAM.smuta.zykov.5.t: "A Gift to All of Russia"
 SAM.smuta.zykov.5.desc: "This was not a place that he recognised. Willing himself to creak open his eyes, Zykov woke in a field. How long had he been asleep? The sky was not the pale blanket he was used to - the oppressive grey smothering the land in its infinite indifference. Rolling clouds, seeming to almost trip over themselves, dominated the sky, which had now transformed into the colour and consistency of quicksilver. If one squinted, they could make out faces within the teeming mass, which evaporated almost as quickly as it came. They were - in equal measures - pained and terrified as if fighting for their lives as if they desperately wanted to reach out and scream:\n\n"Please, God... don't kill me..." Zykov muttered without noticing. Falling back to his knees, a sharp pain struck him as if his brain was slamming itself against the inside of his skull. White streaks stabbed into his vision, and he buckled wildly to stop what felt like the worst pain he had ever felt. He was dying and being born, all at the same time. Again and again and again and agai-\n\nThis was not a place he recognised. Zykov woke up with a start. Only the Sun remained. It was bigger, brighter than anything he had seen before like he was staring into the heart of the Universe. Despite the agony it caused, just looking at it, he could not look away. Why couldn't he look away? Daring a glance, the answer lay there. Billions of them lay there. Bodies, their limbs bent and stretched in inhuman proportions, latched onto him like they were holding him back from something. He was on a mountain full of them - a winding peak that had no bottom. Now he understood. They were dragging him down. It was the corner of his mind that was most familiar. This was a place he recognised after all.\n\nZykov fluttered his eyelids apart. He had a paper stuck to his face, which he delicately peeled off. It was that dream again. Looking at the document, he mouthed the words "Declaration of the Intention for the First National Russian Election." Groggily taking a pen, he signed his signature on the dotted line. Russia would have a bright future, and nobody would have to live in fear again. That chapter of their life was over."

 ### Bunyachenko events ###
 SAM_bunyachenko.1.t: "Out on the Field of Gold"
 SAM_bunyachenko.1.desc: "The President had had enough of paperwork for the day. His guard, as always, refused him the luxury of wandering the streets of the capital. Far better for his evening walks to be in the presidential palace's gardens. Gardens were a bit too grandiose a word, Bunyachenko thought, for the half finished assembly of shrubs and plants.\n\nWalking loops around the closed garden, the President's thoughts were free to wander beyond the confine of the park. Politics was a new career for him. A soldier's life had been his, after joining the red army as a teenager. Hard fighting in the plains of Ukraine, against the Whites and the Ukrainian National Republic. Bunyachenko had been free, then. He and his comrades, fighting for a new Russian nation, freed from archaic tsarism, fighting with the naivety of youth for a better future. After the civil war he had been deployed to Central Asia, fighting Basmachi rebels. Different plains, but the same endless blue sky. The President smiled bitterly. Freedom, as always, was wasted on the young.\n\nThe Reds had turned out no better than the Tsar. Endless court politics, as Bukharin's boyars ran roughshod over the country. Ukraine had not been spared their incompetence. Fields of gold, exploited by faceless bureaucrats. Neither had Bunyachenko. Yet he had kept fighting. Accused by the paranoid men in Moscow of failing to win a war their incompetence had caused to be doomed from the start. He had fought on then, naively, too. Being captured by the Germans had merely confirmed the Reds' paranoid accusations that he was a traitor.\n\nHe hated the Germans for destroying Russia. Truth be told, however, they had merely ended what the Bukharinists had begun. It felt good to know that the WRRF was dead and buried. Now all the President had to do was to destroy the Germans, kick over their own rotting structure. Perhaps then he would truly be free, innocent in the court of public opinion. Until then he had to keep following orders. Stuck in the presidential palace, Sergey Bunyachenko continued his evening walk round and round his prison's courtyard."
 SAM_bunyachenko.1.a: "He would not die a prisoner."

 SAM_bunyachenko.2.t: "Spheres of Influence"
 SAM_bunyachenko.2.desc: "The Japanese and the Zaibatsu emissaries carried themselves with the haughty air of kings as they descended onto the tarmac. Perhaps they expected a shelled-out runway and some surplus automobiles, flanked by vintage motorcycles in a discount motorcade.\n\nThey were received on fresh tarmac by Bunyachenko, flanked by the heads of Vyatka Metallurgical, IzhZla Concern, and VTB, wearing crisp suits cut from the finest Russian wool. A small band played the Japanese national anthem as Bunyachenko confidently shook the hands of the Japanese delegates before escorting them to a line of gleaming automobiles, surrounded by an honor guard.\n\nPerhaps they expected a ramshackle hovel, the cramped presidential palace of yet another Russian warlord with delusions of grandeur. And, had they wandered beyond the main streets, they might have been correct. But Bunyachenko left nothing to chance: the Japanese sun flag hung from freshly-installed lampposts, while the Japanese emissaries silently watched the meticulously cleaned and spotless cityscape roll past.\n\nThe Japanese were a people of order, of punctuality, of proper appearances. And they were arrogant - an opportunity Bunyachenko would not squander.\n\nMuch later, as Bunyachenko bade the Japanese good night after a sumptuous, extravagant banquet, the Mitsubishi representative laughed drunkenly to his colleagues, forgetting the presence of Bunyachenko's translator: "If only half the Sphere were as agreeable as these Russians!" At that moment, he knew that he had them."

He'd had reservations - how could the former German lapdogs claim to be saving Russia? - but they were clearly the winning side, and he'd be a fool not to join them.\n\nThat said, the weight of the ancient Kar98 in his hands hardly felt like winning, and he hadn't come all this way to fight with a German rifle. "Sergeant, how can I fight with this?" Pavel spat.\n\n"You will fight as the rest of us do, ryadovoy. With whatever you have, and whatever you can find. Now run the obstacle course."\n\nIncredulous, Pavel stood rock still. The sergeant rounded on him.\n\n"Do you think yourself so strong that you need no weapon?" In a heartbeat, the sergeant grabbed the rifle, yanking it away before using the momentum to flip Pavel to the ground and disarm him. "Do you feel so mighty now?"\n\nAfter a long, terrifying second, Pavel shook his head.\n\n"This gun will not shoot straight. It will jam. It will break before the year is done." The rifle jabbed at Pavel's ribs. "But it can still kill, and it has killed many who were stronger than you, who were equally helpless. And until you know our desperate struggle - of fighting from nothing with this butcher's tool - you will not be strong enough to save Russia.""

 SAM_bunyachenko.4.t: "A Familiar Evening Companion"
 SAM_bunyachenko.4.desc: "Again, he had gotten home too late to tuck his children into bed. The apartment was spacious, better than the refugee camp they had once dwelled in. Courtesy of the new republic. President Bunyachenko claimed to have nothing but respect for hard working Russians. Housing was a right for hardworking Russians, the former military man declared over and over in his speeches. As was education. The father saw his children's school books on the table, neatly stacked at the end of the day. Homeworks had been dutifully completed. Dmitry's penmanship was not great for a ten years old. But he had learned to read so fast. If only their mother could have seen all this. The small ones worked so hard.\n\nAt this hour of the day, his only companion was the bottle. A little drink, to soothe the day's pains. He had to take long hours, to keep his children fed, to keep qualifying for free apartments near the train station. The pay was good. What were a few aches at the end of the day? All of Russia was being rebuilt. All of Russia...\n\nThe man caught himself pouring a third glass. He put the bottle back in the keyboards, locked it with a key. It would not do for the little ones to try their father's medicine. The third glass went down easy, quenching his thirst for warmth.\n\nEveryone was working so hard. President Bunyachenko's economic miracle would leave his children a better nation. The father knew, hoped, that the President shared the workers' hard schedule. Many dismissed Bunyachenko as a traitor. The father knew better. All had done terrible things in the Rusisan Anarchy to survive. The father... No, better not follow that line of thought.\n\nThe President claimed things would get better, work shifts would get easier as the industry advanced. The father hoped they would. The daily glass of vodka had turned into two glasses. Three, recently. Burdens had to be carried. Perhaps his generation would be the last lost Rusisan generation. Better try to get some sleep."

 SAM_bunyachenko.5.t: "Rags to Riches"
 SAM_bunyachenko.5.desc: "Every morning, the Queen of the Refinery has a cup of coffee. Usually it's from Brazil, or Nicaragua, but the importers can get beans from the Sphere these days for an extra fee. She doesn't feel the need, though. When she was a girl, even a weak cup of black tea from the far south was a luxury. Fazenda coffee will suffice. As she sips, she hears the front door creak open downstairs. That would be the maid, three minutes early. Clearly yesterday's tongue-lashing got the job done.\n\nThe company sedan pulls up a half hour later. From her home-one of the new townhouses on a tree-lined promenade-the car passes rotting apartments and tin sheds. Many of her employees live here. She used to, too, back when she was one of the first woman engineers at Ukhta's main refinery. She slept on the floor, and her daughter slept on their couch. Now, her daughter goes to school in Samara. Every week, Yulechka writes a letter home to her mother. The uniforms at that school make her look quite sharp.\n\nAt the refinery, she marches through halls and across worksites, accompanied by the sycophants that she calls her staff. They supervise the visbrakers and catalytic crackers and pipelines that send oil from Ukhta to... well, to everywhere. The black insignia of Rosneft is emblazoned on storage tanks across Western Russia, after all. The Queen, in turn, supervises them. It's a good job. Everyone strives for a good job these days, especially since so few can get them. It gnaws at her, some days. The guilt. The feeling that she has betrayed something, someone. So tomorrow, as per usual, one of her accountants will go to those rotting apartments and tin sheds, and press notes into the hands of the poor.\n\nPerhaps they will buy a cup of coffee."

This isn't the first interview he's done, but his flight leaves in a week. The security official in front of him is making sure that the flight will be worth it.\n\n"And, Shura, what brings you to the Tokyo Institute of Technology? It's very prestigious, as you know."\n\nHe's prepared for this answer. Drilled on it for months, ever since the embossed envelope arrived at his family's apartment in Syzran. "I want to help build my country. Russia has been engulfed in war for far too long, and I want to build the bridges, roads, and dams that will tie us together in the future."\n\nThe official nods, flashes the tiniest hint of a smile. "And, Shura, what do you think of your government? I hear it's... well, it's so barbaric and oppressive!"\n\nHe's drilled for this, too. "President Bunyachenko wants what is best for the nation. I'm here to learn the skills that will help improve Russia, and that's what's much more important to me. Besides, I'd rather not talk about politics."\n\nThere's a bigger smile this time.\n\n"Thank you, Aleksandr. I think that we're all done here. Have a good semester.""

He had been the most incensed by Kolya falling into the furnace three weeks before, saying that they couldn't just stand by and watch, even after the managers had told them that it was a fool's errand.\n\nShe saw gentle Sofia, her sister in arms, both literal and figurative, who had tended to the bruises of the workers after the police had beaten the striking workers black and blue. Her limp legs daubed blood across the floor of the Vyatka steel mill.\n\nWhere was Aleksey? His diminutive stature masked the ferocity of his intelligence, as he had excoriated the Vyatka executive who had warned them that this was their last chance. She squinted at a mountain of bodies being piled near the furnace, and found his bullet-ridden corpse at the top.\n\nSo many dead, for Kolya. Her darling son, her only son, swallowed by that infernal furnace because the kombinats couldn't be assed to put up railings in their factories -\n\nA kick to her side. The cold pressure of a rifle barrel to her forehead. The blinding glare of a flashlight. "We've got a live one," the soldier called out.

Semyon's hand stopped.\n\n"How many?"\n\n"Forty-four dead, with three taken into custody. All the criminals have been accounted for and production has resumed." The aide coughed. "The operation was successful."\n\nSemyon pinched the bridge of his nose. "An entire shift dead. And production levels?"\n\n"Not back up to full capacity, unfortunately. But it was the most efficient way to remove the disruption; we'll have their replacements trained shortly."\n\n"And what happens when they go on strike?" Semyon slammed his palm on the desk. "Considering the cost and time to even bring the new ones up to scratch, it hardly strikes me as efficient."\n\n"And what do we do about the agitators and their demands?"

 SAM_bunyachenko.9.desc: "A knock came at Bunyachenko's door. "Enter." He commanded, glancing up from the pile of papers on his desk.\n\nEntering through the opening door was Constantine Kromiadi, a thin, older Greek with a small moustache, who had long been Bunyachenko's head of security in spite of his unassuming appearance- or perhaps because of it. "I came to speak with you about our... spy problem, for lack of a better term." He rasped.\n\n"Which one? The American, the Japanese, or the German one?" Bunyachenko asked in reply. Kromiadi let out a small chuckle, but stopped when he saw his boss wasn't laughing.\n\n"All of them, old friend." Kromiadi cleared his throat. "Though especially the German one. The Japanese and the Americans could be beneficial to us if they realize the strength of our forces and seek a partnership, but in any case they are manageable. The Germans, however, will never be our friends, as they've proven time and time again, yet they have the deepest connections amongst our forces, thanks to Oktan, that bastard."\n\nResting his head in his hand, Bunyachenko thought a moment. "So we must root them out, without hurting American and Japanese spies too much, and without alerting the men to our intentions so they don't begin thinking we've gone soft on the Americans and Japanese." After a silent moment, Bunyachenko continued. "I have full faith in your ability to handle it, but inform me immediately if you need additional resources. Oh, and one more thing. Between the Americans and the Japanese, Kromiadi, which do you think is more trustworthy for Russia?"\n\nKromiadi hesitated a moment, then nodded.

 SAM_bunyachenko.10.t: "Chasing the Sun"
 SAM_bunyachenko.10.desc: "The presidential palace had a certain glitz to it. The central wing, meant to impress foreign dignitaries, displayed arrays of artifacts and paintings gathered from all over free Russia. The late afternoon sun reflected off gilded furniture. It reflected from the mirror shine boots of smartly dressed soldiers of the army of national liberation, posted at regular intervals. It reflected from the mirrors. Guests unused to the effect often got dizzy from the endless radiance. They should have known better, reflected the President. In this accursed world, one rarely got better than half truths. Light only confirmed shadows, rather than dispel them.\n\nSergey Bunyachenko often paced the halls, away from his working office. What a contrast the central wing made to the President's more spartan quarters! The presidential office in particular was filled with neatly aligned filing cabinets. Golden baubles and other trinkets were for effete civilians. A thought came, unbidden, of Vlasov and his denuded office. The President sneered at the memory of Vlasov waiting for his death, his spirit broken.\n\nIn the distance the capital's lights were turning on one by one. Each day, more lights. Each day, more buildings. More cars. More homes, more factories. More of a future. The economic projections the President had just read hinted at the magnitude of what had been accomplished. Intelligence intercepts from the Pakt, the OFN and the CPS revealed the surprise, joy and consternation abroad at Russia's recovery.\n\nA pair of soldiers stood guard in the next hall. An odd pair, a youngster barely out of basic training, and an older man, from the Moskowien days. The kid was a tall lad. Young men like him all across Russia now had regular access to meat. Improved nutrition had helped them grow strong. They would make fine soldiers. The veteran next to him held his modern assault rifle wearily. His salute to the President was not as crisp as the youth's. Bunyachenko did not mind it too much. The old man had lived through it all, too. Bunyachenko returned their salute. Light and shadows surrounded the three soldiers as the sun continued its journey west."

 SAM.smuta.bunya.1.t: "Memories Repressed, Now Awoken"
 SAM.smuta.bunya.1.desc: "Sleep was something that refused to come, and Bunyachenko resigned himself to the fact that it wasn't going to change.\n\nWith a groan, he arose from his bed after several fruitless hours attempting to sleep, and rubbed his eyes, as he sat at the edge of his bed. Truthfully, he should have expected sleep would be impossible. The idea of rest in any context seemed laughable right now - and it wasn't simply because the Germans had cut off their supplies - effectively leaving them on their own.\n\nIt was more than that; it was something personal. That news brought memories; memories that he had tried to bury.\n\nMemories of the war; the unrelenting horror and terror as they fought the German bulwark. Memories of his time as a German prisoner of war, and the humiliation that accompanied it. Memories of being brought before a Nazi officer, who presented him a very simple offer - serve or die.\n\nHe'd accepted the deal the devil offered, if only so he could live. There hadn't been any more noble reason than that.\n\nMany emotions consumed him as the memories resurfaced; emotions of fear, loathing, and regret - but one which rose higher than all of them was anger. Some anger directed at himself - but greater fury directed towards the Germans for all that they'd done, and for using and discarding them so easily.\n\nBut perhaps this was an opportunity in disguise. Now they could break from the Germans completely. Now, perhaps, he could begin undoing the damage caused by the tyrants who had ruled before. Bunyachenko stood, and after some consideration, dressed for the day. There was work to do, and if he could not sleep, he had best get started."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.1.a: "Anger turned to purpose."

 SAM.smuta.bunya.2.t: "Charlatans and Frauds, Now Expelled"
 SAM.smuta.bunya.2.desc: "General Belyakov was a man who made a poor first impression. While ROA soldiers were held to certain physical standards, it seemed like Belyakov had been exempted. That he was noticeably larger and out of shape would have been bad enough, were it also not compounded by his unprofessionalism. Parts of his uniform were untucked, dirty, and wrinkled. Bunyachenko's opinion hadn't improved as the talk had continued.\n\n"My question is very simple," Bunyachenko rephrased his question a third time as they walked in front of a line of the Belyankov's soldiers, all of whom stood at attention. "When we commence operations, what is your contingency for coordinating with the Sixth and Fourth Divisions in the event of operational roadblocks?"\n\n"Well, sir, it's not an easy question to answer," Belyakov was sweating, and his voice was unsteady, knowing full well he didn't have an answer. "You see, it requires-"\n\nBunyachenko sighed, not in the mood to hear another rambling answer that betrayed his incompetence. By now he'd heard enough. He lifted a hand, cutting the general off as he looked at a nearby ROA captain who'd doubtless been listening. "Answer the question."\n\nThe man snapped to attention. "Sir, in the event of an offensive stalemate, we would entrench ourselves along the secondary fallback position by the river, and attempt to establish radio communications with the respective divisions. Encirclement mitigation would follow, should I continue, sir?"\n\n"No. And thank you, captain," Bunyachenko nodded in approval, returning his attention to the general. "You have no business holding command of these soldiers, General. How you gained this position, I do not know - but I will not have my men be led by one as incompetent as you." He stepped forward, and decisively removed the General's badge."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.2.a: ""General Belyakov, you are relieved of duty. Get out of my sight.""

 SAM.smuta.bunya.3.t: "Expected Oppression, Now Relief"
 SAM.smuta.bunya.3.desc: "The quotas had always been high at Dimitry's factory. It was just something that he, and everyone who worked in it, had come to expect. The quotas on their own weren't bad on their own - the work he could handle, and in fact he enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment as weapons rolled off the line.\n\nWhat he didn't like was that it was never enough.\n\nThe man the ROA had appointed as their overseer was a hard, harsh man who seemed more concerned with making their lives miserable, than actually making sure they did good work. They'd learned that whenever he left his office to walk the lines to just keep their heads down and work even harder.\n\nEvery day they just hoped that the man would just remain in his office. It was a prayer that was only answered sometimes. They'd all resigned themselves to the fact that he would be their overseer forever, until one day, he wasn't there anymore.\n\nDimitry and the rest of the workers were initially confused, until the man - a short, wiry man from a nearby city, and who seemed to have a far milder temperament - explained that he had been appointed to take over overseeing duties as part of some new policies from the government.\n\nThey had been cautious at first, but after a few days with this new overseer, they began to have their hope vindicated, and this new overseer he was far more lenient and respectful. He still expected the quotas - but that was something they were more than happy to fulfill.\n\nThey didn't know what had prompted this new President Bunyachenko to pursue these policies - but for the first time since Dimitry could remember, he felt that he could support this new Samaran leader."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.3.a: "Twists of fate one could not anticipate."

 SAM.smuta.bunya.4.t: "Condemnation Expected, Opportunity Offered"
 SAM.smuta.bunya.4.desc: "The cell was a cold, lonely place. All the same, Stanislav knew that it could be worse. Given the stories he'd heard of the ROA during his service, he'd honestly expected that his time on Earth would be short after his capture. Prisoners of war were often not treated well - especially ones who fell into the hands of a group that was known to have been supported by the Germans.\n\nHowever, despite his fears, things were... not what he'd expected.\n\nIt wasn't as though his treatment had been the pinnacle of hospitality - but his cell was relatively clean, if cold. Food was regular, if bland. The guards were dismissive, but not abusive. It didn't make a lot of sense. Had all of the rumors been wrong, or had something changed here recently?\n\nA commotion in the hall caught his attention, and Stanislav's eyes widened as he saw a ranking ROA officer, with a couple subordinates, approach the cell. Even more surprising was when he unlocked it, opening the cell door.\n\n"Lieutenant Stanislav Kosorukov," the officer's voice was gruff, but clear. "Your sentence has been commuted upon your consent to an immediate transfer to the Sixteenth ROA Division, in service of the legitimate Russian state under President Bunyachenko."\n\nStanislav blinked several times in confusion, unable to speak at first. Had there been a mistake? "I..." he coughed, clearing his voice. "I'm being freed, in return for military service?"\n\nThe officer nodded calmly. "Correct. Upon the direct orders of President Bunyachenko, all existing prisoners of war are to be evaluated, and if certain criteria are met, integrated into the service. Now, do you accept this offer?" It was a question he did not have to ponder for very long."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.4.a: ""I accept, sir. Where do I report?""

 SAM.smuta.bunya.5.t: "The Tyrants Shattered, Russia Ascendant"
 SAM.smuta.bunya.5.desc: "The sun was setting, and only a few rays of light illuminated the streets as Bunyachenko walked to his house. The work days were long, at least for now, but they were necessary. It was past time the people had someone who truly worked for them, and there were many who now relied upon him.\n\n"Excuse me, sir?"\n\nBunyachenko turned at the voice, seeing a man cautiously approach him. His escort moved in front of him, but Bunyachenko stopped them with a raised hand. The man was older, perhaps in his early forties, with a disheveled beard and hair - but who stood up straight, and with a voice didn't waver. Bunyachenko cocked his head, appraising him. "Yes, how can I help you?"\n\n"You already have," the man said. "My name is Lukyan, and only a few months ago I was on the streets. I had no future; I was struggling, and I expected I would die. You helped change that. Because of you, I found work at a factory. I have a place to live now, I can see a future. You saved my life, I would only like to shake your hand."\n\nA genuine smile crossed Bunyachenko's face. He stepped forward, and took the extended hand, shaking it firmly. "I'm glad to have helped. That is all I've tried to do."\n\nBoth men exchanged a few more words, with Bunyachenko promising to visit the factory he worked at in the future. After they parted ways, Bunyachenko entered his home, the smile still on his face.\n\nIt was one thing to hear, it didn't compare to seeing the lives changed in person. It was validating to know he was making a real difference, and that there were many who had been able to reclaim their lives because of him; many who now had hope in a better future. This, he knew, was only the beginning."
 SAM.smuta.bunya.5.a: "Tonight, he knew he would sleep soundly."
