 ### GER ###
 Espionage_Gehlen: "Reinhard Gehlen"
 Espionage_Gehlen_Desc: "The greatest spymaster of the Cold War, the man responsible for victory in the shadows of World War Two, staunch supporter of the Reich against Bolshevists and Himmlerites alike - this is the reputation Reinhard Gehlen has carefully forged around himself, no matter what foreign eyes may say to the contrary.\n\n'Reinhard the Fox' or 'Kleiner Fuchs', as he goes by these days, is a man of many connections and accomplishments. His strong enmity with Heinrich Himmler since the days of Fremde Heere Ost and ambition to unify the German swamp of intelligence agencies into one led him to this very point, as the President of the Reichsnachrichtendienst.\n\nYet, just as in the Second World War, Germany is in danger - and just as Fremde Heere Ost was not sufficient to Gehlen then, the Reichsnachrichtendienst is only a stepping stone for him. It would be wise to not underestimate the Fox and his ambition."
 Espionage_Gehlen_BOR: "Reinhard Gehlen"
 Espionage_Gehlen_BOR_Desc: "The greatest spymaster of the Cold War, the man responsible for victory in the shadows of World War Two, staunch supporter of the Reich against Bolshevists and Himmlerites alike - this is the reputation Reinhard Gehlen has carefully forged around himself, no matter what foreign eyes may say to the contrary.\n\n'Reinhard the Fox' or 'Kleiner Fuchs', as he goes by these days, is a man of many connections and accomplishments. His strong enmity with Heinrich Himmler since the days of Fremde Heere Ost and ambition to unify the German swamp of intelligence agencies into one led him to this very point, as the Chief of the OrPo.\n\nYet, just as in the Second World War, Germany is in danger - and just as Fremde Heere Ost was not sufficient to Gehlen then, the OrPo is only a stepping stone for him. It would be wise to not underestimate the Fox and his ambition."

 Espionage_Wessel: "Gerhard Wessel"
 Espionage_Wessel_Desc: "There is no man who has influenced the German intelligence community as much as Reinhard Gehlen, and no man who aided him more than Gerhard Wessel. Friends and colleagues since the days of Fremde Heere Ost, Wessel soon distinguished himself as a man of iron stoicism, yet eloquent demeanor and sharp mind. Too sharp even for his former friend, in the end.\n\nFar from an ideologue, Wessel's leading principle is safety and stability for the Reich and the German people. This also means doing away with the Reichsnachrichtendienst's nature as a shady cabal it gained under Gehlen, instead transforming it into a service that is truly determined to protect not only the Führer or the Party but Germans as a whole.\n\nIn removing Gehlen from his control over the Reichsnachrichtendienst, the Reich gained - and the Führer, perhaps, lost. It remains to be seen if Wessel's loyalty to the people may bring him into conflict with the Führer."

 Espionage_Kaltenbrunner: "Ernst Kaltenbrunner"
 Espionage_Kaltenbrunner_Desc: "My duty grants me power. My power grants me strength. My strength reigns above all, and shall oppress all those who threaten me now.\n\nThe appeal to law and order drove many within Germany to support National Socialism in their nation, and now, the Reich has used its resources to ensure that the law, no matter how terrible it may be, will be upheld. Ernst Kaltenbrunner stands as such a figure, coming from a family of lawyers and carrying that position to its most dastardly ends in enforcing National Socialism within his home of Austria, as it became consumed by Adolf Hitler's Reich. Having been a dedicated friend of Adolf Eichmann since birth, he extensively collaborated with both Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich and the Schutzstaffel, his ascent within the organization began, as his architecture of the Final Solution began. Becoming an operating inspector of the KZ-Lagers of the German Reich, death flowed from the fingertips of the Austrian to all those deemed unworthy by the German Reich." #NOTE: stolen from his Heydrich bio, might request an edit or something more fitting for this

 Espionage_Muller: "Heinrich Müller"
 Espionage_Muller_Desc: "The Chief of the Ordnungspolizei, Heinrich Müller, has always surrounded himself in a mysterious air of apoliticism. Within seven years of the Third Reich's birth, this cold and calculating officer had evolved from Head of the Munich Political Police Department to Chief of the Gestapo, controlling the secret police of the Reich with ruthless efficiency.\n\nDespite being a longtime member of the SS, Müller was quick to side with Bormann and the Conservative wing of the NSDAP. Whether he quietly aligns with the tenets of orthodox National Socialism, or simply considered Bormann to provide the most stability, is a matter of contention. For Bormann, it matters not. As long as the Orpo Chief remains a tenacious functionary and continues to serve the German state, the Führer will trust him to fulfil his duty."

 ### USA ###
 Espionage_Hoover: "J. Edgar Hoover"
 Espionage_Hoover_Desc: "Presidents come and go, but J. Edgar Hoover remains. An institution in his own right, the inaugural Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has continuously served as head of America's highest investigatory agency since the 1920s. Hoover has cultivated a reputation as America's sheriff, a national policeman with neatly dressed government men deputized to identify, investigate, and apprehend criminals across North and South America. Be they gangsters in Chicago, klansmen in Georgia, terrorists in Boston, or spies in Port-au-Prince, Director Hoover and his Bureau ensure no threat remains outside the law for long.\n\nAmong the many responsibilities consolidated around the Director are intelligence and counter-espionage within the United States and other American nations. What started as a domestic fact-finding section has become a branch of the FBI, the Special Intelligence Service, for gathering intelligence and arresting spies within the United States and its neighboring nations. Every US embassy in North and South America has an SIS detachment, with or without the host nation's knowledge, working to keep Hoover informed with the best intelligence information. While not projecting the infamous boldness of CIA operations, competition between the FBI and the CIA has led to the SIS opening a section for special operations and planning.\n\nWith a tendency towards partisanship and a domineering personality betraying his manicured national image, Hoover is a hypocrite. His contempt for nonwhites, his vanity, his obfuscation, and his media connections always boost his popularity when needed. With a vast network of political ties and international media connections, Hoover is secure in remaining Director for the rest of his life."
 Espionage_FBI_Vacant: "Vacant"
 Espionage_FBI_Vacant_Desc: "For the first time in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 40-year history, the Directorship is vacant. Bureau leadership thought little about what would happen "after Hoover" because he had intended to work himself into the grave. Hoover's leadership was a ubiquitous institution of the FBI, and his death left an aimless administration and instilled a great deal of uncertainty about the Bureau's future. Long-time Deputy Director Clyde Tolson is the nominal leader of the Bureau, but just who the President will appoint to fill the void of J. Edgar Hoover remains to be seen.\n\nWhile Hoover's death has paralyzed some Bureau sections, others, including the Special Intelligence Service, continue to operate their primary function: gathering intelligence and arresting spies within the United States and its neighboring nations. Every US embassy in North and South America has an SIS detachment, with or without the host nation's knowledge, working to gather and share intelligence with FBI leadership. The SIS also works with military intelligence to support covert actions against American countries, from influencing politics with arrests and extraditions to supporting regime change. \n\nThough he may have been its inaugural Director, J. Edgar Hoover's death will not kill the FBI, which, as it awaits its next Director, remains a functioning machine of federal investigation and intelligence. The personalism of the FBI under Hoover was real, but that obedience died with Hoover and left a Bureau eager for a new Director with fresh ideas to re-mold it. "
 Espionage_Dulles: "Allen Dulles"
 Espionage_Dulles_Desc: "Long before becoming synonymous with American espionage, Allen Welsh Dulles was a lawyer who served the State Department in many European postings. Seeing firsthand the creation of the Nazi Empire in Europe convinced him American isolationism - in any sense of the word - was impossible in the face of world desiring tyrants. Serving as the link between the OSS and the anti-Hitler resistance in Germany during the war, he was not dissuaded from this view as he learned more and more of the nightmare of Europe.\n\nReturning to the States, he criticized the intelligence agencies of the United States as being unable to collect intelligence from enemy nations and proposed to centralize the agencies around the CIA. The Dulles Report sent shockwaves around Washington, as he put the blame for these issues at the feet of the management of the agencies. The CIA then brought him onboard as the director of covert operations, before he became the director of the CIA itself."
 Espionage_Helms: "Richard Helms"
 Espionage_Helms_Desc: "The termination of the OSS in 1945 was not the end of the story for people in its ranks like Richard Helms. One of the agents centered on intelligence in Central Europe, he found himself with a tremendous opportunity when his organization was merged into the CIA. Handling a variety of operations within the agency, Helms found himself rising quickly through the ranks, and now it's his turn to run the company.\n\nA dedicated believer in human intelligence, Helms places a premium on information gathering and defense against enemy agents. He is far more skeptical of the value of covert activities than others may be. However, he firmly believes in the value of the organization to coax world affairs. Mostly to the benefit and security of the United States."
 Espionage_Bunker: "Laurence E. Bunker"
 Espionage_Bunker_Desc: "If anyone knows what a failure of intelligence looks like, it's Laurence Eliot Bunker. Arriving on the Pacific theater as an aide to senior officers, including General MacArthur, he saw firsthand what could come of an underhanded plot against an unaware nation. The disaster of Pearl Harbor, and the expulsion of America from the Philippines convinced him America could never allow an international plot to destroy it come to fruition again.\n\nOne of the most dedicated individuals to protecting the United States from enemies foreign and domestic, Bunker is now in a position to hunt down the nefarious schemes of the world against the American people. Long has he seen the warning signs that others missed or wanted to ignore. But now, the CIA is ready to blow the lid off what the enemies of freedom are trying to do to this great nation."
 Espionage_Taylor: "Maxwell Taylor"
 Espionage_Taylor_Desc: "Anyone who is about to jump feet first into the middle of enemy territory and tasked to do the impossible is going to want as much and as accurate information as possible. Maxwell Taylor knows this as much as anyone else. In charge of the 101st Airborne Division from Europe to Little Rock, Taylor has been all that he could be in the US Army. And now he's tasked with making sure his country always will have the drop on their enemies.\n\nFocused on the tactical and strategic benefits of special operations, Taylor knows its not only the lives of American soldiers that rely on accurate intelligence, but the lives of their allies fighting for freedom. It's his goal to ensure that every warrior for liberty is given the benefits of the world's greatest intelligence group. Everyone, from the Army Ranger to the African Militiaman to the Oceanic Freedom Fighter, now has General Taylor and all the minds of Langley behind him."
 Espionage_Brown: "George Brown"
 Espionage_Brown_Desc: "In war, the greatest sin of all is to be complacent. General George Scratchley Brown knew far too many men in the Eighth Air Force who lost their lives in an instant as a good mission went bad. Expecting and preparing for the worst was the difference between being washed out of the plane with a hose or becoming a senior officer. And just like those days in Europe, Brown is stepping up to complete the mission and bring his people home.\n\nHe is under no illusions about how hard the job will be. The allies America works with won't put in the work to relieve the country of its burden. It falls to the CIA to close the gap between free and slave worlds. And once again, there will be no room for complacency against the German Reich and Japanese Empire. If America ever thinks it is winning this cold war, it will lose."
 Espionage_Cooper: "John S. Cooper"
 Espionage_Cooper_Desc: "Many heads of intelligence have come from some sort of military background, but for Senator Cooper, his time as an Army lawyer is not why he wanted to become director. After his time in the military, he ran for congress, serving his home state of Kentucky. Making friends across the aisle and keeping a bipartisan streak, he was awarded with diplomatic postings the world over. Now the Kentucky lawyer is bringing a new way of thinking to Langley.\n\nSenator Cooper doesn't believe the United States can win the Cold War by itself, even with the CIA behind it. Just like America, the CIA must work with and respect the other nations of the world, and bring their assets to bear against the enemy. His focus on inter-OFN cooperation and standing in Washington has convinced DC this is the way to go. But it remains to be seen how his unorthodox strategy will work in the black chambers of the CIA..."
 Espionage_Bissell: "Richard Bissell"
 Espionage_Bissell_Desc: "Sun Tsu said what enabled the wise king and good general to achieve things beyond the feat of ordinary men was foreknowledge of the enemy's disposition. And this foreknowledge was only gained through the use of other men, not spirits or experience. Richard Mervin Bissell Jr. took this quote and put it at the heart of the CIA. For there was nothing the enemy could do if it was known well in advance.\n\nHis U-2 program was only the start, giving America the cutting edge it needed to expose the axis. Now that Bissell is in charge, this masterpiece of material intelligence collection is going to be the model for his programs. Any information, by any means necessary is his goal, regardless of diplomatic niceties. The Germans and Japanese decided to seek continental Empires full of slaves, they gave up the right to live without the Eagle watching their every move."
 Espionage_Jackson: "Henry M. Jackson"
 Espionage_Jackson_Desc: "Henry Martin "Scoop" Jackson seemed to have hit his ceiling in Washington. Failing to gain the presidency despite three successive runs in 1960, '64, and '68, it seemed the honorable senator from Washington State's lifetime of public service would end in the senate. But that was before another longtime fixture in the Progressive wing of the NPP gave him an opportunity to make a mark on the world in Virginia.\n\nPresident Harrington put a cold warrior in the tank, and the CIA is ready to pounce. After years in the senate talking about what America should do for the world, Jackson is in a place to do it. Every man and woman in Langley knows they are fighting for nothing less than the liberation of the world. If Germania and Tokyo don't have the fear of God in their hearts, they will when they see the company come for them by any means possible."
 Espionage_Schlesinger: "James Schlesinger"
 Espionage_Schlesinger_Desc: "The son of Jewish immigrants in New York, James Rodney Schlesinger was especially susceptible to the pain of watching the great crusade against Nazi tyranny. Even though he would later convert, he never forgot the shame of the defeat of the United States by its enemies. And when he was tapped to become director, he found himself finally in a position that America would never be forced to its knees ever again.\n\nThe United States is back, holding a diplomatic strength brought by a resurgent armed forces. The CIA under Schlesinger is another arm of this effort. Through the collection of intelligence, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines will have another leg up when the shooting starts. And maybe the new second generation Americans will sleep soundly, protected from emperors and dictators abroad."
 Espionage_Knoche: "E. Henry Knoche"
 Espionage_Knoche_Desc: "A former sports star walked into the CIA in 1953, asking for a job. He had no experience in operations or clandestine intelligence, only some college basketball trophies and a stint in the navy. His qualifications were speaking a language nobody needed (Russian) and a Chinese dialect nobody cared about (Fuzhou). He should have been laughed out of the building. Yet Enno Henry Knoche now runs the organization. How did it happen?\n\nThose who know Director Knoche realize his bare resume doesn't tell the story of the man's merits. A dedicated worker who handled some of the most important tasks of the management of the CIA, Knoche is well known at the intelligence briefs of the President, and has been running day-to-day operations for the longest time. It just goes to show experience can be padded, and resumes can be inflated, but there's nothing that beats talent."
 Espionage_Bush: "George Bush"
 Espionage_Bush_Desc: "George Herbert Walker Bush is no stranger to impossible tasks. Many felt taking on Texas and the Democratic Party machine there was a political death sentence. But Bush put the cracks in the stone and caused the one party system there to waver. Now Bush is no longer a party man. He serves his country on the national stage, which has slapped a well done two dollar flank steak right on his plate.\n\nThe CIA is reeling from many explosive and damaging revelations that threaten to overwhelm it. In front of this Gulf Hurricane is Director Bush, sent to talk it out of damaging the organization. It's his job to make sure the Agency survives the coming storm and handle the Public Relations for it. And the Public Relations for an agency that eschews relations with the public are gonna need him to get on the horse..."
 Espionage_Tower: "John Tower"
 Espionage_Tower_Desc: "Many people thought they knew what they were getting with Director John Goodwin Tower. A staunch conservative who went against civil rights as a leading opponent, many felt he would be another American exceptionalist willing to mess over the rest of the world for the supposed good of the United States. But they were wrong.\n\nTower's CIA is not the one of assassinations and coups, of inhumane experiments and destruction of civil liberties. That Agency is, has to be, gone. This is going to be a clean organization which operates on pride and not ends that justify the means. If it can't be done the right way, it won't be done at all.\n\nThe American people deserve no less."
 Espionage_Copeland: "Miles Copeland Jr."
 Espionage_Copeland_Desc: "Who is Miles Copeland Jr.? After a rushed confirmation hearing orchestrated by a defiant Administration, that is the question haunting the Washington security establishment. Much of Copeland's life and career is shrouded in mystery. Much of what he does admit to seems fantastical and outlandish.\n\nHere, at least, are the known knowns: Miles Copeland Jr. was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1916. He attended, and then dropped out of, the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. Copeland then either became a popular jazz musician in the New York night club scene or held a series of insignificant sales jobs. He joined the US Army in 1940. There, he talked himself into a room with famous intelligence officer William "Wild Bill" Donovan and was recruited to serve as a special agent. Donovan then sent him across Europe, either to be rid of the man or to "root out Axis spies." At the end of the War, Copeland received commendations for services, which are still-classified, and was sent to the Middle East and Caribbean by the CIA to conduct information-gathering, that is still classified. In the early 1960s, he left the CIA for the world of television, radio, and journalism and became a popular feature in the National Review for his pieces deriding the foreign policy establishment.\n\nWhile all can agree that Copeland is outstandingly intelligent, friendly, and charismatic, the gaps in his biography have alarmed activists and transparency advocates. Never before has the CIA been run by a man so unknown, so eager to muddle fact with fiction. With a smile on his face and a jaunty tune on his lips, Copeland has sworn to support Schlafly's campaign to root out the "kingmakers." Just what this means and why he supports it remains one of the many known unknowns of his life."
 Espionage_Lovestone: "Jay Lovestone"
 Espionage_Lovestone_Desc: "Many people were surprised when Jay Lovestone, the former leader of CPUSA, was nominated by Gus Hall as leader of the Central Intelligence Agency. After his purge from the party in the mid-1940s, few are as surprised as Jay Lovestone himself.\n\nJay Lovestone was born in Belarus to a Lithuanian Jewish family. He immigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with his father, a rabbi turned synagogue caretaker, and settled in Manhattan's Lower East Side. His experience of dislocation and his exposure to New York's vibrant political life led him to join a variety of different leftist and socialist groups. In 1919, he decided to drop out of New York University Law School to devote himself full-time to the communist cause, which seemed on the verge of a major breakthrough internationally. His unrelenting support for Nikolai Bukharin helped him to ascend through the ranks of the CPUSA and eventually become its leader.\n\nAlas, the dream of socialism was not meant to be. The death of the Soviet Union and the triumph of the Axis led to crises both personal and professional. Lovestone was expelled for "deviationism" and began a long period of personal reflection. He came to privately denounce the mainstream communist movement as a totalitarian conspiracy with a goal of world conquest and became a willing informant to the CIA on communist labor-union activities. He operated a global network of informants for America's security state.\n\nIf the new president is aware of this background, he has not revealed it. Instead, he has held up his confirmation of Lovestone as proof of the communist movement burying old grudges and unifying to address "the real issues facing America." Lovestone now sits in an office in Langley, terrified by both his subordinates—who he regards as dangerous, prep school idiots—and his boss Gus Hall—who Lovestone fears may soon call for a global revolution that Lovestone wants no part in."
 Espionage_Vacant: "Vacant"
 Espionage_Vacant_Desc: "Something has gone wrong in Washington.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, there has been an extended vacancy in the post of Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. This could be for a number of reasons: Congress could be consumed by gridlock and unable to function; a proposed nominee could have been found lacking; or, perhaps most troubling for the country's warhawks, an appointment might not have been made at all. The president might have elected to keep the position vacant.\n\nWhatever the reason, this extended sede vacante has initiated a long unraveling of the American intelligence community. While career staff might be able to keep the lights on and maintain their missions around the globe, the absence of political leadership leaves the Agency rudderless. No new operations can be authorized and no new insights from the Agency can be gleaned. Instead, a deep sense of dread has started to grow as Americans become increasingly aware of the mounting threats across the globe and the long reach of Japan and Germany's own spy programs."

 ### Region Descriptions ###
 ## GER
 Espionage_Map_NA_Desc_GER: "As the seat of the §MUnited States§!, the §gReich's§! greatest adversary, §MNorth America§! is a region of key importance for the agency. Establishing, maintaining and expanding surveillance and operations there is integral to the §gReich's§! future."
 Espionage_Map_CA_Desc_GER: "Some refer to §YCentral America§! and the §YCaribbean§! as the §MUnited States'§! backyard - a very narrow and ignorant view on a complex powderkeg of subterfuge. Establishing a foothold in this region will not only allow §gGermany§! to limit §MAmerican§! influence in this part of the globe, but also to tap into the vast underground market forming there."
 Espionage_Map_SA_Desc_GER: "§RSouth America§! may appear sleepy to a naive outside observer, but in truth contains several opportunities the §gReich§! could use to establish a foothold in the Americas. Striking these contacts and furthering our surveillance in this region will serve this purpose."
 Espionage_Map_EU_Desc_GER: "Divided between the §gReich§! and her dependencies in the §gEinheitspakt§!, §GItaly§! and their former allies in the §OTriumvirate§!, the §RBritish Isles§!, and §MScandinavia§!. Maintaining control over the §xOld Continent§! is integral to §gGermany's§! future."
 Espionage_Map_RU_Desc_GER: "What was once known as §GRussia§! has become a quarrelling nightmare of warlords and violence, largely due to §gour actions§!. It has become clear, however, that the §GRussian people§! will no longer let themselves stay divided. Influencing what becomes of them will be paramount to §gGermany's§! future."
 Espionage_Map_AF_Desc_GER: "§OAfrica§! has been a colonial plaything for centuries now, although that situation is now beginning to change as even the §gReich's§! holdings are crumbling. With §GItalian§! and §OIberian§! influence in the north and §MAmerican§! influence in the south, the §ODark Continent§! is a difficult but potentially extremely worthwhile target."
 Espionage_Map_ME_Desc_GER: "The §LMiddle East§! is a melting pot of international politicking, from the §GItalian§!-owned oil fields to §BSaudi§! subterfuge and §gGermany's§! own business interests in §OIran§!. Expanding the §gReich's§! foothold in this economic anchor of the world is paramount."
 Espionage_Map_EA_Desc_GER: "Under the brutal rule of the §REmpire of Japan§!, the §BRepublic of China§! and much else in §Yeastern Asia§! has become a new powerhouse of industry and economy in the world. While immensely beneficial to the §RJapanese§!, the §BChinese people§! are inching towards freedom. With adequate help, they could become an invaluable asset to §gGermany§!."
 Espionage_Map_SEA_Desc_GER: "The §REmpire of Japan§! has established §GSouth East Asia§! as its resource boon, doing so with brutal oppression and slavery in all but name. The people of this region, much like their fellow oppressed peoples in §YEast Asia§!, will not tolerate this for long. §gGermany§! can profit from any situations that may develop here."
 Espionage_Map_OC_Desc_GER: "§POceania§! is the §MOrganization of Free Nation's§! front against the §RCo-Prosperity Sphere§!. §OAustralia§! has been turned into a fortress in the process, with their §MAmerican§! allies using it as a staging point against the §RJapanese§!. There may be ways to increase §gGermany's§! influence in this area."

 ## USA
 Espionage_Map_NA_Desc_USA: "§MNorth America§! is home to the §mUnited States§! and its immediate neighbors and represents the veritable center of the free world. In the interest of maintaining the republic's security, high influence in Canada and at home in the United States is essential to victory in the Cold War."
 Espionage_Map_CA_Desc_USA: "Per the §DMonroe Doctrine§!, the §mUnited States§! assumes responsibility for protecting the many nations of §YCentral America§! from outside aggression. This does not guarantee support for the §mAmerican§! sphere, and increasingly nations are turning towards §gGermany§! and §eJapan§! for support. If the §mUnited States§! wants to maintain dominance in the New World, a strong influence in this region is necessary."
 Espionage_Map_SA_Desc_USA: "§RSouth America§! is home to a diverse community of nations with interests not always aligned with the §mUnited States§!. The §mUnited States§! must ward off foreign influences in the region to secure §mAmerican§! influence. Should §gGermany§! or §eJapan§! establish a foothold in §RSouth America§!, it could mean the beginning of the end for §mAmerican§! dominance in the New World."
 Espionage_Map_EU_Desc_USA: "Divided between the §gReich§! and her dependencies in the §gEinheitspakt§!, §GItaly§! and their former allies in the §OTriumvirate§!, the §RBritish Isles§! and §MScandinavia§!. European freedoms have been few under §gGerman§! domination, but §mAmerican§! influence has the potential to unseat autocracy in the Old World."
 Espionage_Map_RU_Desc_USA: "What was once known as §GRussia§! has become a quarreling nightmare of warlords and violence, largely due to the actions of the §gGerman Reich§!. It has become clear that the §GRussian people§! will no longer let themselves stay divided, and the §mUnited States§! would be wise to shore up influence in the new §GRussia§!."
 Espionage_Map_AF_Desc_USA: "§OAfrica§! has been a colonial plaything for centuries, although that situation is now beginning to change. Instability in §gGerman§!, §GItalian§!, §QFrench§!, and §YSpanish§! holdings presents a prime opportunity for the §mUnited States§! to influence the continent."
 Espionage_Map_ME_Desc_USA: "The §LMiddle East§! is a melting pot of international politicking, from the §GItalian§!-owned oil fields to superpower encroachment into Saudi Arabia and Iran. Increasing §mAmerican§! influence in this economic anchor of the world is paramount."
 Espionage_Map_EA_Desc_USA: "The §eJapanese§! core territories are the center from which the §eEmpire's§! §RCo-Prosperity Sphere§! extends and form the nucleus of the §mUnited States§!' most pressing Cold War opponent. Whether §mAmerican§! body politics pursues antagonism or rapprochement with the titan of §GEast Asia§!, a strong intelligence network in §eJapan§! and the §BRepublic of China§! is essential to informed policy decisions."
 Espionage_Map_SEA_Desc_USA: "The §REmpire of Japan§! has established §GSouth East Asia§! as its resource boon, doing so with brutal oppression and slavery in all but name. Much like their fellow oppressed peoples in §YEast Asia§!, the people of this region will not tolerate this for long. South East Asia forms the core of §eJapan's§! §RCo-Prosperity Sphere§!, and the §mUnited States§! can benefit from operating there."
 Espionage_Map_OC_Desc_USA: "§POceania§! is the §MOrganization of Free Nation's§! primary front against the §RCo-Prosperity Sphere§!. The defense of Australia and New Zealand is critical to the §mOFN§!'s integrity, and §POceania§! remains a critical launching point for operations against the §eEmpire of Japan§!. Ensuring strong §mAmerican§! influence in this region is essential."

 ### Tech Tooltips ###
 ## GER
 Espionage_GER_Tech_0_Desc: "'Fernmelde- und Elektronische Aufklärung' - known in the Anglophone world as §WSignals Intelligence (SIGINT)§! - is the art of intercepting signals for intelligence-gathering. Already having played a significant role during the Second World War, the importance of SIGINT has only increased since then. Now that the world finds itself in a Cold War between Germania and her jealous adversaries, retrieving intelligence from them is of paramount importance. We will invest into a massive modernization campaign of our SIGINT capabilities - soon, the Reich can listen in on everyone, everywhere."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_1_Desc: "The Sonderblindfunkdienst, or §WSpecial Binary Telegraph System Service§!, is a part of the proposed Schnellbahn system initiative in the agency. Transmitting information world wide to agents in form of Morse code is only one part of the systems proposed - repeated, encoded messages on all frequencies under the Schnellinformationsdienst and Harpune radio receivers for our agents across the globe is the full span of it. An ambitious project, but one that is desperately needed in the face of the state of the world."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_2_Desc: "Germany won the space race in 1962, yet she still has to make use of the full breadth of opportunities the 'Final Frontier' offers. It does not take a genius to realize the potential in space-based surveillance of the Reich's enemies - far out of range of their ability to intervene, and as such able to observe them in peace. Equipped with 24-inch focal length cameras and several thousand feet of film, these probes will be launched into space and take photographs of our enemies' lands, to be recovered following mission end by plane."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_3_Desc: "Second generation transmitters working on Band IV UHF frequencies, the §W31211-5 Covert RF Listening Devices§!, or bugs, are the latest in design. Intended for overhearing conversations in ordinary rooms, these devices can be hidden in most pieces of furniture with relative ease. Despite that and its simple make-up, the 31211-5 bugs carry a powerful and sensitive audio-amplifier and dynamic microphone able to record conversations easily and clearly. No secrets will remain hidden from the Reich anymore."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_4_Desc: "A one-time tape-based cipher machine developed by §BSiemens§!, the M-190 is a mixer-class device. It is not classified - that is because the device itself is not enough to crack the cipher. What is needed to solve any cipher with the machine is an appropriate §WOne-Time-Tape§!, which is always destroyed right at the end of the information exchange. Intended for usage with a teleprinter device, the M-190 can operate both offline and online. A significant advancement on all accounts from the Second World War's T-43."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_5_Desc: "In a world of infiltration and espionage, a fist to the face is sometimes still the best solution when it comes to a life or death situation. Military, espionage, even police forces across the world have adopted martial arts or even developed their own in response. The art of deftly taking control over an enemy in close quarters combat can prove useful in many situations, ones our agents are likely to experience at one point or another as well. If so, all they must do is try to remember some of the basics of Nahkampf..."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_6_Desc: "The UFT-421 is a body-wearable covert transceiver for concealed use. Hidden under the agent's cloths, the device can be operated with a remote control unit; a simplex radio with four channels, it is poised to be an indispensible tool for undercover agents both in and outside Germany."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_7_Desc: "The Robot Star 50 is an almost ordinary clockwork camera, distinguished particularly by its compactness and being able to take fifty exposures. However, when modified appropriately, the camera displays another key feature - it is exceptionally silent. Being so small, so silent and able to take so many pictures makes the modified design of the RS 50 a very promising tool for covert agents."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_8_Desc: "Strictly seen a development by the Wehrmacht to be adopted by us for our field agents, Flecktarn B camouflage is a computer-aided evolution of the camouflage patterns developed before and during the Second World War. Optically similar to the patterns used by the SS at the time, it can be adapted to different environments and is certain to bring about considerable aid in the concealment of our field agents."
 Espionage_GER_Tech_9_Desc: "Research suggests that the mental process of constructing a lie is more complex than telling the truth. Should this be the case, then clouding the minds of potential liars should make it harder for them to lie - therefore, perhaps, make it more likely for them to resort to telling the truth. One such way to cloud their minds would be through barbiturates, the same ones used as general anesthetics, applied in just the right dosage. It is not quite the "truth serum" one could hope to have, but it is close enough."

 ## USA
 Espionage_USA_Tech_0_Desc: "Aerial reconnaissance is expensive, prone to interception and requires hundreds of man-hours in planning. In contrast, pigeons come in flocks, blend with any environment and easily follow a trained handler's orders. A miniature camera with a timed delay, strapped onto a carrier pigeon with a flight path, will deliver overhead photographs of higher fidelity than any U2's - and at a fraction of its cost, to boot."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_1_Desc: "A "belly buster" is an informal term for the Company's standard issue hand-powered drill. As the name suggests, the drill is operated by turning its crank while its bit is pressed firmly against a surface by the user's stomach. An experienced operator can bore holes onto wood and masonry by their lonesome, preparing the unsuspecting adjacent room for a listening device's rapt attention."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_2_Desc: "Progress may introduce new methods and equipment to the age-old art of espionage, but equally old 'tricks of the light' still find use within a Company operative's repertoire. Taking the expression more literally are specially designed mirrors which unveil text and imagery when viewed at a certain angle. Such devices allow agents to access information stored without drawing eyes; the fair lady may just be inspecting her makeup, or the vain man his insufferable mug."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_3_Desc: "There are more cigarettes sold each year than there have been humans alive. Excepting uncivilized backwaters, war-torn hellholes and no-smoking zones, any man would be forgiven for carrying a pack of Lucky Strikes on his pockets. Our agents exploit the benefit of the doubt by fitting a miniature camera into the pack. The cancer sticks themselves are put to better use as either barter good or bribe."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_4_Desc: "A map, a compass and the Mk.1 Eyeball are all an agent needs to travel far, both literally and figuratively. But space is a luxury behind enemy lines; there a compass's metal bulk may mean the difference between relative health and malarial sickness. Small enough to fit a buttonhole, miniature compasses solve this dilemma handily."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_5_Desc: "Operatives disguised as gentlemen of high breeding often encounter difficulties receiving instructions in social gatherings, where listeners are plentiful and suspicions easily raised. They shall look no further for remedies than radios specially designed to resemble a pipe cigar's narrow stem. These ingenious devices deliver sound vibrations from the mandible to the ear canal - hardly an act worth scrutinizing amidst the haze of song and dance."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_6_Desc: "One man leaves behind his rubbish, and another comes to pick it up: this is the operating principle behind the dead man's drop, among the oldest techniques known to tradecraft. With the prevalence of film as a storage medium, modern spies now insert camera rolls into small, innocuous, waterproof spikes for their contacts to retrieve at an agreed-upon date and location."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_7_Desc: "As the decades have proved, gentlemen do, in fact, read each other's mail. More than a few take the extra step and read each other's lips. The Company deflects nosy busybodies with suspiciously ample free time on their hands with ultrasonic motion sensors; should their invisible pulse catch intruders unaware, gentlemen will know to swap sensitive conversations with the most idling chatter."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_8_Desc: "The CIA owes its extensive global reach in large part to native groups resisting Germany and Japan's pernicious grip. Such cooperation, however, entails frequent communication with contacts barely capable of speaking or writing English. To assist them in identifying enemy assets, our technicians have devised a contraption depicting vehicles' silhouettes adjacent to knob-adjustable numbers. Operators on the ground or on plane would then receive these counters' output as bursts of radio signal."
 Espionage_USA_Tech_9_Desc: "For anyone else, it is a 1921 silver dollar, with Lady Liberty's smiling bust plastered on sheen 90% pure and an inch and half wide.\n\nFor the Company, it is a state secret bought a dollar per. Inflation, am I right?"
