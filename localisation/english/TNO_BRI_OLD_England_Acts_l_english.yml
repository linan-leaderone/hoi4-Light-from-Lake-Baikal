The skies above were slightly clearer.\n\nNews had spread that a new Act of Parliament had passed through the House of Commons and became part of the law of the land. News anchors on live television discussed the ramifications of this recent development. Politicians declared this day as a major success for their party and the country of England.\n\nThe futures of millions of men and women will be affected by this law even if they never hear of it.

The opposition and many media sources have denounced the Prime Minister as incompetent. Even MPs in government have questioned the leadership of their party. Everywhere, people around England hear only of failure, and for every government failure, the people's confidence in the government's ability to rule is reduced. If the Prime Minister can not control Parliament, then soon enough, they won't be able to control England."

This step forward shows to the world that England is a liberal nation moving ahead of the rest of the world.

Enacting a form of national healthcare would massively raise our support, but there are still some concerns about the price. This Act specifically sets up a National Health Service, a government-funded system that would provide healthcare for those in need.

While technically the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords has been rendered powerless through the years, and the Royal Party has not improved the situation. Through the German occupation, the collaborators appointed their allies and corrupt aristocrats into Parliament. This Act reforms the entirety of the House of Lords by eliminating hereditary seats, spiritual seats, and taking away peerage from collaborators.

This Act redistributes much of the land in Britain from the aristocrats to the farmers. The Act also implements some reforms to land ownership to prevent the rich from accumulating land.

The first determiner of one's future is their education, and unfortunately, the rich currently are able to get a better education than most others.

We will remove them from politics, and from society not through violence but through a clear and concise act that will offer the penalties of their continued defiance.

Labour must be able to stand face to face with industry if we are to create a more equitable society. Thus, we will remove any restrictions and government supervision on unions. We will also improve the safety standards of English workspaces, to help assuage some of the more pressing concerns of our workers.

Nepotism is a big issue, of course, and so is the practice of offering extra wages 'under the books', thereby avoiding paying taxes on those wages. And, of course, there are plenty of shady deals.

Unfortunately, to put them inside buildings requires the permission of the property owner, and the footage isn't shared with the authorities unless it is requested. On a number of occasions, this has negatively affected our security apparatus. We will allow authorities to place security cameras in places that they determine crime may occur, regardless of the owner's permission.

The government is never efficient in anything it sets out to do, and as the years have gone on the nationalization of Coal has only caused us problems.
