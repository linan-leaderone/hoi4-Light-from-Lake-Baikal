MEX_rural_depression_madrazo_1:0 "Revolutionary Agriculture"
MEX_rural_depression_madrazo_1_desc:0 ""From the Revolutionary demands for 'Tierra y Libertad', the ejido system of collective agriculture was born. Under it, federally-owned land is allotted to peasant communities, who work the land in common, which initially granted a much greater degree of autonomy to the Mexican peasantry than ever before. President Madrazo has taken steps to begin modernising these farms so that they might compete in the modern era, but there is still work to be done."

Under it, federally-owned land is allotted to peasant communities, who work the land in common, which initially granted a much greater degree of autonomy to the Mexican peasantry than ever before.

# National Foci

MEX_the_door_opens:0 "The Door Opens..."
MEX_the_door_opens_desc:0 "For years, every time a scandal afflicted Madrazo, his detractors and adversaries hoped that would be the one; the one step too far he took, the one moment that perhaps, maybe, Carlos A. Madrazo's turbulent rise through politics would finally meet its end, as scorching and explosive as his tenure in the PRI.\n\nYet, as the man himself steps into the National Palace, as people clamor for changes, for reform, for an improvement on their lot, it seems El Ciclón del Sureste and his like-minded cabinet have proved his detractors wrong once again. But, the flame of Revolution that Madrazo incorporates has never been colder: Apathy dominates the country, and the double-edged knife that is power has never been closer to his chest.\n\nWill this be his magnum opus, or his death knell?"
MEX_the_door_opens_tt: "§OForge of the Revolution§! §Ywill now be visible in the decision menu.§!"
MEX_doctors_in_our_streets:0 "Doctors in Our Streets"
MEX_doctors_in_our_streets_desc:0 "One of the biggest troubles left in our lap from the previous government is, without a doubt, the growing bonfire that is the Doctors Strike. What was once a few hundred middle class residents unaffiliated with PRI institutions has grown into a nation-wide protest against the squalid conditions and low pay across the entire medical field; likely, they hope this will 'show our true colors'.\n\nYet, within this strife lies an opportunity. Whereas many expect us to bring policemen and arrest warrants, we'll instead sit with the strikers and listen to them; after all, if repression was as effective as the other members of the PRI believed, they would have the presidential seat, not us."
MEX_back_to_work:0 "Back to Work!"
MEX_back_to_work_desc:0 "As we provide short-term concessions to the doctors, many within our ranks ponder establishing long-term concessions and deals with the independent associations,to bring them into the fold of the PRI, so to speak. While in an ideal world we could bring them to our line of thinking, the concessions and time to negotiate and meet are simply matters we can't commit to right now.\n\nHow do you explain to the public that their grandparents passed away because politicians and bureaucrats held up the professionals in long negotiations, time spent that could have tackled the ailing healthcare system to begin with?\n\nFor now, what's important isn't that they agree with us, what's important is that they go back to work."
MEX_doctors_strike_focus_completed:0 "The effect of the Doctor Strike has not yet fully impacted the state."
MEX_bring_them_in:0 "Bring Them In"
MEX_bring_them_in_desc:0 "As we provide short-term concessions to the doctors, many within our ranks ponder establishing long-term concessions and deals with the independent associations,to bring them into the fold of the PRI, so to speak. There's no doubt that the negotiations will be costly and lengthy, and bother those that see us kneeling down towards unions and organizations independent of the PRI, yet Rome wasn't built in a single day, nor was Mexico City.\n\nThat this whole situation was even allowed to escalate as it was is a sign of the failure of the old party, too used to resting on their laurels and believing too much in their own base, and that complacency cost them the rudder of the nation. Like medicine, the taste will be bitter now, but the health of our nation and our support will come out stronger than ever."
MEX_but_watch_out_for_the_rats:0 "...But Watch Out for the Rats"
MEX_but_watch_out_for_the_rats_desc:0 "The politician that has no enemies is the one that doesn't stand for anything. In the battlefield of selfish interests and malicious complacency, ours is a banner to reform and renew the PRI and Mexico to the true potential of the Revolution, and we're beset by opportunists: outsiders looking to see any flaw in our defenses and reactionaries within the PRI itself, desiring a return to complacency and rot.\n\nOur success in handling the immediate crisis might have left them without footing, but it won't be long before they organize and hatch a new plan under the element of surprise and anonymity within our party. We can't stop their future attack, but we can very well single out who will be a future thorn in our path."
MEX_for_the_eternal_revolution:0 "For the Eternal Revolution"
MEX_for_the_eternal_revolution_desc:0 "The dust has settled from our immediate crisis, and a tranquil silence has settled upon our cabinet. Our opposition has retired to hatch their plans, and the people have returned to their day-to-day routine, hopeful that perhaps the next day, the burden will be a bit easier.\n\nIn this fleeting peace, we have finally drawn our plan to see that the modern revolutionary flame, so cold and fickle, is steadily stoked to become the burning, uncontrollable inferno that it was thirty years ago. And who better to present it to the nation than Madrazo, the Cyclone of Tabasco himself? This speech must not only be a promise, a commitment to get rid of the stagnancy that drains our potential, but a declaration of war on those that would see us fail.\n\nAfter all, this is the calm before the storm."
MEX_menas_failures:0 "Mena's Failures"
MEX_menas_failures_desc:0 "The renowned Antonio Ortiz Mena is claimed by many in the Party to be the architect of the Mexican Miracle. While there may be some merit to this claim, it is undeniable that his plans of mass industrialization butchered not only our Revolution but the agrarian background of the Party and the nation itself. While it would be more hassle than it is worth to dismiss him outright, we will work with Mena in order to let him fix his own failures."
MEX_necessary_increase:0 "Necessary Increase"
MEX_necessary_increase_desc:0 "Implementing social welfare and building public infrastructure doesn't come without added expenses. To maintain a balanced budget, we must also increase our income. Mexico's historically low taxes give us ample room to raise funds - through higher rates, broader tariffs, or sharpening their progressivism.\n\nRaising taxes is never a simple process, and the groups or people that the taxes affect rarely enjoy it. From the strongest corporations to the simple farmer, tariffs will hit their means and their confidence. Public discontent is to be expected and might cause issues in the short term. But ultimately, the projects they enable will provide the nation with long-term stability."
MEX_seven_wonders_of_mexico:0 "Seven Wonders of Mexico"
MEX_seven_wonders_of_mexico_desc:0 "With the revenue stream of our new taxes flowing in, Madrazo feels it is time to put the funding towards good use. To start the creation of several projects, much grander than previously conceived, all to elevate the ones who truly made Mexico; the working man. Long before, the Mayans and Aztecs created their wonders, still standing to this day, and now is the chance to put our own permanent markers."
MEX_the_plan_of_65:0 "The Plan of '65"
MEX_the_plan_of_65_desc:0 "Instead of focusing our economy solely on growth, Madrazo has proposed a new idea to steer the nation. It was his original revitalization plan of Tabasco that truly put him on the federal stage, and now we are ready to bring it to the national level. From grocery stores to roadways to resource extraction, all manners of the public sector will be expanded upon in a national development model that will breathe new life into Mexico.\n\nDue to the costs of such a plan, Ortiz Mena has naturally objected. Demanding we either narrow the scope of the plan, by leaving out some of more ambitious parts out, or expanding our resource extraction efforts much more boldly and including areas dismissed due to their impacts on the local environment. There is no stopping Madrazo on this, but should we try to moderate it?"
MEX_useful_reshuffle:0 "Useful Reshuffle"
MEX_useful_reshuffle_desc:0 "In every government there exists some sort of inefficiency, something that uses too many resources to justify the output it delivers, and that is not the exception for Mexico. With a massive overhaul of the structure, getting rid of the unnecessary and redundant positions, we will end up with many more resources to work with. Now, if those redundant positions were held by party members with more conservative leanings, that would just be a welcome coincidence."
MEX_wrath_of_the_economist:0 "Wrath of the Economist"
MEX_wrath_of_the_economist_desc:0 "There currently exist two entire worldviews of Mexico's economy, one behind Madrazo's idealism and another behind Mena's pragmatism. Nevertheless, an open break between Madrazo and Mena would be disastrous, being incredibly disruptive to the Mexican Miracle that funds our future.\n\nTo address any tensions, Madrazo has called a meeting with Mena to discuss the matter in a civil and concise fashion."
MEX_struggles_on_the_land:0 "Struggles on the Land"
MEX_struggles_on_the_land_desc:0 "It has been many years since the peasants of Mexico lost faith in the government, most of them forgetting the promises that we made to them during and after the Revolution. Nor do they care about us being the descendants of the great heroes of land reform. Each day their toil intensifies, with Madrazo knowing that change is overdue to not only deliver on the promises but to recover both the heart and spirit of the Party.\n\nNow it is time for us to take the first step, green-lighting the beginning of our projects concerning our collective farms, the Ejidos."
MEX_ejido_mechanization:0 "Ejido Mechanization"
MEX_ejido_mechanization_desc:0 "The establishment of the Ejidos has become a pinnacle of success for the Revolution in providing for the peasants. For Madrazo, it is natural that the system needs to be modernized. The current situation of the Ejidos is beset by ineffective and obsolete equipment, while the farming system itself is also being neglected by the government. The Ejido Mechanization Act will deliver modern tools and amenities to the Ejidos throughout the nation, like electricity, tractors, and fertilizers. This equipment will significantly increase the yield of the struggling farmers, and give more income to an underserved part of the rural population."
MEX_ejido_education:0 "Ejido Education"
MEX_ejido_education_desc:0 "Sending the Ejidos brand new equipment and crops has been an important step within the agrarian reforms. Even so, there is still the issue of guidance and expertise that limits peasants from fully utilizing the welfare packages. Giving modern technology without showing its purpose will lead our programs nowhere.\n\nA peasant might know his land, but agronomists know each and every factor that contributes to its yield. Experienced agronomists will tour the nation to educate Ejidos on agronomy, ecology, and how to work with modern equipment. By turning backward farmers into skilled agronomists, the agrarian sector will be modernized."
MEX_ejido_diversification:0 "Ejido Diversification"
MEX_ejido_diversification_desc:0 "Corn, wheat, and beans have long been traditional Mexican staples in our kitchens, as well as in our agriculture. While having been stable exports in a diversified global market, new demands have inflated the price of other crops while making the traditional three dirt cheap. Our farmers can no longer make a living from these traditional crops. To diversify the agrarian sector, we will help our farmers adopt new plants, like nutritious apples and winter vegetables. Seeds for this broad range will be distributed to struggling farmers, so that they can profit from this novel produce."
MEX_the_rival_outfit:0 "The Rival Outfit"
MEX_the_rival_outfit_desc:0 "While modernizing agriculture is significant progress, we cannot forget the real enemy plaguing the countryside; agribusiness. The creation of the Ejidos was a crucial reform that improved the lives of countless farmers, yet when foreign corporations poured into the country, it seemed like the reform was for nothing. Large conglomerates have established unbreakable monopolies that only worsened the quality of life for peasants, with low wages, hoarding of wealth, and inhumane working conditions.\n\nArticle 27 of the Constitution gives us control over Mexican land and water, including private property. Using this article, we will be able to eliminate the foreign monopolies. Through taxing and putting heavier restrictions on agribusiness, the Ejidos can expand their influence on the agrarian sector."
MEX_smash_the_commercial_vultures:0 "Smash the Commercial Vultures"
MEX_smash_the_commercial_vultures_desc:0 "Article 27 declares our right to administer our own land and resources, and therefore we must enforce it, unconditionally. Both Japanese and American agribusiness corporations have taken their corrupt agenda to Mexico, plaguing the nation like vultures. The separation between rich and poor has grown with inhumane wages and working conditions under the selfish gain of foreign conglomerates. The confiscation and dissolution of corporate power will restore national control over the economy. The land and resources will then be distributed to the Ejidos. With the elimination of the commercial vultures, the corruption of the agrarian sector will be purged and its humanity will be restored."
MEX_smash_the_commercial_vultures_tt:0 "Taking this focus will change the effects of "§Y...And What Do They Think?§! in favour of §KMexico§!..." 
MEX_the_great_southern_plan:0 "The Great Southern Plan"
MEX_the_great_southern_plan_desc:0 "As governor of Tabasco, Madrazo was able to turn the province from a struggling and forgotten section of the state into a prospering and modernized community. This success wouldn't be able to be achieved without welfare programs, moderate reform, and public solidarity. In the face of the opposition of the radical left and greedy corporations, the strength of pragmatism and socialism persevered.\n\nReflecting on these achievements, it is vital that moderate change is prioritized over radical actions. While Article 27 is powerful, we cannot risk our economic stability. Instead, we will slowly nationalize our natural resources and collectivize certain production facilities such as distilleries, bakeries, and canneries."
MEX_and_what_do_they_think:0 "...And What Do They Think?"
MEX_and_what_do_they_think_desc:0 "We stand at the crossroads of two superpowers, one of corporate "liberty" and the other of imperialist liberation. Mexico remains alone in the dark, a Revolution left unnoticed. It is that Revolution that keeps our flame burning. In the face of the imperialists, we strive for freedom. In the face of corporate gain, social welfare provides for the people. In the face of foreign bourgeois, the Mexican proletariat strikes back.\n\nIt is with this fact that we must prepare for their reactions and potential retaliation. For even if the Revolution marches on, our sovereignty is threatened by their oversight. To calculate their response is nearly impossible, but preparations are very reasonable. In case of extreme backlash, we can, of course, use our national reserves."
MEX_and_what_do_they_think_tt:0 "§VThe consequences of our choices will be made clear.§!"
MEX_rusted_grip_of_poverty:0 "Rusted Grip of Poverty"
MEX_rusted_grip_of_poverty_desc:0 "Since the times of tyrants like Porfirio Díaz, the Mexican farmer and peasant have been the victims of absurd imbalances of wealth and equality, trapped in endless and inescapable poverty while the rich hoarded their ill-begotten treasure. Thanks to the Revolution and the PRI, we have made great strides, but many of our lower-class citizens still live in crushing poverty and insecurity. It's time we did something about it!\n\nPresident Madrazo has made his stance clear: the ultimate goal of his tenure shall be to resolve this unfairness once and for all! The grip of poverty is firm, like iron, but it has become rusty, and one way or another, it shall shatter!"
MEX_after_three_its_too_late:0 "After Three, It's Too Late"
MEX_after_three_its_too_late_desc:0 "Crucial to developing a more modern and equal society is the education of younger generations, and, as famed CEO and philanthropist Masaru Ibuka put it, children are capable of incredible learning and growth from a tender age. If we want what is best for them, then kindergarten is too late! As such, the President has laid out the groundwork for educating our newest generations both at home and in school, and with it, we can ensure a more prosperous future."
MEX_for_every_head_a_roof:0 "For Every Head a Roof"
MEX_for_every_head_a_roof_desc:0 "The march of industrialization has been steady and flourishing in Mexico's cities, but it has not been without consequences. As workers and families leave the countryside to live in our big cities, they have been subjected to limited selections for housing, endangering their most basic needs and limiting their potential. While our government's mission focuses on our rural populace, we must not abandon our urban families to these conditions."
MEX_enlarge_on_mateos:0 "Enlarge on Mateos"
MEX_enlarge_on_mateos_desc:0 "President Mateos took steps in the right direction for our nation and the Revolution during his presidency, most notably with the Cardenista Manifesto of 57, but more is needed! If the PRI is going to complete the Revolution, it must go even further beyond! President Madrazo has made his stance clear: every single program included in the Manifesto must and will be expanded! Through these programs, the government will be able to service the Mexican people and ensure a brighter future for the nation."
MEX_to_heal_a_nation:0 "To Heal a Nation"
MEX_to_heal_a_nation_desc:0 "Every year, diseases ravage their way across the countryside and kill untold numbers of our people. This health and safety crisis has not improved in light of the doctors' strike, which has exposed the weakness in our healthcare system. However, we can improve our standing at home and abroad by addressing the system's failures, raising morale among the people, increasing our popularity, and making the country healthier."
MEX_under_the_hood:0 "Under the Hood"
MEX_under_the_hood_desc:0 "	If there is one thing the Mexican people have made clear, it is their desire for change. Ever since the fall of the Porfiriato in 1911, countless revolutionaries have come and gone. Some are revered as heroes, others villains. After many years of this dichotomy, the people finally saw it right to give power to us.\n\nIn the eyes of most, it is clear we have yet to live up to their standard. They have every right to believe this given the failures of successive governments in agriculture, social policy, and economics. The Institutional Revolutionary Party has become a rotten edifice, home to the most corrupt, avaricious, and unscrupulous in Mexico. Ours is the party of oligarchs, the running dog of regional machines, and an obnoxious force for malevolence for countless citizens. We have allowed the people to be manipulated by reactionaries and Bolshevists, filling the void that we have left. We must search our souls and look to the successes of the past and solidify the PRI forevermore."
MEX_whip_corruption:0 "Whip Corruption"
MEX_whip_corruption_desc:0 "It is a great irony that some causes' greatest warriors were previously consummate representatives of what they fight against. Our own President was a victim of a byzantine scheme to implicate him in a fraudulent migrant card program, briefly jailing him.\n\nCorruption is the greatest hypocrisy, for it is the use of the public weal for personal enrichment, often using the very measures to counteract corruption to attack those who expose it. Carlos Madrazo and his allies understand this all too well and know that all anti-corruption measures must be aimed not only at the small-time local tax collector but at the men who roam the halls of the Chamber of Deputies or reside in the upper echelons of the PRI itself."
MEX_let_sleeping_bribes_lie:0 "Let Sleeping Bribes Lie"
MEX_let_sleeping_bribes_lie_desc:0 "Carlos Madrazo knows that the intricacies of local governance often cannot be described in simple terms such as 'corruption' or 'abuse of power'. Often, the administration of rural provinces is so underdeveloped that unorthodox movement of money is necessary to maintain the basic functions of government. Nor can we ignore the fact that acts of supposed corruption are often merely slightly extralegal dispensations to people in need. Our own president found out the hard way how such grey areas can potentially destroy careers and ruin lives, all for the crime of helping a few migrants find work!\n\nThe PRI is a machine greased with many oils. Does this mean many of its gears must be ripped out, and cast away as defective? Must the machine fit the artificial specifications of amateurs and perpetual whiners: the journalist species? Some things are better off when left well enough alone."
MEX_the_great_winnowing:0 "The Great Winnowing"
MEX_the_great_winnowing_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that when an organization takes charge of its country's future, leading it with diligence and adroit statesmanship, hangers-on, landlords, and other exploiters latch onto that Party like parasites. These men abuse the people's trust, rob them openly, and tarnish the record of honest reformists.\n\nWhile this phenomenon is common everywhere from Turkey, to China, to even prosperous superpowers like Japan, it is especially egregious in our own country. Land sale sheets are from top to bottom Party membership lists. Factories too are owned and operated by Party members. Before our administration, this organizational affiliation gave the powerful virtual immunity from any meaningful legal prosecution for their many abuses. This state of affairs shall end. While the central position of our Party in the administration of the nation's vital interests is necessary, it shall no longer be overseen by a shadowy and conceited elite."
MEX_one_small_step:0 "One Small Step"
MEX_one_small_step_desc:0 "Mexican political life has experienced a great constriction in the years since the ascension of the PRI. In many ways, this has been a boon to the people, with very little reactionary wrangling from state-wide 'opposition' backed by the landlords or administrative sabotage by vengeful political partisans. Our party's dominance over the government has enabled it to also control the trade unions, through an organization known as the Confederation of Mexican Workers.\n\nThe Confederation is a blight on the working man and the PRI. Governed by a man who is a textbook example of all that is base, managerial, and self-serving in any organization, Fidel Velázquez has transformed what was once a grassroots trade union alliance into a de facto wing of the industrial-organizational complex of Mexico, serving the bosses more often than any worker. If there is to be any real reform in Mexico, we must begin whittling away at the edges of this great, corrupt behemoth. While we may not be able to defeat men like Velázquez, we can at the very least send the CTM on a more productive path."
MEX_the_fires_of_youth:0 "The Fires of Youth"
MEX_the_fires_of_youth_desc:0 "Madrazo knows the political potential of students. As leader of the Confederation of Mexican Youth then as Governor of Tabasco, Madrazo utilized the raw energies and passions of the young to spearhead the party's battles against Reactionary terrorism and corruption.\n\nMadrazo knows that the modern PRI has not been the most inviting environment for the youth. The Party is led by the senile and ignorant, while the young and visionary have been shunted off to local politics at best. Madrazo has sought out these visionaries and knows there are many more."

MEX_hornets_in_the_engine_chamber_desc:0 "The forces of reaction have always stood in the way of progress, and, as we expected, the old guard and technocrat factions are no different from the reactionaries other Revolutionaries have faced in the past. However, the lengths to which they have gone to halt our advance have been far more drastic than anyone anticipated, and their stubbornness is making our allies reluctant to press on.\n\nIt's becoming clear to us that if we are going to accomplish our goals and secure Madrazo's mandate for Mexico, we will have to put up a fight of our own. Change is coming, and our opposition will move or be moved."

"I now wish to share with you how I plan to direct that effort over the coming years. Our party has done a superb job of organizing and rallying the populace to address the great issues of the day."\n\n"But often, we are so intent on sharing our view of the Revolution that we do not stop to hear its beat pounding in the peasant's breast.

Reyes Heroles smiled and continued, "So together, you and I will build a party that listens. One that is more familiar with the people it represents, one that is more accountable to them as well. To open ourselves to the wisdom of the people will be the next great step on the PRI's road."\n\nHe thanked his audience, and received a fulsome if short round of applause.

MEX_Madrazo.7.desc: "SIEMPRE! - A recent phenomenon in the capital is the arrival of so-called 'café cantantes' that are beginning to spring up in the city's underbelly. Young people drink bootlegged alcohol, commit promiscuities, and engage in anti-social behaviour; all to the tune of Yanqui rock music, which is becoming a pervasive influence among children and teenagers of all walks of life. These songs, via subliminal messaging, persuade these young people to engage in these banal acts for the sake of American cultural imperialism. The youth of this nation are in crisis! They are misled! What of the Revolution? What about this country? What about its people? The poor, and the needy, lie in squalor; not only are they neglected by local authorities, their own children neglect them. I appeal to you, young men and women, to devote yourselves to the workers and peasants!\n\nEcheverría never usually read rags like these. When he did, it was only to look for anything out-of-line: in this case, the editorial had been particularly careful to limit criticism of the party to that of vague "local authorities". He found himself in agreement for once. Yes, it was dreadful. Terrible. This sort of thing was unbecoming of people that age. But then these thoughts hit closer to home. Young Álvaro, Echeverría's son, what if he got mixed up in all of this? Drinking, getting into fights, narcotics, no -\n\nNo! No more.\n\nEcheverría tossed the magazine and reached for his telephone. He realised while sitting through the dial tone that this was also a great opportunity to gain face in the eyes of the President. Yes, yes. He would be getting in Madrazo's good graces while putting these wayward kids back in their place.\n\nHow fulfilling it is to be the man who gets things done.\n\n"Secretary Cárdenas?""

"There is a festering moral rot," he interlocked his hands on the table, "among the best and brightest of our nation. The men and women of tomorrow. Our heirs, our children. And it all springs from those so-called 'café cantantes'. I did not fight the usurper Huerta just to have our revolution swept under our feet by imperialist American music..." Cárdenas' voice tightened; feeling an indignant lump in his throat, he took a moment to collect his thoughts. "...I fear that everything we have worked for will be for nought if our young people become shallow materialists."\n\nLuis Echeverría interjected, looming over a few sheets of paper. "Your Excellency, I'm very much in agreement. I've taken the liberty of collating reports courtesy of the DFS. Here is one, for example." He trained his finger along the opening sentence. "Source reports a café in one barrio has been taken over by squatters who host 'reefer parties'... a general assumption can be made that these establishments are becoming a breeding ground for drug use and rebellious anti-social behaviour... Oh, and apparently youth gangs, too. An incident was noted of a mass brawl outside one café. One boy was stabbed."\n\nHorrible, Madrazo thought. He stroked his chin and was about to query Alfonso del Rosal, but his Head of the Federal District spoke first, a rigid frown knitting his brow. "I can assure you, Your Excellency, that Licenciado Echeverría will be pleased to hear that this is not the big problem the DFS insists it to be under my management."Echeverría seemed primed to respond, but Javier Sierra entered with his own retort. "How do we expect the youth to be future leaders if we deny them liberty because of your prejudices? Let them play their music. Punish the wrongdoers, yes, but this is fussing over nothing. Were you not all young once?" Madrazo held up a palm for Sierra to wrap it up. He made his decision."

MEX_Madrazo.9.desc: "Camila laughed at her friend Luisa's clumsy attempt at dancing - not knowing what to do with her limbs, she awkwardly strutted in place, fluttering her hands around with rigid legs. But she didn't care. Luisa grinned along at her own expense, Maria then drifting along from the bar armed with beer. "I think the next song is starting," she handed over the bottles, "should be that one that you like, Mila!" A few inebriated cheers sounded out from the crowd as the jukebox played the opening riff. Camila swigged her drink, locking arms around Luisa and Maria both to do a mock can-can with spirited giggles. The thought of that stupid film about the Olympics came to Camila's mind; she had left during the intermission and had quickly skipped down a few blocks to join her friends at the Chestnut Café for a night of actual fun. An escape from her overbearing father. Her heart sank at the mention of him.\n\nBut then she saw the look in Luisa's eyes, Maria's beaming smile.\n\nIt was these carefree moments she clung to for dear life.\n\n"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart?""

She felt herself bumbling into other crowd goers, but the mood was decidedly mellow all round; what would have earned a push or shove on the streets was instead rewarded with indifferent smiles and slurred apologies. Alcohol had rendered most of them all placid marionettes. But not sober Camila - for her trouble, the bridge's flute solo seemed to provoke particular ecstasy. "This is what heaven must be like."\n\nThe film she had skipped earlier came to mind to spoil the moment. It was some spiel about a boy from an ejido who made his dreams come true by competing at the Olympics - so stupid, she thought, that someone would want to train for the high jump when they could listen to music and dance all day from morning to end. She would never leave this place.\n\nBut then glass shattering rang in her ears. A scream sounded out. The music continued playing while Camila pressed her hands to her face, mouth agape in horror; a boy lay writhing on the floor, blood pooling from his head as he convulsed. A girl was using her coat to wipe the mess, clutching his head, all the while wailing at the top of her lungs. The fragments of a brick lay broke apart a few feet away.\n\nThe crowd began to surge all around Camila as the tidal wave rocked towards the doors. She felt herself being pulled and pushed apart, desperately gripping onto other people's shoulders to stay upright. The bright streetlights seemed to flicker uncontrollably as the doors swung, only to then settle as her eyes adjusted to the well-lit evening. Hoodlums, all redshirted, stood in uproar, jostling and pushing the dazed partygoers as they streamed out of the café. Camila was accosted by one - still in shock, she barely could read his lips, let alone hear anything but noise - who shouted and barked and spat in her face.\n\nShe ran for her life as the world seemed to close in."

She left the cinema during the intermission and sauntered a few blocks down, noticing the denser crowds as she walked further. Stopping at a corner, Camila saw her favourite haunt - the Chestnut Café - only this time it was boarded up and dilapidated, the space where the front door used to be replaced with yellow police tape. In front of the condemned building, a balding man whom Camila did not recognise helmed a makeshift podium. It was decorated with PRI flags and slogans, guarded by a sea of redshirted thugs. He gesticulated with pomp and fervour, clasping and tightening his fists; the microphone amplified his booming voice.\n\n"Young people of the nation, turn away from the forces of social dissolution! Serve your nation, serve your countrymen!"\n\nOnly upon hearing this did Camila pay a closer look at the colour guard, particularly their faces, and at one in particular - a girl of similar age, her hair in pigtails, spotted with freckles, but bearing an incensed, threatening gaze that seemed to invite the enemies of the revolution to appear at once, so she and the vanguard could strike them dead.\n\nCamila felt her heart sink. Her chest burned. The street began to spin uncontrollably.\n\nCrushed in the dense crowd, she shoved her way out and ran."

He had heard the news but Madrazo didn't answer. Shocked, frozen solid, Madrazo found himself unable to move for the longest time.\n\n"Fucking idiots!" One side of himself thought. "Weren't they on our side? What has led them to go to such extremes? What pushed them to take up arms?" Madrazo had rage on one eye and fear on the other.

Gentlemen, they think of themselves as revolutionaries; if we do not snuff out any remnants of these guerillas, then they will try and overthrow our government. We must show them that we are the Revolution manifest." His Excellency, President Carlos Madrazo stomped and raged at his assembled cabinet as if his very voice would give his enemies pause. Madrazo wiped his sweating brow and looked over at his audience. The executive cabinet was made up of Madrazo's trusted advisors and the most powerful men in the PRI; they would know what to do.\n\n"You are completely right." Secretary of National Defense Lázaro Cárdenas was the first to break through the silence created by the President's impassioned speech. "I believe that full military action is necessary. If you think it right, I can begin drawing up plans immediately." Cárdenas was one of the most experienced politicians in Mexico and had led anti-guerrilla campaigns during the Civil War; Madrazo could trust him with his enemies. A number of other cabinet members nodded in agreement.\n\n"Your Excellency, perhaps a moment of calm is necessary," Secretary Sierra interjected. "The recent raid about which we are all so concerned may not be as severe as originally anticipated. Perhaps the people are simply signaling that they desire for reforms. Reforms we can provide for them with a little open communication."\n\nMadrazo would have usually listened to his friend's wise counsel, but he felt the walls closing in.

Before him stood legions of men in formation, their faces an arrangement of anxious emotions ranging from anticipation to dread, but at the ready nonetheless.\n\n"Soldiers, comrades!" The last time he led men on a military campaign had been almost forty years ago, but the purpose in his chest made him feel younger than any of the boys before him. "More than fifty years ago from this day, I was one of you: young, brave, and strong. I marched alongside the Zapatistas to face corrupt and decadent men who tore down our democracy in their lust for power."\n\n"Our enemy is much like the ones from our nation's past: violent, unlawful scoundrels who scorn our nation's progress and seek power for themselves." His face then turned into a smile. "However, I pity them because they have to face you, the guardians of the Revolution!" The men brightened at that, and a cheer rang out of them.\n\n"Gentlemen, I ask you to place your faith in me: I know how to fight a war like this, and I will do all I can to lead you to victory and safety in the battles to come.

MEX_Madrazo.15.desc: "Chihuahua was a lovely place to visit this time of year. It was a shame, Lázaro Cárdenas thought to himself, that the company couldn't be the same. After some fruitless hours wasted in discussions with a fellow general, a veteran of the Revolution but one who had lost the stomach for field command, Cárdenas was glad to be on his way back to the Federal District in the back of an air-conditioned vehicle. Taking a moment to press two fingers to his eyes to wipe out the tiredness, he then idly opened his briefcase to review the reports of his men's performances in the field.\n\nAfter weeks of campaigning across the Sierra, his men had suffered eleven men wounded in action, another three killed, and one vehicle lost to an improvised explosive. On the other hand, their foes in the GPG had lost thirty-three men in combat, and his men captured even more. He felt some pride at the performance of his men, but the numbers were still... unimpressive. Estimates of the GPG's numbers suggested there could have been a small army out in the north, not tiny cells that police officers could have flushed out.\n\nHe thumbed through the papers, overlooking the mass number of men under his command, and frowned in realization. The operation had been too large and too loud for its good. In their quest for an impressive victory, they had practically announced their plans to the GPG, who made the only logical choice: dive underground or evacuate away from his army. As his mind turned to the size of the Sierra and the ease with which one could hide a rebel movement within it, Cárdenas's stomach churned. The road to victory would be much longer than he thought."

"Marvelous. It is just what I was looking for in a ... proper, suitably revolutionary Secretariat of the Interior. Carry on, then."\n\nSomewhere else in the Interior Secretariat compound, a bureaucrat began to show much more enthusiasm in his work. "It's not as though I have much choice, though. They'll fire me like they did all the others if I don't, and replace me with a fanatic. Best I replace myself then."\n\nThe official did as he planned.

A national security order, it expanded prison times, generously utilized preventative detention laws, expanded the definition of the crime of social dissolution, militarized police duties and created the National Revolutionary Militia.\n\nThere was to be no mistake. Madrazo was going to sign the decree. But he still felt some doubt. "These old guards, they're still my enemy even though I sit in the National Palace. What gain do I have from the fact that the technocrats are a shattered force if these quasi-reactionaries are trying to stymie me every chance they get?"\n\nHe flipped over a page of the decree. "And all these directives—I wouldn't have thought to do this shit when I was just the Governor of Tabasco. I'm going to have to commit to sacrifices I never thought I'd need to go ahead with, aren't I.

While normally such impromptu meetings among friendly colleagues might call for a drink or two, Gómez knew Madrazo in his youth as a fervent supporter of Governor Garrido's temperance campaigns in Tabasco. He carried this prejudice against all things tobacco and alcohol with him to the Presidency, to the point of making it taboo among the cabinet. He didn't want to offend.\n\n"Your Excellency, I must say, the left-wing movement in the party has gotten a new lease of life. Compared to where we were a few years ago, I'm delighted."\n\nMadrazo smiled. "We still have a lot to do. But you're right... I haven't thought about it in that sense. I'm too caught up in the moment."\n\n"It's a good way to be," Gómez laughed genial, "not dwelling on the past too much. Still, take it in once in a while. You're the first President since Cárdenas to be truly committed to the revolutionary cause."\n\nGetting up all of a sudden, Gómez peeked into the suitcase he had taken in with him. He produced a crisp manila folder that he offered over to Madrazo, seated.\n\n"I've been working on a set of education reforms, Your Excellency. The proposal is quite detailed but it will enforce amendments to the curriculum, introduce ideological screening for teachers, and so on..."\n\nA mild hum sounded from Madrazo as he quickly perused; Gómez wasn't lying when he said it was extensive.

But if anyone were to make it happen, it would be him - Secretary Luis Echeverría Álvarez, no less.\n\nHe went to Gómez's office after making an appointment, trading small talk about the weather and other banalities. Feeling an awkward urgency once the conversation started to dry up, Echeverría segued onto the actual purpose of his visit. He cleared his throat.\n\n"I've heard about your proposal, Secretary, and I'm delighted, but there are a few changes I want to suggest." Echeverría gestured with his finger, though not really at anything in particular. "Our revolution serves as a model for the rest of the Americas, but it is a national revolution. Not one dedicated to propagating socialism worldwide. The curriculum should reflect the unity between the Latin American nations."\n\nHe paused for a moment to gauge Gómez's reaction; the old man gave nothing away. Polite smiles. It unnerved him. "It should also reflect the imperialist history of the United States in the Americas. The Monroe Doctrine, the occupation of Veracruz, Cuba..." Echeverría trailed off, listing all sorts of historical grievances.\n\nGómez feigned listening, though his mind was elsewhere.\n\nWhat would the Americans think, for a start? Mexico's relationship with the United States rested on a delicate balance - this would be like slamming the pendulum right back over the Rio Grande. Not to mention what the intellectuals would think of all this sabre-rattling, Paz their chief. And then the President himself..."

Madrazo had complained of feeling too shut-in at Los Pinos, so he decided to conduct the meeting Paz had requested at one of the local parks. Bodyguards stood with unconcealed pistols - and one with a rifle - at either end. The view was oddly tranquil, despite armed oversight and pedestrian noise.\n\nMadrazo leaned back on his chair. "What was it you were saying about Gómez's reforms?"\n\n"They're too restrictive. There's little agency for teachers," Paz stopped to read some of the dossier, "and there seems to be no tolerance for any sort of free thinking. I understand the importance of the Revolution, Your Excellency..."\n\n"Hmph." Madrazo snorted under his breath as Paz was about to come out with another one of his near-blasphemous statements. "No, I understand. Go on."\n\nPaz continued. "It cannot be at the expense of individual freedoms. This is not what the generation previous fought for. Not at all. We should be encouraging children to think independently, not herding a nation of sheep." He took a moment to recall something. "And, by the by, I think the proposed wage increases don't go far enough, Your Excellency.

"As you can see, there is a general revolutionary ethos throughout the document, yes? But this curriculum completely divorces it from its proper Mexican and wider Latin heritage. Where is the mention of the liberators? Vicente Guerrero? Bolívar? Revolutionary education is nothing without a culture to back it up, Your Excellency."\n\n"I agree," Madrazo replied, caressing his cheek, "but I'll need to speak with Gómez in more detail. I hope you understand..."\n\n"If I may, Your Excellency, I think the period of consultation has gone on far enough. We will need a decision sooner rather than later."\n\nMadrazo felt himself deflate.

Or maybe it would cause them to lose their love for their nation, instead refusing to contribute toward it and leaving to some far away land. A tragedy.\n\nToo far on the other side, it would essentially be propaganda, training servants, not future workers. Fanaticism in the way of imagining enemies on the other side, of distilling a corrupted version of the Revolution into their brains, tainting them forever.

With several changes in planning for our public works and for the farmers neglected for so long."\n\nAnother breath, his heart beating with the ever-rising tempo of the atmosphere, perfect for the swamp he was wading into. "In this vision, it is one of a government that serves its people, to the fullest and best extent that it can, and then some! It is one where as the people scream out, the government will be there to take notes and follow their will, being the true meaning of serving you, the people!"\n\nMadrazo looked onto the silent crowd, mimicking them, and took a step back."

MEX_Madrazo.28.desc: "Crickets chirped in the tall grass, the moonlight glare casting its accusatory beam on both Governor Celis of Sinaloa and his Sonoran counterpart, Luis Encinas Johnson. They were both unaccompanied, save for the two separate cars they had driven to the layby in. Johnson was on edge, fidgeting with his hands; kicking around dust plumes that swept away in the black of night. For his trouble, Celis leaned cooly against the hood of his russet Lincoln Continental to fashion himself a cigarette. He tilted his head to ask Johnson if he wanted one to his refusal. "Now's not the time, Señor Celis. When is he coming?"\n\nCelis consulted his watch and shrugged. "Any minute now."\n\nDimmed headlights came into view from behind the tall grass. Johnson cradled his brow as the beams shined into his eyes, with Celis puffing and billowing smoke from the darkness, unaffected. A short, wiry man stepped out from his modest car and stepped carefully towards the two Governors. His eyes were large, brooding; carrying years of paranoia and caution within a pair of otherwise unremarkable irises.\n\n"Were you followed?" Johnson asked, gripping his lapels. The man shook his head.\n\n"I checked. Is the deal still on?"\n\nCelis, by this stage, had grown bored of his cigarette and let it fly into the dirt road to extinguish. "You've already paid for our services, señor. I've no intention of playing hard and fast with your money. Those Japanese goods of yours will come into port every month, your men will take them, they will go across the border... The rest will be up to you."\n\n"President Madrazo won't interfere?" Johnson nodded subtly, seconding the smuggler's question with bated breath. Celis simply laughed."

What don't you forget?" He kicks it harder, picking up his pace to keep up. "You city dwellers are weak stock, you know?" He nearly sends the pebble into a pedestrian, snapping him out of his spiral. He had completely lost track of where he was going.\n\n"Excuse me, sir, where is the bar–"\n\nHis day drinking aspirations were cut short when the roaring boom of the President's voice came from the building next door. Rodrigo approaches, and the laughter of the working youth like him welcomes him into the circle, a listening party for the President's speech. "You look lost, friend! Come and join us, he is about to speak."\n\nInside the circle, an energy radiated as warm as fire as the patriotic words flew out Madrazo's mouth. "With new vigor, we will tackle our problems from their core – corruption, neglect of the working man – The Revolution is not over, people, and it will not be until this is done!" Rodrigo could not help but cheer along with his new friends in the bar at the end of such a speech, and made a note of where to find them in the future."

MEX_Madrazo.31.desc: "Antonio,\n\nAs your former counterpart and personal friend, I write to you in alarm at the decisions Madrazo and his cabinet are making in regards to the labor unrest currently besieging the nation's hospitals. This excessive coddling of this wildcat strike will only unleash a wave of copycat activities across the nation, and paralyse more than just this field.\n\nLet's not say I don't understand what these workers are feeling - or that Madrazo's sympathies aren't in the right place. This was entirely an avoidable situation caused by corrupt bureaucrats making promises they can't keep. And a proper response would be to own up to our mistakes and let those responsible know some things are unforgivable. But Madrazo is going beyond that - he wants to give them more than they were owed, recognize their unofficial union, and push for them to the absolute maximum. And where does that maximum end? How much is too much?\n\nYou and I both know why unaffiliated unions are not tolerated, and why the state is the mediator of disputes and not representation for the plaintiff. If every union that comes out of the woodwork is accepted, the CTM becomes meaningless. If every worker movement - especially the ones borne of unrealistic expectations and dubious grievances - gets what they demand, inflation will go through the roof. And if the government lets it be known that such behavior is acceptable, Mexico's great strengths in inexpensive labor and a stable economy will fall through.\n\nLet me also warn you, as I hope you are aware, that Mexico has a finite budget. And we need to sort out our priorities. Every peso this strike takes up will be one peso less we have to spend on other projects. Let me ask you what is more important: to increase the size of the 'performance retention bonus' of an intern in the hospitals? Or to invest in new lumber mills, mines, oil wells, tractors, electric plants, and other activities that will relieve the poor of Mexico much more than the unions ever could?\n\nI hope you impart to the Cabinet the importance of keeping our developing economy strong and growing.\n\nSincerely:"

Ambassador of Mexico to the United States of America, Ordaz had barely stepped out of the Department of State building in Washington, D.C., with his entourage before reporters accosted him. A casual mob blasted him with noise and light with utmost confidence. "Do you care to make an official response about the ongoing medical intern strike in Mexico?"\n\n"Good morning, gentleman. Lively as always, I see." Like all experienced politicians, Ordaz has had plenty of experience with journalists. But he was continuously surprised by the American press's independence and persistence. While never crossing the line of political decency, the Yankees were far more brazen than their Mexican counterparts. They would not give up until he gave them an answer befitting an albeit distant member of the Madrazo administration.\n\n"The medical interns you speak of are only one part of a complex economy. Their demands and tactics endanger the working people of my country. Their irresponsibility threatens the vital healthcare system they are supposed to support. Truthfully..." Ordaz's throat tightened with a mix of frustration and duty. He despised Madrazo's willingness to appease the interns and his eagerness to bend the PRI's labor policies to accommodate their demands. He wanted to speak his mind, but the memory of his actions during the Aleutian Crisis and its consequences held him back. That was why he was in D.C., after all. Ordaz loosened his tie and breathed a strained sigh. "Truthfully, I have full faith that President Madrazo will conduct successful negotiations with the healthcare professions without further escalation."\n\nA couple of camera flashes and other diplomatic platitudes later, the journalistic crowd dissipated.

Secretary of Exterior Relations Alfonso Garcia Robles rubbed his brow and bald head firmly with his free hand. It was all he could do to resist the urge to inform the good Ambassador Kaoru that he did, in fact, understand how tariffs worked. The Japanese ambassador continued his thinly veiled threat. "I shouldn't need to remind you of the importance that trade between our two nations represents for your economy."\n\n"I hear your frustrations, and I look forward to speaking with you about this further." Robles placed down his phone's handset before the Japanese diplomat could throw another protest his way. He had spent the entire working day fielding complaints, reports, and unsolicited opinions from the greater international community ever since the tariffs were announced the day before. No more than a single minute passed when somebody was knocking on Robles' office door. It was one of his aides delivering a message. "Put it with the others." Robles referred to a growing pile of papers on his desk, all labeled 'urgent.'\n\n"It's from the US embassy, Secretary." Robles took the envelope from the young aide and read the contents within. The letter explained in direct, dry language the United States' official opinion on Mexico's recent trade policy with its northern neighbor. If such policies were to continue as announced, then America would have no choice but to enact tariffs of its own. However, due to the close nature of Mexico and America, the letter insisted that drastic measures were not inevitable. Below the typed letters was the personal signature of US Ambassador Fulton Freeman.\n\nRobles rapped his fingers on his desk as he thought.

Over the past years, Emilio watched as the previously undersized and unsafe airport was transformed by titanic new structures. Great blocks of steel and glass now rose from the ground like beacons of modernity.\n\nOnce complete, the new airport connected itself to the broader metropolitan area via road and rail. Now, even those from the working-class neighborhoods of Guadalajara could easily access the airport and, therefore, the rest of the country.\n\nEmilio internally sneered as a woman approached his desk. He noted her wrinkled shirt and worn shoes. Soon, his beautiful cathedral of aviation would be filled with her type—those who might stain the very air with their unsophistication.

For days he wished for it to happen sooner, it was like His Excellency was torturing him for the crime of questioning the massive economic changes and programs he announced. Now, his day had come to plead his case to the President.\n\n"For starters, well, there's your order of, basically, massive nationalization that'll rock the confidence of investors both foreign and domestic. Then there's this massive promise of infrastructure spending even in areas that aren't as, uhm, efficient to invest in, a-and these expansions of almost every major public service are uh.

"Your Excellency, I understand that you implemented these in Tabasco, with great effect, however you may have forgotten that Mexico is not Tabasco. We do not have infinite oil money to fund these projects, so I will leave you to read the costs of what you want to implement."\n\nMadrazo's eyes trailed at the leaving economist, the bulk of what he wanted was absolutely necessary to revitalize Mexico. Though, if it was worth getting the Secretary back to his side he could compromise on a few of the less necessary proposals.\n\nHis last sentence gave Madrazo pause, he could simply incentivize the collection of more oil, then he'd have the money but that in itself would cost initially his wallet and permanently the environment. Not compromising would avoid those costs, along with being rewarded with the full effects of his proposals, but there would be a deficit until the downtrodden could recover and pitch in with their taxes."

Matías barely glanced up at his wife; his heavily wrinkled eyes were too focused on the thin black lines he was beholding. Matías was reading 'Pedro Martínez, A Mexican Peasant and His Family' by US sociologist Oscar Lewis. It was a nonfiction account of impoverished peasants' life after the Revolution. A lifelong PRI bureaucrat, Matías had spent his career enacting the promises of the Revolution one small step at a time. Matías had the book recommended to him by one of his colleagues. He was told that it was relevant to the President's recent speeches on the need to combat rural poverty. Soon after beginning the book, Matías turned each page with intrigue and disappointment. He learned quickly that the life of Pedro Martínez was not one that had benefited from the Revolution. In the years after the Revolution, Pedro's life remained disappointingly static. His poor rural existence remained fundamentally the same as his hometown only saw gradual improvements despite all the promises by the PRI. Matías looked at the room around him and at his dutiful wife. Life had changed much for him in the past 50 years. He had grown up in a small farming town like Pedro, and his father had fought in the Revolution. Now he sat in a two story home in a nice neighborhood of Mexico City. He had reliable power, running water, and many personal luxuries. All things that Pedro Martinez lacked.\n\n"Don't worry, honey. The book will still be there in the morning."

A vote was held. Yams it is.\n\nTwo weeks later, a battered truck rolled to a stop outside the small office.

Fernández patted Segura on the shoulder before trooping on past. The decision was his to make."

The crowd turned toward the man from the south and heeded his words.\n\n"Here, I hold the various demands- no." Madrazo corrected himself and spoke up again, "Necessities for workers that will be followed in all commercial farms nationwide regarding the workers and their treatment. From wage increases, overtime, maximum hours, and safety, everything listed in this document will become the gold standard for all farm workers."\n\nHéctor listened on as Madrazo's short speech drummed to a close, "So, it is with hope that you will accept this document and put it into enforcement the moment you are able to. Each hour delayed, another worker toils without fair compensation, another hour in which we are unfaithful to the Revolution." With the chamber descending into a roaring applause, Héctor joined in as the room was filled with the sound of advancement."

MEX_Madrazo.49.t: "It Wasn't That Easy"
MEX_Madrazo.49.desc: ""Ah." Madrazo allowed his stiff joints to relax after he got in the car, the motorcade quickly picking up to speed and going down the roadway. It was an exhausting event, one that finally registered as over once he saw the sign exiting Santiago de Queretaro.\n\nThe count of buildings dwindled before he was greeted by sheer landscape, what appeared to be a commercial vineyard, and a far away small town. One command to the driver later and he found himself in front of another crowd that day, smiles all around, all until he asked, "Tell me, how have your lives been reshaped by the recent order?"\n\nSmiles turned strained, small shuffles between the residents, and answers spilled out their mouths. "It's been fine-" "Different, but still the same life-" "Some improvements across the-"\n\n"NOTHING-" Madrazo turned towards the rapidly approaching outburst, a woman with hands on her hips and isolated herself from the small crowd. "-HAS CHANGED! Forgive me, Your Excellency, but we have not seen a single one of your promises here. The Americans, they- they bribed the CNC rep! Paid him off like always, lets us take whatever they want to do to us and he looks the other way!"\n\nNow here he sits, a few days since that encounter had gone by. The desperation that was seared into her voice reverberating each time he glanced down at the initial investigation reports. He ordered one immediately after arriving back at the Presidential Palace, and there was a worrying sign developing as each paragraph after paragraph made clear."

MEX_Madrazo.50.desc: "Enrique picked up the radio and ran, hugging the news close to his chest as he pushed forward, catching his breath as his knuckles rapped onto the door. The Ramirez household didn't have a radio so he made sure to turn up the volume enough for everyone to hear once the door finally opened.\n\n"Enrique, what's gotten..." The man who answered the door felt his voice leave him as the radio continued to blare out its message.\n\n"...nd with the declaration of the use of Article 27, it essentially means that His Excellency Madrazo will now nationalize every foreign agribusiness, from Yucatán to Baja, in their entirety. Along with this, His Excellency plans to redistribute these lands among currently existing Ejidos and to further the creation of new ones, His Excellency..."\n\nDoor to door, Enrique ran, radio next to his heart, along with the growing following behind him, bringing drinks and food as they got closer to their final destination. Slowly, this time, the Radio sang its tune of Hope as it stepped on the land of a former agribusiness, now, it belonged to them. A Great Fiesta- one greater than any he had seen, at least, truly began when the first song of the night started its tune.\n\nThe first man started, "The capital kept growing, and it grew with it..." Drawing out the end to let someone else jump in.\n\n"The tough ones were beaten- and the weak ones, bought off..." A woman this time, following the example of the first.\n\nAnd another man joined in. "To solidify the state, with fire and Constitution. So many workers have had their voices stolen..."\n\n"Enough with living in this lie for so long!" A particularly rowdy voice declared. "Between workers and bosses, we share little history."\n\n"They have stolen our voice!" "They have stolen our voice, yours and mine!"

MEX_Madrazo.51.t: "The Canned Heat"
MEX_Madrazo.51.desc: "The Cannery - they called it "the Cannery" because its legal name was unpronounceable Japanese gibberish - was the bane of Colonia Cuauhtémoc's existence. Owned by one of the Zaibatsu in Japan, and managed by a Korean expat who could finally let out the pent up rage that had been building living under the Japanese his entire life. The Cannery was known to squeeze the ejido for every centavo it could, offering criminally low prices for the corn the campesinos grew. The Cannery would package the corn and send it off to upmarket grocery stores in Japan, while the farmers would walk away with scarcely enough to make their efforts worth it. And the campesinos would curse the fact the Cannery was the only one in their area, holding the village under a monopoly.\n\nIt was not the ejido village militant they expected to bring the good news. For too long he had promised the PRI would make things better, so much so everyone had stopped listening to him. But today he screamed with enough vigor and enthusiasm that everyone had to think he really did believe in the news he was spreading. And the teacher confirmed the words on the paper - the Cannery was going to be nationalized by the government! The paperwork was signed by Madrazo himself. And Mexico City was promising to buy the corn at a price floor better than the market!\n\nThe Priest's mind went to writing a sermon giving thanks to God for this act. Many housewives and children thought of the clothes, toys, and furnishings they could buy. A few more ambitious campesinos thought about the top of the line fertilizers and tools they could purchase to get even more money. But for many, they thought of one thing only. This was their ancestors throwing off the Spanish Hacienda. This was the oil being expropriated from the Americans and British. This was the rich Germans fleeing the coffee farms. Now, the arc of the Revolution had come for them.\n\nWhen the crowd arrived at the Cannery, they found the manager had already turned tail and ran. The workers there were not sorry to see him go - in fact the rumors of profit sharing had made them more than open to this new arrangement. So much so they didn't mind that the Campesinos stormed the front office, smashed the Japanese sign on the roof, and hung the Mexican Flag while singing "¡Viva México, Viva América!" In fact, the main disagreement with the Ejido the Cannery had was what patriotic name to give it."

He opened Ambassador Fulton Freeman's first, feeling that Hayashi Kaoru's stilted, stuffy notice of complaint would be a dish best served cold.\n\n"It is the wish of this administration that the government of the United Mexican States move away from this course of action..." Madrazo poured over excerpts, skipping the parts he couldn't be bothered reading. One line mentioned the nationalisation programme as an "uncourteous act", making him emit a wry laugh. The letter was left tossed to the wayside.\n\nHayashi Kaoru wrote sternly of the "hostility" shown by the Madrazo government. It was against the spirit of the "historic relationship between the Empire of Japan and Mexico" that the President should resort to "actions which breach the diplomatic bond." The secretary returned with two crisp pages in his hands just as Madrazo discarded the Japanese letter.\n\n"Excellency, telegrams from the Secretariats of External Relations and Commerce and Industry have just been received!\n\n"Bad news?"\n\n"Reporting massive investment loss, diplomatic condemnation-"\n\n"Set them on the desk and get out."\n\nThe secretary obeyed and left just as quickly as he had entered, leaving Madrazo to deal with the bureaucratic panic.

Recommending restraint on issues of trade?"\n\nWichtrich shrugged, nursing a cigarillo that he smoked from. "Whatever you think. We don't want to push him into going even farther by trading barbs."\n\n"I wonder why he didn't go all the way, so to speak." Freeman slid the roller.\n\n"He knows he can't piss us and the investors off too much, but he has to throw the Cardenistas a bone or two.

He wanted to go riding with the horses under the morning heat, his father teaching him how to handle the reins, keeping a close eye, showing him how to feed them their little oatcakes - but all Carlos got for his trouble was a stay indoors. Píoquinto Madrazo López was on a business trip and was not at home.\n\nHis mother, Concepción Becerra, remained at the house, entrusted with the boy's care. She gently ushered him back to the dinner table. The chair Carlos climbed onto made an awful creak, which made mother put a finger on her lips to hush him. The noise was particularly apparent whenever one moved the chair a certain way, and Carlos usually did this out of boredom; a habit his mother made a point of trying to rebuke during reading lessons. "Follow my finger, Carlitos. What does the first sentence say?"\n\n"Benito Juárez..."\n\nConcepción nodded, revealing a small, encouraging smile, awaiting more.\n\n"...the hero, came to the capital.

For his trouble, Gómez, the old war dog, looked unphased; scribbling shorthand onto Public Education stationery with his novel ballpoint.\n\n"I don't think the air conditioner is working," Heroles pushed himself up, fiddling with the window unit's dials. They turned easy - the Guangdong machine was well-made, alright - but whether or not it was doing anything was anyone's guess. He felt sickly.\n\n"Sit down." Gómez didn't even bother looking up, his eyes scrutinising something more important.

"A new proposal: primary school teachers who are willing to take on afternoon preschool duties will get bonus pay. Requirements will favour university-educated teachers to take on these roles."\n\nHeroles felt himself nearly shrug. Inoffensive, fine; not seeing the importance of the matter that Gómez's steely look seemed to suggest. But then it clicked. "You think the teachers' union will fight it?"\n\nGómez smiled in a rueful sort of way. "Quite. Who knows, the SNTE might even get Don Fidel Velázquez involved."\n\n"This needs to be done regardless, Secretary.

She continued to mumble to herself under her breath. "Such a dangerous part of town, too. You should be out here, but you are too busy doing god knows what." All around her, the hustle and bustle of the city streets she called home got just a little bit louder as the kids finally got let out of the former brothel-turned-public preschool.\n\nSifting through the crowd of girls looking for Rosita's new teacher proved to be a challenge, though she spun around after feeling a small hand tug her shirt. "Camila!"\n\n"Come here, you. Let's get you home to your father."\n\nAs the two walked home, hands held tightly, Camila's cautious scanning of the streets was interrupted by a blurb from below.\n\n"Library."\n\n"Huh?

Better she spend time with me than getting up to no good, Camila thought. A three year old needs someone to play with.\n\n"Camila, look." Her small hand pointed towards the loud noises coming from the construction development across the street. "Houses."\n\n"Isn't that something." Camila stopped to look at the new complex, complete with multiple floors, balconies, and what seemed like multi-room condos, at least from what she could gather through the scaffolding.

In the foreground is a wooden podium with the coat of arms of the Free and Sovereign State of Jalisco. Behind them are the Mexican and Jalascan flags, and a banner with the words "LIVE HEALTHY - LIVE BETTER." In front of them are an audience of white coated medical staff applauding as they smile for the camera.\nThe Event: A public unveiling of new plans for the Hospital. With the help of the federal government and the state's secretariat of health, Sayula Municipal Hospital has been given a new funding grant, substantially larger than the old ones. The money has been earmarked for building improvements like new plumbing and a state of the art HVAC system to improve patient comfort and reduce particles in the operating and recovery rooms. Also included in these renovations are funds specifically for a new examination wing with new photographic and X-ray equipment to aid in diagnosis.\nThe Context: Sayula is the center of a series of farming communities centered around the lake that also shares the same name. Its hospital is the biggest medical facility in the local area, and it has not been getting the attention it deserves from the government. With this correction, the hospital can treat and diagnose residents with a level of care much closer to the one found in the city of Guadalajara to the north. Continued investment will ensure Sayula, and Jalisco, and all of Mexico, will have the health facilities they need to fight Mexico's campaign against poverty and deprivation.\nThe Truth: The hospital director is grateful for the funding, and the money will go towards the renovations. But the larger issue is being ignored - in fact, covered up. The white dressed members of the audience are not medical staff in any sense of the term. They are members of the local high school given the coats by the PRI in order to look impressive. In fact the real interns of the hospital have broken for the AMMRI and are nowhere near Sayula. At this moment they are marching outside of the Governor's residence in Guadalajara with compatriots from all over the state, demanding he meet with them."

He had smelt metal, rust, perhaps - or blood?\n\nA voice ricocheted off the walls, wherever they were in the darkness.

But one wrong word from Rámon and his career-his life-was over.\n\nHéctor yanked open another drawer. There! He snatched the folder out of the drawer and slapped it down on his desk. The pages inside were stained with guilt. Any lead that an investigator would want to follow was here, stamped in black ink on the ivory paper.\n\nHéctor's breaths grew shorter and shallower. He had to do something. He flipped through the report, removing the offending pages and tucking them into his leather briefcase. Maybe he could alter them? Hide the leads? He was a miracle worker with liquid paper. If that failed, he could burn them.\n\nHéctor buried his head in his hands then let it fall onto his desk with a thud. He had bribed Rámon. Right there with the pesos in the envelope. Would he talk? What if they offered him a plea deal?

It rolled along the desk, hitting the last document he had signed; the expulsion order for Vicente Alcaide, removing him from the ranks of the CNC.\n\nThe trouble was that it was a small world. Most of these expulsion orders Héctor had spent the last hour signing off were his friends, neighbours. He wondered how he would be able to look Señor Alcaide in the eye the next time he saw him - would he hide, explain himself? Such a domineering, tenacious man, left grovelling at the feet of acquaintances for forgiveness. They were not his orders, yes, but would they believe that a man of his stature had no pull anymore?\n\nRámon Delgado's retirement had only made things worse. Men of his generation, good, honest, hardy party members, were dying out. There was no wheat to separate from the chaff with the new crop - leftists, radicals, Lombardists.

Héctor had already guessed this but didn't want to give too much away. Why should he be afraid, being such an upstanding official? "They're looking into the crop diversification scheme, there were some irregularities. I got a slap on the wrist."\n\nHéctor felt a cool relief soothe him. He had to stop himself from smiling. The bastards hadn't any idea about the tractor bribes.\n\n"I'm going to retire, Héctor. It's all been too much for me, this stress, this worry. I've had enough."\n\nThat relief blackened to gall.

The new crop as he liked to call them - the militant party youth who looked up to President Madrazo - had thrown themselves into voluntarism, spurring a new back-to-the-land movement. Not that he disapproved of the good work they were doing, but it was his good work. His duty. What did they know about anything?\n\nClearly something.

Don Fidel Velázquez saw the pictures on the front page of La República a few days later from the comfort of his office.

"The transportation plan for Mexico City?"\n\n"Uruchurtu left this piece of shit on my desk," said Corona del Rosal, new regent of the Federal District. For emphasis, del Rosal took the binder it came in and threw it all in the trash with a furious shove. The smack of paper and the clang of metal startled Sierra, but it soon gave way to satisfaction.\n\n"You see the slums, you know these people aren't going to be helped by lanes on highways," del Rosal said. "I'm here to stop this dicking around and cut through the bullshit. Mister Secretary, I want the Metro."\n\nSierra smiled. That was it. The Ciudad Mexico Metro, the obvious solution to the city bursting at its seams with slums and sprawl. To put the city on the level of New York, Tokyo, Germania, London.

They somehow still refused to do the sensible thing and duck out of the way, and had decided that stopping this project was the hill they wanted to die on. So he called a meeting to make it clear to them they needed to get it together and stop blocking work from starting. But it would be a bad idea to confront them directly.

His heart sank deep in his chest. A storm would normally wreak havoc by tearing houses, roads, and railways asunder, yet this one was doing the exact opposite. The irony was not lost on him.\n\nPhase one of the proposal involved land surveying of indigenous regions and the construction of roads to link them to nearby towns and cities. Once that was done, phase two would kickstart economic development with a mass public sector building project. Hospitals, police stations, offices, and schools would be built up in each of these newly developed areas. Yet Beltrán couldn't help but wonder how much of this was for economic reasons and how much of it was to force the indigenous to integrate into Mexican society.\n\nWhile it was repulsive to every fibre in his body, there was no question of being able to veto this.

He chatted so excitedly, his hands moving all over the place, his grin infecting the worker Pascal was facing, handing her child something before he finally ran back to her.\n\n"Na'! Na'! Look!"

Beltrán, for his trouble, could not hide the indignation on his face - much apparent by his strained brow.\n\n"I have much respect for the President, but he is making a mistake.

The State had dealt the indigenous a cruel hand for decades, yes, but this was something else entirely - it was now going to bulldoze their existence and pave it over to carve out a new concrete tapestry in the name of infrastructure.

Better amenities for the bathrooms were on the list of demands, but at this moment, watching his tears seep through the thin disposable sheets, it didn't seem important at all, no matter how far down the list. Like the dirty mirrors just one stall door away, Artuo reflected on his sad state. Years of work and education had gotten him this position. Blood, sweat, and tears, all wasted. Was he wrong? No. Arturo flushed his sizable pile of tear-sodden toilet paper into the water. He watched between his legs as the evidence of his sadness was washed away. Perhaps this was the wrong place for him. Medicine wasn't the only career; he was an intelligent young man who could retrain. Even then, perhaps there would be better opportunities in the States.

Making an example of each and every striker that still continued to threaten public order, arresting them for years at minimum. This would be costly. This would be long. This would require another reminder to the general public how much power the law had. But it would be strong, wide-ranging, and prevent any notion of another rising from the ashes.\n\nThe second, targeting only those at the top of the movement. Each leader would be broadcasted, their crime of spreading chaos and disorder being printed in each paper, and they would all be damned. This was less costly, faster, and could be done quietly without flexing the presence of the law too much. However, it would not guarantee another movement being able to rise up.

With these as the prime exhibit, they argued for improvements in the medical system.\n\nTo anyone with the ability to read between the lines, however, something was extremely clear aside from the usual performative calls for improvement. The FSTSE was laying claim to the solution of this problem. No external union, no faction unaligned with the CNOP or the PRI more generally could provide medical professionals with relief.
