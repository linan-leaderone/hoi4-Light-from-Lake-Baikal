 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 KZR_Mikhail_Solomentsev: "Mikhail Solomentsev"
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_SOLOMENTSEV_DESC: "Mikhail Sergeyevich Solomentsev is nothing if not hard to pin down. To some audiences, he portrays himself as the only true communist left in Kazakhstan - yet he has a history of decidedly unprincipled scandals surrounding his marriage. He deplores "Kazakh chauvinism" in his every speech, and yet his "Soviet Group" works with open chauvinists more radical than he ever could be. How can one understand the man who never explains himself?\n\nThe answer is less interesting than one might expect. Solomentsev is not a radical Communist. He is tactical, and he has made many allies with many positions, but he simply sees his view of the Soviet Union as the norm, one he has held since he was first assigned to Kazakhstan in the twilight years of Stalin's government. To him, his love of Russia, Stalin, and the Former Union are all one and the same. All of this was the Soviet Union, the greatest nation ever created. All of this was ours.\n\nKazakhstan simply needs to understand this reality."
 KZR_Nikolai_Shchelokov: "Nikolai Shchelokov"
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_SHCHELOKOV_DESC: "In the vast expanse of Northern Kazakhstan, an unusual scene unfolded as Nikolai Anisimovich Shchelokov, a bureaucrat from Luhansk, became a regional police leader. His ascent was a byzantine chain of promotions—many he may not have been fully qualified for. Despite that, Russians loved him. He protected Russian businesses, lavishly rewarded Russian servants of the people, and stood up for Russian refugees entering the border. For some reason though, Kazakhs weren't quite as enamored.\n\nWhile deeply tied to the Soviet group, his devotion to Marxism was spotty. In spite of his outspokenness, few found coherence in the policies he espoused. What seemed to matter most to him was that he was revered as an icon, and a handful of roubles often put criticism to rest.\n\nAs war erupted, he took charge of the Russian Guard, militias devoted to the idea of the Russian state, whatever that might be. Shchelokov was the hero of Russia, the socialist union, Russia, the grand empire, and Russia, the country with the best benefit schemes. Whether this enigmatic man could unify these strange bedfellows and restore this brotherly republic to the loving embrace of the Motherland remained to be seen."

 KZR_remnants_of_fitins_web: "Remnants of Fitin's Web"
 KZR_remnants_of_fitins_web_desc: "Lacking a proper organized military, the Russian's will have to make do with the remnants of Fitin's NKVD. Despite their inexperience and lack of organization, this motley collection of militias, partisans, and reformed bandits and the rumors of their bloodthirsty ferocity has already caused a cloud of deep unease to settle over the surrounding countryside."
 KZR_stomach_of_kazakhstan: "Stomach of Kazakhstan"
 KZR_stomach_of_kazakhstan_desc: "Though much of Kazakhstan's urban industry temporarily lies outside of Russian hands, they hold perhaps an even more valuable treasure. Above the earth sway endless fields of grain to fill their people's bellies, and below lucrative natural resources to fill their pockets, after the land has been... expropriated, of course. For the time being, their ramshackle armies will at least be well fed and well paid. It's a start."
 KZR_despair_not_identity: "Despair, Not Identity"
 KZR_despair_not_identity_desc: "For all the late-Soviet Union claimed that the workers of the world belonged to one nation, the reality on the ground is much different. The Russians of Kazakhstan feel little affinity to their new home, nor given up their nationalist attachment to their motherland. Though countless hoards have enlisted in the army, few would sacrifice themselves for it, and more than a few would gladly betray their comrades for an extra food ration."
 KZR_any_flag_any_tactic: "Any Flag, Any Tactic"
 KZR_any_flag_any_tactic_desc: "Shchelokov will agree to any policy, any warlord, or any concept that empowers his state and seamlessly shift his rhetoric to justify pretty much anything to his base. This makes him adaptable to any issue and consistently popular with the people. However, this also leaves assembly rooms teeming with different opinions, tempers flaring over plans constantly conflicting, often leaving workers and soldiers sitting on their thumbs as their leaders engaged in heated discourse."
 KZR_not_divided_but_torn: "Not Divided, But Torn"
 KZR_not_divided_but_torn_desc: "Whatever bureaucracy exists is stretched to its limits. Departments wage war over jurisdiction. Project funding appears and disappears in the blink of an eye. Commissariats oscillate between loyalties to different governments. The idea of ministries ever regaining a semblance of order remains more a hopeful concept than a tangible reality."
 KZR_the_soviet_group: "The Soviet Group"
 KZR_the_soviet_group_desc: "To most Kazakhs, the Soviet Group was a non-entity in their lives, yet it now firmly controls every lever of power. The only thing more total than the people's surprise at this sudden rise is their grip on the state, even in the wake of Almaty's death. While it faces opposition from those who see its ascension as the height of Russian chauvinism, its immense authority makes them untouchable."
