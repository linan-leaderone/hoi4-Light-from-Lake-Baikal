 #leader bio
 POLITICS_KEITH_HOLYOAKE_DESC:0 "Keith Holyoake is a man known for many things - his level-headedness, thick accent, and reputation for being overly polite amongst them. Holyoake's origins lie in the rural areas of New Zealand, being the son of a pair of store owners turned farmers. Joining the rurally-focused Reform Party in 1932, Holyoake quickly became a rising star in the party, playing a key role in reforming it into the modern National Party.\n\nTaking the role of Prime Minister in the First National Government, Holyoake presided over National's loss in 1957, following the resignation of previous Prime Minister Sidney Holland in 1956. Three years were spent as leader of the opposition, before going on to win the 1960 General Election, earning the position in his own right.\n\nAdvocating for maintenance of a strong national defense against the ever-present threat of the Japanese, Holyoake's ministry has already begun to pursue a progressive social agenda of abolishing capital punishment and expanding Māori rights. As the 1963 General Election looms closer, Holyoake hopes that New Zealand will continue to endorse his vision."

NZL_Culture_War:0 "The Culture War - Anglo Dominance"
NZL_Culture_War_desc:0 "The lifeblood of the New Zealand economy flows from the Pacific. Imports, particularly from American markets, are crucial to New Zealand's economy. Thus, American culture often finds outsized influence against local culture.\n\nAt present, the Union Jack still flies proudly over New Zealand. British culture remains dominant. Still, we hear those snide whispers when our backs are turned. Are we truly the 'White Trash of the Pacific?' Or are we simply bold enough to retain our traditions?"

NZL_Establishment:0 "A More Harmonious Establishment"
NZL_Establishment_desc:0 "Since the proclamation of self-governance in 1907, our government has sought to represent and benefit the good people of New Zealand. So far, Wellington has done a decent job: the government is stable, Parliament is cordial enough, and the people's faith in our political establishment is at an acceptable level. So long as this peace holds, New Zealand will remain a bastion of political stability for decades to come."

NZL_Onto_World_Stage:0 "Onto the World Stage - Bearer of the Torch"
NZL_Onto_World_Stage_desc:0 "Whether you are the greatest superpower or the smallest observer, you must carry the torch of liberty across the entire globe. This is a cornerstone of New Zealand's current foreign policy, and it is reflected in their eagerness to join the OFN in crusades against fascism all over the world. Still, New Zealand is a small country, and its reach sometimes exceeds its grasp."

NZL_Social_Fabric:0 "The Social Fabric - §GStable§!"
NZL_Social_Fabric_desc:0 "The social fabric of New Zealand holds the nation together, yet there are many dangers which threaten to pull at it, stretch it, rip it apart.\n\nFortunately, the tapestry at the foundation of New Zealand remains strong and unfrayed. The people are united and hopeful about the direction of our society. So long as our social fabric holds, our nation shall not fall into darkness and despair"
