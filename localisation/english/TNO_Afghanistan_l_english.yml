 ## Leader Descs ##
 POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ZAHIR_SHAH_DESC: "Born in 1914, taking the throne in 1933, Mohammad Zahir Shah has reigned for three decades. For the first two decades, he let his uncles rule as Prime Minister under him—first there was Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan, who ruled despotically for seventeen years until the end of the War. Then came Sardar Mohammad Mahmud Khan, brother to his predecessor, who oversaw slow liberalisation and progressive policy until political parties formed, Afghanistan's economy was destabilised, and Mahmud Khan's irrigation projects failed. Finally in 1953 there came his cousin, Daoud Khan, who presided over mass development and modernization, funded by foreign aid.\n\nBut the story of Zahir Shah was not limited to Afghanistan itself. The fall of the Russian communists brought Germans and Japanese to take their position as Afghanistan's prime backer, funding 40% of the Afghan budget - a great sum compared to the 7% of tax revenue brought by tax on land and agriculture.\n\nTheir backing, and Zahir Shah's successful exploiting of foreign events, allowed Afghanistan to become a regional power with well-calculated invasions and diplomatic plays: attacks on the Tajiks up to the Shakhdara River, support for the Turkestan Legionaries' invasion, protecting the Muslim League and Jinnah from their enemies in Delhi and weakening the nascent Pakistani Army in one fell swoop. Jinnah's demise left Afghanistan with two protectorates, access to the sea, and a step closer to the dream of Pashtunistan. The cherry on the top: recognizing Calcutta as the government of India, pleasing Tokyo and infuriating Delhi in one fell swoop.\n\nWith his cousin as his right-hand man and the Tajik lands consolidated, Zahir Shah thinks himself as at the top of the world. But his rule is threatened: political movements are growing, Delhi, Central Asia, and Xinjiang are preparing revenge, and Afghanistan's patrons are slipping into chaos. Worse yet, the King can tell his prime ministerial cousin has greater ambitions than mere loyal service. But the King has greater concerns: he must bring another decade of success, so that he and Afghanistan may prosper yet more."

 ### Ideas ###
 AFG_The_Split_Pashtunkhwa: "The Split Pashtunkhwa"
 AFG_The_Split_Pashtunkhwa_desc: "Despite gains in the 50s against the Indian unity government and in Central Asia, the question of "Pashtunistan" as a concept remains unsolved. Zahir Shah's decision to invade Balochistan, giving safe haven to the Pakistan movement after Delhi's declaration of an emergency in the Western Provinces, gave way to a partial solution: breaking the Durand Line and annexing Quetta and Northern Balochistan. Thereafter came the formation of the FPCA and the subordination of the Khanate of Kalat after Afghan forces combined with Pakistani ones (which had done most of the work) to hold the unity government at the gate.\n\nToday the status quo favours the Afghan state. But trouble is brewing. Discontent and continued clashes in the new lands, hostility with Delhi, and the staunch Pashtun nationalist stance of Daoud Khan leave Afghanistan with no choice but to defuse this ticking time bomb once and for all - or let it explode, and face the cost."

 AFG_Gateways_Between_Worlds: "Gateways Between Worlds"
 AFG_Gateways_Between_Worlds_desc: "Prime Minister Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan's tenure saw Afghan-Axis relations reach historic highs. Not even his brother's replacing him in 1946 stopped it; continued pro-Axis sentiment and aid from both new great powers came flooding into the nation. It took the split of the Axis into the Einheitspakt and the Kyōeiken to really destabilise it. That schism left the Afghans in an awkward position of still reaping benefits from both partnerships but being too distant from either to gain fuller benefit.\n\nComplicating factors are many. Afghanistan served as the gateway to Central Asia for the Turkestan Legion and the Pakistan Movement. Meddling in both regions secured Afghanistan's role as a regional power but radicalised them all into anti-Afghan hostility; the only thing that prevented that biting Kabul was the still-fervid internecine conflicts in both areas. Closer to home, however, nascent Marxist and reformist influence coming from all sides - Central Asia, Xinjiang, Iran - threaten the monarchist order by influencing political debate and struggle within Afghanistan.\n\nThese contradictions are tempered for now thanks to domestic political stability. But if these issues return at an inopportune time, they may well bring Afghanistan to its knees."

 AFG_The_Two_Mohammeds: "The Two Mohammeds"
 AFG_The_Two_Mohammeds_desc: "'The Two Mohammeds', an informal nickname given to the two cousins the King of Afghanistan and his Prime Minister, have been the focal point of Afghan politics for a decade.\n\nAbove there sits the reformist, velvet-gloved Mohammad Zahir Shah; his supporters are neutralists, moderates, conservatives, traditionalist aristocrats, and Uzbeks and Tajiks. Below him is the iron-fisted modernist Mohammad Daoud Khan, the darling of Germanophiles and Japanophiles and friend to all Pashtun nationalists and radical modernisers.\n\nAs the third decade of the King's reign and the first decade of Daoud Khan's time as Prime Minister approaches, their once-friendly relationship is beginning to show stark divides. The King and his head of government's differing stances and support groups are putting them in a power struggle that is slowly enveloping their own country. Whereas both seek stability for their nation, the outcome of their internecine conflict could well prevent that from being the end result."

 AFG_Embryonic_Political_Structures: "Embryonic Political Structures"
 AFG_Embryonic_Political_Structures_desc: "Sardar Mohammad Hashim Khan ruled harshly as Prime Minister for seventeen years, suppressing press rights and publications as quickly as imams uttered the name of Allah in the local mosques. Zahir Shah, seeking a more progressive direction, replaced him with his brother Mahmud in 1946. The result was a slow liberalisation and relaxed censorship—which in turn triggered a political awakening.\n\nThe Wesh Dzalmian, Awakened Youth, movement emerged in 1947 and entered the Wolesi Jirga in 1949. In opposition to the government there emerged a united front called the Jebha-ye Melli, National Front, in spite of political splits. Wesh Dzalmian became a party; Ghubar's men formed the Hezb-e Watan (Fatherland Party), while Mahmudi formed the Hezb-e Khalq, the People's Party.\n\nThe response of the government was to suppress all three parties and publications; today, they are underground with dubious reports claiming to confirm their and others' existence. Daoud Khan's accession in 1953 accelerated this trend, aided by Pakistani and Transoxianan conflict. But the current disorganisation is only temporary: if the parties emerge again, they will be harder and stronger - and more organised."
