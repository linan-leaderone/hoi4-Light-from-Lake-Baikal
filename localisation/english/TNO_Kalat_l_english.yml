 POLITICS_MIR_AHMAD_YAR_KHAN_DESC: "Mir Ahmad Yar Khan Ahmedzai, Khan of Kalat, has had a long and comparatively conventional life, as the lives of Baloch khans go. When he came into the world in 1902, India from Kalat to Kachin was dominated by the British, and it was in this context that Mir Ahmad Yar grew up. In the 1920s he was a loyal agent of British intelligence, reporting on the growing Russian influence and the spread of Marxist sympathies among his poorer subjects. In the 1930s, after he became Khan of Kalat, the British rewarded his loyalty with a high decoration - the Order of the Indian Empire.\n\nThings went to hell as the British rule over India collapsed. At this time, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, until recently the Khan's legal advisor, urged Mir Ahmad Yar Khan to back the concept of an independent Islamic state in the Indus Valley. He offered his support, most eagerly in fact despite the objections of his more independent-minded brothers, and watched with cautious optimism at first during the Western Emergency in its chaotic attempt to establish a Pakistani nation.\n\nAlas, the ramshackle movement was unable to hold up completely against the enemy governments to its east, and Jinnah managed as an emergency measure to secure the Afghans' support in an intervention in order to prevent a total loss of their potential influence in the area. Years have passed and the Khan of Kalat has at last come to a full appreciation of his situation.\n\nThe Khan knows quite well that his government is propped up by the Afghans. If the Afghan support was to evaporate tomorrow, it would all come to an end very rapidly. He also knows that his separatist brothers are untrustworthy; they and their damn fool dreams of a 'free Balochistan' would lead only to ruin. Above all he is fully aware that though his friend Jinnah, the Quaid-e-Azam, is no more, the Pakistan movement persists, and would more than welcome his support, if not his outright joining to Pakistan.\n\nBut the Khan will bide his time before doing something like that. The time is not yet ripe, and the Pakistanis simply don't have enough support yet. But he has time. If there is one thing Mir Ahmad Yar Khan is good at, it is waiting and seeing. When the Indians in their folly slip and fall, the Khan will seize his opportunity."
