GER_Espionage_deploy_entdecker_sats_desc:0 "ENTDECKER satellites are an advanced technology that the [getIntelAgencyShort] has invented. With a significant investment into these satellites, the hope is to deploy them across states that we have an interest in - our own, neutral countries, or unfriendly countries, it matters not. The [getIntelAgencyShort] has promised that they will be extremely useful in gathering intel in the form of mass photographs. So long as they remain uncaught."

GER_Espionage_contact_oktan_desc:0 "Mikhail Oktan, the Chairman of the Russian Liberation Army, has already collaborated with the Reich in the past. His regime now stands as one of the potential candidates for a Russian reunification, and his hatred for communism makes him a logical partner in our struggle against the Judeo-Bolsheviks. Reports also indicate that Oktan's rule is highly unstable and corrupt, and thus, he wouldn't pose as much of a threat to the Reich should he choose to turn his back on us. As of now, supporting his bid for reunification would serve our interests, as a weak Russia is very beneficial to our position. We will launch an operation to contact Oktan and offer our support."

GER_Espionage_aid_oktan_desc:0 "As agreed beforehand, the Reich will supply Oktan's regime with weapons to fight against the Bolsheviks and other Russian warlords. There are many smuggler's routes connecting Moskowien and West Russia, and we shall use those to deliver on our promises. Reports indicate that Oktan's administration is incredibly corrupt, and some of our supplies will surely not reach the ROA's troops. As a weaker Russia is in our interests, this shall not be a problem."

GER_Espionage_aid_onega:0 "§GUnternehmen Schild§!"
GER_Espionage_aid_onega_desc:0 "The Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard of Onega has stood as a bulwark against Bolshevism since the end of the West Russian War. The Guard was born as Finland sought to protect its borders against communists and bandits among the warlords in West Russia, and many see Onega as a Finnish puppet. Now, the Guard is under attack by a warlord seeking to unite the West Russian region. While Onega's cause is almost certainly a lost one, sending them aid would delay the regional unification and weaken whichever Russian state emerges victorious from this war."

GER_Espionage_sabotage_RWS_unification_talks:0 "§BUnternehmen Vertrauen§! - §YRussia§!"
GER_Espionage_sabotage_RWS_unification_talks_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the Bürgerkrieg drove our necessary attention from the affairs of warlord Russia, where Ivans used their time to eliminate their warlord competitors and organize themselves into several powerful states, threatening to unite and unleash their hordes against the Vaterland once again.\n\nAs long as we still entertain our influence in Siberia, we must prevent the Russian states from peaceful unification. Through sabotaging their negotiations, sowing distrust between them and turning warlords against each other, we can ensure that even if Russia reunites again, it will be torn apart by its internal struggles."

GER_Espionage_aid_batovs_insurgency:0 "§QUnternehmen Kreuzritter§!"
GER_Espionage_aid_batovs_insurgency_desc:0 "The West Siberian Provisional Authority represents a great danger to the Reich. This government, led by the Siberian Black League, has based its ideology upon the hatred of Germany and National Socialism, and they cannot be allowed to expand their control over Russia anymore. Through great effort, our agents have learned that they are dealing with an insurgency led by a former Soviet general, who most likely came from the leadership of the Ural Military District. We shall send funds to this movement and kill this anti-German warlord in its cradle."

GER_Espionage_fuck_men:0 "§gUnternehmen Teufel§!"
GER_Espionage_fuck_men_desc:0 "The Eastern frontiers of Russia have been united under the destructive cult of "Father" Alexander Men, who assembled his dark and unenlightened rabble to shatter the remains of the Bolshevik forces and Japanese lapdogs in the region. Not being satisfied with his recent conquests, Men seeks to direct his hordes to the West, converting the entire Russia into his villainous religion.\n\nTo our advantage, Men is so immersed in his insanity, he refuses to acknowledge reality around himself, including the fact that his top lieutenant, former NKVD agent Pavel Sudoplatov, wants to act independent from his cult and plots to topple him as soon as opportunity presents itself. If we encourage Sudoplatov's voluntaristic tendencies, we can break the Father's "Divine Mandate" long before it can threaten us."

GER_Espionage_help_yockey:0 "§rUnternehmen Kuckucksvögel§!"
GER_Espionage_help_yockey_desc:0 "Francis Parker Yockey is an eccentric man, but it can't be denied that he is the most influential pro-German voice in the National Progressive Pact and that his "All-American National Vanguard" represents the most nationally conscious parts of America.\n\nAlthough few public officials and businessmen would ever consider to lobby for them, our operatives in the United States can provide them special funding to help the Fascist faction achieve their ambitious goals. Whether they can become a viable political force or not, it is important to have those "Sovereigns" as our mouthpiece within the enemy territory."

GER_Espionage_discredit_l_npp_desc:0 "America is the home of many degenerative vices, and communism is no exception. Although not numerous, the Communist elements within the National Progressive Pact withhold considerable authority among America's poor and miserable, capable to rally their base at first call.\n\nWhether or not they can obtain the reins of power in America, their influence must be suppressed. For all their faults, the Americans have little love for the Communist dictatorship and they surely will be responsive towards our efforts to discredit the largest bastion of Bolshevism in America."

GER_Espionage_disrupt_ofn_unity_canada:0 "§RUnternehmen Erikson§!"
GER_Espionage_disrupt_ofn_unity_canada_desc:0 "The Organization of Free Nations, as they call themselves, have long been a thorn in the side of the Reich. After all, it is in this very organization that Judeo-Bolshevism runs rampant and free. In order to prevent the growth of America's power, we will work to sabotage American-Canadian relations. With the release of a few recordings, doctored or not, and a reminder to a few prominent Canadians about America's historical lack of respect, we may be able to drive a wedge between Canada and America, thus leaving the OFN bickering and disunited, unable to stand against the might of the Reich."

GER_Espionage_disrupt_ofn_unity_australia:0 "§GUnternehmen Nervenkitzel§!"
GER_Espionage_disrupt_ofn_unity_australia_desc:0 "Australia and America are allies of convenience, and nothing more. If Australia had not been connected to Britain, it is unlikely America would have given them a second thought. To further the divide between the member states of the OFN, we need only remind Australia of this. To further add insult to injury, we could forge documents showing that America views Australia as a viable concession to the Japanese, were it to come to that. The truth of this is, of course, debatable, but we would certainly not put it past them."

GER_Espionage_sabotage_mandate_congo:0 "§BUnternehmen Schlange§! - §YCongo§!"
GER_Espionage_sabotage_mandate_congo_desc:0 "Send agents into the Congo to supply German forces still left behind. These veterans will then cause further chaos in the mandate by fighting American troops and killing natives, causing yet more problems for the Americans to deal with."

GER_Espionage_sabotage_mandate_angola:0 "§BUnternehmen Schlange§! - §YAngola§!"
GER_Espionage_sabotage_mandate_angola_desc:0 "Send agents into Angola to supply German forces still left behind. These veterans will then cause further chaos in the mandate by fighting American troops and killing natives, causing yet more problems for the Americans to deal with."

GER_Espionage_sabotage_mandate_east:0 "§BUnternehmen Schlange§! - §YEast Africa§!"
GER_Espionage_sabotage_mandate_east_desc:0 "The inefficient Hüttig administration left a great mess in Ostafrika, but thankfully, we are not the ones dealing with this mess. Driving the forces of the late Reichskommissar out of our former domain, the Americans inherited the administrative failures of Hüttig and got themselves involved in an endless war against the savage hordes of the dark continent.\n\nAs the OFN generals have little means to enforce their rule over the African mongrels, it won't be difficult to destabilize the region further and make them regret bringing their youth to those hopeless lands."

GER_Espionage_aid_the_aas:0 "§OUnternehmen Kondor§!"
GER_Espionage_aid_the_aas_desc:0 "For as much of a bastard mongrel state as Iberia is, Franco and Salazar have earned some of our respect for their strength of will and determination to keep their states alive. It would truly be a shame if Iberia were to fall to separatists, especially those that seem to lean so red in ideology. To prevent the specter of Bolshevism from returning to Europe, we will send operatives to sabotage these separatists and their devious plots, giving the advantage to the Iberian Axencia Anti-Seperatista forces. Additionally, in doing so, perhaps we will also be finally able to convince the Iberians that the Reich is an ally, rather than a threat."

GER_Espionage_push_iberia_to_authdem_council:0 "§gUnternehmen Gehhilfe§!"
GER_Espionage_push_iberia_to_authdem_council_desc:0 "As it became known, the Caudillos of the Iberian Union delegated their governing responsibilities to the Iberian Council, a single legislative body representing different nations and classes of the country.\n\nWhile it is in our best interests to protect the Council from the monopoly of Caudillos, our leadership is concerned about the possibility of liberal dominance in the Iberian politics. Using our assets in Iberia, we can influence various factions within the Council towards our favor."

GER_Espionage_help_blue_division:0 "§BUnternehmen Blau§!"
GER_Espionage_help_blue_division_desc:0 "We have received news that the Blue Division veterans in the warring Spain attempted to contact our operatives in order to request aid for their future endeavours. Although serving under the Falangist banner, the clique of José Luis de Arrese desires to spread the light of National Socialism in Iberia and establish closer ties with the Reich, in contrast to their more reluctant Falangist superiors.\n\nAlthough their numbers are humble, their will is sincere and their offer appears to be promising. Should we enable them, they can potentially become an independent power in the Wars, unmatched by the degenerate offspring of the late Francoist regime."

GER_Espionage_aid_spanish_fascists:0 "Send Aid to the Spanish Fascists"
GER_Espionage_aid_spanish_fascists_desc:0 "From war comes opportunity, and much opportunity has been laid out in the battlegrounds of Iberia. Among the disparate factions that fight over the future, the hard-right has settled in and began their fight for Iberia's future- something that could pay off in spades for the Reich. Of course, the Reich can only reap the spoils of war if the fascists of Iberia succeed. As such, we shall supply them with arms and ammunition in order to keep them one step ahead of their rivals."

GER_Espionage_mess_with_battle_for_italy:0 "§GUnternehmen Stahl§!"
GER_Espionage_mess_with_battle_for_italy_desc:0 "Italy has proved to be a thorn in our side on its own, but now her position poses an even greater threat to us at the time as America and Japan are struggling to include Italy in their sphere and establish an outpost in Europe to counterbalance the will of the Reich.\n\nFortunately, there are remaining powerful voices within Italy that want to see the country staying aside during the Cold War. Facilitating their efforts and manipulating the public opinion, we can put significant pressure on the Italian government to discourage it from joining either of the rivaling blocs."

GER_Espionage_launch_NOR_coup:0 "§fUnternehmen Nordlicht§!"
GER_Espionage_launch_NOR_coup_desc:0 "With Norway currently under the control of a hostile parliamentary government our interests and position in Scandinavia are at a severe risk of falling apart completely. This is a state of affairs that has to be rectified immediately. §gHenrik Rogstad§! is the name of the man, who has proven himself to be the most loyal local to the Reich. Such loyalty shall be rewarded. We will send him everything he needs to put the current usurper government into the ground and drag Norway back into the fold of the Einheitspakt."

GER_Espionage_bug_enemies_desc:0 "We cannot have eyes and ears everywhere. However, we can still focus on efforts to gain information on places... and people. The [getIntelAgencyShort]'s bugging technology is perhaps one of its most useful, and we will begin covert operations to bug the more suspect members of the NSDAP - them, their houses, and the locations they frequent. And if there's anything we could find that would force them to listen to our regime or have their career perish; merely a side-benefit."

SGR_RND_infiltrate_thailand:0 "§RUnternehmen Singvogel§!"
SGR_RND_infiltrate_thailand_desc:0 "Our relationship with Japan and its sphere is less than pleasant. Some would even call it hostile, which has made insight into the workings of the Co-Prosperity Sphere difficult. However, there is a bastion - the Reich has an embassy in Thailand, and Singvongel will begin mobilizing the RND's assets to take full advantage of that fact. From there, we can begin probing further into the Japanese world."

SGR_RND_funnel_korsimat_men:0 "§RUnternehmen Zentralasien - Trichterpistolen§!"
SGR_RND_funnel_korsimat_men_desc:0 "The state of the weaponry and training of the Turkenstan Legion is pitiful at best, and disgraceful at worst. That being said, we simply do not have the time to make this marauder pack into something resembling actual professionalism, neither can we risk dispatching proper German guns, and risk these operations being traced back to us. What we can do, however, is move surplus from Iran itself, and arm the legion with weapons that aren't glorified ballistic pipes."

SGR_RND_infiltrate_uzbekistan_desc:0 "Uzbekistan's borders with the legion have been notably tense, the raiding and skirmish stories long and bloodied. Resources and communications are already difficult to efficiently manage within the Steppes, which for once works for our advantage. We will put soldiers within the Uzbek borders, and sabotage their defenses and operations. Once the Legion is ready to advance in their territory, they will find a weakened, crippled foe."

SGR_RND_korsimat_prepare_the_sniper:0 "§RUnternehmen Zentralasien - Adlerauge§!"
SGR_RND_korsimat_prepare_the_sniper_desc:0 "Most importantly, we need to find a means to justify Korsimat's coup, as well as getting rid of Veyuum. We will hire, with no string attached, a hunter from the Steppes, to take a "vacation" to Samarqand, see the sights, stay on a very incospicuous building, facing fairly distant from where we will incentivate Veyuum to make his speech, and make sure Korsimat's men assure the other members of the Legion there is nothing at all in this building."

SGR_RND_assassinate_korsimat:0 "§RUnternehmen Zentralasien - Frührente§!"
SGR_RND_assassinate_korsimat_desc:0 "Korsimat is the wildest card of the legion, a man with burning ambition, scorned by Veyuum, rampant and ruthless. He is a wild variable we simply cannot trust and cannot spare for our plans with the Legion, and a headache overrall.\n\nThankfully, such achings have effective medicines."

SGR_RND_establish_brazilian_bases_desc:0 "The long-forgotten continent of South America has begun to show developments of interest to the Reich. Now in charge of a proper, unified agency, Reinhard Gehlen will be ordered to establish the RND's presence in the nation of Brazil. While the country as a whole is opposed to the thought of aligning with Germany, further operations in this country will allow us to manipulate their politics and push them away from the other two superpowers.\n\nLet us show America and Japan that Germany is able to pull many strings inside Brazil."

SGR_RND_infiltrate_mitsubishi_desc:0 "Singvogel has been a success. Having established a foothold in Thailand, we can now launch a more ambitious project. The RND will begin a direct probe into Japan proper. We have no real knowledge of how strong their own intelligence agency is, so the risk is unknown. The rewards, however, can be very high, depending on what we can uncover."

Many people pass through there every day, but there's a particular group of people that stand out. Fielding an advertisement agency, we've picked up on the fact that their mannerisms and way of speaking seems... awfully Burgundian. The RND will investigate these men, and figure out if they truly are agents of Himmler."
SGR_RND_infiltrate_us_banking:0 "§MUnternehmen Nadelöhr§!"
SGR_RND_infiltrate_us_banking_desc:0 "It's been confirmed. The Black State of Europe has spread its nasty tendrils to the U.S.A. That advertisement agency in Madison Square Park was merely the beginning. Those Burgundian agents seemed to have gotten their funding somewhere from within the U.S. financial sector. To prevent them from doing anything further, the RND will immediately begin a deeper and more thorough investigation."

SGR_RND_aiding_vyatka_desc:0 "Reinhard Gehlen pulls strings in many places, but there is one place that has been left untouched, collecting dust - Russia - and there, he knows a certain man. Within the warlord states lives someone named Boris Smyslovsky; an old friend of Gehlen's, and an Untermensch to the Reich. It doesn't matter to him, however. He serves Vyatka, which is a regime that could be potentially friendly to us, so we will covertly send him aid in order to strengthen their chances of victory. As well as to help a time-tested ally of his."

SGR_RND_unternehmen_rotbart_russia:0 "§BUnternehmen Rotbart§! - §YRussia§!"

We know for a fact that Ordensstaat-Burgund has one of the most dangerous intelligence agencies - if not the most - in the world, but Gehlen wishes to prove otherwise. He knows that Himmler expects his agents to cross into the Black State, but Gehlen refuses to back down from the challenge.

While the movement itself is under equipped and weaker compared to the Paraguayan army, the Villasboa government is surrounded by American friendly nations, and we have reasons to believe that FULNA itself is a front for American interests. We will send equipment and agents to help Paraguay counter the insurgency and repel liberal propaganda."

SGR_RND_assist_paraguay_bush_war_fdg_desc:0 "The Paraguayan government is under attack by an armed movement called FULNA.

Of course, this is to our advantage, as we desire a weaker neighbor in Russia. Shipments of arms, munitions, and money will soon commence, though we expect some will not find their destination.

He poured some vodka into his glass. "I want to be alone now. You two," he pointed to the guards at the door, "get out." They all left in a hurry for fear of irritating their commander.\n\nThe Grand Marshal of the ROA felt tired. That was enough for a day's work, he thought. Oktan had just secured his position as the most powerful leader in Russia, with a few handshakes and pleasantries. A few words about his past in Moskowien had been enough. Of course, the ROA still need to crush some dissidents and communists, but now they had the best equipment to do so.

The misinfo is already so widely spread one of our diplomats recently punched his counterpart right in the face, calling him a "puppet of Washington!"\n\nMore suspicious members of our government allege the leak of documents could be a foreign plant, pointing to several grammatical errors and an outdated orthography not seen in several decades, but that sort of spelling is sadly common in Russia after many years of lacking education.

GER_Espionage.9.desc:0 "One of the great victories of the past decades was not only the destruction of the cancerous heart of Bolshevism in the form of the Soviet Union, but also the annihilation of the unified state concept in Russia and its colonies. Never again would the Slav dare build a state to rival the might of the Reich, and in the absence of the strict authoritarianism of its successive governments, the illiterate Russian peasant would revert to his base instincts of violence and raiding for any meaningful future. Or at least, so we thought, joining the First Führer in his dismissal of the Russians. Then came the West Russian War, and while officially we swatted the Bolshevik hordes aside with ease, in reality the state was severely weakened by the conflict and the integrity of our eastern lands was considerably compromised even up to this day.\n\nNow the spectre of that conflict rears its ugly head again. While we long expected there to be some sort of unification attempt between the unorganized warlords of European Russia and Western Siberia following the suspension of our punitive air raids during the Bürgerkrieg, an unexpected development was the reformation of the Siberian states thought collapsed in the fifties, thanks to a combination of foreign interference and refurbished Soviet industry.\n\nNow, Russia has been rapidly coalescing into two powerblocs faster than what any analyst thought possible, and what's worse, they appear to be engaging in diplomacy with each other. A reunified Russia cannot be allowed to happen; while we would of course win any potential conflict, the cost in lives, money, and damage to our Reichskommissariats could easily be prohibitive!

We have also noted that Yelena Karbysheva, daughter of the League's former leader, is also a member of this organization, and we could use her as a propaganda tool.\n\nBatov himself was displeased to work with us. While the General did not hide his distaste for the Reich, his hatred for the Black League was more important at the moment.

The intel they received was accurate, at least. Five rebels were guarding a warehouse full of guns, though the weapons themselves were complicating everything.\n\nBatov's dogs started shooting as soon as the League's troops busted through the doors. It did not last more than five minutes. Soon, every enemy was dead, and Viktor and his troops needed to clean the mess the rebels left. Their mission was to capture the warehouse, but they also should have apprehended at least one of the bandits. Perhaps one could have revealed who had supplied them with German-made weapons. Most likely, the rebels had smuggled the guns from the West. Some were as old as the West Russian War, it seemed.\n\nNevertheless, Lieutenant Viktor was unsure of how to write his report. A warehouse filled with German guns and Batov's thugs was sure to attract the attention of the Black League's high command. Perhaps even the Glavkoverkh would read his words. While his soldiers searched for evidence, all Viktor could do was stand in the corner, occasionally mumbling some commands..."

The Father's inner circle consists almost exclusively of priests and monks of the Orthodox persuasion, and most of the extremely limited state apparatus consists of communal coordination agencies staffed by former bolsheviks, and militia systems dominated by North Siberian natives with a deep distrust of even European Russians, and even more so non-Russian Europeans, who they seem to believe are some sort of devils. Nevertheless, there exists a few more regular divisions of Slavic troops alongside the native militias, and it is here we were able to find some purchase. An officer, upset at the lynching of his former superior, a man known as Rodzaevsky (see Appendix A: Reich Assets & Sympathizers In Harbin During The Second Weltkrieg), revealed that the overall commander of the regular divisions is a man named Pavel Sudoplatov, a former NKVD agent and independent power broker from The Father (see pg.9 for an abbreviated pre-war biography based on Moskowien records).\n\nTo bolster Sudoplatov's legitimacy as protector of the region vis a vis The Father, the Russia desk has suggested to use our contact's network of former Rodzaevsky followers to raid a series of villages near a garrison of regulars. We have hired a group of mercenaries formerly based out of the port of Magadan (see pg.11) to ensure the regulars win the skirmish, and if possible, ensure our contact does not survive it.

His smile faded as he caught a glimpse in the scope of a mustachioed fellow who was wearing the grey coat of Sudoplatov's men despite being with the raiders. Could it be the Alpha?

He may have emphasized how, while he was dazed and stunned by the crash, multiple RND men surrounded his vehicle.

I hope with all my heart that our brave police officers and detectives can bring this case to a satisfying conclusion and enact justice for my friend and colleague."\n\nKarl Hanke had been a mildly controversial figure in recent years, owing to his long-standing support for the SS. He faced criticism at times from fellow NSDAP members for his political views, but was fully exonerated of alleged ties to treasonous elements by the Führer himself shortly after the Bürgerkrieg. Hanke is survived by his wife, Baroness Freda von Fircks, and their daughter."

SUMMARY: Since the progressive collapse of the West Russian Revolutionary Front following the end of the West Russian War, the Communist state was relegated to the city of Arkhangelsk and surrounding regions, with military districts in Plesetsk and Ukhta. Following Tukhachevsky's assumption of control over the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he has seemingly dedicated his state to total militarization, dedicating the majority of the state apparatus to mobilization for conflict. As a result, the standard of living across the nation has hardly improved, and the Research and Development facilities dedicated to weapons of war (see Agent XXXXXXXX's "Report of Weapons Development in the West Russian Revolutionary Front" in App II) has only further raised cause for concern.\n\n2. Despite his seemingly total dedication to Communism, it would seem that Tukhachevsky's own method of governing has consisted of an unforgiving mentality towards all those who he regards as traitor, having personally executed several supposed "enemies of the state". A tense, stern, determined individual, Tukhachevsky's personality seems to be best reflected in his incredibly disciplined Army.\n\n3. Any agent interacting with Tukhachevsky is to refrain from placing the Field Marshal in any position which may seem diminutive, as such an action would quickly end any civil conversation. As the Front has had a long history of conflict with the Reich, and Tukhachevsky's state is one of rapid militarization, it seems as though the Front will stop at nothing to retake its lost land should it consolidate its hold over Russia.

SUMMARY: Recent first-hand experience with Russian leader Ivan Serov following his consolidation of the self-proclaimed Komi Republic has provided rare insights into his goals and personality. In many ways, Serov appears to be typical slavic Untermensch obsessed with the works of Karl Marx and other Judeo-Bolshevik figures. Unlike his rivals, however, Serov has attempted to apply National Socialist principles to communist thought. Despite the incoherence of this ideology (see Agent XXXX's "Notes on 'Manifesto on Ordosocialism'" in App I), these beliefs appear genuine. Private meetings with Serov have revealed deep-seated distaste for so-called "hereditary reactionaries," a group which includes most Russian ethnic minorities. Even short discussions tend to reveal his chauvinism and antisemetic attitudes.\n\n2. Despite the contradictory nature of his movement, Reich officials are highly discouraged from dismissing Serov or his followers. Serov previously served as the head of the communist security apparatus and developed a reputation for brutality among its ranks. Though personally charming, good mannered, and a moderate drinker, he has demonstrated a frightening capacity for violence. His administration has overseen a campaign of brutal subjugation over his fellow Slavs. Unconfirmed reports suggest Serov personally involves himself in these operations and has, on at least one occasion, beaten a prisoner to death. Quality of life across his territory remains low and residents are kept in line through fear of punishment (See: Agent XXXX's "Summary of Public Execution Methods" in App II).\n\n3. Any agent or official interacting with Serov should proceed with extreme caution. He exhibits an unusual cunning and awareness of foreign events-expressing surprisingly sophisticated opinions of both German and American politics. Given his ambition, it is highly likely he will seek to exploit the difficult security situation in the Reich and its colonies for his own benefit. If allowed to consolidate a hold over Russia, he will almost certainly seek confrontation both directly and by supporting anti-German movements internationally. END SUMMARY."

SUMMARY: XXXXXX passed us a document describing a recent propaganda event hosted by Lev Gumilyov of the so-called Komi Republic. Though previously dismissed as a marginal figure known only in degenerate art circles (see case files on ANNA AKHMATOVA), recent events have revealed Gumilyov to be a significant figure in his own right. As the RND reassesses the security threats present in Russia, this document provides insights into the motives and ideology of a potential long-term adversary.\n\n2. The event, titled "The Superethnos, Ethnogenesis, and Eurasia: An Exploration of Recent Geophysical and Historical Discoveries and Their Relation to the State" appears to have been a lecture at the Passionariyy Organization headquarters. Over the course of three hours, Gumilyov discussed his theory that human beings organize themselves into "spiritual-linguistic groups" (the "ethnos"), which operate as organisms and can organize themselves into larger groups (the "super-ethnos"). These groups possess "passionarity," people filled with vital energy and "power characteristics" that allow the super-ethnos to achieve great accomplishments. They are opposed by "sub-passionaries"-people with low energy who seek to satisfy only their basic needs. When the number of sub-passionaries grows too large, the might of the ethnos begins to decline.\n\n3. Understanding these degenerate, pseudoscientific theories are essential to grasping the threat this warlord presents. Gumilyov believes that the two most powerful super-ethnos are the "Atlanticist," non-Romance Anglophones, and the "Eurasianist," Russians and local ethnic minority groups. Gumilyov believes it is the destiny of the Eurasionists to form a civilizational empire that will surpass the "Romano-Germanic" Reich and achieve multi-continental supremacy. In his view, conflict between his rising empire and the falling Romano-Germanics is likely.\n\n4. Post-lecture, Gumilyov distributed propaganda encouraging attendees to join Komi's military apparatus. The number of attendees and the growing size of Komi's military suggests that many of Gumilyov's soldiers are slavishly devoted to his baseless ideology. Caution in future engagements is advised.
