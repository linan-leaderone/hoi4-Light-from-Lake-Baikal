 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_ROKOSSOVSKY_DESC: "Unlike many other men, Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky stayed faithful to the Soviet Motherland no matter what, even to this very day. Being born in the days of the Tsar to a family of Polish gentry, he had to suffer a very poor life as a child. It was only logical that he turned to the Bolshevik Party, and soon became one of the most distinguished and well-known commanders of the Soviet Union, a distinguished gentleman and officer whose military record was nothing short of brilliant. After two decades of serving in the Red Army, the house of cards would crumble, the USSR would collapse, and Rokossovsky would have to adapt to a completely new environment. As his 3rd Army fled from the invading Germans and reached the Urals, he was welcomed with open arms by Lazar Kaganovich, and so he joined the West Siberian People's Republic.\n\nHowever, the alliance of Kaganovich and his generals, full of distrust and bitter competition, was a fragile one, and would inevitably fall apart. Western Siberia would battle for its survival, against all odds, as the Germans continued their relentless bombing raids and rifts between its top leaders and generals only grew and grew, to a point when they could not be mended. Seeing the People's Republic was a sinking ship as Karbyshev seized the city of Omsk and Kaganovich showing its disdain by his inaction, Rokossovsky would quickly gather his 3rd Army in the city of Sverdlovsk to form a provisional military government led by himself and backed by a formidable force. While disillusioned with his former party superiors in Tyumen, Rokossovsky has not abandoned his cause of the Soviet Union reunification, even if it will be driven by its loyal and impartial military, born and taught in the best traditions of the Russian and Soviet art of war and serving the working people above the bureaucrats. The harsh service and old age took a considerable toll on Marshal Rokossovsky's health, but his resolve remains persistent in the desperate times. Even if he won't live to see the Red Army marching in the Red Square once again, he can rely on the old friends and comrades to continue his mission with dignity."

 POLITICS_PAVEL_BATOV_DESC: "The soldiers under the command of Pavel Ivanovich Batov often affectionately call him "our Suvorov", both for his appearance and his manners, referring to the legendary Russian general who was known for his military genius, his humble nature, and his fondness for the ordinary Russian soldiers. It is unlikely that the general himself acknowledges or evokes the comparison, but one could not be blamed for seeing such parallels between the leader of the Ural military government and the famed Russian hero of the past.\n\nIn the darkest days of the Nazi push into Russia, Batov became acquainted with Konstantin Rokossovsky, with whom he formed a professional and personal bond that lasted until the latter's death. The camaraderie of the two generals became a subject of thrilling legends and tales narrated across the entirety of Siberia, intertwining truth and fiction. The events they went through together, the wars where they fought back to back, as one - all of it became ingrained in modern Russian cultural memory.\n\nAt the funeral of his old friend, Batov vowed to carry the banner of the departed general's cause and preserve the legacy of the Lion of Siberia. Reorganizing the forces of the Ural Military District under his command and establishing his emergency power within the boundaries of war-ridden Russia, Batov seeks to rethink the role of the Red Army in society - to serve not merely as a protector of the Russian people, but their guide in times of anarchy and devastation."

 POLITICS_PAVEL_BATOV_70S_DESC: "Russia's turbulent history has, by nature, given rise to a number of extraordinary military men, who used their considerable talents to snatch victory from the jaws of certain destruction. Now, arguably the darkest period of Russia's existence has come to a close, and history has found yet another such figure to give its eternal gratitude to: Pavel Ivanovich Batov.\n\nGrand Marshal Batov is a man who defied the circumstances he and his comrades found themselves trapped in. When his enemies were reckless and aggressive, Batov had a knack for putting his thoughts before his actions. While some warlords considered no price to be high enough if the reunification of Russia was concerned, Batov took great care to not put his men in unnecessary danger. His refusal to stoop to the level of his foes did not impede his progress, and now the so-called "Modern Suvorov" finds himself at the helm of a renewed Russian state.\n\nBatov, however, takes little comfort now that the guns have fallen silent. His greatest test yet, the reclamation of Russia's heartland from the Nazi scourge, lies ahead, and the Grand Marshal lies awake at night thinking of the brutality such a titanic conflict is likely to bring about. Worse still, Batov holds lingering doubts that his subordinates share the same vision for Russia as he does.\n\nFor now, however, Pavel Batov will continue on as he always has: with an unwavering loyalty to Russia and her people."

 POLITICS_BORIS_YELTSIN_DESC: "Sometimes, there are good uses for a tiger. An apex predator, able to pursue its prey with a perseverance only rivaled by its bloodlust. The fascists unleashed theirs in the Urals, accidentally setting loose a depraved man who left nothing but violence in his wake. Sverdlovsk's tiger however, hails from a different breed, and unlike the Germans, his leash shall be short and stiff.\n\nBoris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is an ideological man in a notoriously nonideological state. Advocating an aggressive economic policy of privatization, the rapid expansion of democracy, and a swift reunion of Russia. It is his zeal and dedication that led him from relative obscurity to leadership of the democratic faction in Sverdlovsk.\n\nHowever, while he may be eager to implement his new vision, and useful in our quest to end this Russian anarchy, like any tiger, he must be kept in check. Pavel Batov remains keenly aware of the eagerness of Yeltsin's policy, as well as the less savory methods he uses to achieve it. Thus, he has vowed to ensure the military holds equal sway in the new republic.\n\nYeltsin must walk a tightrope, balancing the conservative militarists against his own aggressively republican tendencies. The war for Russia is not yet won, and it remains to be seen if such a task is feasible after all. Yet were he to succeed, Russia will surely be stronger for it. Perhaps no less cruel in its policy, but a free, aggressively capitalist republic nonetheless."

 POLITICS_ANTON_ANTONOV_OVSEYENKO_DESC: "His relation to his father, a prominent Bolshevik military commander, was not enough to stop Anton Vladimirovich Antonov-Ovseyenko from being sent to the infamous gulags of Siberia. For years, he had a first-hand experience of the USSR's terror, at least until the camps were liberated by bandits and thieves.\n\nDespite all that he went through, he kept pushing, and found the perfect opportunity to flee with fellow dissidents and former prisoners when the arms dealers of Zlatoust achieved their victory.\n\nWith few other available leaders to maintain order in Khanty-Mansi, Antonov and his caravan were selected to control the freezing plains in the name of the Ural Republic. His friendships slowly forged over the years have paid off, as a united front of political dissidents, priests like his close associate Sergey Izvekov, or even simple bandits have managed to keep the banks of Irtysh in order and, above all, make sure its inhabitants don't have to go through what Anton did."

 POLITICS_ANTON_ANTONOV_OVSEYENKO_ONEGA_DESC: "His relation to his father, a prominent Bolshevik military commander, was not enough to stop Anton Vladimirovich Antonov-Ovseyenko from being sent to the infamous gulags of Siberia. For years, he had a first-hand experience of the USSR's terror, at least until the camps were liberated by bandits and thieves.\n\nDespite all that he went through, he kept pushing, and found the perfect opportunity to flee with fellow dissidents and former prisoners when the anti-communists of Onega achieved their victory.\n\nWith few other available leaders to maintain order in Khanty-Mansi, Antonov and his caravan were selected to control the freezing plains in the name of the North Russian Republic. His friendships slowly forged over the years have paid off, as a united front of political dissidents, priests like his close associate Sergey Izvekov, or even simple bandits have managed to keep the banks of Irtysh in order and, above all, make sure its inhabitants don't have to go through what Anton did."

Born in 1929 in Kiev to Jewish parents, he had high hopes for himself in pursuing an academic career. A studious young man, he worked very hard from an early age to be able to learn with the best minds of his generation and do great things. The collapse of the union, however, shattered these dreams for what young Primakov thought would be forever. Spending the remainder of his teenage and early adult years in West Siberia, he climbed the social ladder and got into politics fairly quickly. He did many things in this transitional period he is not proud of, and that would draw scrutiny from the people and any political rivals he acquires. Regardless, after the collapse of the WSPR, Primakov opted to assist Boris Yeltsin in rebuilding democracy in the wartorn wastes of Russia.

 GENERAL_YAKOV_KREIZER_DESC: "Of Jewish origins, Yakov Kreizer served as a general during the Great Patriotic War and, most notably, during Operation: Suvorov. Noted for an expertise in defensive warfare, his actions and the tenacity of his troops in holding their ground were instrumental in the survival of retreating Red Army units. When the Third Army split off from Kaganovich's republic, Kreizer joined, like many, Rokossovsky's side."

 SVR_notso_redarmy: "Not So Red Army"
 SVR_notso_redarmy_desc: "In spite of being led by Marshal Rokossovsky, our Red Army begins to show signs of faltering in purpose; rumors of Black League infiltration and Revisionist sympathies reach the Marshal's ears more and more; the last tenets of Communism having been cast aside in favor of regular military leadership. The task of figuring out a unifying direction will probably fall on the Marshal's successor however; the old lion cannot fight death off forever."
 SVR_renewed_red_army: "Renewed Red Army"

 SVR_the_marshal: "The Marshal"
 SVR_the_marshal_desc: "Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky represents a beacon of hope for the people of West Siberia; a unifying figure who will fight tooth and nail to protect the people of Russia. His almost heroic presence inspires trust in our citizens, and confidence in our troops. So long as the marshal is able to guide us, we have nothing to fear."
 SVR_fortified_homes: "Fortified Homes"
 SVR_fortified_homes_desc: "Various domestic buildings in our major cities have been reinforced in an ad-hoc effort to provide a layer of protection against the Luftwaffe's bombings. While it's not a perfect measure by any means, it will at least be enough to keep our people safe while we devise a more permanent solution."
 SVR_fortified_homes_2: "Fortified Homes"
 SVR_fortified_homes_2_desc: "We can fortify the homes of our people as much as we like, but the reality is that the bombs of the Luftwaffe are too powerful to be reliably stopped with our current means. Our engineers have created a large system of bomb shelters that snake under our cities, deep enough to be completely safe from any kind of aerial attack."
 SVR_fortified_homes_3: "Fortified Homes"
 SVR_fortified_homes_3_desc: "Thanks to the efforts of our engineers, the people of the District can finally enjoy a sense of security from the threat of German bombing raids. Vast numbers of homes and apartments have been fortified, and bomb shelters have been built just in case these new improvements were not enough."
 SVR_fortified_factories: "Fortified Factories"
 SVR_fortified_factories_desc: "While we still cannot resume full-scale production, some of our less vulnerable factories have been fortified against German bombing runs. With these industries now mostly secure, we can slowly begin to transition back towards a state of normalcy."
 SVR_fortified_factories_2: "Fortified Factories"
 SVR_fortified_factories_2_desc: "On top of fortifications and other countermeasures against potential bombing raids, we have instituted a series of changes to the working environments themselves. Our workers will now work shifts that are less likely to be interrupted by the Germans, and skilled overseers have been dispatched to ensure production proceeds smoothly."
 SVR_new_russian_army: "The New Russian Army"
 SVR_new_russian_army_desc: "From the seeds laid by Marshal Rokossovsky and his veteran Third Army, an entirely new force is coming into being. Helmed by some of the most experienced officers in the world, and manned by some of the bravest men in all of Siberia, the new Russian Army is likely to become one of the world's finest, given enough time."
 SVR_new_russian_army_2: "The New Russian Army"
 SVR_new_russian_army_2_desc: "The newly reborn Russian Army is showing further signs of improvement. Thanks to our new training regimen emphasizing teamwork and tactical flexibility, the troops now work together like clockwork on the battlefield, enhancing their overall effectiveness."

 SVR_new_russian_army_3_desc: "With the expertise of our unmatched officer corps, the Third Army has been reforged into something entirely new.

The army marches confident in its superiority, knowing that any who stand against it will be shattered before its might."
 SVR_specialized_defense: "Specialized Defense"
 SVR_specialized_defense_desc: "Comrade General Kreizer is a master in the art of defensive stratagems, and he has put forth a program to enhance the defensive capabilities of our troops. Our units will make use of highly mobile formations which can respond to enemy incursions at a moment's notice, and overwhelm them with sudden and ruthless counterattacks."
 SVR_specialized_defense_2: "Specialized Defense"
 SVR_specialized_defense_2_desc: "As part of Comrade Kreizer's program to improve the army's defensive capabilities, the Red Army's medical corps have been expanded. They will be better able to establish field hospitals behind the lines, and new tactics have been developed to get our wounded comrades out of harm's way."
 SVR_specialized_defense_3: "The People's Shield"
 SVR_specialized_defense_3_desc: "It's a tragic fact that civilians are bound to get hurt in war. Despite that, it is still a fact. The Red Army has and always will be the protector of the people, however. Thus, one of their principal duties in any of the coming wars will be to protect the citizenry of Russia. Already, fortifications have been erected and staffed in civilian areas, ready for defense when the time comes. We pray they will never see use."
 SVR_efficient_resource_extraction: "Efficient Resource Extraction"

 SVR_savant_high_command_idea_desc: "Rokossovsky. Batov. Kreizer. Bagramyan. These are but a few of the prestigious names that grace the Red Army's High Command with their presence. Our troops are commanded by some of the most skilled and experienced commanders in the entire world, and utilizing their vast expertise is likely to pay dividends in the conflicts to come."

 SVR_quality_small_arms_2: "Quality Small Arms"
 SVR_quality_small_arms_2_desc: "With new weapon designs flowing in from Zlatoust and our very own design bureau, our understanding of and skill with weapons production has improved greatly since our army first formed. Our troops, once armed with only the weapons we could scavenge from the corpse of the old Russia, now carry into battle the finest of small arms. With these guns, our troops feel ready to take on the world - in due time, they will."
 SVR_simple_small_arms: "Simplified Small Arms"
 SVR_simple_small_arms_desc: "Knowledge, while its own reward, provides many boons to those who wield it effectively. The scientists at the Sverdlovsk Design Bureau surely know how to wield it well; they continue to churn out new, modern designs whilst simplifying designs to allow for mass production using our available industry. With these designs, a modern rifle may soon be laid in the hands of every soldier."

 SVR_airland_battles: "Air-Land Battle"
 SVR_airland_battles_desc: "Air-Land Battle is the military principle that places close emphasis on the coordination between the land and air forces.

 SVR_black_league_influence_tier_1: "Low Black League Influence"
 SVR_black_league_influence_tier_1_desc: "Through careful inspection and constant vigilance, the influence of the Black League within the District has been largely curtailed. Though some minor infiltrators have been uncovered, they are of limited influence, and in no way threaten any of the integrated governmental or military organs relied upon for continuity."

 SVR_black_league_influence_tier_2: "Medium Black League Influence"
 SVR_black_league_influence_tier_2_desc: "The influence of the Black League is growing. More infiltrators are successfully crossing the border and gaining access to secure areas, affecting government and military operations. Though not currently critical, it could easily become so, and as such vigorous action should be taken."

 SVR_black_league_influence_tier_3: "High Black League Influence"
 SVR_black_league_influence_tier_3_desc: "The degree of Black League influence over the District's administration has increased yet further, with several infiltrators discovered in highly secured areas and numerous acts of sabotage reported.

 SVR_black_league_influence_tier_4: "Very High Black League Influence"
 SVR_black_league_influence_tier_4_desc: "The situation is dire. Black League infiltrators have managed to penetrate nearly every level of the District's command structure, crippling any possibility of long-term continuity or defense against their military operations. The District is nearly out of time - it must act! Now!"

 SVR_revisionist_influence_tier_1: "Low Revisionist Influence"
 SVR_revisionist_influence_tier_1_desc: "Owing to constant and careful review of political orientation among the officer corps, the majority of those holding revisionist influences have been rooted out, and those that remain hidden possess little authority. The District is secure against this threat. For now."

 SVR_revisionist_influence_tier_2: "Medium Revisionist Influence"
 SVR_revisionist_influence_tier_2_desc: "A concerning degree of revisionist sympathy has been uncovered among a number of junior officers. Though not yet at a point where fundamental aspects of the District's administration would be at threat, it has led to the compromise of several low-level facilities and operations, and should therefore be presently addressed."

 SVR_revisionist_influence_tier_3: "High Revisionist Influence"
 SVR_revisionist_influence_tier_3_desc: "Alarming levels of revision sympathy have been uncovered in the District, including several senior officers. This has already directly resulted in the betrayal of important military secrets and preparations to our enemies, and cannot be allowed to continue. Concentrated effort must be applied to root out such sympathizers."

 SVR_revisionist_influence_tier_4: "Very High Revisionist Influence"
 SVR_revisionist_influence_tier_4_desc: "The situation is critical. The presence of revisionist sympathizers in the highest levels of our command structure has been confirmed, severely compromising both the District's stability and capacity for military operations.

 SVR_unhappy_army: "Unhappy Army"
 SVR_unhappy_army_desc: "Our decision to combat shortages among workers and civilians by reducing rations and resources from the army has harmed morale among the men. While we have assured them this is a temporary measure; we are still facing a minor rise in desertion within the military"
 SVR_demoralized_army: "Demoralized Army"
 SVR_demoralized_army_desc: "The Red Army has definitely seen better days. Desertion is becoming concerningly common, and morale has reached all-time lows.

In the meantime, we're likely to face many more desertions before this issue is rectified..."

 SVR_worker_concessions_desc: "We have decided to shift materials and funds from our military to provide essential goods for our civilians. While giving in to our workers' demands has appeased them, there is some grumbling within the armed forces."
 SVR_specialized_forces_idea: "Specialized Forces"
 SVR_specialized_forces_idea_desc: "To better increase the adaptability of our new army, a separate special forces branch has been formed. These troops will specialize in more advanced forms of warfare, from mountain combat to amphibious assaults. Their training is far more rigorous than the rank-and-file, but the result is a soldier that fears no terrain, no matter how treacherous it may be."
 SVR_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_idea: "Sverdlovsk Design Bureau"
 SVR_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_idea_desc: "To better prepare the Red Army for the perils of modern warfare, the Sverdlovsk Design Bureau has been established. This specialized R&D department will work around the clock to develop new weapons and equipment for our troops, and will hopefully allow us to stay ahead of our enemies in terms of military technology."
 SVR_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_idea_2: "Sverdlovsk Design Bureau"
 SVR_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_idea_2_desc: "With the new increase in funding, the Sverdlovsk Design Bureau is able to hire more scientists, procure more materials, and test more weapons.

 SVR_increased_reconstruction_efforts_idea: "Increased Reconstruction Efforts"
 SVR_increased_reconstruction_efforts_idea_desc: "The efforts to reunify Western Siberia took their toll on our infrastructure. The fighting has left cities facing power outages, roads completely out of service, and our ability to deploy military assets compromised. Needless to say, this situation cannot be permitted to continue. Funding has been increased and work crews dispatched to help repair the damages so that our nation may be bound together once more."

They served the Motherland with not only dignity, but valour during the Great Patriotic War, and have continued to do so since, arranging sorties against the Nazi bombers from their main base in Surgut.

 SVR_a_bastion_of_freedom: "A Bastion of Freedom"
 SVR_a_bastion_of_freedom_desc: "Russia is broken. It was shattered without mercy by Nazi firepower; even now, in the afterglow of their victory, Nazi planes scream and rattle overhead, sneering at us while they destroy our cities and murder our children.\n\nBut it was also torn apart from within by traitors - collaborators. Men without loyalty or principles, men who live only to sate their lust for power and blood. Our Motherland was destroyed, and from deep within those abyssal fractures evil and tyranny poured forth, sweeping away what little we had left.\n\nSverdlovsk stands as a bulwark against this black tide, a candle in the dark, the last bastion of freedom. We will fight with every drop of blood in our bodies to preserve our freedom."

 SVR_look_around_you: "Look Around You"
 SVR_look_around_you_desc: "Look around you, fellow Russians! Tell me, what do you see? Do you see the devastation? The sickness, the death, the anarchy? The chorus of death that rings from Arkhangelsk to Kamchatka? Do you hear the cracking of hooves on stone and the great horns lauding the horseman's approach? Do you see the madness just beyond our borders?\n\nWhat of the north, where the word of a petty criminal is law? What of Tyumen, whose people are slaves to terror, and Omsk, whose leadership would have millions slaughtered in the blink of an eye in the name of "revenge"? If you do, my fellow Russians, then you see why we must preserve our freedom."

 SVR_not_all_hope_is_lost: "Not All Hope Is Lost"
 SVR_not_all_hope_is_lost_desc: "Throughout Russia, the grief the Germans caused cannot be more apparent. The former Union, shattered into pieces, cannot protect its people. With the bombs falling from the sky, all that reside below know only panic and fear. Dreams of liberty, freedom, and plenty can do naught but die, torn by shrapnel and force. All of the Motherland, from the West to the East, face a plague even more sweeping than any anger or disease: hopelessness: that life will go on as it had before, under terror and violence.\n\nIn the lands of West Siberia, however, a lone beacon of hope remains, smothered in the cold and left to die in the fall of the Union, yet refusing to die. To all who would dare rise to challenge fate, the doors to the Marshal's army remains open. To those who hope, to those who refuse to surrender the innocent wish for a better tomorrow, the Military District shall welcome as comrades-in-arms, in its march to an ideal future."

 SVR_defend_your_mother: "Defend Your Mother"
 SVR_defend_your_mother_desc: "The purpose of the Military District has been clear from the very beginning: protection, not expansion. Under Marshal Rokossovsky, it has directed and dedicated itself to the security of Russians living under its rule. In a Russia torn by genocidal violence and ideological extremism, mere ideals of milquetoast reform cannot sustain the livelihoods of millions; a firm but gentle hand must guide their way to the future, shielding them from danger, within and without.\n\nAll who join the District shall receive a rifle, rations, and pay. These are the three means that enable a man to defend his family. Father, mother, son, and daughter, whether brother, sibling, sister or stranger, one more pair of hands shall ensure that no more lives will be lost. There are dangers abound, but with the people marching forward hand-in-hand with the District, they shall know no fear."

 SVR_trust_the_marshal: "Trust in the Marshal"
 SVR_trust_the_marshal_desc: "The great Marshal Rokossovsky, formerly of the Union, now controls what little remains of the Military District. To the people of Sverdlovsk, he represents a final, desperate hope of stability and liberty; the burden imposes such strain on his physique, as he takes on the responsibility for millions. His soldiers, staff members, and people beg him to reconsider his task, to delegate his duty and rest. He refuses, a lone man against the advancing tide of tyranny and authoritarian rule.\n\nAs such, there is no other course of action than to trust the Marshal to do his obligation. From all levels of society of the Military District, all shall take the Marshal at his word: that he is experienced, and thus knows best. From the beggars and the homeless of the cities and villages to the highest echelons of command in their spartan quarters, all will look to the Marshal as a beacon of life, liberty, and happiness, amid a Russia torn by war and chaos."

 SVR_fortifying_homes: "Fortifying Homes"
 SVR_fortifying_homes_desc: "They return every month. Sometimes in broad daylight, sometimes at night, but they always come, and they will always come back, no matter how many they kill, no matter how much destruction they wreak from thousands of feet in the air.\n\nThe Luftwaffe is a persistent danger to not only our people but our administration, and we should spare no expense in mitigating the damage the bombings cause. If we cannot repel them outright, then we shall send military units out to fortify homes and - hopefully - save lives in the next raid."

 SVR_bomb_shelters: "Bomb Shelters"
 SVR_bomb_shelters_desc: "It is no secret that the city of Sverdlovsk is the Luftwaffe's main target - and that is exactly why we must insulate it from as much damage as possible. Sandbags, camouflage, and the occasional prayer aren't enough.\n\nUnderground bomb shelters are the best way to protect the citizens of Sverdlovsk. While these shelters won't save the city's infrastructure - and the bombings severely hinder our abilities to provide for our citizens - we can rebuild factories and repair roads. Casualties are not something we can afford."

 SVR_deter_the_tyrant: "Deter the Tyrant"
 SVR_deter_the_tyrant_desc: "To our south, Lazar Kaganovich and his clique of tyrants cling to the mantle of the West Siberian People's Republic with dogged zeal. His totalitarian government is antithetical to our ideals of freedom and liberty.\n\nHe watches us, waiting for the slightest lapse in preparedness to strike and lay waste to everything we have built. For now, he cannot - to launch a major offensive with the threat of Luftwaffe air raids would be suicidal. But the bombings will not stop him forever. We must fortify our border to deter such an attack until the time comes that we are ready to put his tyranny to an end."

 SVR_cast_them_down: "Cast Them Down"
 SVR_cast_them_down_desc: "The bombs fall - such is a simple fact in Russia. Further east, perhaps, may Russians find, if not solace and calm, a semblance of silence. However, for many in Sverdlovsk, from the army to the civilians, the option of retreating beyond the mountains is nothing more than a pipe dream. The bomb shelters help in securing the safety of the people, giving them space away from the terror that the Germans unload on Russian soil every day. However, maybe even that would not be enough.\n\nPerhaps it is time to explore other avenues of action. A good offense, a Chinese general once said a long time ago, is the best defense. The engineer corps will work with the labor battalions of the District to construct anti-air emplacements throughout the District. No longer shall they rain suffering without impunity, while the army watches without a response. They shall find their bombs matched with flak rounds, without mercy. Time enough have we spent on cowering; it is time to cast them down."

 SVR_a_semblance_of_safety: "A Semblance of Safety"
 SVR_a_semblance_of_safety_desc: "The bombs still fall over Russia. Such is the fact of life in the District. From the East, the tyrant Kaganovich still eyes us, but the forts deter his raiders and drive them away. The Germans still prowl the sky, but now their hold does not go unchallenged. Men and women manning the anti-air emplacements present a credible challenge against the bombers, who now cannot act with impunity against the Sverdlovsk's civilian and military population.\n\nThe whole District rejoices. Its people, from the Marshal to the lowest worker, have stumbled upon safety - or a semblance of it. Some unfortunate bombs still find their targets, and Kaganovich's wolves raid us for resources and loot. However, the fact remains: the people are more secure than ever, with the Army doing its best to protect them from harm. The Marshal expects his people to put this space of relief to good use."

 SVR_fortify_factories: "Fortify Factories"
 SVR_fortify_factories_desc: "The basic fact of the District's existence is clear to all: it is surrounded from all sides by organizations and factions that seek to dominate its territory and people for sinister intentions. As such, it is imperative to keep the factories running, lest they overrun the army and achieve their aims. However, with the current weather of German bombs and shrapnel falling out of the sky, it has proven to be quite challenging to accomplish this feat. With decreasing output and industrial efficiency, the factories would not be able to get the equipment to the soldiers in time, dooming the District in the process.\n\nThe Marshal and his staff have come up with, perhaps not the most original of ideas, but a tried and true one. Labor battalions will work together with the engineer corps to reinforce the factories by any means necessary. Camouflage them, hide them, fortify them, no method shall be beyond the reach of the District."

 SVR_extra_rations: "Extra Rations"
 SVR_extra_rations_desc: "The military arm of the District manages everything in Sverdlovsk, and the people, fully behind the ideals of the Marshal and the unit he commands, obey. Yet, the factories of Sverdlovsk lag on their quotas, delivering fewer arms than the District's needs demand. The workers cite issues with long hours, arduous work, and the terror of the Germans as they fly above, their workplaces prime targets for bombing. That they are loyal is not the question; that we need their service is the fact of the day. We can never have enough workers.\n\nThe District shall begin with their most apparent problem: pay. Factory work is a dangerous job in Russia, and not all who wake up in the morning and toil with the machinery are happy with that fact. The Marshal intends to lessen the burden these heroes carry, by issuing them extra rations proportional to the work they have done. Under the District, these men and women shall know neither hunger nor lack."

 SVR_night_shifts: "Night Shifts"
 SVR_night_shifts_desc: "For many workers, the notion of going to work at a factory in Sverdlovsk terrifies them. The shifts mostly take their places during the day, where the factory is visible from the air, making them prime targets for German bombing. The sight of a plane from faraway is enough to get a whole factory floor on their knees. An explosion will send them scurrying away, too scared to work for another day. Those who sign up for these jobs are heroes, but we fear for them as they do for their lives: there are skilled workers and technicians that the Front cannot afford to lose.\n\nThe civilian administration has advised the Marshal and his staff to move these shifts to nighttime. Rokossovsky shall lend an ear to this suggestion. Workers shall move and work in the night, to prevent loss to random German bombs tearing through the sky. The Germans may have thought us dead and cornered, but we shall find ways to overcome them."

 SVR_a_decent_work_environment: "A Decent Work Environment"
 SVR_a_decent_work_environment_desc: "The issue of pay is settled. No workers who toil day and night for the District shall find themselves go unrewarded. Still, an issue endures. The long hours remain, and the arduous work does not help matters. Not to say that the workers are ungrateful, however. From the benevolent palms of the Marshal, they have gained a crucial concession for their livelihoods, and their loyalty is forever. Recruitment and volunteer numbers are increasing to record levels, and productivity has never been higher.\n\nThe Marshal intends to extinguish any more complaints they might have. The long hours will go, replaced by a system of shifts that adhere to patterns of activity of the Luftwaffe. Skilled overseers shall watch over the workers, preventing the work from becoming unbearable and exhausting as they rearrange the tempo of craft. With no issues remaining, the civilians will march forever hand-in-hand with the District, to triumph against the Black League and the tyrant Lazar."

 SVR_making_the_best_of_things: "Making the Best of Things"
 SVR_making_the_best_of_things_desc: "Life in Russia is not good. German bombing is a fact of life, and violence pervades wherever a local warlord is unable to exercise its power. In the District, however, under the leadership of the venerable Marshal Rokossovsky, the people of Sverdlovsk enjoy the highest standards of living on this side of Russia. The military arm of the District only exists for the protection of all who live in it, and though life is hard, its people do not go hungry, nor do their cries pass unheard.\n\nThe Marshal shall give the masses of the District a lesson from his own life: on how to make the best of things. Here and elsewhere, life is not by any means prosperous, nor comfortable, but the Marshal has never given up hope. Through it all, he guides the people with a clear conscience and warm heart, providing them with the means to survive and live. They will take after his example, and continue marching on to the future, no matter what dark fates may bring to their feet, all for a small spark of light at the end."

 SVR_sanctioned_scavengers: "Sanctioned Scavengers"
 SVR_sanctioned_scavengers_desc: "Long ago, before the foundation of the Military District, Sverdlovsk was part of the West Siberian People's Republic, with the Marshal as its unwilling head of armed forces. A semblance of stability settled over the region, as the WSPR sought to undo the damage caused by the fall of the Union after the Great Patriotic War.\n\nThen, the West Russian War came. In support of its comrades to the West, the People's Republic dispatched as much help as it can, whether in the form of food, weapons, or clothing. The defeat of the West Russian Revolutionary Front and infighting within its ranks rendered all aid sent moot. Before the terror bombings commenced, the Republic moved the surplus throughout Siberia, with the majority of it remaining in Sverdlovsk, untouched.\n\nThe District shall now rescind the restriction on civilian scavenging. These stockpiles may hold valuable resources still: a remnant of the past still giving life to those living in the present."

 SVR_a_silent_morning: "A Silent Morning"
 SVR_a_silent_morning_desc: "It all stopped one day. The sirens remained calm, its lips silenced by the lack of incoming danger. Many thought that it was a fluke, that the Germans would soon return and dominate the skies, and the bombs shall fall again upon Russia without care, thought, nor mercy. Yet, they never return. The clouds are quiet, with no planes in sight. The rumors were right; the Germans are gone. Under pressure from their internal conflicts, the AA emplacements, and the Free Aviators, they have withdrawn.\n\nThe Marshal, along with the rest of the District, breathes a sigh of relief. More dangers remain in the future, however. The shadow merchants of Zlatoust and their indecipherable intent, the enigmatic and mysterious Black League, and the remnants of the West Siberian People's Republic under Lazar Kaganovich will soon compete with Sverdlovsk to be the premier power of the region. Time is of the essence; conflict nears by every second."

 SVR_our_work_begins: "Our Work Begins"
 SVR_our_work_begins_desc: "For better or for worse the bombers have disappeared, and the silence is more deafening than any explosion could ever be. Already our foes are working to fill that silence with the sounds of labour and warfare, and we must not let this opportunity to rebuild and expand go to waste. Sverdlovsk can no longer afford to keep its head down, to do damage control.\n\nInstead, it must be reorganized into a state ready for not only the reunification of the lands of the former West Siberian People's Republic, but Russia as a whole! We must empty the sandbags, retire the searchlights, and send the anti-aircraft gunners back to the factories. The road ahead is long, and there is much work to be done."

 SVR_military_rail_expansion: "Military Rail Expansion"
 SVR_military_rail_expansion_desc: "So long as the peaks and pillboxes of Zlatoust loom over our western flank, we lack an effective staging point from which to push north. We must expand our rail network to allow for an effective northern offensive without the railways through Dragunov's territory.\n\nAn eastern supply hub shall also enable offensive southern actions before the capture of Tyumen's railways."

 SVR_motorization_drive: "Motorization Drive"
 SVR_motorization_drive_desc: "As the 3rd Army victoriously strides beyond our defensive lines, we shall begin to outpace and overstretch our supply lines.

 SVR_restore_industry: "Restore Industry"
 SVR_restore_industry_desc: "The shadow of the Luftwaffe has forced our past industrial efforts to focus around the protection and fortification of our existing industry to prevent destruction.\n\nUnder clear blue skies, we must redirect our efforts to the rapid expansion of the Sverdlovsk war machine to to equip and fuel our campaign against the tyrants of West Siberia."

 SVR_expand_the_logistics_corps: "Expand the Logistics Corps"
 SVR_expand_the_logistics_corps_desc: "As more men are armed, frontlines stretch to the horizons and our industrial output rockets upwards, the matter of organising what goes to whom, and how it shall get there is rapidly becoming more complicated.\n\nThe logistics corps must keep pace with the rising scale and intensity of the conflicts, or we shall collapse upon ourselves into a pitfall of our own inefficiencies."

 SVR_sverdlovsk_design_bureau: "The Sverdlovsk Design Bureau"
 SVR_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_desc: "Strengthening our technological ability will assist greatly in our efforts to renovate the army and build up our economic strength. Following the Second World War and the collapse of Russia in the subsequent Soviet-German War, Sverdlovsk has found itself in possession of several formerly Soviet scientists.\n\nMany of these scientists have come to us offering their services. Creating a new bureau to manage these scientists and build research facilities to house and employ them would be quite a boon for our research and development teams."

 SVR_specialized_weapons: "Specialized Arms"
 SVR_specialized_weapons_desc: "Over the course of military history, one principle that the world has seen validated time and time again is the notion that as technology progresses, so too does specialization in the military.\n\nIn the Middle Ages this meant the development of heavily armoured knights in battle. During the Napoleonic Wars this was the revolutionary use of artillery by Napoleon. Today, It is the use of anti-tank weaponry, anti-air weapons, compact tank weaponry, and so on.\n\nIf the District's army is to remain a viable fighting force, capable of possibly one day taking on the German army, it is essential that we stay current with the new trends of warfare."

 SVR_simplified_designs: "Simplified Designs"
 SVR_simplified_designs_desc: "The city of Sverdlovsk boasts a tremendous population compared to its neighbours and enemies.

Rokossovsky himself, Pavel Batov, Yakov Kreizer, and Ivan Bagramyan are but a few of the generals under our command. Each one brings their own skills and specialties to the table, but together, they form the backbone of not only the 3rd Army, but Sverdlovsk itself.\n\nWe can use their extensive knowledge of the battlefield to implement wide-reaching reforms in our military - everything from how best to wield a bayonet to drawing up plans for front-wide offensive operations."

While many recruits we previously would have accepted will be turned away, what's left will be the cream of the crop."

Even with the 3rd Army stretched thin as it is, vast stretches of land in our periphery have become lawless wastes - power vacuums, waiting for the next Yazov or Kaganovich to fill it.\n\nWe must assert our administration's rule in these areas before we lose control of them."

The road ahead is long. It shall be littered with the blood of tyrants and the brave soldiers who killed them alike.

If we want a better deal than the arrangements he has with nearly everyone - our immediate threats included - we must court his favour.\n\nWe can't offer him money - he makes enough of that already - nor can we appeal to his sense of duty to the motherland because, well, the only thing he cares about is the bottom line. What we can offer him is safety. There are millions of men and women in Russia who would kill to have what he has, and some of them have the firepower to do it. If we remind him of this fact, and promise him protection courtesy of the 3rd Army, he should be willing to open his armory to us. It's not extortion; it's just aggressive selling!"

 #SVR_no_compromise: "No Compromise"

Becoming their ally, or even integrating their military forces into our own could provide us with numerous benefits, among which would include the prestige of being the nation that received the endorsement of the Free Aviators.\n\nMaintaining good relations with the Free Aviators must then be a top priority for Sverdlovsk in its foreign relations goals. To that end, opening up diplomatic relations and sending an offer of industrial assistance could help to begin bringing our nation closer to theirs."

 #SVR_a_road_to_surgut: "A Road to Surgut"
 #SVR_a_road_to_surgut_desc: "The goal of integrating the Free Aviators into Sverdlovsk will require more than kind words and minor industrial assistance. Years of aerial combat with Germany over and around Free Aviator territory has inflicted major damage on the infrastructure that once connected Surgut to the rest of Russia.\n\nMany of the roads and rail lines affected ran through Sverdlovsk just as well as Surgut. Rebuilding these connections would benefit us and could help to bring us into good favor with the Aviators."

 #SVR_an_expanded_deal: "An Expanded Deal"
 #SVR_an_expanded_deal_desc: "While the Free Aviators have been entirely successful in their effort to build a decent air force, their focus on the military has put a large strain on Surgut's economy. Many basic necessities like coal, bread, and warm clothing can be difficult to come by. Medical supplies like gauze are almost nonexistent in the country.\n\nSverdlovsk by comparison is in a much more stable position, and can afford to send surplus supplies to our neighbor in the north. Doing so would go a long way towards winning the hearts of the people in Surgut."

 #SVR_an_offer_for_integration_desc: "Over the past few months, the economic and political ties that have connected us to Surgut have become a binding force. The District's public perception stands at an all time high on account of generous aid and the tireless work of our envoys in the region.\n\nWorkers of Sverdlovsk sent up to the oil fields in Surgut have been welcomed and accepted. Businesses in the country work with us before anyone else. Many of the Free Aviators themselves have even declared support for our regime. The time is right to bring Surgut into the fold."

 #SVR_send_workers_north: "Send Workers North"
 #SVR_send_workers_north_desc: "Surgut's lifeblood is in its oil resources. Most nations in this region purchase oil from Surgut's supply, and demand for the black gold is ever increasing. Sverdlovsk's oil demand has increased steadily as our reunification campaign has progressed, and this trend is bound to continue as we begin to deploy motorized and armored divisions.\n\nDespite this, Surgut has struggled to capitalize on the situation and increase output. The biggest limiting factor for Surgut appears to be the manpower available to extract the resource. By offering the services of our own workers and engineers, we might be able to boost oil output for our own consumption and improve relations with the Free Aviators."

 #SVR_the_devil_cornered: "The Devil Cornered"
 #SVR_the_devil_cornered_desc: "When the bombings ended, many in Sverdlovsk were unsure as to the Military District's position in this new post Luftwaffe age for Russia. It has become apparent now that Sverdlovsk stands among the strongest powers in Russia, having taken out both Omsk and Tyumen, two of the strongest warlords in Western Siberia. This is no time to rest on our laurels, however. There remains threats to Sverdlovsk still.\n\nZlatoust is one such threat. Their arms trade is pumping high quality weapons directly into the hands of those who would have us destroyed. That said, Zlatoust has an extremely well equipped military, and a bank with which to hire endless mercenaries. Conquering the small nation could end up forcing us to expend far more resources than we can afford. Consequently, it might be beneficial to give an offer of integration before authorizing military action against Zlatoust."

At only 38 years old, Dmitry Yazov continues his predecessor's tradition of ultranationalist militarism and focus on destroying Germany.\n\nWhile we aren't necessarily in opposition to such an aim, Yazov has decided that in order to complete this goal he will have to conquer all of Russia, and we stand right at his doorstep. Already Omsk has begun preparing for conflict with Sverdlovsk through the mass collection of what we thought was secure information. Among the files lost are our current industrial capacity, army size, and many of our plans for expansion. Plugging these information leaks and rooting out Yazov's spies are top priority."

Practically, this has led to many in the army deserting, and many more simply avoiding military service.\n\nLetting this dangerous notion of loyalty towards Kaganovich fester within the nation and create further discontent among the people will exacerbate the severity of our problems greatly in the future.

Now that our internal enemies have been put to rest, we can go about properly and fully reincorporating the newly retaken territories into a unified polity, strengthening our hold on the region.\n\nThere are still millions of square kilometres left to liberate and countless foes standing in our way. The road ahead is long. It shall be littered with the blood of tyrants and the brave soldiers who killed them alike. But for now, the hope for a greater, stronger Russia will ride with us, the men and women courageous enough to carry the flame into the darkness. For now, we are one step closer."

 SVR_the_status_of_the_district: "The Status of the District"
 SVR_the_status_of_the_district_desc: "After years of war, bombings, and bloodshed, it would appear that we have finally managed to unite Western Siberia under our rule. Once the last holdouts of warlords and ideological fanatics are flushed out, we're going to have to make some tough decisions. Sverdlovsk has been under military rule for years now, and this has served our interests well. The unstable nature of Russia at the time necessitated that the military be given priority in decision making at the national level.\n\nHowever, Sverdlovsk has already done what it set out to do. We've reunited a significant portion of Russia and brought our nation to the point we're no longer under constant threat of invasion. Democratic proponents argue that, in light of the situation, it's time to begin transitioning into a democracy. The military argues that such measures are premature, and that our position is not yet safe enough to allow for democracy. In order to style the matter, a referendum will be held on the matter. Will Sverdlovsk become a democracy or not?"
 
 SVR_the_army_knows_best: "The Army Knows Best"
 SVR_the_army_knows_best_desc: "Our nation is not yet in a safe enough position to begin implementing democracy. The warlord era of Russia may be coming to a close, but Russia is far from unified. The large superstates that have arisen from the ashes of the Soviet Union are just as dangerous, if not more so, than any threat we've faced before.\n\nWhile we certainly support the system on principle, for the sake of the people, we can't yet allow military rule to end. If that means playing dirty in this upcoming referendum, then so be it."
 
 SVR_fledgling_democratic_institutions: "Fledgling Democratic Institutions"
 SVR_fledgling_democratic_institutions_desc: "Preparing the apparatuses of government for a transition into democracy is no easy task. Not only does one have to alter the functions of previous bureaucracies and departments and their respective systems of appointments, but one also has to create entirely new institutions in order to accommodate the new form of government.\n\nThese are institutions like a national congress and an independent judiciary. Responsibilities and functions previously handled by the military have to be divorced from the executive and redistributed amongst these institutions. It's hard work setting up a new government, but ultimately worth it."
 
 SVR_deciding_the_future: "Deciding the Future"
 SVR_deciding_the_future_desc: "The day of the referendum has arrived. Men and women across the nation mark time with bated breath as they await the results. Labourers from the factories and mines sit at the bars, drinks in hand, listening intently for what the radio announcer has to say.\n\nA group of young students wait in the capital's square for the inevitable announcement on the loudspeakers. Soldiers in their barracks sit in groups, patiently waiting for their captains to return from high command and bring them the news. A nation sits on edge as a government bureaucrat tallies the votes and recognizes the victor to be..."

 SVR_the_guiding_hand_of_the_marshal: "The Guiding Hand of the Marshal"
 SVR_the_guiding_hand_of_the_marshal_desc: "The Army under Marshal Pavel Batov have managed to secure victory in the elections! With the Army's hold over government secured, Marshal Batov will continue to lead the District to more victories against those that would threaten Russia and her people.\n\nWar plans are to be reviewed and revised. Military research funding is to be doubled, alongside the budget of the military itself. Under our Marshal's guidance, the District will prosper and expand. Soon, we may even be able to call ourselves Russia."
 
 SVR_establish_the_council_of_generals: "Establish the Council of Generals"
 SVR_establish_the_council_of_generals_desc: "Even the greatest of leaders can't run a nation by themselves. A council of generals is to be established, with the purpose of both advising the Marshal and helping carry out his directives both on the front lines and in the government. These generals will serve a secondary purpose. They will act as a check on the Marshal's power.\n\nShould he ever begin making erratic decisions or begin taking actions against the stability or benefit of the District, they will act and remove him as head of the government. Hopefully the situation never degrades to such a point, but should it occur, we will be prepared."
 
 SVR_russian_stratocracy: "Russian Stratocracy"
 SVR_russian_stratocracy_desc: "Our governmental administration is a prime example of the efficiency of the military. Our soldiers are regimented within an inch of their lives during their service, and keep that regimented attitude about life when they leave. These men become warriors, brave and unafraid to do what needs to be done in the moment.\n\nOur military boys are the cream of the crop, and have proved how effective and trustworthy they are in government. Surely it makes sense to reserve certain positions in government for former military personnel. By ensuring that important governmental positions go to those who have served in some capacity, we ensure both the efficiency and legitimacy of government."
 
 SVR_enshrine_army_traditions: "Enshrine Army Traditions"
 SVR_enshrine_army_traditions_desc: "The 3rd Army and its traditions have been instrumental in defeating our enemies so far. The impact that the 3rd Army has had, not only on the government but on the wider culture of our state at large, has been immense.\n\nIndeed, it's been these men's courage and discipline that's seen the District through its toughest times, and the people have taken note. We must make sure that our military traditions are respected and veterans treated with respect. Too many of our soldiers have seen their comrades die only to be disrespected by some youth on the street. Our men will get the respect they deserve."
 
 SVR_calm_their_fears: "Calm Their Fears"
 SVR_calm_their_fears_desc: "Many of our citizens are still wary of military rule, despite the governmental and military successes of our military administration in the past. We must assuage these fears in the public and assure them that the military knows what's best for the nation and is actively working towards its betterment.\n\nA propaganda campaign highlighting our military's victories in years past coupled with praise of the military administration's handling of the economy and general governance should go a long way towards changing the hearts and minds of our citizens on military rule."
 
 SVR_enlistment_benefits: "Enlistment Benefits"
 SVR_enlistment_benefits_desc: "The Army always needs more men. As our enemies across the border grow their armies, so too must we. In order to increase enlistment, however, we will have to sweeten the deal in order to entice young men to join. The threat of imminent invasion is no longer as easily applicable as a motivator now that our geopolitical situation has stabilized as much as it has.\n\nImplementation of a guaranteed pension system for veterans, respect, and the option to be a part of the political machine in the District will be just some of the benefits a soldier can reap if they enlist in the Army. That surely ought to increase enlistment rates."
 
 SVR_establish_provincial_military_governors: "Establish Provincial Military Governors"
 SVR_establish_provincial_military_governors_desc: "Local lower level bureaucrats and elected governors have been giving our administration a tough time. They've been slow to implement new laws we pass, have directly opposed the ruling military council on various occasions, and have been encouraging anti-military treason.\n\nThis is a situation which can no longer be tolerated. From here on out, all provincial governorships and political positions at other administrative subdivisions of government will be filled with military officers as opposed to locally elected leaders or party officials."
 
 SVR_rewarding_the_loyal: "Rewarding the Loyal"
 SVR_rewarding_the_loyal_desc: "Despite our best efforts, there remains a great deal of citizens unhappy with our rule. They argue that such military interference with the government is corrupt, inefficient, and harmful to citizen participation in government. We must show them that this isn't the case at all.\n\nCitizens are certainly allowed to participate in government, should they prove to be loyal and trustworthy enough. Though most major positions will be filled by military men, we will reserve a few token lower tier bureaucracy jobs for the average citizen who hasn't served in order to satisfy the people."
 
 SVR_for_the_greater_good: "For the Greater Good"
 SVR_for_the_greater_good_desc: "Military rule in the government is necessary to save our state from corrupt and ineffective politicians. They failed to protect the nation from dangerous ideologies like Marxism and fascism in the past, and we have no reason to believe they will do so in the future. From now on, the government will be controlled solely by the military and armed forces.\n\nFree parties willing to undermine our national security are to be banned. While these measures we've implemented may upset some citizens, it's important to remember that all we do, we do for the greater good."
 
 SVR_ease_martial_law: "Ease Martial Law"
 SVR_ease_martial_law_desc: "The reaction to many of our recent laws and proclamations have been rather negative. Many of our citizens have grown increasingly angry about what we've done since assuming power, and some of our citizens are even resorting to violence.\n\nIn order to quell the public outrage and perhaps ease tensions with the citizenry, the military government will be easing martial law and late night curfews restrictions immediately, with a plan to eventually phase out these laws all together. Hopefully, such measures will succeed in calming the people and will make a more violent response unnecessary."
 
 SVR_a_meaningful_life: "A Meaningful Life"
 SVR_a_meaningful_life_desc: "The Marshal is a strict and, in some cases, harsh leader, but he is not an apathetic one. Marshal Batov understands the plight of the common worker, as well as what our nation is fighting for. Effective immediately, a series of regulations and reforms are to be implemented in industry and across the greater economy improving worker conditions.\n\nSpecifically, his reforms will center on lowering working hours and some minor safety reforms. In turn, we should hope to further quell dissent and shore up support for the military. The Marshal is looking out for us, the common man."
 
 SVR_every_hand_is_useful: "Every Hand Is Useful"
 SVR_every_hand_is_useful_desc: "During the early years of Bukharin and the Siberian Plan, working conditions were awful. The Communist Party cared little for the safety of its citizens, and industrial accidents were far too common.\n\nWe, however, are a far more modern and enlightened state which cannot abide by such unnecessary loss. In light of this, the Marshal has greenlit further regulation to improve safety standards and prevent accidents that have been all too common. No man is expendable if we wish to one day rule over Russia."
 
 SVR_the_guardians_of_russia: "The Sentinels of Russia"
 SVR_the_guardians_of_russia_desc: "The Marshal, his Council, and the Army are the only thing keeping our state from the chaos that rages around us. They have secured us, and under their guidance have seen our nation claim victory in even the most dire of times. Now, we must do the same for the rest of Russia.\n\nOur people lie broken and scattered across the Russian wastes, and if they are ever to unify and become whole again, it will have to be under our rule. We are the sentinels of Russia, those who will safeguard and protect it, keeping watch for all those who would do it harm."
 
 ### Regional Batov economy tree ###
 SVR_rebuilding_the_district: "Rebuilding the District"
 SVR_rebuilding_the_district_desc: "The District has suffered major damage in recent years. Heavy fighting has resulted in the mass destruction of infrastructure and industry, and has killed thousands. It's time to begin investing in the rebuilding of our country.\n\nRaw materials and resources will be put to rebuilding factories and laying down new roads, financial aid will be offered to people whose livelihoods have been destroyed, and camps set up for the various displaced peoples in our country. Hopefully, within a few months we should have the majority of our industry operational again and people resettled."
 
 SVR_taking_inventory: "Taking Inventory"
 SVR_taking_inventory_desc: "There are hundreds, if not thousands, of pieces of equipment and weapons left over from the former warlord states that we conquered. While most all of it is shoddily made, outdated, or in poor condition, most still work. Much of these rifles and other equipment is simply floating around out there unchecked and free to be used by any insurgents who want to use it.\n\nWe should endeavor to locate, catalog, and store all the leftover equipment we can find and add it to our own stockpile, both for safekeeping and emergencies. The situation may never call for these weapons to be used, but it's always better to have and not need than to need and not have."
 
 SVR_temporary_fully_controlled_economy: "Temporary Fully Controlled Economy"
 SVR_temporary_fully_controlled_economy_desc: "While the District is entirely opposed to the planned economies and autarkic setups that communist and fascist nations preach, it has become apparent the necessity of the implementation of a war economy setup not too dissimilar to those we have previously rejected.\n\nWar for dominance in Russia is an inevitability, and while it's true that a planned economy is far less efficient long term compared to a free market economy, we simply can't afford to let factory owners and industry barons squeeze the government at such a time like this."
 
 SVR_the_resources_of_siberia: "The Resources of Siberia"
 SVR_the_resources_of_siberia_desc: "Our war economy needs resources, and thankfully, we happen to be sitting on one of the largest supplies of natural resources on Earth. The mineral value that Siberia offers is as bountiful as Siberia is large, we should work to further exploit in order to further production of all the military equipment we need. Additionally, once unification is complete and Russia can begin to shift back into a free market, we can use the resources to boost our economy by providing cheap easy capital as we sell them in foreign markets."
 
 SVR_a_fair_wage: "A Fair Wage"
 SVR_a_fair_wage_desc: "For what reason do we work to unify Russia if not for the common people? Our tireless efforts have been to secure a stable and fair nation for all peoples of Russia, one in which all working men are paid their due. To that end, the government will be implementing a new fair wages law, raising the minimum wage across the nation. It is our hope that this measure will see not only wages rise, but also quality of life and purchasing power for the average citizen. Though times have changed, our commitment to the people has not."
 
 SVR_the_best_and_the_brightest: "The Best and the Brightest"
 SVR_the_best_and_the_brightest_desc: "If the past thousand years of history has taught us anything, it's that better technology almost always wins. Whether it be Ottoman cannons besieging Constantinople, British riflemen colonizing Africa, or a single German bomber ending WW2 in one fell swoop, we've seen time and time again the advantage that better technology gives us over our enemies. Arguably what's even more important is the effect technology can have on one's own nation as well.\n\nThe industrial revolution boosted the economic output of Great Britain a hundred times over, made agricultural goods easily transportable, and raised millions out of poverty. We must seek out the best and the brightest in our nation, and give them all the resources they need to bring Russia into the future."
 
 SVR_military_engineering_schools: "Military Engineering Schools"
 SVR_military_engineering_schools_desc: "As our economy grows, more factories will be built, construction projects started, and technical companies founded, all of which will need engineers. Unfortunately, as things stand today, our education system cannot accommodate the need for engineers now, let alone what will be needed in a few years. Even our military is having trouble getting a hold of good engineers.\n\nThus, in order to alleviate the situation, the military will be handling the construction of several new engineering schools. These schools will be free of cost, provided the student spends four years serving once their education is complete. Then, after their four years in the military, they will be free to bring their skills back home to the civilian economy. Everybody wins!"
 
 SVR_investing_in_machinery: "Investing in Machinery"
 SVR_investing_in_machinery_desc: "Since the collapse following the West Russian War, our ability to research newer and more efficient manufacturing machinery and technology has been nonexistent.\n\nHowever, with the reunification of Russia complete, we can finally begin focusing on modernizing the nation's industrial technology. Such things as basic integration of computers, more reliable and tactile machinery used in large scale production plants, and the implementation of isostatic processing vessels should help increase our productive capacity."
 
 SVR_expand_the_bureau: "Expand the Bureau"
 SVR_expand_the_bureau_desc: "The Sverdlovsk Design Bureau has far and away outperformed every expectation we had of it when it was first formed. The bureau has spearheaded development on a variety of fronts, from the development of a new standard rifle to novel research on transistor computation and how it could improve the efficiency of our current computers.\n\nGiven the immense contribution this organization has made both to our national security and science as a whole, a raise in funding shouldn't be off the table. In fact, the vastly increased budgetary needs of the bureau as it expands and modernizes its research facilities alone should entitle it to at least a thirty or forty percent increase in budget."
 
 SVR_increase_reconstruction_efforts: "Increase Reconstruction Efforts"
 SVR_increase_reconstruction_efforts_desc: "Reconstruction of our territories has taken longer than expected. The fighting of recent wars combined with the already critical lack of infrastructure into and through rural areas has made the process infinitely more slow.\n\nOver half of our expenditures so far have been exclusively towards repairing roads and other infrastructure, and we've made little progress actually addressing the people's needs as a result of this. Our reconstruction efforts must be redoubled, with increased funding and manpower if we are to make a difference."
 
 SVR_the_defense_industry: "The Defense Industry"
 SVR_the_defense_industry_desc: "Civilian industry is, of course, important. Civilian industry is important for a peacetime economy and will be necessary for rebuilding Russia. That said, there won't be a nation to rebuild if you can't arm your army. Russia still faces various threats on all sides, and an investment into our defense industry would ensure that our military remains powerful enough to combat these threats.\n\nWith nations such as Germany and Japan at our border, not only do we need the best equipment, we also need as much of that equipment as possible."
 
 SVR_the_civilian_industry: "The Civilian Industry"
 SVR_the_civilian_industry_desc: "Civilian industry is vital to the strength of our nation. An economy focused entirely on military production cannot function. Civilian industry provides for all of the quality of life needs our people might have, be it toasters, ploughs, light bulbs, or shovels.\n\nMost importantly for the government, civilian industry helps grow the economy and provides materials with which to build more factories, such as steel, concrete, and glass. If we are to rebuild Russia, we will need to invest into civilian industry so that we can produce said materials to do so."
 
 SVR_on_the_way_to_recovery: "On the Way to Recovery"
 SVR_on_the_way_to_recovery_desc: "The policies and investments we've made have begun to bear fruit. People are out and about on the streets spending money and using credit. Factories, for the first time in decades, have begun to manufacture goods and products wholly unrelated to warfare.\n\nThe streets and rail lines connecting major cities and towns no longer break off in sections or have craters through them. Russians across the nation are experiencing a novel sensation, long thought forgotten. Russians are beginning to feel peace again."

 ### Yeltsin political tree ###
 SVR_a_victory_for_democracy: "A Victory for Democracy!"
 SVR_a_victory_for_democracy_desc: "West Siberia has not known the light of liberty for quite some time. Ruled first by Lazar Kaganovich's fanatic communists, the region quickly dissolved into three way tensions between them, the Black League's extreme revanchists, and our own state, which has its own sorrowful history of authoritarianism. The difference, of course, is that our own regime has been controlling more out of necessity than ideology. Now that the Urals are peaceful at last, there is no need for such a tight hand.\n\nMarshal Batov has decided to begin the handover of power to a civilian government, with trusted politician Boris Yeltsin at the head of the West Siberian Republic. Yeltsin has a reputation for an advocacy of economic reform, and the region can expect a loosening of political and market restrictions alike under his reign."
 
 SVR_begin_privatization: "Begin Privatization"
 SVR_begin_privatization_desc: "The military regime had a tendency of centralizing economic as well as political power around itself, nationalizing a number of key economic sectors, although it never went as far as the communists who preceded it. The result: a number of bloated, inefficient public enterprises, unable to adequately reform or make a profit. Although these may have been necessary during the wartime period, they will not suffice for future economic growth. Reforms are in order.\n\nPrivatizing and splitting up these behemoths will promote healthy competition and ultimately a more prosperous society. Creative potential is brimming beneath the surface, and all it will take to ensure a better society is allowing West Siberia's more entrepreneurial citizens the chance to unleash them."
 
 SVR_ensure_regional_soviet_autonomy: "Ensure Regional Soviet Autonomy"
 SVR_ensure_regional_soviet_autonomy_desc: "One holdover from the communist administration is the presence of regional authorities that ultimately had very little say in running their locales. Ensuring autonomy for lower levels of government was brushed aside by the military, which felt as though it had greater concerns. A division of authority is an important step in the establishment of democracy; letting the central government have everything is a surefire way to get tyranny.\n\nPresident Yeltsin has therefore decided to vest a significant degree of power over taxation, spending, and a wide variety of other duties to the regional soviets, ensuring that the people have a greater degree of representation than the era where Sverdlovsk bureaucrats made all the decisions. An empowered populace is a happy one, and nothing satisfies the masses like self-determination."
 
 SVR_codify_the_constitution: "Codify the Constitution"
 SVR_codify_the_constitution_desc: "Up until now, the government has ruled largely by decree. Matters of law and policy were largely the decision of Marshal Batov, and, although he was by no means a cruel ruler, this meant that decisions were largely arbitrary and sometimes not in the best interests of the people. A government needs to have an agreed upon set of rules in order to avoid becoming one that rules solely through the imposition of force, and this is exactly what President Yeltsin insists on doing.\n\nThe new constitution of the West Siberian Republic will include protections of the basic, vital freedoms of speech, expression, religion, and assembly. It will create defined roles for different sections of the government and clarify the relationship between the local and federal governments. Although we may not realize its benefits immediately, this document is the foundation of a democracy that will someday incorporate the entire country."
 
 SVR_free_the_press: "Free the Press"
 SVR_free_the_press_desc: "No free nation can function without a free press. The press are the fourth estate, a fundamental part of democracy. The press act as the watchdogs, exposing corrupt politicians and bureaucrats alike. In years past, the press was kept silenced, an attempt to keep up morale during difficult times, and maintain the stability of the government.\n\nWhat wasn't understood however, was that such policy and regulation of the media only further destabilized the government and weakened our nation by allowing the corrupt and unjust to reign. The time for censorship has come and gone. Now is the era of a free press."
 
 SVR_moving_to_a_civilian_administration: "Moving to a Civilian Administration"
 SVR_moving_to_a_civilian_administration_desc: "President Yeltsin's reforms have already affected much of West Siberian society, but they have still taken place under the military regime. It is not enough to change the highest authority in the system; in order to have a proper government, civilian authorities need to be in power at every rank of the government. Otherwise, the conflicts of interest between the military and the nation could very well lead to corruption and a renewed despotism.\n\nGenerals currently serving in government posts will be dismissed and replaced with qualified civilian candidates. Active military members will no longer fill what should be elected positions. These measures may be dramatic, but they are the only way to ensure that the new government does not devolve into a junta with a thin democratic veneer."
 
 SVR_meet_with_the_marshal: "Meet with the Marshal"
 SVR_meet_with_the_marshal_desc: "The changing of the guard has generated a great deal of consternation within some elements of society. Military officials question the wisdom of opening up society in turbulent times and express skepticism that economic privatization will do anything other than enrich a few profiteers rather than bolster the national interest. A showdown between Yeltsin's reformers and the military would be disastrous for the Republic; it is for this reason that the current President and former President will be meeting to smooth over these differences.\n\nBatov and Yeltsin can be expected to discuss matters of the economy, democratization, and the army's role in the new government, with the goal of reaching a compromise satisfactory to all parties. Although hardliners on both sides may grumble at the conclusion reached, all can agree that dialogue is a vastly more preferable method than bloodshed for resolving our disagreements."
 
 SVR_free_the_parties: "Free the Parties"
 SVR_free_the_parties_desc: "With democracy secured in the nation, it's time to open up the political scene to allow for political parties to arise once more. New and varied political parties are vital for the continued success of democracy in the nation. If the people haven't parties with which they can identify and express their political opinions, then what use is a democracy at all? It would simply be a representation of the elite who control the largest parties!\n\nIn any event, this occasion is to be a momentous one in our history. Long live the Republic!"
 
 SVR_ensure_army_representation: "Ensure Army Representation"
 SVR_ensure_army_representation_desc: "The new government is thoroughly a civilian regime, but the army clearly needs some role. The President's discussion with Marshal Batov has illuminated the necessity of cooperation between the different sections of the state as West Siberia transitions into a democracy. Alienating the army is very dangerous; with some effort, it could be made into an ally of democracy rather than an opponent.\n\nThe parliament of the young Republic will always have some form of military representation, in order to better ensure good relations between it and the elected government. These will serve as a bedrock of stability inside our institutions; if civilian rulers go off the rails, the military can step in to protect the system and national security. As the West Siberian Republic is still in danger of threats from without and within, this arrangement has great potential."
 
 SVR_checks_and_balances: "Checks and Balances"
 SVR_checks_and_balances_desc: "No true democracy can consider itself as such without the implementation of a proper system of checks and balances. Checks and balances ensure that power is never centralized too much in the hands of one individual or group of individuals.\n\nSuch is needed in our republic with the army. Despite having already transitioned formally into a republic, the army still holds great sway in the nation's politics. We should work towards stripping away some of that power, perhaps coming to an agreement with the heads of the military to make it so."
 
 SVR_a_shaky_foundation: "A Shaky Foundation"
 SVR_a_shaky_foundation_desc: "While our republic is now a free and democratic governance, we still have many problems to deal with from the days of military rule, most notably of which is the extremely low level of citizen participation in our democracy.\n\nMany of our citizens are either unaware or apathetic of their new democratic rights and responsibilities in our republic. It's our responsibility to make sure they become informed about what they can and cannot do in our nation, and become active voters willing to act on their beliefs."
 
 SVR_for_a_better_tomorrow: "For a Better Tomorrow"
 SVR_for_a_better_tomorrow_desc: "Despite setbacks in our transition into democracy, we have every hope that we will soon become a fair and equitable society. Already, new political parties have formed and have begun campaigning, discussions about economics and political theory are happening amongst even ordinary citizens, and people are starting to have faith in a system that just a year ago they couldn't even participate in. The Russian people are on a path to true freedom and democracy, and as long as we continue working together, there is nothing we won't be capable of."

 SVR_yeltsin_rebuilding_the_republic: "Rebuilding the Republic"
 SVR_yeltsin_rebuilding_the_republic_desc: "Our West Siberian Republic is in poor shape. Recent battles and wars we've had on our path to unification have destroyed much of our infrastructure and industry, the conquered regions being in the worst shape. This state of affairs, of course, hasn't been helped by the preceding decade of warlordism and luftwaffe bombings.\n\nIt's high time we begin focusing our political and economic efforts on rebuilding the nation and raising the standards of living nationwide. The infrastructure and industry is there, it's just a matter of repairing and renovating it."

 SVR_yeltsin_allow_strikes: "Allow Strikes"
 SVR_yeltsin_allow_strikes_desc: "The ability to strike is fundamental to democracy and workers' rights. When given the chance, a corporation will inevitably abuse workers' rights. Allowing our citizens to be able to strike will give them the ability to negotiate collectively for better wages and working conditions.\n\nNot only does this benefit the workers, but the economy as a whole as well. The more wealth goes back to the citizenry, the more money will be spent by the citizenry on goods and products. Arguably, the ability to strike is also a right, as it falls under freedom of expression. In any case, we must begin loosening restrictions on strikers, and even remove them entirely if possible."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_towards_a_market_economy: "Towards a Market Economy"
 SVR_yeltsin_towards_a_market_economy_desc: "For decades the Russian economy has been oriented almost entirely towards warfare and the production of the weapons of war. Factories put out not toasters, but rifles, artillery, tanks, planes, and every kind of explosive under the sun. However, as our state rapidly approaches full unification of the Russian states, we can begin to shift our focus towards a more normal market economy.\n\nAn economy where people build devices to increase quality of life rather than destructive potential. An economy where economic growth puts more money in people's pockets rather than rifles in soldiers' hands. An economy for a people at peace, rather than one constantly at war."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_a_more_efficient_social_safety_net: "A More Efficient Social Safety Net"
 SVR_yeltsin_a_more_efficient_social_safety_net_desc: "As the situation and economy in Russia has stabilized, our government has found itself with more resources to spare. Plenty of proposals have been made about where such resources should go, but recently, convincing arguments have been made in favour of improving our social safety net for the elderly and unemployed.\n\nAfter all, should we not respect our elders, those who fought in the Second World War and West Russian War? Those who've sacrificed so much for their homeland? Furthermore, the unemployed and destitute. We've all experienced what extreme poverty has felt like. These past two decades, if nothing else, should have given us some sort of empathy for those who have lost everything. We must provide more for our people."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_establish_the_gazprom_energy_company: "Establish the Gazprom Energy Company"
 SVR_yeltsin_establish_the_gazprom_energy_company_desc: "Siberia is among the most resource rich regions on Earth. Not only are there abundant veins of valuable ores and minerals, but the area is also home to some of the deepest reservoirs of oil on the planet. The only thing stopping us from accessing those minerals and resources in years past was capital.\n\nNow, however, with a rapidly recovering economy, our state has found itself with more financial resources with which to invest. Given our nation's growing appetite for energy in the form of oil, it only makes sense that we exploit rich Siberian lands that we have at our disposal. Hence our new state energy corporation, the Gazprom Energy Company."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_the_best_and_the_brightest: "The Best and the Brightest"
 SVR_yeltsin_the_best_and_the_brightest_desc: "If the past thousand years of history has taught us anything, it's that better technology almost always wins. Whether it be Ottoman cannons besieging Constantinople, British riflemen colonizing Africa, or a single German bomber ending WW2 in one fell swoop, we've seen time and time again the advantage that better technology gives us over our enemies. Arguably what's even more important is the effect technology can have on one's own nation as well.\n\nThe industrial revolution boosted the economic output of Great Britain a hundred times over, made agricultural goods easily transportable, and raised millions out of poverty. We must seek out the best and the brightest in our nation, and give them all the resources they need to bring Russia into the future."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_expand_the_bureau: "Expand the Bureau"
 SVR_yeltsin_expand_the_bureau_desc: "The Sverdlovsk Design Bureau has far and away outperformed every expectation we had of it when it was first formed. The bureau has spearheaded development on a variety of fronts, from the development of a new standard rifle to novel research on transistor computation and how it could improve the efficiency of our current computers.\n\nGiven the immense contribution this organization has made both to our national security and science as a whole, a raise in funding shouldn't be off the table. In fact, the vastly increased budgetary needs of the bureau as it expands and modernizes its research facilities alone should entitle it to at least a thirty or forty percent increase in budget."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_increase_reconstruction_efforts: "Increase Reconstruction Efforts"
 SVR_yeltsin_increase_reconstruction_efforts_desc: "Reconstruction of our territories has taken longer than expected. The fighting of recent wars combined with the already critical lack of infrastructure into and through rural areas has made the process infinitely more slow.\n\nOver half of our expenditures so far have been exclusively towards repairing roads and other infrastructure, and we've made little progress actually addressing the people's needs as a result of this. Our reconstruction efforts must be redoubled, with increased funding and manpower if we are to make a difference."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_the_civilian_industry: "The Civilian Industry"
 SVR_yeltsin_the_civilian_industry_desc: "Civilian industry is vital to the strength of our nation. An economy focused entirely on military production cannot function. Civilian industry provides for all of the quality of life needs our people might have, be it toasters, ploughs, light bulbs, or shovels.\n\nMost importantly for the government, civilian industry helps grow the economy and provides materials with which to build more factories, such as steel, concrete, and glass. If we are to rebuild Russia, we will need to invest into civilian industry so that we can produce said materials to do so."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_the_defense_industry: "The Defense Industry"
 SVR_yeltsin_the_defense_industry_desc: "Civilian industry is, of course, important. Civilian industry is important for a peacetime economy and will be necessary for rebuilding Russia. That said, there won't be a nation to rebuild if you can't arm your army. Russia still faces various threats on all sides, and an investment into our defense industry would ensure that our military remains powerful enough to combat these threats.\n\nWith nations such as Germany and Japan at our border, not only do we need the best equipment, we also need as much of that equipment as possible."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_investing_in_machinery: "Investing in Machinery"
 SVR_yeltsin_investing_in_machinery_desc: "Since the collapse following the West Russian War, our ability to research newer and more efficient manufacturing machinery and technology has been nonexistent.\n\nHowever, with the reunification of Russia complete, we can finally begin focusing on modernizing the nation's industrial technology. Such things as basic integration of computers, more reliable and tactile machinery used in large scale production plants, and the implementation of isostatic processing vessels should help increase our productive capacity."
 
 SVR_yeltsin_on_the_way_to_recovery: "On the Way to Recovery"
 SVR_yeltsin_on_the_way_to_recovery_desc: "The policies and investments we've made have begun to bear fruit. People are out and about on the streets spending money and using credit. Factories, for the first time in decades, have begun to manufacture goods and products wholly unrelated to warfare.\n\nThe streets and rail lines connecting major cities and towns no longer break off in sections or have craters through them. Russians across the nation are experiencing a novel sensation, long thought forgotten. Russians are beginning to feel peace again."

 SVR_the_grand_russian_army: "The Grand Russian Army"
 SVR_the_grand_russian_army_desc: "The Third Army, one of the most well-organized and equipped army units still standing in Russia, has proven its worth once again and emerged victorious from the devastating wars that wracked West Siberia. That being said, the fighting exposed some serious flaws in our strategic and tactical doctrines that may prove disastrous if our future enemies learn how to exploit them.\n\nNow that the peace has been restored to this region, a comprehensive reexamination and modernization of the Army's combat capabilities shall begin. It is true that we already possess a formidable force, but to allow our rivals to catch up would be to invite disaster. Once the military's strengths have been honed to a razor edge, the Third Army will march on as the grandest armed force in all of Russia, and victory would be practically guaranteed."
 
 SVR_the_cream_of_the_crop: "The Cream of the Crop"
 SVR_the_cream_of_the_crop_desc: "Our officer corps has become widely renowned as the finest in Russia, but can the hundreds of thousands of troops they command be held up to the same standard? The reforms made to the army's training standards provided a devastatingly effective body of troops during the war against the revisionists and the insidious Black League, but the reality is that the stakes have risen considerably since our victory and even more powerful foes now surround us on all sides.\n\nTherefore, even more wide-ranging overhauls of the training regimen are to be enacted. Our troops, already in possession of considerable skill, will be pushed to the very limits of their capabilities with a new series of recruitment standards and training routines. The Third Army shall transform into a crack force consisting of the cream of West Siberia's crop, the very best fighting men the region can muster. We simply cannot accept any less."
 
 SVR_mechanized_troop_training: "Mechanized Troop Training"
 SVR_mechanized_troop_training_desc: "During the war with Lazar Kaganovich's revisionists, his large contingent of motorized forces proved a formidable obstacle for our troops, who mostly fought while slogging it out on foot, to tackle. Although we secured a hard-fought victory in the end, our foes had taught us an important lesson even in their defeat: mechanization of the ground forces is an absolute necessity, and mechanized units lay the bedrock of any seriously modern military.\n\nComparatively, what little mechanized forces we currently possess are woefully inadequate for the wars of tomorrow. In order to create a truly modern force, the army as a whole must begin to adopt new training methods focused on the practical use of highly mobile mechanized units, so that we may better acclimate our troops to the battlefields of the future."
 
 SVR_an_end_to_outdated_tactics: "An End to Outdated Tactics"
 SVR_an_end_to_outdated_tactics_desc: "In the past, the army has relied on tactics that would not have looked out of place on battlefields of the Second World War almost twenty years ago. These ways have proven adequate so far, as was demonstrated during the conflict that saw West Siberia united under our government, but the years are marching onwards, and the times are changing faster than one would think.\n\nCountless new weapons and methods of waging war have become commonplace over the decades we have spent resting on our laurels. If we do not act soon, our armies will be left in the dust, rendered nothing more than vintage relics! The time has come to set aside the tactics of yesterday, and embrace those of tomorrow."
 
 SVR_centralized_command: "Centralized Command"
 SVR_centralized_command_desc: "Our military is blessed with the finest officer corps Russia has to offer, but with our current command structure, their talents are needlessly restrained. To better utilize their great abilities, our High Command has proposed a broad centralization of the command chain to cut down on needless red tape and allow for orders to be carried down with less hassle.\n\nWith increased control over their forces, our generals can more effectively guide the military's gradual transition into a highly professional fighting force worthy of carrying out the eventual reunification of Russia."
 
 SVR_the_shield_of_the_people: "The Shield of the People"
 SVR_the_shield_of_the_people_desc: "Defending the people of Russia from the countless harm they could potentially encounter in this cruel warlord era was one of the defining goals that brought our state into existence in the first place. Now that we control a much larger portion of this broken country than before, this noble mission has only grown ever more important since those hard days in the wake of the West Siberian People's Republic's collapse.\n\nTo that end, we must never forget our original mission and work to ensure that our people remain safe no matter how bad the going gets. Fortifications will be constructed in our home territories to help deter potential invaders, and a large range of improvements to our defensive strategies have already been proposed in the interest of minimizing civilian suffering."
 
 SVR_legacy_of_the_third_army: "Legacy of the 3rd Army"
 SVR_legacy_of_the_third_army_desc: "When we made our desperate escape from the tyrannical reign of Lazar Kaganovich and his republic, the decorated Third Army formed the bulk of our armed forces. Through thick and thin, the brave men and women of this army led our statelet from victory to victory, securing a lasting peace for the people of West Siberia. With more conflicts on the horizon, the veterans of the Third will no doubt have the opportunity to write even more chapters in their triumphant history.\n\nThe Third Army is more than just our most elite force, it is a heroic symbol of everything our new Red Army now stands for. The hefty legacy this army has already established shall serve as the model for all our future armies to follow, with the Third becoming a bright, shining beacon of honor and discipline for our noble troops to aspire to."
 
 SVR_the_sverdlovsk_tank_factory: "The Sverdlovsk Tank Factory"
 SVR_the_sverdlovsk_tank_factory_desc: "The Sverdlovsk Tank Factory is one of the largest tank factories still in operation in Russia, rivaled only by the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory to the west. Unfortunately, the factory has suffered much damage from the dreaded Luftwaffe and their cruel bombing raids, and a large portion of this damage has gone without repair. The sorry state that the factory currently exists in is severely crippling its output, and something must be done if we wish to build a sizable tank force for the Red Army.\n\nNot only will the factory be repaired, but ambitious plans have been drawn up to expand the factory well beyond its original capabilities. Should these plans be put into motion, the factory will find new life, and our military will finally be bolstered with a fearsome tank fleet with which to brush aside the enemies of Russia!"
 
 SVR_quality_materials: "Quality Materials"
 SVR_quality_materials_desc: "What good is a tank if it cannot even withstand the most basic of modern anti-tank weaponry? The field of anti-tank munitions has advanced far while Russia has been stuck in this mess, and much of these new weapons have rendered our armored forces completely helpless should our enemies begin to employ them. Luckily, there may be a stop-gap solution while better tank designs are considered.\n\nBy improving the quality of the metals our tanks are produced with, we may be able to increase their effectiveness against anti-tank weaponry. Regrettably, our current force is mostly relying on vintage designs from the last decade, but with newly available quality metals and a little creativity, we can make additions to our tanks' armor layout that can enhance their survivability and keep them in the fight."
 
 SVR_establish_the_rokossovsky_military_academy: "The Rokossovsky Military Academy"
 SVR_establish_the_rokossovsky_military_academy_desc: "Konstantin Rokossovsky was more than just a general, he was the man who secured the safety of Sverdlovsk's people and heroically turned the tables on the tyrants who oppressed them. Even now the Lion of Siberia's brilliant strategies have a great deal of influence in our armies, and without his wise leadership we wouldn't have achieved nearly the same level of success within and without.\n\nTo honor the recently departed Marshal, the Rokossovsky Military Academy will soon open its doors in Sverdlovsk. This place of martial learning shall be the birthplace of Russia's new generation of officers, and allow us to proudly continue our tradition of being the most capably-led force in all of Russia even as time relentlessly marches forward.\n\nEven in death, the old lion shall forever guide and watch over the brave officers of the Red Army."
 
 SVR_the_expertise_of_zlatoust: "The Expertise of Zlatoust"
 SVR_the_expertise_of_zlatoust_desc: "The brilliant engineers of Zlatoust were masters of the craft, standing at the very forefront of arms production even when compared to foreign designs. Their weapons can be found all throughout the broken nation of Russia, and with good reason. The guns of Zlatoust are cheap to produce, reliable in the field, and pack a serious punch. It is easy to see why the warlords of Russia would be willing to pay a king's ransom to get their hands on such weaponry!\n\nWith Zlatoust and its arms production facilities under our control, it would make a great deal of sense to continue funding of these arms designers. This time, however, they will serve us rather than themselves. The Zlatoust factories will help equip our military exclusively with some of the most cutting-edge weapons and equipment in the world, putting us leagues ahead of our rivals."
 
 SVR_the_factories_of_tyumen: "The Factories of Tyumen"
 SVR_the_factories_of_tyumen_desc: "The region of Tyumen is a key industrial sector in West Siberia, but to say that these factories are in a sorry state would be to put it mildly. The region suffered for many years under the mismanagement of Kaganovich's regime, and the industry has clearly paid a heavy price for the incompetence of their former tyrannical ruler. The final nail in the coffin came with the storms of war which raged over the breadth of the remnant republic not too long ago.\n\nNow that they've been overthrown, we can begin repairing and expanding the factories of Tyumen to get them back into running order once again. Tyumen is an important keystone in the industry of the West Siberia, and once it has been revived to its former glory our economy will surely see great benefit."
 
 SVR_the_airfields_of_surgut: "The Airfields of Surgut"
 SVR_the_airfields_of_surgut_desc: "The vast majority of air facilities in West Siberia are now but bombed out husks of their former selves, thanks to the relentless bombing campaigns unjustly waged upon us by the Hun. Surgut's airfields, however, are a different story entirely.\n\nEfficiently maintained by the formerly-independent Free Aviators, these airfields are nearly in mint condition and now make up some of the largest Russian air facilities still in operation. Now that the airfields have the weight of an entire nation behind them, we have the opportunity to expand and improve the airfields far beyond their previous capabilities to better serve our fledgling air force."
 
 SVR_revolutionary_designs: "Revolutionary Designs"
 SVR_revolutionary_designs_desc: "Our improvements to the armor of our tanks already seem promising indeed, but you can only modify those ancient piles of junk for so long before severe flaws begin to emerge that cannot be fixed by welding on even more spaced armor. Our mechanized forces need new, modern designs to go into battle with, and our current models simply won't do.\n\nWith both the refurbished tank plant at Sverdlovsk and the Ural Automotive Plant at our disposal, we can and will do better. Our technicians, some of the most brilliant of their generation, will soon find themselves hard at work designing the armored vehicles of tomorrow. New and improved tanks outfitted with the latest munitions and armor designs will dominate the battlefield, while modernized IFVs will carry our troops into the fray and support them with enough firepower to level a city block."
 
 SVR_eyes_inside_the_machine: "Eyes Inside the Machine"
 SVR_eyes_inside_the_machine_desc: "One of the most regrettable incidents of the West Siberian Wars was the degree to which the enemy was able to infiltrate our ranks. No part of our statelet was safe, from the civilian sector to the military, and spies were a constant danger to our operations. With the establishment of the Internal Security Bureau, we were able to put a stop to most of this madness, but now that the region has been unified we face larger threats than ever before, and currently the ISB is in no state to handle them.\n\nTherefore, we will direct increased funding to the ISB to help them expand their operations. This time, we will no longer cower behind our defenses and root out infiltrations as we spot them. The ISB will find itself on the offensive, launching daring espionage missions into enemy territory and using highly advanced computing technology to break their codes. The Bureau will become our vigilant eyes and ears, and threats to the nation will never go undetected again."
 
 SVR_invincible_and_legendary: "Invincible and Legendary"
 SVR_invincible_and_legendary_desc: "Comrades, the reforms are nearly complete! Our troops have finally earned their status as the most well-trained professional fighting force in all of Russia, our formidable tank fleet grows by the day, and the indomitable war machine of the Urals has finally sprung to life after nearly two decades of slumber. It took a great deal of time and effort, but the Red Army has been transformed into a truly modern force, more than ready to face whatever challenges the future has in store for them.\n\nUniting West Siberia was only the start of our journey. Soon, we will turn our attention to the total liberation of the entire country. The people of Russia cry out for justice, and the Red Army is dutifully willing to answer the call! Our invincible troops will become a nightmare to the would-be tyrants of this broken land, and our legendary generals will be the ones to lead them to victory!"

 SVR_reaching_out: "Reaching Out"
 SVR_reaching_out_desc: "With Western Siberia firmly under our control, we can begin to participate in international politics once more. Our first task will be to establish contact with the outside world. During the warlord period, Sverdlovsk was hard pressed to get information to and from Arkhangelsk, let alone to far off nations like the United States.\n\nWith the region quickly stabilizing under our control, however, reestablishing contact shouldn't be any trouble at all. Should we be successful, our priority as a nation will be to gain recognition on the world stage, perhaps even to be recognized as the legitimate successor state to Russia and/or the Soviet Union. Additionally, we should endeavor to begin trade negotiations with these larger powers such as the United States and Japan, as well as our neighbors."
 
 SVR_approach_the_eagle: "Approach the Eagle"
 SVR_approach_the_eagle_desc: "The United States of America is one of the foremost powers on the face of the Earth, rivalling both Japan and Germany in terms of influence and military strength. Given Russia's precarious situation between the latter two powers, being on both their borders, sharing two of the largest land borders with both superpowers of any nation on the planet, it follows that the United States would have a vested interest in our continued security and prosperity.\n\nTherefore, we should endeavor to endear ourselves to Washington, if for no other reason than to open the door for possible future agreements."
 
 SVR_establishing_a_consulate: "Establishing a Consulate"
 SVR_establishing_a_consulate_desc: "Our initial meetings with the United States went well! They seemed receptive enough to our delegation, and we even managed to fit in some preliminary talks on what form their support of our nation might take if they were to aid us. Given the reasonable success our venture has had, we should request that we be allowed to establish a consulate in Washington.\n\nThis consulate could act as a venue through which we might negotiate economic and military pacts with the government of the United States, and even establish some less than official contacts in North America."
 
 SVR_dragunovs_connections: "Dragunov's Connections"
 SVR_dragunovs_connections_desc: "Though we might harbor some personal objections against Yevgeny Dragunov and his many past dealings with our enemies, there's no denying the utility of his impressive array of foreign contacts and connections, many of which he has retained since Zlatoust fell. We should call on Dragunov, and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nWe will drop any and all charges against him from his time as an arms dealer and leader of Zlatoust, and he will help us breach into new markets and set up trade agreements through his various foreign contacts. A win-win situation."

 SVR_show_them_our_worth_desc: "Our nation may be small, but we have a lot to offer nations willing to trade with us. While our industrial capacity is limited and our capital reserves small, we happen to have one of the greatest abundance of cheap natural resources on the continent, primarily oil extracted from the far north in Siberia.\n\nWe should work to get these raw materials into foreign markets at cheap prices, encouraging their purchase and driving further investment into Russia. If we are successful, managing to find purchasers abroad for our natural wealth, we may even be able to parlay our basic trade relationship into a more comprehensive economic agreement."

 SVR_tapping_the_market_desc: "We need access to more markets. Not only do we want to be able to sell our wares and natural resources, but we also want to be able to tap on forign goods and investment. We will need to front an all out diplomatic assault.\n\nWe will have diplomats in every nation in Central Asia, in India, in Africa, in South America, and anywhere else with an easily accessible market. We will attempt to create trade agreements, economic treaties, and lower tariffs with as many nations that will let us as possible. Let the money flow."

Their empire, stretching from bountiful Italy to oil rich Arabia to the Suez in Egypt, has some of the greatest market potential on Earth, not to mention the massive consumer base they control.\n\nIt would be foolish to not at least attempt to get a foot in the door. We will send a delegation to Rome to establish diplomatic relations, and then attempt to begin negotiating trade. Should all go well, we will have a new trading partner and access to Italian financial institutions."

 SVR_sail_to_scandinavia_desc: "Scandinavia is a region intrinsically linked with Russia. Not only have we shared a border with the region for centuries, but our impact on each other's politics and culture have been immense.\n\nToday, although Russia lies in ruins, Scandinavia has sailed on through the '40s and '50s mostly intact, barring Norway's conquest. Both Finland and Sweden have managed to break into both the American and German markets, and have benefited greatly. If we can establish trade relations with Scandinavia, we too might be able to reap the rewards of their unique situation."

However, now is not the time for too much celebration. There is still much work to be done beyond just reunification. Our administration is stretched to its limits and we must work fast to quickly integrate the people of West Russia into our burgeoning state. We have endured so much worse up to this point, that our present obstacles are nothing. Thus, let us march on with ever greater resolve knowing that we can and will be victorious."

 SVR_why_we_fight_desc: "War is a terrible thing and no person easily salivates after death as men do after caviar. The people of Russia need a reason to fight. The Council of Generals has approved a propaganda campaign to remind our people why we continue onwards without stop. Our quest for reunification is not yet over. One half of Russia still remains out of our grasp, Moskowien is still under fascist control, and Russia is still weak. These are herculean tasks but we must try. Therefore, send out the best artists to draft and design new slogans, posters, and other forms of media so that once again the Russian People may be united under one flag."

 SVR_freedom_from_oppression: "Freedom from Oppression"
 SVR_freedom_from_oppression_desc: "Mother Russia will need all the help in the wars to come so why then does she relegate her daughters to be at home? The time has come to open up the restrictions to women in combat roles. They already serve with diligence in rear echelon roles and it makes no sense to restrict women from frontline duty if they meet the high standards of training. High Marshal Batov had been briefed on this and demands that these restrictions be lifted immediately."

 SVR_freedom_from_persecution: "Freedom from Persecution"
 SVR_freedom_from_persecution_desc: "For far too long, Russia has been a lawless wasteland with it carved up between bandit lords, fascists, and other wicked men. It was a free-for-all but the average person got it the worst. "Might makes right," as those wicked men say. No more. Although our Russia will be a mighty one, it must also be a fair one. Our leading legal theorists are now tasked with rehauling our legal system. It must scale up to include these larger populations and territories as well as making the courts more fair and less corrupt. The Council of Generals have recommended certain legal goals for the theorists: a more fluid appeal system, offering military service in exchange for lighter sentences, more use of jury trials, the list goes on. In our quest for the justice of all of Russia, we mustn't neglect the justice of Russia's people. Let it be done!"

Our armed forces are already blessed with proper discipline and training and we hope that if we make some issues clear on the theoretical level then we may begin to formalize it into everyday tactics.\n\nTherefore, the leading military experts and the Council of Generals are looking to conduct a formal review of standard operating procedures as well as rules of engagement. No longer will we merely claim to be a truly professional army but to become one as well!"

It should be easy to cook up a new recruiting campaign, our copywriters already have a catchy name: "The Next Generation".\n\nThe focus would be on our professionalism: no longer are we a group of conscripts with rusty rifles but we are now perhaps one of the most competent armies in all of Russia now. There is proper logistical support, real training from veterans, and, most importantly, proper compensation. The future of Russia's security is here, will you be part of the Next Generation?"

 SVR_appealing_to_the_populace_desc: "For the most part, West Russia has accepted our new administration but there remains a few insurgent holdouts. On the military front, our best men are trying to dislodge any strongholds that may yet remain but counterinsurgency is much less about bombs or bullets and more about hearts and minds. The sorry people of Russia's anarchy have suffered too long under tyrannical strongmen and warlords. Fair, we ourselves are not a civilian institution but we have no plans to be tyrannical.\n\nEven the Council of Generals hope that one day Russia may be ruled without martial law. However, the people of West Russia do not know this. Beyond words and propaganda however, the Council of Generals recommends action to build trust. We hope to integrate civilian advice and input within our ever growing administration going forwards and the people will know that."

They were a truly veritable army and our hope is that they would come in from the cold. True, the Russian People's Union is no longer an organization based upon "Marxist-Leninist" principles but no doubt we would hope that those old soldiers would reconsider. Those who are still young enough to fight may still yet have value as non commissioned officers.\n\nEven veterans who are not fit for frontline combat have survived would be a valuable asset to act as members in our officer corps. The Internal Security Bureau has also been collecting leads. There are rumors that some ex-commanders are hiding under new aliases since the reunification. Let us use our intelligence assets and find them. We mean no harm towards the former members of the WRRF. In fact, from one group of old soldiers to another, all we wish to do is give them one more chance to reunite Russia and to drive out the fascists from Moskowien."

 SVR.1.t: "A Morning Meal in the District"
 SVR.1.desc: "Squint peered to the bottom of the cast-iron pot, to the muddy soup that coated its innards. Beans stuck to its form, like pearls among a choppy sea. Squint had to admit that it was not very nutritious nor filling, but the food was food. He lifted his gaze to the line of men, women, and children who awaited their daily ration of bread and soup. He sighed. It was probably not enough, either. Squint looked at the metal platter beside him - the few crumbs blurring with the dull, slate-colored surface.\n\nBeside him stood Squeaker, the recruit, whose rifle was unslung. Occasionally, the private had to yell in a high-pitched squeal to keep the crowd in order. Without that rifle, the men and women in that line would've laughed at Squeaker's voice.\n\n"Hey," Squint said, catching the newcomer's eye, "Do you need help? Do you want to swap, new guy?"\n\n"No," Squeaker tightened his voice, trying to sound beyond his years. "I'm fine. I can do this." The kid got dropped into a squad full of mean-faced veterans and was trying to sound like he belonged there. All the others didn't like him much, but Squint saw some grit in Squeaker's demeanor: a desire to live above and beyond the call. Give him time, Squint said to Baker. Give him time.\n\n"If you say so." Squint wasn't much either at the start. He could hardly see, hence the nickname Squint. His breath fogged up his barely-fitting prescription glasses, and as he took them down to clean them, he heard a whirr and roar overpowering the din of the crowd.\n\n"Germans!" Squeaker screamed, his voice shrill with terror. "Duck! Duck!" Wasting no time, Squint dropped his spectacles and lay still, his heart beating the cavity of his chest down. Buzzing, and then silence. It took a good few minutes before the procession could continue."
 SVR.1.a: "Just another morning in the Military District."

 SVR.2.t: "Bedroom Candles"
 SVR.2.desc: "The recruiter came to Anatoly's house again today. His father, whose joints creaked along with the wooden floorboards, moved to answer the call. In his darkly-lit bedroom, Anatoly waited for his old man to return. The recruiter needed to understand that much as Anatoly would've liked to fight in the frontlines, his sick father needed him more. He stared at the flames gnawing on the wick of a slowly-melting candle as it burned into his eyes.\n\n"But your son is of age..." a firm, resolute voice echoed through the hallways of the small house. It faded, becoming faint booms and reverbs, its words blurring with the evening's noise. The neighbor's dog was barking, and a mild breeze stirred the earth.\n\n"Officer, I beg your pardon," his father said, words laden with fatigue and age, "But I need him. Surely you understand..." Boom and reverb. The voices moved back and forth, parrying, attacking, riposting. To Anatoly, it did not matter one whit. He heard the door slam closed. The impromptu reception was over.\n\nWhen the old man returned, Anatoly helped lift his legs and arms onto the bed, balancing his head on a ragged, dirty pillow. The light illuminated his father's face and the grey hair became threads of silver under the glimmer of that faint candle-fire.\n\n"Do not live the life of a soldier," Anatoly heard him say, "Do not. Do not." He drifted to the realm of sleep and snored."
 SVR.2.a: "No other option but home."

 SVR.3.t: "The Passing of One's Father"
 SVR.3.desc: ""So," the recruiter said, his voice bubbling with concern, "Is your father well?"\n\n"No," Anatoly said.\n\nFragments of the conversation came to him, in the dark bedroom where his father slept. Tonight, too, his father had been unable to rise and attend to his duties. Anatoly found himself beside the candle, with the flames gnawing on the wick, spreading an aroma of melting lard - perfume for tormented souls. In the depths of his fatigue and exhaustion, Anatoly sat beside the bed.\n\nAnatoly did not know the nature of the sickness that plagued his father. Once, his old man had a healthy complexion, and a slight paunch belied the outline of his belly. Those excesses were gone. Where there was once fat, only bone remained. Where there were energy and drive, only fatigue and lethargy settled. He could not walk, and his hands regularly shook, as if alive and separate from his will.\n\nAnatoly knew that his father's time quickly approached. He stared at that gently snoring face, a visage of genteel illness. Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. Anatoly resigned himself to that fact. If he had been elsewhere - Finland, Sweden, or Norway - his father might have been all right. Rising from his wooden, worn stool, he made for his room, stealing a glance at his father, before leaving.\n\nBy the stroke of midnight, he heard the snoring cease."
 SVR.3.a: "And so ends another life in the District."
 
 SVR.4.t: "Recruitment Drive"
 SVR.4.desc: ""Put your name and age," Baker said to the recruit, "on this form, please." As a lieutenant of the District, he'd seen many men and women who signed for a tour of service. Some chose the life because of patriotic sentiments. A heroic thing to do, but some did not live up to the expectations set by their intentions. Others out of sheer pragmatism. This category of people Baker sympathized with; after all, Rokossovsky did not deal in chits or rubles, but bread and soup.\n\nThe man who faced him, however, belonged in the same hole that Baker once did. People who had no choice but to sign up for the dirty work of operating machines that kill. The prospective recruit looked worn, rough, and shorn. Long, unkempt hair and a four o'clock shadow slowly emerging from that chin - the man looked desperate, destitute. Thin as well. Baker could not believe that he was only eighteen. Gleb had recommended this desolate, deprived person. Father was a friend, Gleb said, and besides, he was of age.\n\nAn orphan, then. The allegedly young man filled the form and showed it to Baker. Twenty, signed, Anatoly Danylovich Morozov. Thin. Unkempt. Twig shall be his nickname. If it were anyone else, Baker would have crossed out their old names and give them their new sobriquets. As things stood, he could not bring himself to do so.\n\n"Proceed to the medical office," Baker said, "if the doc says yes, I'll have you kitted out and sent to boot." An almost imperceptible nod. Just before Anatoly left him, however, Baker patted his shoulders. "You're in good hands," Baker said, "I've been through the same things. It's all right."\n\nTears simmered into a sob. "Yes," Anatoly said, "Thank you.""
 SVR.4.a: "Anatoly Danylovich Morozov: accepted into service."

 SVR.5.t: "The Two Principles"
 SVR.5.desc: "The drill instructor waited until the last of this batch of recruits - a scrawny runt named Anatoly Morozov - was seated before he began. "Sit up straight, dogs! Look at me, right now!" he shouted, his voice like thunder. Dozens of backs straightened. Some recruits jumped in their seats.\n\nHe introduced himself as Sergeant Kutuzov, and also introduced the two officers flanking him as Sergeants Tereschenko and Bazin. "Our mission is to train each of you to become a soldier of the Ural Military District! A soldier of the District possesses courage, bravery, competence, and integrity! He is the finest warrior in all of Russia! Am I clear?"\n\n"Yes, sir!"\n\n"A soldier of the District understands two things! One: he is Russian. And therefore his duty is to protect the Russian people. You are not here for revenge. You are not here for glory. You are here because you owe it to the millions of fellow Russians crushed under Hitler's boot! Am I clear?"\n\n"Yes, sir!"\n\n"Two: he is part of the 3rd Army, and therefore his loyalty is to the 3rd Army. You will be just as loyal to your fellow soldier as you will be to me, or Batov, or Rokossovsky himself! Each and every man sitting in this room depends on you giving it everything you've got! That, as well as your devotion to forging a new, stronger, safer Russia, is all we ask of you. Understand those two things, and I will not fail in my goal just as you will not fail in yours. Am I clear?""
 SVR.5.a: ""Yes, sir!""

 SVR.6.t: "Daily Life"
 SVR.6.desc: "Once, the status quo was untenable. The German bombers were slowly grinding us into dust. They destroyed our homes, damaged our roads, ruined our food stockpiles, and neutered our military capabilities. Meanwhile, the tyrant to the south raided us time and time again, breaking our defences and reaping the spoils. In effect, they were one and the same - a single, unified force dedicated to destroying Sverdlovsk.\n\nNow, our fortunes have shifted. What few bombers crawl over the Urals are met with our anti-aircraft fire, and the population of our cities have grown accustomed to the spasmodic bombing runs. Our fortifications have made each consecutive raid costlier and costlier for Kaganovich - yet he still returns. The damages and casualties caused by both the bombings and the raids have decreased exponentially. While the threat posed by the Germans and Kaganovich have become part of daily life, the civilians of Sverdlovsk go about their duties with stoicism and bravery, comforted both by the fact that there are safety measures in place to protect them and the hope that, one day, neither will harm them ever again."
 SVR.6.a: "A semblance of safety is safety nonetheless."

 SVR.7.t: "Looking on the Bright Side"
 SVR.7.desc: "Comparisons between the current standards of living and those of the prewar Union are pointless. They do nothing but drain morale and open the mind to power-hungry demagogues who will exploit that nostalgia. It is important to cherish what we have rather than lament what we lack.\n\nSverdlovsk is one of the largest cities in Russia outside of Nazi control, and our citizens enjoy a relatively high standard of living, certainly higher than most places to our east. The government and military are united in purpose; they exist to serve the people. Their concerns are heard and taken into account, and both their lives and livelihoods are protected from those who seek to destroy them. Finally, we have Marshal Rokossovsky, who leads us with dignity and indomitable resolve. He provides his citizens with everything they need to hatch out a life that may not be prosperous, but is sufficient. Men and women can safely go to work and bring home bread for their families. In Russia, where violence is the law, that should be enough for now."
 SVR.7.a: "Remember that things will be better, but they could always be worse."

 SVR.8.t: "Treasures of the Past"
 SVR.8.desc: "Ivan uncapped his pen with his teeth and held the map to his leg so he could mark it while Arkady caught his breath. Another looted warehouse. It seemed that there were a lot of would-be looters in Sverdlovsk since the moratorium on scavenging was lifted. "You stupid bastard," Arkady heaved. "That last hill nearly killed me. I don't care what your brother says anymore. We're going back."\n\n"No, hold on!" Ivan said, the cap still in his teeth. He put his pen away and scanned over the map. His brother was in the military and had promised him a hefty reward if he found anything worthwhile. Arkady looked at him intensely. "There's another building not far from here. It may be a warehouse." Arkady's grimace didn't budge. Ivan folded up the map and put it in his back pocket. "It's all downhill, old man. You can do it."\n\nThe building was a communal cabin for soldiers or travellers heading north to stop and rest for a day or two. Ivan smashed the lock with a stone and pushed the door in. Both of their eyes widened. The cabin was filled with glass jugs of water and crates of MREs. Annotated maps of the WSPR and even Russia west of the Urals covered the walls. There was a small table next to the cot on the other side of the cabin that was covered in boxes of bullets. A few rifles leaned against the table. "Christ, it's a goldmine," Arkady said, his voice weak with surprise. "Who put all this here?"\n\n"That doesn't matter, old man," Ivan said, pulling out his map. "We're about to make a certain brother of mine very, very happy.""
 SVR.8.a: "Lost riches, hidden in plain sight."

 SVR.9.t: "The Silent Skies"
 SVR.9.desc: "At long last, the skies are clear. Thanks to Marshal Rokossovsky's great efforts to protect the people and actively deter the Nazis, the bombers have disappeared and our people are free from the claws of the Luftwaffe. This is a cause for celebration! But we must not be idle. There is much work to be done to prepare Sverdlovsk for the reclamation of Russia. We cannot afford to waste time. Our industries and infrastructure must not only be repaired, but upgraded; our military must be re-equipped and strengthened; and we must investigate our rivals in the region so we know what we're up against. It's time to come out of hiding."
 SVR.9.a: "Let's get to work."

 SVR.10.t: "The View from 24A Prospekt Lenina"
 SVR.10.desc: "Konstantin sighed and let the report fall onto his desk, on top of a dozen other documents. His headache was killing him. He hauled himself to his feet. Stabs of pain ran up and down his back. He walked over to his window and leant on the sill. Dark, heavy clouds were massing on the horizon. Below him, citizens scurried about Lenin Avenue. A truck carrying a handful of soldiers rumbled past.\n\nHe was an old man with the weight of Russia - and her people - on his shoulders. How much longer did he have? A year? Two? Five? What had he accomplished? The Union collapsed, the WSPR collapsed, and Sverdlovsk was surrounded by enemies. Pavel, his appointed successor, was more than capable of leading, but he was no miracle man. He couldn't stop the bombings, he couldn't make more rations, he couldn't stop Kaganovich or Yazov. Not in the state Sverdlovsk was in.\n\nKonstantin knew these thoughts were best left unsaid, but he had to be honest with himself. And even if he doubted himself from time to time, the people never did. He was Konstantin Rokossovsky, after all! An old man, yes, but also commander of the 3rd Army, Hero of the Soviet Union, and benevolent guardian of the last bastion of freedom in all of Russia! If anyone had the mettle to reclaim Russia, it was him.\n\nA stubborn smirk crept across his face. He sat down and clicked on his desk lamp. He settled his glasses higher up on his nose and looked down at the report, picking up where he left off. He couldn't give up, not now, not ever. There was still too much work to be done."
 SVR.10.a: "Trust in the Marshal, for he trusts in you."

 SVR.11.t: "Into the Woods"
 SVR.11.desc: "Luka Fedosov's version of "teamwork training" was team sports. Sergeant Kutuzov's version of teamwork training was dumping Luka and the eight other men in his squad in the woods in the dead of night with nothing more than a few basic survival tools and the pajamas on their backs and telling them to navigate back to base. "Cooperation, even on the squad level, is a hallmark of victory," he'd said. He clearly didn't take Yuliy Lisitsyn into account.\n\nYuliy made his opinion known, no matter what, and most of the time his opinion was an insult. Luka had hoped he would ease off, given their circumstances. Even Pyotr, Luka's squad leader, told Yuliy to zip it. Unfortunately, snark doesn't require a full night's rest.\n\n"You can't start a fire by staring at it, Fedosov."\n\n"Maybe you could help me read the map, Fedosov. You must have night vision, since you clearly don't want to start that fire."\n\n"If you cut kindling as well as you cut your hand, we'd be back at base by now!"\n\nEventually, Luka got the fire started. Yuliy figured out where they were and - to Luka's surprise - thanked him. Luka joked that he wasn't sure Yuliy could read and they both laughed. They set off, and after traversing several lethal inclines and fording a river, they arrived back at base shortly after sunrise. Luka was dirty, soaked from the waist-down, and cut on both hands. When Kutuzov saw them marching back to their barrack, the only thing he said was, "What the hell happened to you?" Yuliy smirked and asked Kutuzov if he saw something he liked. Luka and the rest of the squad chuckled."
 SVR.11.a: "Camaraderie forged in trying times is the strongest bond."

 SVR.12.t: "The Four Operations"
 SVR.12.desc: "Germany's indiscriminate terror bombing campaign was a terrible crime against Russia's people. However, it was also effective in achieving its goal. With the constant threat of airborne annihilation, our armies were unable to undertake any significant maneuvers and our industrial capacity to wage war was severely limited. In essence, Germany kept Russia from unifying. During that time the Stavka was forced to sit on its hands and draw up countless variations of hypothetical plans for attacking our neighbours when the plans inevitably stopped coming. Now, the time has come to put those plans into use.\n\nAfter discarding the outdated, unnecessary or outright fantastical plans, we are left with four operations, each having to do with one of our neighbours. To the north, Operations Orange and Red will crush the bandits of Yugra and the NKVD holdouts in Vorkuta, respectively. To the south, Operation Blue will end Kaganovich's reign of terror and Operation Black will bring down the Black League in Omsk. We may strike in either direction first, but it should be noted that Tyumen and Omsk will eventually attack us on their terms if we do not strike soon."

The 3rd Army's general direction is as follows:\n(1) all units are to advance along the entire front in a single line as to prevent any small squads of bandits from bypassing our assault;\n(2) enemy militias who choose to resist will be destroyed without quarter;\n(3) enemy militias who surrender will be disarmed and all their members arrested;\n(4) all formations will converge on the bandits' principal fortification, Yugorsk, from the south and east, and eliminate any organized resistance.\n\nAny enemy militias that survive their first encounter with our forces are unlikely to be able to give battle; it will in all likelihood be unnecessary to pursue the enemy north of the Severnaya Sosva River. However, such an action may become necessary should the enemy flee northward with significant amounts of contraband. Our air wings will attempt to prevent such a withdrawal from happening by destroying any organized unit they can find.

While normally we could chalk this up to a handful of spineless pencil-pushers losing their nerve and staying in bed, it quickly became apparent that this was not the case. An examination of what private belongings they left behind revealed that these bureaucrats were agents working for Rokossovsky! Worse still, they also seem to have stolen crucial military intelligence documents before they fled.\n\nThis is an astounding betrayal - and from within our borders, no less!

All preparations made by and for the 3rd Army are to be reported to the Supreme Command of the Ural Military District.\n\nOne such threat to the success of this operation is radicalism in the citizenry. Terrorist attacks may slow or even endanger the offensive. In any such cases, extremists will be apprehended alive when possible and imprisoned. Counter-extremism operations will focus on (in order): preventing attacks, detecting threats, denying suspected threats any means of conducting attacks, and defeating attacks should they occur. Rehabilitating and deradicalizing prisoners will be of the utmost priority in order to facilitate the pacification of Omsk.\n\nSigned, KONSTANTIN ROKOSSOVSKY"
 SVR.16.a: "Will it be enough?"

 SVR.17.t: "Oblaka"
 SVR.17.desc: "The forest would have been silent were it not for the music. It wafted through the air like a ghost. Or, perhaps, a blessing. A tiding of impending good fortune. That's what Vasily Burov hoped it was. The men from Sverdlovsk had plucked every piece straight from his memory. The Alexandrov Ensemble. Prokofiev. And his favourite song, "Oblaka." When he heard Galich's haunting voice he nearly broke down in tears. That's when he decided.\n\nHis partner, Artur, sneezed. "When do you think they'll give up, Vas?" he asked. He was much younger than Vasily. The League was all he knew. Vasily shrugged. Artur prattled on. "It's pathetic, thinking they can scare us with music. Pathetic. It's because they know they can't win. They stand no chance!" Artur's cackle reminded Vasily of a bat's squeal. He rolled his eyes and slowed his pace, letting Artur take the lead. "That doesn't mean it isn't annoying. I think the GlavKom has something in the works. Shouldn't be long now."\n\n"We'll see," Vasily said. His hands shook. He drew in a deep breath, leveled his rifle and shot Artur twice in the back. The crack echoed through the trees. He rushed forward, shoving his partner to the dirt and diving into the forest, towards the source of the music. It had to be close; he could make it!\n\nHis cadre was on him in seconds. He heard shouting and saw black shapes between the trees. He screamed back at them, begging them to let him go. He was crying. Three shots rang out, two of which tore through him and laid him on the ground, facing the sky. The music was fading, now, but through the holes in the canopy the sunlight danced on his face. He admired the clouds moving freely, beyond any prison, beyond any need."
 SVR.17.a: "Find and destroy those speakers at once."

 SVR.18.t: "An Offer from Sverdlovsk"
 SVR.18.desc: "We have received a telegraph from the office of Konstantin Rokossovsky, Marshal of the Ural Military District in Sverdlovsk. He plans to attack Omsk and destroy the Black League once and for all, but in order to do that, he needs our help. He wants us to stage a border skirmish along Omsk's eastern frontier. This attack would amount to little more than a series of artillery barrages and is meant to distract the League so Rokossovsky can move in. He promises minimal casualties, if any. Such a low-level engagement is unlikely to escalade into proper hostilities, but it may anger Glavkoverkh Yazov, which will be a problem if Rokossovsky is unable to bring him down. What is our response?"
 SVR.18.a: "Yazov is a threat to all of Russia. We stand with Rokossovsky."
 SVR.18.b: "He can handle it himself."

The 3rd Army's general direction is as follows:\n(1) The Northern Front is to advance until all enemy presence south of the Usa River is defeated by way of being destroyed;\n(2) Bridgeheads across the Usa will be captured or established;\n(3) Once supply lines are under no threat from enemy encirclement, a single thrust towards Vorkuta will force enemy formations out of the city and the Vorkutlag area;\n(4) NKVD presence will be wiped out and the Department of Labour Colonies of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs (sic) will be dissolved in perpetuity.\n\nAll preparations made by and for the 3rd Army are to be reported to the Supreme Command of the Ural Military District.\n\nSigned, KONSTANTIN ROKOSSOVSKY"

 SVR.20.t: "An Offer You Can't Refuse"
 SVR.20.desc: "We have received a communique from Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky demanding the immediate surrender of Vorkuta and the surrounding territories to the Ural Military District. In return, Rokossovsky promises a high-level position in the District's government for Blokhin and a few other key officials within the Vorkutlag's management.\n\nThe offer is tempting - we would certainly benefit from joining forces with a man as powerful as Rokossovsky - but it may be too good to be true. It's no secret that Blokhin is guilty of some serious crimes. Most of the guards are complicit, if not equally guilty as well. What's stopping Rokossovsky from arresting and shooting every guard, bureaucrat, and administrator the second we lay down our arms? Plus, what happens to us if his statelet falls apart just like the West Russian Revolutionary Front did?\n\nBut can we even refuse him at all, given the strength of his military?"
 SVR.20.a: "I'll take my chances with a nice, cozy position hopefully somewhere a little warmer, thank you very much."
 SVR.20.b: "He's insane if he thinks we'll roll over for him. He can go to hell!"

 SVR.21.t: "Blokhin Folds"
 SVR.21.desc: "Ever the unideological pragmatist, Blokhin has accepted our offer. His scant forces have met with ours and are guiding them along the icy, decrepit roads leading to Vorkuta so we may secure the city, the heinous Vorkutlag that birthed it, and the ravenous wilderness surrounding them both. Yet another piece of Russia falls into our hands.\n\nAs for Blokhin, we can honour our deal and give him a position somewhere in our administration - he seems likely to accept anything - or we can imprison him for the thousands upon thousands of deaths he is responsible for and crimes against the people of the Soviet Union and Russia in general."
 SVR.21.a: "This man is a monster. He must be tried and punished!"
 SVR.21.b: "Our word is our bond."

 SVR.22.t: "Blokhin Stands Firm"
 SVR.22.desc: "In a puzzling display of defiance, Blokhin has refused our offer for surrender. Perhaps his lust for power has finally driven him off the edges of sane thought. Perhaps he was paranoid - he thought our offer was "too good to be true." Hell, maybe he just didn't like the idea of answering to someone else again after all these years. Regardless, it is a shame that he would rather subject his men to the freezing cold and certain defeat by our superior forces than see reason. There is a silver lining: now we can drop any pretense of giving Blokhin a chance to redeem himself and prosecute him like the mass-murderer he is."
 SVR.22.a: "No matter."

 SVR.23.t: "An Ultimatum from the Lion"
 SVR.23.desc: "It seems that - thanks in part to our generous arms sales, of course - Sverdlovsk has bested their rivals, Tyumen and Omsk. Rokossovsky now stands unopposed in the region, which is a problem because it means we no longer have any faction we can support to keep him in check. Kaganovich and Yazov had their problems, yes, but the animosity between those two and Rokossovsky kept the region rife with tension - tension which often erupted into border skirmishes, which meant more weapons were damaged/captured/left behind, which meant more customers for us. But with Sverdlovsk as the newly-crowned hegemon of Western Siberia, we no longer have the ability to leverage our power by taking our business to one of their rivals. What will become of our arrangement?\n\nAs of today, Rokossovsky himself has answered that question. He has sent us an offer for peaceful integration into the District. Accepting would mean that we surrender all control over what our armories produce. It would also mean that we lose any and all of our contacts outside of Sverdlovsk, effectively shutting us out of those markets permanently. Refusing would mean war. We have enough guns to fight them, as well as supremely defensible terrain, but even with those two factors on our side it is unlikely that we will be able to hold them off forever. How shall we respond?"
 SVR.23.a: "War would destroy us. We accept."
 SVR.23.b: "If he wants our guns, he can come and take them!"

 SVR.24.t: "The Golden Republic Bends the Knee"
 SVR.24.desc: "Even the Merchant of Death has some common sense. Dragunov has wisely accepted our offer for the immediate and peaceful integration of Zlatoust into the District. Our forces are moving in to secure his territory, and already 3rd Army engineers are working on plans to expand the statelet's surprisingly well-kept infrastructure system to allow better access to the rest of the District.\n\nAll of this is not to detract from the many benefits that Zlatoust offers us. We now have access to its riches: Dragunov and Kalashnikov's expertise in designing weapons, the facilities they use to build them, and access to the stockpiles they have lying in wait. And all without having to shed a single drop of blood on the rocky slopes of the Urals."
 SVR.24.a: "A tremendous victory, to be sure!"

 SVR.25.t: "The Golden Republic Stands Defiant!"
 SVR.25.desc: "Dragunov has declined our offer for his surrender, citing Zlatoust's position as a neutral arbiter and business partner for all Russian nations. The Marshal shares his desire for peace and prosperity for all Russians. Unfortunately, his refusal to abandon his neutral stance means he is ultimately against us and must be dealt with as the Marshal sees fit.\n\nIt's no surprise that Dragunov rejected us; he was never on our side to begin with. He was more than willing to arm Tyumen and Omsk - so long as they paid him - and he has no doubt been responsible for countless thousands of deaths across Russia. The only thing he cares about is money, and his lust for profit has driven him to abandon any and all moral principles. He is a gunsmithing genius, but also a war criminal that we must put down."
 SVR.25.a: "Time to pay the bill, Yevgeny."

 SVR.28.t: "The Cancer Within"
 SVR.28.desc: "Our borders remain porous, and infiltrators from both Tyumen and Omsk slither through every unpatrolled gap. They damage infrastructure vital to our internal trade system. They turn civilians and military personnel against us with propaganda and rhetoric - not actual truth. Revisionist partisans damage our military facilities and assist the enemy during raids in order to weaken us for Kaganovich's inexorable attack. Black League operatives are far more antisocial, launching car bomb and IED attacks. They also engage in full-blown shootouts with local garrisons. These elements are a threat to our nation and its people and must be dealt with at once."
 SVR.28.a: "Omsk poses a far greater threat!"
 SVR.28.b: "Tyumen lies ready to strike our borders!"

 SVR.29.t: "Amphibious Land Operations Training"
 SVR.29.desc: "The river pushed past Lyudmila, rolling frigid water against her waist. Every step was a battle; every footfall carried the promise of safety and the risk of a quick tumble into the murky depths. She was carrying nearly eighty pounds of gear excluding the rifle in her hands. Body armour, spare ammunition, a first aid kid, a headlamp, spare clothes, and more. She felt slow, sweaty. Heavy.\n\nHer concentration broke when her boot sank into a soft patch of riverbed and she stumbled forward. A choked gasp was all she managed before her head plunged beneath the river's surface. Water poured down her throat. The torrent stripped away any pretense of control in an instant. The river wanted her dead, but she refused. She pushed against the bed and staggered to her feet, her legs pumping against the current, and she didn't stop until she reached the far bank. She collapsed on the grass, coughing up water between breaths. Her heart throbbed in her ears, but she was happy to be alive, happy to have finally crossed the river.\n\nHer instructor, Viktor Leonov, clicked his stopwatch. Thirty seconds longer than his time. Thirty seconds that could get her killed. She was too focused on the weight of her gear, on the river, on keeping her rifle dry, and not focused on where she was going or returning fire. But she was also learning. He strode over to Lyudmila, congratulated her on completing the exercise, and offered her a hand up. She accepted."

Now that the situation in Western Siberia is stabilizing, the time has come to carve the bond between the 3rd Army and the 588th Night Bomber Regiment into stone.\n\nWe shall send an offer to Surgut to formally integrate their territory into the District. This is the logical culmination of our mutual cooperation. Both Sverdlovsk and Surgut will gain from the latter's integration. We will have unfettered access to their air wings, with which we may coordinate sorties against enemy forces; while they will have full access to the resources of Sverdlovsk proper, with which they can provide for their constituents."

 SVR.32.t: "Free Aviators Accept Integration!"

Trucks ferrying in the city's new garrison were cheered by the local inhabitants, and Bocharova and the rest of the Night Witches were awarded their long-due Hero of the Soviet Union medals by Marshal Rokossovsky himself in a public ceremony in 1905 Square.\n\nThe integration of Surgut marks the first piece of Russia outside of Sverdlovsk to fall under our control, and it will not be the last. Already the Aviators are proving themselves to be valuable allies in our plight. They have promised to kickstart our air force by sharing their wealth of knowledge regarding aerial combat and give our aviation industry the boost it deserves. With them on our side, our dominance of the sky is all but assured."
 SVR.32.a: "Miy sil'neye vmeste."

 SVR.33.t: "The Free Aviators Refuse?"
 SVR.33.desc: "The Free Aviators have refused our offer for integration! Most, if not all of the Supreme Command was taken aback by their refusal, and this sudden upset in our established diplomatic relationship with the Aviators has thrown not only the future of our continued cooperation but our plans for reclaiming Western Siberia as a whole into question.

Born 30.02.1934. 214th Battalion, 52nd Regiment, 139th Rifle Division. KIA in a skirmish south of Kamensk-Uralsky. He flipped the report over and sighed sadly. Married. Two children, both four years old. Drawing his pen from its inkwell, he plucked a piece of paper from his stationery and began to write.\n\n"Please accept my dearest and most genuine sympathy on the loss of your husband..."\n\nAnother letter, another tragedy. Nothing he could write would ease her pain - how could words describe the indescribable? The sorrow, the fear, the anger? Maxim died for no reason, killed by a faceless enemy and reduced to a name and photograph on a piece of paper. But he was so much more than that: a soldier, a lover, a husband, a father. Now, just a corpse. How many more would die before Russia was reunited? How many more letters would have to be written? The thought made Pavel's insides turn.\n\n"...Maxim was a hero to not only the soldiers with whom he served but all of Russia. I wish you and your family the very best as you deal with this unthinkable tragedy. If there is anything I can do to ease your pain, I welcome that opportunity..."\n\nPavel folded up the letter and slid it inside an envelope, sealing it with a wax stamp.

The tyrants of Tyumen and reactionaries of Omsk have been defeated and we remain the lone victor. General Rokossovsky will be forever remembered as a hero of the Motherland. We must also not forget those who died sacrificing their lives for the unification of West Siberia.\n\nNow, as our jubilant soldiers celebrate, we must begin the reconstruction and integration of our new lands. The people of the Urals have new hope for the future as the army parades through the streets of Sverdlovsk. The people do not want to live as they did under the chaos under the warlord era ever again. We cannot make the same mistakes of the West Siberian People's Republic made ten years ago. A trustworthy general like Rokossovsky must lead Russia, not a corrupt tyrant like Kaganovich or a madman like Yazov.\n\nA new generation must rise and take Russia onto a different path. Modernizations and reforms will be needed, and we will need powerful leadership to gather strength for the wars to come. But now, we can celebrate our victory and a new path for Russia.

The flags of the old Union and the District hung, one from each side. The audience was divided into two sections, one for the guests - mostly military personnel - and one for the recipients.\n\nSitting in the recipient section, Kiril was a statue - just like every other soldier who was being promoted. On the inside, though, he felt like he was going to throw up. He could handle getting his commission. Junior Lieutenant Kiril Yablonsky sounded wonderful to him. But the thought of finally meeting Marshal Rokossovsky face to face, for all of Sverdlovsk to see, made his stomach turn. He didn't know why.\n\nKiril was so deep in thought he almost didn't hear his name being called. He smoothed out his uniform and tried not to shake too much as he walked onstage. Rokossovsky stood behind a podium, with Generals Batov and Bagramyan by his side. He smiled as Kiril shook his hand, then pinned the medal to Kiril's chest and handed him his epaulettes - gold, with one star and a single red line down the middle. Kiril saluted, as did Rokossovsky, and spoke without thinking: "Thank you, Marshal."\n\n"Thank you for your service, comrade," he replied. "Your heroism brought you here. It's the least I could do." He turned back to the audience and congratulated the newly-commissioned officers. The room erupted into a round of applause and Kiril thought about all of the pain and torment he'd endured during his time with the 3rd Army. For a long, shimmering moment, it was all worth it."

 SVR.37.t: "Work in the Shadows"
 SVR.37.desc: "Arkady Fabrichnikov's office was on the third floor of what he assumed had been an apartment building. It had been expropriated by the 3rd Army and made the headquarters of the Internal Security Bureau - the agency he was now the leader of. One of the peculiarities of this building was that his office was the only one on the entire third floor. That's how he knew the posters were a sign.\n\nThey were greasy with ink and wheatpaste, and they all said the same thing in thick black letters: "THE BLACK LEAGUE: THE REBIRTH OF RUSSIA." It didn't take him long to clear them off his door, but at the same time he felt like he was being watched.\n\nInside, he hung up his trench coat and papakha and sat behind his desk, cracking open the file the military had compiled of "seditious activity." It was thicker than his wrist, stuffed with AARs, autopsy reports, eyewitness interviews, samples of revisionist and League propaganda, photographs of graffiti. Enemy agents were crawling all over the place, it seemed. Hell, they were even in -\n\nHe heard a metal click from down the hall. Footsteps, rapid and purposeful. He tore open one of the drawers of his desk and pulled out his Tokarev just as the door swung open. His would-be assassin jumped back in fright. "Christ, it's just me!" Erik, one of his assistants, said. Arkady sighed in relief and lowered his gun. Erik put his ornate steel lighter in his pocket and took a drag of his cigarette. "Kolya and I were going to get some drinks, do you want to come?" Arkady thought for a second, his eyes downcast at the file splayed out in front of him."

 SVR.38.t: "A Difference of Opinion"
 SVR.38.desc: ""Konstantin Konstantinovich, you may be good at what you do, but my friend, have you been wearing fucking blinders?!"\n\nRokossovsky glared at Batov and retorted "I could say the same. Our children's toys consist of shrapnel and wiring. Just yesterday, I saw a man mugged only inches from our headquarters!"\n\n"Yes, the Invader has pushed Russia into senseless violence, and this will be fixed with more violence? Tell me, what separates the state employed thugs from the regular ones?"\n\n"Duty, for one. How naive must one be to attack the very men who keep him breathing. Enforcement is the only thing standing between civilization and anarchy. Armed men, serving a higher purpose. You cannot reason with a bear as it charges you, it is simply fight or die!"\n\nBatov chuckled, both at the metaphor and Rokossovsky's juvenile grandstanding. The man seemed convinced he was the sole guardian of civilization against ravenous hordes. Batov prepared his retort, a self assured grin crossing his lips. However, before he could dispense it, he froze with alarm, noticing a change.\n\nRokossovsky had gone pale again, and a terrible coughing fit gripped his body, shaking the general with its force. When it finally reached its end, Batov pressed forwards a glass of water, but Rokossovsky flippantly rejected him."

 SVR.40.t: "On the Siberian Black League"
 SVR.40.desc: "The Siberian Black League is a terrorist organization based in Omsk. It was founded by the late Dmitry Mikhaylovich Karbyshev and is currently led by Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov. The inherently totalitarian and antisocial nature of the League makes any descriptive statements about them difficult to provide. However, one thing is clear. The Black League seeks to reunite Russia under their banner for the sole purpose of inflicting a terrible, costly revenge upon Germany and the German people.\n\nThe League is already upon us, albeit in a limited manner. Countless infiltrators have wormed their way into our factories, our offices, and even our military. Their goal is simple: bring about the absorption of Sverdlovsk into Omsk. To this end, they have employed both the sword and the pen. League sympathizers plant bombs, plan and attempt assassinations of high-ranking political figures, and attack our agriculture. They also spread propaganda capitalizing on the general anti-German sentiment in our citizens and promote the lie that the League will restore Russia to greatness and create a "pre-war" standard of living for all.\n\nGiven the danger the League poses to all of Russia, suspected infiltrators and sympathizers are given no quarter. Those suspected of possessing or spreading propaganda are arrested immediately and "encouraged" to cooperate with state officials. Infiltrators are treated similarly, with the exception that if they attempt to evade arrest they will be fired upon. The same goes for sympathizers in the military. While these measures may seem draconian, some generals suspect they may not even be enough to root out the festering corruption."

 SVR.41.t: "On Kaganovichite Revisionist Socialists"
 SVR.41.desc: "A revisionist socialist is a man or woman who owes allegiance to Lazar Kaganovich and advocates for a form of authoritarian socialism that differs from the mainstream Bukharinite strand. The severity of the threat revisionist terrorism poses to our regime cannot be understated.\n\nTheir goals are twofold: undermine our military's ability to give battle and turn the population against us. To accomplish the first goal, revisionist formations assemble during border skirmishes to attack our forces from behind, raid warehouses, and damage military infrastructure. To accomplish the second goal, revisionists spread manipulative, falsified propaganda to ferment a popular uprising.\n\nKnowing the threat revisionist agents pose to our government, it is imperative that we fight them wherever they may appear. The ISB has recently reported the arrest of several major revisionist terrorists, most of them directly employed by Kaganovich himself. These agents were no doubt part of a larger network, and with the leadership in custody, the ISB plans to hunt down and capture the less important members before they can regroup."

Any minor cells that have been catalogued and will be wiped out posthaste. He also reports that efforts to separate and deradicalize suspected sympathizers in the military have borne fruit and played a major role in locating major hideouts and preventing several terrorist attacks.\n\nThe black taint has been purged from Sverdlovsk, but we must remain vigilant. With their network in shambles and their contacts either imprisoned or dead, the people of Sverdlovsk can breathe easy knowing that there are no Black League agents among them. Now, we fix our eyes to the east, where the final confrontation with Omsk awaits."

 SVR.43.t: "Revisionist Influence Annihilated!"
 SVR.43.desc: "Owing to the tireless efforts of the ISB, Fabrichnikov has reported that revisionist influence within our territory has reached an absolute nadir. He attributes our success to three factors: education about the tyranny inherent to Kaganovichite and Stalinist thought, the relatively high standard of living, and our efforts to encourage the population to remain optimistic and steadfast. Working in conjunction, these factors have made Kaganovich's theories unappealing to the average civilian, he claims.\n\nWe have successfully beaten back the claws closing around us, but the beast still remains. Now that there is no risk of an uprising or attempted "revolution," we can dedicate more time and resources to bringing down Kaganovich's regime and truly freeing the people of Russia."

Boris Yeltsin, Yevgeny Primakov, and Alexander Tizyakov seated themselves in a booth, ordered their drinks, and got to talking.\n\n"We have to be bolder," Boris said. "I've been to the protests. There are thousands of people in this city alone who believe change is possible, that democracy is possible. We have to spread the word that this government does not represent them. True liberty gives the people ballots, not bullets. And to do that, we need to push more newspapers and hold more rallies."\n\nBoth of his associates stumbled over one another trying to respond first. "Two of my guys were jailed last week for 'distributing provocative literature,'" Yevgeny said. "If we start promoting what is effectively treason, they might shut us down for good. And that means I'll go to prison, too!"\n\n"Think about our expenses, Borya," Alexander said. "Newspapers and fliers are expensive. Rallies are even more expensive. We can't keep pulling money from my contacts without Rokossovsky noticing. Then he follows the paper trail and we - "\n\n"I get it, I get it!" Boris said, waving his arms to dispel the conversation as if it were cigarette smoke. "Of course we have to be careful. But we have to push the envelope, here. We have a real shot at building democracy in Russia; we can't squander it." The waiter arrived with their drinks shortly after. Boris raised his small glass of whiskey and smirked at his co-conspirators."

A stray gust of wind filled the curtains. She pushed past them and stuck her head out of the window.\n\nHer senses burst with detail. A large crowd squirmed around the Sverdlov statue on the street below, spilling over onto the road. The voice belonged to a middle-aged man standing on a small wooden platform in the centre of the crowd. Between the mumbling of the crowd, the honking of horns, and the hiss of the water on the stove, she couldn't make out every word of what the man was saying. But she heard his voice. He was emphatic. Booming. Passionate. He spoke of liberty and how Rokossovsky had robbed them of it. He paused and the crowd cheered. She did, too. Democracy - what an incredible idea!\n\nTwo black trucks screeched to a halt in the roundabout, their blue and white lights flashing. The back doors opened and black-clad figures poured out. Nadia's insides twisted. Her fingers gripped the sil. A second voice cut in, amplified by a loudspeaker. It snarled, demanding that the crowd disperse. Their responses - calling him a fascist, a tyrant, a Hitlerite - drowned out his demands. The middle-aged man was gone. A few of the black figures lobbed smoking canisters into the crowd. The front of the crowd recoiled backwards. Gunshots. The men in black surged forward. Screaming.\n\nNadia stepped back from the window. She was shaking. Her hand struck the side of the pot and it slid off the stove, spilling boiling water into her leg and clattering on the floor. She cried out. A string of profanities slipped through her teeth as a wave of pain swept over her, making her dizzy. The unmistakable sounds of truncheons on flesh - interspersed with gunshots - filled the street below, the sounds of life ebbing."

Incidents of vandalism, sabotage, and even physical confrontations with police or military personnel have been reported all across our nation. However, most of these incidents have occurred in Sverdlovsk itself, which should be no surprise.\n\nThe most probable cause of this wave of unrest is the recent 46 Prospekt Lenina Incident, which led to the deaths of six and injured ten others. Details are spotty at best, but all reports suggest it began in the morning, when a mob of civilians assembled unlawfully to listen to a speech from a political fugitive whose identity has yet to be determined. The local garrison responded approximately half an hour later. They announced the assembly was illegal and ordered the mob to disperse. The mob reportedly responded by throwing bricks. When tear gas was deployed to prevent any further violence or property damage, they attacked soldiers with chains and steel pipes. The would-be riot ended when the garrison opened fire despite having no explicit orders to do so.\n\nMarshal Rokossovsky and the High Command have debated how best to respond to this tragedy. Some generals believe that the soldiers involved in the incident should be arrested. Quick and public arrests are what the public wants and would put an end to any thoughts of rebellion. Plus, those men fired on civilians. Their arrest is a matter of morality. However, other members of the High Command argue that the soldiers were acting in self-defence; the rioters were the ones who instigated the violence. Arresting the soldiers would make the government look inept and severely damage morale. In the end, Rokossovsky has the final word."

 SVR.47.t: "Fall of the Black League"
 SVR.47.desc: "Critically important news has been received from Omsk. Multiple sources have confirmed that there appears to be a violent internal schism underway within the Siberian Black League following the recent passing of its founder, General Dmitry Karbyshev.\n\nIdentified as occurring between various officer cliques, the schism has resulted in the reported deaths of many senior officials, most prominent among them Dmitry Yazov, Karbyshev's identified successor. Considered by the Internal Security Bureau (ISB) to be an exceptionally dangerous radical, he was seen as certain to promote both aggressive expansion and increased sabotage operations against our forces, and his death would be expected to fatally weaken the League's overall integrity.\n\nIf the reports are true, this is an exceptionally fortunate turn of events for the District. Without the existence of centralized authority in Omsk, it is extremely unlikely that the ever-concerning influence of the League within our military and civilian society could be expanded, or even maintained at current levels. Indeed, the ISB reports that several League infiltrators and saboteurs have already been identified as a result of unsecured and irregular contact from various factions within the schism, and expects many more to be so identified and apprehended in coming days.\n\nIn addition, although the League as a whole retains nominal control of their territory, it is almost certain that they no longer possess the capability for offensive operations. They can therefore be dealt with at our, or anyone else's, leisure.\n\nIt would seem that a significant victory has been won without firing a shot. Or, at least, without us firing it."

Both the revisionists and the Black League had made any such pause difficult.\n\nBut with both groups scattered and the District's control over Western Siberia consolidated, they could do so once again. And so they did, sharing a meal and speaking Armenian all the while. As both of them had expected, talk quickly turned to that of their old home, now long lost under occupation.\n\nBabadzhanian spoke at length of his native village of Chardakhli, itself just within the Azeri lands and lying within the Reichskommissariat's territory. Bagramyan listened with interest as, though he himself had been born in Yelizavetpol, his parents were from the village as well, and he had heard many stories of it.\n\nAs time passed, however, the conversation progressed from the past to the present, and both men expressed their sadness both at Chardakhli's occupation and at the knowledge that they may never again possess the chance to see it.\n\nHowever, Bagramyan reminded his colleague, the District had established for itself a strong base in Siberia and, if appropriate strategies were vigorously pursued, could progress to reunite all of Russia. If that happened, the Caucasus could be reclaimed, and Chardakhli travelled to once again.\n\nAt that thought, Babadzhanian smiled. He informed Bagramyan that he would, if that day ever came, be honoured to invite him to his old house, and share a similar meal.\n\nThey shook on that and parted, both as Armenians, and as friends."

Even when all hope seemed lost during the long, brutal years of German terror bombing, he never stopped trying to save every life he could. And when the bombing ended, he led Sverdlovsk through its most turbulent years yet, leading the 3rd Army to victory against the armies of Kaganovich and Yazov.\n\nHis successor is his close friend and personal aide General Pavel Batov, whose claim to the mantle of leadership is contested by none.

However, after hours of marching, the most they could find in the ruined concrete building were discarded pieces of trash, rubble, and other miscellaneous refuse. Chernyshevsky began to open his mouth to give the order to return home when a voice called out from the back of the building.\n\n"I think there's something here, sir!" It was Private Solovyov, who recently enlisted in the unit. He was staring at a piece of wood near the top of the wall, before beginning to pull away the pile of rubble covering it. More men joined him until the pile was removed, and standing before them was a door. Cautiously opening it, they crept down the stairway behind it until they found themselves in a musty cellar. As another private shone a light at the walls, the soldiers stood silent in awe of what they found.\n\nEntire shelves of submachine guns, old rifles, and carbines. Boxes of pistols and ammunition.

Markov picked up an old PPS-41 from it, his jaw dropping. The smooth, dry stock of the gun and the gleaming metal barrel could have been made yesterday. He looked at the mechanism. It looked like it had just been brought out of the factory.\n\n"Let me test it out. Do you have any ammo, Lieutenant?"\n\n"Yes, Captain, let me check," the Lieutenant answered, gazing into the crate before finding a box stock, and he handed it to Markov, who took some bullets from his ammo pouch, loaded the gun, and pulled the trigger. It roared to life, firing the bullets within seconds high into the air. That was a good enough test for him. Setting the gun down, he extended a hand to Lieutenant Popov."

According to HQ, this old building used to be an armoury, and it was the task of him and the rest of the Logistic Platoon to scour the building for any provisions that could be of any use to the army.\n\nThe soldier finished pulling off the lid. He and another comrade lifted it off and looked inside, pulling out a pair of dusty khaki jackets. Pre-war, obviously, and smelling a little musty, but in good condition. Smirnov wrapped the one he took around himself. Quite warm, too. Whoever sealed these uniform in knew what he was doing.\n\n"FOOD!" A voice from the other squad came ringing out in the darkness of the armoury. Smirnov and the rest of the squad ran across the storeroom floor, their boots pounding on the concrete floor as they made their way to the voice.

What a shame that not only were these imported American weapons from the war, but that the boxes of ammunition they found were all rusted.\n\nHe walked towards the truck until he found a man with a gunsmith's insignia on his uniform, and began to speak.\n\n"How long will it take to rechamber one of these guns for our Tokarev rounds?"\n\n"We'd have to get more rechamberers from Sverdlovsk," the gunsmith said, "But once we receive them it should be a relatively easy task."\n\nSmirnov looked at the road once more.

Much to their disappointment, most of them like the first plane were rusted beyond repair, their internal parts perhaps being useful for scrap.\n\nThat's when they found the old Ilyushin Il-2 attack plane. Like its sisters, much of the paint had worn away over the years. But the cockpit looked okay, and the other external parts, though obviously out of maintenance, seemed more functional. There was only one way to test the plane.\n\n"You were the one in the air force, comrade," Sergeant Ibragimov said, facing Krupin. The private nodded, opened the cockpit and entered the plane. The controls looked a little worn, but still functional. Performing the startup sequence from memory, his face grew into a grin and his comrades began to cheer. After years of dormancy, the old plane's engine sputtered to life once again."

The chatter was quieter, and there seemed to be fewer familiar faces in the now smaller crowd.\n\n"I think they took him the other day."\n\nKuznetsov paused for a second as the implications of what Rogov.\n\n"Oh... can you maybe ask Agapov if he has a cigarette, then?"\n\n"They took him too. It was this morning."\n\n"Ivanov, Barbarin...?"\n\n"Them too."\n\nThe two soldiers paused once more. The silence of the canteen was now deafening, and it seemed impossible to speak as the implications of Rogov's works became obvious. Kuznetsov tried gesturing to his comrade for a cigarette, but it seemed so trivial compared to the sullenness about them, and the solitude they found themselves in."
 SVR.123.a: "Such is the price of revisionism."

 SVR.124.t: "Rise in Protests"
 SVR.124.desc: "Yevgeny Nikitovich Bocharov's stomach hurt, and the sign he held, painted with the phrase "NO FOOD = NO WORK" felt heavy in his hand. Behind him was the steel plant where he worked, which hadn't been open in a week thanks to the ongoing strike. But nevertheless, he refused to put it down, and continued to shout slogans with his fellow workers until his voice was hoarse. As he continued the protest, he noticed a friend of his, Andrey Sobakin, approach him.\n\n"Hey, Nikitovich? I know I haven't been at the protests much lately, but I've been thinking, and I realised something: the brass is never going to give us our food back."\n\n"So what do we do, then? Pack up and go home?" asked Bocharov.\n\n"No, Nikitovich," Sobakin replied, "we need to do more than just protest the shortages. Do you know what Stalin believed? He believed the state should be ruled by the workers' party, not by the goddamn army. Do you really think a bunch of officers would really just give food to us workers and not their own so easily?"\n\n"... Can you tell me more about Stalin, Andryushka?""
 SVR.124.a: "Give in on demands."
 SVR.124.b: "Crack down on the protest."

 SVR.125.t: "A Bridge Too Far"
 SVR.125.desc: ""Sergeant Nikolaev, I see the revisionists," said Private Kravtsov "They've gathered in the green outside the factory."\n\nNikoaev turned the radio on.\n\n"HQ, this is T-34 4830-B. We have acquired sights on targets."\n\n"Excellent work. Commence machine gun fire, and escalate to autocannon fire as required. Do not damage infrastructure. I repeat, do not damage infrastructure."\n\nAndrey Sobakin's heart skipped a beat when he first heard the machine gun fire up the streets and the screams of his fellow protestors. Frozen in terror, he watched as the 3rd Army's T-34s drove down the street, meting out death to the workers with merciless efficiency.\n\nHowever, he refused to run. The sweat running down his face, as the crowd dispersed, he saw Bocharov on the ground, bleeding but still alive. He tried to pick him up on the way when he heard the rumble of a T-34 behind him. The two workers' eyes widened as they saw the barrel of the tank staring down at them. Realising this was their final moment, the two uttered a single syllable concurrently."
 SVR.125.a: ""No.""

 SVR.126.t: "Sign of the Times"
 SVR.126.desc: ""I like your soup, mommy!" Denis Artyomov said as he dipped his sandwich into the vegetable soup his mother prepared for him. His two siblings, Yekaterina and Oleg nodded their heads in agreement as they did the same.\n\n"You do? It's because mommy made your food with love," his mother, Galina Artyomova said, smiling as she heard his words. It was a long time since she was able to make them a lunch like this, even if soup and sandwiches were simple to make. But ever since the end of the strikes, the government agreed to increase civilian rations again, giving her the opportunity to make more than just the meager scraps she had been making them.\n\n"Can I have some dessert when I'm done, mommy?" Yekaterina asked.\n\n"Of course, Katya, what would you like?"\n\n"Can I have some ice cream?" The other children agreed with Yekaterina's suggestion.\n\nDessert, Galina thought to herself. That was something else she had almost forgotten about.\n\n"Of course you can, hon. Let's go to the ice cream store after lunch.""
 SVR.126.a: "Civilian life has become better."

 SVR.127.t: "A Soldier's Lot"
 SVR.127.desc: ""Comrade Artyomov, what's wrong with your boots?" barked Sergeant Pavlov.\n\n"What, comrade?" Private Kiril Artyomov responded.\n\n"They aren't shined properly. They look like you've been stepping in shit."\n\n"Oh, uh, I'm sorry."\n\n"You'd better be sorry at the end of the afternoon. Run 5 laps around the square when you're done."\n\nAfter inspection, Artyomov did the extra laps as required. It was difficult to run after the rations were cut once again, after the 5th lap he simply collapsed on the ground, exhausted and in pain. That evening as they did drills, Artyomov lagged behind in the training exercises, nearly falling off the fence they were supposed to climb. As punishment, he was withheld dinner.\n\nAs once again entered the barracks room as night fell, exhausted and starving, he wondered what exactly he did to deserve the day of hardship when the door opened, and one of his comrades entered the room.\n\nThe next morning he received a care package, apparently delayed by a day. He stared with disbelief as he opened it and stared at the contents: a can of vegetables and some meat from his wife."
 SVR.127.a: "The circle has returned to its starting point."

 SVR.128.t: "Another Batch"
 SVR.128.desc: "Vyacheslav Yakovlev saw the two men in tattered uniforms approach him from the wheat fields that afternoon. The old man stopped his tilling and immediately approached them.\n\n"Hello," said the first tattered man, "I am Gennady Kuznetsov, and this is my comrade Yevgeny Rogov. We're..."\n\n"On a top secret mission to Tyumen?" Yakovlev asked. The two soldiers looked at each other, "If you need shelter, I've got a spare bedroom upstairs. Come on."\n\nThat evening, Yakovlev and the two soldiers sat down for dinner. The soldiers exchanged some of their rations to Yakovlev, and he was able to make some hearty pierogies for them.\n\n"So, heading to Tyumen, eh? I suggest taking a right at the next nearest intersection, and following the road till you get to the closest town 'cross the border. You can head out early next morning and walk all day there, or you could head out noon and camp by the lake."\n\n"Thank you, comrade. We'll stay tonight and leave the next morning," Rogov said, "By the way, how do you know so much about us and our mission?"\n\nYakovlev smiled.\n\n"Let's just say I've known some of your friends for quite a bit now.""
 SVR.128.a: "Here we go again..."

 SVR.129.t: "Loyalty"
 SVR.129.desc: "Private Kirill Zadachin shot a couple of nervous glances around the old school gym where he and the rest of the 39th Rifles Battalion were standing as they waited for the commissar to discuss the results of their compulsory loyalty tests. Two months ago almost his entire squad was found to be insufficiently loyal and his comrades were never seen again, and last month they took away his remaining friends from his village in the different platoon. What if he was named as disloyal, he thought.\n\nCommissar Vorobyev marched into the room in full dress uniform, his smile like a wolf who found himself in a pen of sheep. Zadachin closed his eyes, but, nothing could have prepared him for what Vorobyev would say next.\n\n"Congratulations."\n\nThe entire company, including Zadachin, who opened his eyes, stared at the commissar in disbelief.\n\n"Comrades, not only are there no disloyal members in this unit, HQ has name you to be the most loyal in the entire army. In honour of your reliability, this unit will now be known as the 15th Guards Rifles Battalion! The ceremony where your new standard will be presented is next Wednesday.""
 SVR.129.a: "The price of loyalty is high, but the rewards are even higher."

 SVR.130.t: "Victories in the Silent War"
 SVR.130.desc: "The Internal Security Bureau is at war, and this war has presented them with a unique challenge. The enemy combatants wear no uniforms, bear no armbands or symbols on their persons. They do not wield rifles and knives against us; their weapons of choice are books, pamphlets, and propaganda. In this war, battles are fought and won in the minds of our soldiers, not on the battlefield.\n\nThanks to the tireless work of the brave sons of Sverdlovsk in the ISB, our efforts in combating the Black League insurgency plaguing our nation have borne fruit. Operatives were able to successfully infiltrate several cells, giving us the upper hand in disrupting their propaganda campaigns and hunting them down. With the capture of the League members leading those cells and the arrests of countless sympathizers, Omsk's sway over our nation has been crippled."
 SVR.130.a: "We shall not rest until the rest of their black blight has been purged from our lands!"

 SVR.131.t: "Victories Against the Revisionists!"

They do not wield rifles and knives against us; their weapons of choice are books, pamphlets, and propaganda. In this war, battles are fought and won in the minds of our soldiers, not on the battlefield.\n\nThanks to the tireless work of the brave sons of Sverdlovsk in the ISB, our efforts in combating the persisting revisionist influence have been wildly successful. The seditious Kaganovichite elements operating within our borders view the general populace as sympathetic to their cause, which gave our operatives the perfect opportunity to infiltrate their organizations. Our men on the inside clandestinely leaked us information that allowed us to thwart the revisionists' attempts to raid army stockpiles and disseminate pro-revisionist literature. And, once the main bases of these cells were pinpointed, they were struck from the map with practiced, machine-like efficiency. Revisionist influence has taken a serious blow and it is unlikely that they will be able to recover."
 SVR.131.a: "Tyrants have no place in Sverdlovsk - or Russia, for that matter!"

 SVR.132.t: "Deserters from Sverdlovsk"
 SVR.132.desc: "Early this morning, clad in the crushing veil of the Siberian night, a small group of people snuck through the fortifications along our northern frontier and crossed the border, where they were quickly apprehended by our military patrols. The group was mostly men, though there were several women and children with them. They claim to have deserted from Rokossovsky's petty little junta and seek refuge in Tyumen, the current torchbearer of the international socialist revolution.\n\nThis unusual crowd seems surprisingly educated on our socialist ideals, despite coming from the reactionary state of Sverdlovsk. They may also have valuable information we could use against them. However, some of their language is ripped straight from Marx and Stalin's writings, almost to the letter. It's entirely possible these men and women are spies who have been sent to destabilize our government. What shall be done with them?"
 SVR.132.a: "Solidarity! Let them in."
 SVR.132.b: "Have them detained and interrogated."
 
 SVR.140.t: "Black League Influence Too Low"
 SVR.140.desc: "Black League infiltrators and sympathizers have plagued our nation for years, undermining the stability of our government and sowing the seeds for our defeat in the inexorable war with Omsk. We only started gaining ground on them recently, with the formation of the Internal Security Bureau, but many feared that our best efforts would not be enough. Now, the war has finally begun and the infiltrators have played their hand.\n\nThe tireless vigilance of the ISB has decimated the influence of the Black League within our territory. Incidents of sabotage or terrorism are sporadic and rare. Few involve more than five insurgents and even fewer cause meaningful or even noticeable harm to our war effort. With the streets free of terrorists, we can focus all our efforts on defeating Yazov once and for all."
 SVR.140.a: "Our enemy lies on the other side of a bayonet."

We only started gaining ground on them recently, with the formation of the Internal Security Bureau, but many feared that our best efforts would not be enough. Now, the war has finally begun and the infiltrators have played their hand.\n\nDespite the great damage we have caused to their network, the ISB was unable to completely crush the network of Black League infiltrators. Enemy agents have been riling up the population against the war effort, resulting in small protests and pro-League vandalism. They have also sabotaged factories and communication lines, sometimes significantly. Regardless, they have failed to cripple our war effort and the ISB will mop up these treasonous elements soon enough."

We only started gaining ground on them recently, with the formation of the Internal Security Bureau, but many feared that our best efforts would not be enough. Now, the war has finally begun and those doubts may have been justified.\n\nCells of fifty or more men have been assaulting military stockpiles and looting anything that isn't bolted down. The urban areas are rife with infiltrators and violence. Men dressed in homemade League uniforms walk into city squares and open fire with stolen military equipment. The wind kicks up storms of loose League propaganda fliers. Alleys all across the capital are smothered under posters promising revenge against the German menace. This is beyond the ISB's capabilities to handle; military units must be called off the front lines to deal with these terrorists at once!"

Their nightmare has become our reality.\n\nGangs of Black League enforcers run the streets, indiscriminately gunning down "traitors." Cells of upwards of five-hundred men swarm military bases and warehouses and loot anything not bolted down. Officers on the frontline have been assaulted or even bayoneted in their sleep by League sympathizers. Entire arms plants have been brought down by coordinated IED attacks, killing everyone inside and destroying the stockpile. There are even scattershot reports of open uprisings by Black League cells! Drastic measures are needed to combat these terrorists or else our war effort is at risk of collapsing!"
 SVR.143.a: "The black hand reaches for us..."

 SVR.144.t: "Low Tyumen Agitation"
 SVR.144.desc: "With our ongoing war with Tyumen, we have noticed some instances of sabotage and partisan activity. While minor, it is still affecting our supply lines and war effort somewhat. We believe this is caused by Tyumen agitators and sympathizers. Thankfully, the saboteurs are very much isolated and we believe they don't have many ways to contact our enemy in Tyumen. Our situation could definitely be worse though.\n\nOur garrisons have already been mobilized to contain the threat, but tracking them down will not be an easy task. They no doubt have many hideouts and finding these won't be easy. Our troops will have to be careful not to get ambushed. But as there aren't too many of these partisans, we have been assured by our garrisons that it won't take long to root them out. They shouldn't be too much of a problem, but we can't risk a long war in case this resistance becomes much more severe. Still, we should probably move quickly to make sure the communist threat of Tyumen doesn't last long."
 SVR.144.a: "Hopefully our efforts to contain these partisans will be enough."

 SVR.145.t: "Tyumen Sabotage!"
 SVR.145.desc: "There have been multiple reports of partisans causing trouble in the interior of our country. Tyumen sympathizers have been damaging infrastructure and cutting off supply lines. Our army fighting on the front lines have informed us that they are not getting much-needed supplies from the capital. While we have contained the creation of a general uprising, they still have caused a lot of trouble for our military. We also believe Tyumen has contacts within this resistance, and they may be attempting to spread pro-Tyumen propaganda to our workers. We cannot let this go on any longer.\n\nOur garrisons have already encountered these troublemakers but they are definitely putting up a fight. So far we have had trouble containing them to limited areas far away from our population centers and supply storages. Our garrisons report that while they have stopped the situation from escalating, it will be a tough fight to defeat all of the partisans. We need to defeat Tyumen quickly before the situation can spiral out of control. We can't let this war become a long one."
 SVR.145.a: "We must prepare an offensive to stop this war!"

 SVR.146.t: "Agitation from Tyumen!"
 SVR.146.desc: "With our current war to defeat the revolutionary menace, we thought we would have all the support of the people, but it appears this is not true. Workers have been striking all throughout Sverdlovsk and grinding production to a halt. We believe this is directly caused by Tyumen Partisans. These terrorists have also been assaulting garrisons and causing chaos and disorder. The garrisons are so paranoid, every noise heard outside their barracks are met by a hail of gunfire. Our soldiers are running out of supplies and ammunition as we speak.\n\nWith our garrisons mostly trapped these partisans have had free reign to destroy supply shipments and railroads. We may have to think about sending some of our troops on the frontline into the countryside to deal with this threat. Something must be done to bring back order so we can continue fighting. All we can do is hope that Tyumen isn't able to take advantage of our bad situation."
 SVR.146.a: "Something must be done!"

 SVR.147.t: "Armed Workers Rising Up!"
 SVR.147.desc: "This is a disaster! With our current war with Tyumen ongoing, multiple partisan units who support Tyumen have risen up. It appears we underestimated the strength of the Tyumen activity in Sverdlovsk. They have gained the sympathy of many more workers in the factories and soldiers in the army than we previously thought. There is now large scale partisan activity throughout Sverdlovsk and there is nothing our garrisons can do to stop it. Our war effort has ground to a halt and the countryside plunges into disorder.\n\nWe barely have a solution to deal with the situation as many of our garrisons have been slaughtered in surprise attacks. There are even reports of frontline soldiers being harassed by partisans. Our entire military could be cut off from the capital! We have to defeat these partisans before it's too late!"

In a panic she jumped out of bed and practically threw herself to her dresser, collecting the clothes she would wear today. A glance at the clock had her in shock all on its own, it was almost noon! She had never been able to sleep in so late before, the bombs had been her alarm since she was a young girl.\n\nThat thought brought Sasha to a halt. In her panic at sleeping in she hadn't noticed the strange silence that existed in the city. With caution she opened her window and looked out into the sky. Nothing. The usual rumble of the German bombers was absent, instead the skies were clear of any noise. Of course, she expected the bombers to return later in the day, but for now she would enjoy the peace, at least once she got to work.\n\nThe hours stretched by and still the bombers did not come. In the evening, Sasha was able to enjoy her walk back to her apartment, the cool Siberian air soothing the aches that she accrued in the factory. Sasha ate a lonely dinner and listened to the official radio broadcasts report that all across Sverdlovsk territory the skies were quiet. The reports say that, for the first time in years, the Free Aviators had no reason to leave their runways.\n\nAt last, as Sasha laid down for bed, she reached over and set her alarm on the old clock for the first time in her life."

 SVR.151.t: "The Aviators over the Military District"
 SVR.151.desc: "The anti-aircraft gunners stationed on the hill outside Sverdlovsk prepared their battery for action. Scouts stationed on the western side of the city had reported an incoming German bomber formation, and they intended to be ready.\n\nWith their outdated equipment, the gunners knew well that they were unlikely to actually impede the bombers in any appreciable fashion, or stop them from completing their mission of terror and death. But they knew equally well that they had to try. That they had to strike back against the hated German in any way possible and, in so doing, salve the despair currently endemic to the Russian consciousness.\n\nAs the formation came into view, large black ovoids far above, the lead gunner ranged them as best he was able and prepared to open fire. Just as he was about to, however, his sergeant grabbed his arm, and pointed to the sky. A swarm of smaller dots had emerged from the clouds, pouncing upon the bomber formation before it had had a chance to concentrate itself. Every Russian in the District knew what that meant, and prayed for it as much as they could, often to no avail. But this time they had been heard. And the Aviators had arrived.\n\nThe gunners knew that they should be firing nonetheless, as the Aviators were not integrated into District's command structure, but they did not. None would dare risk hitting one of the Aviators flying high above, and though it was technically a violation of orders, they knew that their officers would overlook it, for they felt the same as the gunners themselves. The same as any true Russian.\n\nAs several of the bombers began trailing smoke and flame, the gunners shared a cheer. A victory, miniscule as it might be, had been won. And the legend of the Aviators continued to grow."

 sverdreg.1.t: "The State of the District"
 sverdreg.1.desc: "Pavel Batov sat in his office chair, happy to finally get some peace and quiet. A lot had changed in the past few years, and he had seen himself jump from general all the way to becoming Marshal of the entire Ural Military District. With his new responsibilities came new challenges as well.\n\nThe unification of a region that had remained divided for a decade wouldn't be easy. Administrating a region five times larger than what was previously controlled by the military district proved to be a real challenge for the District's garrisons and Batov's rule. Yet that wasn't even half of what Batov had on his hands. Administrating was one thing, integrating areas controlled by different warlords with very different ideologies from ours was no easy feat, and Batov knew a lot of hard work had to be put in before West Siberia can truly appear unified. As well as the difficult political situation, Batov also faced the problems of a destroyed economy. West Siberia had been wrecked by the constant wars since the last decade. Large funds would need to be put into reconstruction so our economy can even compare to our rivals on our borders.\n\nAs well as all the problems of uniting West Siberia has brought to the table, the democratic movement led by Boris Yeltsin has also been gaining more and more support. The people will begin to favor a more democratic government as the region stabilizes, and elections may need to occur if Batov wants to move forward into a democratic government or legitimize his rule.\n\nLastly, the death of Marshal Rokossovsky has put a lot of pressure on Batov himself. He would have to work in the legacy of Rokossovsky to take control of West Siberia and strengthen the district enough to finally reclaim all of Russia. There was a lot Batov had to do if he wanted to be the second Great Marshal, but Batov had to start somewhere."

Since our army has gained control over the entire region of West Siberia, partisans and resistance fighters continue to harm our garrisons enforcing the law in these chaotic times. Order needs to be upheld, and the only way to carry it out is through military rule. That is why I am announcing that the army will continue their occupation of our newly regained territory, and martial law will continue to be in effect across the entire district until further notice."\n\n"I know many of you yearn for further freedoms, however our armed forces are the only ones who can keep you safe. Bandits and partisans will continue to be a threat until the military deals with them, and until they are dealt with the army will be the guardians of the people. I and every general in this district promise we will do everything we can to keep you and your family safe. All I ask is that you follow these orders completely."\n\n"Remember, the fate of Russia is in all of our hands. We are not the enemy, we do not wish to trample you under the boot of authoritarianism.

"Lazar Kaganovich, the results of your trial have been concluded. After deliberation, you are to be sentenced to execution for your betrayal of Russia and her people."\n\nExecution!?! Betrayal!?! Kaganovich was too angry to take it anymore! He was no traitor! Getting out of his chair and angrily pointing his wrinkled finger at the judge, he began in a tirade. "No, YOU are the traitors! You were in my military, you fought for socialism and the motherland! Now look at where you are! You are nothing but evil fascists and dirty capitalists! I should have purged Rokossovsky when I had the chance!"\n\n"SIT DOWN KAGANOVICH!" The judge shouted. "We have come upon our decision, and it is final! You are the only man to blame for leading West Siberia down this dark path. You were your own undoing."\n\n"You'll see," Kaganovich said bitterly. "The revolution will be achieved one way or another.

"Dmitry Yazov, my fellow judges and I have completed our deliberation and with a unanimous decision, you are to be sentenced to death. Your execution by firing squad will be tonight. Guards, get this worthless man out of my sight." The judge finished his last sentence quickly, not wanting to look at Yazov any longer.\n\n"Do you not want to hear my last words?" Yazov said, not caring he was going to be killed soon. After all, he had expected nothing else.\n\n"Fine, what nonsense do you have to say?" The judge asked, seeming not to care.\n\n"I just wanted to ask if you would be ready to face the coming ordeals." Yazov said, coldly. "You have eliminated your only chance at a victory, general. With the Black League destroyed, you have destroyed all of Russia's chances with it. Only I could have led Russia through the coming storm, through The Great Trial itself! Now Russia will see only failure and disunity. Do you really think a state with any semblance of democracy can stand united and strong against an enemy such as Germany?"\n\nThe judge paused for a moment after Yazov was done speaking, shaking his head. "No... no... you are the one who is wrong. Do you not see yourself as a murderer? A brute who has put a dark stain on Russia? If you were to lead our great nation, you would have destroyed it as well as Germany."\n\n"Perhaps," Yazov began to smile. "But Russia would finally have its revenge."\n\n"Take him away!" The judge ordered. And as the guards went to haul Yazov away one last time, he looked into Dmitry Yazov's dark eyes, and would never forget them for the rest of his life."

To Catherine, that meant everything.\n\nBack in the days of the Soviet Union when Catherine was just a young girl, she still lived in Sverdlovsk, free with no responsibilities. After the collapse though, life became hard. Working hours for just small portions of food for her children and ordered by the military what time she was allowed to leave her home, she could barely handle it.\n\nNow with the martial law over and the curfews ended, Catherine could finally live life to the fullest. She could even go outside at night and see the stars! While the military presence was still there, things had turned out for the better. Perhaps more freedoms still stood on the horizon."

Serving in the Tsar's army and in the civil war, Pyotr has lost his leg in battle, but some say he killed a hundred men before he was ever put out of action. He was also the best man to ask what the army was like, which was exactly what Martin was about to do. A young man, only eighteen years old, you would think Martin would know more about war. Martin wanted to join the fight, but he didn't want to be a regular soldier. He wanted to be a hero, just like Pyotr, killing the Germans and barbarians.\n\nThe old veteran spent most of his time in his rocking chair, watching the people pass by his old farmhouse. As Martin walked up, the veteran opened his eyes, saying in a scratchy yet punctual voice, "What do you want boy? I'm trying to catch a nap."\n\n"Pyotr, my name's Martin, I'm going to join the army. I want to know how to fight and kill, just like you."\n\nThe old man turned to look at him, "Well boy, here's step one. Don't. The army isn't for anyone like you. Go back home."\n\nThe boy stared, wide-eyed. "What do you mean, you were a soldier, a hero! People say you killed a hundred enemy soldiers! I'm strong enough to fight!"\n\n"It's not if you're strong enough, boy!" Shouted Pyotr. "If you want to be a hero, don't join the army. The only thing you become is a killer or dead. Trust me, if you want to be a hero, save people, don't kill them."\n\nMartin walked away, more confused than ever. Was Pyotr right, or was he just an angry old man? Were all soldiers really just killers?"
 sverdreg.6.a: "There are no heroes in war."
 
 sverdreg.7.t: "The Marshal and His Council"
 sverdreg.7.desc: "The meeting table lay empty as the generals of the Council sat quiet, waiting for the Marshal. A few minutes passed, and Marshal Batov entered the room, sitting down at the head of the table. "This will be a much different meeting," said the Marshal, making sure to face all the other generals. "Instead of worrying about our present issues, I would like to look into the future."\n\n"Our political situation has since changed when we first unified West Siberia," Batov said. "Remnants of our enemy governments in Tyumen and Omsk have been dealt with, and we have stabilized our control over all of the Urals. Things have calmed down all across the military district, and our rule seems to be secure. So with our political goals handled, what should we focus on next?"\n\nGeneral Aleksey Zhadov spoke first. "We need to prepare for war, our neighboring rivals will not wait for us to be ready before they strike. Our army size must be increased, our military production doubled, and our supply infrastructure prepared for any invasion. A lot of fighting will be necessary to reunite Russia, it's time we start now."\n\n"Thank you Aleksey," Marshal Batov said. "It is true, we must put a large amount of our focus towards reuniting Russia. Although, we cannot ignore the situation of our people. All of our efforts cannot be put into the military, our civilian economy must be made prosperous and poverty must be lowered before Russia can be unified. Until then, we will wait until our moment to strike. We will be prepared for when the time is right.""
 sverdreg.7.a: "A united Russia nears."
 
 sverdreg.8.t: "Preparing for Reconstruction"
 sverdreg.8.desc: "Our unification of West Siberia was costly, factories, roads, and railways were all heavily damaged or destroyed in the fighting. With our enemies dealt with and internal issues handled we can finally make preparations to rebuild.\n\nThe damage was not sparing, with cities destroyed and people starving. Our economy is in shambles, barely functioning and unemployment abound. Schools also lay abandoned with no funding for education. Bartering is rampant, with no real money circulating through the country.\n\nTo prepare for the rebuilding of the District, [SVR.GetLeader] has ordered for new construction jobs to begin all across West Siberia. Rebuilding the core of our cities will let us increase our reconstruction efforts even more. Hopefully, by the end, West Siberia will look radically different and we will be close to recovery."
 sverdreg.8.a: "Hopefully."
 
 sverdreg.9.t: "Oil in Surgut!"
 sverdreg.9.desc: "It has been a lucky day for Farman Salmanov, our economic minister. Doing geology work in Surgut today, he has come across an even larger oil deposit ever before found in that region! Oil is very precious to us, fueling our tanks and our trucks. With this much oil, however, we may also be able to use it for trade, gaining favorable deals with foreign powers.\n\nWe should now focus on building more storage facilities for all this oil, we do not want any going to waste. More efforts will also be required to extract all of the oil and fully take advantage of it. If we are successful, we won't need to worry about a fuel shortage ever again!"
 sverdreg.9.a: ""I found oil. That's it.""
 
 sverdreg.10.t: "Taking Stock"
 sverdreg.10.desc: "The quartermaster walked through the warehouse, going through all the confiscated equipment captured by enemy soldiers in the unification. Guns, artillery, and even tanks were now in his hands. These would be very useful in the Third Army, he mused.\n\nNow he moved onto the more damaged items. A tank, damaged by an anti-tank gun, but still repairable. A truck, now this one had taken a lot of damage. Bullet holes covered the outside, seemingly more bullets than truck. Checking the inside, stains of blood remained on the seats, forming red splotches. Perhaps this one would need a bit more work, he thought.\n\nThe fighting had been brutal, he had seen it with his own eyes. But now that it was over, he was left over to pick up the pieces. The thousands of pieces, recovering what could be recovered, trashing what could not. But with these old weapons of war, new wars would be fought. Hopefully with fewer bloodstains on the weapons. They were hard to remove."
 sverdreg.10.a: "The more guns the better."
 
 sverdreg.11.t: "Looking Up"
 sverdreg.11.desc: "With all of our efforts to improve the economy of the District, it seems they are finally paying off. The economy has seen tremendous growth, and West Siberia is becoming a place of more prosperity. Quality of life has also improved, with more housing and better jobs for the people. Schools have also been built to educate the masses. Best of all, more businesses are starting to pop up, taking advantage of the growing economy.\n\nWhile not just good for the people, this also helps us. With a better economy, our factories are starting to reopen, and new ones are even being built. It looks like the effects of industrialization are beginning to appear, and we are producing more goods than ever before.\n\nInfrastructure is also seeing an improvement, new roads have been built, electricity is being provided, and railroads are allowing the transportation of goods quickly and easily.\n\nA strong, modern economy is within reach, but to truly empower the Russian economy we must first unite Russia. Until then, we will lay the foundations for an economy that will rival the largest superpowers!"
 sverdreg.11.a: "Goodbye, poverty!"
 
 sverdreg.12.t: "The Obstacles of War"
 sverdreg.12.desc: "The men stood in a line, facing the obstacle course that lay ahead. All were fresh new recruits, ready to join the third army and defend the military district. The drill instructor looked at each one in the eye, seeing the same faces every time he trained a new batch of recruits. It seemed like just yesterday he had trained that poor runt Kiril, working him hard until he was finally promoted to a soldier. He never got to see him again, but Kutuzov felt he was trained well enough to have survived the wars.\n\nHe wasn't here to feel sorry for these boys though, he was here to train them! "Alright boys, listen here!" The instructor yelled, he was older, but his voice was still strong. "I know we have already met, but if any of you morons forgot my name already, my name is Sergeant Kutuzov. Today you will be drilling, not for speed, but for determination. This course is one of the most challenging in the District. Towering walls, barbed wire, and deep mud will all stop you from getting to the finish. But you will not give up. This training will not end until every one of you reaches the end."\n\nKutuzov continued to look every man in the eye, pacing in front of them, wanting to get his point across. "A soldier on the field doesn't just need speed, strength, or agility to win the fight. They need the determination to win. If a man isn't determined to beat the enemy, he will either lose or die. You must match your skills with determination to become victorious. Giving up is not an option in war these days. If you give up in the field, this district and everything we have fought for up to this point will have been for nothing. Do you understand?"\n\n"Yes, sir!" The men shouted in unison.\n\n"Well then what are you waiting for, GO!" The sergeant shouted, watching the boys run into the obstacle course, each bent on reaching the finish first."
 sverdreg.12.a: "Determination is half the battle."
 
 sverdreg.13.t: "Wars Past, Wars Present, Wars Future"
 sverdreg.13.desc: "Fiodor jogged along the path, always enjoying the fresh air and the warmth that came with exercise. Being a soldier in the Third Army was tough, training nearly sixteen hours a day. Fiodor dreamed of working in his fields, owning a farm, and getting away from all the deadly battles and strict officers. He wanted to work on his own schedule and be somewhere peaceful.\n\nFiodor thought back to when he was a young man and had just joined the Third Army. He had fought in many wars past, the collapse of the West Siberian People's Republic, fighting off bandits in the warlord era, and joining the campaign to reunify West Siberia.\n\nWas he just in it to fight, to see some action? The wars to come would be just as brutal, if not even more. What was stopping him from just leaving?\n\nThen he recalled one major thing he had learned in the army, the Third Army was always supposed to protect the people. If he gave up and decided to take up a life of farming, would he be giving up on the families he had sworn to protect?\n\nRussia seemed like it would still be embroiled in battles for decades to come. Enemies of the Third Army surrounded them, waiting to strike. Fiodor couldn't abandon the people. Russia needed him to continue the fight."
 sverdreg.13.a: "It was the job of the Third Army to protect the people."
 
 sverdreg.14.t: "Aviator Aces"
 sverdreg.14.desc: "The plane flew over the barren icy tundra, skillfully maneuvered by its pilot, picking up a draft over a lake. Yevdokia Bocharova had yet to see any German planes for years. Now the threat came from West Russia and Central Siberia. Although she hadn't seen much action yet, she was ready to defend West Siberia and the military district.\n\nThings were different now under the control of a central government once again. They were no longer free to do whatever they pleased, having to follow orders from the military on the ground. Things were just like the old days of the Soviet Union in a way.\n\nContinuing to fly her plane she veered down towards the Ural Mountains, checking to make sure no scout patrols from West Russia had crossed the border. Yevdokia didn't care who was in control down below, up in the skies her Free Aviators had a duty, and that was to protect Russia in the air."
 sverdreg.14.a: "Free Aviators forever!"
 
 sverdreg.15.t: "The Department of Foreign Affairs"
 sverdreg.15.desc: "With our unification of West Siberia, many foreign powers have become interested in our new nation. A place was needed to conduct relations with other powers, and [SVR.GetLeader] has announced today the construction of the Foreign Affairs Office in Sverdlovsk. Many nations outside the German sphere have taken a liking to a strong independent Russia, and many may be interested in providing us with limited aid and recognition. We also have many resources other nations may want, so the Foreign Affairs Office will also work in conducting trade.\n\nHowever, our rivals across the border are also interested in having relations with these foreign powers. We may have to compete for this aid, though we are confident in our abilities to establish functional relations with all those who hold an interest in us."
 sverdreg.15.a: "It is about time we made friends."
 
 sverdreg.16.t: "Contacts in West Siberia"
 sverdreg.16.desc: "We've been approached with an interesting proposition from the Foreign Office of Sverdlovsk in West Siberia. Being a government very similar to ours, they seem to wish for more open relations. Having a government in West Siberia that aligns with us may be very beneficial.\n\nThey have asked us to recognize them as the legitimate government of West Siberia. This is a major step in opening relations with them, and may anger their rival governments slightly, but will not damage our relations with any other Russian governments beyond repair that we may also hold interests in.\n\nWest Siberia has also requested trade relations. They have plenty of resources, oil especially, that could be very valuable to us. We also hold many things that could be valuable to them, so there is no reason not to agree."
 sverdreg.16.a: "Sounds like a good deal, tell them we said yes, let's see what we get."
 
 sverdreg.17.t: "Response from the USA"
 sverdreg.17.desc: "We have received a message from the Americans, and they have accepted our proposal! They have recognized our control over West Siberia and are open to trade relations, finally giving us a reliable partner to trade with. It has been a struggle to trade as we have limited access to the outside world and our neighbors are not exactly friendly towards trading with us. This should hopefully open up access to more resources for our military and civilian goods, as well as improving our standing with the Americans. Perhaps we could deepen our ties even more in the future?"
 sverdreg.17.a: "Thank you, America!"
 
 sverdreg.18.t: "A New Consulate"
 sverdreg.18.desc: "We have been approached by the Government of West Siberia once again, this time asking to establish a consulate in Washington. This would bring our countries even closer and would be a good way to improve relations between our two states, however this may show we are taking sides in Russia, and if we want to keep our neutral stance or show more interest in another government we may want to reject the consulate.\n\nStill, trade will be able to facilitate between our two nations even more than before, giving us access to larger amounts of oil and more influence in the region. Building a consulate would no doubt become very beneficial for us. Still, there will always be repercussions for getting too nice with the West Siberians."
 sverdreg.18.a: "Allow the West Siberians to establish a consulate."
 
 sverdreg.19.t: "Diplomatic Success!"
 sverdreg.19.desc: "We have good news, the Americans said yes to establishing a consulate! This brings our two nations even closer together and gives us even more options for diplomacy in the future. With an office in Washington, a firm connection has been created between us.\n\nThis consulate will also facilitate trade between our countries, giving the Americans more access to our resources and us more access to theirs. It seems this has been a very good deal for both of us, so hopefully our relationship will only continue to grow."
 sverdreg.19.a: "Time to move into Washington!"
 
 sverdreg.20.t: "Diplomatic Failure!"
 sverdreg.20.desc: "Bad news from the Americans, they have refused to establish our consulate. Their reply saying it went too far in terms of diplomatic relations and they wished to remain more neutral in Russian politics. While we do understand this reasoning, it still comes a blow to our government and diplomats who were expecting to deepen our relations with the Americans.\n\nStill, we have excellent trade relations, and it's not like our diplomacy is entirely closed off. The Americans will still continue to recognize our control over West Siberia and will continue to aid us in economic means. Surely this doesn't mean the Americans have found someone better than us, right?"
 sverdreg.20.a: "Why would they refuse?"
 
 sverdreg.21.t: "A Lucrative Offer"
 sverdreg.21.desc: "Trade has always been a challenge for us since the beginning of the unification. No easy ports to reach or neighbors willing to trade means a lot of effort has to be put into reaching simple trade deals that aren't always beneficial towards us. Costs have continued to rise for many important goods in both our civilian and military economies, and we are importing much more than what we are exporting.\n\nYevgeny Dragunov has seemed to notice our plight and is willing to use his connections to create more opportunities for us. Leader of the warlord state Zlatoust until joining our government, Dragunov was a prime businessman, trading weapons across the warlord wastelands. Using these connections Dragunov will be able to reach places near and far, and his charisma will be very useful for trade negotiations.\n\nDragunov has also generously offered to serve in our government in addition to using his contacts. A man like him could become a savvy minister in our leadership. What's not to trust?"
 sverdreg.21.a: "Take him up on his offer, but keep him away from our government."
 sverdreg.21.b: "Agree and offer him a position."
 
 sverdreg.22.t: "A Pardon and a Favor"
 sverdreg.22.desc: "Trade has always been a challenge for us since the beginning of the unification. No easy ports to reach or neighbors willing to trade means a lot of effort has to be put into reaching simple trade deals that aren't always beneficial towards us. Costs have continued to rise for many important goods in both our civilian and military economies, and we are importing much more than what we are exporting.\n\nSome of our ministers have come up with a solution to this problem. Ever since our conquest of the warlord state of Zlatoust, its leader, Yevgeny Dragunov, has sat in our prisons. While he may have made mistakes in his past, pardoning him in exchange for his connections could be very useful. It's not like he can sell weapons to our enemies anymore.\n\nHowever, many of his contacts have been lost or scattered, so, unfortunately, we won't have access to every one of his contacts. Still, using Dragunov could be very useful, and these days we'll take whatever we can get. If that's a man who betrayed our country in the past, so be it."
 sverdreg.22.a: "He's still of some use."
 
 sverdreg.23.t: "The Attaché"
 sverdreg.23.desc: "The US Army base hustled with activity as soldiers prepared for their military exercise. Roman Sidorov was excited to see the army in action after coming to America as a military attaché. One of the many bases surrounding Washington D.C., this one was special as it was one of the only that had monthly base-wide military exercises. "You must be Sergeant Roman Sidorov." Said a man with a large green cap, walking towards Roman with his hand outstretched. "I am Colonel Grayson Garnes, commander of this base. I'm glad you could visit."\n\n"It's good to meet you, Colonel." Roman paused for a moment, he knew basic English but he was no fluent speaker. "I was very interested in viewing your training exercise today, would you care if I watched?"\n\n"Of course you can watch, it is your job, isn't it?" said Garnes. "Follow me, there is an excellent viewing platform a few yards away. I'm sure you will enjoy seeing today's exercise."\n\nRoman climbed the platform with the commander, and a few minutes later the action began. The base had been divided into two teams, red and blue, and the army was practicing tank tactics and mobility warfare. Roman watched the American tanks speed across the fields and dodge obstacles while still firing shells constantly. They seemed invincible, he thought. He had to get these tactics back to Sverdlovsk. Tank warfare would be necessary in Russia. "You enjoying it, Roman?" The commander said. "These tanks are newly developed, just off the production lines. They'll be the first things those Germans or Japanese see in a fight with the US Army."\n\n"We definitely don't have anything like it back in Russia. The tactics themselves are new to us! I'm sure my commander back home will be most pleased with what I've learned here in America."\n\n"Well, that's good to hear. Just don't let those notes drop into German hands on your way home, alright?""
 sverdreg.23.a: "We will surely benefit from these tactics!"
 
 sverdreg.24.t: "A Chance Meeting"
 sverdreg.24.desc: "Making sure the door was locked behind him, Boris Yeltsin waltzed into the fancy bathroom. Having to get out of that boring trade meeting, Boris always remembered to have his contingency vodka bottle for things like this. Unfortunately, the bathroom wasn't unoccupied, as an aide stood by the sink, washing his hands. The two met eyes and the aide looked down at the bottle of vodka Yeltsin was holding. "Erhmm, uhh..." Yeltsin stuttered, unable to speak much English. Not exactly knowing how to get out of this one, Yeltsin shrugged, smiled, and produced a second shot glass.\n\nThe aide looked at the glass, appearing to debate on whether to take up on Yeltsin's offer. Yeltsin poured the vodka into the glasses and the aide, seemingly made up his mind, picked up the shot glass and smiled. "Cheers," he said before downing the glass.\n\nA few shots later and the two went back to the trade conference, the aide sitting down next to the senator representing the Americans at the meeting. The necessary papers had finally arrived, so the time came to sign the dozen or so pages in front of Yeltsin. Finishing with the fourth page, Yeltsin heard the senator say something in English to his translator, "Senator Fulbright wants to ask how many shots his aide got to before giving up, Mr. Yeltsin."\n\nRedfaced, Boris sheepishly gave his response to his translator. "Two, and they weren't filled to the brim, either."\n\nThe Senator broke out into laughter and spoke to his translator again. "Next time you go out for a drink with my boy Bill Clinton here, have him make me proud by drinking four like a real man.""
 sverdreg.24.a: ""Sure will, but not in a bathroom next time.""
 
 sverdreg.25.t: "Opportunities in West Siberia"
 sverdreg.25.desc: "A proposal from Russia has been received from our diplomats today. The Government of West Siberia has come to us with appeals for trade and recognition, seemingly reaching out to many nations outside of the German sphere. Recognizing them will surely anger Germany, as well as the other Russian governments, but there are many things we can gain from this deal.\n\nThey have many resources that we could definitely use, such as oil and natural gas. While we may be getting much of our oil from the middle east, having another producer is always a good idea. We could partner up our oil company ENI with their company Gazprom to make sure as much oil as possible reaches us. Sending the ENI to Siberia may also give us influence of their oil production as well. Trading and recognizing will show we are close to their government though, and if we wish to have close relations with another Russian government we may want to hold off until a better time."
 sverdreg.25.a: "Of course, the more oil the better!"
 sverdreg.25.b: "We have no interest in them."
 
 sverdreg.26.t: "West Siberian Trade"
 sverdreg.26.desc: "Trading has begun with West Siberia, and with our trade, we can expect more raw materials to enter our country than ever before. The West Siberian government has already assured us that oil had already been shipped to us, and we should receive it on time. This trade will surely benefit both of us, giving us a partner in Russia and them an economic advantage over their neighbors.\n\nMore oil is always better too, fueling our citizen's cars and our military's tanks, trucks, and planes. Let's hope this flow of goods continues into the future."
 sverdreg.26.a: "Russia is surely more stable than ever, right?"
 
 sverdreg.27.t: "Italy Accepts Us!"
 sverdreg.27.desc: "Our message to Italy has been answered, and they have agreed to our proposal! Trade between our two nations will soon begin, and Italy has already recognized our country on the world stage. Our industries are preparing to export oil to Italy now, with our oil company Gazprom partnering with ENI. Hopefully, this partnership should break through the problems of trading with the distant Italy, seeing problems of how our goods will reach them on the horizon.\n\nThis deal doesn't just come with free trade between us though. As part of it, we will need to invite ENI into our country to oversee oil extraction. This may give the Italians more power over our oil deposits than we like, but it's worth it. We need as many trade partners as we can get."
 sverdreg.27.a: "Italian oil expertise on our side!"
 
 sverdreg.28.t: "Italy Rejects Us!"
 sverdreg.28.desc: "We have received a message back from Italy, and it wasn't what we expected. Unfortunately, Italy denied our request for trade and has not recognized our government. We do not know if they are more interested in relations with another Russian government or they do not want to do business in Russia at all, but this is an unfortunate loss for our diplomatic standing and trade options. Maybe they will be more willing to trade another day?"
 sverdreg.28.a: "Sad, but not a disaster."

 sverdreg.29.t: "Bandit Hunt"
 sverdreg.29.desc: "Gunfire filled the bandit hideout as Zahar's squadron surrounded the last bandit, not wanting to go down without a fight. This bandit hideout had been troublesome for the district, raiding villages and farms across its territory. It had taken Zahar's troops months to track it down. In a fight though, the bandits were no match for the Third Army.\n\nZahar, leaving cover, opened fire once again. A hit! The bandit went down, blood spattering the walls. That was the last of them. Most of the bandits surrendered on sight, not wishing to fight the more heavily armed Third Army. Those that fought back had gotten what they deserved.\n\nOrdering his men to clear out the bodies and the wounded, Zahar scanned the rest of the rooms one more time just to make sure no bandits were left hiding. There were no bandits left, but Zahar did find a lot of valuables. Jewelry, money, precious vases, and even a few paintings littered to rooms of the bandits. One thing stood out to him though, a doll, probably belonging to a young girl. Were the bandits really that cheap, just to take a doll from a little girl?\n\nWhile he knew his men would love to keep all the riches to themselves, the Third Army had a duty, and it was to serve the Russian people. Some of these were probably the only precious goods some people owned. Zahar would make sure they would return to their rightful owners no matter what, especially that doll."
 sverdreg.29.a: "The Third Army exists to protect the people, not rob them."

 sverdreg.30.t: "The [GetYear] Election Results"
 sverdreg.30.desc: "Campaigning for the elections have ended, and today is when the voting will begin! Polling stations have been set up in every city across West Siberia and once the voting is completed West Siberia will finally have an undisputed leader!\n\nSome have worried that Batov, using his power, would turn the elections in his favor. However, it does not appear that way as the voting seems to be pretty fair across the board, at least in the terms of a newly founded democracy. While some have complained the government has not gone far enough to implement a fair democracy, both still have a chance to win. There is no expecting who will come out on top.\n\nHowever, if Yeltsin does win there is no expectation of the Military just giving up control of the country. Batov and his army will try to keep as much influence as possible in West Siberia, no matter who wins."
 sverdreg.30.a: "At least there are elections."

 sverdreg.31.t: "The Third Army Marches Forward"
 sverdreg.31.desc: "Standing on the balcony in Sverdlovsk, overseeing the vast military parade below him, Marshal Pavel Batov felt great regret that his commander, mentor, and friend, Konstanin Rokossovsky, could not be beside him to see the procession.\n\nThe soldiers of the former Third Army, the army that Rokossovsky had led through the darkest of days and provided the springboard by which to achieve the control over Western Siberia that it now possessed, were superb. The discipline and order that had allowed them to stabilize the original District, and defend it against both revisionist and ultranationalist elements, remained. But, Batov knew, there was still improvement to be had.\n\nIn the regimented formations that marched past him, in the perfectly arranged mechanized formations that drove past, and in the experienced aerial elements that roared overhead there were, despite outward appearances, outdated tactics, insufficient recruit training, and problems with the centralization of command. All issues that needed to be, and would be, addressed. Batov would see to it.\n\nAs another group of infantry passed in front of his position, in perfect echelon and with salutes offered, Batov straightened and returned the gesture. He wished again that the old Marshal was here beside him. But he would honor his friend in the way he knew would be most valued: turning his military into the most professional, capable, and politically reliable force in all of Russia.\n\nAnd when that army had marched from the Pacific to the German border, he would know his work was complete."
 sverdreg.31.a: "Our task has only begun."

 sverdreg.32.t: "A Lost Soul"
 sverdreg.32.desc: "It was a bright, windy day in the city of Omsk, the former dark heart of the Black League. Marshal Pavel Batov stood before a particularly elaborate headstone with his entourage, taking a moment to examine the structure. "Leave me," he said quietly, "I will only be a moment."\n\nAs his companions left his side, Batov moved closer to the grave and knelt down in front of the inscription: "DMITRY MIKHAYLOVICH KARBYSHEV, 1880 - 1963"\n\nReading the name already caused a wave of memories to wash over the marshal's mind. General Karbyshev was, at one time, a man he could consider a comrade. During the Great Patriotic War, Batov would never even once consider the possibility that a man like Karbyshev was capable of taking arms against his brothers.\n\nAnd yet, here he was, a victim of his own misguided ambition to strengthen Russia's defenses, even if it cost him his soul. Perhaps, in the end, it did. Batov was feeling a curious mixture of sadness and regret. He was there when Karbyshev's mind began to drift into dark places, and he was there when the old general began to act upon his sordid thoughts. He could've tried to stop him; make an attempt to steer his comrade back onto the right path, but it was far too late for that now.\n\nKarbyshev, as well as the monster he had perhaps unwittingly created, was dead, and all Batov could do now was hope that he was finally able to find peace in the afterlife. After placing an old medal that once belonged to the late general at the base of the headstone, Marshal Batov stood and gave his final goodbyes to his old comrade-turned-adversary."
 sverdreg.32.a: "If only it hadn't come to this."

 sverdreg.33.t: "Across the Bay"
 sverdreg.33.desc: ""They just don't grow 'em like they used to, don't they, Dima?" Kuzma Galitsky muttered as he cracked the sunflower seeds in the bowl, Dmitry Lelyushenko sitting beside him. Work was over, but the two had extra business to finish that evening, and both found themselves in the empty break room, taking a short leave from their papers.\n\n"Yeah, when I was a kid, I remember they used to be saltier," Lelyushenko replied, taking a handful for himself, "I grew up in Rostov. That's where they grew all the sunflowers, you know? So you kind of get familiar with 'em. And these are not the ones I grew up with."\n\nGalitsky blinked.\n\n"You're from Rostov?"\n\n"Yeah," Lelyushenko replied, before pausing too, "Don't tell me you're from Rostov, too!"\n\n"Actually I'm from Taganrog," Galitsky, "You know, that small town across the bay?"\n\n"Really? My dad had a coworker from Taganrog. He used to give me treats on weekends when I was a kid," Lelyushenko answered back.\n\n"Ha? You're kidding! My uncle worked in Rostov. He took the ferry, and he always brought spare candy with him!"\n\nThe two generals laughed as they reminisced about their childhoods. However, an unnatural silence grew in the empty room.\n\n"They're probably dead, aren't they? My dad, your uncle, everyone. The Krauts must have wiped them," Lelyushenko said after a long pause.\n\nThe pause settled in once again before Galitsky replied in turn."

 batov.1.t: "Victory for the Marshal!"
 batov.1.desc: ""... Marshal Pavel Batov and the Army," cried the radio announcer, "have secured victory in the referendum!"\n\nBatov, relieved, shut his shortwave receiver off and looked out at the city below him. Even with the Army's underhanded tactics, he hadn't been sure that they would take the vote. The people have this ridiculous fascination with democracy that he couldn't get his head around. Now, of all times, the people would rather be headed by some fool with no knowledge of military strategy rather than the generals that have guided the nation successfully for years? Yeltsin couldn't lead an army out of a paper bag, let alone against Germany. It couldn't be allowed to occur, especially with our enemies amassing on the border.\n\nThe Marshal was getting worked up now, as he often got about politics. However, his thoughts were interrupted by a light shining into his eyes from the street below.\n\nHe took a closer look, only to see a small boy pushing a cart on the street below selling small baked potatoes. The cart was a large thing, with a little metal sign out front reflecting light into his window. The poor boy could barely push it.\n\nBatov's eyes softened, and he leaned back in his chair. All he did, he did for the Russian people."
 batov.1.a: "They would understand that in the end."

 batov.2.t: "A New Office"
 batov.2.desc: "They had moved Batov to a new office when they took West Russia: a bigger, more opulent one. Did he deserve it? Batov would have said no. This office was paid for by the blood and sweat of his men. He did not look forward to the bigger office if he reunified Russia. More blood, more death. It was hard to focus on the victories rather than the mistakes that inevitably happened: friendly fire incidents, faulty equipment, failure of intelligence, and just bad misfortune. It did not feel right to excuse oneself by rationalizing it all as a learning experience. He and the Council were competent at war planning and strategy but would it be enough? Could they finally reunite Russia and one day retake Moskowien?\n\nThe phone rang and he picked it up. "Sir, the Council of Generals have convened and they would like your presence."\n\n"Of course, I'll be right there." Batov hung up the phone and grabbed the things he needed for the meeting. All the worrying could wait."
 batov.2.a: "There was still work to be done."

 batov.3.t: "A New Beginning"
 batov.3.desc: "Rodion could remember that day in the court as though it was yesterday: he had said too much to the police, his lawyer tried his best, and it was a simple deal from the judge: five years of hard labor or two in a frontline combat unit as punishment. He chose the second option. At the training camp, he was assigned to Misfit Company. It was a penal unit full of former criminals and convicts: murderers, thieves, captured bandits, none of them innocent. Well, a few claimed otherwise about how their juries were braindead, their lawyers were clueless, and how the military judges of the Russian People's Union just had it out to get them. When the jesters and funny men got around to ask him what got him in this unit, he answered honestly: "It was my last job. Everything was perfect to steal the money and we got caught. A rat sold us out."\n\nThe jokers frowned in a rare moment of pity for a fellow thief before one blurted, "Well, we could still use your skills. No end of odd jobs around here - especially when the regulars have got all the nice rations!" The other men laughed and hollered at that.\n\nOver the din of mirth, another one chimed in: "Rodion, is it? More like 'Raskolnikov'!"\n\nRodon grinned and replied: "I'm sorry, I don't steal from old grandmas. Like you." The barracks erupted in hollering and laughter."
 batov.3.a: "We few, we merry few..."

 batov.4.t: "A Deal for Soldiers in Hiding"
 batov.4.desc: "In the capital of the Russian People's Union, two men were being escorted up the stairs towards High Marshal Batov's office. The guards looked bored as if they were escorting yet another two dignitaries being brought up to the High Marshal. The two men however were confused and dazed. At break of dawn, both of them this morning were suddenly awoken by angry knocking at their door. At the door were serious looking Internal Security Bureau agents asking for Sergey Akhromeyev and Alexander Altunin respectively. When the two met up at Batov's headquarters, the two gave the other a look which asked: just how did Batov and his men find out their real names and new addresses? The two ex-WRRF generals followed the guards into the large office of High Marshal Batov. Batov dismissed the guards and asked the two men to sit down. Batov clasped his hands together and began, "Was the trip here comfortable? Did anyone mistreat you on your trip here? Because," Batov smiled a little bit. "I could have them court martialled if so." The two men sitting were still silent and seemed nervous. "Anyhow, you're probably wondering why I have you here today: both ex Revolutionary Front high ranking generals. No, I'm not here to arrest the two of you. I wanted to make a deal."\n\n"What sort of deal?" asked Altunin.\n\n"Join the Russian People's Union on the general staff. We need all the help we can get in the coming days. Both of your experience would be incredibly valuable and would be appreciated." Batov paused for a moment. "Would you two be interested? After all, we are still the Red Army."\n\nThe two men looked at each other. Akhromeyev then said, "Give us a few days to think about it.""
 batov.4.a: ""Take all the time you need so long as the final answer is yes.""

 batov.5.t: "Difficulties in the Conference"
 batov.5.desc: "On the second day of conferences, Batov thought the entire conference was in bad shape. It had been another day of arguing over how best to go forwards, which problems were most pressing, how best to do this, and the like. It was sometimes heated and at other times bone crushingly boring. Batov would have been lying to say that he was attentive the whole time.\n\nRight before the end of another frustrating day, Pavel Batov stood up and asked the men to go back to their seats.\n\n"Gentlemen, although it is merely day two, I find our progress lackluster. I am speaking now to remind you that the people of Russia rely on us to get this right. More than half of the issues plaguing our territory are not military related. As such, I must emphasize: we cannot approach them in a military manner." Batov paused. He wished he had written out more of a speech before having all those eyes on him. Before him there were strategists, tacticians, logistical experts, but not a single civilian.\n\nHe continued: "We cannot afford to be stubborn here. We cannot crush poverty beneath tank treads. Yes, officially, we make the final decisions but we must lean into civilian leadership and the specialized expertise they possess. The strength of the Russian people is a strength beyond military strength, and now is our chance to prove that. One day, when Russia is reunified, when the Nazis plague our lands no longer, the people of Russia will have the luxury of beating our swords into their ploughshares. On that day, when the rest of the world sees the nation of Russia, what will they see? I hope they see a formerly humiliated and war-torn people who, against all odds, stood up with courage and determination to forge a better future.""
 batov.5.a: "The applause was thunderous."

 batov.6.t: "A Late Night at the State Department"
 batov.6.desc: "Jim was rushing to edit together the last of the dossier. He had already spent a lot of long nights on this briefing. Tight deadlines were unfortunately a hallmark of a State Department career. At least this time it wasn't just plain old paperwork. A Russian warlord named Pavel Batov wanted to pay a diplomatic visit to the United States and Jim had to organize a briefing for the people who were going to meet him. They say he has organized a competent fighting force, cracked down on the corruption, and in fact has reunified half of Russia. All things considered, even if he was the head of a military junta, he did not seem like a terrible American ally: reliable, hated the Reich, and not terribly tyrannical. Jim enclosed a clear black and white photo of Batov as the final touch and he slid all the documents into a yellow folder. He was going to drop it off at his superior's desk.\n\nWhen his superior opened up the dossier, he picked up the black and white photo of Batov and was intently looking it over. "Hmmm, he reminds me of someone," said his superior.\n\n"Who?" asked Jim.\n\nHis superior paused for a moment. "He reminds me of an old Russian general: Suvorov."\n\n"What was so special about Suvorov?" Jim forgot that his superior had a background in Russian culture and history."
 batov.6.a: ""For starters, Suvorov never lost a battle.""

 batov.7.t: "Surprise Inspection"
 batov.7.desc: "The base commander thought it strange that such a luxurious looking motorcade had showed up at his training camp. He had thought it was yet another general in the Council with more time than sense showing up for a regular inspection. When he saw the unmistakable greatcoat billowing in the wind, he knew who it was instantly. He rushed out to greet the High Marshal and stammered out: "Sir, this is surely a surprise and I'm not sure if your aides had told you but this camp trained our ex-convict combat units?"\n\n"Yes they had and the surprise was part of the plan," the High Marshal replied, as he shook the base commander's hand with a smile.\n\nThe base commander took him on a tour of the whole base. They had a killhouse to train for urban warfare, live fire drills (with real ammunition), and an honest to god obstacle course. Of special pride for the High Marshal were the field rations that the men had. No, they were not the most tasty meals but they were more than edible and far better than what they had before - courtesy of some beneficiaries in Washington D.C. All of this had made his heart swell with pride for his army. They had truly become a formidable fighting force...but would it be enough?\n\nThey had not yet reunified the entire country. Moskowien was still occupied by the Reich, a truly terrifying opponent if there ever was one. Batov watched the men resting at the end of their physical training session. The men may have had discipline, skill, courage... but sometimes war was beyond virtue and skill. Sometimes war was about luck and Batov wasn't sure he was an especially lucky man."
 batov.7.a: "All that he and Russia could do were their best."

 batov.8.t: "A Soldier of the Motherland in Washington D.C."
 batov.8.desc: "Batov had made it to Washington. He did the customary diplomatic song and dance: giving presents, saying the magic words to beg from the leaders of the country. He was a soldier, no more, no less, and he did not feel suited for this sort of work. He felt that he was wasting his time here. Yes, the work here was important but he wished only that someone else could have done it. It was all very exhausting - until the men from Washington brought him to Arlington.\n\nA tour guide led Batov and the entourage throughout the cemetery. Batov was as solemn as he could be as they were essentially passing through hallowed ground. Some graves were as old as the Civil War and others were as recent as the South African War. He marvelled about how clean the graves were and the effort put into maintaining the grounds. It was mostly uneventful save for his translator telling him the comments from the tour guide about the history and background of the cemetery. For their final trip of the way, they had arrived at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The tour guide had explained how the monument was in remembrance of a U.S. Soldier whose remains could not be identified but would be remembered nonetheless. The guide had timed for their explanation well since when he had finished, it had been time for the changing of the guard. The entire entourage watched with bated breath as the Sentinel did each and every step of the routine with pinpoint accuracy, precision, and timing. When it was all done, Batov had said something to his translator, asked for a bathroom, and promptly left with his guards.\n\n"Well, what did the High Marshal say to you?" the Americans asked the translator, curious of what had prompted such a sudden departure after the total silence during the tour.\n\n"The High Marshal is very grateful that you have had the generosity to show him Arlington Cemetery," the translator replied. "He had excused himself to be alone for a few moments. He will be back shortly."\n\n"What did he think of Arlington?"\n\n"He was deeply moved and told me that he wished the people of Russia could do the same.""
 batov.8.a: "A soldier does not weep - he sobs."
 batov.8.b: "A soldier does not weep - he sobs."

 batov.9.t: "Misfit Misfortune"
 batov.9.desc: "Rodion had heard about mine clearing duty before. He had prepared himself for the worst when they were given this mission: just him and the company marching across a suspected minefield and clearing with blood and flesh. Luckily, it was not like that at all. The company was given a crash course on minefield clearing practices. The officers also assigned them an experienced ordnance disposal expert to oversee the whole assignment. The whole company was given what little protective gear they had: a few layers of flak vests and these hot, heavy helmets with poor ventilation. Hell, the Russian's People Union had the idea of setting up a first aid triage just beside the field they were working in. Rodion could not help but be a little anxious with how well they treated his company in this job.\n\nThe company was tasked with clearing a driveable corridor through the middle of the road. They were not worried about the anti-tank rated ordnance: they were much too big to be triggered by human prodding and would have required a whole vehicle's weight to set them off. However, the bastards planted anti-personnel mines as well. The company was organized to go in shifts because they had the manpower as well as the physical strain of looking for such things. Rodion watched the shifts preceding him put on the protective gear in the sweltering heat - as well as a few daredevils who didn't bother. He was told that complacency killed just as well. The damn metal detectors gave off plenty of false positives and more time was spent digging up loose shrapnel and random junk than mines.\n\nBOOM!\n\nA plume of dust and smoke came over the front column of the deminers. A few men were shouting for medics. Rodion sprinted over to try and drag the injured further away from the danger zone. Men writhed in pain and their blood painted the dusty road. Rodion began to drag one of the injured away from the danger zone. The protective gear on the man only slowed the attempt. Another man came over and grabbed the wounded man's other arm and started dragging as well. Rodion and his comrade were making good ground now. Just a few dozen more meters and they could get him in the triage."
 batov.9.a: "It was going to be a long day."

 batov.10.t: "A "Red" Army?"
 batov.10.desc: "Pavel Batov was signing paperwork when the door to his office opened with a click. It was Ivan Bagramyan, his second-in-command and more importantly his closest friend. Closest living friend, that is. It was still hard to think of Konstantin as dead, sometimes. It made Batov wonder if the man would approve of his recently rather heterodox thoughts. "You called for me, comrade?" Bagramyan asked, shutting the door behind him.\n\n"Yes. Yes, I did. Please, have a seat." When the other man had, Batov continued. "Apologies for the short notice, but I have something I need to get off my chest."\n\nBagramyan looked surprised to hear that. "Anything, comrade. Is the paperwork getting to you?" Batov shook his head with a small, almost sad smile.\n\n"No, no, nothing like that. I was just thinking... this Russian People's Union we've created, to be very honest, is not really a socialist state, is it? Yet we still call our army a 'Red Army' and proudly display a hammer and sickle. It's very peculiar, isn't it?" Bagramyan's eyebrows raised at this, and he seemed unsure of what to say, so Batov continued. "So then I thought, why continue to do such unnecessary things? Surely there are better uses for our time and energy than playing at being something we aren't for long-dead men." A silence fell between the two, and before Bagramyan could respond, Batov started laughing, making Bagramyan crack a polite, confused smile. "Well, nevermind what I've said, Ivan Khristoforovich. Let's leave the future to tomorrow, and talk about the past for today. How long has it been since we've spoken, just the two of us? Was it the Battle of Moscow?"\n\n"No, it was over in Samara, comrade."\n\n"Samara, that's right!""
 batov.10.a: ""We should go visit sometime.""

 batov.11.t: "Suvorov's Nightmare"
 batov.11.desc: "Pavel Batov stumbled as he walked through the battlefield. He could hear screams emanating from all around him. Some were distant, while others sounded close enough to be coming from right beside him. The marshal, however, was unable to tell. He could not keep his eyes open for more than a second, try as he may. It felt as though he was staring into the sun when he tried to look around, despite the pitch darkness. Eventually, the screams grew more distant, and the pace of the explosions began to slow.\n\nBatov noticed he could finally open his eyes, and saw that he now stood in what appeared to be a massive graveyard, with white crosses marking graves as far as the eye could see. Turning back towards his front, Batov noticed with a curious statue in the distance. Standing beside the monument were several men wearing the uniforms of a Red Army general. Upon drawing nearer, however, he noticed he could not make out their faces no matter how hard he tried.\n\nThe figures began to clap as Batov moved closer to inspect the monument, which was a large, blood-stained depiction of himself. As he reached out to touch the statue, he heard one of the faceless men speak.\n\n"They all died for you."\n\nPavel Batov let out a muffled gasp as he awoke. Frantically looking around, he felt relief wash over him as he realized it was just a dream. The details of what had occurred in his sleep began to fade away, and Batov took the sunlight beaming through his bedroom window as a sign it was time to get up. An important strategy meeting concerning Moscow was to take place that day, and the Marshal wasn't about to make a habit of being late."
 batov.11.a: "It was just a dream..."
 batov.11_tt: "§Y...that may manifest if he is not §Rcareful§!§!."

 batov.12.t: "Promise of Payback"
 batov.12.desc: ""... one more thing, Comrade Kreizer, do you have the forms for the new uniforms? I could have sworn they were supposed to come in by yesterday."\n\nIt was Kreizer's time to swear now.\n\n"I think I got them, Batov, but I didn't know what they were, so I just put them in my desk. I'm sorry, let me go get them."\n\nKreizer opened up the desk, removing various sheafs of paper in the drawer when he came upon an old faded picture and paused. It was a picture of him, his parents and uncles at his Bar Mitzvah. What ever happened to them? he wondered, when his heart began to sink. He hadn't heard of them since the War began. Which meant... no. It couldn't have happened. Not to them. By God, not to them.\n\nBatov was going to ask Kreizer what was taking him so long when he saw him staring at the picture, and forgot about the forms for a minute as he let the fates of his family sink in. The two sat in the office for what seemed like an eternity before Kreizer began to speak.\n\n"How long will it take, Comrade?" Kreizer asked, "How long will it take until we get back at the Krauts for everything they took from us?"\n\nBatov blinked.\n\n"Soon," he replied. "But we have work to do first, remember that. We have a Motherland to reunify, and one day everyone in our nation can avenge what has been lost, comrade. Remember that.""
 batov.12.a: "One day."

 ### Yeltsin events ###
 yeltsin.1.t: "Victory for Democracy!"
 yeltsin.1.desc: "The election results are in, and Yeltsin and the democrats have secured victory with a large majority in the elections! It appears the people have spoken, and the military junta will soon be on its way out. Military control over government buildings is already beginning to decline as a civilian government replaces military control. Martial law is also being ended across the Ural District as the military relaxes its authority.\n\nAlthough as a civilian government replaces a military one, a lot will change. A more civilian styled government will no doubt shift the focus towards civilian issues, however, the military will still remain powerful and influential in the government.\n\nDemocratization will continue whether the military likes it or not though, and more freedoms will become within reach of every person in the Urals. Yeltsin has many plans for the Urals and Russia, whether he sees them through remains to be seen."
 yeltsin.1.a: "Congradulations, President Yeltsin!"

 yeltsin.2.t: "Behind Closed Doors"
 yeltsin.2.desc: "The meeting, despite its officiality and publicity, was actually quite private. The President posed for cameras outside the room, and after a few moments of impatiently waiting, the other man arrived. "Marshal." Boris Yeltsin greeted with a heavily photogenic- but fake grin, as Pavel Batov approached the door, seemingly ignorant or at least uncaring of the cameras flashing, the reporters eyeing the two men, and their respective entourages filing in.\n\n"Yeltsin." He replied with a stony expression and tone laden with steel, before entering the room ahead of the President. A title which he had "apparently" forgotten to address. For a brief moment Boris's expression faded as he took a step to the door, gave a wave to the cameras, and slowly closed it. Right, now to get this over with.\n\n"As discussed earlier," - he began, as he moved to the table and sat, before continuing. "The army will be allowed some representation in the government. However, should it be found that the army is interfering in the democratic processes..."\n\n"If anything, the army would only act against tyrannical abuses of power." Pavel interrupted, his eyes set on the President's own.\n\n"Define tyrannical."\n\nWhat followed was something unseen to the crowds outside. Fingers were pointed, documents were looked over and reworded, and Boris and Pavel were at the very center. Finally, after hours of haggling and shouting, the amount of seats the army would retain had been determined along with their status of "silent watchdogs"; a term which infuriated the President to no end. However, it was better to have an army pledging to defend democracy than one utterly opposed to it. Thus the groups bid their goodbyes, and stepped out of the room into the lighting of camera flashes.\n\nBoris's photogenic smile was tempered by the last thing he had heard the Marshal say:"
 yeltsin.2.a: ""We will be watching you, Yeltsin.""

 yeltsin.3.t: "Lunch for Two"
 yeltsin.3.desc: "A typical formal luncheon with the President was usually a full arrangement of his closest friends and advisors, all discussing current events or discussing topics ranging from books to hunting. However, today was not a typical formal luncheon. The room was almost entirely empty if not for two people within it, both discussing a small problem.\n\nNamely, Yevgeny Primakov's old ties to the All Russian Black League. Evgeny Pitovranov, the man's former mentor before the two had cut ties, became a leading member of Dimitry Yazov's administration. Even with the Black League now dead and gone, the potential for scandals did not end with Yazov or Pitovranov's deaths.\n\n"Exactly how many people do you think know?" Boris asked, as he eyed Evgeny with a stern expression. "We can't afford to let anyone capitalize on this - even if you had cut ties."\n\n"Do not worry; it will be covered up." Primakov replied, as Boris gave a gruff nod. "I certainly hope so; otherwise both you and I will be on the streets at best. At worst-" He didn't need to finish the sentence. Neither of the two did."
 yeltsin.3.a: "Ok."

 yeltsin.4.t: "The Inauguration"
 yeltsin.4.desc: "The crowds were silent at first, as the banners were raised and the trumpets blared. Then, the din came. It started small, as the troops stood to attention, and the members of Yeltsin's selected cabinet came to the podium. It rose, as Pavel Batov entered and took a seat on the front. Then finally, it roared as Boris Yeltsin, first President of the republic came into view.\n\nWith his right hand on his heart, the President stood through the anthem motionlessly, silent as a mouse as the patriotic songs blared and the crowd's roar continued, before he finally approached the microphone.\n\n"Dearest friends;" he began with a smile.\n\n"Today is an auspicious day not just for our newly founded republic, but for democracy itself! We have come from humble and heroic beginnings to this moment. Let us not forget the heroics or deeds of the past, but let us also look to a brave new future!"\n\nHours passed, with the President bringing up men and women. Soldiers honored for bravery, experts in multiple fields of governance, and- a few personal friends, or rich individuals. Thankfully, no one had any complaint to any of this; not even Batov for the time. Though there were rumors and rumblings of some partisans across Western Siberia, that could be handled... later.\n\nRight now, it was time for the people of Western Siberia to celebrate."
 yeltsin.4.a: "Freedom is our top priority."

 yeltsin.5.t: "The President's Speech"
 yeltsin.5.desc: ""Friends," The President implored, this time on a much smaller stage with a much smaller podium than he had taken to at his inauguration. "When I called out for democracy to be brought to Sverdlovsk, I did not expect the outcry of support that was given. I thank you, for your voices have allowed for a victory against any sort of tyranny. However." A pause, as Boris Yeltsin leaned in towards the crowds.\n\n"The task at hand is more difficult than we thought. Even now, storm clouds of terror and dictatorship gather across the whole country... we cannot allow for them to bring us into an eternal night. I implore you to stay united, and stay vigilant! The future of the republic is in not my hands, but yours." Applause rang out, as he slowly walked backstage. He had spent hours traveling. Speaking. Pleading. Hoping.\n\nBut there was hopefully a light at the end of the tunnel. The President's gait shifted from confident to a rare public tiredness, and his photogenic smile faded. A moment of rest, a moment of sleep - and then back to work. His schedule was filled with stops to travel at, and he couldn't waste time. So he regained the mask of jovialness, the gait of an excited dreamer, and walked to the car."
 yeltsin.5.a: ""Where to next?""

 yeltsin.6.t: "A Few Small Requests"
 yeltsin.6.desc: "The Internal Security Bureau agents did not have to ask questions when Primakov began sending small "requests" down from the top. Indeed, none did. Though if any of them had bothered to look at the whole picture, instead of the small "errands" given to different agents with a level of secrecy- and the President's private approval over it, they might have noticed several links.\n\nFor one, if anyone had looked at the piles of documents being phased out and burned, they may have noticed a few ancient letters from one Evgeny Pitovranov to Yevgeny Primakov and pondered, "Why was a leading member of the All Russian Black League in contact with one of our government's leading figures years ago?" Or perhaps, they would question the packages.\n\nYes, packages of cash were being delivered with letters all across the Republic to men and women. Former Black League members, a secretary in Primakov's own offices, a mayor, and a few others within multiple branches of government. More than enough to allow one to start planning for a potentially early retirement, and more than enough to hopefully convince them to listen to whatever the notes said.\n\nFinally, one might question a corpse out in the middle of the woods, just a short distance from the capital. Fresh, mangled to the point where figuring out who it was would be a near impossibility, with only an unfinished scream etched on what remained of a face, next to part of the wreckage of an automobile. If the dead could talk, they would have much to say.\n\nHowever, no one asked. No one looked. And neither Yegeny Primakov or Boris Yeltsin ever spoke a word about any of these strange occurrences to anyone, aside from a small nod in private to each other and a quick changing of topics."
 yeltsin.6.a: "Some things are better left buried, after all."

 yeltsin.7.t: "The Best Freedom of All"
 yeltsin.7.desc: "Anatoly was used to the sight of his "best friend" drunk on the streets. However, what he was not used to was the lack of policemen carting him off, usually with a disapproving frown on their faces, and a firm statement uttered from their mouths. Yet, here was Aleksei yelling at the top of his lungs with no policemen in sight. "DOWN WITH YELTSIN!" He chanted drunkenly, grinning and beaming on the street corner.\n\nNo policemen came to apprehend the town drunk, despite the occasional stare from a passing citizen, and his rancorous yelling. Even as he yelled about the government. Nothing. "Aleksei." Anatoly said, moving over to the older man with an expression of slight worry. "What are you doing?! You've been arrested before -" A hand interrupts his concerned intervention, going to his lips in a shushing motion.\n\n"Before. We live in a democracy. You can do that now." Aleksei said, with a grin.\n\n"You mean-"\n\n"Criticizing the government, criticizing what you don't like, criticizing the President... all legal now. You can say what you feel, and you won't get arrested for it."\n\n"So I could call the President too drunk -"\n\n"Too drunk? No, too sober!" A laugh.\n\nWhat followed became a blur, as Aleksei led the young man to the town's bar. Drinks. Laughter. Insults, largely in jest. From the President's height to the broken pencils he had on his desk in photographs, to the hand he hid behind his tie - anything and everything in the Republic was open to criticism. And everything was going to be criticized.\n\n"To Yeltsin; for giving us the freedom to call him whatever we want!" Aleksei roared, as the patrons followed suit with a laugh, and Anatoly cheered. For a moment, the younger man swore he could see tears in the eyes of the elder, but his smile seemed genuine."
 yeltsin.7.a: ""To think what could have been, if we could say what we had wanted before," wept the elder."

 yeltsin.8.t: "A Friendly Face"
 yeltsin.8.desc: "In Washington D.C., news travels fast. Boris Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Federative Republic had come to visit. Mere minutes after getting off the plane, Yeltsin quickly found his way into not just the welcoming arms of Washington, but the welcoming arms of America itself. An advocate of democracy when Sverdlovsk was under military rule, he quickly won the referendum and has since been the first President of this new fledgeling republic.\n\nEmbracing the President with open arms before cameras, Boris's trip to DC was a picture perfect spectacle, from his tour of the memorials, to a luncheon with numerous senators. Voices from all sides welcomed him, and hands from across party lines moved to shake his in unison.\n\nAdding to this, the press has had a field day, calling him and the Russian Federative Republic "a new hope" for Russia."
 yeltsin.8.a: "Here's hoping our first impression is accurate..."

 yeltsin.9.t: "The Suspicions of the Marshal"
 yeltsin.9.desc: ""No." Pavel Batov, Marshal of the Russian Federative Republic, stated as he eyed the documents before him and looked at Yeltsin. "Absolutely not. While the military appreciates your attempts at reform, several of these are outlandish or incredibly... specific."\n\nYeltsin - President Yeltsin the man continued to insist, reacted as he usually did to these simple statements. First, he'd grumble and gripe about how the Marshal's interference was sabotaging the republic. Then, after a bit of heated yelling, he'd try to "compromise" over the papers. Sometimes, it worked. Usually, it did not.\n\nFinally, he'd give in and the meeting would end...but not tonight. Tonight, Pavel had questions. "Why are packages of cash arriving in multiple hands? What are you talking about with Primakov?" "What is the ISB doing?"\n\nFor a moment, Boris's eyes widen, before his demeanor becomes cool. "I don't know what you're talking about." He murmured. "Just because I've been having a few meals with a friend doesn't mean we're talking about anything suspicious. Just a few sporting events, a few books, a few personal chats. As for the ISB, their activities are classified. What's this about packages?"\n\nPavel stared, before a few minutes passed. "Good night, Yeltsin." He practically spat, before leaving the room for the evening. He was right about one thing; there was no proof to any suspicions. However, his response..."
 yeltsin.9.a: "He's in on it, whatever "it" is."

 yeltsin.10.t: "Quiet Musings"
 yeltsin.10.desc: "In the dim hours of the night, Boris sat at his desk. The politicians, the staffers, the janitors, everyone had pretty much left this wing of the building. And in this dark hour, in this moment as mothers called their children to bed, as drunks criticized him in bars and nightly radio shows kept bickering and joking, he sat here at his desk privately. Alone.\n\nWas it wrong to have ambitions? Dreams? He saw the way Batov looked at him, along with the other doubters. Every single critic had something to say about the way he conducted himself, or his ideas, or his "act" before the press. But he had come all the way from being a political dissident to becoming the President. And now they were on the path to bring back Russia.\n\nPrivately, they were right - he did want to become the savior of Russia. He wanted to bring her back from the brink, to nourish her, to make her strong and firm. And yes, he did want the praise. He wanted his face to be in textbooks, he wanted parents to tell their children how he had brought Russia back from the brink, and he wanted to outshine Lenin, Bukharin, and the Tsars.\n\nWas it so wrong to want a legacy? To want this as his legacy? Russia called, and he was answering. It wasn't greedy, or overly self centered. Any man or woman would want the joyous screams of millions, or the happy smiles of war weary veterans at peace, or the horrors of the past replaced with hope. He could give them that. He would give them that.\n\nPerhaps they were just jealous, or thought he couldn't do it. Boris Yeltsin sighed once, before taking a single brief look out the window."
 yeltsin.10.a: "He'd prove them wrong. He had to."
