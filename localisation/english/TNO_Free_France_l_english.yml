  FFR_spirit_french_desc:0 "In the sole existence of Free France, the spirit of our long lasting democratic traditions still lives. While our armed hand on the continent is still the Résistance, even here in the deep lands of the Ivory Coast, we still fight for our ideals. Through the Comet Line, exiles were sent here from France and Belgium, believing in the all powerful nature of democracy and freedom, fighting for their country, even across oceans."

  FFR_tomb_republic_desc: "After their failed war in Western Africa, the last remnants of Free France have been reduced to occupying the lonely island of Kerguelen.\n\nKerguelen is a small landmass devoid of both strategic value and military resources. There is no hope of reclaiming the mainland for the exiles now, and like Napoleon and Saint Helena, the last scraps of Free France can now only wait for death to take them."

The old ones will reconnect with their families and friends, and the young ones will grow old and die in their fatherland.

  FRD_aiding_the_reclamation: "Aiding the Reclamation"
  FRD_aiding_the_reclamation_desc: "After much consideration from our forces, we have decided to let the Free French forces land in the territory we control. This has provided not just additional forces and aid in our fight against the illegitimate Vichy government, but also a boost in the morale of our forces and citizens. However, this aid has also brought unwanted attention by the USA and Germans, raising the stakes on the possibility of our victory."

  FFR_Charles_de_Gaulle: "Charles de Gaulle"
  POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_DESC:0 "Since there has been a "Free France", Charles de Gaulle has stood at its helm. For more than 20 years, de Gaulle has led the last remaining Free French in a desperate and drawn out battle for survival against the greatest odds. He was once a division commander in the army of the Fourth French Republic, keen to bring reform to their forces. His attempts were made too late however and France quickly fell the Wehrmacht.\n\nKeen to continue the fight, de Gaulle rallied what support he had and headed to Africa. Although the fighting continued, de Gaulle fared little better here. Over the years, the forces of Free France were relentlessly pursued across Africa until only the tiniest strip of what had once been the colonial possessions of the French Republic remained. Through it all, de Gaulle has been both a great boon and a great curse for those that still follow the dream of a Free France. The man is utterly convinced of "La Libération" to the point where it is hard not to share in the aging leader's sheer enthusiasm. Sadly, his conviction is paired with an extreme stubbornness. de Gaulle is unwilling to end the unpopular military government, despite the fact that his generals are usually too busy working as mercenaries for other West African nations and even the Germans in Zentralafrika.\n\nde Gaulle soldiers on, making his radio addresses and inspecting the troops each day, seemingly convinced that it will be part of the start of their journey home. He has even promised elections, although with the deadline drawing ever nearer, some are uncertain if de Gaulle is willing to even surrender that much to the people. Nor has he properly acknowledged the generals that wish to see him gone, and the fact they would be quite capable of having their wish fulfilled. De Gaulle must perhaps realise his situation and be willing to make compromises, should he wish to see his homeland ever again."
  POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_DESC1:0 "Everywhere outside of Free France. De Gaulle is seen as a failure. He failed to rouse his country from its darkest point. He failed to assist in the war effort. He failed France. But that is just outside Free France. In Free France he is a hero, albeit a fading one. Nobody can deny his charisma and optimism, and he has used it to the greatest extent he can in the tiny empire he has carved for himself. In his France, through all the troubles it goes through, they still march through the streets, singing La Marseillaise and chanting "Liberté, égalité, fraternité"\n\nIf there is one thing anybody can give credit to Charles de Gaulle for, its that he never gives up on France, and he won't till he takes his last breath."

  POLITICS_FRANCE_MENDES_FRANCE: "The most popular man in Free France is undoubtedly Charles de Gaulle, for obvious reasons. However, second place would most likely go to Pierre Mendès France.\n\nAfter France's surrender, Mendès France was sentenced to six years of imprisonment on a false charge of desertion. However, he escaped, and joined the Free French forces, where he served as part of a combat group, doing sabotage missions. He joined the CFLN in 1943, and acted as the official liaison between the OFN and Free France throughout the 40s and 50s.\n\nTo Mendès France, de Gaulle is nothing more than a tinpot dictator, and the Free French army a corrupt hive where few true allies remain. He opposed expansion in Africa, and also any violent attempt at reclaiming France. In 1962, he was the one to push for a French Constitution in Free French territories, which had been suspended nearly two decades prior.\n\nMendès France represents both a strong commitment to socialism in a deeply conservative country, and to a moral compass that has never been put aside."

  free_france_reconstruction.3.desc: "It is done. The West African War is over. Across the new nations founded in the wake of PALF's collapse, hundreds of thousands have been displaced and entire towns erased from the maps. Orphans roam the land, searching for parents that would never come home. America stares at her triumph. There will be no true victory until liberty spread its wings over the nations it has won.\n\nThe nations of West Africa and exiles of France cry for our help. They argue that only America's involvement in the reconstruction can save West Africa for itself. For our part, corporations like Firestone and DuPont are chomping at the bit to exploit the resources in the region. President [USA.GetLeader] has approved the initial aid packages and projects, and it is up to us to ensure that we hold West Africa humanely.\n\nIt is a hard task. The people of the United States believe that they are up to the task of helping these people rebuild and rise from their ashes. It is up to the administration to ensure that this belief does not remain a metaphysical object."

  free_france_reconstruction.4.desc: "As much as the government of Free France would have preferred to focus efforts on rebuilding West Africa following its war with Cameroon, the outbreak of civil war in mainland France presents an opportunity we can't pass up; every single cent must be devoted to aiding our countrymen in usurping Fascism from France's soil and driving the remnants of Vichy into the sea.\n\nWith this in mind, there is tragically little we can spare for the reconstruction of West Africa; we can only hope that, in the event of our final victory, we can send some aid to the local Africa governments in developing their nationhood, but for now, every measure of ourselves must be dedicated to ending the legacy of Pétain and restoring the honor of France!"

  free_france_reconstruction.5.t: "Hard Years, Arid Years"
  free_france_reconstruction.5.desc: "The automobiles kicked dust from the new highways into the arid lands beyond the city limit. Dry jungle boughs waved broad-leaved salutes at any sign of the breeze. Up high and against the clear noon sky, a steel column arose from the ground, holding on its terminus the round Coca-Cola sign, stamped bright red with the company's signage. A farmer stood in its shadow, looking right and left before spitting at it.\n\nIt had been a hard year for West Africa. He saw his sons go to war, returning home in caskets draped in the tricolour. Farmhands went away to serve, never to be seen again. The land, arid though it was, splayed its gifts as tidings to ease the burden of grief. That, too, was being taken away from him. He turned his head eastwards towards the city of Bamako, growing, accreting all the riches of this land.\n\nHe saw the new roads, packed with people from the other villages. New buildings, stamped in the signage of the American companies. He shook his head. How did it come to this? He saw the soldiers dig into the reservoirs of the earth, diverting it to the plantations. In their eyes was the dull blaze of idle disdain. Their ears met his complaints with deft ignorance. He sighed. Inching forward, little by little, he walked to the city."

  free_france_reconstruction.6.desc: "They loaded Diallo and his family up into the trucks. Soldiers on jeeps guarded either side of the motorcade, machine guns glistening in the evening rain. Many times they had to stop to help lift the vehicles up from the mud road, and the armed men watched, eyes impassive. Youthful men, barely out of their twenties, already numbed to the suffering of so many. Diallo saw it in their eyes, too. Deadened. Some joked and lit up cigarettes, attempting to hide that premonition of guilt.\n\nThe trucks clambered over low hills, the mud trails winding through clearings in the jungle. They passed through checkpoints enclosed by walls of chicken-wire. The spotlights searing through the jungle with its cyclopean gaze. Diallo knew not where he was going. It did not matter.\n\nAs the land flattened and the jungle canopies retreated to far-off corners, plantations appeared. The rubber trees neatly planted, row upon row. Workers ambled about their bases, collecting latex in small buckets. Diallo and his children watched them go by, little by little, until the neat trees and shambling men grew smaller into dots in the horizon. The advancing treeline swallowed all.\n\nThey reached their camp not long after. They stepped off their vehicles and went in a line to their quarters. Improvised huts with thatched roofs barely enough for two, let alone five. Regardless, they drew their legs in, and waited for the morning to come."

The sounds of life were a mere whisper at this distance. Two men stepped off the vehicle, shirts drenched by the intensity of the sub-Saharan sun. One hunched, examining the soil by crumbling it in his hands. His two fingers ground the dry, reddened dirt into fine grains of dust, leaving wispy trails draining unto the earth from which it came.\n\n"Seems about the right type of soil," the hunched man said. "Just needs a little bit of water. With that river," he inclined with a gesture of his finger, "we'll be set. Rubber trees would grow well here."\n\n"How much of the land do you reckon Firestone will take?" his companion said, eyeing the village with the binoculars he held. "Rough estimation."\n\n"Oh, well," the other man stood up. "From here," he indicated the edge of the jungle, "to here." His hand swept through the village to reach the other side of the vegetation. "I reckon that'll make them happy."\n\n"And the village?"\n\n"And what about the village? Is there going to be a problem?""

He clicked the record button in his cassette tape.\n\n"Tell us your name." The correspondent said, inclining to the interpreter.\n\n"Diarra."\n\n"Diarra, thank you. Now, Mr. Diarra, I understand that you work for the Firestone Natural Rubber Company. Does the company take care of its employees? Do you and your co-workers obtain sufficient incentives to keep working?"\n\nWhen the interpreter translated the queries to him, the Bambara man looked at them with a mocking grin. He began speaking. "He says," the interpreter said, "Before this point, he worked in the rural farms near the rivers. When the war ended, most of them looked for a job. Any job. Firestone took up that deal." There was a glint in Diarra's eyes now. "They shouldn't have." He was silent after.\n\n"Why not?"\n\nThe man met the correspondent's eyes. Sighing, he continued. "The only incentive they keep here is with guns. Bad news. Soldiers watching from ditches to make sure they tap every tree properly. They got women and children in the sites too, working. Do you have any further questions?"\n\n"Yeah. Sure. We'll make sure that this reaches the States, Mr. Diarra. Count on us.""

When they arrived, they saw those budding saplings, rows upon rows of them budding with the promise of prosperity held on the tips of those leaves. Cocoa, a commodity that Hershey had to contend with the Mexican and Brazilian monopolies for so long, was now available for them exclusively. The men threw high fives above their jeeps and saluted the shabby forms in-between the rows of plants.\n\nA local Malian general was to host their lunch. In the sweltering sub-Saharan sun, they dined on spiced rice and chicken, meat cooked in peanut butter stews, and smoked fish. "Thank you for the opportunity," the uniformed officer said. "Mali grows strong with each passing day." They looked at the plantation from their lunch tables.\n\n"It's a mutually beneficial arrangement, general." One of the executives said. "More to come." A pause. "Speaking of, how are you going to find the labor for these... complexes?"\n\n"Leave it to me." The general curtsied. "I know exactly where to find them.""

She saw them cut the beans and grind them to fine dust, a patchwork of calluses on the palm of their hands. So young, and yet so old.\n\nShe made deals to get here. A lieutenant down the road, some one-hundred twenty dollars under the table, and on she rode, to the Hershey plantation down south where she stayed. "Cameras?" She said.\n\nThe lieutenant shrugged. She carried one Polaroid with her anyway. Taking pictures of things she'd rather forget. Searing in colour the things she saw. She saw those pictures crawl out of her Polaroid, horror etched against every corner, mundane and plain. She stared at those fingers again, noticing the missing fingers, the scars of slashes rending through flesh.\n\nShe quizzed the children. Early risers against their own will. Small hours of the morning, they woke up. Straight to the plantation. No playtime. None are older than nine. She asked them if they've seen their parents. A shake of the head. Have you ever eaten chocolate? Another. They went back to town half an hour later, silence growing amid the rustle of the underbrush.\n\nIn her room, she wrote."

West Africa is a rich land, packed with fertile soil and waterways to support natural rubber growth. Firestone extracts rubber tapped from their plantations in Mali, shipping them off to their plants in Liberia. Though the arrangement had suited Firestone in the past, the immense growth of the company's assets had meant that this process had become a bottleneck.\n\nThe talks began when DuPont approached the corporate leadership at Firestone. They made a general gesture: if Firestone agrees to their infrastructure deal, DuPont will exclusively buy rubber only from Firestone's plantations, eschewing other competitors in the field. In exchange, DuPont will provide capital for the new highways, train networks, harbours, ports, and ships in tandem with Firestone's own contributions. One condition became paramount for DuPont: Firestone will only use its plants for rubber processing.\n\nWeeks passed, and talks whittled the terms into specifics. The consensus did not change."

Soldiers hurried workers into the plants, watching them over with machine guns.\n\nHe, draped in a camo jacket and press clearances hanging between his shoulders, saw all of this. Army newspapers talked in boldface print that they were winning the peace here, all love, peace, hearts and minds. The stalks of trees, leafless in the jungle heat, spoke otherwise. The land, burning with scars, dripping with blood, its rivers coursing and flowing with waste, banks full of displaced people. He would never see what they see, understand what they understood.\n\nThe war sowed the seeds of hope, he supposed. American soldiers, good-hearted boys sent to die in clearings, a wash of fiery orange fire sweeping through the woods before them, make for good stories, good photos. Here were men; they shall live and die free, as their forefathers were. He saw those hardened eyes by the riverside. He shook his head.\n\nHomecoming will be hard."

  france_iberia_negotiations.3.desc: "Diplomats were shocked today when an unexpected messenger arrived at their offices. The messenger carried a letter from the French. While the initial reaction was mundane, expecting another rambling letter from the Vichy government, the diplomats' faces turned to shock upon reading it and realizing it was from the Free French in Abidjan.\n\nThe Free French's victory in West Africa has already shaken the global community, and this letter may just be the start of another earthquake. They are calling for a meeting to discuss mutually important matters to both sides, raising questions as to why and what the cause of this could be.\n\nWe have a hunch as to what this could mean, given the Free French's long-standing goal of retaking the mainland. Such an agreement would be beneficial if handled well, and Iberia certainly has more to gain than lose in such agreements, if they are successful.\n\nAlready, we have started making preparations for the meeting in Iberia, and another letter has been sent back to Abidjan in anticipation. After all, there is no harm in meeting, at least not for us."

An official delegation from Free France - headed by none other than Philippe Leclerc himself - arrived late last evening in their plane for what are sure to be some very interesting talks.\n\nWe have a lot in common with the Free French, but there is much more work to do before we can truly consider ourselves allies. If we are to advance our shared interests, we must coordinate our policies with theirs.\n\nThe process for doing so is rather simple. First, we will present our conditions, and the Free French will decide what to do with them. They will follow with a round of their own. We will repeat this until we reach an agreement on all topics we need.\n\nIt sounds straightforward enough, but we know the road ahead is full of obstacles.

Without prompting, the talks quickly gravitated to the topic of the impending Reclamation: in particular, what Iberia would do to help the Free French in their endeavors.\n\nAs we consider our options, we must be realistic. Supporting them will not come without consequences, and we are risking quite a lot by backing them.\n\nNaturally, this means we need something in return. We will need to discuss what to ask the Free French for in exchange for our support. Luckily, our representatives have already begun discussing this amongst themselves, and there are three directions they suggest the talks can proceed in."

  france_iberia_negotiations.9.desc: "For the first time in several days, the halls hosting the Franco-Iberian negotiations have fallen silent. While the Iberian would like to claim this is due to a job finished and well done it was quite the opposite. At least the opposite for one of those points.\n\nThe negotiations were indeed over, but not successful. In frustration, Leclerc and his delegation had called the whole thing off, cursing the Iberians for their stubbornness, and gaining sympathy for Italy's situation several years ago.\n\nIberia's diplomats sit somberly, reflecting on their recent failure. Some indulge in alcohol to drown out the pain, while others throw themselves into more work to make up for it.\n\nToday, Leclerc flies back with his delegation into West Africa. His stomach churning, he and his men look back on the failure with remorseful, yet analytical minds considering what to do next. The plane flew off, leaving Iberia behind, perhaps forever, while its men looked back wistfully on what could have been."

  france_iberia_negotiations.10.desc: "As negotiations continue, the topic of colonial claims and administration has come up. Both the Iberian government and Leclerc's delegation have a vested interest in how their respective possessions in Africa are handled, albeit with some nuance.\n\nBoth sides have remained deadset in their opposition to anticolonial movements. This has made agreeing a fairly simple affair. Iberian diplomats were especially surprised at how fiery the French were given how indirectly they control their territory, yet it makes sense given their recent scuffle with pan-Africanism.\n\nLeClerc admitted that his government would be unable to maintain a direct hold over West Africa if they retake the mainland; they promised to do what they can to keep friendly governments in place so that both the Iberians and Free French can continue to have access to valuable West African Markets.\n\nWhile this is all dandy, the question of colonial claims is a little more tricky. Asking the Free French to relinquish their claims to our colonies would be a win both for the state and future peace between the two nations. Yet, it could also unnecessarily anger the French, and risk them calling off the entire colonial guarantee."

Leclerc has even threatened to abandon the negotiations altogether. If we are to take the Free French delegation at their word, we'll have to move on from this topic if we want these discussions to continue.\n\nHowever, it could just be a bluff. If the Free French government truly wishes to liberate France, we're their best option. This position gives us leverage, and we best not forget this fact.\n\nIn addition to the above, there is simply the reality that the Free French have no practical way of reclaiming the colonies under our control. They're preoccupied with the government occupying the mainland, and after usurping them they'll be bogged down by Reconstruction and resolving their affairs in West Africa. Trying to start a war with us would be a fool's errand.\n\nHowever, if they truly are being honest about withdrawing, then we might be letting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity walk away. We've already won some concessions, and we can likely win some more if we simply continue on to a new topic."

We can't really say we are surprised.\n\nEven if the Free French forces managed to once more reclaim Metropolitan France, the destruction and violence that would occur during such an endeavor would leave the nation as a shadow of a shadow of its former self. Thus they now ask for us to promise to grant them quite generous, ergo, expensive loans after their return home. Unsurprisingly, this request has split our own delegation.\n\nOn the one hand, half of the delegation insists that such spending is completely out of budget and would be a waste of money. There are even those that insist that Iberia should look to not strengthen the French too much in order to remain as the stronger half of our relationship. Yet the other half is adamant on it being a worthwhile investment, seeing a renewed France as a possibly invaluable ally and partner in Europe and Africa.

We can't really say we are surprised, nor can we really refuse.\n\nThe French, using our previous arrangement regarding their debt payments, have successfully negotiated for us to grant them these loans if they retake France. The devastation of such a conflict would require a wide reconstruction effort that would take significant funds, and with the French's agreement to high interests in their debt payments we have been backed into a corner and been left without an easy way to reject. Therefore our hand is forced despite the silent grumbling of a few bureaucrats who complain about the high cost of such a thing."

Hopefully it turned out that it was far less of a headache than we had anticipated. The French proposal was surprisingly simple and straight to the point, a simple request of moderate enough loans in the case they succeeded in their reclamation of Metropolitan France.\n\nAfter much negotiation and a few agreed on modifications from both sides, we have been able to successfully come to an agreement regarding these loans and all they might entail. This smooth dealing with what many expected to be a heavy and complicated topic has brought a new sense of confidence to both delegations going forward.

Not only would such entanglement come with innumerable risks, but it would also directly involve Iberian lives in the Reclamation. If we can avoid it, it may be best to force the Free French to settle for merely naval support.\n\nHowever, if we can't force them to settle without collapsing the negotiations, then we may still be able to extract some more value from this request.

It took a great deal of politicking, promises and compromises. The French initially were vehemently opposed to the idea of providing these bases, as they feared risking their hegemony in the region, and they were near ready to walk out. Our initial offer had been simple monetary support, which would not have cut it, as their primary motivation is as always their revanchism.\n\nLuckily, we offered a fair deal. Should they allow our troops into their territory, we will give them ground and air support when it comes time to reclaim France. This sweetened the deal immensely, and after the kinks were worked out, they graciously accepted.\n\nAlthough this is highly beneficial to our military complex and expand our global influence, we have intertwined ourselves further with the Free French war machine, which will almost certainly have a future effect on our politics. We, however, did not get into this without expecting that, so matters remain par for the course."

Their fears that our bases would threaten their hegemony over their scrap of West Africa won out against their desire to reclaim the mainland.\n\nLuckily for them, they will still be receiving our support in the Mediterranean, escorting their ships to the shores of the mainland. This seems to have been enough for the Free French, and this will still allow us a measure of diplomatic leverage in the future. As shameful as it is that they have thwarted our chance for a strengthened military complex, stronger ties and further reach, we still are making a valuable ally through these negotiations.\n\nAs such, we will push on with further negotiation."

  france_reclamation.9.desc: "The good Lord was Charles de Gaulle's witness that in his heart of hearts he had never expected that things would play out like this. Yet here de Gaulle was, in his homeland, entering its capital amidst the voices of the liberated people in what was nearly his ninth decade of life. It was a quarter-century later than he would have hoped, but being back was all de Gaulle needed to be satisfied.\n\nDe Gaulle was not blind, however; he could see that the Capital had suffered. Newer buildings were demolished, roads were bombed out, and surviving old buildings had had fixtures struck off. Yet the people that lived in the homes of Paris, no matter those homes' state, all looked like they had never been this alive before.\n\nThe tricolour waved on every flagpole, and hung in pride of place from every balcony and threshold. There was not a single swastika to be seen as de Gaulle walked to the Hôtel Matignon, the provisional seat of government, amidst the cheers of an adoring populace.\n\nAt the gate of the Matignon there was a lectern; though it was empty, de Gaulle immediately began to speak. His words sent the populace into loud cheers: "We will not hide this deep and sacred emotion. These are minutes which go beyond each of our poor lives. France! France broken, France outraged, France martyred, but France liberated!"\n\nAs the people screamed their approval, de Gaulle carried on. "This duty of war, all the men who are here and all those who hear us in France know that it demands national unity. We, who have lived the greatest hours of our history, have nothing else to wish for than to show ourselves, up to the end, worthy of France. Long live France!""

But he kept covertly pinching himself in the vehicle that drove into Paris, expecting that he would wake up in Dakar or Conakry and this would all be a dream. But it was no dream. France was free.\n\nLeclerc did not waste time on sentimentality; work had to be done and the Nation's liberation completed. Convening with the Resistance leadership and the general staff came above all else. As for the speech, though the people had every right to be joyful, it was folly piled upon folly for him to incite them to let their emotions detain them—they needed to know at once what was to come next.\n\n"People of France!" After the usual congratulatory words saluting France's efforts, he got down to brass tacks. "In the near future, the plan is as follows. Reconstruction efforts and the consolidation of the state against German subversion will take the first priority, but elections will take place very promptly." People applauded every now and then, and he let them; it was only fair after all given the circumstances.\n\n"Now I will ask for a minute of silence, and thereafter to intone a prayer for those whose sacrifice made the freedom of France possible." When that was done, Leclerc left in some haste; he only had a brief moment of time to do what he was waiting for for over twenty years—to see his wife and children again. He had fallen down on his knees and muttered a prayer when the officer came in with the news that they were safe.\n\nHe saw them in a room of the Hôtel Matignon and ran to embrace them, dropping his usual reserve. It was then that he knew that France was truly free."

  POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_MAINLAND: ""France has lost the battle, but France has not lost the war!"\n\nSo said Charles de Gaulle in London all those years ago. Though he was one of the few to hold the Germans back as they invaded his beloved homeland, his career truly began and continued in a state of exile. He lived long enough to see France fall not once but twice: first to the shameless, subhuman Nazis, and the traitorous demon Pétain, and second to the unworthy collaborators of the Vichy Government. The sword of France fell, and de Gaulle picked up the pieces.\n\nHe became old in exile. His family, the home he had left behind in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, his people - the French people - for whom he had always fought: the absence and suffering of these precious things tortured him for the longest time. Yet he did not break; he carried the broken blade for more than two decades, and now by sheer grit and determination he has reforged it in the flames of hell through which he passed. Returning to free his people, he is a new Napoléon, a new Saint-Louis, the hero of his people and of the Free World, a man to be remembered for all eternity!\n\nThus Charles de Gaulle returns to his homeland - that by the grace of his loving God he himself was able to liberate - and falls to his knees. He mutters the ancient words: "Now Thou dost dismiss Thy servant, O Lord, according to Thy word in peace." A sigh leaves him, and tears of joy fall from his eyes. That is how it should be; after all, France, though outraged, broken, and martyred, has been liberated, and thus\n\n§iTOUT§! §WEST§! §VACCOMPLI.§!"
  POLITICS_PHILIPPE_LECLERC_MAINLAND: "For the entirety of his adult life, Phillipe Leclerc has been fighting. From the hills and trenches of the Ardennes in a desperate response to an unexpected gambit, to the heartlands of Africa fighting off traitors and secessionists, and to, at long last, France itself, Phillipe Leclerc has let war define him, fighting with mortal danger after mortal danger to the Republic, and even in defeat, never surrendering.\n\nIn this fight, he has lost a vast, vast sum. His family, trapped as the jailers closed in, alongside his home, and Leclerc's entire life. In Africa, large swathes of young men, buying himself and the Americans more time. And, in the end, Charles de Gaulle, not in combat but in old age, the very heart and conduit for the hope of all French exiles that someday, the brutal loss to Germany could be avenged.\n\nAnd yet, that hope was not wasted. Building off of de Gaulle's last foundations, and in the midst of Vichy's final humiliation and long awaited collapse, managed to claw the exiles' way back to the homeland. At long last, he may abandon what has perhaps defined him, and return home to his family and to his country. At long last, the old soldier may rest."

  POLITICS_FRANCE_CHABAN_DELMAS: "With the liberation of France now complete, the difficult task of rebuilding the country and bringing the ideals of Charles de Gaulle to fruition has now fallen into the hands of Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\n\nA part of the new wave of Gaullist politicians, Chaban-Delmas has easily climbed up the ranks thanks to his connections with the CFLN and Georges Pompidou and his closeness to de Gaulle and Leclerc.\n\nYet that is not Chaban-Delmas' only credential, far from it: a first-call Résistant who joined in 1940, he infiltrated the National Production Ministry of Vichy as a cover. When that cover was blown, he managed to slip away and join de Gaulle in London. Since then, Chaban-Delmas has followed the Général's notion of Libération, adding a personal touch: social progressiveness and reforms. That is the program that he will implement at the helm of the nation, and he will not rest until he succeeds."
  POLITICS_FRANCE_LECANUET: "With the liberation of France now complete, the difficult task of rebuilding the country has now fallen into the hands of Jean Lecanuet.\n\nA member of the French Resistance since 1943, Lecanuet labored hard and fast to save Jews from certain death. After the loss of Great Britain, he fled to Free France, and entered contact with the Organization of Free Nations very early on. One of the major influences that the OFN had was in inspiring him to copy the media methods used by American Presidents, hence why people commonly call him the 'Kennedy of France'. At the same time, he's become a stalwart Atlanticist - but with his own personal twist, that of insisting on an equal partner role for France.\n\nThough an adherent of the basic ideals of the Resistance, Lecanuet denounced Charles de Gaulle as excessively dictatorial in his methods. Rather than adhering to Gaullism the way Chaban-Delmas did, he prefers economic liberalism and the construction of a welfare-reinforced market economy. His task will be difficult, but he will not fail or falter in its execution."

There were about another dozen men with him, each with their hands tied, some with metal cuffs, some with rope.\n\nThe revolution was a dramatic failure. France would remain in chains to an unjust oppressor, and there was nothing Maurice could do about it. His men had been together as some of the first to seize a city, and some of them had been fighting since the second World War, like Maurice. Nearly 30 years, and he'd been stuck fighting underground for most of them since the establishment of Vichy. Some of those soldiers were with him through those years, like Pascal, who was a vineyard worker before joining the army. Then there was Jean, a young man born in Nice not 20 years ago, always hoping to serve his nation, and accomplish his father's dream; to start a family in Bordeaux once more. Then there was Phillipe, an aging artisan who fled the north not long ago, hoping to aid in liberation when the time came. Unfortunately for them, the four treacherous traitors led the resistance members to their certain doom. The walk felt abysmal for Maurice, like he was being pulled backwards with every step. There was little anyone could do in such a situation as this. Maurice thought he had felt hopelessness before, from the pits of the final days of official war, and perhaps he had, but then he was able to fight. Now, there was no such option. Throughout all that time, Maurice lived for his country, and sang its songs every morning to his son. And so, he already loved his country.\n\nIt began as a mumble, at least for a sentence or two, before everyone in the line realized he was singing "La Marseillaise". After a moment's hesitation, Pascal joined in. Their singing was cut short by a burst of machine gun fire tearing diagonally through Maurice's chest. Falling to the ground, the rest of the men froze, even the other captors. Jean was the first to sing again, then Phillipe, then the rest joined in. Again, gunfire overpowered their voices. As Jean fell onto Maurice's back, feeling his last breaths escape him, he muttered his final words to Maurice."

To follow the French resistance grow from a revolutionary non-entity to a force capable of overtaking a European state was a sight to behold, made no less intriguing by the sheer uniqueness on display in front of him now.\n\nThe scene was a sight to behold; a street in Bordeaux practically alight with flames and bonfires stretching across the avenue.

Usually he would walk down and ask around for comments, but it was not that kind of night; the whole city was in a state of partying and celebration, like an anarchic festival, with burnings and public executions around any corner. Standing there on his balcony overlooking the whole affair, he began to feel a bit queasy. Turning back inside, and pulling a cigarette out of his pocket, Grisham heard another scattering of machine-gun fire, accompanied by cheers below his apartment.
