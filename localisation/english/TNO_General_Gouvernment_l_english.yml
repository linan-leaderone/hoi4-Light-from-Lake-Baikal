 POL_underground_state:0 "The Underground State"
 POL_underground_state_desc:0 "Decades ago, the Wehrmacht overran Europe in a storm never seen before. Poland fought them bravely, odds stacked sky-high against them, until the bitter end - and with that end, the light of the Polish nation extinguished forever.\n\nOr that is what most of the world believes.\n\nOver the decades, it has become increasingly clear to Hans Frank's government in Krakau and a few watchful eyes beyond it that the Polish nation survives, nay, thrives in the shadows. Aided by the sheer incompetence of the General Government and their own shrewdness, the Polish Underground State is an ever-growing thorn in the side of the Reich and its hegemony over the Polish lands.\n\n§RAnd they have a clear goal.§!"
 
 #Tooltips
 POL_Warn:0 "§RThe people of Poland will finally be free from their oppressors, but the prospects of survival against a resurgent German juggernaut are very slim indeed.§!"

 ##### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS #####
 POLITICS_HANS_FRANK_DESC:0 "Hans Frank is the Nazi strongman of the Generalgouvernement of Poland, but to call him a strong leader would be giving far too much credit.\n\nOn paper, he has done his job more efficiently than any other leader in the Reich, having managed to Germanize Poland to a shocking 70% despite hardships and managing to have utterly routed and destroyed all signs of partisan activity.\n\nOf course, this idea only lasts as long as the paper trail is not followed to its end. In actuality, Poland is one of the least Germanized, least stable, and most failing regimes in the Nazi sphere, racked by the growing boldness of the Polish Underground State; the 'nation' seems to be nothing more than a hole in Germany. Hans Frank has found no solution to this, instead ruling from Krakow with methods described as 'borne from panic' and 'showing utter incompetence'. Thankfully, Hans at least has the power to shoot those who say this in public, truly the sign of political brilliance."
 POLITICS_INTERIMREGIERUNG_DESC:0 "With the Generalgouvernement once again under the German boot, a provisional interim government has been established on the orders of Martin Bormann to stabilize the region. Led by the most efficient German bureaucrats, the Interimregierung is preparing to seamlessly transfer power to the next Reichskommissar, who will be selected by the Führer when he deems fit."
 POLITICS_EDUARD_WAGNER_DESC:0 "The land that was once Poland lies at the center of the Reich, forming an essential connection between West and East. Now that Poland is won once and for good, a man who can make the trains run on time is required. A man with drive, with quiet dedication, and without scruples. This man is Eduard Wagner.\n\nIt is rare for a logistician to make a name for themselves, but as quartermaster-general Wagner rubbed noses with the likes of Himmler and Heydrich in 1939, yet avoided falling into their parasitic sway. The enthusiasm with which he enforced security behind the front lines is admirable, coordinating Wehrmacht and Einsatzgruppen into a well oiled machine of pacification. As the Reich pushed yet further east his job became more and more difficult, but Wagner was no yes-man to kowtow to demands from on high. Expressing his concerns over the fuel situation to Hitler may have earned him temporary ire, but gained him a reputation as a man who would never sugar-coat a situation. His opinion became highly sought after in the Wehrmacht, and while he remained sidelined his influence grew.\n\nWagner's time out of the limelight makes him all the more eager to remain in it, and he will do whatever it takes to ensure there are no delays when passing through the heart of the Reich."
 POLITICS_THEODOR_KOCH_DESC:0 "The Reich is a machine - what better than an engineer to run one of its most vital components? As important as the Generalgovernement is to the Reich, it remains an underdeveloped backwater, a far cry from the German heartland it was meant to be incorporated into - this is where Theodor Koch comes in.\n\nA rifle is a beautiful thing, a machine of singular purpose that must work in every environment, under all conditions. Koch's stint at Mauser taught him to love the purity of the gun. There is no loyalty in business, however, and Koch soon took what he learned at Mauser and applied it with their government sponsored rivals at the Reichswerke. Carving out his own sphere within with an impressive blend of technical and business acumen, he has dominated the small arms sector of the conglomerate, guarding his technical secrets like a dragon hoards coins. With the reinstatement of the Generalgouvernement, he has found an opening.\n\nKoch's vision of the Generalgouvernement is one of twisting gears and winding conveyors, endless hands on endless factory floors working with one singular purpose - to arm the Reich. Check the maker's mark - rifle, pistol, helmet, bullet. GGN, one and all."
 POLITICS_WERNER_DOLLINGER_DESC:0 "Werner Dollinger is a rare sort - a reformist that is actually liked by the establishment. While his past studying economics and social studies might be suspicious to the more reactionary elements of the party, he did his duty in the Wehrmacht fighting in the fields of Russia like a true patriot. Since his duty ended, Dollinger has dutifully worked away in the realm of economic planning, serving his home state of Bayern with a skilled hand. Recently however, his own unique and quiet form of reformism has gained attention.\n\nDollinger found himself championed by the big fish of Bavarian industry in the bid for Governor-General. His high quality analyses and advanced fiscal predictions make him the ideal candidate for the consolidation of their interests in the underdeveloped backwater of what was once Poland, and his affable manner and views that stand on the more acceptable side of reformist earned him the support of the Party apparatus. If he does his job right, a balance might just be struck between German interests and Polish needs. Might."
