These men are the ones who have sided with the Burgundian System.\n\nThese men, once few in number, are now stronger than they've ever been.

Many fight for the Burgundian System and Aryanism. Some fight for Himmler. Very few fight for - or know of - Himmler's true plans.

After the signing of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration during the 1943 meeting, further amendments to the Declaration formalized the Sphere's status as an international political entity with its political, economic, and military sub-organizations.\n\nBeyond its few voluntary members, the Sphere is filled with colonial governments in all but name, geared towards serving their Japanese slaveholders. Most importantly, however, it serves as a further extension of the Imperial stranglehold.\n\nAs the Permanent Chairman State of the Sphere Governing Council and the Greater East Asian Peace Organization, we receive a significant portion of membership fees paid by Sphere members and possess the power to command the armed forces of our member states in a state of emergency.

Both Xinjing and Nanjing have to, thanks to their on-paper seniority, contribute a greater share into the Sphere's - or more accurately Japan's - defense and infrastructure fund.

Once, this territory and its people fought relentlessly to keep Japan from conquering them and their countrymen. Then, as the Japanese closed in on Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, proud heroes of the resistance in Chongqing, they had no choice but to abandon the United Front and save themselves. Two decades of suffering later, a new Front has been born and the Chinese people have reforged their bonds once more. Though some may decry the mission of overthrowing Japanese control as suicidal and a journey of suffering, there are no regrets to be found. It is better to say one resisted for a day and was cut down, unlike the dogs in Nanjing who serve Japan China on a silver platter.

In practice, however, it was a masterstroke for Italian foreign policy. Italy's central place in the Mediterranean, and the bounty from her overseas Empire has granted her the unofficial position of first among equals amidst the Triumvirate's Founders.\n\nThe alliance has been on the decline, and as Italy seems to be its primary beneficiary, she is also the nation that has been fighting the hardest to keep it intact.

What was a project in power projection for Italy and a way to shore up border concerns for Turkey was a matter of survival for Iberia, and as such Iberia fought for the formation and maintenance of the Triumvirate since its inception.\n\nBut times are different now. The Germans seem to be retracting inwards these days, or at least stagnating somewhat, and Iberia no longer feels the existential threat of the Reich loom over them so heavily anymore.

The Twentieth Century has seen great gains for the young republic, but with their massive successes, they have also gained much in the way of burdens, namely in the area of regional minorities that struggle ceaselessly against the nation. Turkey has needed breathing room to deal with these threats, and if nothing else the Triumvirate has provided exactly that.\n\nBut times change, and to survive, nations need to adapt to those changes. The Triumvirate is, to put it bluntly, a dying alliance. It no longer offers the security or support to Turkey that it once did, having evolved into a vanity project of Italian duces over the years.

A number of smaller nations find themselves in the orbit of one or more of these secondary powers and have, for one reason or another, petitioned the Founders for induction into the Triumvirate as a junior partner.\n\nThese nations maintain their legal autonomy and independence, but find their interests largely subordinated to that of the "Big Three" members of the Triumvirate both economically and in terms of foreign policy. This is all, of course, in exchange for the protection and security that the Triumvirate provides. Even still, many consider the inclusion within the Triumvirate to be more of a burden than an aid, because while they maintain their technical sovereignty over their own borders, everyone knows that Rome, Istanbul, and Madrid hold significant sway over the politicians in every one of the minor nations that seek out the Triumvirate."
TRI_Member_Client: "Triumvirate Client Member"
TRI_Member_Client_desc: "GDP Growth Boost: §R-2.5%§!\n\nLegally speaking, the various client states, puppet regimes, and regional authorities of the Triumvirate represent less of a junior or underclass of nations within the Triumvirate, and something more akin to tumors or growths off of their parent nations. The legal status of client states within the Triumvirate is murky, with the Founders desiring recognition for the full membership of their vassals, while also seeking to prevent the other two from doing the same.\n\nFor this reason, the status of clients and subordinate nations and regions will remain something of a grey area from now until the end of the alliance, which may be fast approaching. In spite of how little they truly gain from the alliance, the Triumvirate has thus far kept their master nations restrained and at peace with one another, but with the disintegration of the Triumvirate looking as likely as it is now, the smallest of nations have much to fear as the local juggernauts begin sharpening their knives..."

In the face of Trujillo's invasion, Port-au-Prince and the PPLN have agreed to put old grudges aside and work together to repel the Dominican offensive. Perhaps this shared struggle will bring the two together - or perhaps their agreement will collapse as soon as Trujillo is out of the picture. Who knows how the future will turn out? Let's just get through the present first."

Based primarily in Cameroon, the organization crosses borders and cultures, striving for one goal- freedom and unity for all Africans.\n\nPan-Africanism is not without its opponents, of course. The Germans and English occupy everything south of the Sahara, the Italians control much of what's left, and the rest is snapped up by Iberians and French alike, leaving only slivers free. Still, the PALF fights on, waiting for its opportunity- an opportunity which will surely come, for nothing can hold the African people down forever."

PALF_Satellite_desc: "Division Defense: §G+10%§!\nDivision Recovery Rate: §R-5%§!\n\nThis nation is a Liberated Satellite, and has been freed by the Pan-African Liberation Front from the forces of colonialism and reaction.

Of course, this alliance is one that exists out of necessity, as opposed to being a collection of nations within one sphere or another. In such circumstances as this, the WAA has no choice but to band together, lest it faces total collapse."

WAA_Protectorate_desc: "Entrenchment Speed: §G+10%§!\n\nThis nation is a West African Protectorate, and is under the supervision of one of the larger member nations within the West African Alliance. This protectorate status may have arisen out of willing collaboration, or through force of arms. No matter how this nation has ended up a protectorate of the Alliance, they depend on their allies both for military protection and internal stability. Without their allies within the Alliance to back them, the administration of this nation would be unlikely to survive for long. It is fortunate for them, then, that the West African Alliance is so willing to invest in their member nations."

FMA_Faction_desc: "Division Organization: §G+15%§!\nReinforce Rate: §G+10%§!\n\nThe last two decades have knocked the French giant flat on her back, but roots run deep in her former colonies. The French Military Alliance is, predictably, an alliance dominated by the Free French. Made up of nations in the French sphere of influence, whether out of goodwill or necessity, the FMA has drawn its line in the jungles of West Africa- here is where the radical Pan-Africans will be stopped, and here is where French influence will be restored.\n\nThe long term goal of the alliance is far more ambitious than power plays in the bombed-out ruins of West Africa- rather, the stated purpose of the FMA is the eventual reclamation of the homeland, 4,000 kilometers away. Though whether it'll ever achieve such a lofty goal is questionable, the current focus is clearly on affairs closer to home. Free France will reassert itself on the African stage, or it will die- and after all that's been sacrificed, the second is not an option."
FMA_Puppet: "French Military Puppet"
FMA_Puppet_desc: "Division Organization: §G+5%§!\nDivision Defense: §R-5%§!\nGDP to Sphere Leader Modifier: §Y5%§!\n\nA familiar flag waves over cities across West Africa- that of the French Tricolor, pulled from dusty boxes where they were stored twenty years ago to proudly fly again. However, not all of these flags fly over French cities outright. Instead, these flags signify the coming of a new kind of state to the region- that of the puppet government.\n\nComparable to the colonies of before, these states are tied to France in every way but name. Though their governments are led by native Africans, it's impossible to miss the French soldiers keeping order in the streets, nor is it possible to not notice how closely every decision lines up with the Free French's preferred line. Quickly, these citizens have picked up on the new, inescapable truth- they are nothing more than a stepping stone in de Gaulle's dream of reclaiming Metropolitan France."

This supervision is required to guarantee stability within the nation's territory, and to prop up its administration as it recovers. Born from the ashes of recent conflict and war, these supervised states are still unstable and in need of outside assistance in order to stay afloat.

There are still limits, as the control exercised by the French varies, with many retaining a notable degree of autonomy.\n\nNonetheless, French influence is pervasive - and they exercise deep control over the nation's economy. The end expectation is simple - the French expect that it is not a matter of if these nations will join the French Community in full - but when."

# Indonesian Civil War
INS_leader: "Central Government Leader"
INS_leader_desc: "The promises of the Garuda seemed broken at the outset of the war. Sukarno, founder and a hero of independence, faces down an unprecedented rebellion that had rent the Unitary Republic of Indonesia in twain. Sukarno is no stranger to dissent; he had faced separatist revolts within the nation before, and purged those who did not agree with his idea of unity in archipelago. "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika," the Garuda promised, its talons holding aloft the scroll that proclaimed the Sanskrit motto of "Unity in Diversity." Sukarno and his followers prepare themselves for a long war to uphold this ideal once more and again into eternity."

INS_loyalist: "Central Government Loyalist"
INS_loyalist_desc: "Comprised of emergency governments and loyal regional commands, the NKRI itself is split into four factions, one in each Sukarnoite strongholds in Djakarta, Soerabaja, Makassar, and Palembang. Each has differing interests to explain their alignment. Nonetheless, they present a united front against the rebel forces led by Hatta, and every hard-won victory would advance the loyalist cause that much more."

PRIM_leader: "PRIM Leader"
PRIM_leader_desc: "The promises of the Garuda seemed broken before the outset of the war. The ideal of unity and plurality, the overarching themes towards which every Indonesian nationalist should strive, were broken at every turn by the central government. Moehammad Hatta once counted himself among the most loyal of Sukarno's inner circle. Now, his disillusionment channeled the breakages the nation had suffered in the thirty years since the nation's independence, becoming a rebellion that spread like wildfire. The split ideals now hold themselves in martial contest and a brother spills a brother's blood."

PRIM_loyalist: "PRIM Loyalist"
PRIM_loyalist_desc: "Eclectic and mismatched, the forces of the Free Government of Indonesia nonetheless bring its strength to bear in the field. A theme unites them: a disdain against the central government that had festered since Sukarno decided to continue on the centralizing course first decided by the Sidik government. Comprising of military councils led by colonels in various parts of the country, Islamists in South Sulawesi, separatists in Atjeh, and communist militias in Madiun and Soerakarta, they face a united front presented by the NKRI government."
