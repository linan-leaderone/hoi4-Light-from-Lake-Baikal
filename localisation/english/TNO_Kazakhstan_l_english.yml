 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 KAZ_Dinmukhamed_Kunaev: "Dinmukhamed Kunaev"
 POLITICS_DINMUKHAMED_KUNAEV_DESC: "When Dinmukhamed Kunaev was chosen as the new First Secretary of the QKP, he inherited a miracle. Secretary Shayakhmetov had guided Kazakhstan through a decade that should have been its end, through two disasters which could have spelt its destruction. With him ill, it is up to Kunaev to steer Kazakhstan through another decade of success in isolation. Kunaev, at least, believes he is up for the challenge.\n\nYet even as Kazakhstan survives, the scars of its past remain, and new wounds appear every day. After years of neglect and damage, the Kazakh people are barely a plurality in their own nation. To the north, an endless population of refugees and bandits seem to spill forth, threatening to tilt the scales even further. And even now, relics from the era of Stalin and Bukharin remain, ready to intercede if Kazakhstan does not go their way.\n\nSo far, Kunaev has managed to steer the ship through his own vision, increasingly untethered from the ideals of his predecessor. As a long-time supporter of Kazakh industry and culture, he has focused on promoting Kazakh citizens over Russian exiles, emphasizing local industry even further than his predecessor.\n\nBut many disagree with these policies, from Fitin to Yusupov to even Shayakhmetov himself. There is a fear in the air - to many, upsetting the balance between Russian and Kazakh seems a recipe for disaster. Kunaev believes Kazakhstan will last another decade, stronger and more independent than ever. It seems the world may not agree."
 KAZ_Ismail_Yusupov: "Ismail Yusupov"
 POLITICS_ISMAIL_YUSUPOV_DESC: "As Kazakhstan grows more ethnically divided and more unstable, Ismail Yusupov has become increasingly not defined by what he is, but by what he is not. He may be a Uyghur, a war hero, a long-time bureaucrat, but what matters is this: He is not a Kazakh, and is not a Russian.\n\nAfter years as the Karaganda party secretary, Yusupov's unlikely rise to power came as a result of Kunaev's deposing. Yusupov, a plotter with middling importance, was expected to gain an important ministry, but nothing more. Yet when it became clear neither Fitin or Shayakhmetov would ascend to First Secretary, they began to seek out a moderate figure, without the resources to centralize power. Their choice was obvious.\n\nIt is not a glamorous rise, and Yusupov has many powerful 'allies' whose interests he must protect. But for Yusupov to truly survive, a greater problem must be solved. The independence question can no longer be ignored, and the ethnic battle over its outcome is fought more openly every day. A choice must be made - yet a choice will destroy the nation.\n\nAnd so Yusupov does not choose. His plans aim to unify both communities through industrial and agrarian projects, no matter the chauvinist demands of his backers. Should the Virgin Lands Campaign succeed, it may end the crisis without a bullet. Should it fail, the battle will only grow greater - and Yusupov, neither Kazakh nor Russian, will not survive it."
 KAZ_Pavel_Fitin: "Pavel Fitin"
 POLITICS_PAVEL_FITIN_DESC: "Over his illustrious career in Kazakhstan, Fitin has always seen this land as not just a nation but a redoubt. The union, so denigrated and destabilized in Russia, survives in Kazakhstan, an unbreakable bond between peoples and nations. When it became clear that Kunaev was ready to break that union, Fitin did what he must.\n\nQuickly, Pavel Fitin has promoted some token Kazakhs into the upper ranks, and attempted to assuage the public that stability and safety will soon return to the Kazakh SSR. For Russians and other exiles, it was a moment of celebration - the USSR, in all its glory, might soon return.\n\nBut already, he can tell that he has subtly miscalculated. The Kazakhs are not excited by the prospect of a new union - they are in the streets, angry that their representation is exiled or missing. And even as he tries to understand this rage, he can hear voices behind his back, Russian allies happy to see a world with them on top.\n\nIn truth, Pavel Fitin is a Russian. For Fitin, that fact is an endless frustration, a blatant contradiction between his soviet ideals and administrative realities. Yet it is also the truth which defines his government - its plans, its leadership, its language. Those around him, Kazakh and Russian, ask the same question: 'which will break first?'"
 KAZ_Stanislaw_Skrzeszewski: "Stanisław Skrzeszewski"
 POLITICS_STANISLAW_SKRZESZEWSKI_DESC: "In 1939, Stanisław Skrzeszewski watched as his own nation was destroyed, ripped in half by the flames of nationalism, left to rot away under the policies of mass extermination. His own group of Communist leaders, as well as a large mass of similar refugees, gradually made their way out of eastern Poland and eventually into Kazakhstan. In time, they lost all hope of returning. Kazakhstan became their new home, the last refuge for Polish society.\n\nNow, in the mid-sixties, it seems their new home will tear itself apart, victim to the same awful fate.\n\nSkrzeszewski should not be leading Kazakhstan. He is a leader of a minority community and he holds an important economic post - he is not a crucial political leader to the wider nation. He has been chosen because he is a minority, and the ethnic tensions in Kazakhstan have left Kazakhs and Russians incapable of working with each other. He is a stopgap - and with time, Kazakhstan will crush him as well."
 KAZ_Zhumabek_Tashenev: "Zhumabek Tashenev"
 POLITICS_ZHUMABEK_TASHENEV_DESC: "Since the era of Stalin, the Kazakh people have gradually grown independent. A new generation of thinkers in cities like Almaty see themselves not as continuing a Soviet project, but a uniquely Kazakh ideal, a series of values that allowed the Kazakh armies to protect Central Asia while so much of Russia fell into disunion. Zhumabek Tashenev, once just one of many such thinkers, now leads the nation.\n\nFrom first a series of publications and then an important post as deputy to Dinmukhamed Kunaev during his time in office, Tashenev has preached a vision of the Kazakh socialist government largely divorced from the wider Soviet project, citing a simple argument - the Soviet Union is no more. He sees the unwillingness to reorganize and redevelop as a concession to the Russians, and he has argued that this state of agrarian semi-independence only served to flatter the Russian imagination of Kazakhstan as their colony.\n\nAs civil war rages, he fears that he was right."
 KAZ_Sagadat_Nurmagambetov: "Sagadat Nurmagambetov"
 POLITICS_SAGADAT_NURMAGAMBETOV_DESC: "In times of trouble, patriots must be ready to take control by any means necessary. Sagadat Kozhakhmetovich Nurmagambetov understands this as he fights for the very concept of the Kazakh nation.\n\nNurmagambetov fought with distinction during the Great Patriotic War, earning a reputation as a war hero among the Kazakh people. While his peer Momyshuly found himself being purged, he continued to serve with honor in the army, proving himself once more during the West Russian War.\n\nAn admirer of Kunaev and his nationalist rhetoric, Nurmagambetov became one of the biggest representatives in the Kazakh armed forces. This made him an obvious target for Fitin after the Soviet Group's rise to power, leading to the army man's career withering away as Fitin attempted to push out any potential enemies.\n\nNurmagambetov was horrified at the thought of Kazakhstan once again becoming Russia's vassal, mutiny was the only recourse available to him. Now he leads his band of patriots in a struggle for independence, a fight for Kazakhstan to free itself from the anchor that is Russia."

 ### Commanders ###
 KAZ_Bauryzhan_Momyshuly: "Bauryzhan Momyshuly"
 #POLITICS_BAURYZHAN_MOMYSHULY_DESC: "General Bauyrzhan Momyshuly is a hero of both the Soviet Union and Kazakhstan and he will always be loyal to his two homelands. He hails from a humble background and worked various state jobs in Kazkahstan before being conscripted and eventually would lead multiple division in the war. Some have called Momyshuly an anti-Soviet Kazakh nationalist due to his love of Alash Orda poetry, a few even calling for his removal from the Soviet armed forces completely. His loyalities would be tested with the German invasion. Not only were his loyalties to the Soviet Union confirmed, but so was his loyalty to Leninist doctrine itself.\n\nWhen the war ended, Momyshuly quickly reorganized the forces and commanders that remained and reestablished the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. He now controls the most land and wields the strongest army in Kazakhstan. In his mind, the Soviet Union and communism has only been temporarily destroyed and is just waiting for a catalyst to revive it. He is determined to be that catalyst."

 ### Ideas ###
 KAZ_the_gates_of_hell: "The Gates of Hell"
 KAZ_the_gates_of_hell_desc: "Kazakhstan may be stable, but Russia has long been lost. With violence across its northern border, the border itself has become porous and weak, easily bypassed by the needy. For many northern regions, desperate Russians form a plurality of local figures, a body which requires resources many Kazakhs do not wish to give.\n\nThe border is a tenuous political landmine, waiting to be detonated properly. Someday, the Kazakhs will either open their gates to Russians, or shut them forever. Whichever choice is made will have a vast effect on both nations, for decades to come."
 KAZ_red_kenesary_watches: "A Red Kenesary Watches"
 KAZ_red_kenesary_watches_desc: "If one man defines Kazakhstan today, it is Zhumabay Shayakhmetov. To some, he is a despot, sullied by NKVD ties and dictatorial tendencies. Yet to most in Kazakhstan, he is a modern Kenesary - protector of the Kazakh people, ardent fighter for independence, who prevented Kazakhstan from falling to Nazi jackboot and formed it into a modern nation.\n\nToday, Shayakhmetov has retired, giving up the reins of the nation to a devoted mentee in Kunaev. But make no mistake - Shayakhmetov is as beloved in retirement as he was in power. If he speaks, the party will most certainly follow..."
 KAZ_spymasters_legion: "The Spymaster's Legion"
 KAZ_spymasters_legion_desc: "Step into any communist partisan's den or Russian party boss's office, and you might find a gift from Pavel Fitin. The head of the NKVD in Kazakhstan, he has ardently pushed for keeping the country invested in the wider world, despite the target this paints on his nation's back. His NKVD chapter functions as a parastate, burrowed deep in the nation, keeping tabs on a union in peril.\n\nFor now, the agreement goes both ways - Fitin helps the party if the party helps him. Yet without Shayakhmetov, the relationship is gradually straining. If the thread snaps, no one knows what might play out."
 KAZ_the_kazakh_identity_reforged: "The Kazakh Identity, Reforged"
 KAZ_the_kazakh_identity_reforged_desc: "In the cool evenings of Alma-Ata, residents gather in town squares, sharing stories, and singing folk songs. Children run through the streets, their laughter ringing in the air as they play games mimicking the deeds of Koblandy and Tengri. And in the bustling encampments out in the vast open steppes, soldiers laugh, their chests swelling with pride. At last, after enduring centuries of Russian domination, Kazakhstan may finally be free, and they will gladly lay their life to see that happen."
 KAZ_almaty_in_our_hands: "Almaty In Our Hands"
 KAZ_almaty_in_our_hands_desc: "The city of Almaty with its diverse population of almost equal parts Kazakhs and Russians led to initial concerns of a traitorous fifth column emerging. Fortunately, the loyal Kazakhs who dominate the surrounding rural hinterland assisted their countrymen in quickly overrunning any resistance. Now the one true Kazakh metropolis with all its industrial and economic might may lend its strength to liberation of the rest of her sisterlands."
 KAZ_the_momyshuly_doctrine: "The Momyshuly Doctrine"
 KAZ_the_momyshuly_doctrine_desc: "Under Momyshuly's watchful eye the Kazakh Armed Forces have been endlessly drilled in a more static adaptation of Soviet style defense-in-depth doctrine, preparing for a German invasion that would never come. This relatively inflexible approach has led to the Kazakhs initially being caught flat-footed by the more mobile Russian forces, a disadvantage they hope to make for in the sheer training and discipline of their general staff."
 KAZ_the_ship_survives_without_a_captain: "The Ship Survives, Without a Captain"
 KAZ_the_ship_survives_without_a_captain_desc: "While Kunaev may be gone, the First Secretary's work still lives on in the strong central government he spearheaded. Now that the reactionaries and chauvinists in the militias have shown their true colors, the administration is more united than ever, purged of the previous year's petty disputes. The same cannot be said for the jumped-up bandits that oppose them, who even now claw at each others throats. The First Secretary's legacy will prevail."
 KAZ_not_divided_but_torn: "Not Divided, But Torn"
 KAZ_not_divided_but_torn_desc: "Whatever bureaucracy exists is stretched to its limits. Departments wage war over jurisdiction. Project funding appears and disappears in the blink of an eye. Commissariats oscillate between loyalties to different governments. The idea of ministries ever regaining a semblance of order remains more a hopeful concept than a tangible reality."
 KAZ_orda_without_alash: "Orda Without Alash"
 KAZ_orda_without_alash_desc: "Sagadat Nurmagambetov commands an army without a state or a government. His men are not doctors, farmers, or politicians, they are soldiers fighting for what they believe is a just cause. However, their just cause is no substitute for a functioning administration. Nurmagambetov will learn this lesson the hard way as his army takes more and more land."
