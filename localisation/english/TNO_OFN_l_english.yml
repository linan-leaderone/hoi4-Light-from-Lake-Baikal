 OFN.1.t:0 "The South African Summit"
 OFN.1.desc:0 "The long awaited date of the American called 'Summit on the Policing Action in South Africa' has arrived. The United States delegate gave a rather spirited speech on the necessity for the OFN to come together for this battle, lest the organization begin to fall to the wayside. Points were made that the Einheitspakt's lack of cooperation led to the seeming death of Germany, and that Japan could never rely on a unified multi-national military response like only the OFN could organize. A hint of fear was pushed as well, with the American delegates attempting to make a point that failure to answer this threat would lead to the threats coming to the members of the OFN.\n\nWhile McNamara's speech received applause led by Deputy Secretary Stikker and other representatives from the various governments in exile, and some smaller approval from Canada and Australia's delegates, others seemed hesitant.\n\nThe most telling response came from the representatives from the West Indies, Guyana, and Iceland, all of whom had already voiced their disagreement with the war and their involvement. President Thorbergsson of Iceland, the nations first after the end of US military occupation last year with the death of General Meloy Jr. and known for his firey nationalist views, led the resistance to the proposal. Arguing that the various 'puppet states' to America have never had interest in American adventures, and decrying that they would never allow their blood to die on foreign soil, his own speech led to another round of applause from many other delegates.\n\nThe decision will ultimately be up to vote, and many wait with baited breath whether the OFN will prove itself as an alliance of steel or one of paper."
 OFN.1.a:0 "We vote for victory!"

 OFN.3.t:0 "Support Staff to Africa"
 OFN.3.desc:0 "Very far down south, there is a war going on. American General H. Howse has relayed a message that requests support staff to help with organizing hostipals and administrating logistics. Some volunteers have voiced their concerns with the temprature, afraid that they will not stand the heat. Anyways, the first group of men has already left Reykjavik, with destination Cape Town."
 OFN.3.a:0 "It's gonna be way too hot!"

 OFN.8.t:0 "We Must Send Men to Africa"
 OFN.8.desc:0 "The war in South Africa is raging on, and the Americans have requested us to mobilize forces to defend the freedom and democracy of the South African people. With the state of the Federation, this is certainly not the optimal time to send out troops we could sue to enforce the peace. Demands are demands and we realize we have no choice in the matter, so today we have sent out telegrams to various stations to call out for volunteers."
 OFN.8.a:0 "Okay, then"

 OFN.9.t:0 "Canada Must Help!"
 OFN.9.desc:0 "Formerly fellow commonwealth member, South Africa, is being invaded by Nazis! We should do what we can to help them, it is a long way from home, but when our Alliance calls upon us to rescue a nation from evil and tyranny, we must do what we can!"

 OFN.10.t:0 "The Church Endorse the War Efforts"
 OFN.10.desc:0 "The past week several congregations have encouraged their members to sign up for military service. They stress the unchristian values that national socialists espouse, and stresses the need to save the christian people of the Cape land. South Africa is the lone democracy in Africa, and it is our christian duty to protect the freedom and root out the evil, for the glory of God."

 OFN.13.t:0 "The Spirit of '76"
 OFN.13.desc:0 "Aboard Air Force One, Nixon rested in the President's private office, his neck craned over to read the daily briefing sitting on the desk. Alone with only the hum of the aircraft's engines filling the silence, the President skimmed through the papers, wielding a pen as he scribbled his thoughts onto the yellow notepad in his lap. Near the end of the briefing, Nixon paused, curiosity behind his eyes. He read the last paragraph slowly to himself before reaching for a nearby telephone.\n\nAn onboard CIA officer quietly stepped in, only to be met with Nixon's questioning, perhaps prying, tone. "What is this?" The officer's gaze switched between the President's and the briefing that lay on the desk. Was this some kind of joke?\n\n"...That would be your daily briefing, sir," uttered the puzzled officer.\n\n"I know what it is, goddamnit—I want to know what the hell it's talking about," Nixon growled. Turning the briefing so that it faced the officer, Nixon scooted forward and pointed to the last paragraph. The officer leaned forward, squinting his eyes. Finally realizing what troubled the President, he quickly straightened himself.\n\n"We've determined that the explosion in public support for intervention in the South African War is a social phenomenon more than anything else," the officer began clearly. "This support is subject to rapid change—a response to what happens on the frontlines. Furthermore, recent data suggests that our military personnel's performance relies on the public's support for their duties." Nixon silently nodded along.\n\n"We've also found that while many Americans believe the war is justified, this may not be the case for future conflicts." The officer paused, almost hesitant to continue. "I advise you to read the memorandum on West Africa for more details, Mr. President.""

 OFN.14.t:0 "Reports on Boer Atrocities Covers the Front Pages"
 OFN.14.desc:0 "Desmond, an active construction worker in New York City, heads to a grocery store to pick up the latest edition of the New York Times. He had a long conversation with a coworker about the South African War, and the conflict was still fresh in his mind as he left work today.\nThe man selected his copy from the grocery store counter and opened it, finding today's leading headline in bold: "WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA RAGES ON." Ever since war broke out between the Reichskommissars and the Republic, Desmond was known to be strongly apathetic towards it by those around him. After all, with what happened the last time America fought abroad, how was this going to be any different? He began reading about the recent German offensives ripping through the South African heartland and wondered why he was paying taxes to support such a pointless war. Once he reached the bottom of the article, a new bold headline appeared directly under it: "BOER MASSACRES TAKE HUNDREDS OF LIVES."\n\nDesmond couldn't believe what he was reading in this article. The Boers, supported by Germany, were brutally raping, enslaving, and killing women and children; at least 500 individuals suffered at the hands of the invading party, and the war was only just beginning. It was then that Desmond really saw the scope of the war and why it was so necessary for Americans to get involved: innocent, unarmed human lives were at stake. The man imagined what could have happened if his wife, daughter, and son were victims of the Boer atrocities. As he gave the cashier a handful of coins, he began to contemplate whether he really can support the war effort."
