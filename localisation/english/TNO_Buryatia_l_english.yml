 # Leaders #
 BRY_Valery_Sablin: "Valery Sablin"
 POLITICS_VALERY_SABLIN_DESC: "Born in Leningrad amidst the New Years' celebrations of 1939, Valery Sablin was only a child when his family was evacuated eastwards with the shattered remnants of the Presidium, even as his father, a naval officer, sailed forth to meet his doom against the Kriegsmarine. This sacrifice was never lost on Sablin, who had grown up dreaming of the Union he had barely known, and of the Revolution his father's father had fought in. Despite having reservations with Yagoda's leadership, Sablin willingly enlisted into the army as a commissar still, not out of a sense of loyalty to Yagoda's totalitarian empire, but out of perhaps foolish hope that deep within the halls of the few ramshackle military academies that still stood, he would find answers to his questions. Was this really what those who came before him wanted? All he found was disappointment. What few books he could find were censored beyond measure, and he knew the NKVD watched his every step.\n\nWhen the Central Siberian War set the east ablaze, Sablin did his duty, inspiring his men to fight for socialism and equality - the more those under his command looked to him for guidance, the more he wondered if he was truly on the right side. Eventually, the dam broke. Sablin, accompanied by a few loyal soldiers, stormed a radio tower and broadcast a message for all the east to hear. In it, Sablin spoke earnestly of the hardships the people of Russia faced, and spoke of his dream for a truly equal socialist state, free of the terror Yagoda imposed upon the people. He expected no one to listen - but they did. Men and women flocked to join him, the dreamers, the dissidents, and the youths. Now, Sablin and his revolutionaries fight for the future, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for their dream."

 BRY_uncertain_revolutionaries_desc: "The soldiers of the newly reformed Buryat ASSR consist of the young, the idealistic, and the desperate, united as one in their hope for a better life than what Yagoda's reign of terror gives them. Under the direction of Comrade Sablin, they fight with zeal against the enemies of the people.\n\nThough lacking proper equipment, and in many cases, proper training, their faith in a better world and their dedication to their missions ensure even ground with even the most battle-hardened NKVD division."

 BRY_ghost_of_bukharinism_desc: "Nikolai Bukharin's authoritarianism and economic policies may have helped doom his Union in the first place, but in his private moments, Comrade Sablin cannot help but wonder whether his theories had some merit to them. While of course Comrade Sablin is utterly dedicated to his ideals and principles, perhaps ruthless pragmatism is the best way to heal the scars across the Motherland?\n\nWhatever Comrade Sablin chooses to do, he knows the weight of his actions will forever rest on his shoulders."

 BRY_dissolving_the_nkvd_desc: "The hated NKVD is no more! Comrade Sablin has decided to completely dismantle the wretched force and individually charge each of its members for their crimes against the people under Yagoda in a triumph for the revolution.\n\nThose that chafed under its oppressive gaze can now rest easier as their fear of reprisals has subsided as one of the most despised institutions of the old USSR has been destroyed."
 BRY_reintegrate_the_nkvd: "Reintegrating the NKVD"
 BRY_reintegrate_the_nkvd_desc: "While some in our leadership would like to see the NKVD completely dismantled, Comrade Sablin has decided to reintegrate the force so that it will continue to protect the revolution from the reactionaries that surround us. This will mean restructuring the organization to rid it of the excesses of Yagoda's regime and punishing those that committed its worst crimes, provoking controversy from those who see this measure as a slap on the wrist and a betrayal of the values they fought for."

 BRY_the_new_siberian_plan: "The New Siberian Plan"
 BRY_the_new_NEP: "The NEP Reborn"
 BRY_the_new_NEP_desc: "The Revolution has returned to Central Siberia, and with it comes the burden of restoring living and economic conditions to the region. As such, our leadership has decreed an expansion of the NEP to fasten up recovery, growth, and general economic development via limited free markets for small businesses and cooperatives, as well as a focus on local development and industrialization."
 BRY_international_outreach_idea: "International Outreach"
 BRY_international_outreach_idea_desc: "In light of our recent expansion, we have solidified our position as one of the strongest bidders for the re-unification of Russia and the restoration of the Soviet Union. The final struggle for our nation is too vital to be left up to chance; we must acquire any advantage we can as well as allies, whether it be from our fellow socialists, united in the struggle against tyranny, or more reluctant partners from non-socialist states, such as the OFN. Regardless of where we receive aid, we must take all we can if we wish for our Revolution to succeed"

 ### Mutiny tree ###
 BRY_the_spark: "The Spark"
 BRY_the_spark_desc: "The time has come, comrades! For too long has the tyrant Yagoda sat in his ivory tower while the rest of us starved in the dirt. For too long have the corrupt men of the NKVD prowled the streets, taking our friends and family in the dead of night, never to be seen again. The will of the avenging proletariat shall put an end to this, lead by our Comrade-In-Arms, Valery Sablin, for it was he who first took a stand, he who first questioned the tyrant, he who looked death in the face and said 'No.'\n\nWith the aid of the Buryats, our ASSR has been reborn, and together, arm in arm, brothers and sisters, we will light the spark of revolution right under Yagoda's feet - and when the time comes, he will be consumed in its blaze."

 BRY_of_hope: "Of Hope"
 BRY_of_hope_desc: "Comrades, our revolution is not the rabid bite of a starving dog nor the feeble struggle of the doomed man. Our struggle is a glorious one, born from the suffering forced upon us by Yagoda and his NKVD; but more than that, it is the embodiment of the unending spirit of the hope of the people that one day, their struggles will be rewarded, and their struggles will not be in vain. To this end, measures must be done to inspire this hope in those who still fear the wrath of the NKVD. A revolution is nothing without the love and support of those it is fought for."

 BRY_for_our_families: "For Our Families"
 BRY_for_our_families_desc: "Without a family to love and true friends to rely on, what good is life? Comrade Sablin's speeches emphasize the important role of the family within a socialist's life. When not bogged down by oppressive tradition, love of family can be perhaps the strongest purpose, and as Comrade Sablin has learned from his own, the strongest motivation. Our partisans do not fight only for themselves, but for those that love them, and in this simple truth is why we will triumph over the NKVD in the end. We are not slaves to the Presidium's bureaucracy, or the terror of the NKVD's securocracy, but willing defenders of those we love."

 BRY_for_the_future: "For the Future"
 BRY_for_the_future_desc: "The Revolution will not end when Yagoda falls - and make no mistake comrades, he will fall, but we cannot make the same mistakes Comrade Lenin and Comrade Bukharin did before us. That mistake, Comrades, is to not have a clear vision for the post-revolution. If we are not disciplined here and now, marching to a single victory for all, we will lose our way, just as those before us were prone to do. Ever so slowly, the roots of a new Union begin to take shape, cautiously, slowly, but full of determination. Comrade Sablin is not a dictator nor a king; we do not fear him, we are not his slaves - no, we follow him because we believe in what he stands for. Our collective hope and determination will be the tinder that ignites the fires of the Soviet Phoenix."

 BRY_broadcast_the_message: "Broadcast the Message"
 BRY_broadcast_the_message_desc: "One of the greatest advantages at the ASSR's disposal is the radio towers scattered across the Buryat landscape, instruments with which we can inform the populace - and the enemy - of the Revolution.\n\nOur second greatest weapon is Comrade Sablin himself. With his speeches, passionate and rousing, none will be able to deny that we are fighting for a just and fair cause. Comrade Sablin will make nightly radio addresses to the people, keeping them informed on the fight and rallying the cause around him. With this powerful tool, we will ensure that all will be on the side of the Revolution."

 BRY_nothing_to_lose: "Nothing to Lose But Your Chains"
 BRY_nothing_to_lose_desc: "Come, comrades, join our righteous struggle! Dream of a world in which no man is a slave, no man is subject to the cruel whip or the bullet, a world where democracy and the worker come before all! We can make this world a reality, comrades, all we need is your strength, your anger, and your hope. Join with us, comrades, and together we will save the Motherland from the strife that engulfs it, and usher in a new age of peace and prosperity!"

 BRY_of_equality: "Of Equality"
 BRY_of_equality_desc: "It is not just the men of the Buryat ASSR that fight for their freedom, Comrades. All brave sons and daughters of the revolution fight together in this struggle against the tyrants, as the great architects of socialism desired. Arm in arm, working men and women will liberate themselves from Yagoda's vicious gaze. While women in our makeshift army are currently restricted to nurses and scouts, Comrade Sablin has begun to push for reforms in these policies. Every man or woman will do their share to liberate Buryatia."

 BRY_the_dreams_of_those_before: "The Dreams of Those Before"
 BRY_the_dreams_of_those_before_desc: "A seemingly-forgotten aspect of the October Revolution was a strong focus on women's rights. As Lenin wrote when discussing the new Bolshevik Russia, "We are bringing the women into the social economy, into legislation and government." We must follow in his example.\n\nAs of now, women serve next to men in the armed forces, although behind the front lines they are still stifled by the same oppressive traditions as elsewhere in the Motherland, something Comrade Sablin wishes to see gone. To this end, social programs will be created to rapidly give women a bigger role in the ASSR's wartime economy, and Comrade Sablin works day and night with his cabinet to draw up a plan for more elaborate social reform. The ASSR will not be a beacon of bigotry and tradition, but of glorious progress."

 BRY_and_the_will_of_us_today: "And the Will of Us Today"
 BRY_and_the_will_of_us_today_desc: "The time has come to finish our reforms in regards to the social status of women, at least for now. Comrade Sablin has declared, as a wartime measure, that women are to be treated essentially identically as men, including methods of work, the law, and the draft. While this is a rather patchwork solution, it is a necessary one for now.\n\nIf we are to win this war, we need all hands on deck."

 BRY_of_anger: "Of Anger"
 BRY_of_anger_desc: "While Comrade Sablin's reforms and dreams are a revolution in and of themselves, we must not forget our war is not one of gradual, tolerant reform, but a bitter fight for survival and justice itself. Throughout the ASSR, there is not one man, woman, or children that has not felt the bitter sting of loss; all have felt the cold bite of the NKVD's perverted mockery of justice.\n\nThis, comrades, is the greatest reason for our struggle. We are not only fighting for a better world, and we are not only fighting for a better Union - we fight for our very survival. Already, partisans loose their fury upon the NKVD, and if we are to ever defeat the tyrants, we can do nothing but intensify these attacks.

 BRY_answers_for_their_crimes_desc: "The question of what to do with captured NKVD officers is one that has weighed heavily on Comrade Sablin's mind. One side of the rebellion calls for rehabilitation, for the prisoners to be able to redeem themselves and reintegrate into society. The other calls for revenge, or at the very least imprisonment.\n\nComrade Sablin has thus decided that wartime tribunals will be established, where each man will be given a fair trial and will be given either rehabilitative measures or punitive ones. However, Comrade Sablin has made it abundantly clear that under no circumstances will executions be performed.\n\nWe are not barbarians like them."

Discriminated against by Yagoda's government under the thin guise of opposing 'reactionary groups', clearly a simple ruse designed to hide their racism. Under Comrade Sablin, however, such things will not be tolerated.\n\nOrders have been given for the Buryats to be treated entirely equally to Russians and other minority groups, including the small number of Jews in our ranks. If we are to create a truly equal society, we must, indeed, treat our fellow man like man."

In the minds of the lost souls within Irkutsk, the ASSR is not a liberating force, it is an army of brigands, rapists, and killers, only out to plunder their riches and destroy the socialist paradise 'Comrade' Yagoda has worked so hard to build.\n\nOf course, this is utter nonsense, but those living under the yoke cannot, -must not- be blamed for their ignorance.

Let those who doubted our chances of success be crushed by the boot of Leninism. Nevertheless, our territory has been ravaged by war and much of the infrastructure we had was damaged. Our nation must now begin the reconstruction of the land and build a state much like the old Soviet state under Lenin.\n\nIf we want to unify the motherland and help the struggling Russians being oppressed by dictators and mismanaged by inept democracies, we must create a strong union that can fight for them. It is also necessary we create a model province to show our enemies we are the only ones who can create a perfect Russia. No one can stop the masses from achieving their goals in the end!"

 BRY_stoke_the_fires_desc: "Let us promote our revolutionary ideals to make a better society. People have become lethargic and fearful because of the brutality and terror tactics of Yagoda, but cruelty is not what socialism should be about. The workers should love their government, not be scared of it. Socialism is not the dread of what punishment is to come, but the anticipation of what reward is to be made.\n\nFor socialism to work it is in dire need of the support of the people. That is where Yagoda failed, but we will succeed.\n\nTo achieve this we will need some propaganda. We must appear as a loving and caring government to the populace. Posters will be around every corner and the radios will be filled with revolutionary messages! Likewise, we must also give more rights to the laborers in the factories and farms. We will have support in no time!"

This is a huge issue for our appearance to the other warlords and if we want to be a Leninist state, we have to look like one. We must take care of this problem at once. Women deserve rights just like men.\n\nOld traditions must be destroyed to pave the way towards progress. We can't let the people be oppressed any longer! Once we achieve the social revolution there will be no stopping what is right. If people have more rights they will work harder. The ancient beliefs and customs that are not compatible with socialism will be ended. After all, everyone must be equal if we want to accomplish the revolution."

Why can't they fight on the front lines or work as medics in the field hospitals?\n\nWe shall promptly decree an order to make women equal to men in army capacity. Female battalions will be a staple of our army. All people are comrades, not just the men, but the women too. Our enemies will fear our female soldiers just as much as any man!"

In those lands not yet claimed by the fascists, he employs an insidious method to mask his intentions. A mask forms upon the contours of his face. Slowly, he morphs into something new; a "rational moderate."\n\nQuick to support theoretical causes, he will suffer no discomfort acknowledging a position's moral righteousness. Oh yes, the cause is surely just.\n\nHis contention however, appears upon any real implementation. "Is it time?" he cries, "Why must you alienate the people with such swift changes"?\n\nAfter an enlightening conversation with Comrade Pechuro, Comrade Sablin has seen the truth behind these nefarious lies. The socialist woman will be equal to the man in all matters. As an inseparable aspect of Bourgeois culture, sex based societal roles must become a thing of the past. Let the "moderates" shout. Our cause aligns with the highest ideals of Lenin and Marx. We shall not drag our feet!"

 BRY_place_the_dominoes_desc: "Comrade Sablin has stated his views on the matter many times. The revolutionary woman is to be equal to the revolutionary man.\n\nHowever, unlike many of his other contentions, these claims have fallen on mostly deaf ears. The Soviet people, disparate and embroiled in chaos, have adopted quite a few reactionary attitudes over these last decades. In addition, centuries of traditional Russian culture have aided few in challenging these thoughts.\n\nWhile the goals of Comrade Pechuro and other feminist figures are undeniably admirable, they are also incredibly naive. Our fledgling state was created to represent the will of the masses, not simply to force doctrines upon them from above. Instead of a hasty and radical policy that is sure to cause backlash, Comrade Braun has proposed more gradual reforms. The people must become warm to revolutionary morals, not be thrust into them. Hopefully, a policy such as this will eventually lead to gender equality, as opposed to a harmful reactionary resistance."

With the destruction of bourgeois property relations, the expansion of welfare, and the reordering of society, conditions are rapidly changing.\n\nNo longer forced to pry an existence from the hands of their masters, the women of the Soviet Union enjoy many benefits. Freed from wage labour, they now have time for jovial pursuits. Adequate attention can be safely given to family, career, duty, and happiness.\n\nIn addition, mothers no longer suffer the indignity of working alongside their child. Public schooling and relaxed quotas have ensured a better upbringing, and an end to any lingering child labour.\n\nThe extent of our policy may vary, but it is undeniable that the socialist woman has become emancipated by the revolution."

Even now, the working men and women of Buryatia languish under old laws from decades past, and are forced to make do with a barely functioning industrial sector. With our comrades in labor crying out for justice, the time has come to rush to their aid.\n\nThe General Secretary shall work to personally ensure that the rights of the worker in the new Union are guaranteed. All of these reforms, however, will be for naught if our people cannot find work! To remedy this, we must begin a large-scale overhaul of our dilapidated factories to both provide ample work opportunities for the people and bring our industry back to life.\n\nIn the end, all of our efforts will serve as a powerful statement of our new government's goals: the Union will always fight for the working man!"

Now that the tyrant has been dealt with, we must take care not to fall victim to the same mistakes. To that end, we will bring the workers' councils of Buryatia into the fold and elevate them to a far more meaningful place in our new government.\n\nAlthough Comrade Sablin shall remain as General Secretary to help guide the revolution through this turbulent era, we will give the councils even greater freedom so that they may properly uphold the liberty of the workers. With these reforms, we will have taken a powerful step towards our ultimate goal of creating a truly free workers' paradise, where no voice goes unheard."

Now, however, it is becoming clear that the situation is not any less dire than it was before our victory. We must learn to accept that our position is still far from secure, and one false move could place all of our achievements in jeopardy. Therefore, the centralized authority that we established during the rebellion must remain as-is, to allow us to more effectively safeguard the revolution.\n\nSome in the council may see this temporary policy as a betrayal of the ideals we champion so loudly. Great reforms are indeed on the horizon, but for now we must first take every precaution necessary to ensure that our young Union survives."

The Soviet councils unanimously call for construction projects to repair the factories and give the labourers stable jobs. The support of the Soviet councils is integral to Sablin's power base and following the workers' needs very much appeals to Sablin's idealization of Marx and Lenin."

 BRY_repair_the_roads: "Repair the Roads"
 BRY_repair_the_roads_desc: "Much of the Siberian infrastructure was also destroyed in the uprising against Yagoda, and many soldiers are calling for repairing the roads to maintain steadfast positions in the upcoming wars. Sablin does have the power to override the Soviet council's calls to repair the factories to help the revolution spread further. Should he override the Soviet council's recommendation, this sets the precedent that the state's power lies in Sablin, which he feels is a betrayal of the workers. At the same time, rebuilding the infrastructure would help in spreading the revolution to our neighbors."

The factories are alive with the sound of machinery and power tools at work, the roads are busy with traffic once more, and the workers are once again toiling away to create a better future for all of us! Yet again we have accomplished the impossible, and our efforts have imbued new life into the region. Soon the industrial potential of the entire region will be fulfilled to its utmost, and we will have a strong base from which we can continue to spread the revolution across Russia.\n\nMost importantly of all however, the common folk of Buryatia have finally been able to live better lives. With plenty of jobs available for all, the people have finally been emancipated from the lingering dread of poverty and hunger. The wheels of labor have begun to turn, and there will be no stopping them any time soon!"

Dozens of officials and politicians from the dismantled administration now sit in something of a limbo, awaiting whatever may come next. If our reconstruction efforts are to continue unimpeded, we must now decide what to do with these people.\n\nWhile their skills would undoubtedly be of great use to us, we cannot ignore the fact that they served a murderous regime with little complaint.

The top officials of the infamous secret police force that served as the terror of so many for so long will finally be put on trial in the people's court. Justice will be served, but unlike our enemies we have elected to do so with fairness and honesty. They will be prosecuted like any other, and will be given the chance to defend themselves.\n\nAlthough these men would never show us the same mercies given the chance, we must prove to the people that we are not the same monsters that once reigned in Irkutsk. By avoiding a humiliating show trial in a kangaroo court, we will demonstrate that both friend and foe will be given the benefit of the doubt, and that justice will always prevail in our new Russia."

 BRY_justice_for_the_bereaved_desc: "Now that the trial has concluded, the question remains of what will become of the NKVD itself. During the related council meetings, much of the radicals have loudly argued that the NKVD played an unmistakable role in the oppression of millions during the days of the old Soviet Union, and that the only way to avoid losing sight of our ideals is to do away with the infamous secret police force once and for all.\n\nBeing all too familiar with the horror stories associated with the organization, their words resonated well with Sablin, who has rightfully decided to completely dismantle the NKVD for good. We will begin to judge each individual member of the NKVD and determine the severity of their individual crimes. For those who are found to have committed countless crimes against the people, we will lock up and throw away the key. As for the rest, there is a chance that they can repent for their crimes in the form of community service to the people and some may yet be allowed to reintegrate.\n\nSoon the people will never have to fear the paranoid reprisals of the secret police, and together we will move ever closer to our dreams of a true revolution!"

 BRY_a_chance_at_redemption: "A Chance at Redemption"
 BRY_a_chance_at_redemption_desc: "The trial is over, and since then there have been countless debates over what to do with the remnants of the NKVD. During these debates, Comrade Braun has proposed a rather controversial option. He insists that we still need some kind of special police force to ensure our revolution's long-term survival, and that incorporating the NKVD is necessary to fill this gap. This sentiment has been echoed by the older Bolsheviks, who argue that reintegrating the NKVD in some form would be a great benefit to us. Although Comrade Sablin knows that the organization was responsible for countless atrocities and injustices, he couldn't help but see the logic in Comrade Braun's words.\n\nTherefore, it is with a heavy heart that he has decided to begin the reintegration of the NKVD into our new government. This process will include a comprehensive restructuring of the organization, as well as further trials for members that have been found guilty of committing egregious crimes against the people.\n\nTo say that this move is controversial would be an understatement, but Sablin assures the skeptics in the Soviet council that they have nothing to fear. Our new NKVD will be rebuilt from the ground up to help protect the people, not terrorize them."

The revolution has begun anew, finally saved from traitorous and vile men. Now, the unspoken question lingers in the air. What comes next?\n\nComrade Braun, often struggling to compose himself, has strongly indicated his wishes to see the monster executed. In private talks with Sablin, he passionately argues his case. It would be disrespectful to those murdered to allow such a man to live, and exceedingly dangerous. According to him, Yagoda must serve as a symbol to all who would dare subvert the will of the masses to fulfill their own petty ends.\n\nHowever, Comrade Pechuro has emerged with a different approach. Believing that an execution will forever sully the moral character of the new state, Pechuro argues instead for lifetime imprisonment. According to her, the new union must rise above the barbarism of the past. In addition, she believes imprisonment sets no less effective an example.\n\nUltimately, the choice falls on Sablin's shoulders. Each day we remain undecided is another we anger our people. Something must be done with the old oppressor."

By killing this former oppressor, we set a dangerous precedent. Yagoda must serve as an example of the new character of our socialist state. Instead of committing an extrajudicial murder as the old NKVD would have, we will organize a public trial. Ultimately, we show more strength in restraint than violence."

What started as an impassioned speech in a radio tower, has grown into a mass movement. A simple rebellion; the spark needed to revive the socialist spirit.\n\nWe have achieved one seemingly impossible task, and with the end of tyranny we march towards another.

Now, having defeated the Irkutsk government, we stand atop pillars of sand.\n\nSocialism should not, cannot, be realized without the consent of the people.

For those of us who keep our idealism alive, the cruelest blows come from the hypocrisy of other idealists. Socialism, the greatest ideal of all, has been betrayed time and time again by so-called socialists.

 BRY_your_blood_for_liberty_desc: "What is one willing to sacrifice for the revolution? It is easy to make promises from the safety of home - but now it is time to challenge their truth. Revolution is not easy. It is not painless. It is a violent, dangerous, and demanding experience. It is not enough to support the revolution - one must be willing to die for it.\n\nThis truth must be impressed onto the people. Men and women must flock to the red banners, and turn their promises into action. In their hearts should burn a fire; a desire to fight, to sacrifice, and even to die, for the revolution.\n\nThese revolutionaries will give themselves to this war wholly, and from their blood, they shall ensure the liberation of Russia - and final triumph of the revolution."

 BRY_your_fervor_for_russia: "Your Fervor, for Russia"
 BRY_your_fervor_for_russia_desc: "Wars and revolutions are not successful merely because of sheer numbers, or superior equipment - fervor and spirit are just as important. Such fervor, vision, and passion were major reasons why the first Russian Revolution succeeded - and it is something we must emulate here.\n\nFervor is not simple propaganda spewed from the government mouthpieces - it is the encouragement of comrades, it is the vision of commissars, and it is the hope of the common worker. It is easy to fall to apathy; to despair, yet the words of a friendly comrade will restore the energy of the masses, and keep the spirit of revolution alive.\n\nIt is this energy we will harness - and cultivate. So long as this energy endures, revolutionary passion will grip the hearts of the people - and we shall be victorious."

 BRY_reinforce_the_veins: "Reinforce the Veins"
 BRY_reinforce_the_veins_desc: "The Far East is the most underdeveloped region of Russia - and this is something everyone knows, including our enemies.\n\nThe railway infrastructure that exists is damaged, outdated, and limited in scale - yet these rails are the only lifelines that exist across the frozen Far East. They are the arteries of our state, and no matter how limited they are, should they ever be damaged or severed, our defeat is assured.\n\nWe will begin to mitigate these vulnerabilities as best we can through defending critical junctures, expanding the rails where possible, repairing them where we cannot, and ensuring that we maintain our hold over these lifelines - no matter the cost."

 BRY_reinforce_supply_lines: "Reinforce Supply Lines"
 BRY_reinforce_supply_lines_desc: "In the deep tundra and steppe of the Far East, any army risks isolating itself. An army, it is said, marches on its stomach - but it also marches on bullets, medical supplies, lumber, steel, and more. We have done our best to ensure these vital supplies are available, but it will all be for naught if they cannot reach our troops.\n\nCurrently, our supply lines rely on railways. This presents its own problems. Sabotage, mechanical failure, and poor weather could spell an untimely and unpleasant end for our troops on the front line. In the conflicts to come, we cannot afford to waste valuable time repairing our trains. To mitigate our reliance on rail, we will construct supply depots along the path to alleviate this vulnerability. A well-maintained supply line is a vital component in any victory, and with the skill and ingenuity of our engineers and laborers, victory is but a hammer stroke away."

 BRY_refine_the_revolution: "Refine the Revolution"
 BRY_refine_the_revolution_desc: "Though we have beaten Yagoda and ushered in a new era of socialism in our corner of the Far East, we would be fools to regard our victory as flawless. Our rebellion was fought with spirit, determination and grit - but we will soon be marching into a different, more conventional, war.\n\nEvaluating our campaign against the Irkutsk government; studying where we misstepped and where we triumphed, we will become more aware of the shortcomings and advantages of our revolution. Now is not the time for arrogance, chest-thumping and self-aggrandizement - it is the time for realism, clarity, and humility.\n\nWith this knowledge in hand, we can better prepare for the wars to come, and fine-tune the Revolution into a force to be reckoned with."

 BRY_a_socialist_indoctrination: "A Socialist Indoctrination"
 BRY_a_socialist_indoctrination_desc: "Why do we fight? That is a question that every soldier must ask. For some, it is the promise of wealth. For others, it is for the ideals of democracy, or under the banner of Mass Reaction. Our soldiers, the heirs to Lenin's Bolsheviks, must never forget why they rise each morning and for what cause they end human life.\n\nSocialism is not just a political ideology, it is a way of life. To espouse a return to Lenin's ideals without transforming our army into a political body would be a tremendous risk to the survival of our Revolution. Every morning when he wakes, the soldier will don his uniform and hoist his weapon in the name of freedom, an end to slavery, and the new dawn of a socialist future."

 BRY_a_revolutionary_indoctrination: "A Revolutionary Indoctrination"
 BRY_a_revolutionary_indoctrination_desc: "Since the destruction of the USSR, we have lived in evil days. Reaction, fascism, capitalism, and debased forms of socialism have dominated our ravaged Motherland. We are standing at the threshold of history, much like the one Lenin stood at in 1917. Surrounded by monarchists, fascists, and Nazis, the observer might believe we are doomed. They are incorrect, for the fires of Revolution burn brightly in our hearts. Each soldier, worker, clerk, and farmer would march into Hell itself to bring the Revolution to the Far East, and then, the world.\n\nThis furnace within us all, stoked by theory and righteous surety in our cause, will burn away the darkness that surrounds us. We are the Vanguard of the People, and we will not go quietly into the night!"

 BRY_a_red_army_reborn: "A Red Army Reborn"
 BRY_a_red_army_reborn_desc: "Yesterday, we were but a collection of workers and mutineers with a dream and old rifles, shovels, and our grandfather's revolvers. Today, we are true soldiers of socialism. There are many "Red Armies" wandering the Russian wasteland, but today we have truly claimed the mantle as our own. We now possess a disciplined fighting force indoctrinated in the ways of war and in the principles of Lenin. In the coming months, we will forwards with pride, the Vanguard of the People crushing the forces of Reaction and bringing a red dawn over the Far East. The Red Army has returned at last, and all of Russia will rejoice at its coming."

 BRY_let_the_skies_be_claimed: "Let the Skies be Claimed"
 BRY_let_the_skies_be_claimed_desc: "Since the collapse of the USSR, few warlords have managed to put a single plane in the sky. The monarchists in Chita, however, have a small fleet of their own aircraft and will surely deploy them when war inevitably comes to the Far East. Air superiority is best countered with planes of our own. Anti-air weapons are good for defense, but AA guns cannot fly sorties over enemy territory.\n\nThere are a few aeronautical minds within our territory, minds that will be put swiftly to work thinking up new ways to get our new air force off the ground. Materials for aircraft will need to be gathered, air fields constructed, and pilots trained."

 BRY_die_for_the_cause: "Die for the Cause"
 BRY_die_for_the_cause_desc: "Revolutionaries have but one life to give for the socialist cause, but it shall be sold dearly. Their dedication to socialism soars above the petty devotion a priest feels for God. Beyond any rifle or bayonet, idealism, if not fanaticism, is our greatest weapon. A socialist soldier is not afraid of bullets or bombs, and spits in the face of the reactionary demons that plague our fallen Motherland. To destroy the monsters that haunt us, we will become more terrifying than their small minds could ever comprehend. We will not simply fight for the Revolution, we will die for it with a smile on our face. Not one inch of Mother Russia will be ceded to the enemy, no matter how much blood must be spilled."

 BRY_to_carry_the_torch_of_liberation: "To Carry the Torch of Liberation"
 BRY_to_carry_the_torch_of_liberation_desc: "The time has come at last. As our soldiers muster, vehicles rumble, and fighters soar overhead, the Far East waits with bated breath. Beyond our borders, slavery to fascism, capitalism, and reaction is rampant. Liberation is coming, heralded by the tramp of our boots and our voices raised in song. We ought to be proud: we have become everything Lenin espoused, a true weapon against Reaction and a shield to the downtrodden worker. When war comes, we will march gladly, for our victory is assured.\n\nThe light of Liberation is coming to the shadows cast by Harbin, and each of us bears a flame in the palm of our hand."

 BRY_the_red_terror_marches: "The Red Terror Marches"
 BRY_the_red_terror_marches_desc: "A flame burns brightly in the East.\n\nA towering inferno that melts away the time-frozen philosophies of Reaction. Stoking the fires of revolutionary passion, Comrade Sablin has coaxed forth a firestorm from the hearts of his countrymen. Boots stamp, aircraft howl overhead, and machines roar hungrily for fascist blood. Terror is a necessary evil here in our corner of the Russian wastes. The reactionaries should be afraid, for vengeance for all the grief they've wrought amongst the Russian worker is coming.\n\nRoar! Rage! Wrath and ruin for the enemies of the Revolution!"

 BRY_and_lenin_is_young_again: "And Lenin Is Young Again"
 BRY_and_lenin_is_young_again_desc: "If one was to tell a story of a young man who led a revolution against an old, corrupt bulwark of the Soviet establishment, and succeeded, they would be called delusional. Few would believe such a feat could succeed. Fewer still would have expected it to survive afterwards without collapsing into infighting, poverty, and division.\n\nSablin proved these assumptions false.\n\nNo more is this a simple revolution against the tyrants of old, it is the revitalization of socialism itself. Out of the ashes of the old USSR rises a true Soviet state, one uncorrupted by the excesses and oppression of the past. Under Sablin, the Far East stands united under socialism - and he will see Lenin's vision fully realized."

 BRY_a_new_red_october_desc: "The fascist heirs of White Harbin have been defeated, with their would-be Hetmans and Vozhds driven before us in disgrace. The madmen of the Arctic Circle, addicted to the opiates of reaction, have similarly been annihilated.\n\nMeanwhile, our brothers and sisters across the Far East, who stood so bravely against the tyrant Yagoda, have joined with us. The vast expanses of the Russian Far East have been united under our cause. A new revolution, however improbable, has begun, and we are ready to fight for it."

 BRY_raise_the_flag_of_lenin_desc: "Amidst the chaos of war, tyranny, and calamity, the ideals that drove the great October Revolution have too often been forgotten. Now, though, we have the opportunity to resurrect them.\n\nLet us go back to the original writings of Comrade Lenin, without whom none of this would be possible, and build a new state based upon his wise words. Through the ideas of Leninism, we can rise from the far stretches of Siberia, and bring all of Russia into revolution once more."
 
 BRY_the_state: "The State"
 BRY_the_state_desc: "Despite what some of Yagoda's propaganda leaflets may have said, we are not anarchists. A strong state will be necessary to the success of our revolution, and that state must be based on Leninist principles.\n\nThere must be democracy, based in the will of the people, and there must be ideological unity, based in the Marxist science. Only through such a state apparatus can we achieve our ultimate triumph."
 
 BRY_reform_the_sovnarkom: "Reform the Sovnarkom"
 BRY_reform_the_sovnarkom_desc: "The Council of People's Commissars, or Sovnarkom, was one of the original units of government established after the October Revolution. It was a council of officials, led by Lenin himself, who exercised ultimate governance over the new Soviet Union.\n\nSome within our government, such as Braun and Markheev, are advocating for resurrecting the Sovnarkom, to serve as the executive branch of our ever-expanding state. Such a choice would demonstrate the strong will of the state, but some worry that it would only serve to demonstrate a move towards tyranny."
 
 BRY_curse_infantile_disorders: "Cure Infantile Disorders"
 BRY_curse_infantile_disorders_desc: "Within our new union, there must be room for free discourse on all manner of pressing issues. With that said, we cannot allow potential threats to the state to exist all willy-nilly.\n\nIntellectual strains such as anarchism must be challenged publicly, and in some cases, there must be consequences for spreading them. If we allow political instability to foment itself within our territories, it could be fatal. That cannot be permitted."
 
 BRY_vsa_vlast_sovetam: "Vsa Vlast' Sovetam!"
 BRY_vsa_vlast_sovetam_desc: "The October Revolution provided the world with many maxims, but perhaps the most famous is "Vsa Vlast' Sovetam": All Power to the Soviets. The soviets of workers, peasants, soldiers, and sailors once wrested control of the nation from reactionaries and revisionists, and we must not abandon that legacy.\n\nWorkers' councils across our lands will be brought into the governing process, on the local and national level. Only through the efforts of these councils will a true proletarian democracy be possible."
 
 BRY_protect_proletarian_democracy: "Protect Proletarian Democracy"
 BRY_protect_proletarian_democracy_desc: "Democracy by the people, and not by far-removed bourgeois representatives, is the core of our government. It is a core that we must defend, formalize, and uphold. By granting more explicit powers to the workers' councils, and outlining the structures by which they will exercise those powers, we can make it clear to all of Russia that ours is a society in which self-government and the popular will reign supreme."
 
 BRY_the_revolution: "The Revolution"
 BRY_the_revolution_desc: "Comrades, we have not just founded a new state. We have not just conquered some petty warlords.\n\nWe have declared a second October Revolution, in the name of the workers, peasants, and soldiers of all Russia, and beyond. It is of the utmost importance that we uphold the ideals of our revolution, or all of our work will come to naught, and Russia will remain forever divided."
 
 BRY_decree_on_land: "Decree on Land"
 BRY_decree_on_land_desc: "Land reform, for many revolutionary governments, is one of the highest priorities. It should be the same for us. While there's no need to engage in mass collectivization and displacement, the Far East is hardly the world's most productive agricultural region. As such, agriculture here should be made more efficient.\n\nMore financial assistance and materiel should be sent to peasants to expand their production, and farming plots should be organized into more orderly arrangements. This way, we can use what we have with less waste, and produce more calories per acre. Armies march on their stomachs, but nations live on them, too."
 
 BRY_workers_decrees: "Workers' Decrees"
 BRY_workers_decrees_desc: "The well-being of the common laborer must be a top priority of our government. As such, the central government will put out a series of decrees, effective immediately, intended to safeguard their rights and protect against abuses.\n\nWorkers will be paid fair wages for their labor. Workdays will be altered to more reasonable lengths, with breaks provided. And the sorts of abuses that foremen used to subject their underlings to must be prevented from here on out. Perhaps workers were nothing more than cattle to be driven under Yagoda, but we must do better."

 BRY_declaration_of_rights_of_the_working_and_exploiting_people_desc: "In 1918, Comrade Lenin published the "Declaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited People". This document formed the basis of the Soviet Union's principle governing documents, and declared to the world that a workers' state had been founded in the former crucible of reaction.\n\nAs Comrade Lenin did in the past, we shall do in the present. We will draft our own "Declaration of Workers' Rights", declaring our dedication to all those who toil. Copies will be read aloud in town squares, and posted on public boards for all to see. Let nobody doubt our commitment to the workers of the world."

 BRY_raise_the_banner_of_freedom_desc: "The people of Russia do not just cry out for a strong, responsive government, or Leninist principles. Many simply cry out for peace, for stability, and for the promise that their futures will be brighter than their pasts. This ideal of liberation from the cycles of bloodshed that have characterized Russia for decades must be reached.\n\nWe must raise a banner of freedom high above our lands. Not just freedom for the worker, but freedom from fear, for all."
 
 BRY_likbez: "Defeating Child Vagrancy"
 BRY_likbez_desc: "The bloody wars of years past, and the grinding poverty of life in remote lands, have not been kind to the children of Siberia. Many are homeless, many more are destitute, and almost all are illiterate.\n\nWe have an opportunity to bring these children out of this squalor. Building new institutions of education and development will allow the youth of the Far East to create better lives than they could have under the rule of petty warlords and autocrats."
 
 BRY_centralize_the_education_system: "Centralize the Education System"
 BRY_centralize_the_education_system_desc: "In order to secure and uplift the next generation, we must ensure that our education system is top-notch. The hardliners of the party have proposed creating a new, centralized education system, composed of state-run schools that teach from state-supported curricula. Such a system would have a number of potential benefits.\n\nStudents would learn what we prioritize, and the long-term destabilizing effects of a diffuse education system would likely be avoided. This however would surely be a controversial choice for many nationalities and regions who are used to having a measure of autonomy."
 
 BRY_rely_on_autonomous_organizations: "Rely on Autonomous Organizations"
 BRY_rely_on_autonomous_organizations_desc: "Over the decades, the remoteness of Siberia and the destabilizing ravages of war have led to many communities establishing their own educational institutions. There are everything from village crèches to nascent agricultural colleges on offer, each with their own local loyalties and institutional memories. Not all of them follow our party line to the T. Some are even rumored to support reactionary religious traditions.\n\nIf we are to earn the allegiance of the lands which have recently come under our governance however, it would be prudent to allow these local schools to remain without much state interference. And anyway, it would certainly take less effort and fewer resources to do so."
 
 BRY_proletkult: "Proletkult"
 BRY_proletkult_desc: "All workers deserve bread, but they deserve roses, too. In the early days of the October Revolution, the new institution of "Proletkult" took hold. With state support, new art styles and cultural groups sprung up like mushrooms after the rain, giving workers access to creative outlets previously undreamt of.\n\nWe should revive this program, both as a way to expand our ideology and to boost morale across the nation. State funding and resources will be given to artists in the cities, to poets in the countryside, to factory-based theatre groups, and to many others besides. The glorification of the worker is our highest calling, and who better to make such glorious accomplishments than the workers themselves?"
 
 BRY_expanding_the_party: "Expanding the Party"
 BRY_expanding_the_party_desc: "The Communist Party is one of the primary organs of governance in our union. If it is to be representative of all the people of our union, it can't be an organization for the privileged and well-positioned. We should decrease the time required to become a member, reduce the number of committees involved in approving new members, and generally make party membership much less onerous to achieve.\n\nIn our popular proletarian democracy, bringing more people into the party will only make it stronger."
 
 BRY_the_komsomol_reborn: "The Komsomol Reborn!"
 BRY_the_komsomol_reborn_desc: "The original Young Pioneers and Komsomol were founded to help the values of the Communist Party reach the younger generations of Russia. Commissar Sablin himself was once a member, as were many of the idealist officers who joined his revolt. By reviving the Komsomol, we can bring a new generation of Siberian children into the party, and create a new generation that is loyal to our ideals above all."
 
 BRY_korenizatsiya: "Korenizatsiya"
 BRY_korenizatsiya_desc: "Korenizatsiya, or "setting down roots", was a policy of the early Soviet Union that sought to bring minorities into the governments of the various Soviet republics. Here in the Far East, such issues of political representation have long been a thorn in the side of many warlords. We can do better. By bringing more Buryats, Yakuts, and other peoples into government, we can create a truly pluralistic union, while challenging old chauvinistic ideas and ensuring the loyalty of our union's disparate populations."
 
 BRY_truly_democratic_centralism: "The New Lenin Levy"
 BRY_truly_democratic_centralism_desc: "While our reforms to the party membership process have yielded results, the ranks of the Communist Party are still woefully unrepresentative of our union as a whole.\n\nIn decades past, the "Lenin Levy", a mass enrollment of citizens into the party, helped to bring hundreds of thousands more into the governance of the Soviet Union. We should do something similar, and waive the application requirements for a large, representative portion of the population. This way, the workers and peasants of the Far East can truly see themselves in government, and in the political life of the nation."
 
 BRY_the_first_reformed_party_congress: "The First Reformed Party Congress"
 BRY_the_first_reformed_party_congress_desc: "The All-Union Communist Party, or VKP(b), governs supreme over a vast stretch of territory. Our triumph is clear, but our path remains murky, however strong our ideals may be.\n\nTwo primary factions exist within the party. There are the Bukharinists, led by people such as Markheev and Braun, and there are the nascent Sablinists, backed by people such as Pechuro and Ulanovskaya. They agree on much, but each faction has an approach to governing that the other cannot tolerate. While the Sablinists support the ideals that our new revolution was founded upon, the Bukharinists may know what it will take to keep the union alive.\n\nTherefore, to resolve these differences, we must call a party congress. It will be composed of delegates from soviets from across the nation, along with at-large representatives of the party. There, the nation, and its leader, will decide upon the direction that it will take on the road to liberation."

 BRY_economics_in_the_era_of_the_dictatorship_of_the_proletariat_desc: "Socialism is an economic-minded science. It was born out of the idea that a solution must be found to so few having so much while so many have so little. The transition to the state where everyone has what they have earned is our current goal. Keeping an eye on the economy and our progress is as important as anything else.\n\nRight now, we don't have enough military industry, our people lack housing, and we are nowhere near true socialism. It's time to get to work fixing this, and other economic issues that plague our people."
 
 BRY_council_of_workers_and_peasants_defense: "Centralized Organization of Force"
 BRY_council_of_workers_and_peasants_defense_desc: "True socialism is our goal. We know this, and nobody doubts it. However, Marx has said there must be a revolution before socialism, or even a dictatorship of the proletariat, can be achieved. And right now we find ourselves in that revolution.\n\nWe must defend our gains, even if that means putting our dreams on hold for now. At this moment, the people need guns, artillery, equipment, and trucks. We must provide them with these arms, just as surely as we must unite Russia under the red banner."
 
 BRY_prioritize_military_efforts: "Prioritize Military Efforts"
 BRY_prioritize_military_efforts_desc: "The development of the Red Army is our top concern, outweighing any civilian requirement. Thus, our efforts must go to it. That's not to say other requirements are entirely ignored. They will just have to make do with what is absolutely necessary. Any other funds we can spare must go towards producing more weapons for our forces. The people understand this just as well as we do. If we secure our country from warlordism and foreign invaders, we secure their livelihoods better than any social program."
 
 BRY_form_unions_of_firms: "Rebuild the Trusts"
 BRY_form_unions_of_firms_desc: "Despite their similar names, trusts in the Soviet Union were not vast capitalist monopolies, crushing any outsiders and making people pay exorbitant prices. Rather, they were merely organized groups of factories or enterprises, consolidated along vertical or horizontal lines. Bringing them back is obviously a top priority. In this way, we can easily group private operations together, and also more easily apply governmental regulation and supervision."
 
 BRY_gosplan: "A Single Office, a Single Factory"
 BRY_gosplan_desc: ""When the majority of the people begin independently and everywhere to keep such accounts and exercise such control over the capitalists (now converted into employees) and over the intellectual gentry who preserve their capitalist habits, this control will really become universal, general, and popular; and there will be no getting away from it, there will be 'nowhere to go'. The whole of society will have become a single office and a single factory, with equality of labor and pay."\n- Lenin"
 
 BRY_narkomfin: "Narkomfin"
 BRY_narkomfin_desc: "The Narkomfin building in Moscow was a renowned experiment in communal housing. A large apartment complex for families, it offered shared kitchens and laundry. The design was meant to intervene in the inhabitants' everyday lives, and instill communal and socialist values. It also was a renowned constructivist and avant-garde design. Though the design was never widely adopted, that doesn't mean we can't do the same thing. We have the plans, and we will build twin structures of this building all over the east."
 
 BRY_lessons_from_sokolnikov: "Lessons from Sokolnikov"
 BRY_lessons_from_sokolnikov_desc: "Grigori Sokolnikov was one of the first members of the Bolshevik party. An economist, he put much time and thought into the development of the first socialist economy. He argued that a high degree of centralization would be necessary for the Soviet economy to recover and expand. Following his ideas, we can start centralizing everything more. If we command, then everyone will follow. The whole economy must move as one, with the proletariat in charge."
 
 BRY_lessons_from_krestinsky: "Lessons from Krestinsky"
 BRY_lessons_from_krestinsky_desc: "Nikolay Krestinsky was one of the first members of the Bolshevik party. An economist, he put much time and thought into the development of the first socialist economy. He argued that a low degree of centralization would be sufficient for a socialist economy. And it does seem like he was correct. Allowing industries and enterprises to do their own thing without too much oversight is easier on us, and even a bit socialist. After all, they might know what needs to be done better than we do."
 
 BRY_supreme_soviet_of_the_peoples_economy: "Struggle with Bureaucratism"
 BRY_supreme_soviet_of_the_peoples_economy_desc: "The economy cannot be held back by layers of pencil-pushers and management layers in a far-off town. Progress must never be at the mercy of a number of people of dubious talent, with a mind towards political advancement. Who wants another system where a layer of management makes the decisions that govern the lives of the people anyway?\n\nWe will reduce the bureaucratic influence on our industry. Workplaces will be governed by a democratic system, where the workers make the decisions on what to produce and how much. This will free our civilian industry from neglect and mismanagement, and we will see tremendous growth in that sector."
 
 BRY_economic_decrees: "A Civilized Cooperation"
 BRY_economic_decrees_desc: ""All we actually need under the NEP is to organize the population of Russia in cooperative societies on a sufficiently large-scale, for we have now found the degree of combination of private interest, of private commercial interest, with state supervision and control of this interest, that degree of its subordination to the common interests which was formerly the stumbling block for very many socialists. Indeed, the power of the state over all large-scale means of production, political power in the hands of the proletariat, the alliance of this proletariat with the many millions of small and very small peasants, the assured proletarian leadership of the peasantry, etc. - is this not all that is necessary to build a complete socialist society out of cooperatives, out of cooperatives alone, ...under the NEP? ...It is still not the building of socialist society, but it is all that is necessary and sufficient for it." - Vladimir Lenin"
 
 BRY_democratic_glavki: "Democratic Glavki"
 BRY_democratic_glavki_desc: "Glavnye Upravleniya, or Glavki, are administrative departments of the major economic ministries. While the ministries themselves cover massive swaths of the economy, such as tourism or military production, the glavki deals with a single industrial sector, and manages it. For a while now, the glavki have been run by political appointments from on high. Comrade Sablin believes this should not be the case. The glavki must be opened to a great degree of democratization and worker input. These new glavki will be more important in civilian life as well, making the people see a direct correlation between their decisions and the impact on their lives."
 
 BRY_towards_an_association_of_free_and_equal_producers: "Association of Free and Equal Producers"
 BRY_towards_an_association_of_free_and_equal_producers_desc: "Free association is where the state no longer exists, no class or social hierarchies remain, and private ownership is abolished. Nobody is barred from the means of production, and everyone has the ability to fulfil their needs and material desires. This is the world that every socialist dreams of, and it is the world we are striving to create.\n\nUnfortunately, circumstances prevent us from establishing free association at this time. But there's nothing preventing us from getting close to that point. We will begin taking actions that will make our transition to that state easier. After all, everyone agrees getting there is difficult, and understands why we can't achieve that goal right now."
 
 BRY_narkomprod: "The Question of Famine"
 BRY_narkomprod_desc: "The Union is ill. Bandits, warlords and foreign powers prowl her lands. Even our bastion is not safe from instability and catastrophe. The most visible way this manifests itself is in the food supply. Our people cry out for bread, and there is not enough available.\n\nThis is a hard choice, as we only have a limited supply of money available. We can provide relief, but it comes at a cost to our industrial investments. We could tell our people to tighten their belts and get on with the job instead, an option that hardly anyone could stomach. But we must choose, because otherwise, we won't have a plan."
 
 BRY_prodnalog: "Maintain Food Austerity"
 BRY_prodnalog_desc: "This is the worst decision we have ever had to do. It's one that we regret having to. One that would betray the people we are supposed to help, and one that may shake the faith of those that trusted us. But we must make it. And we have no other choice.\n\nThe economy is just too important to be derailed every time a famine breaks out. We have to regulate the food supply and institute strict rationing. We can only hope for an eventual victory to save the people of the Union. Only once we have achieved our goal can we concentrate on providing the people with food relief."

But we're socialists, damn it, and if people are starving, we get them bread! The social cost of standing by and doing nothing is far too high, and would destroy us politically. If a famine starts, we rush aid to the affected areas, with no regard for the cost. It's the right thing to do, and it's the only thing our values would have us do."
 
 ### Regional Military Tree ###
 BRY_defending_the_revolution: "Defending the Revolution"
 BRY_defending_the_revolution_desc: "We don't exactly have the strongest army out there. Our forces are made up of groups of militia and partisan bands. We aren't an organized, professional force by any means. But that is not an excuse for poor performance. If we are a group of irregulars, we'll be the best group of irregulars you will find in this country. We will train hard in all types of terrain. We will have the best equipment, and as many men as we can muster. And it will be backed up by high morale and commissars to tell them what they are fighting for."
 
 BRY_expand_the_militias: "Expand the Militias"
 BRY_expand_the_militias_desc: "The militia system we have now was good for raiding neighbors and fighting against other militias, but things have changed. We are now creating a professional army, to compete with other professional armies. Groups of ill-equipped troops grouped together by locality with no regards to organizational structure are no longer acceptable. But that doesn't mean we can't tweak them a bit to make them fit.\n\nThe Red Army as we want it is a professional force, yes, but it is also backed up by numerous irregular forces in reserve. These will be called up to fill the lines in the event of war. These irregular units are direct descendants of the militias, and they will fill the same purpose."
 
 BRY_through_the_hills: "Through the Hills"
 BRY_through_the_hills_desc: "Our forces are extremely adept at fighting in the harsh and peculiar terrain of Eastern Siberia. Unfortunately, Russia is a big place, and it contains many types of terrain our local militias are inexperienced in. If we wish to win, then we must correct this. We will find mountains and plains, however few in number, and send our troops there for maneuvers. They will learn to live in the unfamiliar areas, they will learn to make them their home, and they will learn to fight in them. The enemies we face in the swaths of occupied Russia will find themselves confronted by forces as adept as they are in the battlefield."
 
 BRY_over_the_valleys: "Over the Valleys"
 BRY_over_the_valleys_desc: "Remember the hills? That was only the first part. Now, we train even more. More exercises, more courses, and more requirements. We will have the most prepared army we can field, and it will bring the revolution to all the lands of Russia.\n\nBut we won't just have survival courses in our training camps. We will also introduce new concepts to the recruits and our existing units. The implementation of armored vehicles will be a topic, as well as artillery and support battalions. Everything the old Red Army did, we will do, and moreso. Even a militiaman must understand that war isn't a test of men, it is fought with weapons as well. And these weapons can give us victory."
 
 BRY_partisans_no_more: "Partisans No More"
 BRY_partisans_no_more_desc: "Our partisans were fast to become a feared force to face on the battlefields of Russia, but they were always plagued by disorganization, they have been lions without leaders. However this will soon be changed, the free partisan bands will be incorporated into our army where they can be better coordinated.\n\nWe are partisans no more - we no longer have to hide in the shadows, we can come out and bring the fight to our enemies. The revolution will be well defended and its people properly protected."
 
 BRY_prepare_the_factories: "Prepare the Factories"
 BRY_prepare_the_factories_desc: "In the midst of the chaos that has engulfed Russia we have struggled to produce enough weapons to properly arm our military. At times it has seemed as if we had more partisans than guns.\n\nIn order to prevent this from ever occurring again, we will have to make further investments into our arms factories. Our soldiers will have to be sufficiently supplied - after all, fighting an enemy with twice as many men as rifles would be madness."
 
 BRY_discipline_the_men: "Discipline the Men"
 BRY_discipline_the_men_desc: "The men that make up our army are daring and devoted, yet they lack the proficiency that will be required of them if they are to fight effectively. More drills will be required if they are to become the professional force they need to be.\n\nWe are unlikely to ever be able to reach the levels of reliability that other warlords have achieved, nor could we ever hope to. But what we can assure is a proper Red Army, one capable of defending the principles and the peoples of our revolution."
 
 BRY_ready_the_commissars: "Ready the Commissars"
 BRY_ready_the_commissars_desc: "Commissars should not be employed to shoot those who run from the battlefield and persecute men who refuse to become soldiers. Such practices would only force our people to live in fear of us, when we should be the ones giving them their freedom.\n\nOur commissars shall not be used as tools of terror, they will be advisors and guides to our men thus building cohesion and raising morale. Two of the most important factors we will need to improve if we are to sufficiently strengthen our armed forces."
 
 BRY_an_ideological_struggle: "An Ideological Struggle"
 BRY_an_ideological_struggle_desc: "We have no reason to believe our soldiers lack the motivation to fight, but reinforcing their ideological fervor will only help embolden them. They will have to be reminded of the reasons they fight, our message to the men will be projected loud and clear:\n\nYou do not just fight for the Red Army, you fight for the revolution itself."
 
 BRY_krasnaya_armiya_vsekh_silney: "Krasnaya Armiya Veskh Silney!"
 BRY_krasnaya_armiya_vsekh_silney_desc: "Every necessary improvement to our army has been completed, it can now stand as an indomitable force, a force without an equal. Our soldiers, armed with their rifles and their revolutionary convictions, steadfastly await their opportunity to fight for our collective cause. Soon they will overcome all opposition and unite all our people into the revolution.\n\nWe are without doubt that they will succeed, we now look forward to the day our soldiers return home triumphant and we can all live alongside each other, unified and free."
 
 ### Regional Diplomacy Tree ###
 BRY_reaching_out_to_the_world: "Reaching Out to the World"
 BRY_reaching_out_to_the_world_desc: "We can not hope to bring socialism to Russia without aid from outside our borders, and we will have to accept it from anywhere we can. So we must step out into the world and accept all the help that we can, as long as it will benefit our revolutionary cause.\n\nOne day the Russian proletariat will once again become the vanguard of the global revolution, but first an international workers' alliance, an international workers' brotherhood, is needed. We shall stand opposed to national enmity and discord, to national exclusiveness. We are internationalists."
 
 BRY_the_new_union: "The New Union"
 BRY_the_new_union_desc: "The Revolution will need to have a fresh start to its foreign policy, one that is more orientated around the Organization of Free Nations. They may be tainted by capitalism, but they are the closest thing to a bastion of true freedom in this world.\n\nTo not work with them would leave us at the mercy of the fascists and imperialists that surround us. We will have to swallow our revolutionary pride and make friends with the enemy of our enemies."
 
 BRY_economic_ties_to_the_ofn: "Economic Ties to the OFN"
 BRY_economic_ties_to_the_ofn_desc: "With the Far East under control, we can look into the prospects of foreign investment. This is considered less out of a want for letting the capitalist system bleed into the nation, and more along the lines of being forced into cooperating with the capitalist forces that surround us on all sides. The least hostile and most favorable of these - though certainly still not friendly - would be the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nThe Central Committee has agreed to send a request for the OFN to invest into the Republic. This will not be a permanent affair. When the time comes, we will abolish these ties when they are no longer necessary to us. For the good of the revolution, however, we must seek aid wherver possible."
 
 BRY_red_realpolitik: "Red Realpolitik"
 BRY_red_realpolitik_desc: "Of course, we cannot also pretend to remain enemies with the United States of America. While they are an evil empire, the deeds of Germany and Japan far outstrip their own atrocities. A friendship born out of necessity is what Sablin argued in front of the Central Committee, and they reluctantly agreed.\n\nA proper diplomatic mission will begin, in order to coalesce relations between our two nations into something coherent."
 
 BRY_the_red_embassy: "The Red Embassy"
 BRY_the_red_embassy_desc: "The good news is that we're quickly thawing relations with the hyper-capitalist Americans. The bad is likewise. Still, nobody is complaining that there is now a superpower who is not openly hostile to our regime. There is much potential to be found in such an offer given to us - so much so that we have decided to begin building an embassy.\n\nOnce and for all, this will establish permanent relations, and will be a significant step forward in becoming friendlier with the U.S., for better or worse."
 
 BRY_stand_up_all_victims_of_oppression: "Arise, Ye Victims of Oppression!"
 BRY_stand_up_all_victims_of_oppression_desc: "We've interacted with the Americans - but that shouldn't stop us from approaching the other two superpowers. However, this time, we shall make no such attempt at friendship. As comrade Lenin spoke, imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism, and Japan soars at the top with degenerate evil.\n\nThe Republic shall make an open declaration; to all the evils of Japan, from bringing down the revolutionary hero Mao Zedong, to brutally oppressing the workers of Asia, the contradictions of the Japanese Empire shall lead to its collapse, and the workers of Asia will see liberation."
 
 BRY_back_on_the_world_stage: "Back on the World Stage"
 BRY_back_on_the_world_stage_desc: "No ground shall be given to the capitalist scum-- Sablin has come to this realization, and so has the Central Committee. They are a constantly subversive threat, mingling at first before undermining and destroying the revolution. Instead of dealing with any of the superpowers, we shall create a new alliance.\n\nOn our own terms."
 
 BRY_international_outreach: "International Outreach"
 BRY_international_outreach_desc: "Though socialism is a movement that sputters in the dark, beaten down by the evils of capitalism and fascism in a world that is sympathetic of both, there yet still exists the light of human progress. Some nations remain that follow the principles of socialism - some which may not necessarily follow our line of thinking, but we are not dogmatic fools.\n\nThose championing the cause of socialism will be befriended, and the Republic will begin forming a line of relations between all of them."
 
 BRY_our_comrades_in_latin_america: "Our Comrades in Latin America"
 BRY_our_comrades_in_latin_america_desc: "The region of Latin America has a constant history of reactionary terror, but there are glimmers of hope. Comrades across all of Latin America are fighting back against the reactionary and capitalist jackboot, from Che Guevara's Revolutionary Coordination Junta to the Bukharinists in Colombia. We shall provide support for all communist parties and organizations in Latin America, harking back to how Lenin said how it must be all workers who will work towards the revolution, and not only some."
 
 BRY_extend_economic_aid: "Extend Economic Aid"
 BRY_extend_economic_aid_desc: "We've found our own two feet in this world - however, many have not, and a number of socialist nations have found themselves surrounded by hostile powers, alone and threatened on all sides. With a rising socialist power like us on the horizon, we can set a precedent as a connector for all of socialism across the world.\n\nTo whoever we can, we shall send help and trade deals, and in turn, both they and us will prosper."
 
 BRY_the_tyrants_fear_our_might: "The Tyrants Fear Our Might!"
 BRY_the_tyrants_fear_our_might_desc: "The Germans are afraid of us. They always have been, judging by their attempted war of extermination against the many people who did not deserve it. The Reich's crimes are innumerable, but we shall decry all of them. In doing so, Sablin has decided that we will recognize ourselves not only as a growing socialist nation, but the direct successor to the Bukharinite USSR that existed before the fall.\n\nLong live the revolution; as long as we live, the fascist menace will know no peace!"
 
 BRY_unite_the_world_in_song: "Unite the World in Song"
 BRY_unite_the_world_in_song_desc: "We must take the final step. The banner of the revolution shall not be disunited. It cannot be, if it is ever to triumph. In that, we will be its founders, and the spark of freedom that was lost ever since our defeat at the hands of the Reich will be found and renewed once again.\n\nSoon, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin will find himself holding perhaps the most grand speech he's ever had to hold in his life, as he will call upon all the socialist parties in the world to come and attend in the city of Magadan. There, Sablin will proclaim the birthing of a new organization.\n\n§RThe Communist International.§!"

 BRY_in_lenins_footsteps_desc: "We have brought ourselves from the furthest, frozen shores of Lake Baikal, all the way to having dominion over the entirety of Siberia. Surely, if Comrade Lenin could see all that we have achieved, he would be proud. Still, we must continue to cement our rule and perfect our governance, in order to reunify the motherland and spread our revolution across all Russia."

 BRY_empower_the_nep: "Empower the NEP"
 BRY_empower_the_nep_desc: "No matter where we have brought under revolutionary rule, the circumstances have always been different. The territories of Magadan and the Amur were under the rule of fascist warlords, while Central Siberia has seen ultranationalists and feudalists hold sway over the years. Clearly, the transition to socialism will not be a quick thing. Instead, we should use the industrial programs of the New Economic Policy and the Siberian Plan to bring all of our territories to comparable levels of growth and development."

 BRY_endorse_small_business: "Endorse Small Business"
 BRY_endorse_small_business_desc: "The abolition of capitalism is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, our priority. However, we need to balance our ideological ambitions with the need to build our economy in the near-term. As such, it is acceptable for us to permit the formation of small businesses in local communities. There won't be any private conglomerates formed on our watch, of course, but small worker-owned enterprises will help to build wealth and develop our territories."
 
 BRY_apartment_construction_programs: "Apartment Construction Programs"
 BRY_apartment_construction_programs_desc: "In many of the cities and towns of Siberia, years of war and strife have prevented the construction of the housing stock that hundreds of thousands need. Ameliorating this should be one of our foremost goals as a government. By investing in the construction of new apartments in major population centers, we can ensure that one of the most basic needs-shelter-is met for all our people. The structures won't be gilded palaces, but they'll ensure that everyone has a roof over their heads and a dignified place to call home."
 
 BRY_a_war_on_homelessness: "A War on Homelessness"
 BRY_a_war_on_homelessness_desc: "Homelessness is a tragedy on the individual level, and a blight on the societal one. While our construction programs may be helping to ameliorate the problem, we need to ensure that the vagrants of Siberia always have a place to stay. In some cases, that might mean establishing temporary shelters, while in others, families may have to accommodate more people than expected in their homes. In the end, it will be worth it."
 
 BRY_destroy_monopoly: "Destroy Monopoly"
 BRY_destroy_monopoly_desc: "While we may be permitting the formation of small businesses and cooperatives, we must make it clear that monopolistic capitalist practices have no place in our union. We should investigate local landholders and business owners to make sure that there are no nascent monopolies forming. This way, temporary concessions to the market will not become permanent blocs of capital."
 
 BRY_look_to_bukharin: "Look to Bukharin"
 BRY_look_to_bukharin_desc: "Under Bukharin's rule, the Soviet Union aimed to use local development and industrialization schemes to bring the nation out of backwards feudalism and exploitative monopolistic capitalism. While our circumstances are not identical, our economic policies and initiatives should follow that same spirit of economic development and reconstruction as we build the base needed to reunite Russia."
 
 BRY_empower_the_party: "Empower the Party"
 BRY_empower_the_party_desc: "As we move to develop Siberia and reunite all of Russia under Soviet rule, it's important that we hold tight to the principles of party vanguardism. The All-Union Communist Party must retain, and even expand, its role in the governance of the state. This is the only way for our revolution to survive and flourish."
 
 BRY_the_rule_of_the_collective: "The Rule of the Collective"
 BRY_the_rule_of_the_collective_desc: "One of the main principles of the original Soviet Union's government was collective leadership. That is, duties and responsibilities are to be distributed amongst the members of the executive government. This way, no one person can amass a cult-like level of power, and accountability and dissent can improve governance, instead of dragging it down. Empowering our government committees and encouraging internal discourse will, likewise, help us to expand and thrive."
 
 BRY_replace_the_doubters: "Replace the Doubters"
 BRY_replace_the_doubters_desc: "There are some within the government, and even within the highest ranks of the party, who believe that our union is moving in a direction that is far too... hardline. Ulanovskaya and Pechuro, as is their right, have called a meeting of the Central Committee to discuss the possibility of reform. It is imperative, however, that we not let up. A few complaints cannot stall our revolution."
 
 BRY_celebrate_party_democracy: "Celebrate Party Democracy"
 BRY_celebrate_party_democracy_desc: "The All-Union Communist Party is the cornerstone of our government, and its existence ensures that the transition to socialism is guaranteed. Under our system of party democracy, governance is distributed amongst those who have shown themselves to be both meritorious and willing to strive for our revolution. There are structures for transparency, accountability, and efficient government action. This is something to be celebrated, not decried! Let us uphold democratic centralism and party democracy, which will carry us forward towards unification and revolution!"
 
 BRY_empower_the_revolution: "Empower the Revolution"
 BRY_empower_the_revolution_desc: "We have come so far, but there is still a long way to go before all of Russia is unified under the banner of Lenin. West Russia remains under the rule of reactionaries, to say nothing of the fascists and collaborators who still hold court in Moscow. Our union must prepare itself, militarily and diplomatically, for the struggles which have only just begun."
 
 BRY_a_truly_red_army: "A Truly Red Army"
 BRY_a_truly_red_army_desc: "We have found ourselves in control of vast swathes of territory, and vast new populations. As such, the challenges that the Red Army faces remain daunting. Morale and discipline must be reinforced if we are to be a power capable of reunifying all of Russia. The Army's political commissars will be given additional duties, and the power to carry them out. Training may need to become harsher. This will make things difficult for new recruits in the short term, but if that is what it takes, then that is what we will do. Our motherland's defense demands nothing less than strict dedication."
 
 BRY_a_grim_duty: "A Grim Duty"
 BRY_a_grim_duty_desc: "Some within our government might say that victory is worthless if we lose our souls in the process. But if we lose, we will have no souls regardless. The Red Army must do what is necessary to achieve the final victory our revolution needs. This means increasing training, obtaining more resources from the state, and, if need be, turning a blind eye to the excesses that may result from war. Perhaps it is not moral. But if our revolution was built on morals, it must be sustained by action, and defended at any cost."
 
 BRY_increase_international_outreach: "Increase International Outreach"
 BRY_increase_international_outreach_desc: "As we expand our territories and power, it is vital that we put more effort into our foreign policy. Obviously, the first candidates would be socialist states, such as that of Cuba, but we also need to reach out to the OFN. They may not be the friendliest towards Soviet-style socialism, but as allies against the reactionaries of Europe, they will be indispensable."
 
 BRY_friends_in_america: "Friends in America"
 BRY_friends_in_america_desc: "The United States, as the so-called "defender of the Free World", can be our strongest ally in the fighting to come. We should send a diplomatic message to them, making it clear that we want to establish further relations. Perhaps economic, material, and military aid will result. It is in both of our strategic interests to engage in this way, and Washington will undoubtedly recognize that."
 
 BRY_an_eternal_october: "An Eternal October"
 BRY_an_eternal_october_desc: "Our economic and infrastructure planning has helped to tie the nation together. Our commitment to the party has helped ensure that Marxism will reign supreme.

 BRY_the_dream_of_a_better_world_desc: "We were but a few dreamers, declaring our dream through a remote antenna near the eastern shore of Lake Baikal. We thought nobody would hear us, or that they would share our dream. But they did.\n\nWe were a warlord state on the most forgotten coast in the world. Nobody thought we could take over the much stronger and populous areas of Central Siberia - certainly not without compromising our ideals. But we did.\n\nNow, we have a massive chunk of the old union under our control. We prepare now to solidify our rule and take the rest in the climactic battle for Russia. And nobody, not even ourselves, is willing to doubt our dream now."
 
 BRY_all_power_to_the_worker: "All Power to the Worker"
 BRY_all_power_to_the_worker_desc: "Of course workers should be able to organize. What true socialist would be able to deny this? If something's wrong, the worker should get together with their comrades in the field and demand redress. If management refuses to change, then they can take action. Workers everywhere should be able to do it, and we've kept our workers from doing it for far too long.\n\nStarting now, anyone who wants to unionize their workplace into a trade union can. No restrictions, no retaliation, and no repression. If it isn't one of those disgusting "fascist unions," they can do it. It will be their right, but they know it is also their duty, if we are to have workplace democracy."

 BRY_upholding_democracy: "Upholding Democracy"
 BRY_upholding_democracy_desc: "Party leaders will no longer have the only say in Siberia's policy, it's time we allow the average person to weigh in. Every adult citizen will be granted the right to universal, direct, and secret ballot. They may then vote for Party or Independent candidates. A non-party member with no criminal record can run as an independent candidate too, if they have signatures from 1% of the area they wish to represent. Seats will then be split proportionally between party members and independent candidates. In this way, the representatives the people want can be at every table in Siberia."

 BRY_echoes_of_the_siberian_plan: "Echoes of the Siberian Plan"
 BRY_echoes_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "The Siberian Plan was Bukharin's major project. To turn the wastes of Central Siberia into a thriving hub of industry, one that would propel the Soviet Union into the modern age. Now, we may have plenty of well-reasoned objections to the way the plan was carried out, but we do have to admit the idea of a Siberia-based industrial powerhouse is tempting. Especially considering our current position.\n\nThe infrastructure laid down so long ago will be the basis of a new Siberian Plan. One that fits the needs of the working class, and not lofty dreams and quotas. One built not on the backs of political prisoners and the GULAG system, but with the full support of the working class. There's a foundation here, and we can build whatever we want on top of it."

 BRY_embracing_our_new_comrades: "Embracing Our New Comrades"
 BRY_embracing_our_new_comrades_desc: "Central Siberia is not like the East. There is a lot less coastline, for one thing. There is some more industry here, as well. But the main difference is that there are a lot more people here. A diverse group of people, who hold many ideologies, from socialism to bourgeois democracy, to whatever the hell "Rurik" was up to.\n\nThese people will be integrated into our political system. By introducing them to the civic duties of a socialist and espousing the benefits of our system, they will come to realize that we have the way of the future. Winning the support of the population will give us a larger number of workers to fight for our side."

 BRY_an_open_hand: "An Open Hand"
 BRY_an_open_hand_desc: "One must not forget what we are doing here. Our goal is not to crush the people of Siberia beneath the treads of revolution, but to uplift them into a new and brighter future. We are doing this for them, and if they don't recognise it at first, then we will show them through our actions.\n\nLet us go forth, holding ourselves to the highest of standards. We will unite Russia through kindness, and not simply purge those that disagree. We are doing this for the greatest cause the human race has known, and we must never forget that we are to behave as such."

 BRY_a_roof_over_every_head: "A Roof Over Every Head"
 BRY_a_roof_over_every_head_desc: "Times are tough. People are living on the streets or in poorly maintained huts and structures. Whole families go without roofs over their heads, or walls to give them their own privacy. We need to fix this problem, and in a way that does the most amount of good for the most people for the lowest cost. This means apartment blocks. With our efforts, we can guarantee every citizen can have a warm and private place away from the cold and snow. This may leave much to be desired in terms of urban design and is not the most luxurious accommodation, but it is worth the tradeoff to ensure our citizens do not want for housing."

 BRY_uplift_the_proletariat: "Uplift the Proletariat"
 BRY_uplift_the_proletariat_desc: "Some people think socialism is anti-industrial. Nonsense! Every socialist loves industry. It produces endless streams of affordable, quality, high-tech goods. It organizes workers into vast armies of labor, and gives them the means to make a living by whatever way they so choose. That's why we must provide more industry for the workers. Not only should every worker have a job in a factory, they must have available jobs in a variety of factories producing different goods. A vast industrial base is the way of the future, and it will liberate the impoverished masses of Central Siberia once and for all."

 BRY_a_tool_in_every_hand: "A Tool in Every Hand"
 BRY_a_tool_in_every_hand_desc: "Just having the tools and buildings isn't enough to make us an industrial power. We need more workers as well. And there's really only one source of potential new members of the proletariat in Siberia: peasants. We're not going to do anything harsh like seize their crops and force them to merge their plots for efficiency. But we are going to let them know about the greater benefits of urban life, as well as some more gentle measures to get them to realize that the future of Russia is not found on a tiny plot in the countryside."

 BRY_freedom_under_socialism: "Freedom Under Socialism"
 BRY_freedom_under_socialism_desc: "How can a society founded on solidarity and comradeship exclude those who are not of the largest ethnic group? How can we fight for freedom in the workplace and keep women in the home? Moreover, if we free ourselves from the conservative rules and social regulations to keep working people down, what right do we have to restrict what consenting adults can do? What good is freedom, if it is not shared by everyone?\n\nSocialism is liberation in all forms, and the Siberian Socialist Republic shall remember that."

 BRY_allow_minor_ideological_differences: "Allow Minor Ideological Differences"
 BRY_allow_minor_ideological_differences_desc: "We shall never allow Russia to ever again fall sway to the destructive and reactionary views of capitalism. Fascism will be eliminated from our lands. Bourgeois democracy is a stage we are well beyond. And monarchy is fundamentally a backwards ideology that will never rise up again. But does that mean we have to exclude every view that conflicts with our doctrine?\n\nAside from the Sablinites, the Communist Party has the more traditionally socialist Bukharinists and the Utopian Socialists. These sections of socialism, though not the ones we follow, still aren't a threat to the revolution, and could be left alone with little issue. And they might actually have a point about a few things we could do differently."

 BRY_unity_in_diversity: "Unity in Diversity"
 BRY_unity_in_diversity_desc: "Many states stamp out any thought that does not align exactly with the views of the leadership. Not in the Siberian Socialist Republic. Anarchists, Syndicalists, Bukharinists, Utopian Socialists, Sablinites, Leninists, Non-Party Members, they can all find a home here. We are building true socialism, and we must bring in input from every part of the Left. Our ability to tolerate many different types of thought is a great asset. Even if they have been historically hostile towards one another."

 BRY_liberation_not_annihilation: "Liberation, Not Annihilation"
 BRY_liberation_not_annihilation_desc: "We must clarify what the Red Army does, to all of our recruits. It is a force of the revolution, yes. But it is not just a blunt instrument to beat anybody we don't like with. It is a professional force that will liberate mankind, not shoot other warlords or raid outlying villages. We are doing this for the people of the villages and towns we take. We will not tolerate any hooliganism or harsh retaliatory methods in the areas we occupy. A Red Army soldier is a friend to the peoples of Russia, and not just another conqueror."

 BRY_the_commission_for_humane_warfare: "The Commission for Humane Warfare"
 BRY_the_commission_for_humane_warfare_desc: "War is hell, but it does not have to be unduly so. It is undeniable that troops under our command have committed crimes against civilians in the past, in ways which have harmed relations between the people and their supposed protectors. This cannot be allowed to continue. We should set up civilian oversight panels, party watchdog groups, and independent judicial structures to combat the potential excesses produced by an ongoing war. It may hamper the effectiveness of troops and draw some resources away from other uses, but it will be worth it."

 BRY.1.t: "The Revolution Reborn"
 BRY.1.desc: "As the Great Patriotic War shattered the Soviet Union, those that dwelled within the Buryat ASSR could not help but fear for the future. Even as Yagoda evacuated the government to the east, the always-looming fear of a Japanese or German strike was ever-present. Because of this, we did not complain when Yagoda expanded the NKVD's power - emergency measures, he said. We did not complain when the Presidium was purged - surely Comrade Yagoda had good intentions? Of course we did not complain when our neighbors were dragged off by men in the middle of the night, never to be seen again; surely they were traitors. When Comrade Yagoda consolidated his grip ever further, and the men came in the middle of the day, none thought any sane person would have the courage to speak out.\n\nAnd yet Comrade Sablin did. Emboldened by Yagoda's resounding defeat in the war with the Central Siberian Republic, he acted. A mere Commissar, only twenty-three years of age, but disgusted by the atrocities he had seen, he and his small amount of men stormed a radio tower, and broadcast his message for all to hear. This was not socialism, he said - this was not even a life worth living. Comrade Sablin called for those oppressed for so long by Yagoda's steel grasp to free themselves, to take a stand, to tell their oppressors "no".\n\nAnd they did. Comrade Sablin has declared the Buryat ASSR reborn, free from Yagoda's tyranny - for the moment. Even now, the NKVD march, determined to slaughter all who stand in their way. But their iron discipline and shining guns mean nothing.\n\nThanks to Comrade Sablin, we have tasted freedom, and we will die before it is taken from us."
 BRY.1.a: "The revolution marches on."
 
 BRY.2.t: "The Spark"
 BRY.2.desc: "Without breaking his stride, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin thrust open the doors of the Verkhneudinsk Opera House, bursting through the lobby into the theatre. Chairs shoved aside, it had been transformed into the beating heart of the revolution. Sablin felt the revolutionary fervor electrifying his comrades as they filled the cavernous space with noise and motion, could see the zeal in their eyes as they saluted him.\n\nMounting the stage in a single bound, Sablin barely got time to salute the Central Committee before he was lifted off his feet in a bear hug by Mikhail Markheev, the enormous ursine Buryat who commanded the mutiny's army.\n\n"Ah, comrade!" exalted Markheev as he released Sablin, "is the energy not infectious!" Smiling bashfully, Sablin glanced over his comrades as they stood around the table in the middle of the stage. Raising one eyebrow, his right-hand woman Susanna Pechuro smiled back at him as her inseparable companion Maya Ulanovskaya frowned, irritated by the distraction. Not looking up as he scrawled over the map in front of him, the craggy old German Otto Braun grumbled, "I believe we agreed that this meeting would begin over half an hour ago, Comrade Sablin."\n\nSauntering over with Markheev, Sablin looked over the chaotic jumble of maps. Most were pre-war, and had been hastily altered to reflect the grim realities of a shattered Russia. Shrugging off a brief pang of melancholy, Sablin grinned at his friends. "Ah, comrades, the great work continues! As we free ourselves of Yagoda's oppression, so too do I shrug off the tyranny of the clock!"\n\nBraun shot Sablin a look of irritated sufferance over the rims of his spectacles. Despite his jocularity, doubt gnawed at Sablin's heart. To prevail over the tyrant Yagoda, he had to be sure they had the will of the people. "Comrades," he began, "do the people truly favour us? We cannot win this war without the common folk united under our banner."\n\nPutting down his pen, Braun looked Sablin in the eye. "In my years in China, I learned to tell what the people think of their ruler. They hate Yagoda's reign of terror." Suddenly pensive, Markheev nodded, adding, "I can say with certainty that the Buryat people are with us, comrade."\n\n"Valera, our spark has lit the flame burning in the people's hearts. They are with us and no other," said Pechuro, smiling slightly. Doubt quashed, Sablin nodded, letting his comrades get back to the down-and-dirty aspects of the revolution. The spark. He liked that."
 BRY.2.a: "Sometimes, history needs a push."
 
 BRY.3.t: "Red Airwaves"
 BRY.3.desc: "Across Irkutsk, from the boreal depths to the gelid shores of Lake Baikal, the people sit in the squalor of their stinking communal huts and listen to their radios, those primordial relics from the half-remembered days of glory when a united Russia existed in more than just the minds of men. Clustering together, they find themselves warmed by more than each other's body heat as they lean in to better hear the crackling voice spilling into their homes like the disembodied voice of God.\n\nFizzing and sputtering, that voice calls itself Comrade Valery Sablin, and it speaks of a better life. Irkutsk's peasants, long-accustomed to their lives of penury and destitution, listen to the voice with rapt attention as it proclaims the virtue of the revolution sparked by the rebels in Buryatia, of equal rights and opportunities for all, of a resurgent Russia faithful to Marx and Lenin, a new Russia where all men together could reap the rewards of the people's prosperity.\n\nThe young men who were born into a shattered Russia barely heard the rest of the speech as they sat there in the darkness with lambent eyes, mouths hanging open as they learned that there is a better way to live if only they will act, and join the revolution. Though their elders shake their heads and frown, too scarred and broken to believe in deliverance, the young of Irkutsk feel an unfamiliar burning in their hearts, like a flicker of a flame long doused.\n\nFor the first time, they feel the spark of hope."
 BRY.3.a: "The peasantry cannot politcally generate its own rage."
 
 BRY.4.t: "Girls with Guns"
 BRY.4.desc: "Boots thumping on the cracked marble tiles, Sablin made his way through one of the Opera House's labyrinthine corridors. As always, he went without bodyguards. Unlike the tyrant Yagoda, Sablin didn't live in fear of one of his own men sinking a knife in his back. Nevertheless, he flinched as Pechuro and Ulanovskaya swept out of a room as he passed, stopping him in his tracks.\n\n"Susanna Solomovovna, Maya Aleksandrovna. What are the ladies of my heart working on this late in the night?" he asked, his grin fading as he saw the severity of their expressions.\n\n"Valera, Maya and I have been talking," said Pechuro, "and we insist on a change of policy. We must allow women to serve on the front line if the revolution is to triumph."\n\nStonily, Ulanovskaya added, "Indeed, Comrade Sablin. Markheev complains day and night of not having enough soldiers. Women may hold a gun the same as any other, so why are we restricted to only serving as nurses?"\n\nFor a moment, Sablin was speechless. He had never believed in the old idea that a woman's place was in the home, but the frontline? "I don't know, comrades. I believe in the liberty of women, but is combat the best way for women to serve the revolution?"\n\nUlanovskaya moved closer to Sablin, fire in her eyes. "Did not Lenin and Marx before him state that the revolution could not be accomplished without women? Comrade Sablin, the women of Russia wish nothing more than to take up arms in defence of the revolution!"\n\nSablin couldn't deny that she made a good point. And they were low on soldiers. "Very well, comrades," grinned Sablin as he looked between the two women, "convene the Central Committee. If Russia's women wish to fight alongside their husbands and sons, who am I to stand in their way?""
 BRY.4.a: "The success of the revolution depends on the extent to which women take part in it."
 
 BRY.5.t: "Sablinite Justice"
 BRY.5.desc: ""Roman Denisovich Kosaryov, this court of soldiers and workers finds you guilty of crimes against the socialist revolution and the common people of Russia."\n\nSitting in the dock, Roman bowed his head, fighting back tears, trying desperately to maintain his dignity. He could not face those judging faces arrayed in the gallery, staring at him with their vindictive eyes. Ah, so this was how it ended! Twenty-eight years old, his life consumed by the chaos and madness of a shattered Russia. Trying to cling to whatever sanity he could find, he had joined the NKVD and slowly risen through its ranks in the service of Yagoda and the Presidium.\n\nRoman could not say his hands were free of blood, but neither was he one of Yagoda's slavering dogs, chomping at the bit for any chance to kill. It wasn't as though he lacked sympathy for the ideals of the mutineers either, but could a mob of young idealists truly prevail over Siberia's would-be overlords and give birth to a new Russia? No; he had remained with Yagoda, deciding that the devil you knew was better than the unknown. Gritting his teeth, Roman flayed himself for sealing his own fate. It was all over now. In a few minutes, they would drag him outside, throw him against the wall and put a bullet in his brain. He wondered if they'd even bother with a blindfold. Steeling himself, Roman blinked away his tears and looked up to hear the grim sentence he knew was coming.\n\n"Comrade Kosaryov, you are hereby sentenced to-" Roman clenched his fists- "twelve months of labour in the service of the revolution. Dismissed."\n\nStunned, Roman sat in the dock, staring motionless into the middle distance. Had he heard that correctly? Ah, he would live, he would live! Giddy with his emancipation, Roman barely felt it as a soldier gripped his arm and steered him out into the icy Siberian evening. As he smiled like a lunatic, the tears cooled on his cheeks."
 BRY.5.a: "If we do not maintain justice, justice will not maintain us."
 
 BRY.6.t: "Attack of Children's Crusade"
 BRY.6.desc: "Every muscle in Yagoda's body tensed as he read the report from his spy in Verkhneudinsk. Grinding his teeth, he read it once, twice, his vice-like grip crinkling its edges. That upstart bastard Sablin and his coterie of traitorous harpies had begun to put his men they'd captured on trial, accusing them of "crimes against the revolution and the people of Russia." What utter tripe! The mutineers had committed the greatest crime of all, treachery, by daring to take arms against the legitimate government of Russia in pursuit of a ridiculous impossible ideal.\n\nYagoda felt his stomach ulcer grind and pulse at the thought of that glorified child, filling his throat with the repulsive acid taste of his own bile. Worse than the fascists, the monarchists, the revisionists, the mutineers were traitors. His own men denouncing him, fighting against him. Him, the rightful heir to Bukharin!\n\nThe veins on his forehead throbbing, Yagoda tore the report apart, flinging the pieces into the fireplace. When his men retook Buryatia, he would crush Sablin in his hand like a piece of fruit. He deserved nothing less than the ultimate agony of the traitor's reward."
 BRY.6.a: "Treachery is a spear pointed at both ends."
 
 BRY.7.t: "An End to Tyrants"
 BRY.7.desc: "On the stage of the Opera House, Sablin sat with the Central Committee, everyone waiting avidly for the latest report from the frontline. Finally, the radio operator raised her head. Sablin could read the message in the glimmer of her eyes and began to smile before she'd even spoken. "Comrades," she bellowed, "the tyrant is ours!"\n\nInstantly, the crowd erupted into euphoria. Soldiers hugged one another, tears streaming down their faces as the reports came in- Yagoda imprisoned, the enemy fleeing west, the NKVD surrendering en masse. Sablin couldn't help but grin. Irkutsk was theirs!\n\nMarkheev stomped across the stage and thumped a crate of vodka on the table. "From my private stash! If ever we had a cause for celebration, this is it!" Snatching a bottle out of the crate, he tossed it to Sablin. Laughing with his comrades, he chugged from the bottle, splashing some on the maps heaped on the table.\n\n"Comrades!" called Sablin, drawing every eye to him. "The revolution is victorious!" he cried, waving the bottle like a baton to cacophonous cheering. "Tonight, we celebrate! My comrades, rejoice!"\n\nSitting down, Sablin looked around happily. Markheev was joking with his men, Ulanovskaya downed glass after glass of vodka, even Braun was smiling for once. Catching Pechuro's eye, Sablin shot her a smile. She grinned back at him, raising her glass in a mock salute. "We did it, Valera!" she shouted, already slurring. Sablin smirked; she'd always been a lightweight.\n\nTaking another pull, Sablin felt lighter than air. They still had a long road to go down to end Russia's chaos and bring her people into a new age of greatness, but the revolution could wait until tomorrow. Tonight, they'd paint Verkhneudinsk red."
 BRY.7.a: "In the end, tyrants always fall. Always."

 BRY.8.t: "The Revolution Waits for No One"
 BRY.8.desc: "Sablin rose with the sun, eventually making his way downstairs and into the street. Though most had gone to bed, there were still a few stragglers, trying to keep last night's party going. Stopping at a water pump, Sablin washed the morning foulness out of his mouth and shuffled into the Opera House, promising himself he'd never touch vodka again.\n\nThe enormous theatre was almost empty. Rubbing his eyes, Sablin mounted the stage to greet the Central Committee. Sitting around their meeting table, his closest comrades were sipping from glasses of vodka. Markheev waved the bottle in his direction. "A bit of the hair of the dog that bit you, Comrade Sablin?" Smiling, Sablin poured himself a splash of vodka and downed it in a single gulp.\n\n"Ah! Now I'm awake. Well, shall we discuss the liberation of the east?" Sablin was unable to suppress his laughter as his comrades turned as one to glare at him blearily. He knew he ought to be as hungover as them, but he was so flush with energy after last night, when the results of the referendum to reclaim Siberia for the revolution had come in. Unsurprisingly, the people voted overwhelmingly in favour of liberating all the peoples of Russia, as they had the oppressed peasants of Irkutsk.\n\nFacedown on the table, Pechuro groaned and slowly raised her head, a map of the Far East stuck to her cheek. "Valera? Can't this wait until tomorrow? I'm not much good to the revolution with my head hammering like this."\n\nGrinning impishly, Sablin refilled everyone's glasses of vodka. "Comrades, the revolution waits for no one! Now, Comrade Braun, regarding the eastern fascists...""
 BRY.8.a: "Man was born for love and revolution."
 
 BRY.9.t: "Doubts"
 BRY.9.desc: "Sablin would have preferred to get married by the sea, but he'd had to be satisfied with Lake Baikal. Leaving his new wife Nadezhda asleep in their compartment, he stepped into the corridor of the train carriage that bore them back to Verkhneudinsk. Outside, the pine trees rushed by under the light of the full moon. Gazing into the forest for a moment, Sablin opened the window and was instantly assaulted by the freezing wind and the noise of the train's passage. Lighting a cigarette, a rare luxury, he leaned against the wall of the carriage, exhaling occasionally out into the night.\n\nAfter a while, the door to the neighbouring compartment slid open. Hair tousled, Pechuro stepped into the corridor. Wordlessly, he offered her a cigarette. Waving it off, she said, "Having trouble sleeping, Valera?"\n\nSablin blew a thin stream of smoke out the window. He couldn't meet the eyes of his friend as he said, "Ah, Susanna, I should be happy. This is my wedding night. I love her, I do, but I just feel... nothing." Sablin looked up at Pechuro, tears filling his eyes. "I keep thinking, how will it end? We face the most overwhelming obstacles, and every day I send men to die bloody and horrible deaths. What gives me the right? Oh, Susanna, I have such doubts!"\n\nPechuro laid her hand lightly on Sablin's shoulder. "Nothing worth having is without its price, Valera. When you doubt, find your courage, and remember that we fight for what is true and right. We believe in you, and so does every man, woman and child in Russia who still hopes for the future. Above all else, Valera, remember the revolution, and be true to yourself."\n\nWiping his face, Sablin smiled through his tears. "Susanna, I think sometimes that you are the strongest of us all." Looking into each other's eyes, the two old friends smiled at one another as the train carried them into the night."
 BRY.9.a: "Love has a ring, and a ring has no end."
 
 BRY.10.t: "All Hands on Deck"
 BRY.10.desc: "Chin resting on his hand, Sablin listened to his comrades savagely debate the status of women in the revolution. Letting their words wash over him, Sablin recalled that Lenin had always said women were crucial to the revolution, something many chauvinistic communists preferred to ignore. Until recently, he had given little thought to the issue, preoccupied as he was, but Pechuro and Ulanovskaya had given him a lot to think about. If they were to create a new Russia where men and women were equal in every way, shouldn't women be able to serve in combat, if they so chose? Making a decision, Sablin shot to his feet.\n\n"Comrades!" he boomed, cutting through the din. Immediately silenced, every face turned to him. "Are these attitudes towards women not reactionary? Lenin said women are as important as men in achieving the triumph of the revolution, and it is our duty to ensure they have the freedom to choose how they may serve the cause. If the women of Russia wish to hold a rifle for the revolution, let them."\n\nTaking his seat, Sablin sensed the effect his words had on his audience, like an electric current running through the air. Sitting across from him, Pechuro shot him a grin.\n\nIn a few minutes the Central Committee voted unanimously to allow women full equality in service to the revolution. Soldiers were sent running through the streets, calling the news to all, and before the day was out masses of women flooded the Opera House, demanding to be enlisted. Standing on the stage with his hands on his hips, Sablin looked down with satisfaction into the chaos of the pit. Beside him, Pechuro amiably draped her arm around his shoulder. "Ah, Valera. I knew you'd do the right thing.""
 BRY.10.a: "All women to arms!"
 
 BRY.11.t: "The Fate of the NKVD"
 BRY.11.desc: "The remnants of Yagoda's oppressors who had been unable to flee westwards were sent to Verkhneudinsk in the middle of the night in cattle cars, shuttled along the Trans-Siberian like so many of their gulag-bound victims before them. One by one, they were hauled before the courts, found guilty of crimes against the revolution and the people, and dragged back to the cells. In the gallery the people howled for blood before they were silenced by the Tribunal. Watching from the bench, Sablin could not help but feel their pain; all have lost someone they love to the NKVD.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent and the last of the trials of individuals concludes, the Tribunal faces the second and arguably more important item on its agenda: what to do about the NKVD organisation as a whole. Frothing at the mouth, the more radical mutineers argue that the NKVD must be totally dissolved, for its history as a tool of statist oppression and Yagodian tyranny. Though agreeing with them on principle, Sablin also finds himself drawn to the arguments of Braun and the older Bolsheviks, who insist in quiet but firm voices that the NKVD is too valuable a tool to cast aside; that it ought to be reintegrated as a security force of the ASSR on a tight leash.\n\nSablin weighed the sins of the NKVD against its potential use to the revolution as the debate rages on. The NKVD had done so much evil, but could it be rehabilitated? Could it even be just what they needed for the revolution to prevail?\n\n"Comrade Sablin!" cried Pechuro, startling him out of his reverie, "we have not yet heard from you! What should be done with Yagoda's dogs?""
 BRY.11.a: "Their crimes cannot be forgotten."
 BRY.11.b: "They can still serve the revolution."
 
 BRY.12.t: "Broken Sword"
 BRY.12.desc: "Days after their trials, the former officers of the NKVD are loaded back into the cattle cars that brought them to Verkhneudinsk and sent back down the railroad to the prison farms, so that they may atone for their crimes in service to the revolution. A year's hard work is nothing compared to what a less merciful adjudicator may have sentenced them to, and yet they still scowl at Sablin as they're herded onto the train.\n\nStanding on the platform with his hands on his hips, Sablin frowns right back at them. They deserved a hell of a lot worse, but if they were to birth a just and equitable Russia from the ashes of the old, they could not repeat Yagoda's mistakes. Even if the NKVD could aid in the liberation of Russia, to reintegrate them would be like selling their soul, and would deny the bloody toll they had taken on the people. So many had lost loved ones to the NKVD. Sablin refused to allow them to spill more innocent blood in his name.\n\nAs the train drew away from the platform, Sablin turned and walked away without any direction in mind. He had felt so certain he was doing the right thing when Pechuro called on him in the courthouse, but in the light of day he was not so sure. He felt like he'd been handed a sword with which he could liberate Russia and had promptly broken it over his knee. Yet it was also true that the NKVD were a force for corruption. Sablin couldn't picture himself becoming like Yagoda, but if the temptation was there, did he have the strength to resist it?\n\nWell, it was done now and he'd have to live with the consequences of his decision. The revolution would be difficult, but at least it would be honest."
 BRY.12.a: "The hardest thing to do and the right thing to do are often the same."
 
 BRY.13.t: "Dogs in the Henhouse"
 BRY.13.desc: "Only days after their trials, they walk the streets of Verkhneudinsk proudly in uniform with heads held high, knowing that they are as untouchable as they had been under Yagoda. A few days of hardship had been a small price to pay for their freedom. Despite the rhetoric of Sablin's mutineers, to the men of the NKVD it seemed as though they'd simply exchanged one master for another.\n\nStaring out the window of his room into the street, Sablin wondered if he had done the right thing. Markheev and Braun had finally convinced him that it was necessary to rehabilitate the NKVD for the aid they could provide in liberating the rest of Russia, that their uses outweighed the crimes they had committed. Sablin tried to tell himself that it had not been solely his decision, all he had done was share his opinion with his comrades, but he knew he was grasping at straws. Furrowing his brow, Sablin couldn't deny that his views as nominal leader of the revolution carried an overwhelming sway.\n\nThough Sablin knew he would never use the NKVD the way that Yagoda had, it was not so easy to convince the people of that. He noticed the questioning glances his more radical comrades gave him now, the way sometimes talk would stop as he entered the room. Most of all, he couldn't forget the look of hurt betrayal on Susanna's face when he'd spoken out at the trial in favour of reintegrating the NKVD.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Sablin steadied himself. No; he hadn't the time for doubt. He had made the right decision, they needed the skill and training of these men to carry the torch of the revolution. Finally feeling ready to face the Central Committee, Sablin stomped downstairs into the street and tried to ignore the looks he got from the people who had once looked at him as their salvation."
 BRY.13.a: "The hardest thing to do and the right thing to do are often the same."
 
 BRY.14.t: "The Trial of Genrikh Yagoda"
 BRY.14.desc: "Gaze burning with vitriol, Yagoda scowled at Sablin from the dock, his pitted face twisted with contempt. Undaunted, Sablin stared right back. They had decided to hold the trial in the Opera House so as many people could be packed in as possible. Braun's voice echoed in the cavernous space as he read out the list of the tyrant's crimes. Through it all Yagoda didn't so much as flinch.\n\n"Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda, this court of soldiers and workers finds you guilty of all the charges laid against you. Now that you are finally responsible, do you feel the slightest regret for the vile crimes you have committed against Russia and her people?" Braun looked down at Yagoda, trying his best not to look smug.\n\nYagoda turned his head fractionally to look up at Braun. When he spoke, it was as though his words were being dredged from the sediment in the depths of Lake Baikal itself. "Yes, I am sorry... I am very sorry that when I had the chance, I did not shoot you all."\n\nBraun's smirk darkened as he took his seat. "Let it be known that the accused expresses no remorse. Now, as to the matter of punishment..."\n\nWhile the court debated, Sablin stared into Yagoda's eyes and tried to make sense of what he saw there. In his time in Yagoda's service Sablin had never met the man, and had formed an image in his mind of a colossal, statuesque figure beyond simple humanity. It was easier to fight that entity than the short, haggard man who sat half-sunken in the dock. Why had he become so hollow with hate? What had led him to bathe his hands in so much blood?\n\nSablin felt a raging urge to see Yagoda extinguished, as much for the crimes he had committed as for the grim vision of what he could become if he gave into power's black temptation. And so, when Yagoda's sentence was announced- five years on a prison farm- Sablin's jaw clenched. Insufficient! That man was a tyrant, a murderer, a plunderer, an enemy to everything right and pure!\n\nConsumed by a sudden wildness, Sablin yearned to leap forward, drag Yagoda out into the mud and give him the justice he deserved."
 BRY.14.a: "Hold on."
 BRY.14.b: "Give in."
 
 BRY.15.t: "The People's Justice"
 BRY.15.desc: "Swallowing the bile that rose to his throat, Sablin clenched his fists and clamped his eyes shut, lest the sight of the tyrant send him catapulting forward to enact vengeance upon him for all the innocents he had killed. Teeth grinding, every muscle in his body tensed as Yagoda was led away. All that death, all that spilled blood, for five years on a prison farm? So many had lost someone to Yagoda's reign of terror, and this was his punishment?\n\nBreathing deeply, Sablin barely noticed as the Opera House began to empty. Finally, he raised his head and slowly opened his eyes, squinting as they readjusted to the light. For the first time, he truly saw the mural that adorned the dome. It was an image of the October Revolution, of the workers storming the Winter Palace, red flags unfurled and fluttering in the wind.\n\nSlowly, Sablin calmed himself. Relaxing his shoulders, he reminded himself that this was what he was fighting for; the right for the people to make their own justice, without a tyrant to force their hand. If he had indulged his temptation to deliver the vengeance of murdered thousands upon Yagoda, it would have been an abdication of everything he stood for.\n\nFeeling a hand on his shoulder, Sablin turned his head to look into Pechuro's face. She gazed down at him with an expression of infinite compassion. "Valera, take heart. We fight for a brighter future, not to take vengeance for the cruelty of the past. By showing clemency, we demonstrate to the tyrant and all the peoples of Russia that we will never repeat his crimes. Mercy, Valera. Mercy is our greatest weapon against the enemies of all that is just."\n\nBlinking away tears, Sablin smiled. As he took one last glance at the mural, the two old friends left the Opera House, shivering in the chill evening breeze."
 BRY.15.a: "The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury."
 
 BRY.16.t: "The Leader's Justice"
 BRY.16.desc: "Clenching his fists, Sablin stood. Instantly the Opera House fell silent, every head turning to him. Swallowing to get over the crest of his emotion, Sablin pointed at a pair of guards. "You two. Take him outside." For a moment, the men did not move. Fearfully they flicked their eyes between Braun and Sablin, then, with no contradictory orders, they each grabbed Yagoda by an arm. As Sablin strode forward, the crowd before him parted silently like the Red Sea before Moses.\n\nQuashing the tiny voice within him that begged him to turn back, Sablin thrust the doors open, stalking into the howling wind. His breath steaming before him, the guards dragged Yagoda outside and dumped him in the frozen mud. Determined to maintain some shred of dignity, Yagoda pushed himself to his knees and wiped his face clean.\n\nWatching from the doorway, the crowd of Sablin's followers saw him exchange words with the defeated tyrant, but could not hear over the screaming wind. After a moment, his face as tranquil and undisturbed as the surface of Lake Baikal, Sablin pulled out his Tokarev service pistol and pumped two rounds into Yagoda's head.\n\nAs a spume of blood and brain matter sprayed from the back of his skull, Yagoda's corpse slowly sagged to the ground, crumpling as he bled into the mud.\n\nSablin stared down into the tyrant's lifeless eyes as they gazed emptily into the grey crepuscular sky. Panting with exertion, Pechuro pushed out through the crowd. Immediately, she came to a halt at what she saw. "Valera," she whispered, "what have you done? You have executed him."\n\nStill holding his pistol, Sablin sharply glanced up at her and muttered, "The tyrant has not been executed. He has been shot."\n\nHot tears streaming down her cheeks, Pechuro said, "Valera, there are songs in this world other than vengeance and despair. With those two bullets, we are doomed. Now how can anyone believe we will not repeat his tyrannies? Oh, Valera!"\n\nAs the false warmth of his hate abandoned him, Sablin fell into the icy clutches of doubt."

 BRY.17.desc: "Sablin sat drinking tea with Braun, Pechuro and Markheev as they listened to the report of Ulanovskaya, recently returned from her harsh journey through the taiga to visit with the long-suffering partisans of Aldan. "...very little food, Great War-era guns, constant border raids by bandits. Most of all, comrades, these people were tired. Few are under thirty, most are simply peasants who wish to return to their old lands in the desperate hope that their families are still alive."\n\n"Would they support our revolution?" asked Braun, sipping his tea as he looked over the rims of his glasses. Sablin frowned, but he had to admit, Braun was nothing if not pragmatic.\n\n"Among those who remember a time before endless chaos and privation, there are they who keep the dream of Lenin and Marx alive," replied Ulanovskaya. "After speaking with Ochirov and his council, they seemed wretchedly eager to offer control of all their land in exchange for food, protection and the right to return home. It was... moving. Comrades, these people need our help more than any other."\n\n"I agree with Comrade Ulanovskaya," said Markheev, unusually dour. "Many of the partisans are Buryats with family here. Aside from the righteousness of aiding the downtrodden, we'd gain a tactical advantage by absorbing their land, and perhaps some additional sorely-needed manpower."\n\nBraun placed down his tea-cup with an audible click. "I concur. The benefits far outweigh the potential risks, and we need any advantage we can get." Pechuro nodded her approval, looking over with an ever-so-slightly raised eyebrow at Sablin.\n\nReturning the raised eyebrow, Sablin turned to smile at Ulanovskaya. "I wholeheartedly agree with supporting the Aldan partisans. It's a favourable deal, and, besides anything else, it is our manifest duty to aid the poor and oppressed folk of Russia." Sablin raised his teacup in a mock salute. "Aldan, then the rest of Russia!""

 BRY.18.t: "Homeward Bound"
 BRY.18.desc: "Sablin watched as the mist of his breath froze into tiny crystals of ice that fell, glimmering and silent, to the crisp packed snow. Native Siberians called it "the whisper of stars". Shivering alongside him despite their heavy fur coats were the rest of the Central Committee. Though it was morning, the mists rising off the forest blurred the sun, giving the impression that they were looking at everything through a frosted window.\n\nThey seemed to coalesce out of the mist, a legion of phantoms, slogging through the snow in their tattered uniforms. To Sablin's eyes, the partisans of Aldan seemed like tortured spectres of the past, once-valiant warriors who had been denied their eternal rest and now roamed the land, forever trapped in the mortal realm. They stared forward, eyes guttering and dim, carrying guns held together by little more than faith, squinting in the dawn as though unaccustomed to going about in the light of day. Sablin's heart wrenched to see their horses trudge huffing through the snow, ribs poking from their skin. In their quiet struggle, they seemed to form the image of their riders' long years of torment and deprivation. He saw the blood and sweat of painful decades lurking behind the guttering gazes of man and beast.\n\nSaluting as he appeared out of the fog, Gurzhap Ochirov rode before Sablin and dismounted. Though he was as gaunt as his men, his eyes still burned with love for freedom and the revolution. Gripping his arm in greeting, Sablin could tell that this was a man who would sooner die than give up the fight.\n\nAfter that, it was a simple matter of signing the treaty. The revolution's troops moved north into Aldan as the partisans were finally freed from their long years of penury and anguish. As they marched into the south to return to their homes and families, Sablin saw their eyes shine lambent with the long-doused light of pure, simple joy."

 BRY.19.t: "Against All Tyranny"
 BRY.19.desc: "Sablin mounted the hastily-constructed stage in the square outside the Opera House to address his supporters, who had turned out in their thousands to hear him speak. Walking carefully, half-afraid that the platform would collapse, Sablin approached the microphone, joining the Central Committee. After tapping the microphone twice to be sure it was working, he began.\n\n"Comrades!" he boomed over the plaza, "our revolution has triumphed over its first adversary, the despot Yagoda!" Thunderous cheers erupted from the crowd, their clouded breath forming a low layer of mist in the cold of the morning. Smiling, Sablin continued, "But our mission is not yet done! Still, Russia lies broken and divided, her corpse picked over by the Tsarists, the revisionists and the fascists! It is the manifest duty of our revolution to liberate the oppressed peoples of Russia, to build a new nation faithful to the immortal science of Marx and Lenin! We will not rest until Russia is united by the socialist revolution, from the Baltic to the Pacific!"\n\nHe was forced to pause there, as the cacophonous approval of the crowd would have drowned out anything he said. As the cheering died down, he continued, "For those who are downtrodden, we bring hope! For those who believe in a brighter future, we bring deliverance! For the enemies of the people, we bring nothing but defeat! We stand against all tyranny! Comrades, we march to the east to bring liberation, to cast down the tyrants! Long live Marx, Lenin and the socialist revolution!"\n\nGrinning from ear to ear, Sablin raised his fist, driving the crowd wild with revolutionary fervor. That evening they would begin the march east. He could already taste the sweetness of victory."
 BRY.19.a: "No kings, no tyrants!"

 BRY.20.t: "The Trial of Mikhail Matkovsky"
 BRY.20.desc: ""Mikhail Alexeevich Matkovsky, this court of soldiers and workers finds you guilty of crimes against the socialist revolution and the common people of Russia," droned Braun from the bench. In the gallery, the audience jeered and flung insults at Matkovsky. Three days of tearful interviews with the recently liberated inmates of the camps had erased any hope for clemency that the tyrant may have been holding out for.\n\nSablin watched with a smirk as Matkovsky clenched his fists and ground his teeth, staring at Braun with bulging eyes. "...for your crimes, this court sentences you to twenty years of rehabilitative labour in the service of the revolution," finished Braun. Clasping his hands, he looked down his nose at Matkovsky. "Have you anything to say?"\n\n"Yes!" spat Matkovsky, shooting to his feet to a chorus of ridicule from the gallery. "I reject the legitimacy of this so-called court! This is nothing more than a Bukharinist show trial, a travesty of justice! Under what authority do you try me?"\n\nFilled with sudden rage at the tyrant's weaselling, Sablin snatched the carpenter's hammer they were using as a gavel and slammed it against the bench, the bang erupting through the hall like a gunshot. Much to his satisfaction, the fascist flinched. Standing, and filling his voice with vitriol, Sablin said, "Tyrant Matkovsky, we try you by the authority of the workers and peasants you oppressed! Hear them, fascist! They cry out for justice!" Thrusting his arm in the direction of the gallery, he was rewarded with a cacophony of yelling and stomping from the gathered masses.\n\nAfter that, Matkovsky was dragged away, screaming threats that went ignored. Grinning ferociously, Sablin felt himself lifted up by the joy of triumph and the adulation of the crowd. The scourge of the east had been cast down by his hand. Now he could turn his gaze to the west. Soon, all of Russia would be free of tyrants and oppressors."
 BRY.20.a: "Fascism is capitalism plus murder."

 BRY.21.t: "An Empty Crown"
 BRY.21.desc: "Sablin went down the stairs leading to the cells, his boots echoing off the flagstones, laid there in the days of the old empire. With a creak, Sablin swung the door open, revealing the pitiable form of Mikhail, the false Tsar. His military uniform dirtied and torn, he jerked his head to look at Sablin as he entered, his eyes sunken and fearful, his face covered by a week's worth of scraggly beard. Sablin's face screwed up in disgust; he stank. Had the soldiers not allowed him to wash? They were better than this. "Mikhail Andreevich, do you know who I am?" Mikhail nodded pathetically. Sablin continued, "I am sorry for the state of your conditions. I will arrange for this to be remedied immediately. I-"\n\nBefore he could get any further, the false Tsar lurched from his bench to grovel on his knees. Sablin took an involuntary step back as he was assaulted by the reek of Mikhail's breath. "Sablin, Comrade Sablin, I beg of you! I have been saying over and over I was nothing more than a pawn of the hardliners! Comrade Sablin, please, I beg you, you must believe me!"\n\nSuddenly, he floundered forward, grabbing Sablin's legs as he began to noisily weep, tears and snot running down his face. "Comrade Sablin, I wish only to go home! Please have mercy, I love Russia and her people, long live the socialist revolution! I beg you comrade, allow me to return home, I will never trouble you again!"\n\nSablin stared down at the false Tsar, his face contorted with a mixture of pity and disgust. It was true in part; Mikhail had been a pawn of the rightists, but hadn't he also chosen to come to Russia and claim his fallacious birthright? Though he deserved the labour camps, perhaps it would simply be kinder to let the past be past and put him on a ship bound for Australia, that distant land across the waves where an exiled prince could find a home?"
 BRY.21.a: "Exact justice."
 BRY.21.b: "Have pity."

 BRY.22.t: "The Tyrant's Reward"
 BRY.22.desc: "Mud sucked at the hooves of Sablin and Markheev's horses as they rode into the village at the Manchurian border, accompanied by a small group of soldiers. Slowly cantering between the wattle and daub huts, Sablin's clouded breath merged with that of this horse as he glanced into the empty huts. There was not a face to be seen, the villagers having fled into the hills at their approach. At last, the two comrades arrived in the center of the village, to confirm for themselves the report of their scouts. Reigning in his horse, Sablin looked up into the face of Konstantin Rodzaevsky.\n\nThe rope around his neck creaking, Rodzaevsky swayed lifelessly. Face already beginning to bloat and turn purple, his eyes stared emptily into the overcast Siberian sky, tongue lolling between swollen lips. Sablin looked into those eyes, set into a face contorted with a final expression of black fury. To be hanged from a tree by his own subjects in a filthy village on the edge of his would-be empire seemed a fitting end for such a man as Rodzaevsky. Furrowing his brow, Sablin wondered if his life too would end in violence.\n\n"Well," said Markheev, as though he felt a need to break the silence, "so it goes. I only wish I'd gotten my hands on him first. Still, the Far East is ours now, eh, comrade?"\n\nSablin wasn't in the mood for Markheev's jocularity. Sighing, he looked over his shoulder at the soldiers. "Cut him down and bury him, comrades. I want to ride back before sunset." Turning back, he watched the would-be Vozhd slowly rotate in the evening breeze.\n\nHours later, after they'd arrived back at camp, Sablin could still see Rodzaevsky's purple, bloated face in his mind's eye. For weeks, his dreams would be haunted by the image of Rodzaevsky slowly rotating, whispering Sablin's darkest fears through his cold, cold lips as the rope spun, creaking, always creaking..."
 BRY.22.a: "All men face the same fate, in the end."

 BRY.23.t: "A Message of Hope"
 BRY.23.desc: "Fyodor Olegovich Rogov stood in line with the rest of the freed inmates, stamping his feet and hugging his arms to his chest for warmth, his breath steaming in front of him in the raw morning air. At the head of the queue, one of the Sablinites handed out the mail that had recently arrived from Verkhneudinsk. Pimply and skinny, he was young enough to be Fyodor's son.\n\nThough he shivered in the cold, Fyodor hardly felt it. Inside he was warmed by the hope that he would finally receive word of the family he had not seen in almost a decade, since he was sent to the camps for owning books by Marx and Lenin, forcing his wife and daughter to flee into the west. The Sablinites had been good to him and the other prisoners, giving them new clothes and three meals a day, although they were still being quartered in the camp.\n\n"Your name, comrade?" asked the boy-soldier as Fyodor reached the front. Fyodor told him and was rewarded with a letter. Heart lurching into his throat, he stumbled away to a quiet place. Alone, he tore the envelope open, wrenching out the letter. It was from his daughter, Ioanna! For years he had not even known if she was alive! A dozen emotions surging in his mind like waves on a stormy beach, he began to read.\n\n"Dearest Papa, we are in Verkhneudinsk now and finally safe. How I wish I had enough paper and ink to tell you of our adventure into the west all those years past, or of the joy my heart felt when I learned that you lived! I have changed a great deal, and am no longer, I think, the girl I was when you last knew me. Above all else, I long to hold you in my arms once again. I look forward to that day more than I can say."\n\nPressing his eyelids shut to hold back his tears, Fyodor smiled, feeling the lightness of hope for the first time in years. All of a sudden the world was much larger again, and there was some small place in it for him."
 BRY.23.a: "I am no bird, and no net ensnares me."

 BRY.24.t: "The Trial of Alexander Men"
 BRY.24.desc: "Head cocked back, Sablin gazed down through narrowed eyes at Father Alexander Men. Heavily built and impressively bearded, Men sat in the dock in his priest's vestments, his only concession to vanity a golden cruciform necklace. Breathing tranquil, he looked ahead in a state of apparent serenity, one hand resting lightly atop the other. Sablin wondered if the state of his mind was as peaceful as his exterior would lead one to believe.\n\nTruth be told, Sablin couldn't quite figure Men out. He wasn't a tyrant, an evil man. Although he seemed to believe in the best interests of the Russian people, he also fought against the socialist revolution. Having once been a member of the proscribed Catacomb Church, he had continually held that Christianity, not socialism, would be Russia's salvation. A good man at heart, but so misguided! Religion was, as Marx had so famously said, the opiate of the masses. The Russian people would never be free until they liberated themselves from the bishops and their saccharine lies.\n\n"Alexander Vladimirovich Men-" began Braun, as Sablin noticed how Men didn't tense even the slightest as his sentence was read out, "this court of soldiers and workers finds you guilty of crimes against the socialist revolution. You are hereby sentenced to two years and six months of rehabilitative labour in the service of the revolution. Dismissed."\n\nStanding, Men silently made the sign of the cross. He went with dignity, allowing the soldiers to take him outside without resistance, not glancing back, as though afraid of being transformed into a pillar of salt. Sablin couldn't help but notice the subdued mood of the gallery; they seemed to have been hoping for more of a show.\n\nMen had been an enemy of socialism and needed to be punished, but that didn't mean they had to be cruel about it. As Pechuro had once said to him, the strength of their revolution came from their clemency, not from bloody-handed retribution."
 BRY.24.a: "Refrain from anger and turn from wrath, it leads only to evil."

 BRY.25.t: "Red Sun Rising"
 BRY.25.desc: "Laying in the square outside the Verkhneudinsk Opera House with Pechuro, Markheev and Ulanovskaya, Sablin tried to belch out the Internationale but barely got past the third note when he started uncontrollably giggling, setting his comrades off too. Rolling onto his belly, Sablin drunkenly pawed for the vodka bottle, but it kept rolling away from him. That made him laugh, too.\n\nSlumping back over, Sablin gazed into the sky, watching as black night slowly gave way to the grey of pre-dawn. He smiled to himself, vaguely wondering how many bottles of vodka he'd drunk since he'd signed the treaty forming the Far Eastern Soviet Republic the night before. That was pretty much the only thing he remembered from the past twelve hours. He had no doubt he'd made quite the fool of himself during the party, but what did it matter? If ever they had cause to celebrate, this was it! Grinning like a lunatic, Sablin imagined what the party would be like when they took Moscow.\n\n"Look, comrades!" shouted Markheev, pointing to the sun as it crested over the horizon, "a red sun rises! The heavens themselves turn out for the revolution!" That got a ragged cheer from Sablin and the other half-dozing revellers, still trying to keep the party alive.\n\nStaring into the reddening sky, Sablin couldn't wipe the grin from his face. Against the most impossible odds, they had succeeded. They had cast down the tyrants, lighting the torch of the socialist revolution across the east. Despite their triumph, it wasn't over yet. They still had to bring the revolution west, into the lands of the bandits, the madmen and the oppressors.\n\nLooking around him at his closest friends, Sablin realized for the first time that he trusted them implicitly, that the strength they lent him would allow him to climb any mountain, leap any hurdle. Feeling sober all of a sudden, Sablin sat up. The party was over. He had to keep the momentum going."
 BRY.25.a: "The fight isn't over until you win."
 
 BRY.26.t: "The Next Moves Forward"
 BRY.26.desc: "That night, the Opera House was at maximum capacity. Comrades from on every floor and chair, the veteran fighters and the fresh, eager blood gathered to hear Valery Mikhailovich Sablin speak. With him stood his comrades-at-arms; Mikhail Markheev, holding the first bottle of the night in his hand. Susanna Pechuro with her inseparable friend Maya Ulanovskaya, and finally Otto Braun. Sablin was the one to carry the winds of the conversation that night, and thus he, for the blood-splattered territories of Russia and its tragic past, represented a beacon in the East.\n\n"Comrades! The Central Committee bickers often, but today, we are united!" He shouted, anticipating the newcomers even further. "Today, we are no longer the Buryatian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Today, we are something more! We will represent the liberated, and the liberators! We will show our increasing strength, and we will make a stand against the tyrant! Tonight, my friends, we will be known as the Far Eastern Soviet Republic!"\n\nCheers erupted across the entire Opera House, so loud that Sablin almost wanted to cover his ears. Markheev slammed his back with a powerful, yet friendly thump of his hand, and grinned towards him with the ever-tempting bottle. The rest - Pechuro, Ulanovskaya, and Braun, all remained content with silence. The old German merely cracked a satisfied grin, while Sablin and Pechuro exchanged awkward glances that quickly mellowed out into traded smiles. As the shouting died down, Sablin turned once again to face the Central Committee.\n\n"There is much to do, my friends. I will admit - I am somewhat afraid of the future. But I know that with the comrades that surround me," he said, motioning an arm to his allies besides and behind him. "There will be no reason to fear what is to come next! So tonight, comrades...""

 BRY.27.desc: "Valery Mikhailovich Sablin paced the grand stage of the Opera House nervously, even though there were only four pairs of eyes watching him, and the air felt empty with the countless unfilled seats. Eventually, he stopped up in the middle, and sighed, turning his gaze to his comrades. "As you all know, the policy of ideological pushback in the previous Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was treating it with caution and advising party unity." His eyes swiftly moved past Susanna Pechuro, but he could see her smile before he looked to Mikhail Markheev, who raised an eyebrow and crossed his arms.\n\nIt looked like Markheev wanted to make a comment, but relented. Sablin took it as the opportunity to continue. "I say that we should explore the ways a man can think about the revolution. After all, should we not be so dogmatic as to outright deny and spit on opinions that are not exactly our own?" Markheev seemed to take in Sablin's words, but Maya Ulanovskaya cut in first, surprisingly enough.\n\n"I believe... though Lenin was right in his choice to tighten party unity, back then we still had the entirety of Russia. Nowadays, we need all we can get." Otto Braun merely snorted and shook his head.\n\n"And, what, let reactionaries slip into our ranks? I don't believe we should let any of this silliness occur. This is our revolution, comrades, and we cannot let it be tainted by the thoughts of revisionists." He shrugged. "Just my thoughts."\n\nFor once, Pechuro was silent, softly biting her thumb and looking just the slightest bit anxious. Sablin could see that, but he also had to consider what the others had said. "Comrade," Markheev began, staring intently at Sablin. "Your choice is final. You know my opinion, but we must move on, as time is of the essence." Sablin nodded, and, with a breath that gave him enough time to think, he spoke."
 BRY.27.a: ""The choice must be made.""
 
 BRY.28.t: "The Push Towards Change"
 BRY.28.desc: "This time, in the cold of the Opera House, there was a much more positive tone between Sablin and the members of the Central Committee, as he had shuffled a few papers from his briefcase to a table, letting the others gaze at it with curiosity. Sablin tapped against one paper. "This, comrades," he began, holding it up in his hand, "is a copy of the original Soviet decree to pass an eight-hour workday. The rest are other, various laws that were in effect in the original Soviet Union."\n\nSusanna Pechuro nodded. "I'm guessing you'll wish to reimplement this decree? What about the rest?" The other members of the Central Committee seemed to be content with silence - especially Maya Ulanovskaya, who only glanced at the papers with a slow-burning interest. Sablin set the paper down. "These other ones- the Decree on Land, the Decree on Workers' Control, and so on, we will have to readjust to fit the new revolution."\n\nMikhail Markheev looked at Sablin oddly. "Readjust? Should these not be perfectly serviceable the way they are?" Sablin merely shook his head. "No, Comrade Markheev. Though one of Lenin's first acts was to abolish private property, we have no such luxury here. It will remain - as of right now - but in due time, we will tear down all the framework of the capitalist institution." Markheev eyed Sablin warily, and the former commissar smiled. "Trust me, comrade. The revolution will not fail so long as we stand strong.""

You're reading much faster this week." he said, "I'll see you tomorrow. Class is dismissed."\n\nFyodor put the book into his backpack and headed out of the room of the church basement, seeing his friend Yuri by the stairs.\n\n"God, I don't know what Sablin's doing, Fedya making us come here every evening," Yuri muttered. "I have a farm, I have a wife and three kids. Wanna go to the bar?"\n\nFyodor shook his head, and headed out the church door. Let him disparage it, he thought as he walked back home. He could spend his entire day away from his family and farm at the adult literacy class, but it would be all worth it if he could spend ten minutes using what he learned at home.\n\nLittle Vanya jumped into his father's arms as he saw him coming through the door.\n\n"Vanya, would you like to read a story?" Fyodor asked.\n\n"Yes, Papa!"\n\nFyodor smiled as he sat himself and Vanya down at the kitchen table, taking the book out and beginning to read."

So engrossed were they in the gunslinger's heroics that they didn't notice one of the cell administrators, Serafim Vasilyev approaching him.\n\n"Comrade Dorzhiev!" Vasilyev shouted.\n\n"Comrade Vasilyev, I uh..." Bulgan began to stammer as he was caught red handed at the pub watching an American movie.\n\n"No need to worry, comrade, I was just going to say that Sablin has loosened restrictions of Party membership for Komsomol members: you can watch your American media all you want as long as you understand the principles of socialism."\n\n"Really?" Bulgan smiled as he heard those words.\n\n"Yes, comrade. Also, because of Ulan-Ude's new affirmative action policy, Buryats and other natives are receiving top priority for Party membership. Because of your knowledge of dialectical materialism and the new program, I am happy to say you are the first recipient of Party membership in the village!"\n\nBulgan's friends burst into cheers and congratulations upon hearing the news.\n\n"Drinks are on me tonight!" he shouted.\n\n"But just remember," Vasilyev added, "Sablin may have also lifted some of the restrictions on drinking, but you still need to drink responsibly!""

Braun slammed his fist against the table, "We need centralized organization if we want to see prosperity!"\n\nAs Sablin opened the door to the conference room, he found the Central Committee in a state of shambles. Each committee member was shouting at each other at the top of their lungs, looking haggard and worn out from argument.\n\n"Comrades, no need to turn this into a shouting match!" Sablin exclaimed as he looked around. "We are politicians, not children in a primary school. Now can you please tell me what's going on here?"\n\n"Excuse us, Comrade Sablin," Maya Ulanovskaya apologised, "however a dispute arose over the extent of the role workers' soviets should play in legislation."\n\n"It's a shame so many of this committee are overly idealistic," Mikhail Markheev grumbled, "but I think we can agree on giving you the final say on these things, Comrade?"\n\nThe rest of the room nodded in agreement.\n\n"Excellent.

Sablin began to frown as he stared at the tables, graphs and reports contained therein.\n\n"Unfortunately economic growth in the last fiscal year was slower than we expected," Maya Ulanovskaya, the Minister of Economics said. "We attribute this to a downturn in foreign trade."\n\n"What does this mean?" Sablin replied, "Is there still funding available for the workers' council expansion plan?" Sablin had become particularly interested in a proposed campaign to give increased control of economic planning to the local workers' councils as opposed to the bureaucracy, and often talked about the possibility of implementing it in the previous months.\n\n"Comrade Sablin, we can begin that project of yours, but for the foreseeable future it will require that we focus on them exclusively at the expense of other vital planning bodies," Ulanovskaya's assistant, a bearded man in his forties, asserted, "bodies like the National Munitions Bureau that our national defense depends on. What will it be?"\n\nA silence fell across the conference room as the Central Committee stared at Sablin, who looked at the report in his hands, and waited for his answer as he pondered that classic question of economics.

His time as a military officer was brief, but never before had he seen such undisciplined rabble. Many soldiers straggled behind in the obstacle course, creating jams or simply collapsing out of exhaustion. Perhaps a leader in the past (and indeed, many in the present) would brutalise the men into formation, beating and tormenting them until they acted like the perfect machines they wanted them to be. But Sablin was not that leader.\n\nHe walked up to the commander of the battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Novikov, who saluted him as he passed by.\n\n"No need for that, comrade," Sablin began, "I just need to ask: what's wrong with the unit? I thought we implemented measures to improve the soldiers' discipline?"\n\n"Measures, measures, measures," Novikov sighed, lighting up a cigarette before speaking, "you can't run if you're boots are worn out, you can't shoot if you don't have guns, and you can't train on what stuff you've got if they just keep wearing out. Know what I'm saying, comrade?"\n\nSablin nodded, as he made a mental note to visit the People's Commissar of Defense once inspection was done."

He smiled as he turned to Lieutenant Colonel Novikov.\n\n"I must admit, comrade commander, your new logistical program has worked wonders on the unit," the officer said.\n\nSablin smiled.\n\n"The soldiers in the Red Army are just another kind of worker, but instead of creating value they protect that value from the bourgeois thievery.

Braun muttered, "following their defeat by Japan, it appears that the public is losing faith in the bourgeois capitalist order, with their opponents forming the National Progressive Pact against the unified liberal Republican-Democratic Coalition."\n\nSablin smiled.\n\n"I assume there are many socialists in this party, then? Perhaps we can send our greetings to them?"\n\nBraun was not so enthused.\n\n"Unfortunately, while it appears that there are a good number of socialists in the NPP, there are equally large numbers of reactionaries and fascists who oppose liberalism for going too far, instead of not going far enough. Both parties are divided over the treatment of black proletarians by the white bourgeoisie, and the situation is growing more unstable by the day."\n\nThe two men stared at the map, and each other, and the two felt their hearts sink as they realised how alone the Leninist state was in the world."

This nation is unusual for the fact that it is led by a man in his 20s, a former army officer named Valery Sablin who claims that he is committed to 'the rebirth of the Soviet Union under the ideals of the October Revolution'. [BRY.GetName] requests the opening of trade with OFN members as well as investment in structural infrastructure in the hopes us and them can collaborate against fascism in the future."

As upholders of the October Revolution and the ideals that invigorated its leaders, we are deeply committed to the liberation of workers around the world, and we express hope that your nation is well on the way to achieving the equality of all its citizens in the coming years. The nation and its leader Valery Sablin are enthusiastic about cooperation with you, and look forward to the day that we stand as allies in the coming struggle against fascism.\n\nSincerely,\n\nOtto Braun, Minister of Foreign Affairs (Far Eastern Soviet Republic)"

The state requests that they send emissaries to Washington D.C. to open up formal international relationships with us and them, and that we sign a pact of nonaggression to ensure hostilities between our two countries do not erupt.\n\nAlthough the Far Eastern SSR's leader Valery Sablin is young and comparatively inexperienced in statecraft, his idealism, charisma and commitment to oppose fascism makes him a potentially powerful ally. If he were to gain influence outside his state, he could motivate millions of people to support the cause of the OFN and oppose fascism across Eurasia."

 BRY.42.desc: "We have received terrible news from the United States: the government has refused to open formal relationships with us, nor are they interested in a pact of non-aggression. In the transmission detailing their rejection, they claimed that our leader Sablin is 'an idealist warlord, but a warlord nonetheless', and that 'the United States has no interest in supporting such warlordism in the former Soviet Union', this despite the fact we have made our commitment to the ideals of the October Revolution very clear in communications with them."

We wish, through this letter, to tell you that the dream of Lenin is alive and well, kept in the hearts of the people of Russia.

Your revolution against the Batista regime was a point of pride amongst the people of the socialist struggle, myself included. The desire to replace a reactionary, failing government with one more concerned for the welfare of the people and committed to socialist principles was a common thread in both our revolutions. As well as growing from a few supporters to a mass movement of committed revolutionaries.\n\nI write to you, just as I write to all the socialist movements of the world, to inform you that the revolution has succeeded in liberating the east of Russia. From the wastes of Siberia to the Bering Sea, the people stand ready to liberate all of the former USSR from their warlord and Hiterite oppressors, and achieve a world free of capitalist oppression. We stand in solidarity with the other peoples of the world, including those in Cuba.\n\nI hope that this letter will mean the start of a strong friendship between the people of Cuba and the Far Eastern Soviet Republic. Our peoples must remain united, so that the bonds between them will never be broken.\n\nYour great and good friend,\n\nValery Sablin\n\nGeneral Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party"

"This warlord, has he declared war on us yet?"\n\n"Well, no, sir, but..."\n\nThe Minister went back to his lunch. "Well, let me know when they do.

Was bouncing off a layer of cloud cover. They didn't get much, but they did get a bit of it." He handed the Konteradmiral the dispatch.\n\n"Let's see..." said the Konteradmiral. "Something something Soviet Republic...Vladimir Sable...condemning the Hitlerites...freedom for the masses of the east...borders of 1936...something something workers' revolution."

"We may have a serious issue out east."\n\n"No, Fregattenkapitän," the Konteradmiral said as he filed away the report. "We've had reports like these come out of the waste for years.

There will be meeting sessions, as well as lectures and round tables on socialist theory and government from prominent academicians. Speeches by high ranking party members and Comrade Sablin will also be held. Local refreshments will be provided, and attendees will be quartered at the Hotel Magadan during the conference.\n\nYour delegation will also be treated to tours of industrial and military facilities around the convention area, so that they may gain first hand experience in how the FESR is rebuilding after years of warlordism and neglect.

To discuss the issues in world politics. To raise awareness of your individual causes and struggles. And to see for yourselves the progress and reconstruction of Eatern Siberia under socialism.\n\nInternational awareness is important for the cause of socialism. For too long, we have wandered around, uncoordinated, aimless, blind to issues outside our own countries. But the struggle of the workers is an international one! The oppressors of the world, from the megacorporations of North America and Europe, to the dictators of South America and Africa, and the warlords and aristocrats of Asia, all put aside their supposed differences to suppress movements of the working class in their own countries. We must have a means of defending ourselves!\n\nComrades! The time has come to cast off the blinders of nationalism, and to awaken to the world around us! To coordinate, and to plan the revolution of the working class with parties and organizations around the world. To stand together against the enemies of working people. What we need, brothers and sisters, is not a loose association. What we need...""

 BRY.49.t: "Report From the Conference"
 BRY.49.desc: "Nobody expected Magadan to be the most luxurious place in Asia, and it has lived up to those goals. To be frank, the town is remote, cold, and home to a few ramshackle apartment buildings and administrative structures. The main economic activity in the town is gold mining and fishing, both of which the Siberians are extremely happy to highlight. The town, however, still suffers from the lingering effects of warlordism and neglect brought on by the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe armed forces of the Socialist Republic are more impressive. They still seem to be a group of militias, but these militias are more organized and trained than the communal defense squads we expected to find in Russia. They have uniforms, proper equipment, and an organizational structure modeled after the former Red Army. Their fighting spirit is by far their greatest attribute, and they are highly motivated to defend their homes and one day bring the revolution to the rest of the former union.\n\nFinally, there is General Secretary Sablin himself. A former commissar in his late twenties, he scarcely seems like the man to bring about the worldwide revolution. In many ways, he is not. Comrade Sablin is still inexperienced, and he oftentimes has views on the revolution that one may classify as hopeful or naive. But regardless, he has amassed a massive following amongst the people of Russia. Many of them are drawn to his natural charisma, and believe if he says they can accomplish something, then they will be able to, no matter how outlandish."

 BRY.50.t: "The New International"
 BRY.50.desc: "Valery Sablin has revealed the real reason for the meeting in Magadan. He was not hosting a mere conference for socialist parties. Rather, the entire meeting was a front to reveal his real project: a rebuilt International!\n\nThe First International was an organization of socialist parties that aimed to bridge the differences of the movements and create a unified force for workers' rights. Unfortunately, it and the Second International were torn apart by internal strife and dysfunction. The Third International, arguably the most successful, was founded by Vladimir Lenin and headed by the Soviet Union. Sablin, a major fan of Lenin, has seen fit to follow in his predecessors footsteps and create a new Communist International.\n\nSablin promises this organisation will not simply be a group of political parties following the Soviet Union, as some have criticized the Third International for. He wants it to be a group of nations. These nations will not only provide political support to one another, but they will share industrial aid as well. One day, he hopes the socialist nations of the world will be a bloc powerful enough to counterbalance the Pact, Sphere, and OFN.\n\nOn the surface, this claim seems laughable. But... there is some interest in the other attendees. And there are some benefits to greater international cooperation with similarly-aligned states. The Russians won't let us leave without an answer anyway. So do we join, or not? We can also lend our services as an observational member if we believe a full commitment isn't worth it at this time."

 BRY.54.t: "Red Dead Revolution"
 BRY.54.desc: "Mikhail Markheev whooped and waved his battered old sabre in the air as his cavalry thundered across the taiga, a huge cloud of dust rising in their wake as they charged towards the great train. His men let loose their war cry as bullets tore through the air towards them, responding with a blistering fusillade that sent the screaming defenders toppling from the train. This was living! This was what men were made for! Markheev joined his men as they drew alongside the train, leaping from their horses to the cargo-strewn flatcars, fountains of gore spilling from the guards not smart enough to jump off and make a run for it.\n\n"Forward, men! Show these plunderers the fury of the Buryats! For the revolution!" shouted Markheev, pulling his revolver and sprinting down the train towards the engine, bombarding the defenders with a hail of bullets. Reloading behind an enormous crate stamped with Chinese characters, Markheev felt the train speed up beneath him, the desperate engineers stoking the boiler to try and escape. Too late, he thought, grinning viciously as he fired wildly out from cover, a spray of blood erupting from the head of one of his enemies. Ah, what a righteous feeling, to spill the blood of plunderers and black-marketeers in the service of the revolution!\n\nDespite the glories of battle, Markheev had to admit that the result was a foregone conclusion. His troop outnumbered the defenders five-to-one and by the time they reached the front the soot-smeared engineers had their hands up in terrified surrender. So, the tyrant Yagoda thought he could control the railways, did he? He'd have a hell of a lot more trouble suppressing the revolution without his regular weapons shipment coming up from China. Markheev sneered as one of his grinning men handed him a bottle of expensive wine intended for the tyrant himself. He uncorked it with his teeth and took a swig. Taking it from Yagoda made it all the sweeter."

 BRY.55.t: "Adrift on the Tide of Memory"
 BRY.55.desc: "Otto Braun shuffled through the streets towards the Opera House, breath steaming before him in the greyness before dawn, rheumatic old knees aching in the harsh Siberian cold, boots crunching morning frost that covered the cobbles like the pall on his soul.\n\nBraun delved the pelagic depths of his memory. All these years later, his exile from Germany still lodged in his heart like a cruel dagger. The calendar had sliced years from his life and still the pain did not fade. The dim years after his flight from prison in 1928 had been marked by failure and pain, first by the annihilation of his communist allies in China, and then by the collapse of the Soviet Union into a thousand bickering shards. And still it worsened, as he learned, from the slow tide of information that rolled over the shattered Russia, that his once-lover Olga had been murdered in the Nazi deathcamps.\n\nShe had burned so bright, and the fascists had snuffed the flame within her like they had done with so many others. He had loved her, loved how she made him feel. He could still feel the thrill when she'd helped break him out of prison, and the memories of their evenings together in Moscow kept him warm on so many cold Siberian nights.\n\nAll was dust, now. Lenin's dream lay crushed, and Olga mouldered in a mass grave. Braun felt diminished, withered, broken against the wheel of time's relentless advance. He had contemplated ending his torment, more than once. Then Sablin and Pechuro had come to him in Irkutsk, speaking of revolution, of making Lenin's dream live again. They were children, vainly idealistic, and yet he couldn't help but become their mentor. What else was left to him? He would happily give his life for even the slightest chance that socialism might rise from the ashes like a phoenix.\n\nAnd yet, no matter how many years passed, Olga's face would be forever burned into his mind's eye, beaming as she'd been during their dash from the prison through the icy fields of distant Saxony."

An old man sits in his wheelchair, blanket covering his arthritic knees as he stares at the flaking paint on the wall opposite him, as he has all day long. The phonograph on the table next to him blasts the blaring tune of "The Red Army is the Strongest", crackling as the needle skips over the record. Slowly, the man's head slumps to the side, sticky drool dribbling down his bristly chin from the corner of his mouth.\n\nGenrikh Grigoreyevich Yagoda had been forgotten. Given a compassionate release from the prison farm, he remembered walking the streets, his breath steaming before him, nobody giving him a second glance. Nobody remembered the man who had tried to save Bukharin's dream from the revisionists and the upstarts. Once he had been a commander of men, and now he couldn't even shit without a nurse to help him. The memory faded, as they all seemed to these days. He couldn't keep a grasp on anything in his mind anymore. It all blew away, like autumn leaves on the wind.\n\nA light rain began to patter against the window of the empty room as the record crackled and popped like wood in a fireplace. Darkness encroached on his vision. A tear rolled down his cheek as he realized that he was not special. All he had done in his life had meant nothing. Nothing at all. His breathing slowed, his eyelids flickered. The light was dimming with every rattling breath. He saw the great yawning emptiness waiting for him, bare and cold.\n\nHe closed his eyes as a final tear dropped to the floor. Nobody was there to hear his final words as they were torn away by the skirling wind."

 BRY.57.desc: "Like so many of the native folk the Tsarists had subjugated in their endless push to the Pacific, the Buryats were a proud but deeply wounded people, their way of life mercilessly crushed beneath marching boots, thundering locomotives and roaring tank treads. Every Buryat bore that pain within their hearts, and they longed to re-assert themselves, to face the world again as a people unfettered by the bonds and traumas imposed upon them.\n\nAnd so, it came as no surprise to Sablin when Markheev approached him to request that Verkhneudinsk's name be changed as a token of recognition to the part the Buryats had played in casting down Yagoda and defeating the tyrants of the east. He suggested the name "Ulan-Ude", literally meaning "Red Ude", named for the mighty river that had sustained the Buryat people for millennia before the arrival of the Russians. Seeing the Central Committee's focus turn away from Siberia, Markheev was afraid that the Buryats' part would soon be forgotten as the seat of the revolution moved ever westward.\n\n"My comrade," said Sablin, smiling broadly and laying a reassuring hand on Markheev's shoulder, "without the might of the Buryats, we could never have brought Lenin's light back to Russia. The revolution will never forget your people, for I would not allow it.""

The Sablinites treated him well, better than he'd expected. Better than he thought he deserved for the things he'd done in the service of Yagoda. In time, Roman Denisovich Kosaryov even came to enjoy it. It was hard work, but good work. Life slowed, and he became aware of the passing of the seasons, of the simple beauty of Siberia, of the joy in raising a living thing from seed to harvest.\n\nTwelve months after his sentence was pronounced in a freezing [BRY.Capital.GetName] courthouse, the spell was broken. Kosaryov was a free man. Handed a bag holding a change of clothing and given the directions for one of the Central Committee's men's boarding houses, he stepped out onto the muddy highway, breath steaming before him. He looked left, he looked right. The sultry afternoon sun beating down on him, he began the long walk into [BRY.Capital.GetName].\n\nKosaryov arrived as the sun set behind him, casting long indigo shadows down the revolutionary city's cobbled streets. He passed a hastily painted mural of the storming of the Winter Palace. The paint was still wet. The artist had questionable skill, but even a simple man like Kosaryov could appreciate the intense emotion behind every brushstroke.\n\nNight fell as Kosaryov arrived at the little recruitment office opposite the Opera House. A Sablinite soldier closing up the shutters glanced over his shoulder at his approach.\n\n"Comrade," said Kosaryov, heaving his bag over his shoulder, "I want to join the revolution.""

To Sablin, sitting in the front row, it almost looked as though they'd never been there at all. Sablin breathed deeply, listening to the shuffling feet and murmured voices behind him. The place was packed, everyone coming to see the film, an almost immaculate print of Sergei Eisenstein's socialist masterpiece, Battleship Potemkin, unearthed from landfill in Irkutsk. As the lights dimmed and the overture began, Sablin squeezed his wife Nadezhda's hand. She looked up at him lovingly, and his eyes filled with tears at how lucky he was.\n\nIt was rapturous. The live orchestra might've been amateurs plunking away at whatever instruments they could scrounge together, but it didn't matter. The emotion coating every frame like brushstrokes on a painting needed no adornment for the film's powerful message of revolutionary hope to be felt. The audience cheered at all the appropriate moments. They jeered when the Tsarists killed the hero Vakulinchuk, and Sablin was certain he heard sobbing when the baby was killed as its carriage fell out of control down the Odessa Steps.\n\nDuring the ending, as the Tsarist fleet mutinied and flew the red flag, the audience gave a standing ovation, their cheering drowning out the orchestra. Sablin looked to the side into the grinning faces of Pechuro and Markheev. Battleship Potemkin was like an electric charge that rallied anyone who saw it. As the red flag fluttered above the Tsarist dreadnought, Sablin's doubt fell away. The socialist dream had been crushed once before, but someday soon the red flag would wave once more over Leningrad. Clapping as the light faded from the projector, Sablin vowed he'd be the one to raise it himself."

Sablin blinked as he followed the committee members into a conference room, his eyes widening at what he saw on the wall, a complete map of the Siberian Socialist Republic, from Kamtchatka in the east to the Gulf of Ob in the west. He collapsed on a chair, his breaths fast and shallow. So many people, so many families... all counting on him to ensure they are safe and free. So many people whose lives could be destroyed with a single stroke of the pen. Did he fail them that evening? What if his decisions made their lives worse than before he came to rule them. He began to shake, cursing himself under his breath when a hand extended itself. He looked up and saw it was Markheev.\n\n"Don't worry, Comrade. We got your back," Markheev said, Sablin taking his hands and getting up again.\n\n"In times of trouble, you always had us to depend on," Ulanovskaya said, giving Sablin a smile.\n\n"Always try and remember that, Comrade. We're all in this together," said Pechuro.\n\n"Look, Valery, if you're still worried, I still got some brandy in my cabinet," said Braun, patting him on the back.\n\n"Thank you comrade, but I don't think I need it," laughed Sablin as the committee left the room together."

Others may have used this opportunity to award themselves with lavish pomp and circumstance, but not him.\n\n"Congratulations, Valery, you did it. You finally united Russia" Braun said, raising a glass of his own.\n\n"No," said Sablin, raising his own glass in turn, "WE did it, you, me, the Party, the workers, everyone. I know it wasn't easy. We faced so many hardships together, so many moments of doubt and uncertainty in the journey to today. We were surrounded by enemies who believed us to be fools, who threatened us to give up on that vision we broke our backs for. I remember the first day of the mutiny against Yagoda, being so afraid and uncertain of the future ahead, wondering if I made the right choice to rebel, or if the best decision was to give up and surrender there and then.\n\nBut it wasn't. Instead, we toiled endlessly day and night to create a new Russia based on the ideals of the old, where all men and women are equal, where they can all sleep safely in their beds without fear of danger. And it was through enduring that toil and sacrifice together that it finally came to pass. The fires of the October Revolution will burn forevermore, and it's all thanks to everyone who worked so hard to bring that vision to life.

Sablin asked, turning around in his chair to face the man before him.\n\n"No police were killed in the action, though four were injured by an improvised incendiary weapon thrown by a rioter. Their panicked comrades then opened fire on the crowd with their submachine guns, and although they were dispersed, six civilians are reported to be killed in the aftermath."\n\nSablin stood, mouth agape at the news.\n\n"You are dismissed, comrade."\n\nThe officer left the room. Sablin poured out a glass of vodka as he read the official report. The workers were demanding a return to increased council autonomy; after several days of battles with the police ensued without any attempt to yield to the protests before the incident occured.\n\nHe put the papers down and looked at the portrait of Lenin above his desk. He thought of the chaos of the Civil War; of the arrests of striking workers, the riots in the countryside and the hundreds of counter-revolutionaries tortured and killed so viciously to preserve Lenin's rule.\n\nBut in the end, he prevailed, Sablin thought.

It is the WORKERS' responsibility, not ours!"\n\n"This isn't about 'keeping true to the ideals of the October Revolution', Ulanovskaya, the simple fact is that if we want to put bread on the table, we need CENTRAL, ORGANIZED planners who can make sure the workers' councils aren't starving this country to death!"\n\nSablin watched as the debate over centralized planning turned into a shouting match. Enough was enough, he thought.\n\n"Braun and Markheev have a point," he said, "We need extra oversight to ensure the councils have high enough quotas. That's three to two, and according to democratic centralism that's the final decision. Do not discuss this question further."\n\n"Do not discuss this question further? Comrade, you used to be better than this! You want-" Pechuro was suddenly interrupted.\n\n"Comrade Pechuro, not only are you violating democratic centralism, but this is the third fight you've begun about policy in a month. Continue your sectarian tendencies and you will be relieved of duty. Do you understand?" It was Sablin's turn to shout, and unnatural silence descended on the room as he did so. After what felt like hours passed by, Pechuro began to speak once more.\n\n"Yes, Sablin. I understand. But I have no interest in further participation in this committee," Pechuro replied as she exited the door. Ulanovskaya nodded her head in agreement, and followed Pechuro out.\n\nAfter the meeting, Sablin was the last of the remaining three to leave the conference room. Pechuro's words echoed in his mind, you used to be better than this. She was right. But it was for the October Revoution that he had to make such sacrifices. He was forced to fire his closest comrades by necessity. He couldn't help it. Tears welled up in his eyes, as he began to sob in the empty room."

His teeth chattered ever so slightly as he made his way across the pier to the small ship, anchored at the end of the wooden trail.\n\nValery had always loved the sea. His father had been in the navy, and he had once planned to join as well, in his youth. He remembered the summers of his childhood, swimming with his friends in lakes, pretending to reenact famous battles of the war. That felt so long ago now, he thought, shaking his head. He had no time for this.\n\n"General Secretary," the man at the end of the dock, Dzhems Chulkov, a newly minted captain of the Red Navy saluted.\n\n"She isn't much to look at I'm afraid, but she packs a punch. The first Red Navy vessel built in God knows how many years now."\n\nValery nodded. "Does she have a name, Comrade? I'm told all ships need them."\n\nThe man smiled. "The men were hoping you'd be the one to name it, Comrade General Secretary."\n\nHim? Sablin wasn't sure what to make of it. He wasn't an admiral nor a sailor - but if the people who believed in him desired it, then it would be done.\n\nHe walked the edge of the deck for a moment, thinking. The word left his lips so fast the captain had to have wondered if he had practiced.\n\n"Storozhevoy." Sentry."

It would often take a guard slamming against something with the butt of his rifle and a raw shout to awake him. What he heard one morning, however, was not the unfriendly voice of a guard who hated his being, but the warm, soothing tones of Pushkin, a man he'd met in the camp ever since he arrived.\n\nIt took him a few moments to awaken, but when he did, the words formed coherently as he stared at a dumbfounded Pushkin, who was smiling brightly. "They're here! Ilyanov, they're here!" He practically leaped towards Pushkin, who groggily moved back before being tackled down to his bed as he was locked in a tight, one-sided hug.\n\n"Who- get off me!" He muttered, and Pushkin obliged. "Who are they? You mean the Vozhd is here to execute us for being homosexuals?" He said, laughing at his own dark humor before Pushkin shook his head vigorously. "No, you idiot, it's- the camp has been liberated! Valery Sablin-" His eyes shot wide. "Has defeated the Vozhd! Don't you understand?!" The tremors already began coming up his arms, and it was difficult to keep his chipper façade up.\n\n"W-" Pushkin's eyes were lidded with tears. "W-we're free, Ilyanov. We can finally make that cabin, j-just like I promised. Remember?" Ilyanov gave a slow nod, then swallowed, lips trembling as he smiled. "Y-yes..." Ilyanov began. "I remember." He gave a short, sharp chuckle, and felt some strength come back to him as he stood up. "I told you, didn't I?" He took in a deep breath, but he couldn't prevent the liquid from dripping down his cheeks. He couldn't pretend to be strong for Pushkin. He didn't have to. Not anymore.

She sat on her knees as she awaited the announcement from Comrade Sablin, every slight move met with an irritating creak from the loose, busted floorboards. The statement was set for about 4:00 PM, and Sofia had sat around her home watching her clock like a hawk up until the very last minute.\n\nNow she listened as Sablin's words began to take form. Steeped in static and with wavering volume, the speech still felt clear as day to Sofia.\n\n"Good afternoon, Comrades. Many of my advisors and I have realized that, although we have striven for equality both at home and in the workplace, there is still a group among us that could not rightly be called free or equal. Today, let it be known that the women of Buryatia and Russia at large will be considered equal in the eyes of their male comrades, for how can we call ourselves revolutionaries if we still leave our Russian sisters in their shackles?"\n\nSofia shot to her feet, the floorboards squealing at the sudden movement, as thoughts ran wild through her mind. However, childlike excitement gave way to deep worry as a new thought passed: how would they enforce this? She already knew the answer, and it saddened her. They couldn't. Pretty words mean nothing to those that won't listen.\n\n"Someday," she muttered as she, resigned to her fate, went to hang up her husband's clothes before he returned home. As she left, however, something caught her eye - a hatchet, leaning against the back door. Ever since she was a little girl, she had wanted to chop the firewood, but it was always her brother's job, they said it wasn't 'woman's work'. Then, it hit her. This announcement wasn't a mandate, it was a blank check for her own personal revolution. So, she decided, today she would do what she wanted. Sofia hefted up the axe and went to chop wood; Dmitri could do his own laundry."

Crowds had gathered around a training camp, men, women, and children all waiting in hushed, heavy silence or a low babble of conversation. The word had spread organically enough, although occasionally mentioned on the radio and in the papers. Some, resistant to change, had dreaded it while others had warily but openly welcomed this progress.\n\nToday, five soldiers would become the first women of the revolutionary warlord state to pass combat training and receive full colors and rank as official members of the army. So, this disparate throng of people stood and awaited the news. Reporters stood calmly, scratching down descriptions poetic, informative, or anything in between for their papers. Women and girls stood eagerly, afraid to voice their excitement but watching like hawks. Old men grumbled, much more candidly exchanging their discomfort with the change. All were silent, however, when five women exited the small building in full uniform.\n\nAfter moments of cautiously judging the atmosphere, the cheers and jeers erupted from the mixed crowds as the soldiers made their way to the newly christened Women's Barracks. Most were civil; a rose was tossed, but as was a stone. The women kept their resolve, and soon the day continued as any other day, with one change. Many were left pondering on both their own potential or their previous prejudices. No one could be sure what would happen next, but one thing is certain: times are changing."

Shifting his gaze back downward, he began to read the report: "On the Status of the Proletariat."\n\nA slew of various retellings of industrial accidents, worker complaints, safety hazards and calls for employment laid upon the page. Unemployment was up, accidents were down in number but up in severity, and the masses overall seemed to be suffering. Calmly sipping his coffee, Sablin scrutinized the report for ten minutes while thick, tense silence hung in the air around the ASSR officials.\n\nLastly, Sablin came to the end of the third page, a tidy little list of two options. One, a simple plan to increase regulation and improve workplace democracy. Another, pushed by Braun, was to work on increasing infrastructure, reasoning that the improvements to society would make their way down to the workers.\n\nThe General Secretary cut the silence with a concise response."

They had received a message from the new General Secretary of Siberia, Valery Sablin, summoning them to a meeting. The councillors stood in the cold for about half an hour, before a truck stopped in front of them and the young General Secretary stepped out. He approached the councillors, hand extended. "Comrades!" he began, but he was immediately cut off;\n\n"We're not your comrades, statist." one of the councillors retorted. Sablin frowned, each of the men before him looked at him in disdain and refused to shake his hand. He sighed and dropped his hand back to his side, continuing;\n\n"I presume you know why I'm here? To-"\n\n"To dissolve our councils and instate your own rule? To chase us off with some NKVD thugs?"\n\n"Quite the contrary, comrades," Sablin said, smiling slightly.

Come, it's cold out here and we can continue this conversation inside."\n\nThe councillors stood silently, had they been too rash in presuming that Sablin was merely another oppressor?

Squads of policemen stared down the workers, but that was to be expected, they concluded after years of despotism. What was not expected, however, was the large armored car that pulled up to the city square. The protestors were dumbfounded as none other than Valery Sablin walked out and ordered the police to stand down.\n\n"Excuse me, comrades!" shouted Sablin, "I would like to speak with the leader of this protest!"\n\nThe workers let a man with a scar on his left cheek out of the way, who met Sablin near the center of the square.\n\n"I heard this protest is over the recent shortages of food.

He had considered fleeing at times, leaving the foundry behind for a better life, but he knew that even if he wasn't caught, his wife and children would undoubtedly suffer either at the hands of the Vozhd's thugs, or from the family's only source of income being severed.\n\nOne might ask then why he stayed at the same job for all those long years, the Vozhd had been deposed long ago, was he not free to work wherever he pleased? Yet to Artyom, despite being the same factory under Sablin as it was under Rodzaevsky, it was an entirely new job. His working hours were shorter, his pay was better, he had easy access to healthcare and his labor was being put towards improving his city, producing steel girders for public housing. What's more, his wife was now able to work at the steel foundry alongside him, and their children would be cared for while they were at work.

When General Secretary Sablin's forces swept through the city of Magadan, he had no reason to expect a change in this pattern.\n\nAnd yet after all of those years, he, an ordinary citizen of Magadan, finally stood before a ballot.

Ever since he was a boy, he had wanted nothing more than to share his mother's delicious pirozhki recipe with the world. Now that she was no longer with him, now four feet underground with her beloved husband, he felt the best way he could honor her memory would be to share her delicious food with the rest of Russia.\n\nNearing the front of the line, he imagined the store. A sign in front, saying "Aleksei's Homemade Pirozhkis." Perhaps a young boy or two to help him work the store. Children and adults alike streaming in to get a taste of his sweet treats. Watching them leave with smiles and jam spread across their faces. It was going to be everything he dreamed of.\n\nAs he finalized the details of his business registration, he couldn't help but grin like a madman. His pastries would become famous, he dreamt, imagining the people coming from the nearby towns, and perhaps one day in a unified Motherland, all across Russia. With enough work, perhaps he would be successful enough to open another store in another town. Perhaps his son, just three years old now, would carry on his legacy and he would retire to the countryside assured his Pirozhki's would continue to serve the people of Russia...\n\nClearing out the bottom floor of his house to create a restaurant space, he saw it laid out in front of him. He could picture over there a booth, over there some chairs, a few standing tables, maybe even outdoor seating for the hot summer days. The sky was the limit. Because, for the first time in Aleksei's life, a store was truly his, and that is a great feeling."

Excitedly, he had charged too little at first, and soon found himself having to raise prices, take small loans from friends, and now business was worse than ever. Recently a man had come to him, an entrepreneurial and snappy type, dressed sharply and talking quickly. He had promised him quite a large sum of money, but not as much as he had spent on the store, in exchange for the ownership of his store. He had said no at first, but the second time the man came around he had seen no choice but to give it some more serious thought. Aleksei simply could not afford to run the store much longer.\n\nNow, the man came around a third time. However, this time he came around the block escorted by several police officers with his hands cuffed. Aleksei could not help but run out and ask some of the ones trailing behind what he had been arrested for, given his relation to the man. The police officer responded, "This man is guilty of monopolizing. He was caught trying to buy out a store around the street, and was caught when a kind old woman told us of the man's actions."\n\nAleksei was speechless. The man had been conducting illegal activity, and had tried to involve himself in it! Racing back inside, Aleksei felt a newfound burst of confidence for his business. In the following days, he worked tirelessly on banners, new recipes, and business skyrocketed. By the end of the week, he had paid back substantial amounts of his loans, and found himself laughing privately to his wife about how foolish he had been to consider selling the store.\n\nSurely enough, his pirozhkis became a favorite of the town. Any who stopped by were directed his way, and his store became a staple of the community. Selling hundreds a day, he continued to live frugally, preferring to spend his money on improving his store and helping others. If the monopolizer had been allowed to roam free, none of this would've been possible."

For the past few years Degeryakov has been very active at opposing the centralization measures and supports local autonomy. I don't believe he's part of the Party?"\n\nSablin shook his head.\n\n"No, that won't do. We need to be united if we are to survive the capitalist onslaught, and we can't have outside sectarians tear this country apart right now. Get the local Party officials to vote on it."\n\nThe secretary sat down and began to type Sablin's orders down on a typewriter. As he heard the clicking of the keys, he sighed. It was difficult ignoring the will of the people so blatantly. However, there was nothing in the constitution saying he couldn't do this, and Russia had to be united and centralized for the workers to prosper, he thought.

The men of the 78th Battalion made no verbal complaints, yet each of them silently doubted their officer's intuition. Were they not soldiers? Was this not a training ground? For the past few weeks they had been through the same daily routine of physical training and learning military theory, of course they've read a few manuals during training, but a book?\n\nThe officer picked up one of the books and displayed it to the soldiers. Its cover was plain, the only image adorning it was one of a black hammer and sickle, and above it the title, 'State and Revolution'.\n\nThe officer quickly looked over the battalion and began speaking. "Comrades, I can see that you are wary of a disruption of your usual training. But a disciplined mind is just as important as a disciplined body. You will each receive a copy of Lenin's State and Revolution, and you will read through it as part of your training."\n\nThe men who had brought the boxes began distributing the books to the rest of the soldiers, and they were dismissed to begin reading."

Soldiers in full dress uniform goose stepped past him in perfect precision, seemingly more machine than human. These were not liberated workers celebrating their freedom, he mused, they were cogs in a vast machine.\n\nA machine of his making.\n\nTyrants like Yagoda watched every moment and listened to every word of their subjects lest they question their absolute power, but he needed to restrict freedom of expression lest reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries destroy his revolutionary regime. Where Yagoda would kill hundreds simply because they questioned his rule, Sablin merely imprisoned them for threatening innocent workers and gave them chances for rehabilitation.\n\nAnd look at Russia now, he thought. Where once a vast array of squabbling reactionary warlords fought amongst themselves, a workers paradise was built, where proletarians of all races no longer feared the bombs of the fascists, or gunshots of a local thug. Russia was safe, now. Russia was free.\n\nBut something essential was lost in that liberation, Sablin realized as he watched the regiments march past him, guns shouldered and the tanks behind them."

The bleeding from the wound in his back had slowed, but all these hours later he could still feel his life's blood seeping out into the filth beneath him. He couldn't feel anything below his waist. Breathing raggedly, staring up at the white, white sky, Kosaryov found himself travelling to strange and half-forgotten places.\n\nAll those memories came back, now, at the threshold. The pain and deprivation of his family fleeing into the east as the fascists tore at the corpse of Russia, the trauma of the terrible things he'd done in the NKVD in Yagoda's service, the hand of forgiveness offered to him by the Sablinites. Forgiveness he'd never felt he'd deserved, and had strived for months to repay in the revolution's service against the eastern rightists and the enemies of Lenin to the west. He felt no resentment at his abandonment, these things happened in war. Men died. Men were forgotten. The old battlefields of humanity were littered with scattered bones never to make their way back to be buried by loved ones.\n\nKosaryov could feel himself fading. He had never been a religious man, but in this moment he prayed with all his heart that he would see his long-dead family again in the land beyond that dark, yawning gateway. As the cold Siberian breeze gusted over him, as his final misting breath steamed upwards, Kosaryov heard his mother's voice, as though from a great distance. "Romka," she said, as she'd called him when he was a child, "Romka, Romka."\n\nThe final thing Roman Denisovich Kosaryov felt before he slid into eternal darkness was the strange, half-remembered smell from so long ago of his mother's ambrosial perfume, as though it drifted down from the sky.\n\nRoman let go with a smile on his face."

Whatever the hell "Ordosocialism" was supposed to be, it sure had attracted its fair share of gullible morons."

 BRY.86.t: "An American Proposition"
 BRY.86.desc: "Papers shuffled as the Central Committee began their meeting, starting with the same informal discussions that started every meeting of the committee. But this meeting had the unusual characteristic of having, on its agenda, the first order of business be related to the recently arrived American envoy consisting of diplomats and businessmen. They desired an audience with the Central Committee, in private.\n\nWhen the Committee agreed to the conditions, the envoy arrived into the conference room. In fancy suits, the leader, a diplomat calling himself 'John Doe', thanked the Committee for giving the group an opportunity that would "be beneficial to both of our nations." 'Doe' then cleared the floor, allowing for one of the uncomfortable businessmen to step forward.\n\n"I am a representative of the Disney corporation," he said, speaking Russian, "and my fellow diplomats propose to offer an international exhibition that would show off the qualities of both our nations." He then snapped his fingers, and two men came forward, handing out documents to Committee members. "The plan is for an exhibition in Disneyland, depicting Russian culture, and for another one in Magadan showcasing American culture. They will be run by their respective governments. The exact details can be worked out to both of our satisfaction."\n\nAfter a bit of questioning, Sablin asked for a moment of privacy, which the envoy respected. "The bitches are going to fuck us with this," said a Sablinite. "They'll fill the minds of our children with lies."\n\n"And what of our children's comfort, eh?" asked a Bukharinite, his voice filled with sarcasm.\n\nAs the Committee argued, Sablin asked Braun. "Is this worth it? I am skeptical of its benefits." Braun responded, "It will certainly increase our economic output."\n\nAfter much discussion, the men were brought back in, and given the opinion of the Committee:"
 BRY.86.a: ""We'll do it.""
 
 BRY.87.t: "The American National Exhibition"
 BRY.87.desc: "Sablin walked down the streets of Magadan, his entourage of friends and loyalists following him as he inspected the various exhibits that had been set up by the Americans. He did have to admit, despite his skepticism, it seemed to be a genuinely good idea. Everywhere, men and women could finally witness the type of life they could have: a life where kitchens would take the burden off the overworked housewife, where clothing could be both beautiful and comfortable, and where a family could live in a big, comfortable home.\n\nStill, Sablin had his problems. Walking into the art exhibit was like walking into the palace of a rich businessman, and the art itself was less than up to his standards of quality. The music, while aesthetically pleasing, had an element of capitalistic worship, and he did not even want to begin on the history exhibit that white washed America's role in world affairs, and to say nothing of their treatment of the Negro.\n\nBut, overall, it was interesting, if nothing else. America's technological exhibits, depicting their cars and planes, were top of the line.\n\nAfter wandering the exhibit, he and his party met with some American executives. After introductions, they began discussing ways to get equipment into the country -- better tractors, better medical equipment, oil drills, etc. It was a productive meeting, and ended with all parties satisfied as to the payment of such services.\n\n"Mr. Sablin?" asked one, holding a metal can in his hand. "Yes?" replied Sablin, about to walk out of the meeting. "Have you ever heard of 'Pepsi'?"\n\n"I do not think I have."\n\nThe man extended the blue and white can forward, smiling. "Drink, I think you'll like it."\n\nSablin eyed it with some suspicion, but, eventually, took the can and took a sip.\n\n"What do you think?""
 BRY.87.a: ""It's delicious. Do you have any more?""
 
 BRY.88.t: "The Far Eastern Exhibition"
 BRY.88.desc: "Susanna Pechuro waved a fan across her face as she walked down the sidewalk of Disneyland, watching over the exhibitions. Sweat was pouring down her face, and she felt it in places she didn't realize could sweat. Why did Sablin have to choose her of all people to come down here to this damnable hellscape! Couldn't he have picked Braun instead? It wasn't like she was a big fan of the idea to begin with.\n\nShe sighed, fanning harder as she passed by a Buryat music exhibit. If there was one good thing about this, it was that Americans would realize Russia was a diverse place. Russia and Buryatian culture often stood side by side, with experts on the countries making sure to clear any misunderstandings.\n\nShe stopped in front of a military exhibit. In front, two soldiers of different genders spoke to a man jabbing a microphone into their faces. "So, Mister...?" "Vladimir," responded the man in broken English. "So, Vladimir, what is it like in your nation?" "It is a place of diversity, a place where all men and women are equal. Comrade Sablin led us to victory against oppressors, and helped free the East's people."\n\nPechuro shuttered, walking away in disgust. She understood, rationally, that this was important. The OFN needed to see they weren't a bunch of warlords, that they had support from the people. But this was disgusting! Parading her nation like some commodity to be sold to the highest bidder! Was this not a violation of Lenin's ideals?\n\nSuddenly, she heard a voice. "Mommy mommy," said a little girl, "is she a soldier?" Turning around, Susanna saw a mother holding a child's hand. "Yes, sweetie. Are they not fascinating?"\n\nSusanna sighed. Perhaps some good could come from this if nothing else."
 BRY.88.a: "Damn you, Braun."
 
 BRY.89.t: "A Visit From Havana"
 BRY.89.desc: "Fidel Castro was grinning. He grasped Sablin's hands with both of his own and turned to the camera, which concluded its business in a succession of flashes. "What you've achieved for socialism in Russia is exceptional, Valery," said Castro. "I have been following the events here for a long time. The Cuban people will be happy to offer you whatever assistance they can."\n\nSablin accepted the flattery with a smile. "I am very happy you are here, Fidel. I am also an admirer of your country." And the visit proceeded thus, with both men dancing around one another, Sablin offering economic ties and brotherhood, Castro professing eternal friendship and socialist solidarity. Any initial fears of awkwardness had been quickly disposed of, Sablin noted with satisfaction. Both their propagandists would have a field day.\n\nYet as he returned to the plane, Castro's face darkened. He lit a cigar and settled into his seat, turning to his secretary. "Sablin is a good man, generous and kind," he said. "But soft." The secretary nodded slightly. Castro's mind raced now. He had seen first hand the truth of Lenin's famous dictum, that a revolution could not be made in velvet gloves. Yet Sablin seemed more determined that his people love him than with the strength of Revolutionary Socialism. And even should he take Russia, would such a man be able to keep it?\n\nCastro stabbed the remains of his cigar into an ashtray, watching as the light died."
 BRY.89.a: "Better Havana than this wasteland."
 
 BRY.90.t: "A Visit to London"
 BRY.90.desc: "As with most of Valery Sablin's decisions, it had started out idealistically. Pechuro would make a visit to London, and with the [ENG.GetRulingParty] in power she'd quickly forge a bond with their English comrades and come home with another foreign policy victory under the Far Eastern Soviet Republic's belt. As she was quickly learning, the geopolitical reality was not quite so simple.\n\n"Mrs. Pechuro," the Foreign Ministry official explained calmly but forcefully, "As it stands England's main geopolitical concerns are in western Europe, and that situation is not changing any time soon. We have no need for your assistance, and no assurance that your government can survive even a few years longer. Likewise, there is little that you gain from us, aside some empty words of friendship, and I assume you weren't looking for those when you arrived. We are sympathetic to your struggle, but there are simply no ways we can justify building extensive ties at this time."\n\nPechuro had to agree, but she didn't want to leave empty-handed. "If any long-term agreements are out of the question, would you still perhaps accept an embassy? It gives us international legitimacy, and England would lose precisely nothing from the arrangement." Pechuro's interpreter relayed the request, and the official visibly considered the offer.\n\n"That seems perfectly acceptable. I'll let the Foreign Ministry know. Good luck out there, Mrs. Pechuro. If your state can survive with so few friends and so little support, you may just build something extraordinary." Pechuro hoped so too. It was lonely in the Far East, and they could use all the recognition they could get."
 BRY.90.a: "A token victory, but a victory nonetheless."
 
 BRY.91.t: "Communal Blues"
 BRY.91.desc: ""Goddammit Vasily..." Elley grumbled, looking across his mess of a kitchen. Well, it wasn't really his; he and his fiancee had been provided with lodging in the communal apartments, but sadly they had to share the kitchen with several other families.\n\nAnd Vasily. Vasily rarely used the kitchen as he was rarely home, spending most of his evenings out drinking with his buddies and doing god knows what else, but whenever he was home he left the kitchen in a state like a hurricane had come through. For a plate of scrambled eggs, he had left a sizeable puddle of milk on the floor, three broken plates in the sink, and a wayward slice of bread that had somehow ended up unreachable on top of the ceiling fan.\n\nElley went to fetch a broom to knock the bread off the ceiling fan, calling out to his fiancee, "Hey, Ayta? Vasily did it again."\n\n"Dammit." Ayta shuffled down the stairs, placing her hands on her hips as she entered the kitchen whistling, "He really does know how to outdo himself, doesn't he?" She continued as she began fishing the broken plates out of the sink.\n\n"At least in Harbin the rats in the tenements didn't leave literal puddles of milk lying around."\n\n"That isn't funny," replied Ayta, shaking her head, "We're lucky to have a place this nice to stay, free from persecution."\n\n"I know I know... just a bit more privacy would be nice, is all."\n\n"It'll come in time, I'm sure Vasily will get kicked out at some point.""

 BRY.92.t: "What More Do They Need?"
 BRY.92.desc: "Heated discussion was occurring in the chambers of the Central Committee, and Sablin could swear the tension in the room could be cut with a knife. The topic was the rights of homosexuals, which naturally drove quite a rift between more socially conservative members of the committee, and those that wanted Buryatia's social reforms to be more far-reaching. However, Sablin had already made his decision on what position to take, unknown to the Committee, and all that remained was to reveal it to them.\n\n"Comrade Sablin, what do you think?" Braun asked him suddenly. The discussion started to die down as the Committee turned to look at Sablin. "You've been rather quiet this whole time."\n\n"I wanted to give you all a chance to voice your thoughts first, but my mind remains unchanged." Sablin replied firmly. "We will follow in the footsteps of Lenin, and maintain the current position. Decriminalization will be continued, but no more."\n\nThere were audible grumbles and contemptuous mutters from those who had wanted to secure greater rights for the homosexuals, which saddened Sablin for a moment. However, one could not lead without at least disappointing some people."

They had marched to beat of the Vozhd, they had fought for the same dream as him, and just like him they had been beaten and defeated.\n\nThe only thing that had saved him from their fate of "rehabilitative labor" was his age, perhaps these new Bolsheviks had some sort of "morality" unlike those that came before. He dismissed the thought almost immediately. These were the worshippers of those that burned Tambov and pillaged Siberia after all, if they had any morality they wouldn't have fought against the dream of liberating Russia from Bolshevism.\n\nWhatever the case, it was out of his hands now. The dream was dead and so was any chance of revenge against those that had butchered his family."

 BRY.94.t: "The Red Tide"
 BRY.94.desc: "Looking carefully from tree to tree in the forest for any sign of enemy movement, Captain Orlov was tense, pacing back and forth quickly in an attempt to calm himself, and the soldiers around him looked worried and whispered among themselves. Suddenly, he heard footsteps behind him, and whipped out his pistol to aim it at the newcomer, who immediately put his hands up. "Oh. It's just you, Komarov." Lowering his gun, he nodded at Komarov, a local they had recruited to scout for them. "Status report. What are we facing?"\n\nKomarov's previously alarmed face turned into a grimace as he lowered his hands. "Not good, sir. Your men are outnumbered three to one, and they're much better equipped. Artillery, trucks, explosives, you name it. They've got it all. It's a real army you're facing, this time."\n\n"Well," And here Orlov spat on the ground. "If they're a real army, I guess we'll have to settle for being a real pain in the ass." A roar of laughter spread among the gathered soldiers. "You don't have to come if you don't want, Komarov. Thank you, sincerely, for everything. Sergeant Zaitsev, Sergeant Kozlov, go find the rest of the men and get them ready. We're going to hit them before they can hit any of us."\n\nAs they nodded and ran off, Komarov saluted Orlov suddenly. "Sir! I'm afraid I cannot accept leaving you all behind." His hand fell to his side. "I was skeptical of you all at first but... I've really come to believe in your cause. I'm beginning to think that, with people like you in power, Russia, my family, all of us might finally have a shot at freedom and prosperity. So if getting there means defeating these bastards, then count me in!"\n\nA cheer erupted, and Orlov patted Komarov on the back with a wild grin. "Well said, comrade." He handed him his pistol. "Welcome to the revolution.""

 BRY.95.t: "Keeping the Lights On"
 BRY.95.desc: "Few could deny that the Irkutsk hydroelectric power station was a marvel of engineering, providing clean electrical power to the region and the city for which it was named. Few could also deny that the dam was completed in less than ideal circumstances, the aftermath of the fall of the Union and the steady disintegration of the Far Eastern Soviet. Such conditions meant that substandard materials often had to be used in its construction, leading to longstanding concerns over the reliability of many of its parts.\n\nIt appears that such concerns have now been validated; one of the eight turbines which generated electricity has recently suffered an engineering casualty. An investigation has concluded that the turbine was poorly built, the lack of high-quality materials leading to suffering from substandard metallurgy and its failure long before its supposed life expectancy.\n\nAs we currently lack the specialized tools to replace the failed turbine, our only recourse is to dispatch a team to acquire the necessary parts to bring it back to working order. An expedition is already being outfitted to travel south into Mengjiang to hopefully acquire the necessary parts."
 BRY.95.a: "We shall wish them luck."

 BRY.96.t: "Russians from the North"
 BRY.96.desc: "A group of Russians has recently arrived from the north, inquiring to one of our state-owned businesses about the possibility of purchasing some parts needed to repair a damaged electric turbine. While we do not have the means to produce such complex equipment, we do have contacts within the Japanese Zaibatsu who can procure them on our behalf.\n\nThe Russians stated that they would compensate us handsomely if we get them the parts, but there are concerns about trustworthiness and the ability to provide the necessary payment to cover the costs. Others are saying that we should take the risk as their proposed compensation should be more than enough to turn us a tidy profit."
 BRY.96.a: "Give them the parts, for a price of course."
 BRY.96.b: "No, we can't trust them, send them back."

 BRY.97.t: "A Message from Mengjiang"

The parts themselves have come from Japan and should be of much higher quality then the substandard materials the turbine was originally built from.\n\nWhile it may have come at a high cost, our expedition is now returning home in triumph parts in tow, having successfully completed their mission."

 #Smuta Events
 RUS.smuta.BRY.1.t: "Assemble the Command"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.1.desc: "Light conversation filled the room as cabinet members and generals alike eagerly waited for Sablin's arrival. The sound of a door swinging open brought all of that to a close. Valery Sablin strode in and took his seat. After a brief pause to take out his notes, he began addressing the group assembled before him.\n\n"My comrades, thank you for coming," he opened. "We have already overcome much, and yet there is much more to come. Long have we dreamed of this day, but there shall be no more delay." Sablin waited a moment, before continuing forward. "Yes, my friends, the time has finally come to spread the revolution to the Far East!"\n\nUpon hearing the news the assembled began applauding, and some cheered. Sablin let them clap, and when they sat down a few seconds afterwards he continued politely, formally, but forcefully.\n\n"We must prepare for war. The fascists, monarchists, and capitalists will not submit to us willingly. There is much work to be done, and the tyrants and despots around will not be happy to see us: we must be strong before we face them." He paused, taking a sip of water. "We must rally every man and woman in our nation for the cause, for it is only when our hearts and minds are united can we truly dream of uniting the nation."\n\nAt the mention of the word 'nation', some of the generals looked around nervously. The region, yes. The nation? That seemed much more difficult. Sablin noticed, changing his speech accordingly.\n\n"Regardless, I am confident that we are more than up to the task. We will unite this nation under one banner - our banner, the banner of socialism!" Sablin's voice rose, stirring in the people a fervor for the future promised. "And I know that we will be victorious in the end. Long live the socialist revolution!""

"and the past shows that the armed forces are a perfect breeding ground for what are existential threats to our nation: reactionary and counterrevolutionary thought."\n\nSusanna shifted uncomfortably in her chair, staring into the wall. She didn't disagree with anything Mikhail was saying, so why did she feel like something terrible was about to happen?\n\n"We need to deal with these threats before they become problems. This body will need to monitor and engage in covert operations against our enemies. That is why I propose that we bring back the Cheka."\n\nThat shocked her up and out of her seat. Standing up suddenly, Susanna shook her head as she addressed the meeting.\n\n"No. Absolutely not. I've heard many bad ideas from you, Mikhail, but this may be the worst. Bringing back the secret police? What are you thinking?"\n\n"She's right, you know." Maya said. "For someone who claims to know history, you seem to have conveniently forgotten about it. First it's the Cheka, then it's a straight line the Red Terror all over again. We are not going back to the past."\n\nAs he watched his cabinet argue about whether the horrors of the Terror were inevitable, Sablin closed his eyes to think. When he opened them again, he silenced the group as he spoke: carefully, politely, yet firmly.\n\n"Mikhail has a point. We cannot be naive about what reactionaries can do to us. I agree with him - we must restore the Cheka.""

 RUS.smuta.BRY.3.t: "The Question of Integration"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.3.desc: "The three of them met out in the field near one of the villages that was to be assimilated into the burgeoning nation. It wasn't a particularly important place, to be certain, but Sablin had decided that they needed some perspective on what was a difficult question. There they stood, strangers in a strange land, wondering just what to do with all the new people they were to govern.\n\n"There is no need to be so harsh on them," Otto started. "They may have lived under a very different regime, but should we not be confident in our own? We are no oppressors: in fact, we have liberated many from their chains. The merits of our socialism will speak for themselves, and soon they will be enthusiastic comrades of ours."\n\n"It's not that simple," Maya countered. "How are you so confident? The roots of reactionary thought are deep in their hearts, in their minds - yes, even those villagers you can see in the distance. We must be careful not to let this thought rot our society, and so we must do everything that we can to destroy them."\n\nSablin wasn't focusing on the conversation, instead rolling the problem over and over again in his head. There was no question that the ASSR was a socialist state, and that it must remain that way. But that approach had its issues, and a more measured, gradual assimilation could work too."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.3.a: "As they talked well into the night, they made no decision."

 RUS.smuta.BRY.4.t: "The Remnants of Reaction"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.4.desc: "Lenora resisted a grimace when she saw the library. Most of the time, libraries and schools, where the majority of literature was, were small or otherwise relatively easy to get through. This one was much bigger, and was going to take a long time to scour, especially with just the two of them. She glanced at her partner, who has a similar expression of dismay on his face. "It's big," Pyotr finally said.\n\n"Big," Lenora agreed, then sighed. "Might as well get started."\n\nHe concurred, and they entered the library, grabbed a few carts, set up a place in the center of the library to begin their work. Russia was filled with so much dangerous and reactionary literature and propaganda - all of which had only seen a resurgence since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Fortunately, Sablin had taken steps to rectify this danger.\n\nShe was pleasantly surprised that this place had a fair amount of socialist material. That would make her job easier, since those books could stay. Works by democrats, liberals, or other non-socialist authors were more difficult, and they had to use their on judgement on if to keep or discard them.\n\nReactionist thought was always a risk, especially from liberals, but she tended to err on the side of allowance. After all, it was sometimes worthwhile to understand the bourgeoisie perspective - and sometimes they even had a few points. Sometimes it was hard to determine from just book titles, but she did her best. What remained beyond that was far simpler.\n\nFascist, monarchist, and religious works were set aside to be incinerated. It was far past time such materials were permanently destroyed. Together, she and Pyotr worked all day in the library, ensuring there remained as little reactionary material as possible. Tedious work it was, but she knew it was important."

From the red in his cheeks, the unrelenting unrealistic optimism, the socialist certainly couldn't be older than twenty-five - and he couldn't understand most of what he was saying. It wasn't that Maksim wanted to understand, either, because this was just the same old nonsense over and over again.\n\nSo they walked along the street, just the two of them, the young man prattling on about communism and the Revolution, stuffing as many meaningless polysyllabic words into his speech - bourgeoisie, dialectic, proletariat - until Maksim tuned out, thinking instead of how he needed to go back to his badly-paid job at the plant tomorrow, and this was just a waste of time-\n\n"Of course, you'll get to demand fair pay, and we'll make sure that you and the rest get a say in the workplace, and-"\n\nMaksim stopped in the middle of the street, and the young socialist almost tripped, falling off-balance. That had caught his attention: the proposition that maybe the badly-paid job didn't need to be badly-paid. If what the young man said was true, then maybe there was something good here.\n\nHe turned to the socialist, who by now had steadied himself. "That's the first interesting thing you've said all morning. What was your name, again?"\n\n"Andrei." The young socialist flashed a smile with all the confidence that only the young can have. "Let us help you. Join us, and we can make sure that you get exactly what you deserve from your boss."\n\nAndrei extended a hand to Maksim."

It was almost 3am, and it was only now that she was out of the office, bleary-eyed and feeling completely spent. There was just so much to be done and so little time to do all of it, and it was decidedly more difficult than it looked on paper.\n\nAs she was walking on the street back to her home, a warm voice, seemingly from nowhere, called out to her. "Susanna, is that you?" it said. "What are you doing here?"\n\nIt was Sablin. Come to think of it, she hadn't seen him for a couple of days, but he was smiling, and happy, too. The two of them walked together, speaking as they went. Tired as he was, Sablin listened closely as Susanna spoke.\n\n"... and you know this morning, there was an incident we had to deal with," she said. "There was a group there - I don't know who among them got the idea - who were planning to assassinate one of our generals. We got there in time, but then we had to run off to deal with something else, and-" She trailed off, letting the two of them rest in the silence for a moment.\n\n"We knew it wouldn't be easy." Sablin responded. "It will take time and energy. But I want to encourage you to take heart. Look around you," he said, pointing at the streets around them, "and see what we've built."\n\nSusanna was proud of what they'd achieved. Smiling mothers, the shouts of the liberated. Yes, there was much to celebrate.\n\n"We have laid the foundation for a society that will be better than the one we inherited." he continued.

It was always nice to go out, the three men together, and just shoot the breeze and talk about the good old days, if there even were good things to remember in the past.\n\nBut there was always the underlying sadness of what had happened to the Soviet Union. Hope became despair, dreams became nightmares, and the whole project could easily be considered a failure, Yagoda being the worst failure of them all. Now the three men were here thinking whether it was even a good idea to link their nation to the old Union or not.\n\n"Well, I think we shouldn't hide from it." Mikhail said. "We are as legitimate as anyone out there. The earlier we get to it, the better. We should at least do it before some pretender gets to it."\n\n"The name of the Union is dragged through the mud," Sablin countered, "because of that Yagoda. You are suggesting we tie our reputation - no, our very nation itself - to that autocratic brute?"\n\n"It is not an easy decision," Otto replied. "but we are the continuation of the Supreme Soviet: there is a straight line from them to us. They will associate it with us regardless. And, yes, it was flawed. Many things are. We can rebuild it."\n\nSablin took a sip of his drink. He had wanted to move past Yagoda's legacy completely, to toss everything that the man did onto the ash heap of history and burn it all.

Mikhail? Maya?" Susanna jabbed her finger at them. "What on earth is wrong with you?"\n\n"Listen, woman." Mikhail replied. "First of all, it's not starvation. It's war rationing.

Four heads turned to him, all waiting to see how he would break the impasse.\n\n"I've seen the numbers. Believe me, I have thought for hours - tried to find any other solution, any other way to avoid having to do this to our people." Sablin paused, letting out a sigh before hardening his face.\n\n"We must do this. This is no choice: we can not and will not survive otherwise.

Other workers grumbled the same under their breath, their tools falling rhythmically against the tunnel interior. With each load of coal rolled up the shaft, Yuri felt himself grow ever wearier.\n\nOrders had trickled down some days ago, doubling his quota and hours below the earth. Orders that had, of course, come from Sablin. Another miner had griped that they had simply traded one slavemaster for another. Yuri was quick to snap that Sablin had greatly improved their working conditions. Yes, the increased quotas and hours were unwelcome and grueling. Yes, Yuri was tired and his back and feet ached as much as they had under Yagoda. Still, Yuri kept his faith in Sablin."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.9.a: "Every worker must do his part."

 RUS.smuta.BRY.10.t: "Duty of the Revolutionary Citizen"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.10.desc: "The scratch and scrape of pens and pencils on paper filled the room as the villagers huddled around old schoolhouse desks. "Comrade," began one letter, "I eagerly await news of your return from the front. Every day, we thank our good fortune that we have soldiers like you fighting against the forces of Reaction."\n\n"Return home soon," said another, "we're all counting on you to finish the fight against the fascists, but we also expect you home safe and in one piece."\n\n"The children are playing soldier and wish they could grow to be as brave as you. You are an inspiration to us all."\n\nCommissar Igorevich smiled as he peered over the hunched shoulders. The letter writing initiative was proving to be a success already, with bags of mail being delivered to the soldiers on the front each day. Morale had noticeably improved, and the soldiers took heart in the fact that the people they were protecting valued them so. Igorevich allowed himself to lean against the wood of the old schoolhouse. The People wrote not because they had been ordered to, but because they loved their comrades."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.10.a: "Victory will be won with the heart as well as bullets."

 RUS.smuta.BRY.11.t: "Why We Fight"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.11.desc: "Dirt clung tenaciously to Elvira's sweaty skin, an accumulation of a hard day's training. Every inch of her ached, her body pushed to near total exhaustion by the demands of the sergeants and orders of the commissars. Elvira was not alone in her fatigue, and in their bunks, her comrades lay complaining or silent from their recent exertion. The air stank of sweat and body odor, but Elvira didn't mind. Though hardly able to move, she took pride in what she had accomplished that day.\n\nThe stamp of boots at the doorway brought the whole bunkhouse to attention, the recruits scrambling to their feet and at attention as Commissar Ivanov entered. "At ease, comrades," he began, the craggy-faced veteran of the Great Patriotic War scanning the room. "It has come to my attention that some of you believe that you are fighting for the ASSR. I am here to correct this misconception." Confused glances were exchanged between the recruits. Why else would they be here? "You are not fighting for the ASSR. You are the ASSR. Just as you are soldiers, you are citizens, workers, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers. You are the lifeblood of our Revolution. You are not here for the pay, you are here because you believe in Comrade Sablin, because you believe in a socialist future where all may receive their due. Behind you are those who cannot defend themselves, but whose belief in the Revolution is no less great. You are the ASSR surrounding the workers, the common men and women who give the Revolution its body and spirit. That's why you're here, comrades. To protect the future and the generations not yet born, to be a shield to your friends and neighbors." Without another word, Ivanov saluted, turned on his heel, and departed."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.11.a: "Pride, not exhaustion, was their watchword."

 RUS.smuta.BRY.12.t: "Or Pride, and Fervor"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.12.desc: "The Whites hadn't stood a chance. Rolling over a corpse with her boot, Elvira stared in disgusted fascination. The tsarist officer was an old man, withered with age and half-starved. His old, ragged uniform clung to his skeletal frame, patched and faded. The other bodies were much the same, an army of old men sick with romanticism and young men grown up on lies.\n\nElvira's unit had captured the position easily, quickly routing the disorganized reactionary force. The tsar's soldiers, so proud to boast of their discipline and skill, had crumpled under the rapid and careful advance of the Sablinite squad. Her squad had gone from a ragged band of idealists into a well-oiled machine over the past few weeks, while these sorry men had likely sat on their laurels from wars long past.\n\nShe pitied them, she really did, these fallen Whites. Their tsar was long dead, and like in 1921, the Reds were coming to stamp the Whites out once again. They had looked at and smelled death all around them all day but never even dreamed of applying the term to themselves."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.12.a: "They hadn't come here to fear. They hadn't come to die. They had come to win."

 RUS.smuta.BRY.13.t: "A Rose to the Liberated"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.13.desc: "As she walked around in the center of a village she had just helped liberate, Elvira began taking stock of the situation around her. All things considered, this operation had gone remarkably well, not least because this particular settlement was rather friendly towards them. Soon, these patrols would no longer be necessary.\n\nBefore that, though, a young girl with her black hair in pigtails approached her. Elvira called out to the girl as she got close. "Child, what are you doing here?" She asked, puzzled. "It's not safe. Where are your parents?"\n\nThe young girl didn't answer her directly, responding instead with a rather blunt, puzzled, and innocent question: "Why are you carrying a gun?"\n\nThat caught Elvira off guard, and she had to stop for a moment before replying somewhat meekly. "Well, I'm a soldier. I'm here to keep the city safe."\n\nThe young girl wasn't impressed. "Yeah, but only boys can be soldiers. You're not a boy."\n\nElvira thought about how to respond, and resisted a chuckle before kneeling down to speak to the child face to face. "Not anymore. Anything the boys can do, we can do too!"\n\nIn the corner of her eye Elvira spotted what was the girl's harried mother, who seemed to be looking for her daughter and waved her over. The mother smiled as took her child's hand tightly, and thanked Elvira for taking care of her when she was lost. As mother and daughter left, Elvira couldn't help but smile too. Yes, some days were hard."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.13.a: "But there was no joy comparable to seeing the faces of the liberated, and it was all worth it."

 RUS.smuta.BRY.14.t: "In Your Heart Shall Burn"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.14.desc: "Training for new soldiers fell into a routine. They rose in the morning, assembled in formation - then training. Rifles were fired in unison, as officers drilled them consistently. Then, in the evening, after their bodies were drenched in sweat, and limbs exhausted, they sat, ate, and listened.\n\nElvira had only partially developed expectations of military service. She'd expected the training, and every day she was becoming better with her weapon - but she was learning more than just killing. The commissars had made this clear at the start, asking each of them to answer a very simple question: "What do we fight for?"\n\nThe soldiers gave various answers - but the commissars had an answer of their own; a stark reality that faced Russia were it to fall to the forces of reaction. They showed pictures. Shared stories. Mass graves of Russians dug by the Nazis, people enslaved under monarchists and their White loyalists. Destitute, and abused workers who toiled under the capitalist machines.\n\nElvira could only look at the images, hear the stories, and seethe, at the injustice of it all. The evil. Each night those images remained, and the stories lingering in her ear. So she remembered, and let it keep her heart aflame. When she aimed her rifle, she envisioned Nazis or Whites. When she felt her body failing, she reminded herself of the thousands who were awaiting liberation.\n\nFor these people, the Revolution was their only hope.\n\nThey lived with the consequences of failure, and knew the fates that awaited Russia if they failed. No, it was not enough to just be a soldier; for they fought against the forces of evil - evil which could only be matched with equally strong revolutionary fire. No half-measures would suffice. They would not be deterred. The Revolution would be carried out."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.14.a: "For failure would doom the Russian people forever."

 RUS.smuta.BRY.15.t: "In Glory, You Sacrifice"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.15.desc: "Gunfire sounded, as staccato exchanges between the Red Army and the remaining enemy soldiers defending the town continued. One Buryatian soldier fell, holding his shoulder, as a medic rushed towards him. Elvira clutched her weapon, braced it against the wall, and returned fire.\n\nShe wasn't sure how long they'd been fighting, let alone trapped in this standoff. Adrenaline still pumped through her veins, but it wasn't going to last forever. Despite having fewer soldiers on their side, they'd managed to stave off defeat - though their own casualties were mounting.\n\nSomething needed to be done to break the standoff. Their main fortification was a machine gun nest providing fire for the enemy. They couldn't advance as long as that was still up. Her officer was trying to hold the line - and after explaining her plan, he agreed.\n\nAs her comrades fired to get their attention, she moved quietly along the adjoining street. She knew she'd only get one shot at this. When she snuck close enough, she chucked a grenade towards the nest, exposing herself for a brief moment - which was all she needed.\n\nThe throw was perfect, and the resulting explosion took out the gun, and some nearby soldiers. The ones remaining were briefly stunned, which let her fire on one and kill him, and a few more fell to advancing Buryatians. However, she wasn't fast enough to stop one from turning his weapon towards her, and firing. She felt something tear through her leg, and a sharp flash cut past her face, turning half of her vision blurry.\n\nThe resulting pain almost made her collapse, but she gritted her teeth, by willpower forcing herself upright - firing one last time at the fleeing soldier, sending him crashing to the pavement. Then, she collapsed as well, as she heard the shouts of her comrades coming to her."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.15.a: "She let unconsciousness take her, knowing they had won."

 RUS.smuta.BRY.16.t: "For Russia, You Kill"
 RUS.smuta.BRY.16.desc: "With another battle over, the Red Army fanned out throughout the town, as additional reinforcements moved in. Another town liberated in their expansion. The lines of the enemy had been broken; scattering them to the hills, alleys, or buildings. It did not matter. They could be found, and dealt with.\n\nElvira marched forward, the markings on her uniform denoting her as newly promoted officer, and her left eye covered in a patch; a physical price extracted in pursuit of the Revolution, one that had left other scars.\n\nShe observed a few enemy soldiers being led at gunpoint to be lined up outside of the town, and executed. Several of her subordinates lined up, awaiting their orders. "House by house," she ordered them. "We don't let any of them escape."\n\nHer command was executed enthusiastically.\n\nFor hours they systematically searched the town. Occasional gunfire meant a discovery, which only lasted moments. Families were ordered out of their homes as the searches were conducted. Elvira felt she should feel something when she looked into their eyes - eyes filled with wariness and fear, not joy and hope. Most times liberation was met with enthusiasm - not this time, apparently. It didn't matter.\n\nAs she watched another enemy soldier be dragged out, she knew that wasn't their role to be the ones to convince the people of the necessity of the Revolution. That responsibility would fall to Comrade Sablin. Their mission was to fight, claim, and die for the Revolution.\n\nThat was what she would do. What all of them would do. It did not matter how many battles were fought, how much each of them had to sacrifice, or how much blood was spilled - all of Russia would one day fly the socialist banner."
 RUS.smuta.BRY.16.a: "And that banner she would carry, all the way to Moscow itself."
