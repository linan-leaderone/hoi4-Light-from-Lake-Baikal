 ### Leader Descriptions ###

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_YEGOROV_DESC: "Alexander Yegorov has been in the midst of the military throughout his entire adult life. Born in Samara in 1883, at age 18, he joined the Imperial Russian Army and quickly rose through the ranks. Originally a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party prior to the Revolution, he quickly aligned with the new Soviet regime when they came to power in 1917. He served courageously during the First World War, Russian Revolution in the Southwestern Front, the Great Patriotic War and the West Russian War, getting shot more than five times throughout his long service as he often led his men into battle. Ever humble, Yegorov always downplayed his achievements, and silently suffers with the regret of his past defeats even when he himself was not at fault. Still, Yegorov never gave up even after Moscow fell to the huns. In his exile behind the A-A line, he amassed the remaining red forces in West Russia underneath the banner of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, leading it to the cusp of victory during the West Russian War before the collaborators and reactionaries within the Front tore this away.\n\nNow nearly 80, his once more powerful grip over the Front's leadership is slipping away, with cliques of officers vying for power underneath him. The harsh climate of Arkhangelsk and his many war wounds have not helped improve his health, and the fractures within the Front continue to grow.\n\nDespite the Front's many defeats, Yegorov's resolve remained strong - at least to the outside observer. It needed to be, for the hopes and dreams of those Russians still loyal to the glorious Revolution lie on his shoulders. Only time will tell whether his successor - whoever they may be, can also hold this burden."

 POLITICS_GEORGY_ZHUKOV_DESC: "From the streets of Moscow to the banks of Khalkhin Gol, from the outskirts of Leningrad to the forests of West Russia, in every battleground he fought, Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov demonstrated himself as an exceptional leader and stood out as an example to respect and follow from his peers and subordinates alike. Serving the Motherland with dignity and honor since its foundation, Zhukov was among the cohort of Soviet generals who have not surrendered to the advance of the Hun or abandoned their oath to the Soviet Union, and became one of the leading generals of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the one which almost brought the Reich to its knees.\n\nEven though the Front lost the battle, it did not lose its sacred war against the Fascist horde. The Front will rise anew - but will it learn from its past failures? Marshal Zhukov adamantly believes in the Communist cause and deeply admires the sacrifices the Soviet people took to preserve their country, but at the same time, he often expressed his doubts in the efficiency of the Front organization and went as far as suggesting that the Soviet leadership moved too far away from the working people it claims to represent. Zhukov's too independent position caused some hardliner generals to question his trustworthiness and even his loyalty to the Front for a man of his responsibilities.\n\nThe rumors of his political unreliability have not walked past the ears of the Arkhangelsk leadership, but his authority among the Red Army and sympathies from the common people were too significant to even consider merely discarding him. Following several unfortunate confrontations between Zhukov and other generals, he was sent to oversee the extraction of oil in the region of Ukhta, where he could put skills to use while keeping himself busy to affect the politics of the Front. Should the Front face turmoil, however, the marshal won't let himself to be quiet..."

 POLITICS_GEORGY_ZHUKOV_70S_DESC: "Very few expected Russia to be reunited, and fewer still believed that it would be reunited under another Union of Soviets. And yet, despite all odds, Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov, the son of a Russian peasant cobbler, General of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and the heir apparent to Alexander Yegorov's clique, has done just that.\n\nZhukov rose through the ranks of the Soviet military, his career derailed by the invasion of Russia by the Reich. Joining the Western Revolutionary Front, a rump communist state, he was instrumental in the Western Russian War in the 50s, and while the war ended in loss for the WRRF, it broke Germany's hegemony. Falling out of favor, he was sent to the military district of Ukhta.\n\nBut with the German Civil War, his opportunities and fortunes alike expanded. Winning the power struggle against his opponent, Tukhachevsky, he quickly took advantage of the stop in terror bombings to reunite West Russia, and quickly extended this rule over the rest of Russia. His reforms have made the system more stable and prosperous, with the economy recovering from the destruction of the warlord period.\n\nRumors abound Zhukov, however. His health has deteriorated, with many of his underlings within the early days of the clique being labelled as possible successors. And then there is the matter of the border, which in recent months has seen massive amounts of build in materiel and soldiers near the Pakt.\n\nZhukov has refused to comment on this rumor."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_TUKHACHEVSKY_DESC: "Mikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky was always considered an eccentric, if talented, member of the Soviet High Command. A former noble, he turned against the conformity of his class and joined the Bolshevik party in their crusade against the old order. Victory after victory, every conquered city he dedicated to the cause of revolution and Vladimir Lenin paved the extraordinary career for the so-called 'Red Bonaparte', despite his young age.\n\nFollowing the Soviet defeat against the Nazi tide, Tukhachevsky was one of the generals who formed the basis of the WRRF leadership, but soon the self-willed Marshal grew to disdain his colleagues for their weakness and incompetence that led Russia to be defeated by Nazis in the first place. Being concerned with his influence on the Front politics, the Front leadership granted Tukhachevsky with a small domain in Plesetsk, where he could stay away from the intrigues of Arkhangelsk and organize the defensive frontier against the enemies from the West.\n\nA proponent of a revolutionary offensive war ever since his maturity as a Bolshevik military theorist, Tukhachevsky for a long time opposed the attempts of Bukharin to appease the enemies of the world proletariat, such as Germany and Japan, and tried to resist his ruinous reforms in the military complex, only for his voice to fall on deaf ears and his efforts to negated during the catastrophic course of the war with the Nazi Reich. Being a witness to the failed attempts of Bukharin's government to placate and defeat the bourgeois powers without a needed revolutionary vigor and determination, Marshal Tukhachevsky, a passionate warrior he is, only grew more convinced in his notion of the Red Army as the main instrument of a political change.\n\nIf the Soviet Union is bound to return under Tukhachevsky, it will return as an armed camp, eternally vigilant against its numerous enemies, with every cog inside its state machine rotated towards the final victory."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_TUKHACHEVSKY_70S_DESC: "After the miserable failure of Operation: Suvorov, many of Mikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky's colleagues in the West Russian Revolutionary Front had said that it was proof that his strange theories were more flawed than they appeared, and ignored his criticisms of the Red Army's conduct.\n\nWhen Marshal Tukhachevsky took power in the Front, his detractors claimed that his brutal adherence to war communism would lead the Socialist cause in Russia to ruin, and that the army's purpose is to serve the state, rather than become the harbinger of the global revolution.\n\nOnce the rejuvenated Red Army marched beyond the Ural Mountains, there were those who still held that even a brilliant strategist like Tukhachevsky could never tame the harsh wastes of Siberia.\n\nNow, however, they are silent. Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky has brought the Soviet Union together, and reforged it into a great engine to propel the Red Army forward as the most powerful military force in the history of man. The "Red Napoleon" now turns his attention to the West, preparing for the final conflict against the Union's ultimate foe. He shall see to it that the Red Army, invincible and legendary, will achieve the victory that they were denied so many years ago.\n\nNo matter what the cost may be."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_ALTUNIN_DESC: "Alexander Terentyevich Altunin was never the most proud or notable general of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. A specialist in civil defense and logistics, he performed his craft without complaint from the Great Patriotic War to the West Russian War, organizing air defense, industrial coordination, and, when the line simply couldn't hold any longer, ensuring that the columns of refugees fleeing eastward were protected from Luftwaffe pilots aiming to score easy kills.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Front, Altunin once more organized an orderly retreat, bringing the Fourth Army back to Arkhangelsk to await further instruction, serving as a bulwark against factionalism and conflict within the Front. While in Arkhangelsk, by Yegorov's side, Altunin spearheaded the first initiatives to oppose the German bombers, building bunkers, securing emergency food rations from Syktyvkar and Yugra, and working out mutually beneficial deals with the Free Aviators. While Tukhachevsky is the shield and sword of the front, and Zhukov is its fiery, industrial backbone, Altunin is its steady, strong, and quiet heart.\n\nThis attitude of quiet competence and his more apolitical and pragmatic nature has drawn Yegorov's attention to Altunin, who he views as the 'safest' and most orderly leader of the Front. Altunin may not be a legendary hero or firebrand revolutionary, but he is a true believer, and one of the few men that the ailing Great Marshal has nothing but complete trust and confidence in."

Suffering multiple wounds in early battles, he was reassigned to the Volga Military District to serve as a company training officer in 1942, joined the Communist Party in 1943, and received the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1944. Despite his excellent service to his country, however, he could not prevent the defeat of the Soviet Union in the war and the resulting collapse. Nevertheless, he was sent by the Front to one of the few general staff academies still in operation, and got his first taste of strategic command during Operation Suvorov.

Conscripted into the Red Army in November 1941, he served as commander of a rifle platoon, fighting in battles around Leningrad. Although he was a great admirer of Bolshevism at the time, seeing it as the only hope against the fascists of the world, his experiences in the aftermath of the war changed him. Becoming a member of the Communist Party in 1944, he chose to leave the army with the collapse of the Soviet Union, demoralized by the outcome of the war.\n\nFinding himself in the lands of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he eventually came to learn of the deal made by the Front with the gulags of Vorkuta to send them prisoners in exchange for coal. Infuriated by this arrangement and no longer able to truly believe in Bolshevism, Yakovlev joined the government of the Front, determined to change it from within.\n\nAfter Operation Suvorov failed, Zhukov convinced the capable Yakovlev to join him in Ukhta, where he now hopes to convince Zhukov in turn and bring down war communism and Bolshevism both through him, and in turn create a democratic system of governance for Russia.§!"

Before he could begin his formal studies however, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused him to flee east towards the Front, where he studied engineering at one of the few colleges still available. Finishing his studies just after the failure of Operation Suvorov and the near collapse of the Front, he again fled towards what remained of it, eventually finding himself in Ukhta, where he distinguished himself quickly and caught Zhukov's attention.\n\nAs such, he was put in charge of the economic and industrial organization of Ukhta despite his young age, proving to be instrumental in the success of that project.

His mother divorced his father in 1928 and took her children to Moscow. As he grew up, Akhromeyev decided to enter military service, and in 1940 graduated from the 1st Special Naval School in Moscow. After next completing a course at the Frunze Higher Naval School, he fought as part of a cadet rifle battalion on the Leningrad Front, where he was wounded. In 1942 he enrolled in the 2nd Astrakhan Infantry School and graduated the same year, being made commander of a rifle platoon of the 197th Army Reserve Regiment of the 28th Army, and continued to rise through the ranks of the regiment. By 1944 he found himself commander of a motorized battalion, but by then the war was lost.\n\nTo Akhromeyev, however, and to many others, it never truly ended.

Being from a large peasant family, he worked from a young age, leaving school and his family home for St Petersburg at age 12 to find better employment. During the Russian Civil War, Chuikov became unemployed due to the turmoil, and as a result he and all his brothers enlisted in the Red Army. When the civil war neared its end in 1921, he left his regiment to study at the Frunze Military Academy, where he studied Chinese, before in 1926 joining a Soviet delegation touring northern China, after which he was assigned as a military attaché to China and traveled further. Returning to the Soviet Union in 1929, he would continue his ascension through the ranks of the Red Army. In December of 1940, he was sent as the Soviet military representative to the Republic of China and advisor to Chiang Kai-shek to aid in the war against Japan, but was recalled to the Soviet Union in 1942 due to the outbreak of war with Germany. Holding key commands in some of the bloodiest battles of the war, he became known for the tenacity of himself and his men, as well as for his skill with urban and close quarters tactics, employed to deadly effect against the Germans, even as the war itself was lost.

 WRS.0.d: "Today, Grand Marshal Marshal Alexander Ilyich Yegorov, the leader of the West Russian Revolutionary Front and former People's Commissar for Defense under Bukharin has passed away due to old age. For the past few decades he has continued the desperate conflict against the Third Reich. In the last years of his life, Yegorov has worked desperately, in spite of the German Terror Bombings, to turn the West Russian Revolutionary Front into an actual state which represents the Russian People - trying to balance the wills of Georgy Zhukov and Mikhail Tukhachevsky and keep them cooperating.\n\nThe favored successor seems to be either Marshal Georgy Zhukov, or his main rival, Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, as they are certainly the most popular generals among the remnants of the Red Army that remained loyal to Yegorov. These two generals have amassed many followers of their own, and have, until now, only really worked with each other because of Yegorov. Both have been working behind the scenes, attempting to gain influence with the Front's Stavka, attempting to persuade it to march forward in their point of view. Many believe the Stavka have already selected a preferred candidate already, and are preparing to declare him the next leader of the Front, their view being proven right when the heir to Yegorov was declared to be..."

 WRS_initial_enduring_desc: "The West Russian Revolutionary Front nowadays could seem as yet another irrelevant and unknown warlord state in Russia, perhaps owning slightly more territory than one would expect. However, anyone with a good knowledge of recent history knows of the glory days of the Front, when it stretched from Arkhangelsk to Orsk, and was the torch bearer of Russian liberty and socialism. Any dreams of liberation were crushed, though, with the West Russian War and the destruction it brought onto us.\n\nWe have been isolated in a corner of the former Union, stuck in the frozen north and based in Arkhangelsk. Despite the "defeat" in the 1950s, the WRRF lives on. Now, we must seek to assess our situation, find every detail on our resources and capabilities and how we can make the most out of it."
 WRS_the_agriculture_situation_desc: "The soldiers of the West Russian Revolutionary Front are steadfast, her workers industrious and her leaders bold and dedicated. However, these mean nothing if there is no food in their stomachs. Although large amounts of food supplies were brought from more southerly regions at the formation of the Front, they are beginning to run out. Most of the land that we control is barren and unsuitable for agriculture, and although we have begun attempts to trade with other warlord states, the bombing campaigns of the Luftwaffe have frustrated any meaningful attempts to import food from elsewhere. If something isn't done, the entire country will starve.\n\nA council must be called to assess the agricultural situation in the Front and new, drastic plans must be drawn for the sake of our survival. Whatever arable land we hold must be devoted to agriculture, new trade deals must be made, and rations must be stretched tight if we are to eat even a single meal in the coming days."
 WRS_ration_calculations_desc: "After the end of the West Russian War and the subsequent rebellions of the reactionaries and traitors in the south, the Front now maintains power only over the White Sea coast and environs. While we have endured these difficult years, life in the North is not without its drawbacks: the land here, though vast and seems almost limitless, is cold, and the soil not arable. Through rationing, the food so far has lasted, but for how long, no one knows.\n\nTo alleviate the pressure on our food stocks, we must change the rationing system, reforming it to be more egalitarian and scientific. Our officers will calculate the rations based on calories, giving every loyal soldier of the Front their minimum to survive for the day. Though this is a hard and undeserved burden, socialism expects all of us to share our joys and hardships."
 WRS_examine_the_stockpiles_desc: "When the Front retreated into Arkhangelsk following the end of the West Russian War, it hurriedly secured its most vital equipment into a number of vast warehouses. Having no use for these tools, the officers did not open them, as their maintenance would only impose an undue burden on an overstretched Front. However, high command now wonders whether or not these stockpiles may have held canned food and other useful rations in addition to equipment.\n\nWe will send our soldiers accompanied by commissars into these warehouses, tasking them with finding supplies for the Front. If they find these supplies, they would then transport them into our storehouses and distribute them to the men equally. Though not magical tablecloths that can summon feasts from nowhere, any scraps that we can find will help the Front. Even after it is dead and long gone, the old Union still finds a way to feed its children."
 WRS_new_supply_chains_desc: "The recalculation of rations and the discovery of long-thought lost supplies have helped the Front survive for at least a few months more. However, they can only achieve so much. The problem remains: scavenged rations and farms in frigid wasteland can only feed so many people for so long. Hence, we must find and secure supply chains as soon as possible. The Front's survival depends on it.\n\nWe will begin the tentative steps to trade food for the Front. We will send our officers and commissars to our neighbors, establishing diplomatic contact and allowing even a trickle of food to flow into Arkhangelsk. To some in the high command, this compromise is unacceptable, as we are negotiating with the illegitimate claimants to the Union's territory. However, such ideological concerns carry no weight, as survival is paramount."
 WRS_contacts_in_vologda_desc: "The State of Vologda, founded on the betrayal of General Ivanov to advance into German territory, is a 'free state': a neutral zone for all Russians. Hearing the name Vologda or Ivanov spoken would lead some of our more motivated comrades to scoff in disgust. In such dire straits, however, all are willing to work with traitors to ensure that the lone beacon of socialism in West Russia survives to shine its light upon humanity.\n\nWe will forge closer economic bonds with Vologda, trading our industrial goods for food, as our diplomatic officers lobby for greater cooperation between it and the Front. The porous border into the hated Reichskommissariat will also provide an additional way for food to flow. In better times, the Front would not have stooped to cooperate with traitors and its enemies, but such concerns would have to be set aside for now. Our time will come."
 WRS_contacts_in_komi_desc: "To the south of Plesetsk, past the domain of Tukhachevsky, lies the Komi Republic. Splintering off acrimoniously with the Front during the West Russian War, it became independent, establishing itself as a multi-party parliamentary democracy. Though traitors all the same, especially its leadership, the people of Komi are not enemies. Many remain sympathetic to the ideals of the old Union, a fact that unites us more than any other. Cooperation is the natural state between it and the Front.\n\nWe will extend the diplomatic arm of the Front to Komi, building rapport with the various parties in its legislature. Considering our close bonds in thought, we do not expect it to take long. After all, the people of Komi once were our comrades, and many still look to us in hopes of an eventual alliance. It may come yet, but for now, we need our food more than anything else."
 WRS_the_eastern_pipeline_desc: "To the east of the Front's de facto territory lies Vorkuta, another illegitimate claimant to the Union's soil. A place where political prisoners were sent to before the Great Patriotic War, it is not the name that comes up when a Russian speaks of "food." However, to the south of Vorkuta lies the merchant-state of Zlatoust, where the right price can buy anything one desires. Though cooperation with capitalism is an anathema to any socialist, we have to make do in these desperate times.\n\nWe will send our commissars and officers into Vorkuta to secure safe passage and the labor of the prisoners to carry the food back to Arkhangelsk. Once at Zlatoust itself, we shall haggle for the lowest price possible, and ensure a long-lasting deal with the capitalist pigs. They have something we want; they want something we have. This cooperation is temporary, till the time the Union rises again over Russia."
 WRS_distribution_networks_desc: "Northern Russia, where the Front currently resides, is a vast land. Due to its relative unimportance and lack of any dense population centers, it was not a priority of the old administration to build infrastructure on it. Whatever railways and public use roads that existed in this period were torn apart by the German bombers during their bombing campaign. With the shipments of food coming in, many among the officer corps worry about it arriving spoiled and unusable.\n\nThe supply of food is secure. Now something else must be done. To ensure the speedy arrival of it, we will dispatch our soldiers to rebuild the roads and railways, as well as protecting the distribution network from bandits. In doing this, we will ensure that no man that fights under the banner of socialism shall go starving ever again, for socialists look after their own."
 WRS_food_security_desc: "For the first time since the West Russian War, the Front has procured itself a steady stream of food for its soldiers and workers in its territory. With a clear supply line, recalculated and regulated consumption of rations, and infrastructure capable of distributing it, the Front has avoided the constant, looming threat of famine. Our soldiers now rest easy at night, knowing that meals are not hard to come by, provided that they work for their share.\n\nTo capitalize on this success, and to improve morale further, we will review the regulated caloric intake previously set before the established trade routes. We will increase this, giving our soldiers more to eat in a day than they have for months or even years. For labor under socialism maybe its reward, but the world will know that no soldier of the Front goes hungry or wanting."
 WRS_the_army_situation_desc: "It has been almost a decade since the West Russian War came to a finish, and we became isolated in this corner of West Russia. However, we must not be pessimistic, even if the situation is dire. For that reason, we must do everything we can to use what little resources and power we have to our advantage. Of course, the key to surviving and thriving in Russia is to possess military power. We will need to ensure that the proud army of the West Russian Revolutionary Front is in shape, and capable of doing what is needed to protect our lands, or even expand further. The process must be rigorous, as this is one of the most serious issues we are tackling, and we will have to allocate more of our resources, but our generals believe it is fully within our capabilities."
 WRS_further_anti_air_investments_desc: "Ever since the last war, we have become targets for the German bombers who consider us merely an area to train their pilots. However, we must show them that it is not that simple. Using a combination of designs from back in the days of the Union, as well as from our foreign benefactors, our limited industry could increase its production of anti-air equipment. Using it, we could target the Luftwaffe aircraft that attack daily, making the lives of civilians hell, and harass them. Perhaps the Germans will realize that there is not simply nothingness across the Russian frontier."
 WRS_cycle_troop_levies_desc: "Unfortunately, the unity of the Red Army is challenged by the fierce rivalry of the Front's two best commanders, Georgy Zhukov and Mikhail Tukhachevsky, that both maintain their own fiefdoms on the edge of the territories still held by us. However, the real leader of the front, Marshal Yegorov, has devised an ingenious plan to prevent more army officers from being recruited on one side or the other. Every now and then, those deemed worthy of becoming officers are sent to Ukhta or Plesetsk for training under either general. At the same time, we recall those sent before that are now trained to become real officers for the WRRF's cause. This way, we can prevent our officers from falling on either side of the rivalry dividing the Army. Thus, it is time to inform the two generals that this is happening, as this is a routine practice."
 WRS_foreign_manpad_training_desc: "When the WRRF fought for Russian liberty in the 1950s, we found an ally across the Arctic in America. Their intelligence service managed to ship important equipment to help us in our cause against their sworn enemies. One of these weapons that were brought in were MANPADS, anti-air defense systems that were portable, and could be carried and fired by a person. As a relatively new technology, they proved surprisingly effective in shooting down enemy aircraft, and now we will train our new recruits in the Red Army to learn how to use them. When that succeeds, our anti-air defenses will be better than they ever were."
 WRS_expand_bunker_complexes_desc: "The West Russian Revolutionary Front already operates a small number of bunker complexes and fortifications in the frontier areas. However, it is no secret that at their current situation, they are not that formidable, and would not dissuade the enemy from attacking our lines. Perhaps the time has come to fix this. Being relatively cheap for our budget and effective in their goal, they are a good solution to improve our defensive capabilities against other warlord states. Making sure that they are adequate and modernized is highly important in such a hostile environment."
 WRS_test_their_mettle_desc: "As much as we improve our army and do our own exercises, there is no better way to test our army than in an actual, real fight. In an environment of warlordism and chaos, one can make a limited attack on his neighbor without many repercussions. Thus, we will make our strike on the treacherous fiefdom of Kirpichnikov in the west. Opposed to our glorious socialism, they are nothing more than a facade for the Finns to protect themselves and move all the Karelian Russians there. Of course, right now we are not capable of pursuing a full war against them, this will be a good way to both test our forces and perhaps scare the Finnish puppets."
 WRS_learn_from_our_mistakes_desc: "Now that our tense clash with Kirpichnikov's "Anti-Communist Guard" near Onega has ended, we need to assess its outcome and see what we can learn from it. After all, this was merely a military exercise for the purpose of learning lessons on the battlefield, as well as test our new tactics and equipment. Therefore, our generals observing the battle, as well as some officers higher up in the hierarchy that were present in the battles, will have to provide commentary on what the Red Army did correctly, and what it can improve, or even has to completely change. The process of forming a large yet effective army is difficult, but this is a good first step."
 WRS_the_districts_situation_desc: "When the West Russian War ended, it became apparent to the high command that of all the Union generals that did not turn traitor during it, Zhukov and Tukhachevsky were heads and shoulders above everyone else. These men became the pillars of the Front during its retreat into Arkhangelsk, saving the bulk of the old army. In the years following, during the German bombing campaign, Yegorov, tired of political infighting, sent Zhukov to Ukhta and Tukhachevsky into Plesetsk.\n\nIt is an imperfect solution, in hindsight. Though far from the center of political power in Arkhangelsk, both of them had become entrenched in their fiefdoms, raising autonomous armies with divergent doctrines to Yegorov's own. If the Front is to move forward as one, we need to reconcile these men with one another, as well as with the Front. For socialism demands of all workers unity, not division by petty differences."
 WRS_investments_in_plesetsk_desc: "The Great Marshal Tukhachevsky leads his fiefdom of Plesetsk, defending the front's borders from raiders and reactionaries alike. Tukhachevsky is one of the truest and most loyal followers of the front's ideals; it is time he deserves repayment for all the victories he has brought us.\n\nInvestitures must be made in Plesetsk to reward him, and soon, even Arkhangelsk will see a return. New roads, railways, and urban development will be set in place for the growth of the small town into a large factory city fit to produce the finest weapons in Russia."
 WRS_provide_additional_officers_desc: "The aid Tukhachevsky had lent us is proving useful. The application of war communism within the Front itself has manifested itself in the number of rifles currently in use by the Front's army. Soon, no soldier of the Front shall find himself without a reliable weapon. In solving this problem, we stumble into another: despite the abundance of guns, our soldiers do not have the proper training or officership to make use of it.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we will need to rely on Comrade Tukhachevsky again. We will send him our officers for him to train in the ways of war communism, while his officers will come into the halls of Arkhangelsk, to instruct our soldiers up to his standard. With the help of Marshal Tukhachevsky, the Front will again march forward, and socialism shall soon spread itself into the rest of the world."
 WRS_investments_in_ukhta_desc: "To the south-east of the Arkhangelsk, Marshal Zhukov rules his domain of Ukhta. Despite his old age and experience, Zhukov has never abandoned his belief in an ideal Soviet system, perceiving in the former Union the foundations for his ideological beliefs. To him, war is but an end. Soldiers are workers organized to fight and defend the revolution. In Ukhta, the factories toil, but not for war, but to provide the necessities for the people there.\n\nIf we choose to invest in Zhukov's vision, we will have him send his officers and representatives to plan and coordinate our economic activity. When the time comes, this investment will repay the Front in more than just guns, but the contentment and even happiness of the workers. Approving of this measure would mean that we accept Zhukov's influence within Arkhangelsk, but we did not doubt him in the war, and we shall not doubt him now."
 WRS_move_industry_eastward_desc: "The industry that serves as the backbone of our military has for years remained far more vulnerable than it needs to be. Many factories sit right on the border, easy targets for raids by both air and land. Inspired by an obscure proposal made during the Second World War, one of our logisticians has suggested that we make a concentrated to move as much heavy industry as possible to Ukhta, where it will be far less enticing target for German bombers and practically untouchable by land assault.\n\nSuch an effort will take at least a month, and a great deal of organizational skill, but as always the Red Army is up to the task. Once our factories and their workers have been moved to safety, we will quickly begin reaping the benefits from the increased output that is sure to result."
 WRS_side_with_tukhachevsky_desc: "Deep battle may not have brought us total victory in the West Russian War, but it was through its employment that we nearly broke the Wehrmacht. It is the doctrine that many of our commanders are already familiar with, and they will be quick to learn any adjustments that we make.\n\nIn particular, the relatively new concept of an infantry fighting vehicle is of great interest to our forces. APCs with the firepower to stand on its own will make excellent companions to our tanks as they flood through the gaps made by shock units into the enemy's rear, wreaking havoc behind their lines. The technology finally exists to perfect the strategies that Marshal Tukhachevsky first devised so many decades ago, and it would be foolish to abandon them now."
 WRS_side_with_altunin_desc: "Critics of Altunin say that he is not a brilliant strategist like Tukhachevsky, or a charismatic leader of men like Zhukov. However, what truly sets Altunin apart from his rivals is his tireless dedication to his work and his mastery at logistical organization.\n\nMore than anyone else, Altunin was responsible for the birth of the West Russian Revolutionary Front: it was he who made sure the refugees were protected from warplanes, that the stores of food arrived in the cities, and that each soldier had bullets to stop the fascist advance.\n\nIn these uncertain days, what the West Russian Revolutionary Front needs is a man who can be trusted on to run the country. A man like Altunin."
 WRS_side_with_zhukov_desc: "For years, Zhukov honed the art of guerrilla warfare in raids against the fascist occupiers of Moscow, launching numerous attacks into the heart of the enemy territory. He is highly experienced in leading troops into battle, and can turn the tides of war around with his tactical and strategic brilliance. In addition, Zhukov has also been head of Ukhta and its industrial centres for an extended period of time, giving him the expertise needed to run an economy that can sustain the Red Army's war machine and drive the fascist invaders from our lands.\n\nWith his knowledge of guerrilla tactics that can outsmart the fascists, and his experience running industrial operations, Zhukov is an ideal candidate to command the West Russian Revolutionary Front's forces in the wars to come.\n\nIf you want the job done properly, call Zhukov."
 WRS_forward_unto_dawn_desc: "For the first time in years, dawn shines over Russia, and the skies are quiet, silent: no more alarms, no more bombs. The planes that strafe over the shattered remnants of the old Union, in vain hope that they can defeat the united will of a people determined to survive, have not come for a few weeks. Germany requires them for a purpose only comprehensible to the minds of the Nazis. Whatever their intentions are, they are making a terrible mistake: the Front shall shudder awake again, and the revolution will proceed once more.\n\nThe Front shall establish and reaffirm its authority over the wastes that surround Arkhangelsk. We will pick up the pieces shattered by the German bombing, and the Front shall reforge itself. The Germans have given us an opportunity that we cannot afford to pass. Socialism shall rule Russia again, and when that is accomplished, we shall dye the world in red dawn."

 ###NEW INITIAL TREE DESC###
 WRS_the_failures_of_barbarossa_desc: "The old days of Chairman Bukharin's regime saw the nation of the Russian people under a greater and more equal state broken under the powers of the German War Machine to the West, as the powers of Adolf Hitler and his circus of Fascist pigs continued to slaughter our people and burn our lands during the accursed Operation Barbarossa. The General Secretary allowed the Union to become underequipped, undefended, and unprepared when the Nazis took hold of the German nation, and all of our great motherland came to suffer the consequences in the butcheries that followed. A Soviet Union had been born, and after a World War most terrible, we are what remains of a united Soviet Russia, ready to face the barrel of the Nazi rifle under the greater Marshal Alexander Yegorov."
 WRS_the_failures_of_suvurov_desc: "The chronicles of history have taken account of the suffering of all Russia's people, its ink the blood of those who died to overthrow the Tsardom and those who fought and killed and died to repulse the Nazi horde. However, Barbarossa was not the end of our bloodshed; no, for in the land of Suvorov was where our men fought bravely once more to reclaim our rightful lands, with Marshal Yegorov nearly retaking our old capitals. However, all good things must come to an end, as we fell once more on the brink of success during the 1950's as Adolf Hitler sent his hordes against our Winter Line. Success was in our grasp, and yet we still fell. We broke. We retreated. We failed Russia. Yet the West Russian Revolutionary Front has swallowed its failure, and we shall march on, wiser and more experienced."
 WRS_pertient_matters_desc: "Although all men, women, and children understand the suffering we have gone through, and the necessity for all Russian peoples to unite to once again claim the glory of a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Nazis are not the only obstacle in the way. Marshal Yegorov has excellently led a band of military officers to establish a rule over the Front and maintain safety and security for our people; however, the man ages further with every year, and our Front has continued to break down into separate Factions with differing ideas on how to lead. The Marshal of Victory, Georgy Zhukov, continues to lead a liberalizing faction desiring devotion to the Communist cause and promises to refrom governmental inefficiency; meanwhile, the Red Bonaparte, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, ardently rallies for the militarization of the front, calling to abandon Bukharin's failing ideas and use the Red Army as a force for socialist change. Nevertheless, the front continues to march on, unsure of the future in these dangerous times..."
 WRS_the_red_bonaparte_desc: "The Red Bonaparte, the Marshal of the Soviet Union, the Military seat of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and one of its prime contenders for succession. Mikhail Tukhachevsky is known as all of these things, and has become one of the most prominent figures marching for leadership across the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Having served the Tsar during the time of the Russian Empire, he only met his first true command during the invasion of the Poles, where he found dual success while creating new and revolutionary new theories on military operations. His praise was short-lived, as despite all of his glorious successes, Chairman Bukharin still led all of our Soviet Union to absolute destruction. Here we are now, as Mikhail Tukhachevsky continues to prop up the notion of forming the Front into an invasion force, allying himself with a clique of Red Army generals, including the esteemed Dmitry Ustinov, ready to find glory through the reclamation of the Russian lands by way of the Red Army itself."
 WRS_uphold_the_system_desc: "During the early days of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the great founders of our socialist state found itself in need of guaranteed emergency powers through the might of the Russian Red Army. Russia came under the power of this state of "War Communism," where all industries went under the process of immediate nationalization, all sources of food became managed by the military state in order to avoid a famine breaking the state, and all men, women, and children undergoing a strict discipline in their mandatory work to produce for the militarized Soviet state. Through this period of emergency, we found ourselves united and ready to face off against our rivals throughout the world. While we may have broken eventually, the system lays living, ready to be used to secure our place in the desolate wastelands of a broken Russia. Encouraging the strength of the Red Army to maintain control and governance over the Front will allow us to secure control over everything we need, and guarantee for our citizens a life of greatness through a life of dedicated socialism."
 WRS_prodrazvyrostka_desc: "Food. Food fills the stomachs of our men, women, and children. Food is one of the greatest physical needs of the human body. Food is one of the foundations for social organization and civilization, as men came together in times long past to find new ways to produce greater amounts of food, and share amongst one another as civilization continued to grow further, and stronger. We must guarantee the Front's access to food for all, so that we may all find the necessities we need to survive despite the desperate situation our people have found themselves in. However, against the pillars of socialism, some individuals find themselves wracked with greed by hoarding grain, our foundation for the basics of food, for their own profit. Thus, we shall instate a state of Prodrazvyorstka; or, the confiscation of public access supplies of grain in order to bolster state food supplies. Doing so will allow the Front's government to provide for its needy citizens, rather than allowing them to slave themselves over to privatized farmland to stave off starvation. Everyone in the Front must work together so that we may bring about a new age of prosperity for all, rather than suffer the dreadful fate of stagnation, starvation, and death."
 WRS_the_army_of_the_international_proletariat_desc: "The corrupt Führer of Germany has extended the monstrous tendrils of fascism throughout the world we struggle through, as their atrocities remain both innumerable and intolerable. Across Europe and beyond, across the Seven Seas and countless nations across the world, the fascists have crushed the lower classes of the world, forcing the proletariat across the word into a state of slavery, oppression, and virtual destruction as they stare down the "Master Race" who so greatly affronts every one of them. The Soviet Union held the promises of being able to provide for a worldwide protector for the communist cause, a vanguard if one would, one who could protect against such terrors incited by the fascist dictators across the world. We must recover our nature as the socialist shield of the world through the might of the Red Army, and provide a spark of hope for all would-be socialists desiring for freedom and equality against the oppression of the fascist jackboot."
 WRS_deep_battle_theory_desc: "After the dark days of the Civil War, the Red Army found itself victorious upon the battlefield across the lands it fought so bravely across, from the taiga to the Baltic Sea. It was then that a certain late Vladimir Triandafillov and our very own Mikhail Tukhachevsky crafted the development of a new doctrine to organize the broken apart Soviet forces, and find a new way to bring about victory past the strength of our enemies: Deep Battle Theory. The complete and thorough organization and thought behind every level of combat, from the individual tactics of the small army regiment to the complete operations spanning across continents, with several plans assigned to every front of the war in order to guarantee complete and overwhelming success. While we suffered greatly in the wake of the Second World War through our defeat, we mustn't abandon our truly successful theories and machinations of war. Thus, we shall continue to organize our forces in order to guarantee the greatest level of success possible in these trying times through our tried and true methods."
 WRS_shift_the_blame_desc: "We shall never deny the fact that the West Russian War continues to be one of the greatest disappointments the Russian people must bear to endure as a brand of defeat. However, we are also dually allowed to recognize the truth in acknowledging how we lost such a war when the Nazis were so greatly close to collapse: that truth being the name of Mikhail Suslov, Party Inspector and former leader of purges under the misguided Lazar Kaganovich. Applying the conflict as a means of vying for power in a terrible sin of ambitious betrayal, Suslov's manipulation of party balance caused a great general collapse for us, according to the word of Mikhail Tukhachevsky. Recognizing this great betrayal will be a great step in handling the matter, and bringing the inspector to justice before the West Russian Revolutionary Front."
 WRS_steady_as_she_goes_desc: "Marshal Georgy Zhukov may have served the Soviet Union well and brought it prosperity, even managing to lead several regiments to victory against the despicable German invaders during the 1950's invasions throughout the West Russian War. However, it ought to be acknowledged that the man dons a broken spirit of a strong state, instead allowing himself to be caught in a state of comradery with liberalized reformers who seek to guarantee a sense of "freedom" and "equality" over the very survival of our Front. We, as the true successors to the Soviet Union and greatest chance for a new Russian nation, must work to depose the power Zhukov holds if we seek to remain a powerful contender for Western Russian power in the face of countless rivals alongside peering German hordes, ready to launch another war at any moment. His name shan't be sullied; however, we cannot allow it to flourish in political spheres either."
 WRS_ready_for_war_desc: "A great darkness looms over Russian lands, a darkness spreading an oppressive and enveloping fog of frigid destruction and mayhem, one which seeks to strangle the life out of any sense of Russian unity, establishing it as a worldwide empire while destroying us all. This darkness storms over the skies of Russia, as it rains hellfire down and consumes all waking senses of potential unity and organization among the Russian people. This darkness, wielding the Swastika and the German Eagle upon its banner, however, remains as internally chaotic as the very chaos it sows throughout every land it washes over, as pretenders throughout the land seek to claim all lands the darkness holds for themselves. In the impending implosion which will finally wash away this darkness, we shall continue to prepare for the final exodus of this oppressive storm, and ready ourselves for war. One day, the Reich will crumble, and the bombings will cease over Russian lands. And on that day, the Führer will finally realize how greatly the West Russian Revolutionary Front is ready for war."
 WRS_ready_for_victory_desc: "While some in Russia harbor for a sense of revenge against the Germans primarily, and seek to let loose the hounds of war against Nazi Empire that sits bloatedly to the West, we have realized that it will take more than the fire of revenge to guarantee ourselves success in the future. It will take unity, it will take strength, it will take numbers, and it will take cooperation. While we can handle most of everything through the might of our army, cooperation is an entirely new beast, one which will require the abdication of several Warlords, lest they seek to give their life for their dividing state. We shall call upon the days of the West Russian War, when the West Russian Revolutionary Front dominated the lands of Western Russia, and once more we shall unite into a greater, more powerful Russian state, preparing itself for total unity of the Russian people and a strike back against the Nazi menace."
 WRS_a_heroic_forty_six_years_desc: "Forty-six years ago, the spirit of Revolution was born within the soul of the Russian nation. Nevermore would we tolerate the oppression of capitalistic and authoritarian exploitation under the perfidious Tsar. Nevermore would the proletariat sit idly by as the bourgeoisie continued to tear them apart, exploit them, and treat them as slaves. Several key figures made the Revolution possible, from Vladimir Lenin to Nikolai Bukharin, and many other smaller figures ready to call upon the torch of the communist cause in response. We are the holders of this great flame of revolution, the bearers of the communist soul, the ones who are most ready and most prepared to see the Marxist agenda continue to live on in this fascist-dominated world. And we shall continue the Revolution, we shall fight for our lives and fight for the greater sense of change and socialism in this world. Our spirit may be battered, but may we never be broken!"
 WRS_on_the_clock_desc: "It has become clear, from our studies and analysis of Front stockpiles, that our food stocks are in a fairly desperate situation. These shortages are not unsolvable, but dealing with them will require difficult sacrifices and unpopular choices. Still, this would not be the first time that such deprivation has turned its gaze in our direction. The Front will endure, and the Front will survive. And, for the good of the Front, we need to make these choices as soon as possible."
 WRS_necessary_sacrifices_desc: "The army of the WRRF is the primary force that keeps us safe and afloat. As such, it must take priority when considering the allocation of food supplies. Our logistics officers will prioritize food shipments to the army, and anti-aircraft guns will be tasked with defending food stockpiles around our territories. Until we can achieve reliable food supplies for all our people, it is vital that our soldiers not starve in the streets."
 WRS_pragmatic_diplomacy_desc: "As a wise German once said, 'First comes a full stomach, then comes ethics.' The land that we currently control does not produce enough food to feed all of our people, let alone fuel the struggle against the Nazis. As such, it is imperative that we look for alternate sources. While the many other warlords and statelets of broken Russia might not be supportive of our ideological outlook, they'll certainly be willing to trade for food. Let's put aside amorphous ideals for the moment, and make sure that our people have enough food to live on."
 WRS_the_traitor_general_desc: "The State of Vologda, founded on the betrayal of General Ivanov to advance into German territory, is a 'free state': a neutral zone for all Russians. Hearing the name Vologda or Ivanov spoken would lead some of our more motivated comrades to scoff in disgust. In such dire straits, however, all are willing to work with traitors to ensure that the lone beacon of socialism in West Russia survives to shine its light upon humanity.\n\nWe will forge closer economic bonds with Vologda, trading our industrial goods for food, as our diplomatic officers lobby for greater cooperation between it and the Front. The porous border into the hated Reichskommissariat will also provide an additional way for food to flow. In better times, the Front would not have stooped to cooperate with traitors and its enemies, but such concerns would have to be set aside for now. Our time will come."
 WRS_across_the_urals_desc: "Across Russia, the fiefdom of Zlatoust is well-known for its extensive arms trade. However, that amoral hellhole is also home to a number of other industries, including food production, processing, and packing. While it may not please many within our ranks, they will be happy to sell us some of that food. Transporting the goods might be a bit difficult, but the war dogs of Zlatoust are known for their reliability. This source will likely be the solution to our current food crisis."
 WRS_the_fractured_republic_desc: "To the south of Plesetsk, past the domain of Tukhachevsky, lies the Komi Republic. Splintering off acrimoniously with the Front during the West Russian War, it became independent, establishing itself as a multi-party parliamentary democracy. Though traitors all the same, especially its leadership, the people of Komi are not enemies. Many remain sympathetic to the ideals of the old Union, a fact that unites us more than any other. Cooperation is the natural state between it and the Front.\n\nWe will deploy the diplomatic arm of the Front into Komi, building rapport with the various parties in its legislature. Considering our close bonds in thought, we expect it not to take too long. After all, the people of Komi once were our comrades, and many still look to us in hopes of an eventual alliance. It may come yet, but for now, we need our food more than anything else."
 WRS_the_peoples_marshal_desc: "Georgy Zhukov oversees the industries of Ukhta, but he is much, much more than that. Over the decades, Marshal Zhukov has become one of the most highly respected officers in the WRRF, having fought for the Soviet Union since its bloody birth. His skills have become the stuff of legend, from the dark days of Barbarossa to the desperate triumphs of Suvorov, and the rumors of his reformist thinking are well-known. He has surrounded himself with officers and officials, who run the gamut, from anti-Tukhachevsky militarists to outright social democrats. It's clear that Marshal Zhukov will have an important role to play in the struggles to come, and his efforts could radically reshape the WRRF as a force."
 WRS_relocate_industry_eastwards_desc: "The industry that serves as the backbone of our military has, for years, remained far more vulnerable than it needs to be. Many factories sit right on the border, easy targets for raids by both air and land. Inspired by an obscure proposal made during the Second World War, one of our logisticians has suggested that we make a concentrated to move as much heavy industry as possible to Ukhta, where it will be far less enticing target for German bombers and practically untouchable by land assault.\n\nSuch an effort will take at least a month, and a great deal of organizational skill, but as always the Red Army is up to the task. Once our factories and their workers have been moved to safety, we will quickly begin reaping the benefits from the increased output that is sure to result."
 WRS_meet_with_yakovlev_desc: "Alexander Yakovlev, one of the most powerful officials in Ukhta, has become increasingly infamous in Arkhangelsk for his promotion of reformist ideas. Yakovlev has been especially critical of the present system of war communism. While dissent may be difficult to brook in these times, we should arrange an opportunity to hear his ideas out. Who knows? They may have some merit after all."
 WRS_a_harsh_truth_desc: "The discussions with Alexander Yakovlev have changed a number of minds in the halls of government. While the ideas of war communism had their uses during Suvorov, or when the original White armies rose up in the name of their tsar, we have found ourselves exploiting far too much for far too little gain. The long-term survival of the Front will not be assured if the lands we control slip through our fingers as we tighten our grip. Reform to our practices may indeed be necessary."
 WRS_doctrinal_reevaluation_desc: "The West Russian War nearly drove the Germans from Russian soil entirely, but in the end, it failed. We must ask ourselves: why? Surely, one of the primary reasons is the failure of the military doctrines that the Front has been utilizing for decades. We must reassess such doctrines, such as Tukhachevsky's "deep battle", and decide whether or not they are truly useful in the modern era. It may be controversial within the officer corps, but if our survival demands that we change our strategy, then change we must."
 WRS_the_mistakes_of_the_past_desc: "The initial Bukharinist wave of Soviet industrialization brought with it many benefits. However, it proved to be, at best, inadequate to face total war against the Germans. Perhaps pursuing autarky should not be the primary goal of a military-industrial program. We must reassess the industrial policies of the past, to see what works and what does not."
 WRS_learn_from_america_desc: "The Americans may have once been our enemies, but in the West Russian War, they proved themselves to be a useful ally and supplier of goods. CIA guns helped to force the Germans back from the A-A line, and there are certainly still backchannels that are active. While America has not always been a friend to the Soviet Union and its ideals, that doesn't mean that we can't gain from their assistance in the future."
 WRS_into_the_future_desc: "Autarky didn't work. War communism didn't work either.\n\nBold, loud statements that certainly would get the first generation of Bolsheviks rolling in their graves, but does it really matter, when they're followed by hundreds of thousands of youth, in unmarked graves, taken before their time? The truth is, the Soviet Union collapsed for many reasons and the future Grand Marshall Zhukov believes one of the reasons was its downright overbearing control over every aspect of the state, to the detriment of itself. While we cannot spare to alleviate our pressure too much, we will start the first of many steps towards a proletariat state truly for the people, starting with our mandate press. After all, there are all matters of members in our territory that simply desire their voice to be heard, and as long as we keep a proper measure of things, these seemingly simple gestures of goodwill are but the first step of our plan to a truly, future-proof Union."
 WRS_why_we_fight_desc: "Among the civilian population of the Front's territories, morale is somewhat grim. Grand Marshal Yegorov's advanced age is no secret, and the recent deprivations of the food crisis have certainly left their scars. We should begin a new propaganda campaign at once, focusing on the reclamation of West Russia, and the disorganized rat's nest that the Reich has become. With Hitler a corpse and the Germans squabbling amongst themselves, the Front is poised to achieve its greatest triumphs!"
 WRS_why_we_survive_desc: "One of the most devastating blows to Front morale over the years has been the incessant Luftwaffe bombing. While rumors of unrest in Germany may yet bring their "target practice" to an end, there is hardly a person in West Russia who doesn't know a victim of bombs and shrapnel. We cannot prevent every sortie, but by using our propaganda organs to promote a message of resilience, we can hopefully staunch some of the trauma. The Russian people have souls of steel, after all. If anyone can keep calm and carry on, it is us."
 WRS_a_united_front_desc: "The succession of the Front's leadership is all but assured now. Under the future guidance of Marshal Zhukov, we will emerge stronger than ever before. The fascist scum will be driven back from West Russia, past the Valdai Hills and the Medveditsa. And we shall march into the future, to build a new Soviet Union under bold new leadership, with the happiness of all mankind in our hearts."

 WRS_the_end_of_the_bombings_desc: "At first, the high command thought that it was a fluke. Then the weeks pass, and the silent skies did not budge. The bombing that has destroyed and devastated Russia has come to an end. Everywhere throughout the Front's territory and Russia itself, the giant laid to rest so long ago is awakening. However, there can be no delay; the illegitimate warlords to the south of us will make their move. The Front, for the lone sake of its survival, must act in tandem, for socialism can no longer suffer defeat.\n\nThe Front will continue the re-consolidation and establishment of its authority over northern Russia. Workers and soldiers both will repair the roads and patch up the communication hubs. Without fear or coercion, we will rise again, and the Union of old shall stand once more, its memories untarnished by neither defeat nor failure. The march to communism will continue."
 WRS_reestablished_farming_desc: "During the years of the bombing, agricultural activity, an already rare and complex issue in the cold north, became harder, as neither the government nor the worker was willing to leave lives and tools as clear targets for German planes. With the departure of the Germans over Russian skies, the high command has now decided that farming in the open is now feasible again. No longer shall the Front be dependent on the illegitimate contenders to its powers, and alone shall it stand as the beacon of socialism in Russia.\n\nThe fields that had laid in waste for long shall find growing on them the bountiful fruit of Russia once again. No soldier of the Front shall ever find themselves without food, starving in the cold in the name of socialism. Soon no one in its service will ever know the feeling of hunger, with the Front shattering its vestiges to the winds. We will move ever forward to the dawn of tomorrow."
 WRS_uncover_the_industry_desc: "After the defeat and retreat of the Red Air Force in repelling the German bombing over West Russia, a large amount of the industry that the Front now possesses has to hide for fear of German shrapnel tearing apart valuable heavy machinery that the Front could not replace. With the bombing over and the onslaught paused, the Front can uncover these factories from hiding, and work can resume within them, as fires will roar out and steel flow like rivers of labor.\n\nThe Front will tear down the camouflage of these factories, and workers will crowd their floors once again. The Front's soldiers and the citizenry will no longer suffer from a lack of consumer goods and industrial necessities. Soon, no one will recognize the meaning of lack itself, as Marx once foretold in his writings. To each according to their ability, to each according to their needs."
 WRS_resume_military_exercises_desc: "During the duration of the German bombing campaign, the high command decided to put a halt to ongoing military exercises. It was ineffective: the trained men would be sitting ducks against an onslaught of German bombers, clear as day. While this happened, training continued in secret, subdued and submerged in the fog and dark of night. The state of the discipline, meanwhile, deteriorated as recruits and veterans alike languish in nervous inactivity.\n\nThe time to be still and unmoving has ended. The exercises shall continue, and the Front's soldiers will steel themselves to the demands of war. Troops will patrol the roads in more numbers than before. As the warlords of the south awaken to the fact of the bombing, war shall come to the Front, sooner or later. They will not find us wanting, as socialism will march out from the gates of Arkhangelsk once again, ready to reclaim the world."
 WRS_dig_up_the_caches_desc: "In the immediate aftermath of the West Russian War and the subsequent bombing campaign, the Front decided to hide its excess equipment in camouflaged stockpiles and warehouses. The majority, however, are buried in unmarked spots in Northern Russia, waiting for the day that the Front can reclaim its rightful place as the successor state of the old Union. In times like these, when men and guns are scarce, it would be better to lack just one and not both.\n\nThe Front will send its soldiers to the places where the buried equipment is located. They will dig them out and return them to Arkhangelsk or the nearest deposit of weapons and ammunition. Meanwhile, the Front will throw the doors of the warehouses and stockpiles open, its contents distributed among the soldiers as befits their role. The illegitimate claimants in the south will no longer regard the Front with weakness, but fear."
 WRS_reopen_the_mines_desc: "As the retreat of the Front drew to a close and the bombing campaign started, the mines operating in Northern Russia that had poured steel and aluminum to the rest of the Union shut themselves down for fear of collapse by the tremors of German shrapnel. The Front was wary of sending miners and equipment to exploit it during the campaign. With the departure of the Germans, however, the Front now sees no reason to let these assets languish and atrophy in disuse.\n\nThe high command will issue a directive for miners and workers to work these mines again, while a transport system will ply the routes to and from Arkhangelsk, carrying needed resources to factories. There, the Front's factories will hammer steel and aluminum into tanks, planes, and guns. These will be useful in the struggle for the unification of the old Union, and from thereon, the war for a world revolution."
 WRS_archangelsk_calling_desc: "Grave news has made itself known in Arkhangelsk. The Grand Marshal Yegorov, who has guided the Front through its toughest years, is now dead. As the doctors and coroners scramble to deduce the cause of death, it has sent shockwaves through the Front's chain of command. The Front now braces itself for another radical shift: change in leadership as its figurehead for the last decade fades away. Whoever takes control of the Front is set to shape the destiny of the Union to come.\n\nWith haste, the Front must select a successor to the Grand Marshal's seat. The two obvious contenders are the Marshals Tukhachevsky and Zhukov, each with their fiefdoms in the south. Whoever the Front chooses to be its leader, it must make haste, for the world is changing, and opportunity does not wait."

Despite his prowess and genius, as well as his undying faith in the eventual triumph of socialism, he remained unrecognized for his talents, atrophying away in Plesetsk. Still, he bided his time and awaited his turn to strike.\n\nWith the other contenders to power gone, he has emerged as the indisputable leader of the Front, leading it as a worthy successor to Lenin's and Bukharin's legacy. Before he can move on to other, more urgent affairs, his inauguration cannot stand a delay.

Russia belongs to the Revolution, now and forever.\n\nIt is time to initiate the mobilization of the state for the reclamation of Russia. The reservists will be recalled.

Most reflections and analysis of the war turn into excuses and blaming others who are dead or long-since fled.\n\nNo one will accept blame. No one will accept responsibility. Unless we want to repeat these mistakes, we must examine the West Russian War with a clear and critical eye and learn - not ignore.\n\nGrand Marshal Tukhachevsky has commissioned such an analysis on the West Russian War - and the lessons learned will be applied not just to the future war with Germany, but any wars we engage in. History will judge us, as we judge those who came before us - let it see that we learned from our failures."

Tukhachevsky will not make this same mistake, and will establish SMERSH as the official state security service, assuming the duties of the former NKVD and GRU.\n\nThis organization will need a leader, and Vladimir Kyruchkov has been chosen for the job, as he possesses the necessary credentials, and has proven himself as competent and loyal to Tukhachevsky.

Tukhachevsky will hold these qualities in mind as he makes his appointments.\n\nIona Yakir, Dmitry Ustinov, Vladimir Triandafillov, Yan Gamarnik, and Iorenim Uborevich will assume roles in this prestigious body. Yakir and Ustinov will also be promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union as a reward for their loyalty, competence, and dedication to the Union over their distinguished careers."

This solution was the creation of the Voenspetsy, a practice which integrated ideologically compatible individuals from the Whites, who were allowed to work under strict supervision of the Cheka or commissars.\n\nWe face a similar problem today, and the Voenspetsy practice offers a solution.\n\nWe will identify and assimilate ideologically compatible specialists from defeated armies into our own. They will not be trusted with critical tasks, of course, and SMERSH will be responsible for ensuring their loyalty - but this practice will ensure that the Red Army retains as much expertise and experience as possible for the wars to come."

They will show us no consideration or mercy - nor can we to them. When they betrayed the Soviet Union, their fates were sealed, and now they must reap the consequences.\n\nAll threats to the state, and traitors to the Union must be utterly crushed. SMERSH will be given sanction to oversee operations and reprisals against the military and political leadership of the traitorous states against us.

Poverty, inefficiencies, stagnation, our state has many issues we are only just now beginning to rectify - with the realities that we are surrounded by enemies in all directions. Yet we possess the revolutionary spirit. We possess the fervor, the will, and the desire to succeed.\n\nWe will win or die. There are no alternatives.\n\nWe cannot afford frivolous luxuries, or waste even cheap materials. Each and every resource must be found, quantified, and devoted to the war effort.

To this end, we will encourage our citizens to donate all that they can to the cause. Every spare pot can be melted into metal for a tank. Every excess piece of clothing can be repurposed for bandages. There is much that can be given - and we expect our citizens to recognize this, and sacrifice as we all must.\n\nAdditionally, we will increase our production quotas to wartime standards, and ensure that our industries are in compliance. While this additional labor may generate resentment among the workers, it is needed if we are to succeed. The Red Army will not fall, even if we must cannibalize our state to do so."

 WRS_tukha_labor_is_bread_desc: "An army that is hungry is an army that will eventually deteriorate. It will become distracted, disorganized, unfocused, and mutinous. This will be followed by a splintering and total collapse of discipline and order. An army that cannot fulfill the basic needs of its soldiers is one that cannot succeed. There can be no resource spared for ensuring our military is in the best shape possible - and this includes keeping them well-fed.\n\nTo this end we will begin an organized confiscation of grain harvested from all farmers under our authority for military usage. We have few farms in the Front, and are already stretching the limits of our resources. While these confiscations will deprive the civilians and farmers of some food, better it be them who must experience temporary hunger than the soldiers who fight, bleed, and die to protect them."

The exercise will serve two purposes - to improve the interoperability of our own forces, and showcase our prowess to our enemies.\n\nThese demonstrations may make our enemies reconsider any military operations against us - and at minimum will serve as a message to West Russia that cannot be ignored."

Be it incompetence or malice, Zhukov cultivated something that was weak, corrupt, and poisonous. His disastrous rule had but one useful side-effect - it made everyone there complacent.\n\nGrand Marshal Tukhachevsky will return the district to order. The entire rotten apparatus of Uhkta will be cleansed. The corrupt expunged, the capitalists executed, and the local military whipped back into appropriate shape.

Only when the state is aligned in their struggle, can they not merely survive - but thrive.\n\nThis is the mission of the Red Army. Unlike their contemporaries, who are slaves of the capitalist state, the Red Army serves and protects the working class first and foremost. They will stand, defend, and die for them, for theirs is a sacred responsibility.\n\nThey are the sword and shield of the people, liberating and protecting the worker from the wrath of capitalism and fascism.

Their theft deprives the people of their rightful bounty.\n\nThis exploitation will end.\n\nBukharin's experiment is over, and it is time the rightful order be reasserted. All private enterprises will be subordinated to the state, and any remaining wealth these parasites possess appropriated through taxes.

We are reaching a critical phase, and we cannot afford delays and shortages now. Ustinov has been consulted, and has assured the Grant Marshal that it is feasible to raise quotas to meet this demand.

With the matter of succession settled, we must now look beyond.\n\nTo our south lie theocrats, collaborators, monarchists and a variety of traitors who stabbed us in the back when we were at our weakest. Through words or weapons, they will be brought to heel, and the people that suffer under their regimes liberated.

For only united will we be able to beat back the German hoard, and reclaim what was lost."
 WRS_honor_the_fallen_desc: "For the past twenty years, the Soviet people have known little more than bombings, conflict and famine. We have lost many. Not only those who fought on the front lines, but those who labored away; feeding our country and supplying our troops. Those who never gave up, even in our darkest days, when it seemed the dream of our Union would be snuffed out. Many gave their lives to the dream of workers living free from capitalism and the German yoke.\n\nTo honor these heroes, we will hold a celebration highlighting the contributions that they have made to the survival of the Front. Veterans of these conflicts will be prominently featured - and will hopefully serve to rekindle the spirit of the people, and awaken their desire to once more see the Soviet Union restored."
 WRS_instill_the_spirit_of_patriotism_desc: "In dire times like these, it is easy to give up hope. Morale has faded since the Union's collapse, even more so when the hopes of victory were dashed in the West Russian War. Our people need to be motivated if we are to have a chance at reclaiming the nation. To rekindle this patriotism in the people, we must double down on propaganda efforts and highlight the terrors of those that lie to our south. Additioanlly, with the bombings over, we can also now increase the production of goods, and distribute them safely, something that will surely only increase their spirits further."
 WRS_exercises_on_the_borders_desc: "While it is unfortunate that we will take up arms against fellow Russians, conflict between the various fiefdoms that hold values so different from us is inevitable. Our military must be ready. The Front has many veterans from the West Russian War yet we have many inexperienced recruits pouring in due to our efforts at inspiring our people.\n\nPerforming exercises then will serve as both a way to train the new recruits, familiarize them with our territory, and serve as a warning to the neighboring statelets."
 WRS_march_for_the_motherland_desc: "Previous efforts to encourage troops to enlist have been moderately successful, but it unfortunately has not led to sufficient enlistment for us to be confident in our upcoming trials. We need more manpower, and clearly must expand our recruitment efforts.\n\nParades showing the might of the Red Army, accompanied by comprehensive propaganda campaigns, and an expansion of recruitment drives, should be enough to push our recruitment numbers over the edge. That this will almost certainly increase general support for the war effort is a welcome bonus."
 WRS_ready_the_citizenry_desc: "The military might appear as the only part of conflict, but behind them are our citizens, who are just as important. The Front needs the workers to provide arms and food for our soldiers, and without our citizens, what are we even fighting for?\n\nThey too will face great trials in the wars to come, so we must prepare them for this reality. All are familiar with the constant ringing of air raid sirens and can sprint to a shelter in a moment's notice, yet there is more they can learn to better survive. By providing first aid courses to as many people as possible, the lives of our citizens and even soldiers can be saved, should they find themselves in a war zone. Finally, they also must be taught how to further ration, reuse, and stockpile goods to best weather the ever-changing supply of essentials."
 WRS_operation_beacon_desc: "No one can deny that the Front is the true continuation of the Soviet Union. We fought the Germans back to the gates of Moscow in the West Russian War. We bore the brunt of their bombing campaigns, and were hardened like iron by The Arctic. The people look to us as a vanguard, which defends the proletariat of West Russia.\n\nThe Front must further spread this message. Grand Marshal Zhukov has authorized Operation BEACON for this purpose. Distributing leaflets and materials, hijacking radio broadcasts, spreading the word of our accomplishments, and sending in agents to neighboring statelets will effectively sway their populace. When the front expands, our compatriots will welcome us into their towns, at least more so then they otherwise would. We will serve as a beacon within the darkness of Russia, drawing the disillusioned to our cause, for we are the torch that will set alight the spirit of socialism within the people of Russia once more!"
 WRS_an_invitation_for_all_of_russia_desc: "The rival governments of Russia do not reflect the values and beliefs of the people they rule over. Millions still remember the good times before the Great Patriotic War and how the Soviet Union made such progress in so little time. While our successive defeats have shaken this support, it is still widespread across the nation.\n\nSupporters of communism, and the Front hold some sway in several statelets, while within others, there are large enough numbers of Communists to put pressure on their leaders. We will invite our supporters to pursue reintegration into the Front, either through pressuring their governments or fleeing to us themselves. As little blood between the Soviet People must be spilled as possible - our true enemy is to the west, not between brothers."
 WRS_welcome_them_home_desc: "Operation BEACON is proving fruitful, with a noticeable influx of refugees and defectors pouring into our territory. We now have more hands to help our war and production efforts, yet we also have many more mouths to feed, homes to find, and families to settle - all of which makes our march south to more fertile lands even more crucial.\n\nThe recent influx of immigrants has also been a further boon for our propaganda efforts. Showing that so many are willing to risk their lives to reach our borders has strengthened our legitimacy, proving that most Russians see us as the true successors to the Soviet Union - something which will only compound as time continues to pass."
 WRS_new_approaches_desc: "The years of anarchy have not been kind to the people of Russia. Whilst many are still supporters of the cause, some have become disillusioned and apathetic, sometimes adopting beliefs contradictory to communism. This is a reality that we must deal with. Unlike the Soviets of the past, we cannot simply purge them out of existence. While we won't tolerate these heretical beliefs, to placate their followers, integrating aspects of their ideology, or making them feel heard, is vital for holding The Front together.\n\nThe tsarists and theocrats demand the church play a more prominent role within society. Liberals wish for a more open debate between different ideologies, while nationalists support emphasizing identity. While we won't capitulate to all of their demands, we can at least present an openness as a temporary measure - if one only to make their integration smoother."
 WRS_the_soviets_born_anew_desc: "While the road ahead is still long, the foundations have been laid for a new Soviet Union, stronger than before. We have and will continue to learn from the mistakes of the past. Communism will still be achieved, but the path to get there will be shaped less by ideological orthodoxy, and instead by the circumstances that we must contend with. The Communist Party itself should be a far larger tent, with more interfactional debate being tolerated, and less of an emphasis on democratic centralism. The writings of Marx, Engels and Lenin serve as a framework that we can build off of, not something that we follow to the letter. What communism will look like and how we get there should not be set in stone, but fluid and adaptable."
 WRS_increase_production_quotas_desc: "As the Front expands, we've gained access to more industrial equipment and far more fertile land than that of Arkhangelsk. Therefore, our industrial capacity has expanded, and our quotas need to reflect this capability. This will put additional strain on the workers, but this is necessary for the survival of the Front. Our enemies are larger and more experienced than the disorganized brigades we've fought before. Half-measures are insufficient - and our production must rise to meet the demands of war."
 WRS_expand_military_rations_desc: "Our soldiers, the heroes of the revolution, are at the heart of the Front. They've liberated thousands from the capitalist regimes, and tyrannical statelets that occupy the former Soviet Union - and they will be the ones to rid Russia of German imperialism. For their efforts, for their sacrifices we reward them\n\nIncreasing their rations will only further motivate our soldiers. It's difficult to fight on an empty stomach, after all. While this may draw envy from the civilians, the Red Army is vital for rebuilding a Russia where everyone is fed, and such sacrifices are necessary for this future. And perhaps, the promise of more food will incentivize our recruitment further."
 WRS_reinforce_the_railways_desc: "In the three decades between the establishment of the Soviet Union and our defeat in the Great Patriotic War, thousands of miles of railways were constructed throughout Russia. They were vital from the Union's conception during our revolution, and a critical aspect of the mass industrialization that followed. After years without a central authority to maintain them, and the sustained German bombing, they've fallen into disrepair. It is time this be remedied.\n\nWith refurbishments and reinforcements, this railway network can once again fuel the Soviet industrial machine and more importantly, supply the troops in our ongoing struggle to reunify the nation - and to one day, drive back the Germans, and reclaim all that was taken from us."
 WRS_ready_emergency_stockpiles_desc: "Russia has only known chaos for the past two decades, and this unfortunately will continue for a few years more. We must be ready to adapt and overcome the ever-changing situation on the ground as a result.\n\nBy divesting a small amount of equipment and food into a national stockpile, we will be able to withstand any unpredictable situations that we will surely encounter. Small depots scattered throughout the country will serve as a failsafe in the event our growth is temporarily stunted by famine or military defeat. Neither will defeat us. With the correct planning and strategy, we will survive anything our enemies, nature, or circumstance can throw at us."
 WRS_fortify_the_frontlines_desc: "More conflict is inevitable on our journey to reunify the motherland. Our enemies greedily eye our borders, and wish to rob us of our rightful destiny. We don't know when they will strike, or who will strike first - so we must be prepared for any scenario. Bunkers, trenches and minefields along our borders will assist in repelling any enemy attack - or positing our offensives for success. We were unprepared for the Nazi invasion once - and we will not make the same mistake again."
 WRS_operation_october_desc: "On the road to the reunification of Russia, the illegitimate warlords of the west are the first obstacle. While these warlords reject communism, many people they rule over remember the Soviet Union well, and wish for our return. This is a vulnerability Grand Marshal Zhukov has recognized - Thus he has authorized Operation OCTOBER to capitalize on it.\n\nWe will use the loyal Soviets throughout Russia to weaken our opponents from within. By helping us gain intelligence, stealing their supplies, sabotaging their war efforts, and perhaps even a direct uprising from within, they will ensure our success. A two-pronged attack from inside and outside the pretender statelets will significantly enhance our reconquest. A new October Revolution will spread to every town in Russia - and hasten the return of rightful Soviet rule."
 WRS_in_the_dead_of_night_desc: "From the shadows, our agents will infiltrate the opposing statelets, and locate supporters of the Front within them. There they will funnel their loyalty, discontent, and eagerness into organized action to further weaken our opponents. From behind the front lines, saboteurs will set back any progress the enemy makes and force them to reposition their equipment and manpower. They will also forge contacts to send information back to Arkhangelsk, improving our understanding of the on the ground situation, and provide us with knowledge of our opponents tactics. With this advantage, our enemies will fall quickly when the time comes, allowing us to more properly prepare for our more powerful adversaries."
 WRS_contact_communist_sympathizers_desc: "The Soviet Union has fallen, at least for now, but millions of faithful communists across the fractured union are still sympathetic to its cause. We are certain that at least some of them will be willing enough to continue fighting for a better Russia.\n\nOur agents will locate those willing, and any who can be brought back to the Front to directly help our struggle will be permitted. For others who wish to remain where they are, they will be organized, armed and funded so that they can undermine their illegitimate statelets from within - Weakening the warlords, for the day when the Front will come to liberate the people once more."
 WRS_sabotage_and_steal_desc: "The Front is always in need of new equipment, yet there's only so much we can produce on our own. Our newly recruited sympathizers should be put to this use.\n\nWorking alongside our agents, they'll smuggle weapons, share intelligence, and work to bring anything they can get their hands on back to the Front. What they're unable to smuggle will be destroyed, alongside sabotaging any infrastructure or industry that could make our inevitable reconquest more difficult. If we can't have it, we will make sure no one else will."
 WRS_spread_the_chaos_desc: "Operation OCTOBER nears its crescendo as the seeds have been sown for maximum chaos and disorder. Soon our agents, and communist sympathizers spread across West Russia will spring into action. First, a day of reckoning for those who lead their treasonous states, prominent government officials and military members in particular will come. We will stoke the embers of the October Revolution, instigating strikes, riots, insurrections, and even uprisings that will shake the illegitimate statelets to their core.\n\nThe enemy will be too distracted by their internal strife to fully focus on the greater threat - the military might of the Front amassing on their borders. When we strike, they'll be fighting on two fronts - and make their demise assured."
 WRS_the_union_rises_again_desc: "Our victory over the statelets of West Russia seemed inevitable to anyone with an understanding of the region, yet this does not make our reconquest feel any less glorious. The dream of a reunited Soviet Union draws one step closer. What once was a hardened, battered, and bruised clique of those still loyal to the communist cause now governs the actual beginnings of a state, facing larger opportunities - and greater foes.\n\nHowever, more pretenders lie to the east. If we are ever to reclaim Moscow from the tentacles of the German Reich, our burgeoning Soviet Republic will need their people and resources. Through peace, or through war, the rest of Russia will be for the worker. It must be! For the destiny of the Soviet people lies with us!"

The sacrifices of thousands of Red Army soldiers and their comrades are forged now into a new stability from Arkhangelsk to Ufa.\n\nUnlike others across the Russian wastes, our revolutionary front aspires to more than simply self preservation. With our foothold established, the time has come for a return to normalcy.\n\nThe Presidium, that beloved and loathed institution, must find life anew.\n\nHowever, in accordance with the Grand Marshal's theories. We will find a balance between civilian and military administration. The Red Army, as the harbinger of revolution, will never again be simply beholden to the will of bureaucrats and schemers. Neither will the Presidium be entirely useless, lest our legitimacy be dissolved.\n\nA new struggle for the soul and structure of the new government has begun. Let us take to the task in earnest, and remain watchful of the failings of our past."

 WRS_tukha_regional_those_loyal_civilians_desc: "Zhukov, in his years pathetically jockeying for the favour of Yegorov often called Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky the "would be usurper" in an attempt to paint him as some aspiring tyrant.\n\nThe truth was never so petty, nor was it so simple. The Grand Marshal has made no secret of his disdain for the traitors and bureaucrats that led the Union to ruin, but this does not mean he aspires to become a simple military despot. The Grand Marshal seeks to overcome the failures of the past, ensuring the men who direct the revolution understand its importance.\n\nThankfully, there are still some who fit such a criteria. Those loyal civilian administrators who have come around to the new spirit of our struggle will be granted seats in the Presidium. Thus civilian rule returns to West Russia, alieving the army of suffocatingly complex political duties.\n\nHowever, the Red Army must remain wary and watchful of this new Presidium. While its goals align for now with those of the people, the past has shown the potential for careerism and treachery such an institution can create."

While millions evacuated across the Ural mountains, it stood firm in the face of the impending apocalypse. For decades, it has waged a ceaseless war against the dying of the light.\n\nIf the Red Army is itself to be an appendage of the international proletariat, it is only logical that it be involved in the organization and direction of their struggle. civilian and military distinctions are of little meaning to a people under siege.\n\nNever again will we permit the development of a distinct bureaucratic class; a cabal of snivering rats who claim the victories of the proletariat as their own while undermining them at every turn with incompetence and political "ambition."\n\nThe Masses themselves will exercise power through one institution alone. A synthesis of the army and the Presidium, staffed with the front's veteran marshals. Finally, we will have a government of those who have mingled with and fought only for the people."

However, it cannot be allowed to enact its will unchallenged, as it has in past decades.\n\nPer the Grand Marshal's orders, a system of checks and balances is to be devised. Many abilities such as; the ratification of treaties, declaration of war, the abrogation of the Grand Marshal's decrees, and the appointment of certain ministers will be restricted.\n\nThere are some duties that are only suited to those who will put their lives on the line for the people.

The scheming of incompetent politicians caused the Unions downfall twice before, and let to the deaths of millions.\n\nIn spite of this, it seems that politicians may yet again be necessary. The new Soviet state faces a myriad of questions. From ethnic autonomy to social and economic policy, there are many hours of vigorous debate ahead. Debates that will require experts, delegators and compromisers.\n\nThe Red Army must stand above such petty squabbles, serving only the interests of the international proletariat. Therefore, it is hardly fit for long term governance, much less policy making.\n\nThe Presidium will be granted significant legislative and judicial powers in matters of national administration. However, this does not mean that the Red Army will become beholden to its whims.

Though its goals were noble, the Soviets were corrupted by institutions such as the NKVD and hurt by disastrous economic plans which failed to properly industrialize Russia.\n\nBut chiefly, Bukharin's failure to develop an economy which could mobilize itself in time for war and his outright refusal to invest in military spending when the German threat was ever-approaching. Our most prominent communist intellectuals within the newly united state are advising that we look towards other old revolutionary theorists."
 WRS_tukha_regional_lessons_from_trotsky: "Lessons from Trotsky?"
 WRS_tukha_regional_lessons_from_trotsky_desc: "One figure that has been somewhat valorized by a few intellectuals recently is Leon Trotsky. Sadly, Comrade Trotsky had his life cut short by a mentally ill assassin, so his ideas never came to fruition in the old Soviet Republic. Tukhachevsky maintains the belief that the dictatorship of the proletariat must be enforced by a strong revolutionary army, a belief he held in common with Trotsky. Perhaps we should advance some of Trotsky's theories on the dynamics of state, as his critique of Bukharin resonates with many of the intellectuals aligned with the Red Army."

The Red Army must dedicate itself to preserving the revolution by offering socialist education to its soldiers and informing the West Russian civilians that the Red Army will protect them.\n\nFinally, the Red Army may act as a force of political change in Russia, securing the revolution against the reactionaries within Russia and the Germans across the border."

The time of the West Russian Revolutionary Front is drawing to a close, and we must draft a constitution for a civilian state.\n\nHowever, the toil and sacrifice of the Red Army soldiers who fought and died for this moment to pass must never be forgotten. As defenders of the revolution against bourgeois reaction, the army must play an important role in all three branches of the state, not only to ensure the nation is protected from the forces of capital, but to guide its workers towards the great revolutionary war with the fascist invaders."

The Grand Marshal cannot be a puppet to its whims if he is to wage revolutionary wars against the enemies of the working class. The true purpose of the Presidium is to function as an advisory body to him, staffed with the most loyal generals and specialists in the country who can give suggestions on how he may better implement socialism in the Front - while knowing their place and relation to him truly is."

It is the last hope of socialism in a capitalist world, that the workers of the world may be free of the fascist menace that has enslaved entire continents under their heel. However, many, particularly our new recruits, have forgotten this, and simply regard themselves as being superior in some way to the civilians they protect.

It is by these institutions that civilians are trained and led in the quest to unify Russia and defeat the fascist invaders.

Although the Soviet Union followed the New Economic Policy that espoused limited private ownership of the economy before the Great Patriotic War, the radical socialists in our government not only believe its allowance of private markets ran contrary to the tenets of Marxism, but that it didn't develop the country enough that it allowed the old Union to defeat the fascists. They believe that the large, state-owned collectives will be able to accelerate the means of production in ways simple market growth cannot and will allow us to rapidly rebuild the country. On the contrary, the more orthodox socialists in the government believe the means of production are not yet advanced enough to allow the abolition of private markets, and that allowing private businesses to operate is a more realistic choice for our level of development. However, a choice must be made soon."

Through this process of collectivization, the economy will no longer be subject to fickle fluctuation of markets and the tides of supply and demand, but will grow according to rational state planning. More importantly to the socialist cause, the workers of the West Russian Revolutionary Front will no longer fear oppression from bourgeois masters and shall surely prosper under equal wages for equal labour policies implemented by the government."

Whether it was bronze, or iron, or steel, as long as the smiths had access to that one material, their army could be confident that they were well equipped. Such things are not so simple anymore. Modern weapons need many different materials in order to be created and function properly. Tank engines need special components that must be made of chromium to work properly. Aluminum is vital to constructing airplanes as it is the only material light enough to allow them to take flight.\n\nIt is fortunate that the territory we have reclaimed has large reserves of both of these materials. If we want to assemble an air force and an armored fleet large enough to win a war against the full might of fascists we must begin mining these deposits immediately. Even the very soil of Russia will give everything it has to the war effort."

It mattered not how many slogans were shouted in the streets of Leningrad, or how many unionized workers battled in Moscow. The peasant would stare back blankly, incapable of truly understanding the tyranny of Industrial wage labor.\n\nIt was with him in mind that Chairman Bukharin determined that the New Economic Policy was vital. While the more impatient members of the party wished for immediate collectivization of industry and agriculture, this was simply not viable in the prevailing circumstances. Marxist theory is clear, socialism arises out of the ashes of capitalism. It would be foolish to attempt to force it into existence, when the foundation simply was not present.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Grand Marshal that Bukharin, for all his flaws, was correct in this policy. Now that our situation has stabilized, we can begin to revive the NEP. To stand up to reactionaries the world over and develop a truly socialist society, we will first pass through a form of controlled market economy. Small scale private industry will be encouraged, as will limited foreign investment wherever possible. Soon, we will have a healthy foundation upon wish to launch our struggle."

 WRS_tukha_regional_lessons_from_bukharin_desc: "During his tenure as the General Secretary, Bukharin initiated a series of programs to develop the industry of the Union. One of the most important goals for these plans was to modernize a terribly outdated transportation system. At the time Russia's rail system was woefully insufficient to facilitate the mass movement of people and supplies required by a modern industrial economy. The Fascist invasion interrupted the modernization of our transportation infrastructure, but Bukharin made some progress and now we must pick up where he left off.\n\nNew rail lines must be laid down and old ones repaired until we have connected every major town and industrial center to one another. We will lay down a new system of paved roads to allow movement across the nation by car and truck as well as by train. Defeating the Germans will require a modernized economy, and a modern economy cannot run on dirt roads and broken rails."

As the next war with the Germans approaches, the men and women serving in the factories will be every bit as important as those on the front lines. Without them there would be no bullets and shells to fire and no guns and cannons to fire them. Our industry is no longer limited to a few factories around Arkhangelsk. Our workers need to be ready to work as part of a machine that will span thousands of miles and consist of hundreds of factories, foundries, and munitions plants, all running around the clock to fuel the armies of the Front.\n\nWe will train the workers of our nation how to work in this new war economy. Part of this training will involve indoctrinating them on their own importance to the war effort. If we can inspire the same fanaticism in our workers as our soldiers, our industrial power will increase rapidly."

While the cost in money and men and time is great, so is the cost in steel. Without steel, every weapon from a grenade to a tank cannot be produced. Without tungsten we cannot make the armor-piercing ammunition that will be essential to defeating the massed tank formations the Germans are so fond of.\n\nDuring the reign of the warlords, when the traitors forced us back to the far north, shortages of both these materials hampered our war production. Now we have reclaimed much of our nation, including several promising but unexploited resource deposits. Marshal Tukhachevsky has ordered that the production of all materials useful to the coming war be increased immediately. Mining these deposits will increase our available steel and tungsten reserves and make us less reliant on outside imports to build our weapons."

In addition to tanks, modern armies field armored troop transports to carry infantry, as well as heavily armed vehicles designed to transport soldiers into combat and provide direct fire support during battle.\n\nTo catch up with the rest of the world, we will prioritize assembling these vehicles for a full year. At the price of a greater production cost, our factories will churn out more vehicles than ever before. Every single tank, armored transport, and fighting vehicle that rolls off the assembly lines will shrink the gap between our forces and the Germans.

Some of the equipment will be reverse-engineered so we can begin producing our own domestic versions.

Once the bullets begin flying, the die will have already been cast; however, until that moment, the laborers of the Front are working around the clock to build up our industry to compete with the Germans.\n\nGrand Marshal Tukhachevsky has ordered that industrial expansion be accelerated even further. Some of his advisors warn of the dangers of taking such large loans, yet others point out that the economy is growing rapidly on its own, and this is no time to try to enforce moderation. The Marshal has listened to their words but he is unconcerned about the economy. The final victory is at hand, and he will pay any price to achieve it."

America and the other free nations of the world have access to specialty equipment purpose-built to make modern weapons and vehicles. For a modest sum they could be persuaded to part with some of this equipment, and once these new machines are in our hands our engineers can dismantle them and learn how they work.

Practiced among certain divisions and only credited by a few theorists, it is a doctrine that has been half heartedly pursued.\n\nAs the final struggle approaches, we must ensure we have a unified command, a professional army, and reserves to exploit breakthroughs.

Drawn from the rabble when the hour arose, it sought to defend its parent bourgeoisie and secure new markets for their exploitation.\n\nYes, these examples serve as apt descriptions of what an army has been. What has remained unanswered however, is what an army ought to be?\n\nRising above the bickering of Bukharin and the military failures of the past, Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky has had ample time to answer this question. Synthesizing his wisdom over two decades of defeat, his ultimate answer is simple; the army of the future is international.\n\nThe Red Army will never be resigned to serve as a simple tool of politicians. Instead, it will be a political organ onto itself. Comprising workers and peasants from across the planet, it will know no border. Men and women will look to it as the vanguard of their salvation, and rely on it to forever defend their interests.\n\nAn essential organ of the socialist state, it will wage war on any reactionary who dare threaten it, slowly liberating the oppressed the world over. Its actions will forever be in line with the inevitable socialist future. Only then, when all the oppressors have fallen, may its ranks disband back into militia.

While it may be tempting to use our limited resources to produce scores of light vehicles, it would also be foolish.\n\nUsing techniques from the newly integrated Gorky Tank Factory, mass production will begin on a main battle tank. Able to fill all armoured roles universally, it must be based upon captured German designs as well as those produced a decade ago. Such a vehicle will be vital in exploiting breakthroughs, causing chaos in enemy supply lines, providing operating space for soldiers, and stalling reinforcements at any single point.\n\nLet the enemy unleash their fury upon us.

By requisitioning all aircraft we can get our hands upon, training amateur pilots, and iterating on captured jet designs, we will attack quantity with quality.

 WRS_tukha_regional_shared_hatreds_desc: "There are many differences in mode of production, ideology and culture between the West Russian Revolutionary Front and the United States, but there is one thing that unites us: our mutual hatred for the fascists who have humiliated us both. We must remember that this and this alone will keep the anti-fascist front against Germany and Japan alive. Through our shared despising for these barbaric reactionaries, the anti-fascists of the world shall pummel their empires into the dust, and only then can the workers' paradise be built and the class conflict to begin again in earnest."
 WRS_tukha_regional_propose_the_socintern: "Propose the ComIntern"
 WRS_tukha_regional_propose_the_socintern_desc: "To create a Communist International Front Against Fascism that can oppose fascism across the globe, we must make formal overtures to the surviving socialist states. Once an alliance of proletarian states around the globe is formally established, we will be able to coordinate the struggle against fascism in an organised systematic manner. With central planning, the wrath of the workers and the wheels of history itself on our side, the fascists will be unable to stop the tide that will come for them."
 WRS_tukha_regional_oil_from_the_west: "Oil from the West"
 WRS_tukha_regional_oil_from_the_west_desc: "Although numerous tanks of oil were brought to Arkhangelsk during the great retreat northwards, our stocks are becoming more and more exhausted by the day. The Russian motherland is vast in oil stocks, particularly in West Siberia, but until we are able to expel the reactionaries and revisionists who are squatting in those territories, we cannot receive a drop of it. By trading for oil with our temporary ally the United States, the Front's industries will be able to be revived, increasing prosperity for its workers, and supplying the Red Army's war machines with the fuel they need to carry the flames of Revolution to the rest of our vast nation."
 WRS_tukha_regional_a_red_star_over_the_world: "A Red Star Over the World"
 WRS_tukha_regional_a_red_star_over_the_world_desc: "Many of our former allies have written back stating their interest in a Communist International Front against Fascism. To gather them together and formally draft a plan of action, the best course of action is to invite them all to a formal conference in Rykov to inaugurate the alliance's formation. Preparations for the first international socialist alliance will be heavy for be small city and must be made in advance: not only will the city need to plan a series of events to welcome the foreign delegates and accommodations must be made for them, but we will need to plan programs of discussion and debate for the best course of action when countering the threat of fascism worldwide."
 WRS_tukha_regional_a_global_union: "A Global Union"
 WRS_tukha_regional_a_global_union_desc: "Fascism is capitalism in decay, but that decay will make their inevitable collapse all the more easier. Around the world socialist nations and the workers who inhabit them have united around the anti-fascist cause. Bound together by the Communist International Front against Fascism and led by the indefatigable Marshal Tukhachevsky, the working class of Russia - and indeed, all the workers united by the Front's common socialist cause - will consign the fascist invaders who enslaved them into the ash-heap of history. The decisions for the next course of action to be taken are not yet made, but there is little doubt that the earlier we strike, the faster their demise shall be!"

 ### Zhukov regional tree descriptions ###
 WRS_zhukov_regional_the_new_soviet_era_desc: "Western Russia has now been united by the forces of our glorious Red Army, dismantling warlordism and crushing the enemies of the Soviet people. With these conquests the West Russian Revolutionary Front has gained control of much new territory, and can now truly claim to be a successor the legacy of the old Union. This increase in our prestige and power means that it is high time we begin to determine the future political direction of the Front, and usher in a great New Soviet Era guided by Grand Marshal Georgy Zhukov. Under his strong and erstwhile leadership, the Soviet Union will rise once more."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_restore_vkpb_membership_desc: "It is the Bolshevik All-Union Communist Party which took power in the October Revolution of 1917 and which formed the Soviet Union. Any attempt to reconstitute the Soviet Union must by necessity incorporate the party of Lenin and Bukharin. That is why we must take the first steps towards refounding the party by bringing its old members into our administration, in a limited capacity. The front is still a military regime under Grand Marshal Zhukov, but we must look to a future beyond Soviet reunification."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_emphasize_the_partys_status_desc: "When Lenin was still alive, the Bolshevik party was an internal democracy, in which every party member had a say and disagreements were handled in a comradely manner. The dictatorial rule of a single man was unthinkable. As was the idea of allowing the party to be swayed by backward layers in the general population. We would do well to revive these principles within the Front and the future party, ensuring that the voices of party members are put first."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_emphasize_the_peoples_role_desc: "In this age of warlordism and fascist insanity, we must remember the gains of October: universal suffrage, abolition of the classes, and power to the worker. It was always the intention of Lenin that the party should be the voice and sword of the people, and that the party should rule and lead on their behalf. While the military necessities of the Front make any ideas of democracy difficult, we would do good to remember what it is exactly we have been fighting for all these long years: the Soviet people."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_restore_the_administrative_divisions_desc: "Before our defeat in the West Russian War, the Front controlled great swathes of the territory across Western Russia. Now, our glorious Red Army has reclaimed much of this territory for us. Yet as it stands, our presence in these regions consists of little more than a military occupation, leaving the people without local government. In order to assert our control of these areas and consolidate the Front, it would be advisable for us to restore the old administrative divisions of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, reassuring the people that we have returned for good."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_maintain_military_precedence_desc: "While we have made great strides in recent years in our campaign to reunite the Soviet Union, we are far from the final day of victory. To the east lie a great many regions that still need to be brought to heel, and to the west lies the Nazi menace, our greatest foe. If the Front is ready for the military challenges to come, we will have to maintain strict military discipline and order. The Front is and must stay a strictly military organization, at least until our enemies have been vanquished once and for all. Any ideas about restating civilian governance will have to wait."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_encourage_the_state_meritocracy_desc: "Sadly the old West Russian Revolutionary Front was plagued by corruption and cronyism. With Grand Marshal Zhukov in command, we can begin to turn that around. From now on all appointments for military officers will be based on meritocratic principles, with no discrimination on the basis of background or nationality. This policy will ensure that our Red Army and the state as a whole are directed by loyal and competent men, and give all of our soldiers a sense that they too can rise in the ranks if they show enough initiative and grit."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_uplift_socialist_values_desc: "Prior to the arrival of the Red Army, many of the territories we now control were in the hands of Tsarists, Nazi collaborators, and other reactionaries. They have sadly spread their poisonous backward ideas amongst portions of the civilian population. We will have to put considerable resources into agitational propaganda to sway the people in these regions over to our cause, and instill in them an understanding of loyalty to socialist values. We are confident that with time, the people will remember the lessons of October."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_the_new_soviet_woman_desc: "It is Lenin who once said the women's section of the workers' army was of particular importance to the victory of the social revolution. Yet for too long the Soviet woman has suffered under the weight of domestic slavery and sexist chauvinism. The relegation of women to domestic duties and their exclusion from political and military life has been falsely excused in the past by the necessities of the war footing of the Front, but now there is no further justification for such a situation. Women must be granted full legal, social, and political equality, including the right to join the Red Army and fight alongside their male comrades."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_stress_soviet_egalitarianism_desc: "Many claim that the Front has a long way to go on women's rights, but such people forget the inherently feminist nature of our socialist system and the great gains that October won for Soviet women. The Soviet Union was one of the first countries in the world to grant women equal status to men in all legal matters, divorce upon request, and full rights to vote and participate in politics. Women continue to be equal in Soviet society today. We should not forget this as we fight to liberate women across the Russian warlord states."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_appeal_to_the_populace_desc: "We need to show the civilians in our newly occupied territories that we are different from the callous warlords and fascist fanatics who once ruled over them. The Front fights for the Soviet people, and cares deeply for their security and welfare. For this reason we must introduce increased pensions, ensuring that the old and infirm are not only protected physically from foreign threats by the Red Army, but also protected socially from the deprivations that they previously faced. Such measures will go a long way to appealing to the populace of Western Russia."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_rebuild_the_bureaucracy_desc: "The recent expansion of the West Russian Revolutionary Front has put severe strain on the state bureaucracy, with hundreds of administrators being sent out to govern our new territories. At our capital in [WRS.Capital.GetName] the central government is experiencing a severe manpower shortage. The situation has reached a level where our efforts to cement our control over Western Russia have been seriously hampered as a result. We need to rebuild the state bureaucracy from the ground up."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_liberalize_appointment_criteria_desc: "There are a great many men in our newly conquered territories who are former bureaucrats once embedded in the various warlord states. Despite many being associated with quite unsavoury regimes, such men could be of great value to our cause by helping us refill our depleted state bureaucracy. All of them will obviously have to be screened, and some excluded from possible employment, but the bulk will be of use. Under our guidance, they will learn to serve a new master: The Soviet people."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_escalate_dewarlordization_trials_desc: "Any and all proposals to rehabilitate the former warlords and their functionaries are preposterous. The Front must be the hammer which smashes Russian warlordism. Our justice must be swift and efficient, and forever put an end to such men. The de-warlordization trials already underway must be intensified and expanded, with all the former warlords and their worst apparatchiks put on trial and executed. Only then will the Soviet people know that we are serious about stamping out warlordism and reuniting our shattered union."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_legislate_minority_autonomy_desc: "One of the immense strengths of the old Soviet system was its emphasis on federalism and national self-determination. It is time to show the ethnic and national minorities in our territory that we are not Great Russian chauvinists who seek to rob them of their rights and liberties. We will establish the Bashkir and Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, winning the loyalties of the Bashkir and Tatar peoples and making it clear to all ethnic and national minorities that we are on their side."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_new_age_of_culture_desc: "Culture is not a field that the West Russian Revolutionary Front has had the luxury of being able to consider, but now that we have secured control over Western Russia, it is an issue we will be forced to address as people have more and more time to spend on leisure activities. Yet the government is faced with more questions than answers: What should be the approach to freedom of the press? Should art be free from censorship or reflect the needs of the Soviet state? Is experimental art a waste of time?"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_encourage_cultural_experimentalism_desc: "The early Soviet Union was the site of an explosion of artistic creativity borne from the liberatory spirit of October. It is time for us to revive that spirit, and usher in a new period of cultural experimentalism. The works of Vertov, Tatlin, and Kandinsky must be remembered and cherished. Creativity in literature, art, music, film, and more should all be pursued with vigor. Freedom of art and press should be re-established, even dissident press under state supervision and censorship. Such measures will fill the people with the knowledge that our Soviet state is a pioneer not just in politics, but in all other matters as well."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_enforce_proletarian_standards_desc: "In this period it is essential that we maintain the discipline and confidence of the Front, and the best way to do that is to regulate culture accordingly. All art, literature, film, and music should be tendentious, patriotic, socialist-minded, and generally optimistic. It should portray our Red Army soldiers as heroic and prefigure the future to come when we fully reunite the union and expel the Nazis from our land. Importantly, the press must remain fully in the hands of the state, with dissident media banned. Our people must be reassured of the righteousness of our cause, not distracted by crass artists and defeatist journalists."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_sponsor_cultural_development_desc: "All the great institutions of Soviet culture and arts were lost along with Moscow and Leningrad during the Great Patriotic War. If we are to revitalise socialist culture inside the borders of the Front, we will have to reconstitute such institutions and restore them to their former glory. New theatres, art academies, film studios, and universities will need to be built, and considerable resources put aside to encourage artistic and cultural projects. Only through such efforts can we kickstart our cultural development."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_uplift_the_young_bureaucrats_desc: "As the Red Army swept through the rebellious warlords of West Russia, many new and promising bureaucrats joined our government. It has been suggested that for their invaluable service to the revolution in those turbulent times, many of these so-called "Young Bureaucrats" are deserving of a promotion. Despite warnings from some within the current bureaucracy that these newcomers may be ideological deviants without an utmost devotion to the revolution, we have decided to authorise these promotions."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_lessons_from_the_old_union_desc: "When the great Lenin united Russia under the red banner, he had extended a hand of friendship to other socialist organisations such as the Menshevik Internationalists and Left SRs, only for them to attempt subversion after subversion of the revolutionary cause. In this same way, while the new bureaucrats may seem at first glance promising, the possibility of an internal threat arising from their promotion is too great. Thus, we will maintain the current centralised bureaucracy, for the safety of us all."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_pluralize_the_system_desc: "The Front is, to put it bluntly, terribly inefficient. The ideals of socialism are of course worth upholding, but pursuing them dogmatically while the Union crumbles around us would be a foolish endeavor. A new constitution, to be implemented upon the Front's dissolution, shall be drafted. This constitution shall guarantee democracy, a more stable and gradual path towards communism and, although opposed by some of the older bureaucrats, a limited amount of privatisation."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_cement_the_transition_desc: "While the chaotic era following the collapse of the Union necessitates a degree of authoritarianism, continuing such governance once immediate threats to the people have subsided would be both foolish and pointless. When the provisionary governance of the Front is dissolved and the new Union established, it shall be governed by a constitution, to be drafted immediately, upholding both liberty and socialism. After all, did Lenin not say that democracy is indispensable to socialism?"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_maintain_the_regime_desc: "The Front is a provisional government, this we all know, but the ideals it upholds need no alterations lest revisionary forces subvert what we have fought so hard to achieve. It is clear that once the front is dissolved, the Union must be governed by a new constitution, to be drafted immediately. As such, the new Soviet Constitution shall in essence continue the governance of the Front long after its dissolution. There is no need to change a system that has been proven to work."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_the_new_economic_policy_desc: "The failures of war communism are manifest: while the army is enriched, our people starve in the streets. While the State is bloated with economic planners trying to put the fires out, the sheer attrition of the system starts new infernos all the time. While the country burns, in other words, only a few benefit - and it is power, not prosperity, that this system creates.\n\nWe will be hypocrites no longer. With a limited expansion to free-market operation in our domains, our markets will not suffer from chronic shortages, and our people will be freed from chronic want. It is the way forward for Russia, and so too will it be our policy."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_educating_the_people_desc: "Public education drives everything - it hones the youth and prepares them for entry into the Proletarian workforce of tomorrow. It pushes men and women, the brightest of their generations, into education where they can impart their learning to those who can carry the torch. And in doing so, it improves the quality of our industry, research and all-round public life.\n\nWe must pivot to secondary and primary education, give our people knowledge of more than the rifle and the farming tool, and give our country a future worth fighting for."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_fund_the_sciences_desc: "The Sciences are the key not just to innovation in all fields of research - it is science that dictates how efficiently the tank or soldier moves and how much work can be done by a workers' brigade without stopping. It drives the tactics of our frontline troops, and it ignites our ties with the outside world as our research community links with the cream of the global intellectual crop.\n\nIf socialism is not driven by people of science, why bother calling it the Immortal Science at all? For this reason, and all the others listed above, we will invest heavily into research and development, and build a nation that looks ever into the future."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_generation_of_visionaries_desc: "We believe in the power of the masses, not the will of single men and women, to drive history onwards. Nevertheless, we would be foolish to deny that certain intelligent men and women are more capable of advancing the Revolution than others - and these people, these visionaries, deserve to be recognized, honed and pointed straight at the Front's enemies as our biggest intangible weapon.\n\nOf course, finding these talents will never be easy. We will have to overhaul our research talent recruitment system and our standardized testing entirely, and the ideological aspect gives our Recruitment Department headaches, but for the rebuilding of the Socialist Motherland? All sacrifices are worth our while."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_generation_of_workers_desc: "We must never neglect the source of our power - it would be even more foolish than a tank brigade ignoring the fuel on which it runs, for at least the fuel of tanks can be replaced. The trust of our workers, once gone, is almost impossible to replenish. Thankfully we are tracing the patterns of worker efficiency, and with innovations in organization and labor standards we are building an integrated industry-network that will truly stand with the best in Russia.\n\nWe are not ones to sit around being complacent, either: our old union structure, while moribund, can always be kicked into assistance in upgrading the skills of our factory workers..."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_the_end_of_war_communism_desc: "War communism was a tragic joke - it was a joke without a punchline, because its real butt was the collective welfare of the Russian people. We must now emphatically turn away from this mess of a policy, embracing the will of the free market to drive some of our production and demand - the workers' welfare must be enshrined, and with it the tenets of Bukharinism.\n\nWe will not pretend that this is not, in part, a political move designed to boost our legitimacy. Nor will we pretend that our leadership will take the credit. But this is socialism, after all, and if it works... nobody will think to complain in the history books."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_measured_transition_desc: "Just because we are emphatically rejecting something, of course, does not mean that we are to fly into the passionate embrace of a completely foreign economic system. Woe betide the foolish who believe otherwise! The Revolutionary Front will move slowly but surely into a new and tested system of production, one which we are certain will fill the ideological and economic needs of our people.\n\nOf course, this does give us significant control over the eventual shape of the Union, but that is all according to design, yes? Our Front is nothing without its leadership, and control is the better part of responsibility, after all."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_develop_rural_infrastructure_desc: "Our ruralities suffered grievous harm in the interwar years, as the ravages of the war broke the back of the countryside. We will take measures to overcome this error by integrating them into the glorious new system we have designed - one that runs goods from the heart of the city to the ends of our domain in days, if not hours.\n\nWith this integration will come political control, of course, and there will be opportunities to enforce previously lax adherence to socialist principles - but freedom is not truly free unless it is socialist, after all. In time, the rural world will come to understand this."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_expand_the_oil_industry_desc: "An army marches on its stomach. But it can march further and through much more if it has oil.\n\nOil is the lifeblood of our army, and is what will grant us victory. Our mechanized military demands it for Tanks, trucks, and aircraft. Our economy needs it for trains and trucks to bring supplies and materials to where they need to go, and to power the factories of Russia. And we must provide it with as much as we can get."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_the_wealth_of_the_motherland_desc: "Vast timberfields in every direction. Acres upon acres of farmland. Enormous wealth hidden just below the surface. The Rodina is vast, and so are her resources. And the people of the Union shall use as many of these gifts as they can to free themselves from the Nazi menace, and to return her land to the toilers that live off of it."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_arrange_agricultural_mechanization_desc: "In many places, Russian farms are still worked by mules and horses hooked up to wooden plows. What modern agricultural practices that existed either never were implemented or discontinued due to a lack of equipment. That simply won't do at all. We will not suffer another hungry winter! Our farmers will have tractors, modern plows, and fertilizers to work beside them. We will see full storehouses and silos as an obvious result."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_increase_agricultural_subsidies_desc: "One may attempt to seize the grain from the farmer when it is not enough, but who would that serve? Neither the city worker, nor the peasant shall suffer the misery of hunger in our Union. We will give the farmers the funding they need, and we only ask for one thing in return: more food. Do whatever you have to, but give us more bushels!"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_reinstate_the_prodrazvyorstka_desc: "Everything is backwards. Farmers hoard grain while the people in the city starve. Crop yields are not enough on their own. It is hard, but we must take action for the good of our citizenry.\n\nOur troops will seize the hoarded grain, and give the farmers a fixed payment in return. We will try to redistribute what we can in an equal manner, to ensure that everyone can get what they are entitled to in an equal share."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_begin_the_redistribution_desc: "We have not inherited an egalitarian paradise. We have instead conquered a land that has abandoned its pretenses of equal wealth and disdain for private property. We see again a system of unequals, where a few have hoarded wealth while the great masses struggle. We fix that now. Property redistribution will begin again. And this time, everyone will really end up with what they deserve."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_return_to_bukharin_desc: "Our hatred of Bukharin's military policies is well documented. One may never forget that. But his economic policies? Those are hard to criticize from our perspective. One might even call them admirable. And we will continue with them. The Union will continue along this path, adopting the plans he set out to fulfill, and fulfilling the wonders that he had envisioned."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_policy_of_foreign_investment_desc: "Before the Great Patriotic War the Soviet government was hostile to foreign investment, believing that it was a foot in the door for foreign capitalist powers hostile to the socialist aims of our country. Now perhaps it is time for a change in perspective. Due to our shared hostility with the Nazis, we are on relatively good terms with capitalist countries like the United States. It may be immensely beneficial for our industry to allow some limited level of foreign investment from such countries. They will of course have to be kept under a close eye, but this is a small price to pay for the economic benefits foreign investment will bring."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_prioritize_developmental_industry_desc: "If we are to turn our Soviet motherland into an industrial powerhouse, we must focus on a developmental approach, implementing the most technologically advanced and modern techniques and methods to build a strong and efficient economic system. It is not enough to just build huge industrial centres in our cities. We must think about ways to raise the economic level of the entire country, increasing the number of workers, the diversity of industry, and its commensurate efficiency. This will ensure our long-term economic prosperity."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_develop_the_industrial_core_desc: "Even after attempts to expand Soviet industry under Bukharin, our industrial strength remained pitiful. Worse yet, most of primary industrial centres have now been lost behind the Nazi iron curtain. If we are to make our Soviet motherland strong again we need to invest heavily in the development of our core industry, prioritizing the construction of basic industrial goods in our main urban industrial centres. Only after we have built a solid industrial base can we begin to think about employing more modern industrial techniques across the country. This effort is essential not only to the economic future of the country, but also to our future security needs."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_western_sibplan_desc: "All agree that the Bukharinite administration did do one thing right in the economic sphere: The Siberian Plan. The building up of industry far from the German border in Siberia in preparation for the Great Patriotic War failed to win us the war, but it did show the possibilities of massive government effort towards industrialization. It is a legacy that we should seek to emulate. We will copy the plan and implement a version of it here in West Russia, expanding our civilian manufacturing, infrastructure, and military industry. Hopefully it leaves us better prepared to face the Germans than its predecessor did."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_recenter_the_policy_desc: "We must not lose ourselves in nostalgia for Bukharin's Soviet Union. His market reforms were ultimately a failure that helped result in our woeful unpreparedness to face the Germans in Operation Barbarossa. Rather than return to the old schemas, we must pursue a new policy of development based on a unique understanding of our Soviet economy, centering the needs of the Soviet people and principles of socialist workplace democracy. As Lenin himself always intended, workers organizations such as cooperatives and the Soviet workers councils themselves must be at the heart of our economic policy."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_expand_the_production_bureau_desc: "Lenin once said that Communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the entire country. He was wrong. Communism is Soviet power plus motorization of the entire country. Our nation is vast, and as a result our transport needs are seemingly endless. We must once again connect up the country by investing heavily in motorization, expanding our vehicle factories and investing in the creation of new modern vehicle models on par with those seen in other countries. One day soon the whole country will hum to the sound of a car engine."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_soviet_oriented_development_desc: "We must never forget the basis and origin of our Soviet workers' state: The soviets, the workers' councils that brought down the Tsar and the Whites. As a result of the Russian Civil War, the Great Patriotic War, and then the long years of Warlordism, the Soviets have been either destroyed by the forces of reaction or turned into rump bodies with no real power. It is time for us to turn this situation around by encouraging the re-establishment and revival of Soviet's inside our territory. Their first task must be to implement poverty relief programs aimed at raising up the Soviet population from deprivation. Only with a full stomach and a roof over his head can a worker fully contribute to our great socialist society."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_the_proud_red_army_desc: "Many dismissed the Red Army as a failure. That it had dissolved after the German invasion. When we threw the Germans back from the A-A line, the world was stunned, but dismissed us again afterwards. Now, we have restored the front and move to take Russia once again. If the world doubts us, they do so at their own peril, for we are men of iron, born to fight, survive, and never ever admit defeat!"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_high_moral_standards_desc: "Our forces are not a temporary militia gathered to ward off the bandits at harvest time. We aren't the bandits either, living by pillage and thievery. And we aren't some warlord's hired thugs and murderers. We are the Red Army, the ones to liberate the oppressed masses of the earth, and the only proper military Russia has around here. So you better act like it, soldier!"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_stain_on_the_uniform_desc: "Tukhachevsky and his clique have been constantly going behind Marshal Zhukov's back, and occasionally trying to stab him in it. This is unbecoming of a professional soldier in the Red Army, especially ones with such high ranks as him and his men hold. They are a disgrace and a stain upon the uniform, and one knows what must be done with stains. These traitors will be removed from service."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_industrial_lynchpins_desc: "There are certain areas in our lands that have high concentrations of population and natural resources. It is only natural that we should take advantage of these locations to build our industrial facilities. Much like we once built Magnitogorsk to be our Gary, Indiana, we will build up these towns to be our Detroits, our Manchesters, and our Pittsburghs."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_learn_from_the_unification_wars_desc: "The battle for the western front required great skill and adaptation from the Red Army. Our forces had to fight in both farmland and great cities. To ford raging rivers, and cross enormous hills. To march through open fields, and to fight in dense forests. We must impart the lessons, tactics, and best practices in these areas to the entire army, so we won't have to learn these skills all over again."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_quality_over_quantity_desc: "We are going to have the best army in the world. It will have the best equipment, the best arms, and the best vehicles. It is also going to be highly discriminatory about who is going to be a soldier in the Red Army. Having a large military is good, but there are many people in Russia who simply are not capable of making the cut. We want the best army, and that doesn't mean the largest one."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_efficient_supply_lines_desc: "Lack of supplies doomed our army back in the Great Patriotic War. It also doomed our forces in the West Russian War. It will not doom us again. For we will have an intricate group of supply depots and routes to ensure our forces, wherever they are, can get the ammunition and food they need to keep doing what they do best."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_strategic_theorem_doctrine_desc: "Grand Marshal Zhukov has had enough with the instability and lack of a chain of command that has plagued the front. It's time that the rules are laid down. There's one leader, and he's the man with the title of "Grand Marshal", understand? And everyone else does what he says. It's pretty sensible, and everyone should do that."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_marching_on_desc: "We have done it. After many years and hard fought battles, we have secured the west of Russia and the entire front against Germany. But Moscow isn't our next target, at least not yet. We will march east now to restore the former Union. Then the Red Army will double back to face the Germans once more."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_rolling_on_desc: "We need better armor. To fight off the various warlords of the east, and to compete with the Germans in the west. All our efforts must go into researching new designs. And if we can't build them ourselves, we'll go out and buy them instead."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_job_done_properly_desc: "Everything in the Red Army must be done quickly, and with the least amount of effort. There are a million things to do, and we must do them all fast with the resources we have. We expect all of our men to uphold this ideal."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_heroes_of_socialism_desc: "Many great deeds have been done by the forces of the Red Army for the people of Russia. We must remember these heroes, and what they have done. Their battles against the oppressors of Russia must always be remembered. And their stories shall motivate and inspire the army and the people."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_the_army_of_the_people_desc: "The Red Army is not a militarized arm of the VKP(b) as some will say. For when the system failed, who saved the people of Northwestern Russia from chaos and disaster? Who gave the Hitlerites a tremendous lashing during the West Russian War? And who delivered the people of West Russia from bandits and warlords? The Red Army fights for the people of Russia, and it will continue to do so until the red flag flies from Klaipėda to Cape Dezhnev!"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_looking_outwards_desc: "With West Russia under the Red Army's wardship once more, we have now reentered the world stage as an actor among equals. This comes with renewed attention from enemies and allies both old and new; consequentially, we invite unto ourselves great risks, great rewards, and great opportunities in equal measure.\n\nStavka will not dally in keeping away the first, inviting in the second, and seizing the third. We begin these three tasks by first answering an age-old dilemma: should the Front restore its old ties with the West's sleeping giant? Or should it forge its own path among our fellow socialists to the East?"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_eyes_to_the_west_desc: "The United States of America has been a loyal patron of the Red Army since the Great Patriotic War. Not one to waste chances to spite the Reich's fascists, its material support - food, equipment, and medicine aplenty - continued past the Akagi Accords and into the West Russian War. Formally hailing Washington with our diplomats will signal to them that the Red Army is ready and willing to continue the relationship cut short by Suvorov."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_send_yakovlev_desc: "For the first envoys Russia will send to the Western Hemisphere in decades, garnering impressive first impressions is a necessity impelled by the Front's needs. In this our entourage will be aided immensely by Alexander Yakovlev and (to a lesser extent) Sergey Akhromeyev, both fervent advocates of welcoming America back to Arkhangelsk even in the days of Yegorov. If nothing else, Comrade Yakovlev's rhetoric converges surprisingly well with the Americans'; his words will surely resonate among their politicians and mediamen."
 WRS_SENT_YAKOVLEV: "We have sought to improve our relations with the West."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_meet_in_washington_desc: "Diplomatic etiquette, medal-bedecked uniforms, and rudimentary English - whatever we could prepare Comrade Yakovlev's entourage with, they already have. Their ship will depart Arkhangelsk for New York City, and thence to Washington, D.C. within the coming weeks.\n\nYakovlev was keen to reassure the Grand Marshal that he will return with dignified gifts from the Coca-Cola Company. Yes, Comrade Zhukov, and the fishing tackles Mr. Eisenhower promised, too."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_establish_a_consolate_desc: "By and large, Yakovlev's visit was a success. President [USA.GetPresidentLastName] and his associates heartily welcomed the Red Army's officers to speak before their Congress for the first time. The speech Yakovlev gave to America's assembled statesmen, his companions said, dominated the country's newspapers and televisions for days.\n\nit was in this revelrous fugue where the President invited our ambassador to the old Soviet Consulate, which [USA.GetSheHe] offered to us in perpetuity. Let's not look at gift horses in the mouth - or in this case, gift buildings in their facade."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_appeal_for_recognition_desc: "When the Union fell to Barbarossa, her soldiers regrouped in an orderly fashion. When Russia fell to warlordism, her generals kept order for as long as they were able. And when the Reich was crippled by the fruits of their arrogance, her beloved Red Army struck a blow from which Germania never recovered.\n\nWe are the Motherland's mighty bulwark - one and all, oathsworn inheritors of a thousand-year watch against her old nemeses to the West. For her sake, the Americans must be reminded of that fact."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_western_investments_desc: "The region's new peace has allowed the Front latitude in developing its war-torn lands to their old potential. As farmers reap fallow fields anew and workers return to dilapidated assembly lines, so too does money return to the countrysides and cities both - first in trickles, then in gently-flowing streams.\n\nOur new friends in the American economy may be interested in helping the Stavka turn these trickles into streams, and perhaps then into torrents."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_tapping_the_market_desc: "West Russia has resources aplenty: chromium and tungsten from Rykov, steel from Volgoda and Tatarstan, and more. That other countries hunger for raw materials such as ours is not in question among Stavka, only the extent to which they shall have their fill from us. The Grand Marshal has been swayed towards giving the wider world trickles of West Russia's bounty - and thus open another source of dearly needed revenue - rather than forbidding them outright."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_apply_for_ofn_aid_desc: "Through our actions, the West Russian Revolutionary Front has regained its old standing with the United States. Western ships dock at Arkhangelsk and leave with Russian ores, just as they had before the Great Patriotic War. American generals appraise our troops with approving eyes. By the day, their diplomats regard our ambassadors less as the Red Army's - but as that of the Soviet Union come again.\n\nComrade Yakovlev's prescience has borne the Front fruit: now, more than ever, we can revive the mighty convoys that had delivered hope to our men with their every visit."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_eyes_straight_ahead_desc: "America and the capitalist West lie distant, many thousand miles away from the Front. Meanwhile, the heirs to Comrades Lenin and Marx, if not old Bukharin, lie east and south of the Ural Mountains waging the same struggles as we - fighting for the same cause as we. It is folly to ignore true allies that await ahead by pining ceaselessly for an old flame.\n\nWhen all is said and done, the world will remember that the Red Army is the international proletariat's to wield."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_send_ryzkhov_desc: "In the Grand Marshal's clique, Nikolay Ryzhkov has drowned other voices in his support of our fellow socialists within the old Union's borders and abroad. His passion for the dream of united workers' struggle appealed to many who saw beyond the Urals, focusing on supporting our fellow Soviets, rather than treating them as impediments to the Red Army's war machine. We will be well served by sending him on diplomatic tours to nations that might just share his internationalist bent with the right words."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_against_the_german_giant_desc: "Socialism defines itself by wresting liberation from an oppressive order, oftentimes through violent means. This order suborned many ideas - capitalism, imperialism, colonialism - into its all-encompassing corpus in the hundred years since Karl Marx penned his Manifesto. Today its newest and most destructive addition is the German Reich's fascism: a plague that had left a continent with deep-rooted rot, and swathed our own lands with its shadow's darkness.\n\nThey are our enemy above all else, at least for now."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_memories_of_fire_desc: "Once upon a time, the Red Army burned with enough vigor to almost shatter the Reich's vaunted armies. Rifleman to general, every soldier seemed possessed by an ancient flame when Suvorov struck the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line. They flicked and lapped and grew from victory to victory until they coalesced into a great red inferno come to burn swathes of Germany into cinders.\n\nThese flames were snuffed out at the Front's most critical moment. But soon, very soon, they will ignite a second time."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_a_nod_to_the_empire_desc: "Inveterate capitalists they may be, but the United States were twice our allies against the fascist menace. No longer a third time, now that we plan on having our own set of allies - but what precludes two alliances from bonding over sharing the same hated foe?"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_approach_socialist_governments_desc: "The international struggle cannot come to fruition without direct action, from us or from others. The Front is in a position to bring it about ourselves, said Ryzhkov. Perhaps he is right?"
 WRS_zhukov_regional_international_socialist_solidarity_desc: "We sounded the call, and the world answered - from Cuba to Indochina, from Norway's fjords to the Strait of Magellan. Parties, governments and revolutionaries alike heard the Front's pleas; would if they can lend support to fellow comrades at this time. But it is a start."
 WRS_zhukov_regional_the_rykov_conference_desc: "Today, Rykov is dressed in the finest reds the Front has scrounged. The banners of revolution hang from windowsills and flutter high atop flagpoles set up on every other street corner. The Red Army parades through its winding streets, marching in lockstep with bands' martial drums. Foreign faces disembark from the piers, impressed by how far the city has gone from the trickling tales that had left Russia.\n\nA fine headquarters as any for the revolution's next step: the Communist International."

 WRS_tukha_superregional_dissolve_the_front_desc: "Comrades! Today is the day and now is the hour! With most of Russia back under our heel, it would be inappropriate to continue the national reclamation as a 'front'. We are a Socialist Republic, heirs to the Soviet Union and its legacy. Although the armed forces are at the core of the revolution, we must also consider the workers themselves. A Soviet Republic shall better represent them (at least officially) than a military with a state. Naturally, we shall keep existing organizations running and Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky in power. It is he who has dragged the Red Army from its icy grave, it is he to whom the future belongs.\n\nLong live Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky! Long live the Revolution! Long live the Soviet Union!"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_the_new_territories: "The New Territores"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_the_new_territories_desc: "The last war saw our territory nearly doubled. While acquisition of critical areas like Zlatoust and Omsk has greatly benefited our industry, everything past the Urals is in a poor state. Bandits roam the countryside, partisans loyal to dead ideologies still linger in the forests, and anti-revolutionary elements plot within cities.\n\nGrand Marshal Tukhachevsky wishes to pass an edict for the expansion of all military units, specifically commissars. Every municipality will be given a detachment of military police, dissidents shall be rallied and shot, wrongdoers will receive no quarter. Loyal bureaucrats also need to be installed into central positions to help smoothen the rebuilding of Russia."
 WRS_tukha_superregional_integrate_their_armies: "Integrate Their Armies"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_integrate_their_armies_desc: "The Revolution only desires the strong. Defeated armies beyond the Urals consist primarily of bandits, aging officers, and non-socialist elements. Nonetheless, the Stavka recognizes our dire need for men in the frontlines, and has authorized early conscription programs. 'Auxiliary' detachments must be drafted, consisting only of fresh blood, to be under constant watch by senior officers. These brigades will primarily serve non-combat roles, such as cooks, engineers, and drivers.\n\nAnother issue is the lack of discipline among the new soldiers. The old guard exemplifies diligence, loyalty, spartan discipline! Recruits who wish to fill combat roles will need to pass a test of fire, which may prove fatal for some. However, those that endure will be truly prepared for the slaughter ahead."
 WRS_tukha_superregional_enforce_discipline: "Enforce Discipline"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_enforce_discipline_desc: "Reports confirm that recruits do not yet understand the meaning behind war. We do not fight for material wealth, or glory for that matter. We fight for the Revolution, from the lowest cadet to the highest marshal, everyone is expected to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. The men beyond the Urals are unruly, they drink and report late. Examples need to be made.\n\nThe Grand Marshal has authorized corporal punishment against those who violate the core tenants of the Red Army, or have a poor record by their commanding officer. In cases of desertion or betrayal, the subject will be terminated on sight. In case of great defeat, limited use of decimation has been permitted."
 WRS_tukha_superregional_enforce_standardization: "Enforce Standardization"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_enforce_standardization_desc: "The individual soldier is of stout spirit and able body - but that is not enough. If we are to succeed, the men will have to learn to work together. The age of the warlords taught a bad lesson - that it is possible to persevere alone. We are a Union, there is no room for individual glory! The next war will be won with grand strategy, organization must be prioritized above all. Doctrines based on the teachings of the Grand Marshal will be taught to all officers, the Stavka itself needs rebalancing along modern lines. Siberia can wait for a few weeks more - when we conquer, the people of Russia shall see the Red Army in all its splendor - marching in rows, like toy soldiers under Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky against the enemies of the Revolution!"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_a_glorious_legacy: "A Glorious Legacy"
 WRS_tukha_superregional_a_glorious_legacy_desc: "Once, long ago, the Red Army achieved the impossible: it defeated an Empire spanning two continents, fielding millions of soldiers, all done with the help of superior Soviet will. The Grand Marshal evokes this past - the defeats of the last three decades must be erased from the record - the Red Army does not lose, it makes strategic withdrawals. Let fly the Red Banner above the heads of millions of soldiers, ready for the meat grinder, their cause is just, backed up by decades of history, the years of pride. Only once all of Russia is liberated will we allow ourselves a single day to celebrate - after that, the world shall turn crimson and we will be at the gates of Berlin!"

So long Zapadnorusskiy Revolyutsionnyy Front, and welcome back, Vsesoyuznaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya!\n\nA centralized political organization run from a central Presidium, the new VKP will accept only the finest members of society and revolutionary heroes in its ranks.

Nobody expects the USSR to be ready now, with a few primitive farms, dirt roads, and bombed out factories to make up an economy. But Russia must be ready. And ready it shall be.\n\nThe economic programs that brought us bountiful success up in the north will be expanded and implemented in the south as well.

 WRS_tukha_superregional_against_bourgeois_decadence_desc: "Nobody needs frivolities in daily life, especially if one lives in a socialist society like we do. One has to ask themselves, do I really need this? Can I use something else? Can I manage with less? And can I live a more humble life if my country calls for it? Every Russian must ask themselves these questions about every object. And we must ask if our regained foreign supply routes can bring us more useful iterations of the object.\n\nFurs must clothe the soldiers. Silk stockings must become parachutes. Pots and pans can make tanks and airplanes. Paper can make shell containers. And rubber can make tires for our trucks.

Everyone of note has at least some degree of experience in the Red Army, as it should be. For how can one lead a revolution if they are inexperienced with fighting. Unfortunately, the government requires far more people than there are commissioned officers. And not everyone can prove their loyalty to the Soviet Union on the field of battle.\n\nA civilian candidate for a civil service position must be trained and loyal. They must know The Communist Manifesto, What Is To Be Done, and The Red Army and the Militia. They must be proven to be loyal to the cause in all ways, and have impeccable records. Only then will they be fit to take a paper, stamp it, and put it in a stack."

A group of reactionary peasants, their heads filled with lies by the deceitful church, rebelled against the Soviet Union. They crucified our soldiers and killed their families. He responded with tanks, artillery, and chlorine gas to eliminate them. It was dirty work, and took more than a few executions, but the countryside was pacified.

It is not enough to have a strong military, says Tukhachevsky. It must have a strong and organized civilian front to march beside it. Their solution was the VKP. The Communist Party will educate the peoples of Russia of the need to liberate the world from the clutches of Nazism, and the forgotten glory of socialism.

Fortunately, the far-sighted Comrade Tukhachevsky has accepted this eventuality and has even gone so far as to decide on a successor in the event of his death.

 WRS_zhukov_superregional_the_peoples_economy_desc: "In the years of warlordism since the West Russian War, we have prioritized military production to the detriment of the living standards and conditions of both the industrial proletariat and the population as a whole. While we still need to prepare for the coming war against the Nazis, we no longer need to engage in military spartanism. The Soviet economy exists to serve the Soviet people!

 WRS_zhukov_superregional_renewed_soviet_patriotism_desc: "During the long years of warlordism, many of our people lost a sense of Soviet patriotism, either feeling abandoned by our Red Army for leaving them to the warlords, falsely believing that our Soviet motherland was dead once and for all, or being swayed by the crass fascist nationalism of the Tsarists and Nazis. It is time for us to once again instill in the people a love for our great Soviet Union. We shall renew our lost patriotism, and remind the people of what they have forgotten: Our Soviet Union is mighty, and soon will march to crush the Nazi opressors!"
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_break_the_earth_desc: "The life of the farmer in our Russian motherland is hard and unforgiving. The cold, infertile soil yields little even to the most tenacious of planters. Before the Great Patriotic War we had access to the breadbasket of Ukraine, and since its loss our people have often faced deprivation and hunger. We are forced to make do with what we have. If we are to once again fully feed our people and our armies we must break the earth, invest in new agricultural tools and practices, and find ways to improve the fertility of our soil."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_ready_the_nation_desc: "The time approaches for the final confrontation with the Nazis, the last great struggle for liberation, the sacred war for the heart and soul of Russia, and we must ready the nation to face it. The last Soviet territory outside our control must be taken by our Red Army, which will march all the way to the Pacific Ocean. Then, they will have to march west, and face the great enemy head on. If the Soviet people stand united and do their duty to the motherland and the great cause of socialism, we cannot falter! Come comrades, Moscow and Leningrad await!"
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_looking_to_history_desc: "We stand in the tradition of Red October, the greatest social revolution in the history of humanity, which liberated millions from oppression and forged our great Soviet state. Yet we must also face the reality that the lofty ideals of Marx and Lenin nearly died in the fires of the Great Patriotic War, with our revolution unable to resist the diabolical Nazi war machine. We must learn from our triumphs and our defeats, and forge a new path. From the ashes of past defeats, a new Soviet Union will rise, wreathed in the ideals of October, but ready to face our enemies, sword in hand!"
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_the_american_example_desc: "Before the Great Patriotic War, the American and Soviet peoples stood at odds, with many Americans afraid of our socialist system of government. Yet during the Great Patriotic War and ever since, our interests have been aligned. Today the Americans have much to show us from their impressive military and industry. we should seek to emulate their example, and should not let our political differences define us. After all, our Soviet state was born in the fires of a great revolution, but so was that of the Americans. Perhaps we aren't so different after all."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_our_soviet_lineage_desc: "We must remember our Soviet lineage and the ideals passed down by the Bolsheviks, the principal of which was proletarian internationalism. We must never forget that the struggle we wage is an international one, fought in every country and every front for the emancipation of working people everywhere. The Communist International, the fourth of its kind, is the vehicle of world revolution and an international front against the Nazis and their accomplices. Yet the other members of the ComIntern do not have the advantages of our great industry and military. We must prepare them for the great struggle to come."
 WRS_SENT_RHYZKOV: "We have sought to improve our relations with other socialist nations."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_the_peoples_executive_desc: "The Soviet system of government was always intended to be a workers' democracy in which the people had the ultimate say, but the exigencies of our seemingly endless conflicts with domestic enemies and foreign fascist armies made that dream impossible. Yet now workers' democracy is slowly returning to our nation, and we must believe in the power of the Soviet people to choose their own future. The Supreme Soviet must be restored, and along with it the Presidium, so that the highest levels of state are once more in the hands of the people."
 WRS_RESTORED_PARTY: "VKP(b) memberships have been restored."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_delegate_the_powers_desc: "Despite the democratization of our political system, the Soviet government is still overwhelmingly dominated by military men. This made sense when the Red Army needed to maintain strict military discipline in its campaign against the warlords, but now our needs are different. It is time for soldiers and generals to focus on purely military matters, and leave the administration of the state to civilians. Power must be delegated to civilians and out of the hands of the military while military and civic institutions must be fully disentangled."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_the_peoples_general_desc: "We must never forget that our greatest enemy, the Nazi war machine, lies in wait just across our Western border. To lessen the power of the army under such circumstances would be extremely premature, and besides, there is little to fear from further military administration. The Red Army is the sword and shield of the Soviet masses, and knows best how to serve the people and the nation. Rule by our glorious Red Army got us through the long years of warlordism, and it will get us through the wars to come."
 WRS_MAINTAINED_MILITARY: "The Military is still dominant."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_reshuffle_committee_assignments_desc: "What need does the Red Army have for civilians at the highest levels of government? Such people will only make matters more difficult, particularly in the great war to come. No, administration must be consolidated fully in the hands of the military officers and generals, including within the Presidium. Perhaps, some day in the future when all of former Soviet Union is once again reunited and the Nazis have been vanquished, the military can step down, but for now the Soviet nation must be an armed camp, with the Red Army taking the lead."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_refound_the_vkpb_desc: "The Front was always a strictly military organization, and had little place for party organization within its ranks. Yet now, with the reunification of Russia, the people clamour for political education and guidance. It is time for us to reforge the party of Lenin! Embodying the revolutionary spirit of the October Revolution, the All-Union Communist Party will be the vanguard of the working class, charting the political course of the union and organizing the masses for the struggle against the sacred enemies of the Soviet Union."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_look_towards_war_desc: "The sacred and final war to liberate our Soviet motherland approaches. Everyone knows it. Nobody can escape from the truth of what is to come. The last time we faced the Germans, we faltered, and lost all but our lives. But this time we will not falter. We will be ready, every one of our soldiers armed, prepared, and willing to sacrifice their lives in the struggle for liberation. We will make the Nazi dogs pay for every humiliation, every martyr, ever inch of our soil that they have watered with the blood of our people. We will drive out the fascist dogs once and for all, no matter the cost. Such is our destiny."
 WRS_zhukov_superregional_krasnaya_armiya_vseh_silney_desc: "The Germans invaded our motherland, but we fought on. They massacred our people, but we resisted. They bombed our remaining cities to oblivion, but we survived. After everything they have done to us we are still here, the Red Army, the last soldiers of the socialist cause in a world overrun by fascist tyranny. Every blow they have landed against us has only made us stronger, and now we stand before the world, having reunited our fractured nation, unbowed and triumphant! Let the world hear us!\n\nWe are the Red Army, the last hope of humanity! We will plant the red flag on Moscow, then Leningrad, then Germania itself! We will bring their wretched Nazi order to the ground and show them once and for all;\n\n§eTHE RED ARMY IS THE STRONGEST!§!"

 indrik.11.t: "OBT Program - SUCCESS"
 indrik.11.d: "Dmitri sighed as he looked at his clipboard, he still had to do another three tests before the designers would take another look at the T-64. He was nearly about to fall asleep before the siren cackled to life signaling another test run to occur. Dmitri slumped over even more in his chair, hoping that it would end already.\n\nAfar from the testing grounds, in Murmansk, Alexander Morozov slaved over his blueprints and documents on his desk. A message from Komi had come in from the testing facility that the T-64, what was supposed to be the Front's newest tank, had constant engine issues. Oil leakage was constant from the main chassis. The chassis as well had to be scrapped and started over nearly four times at this point. Occasionally Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky would arrive at the manufacturing faculty to examine the blueprints and other plans. He would offer sage advice to the designers, asking about "more armor" or "a longer gun". The designers would always go along with this, making adjustments to make sure that the Grand Marshal saw them doing good work. Just as Morozov was about to send a message back to Komi on how to fix the engine, another one had come in. The suspension system was having issues. Again.\n\nAs the onsite technicians began to receive Morozov's instructions to repair the systems in the tank, the Grand Marshal himself arrived to take in the trials of the T-64. As he toured the facility, he walked past the tank. Asking if it always broke down, the site leader shrugged and mumbled a reply before the men moved on.\n\nHowever, as Tukhachevsky walked back around to the testing field, the tank seemed to be moving once again. Dmitri was scribbling down results as fast as he could, for once there seemed to be no issues with it. He breathed a sigh of relief and radioed to Morozov:"
 indrik.11.a: ""It seems the tank works, Mozorov.""

 indrik.12.t: "OBT Program - PARTIAL SUCCESS"
 indrik.12.d: "Maravoz pinched the bridge of his nose as he looked at his notes. While jumbled they all spelt out the same issue, well three of them. Transmission, suspension and turret. While all three had been designed to be of the utmost quality, they had been a pain in the ass for the technicians and Maravoz himself. Hours and hours had been spent on an issue for four more to pop up in its place.\n\nAs Maravoz wrote down his final notes for the night, he noticed something on the blueprint for the T-64, the transmission itself had faulty measurements. He whistled at his own incompetence before making some more adjustments to it. With the main adjustment being to swap out the type of gears being used in the transmission itself. He smiled and packed up his notes before leaving his office and heading home for the night.\n\nAt the factory in Murmansk, Alexi couldn't be more annoyed. They had been producing the same transmission for weeks at this point and had just been notified that all of the ones they had produced had to be either scrapped or pulled out of the chassis to be replaced with the newer ones. However not all was doom and gloom. After weeks of attempting to learn how to mitigate the issue of a four man crew, it was finally solved after the designers decided to install an automatic loader for its main cannon. Due to these changes, the weight was cut down along with the size making it all the more maneuverable and ready for the continuation of the Great Patriotic War.\n\nWeeks later during trials, Dmriti had been walking around the T-64, to make sure that it was all set for its final inspection and approval. Before he marked it down as ready, he noticed the suspension being ruptured a bit from the course. When he brought this up to the tanker crew, they waved it off. One of them replied saying they would never face a battlefield like this. So he shrugged and marked it as ready, hoping this statement was true."

 indrik.21.d: "Markov grumbled as he looked down the assembly line. While he had been receiving decent pay, all he did was stand near a conveyor belt and pick up one of the thousands of bullets that flowed through every hour or so. The job was seen as monotonous to him, just the same thing everyday. However today was different and marked a new day for the Front.\n\nAs he picked up a bullet and looked at it more closely, he noticed that the case was much smaller. He shook his head, thinking he was confused. But after seeing even more of the one he had in his hand flow down the vault, the more he was convinced to bring it to his supervisor. He walked to his office, he noticed other workers taking the bullets they had made for the past three years and shoveling them into buckets. Markov knew enough about the Red Army that they used the older types of bullets in their service rifle, the AKM, which was manufactured by both Zlatoust and Front factories.\n\nAs he walked up to the office, he noticed that his supervisor was holding an AKM in his hands. Markov was startled a little bit. What was his supervisor doing with the rifle in his hands the worker thought. After contemplating this, he decided to enter the room. The supervisor handed him the rifle and asked him if he noticed anything different. Markov replied saying that it looked normal. The supervisor laughed and took it back. He said to the worker that it was chambered in the new bullet type, 5.66x39 millimeter. Makrov frowned for a moment, confused. The supervisor smiled again and then asked the worker to follow him. Markov nodded and followed the supervisor down to a makeshift range where the supervisor hit all of the targets with stunning precision. Markov nodded to the other workers who were around then. The supervisor then said that it was chambered in the bullet type, first manufactured here in Izhevsk. Markov smiled and realized that he himself was the first to touch one of the many bullets that the Red Army would use to take back Moscow."

 indrik.22.d: "Joseph frowned as he hit his rifle for what felt like the eighth time today. He was one of the soldiers selected to partake in the new weapon trials. From what he heard, the Grand Marshal had ordered a whole new type of ammunition to be researched and developed for the upcoming battles against the German Reich in Moscow. While it gave him great honor, it also took lots of time to prepare. He had to wake up at four in the morning to prepare for the day ahead of him, including cleaning his rifle and the past days uniform.\n\nAs he jogged up to his station, he looked at the box of ammunition next to him. It was nearly overflowing with 5.56x39 millimeter, the newest type of Soviet ammunition. While they had the privilege of having the ammo arrive already boxed, they had to load it into the magazines. This was the most annoying part of the assignment he thought. While he knew there were people in the Front who had to do worse tasks, he thought this could be worse. Some of the other men he worked with had decided to load their ammunition into magazines before they would go to bed with the leftovers. Some of the other men decided to load all of the ammunition into the magazines first before anything.\n\nAlong with him just firing the rifle, he needed to always write down his thoughts and the results of each magazine of ammunition. As the hours went by, he wrote down even more and more. After lunch he looked at his notebook. Fifteen pages had been filled with his notes and results of each magazine. So far he had twelve jams, and two whole magazines he had to clear the cartridge out of before reloading it once again.\n\nAs he was writing down his last notes, the bell rang, alerting the end of the day. As the men assembled at the main meeting area, the commander spoke to them. He said that the ammunition would be entering full standardization. While the men had their reservations, the commander said this is to be expected with new standards. The men clapped and then went back to their bunks. As Joseph walked back, he thought if the commander was actually being truthful, this could be very good for the Front. If not, this could cause quite the issue for them."

 indrik.31.d: ""Fire" yelled Yuri from his observation platform.\n\nThe driver sitting in the front seat of the BM-21, gave Yuri the thumbs up, and then tapped his gunner on the shoulder, signaling him to fire the rocket system. Across the firing range was the Grand Marshal himself. He had been invited down to Komi to watch the final trial of the newest rocket launcher system that would be used against the Reich in reclaiming West Russia.\n\nOnce the gunner had locked down his adjustments, he had pushed the fire button and stepped out the vehicle, prepared for the barrage to occur. While the rockets developed by Splav had a range of twelve miles, the technicians and designers intended to use them as a barrage that would soften up defenses before tanks could roll in. This was compared to the system of using the rocket system like a mortar, pinpointing each target carefully. The forty barrels on the main launcher had enough power to shoot two rockets per second if the launcher was using newer rockets and not older ones. As the driver and gunner watched from afar, Yuri began to write notes down, marking down the proximity to the target that had been marked out with a smoke grenade. While this would never happen in a live battlefield, it helped to train the gunners in marking down their precision for the barrage to land.\n\nAs the rockets landed within quick succession of each other, the Grand Marshal and his entourage around him clapped. They had invested quite the funding into the URAGAN Project, hoping it would bear fruit to help them in their inevitable crusade. Later that night on the train back to Arkhangelsk, he had prepared a letter to be sent to Tula to the director of the URAGAN Project, congratulating him on the success of the BM-21 and then telling him that the project had succeed and he hopes to see it in full production soon. Tukhachevsky then awaited the long ride home, hoping that more good news would follow."

 indrik.32.d: "Valery grunted as he got up from underneath the BM-21 chassis, he was now dreading his choice of joining one of the many state owned repair garages. He had been given shifts constantly one after the other. However, he couldn't feel a bit patriotic in his duties. He was constantly repairing the BM-21, the next generation of rocket artillery for the Front.\n\nAs he got up from underneath, he dusted off his overalls and strolled to a fellow mechanic to discuss one of the many shortcomings of the BM-21.\n\n"Hello Adrian" said Valrey, hoping for a response from his comrade. "Any new flaws you have discovered in the BM-21?"\n\n"Well, you know the normal. Rusted chassis, broken fuses, sloppy engineering when it comes to the rocket itself. The whole thing seems like it could explode at any moment if I am being honest with you my friend." Said Adrian, who was flipping through his notes.\n\nValery fumbled with his own notes before responding. "Aye, I have nearly all the same problems, do you think the design will be approved?" Asked Valery with a bit of uncertainty in his voice.\n\n"Well it seems that these are only superficial to the Grand Marshal and his council, so I would hedge on the BM-21 going into full production" Replied Adrian, who now was on the last few pages of his notes.\n\nVlarey thought about this before responding to his friend. Would the Grand Marshal really fast-track production on something that could be in its infancy?"

 indrik.33.d: "The BM-21 began to grunt as it was attempting to go up the hill. Afar on an observation deck, the Grand Marshal frowned. Had he not invested enough money into making the next generation of rocket artillery for the Front? He was puzzled. From what he saw in his reports, progress seemed to be steady, with milestones being reached. As he saw however, some corners had to be cut to make it ready by the deadline.\n\nInside the testing facility in Komi, the staff was in a state of disarray. While they had some good trials and firing tests with the BM-21, it had a mountain of issues. The designers had meeting after meeting, to discuss these developments with most ending in arguments breaking out. It felt sometimes if the whole project would collapse in on itself, making the rift between designers even wider. However, usually at the end of the day, someone would suggest a quick fix, hoping it would hold. While these had been optimistic at first, they soon took a nosedive for the worse with even more arguments erupting over budget. Some days, after hours of work and discussion not even a single fix or change was made. As was life in the Project URAGAN development.\n\nAs time went on and on, more of the quick fixes had to be made. The chassis itself was eating quite a large bit of the budget, something that many of the rocket engineers had an issue with. Again, after the arguments and meetings that seemed to be a daily occurrence, they had finally reached an agreement. By the time they had agreed, their time had run out. Full trials had to begin the coming weeks. With the clock counting down day by day, they had to up their progress.\n\nTukhachevsky read this report on his desk and sighed. While the project could have been seen as a failure to some, they had increased in rocket development. However, the Front still needed something to move it."

 indrik.41.d: "Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky was in the observation bunker with his Politburo, while many of the other generals of the Front had seen Project TSYSKLON as a failure and a money sink, the recent tests had shown that this project was one that could help the Front extremely in preparation for their battle against the Germans.\n\nHowever, this project was not birthed by one man. It was the brainchild of an experimental division that had been assembled by many former Soviet scientists who had fled in the collapse of the Union nearly three decades ago. Many of which had been brought back into the fold after the Front had started their crusade to reform the Union and restore Russia to its glory days once again. After days and months of development and many restless nights, they had finally created something to be proud of.\n\nTukhachevsky himself had been invited to the briefing of the missile and the trials. He was shown a small presentation by the two head engineers and designers on the project. As Valentin Glushko walked up to the front, the Grand Marshal himself asked if the project could truly succeed. Glushko responded boldly to the leader of the Front, telling him that all would be explained in the live presentation. The Grand Marshal reserved his questions and sat quietly as Glushko explained the principles of a SRBM.\n\n"So what exactly is the payload?" Asked Tukhachevsky seemingly interested again, after hearing about the nine hundred and fifty kilogram warhead.\n\n"Well Grand Marshal, it can hold conventional, chemical and even nuclear if we ever acquire the technology." Replied Glushko who was getting antsy due to the questions.\n\nTukhachevsky nodded and soon after followed the engineers to the bunker to watch the launch. What he saw amazed him."

 indrik.42.d: "The siren ran through western Komi on the testing zone that had been used for Project TSYSKLON and the development of SRBMs and different payloads. In the launch site, engineers sat slumped over in chairs. Hoping for a proficient launch and good results. As the camera zoomed in on the launch pad, the room was full of hopes when the ignition began.\n\nThese hopes had been squashed however once the ignition didn't stop. The control room then filled with grunts and moans of disappointment as they waited for the rocket to explode. A few minutes after it did. The launch leader put his hands in his head and marked off another box on his notes before asking his aide how many more of these tests they would need to do. As the site was cleared, another rocket was being wheeled to the launch site and the room waited.\n\nThis time however, the missile launched without exploding. The room was full of sighs of relief as the rocket lifted off and headed towards the target site, nearly three hundred miles away. As the camera lost sight of the rocket, the launch station radioed to the target station to make sure the rocket hit its target and not veer off course like some of the other rockets they had launched in the past. Soon after they had made contact with the target station, they had received word that the rocket was in site and was heading towards the target with extreme precision. The launch room filled with cheers as it seemed they would succeed. As the rocket hit the target, it seemed to detonate correctly. However, after the dust had cleared, it was apparent that the warhead hadn't detonated and only the fuselage did. The mood back in the launch room went back to disappointment as they awaited another rocket."

 indrik.43.d: "The Project TSYSKLON team was sitting in their conference room, tensions had been high and they needed to hash out a solution. The deadline for the project had been moving closer and closer and the team had nothing to show besides prototypes and the carcasses of test rockets. While they still had the hundreds of blueprints and thousands of notes, they seemed to be a foreign language to the many designers. So many had been funneled in and out of the program due to working differences and personnel issues.\n\nWhile many of the lower ranked engineers had worked together, it seemed that fights and arguments had been constant with at least one senior engineer walking out on the meeting per day to only go back in later to regain their honor in a sort of shouting match. However, to many of the engineers on the lower rungs of the ladder and even some of the senior engineers, the most explosive was between Glushko and Chelomei. While the two men worked as allies, they had always had a bit of a rivalry with each other, and the stressful times had made the rivalry much more explosive combined with an ever creeping deadline.\n\nAs the meeting began, the first point of discussion was the topic of thrusters. After fifteen minutes of discussion, one of the senior engineers exploded into a tirade about budget costs and the ever expanding cost of fuel. The room soon went silent, Chelomei then muttered something about the fuel costing basically nothing compared to the cost of the warhead. Glushko turned to him and blinked, making sure he was hearing things correctly. He then responded telling Chelomei to shut up, however he knew this was a futile effort as Chelomei started to berate Glushko and the two started a shouting match. Outside the room, the junior engineers just looked at each other and shook their heads."

He cursed again about the cold, wishing he had been issued a thicker jacket, before scanning the horizon for their target. He moved around the tower of the submarine, making sure not to hit Maxim in the head with his arms. He thought he saw their target before realizing it was only a whale surfacing the ocean. Dima smiled for a split second before he kept looking. Once he spotted it, he called the captain on the radio he had.\n\n"This is Petty Officer Ivanov, target sighted north, bearing 276 degrees" He spoke into the microphone before clipping it back onto the radio and climbed down the ladder with Maxim handing him the radio. As he walked through the corridors, he wished that they had been designed to be a bit wider and taller, but it wasn't necessary.\n\nAs he walked through the winding corridors, weaving past the other crewmen. He walked past the mess hall and saw some of the men eat some of the lukewarm food that had been left over from lunch. Dima then walked into the bridge and placed his radio pack back onto the shelf before sitting down next to Maxim.\n\nAs the two sat there, they heard the torpedo tube be loaded and then the captain and the gunner's mate discussed the launch before the gunner's mate spoke into the intercom, authorizing the launch. The torpedo was then launched with the submarine shaking a bit as the captain looked through the conning tower. Dima noticed the captain's frown as he told the gunners mate the result of the torpedo. The gunner's mate shrugged and radioed headquarters.\n\nBack in Arkhangelsk, the mood was hopeful, but worried. Cost estimates had arrived for the submarines, they would cost a fortune for each submarine. After consideration, they finally sent a message to the Grand Marshal."

 indrik.52.t: "Project SHCHUKA - INCONCLUSIVE"
 indrik.52.d: "Lev stared at the cost estimates and shook his head. It was supposed to cost a few million less rubles, but after checking the math he noticed that they had gone over budget very heavily on the production of the new submarine that the Front had planned to use as an offensive and defensive tool when it came to the freezing oceans of Russia. However none of the designers anticipated it costing this much money.\n\nAfter meetings with the Politburo and even the Grand Marshal himself, they decided on only making a few submarines. But as construction went on with some light sea trials, more flaws exposed themselves. Due to the rush that they forced upon themselves, torpedos arming themselves and then falling out of their tubes was nearly commonplace on the submarines. Luckily in the light trials they did, no lives have been lost, however, privately some of the engineers thought this was a suicide mission. Why use submarines when you can just use ships? Some of the more experienced, older admirals thought this way, however their concerns had been drowned out by Tukhachevsky himself. He had seen the might of the German U-Boats during the Great Patriotic War and needed to learn. As much as he pushed for the development of submarines, the more he had pushback. However, they had quickly been silenced after the first, successful trials of the submarines. This didn't last for long, as costs and construction time began to pile up.\n\nAs Lev once again looked at his notes, he rubbed his temple. So far they only had the funds for only five submarines at most, but they haven't even built the frames for two of them. Only one was seaworthy and plagued by issues constantly. After he looked at his blueprints to see if anything was salvageable, he marked the torpedos and the engine. He would send his notes and messages to the Politburo and Grand Marshal tomorrow, hoping they would reconsider."

He knew that the long alarm knew something was wrong. That was the alarm that was let off, as he jumped out of bed, water was already beginning to lap at his ankles as he tried to get out.\n\nAs he looked out his room, he saw the crew rushing out of the submarine, many carrying personal belongings as they made a mad dash for the exit. He joined them in the dash as the senior officers and captain got everyone off the ship before themselves leaving. As they left the submarine they rushed across the gangway to the dock, as they watched the first and last submarine of its kind sink to the bottom of the sea.\n\n"What do you mean it sunk?" Asked Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky, sounding a bit annoyed but more confused than anything. "Did something strike it, maybe an attack?"\n\n"It doesn't seem so Grand Marshal, we believe due to the rushed production of the submarine and the cutting of corners, that some of the safety procedures had to be removed per say." The officer said this to the Grand Marshal, hoping he wouldn't get too angry.\n\n"Well was anything of value lost on the submarine when it sank?" Asked Tukhachevsky, hoping that something was saved.\n\n"Most of the plans had been lost on the submarine due to engineers making repairs on the craft before the incident had occurred that sunk the submarine" said the officer, shrinking down more in his seat."

 indrik.61.d: "Mikhail looked up from his experiments for a second to look at the notes that had been taped to the wall, next to him was an open book from the United States that had been smuggled in about chemical weapons. The Front had come quite a long way from the former backyard labs that Mikhail was used to, now they had a pristine lab that smelt of formaldehyde. It was a far cry for many of the scientists who had been working in more dingy environments until the Front came.\n\nAs Mikhail flipped through the pages of the book, he recognized most of the chapters on the chemicals. He must've read the book from the cover to the index hundreds of times. The contents of the book mostly focused on the chemical weapons used by the world's superpowers in the past decade. Chemicals such as Agent Orange, and other, more secretive nerve agents. Most of the other scientists in the lab had similar books but on different topics, all of them needed to pool together knowledge if they wanted to succeed in this program.\n\nTo the many scientists and members of the upper echelons of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, they knew the chemical had been made, but not yet finalized. It was known internally as the Novichok Agent. While soman had been discovered by a German three decades ago and was seen as the most toxic nerve agent developed, Novichok had dwarfed it and was nearly ten times more potent than it. The weapon itself was prepared in anticipation for the Continuation of the Great Patriotic War and the reclamation of Moscow from the German dogs. Tests had shortly begun after Novichok was deemed as "usable" by the scientists who developed it. They started slowly by testing on the local wildlife, results had been impeccable with the success rate being over eighty percent.\n\nAs Mikhail made his final adjustments, he put his notes and other info into a folder and put a message on the front."

It was the third they've done today and around the twentieth they've done since the weapon could begin to be tested. Human test subjects had been out of the picture, due to manpower worries in the upcoming war against the Reich. So the Project LESHIY team had been subjected to the use of the wild animals that roamed the Komi Oblast.\n\nHe then signaled to another scientist coming in. He wanted to take a break. As he walked out the testing room, he walked past the storage facility. While the Komi Republic had quite the chemical weapon stockpile that seemed to be growing by each year, it stagnated soon after. Due to lack of knowledge and even funding, they had year and year after failed to come up with new chemical agents or formulas. However, this wasn't an issue for the Front. The Grand Marshal had directed lots of funding to the program itself and had placed many of the former scientists that had worked in Komi on the new program. Unlike the Komi program, this time they had adequate funding and something else Komi didn't have. A port that could bring in information from the outside world on nerve agents and other bioweapons. Pavel walked into the break room, hoping there were some tea packets or even instant coffee, a commodity that they only had one or twice every few months. He luckily found some of the instant coffee and went back to his station.\n\nAs the last test for the day was finished, he wrote his results on it. More of the same, the agent was less lethal than expected it seemed. While not being the kill agent they had hoped for, it still had damaging properties. Mostly the extended brain damage and organ damage. Pavel ripped the sheet off and then put in it an envelope, for the next scientist to take a look at.

All fools. However, if there was one thing that Luka thought about, it was the colossal waste of resources and time of building weapons from scratch instead of using the already existing stockpile. While he himself had been a man who liked to make his own chemicals, on a scale like this it was suicide.\n\nConflict within the team had been a nightmare. Different scientists had joined for differing reasons, but all had wanted to accomplish the same goal. However, many had opposing ways of completing the goal. After time, these tensions that had been pent up exploded, with insults being tossed at each other during a meeting with members of the Grand Marshal's cabinet. As the cabinet members looked sheepishly at each other, they saw the arguments erupt along them as they sat, looking for a way to exit. Luka heard that when word of this reached the Grand Marshal, he shook his head and rubbed his temple in disappointment. Luka rubbed his face one more time at his desk and contemplated using the phone on his desk. While he had been high up on the ladder of scientists during this, he never expected to possibly call off the project.\n\nThe phone rang in Tukhachevsky's office. He had been looking out the window, with a drink in his hand, taking in the sights. He picked up the phone and after a few seconds, he subsequently pinched the bridge of his nose in annoyance. After a short conversation, he placed the phone back onto the rotary dial and poured himself another drink. He was going to need it after hearing about the failure of the chemical weapon program.

The airlock was vented, Viktor felt a bit of pressure against him that soon had gone away. He waved one last time as he opened the vacuum sealed door and closed it behind him, activating the seal one more time. He knew the risks that had come with this line of work. If any of the possible biological weapons leaked, the guards on the station had the full authority to euthanize him and anyone else exposed to the subject. A leak would have nearly apocalyptic results on the Project. They had all sorts of viruses inside the lab, with most being acquired by less, legal means internationally wise. Many of the viruses they had inside the lab could take down many countries within months if they had released them right now. They had been constantly tinkering with them, altering their biological potency. However, what came with this was great risk of a leak or even an accident. The smallest drop of blood from monkeys brought from the Congo possibly infected with a vicious strain of smallpox could end the entire project. Luckily, the cabinet of the Grand Marshal had invested quite the amount of money into the project to make sure they had the best equipment.\n\nAs Viktor was going through his tests, he kept his eyes on one thing only, his hands. As he looked through the many vials and the corpse that was now chilling on ice, he always made sure no cuts had been managed to be made on his hands, potentially infecting him. However, today was like all of the other days, no cuts and now his shift was over. He walked up to the wall near the airlock and pressed the button.

Sitting outside however was Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky, who had been waiting for the meeting to begin. He was with his cabinet as well, hoping to see some activity come out of the room. As Tukhachevsky waited, he just hoped that they would take his arrival of news well. He was about to deliver the news that the project would only be able to make only a few biological weapons due to budget constraints.\n\nAs the door swung open, the men in the room had all jumped out of their seats and stood to attention to the leader of the Front. He saluted them and then told them to sit. Many of the scientists had been jittery in their seats, expecting to be told that the project was going to be canceled due to the budget constraints. However, the Grand Marshal then said the men would not be canceled actually. Instead, it would be lessened when it came to manpower and development. The budget of the project had begun to take its toll on them. While much of the money was still remaining, they had spent nearly sixty percent of it so far. All of the virus bases had to be sent to Russia, most often by smugglers or boxes that had been sent to Russia on the idea of "scientific advancements". While the boxes had been right about the advancements, it was a much more destructive type of science. As the Grand Marshal explained the reason behind the shortening of the program and the redistribution of men, Demyan listened more. He then was handed a list of the men who would be sent to different divisions to continue the war effort. As he read off the document one by one, Demyan waited for his name to be called. However, it was never called. He celebrated a bit to himself before calming back down and listening.\n\nLater, Demyan had been dropped off the official budget papers from one of his co-workers.

Grand Army Command.\n\n"Yuri, are you alright? I had just received news of the anthrax leak? Is it contained yet?" He said this to the scientist, expecting a rushed response. He gulped and hoped for a response, they would need to solve this fast.\n\n"I am Grand Marshal, I had been rushed out of the research lab after the leak had been produced. We had scrambled our guards who had put on CBRN suits to begin to liquidate any infected scientists. However by the time we had-" he was then cut off Tukhachevsky.\n\n"Yuri, how much of the project was lost?" Said Tukhachevsky starting to sound annoyed, he signaled to his assistant, telling him to call the Stavka to begin to evacuate the civilians out of the region.\n\nThe scientist gulped "Nearly all of it, during the confusion fires had broken out and triggered many of the self destruct devices that we had placed inside it." After hearing this the Grand Marshal hung up the phone. He rubbed his face with his hands, before slamming his desk with his fists, in anger at the anthrax leak. One that could have been avoided so easily."
 indrik.73.a: "So easily..."

 WRS_OBT_program_desc: "While established designs such as the T-55 have served well, it is obvious that if we will ever be able to compete with more developed foreign competitors, Soviet armored formations must be re-equipped with more technologically advanced vehicles capable of eventually taking on the fascist occupiers. To this end, the Grand Marshal has directed that a new, ultimate, "universal" tank design be developed by means of rigorous testing and field trials."
 WRS_izhevsk_experimental_constructor_works_desc: "Shifts in the defense technology landscape are leading armies across the world to move towards smaller rifle cartridges, with an eye towards maximizing point-blank range and increasing the ammunition load capable of being carried by a single soldier. As such, it is imperative that we develop a similar cartridge for our forces, along with AKM and RPD variants capable of firing it."
 WRS_project_uragan_desc: "The legendary BM-13 Katyusha is rapidly approaching obsolescence, and it is now incumbent upon our engineers to design a suitable replacement. This new design must not only fill the shoes of its predecessor - it must expand upon the BM-13's capabilities, with a higher rocket capacity and a guidance system capable of maximizing the kill probability of every fire mission."
 WRS_project_tsysklon_desc: "At present, the Soviet armed forces lack any sort of theater-level force projection capability comparable to that enjoyed by the world's superpowers. Developing this will take some time, but our first step must be the creation of a functional short-range ballistic missile, capable of delivering a 950 kg warhead (conventional, chemical, or, some day, nuclear) several hundred miles."
 WRS_project_shchuka_desc: "It is obviously foolhardy for the Soviet Union to attempt to build a blue-water navy capable of taking on the likes of the Kriegsmarine and IJN. A focus on interdiction tactics and submarine warfare would serve us much better, but our present submarine forces are horribly outdated. New diesel-electric, and, eventually, nuclear submarine designs are imperative."
 WRS_project_leshiy_desc: "For nearly half a century, there has existed an international taboo on the use of chemical weapons in war. However, we are fighting not only for our own survival, but for the salvation of humanity itself, and, in such a struggle, there can be no rules. Chemical weapons can literally smother the enemy's operational initiative, and our existing stock must not only be expanded, but also augmented with new and more lethal formulas."
 WRS_project_ferment_desc: "The wars of the future will likely be total in a manner which supersedes our current concept of totality. The battlespace may not only encompass the traditional domains of air, sea, and land, but also that of biology itself. Biological weapons represent a force multiplier of tremendous magnitude, and could give our forces a decisive upper hand, even in a conflict against a superpower. Their development must be prioritized."

 WRS_Tangle_Decisions_Category: "The New Soviet State"
 WRS_Tangle_Decisions_Category_desc: "While Zhukov is an adept military strategist and an extremely charismatic figurehead, the fact remains that he is largely apolitical and apathetic to what path the WRRF takes diplomatically. Seeing an opportunity for power and the chance to reform the Soviet Union as they see fit, a number of politicians vie for control.\n\nSergrey Akhromeyev, the Orthodox politician and a staunch Bukharinist, supports the policy of war communism but advocated phasing it out. Open to collaboration with the OFN, Akhromeyev is willing to do almost anything to ensure that a Bukharinist polity continues to exist and thrive in Russia.\n\nNikolay Ryzkhov, a pragmatic Leninist, also supports phasing out war communism in the coming years. A believer in democratic elections as soon as the emergency is over, he will reshape Russia in the wake of Zhukov's death in the coming years.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev, the closest man to a capitalist in the WRRF, supports limited privatization, free and open trade, and halting war communism as soon as possible. Yakovlev is also notable in his staunch support of free and open elections and receiving aid from the OFN.\n\nThe current §Ybalance of power§! within the [WRS.GetName], between the factions of:\n- §eSergey Akhromeyev§!\n- §SNikolay Ryzhkov§!\n- §PAlexander Yakovlev§!\n\nIs in favor of [WRSGetContenderInfluence].\n\nPossible reforms to the bureaucracy can be seen below.\n"

 USSR.1917.t: "The Final Revolution"
 USSR.1917.d: "United forever in friendship and labor,\nOur mighty republics will ever endure.\nThe Great Soviet Union will live through the ages.\nThe dream of a people their fortress secure.\n\nLong live our Soviet motherland,\nBuilt by the people's mighty hand.\nLong live our people, united and free.\nStrong in our friendship tried by fire.\nLong may our crimson flag inspire,\nShining in glory for all men to see.\n\nThrough days dark and stormy where Great Lenin lead us\nOur eyes saw the bright sun of freedom above\nAnd Stalin our leader with faith in the people,\nInspired us to build up the land that we love."
 USSR.1917.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

#Intro event
 WRS.1.t: "The Revolution's Northern Star"
 WRS.1.d: "Through the black forties we carried on. The Germans, in their arrogance, thought the Soviet Union broken, consigned to the dustbin of history. Throughout the decade, we plotted and prepared. Throughout Russia and Central Asia, men and women alike united for a great attempt to push back the fascists. In the West Russian War, the complacent Germans suffered defeat after defeat as the armies of the workers marched west. But, at the height of our success, the Red Army was betrayed by her own people. Reactionary Russian dogs and Tsarist boot-lickers helped the Germans turn back the tide and destroy our overstretched frontline. Deep behind our lines as well, revolt after revolt sprang up as demagogues preached the end of the Soviet Union.\n\nNow, the nation forged in Lenin's revolutionary flame has been reduced to a few scraps of frozen land. Veterans of twenty years of endless warfare barely hold our possessions south of the Arctic Circle. Beyond our borders, dozens of warlords loot the ruins of Russia as the common people suffer in the Russian Anarchy. We have lost contact with every other remnant of the Red Army, pushed back from their stations in Central Asia and Siberia. Within our borders, starving refugees barely have enough calories to maintain our rusting industrial sector. Military officers squabble with one another, reflecting the disunity that proved fatal to the Soviet nation in the West Russian War.\n\nThrough all this, the revolution endures. As the northern star shines above us, so must we provide eternal guidance to the workers of Russia and beyond. The workers' liberation is inevitable, a force of history that cannot be arrested by tyrants and madmen. If we do not succeed, then future generations shall remember our example! We will not stop fighting until either death or the day that the blood red banner of socialism flies anew. Comrades, onward!"
 WRS.1.a: "The Guiding Star in the Northern Sky."

#Event for The Agriculture Situation - talk about how the Front is slowly depleting its rations, perhaps from the perspective of a common worker or soldier.
 WRS.2.t: "The Agricultural Situation"
 WRS.2.d: "Yuliya carried the food rations home. Even with the diminished supply of food, it was difficult for her to bring everything back home by herself. Her husband toiled in his factory at this time of the day, and could not help her bring home the family's supplies for the week.\n\nOnce home, the food was unpacked and set in front of her on the table. A careful balancing act had to follow. Her husband received a fair share of the week's calory supply. Reducing his allotment any further might lead to him collapsing again in his workshop. Factory work was energy intensive.\n\nStale flour from Komi made up a lot of the week's food. She reserved some of the canned vegetables for Alyosha. The boy had recently gotten over a nasty flu, and needed the extra vitamins.\n\nOn and on her calculations and allocations went. Eventually she had a good idea of how to stretch out the food for the week. Yuliya could not help but notice that the week's total was smaller than the previous week. A border conflict in the south had disrupted the transport network. This must have delayed food imports considerably. Added to that issue was the year's meager harvest. Farming this close to the Arctic Circle was not a simple proposition. As a result, the Front's government had to dip in its food reserve every year. The increasingly low level of stockpiles was an open secret. The region faced starvation within the next few years if nothing was done.\n\nThere was naught Yuliya could do about it. In the summer month, she would have access to her small garden plot anew. There at least would come a few extra nutrients for the family's need."
 WRS.2.a: "Not much food to go around."

#Ration Calculations focus - a commissar digs through some old records and crates to figure out the exact rate at which resources are being depleted.
 WRS.3.t: "Calculating Ration Size" #Doodger
 WRS.3.d: "Arkhangelsk had never been meant to be the capital of the WRRF. In the chaos that followed the Front's collapse in the fifties, a long march north had seen the Red Army drag everything it could away from the German army and their Russian confederates. The fallback position had been Syktyvkar, well stocked in weapons and equipment. But the accursed Luftwaffe had bombed important buildings just as the Red Army and the refugee columns entered the city. In the ensuing panic, the leadership had decided to move further north from the compromised city. By the time the dust had settled, Syktyvkar had slipped from the Front's control and into the hands of the young Komi republic.\n\nIt had been a decade since then, and the mess of records had only been partially resolved. The commissar doing the day's research work knew that the government had a good idea of the food stockpile level ("not very high") and of how long they would last ("not very"). But proper numbers were critical. Running out of food a month early could have catastrophic consequences. Letting crates of food go bad without using them would be equally intolerable. And so the WRRF's deadly calculations were carried on every day. Projected food reserves were stretched over projected calorie needs for factory workers, pregnant women, soldiers, children, and everyone else. Every new crate of food made a real difference in the life of the Front's citizens."
 WRS.3.a: "Someday, we won't need all this stale food"

#Examine The Stockpiles focus - some soldiers come are excited to come across an untouched stockpile with usable food supplies.
 WRS.4.t: "Examining the Stockpiles"
 WRS.4.d: "The commissar had given them a few leads, retrieved from old documents. The soldiers fanned out around the old warehouse, looking for unopened crates. Many of them revealed guns, as the markings on the boxes indicated. But a few of them indeed turned out to be mislabeled. Excited, the soldiers began cracking open crates with renewed vigor.\n\nBoxes upon boxes of mislabeled food appeared in front of the amazed soldiers. As it turned out, during the panicked evacuation of western Russia, one unit had turned all of its flour reserve into hardtack. The rationale had been to preserve the food during the long trip overland. But the soldiers had to reuse old crates of military supply to store their biscuits, and lost sight of them during the panicked overland escape. Only a small note in the margins of a shipping manifesto had revealed the hidden food supply.\n\nThe soldiers were hungry, as always. But cracking their teeth on the hardtack would do them little good. Instead they radioed in command to inform them of the discovery. At least a thousand meals could be found in this warehouse. Perhaps others like it existed.\n\nEvery man resisted the temptation to hide a hardtack biscuit or two. The soldiers knew the food would be put to its best possible use."
 WRS.4.a: "What a find!"

#Event for Vologda - the WRRF trades guns for food.
 WRS.5.t: "Guns for Food"
 WRS.5.d: "To our north, what remains of the West Russia Revolutionary Front. Depicting itself as the continuation of the Soviet Government, the Front formally claims dominion over all of Russia, Vologda included. Yet in the aftermath of the disastrous West Russian War, the Front has had to recognize de facto our independence in Kostroma. While many in Arkhangelsk would see us bending the knee to the Front, for now the majority of the Front is content to do businesses with us on equal terms.\n\nOur main export to the Front is food, for the northern territories have little arable soil on which food can grow. While we are not an agricultural titan either, our food surpluses can always be traded with the Front in a profitable manner. The WRRF possesses a surprisingly advanced industrial base, and manufactures several superb equipments such as the gold standard AK pattern rifle in Western Russia. We can thus trade our food for good hardware."
 WRS.5.a: "Plowshares into swords."

#Event for Komi - the WRRF trades guns for food. From the perspective of any notable Komi politician.
 WRS.6.t: "An Offer from the Front" #Doodger
 WRS.6.d: "The trade convoys rumbled past Zhdanov's office at the usual time each month. Headed north west toward the Front, the trucks carried crate of essential food from Komi. Each truck's food cargo would help the Front stave off starvation for a few more precious days. In return, the trucks would be loaded with high quality hardware such as AK pattern rifles.\n\nZhdanov's mind inevitably turned to the Front itself. He missed his comrades in the Front. Hard working men that kept up the fight for the eternal workers' revolution. Zhdanov remembered the long flight to Syktyvkar, and the panic caused by the bombings. In its aftermath the politician had found himself stranded in Komi, and involved himself with the burgeoning local communist movement.\n\nStill, the Front held only by a few threads. Zhdanov had often thought of returning there, but the Red Army's precarious position made it a losing proposal. Better for the revolution to take over Komi first as a base of operation."
 WRS.6.a: "Always of use."

#Event for Komi - the WRRF trades guns for food. However, the face is different...
 WRS.601.t: "An Unusual Circumstance" #Fetti
 WRS.601.d: "The trade convoys rumbled past Zhdanov's office at the usual time each month. However, this time no person, neither Zhdanov, neither his usual attendants came to their presence. In fact, for the longest time, the convoy handlers simply stood, the accompanying scout repeatedly knocking on their contact's office, for no avail. Perhaps, the time of their old contact in the Republic had come to a sudden end.\n\nAs they prepare to turn back, however, a peculiar figure approached them. Pronouncing themselves as someone representing the interest of a "sympathetic comrade in the revolution", it offered to honor the deal of the now late Zhdanov, and his bridge with the Revolutionary Front. While in more fortuitous circumstances such suspicious handlings of Komi were matters beyond the decisions of those transporting the goods, the hunger of the people at home spoke louder. The deal was struck, the trucks were driven further down the street, and the deal was finished, even if by different hands."
 WRS.601.a: "As long as it's not a wasted trip..."

#Event for Vorkuta, the WRRF trades guns for food that originates in Zlatoust/Yugra.
 WRS.7.t: "Dealings with the Front" #Doodger - Skipped with pacifica's blessing
 WRS.7.d: "The Western Russian Revolutionary Front has maintained contacts with us dating back to the days of the West Russian War, often inquiring about the procurement of supplies and munitions. Recently these contacts have been tapped once more to facilitate the movement of several envoys from Arkhangelsk to our fair Republic.\n\nThese envoys have come looking to purchase food and other necessities and have been willing to pay a handsome sum. While they have gone on about how it is our "patriotic duty" and whatnot, they have been willing to pay up when pressed, and so we have allocated them several shipments of rations and other assorted supplies for their journey back."
 WRS.7.a: "The business of Zlatoust is business."

#Event for the Army Situation - some officers are pleased to see that the troops are still in good condition, but express concern for the future, as manpower is low.

 WRS.8.t: "The Casualties" #senorlowkey
 WRS.8.d: "In the cold morning air of Arkhangelsk, two officers in brown observed as the soldiers of the Revolutionary Front train. They looked as the troops crawled in the mud, under fire from a machine gun firing blanks. Further afield, a line of sandbags lay between men and women kneeling, digging their rifles into their shoulders, aiming at the targets that stood in varying distances between them. A few NCOs stood there, checking the rate of firing with the ammo issued.\n\n"And another good morning as well, lieutenant," the older officer said, adjusting his cap, "I see that the troops are in order." The younger officer, hiding a smile, said, "Thank you, sir." He looked to his superior to find a reflection of his pride. He found none. The old commissar held a stonelike frown. They stayed silent for a while. The lieutenant broke the ice, saying, "What worries you, sir?"The veteran touched his cap. He sighed and said, "I worry for our numbers." The young man was about to defend himself before a wagging finger stopped him. "Not your fault. When I fought in the war, losing a man or two was no problem. After all, there were a lot of good Russians," he swept his hands around the camp, "as you see here." He looked down and continued, "The truth is, we are losing men, you see. Your soldiers are good, but one or two will die. The recruits are not coming in fast enough." He returned his gaze to the troops. "I worry about that; the casualties." He quieted down, muttering"
 WRS.8.a: "For the dead are truly irreplaceable."

#Event for Tukhachevsky - Yegorov telegrams, asks him if he can send some of his experienced officers to Arkhangelsk, and give him some new officers to train.
 WRS.9.t: "A Courtesy Call"
 WRS.9.d: "The telegram from Arkhangelsk was delivered to General Tukhachevsky. Marshal Yegorov's curt tone shone through the orders. The Front requested Tukhachevsky to send some of his experienced officers up north. In exchange, a fresh batch of recruits with college level education would be sent south to the military frontier for training.\n\nSitting at his desk, Tukhachevsky looked at the pile of paperwork prepared by his aides. The General found it slightly heart-breaking to write the relocation orders. Losing experienced staff was always disappointing. Even the prospect of seeing some of his loyalists in Arkhangelsk's court politics did not change the fact that good officers were hard to come by. Repelling bandit raids and preparing offensives against the reactionaries to the south. But this was Tukhachevsky's assignment, and staying in Arkhangelsk's good grace was crucial to his future.\n\nAnd so the general filled relocation order after relocation order. By the time his job was complete, his hand was cramped from signing so many orders. Upon being summoned, his assistant began transferring each order in an envelope. All this mail would be forwarded to the various sectors of the front."
 WRS.9.a: "Orders are orders."

#Event for a border skirmish - the WRRF has won in a raid against Onega, and morale is high.
 WRS.11.t: "Border Raid - WRRF Victory!" #Senorlowkey
 WRS.11.d: "After these nail-biting days following a military engagement between the Onega Guard and the Revolutionary Army, the nervous air in Arkhangelsk was broken by a ring of a bell. A telegram had arrived. Everyone in the officer's hall gathered in its center, nervous to hear the news.\n\n"Success on raid to the front onegans on the run - will pursue." The room broke into a cheer, even before the messenger had a chance to pronounce the last STOP. A few men jumped in the air. Some ran to catch cars heading to the radio station. Everyone was in high spirits. Bars started gathering crowds and crowds of people toasting to the names of the heroes of the battle.\n\nThis latest conflict has proved that the Revolutionary Front is on the up and up. It is a victory to the training, equipment, and doctrine of the Army. Though it may be but a footnote in the course of history, this is another triumph of socialism over despotism and fascism."
 WRS.11.a: "Onwards!"

#Event for a border skirmish - the WRRF has lost in a raid against Onega, and morale is low. Officers ask how this happened.
 WRS.12.t: "Border Raid - WRRF Defeat!"
 WRS.12.d: "A ragged group of men staggered into the gates of Arkhangelsk. They had been relieved after the battle that occurred in the Onega-Front border, dragging their wounded with them. They come in stretchers, walking sticks, limping and bleeding. Shame flushed their faces in the morning cold. The citizens only looked at them and pointed their heads down when they found their eyes met. It was a defeat!\n\nAlready the officers in the high command shuffled their feet. They were set to conduct interviews with the soldiers about the combat they've just seen. But a question hung in the air. How did the Onegans beat them, while the Front held the superior equipment and doctrine, not to mention numbers and training? These would be a bitter lesson to learn. The fact that Onega won over them was insignificant in the long run, but the sheer humiliation endured.\n\nToday our comrades grieve. But defeat is not a stain that would remain long uncleaned. We will return, with the lessons we have learned today, and unleash upon the fascists and despotists our vengeance."
 WRS.12.a: "Live to fight another day."

#Event for The Districts Situation - Yegorov wishes that Zhukov and Tukhachevsky would just do their fucking jobs and stop competing.
 WRS.17.t: "The Districts Situation"
 WRS.17.d: "To the south lie the districts of Plesetsk and Ukhta. In theory, districts like any other within the Western Russian Revolutionary Front, headed by capable military officers. In practice the two southern military districts serve as a combination of remote exile locations and personal fiefdom for two of the WRRF's most important and controversial officers.\n\nGeorgy Zhukov and Mikhail Tukhachevsky are both hard-working, talented military officers. Their loyalty to the workers' revolution and to the Soviet People has been demonstrated on many battlefields, from the bloody Civil War against bourgeois opressors to the desperate fight of the second great patriotic war against the Germans. Yet in the dark days of the fifties, at the apex of each man's military career, tragedy struck the WRRF's effort when a successful German counter-attack managed to break through Soviet lines. Both generals had long held a rivalry, and the sight of soviet soldiers killed in the breakthrough's aftermath deepened this contention to a profound hatred. Blaming one another for the failure of the front, Zhukov and Tukhachevsky have since drawn their respective supporters in a decade long struggle for the future of the WRRF. Worried about the threat of disunity, the front's leader saw fit to give each his own military district to rule over, away from Arkhangelsk and its court politics.\n\nDistance did little to mend the rift between the two great generals. Despite being given crucial tasks for the future of the WRRF, both men continue their squabbling. The general's supporters in Arkhangelsk proper continuously try to funnel more resources to one side or the other. Even with the front's manpower shortage, both Tukhachevsky and Zhukov send legion of spies to the other side. As a result, Arkhangelsk often serves as holding pen for caught spies. Marshal Yegorov's usual bedtime reading consists of letter by one general accusing the other of negligence and incompetence. The old marshal's only wish was for both men to stop their useless bickering and focus on the task at hand."
 WRS.17.a: "Why won't they fucking do their job?"

#Event for Doctrinal Re-Evaluation - Yegorov decides to approach Altunin, Zhukov, and Tukhachevsky for their latest theories.
 WRS.18.t: "Doctrinal Re-Evaluation"
 WRS.18.d: "The old joke about every military training to win the previous war does not amuse Marshal Yegorov much. The WRRF has lost the previous war, and the old officer desires nothing more than to learn from the past's mistakes. As such, modernization of army doctrines has remained an important topics for the front's leadership. Several conflicting theories about the WRRF's shortcomings have been developed in time.\n\nGenerals Zhukov and Tukhachevsky only agree about the need for reform. Zhukov's take away from the collapse of the front's positions is that a nation with a smaller industrial capacity must make efficient use of its reserves of armor, guns and other complex equipment. When the Germans had funelled in every last armored divisions to stabilize the eastern front, the WRRF could no longer get ahead by trading armor losses for armor losses. Zhukov thus surmises that by carefully harassing German lines, surrounding and destroying isolated mechanized units and overall degrading the equipment and supplies of the enemy, the front can use its own respectable pool of armor for a decisive battle. Only with the destruction of local enemy superiority could the Red Army then go on the offensive to gain ground.\n\nBy contrast, Tukhachevsky believes that the concepts of deep operation that he and other Soviet theorists began to develop in the twenties can still be polished further. What doomed the Red Army's effort in the twenties and fifties was the poor coordination of advancing armies as well as the lack of contingency defensive plans. Once the Red Army found itself unable to advance further, its failure to regroup and beat back enemy counter-attacks had erased most of its progress. Better integration of every field army into one united command structure would help with this problem.\n\nCloser to home, General Altunin has also found himself reflecting on the successes and failures of the Red Army. His own conclusions are that the front's supply lines had been far too weak to keep front line units at their peak fighting capacity. The most likely culprit for this, thinks the former logistics officer, was the lack of integration of the civilian and military authorities. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the front was run like an emergency military dictatorship and economic development was abandoned for a "military first" policy that ultimately left the WRRF a paper tiger. A more pragmatic development scheme covering all the bases of the economy to keep a steady flow of food, clothing and equipment to the troops, combined with a rebuilt logistic arm might be just the ticket for a renewed offensive war.\n\nAll three men possess strong analytical minds, and each general's thoughts are part of the greater problem. Yet our limited resources force us to pick and choose one approach. Not to mention that the political fallout of favoring one of these men's plan for the future of our nation makes it unlikely that the other two will offer much help to implement their rivals' plan."
 WRS.18.a: "Let's give this some thinking."

#Event for Side With Tukhachevsky - Yegorov decides to adopt Tukhachevsky's proposal.
 WRS.19.t: "Yegorov's Order"
 WRS.19.d: "In the end it was Tukhachevsky's proposal that held the most merit. The general was often criticized for his breathtaking ego, yet Tukhachevsky's ideas about reforms showed a level of introspection that impressed the old marshal.\n\nYegorov's first move would likely be a reform of the command structure. It would not be popular to wrangle troops away from ambitious generals, but a better integration of the various armies would be indispensable. Retraining officers and improving their understanding of deep battle will also be increasingly important if the WRRF is to begin the unification wars with an army able to rapidly overrun its opponents.\n\nNews from Plesetsk detail Tukhachevsky being pleased and having started to teach some deep battle training to the newest recruits. In Uktha, Zhukov has been disappointed to see deep battle prioritization resumed, but his factories have collaborated with our early attempts to reorganize tank and vehicle production."
 WRS.19.a: "Strategy, perfected."

#Event for Side With Altunin - Yegorov decides to adopt Altunin's proposal.
 WRS.20.t: "Siding with Altunin"
 WRS.20.d: "In the end, General Altunin's proposal was selected by Marshal Yegorov. While General Zhukov and Tukhachevsky's ideas hold merit, Altunin's simple idea of re-developing the front's logistic arm to more modern standards is the most urgent one. No level of advanced strategic thinking can cover up basic supply and logistics inefficiencies.\n\nA new joint civilian military authority will be created to help develop logistical plans. Instead of fulfilling supply request from a variety of generals, this new department will request detailed strategical plans from each army group and allocate resources accordingly. A safety margin of extra supply will be stored in each strategic operation zone, to prepare for any eventuality.\n\nNews from Plesetsk and Uktha have conveyed Zhukov and Tukhachevsky's disappointment at seeing their ideas ignored. While both men agree about the necessity of better logistical supply, they also both insist on the need for modernized strategy and tactics if the Red Army is to recapture Russia and take on the Germans. Left unsaid is each man's dismay at being snubbed by Yegorov and the Front's higher ups in favor of Altunin."
 WRS.20.a: "What works is what works."

#Event for Side With Zhukov - Yegorov decides to adopt Zhukov's proposal.
 WRS.21.t: "Yegorov's Order"
 WRS.21.d: "In the end it was General Zhukov's program that clinched it. Marshal Yegorov and his advisors recognized Zhukov's argumentation that the Red Army could no longer afford to fight as if its industrial capacity rivalled that of Germany. Two decades of conflict and bombing have considerably hindered the replenishment of the Front's tank fleet, among other things. In the fifties the Red Army managed to overrun the German's lax frontier troops and crush its out-numbered tank divisions. But when the tide had begun to turn and the fascists had started trading vehicle for vehicle, the Front's ability to continue mechanized warfare had withered away.\n\nZhukov's suggestion to withhold tanks from the frontline until a decisive victory can be earned has been decried as cowardice by Tukhachevsky among many others. But Zhukov has again and again calmly defended his ideas in a series of letter to Arkhangelsk. By letting the enemy exhaust himself in fruitless assault on line after line of minefields and defensive position, his local advantage in material can be rendered irrelevant. It ultimately littles how many armored fighting vehicles each side begins with; what matters the most, according to Zhukov, is which side is left holding the strategic breakthrough capacity once the dust settles."
 WRS.21.a: "We will marshal our forces for one decisive offensive."

#Event for Forward Unto Dawn - the Front's general staff is optimistic about the future, as the bombings begin to slow down.
 WRS.22.t: "The End of the Iron Storm"
 WRS.22.d: "The German planes had always saved a good quantity of their fuel and ordnance to bomb the Front's last few industrial center. Air shelter alerts had always been part of life for the WRRF's civilian population, long boring hours spent in bomb shelter punctuated now and then by a few instants of terrifying rumbling.\n\nThe last few months had seen rarer bombing. The Luftwaffe's habitual randomization of bombing runs had grown even more erratic, as what remained of available supplies was used up by the aerobases in Moskowien. As rumors had it, the winds of war were blowing closer to home. As the Führer's dying breath grew ever more strained.\n\nThe front's General Staff had long marked the start of every day by tallying the number of bombing sorties. Now the graph sloped down rapidly, as the number of grounded German planes soared ever higher. Rid of the fear of German vultures, the Front's supply convoys moved more confidently. So would the bandits, traitors and reactionaries beyond the Front's border, of course. But the general staff of the Red Army did not fear the Russian rabble. They had won the civil war, forty years ago. In the fifties the brave soldiers of the workers' state had almost brought down the German colossus. It mattered not how the WRRF's would array themselves, for the Front's generals would fight on, leading their men on the inevitable path of history. The day of liberation approached. Once the German planes flew their last, the wars of unification would begin!"
 WRS.22.a: "We will bury them."

#The bombings end, military exercises resume, and Tukhachevsky is informed that he will need to step up his training programs to handle new influx of resources.
 WRS.23.t: "Tukhachevsky's New Directive"
 WRS.23.d: "General Tukhachevsky had expected the telegram from Arkhangelsk. His own intelligence corps, limited as it was, had plotted the decreasing frequency of bombing runs. Traders that plied the routes between Western Russia and Moskowien had brought the rumors of the rising tensions in Germany. A German civil war seemed on the horizon. With it would come the end of the terror bombing.\n\nArkhangelsk expected much of him. The telegram from the Front's command informed him of the upcoming opportunity caused by a breakdown of the Reich. Resources would be free to move without the fear of aerial harassment. Offensive operations would be free to begin against the reactionaries and traitors of the Russian Anarchy. Tukhachevsky would be at the center of this; the other commanders expected him to step up his training program and convert a flood of raw resources and green recruits into hardened army corps.\n\nThe general thought of Zhukov receiving orders. He smiled. High command would no doubt see the assignments as a way for ambitious generals to prove themselves. Never a better time for general Tukhachevsky to secure his ascendance once and for all."
 WRS.23.a: "They'll have no cause for complaint from me."

#The bombings end, industry is uncovered, and Zhukov is informed that quotas are going up so that the WRRF can reclaim Russia, finally.
 WRS.24.t: "Zhukov's New Directive"
 WRS.24.d: "Zhukov began his day reading the news from the north. Arkhangelsk's top brass had seen fit to confirm the general's suspicion about the decreasing rate of German bombing. With Germany itself spiralling closer and closer to civil unrest, the amount of resources allocated to the terror bombing was dwindling fast. Soon the Russian Anarchy might end.\n\nThis would make Zhukov's assignment much easier. The oil and agricultural sectors he had been tasked to develop would finally be free to use the full range of industrial techniques. Supply chains would be freed from the risk of being bombed during the day, making it easier to import the crucial resources the Front needed. The Front's higher up expected Zhukov to increase the quota of goods brought to the Front for the war effort. The general had no intention of failing this task.\n\nThe general thought of his rival to the west. Tukhachevsky would no doubt see additional troop requests from Arkhangelsk. The upcoming wars of liberation would be an excellent opportunity to show loyalty and competence to the Red Army's leadership. Zhukov hoped the Front's would not be distracted by court politics at this crucial time."
 WRS.24.a: "We will craft the workers' sword."

#fuck time is running out - we need food
 WRS.25.t: "Bean-Counting"
 WRS.25.d: ""And that makes it..." Starshina Nikolai Petrov glanced up from the charts splayed on his desk, "what again, Comrade Secretary?"\n\n"3,925 tons of canned beans!" chimed a child sat next to Nikolai. On his left hand was a pencil twice his fingers' width; on his right, office paper scribbled with graphite lines.\n\nSmilingly, the quartermaster continued. "Then suppose we consider how many tons we began the month with - say, 30 days ago. The report mentioned 4,370. How many tons does the glorious Red Army eat every day?"\n\nThis time pencil scritch-scratched paper a moment longer than last. The child's brows furrowed as his lips hummed and pursed. Wide doe eyes then affixed Nikolai with a question. "Around fifteen?"\n\n"14.83. Splendid work as always, Comrade Kirilov." A calloused hand reached under the Comrade Secretary's officer hat - two sizes too wide so the brim engulfed his forehead up to browline - and tousled auburn blonde hair. There was much giggling and screeching.\n\n"The Comrade Colonel will want today's report. Don't want him to wait any longer, now do we?"\n\nAt his father's mention, Comrade Kirilov hopped out of his seat and flashed Nikolai a tiny, pencil-laden salute. "Right away, Comrade Starshina!"\n\nNikolai Petrov let both his own salute and smile drop as little Igor closed shut his office door."
 WRS.25.a: "If the Red Army were only losing beans."

#lets buy food
 WRS.26.t: "Securing Food"
 WRS.26.d: ""Will you need anything else Comrade Grechko?"\n\nFor the first time in hours, Marshal Andrey Grechko turned away from the tabletop map. "Some buterbrod if the chefs are offering, thanks." he said to his secretary, keeping his wrinkled smile free of the strain hammering at his eyeballs. With any luck his endeavors would be worth the migraine built from poor lighting and fine print.\n\nThen again, the map itself may already have been outdated by the time the courier delivered it to his office. Stable borders were luxuries in West Russia for a reason, after all. And what use was there in making deals with a dead warlord?\n\nGrechko loosened a groan as he inspected his map again. Scattered around its margins were one-page reports of the region's most notable warlords, like the tsarists in Vyatka, or the peculiar republicans in Syktyvkar. Some even discussed warlords beyond the Urals, like their compatriots in Sverdlovsk. These statelets could feed most of their charges with at least two meals a day: a damn sight better still than the Red Army's own capabilities in any case. Grand Marshal Yegorov would delight in knowing anyone the Front can trade with for food, reactionary or no.\n\nThe Front's Foreign Minister was not one for easy distractions - except, apparently, for the plateful of bread, butter, and thick slices of doktorskaya kolbasa his secretary returned with."
 WRS.26.a: "Each bite reminded Grechko of his labor's fruits."

Tender it, nurture it, stoke it. And know that I'll bring each and every one of you hateful bastards with me to Syktyvkar.

Borislav's last rationed cigarette hung from his lips as it effused secondhand smoke throughout the cabin. "It's the fifth time we've done this song and dance this week, Boris. Kulaks always fold when they're at the front end of a barrel."\n\nBorislav peered ahead, where Sarge and the rest confronted an old man on his homestead's front porch. He squinted and leaned closer to the windshield. The old man seemed to edge a hand into one of his tattered robe's tears, right on top of what looked like a bump. Almost as if...\n\nThe driver nudged his friend. "Vasily, I-"\n\n"-and it's not like they have something to threaten us with, now do they.

"Vodka of course! From the Grand Marshal's collection I heard."\n\nWere it possible, the Marshal's frown sank deeper into his jowls. "Then drink it. Or will you continue wasting my time?"\n\n"Mikhail, Mikhail, Mikhail," Ieronim chided, slinging an arm around his shoulder. "You do know what today is, right?"\n\n"I've better matters to attend to than babysitting drunken hooligans." Tukhachevsky glared at Ieronim as he brushed the arm off, before turning to the doorway. "Now if you will excuse me-"\n\n"These drunken hooligans are watching, Comrade Marshal." Ieronim gestured at the room. "Or do you not have an image to uphold?" The Marshal glanced back and met his officers' gazes, staring as gazelles do at an oncoming truck. Already he regretted ever being lured to their little party - but no matter. He didn't say no to Ieronim's last question, after all.\n\nSo Tukhachevsky swiped the bottle clean off his subordinate's hands and raised it high above his head. His gaze swept through the room so to meet all twenty-seven pairs of eyes within. "Look closely, children," the Red Army's finest general boomed. "For the first and last time - this is how a man of the October Revolution handles his vodka!"\n\nHalf a liter of Russian spirit disappeared into his gullet in less than ten seconds."

 WRS.31.d: ""To good health!" toasted Alexander Yakovlev, a shot glass upraised. Glass clinked against glass. "And to you," said Marshal Georgy Zhukov, before quaffing his shot - and almost toppling over his seat. Eyes flashing as he caught his breath, Zhukov turned to Yakovlev with a grin. "You've fine taste in vodka, Comrade Yakovlev. Hits and burns just the right way. Is this really the same swill the Red Army provisions?"\n\n"Not at all, Comrade Marshal." Yakovlev held their dull vodka bottle up, scratches and blurred spots glinting against the overhead lamp's harsh glare. "It's from a brewer just outside Ukhta. Fine man making his ends meet with a wife and three children. I felt myself obliged to recompense his work; hence, the bottle we're imbibing."\n\n"With brew this strong he can teach our own a thing or ten! I'll have some of my men fetch several barrels tomorrow afternoon."\n\nThe office fell silent as Yakovlev's cheer faded. "Ah... That is..." He cleared his throat, affixing Zhukov with a stare that didn't quite meet his own. "I'm afraid this bottle is all he can make for now, Comrade Marshal. The war has been harsh on his grains and potatoes."\n\n"Is that so..." Both men lapsed into thought. Ukhta's outskirts were impregnable from bandit raids; the Marshal himself saw to that. Any incursion from the larger warlords would have been stymied long before they reach his sector's capital. Perhaps he had an inkling of the true causes of this brewer's plight. Then again, perhaps not - for the war effort's sake. "Well, some other time then," Zhukov decided.\n\nFor some reason, Yakovlev shook a little bit less from where he sat."

Many fear the day the hero of West Russia is confined to bedrest until his passing - not simply out of concern for the man's health, but also for the bedlam that may yet ensue after his funeral.\n\nFor at it stands, there are two contenders laying claim to Grand Marshal Yegorov's legacy: Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Georgy Zhukov. For all that they are each other's polar opposites in many respects - philosophies, temperament, methods - the Front's two greatest generals are also each other's equals, least of all in skill. A stalemate such as this will only be resolved by beings greater than mortal men.\n\nThus have the fates, in all their omniscience, chosen..."

 WRS.38.t: "Beneath Their Notice"
 WRS.38.d: "Raskalov Bogdan Anatolievich was doing his regular duties as the janitor of Floor 7 of the WRRF Central Committee Headquarters in the Arkhangelsk Oblast when he began to hear very loud murmuring originating from one of the doors. Floor 7, officially a floor for mid-level bureaucrats, was unofficially the dumping ground of every fuck up in the WRRF too well connected to by thrown out but not useful enough to justify moving up in the Committee. That was alright for Raskalov, who enjoyed the bitter conversations he could hear, which were always entertaining to hear.\n\nBut this was not one of those conversations. This one was a solemn discussion between men who seemed to have something a bit above bitterness to chew on for once.\n\n"How long do we have?"\n\n"If projections are right? Six months, max."\n\n"And they won't be."\n\n"Ammo's gonna run out first, so it'll make us easy picks for bandits."\n\n"Good God."\n\nThe voices seemed to stop then, followed by what sounded like sobbing.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Raskalov should have felt like panicking. He should have felt a pit in his stomach, the horror rising in his body as the thought of his impending starvation and death.\n\nBut he didn't. For he knew someone who was... not well known in polite society. A guy who knew a guy who knew a guy, who would be more than willing to reward him for this information. Who would be willing to take him in while they lynched these little bastards.\n\nRaskalov smiled, and returned to cleaning the floor."

 WRS.39.t: "Greeting the Butcher"
 WRS.39.d: "The uneducated observer might assume that there is no use for diplomacy between warlord states. They are hard places, ruled by hard men who take what they want by force. Shouldn't diplomacy be pointless, a vestigial construct of a civilized era? The warlord thinks very differently about the situation. When the front lines are fluid, and alliances form and break with equal speed, active diplomacy is the difference between ruling fat and happy, and being filled with more bullet holes than healthy. As such, Andrey Grechko, chief diplomat of the WRRF, was constantly busy.\n\nGrechko hated this part. His job was never fun, but visiting Vorkuta was a hellish journey, through brutal winters and mosquito-filled summers, all to reach Russia's largest gulag. Finally, on a particularly cold night, he and his guard detail waited impatiently over coffee for the commandant to open up and let them in. After hours of sitting and shivering, they heard a voice from the other side. "Marshal Grechko, is that you?" It was the commandant himself.\n\n"Good God, Vasily, let us in!" Grechko's chattering teeth were nearly audible.\n\n"The terms first, thank you. I hear that you'd like us to increase coal shipments. We do need something in return, you know." Grechko racked his brain for things he could promise in exchange for coal, and more importantly entry. Guns? Refused, Blokhin had plenty. Oil? The gulag had all the energy it could ever want. Men? Those always in sharp demand, and the WRRF did have a glut of prisoners. Blokhin seemed to agree, because he gave the signal for his men to open up almost immediately.\n\n"Would you have let us freeze to death?" said Grechko. Blokhin declined to answer. Evidently the most prolific executioner in history wouldn't have balked at a few more deaths."

 WRS.89.d: "If one did not know the great men of Russian aerospace engineering, one could be forgiven. After all, very little of that engineering had been conducted in previous years. But those years were over, and as one of those great men, Pavel Sukhoi would work to make his mark.\n\nSukhoi had despaired for years at the state of Russia, but with the return of proper socialist government, he was eager to advance his ideas and help build what he considered an ideal state. Which, to him, meant skies filled with jet-powered aircraft. All too often, however, he had to explain his ideas to lesser men.\n\nThe young engineer, newly educated but with a history of loyalty to the nation from a young age, had been working on a design for a long-range jet-powered bomber. Russia naturally needed strategic capability if it was to reclaim its natural role as a great power, and this Sukhoi was content with. He was not content, with the design.\n\nThe stabilizer the young engineer had designed was wholly unacceptable, the configuration of the control surfaces far too inadequate to provide a pilot with anything other than basic capability. A combat aircraft required more than that, much more, and he would communicate that fact. Regardless of how insistent he needed to be.\n\nSukhoi knew, deep down, that the engineer was not acting out of malice, but of simple inexperience. Apart from himself and vanishingly few others, Russians had not designed novel aircraft in many years. And so, after this design was corrected, he resolved to work to instruct this engineer, and others, on proper design.\n\nRussia would again have a grand air fleet. And if he had anything to say about it, it would be composed of the best-designed craft possible."

A modest pile of cigarettes guarded by two queens and seven diamonds laid between them all.\n\n"I'll raise you three cigarettes." said Sashura, tossing them into the pot. He pulled a fourth out of his jacket and stuck it in his teeth before lighting it. He breathed in deeply and blew a stream of smoke directly into Peter's face.\n\n"Fuck off!" coughed Peter, waving away the smoke with his king of spades and ace of hearts. "What's your issue? Why the fuck are you here?" He threw in three of his own cigarettes. "Call."\n\n"Why are any of us here?" asked Andrei with genuine curiosity. "I call and raise by 2." he said, gently pushing five cigarettes across the floor.\n\nSashura shrugged. "Dunno. I just am." He took another drag. "I fold." He discarded his cards, keeping their faces to the ground.\n\n"I'm here to fight for Russia." said Peter. "Obviously. What other reason would you have to join the army?" He lifted his hand to review his cards and glanced at Andrei. "I fold. You're not taking my last cigarettes."\n\nAndrei smiled and gathered his prize into his hands. He picked out the cleanest one and bit into it. He leaned over to Sashura, who quickly set it ablaze, pouring nicotine and warmth into his friend's lungs."

Ustinov snapped to attention, while Uboerevich simply nodded. "Major-General Ustinov and I were inspecting the troops, as it were."\n\n"These men are undisciplined." Mikhail scowled as he watched the so-called platoon. Marching in lockstep? Interpretive dance aside, "Stumbling" was a better term. Tukhachevsky marched smartly down the hill, barking "Attention!"\n\nThe men dragged their feet as they rose. The drill instructor did something like a salute, but not. "Comrade Tukhachevsky." The man's smile withered at the Marshal's gaze. "Your name?"\n\n"Er - Antonin, sir. Sergeant Antonin Orlov -" "Private Orlov, fall in line." The man, mouth open, started to speak - "Now. Private."\n\nTukhachevsky shook his head as Orlov fell in. "The Red Army. The pride of the Union, the sword of the revolution - reduced to this. Pathetic." The Marshal's glare alone was enough to freeze the men where they stood. "You will address me as Marshal. You will follow every order I give without question. I will put you through hell and back, and you will learn to thank me for it. Am I understood?" "Yes, sir!" The men shouted, meekly.\n\n"It's a start." Tukhachevsky pointed at the field. "Run. All of you, twenty times around the field. Now." A shocked silence - then they burst into sprints, like dominoes falling.\n\nHe gave them a ten-second lead.

 WRS_power_struggle.2.desc: "Taken from Chapter III, Page 204 of "The Structure of the Militia Army in Operation Suvorov" by Mikhail Tukhachevsky\n\n"The fault for the operation's failure can be put solely on the shoulders of two men: Mikhail Suslov and Georgy Zukhov. While the Front was struggling its hardest and made great gains, Suslov had been plotting its demise since the beginning, anticipating for the perfect moment for his betrayal. And while the true men of the Red Army put everything they had into the Greatest Battle for Russia, Zhukov showed the greatest immaturity and made numerous anticipated strategic blunders.\n\n"That wretched Suslov could perhaps be considered Russia's greatest traitor. During the greatest test of Russian courage, as the Front had to evacuate in the face of renewed Hunnic offensive, Suslov chose not to fight for the Motherland, he chose to betray us. Biding his time until we were vulnerable, he and his co-conspirators attempted to coup our rightful government. Luckily, his attempts were thwarted, but his scheme still cost us any chance of keeping the Front together and allowed it to dissolve into reactionary warlords.\n\n"Zhukov's attitude towards the war was one of immaturity with a healthy amount of misconduct. His inability to put aside political differences and disappointing attitude in battle made him the laughingstock of officers and soldiers alike. What actually cost us the battle, however, was Zhukov's indifference towards strategy. His strategic incompetence meant that men were applied incorrectly, costing lives and entire battles. If only Zhukov had paid attention in officer school, perhaps I'd be writing victory memoirs in Moscow rather than ones of defeat in Arkhangelsk.""

 WRS_power_struggle.3.desc: "He stepped into the room, ready to speak to the old man. He had been summoned to the Front headquarters for a regular debriefing, and, like dinner with in-laws, he knew conversation with the ancient general would always end in large bouts of screaming, fighting, and both leaving angered and disgusted. This time, Tukhachevsky hoped that at least he would be able to keep things from getting out of hand long enough to convince Yegorov that perhaps he wasn't such a bad man for a successor.\n\n"You took your time, you're eight minutes late." Yegorov said driely. They were not off to a good start, and he knew that Yegorov would not make it easy to be friendly.\n\n"My apologies Marshal," Tukhachevsky said biting his lip, "what did you call me here to discuss?" This nice act was getting very hard to keep up.\n\n"I would like your input on strategic decisions for the Onegan campaign you suggested," Tukhachevsky felt set up, tactics and strategy always meant fights when it came to him and Yegorov, "I think we should hit them with artillery for a short time, before doing several massed attacks on their border posts."\n\nTukhachevsky knew he was testing him, but could not hold himself back, "Are you sure? That would give them time to prepare. I say we position our men in hidden positions nearby, doing a short mortar attack before ordering massed offensives." This had been a test, but Tukhachevsky would not back down.\n\nThe argument continued to go back and forth, back and forth, with voices being raised in pitch and volume every second. Yegorov accused Tukhachevsky of being out of order for his post, and Tukhachevsky said he wouldn't have to be this way if Yegorov wasn't such a bad strategist. Tukhachevsky stormed out seconds later. The meeting had gone exactly as expected, and the only winner had been Zhukov."

Listening very carefully, all could see him relax, every clenched muscle unclenching, every pressure point releasing. The man on the other end waited for an answer, and after what seemed like quite a long time, he was given one.\n\n"Good, Tukhachevsky will be impressed." The messenger stood up and gave the good news: the operation had been an overwhelming success. Soldiers of the Front had routed Onegan border guards and military units, succeeding in capturing border posts, men, and materiel with little loss of life of their own.\n\nThe tension evaporated, as if all of a sudden a great, heavy fog had lifted over the operations room. Many tried to hide relieved sighs, but almost all gave in to this good news. A quiet murmuring broke out between grinning, wide-eyed faces, but was quickly silenced as the man himself stood up.\n\nRising, he revealed a vintage bottle of vodka, one he had kept underneath his desk since the Front had been betrayed and defeated, as well as many cups, one for each man in the room. As he poured it into each glass, without looking up he said, "Comrades, it is my honor to stand in front of those that have stood by the Motherland at every turn, and now with a great victory I believe that our efforts now pay off.

Those around him shifted the gaze of their gaunt faces to their feet, all silently sharing the same fear. One could hear the roar of artillery through the operator's headset, a terrible backdrop to a terrible night, but still his expression didn't change. Choked by the bitter taste of bad news, he couldn't respond to the voice on the other end of the line, and as the caller waited for an answer that would never come, the numb operator took off his headset.\n\nChoking on his words and stumbling to his feet, the unfortunate messenger recanted what he had been told. "It would appear resistance was unexpectedly heavy sir. Field hospitals are over capacity and not a single objective was met. I'm sorry, Sir."\n\nIf the room had been filled with tension before, it was now overflowing with it. Every officer sat silently, a high-pitched ring filling everyone's ears as they stared dead ahead of them at the man who sat in the middle.\n\nSlowly, Tukhachevsky rose from his chair as a symphony of creaks abounded. As he opened his mouth, no words came out no matter how hard he tried to force them. Every moment as heavy as an hour, he dismissed everyone in attendance. As they silently shuffled out of the room, he unveiled a bottle of vodka he had promised to only open in case of victory. As he sat in the, he made his way through the entire bottle before an aide suggested quietly that he go to sleep. There would be no celebrating today, and he had many days worth of fallout to deal with. He needed a good night's sleep."

Understrength regiments, not enough guns, roads too muddy for use, rails unmaintained. It would seem that every way something could've gone wrong, it had.\n\nLying back in his old leather chair, alone in his room, Tukhachevsky breathed a long sigh. Not one of relief, but one of despair and worry. There had been a lot riding on this, and he had campaigned long and hard promising that a strategic operation against Onega would not only prove the Front's military capabilities but win recognition and legitimacy within Russia once again. Especially since the War, victories had been few and far between and this one was as much for morale as it was for minor gains on the Onegan border...\n\nHe knew that, as he spoke, Zhukov was relishing in his complete and utter defeat of himself. This was the ultimate embarrassment. Not only had it failed, but it had exposed to the rest of the world that the Front was so incompetent it couldn't even launch an offensive, much less a successful one.\n\nAll across the Front murmurs over the occurrences of the day were spoken simultaneously.

His story was one of nothing but loyalty and love for his nation.\n\nCaught by the headlights of the car in the middle of some late-night reminiscing, he scrambled to his feet to meet the car. Talking to the driver and his passenger, they appeared to be on some official duty, talking smoothly and showing him their Red Army identifications. Both of high rank, higher than his, he felt no authority to do anything but wave them along, his half-closed eyes red with fatigue.\n\nWhile they seemed suave and confident, as these agents knew all too well the ramifications of being caught working for their own government against their own government. Behind their facade of confidence and indifference was fear, one that kept their hands clenched and sweating.\n\nWhile to them their guilt seemed all too apparent, to the elderly and indifferent border guard that stood in front of them they were nothing but men more important than him on business more important than he needed to know about. While they seemed a bit strange in demeanour, he knew that questioning the motives of men who had the power to not only get him removed from his post but removed from the Front's army.\n\nAnd so, with the wave of his hand, the two men rolled away just as they arrived, their motives completely foreign and unknown to him."

Having started their journey some miles away in a nearby village posing as inspectors, they had backpacked to the location of Zhukov's oil wells using information from the inside to avoid any prying eyes of guard outposts, checkpoints, or even hunters. Appearing in the attire of the traitorous ROA, any who saw them would've put their mission at risk and it was important that they remained completely unseen until they could be misidentified as foreign agents.\n\nTaking the bolt-cutters from his bag, the two men waited until a patrol had passed to make their play.

The explosions caused a panic among the well, leading to on-site fire services to put it out.

His mind had gone through all the possibilities he could imagine, from workers complaining to an accident, or perhaps he even held out hope that perhaps it would be good news.\n\nAfter several minutes of waiting, the manager appeared from the door, looking as exhausted as he sounded. "I think you'll want to see this." Already sick of waiting, Zhukov decided to humor the man, but his anxiety and anger was only rising every second, now reaching fever-pitch levels. Walking first through cold steel corridors, every step made the butterflies in his stomach flutter even more, and by the time he left the building his heart had sunk.\n\nLooking out across the wells, Zhukov felt the anxiety turn to rage as his face contorted into a scowl, and from a scowl into a shout. Out of the many dozens of wells, many were noticeably damaged, and of those some were completely destroyed. Knowing the importance of the quotas placed on his oil production and how tied to his reputation they were, he let it all out on the poor station manager before letting the entire maintenance and guard team have it as well. With spit flying from his mouth, all who were there stood silently as he roared.\n\nZhukov knew he had been bested, and he swore to god it was Tukhachevsky's doing, but he could not prove it.

The truth was, it was snow, snow, and then more snow.\n\nThe temperature was bitingly cold, and that was not helped by the fact they had to scale the same mountainside everyday, walk past the same damn trees everyday, see the same damn animals, and get home with the same damn numb toes. However, Nikolai had just found something. Looking down in a small ravine to catch his breath after a relatively tough climbing episode, he had seen an object covered in snow and surrounded by ice. Denigin was beside him in seconds, panting to ask what he had found. Nikolai descended the cliff of the ravine, slipping on a rock that had actually been snow and falling back-first on the ground. Though hurt, he couldn't wait and forced himself to his knees, crawling to the strange object.\n\nHe wiped the snow off, and sure enough, it was a man. Denigin, having found a long way around bringing him down, arrived some minutes later as Nikolai closely examined the bodies he had found. Two, each wearing the insignia of Vlasov's ROA, were dead at the bottom of a mountain ravine that they figured they likely had tried to go into for warmth, before dying of exposure during the night. Each agent took a man's corpse over their shoulder and painfully, slowly, got back to their car.\n\nThe men working at the SMERSH headquarters did full background checks on the men. Working currently as low-ranking Tukhachevsky associates, both were found to have ROA connections and one was a rehabilitated member of the group. The case was closed. It was a ROA job."

 WRS_power_struggle.100.t: "A Shanty Crew"
 WRS_power_struggle.100.desc: "Zhukov was seated on a short wooden stool, a light creak yelped from the floor every time he shuffled around. He held a lukewarm glass of scotch in his shaky hand. Around him, the jeers and laughter of his crew, his men, his only friends as some would say. He took another sip to steady his nerves before observing the crowd.\n\nTo his left, Sergey Akhromeyev, a man of steel in his own right. Memories of conducting battle in the harshest of conditions with this man flashed before Zhukov's eyes. Suppressing revolts, the firing and cracking of rifles. Akhromeyev had been by his side through it all, and still more. On many battlefields he was the devil himself, the sheer whisper of his name sending bandits, Germans and raiders alike scurrying away without a single shot being fired. On others he was the slaughterer of hundreds, the harbinger of death and bloodshed from the end of a barrel. But tonight, he was a drunk man falling off his chair from laughing.\n\nIn front of line of sight was Nikolay Ryzhkov. Zhukov had always seen him as meek, well tempered and shy, not one for the battlefield. But it was in no doubt he knew how to carry himself through politics. Many a meeting and shouting match had been settled by the cool, level voice of Ryzhkov. So many decisions had been made with Ryzhkov's counsel, always informing Zhukov of the next avenue of opportunity. If there ever was a politician in Russia, Ryzhkov carried the full package. But tonight, he was hunched over on the table, passed out from one too many shots.\n\nAnd finally, to his right Alexander Yakovlev. This man was always a mystery, in truth. Zhukov was not sure how or why he had gotten to where he is now, but all he could discern was that he is a man of his word, one of honour, and that itself is respectable enough, especially in times like these. Always behind Zhukov's back, ready to take charge of a meeting or spearhead debate. He was likely the most intelligent of the bunch, but he didn't show it. But tonight, he was engaged in a fierce drunken debate with Akhromeyev regarding the attractiveness of old women. Yes, this was Zhukov's motley crew of men. Though many challenges are ahead of them, he will make sure they see themselves through, as they have many times before. God knows they must."
 WRS_power_struggle.100.a: "The boys know a good time, at least."

 WRS_power_struggle.101.t: "A Swell Meeting"
 WRS_power_struggle.101.desc: "Walking in through the doorway of Yegorov's office, Zhukov felt as nervous as he had the first time he had done it. This door always had a feeling of grandeur to it, like the conversation he is about to hold will decide the fate of many thousands of lives; and, more often than not, it did.\n\n"Ah! Zhukov, I'm glad you made it, come in, come in, have a seat." Yegorov rasped out as soon as he stepped into the room. His health was not getting any better, and it showed by the day. His haggard old cough seemed to grow weaker every time he saw him. It was clear he was not long for this world, not anymore.\n\n"Yes, well, I'm sure you know why I'm here by now, sir." Zhukov nonchalantly let out as he took a rest on the surprisingly cushioning yet firm chair. It was likely several decades old, but it showed no sign of wear. Expertly made, surely.\n\n"Of course, you've brought the reports?" Yegorov questioned. Zhukov was about to answer when a coughing spell suddenly struck, Yegorov put a shaky arm to his mouth and doubled over on the desk.\n\n"Sir?" Zhukov instinctively raised a hand to his commander, but Yegorov swatted it away and sat up fast.\n\n"Mmergh, it's nothing. Carry on with your report." Zhukov had made this monthly report hundreds of times before, and reading the words he never once had to glance at the page. The content of the meeting mattered little anymore, simply the circumstances. As Zhukov said his goodbyes and stepped from the room, it was clear it had gone well. Yegorov was evidently pleased to see Zhukov, more so than he ever did old Tukhachevsky. Zhukov almost laughed as he strode down the hallway. How could he possibly lose out with favor so aligned for him?"
 WRS_power_struggle.101.a: "Too good to be true."

 WRS_power_struggle.102.t: "Suspicion in the Highest Places"
 WRS_power_struggle.102.desc: "By now, it was clear a power struggle had begun amongst the highest ranks of the entire West Russian Revolutionary Front. Espionage, distrust and contention ruled every day of every week of every month. Every peasant who existed under the red banner knew it would all come to a head eventually, but all they could now is keep their heads low and hope it does not boil over. But it takes more to win a struggle than just playing to favors and getting on the good side of people, far more, and Zhukov knew this better than anyone. It took some more... unscrupulous activities to bring defeat to your enemies, and that was simply what it took. As such, it should be that some light spying be conducted. Under the cover of night, an order went out. SMERSH agents unloaded into libraries, filing offices and history retention centers. All of them had one goal on their mind, and that was Tukhachevsky. More specifically, his past.\n\nIt is no secret the Red Napoleon is a man with a dark past at best, and many tell the tale of violence and suppression under his boot. But to truly upend his position, some real dirt must be found, not just the account of scared shitless potato farmers and circulating rumors as old as the air they travel on. And so it was that file cabinets were raided and torn asunder, libraries pillaged for information even loosely related to the man in question. For weeks on, agents would be hunched over their desks, studying and peering at incriminating document after incriminating document. Something would eventually come up, all it took was a little bit of time.\n\nAnd so it was that Zhukov waited patiently. He smiled knowing he would finally have something to wipe that stupid, smug grin off Tukhachevsky's face once and for all. He wouldn't know what hit him."
 WRS_power_struggle.102.a: "Well, something has to come up, first."

 WRS_power_struggle.103.t: "Conspiracy in the Records"
 WRS_power_struggle.103.desc: "Zhukov was beginning to get frustrated, waiting so patiently. It had been weeks since he sent out the order, yet nothing had yet returned. Not even a murmur about some big find, a smoking gun, nothing! But he knew it had to be there somewhere, somewhere among the thousands of paper trails, document boxes and file cabinets. It had to be. And so they pressed on. The SMERSH agents were really getting quite tired, but this was their job after all. Or, at least they were told. As long as they kept hunched over their desks, magnifying glass kept sturdy over the fading ink, they would find something. So the work went on and on.\n\nPaper trails which were first said to be promising were found to be nothing but dead ends, brick wall after brick wall. Agents were up so late into the night, doing work they shouldn't dare to be doing, not behind the Red Napoleon's back, that their wives began to worry. But it HAD to be there. Eventually, on one especially cramped, humid day at the office, a worker's hand excitedly shot up. He grasped in his perspiring fist a document, the end all be all, or so it was in his bloodshot eyes. The work foreman came over and snatched it away. The paper travelled up through the ranks, read by many eyes and promised to be greater than it had the last time. Eventually, Zhukov held it in his hands, peering at it closely, rereading some paragraphs a million times over.\n\nYes, something had been there."
 WRS_power_struggle.103.a: "They found something huge."
 WRS_power_struggle.103.b: "They found almost nothing at all."
 WRS_power_struggle.103.c: "They found something mediocre."

 WRS_power_struggle.104.t: "The Smoking Gun"
 WRS_power_struggle.104.desc: "It had been there. Oh lord, had it been there. The smoking gun. The incriminating document, the convicting letter, the end all be all that would finally drag Tukhachevsky's slimy hide to a firing line. Zhukov had not been this giddy since the West Russian War. Not only was there one convicting paper, but a dozen. The hard effort of the SMERSH agents had finally paid off, and paid so handsomely had it.\n\nYegorov by now was a weak man, his lungs failing him and his voice growing more weak by the day. But this morning, it was a thunderous boom that echoed across the office, the surrounding field and the whole of Archangelesk.\n\n"Tukhachevsky! Where the fuck are you, you lying, backstabbing cheating bastard!" It appeared that Yegorov had not quite liked the smoking gun as much as Zhukov had, but that was the best part of the whole ordeal. Documents which were buried under so many goddamn waste baskets worth of fodder were dug up and showed something that could make even Yegorov storm around.\n\nTukhachevsky had moved supplies, supplies that could've won battles, won them the entire war, from Yegorov's army to his own during the advance on Moscow. This action is something short of sheer treason in Yegorov's eyes, but only barely so! Tukhachevsky would inevitably receive a berating of a lifetime once he was eventually found cowering in some place in the city, and Zhukov can only sit by the sidelines and laugh! His gambit had paid off after all, and by God, was he now a rich man."
 WRS_power_struggle.104.a: "Well boys, we got him!"

 WRS_power_struggle.105.t: "Nothing Concrete"
 WRS_power_struggle.105.desc: "It seems the "smoking gun" Zhukov had all so wished for did not exist after all. The documents brought up so high were really just various small, insignificant mishaps and actions which happened on a daily basis. The only incriminating reports found were those of the cruel day at Tambov, where Tukhachevsky slaughtered dozens, but this is already well known, a permanent stain on his otherwise proud reputation.\n\nAnd now, Zhukov slinks away into his study. The SMERSH agents pack up their operations, disappointed beyond measure that despite all their hard work nothing could be found. Yet, even more bad news arrives to deepen the blow. A little birdy told Tukhachevsky all about just what Zhukov had done, what he had the SMERSH agents do, and he is not happy. Not. One. Bit. Behind locked doors, he screams for Zhukov's head so he can punt it into the White Sea. The agents who conducted the digging found and thrown into the deepest cellars, miles beneath Arkhangelsk.\n\nOf course, old Tukhachevsky will have to wait on these wishes just for another while. Despite the fact Zhukov found nothing truly big, nobody is happy with Tukhachevsky by any means. It's always believed he has done quite a few shady things, and this only piles onto the rumors. After all, there is always the next opportunity to stab at the other."
 WRS_power_struggle.105.a: "The struggle goes on."

 WRS_power_struggle.106.t: "A Flimsy Paper Trail"
 WRS_power_struggle.106.desc: "Nothing. Nothing was found. Nothing at all, literally zero incriminating evidence. All that was brought up was a few little anecdotes about abuses in Tukhachevsky's prison camps. Things already in the public eye are bigger than this. Zhukov locked himself away in his study for the day, smoking through his pipe. How could he be so stupid to not read more closely? He let such a perfect opportunity slip clean through his fingers, and just like that, Tukhachevsky keeps his stupid smug grin the whole way through.\n\nZhukov had decided this must be buried. Buried so far underground nobody will ever find it. Cover up his tracks, whiteout a few names, and nothing about a covert investigation into his rival will ever be found. He had to seriously rethink his strategies in the coming days, as it is sure Tukhachevsky has some devilish trick up his sleeve, just like Zhukov had planned to play on him. As Zhukov fumed in his study, Tukhachevsky attended a rich banquet with local oil barons. He smiled the whole way through."

 tukha.71.t: "Quick Justice"
 tukha.71.d: "When the time came for the leadership of Komi to be tried, the courthouse was packed. Crowds roared as men and women of importance - or, presumed importance - were shuffled in and out, from politicians to generals to radio hosts. Mikhail Suslov had noticed however, not a single figure who happened to be carted to that podium before him had gained an innocent verdict.\n\nThe first to go had been the rightists. He said nothing, even as Gumilyov bid an affable goodbye to everyone, nor did he flinch as the crowds drowned out Shafarevich's attempt at a defense, and he didn't let loose a chuckle as Taboritsky was dragged out in record time; his "defense" beginning and ending in a single phrase: "Had the Germans killed every last one of you..."\n\nSeveral would swear that as Ivan Serov was dragged out with eyes full of fear, a single small smirk appeared on Suslov's face. The truth was, he was largely preoccupied with his mortality. An attempt to run would lead to you being shot. An attempt to plead your case would end with you being shot. Tukhachevsky had already decided who was "innocent"- Bukharina and Andropov were not pressed into the crowd of leftists, paramilitary members, and others who had been sorted.\n\nA single, small pang of fear hit him, even as his stoic mask belied nothing. He was going to die here. No matter what was said or done. Begging like Voznesensky, being defiant like Stalina and Morozov - not a single way past the Grand Marshal's verdict. As the Center was swept aside and the Left's trials began, the pangs grew.\n\nThe next hour dragged on, as the show continued. The jurors stated a single word, the impassioned prosecutors read their scripts with a driven zeal, and the crowd roared.\n\nThen came his turn, and the pangs subsided. If he was going to die, why give the Grand Marshal an inkling of satisfaction? Mikhail Suslov raised his head high, and spoke one sentence clearly."

 tukha.72.t: "The Church's Schemes"
 tukha.72.d: "In the waning days of the Russians Empire, it had seemed nigh on inconceivable that so religious a people could endorse so heartedly an ideology defined by its hatred of religion. The contradiction between the state atheism of the Soviet Union and its various warlord successor states has been resolved in various ways and in various places. Sometimes by tolerance, sometimes by collaboration, sometimes by heavy handed oppression. Until recently, the West Russian Revolutionary Front had taken the path of least resistance - neglect. So long as the Orthodox churches did not openly challenge the Communist Party, they were free to do as they pleased, although they certainly couldn't expect the privileges and state subsidies of old.\n\nNow with the rise of Grand Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, it seems that the church can no longer expect such benign treatment. These superstitious fools with their talk of "heavenly reward" and "children of god" are nothing more than charlatans, who seek to weaken the hearts of true socialists for their own degenerate passions and pleasures. It is only time that their idols be torn down, their tables of golden lies be turned over, and their false temples be converted into barracks for the people's army.\n\nThose that resist our righteous cleansing will be quickly executed, the others wil spend the rest of their lives in the gulag performing the earthly labor that they had attemtped to escape by claiming heavenly enlightenment."
 tukha.72.a: "Religion is the opiate of the masses."

 tukha.73.t: "The End of the Romanovs"
 tukha.73.d: "Vladimir desperately attempted to hold back his tears as he and his wife wrapped their arms around their daughter's shaking body, sobbing as she had never before between her parents' arms. The basement they were held in was cold, and barren, and wet. Some hut in the middle of nowhere - a few miles away from where the Bolsheviks had captured them as they attempted to flee across the Urals.\n\nHe could hear them talking lowly upstairs, conversing with their commander on a radio. Words he couldn't make out, but the venom in their voices was clear. He was doomed, he knew that - but that wouldn't stop him from praying to God, to every saint he could think of - if he was to die, at least spare his family. Maria's weeping grew ever louder at the sound of boots stomping down wooden stairs.\n\nThe tears flowed freely from his eyes as he brushed Maria's hair. "It will be okay, my sweet." He murmured to his daughter, trying desperately but futilely to keep his voice from quaking. "Father will protect you from the bad men. I promise." He looked up to his wife, eyes red, and opened his mouth to say something - a declaration of love, a farewell, he wasn't sure - but the door burst open, and whatever he was going to say was lost.\n\nSix men entered, weapons in their hands. Maria screamed. Vlad pushed his family behind him. "Please - shoot me if you must - but please, spare th -"\n\nWhen the first bullet hit his chest, he wondered for a brief moment if it was supposed to hurt more. Then the second hit, then the third, and suddenly all he knew was pain. He stumbled backwards, and for those brief moments the only sounds in the world were those of his wife screaming, his daughter crying, and the sounds of guns firing.\n\nHis head hit the stone floor hard, and his vision grew blurry with tears - he couldn't see, but he could hear - he could hear the crying and the screaming until suddenly the world was filled with nothing but bullets; and so ended the crying and screaming. Vlad's world was nothing now but the sounds of his daughter and his wife's bodies hitting the floor. It was the last thing he would ever know."
 tukha.73.a: "Memento Mori."

 tukha.74.t: "Into Thin Air"
 tukha.74.d: "In the West Russian Revolutionary Front's glorious quest for the socialist re-conquest of the Soviet Union we have found ourselves opposed by a great variety of enemy states. Some of these are monsters, madmen, or fascist sympathizers best dealt with by gulag or firing line. A few are a little more complicated. Although quickly and defeated by the Red Army, the Mladorossi represent one of the most challenging cases as we continue our expansion.\n\nAn unholy hybrid of Soviet Socialism with Tsarist silliness, we would have already disposed of these fools if not for their potential use as loyal communist administrators by our state. This motley collection of émigrés, conscripts, and bizarre idealists is certainly many things, but their commitment to a socialist system cannot be doubted, even if only in bastard form. The only question is if we can truly trust these defeated opponents, or if we risk giing our enemies the knife they need to strike us from behind when we're most vulnerable."
 tukha.74.a: "Curious."

 tukha.75.t: "A Red Tatarstan"
 tukha.75.d: "Nasr Rustamov found himself wandering the streets of Kazan. It wasn't too long ago that the Red Army rolled into town and crushed any hope of Tatar independence under the Red jackboot. Nasr was there when the Reds poured over the border, and he made the difficult decision to desert Tatarstan's rag tag army and escape for his hometown while he still had a chance. He sometimes wondered whether or not it would've been better if he had died in the defense of his people.\n\nContinuing his despondent journey down the sidewalk, Nasr noticed a Red Army soldier putting up a Communist propaganda poster on the side of his favorite restaurant. Drawing closer, he noticed that the soldier bore a familiar face indeed. "Mahmud? Is that you?"\n\nNasr's call caused the soldier to turn to him, confirming his suspicions. "Nasr! It's good to see you, friend! I was beginning to think you had died back in Arsk."\n\n"It's good to see you too, Mahmud, but what are you doing in that uniform? You never struck me as a communist."\n\n"Well, as it happens, our new overlords are in need of troops. After we surrendered, they offered most of us a place in the Red Army. I figured, why not?"\n\nThis came as a surprise to Nasr. If the Red Army had no qualms about recruiting Tatars, perhaps the civilian governors were of a similar mind? Sharing farewells with his friend, Nasr went inside to grab a bite to eat. He remained suspicious of the Communists, but began to consider that, perhaps, it was not the worst possible outcome."
 tukha.75.a: "The revolution comes to Tatarstan."

 tukha.76.t: "Hunting the Imams"
 tukha.76.d: "Shagit glanced at his watch as the truck pulled up before the Tukayev Mosque. On his orders, the men readied their rifles and waited expectantly to storm out the back. Only this morning they had received the orders from command to take the building and arrest the Imams. Rumour had it that they had been preaching opposition to the newly reestablished Soviet state, spreading anti-communist propaganda amongst their dwindling flock. A decisive move against them would put an end to that sort of talk.\n\nThe soldiers burst down the door of the Old Mosque, Shagit at their head. To their surprise, the building was deserted, stripped, and empty. The Imams must have been tipped off. The men lowered their rifles as Shagit proceeded to poke around the building. Memories of coming here with his father and brothers, all long dead, filled him as he looked around the empty rooms. His childhood in Ufa, long before he went to join the army, before the Great Patriotic War, felt like another lifetime. For decades he had given himself fully to the Soviet Union, forgetting the life he left behind.\n\nGlancing again at his watch, Shagit ordered the men to return to base. He would follow shortly. Though confused, they obeyed, and soon he was alone with his memories and thoughts. The Imams would still have to be hunted down and captured. If he did not do it, someone else would. That knowledge did not make it feel any more wrong.\n\nHe once again looked at his watch. It was just after 2 in the afternoon, time for the Asr prayer. Usually the mosque would be filled with men praying, but the calls to prayer had not wrung out from the minarets of Ufa since the arrival of the Red Army. Shagit removed his shoes, carefully placing them by the door, laid out a mat, faced Mecca, kneeled, and prayed."

 tukha.77.t: "Scouring the Records"
 tukha.77.d: "The filing cabinet was old, pre-war, dented in a hundred places and just beginning to show hints of rust. Looking at it, sitting meekly in the corner of a room in Bukharin's old Samara bunker, where Vlasov and his traitors once held court, you couldn't tell the terrors it held. When the Grand Marshal's troops stormed the bunker, fighting the ROA room to room, they almost passed it over completely. Days after it was discovered, it was in Arkhangelsk, where the officers of the SMERSH poured over its contents with a fine toothed comb. The personnel files of the officialdom and bureaucracy of the ROA were a fine catch, if only to keep an eye on their former membership in future. It did not take them long to discover many of the documents contained details of a more sinister nature.\n\nAll of them were collaborators, the personnel in the files. That much was assumed by their membership to the ROA. Some were merely that - defectors from the Red Army who joined Vlasov at German prisoner of war camps, choosing treason rather than death by starvation in the camps. Their files contained little more than a list of battles they fought at during the war.\n\nThe others were different: Former SS members responsible for acts of unspeakable brutality against Belarusian civilians during Operation Cottbus. Officers who participated in massacres at the notorious Gully of Petrushino. Informants who handed over thousands to the gas chambers. One woman, Antonia Makarova, now living out her retirement in Samara after working for years as a secretary for the ROA, was responsible for the murder of some 1500 partisans and their family members during the war. She used a machine gun to mow them down, 27 at a time."
 tukha.77.a: "Have them shot."

 tukha.78.t: "Expelling the Settlers"
 tukha.78.d: "The young officer looked nervous as he stood upon the cart before the settlers, huddled around in the cold morning breeze. He looked around at his men, who surrounded the villagers with their rifles drawn. Steeling himself, he reached into his jacket and pulled out the order, placing it before him to read aloud.\n\n"By decree of Comrade Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Grand Marshal of the Soviet Union, all persons of Finnish nationality residing within the territory of the Soviet Union are hereby exiled from the territory of the Soviet Union."\n\nA gasp went up in the crowd, though one could tell many had been expecting this. The Red Army soldiers shifted anxiously in place, their guns still trained on the enemy. He continued.\n\n"All property, lands, and assets processed currently by persons of Finnish nationality residing within the territory of the Soviet Union is also hereby confiscated."\n\nSome of the Finns began to anger, hurling abuse at the officer. As they did so, he raised his voice, finishing off the rest of the order.\n\n"All persons of Finnish nationality are to present themselves to Soviet authorities for immediate deportation and transportation to the Finnish border. All those who resist these decrees will be met with swift and immediate retribution by the people of the Soviet Union and their Red Army."\n\nNow the Finns were truly incensed. A woman in the crowd picked up a rock, hurling it at the young officers head. He ducked, the rock narrowly missing its target. Before anybody could utter a word, the soldiers were on her, beating her and others in the crowd mercilessly with the butts of their rifles. There was little resistance after that."
 tukha.78.a: "Send them Packing."

 tukha.79.t: "A New Refugee Crisis"
 tukha.79.d: "Aatto clasped his cigarette between his cupped hands and took a long drag as he watched the procession of refugees flow slowly past him. They went back as far as the eye could see, trailing off into the white, yawning expanse of Russia. He was grateful for the warm tingle of vodka in his belly and the small border guardhouse that blocked the worst of the biting wind. The marchers in the macabre parade before him were not so lucky.\n\nShuffling down the road, they looked a haggard, desperate lot. Some had been walking for weeks to reach the border, carrying everything they owned on their backs or in carts, on horses, anything they could find. More than a few of them carried the bodies of loved ones, victims of the Russian cold.\n\nAatto had seen this all before. He had been there in 1929, when the Soviets had deported thousands of Finns from Ingria and settled the east with Russians. Years later, the expelled Ingrians had been followed by the Red Army, streaming across the border to destroy his beloved Finland once and for all.\n\nThat time, the Finns had won. Yet as he looked out past the column of shivering outcasts, towards Russia, terrifying in its boundless immensity, Aatto felt a pang of dread. He feared that like before, the Red Army would march on Finland. And this time, they might finish the job."

 tukha.80.t: "Invincible, and Legendary!"
 tukha.80.d: "Contemporary decades have, in the past, held nothing but despair. The Russian people, so long under siege, were cast adrift. Like a dreidel poised on table's edge, they have toyed with total oblivion. However, through it all, a scant hope has lingered, casting its rare light through the thick dark clouds. Be it an extra ration, a scavenged vehicle, or an unusually quiet sky, the people have found solace in little victories for far too long.\n\nToday however, for the first time since the 50's, the clouds have parted. Sunlight pours through, and the people bask in its glow. The Grand Marshal, long chafing under superiors, incompetents, and opportunists, finds himself validated. Through our dedication to the cause, and innovative theoretical doctrines, we have reigned supreme. Today, we take the first steps towards healing. West Russia is one, invincible, and ready to advance boldly. The wind is strong against the Grand Marshal's back, and under his legendary stewardship, we shall not falter!"

 tukha.81.t: "The Redeemable"
 tukha.81.d: "The Grand Marshal listened to Beethoven's 3rd, one of his favourite symphonies, as he absentmindedly flitted through the letter from Svetlana Bukharina. There was a similar one from Yuri Andropov on his desk, but he wouldn't even bother glancing over that one. Andropov would follow where Bukharina went, and if Bukharina declared her undying faith in Tukhachevsky and the restored Soviet Union, he would follow suit.\n\nHe didn't much care what platitudes and promises of loyalty Bukharina had to offer either, truth be told. He could have had both of them executed for merely being members of Suslov's little clique in Komi, and they both knew it. Anything they said was simply an attempt to save their own skins, to avoid being shot and dumped in a ditch like Suslov, Gumilyov, Taboritsky, Voznesensky, Stalina, Morozov, and all the other traitors and reactionaries.\n\nHe had already made up his mind. Having the daughter of Bukharin in his camp would help bring the last remaining vestiges of the old Soviet regime onto his side, and win him the loyalty of the people of Komi, who adored Bukharina. Whatever problems she might cause in the future were a small price to pay for that.\n\nAs he tossed her letter to the side, he thought to the future. Finally the great wounds that tore apart the Soviet Union could heal, and united in spirit and purpose, the Soviet people could once again turn to face their true enemies. And he would be there, leading them to victory. First to Moscow, then Germania, and then beyond."

 tukha.82.t: "Burning the Opiate"
 tukha.82.d: "Old Man Vitaly had been around for a long, long time. He fought in the West Russian War, and before that the Great Patriotic War, and even before that, the Great Civil War for the heart and soul of Russia. He bore scars from a hundred battles and a small collection of medals proudly adorned his jacket, including that of a Hero of the Soviet Union, its golden star now rusted and chipped. Some said he was the oldest man in the Red Army, and the young bright faced men who fought under the banner of the Grand Marshal jokingly considered the old officer a good luck charm, though Vitaly protested the childish superstition.\n\nHe remembered life before the Revolution, when the Tsar and the Church ruled by terror in Russia. He remembered the pogroms of 1905, when the priests led the backward masses to kill thousands in the streets under the cry "Kill the Jews!" He remembered the servile superstition of the serfs, who were told by the priests to worship the Tsar as a living god even while their sons were sent to their deaths on the fields of Tannenberg. He remembered the years after October, when the priests had rallied behind the Whites and their foreign allies to surround and starve Russia.\n\nNow, after so many years, they had once more attempted to bring his country under the sway of their foul religion. The Order of Saint George, like all the old institutions of the church, would have to once more be expunged. The Grand Marshal had been correct to choose him for this task. The young officers did not remember. They would be too soft on the priests. He would carry out the new Red Terror with the zealotry of one who remembered the old Russia, who knew that there was no going back."
 tukha.82.a: "Down with God!"

 tukha.83.t: "Out with the Old"
 tukha.83.d: "The posters look striking up upon the walls of Vyatka, their strong colours standing out to the grey drabness of its streets. With the arrival of the Red Army and the vanquishing of the Tsar, the city has been renamed Rykov, after Alexei Rykov, the Old Bolshevik revolutionary. Yet the people still persisted in calling it Vyatka, a pathetic show of reactionary nostalgia for the old regime. The newly reestablished Department for Agitation and Propaganda is here to fix all that.\n\nEverywhere you look, you can see them. The most popular depicts Tsar Vladimir III crawling on the floor like a dog, a leash tied around his neck held by Adolf Hitler. A man once lauded to the people of Rykov as the saviour of Russia is turning into a source of public ridicule. Some of the posters take a more sombre approach. One depicts Boris Smyslovsky, the spymaster of the Okrhana, Vyatka's secret police, as a sinister monster resting over a pile of corpses. The horrors of the Okhrana are well known by the people of Rykov. Another shows a soldier of the Red Army, sword in hand, fighting off a three headed hydra, one head representing Tsarism, another Nazism, and a third the Orthodox Church. The people of Rykov must know that the old order is gone, but that the fight for a free Russia has only just begun."
 tukha.83.a: "In with the new."

 tukha.84.t: "Hell"
 tukha.84.d: "Lieutenant Stepanov didn't consider himself a man with a weak stomach. He was a proud soldier of the Front, a veteran of the Long War, he had seen hundreds of men die, felt the touch of starvation and frostbite, and had come out of it all with what he considered nerves of steel. The perfect soldier. The scene before him made him forget all of that for a moment.\n\nThe first thing he noticed as his unit strode into the surrendering outpost was the smell. He was familiar with the smell of death, but he hadn't ever smelled so much of it. A line of surrendered guards were pushed against the wall by a squad as the rest of the men fanned out into the outpost, although perhaps Slave Pen was a better term.\n\nThe people within barely resembled people at all. Thin, emaciated, they came meekly to Stepanov's squad, hands outstretched weakly, shaking, begging silently for food, for freedom, for sweet release. The cultists at Perm were maniacs, he knew that - but this was a new level of cruelty. He forced himself away from the liberated men and strode towards the line of guards, pulling his Tokarev from its holster.\n\nSome of the guards begged for mercy, saying they were forced to follow orders. Some held their heads high and declared to Stepanov he would meet the same fate some day. Some simply cried.\n\nWhatever the case, they were all shot."
 tukha.84.a: "Hell is other people."

 tukha.85.t: "One Man's Freedom Fighter..."
 tukha.85.d: "Grigory had felt uneasy throughout the entire campaign against the Bashkir partisans. For decades he had been the one hiding out in the woods, carrying out hit and run attacks, slipping behind enemy lines, fighting a guerrilla war against the Wehrmacht that went on and on and on. In all that time he had never once considered what it felt like to be on the other side, in the position of the occupier, always fearing that the enemy was behind the next hill, or hiding in the foliage just out of sight. He had already lost half a dozen good men to random, sporadic attacks. A shot fired from the trees, a knife in the dark. These attacks filled him with a sense of dread that he had never felt in all his years struggling against the German war machine, rooted in a knowledge that the Bashkirs would fight as long and hard as it took to win their freedom.\n\nYet Grigory also understood what it was to be a partisan, and knew what it would take to lure them out. On his orders a local village was vacated, its residents, likely supporters of the partisans, deported East. His unit occupied the empty houses, and waited. It was only a few days before the partisans made their move, driven by hunger to seize the village's food reserves by force. That day the Red Army won a decisive victory, overwhelming the partisans and chasing them deep into the forest. Dozens were captured and killed, with very few casualties amongst Grigory's unit. His men were elated, and spent that night celebrating their victory with vodka. Grigory joined them, and for a while forgot the enemy that lurked in the forests of Bashkiria."

 tukha.86.t: "Across the Lines"
 tukha.86.d: "Dmitri,\n\nIt's been some time since we've talked, and I thought it would be worthwhile to catch up. It gave me much joy to discover you were still alive and well, even with all of the chaos happening beyond the Urals. I'm not certain what is happening over there, but my admittedly scattered sources do not paint an optimistic picture. I sincerely hope you are keeping safe.\n\nWhatever the case, I thought I'd enlighten you as to what I've been up to for the past few years. No doubt you've already heard about Operation Suvorov and the massive goddamn disaster that was. It was not from lack of trying; we had those fascist pigs on the ropes, and if I had my way I'd be writing this letter from Moscow rather than some pissant village. These fucking careerists would rather look to their own interests than fight for a cause greater than themselves.\n\nI urge Marshal Yegorov every week that he needs to take a harder stance against our enemies, but he continues to give me the same tired excuses: "We're not ready", "We must look to our people first". It's driving me insane! Sometimes I feel like he'd rather take advice from Zhukov than I. He's a good man, sure, but does he really have the stomach for what must be done in the name of reunification?\n\nPerhaps I've vented about my problems far too much. I apologize, my friend, but I've been rather frustrated as of late. Please, don't be afraid to tell me of your own exploits, as I'm sure our troubles have much in common.\n\nRegards,\n\nMikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky."
 tukha.86.a: "Stressful days."

 tukha.87.t: "The Musician and the Marshal"
 tukha.87.d: "Mikhail,\n\nIt's good to hear from you! I admit I have not been paying much attention to whatever is happening beyond the Urals, and I'm glad you were able to shed some light on that. I am, as you've probably guessed, alive and well. Regrettably, I have not had much opportunity to accomplish much in the way of musical pursuits as of late, as my obligations to the Central Siberian Republic have stolen my undivided attention. I realize I've mentioned in the past that I had no love for politics, but strange circumstances such as these demand strange answers. If I can make a positive impact in this broken country, I will spare no effort.\n\nWhat you have told me concerns me deeply, however. I sense a great deal of pent up rage within your words, and that your frustrations seem to be getting the better of you. As your friend, I would sincerely advise caution.\n\nVenting is healthy, so I will not discourage you on that front. However, please ensure that you do not lose yourself to your frustrations. A man in your position would do well to keep a cool head, for it would be easy to commit evil deeds on the field of battle in a bout of wild rage.\n\nTake care,\n\nDmitri Dmitryevich Shostakovich."
 tukha.87.a: "A troubled soul."

 tukha.88.t: "What We've Lost"
 tukha.88.d: "For a moment, for a brief moment, Mikun gave way to Mtsensk. It was the start of act four, the beginning of the end; Mikhail let his head recline, gaze up at the ceiling, and depart from his place and privilege of position. Katerina Lvovna Izmailova has just bribed the guard; in a moment, Katerina Lvovna Izmailova will see her lover Sergei for the last time. "Seryozha, Seryozha! Everything is forgotten with you, Seryozha..." These words mark the end of their travail, mark a flight from the prison train that carries Katerina and Sergei to a Tsarist labor camp - and, in a strange way, carries Mikhail far and away from the horrors of the front.\n\nMikhail Tukhachevsky was listening to Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk - was it music or muddle? Was he right to have saved it from the censors for that damned fool?\n\nHe was Mikhail's friend, once - or was he? Music, that damned noise, discordant, so far from consonance, such passive animosity to tonality. Shostakovich's music was an affront to all that the Red Napoleon held dear; it was blasphemy against the Soviet future the Revolution promised.\n\nWhy did he find himself missing the four-eyed idealist? Why did the record hum out Katerina's sorrows?\n\nFor a moment, Mikhail was no longer the monster under the Fascists' bed - he was a Second Lieutenant, a boy, hostage in a prison at Ingolstadt. He remembered little of that life, save one detail: that divinity, perhaps, to Mikhail, the only divinity, which kept him human in his captivity. He let his head descend, and turn to the only thing of worth in his study: a rosewood violin, stress lines creasing the service, strings nearly snapped, and, to Tukhachevsky, the one thing beautiful in the vast human desert that threatened to devour him."
 tukha.88.a: "Our age is not immune to the voice of a simple and pure heart when that voice is heard."

 tukha.89.t: "Only The Beginning"
 tukha.89.d: "As he sat just a few paces away from the lectern, Tukhachevsky thought that the old soldier reading the script sounded more wooden than he had expected. That did nothing, however, to take the shine off what was the defining moment of his career, the culmination of everything he had worked so hard for.\n\n"And there is only one man who can lead us to victory." The soldier paused. "Comrades, please welcome to the stage your new Grand Marshal - Mikhail Tukhachevsky!"\n\nAs the applause began from all around the hall, Tukhachevsky rose from his chair, walking slowly to the lectern. He had climbed so far to get here, and so he was going to savor every moment of this: this, his ultimate triumph, the victory.\n\nHe took out his notes, beginning to settle into his new role, but there was no celebrating just yet: there were more trials ahead. He began addressing the gathered crowd confidently.\n\n"Comrades!" he said. "I am honored to serve this great nation as its new Grand Marshal."\n\n"Let me be blunt with you: this is only the beginning. We know that the Motherland must be reclaimed." he continued. "We are far away from that, and there is much work to do in the days ahead."\n\nTheir attention commanded, he moved to conclude. "But we are a brave people. A hardworking people. And I have full faith that we will win in the end." Tukhachevsky raised a fist, leading the crowd in a shout."
 tukha.89.a: ""Glory to our great people! Glory to the Soviet Union!""

 tukha.90.t: "Excising The Rot"
 tukha.90.d: "From Tukhachevsky's perspective, the STAVKA wasn't just rotting - it was an outright necrotic institution whose dead flesh could be smelled across all of West Russia. It needed to be greatly reformed, if not outright torn down and rebuilt from scratch. What saddened him was that it wasn't always this way - but perhaps it could be again.\n\nShortly after he took power, he had forced the entire senior leadership to resign - formally "relieving" them of their duties - while replacing them with capable men who were willing to pledge their lives for the nation; for the revolution. Today was to be the first meeting of the new, reformed, STAVKA. As they were all gathered, the Marshal spoke in a formal, strong, tone.\n\n"Yakir, Gamarnik, Ustinov, Triandafillov, Uborevich - congratulations on your appointment to this august body," he began. "It is truly an honor to serve your country, and I sincerely hope that all of you recognise the opportunity that you have been given."\n\n"Much is expected of you, of course. Seniority and experience is of no use if it isn't matched by ability, loyalty, and a devotion not just to any one man, but to the nation. You are leaders, shining examples of what it means to be a fighter of the Union. You must not forget that."\n\nNow came time to put his decisions to the test; to see if these men would perform in their roles as he expected them to. "Here is your first mission. The hour to act is near, and so I am ordering you to mobilize our men for war. We must be prepared to take back our country.""
 tukha.90.a: ""I am confident that we are up to the job. Good luck.""

 tukha.91.t: "Waking The Watchmen"
 tukha.91.d: "The young man in the large office seemed out of place, and for good reason. It wasn't just that it was his first day on the job. Really, not many would've expected someone so seemingly inexperienced to be the designated leader of the Main Directorate of Counter-Intelligence - or SMERSH.\n\nMany of the older apparatchiks had glared at him in the hallway, whispering about what strings he must've pulled to get there, what bribes he must've given. Others muttered platitudes about the foolishness of youth, pretending to drop them innocently as the young man walked by.\n\nBut neither the stares nor the murmurs bothered Vladimir Kyruchkov a jot. This was a man who lived as confidently as he did because he knew that, above everything else, he had the support of Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky himself. Yes, Kyruchkov had an impeccable record, but he was also faithful to the Marshal when few others had been. This was his just reward for all that he had done in the past.\n\nKyruchkov saw the mountain of folders stacked on his desk, and it was then that the scale of the job truly set in. This little comfortable department - where people mostly sat at their desks waiting for the work to come to them - was to take on the responsibilities of three departments at once. For most it would be daunting, but Vladimir realized why he was placed here.\n\nAfter all, it was only the foolish youth who thought anything like this could be done at all.\n\nKyruchkov took one folder, opened it, and began reading. It would take time, but he was confident that SMERSH would become what it could be - a real security service, a true bulwark against the enemies of the Front."
 tukha.91.a: "He would be up reading in the office until much later that night."

 tukha.92.t: "The Neverending War"
 tukha.92.d: "The night air seemed cold and fresh, and against it the cigarette smoke filling the lungs burned. The dark sky sparkled with a diamond scattering of stars, perfectly visible today. The world around him slept calmly, and that calmness was transmitted to Dmitriy. He knew that the war would soon begin. Just a few hours ago, the summons that came to him took him by surprise - and oddly enough, the news of his call from the reserves to the active army did not affect him much. To some extent, he even rejoiced. Olga, of course, would cry and beg him to stay when she finds out. But his eldest son will understand.\n\nThe first time Dmitriy was in the war, it was at the age of sixteen. That war had frightened and crushed him - no matter how furiously he fought for every inch of land of the Soviet Union, the gray monster of the Reich threw him back. Later the fear passed, and was replaced by rage - in the flames of which his second war took place. Together with the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he attacked the enemy, almost snatching victory with his teeth and only a little short of it. And now... Now, the war no longer frightened him - he was used to it, and was well versed in its weaving. Neither did he feel the blazing rage that blinded him and caused him to make mistakes. No, this time he felt only a firm calm confidence.\n\nAfter all, where Olga saw only his march towards death, Dmitriy saw a chance: a chance to return his family, friends, neighbors, everyone around him that bright future that was taken away by Nazis with the destruction of the Soviet Union. What is another war, when the prize is this future? For its sake, Dmitriy was ready to go through a thousand more wars. No, he will not die: the fights hardened him, made him stronger, and Dmitriy now understood more clearly than ever in his life that he would fight again and again, until finally, the victory would be achieved.\n\nThe spark of an extinguished cigarette flashed in the night, leaving the man under the glow of the stars. The thought flashed through his mind that perhaps the war never ended for him, starting when he was a boy of sixteen and continuing all these years - only subsiding for a while."
 tukha.92.a: "He would be up reading in the office until much later that night."

 tukha.93.t: "If At First You Don't Succeed"
 tukha.93.d: "Tukhachevsky found himself in a particularly good mood today, and his advisers noticed it as well. They were all seated in a comfortable room a safe distance away from today's events. From the small wry smile on the Grand Marshals' face, it was clear that the exercises were going better than expected.\n\nPrevious iterations of these exercises hadn't gone as well as initially hoped. Time and time again, they only revealed just how unprepared the army was; just how much the military somehow consistently fell short of Tukhachevsky's high standards. The final straw was when the military somehow lost at a wargame against hypothetical Samaran opponents - the military staff received an earful from Tukhachevsky that day.\n\nIf they couldn't handle the exercises, the Marshal reasoned, they would completely collapse against actual opposition, and so they redoubled their efforts.\n\nThere was no worrying about that today. The army was significantly more organized, the different branches working together smoothly and in unison. Motorized, infantry, artillery - it didn't matter, because they were all one body. This was much better, increasingly closer to where Tukhachevsky thought it should be.\n\nWhen the exercises were over, the generals approached the Marshal. They were wary at first, but from the broad smile they realized he was happy, and as he greeted them he had only one thing to say:"
 tukha.93.a: ""Comrades: we're almost ready.""

 tukha.94.t: "16 Nazis a Day"
 tukha.94.d: "2 rounds per minute. 120 rounds per hour. 1680 rounds per work shift. It would have been 1440 if Alexey had worked the official twelve-hour shift, instead of lingering at the machine for all fourteen hours. One round per thirty seconds. He must find a way to make them faster.\n\nAlexey was never fascinated by the ideas of the communists, but during these weeks he realized that they were right: labor ennobles. Labor brings happiness. The main thing is that you should know exactly what you are working for. Every day, one of the last to leave the workshop, Alexey was exhausted to the limit - and yet he felt real pleasure in this exhaustion. He didn't care about salary and bonuses. Breaks were only important for him as a way to relieve physical stress. When all his movements behind the machines became honed to the limit, Alexey found ways to make ammo more efficiently. Ways to teach his comrades what techniques to use in order to make their work more fruitful. He even began to explore opportunities to improve the entire production process, by sending modernization projects to the plant authorities. And all that simply because he knew exactly what he was doing and why.\n\nEach bullet produced by him would end up in magazines of the soldiers of the Red Army. With these bullets, they would stop the chaos in their land, once again uniting all Soviet people under the red banner. And with these bullets they would crush the armies of the Nazis. Even if only 1% of the bullets he forges hit their targets, it meant that Alexey was killing at least 16 Nazis a day. Every day he created death, and it didn't matter if he himself lived up to that moment or not - for each of those bastards, who terrorized his country and people, the death was already forged. And maybe today, he forged the bullet that sooner or later will penetrate the skull of the Führer himself.\n\nYes, Alexey clearly understood what he was working for. With each stroke of the machine, he heard a shot. Behind each almost completed bullet, he saw the face of one of the Nazis."
 tukha.94.a: "And without hesitation, he pulled the trigger."

 tukha.95.t: "He Had It Coming"
 tukha.95.d: "From the commander's perspective, he had it coming. They'd warned the grocer that they were coming well in advance, and the ultimatum expired forty-eight hours ago. Whether it was negligence or defiance, it didn't matter to Commander Mischa: disobedience was unacceptable.\n\nIt was closing time, and the short stout grocer stood alone at the end of the day. With a small team of soldiers behind him and a rifle in his hand, Commander Mischa approached him.\n\n"Hello, Dmitri. You are required by order of Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky to relinquish control of this establishment to the Red Army." He decided to try and lessen the blow. "Please don't make this difficult for us, and consider it an honor that your goods will be used in the service of this great nation."\n\nThe grocer's sharp black eyes darted from left to right. In seconds all his work - all the blood, sweat, and tears - would be taken away from him forever. It was probably no exaggeration to say that taking away the shop would be taking away his life, so the grocer did what was really the only logical thing.\n\nTo try to seize the commander's rifle and fight back.\n\nThe grocer was far stronger than expected: Commander Mischa certainly wasn't prepared for it. In the chaos of the scuffle the grocer managed to get one of his hands, then another, and suddenly the Commander felt his hands were empty.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot. Mischa remained standing; the grocer didn't. He fell to the ground, bloody hands losing their grip on the rifle. Mischa turned to his soldiers afterwards, shaking his head. "Clean this up. Then take everything here, put it in the truck, and take it back. Damn shame about what happened.""
 tukha.95.a: "A singular tragedy, silenced."

#Zhukov events
 zhukov.1.t: "The WRRF Requests Reunification Talks"
 zhukov.1.d: "President Ivanov sat in his desk, messaging his temples. Another day, another debate between the Militarists and Democrats. When will it all end? He eyed the phone. A call might come at any second, bearing terrific news that both of the factions would cease their bickering - if only for a minute. A generalship in the WRRF had been easier: no debates, no backtalk, and everyone followed his orders. He sighed. He had burnt his bridges to them, a long, long time ago.\n\nAn aide knocked on his door. "Sir?" she said, "a communique. It's not from someone you'd expect."\n\n"Come in," he said, his voice ringing in his ears. What now? What sort of political deal would either the Militarists and Democrats would be willing to cut? He had told them countless times that he would never compromise his neutrality to the cause of Vologda. "Who is it from? The Militarists, or the Democrats?" He could barely hide the loathing in his voice.\n\n"It's from the Revolutionary Front, sir." Well, speak of the devil.\n\n"Put them on my desk, please, and thank you." After handing Ivanov the telegram, she walked off. "Let's see here," Ivanov said to himself, "what sort of deal would they want now?"\n\nHis pupils slowly dilated at the words of the telegram. "You are either with us or against us," the tiny piece of paper said as if each word were punctuated by a megaphone, "General Ivanov. Join us, or perish in obscurity."\n\nHe reached for the phone. He did not even have to think. Thumbing the number of Vologda's foreign ministry, he said:"
 zhukov.1.a: "Call them."
 zhukov.1.b: "Unacceptable."

 zhukov.2.t: "Vologda Declines!"
 zhukov.2.d: "Marshal Zhukov had a reputation for being one of the most tolerant and patient men in the Front's high command. Today, however, four men lined outside his office, unsure among themselves of who would deliver the bad news. They were from what would pass as the Front's foreign ministry, and not one of them wanted to meet with Zhukov. Eventually, however, after a bit of browbeating and shoving, the timidest of them emerged, carrying in his hands a note that might end his career.\n\nThe aide knocked on the Marshal's door. "Sir?" he said, his voice almost a whisper, almost a shrill whistle, "I have news, sir."\n\n"Come in," Zhukov said, "soldier." He sat on his desk, pen in hand, writing orders for some outpost in the far nowhere. The Marshal did not even bat an eye. "What news?" Zhukov said, "make it quick. I have orders to issue, and I don't have the whole day to do them."\n\n"It's from Vologda, sir."\n\n"Ah," Zhukov said, putting his pen down, finally fixing his eyes on the aide, "So what did they say?" Clasping his hands together, he continued, "Don't be shy. I would not be in this line of work if I were squeamish to bad news."\n\n"They said no, sir."\n\n"Ah, well, you're dismissed. Thank you, soldier." The aide left the room, letting out the biggest sigh of relief he could muster."
 zhukov.2.a: "Vologda leaves us with no choice."

 zhukov.3.t: "Vologda Agrees!"
 zhukov.3.d: "Marshal Zhukov was a busy man. Ever since he took the place of the former Marshal Alexander Yegorov, he had seldom found time to so much as peer outside his office. He did not like it. The soldiers needed to see the figure of a private in every Marshal, he thought. No matter, there'd be time enough for that once they got out of their current mess.\n\nToday, too, he had to issue orders to his subordinates, attend staff meetings, as well as observe the soldiers on parade. Most of the hours, however, would be spent here: in the dark recesses of the almost-monolithic Central Office of the Revolutionary Front. Adjusting his glasses to look at the orders that lay before him, he readied his pen and wrote his instructions.\n\nA door knock. "Sir?" a timid voice said, "I have news for you. It concerns the so-called Republic of Vologda, sir."\n\n"Come in," he said, putting down everything. Once the aid stood before him, he continued, "Good or bad, tell me, soldier. This information is vital to the survival of the Front." Sensing the young man's nervousness, he said, "Tell me. I would not be in this line of work for long if I were squeamish to bad news."\n\n"Good news, sir," the aide said, a smile forming on the edges of his lips, drowned by his anxiety, "They accepted the negotiation terms. They are asking when we are available, sir."\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise. "Go to the foreign ministry and tell them to set a date, preferably as soon as possible." After the aide left, he took his box of cigarettes and indulged in one. Finally, something good to celebrate today."
 zhukov.3.a: "Victory draws ever closer for the Front"

 zhukov.4.t: "A Letter to the Legislature"
 zhukov.4.d: "To the Legislature of the Republic of Komi,\n\nGreetings from the Front, your old ally. We come to you in peace, this letter being our olive branch. In recognition of our common democratic traditions, we address this letter, not to the President of the Republic, but its Legislature. The Front has no hostile intentions at present against the Republic, nor the will to subvert its democracy.\n\nThe Front recognizes that both it and the Republic has had a long, often-hostile history. Today, however, the Front is willing to put it all behind, should the Republic wishes to do so. We solemnly ask, in the name of democracy and socialism, that the Republic join us as comrades once again. Let brothers and sisters link their hands in a new march for the future, and let our enemies tremble.\n\nWe implore that the Republic of Komi would see reason. To your south lie perils to your democracy. The Aryan Brotherhood, the Emperor, now restored in Vyatka, as well as the Liberation Army, whose intents remain unknown. In joining our arms together, we protect ourselves against domination from forces hostile to Lenin and Marx's dreams of communism. In rejoining us, we would like to recall the images of Rome and its Italic allies as one united power. None shall challenge the might of our armies in the field. With the Republic's personnel and the Front's expertise, none can stand us for long.\n\nIn addition, all crimes committed during the West Russian War shall be rendered moot. We implore you, again, to see reason.\n\nWe expect an answer immediately.\n\nSigned, Marshal Georgy Zhukov"
 zhukov.4.a: "Begin the talks."
 zhukov.4.b: "They are barking up the wrong tree."

 zhukov.5.t: "Komi Refuses!"
 zhukov.5.d: "Marshal Zhukov found himself in his office, a few hours after everyone had gone home. Now, it was just him, his bodyguards on the other room, as well as some aides working overtime. Tonight was his break. No one should overwork themselves, not even the Marshals of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Isn't that right, he thought, tipping his glass to Yegorov's portrait. Old Yegorov. His predecessor and senior, and his mentor. He shook his head. Zhukov had never known a more bizarre combination. So bold and so foolish. It was a shame.\n\nThe chime of a telephone. Rude. Zhukov had explicitly ordered his staff not to call him at this moment. Picking up the receiver, he said to the phone, calming the tone of his voice, "Hello," he said, "Marshal Aleksandr, what is happening?" It better be urgent, or someone would earn more than an earful in the morning. A buzz.\n\n"Sir," a voice on the other end said, "apologies for interrupting your night, but Komi has decided to respond to our request."\n\n"And what did they say?" the Marshal said, leaning forward in his seat, "yes or no?" A silence. An awkward pause. "Well?" Zhukov said, growing impatient. He wanted to plan for the weeks to come. Tonight can go to hell. His work comes first. "Yes or no, soldier, which one is it?"\n\n"No, sir."\n\n"Very well. Good night." Returning the receiver to its place, Zhukov pulled a drawer on his desk open. He had prepared for such eventuality. It was incredibly unlikely anyhow. War was the only way forward, and they would find that Zhukov was a trailblazer in his chosen discipline."
 zhukov.5.a: "They have made their choice. We have made ours."

 zhukov.6.t: "A Letter of Cooperation"
 zhukov.6.d: "To the West Russian Revolutionary Front,\n\nIn recognition of your offer to join our efforts in the reclamation of Russia, the Legislature of the Republic shall officially accept your offer of cooperation. No longer shall the Aryan Brotherhood, the monarchists in Vyatka, or the Russian Liberation Army threaten the home of the Revolution. We would enclose the ciphers used by the Republic's military intelligence, and we demand that you the same.\n\nWe expect a formal treaty to be ratified by the Marshal of the Front and the President of the Republic for the following actions to be effective immediately.\n\n1. The Republic requires equal access to the Front's territories and gives the Front an equivalent to the Republic's regions.\n\n2. The Republic shall enclose the ciphers used by its military intelligence, and it demands the Front to do the same.\n\n3. On the matter of crimes committed during the West Russian War, the Republic assumes that its counterparts in the Front would coordinate and cooperate. Unilateral amnesty shall be issued for combatants of both sides, regardless of military and political position.\n\nSpeed is of the essence, especially regarding the chaotic nature of Russia's present state. Once the treaty is ratified, we can move past the formalities of diplomacy and into the application of such an alliance. The President of the Republic wishes the Marshal and his Front well.\n\nSigned, the Legislature of the Republic of Komi."
 zhukov.6.a: "At last."

 zhukov.7.t: "A Letter from the Front"
 zhukov.7.d: ""Dear comrades,\n\nSince the founding of the Republic a decade ago, it has enjoyed considerable autonomy from the central leadership of the wider West Russian Revolutionary Front. Made necessary by the chaotic condition of the motherland at the time, this arrangement has now become obsolete. The Front is united in the West and stands strong, poised to reestablish control over all territories of the Soviet Union.\n\nFor reunification to succeed, every part of the motherland must be mobilized towards that purpose. This includes the Komi territories. It is time for us to align ourselves more closely once again. We ask that you agree to this realignment. Should you accept, representatives from the Front will arrive within a few weeks time. Once in Komi, they will make preparations for the eventual reintegration of the territory. You can rest assured, however, that the laws, practices and traditions of your republic will be remembered, so its lessons can be applied to the betterment of the entire Union.\n\nOn behalf of the West Russian Revolutionary Front,\nGrand Marshal Georgy Zhukov""
 zhukov.7.a: "Acknowledged."
 zhukov.7.b: "Ignore this proposal."

 zhukov.8.t: "Commissions for their Commanders?"
 zhukov.8.d: ""Varennikov," the Marshal said, reading the names of the two files before him out loud, "and Oplesnin." Tonight was a busy night. With formal cooperation with the Republic of Komi ratified, there seemed to be no end to his work. Organizing the military? Sure, the old Union trained him to be the best at his job. Diplomacy, however, was another matter. Zhukov found the diplomats of the Republic insufferable. He endured them only for the sake of the alliance. Otherwise, he would not have bothered.\n\nThey were not as considerate to Zhukov, however. This morning, the diplomats arrived with an outrageous demand: to commission two of the paramilitary leaders of the Republic's Left. At first, Zhukov took it as what it was: nonsense. They would make good commanders for the Front's urban assault units - but generals? No. And Zhukov told them so. Displeased by the Marshal's frank, honest answer, they kept on insisting on Varennikov and Oplesnin's candidacy to the generalship of the Front. Again, for the sake of the alliance, the Marshal relented. He agreed to give their credentials a look-over.\n\nZhukov concluded that, in certain situations, both of these would be competent generals for other states. Within the Front, however, these qualifications change. No soldier of the Front would serve under commanders who they regard as having proven themselves only on the streets of Syktyvkar, and not through proper academic and officer training. He could use them for the Front's less critical assignments, or not use them at all - but he'd rather not accept unqualified officers into his staff.\n\nThe question returns. Would he make a stand, or will he relent?"
 zhukov.8.a: "Relent to the request."
 zhukov.8.a.tt: "When the time comes, we will offer them service."
 zhukov.8.b: "Take a stand."

 zhukov.9.t: "Unifying the General Staff"
 zhukov.9.d: "Not for the first time, the Grand Marshal found his patience tested by the politicking of generals. The terms he'd agreed with Vasily Ivanov and the rest of the Vologda clique were very straightforward. Even so, with an agreed-upon plan for how their command structures were to be unified, he still found his generals bickering over questions of precedence, prestige and seniority in the new central command.\n\nUnlike in earlier times, however, he wasn't very concerned about underlying tensions in his staff. His leadership of the Front was secure, and while some resentment at Ivanov's earlier hesitation lingered on, Zhukov was confident it would dissipate as the armies from Vologda settled into the wider Front. Ivanov and his officers were well liked by their men and popular in the wider population. The sooner they were seen to follow his directions, the more it would strengthen the Front's legitimacy as the continuation of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut first, it seemed, he needed to settle some disputes."
 zhukov.9.a: "It's like herding cats..."

 zhukov.11.t: "The Syktyvkar Trials"
 zhukov.11.d: "In the former-Republic of Komi's Supreme Court, the Front had set up trials for the members of the Komi government. By order of Marshal Zhukov, the Front's jurists laid down the laws and charges against the defendants. Among those charged were the President of the Republic and the cabinet, as well as the members of the Legislature. The jury consisted of a mix of Komi citizens as well as veterans of the West Russian War.\n\nIt had taken weeks of preparation to prepare for the trials. Along with gathering witnesses as well as assembling the jury, the Front had also made a list of allegations leveled against the defendants. Chiefest of these were treasonous acts against the Union - to whom the Front claimed to be a successor. With such a preponderance of evidence, there can be no doubt as to the verdict.\n\nAt the end of the week-long trial, the judge gathered the Komi government before him. All, from the President to the Republic's ministers and the Deputies of the National Assembly unfortunate enough to get caught, stood with chains to their feet and wrists.\n\nThe gavel struck. "In the name of the West Russian Revolutionary Front," the judge said, his voice echoing in the mostly-silent courtroom, "I pronounce you guilty." The verdict was inevitable, but what shall be its punishment?"
 zhukov.11.a: "Imprison this lot. Time outside politics may well do them good."
 zhukov.11.b: "No mercy for traitors. Have them shot."

 zhukov.12.t: "The Syktyvkar Trials"
 zhukov.12.d: "The Front's first act in Ust-Sysolsk was to restore its former name. As a sign of goodwill for the natives of the area, Marshal Zhukov approved of a return to "Komi" as the region's name. The Front and its leadership hoped that such a symbolic gesture would begin the easing of tensions between Russians and the ethnic Komi. After all, what were the Komi but comrades-in-arms from with another name?\n\nThe perpetrators of the crimes against the Komi, however, did not fare as well. Since the Front's victory, they had been shunted off to prisons within the former Republic of Komi, each waiting for the day justice would come to them. Meanwhile, the Front prepared its jurists, its jury, and the list of allegations and charges it would level at the defendants. Marshal Zhukov and the staff felt the need to expose their crimes and, in the process, assure the world of the Front's legitimacy. After a few weeks, the Front declared that the trials would officially start.\n\nToday, the trial reached its conclusion. The judge, a veteran from the West Russian War trained in Soviet legal proceedings, struck the gavel. "For crimes committed against the people of Komi, as well as treasonous acts against the doctrine of socialism and for making war against the sole legitimate authority of the Union, I sentence you to death.""
 zhukov.12.a: "Justice is served."

 zhukov.13.t: "The Syktyvkar Trials"
 zhukov.13.d: "When the Front first learned of Komi's new government - a socialist state built on the foundations of the Soviet Union - its soldiery and officers were ecstatic. The Marshal officially extended an offer of cooperation to the Republic, sure of their answer. However, the envoys returned rebuffed, their terms rejected. The answer was clear: the Republic of Komi was no longer an ally, but enemies. At the outset, however, the Front still maintained some form of respect for their fellow socialists.\n\nWhen the Front entered Syktvykar, however, they were greeted by horror. Not only had the Republic and its organs of state acted against the legitimate successor of the old Union, but also its beliefs. The Republic of Komi had embraced total and complete revisionism, going contrary to the ideas of Marx, Lenin, and Bukharin. Without delay, the Front prepared a trial to expose these violations. Chiefest among the charges were treason against the Union, as well as the revisionist and unorthodox practice of socialism.\n\nThe gavel struck. The verdict was inevitable. The Front, its jurists, and its jury found the collective leadership of the Republic guilty. All that remains to be decided are the punishments. Perhaps a time of hard labor would reform these dissidents. On the other hand, there are scarcely better guarantees of silence than a bullet. The judge pronounces their claims, and the punishment was decided."
 zhukov.13.a: "Hard labor."
 zhukov.13.b: "Execution by firing squad."

 zhukov.14.t: "Against the Church"
 zhukov.14.d: "From his seat on a truck bed, Anton looked at the monastery in the distance as it rose against the flat forests and low hills of Gayny. It was a beautiful country. The warrior-monks of the Order of Saint George called the fortress-monastery Squirrel's Nest. Anton smirked. For all their pretensions of sagacity and wisdom, they could not come up with a better name than a child would.\n\nAgainst the Revolutionary Front, however, the Order could not have come up with a more antithetical opposition. One side believed that religious life was everything to man. The other dismissed it, citing Marx's label of "opiate of the masses." He felt pity rise in his heart as the truck trudged through the rough, hastily erected roads into the wilds of Gayny. Holding a photo of his sweetheart from so, so long ago, Anton felt that he understood the monks better. He, too, would have prayed to a thousand gods beneath the sky if it meant meeting her again.\n\nHe felt the winds brush against his face, their touch cold and harsh against his cheeks. Looking around him, he found his companions and comrades in a similar, somber mood. No one liked a task thrust upon them at the early hours of the morning. He looked at his feet, just below his seat. Explosives, box-shaped. He remembered his sergeant's orders.\n\n"Take up everything you can," the man said, his voice rough and raspy, perhaps a keepsake from his time in the West Russian War, "manuscripts, crosses, robes, everything that has value and," he pointed to the explosives, "blow up everything that doesn't. Orders came from higher up. The monastery is in the way, so we are getting rid of it."\n\nThe words seeped to his mind as his hands and fingers ran through his equipment. Triggers, the explosive load, as well as safety equipment. He peered up. They were getting close."
 zhukov.14.a: "Nothing remained but dust, and splinters of wood and stone."

 zhukov.15.t: "Touring the Farms"
 zhukov.15.d: "It was a scene that Zhukov remembered well. Hundreds of peasants tilling the fields in preparation for this year's seeds, as well as the sunny, bright, and cheerful look of the farmers. A long time ago, before even the Great War, he was raised in such a household. It was a memory that kept him going through the harshest decades of Russian history. From the loss of its pride to the Germans at Brest-Litovsk, the Revolutions of 1919, and the ongoing Great Patriotric War, the image of the Union drove him forward. One, indivisible, inseparable, and invincible.\n\n"Hoy," a peasant said, addressing the Grand Marshal, "Marshal, sir. Do you have time?" The peasant accent was something familiar, yet faint in Zhukov's memory. He felt home there, somehow, among the copper bodies and calloused hands of the farmers, in the middle of sunlight and patches of melting dew and morning frost. One of his staff members strode forward, intending to shove the peasant away.\n\n"Don't bother the Marshal with your inane quest-"\n\n"That's all right," he said, "sorry, I wasn't paying attention. The countryside is beautiful this year around. One can hardly resist not getting lost in its allure. Your question was?"\n\nThe peasant began his litany of complaints, censorious and critical against the previous government's shortcomings. In a dramatic flourish, the Marshal whipped out his notes and pencil and started to write. Keeping up appearances as usual - though admittedly, the people who lived the land might know how to run it best.\n\n"Thank you, thank you," he said, after wasting three pages of notes, "I'll make sure that the Front takes care of your concerns. Would that be all?" The peasant nodded, and the Marshal shook his hand. "Thank you," the Marshal said, "Were it not for your efforts we would starve.""
 zhukov.15.a: "A successful public performance."

 zhukov.16.t: "The WRRF Demands Reunification"
 zhukov.16.d: ""Huh? What did you say?" Averin said, emerging from underneath the tracks of his tank. Oil, petrol, and mechanical lubricants stained his overalls. Needless to say, it better be important. The Tank Bandit had more important business to settle that day, and servicing his tank was the least of it. The messenger, a boy, around 19 years of age - probably the sights on some other tank's crew - was trembling. Averin knew he had a reputation, but he did not take pride in introducing fear to some young pissant's pants.\n\n"Y-yes, sir," the young man said, "a message, sir. From the Revolutionary Front." This kid had better be kidding. The Front was nothing. Nothing. Nihil. Now, this brat came up to him and started bringing it up again. He took off his work gloves and placed them neatly on a table. Averin gritted his teeth. Yet another matter to handle before the day ended. Averin was a man of two duties: a savage tank commander, but also a leader. If he were to be honest, he hated the latter part of his job. Running a brigade full of what an outside observer would term "free spirits" - what Averin would personally call a hive of scum and villainy - was entirely different from commanding a tank. Not everyone followed orders, much to his chagrin.\n\n"Well?" he said, "spit it out. I haven't got all day, and this tank isn't even halfway done."\n\n"Essentially, sir," the kid stammered, "they gave us two choices: surrender or death." Averin groaned. The day was getting longer and longer by the minute. He considered. He would love to test his tanks against the Front's out there in the field. On the other hand, he would rather play it safe, rather than gamble his life, livelihood, and hobby in one fell bet.\n\n"All right, kid," he said, "here's what I am gonna do...""
 zhukov.16.a: "Maybe it's time to hang up old grudges."
 zhukov.16.b: "Let their tanks come to us, and we'll smash them to bits."

 zhukov.17.t: "Gorky Refuses!"
 zhukov.17.d: "The Marshal of the Front stared at the map. Specifically, he was looking at the black botch of it, like a tumor growing out of Moskowien's field-grey Eastern rear. The headquarters were silent tonight, and only he was up. Zhukov had predicted that Gorky would decline to join the Front. If they had found the Front so agreeable the first time, they wouldn't have left. Sipping a cup of coffee, he saw the troop positions of his and his enemy's. Knowing one's adversary was, after all, the sure way to victory.\n\nHe placed the cup down. Only one thing bothered him. Gorky was a site for the pre-West Russian War tank factory, and out there, in the fields, the Front would face its equal. He thumbed through a file filled to the brim with reports of troop readiness, equipment levels, as well as morale. Everything looked to be in place for the Front's triumph, so long as no one attacked him from the rear. Gorky's supply of tanks might seem enormous, but a city alone cannot sustain the needs of a tank army.\n\nHe placed his index finger on the lines that would penetrate the Tank Bandits' territory. The Marshal was above all a veteran, of two finished wars, and one that still burned in his mind. He could imagine the difficulty; tanks were mighty behemoths of the field. Without support or special equipment, taking them down would be very challenging. Zhukov would not be a marshal for long, however, if he did not trust in his soldier's morale and skill. The decades where warlords would rule the old Union was coming to an end, and if Gorky would stand against the will of the ages, they were welcome to be ground to dust."
 zhukov.17.a: "Averin had left us no choice."

 zhukov.18.t: "Gorky Agrees!"
 zhukov.18.d: ""General Averin!" Marshal Zhukov said, greeting his new comrade, "welcome to the Front." The two men could not have been more dissimilar from one another. Zhukov stood erect, his dark uniform almost gleaming in the sunlight. Medals, a few of them decorated his chest. Here was one for the West Russian War, and one was for his continued service for the Union during the ongoing Great Patriotic War. Striding forward to shake Averin's hand, he was struck by how dingy and dirty the man looked.\n\nThe leader of the Tank Bandits, seemingly, did not realize the momentousness of this occasion. He wore his overalls, blotched in shades of pink and black of oil and mechanical lubricants. On his beard were dust, and to the naked eye, it appeared coarse and rough. His speech was no different from his mien. "Hoy," he said, "Zhukov. How long has it been? Four, three years? I figured it'd be nice to finally not under machinegun fire for once." Grasping the Tank Bandit's hands, Zhukov felt how strange his palms were. Simultaneously rough and smooth, and a little slippery. He let go of it as quickly as he could.\n\n"I've been well, General Averin." in the confines of his office, Averin's smell was overpowering. Less sweat, and more of gas, petrol, lubricants, and oil. The Tank Bandit was living true to his name - he made the Marshal's office smell like a tank factory. "Sit down, please, while we wait for tea." A luxury, but Zhukov would rather spend a fortune to acquire the Bandits' allegiance than lives. He could not afford to lose any more veterans and skilled soldiers.\n\n"Thank you," the Bandit said, his accent no less refined from before, "I am happy to be here."\n\nIt was going to be a long day."
 zhukov.18.a: "At the very least, there is peace."

 zhukov.19.t: "The WRRF's Ultimatum"
 zhukov.19.d: "The West Russian Revolutionary Front has come forward with an outrageous demand today. Through cable and their diplomatic channels, they have issued an ultimatum. Accept integration into the Front, like the old Union times, or war. Many in the government have made their decision clear. Defiance. If the Front intends to take our independence, their reasoning goes, they have to come and pay for it in blood.\n\nAmong the Russian populace, however, there is dissent. A war would lead to the devastation of the countryside, and what casualties the Republic would lose it would never fully recover. Not to mention, that under the WRRF, there would be protection against other, worse forces in the area. The Aryan Brotherhood and the Russian Liberation Army do not present themselves as the best neighbors, after all.\n\nSo the choice is thus: to fold or to take a stand."
 zhukov.19.a: "Resist."
 zhukov.19.b: "Yield."

 zhukov.20.t: "The Tatars Defiant"
 zhukov.20.d: "Marshal Zhukov found himself in the map room of his office. Again. Every time one of the warlords rejected his pleas for peace, he retreated there. It had become a refuge of sorts. Here, he could plan for contingencies. Besides, the comfort the caffeine and nicotine provided helped soothe the pain of having to send more soldiers to the frontlines. Putting down his cup of coffee, sizzling and fragrant, he eyed the map.\n\nGreen. The Tatars had chosen to be insolent and defiant against the Front's will. Rejecting the Front's reasonable offer of autonomy as well as protection from its neighbors, it had instead chosen to turn against its only potential benefactor. Foolish move. Perhaps, to the Tatarstan government's mind, it was more romantic to die on the battlefield than surrender their newly-gained independence. No matter. They had become adversaries, foes; in this matter, the Front has made its stance clear.\n\nHe gathered his pieces and assembled the plan of attack he had in his mind. The Tatars' small, defensive army will not stand long against scrutiny from an actual offensive army. Cigarette in one hand and a pencil in the other, the Marshal started on his work."
 zhukov.20.a: "Tatarstan shall fall."

 zhukov.21.t: "A Dinner in Tatarstan"
 zhukov.21.d: "Tonight was a historic moment in the history of the Front and the Republic of Tatarstan. Both parties have ratified a Treaty of Friendship, and dinner commenced afterward. Sitting at the center of the party, Zhukov couldn't help but feel that everything was dull. The food wasn't anything to write home about, and the place wasn't as glitzy and prestigious as he had hoped. He recognized the significance of the party, however. Tatarstan had peacefully joined the Front as an autonomous Republic. No men died, only spattered ink over an arbitrary piece of paper.\n\n"How did you find the meal, Marshal Zhukov," the President of the Republic, sitting on the other end of the table, said, "do you find it to your liking much?"\n\n"Uh," the question took Zhukov somewhat by surprise. Collecting himself, he said, "yes. I find it quite delicate and excellent. Please pass my compliments to tonight's chef if you would, sir." It was edible, but if the chef had deigned to serve Lenin with it, he would be taken out back and shot.\n\nIt was going to be another long night. Zhukov sighed, sotto voce. At least no one would die over a dinner. Well, unless the food turned out to be even worse in his stomach."
 zhukov.21.a: "Another evening survived."

 zhukov.22.t: "Movements on the Border"
 zhukov.22.d: "Vladimir awoke with the chime of a telephone. Sitting upon his bed, he drowsily let the rings time out, but they still came and came. Finally, he put his hands on the receiver and lifted it to his ears. The Emperor of Russia gazed absently into the night, his eyes following the undulating motions of the curtains. Vladimir watched as the winds lifted and returned it into its place, over and over. He shivered. A servant had neglected to close the windows.\n\nOver on the receiver, however, was a buzz. Vladimir put it closer to his ears, and the buzzing became murmurs, and the murmurs became shouts. Panic had taken grip of the other end. "Sir, sir!" a voice said, its details blurring with Vladimir's breathing, "sir! Are you all right?" He had to answer now, lest they send a servant over to propel him to into consciousness. Using his fingernails, he pinched his upper left arm. A groan and he was there, the Emperor of Russia restored to his natural place among the realm of the living.\n\n"Yes, yes," he said to the mysterious, nebulous, and blurry voice, "I am here. What is happening?" He could not wait to go back to his bed. Alas, if they were calling him this early in the morning, he probably would not. All he thought of was coffee and some cigarettes, and some time to prepare for the day ahead.\n\n"I apologize for interrupting your sleep, sir." Why are they in such a hurry? "But an emergency. We have to evacuate you. Immediately." Can't it wait? "The Revolutionary Front has been seen encroaching on our borders, sir. We have to get you to safety before anything happens."\n\n"Send a couple of servants over," he said, his speech slow and his words slurry. "I'll be ready in a couple of minutes.""
 zhukov.22.a: "Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

 zhukov.23.t: "The Fate of the Royal Relics"
 zhukov.23.d: "Anton looked on as they piled the royal relics high. Crosses, crucifixes, manuscripts encased between covers of solid gold, jewelry, and many, many more. Indeed, the Romanovs had amassed quite the wealth since returning to Russia. The pile of treasure reminded Anton of dragons, and now they had found the lair of one and slain it.\n\nAnton leaned forward and picked up a small notebook, barely the size of his palms. Its cover was leather - smooth, almost-soothing to the touch. His fingers flickered through the pages, and Anton realized that the paper was creamy, expensive. No writing graced its empty grasslands of white, no hill; no mountain. No ink painted its canvas, and no vistas described in its pages. In its hollow form, it was beautiful: complete in its incompleteness. The book enchanted him, and he slipped it to his uniform. No commanding officer would resent him for keeping a book stolen from right under the Emperor's trove of loot.\n\nFor the rest of the day, Anton helped with the orderly recollection of the treasures. He kept the book close to his chest. After everything was done, he approached his commanding officer. "What to do with all this loot," he said, "sir?"\n\n"Well, the high command had been unclear on that," the sergeant said, "They uh...""
 zhukov.23.a: ""...want to liquify all these assets.""
 zhukov.23.b: ""...want to maintain the cultural value these objects possess.""

 zhukov.24.t: "An Unexpected Displeasure"
 zhukov.24.d: "What a mess this was. Ivan didn't know what a car full of armed reactionaries was doing out here in the sticks. They'd been just as surprised to find him and his squad, however, which had made for a hard-fought battle.\n\n"We found the last of the enemies, sergeant. Uh, you might want to see this. Dmitry thinks it's him. The traitor Tsar. He's been shot up, though. I left him with Dmitry, over that way."\n\nThat explained what the tsarists were doing out here, at least.\n\n"I'll go, but you need to see to Petrov in the meanwhile. Keep the pressure on that wound. Tight! Or he'll start bleeding again."\n\nIvan made his way over to Dmitry and the prisoner.\n\n"Are you sure it's him?"\n\nThe soldier nodded. Ivan gave the man a thorough look to make sure. There was no question. The bound person in front of him was indeed the traitor Tsar, dying from his wounds by the look of him.\n\nThe man drew gasped weakly, every breath shallower than the last. It wouldn't be long. Ivan couldn't stand the sight of him. The man that had brought untold misery and war on the motherland lying in a pool of his own blood. He would die from his wounds here, having never faced trial. The injustice was sickening.\n\n"Move him over there, comrade." Dmitry had to pick up the wounded man to move him, staining his coat with blood in the process. It matched Ivan's now, bloody as it was from when he'd cradled the wounded Private Petrov. The sergeant pulled out his pistol. He'd made a decision.\n\n"Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov, you are a known fascist collaborator and traitor to the motherland. The punishment is death."\n\nThe man was already half-dead when the gunshot ran out.\n\n"Help me gather everyone, we need to get going if Petrov's to make it.""
 zhukov.24.a: "The end of the line."

 zhukov.25.t: "A Partisan Stronghold"
 zhukov.25.d: "Viktor looked at the site of the battle. As a member of the Marshal's staff, he was tasked with gathering data from an engagement with the monarchist and revisionist partisans in the countryside. The very notion of resistance surprised him. Weren't the Union beloved, a symbol of defiance against the Nazi Germans? Why would the people turn on them now, and support the reactionaries and the traitors? He shook his head. Maybe he would never understand.\n\nHe stood, his foot ankle-deep in the mud. The rains had made the ground wet, and if he were not careful, he would sink. He looked at the truck that brought him here. Its wheels dug into the mud, and no motion of the engines could unclasp nature's grasp. Before him, stood the remains of the compound the partisans used as a hiding place for their insurgent acts. An old settlement from the Soviet times, abandoned during the bombings. He could see the shattered facades of buildings on the streets, and shards of brick and wood crunched underneath his foot as he walked by.\n\nWeapons. Dead bodies. The Front had long since cleaned after its own dead. For these people, however, there was no such luck. Their emperor, gods, ideology - it did not matter - had abandoned them. Left them for dead. He set out his notes and camera, the tools of his trade. It was time to go to work."
 zhukov.25.a: "Gruesome work, but necessary all the same."

 zhukov.26.t: "The Partisans on Trial"
 zhukov.26.d: "Four men marched slowly forward in the woods, their feet and hands linked by chains. The bights clinked to the tempo of their steps. Behind them was Viktor and a squad of local Front soldiers tasked with guarding this lot. These men were partisans of various groups. On their uniforms were patches that declared their allegiance: the VTNS, Komi Republic's assortment of paramilitaries, and others still. It did not matter to whom they belonged. In Viktor's mind, they were all traitors, fascists, and revisionists.\n\nOn a clearing up ahead was a court held for this occasion. The judge, a captain of the Front dressed in uniform, sat on a metal chair. The Front's military law book lay on a table before him. Around him, gathered in a cluster, were his appendages. Court notaries, stenographers, and a jury made out of random farmers and scavengers the Front had accosted to serve jury duty. In a civil court, these partisans might have stood a chance. Once it was in the military's hands, however, no matter how formal the Front had arranged the trial to be, the verdict was sealed.\n\nViktor felt pity for these men, even as he volunteered himself to stand witness and testify against them. They were kindred, countrymen. Misguided? Maybe. Guilty? Almost definitely. They couldn't have known, however, that they were on the wrong side of history. Even as the bights clinked and the leaves underfoot crunched under the steady stream of steps, he felt pity.\n\nThus the trial proceeded. Witnesses took the stand, and the defendants defended themselves - to no avail. The gavel struck, and the judge pronounced their guilt. Viktor awaits, with bated breath, for the sentence to be read. The hollow, empty forest rustled, as a pregnant silence reigned in the court."
 zhukov.26.a: "Death."
 zhukov.26.b: "Hard labor."

 zhukov.27.t: "Moving the Capital?"
 zhukov.27.d: "With the defeat of the Tsardom of Vyatka and the Republic of Komi, a question arises among the ranks of the Front. The Front's current capital, located in Arkhangelsk, is hardly the most hospitable place. Cold weather, rough terrain, and distance from other urban centers of West Russia had rendered it almost obsolete. The high command now considers moving - but to where? Fortunately, with the defeat of our adversaries in the region, we have a few candidates in mind.\n\nThe first one is the city of Syktyvkar. The former capital of the Front during the West Russian War, a move here would have deep symbolic value. Beneath it also lay the former Republic of Komi's supply of chemical weapons: useful to deter any intruders from entering it. However, the city has a long tradition of paramilitarism, and it might be best not to jeopardize the nerve center of our government.\n\nFurther south is the Rykov, or in Tsarist terminology, Vyatka. It is a more central location, located near the Siberian railways and the Izhevsk manufacturing plant. The infrastructure of the area would mean that supplies would get to our soldiers quicker. The location is an issue, however. If the Germans came knocking, they wouldn't have to go far to knock the Front's government down.\n\nLastly, there is the old reliable, Arkhangelsk. Located far away from any urban areas of the Front, its position had become untenable with the availability of more suitable candidates. However, its isolation and the rough terrain that surround it would serve to slow down any enemy that intends to defeat the Front.\n\nThe choice is the Marshal's - where should we go?"
 zhukov.27.a: "Remain in Arkhangelsk."
 zhukov.27.b: "Move to Syktyvkar."
 zhukov.27.c: "Relocate to Rykov."

 zhukov.28.t: "Freeing the Camps"
 zhukov.28.d: ""So, old man," Anton said to the newly-freed prisoner, "how are you feeling on this day?" The man only nodded; a vague gesture of positivity was all that Anton needed to know. They sat in front of a munitions factory, the man's former workplace. Well - workplace would mean that the Brotherhood employed him. Instead, he was their slave. On his back, between his shoulder blades, was a black mark in the shape of a swastika.\n\n"It's fine if you don't want to talk about it," Anton said, "I understand. You have seen things other folks haven't." In the man's eyes were a particular kind of hollowness. Disbelief reigned in the void where emotions should have been. "Have another one of these. And don't eat too quickly!" Anton broke off a piece of the bread he held in his hands and gave it to the man. While the latter ate ravenously, Anton observed. The man's teeth had gaps, and in places, some of it hung precariously from their gums. "What's your name?" Anton asked, out of whim.\n\n"Alexei," the man said, proceeding to devour his food. He did not pay any heed to Anton before he finished. "I-" Alexei started his words halted at the precipice of their tongue. He seemed to consider his words. "Thank you." He then caught Anton in an embrace and began to sob.\n\n"It's all right," Anton said, "it's all right." Nothing in the world could erase what the man had gone through. It was the least that Anton could say and do."
 zhukov.28.a: "Scars upon the Russian psyche."

 zhukov.29.t: "The ASSR System"
 zhukov.29.d: ""Thank you, thank you," Zhukov said, shaking hands with the representatives of the autonomous republics, "for your service to the Union." In the cramped space of his office, there was nearly not enough room for his high command and the people from the SSR. Today would begin a lengthy series of negotiations between the Tatars and the Bashkirs - minorities in the Front - with the government of the Front. Zhukov would only serve as a symbolic head this time, his military experience unneeded when it came to civilian affairs.\n\nHis Premier told him that he would handle things on his end. Zhukov believed him. All that he needed to do was dictate the limits of the terms and let the Premier do the magic. There was a well-established model they could follow, that of the old Union system. It was only a matter of ratification and paperwork. For this morning, he needed only to observe and note the flow of negotiations and intervene when it became too hardline for his tastes.\n\nSo far, however, it was going smoothly. The Premier and the ministers of the future SSRs were friendly with one another. The terms, advanced by both sides, were readily accepted and put to paper. In Zhukov's mind, it was how the future Union should be. One where his presence wouldn't be needed. One where the military would only serve as an arm of the Party. He smiled as his Premier handed him a piece of paper and signed it without a shadow of a doubt."
 zhukov.29.a: "A premonition."

 zhukov.30.t: "The Day of Judgment"
 zhukov.30.d: "Ivan sat on the floor, his ears pressed against a wall made of corrugated metal sheets. He and his companions had hastily made this compound as a base of operation against the communists. Alas, the Revolutionary Front found where they had hidden. He was a member of the Liberation Army, recruited when the ROA "liberated" his village. A boy of around nineteen-years-old, Ivan did not have anywhere else to go. No relatives, with a senile mother and dead father. He joined the ROA to make a living for himself.\n\nThe sounds of battle were getting closer. The wall wasn't much impediment to the crack of rifle fire and blasts from mortar shells and grenades. It would be his first engagement, and most likely his last. Yet, a kind of serenity passed through him. His breathing was steady, and his heart did not give way to fear or excitement. He was calm. Death was coming, and he was ready. His life - what little there was - flashed before him. A childhood sweetheart, whose name he had long forgotten. His mother, who he had left behind. The tree where and his pals had played under. Above it all was a gentle, gentle whistling, shriller and shriller by the second.\n\nHe found himself flung away from his seat. He tried to sit up, failing again and again. He could not feel his legs. When he raised his hands to look at them, he found the left one a bloody, ashen stump. Ivan resigned himself to his fate, as his ears rang, his mind praying for peace to finally come home to Russia."
 zhukov.30.a: "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."

 zhukov.31.t: "A Blot of Smoke"
 zhukov.31.d: "Belikov entered the refinery as he did every morning, at five in the morning, exchanging places with the old guard. Their faces were smudged with grease and exhaustion. The new guard and the old guard did not exchange words, and simply passed each other in silence.\n\nThe ten hour shift began simply enough, without much pain or discomfort. It was simple, and it paid well, so Belikov did not complain, either out loud or inside his own mind.\n\nHe was well rested. For the first time in a long time, he hadn't been woken up by the sound of an anti-air gun firing above his apartment building, or the sound of bombs being dropped from some fascist who thought seeing innocent people running was a good time. It was nice to not hear the screams for once.\n\nAt five hours, he ate alone, as he always did, and tried to think about what it was like elsewhere. He didn't see many new people, especially so far out here.\n\nHe was ripped out of his concentration by the sound of a plane pass overheard, and just as he began to recognize the sound as a German Luftwaffe, he felt himself falling through the flooring and onto something hard. And then metal collapsed onto him, and he felt parts of himself mixed in with the dirt and the metal and whatever else existed here.\n\nFor nine hours, he laid under the metal. In the last hour of his life, he began to smell something burning.\n\nHe died screaming."
 zhukov.31.a: "Refineries can be replaced, but the ghosts remain there."

 zhukov.32.t: "A Flawed Structure"
 zhukov.32.d: ""Grand Marshal, I have something I wished to discuss with you," Zhukov looked up from the papers on his desk. It was Comrade Yakovlev. Yakovlev was a firm ally of Zhukov, and led a large faction of reformists within the Front.\n\n"Ah, Comrade Yakovlev, have a seat. What was it that you wished to discuss?" replied the Grand Marshal, motioning towards a chair in front of his desk.\n\n"I wished to discuss several flaws in how the Front is organized. Purely from an administrative point of view, I just don't believe our current model is sustainable. I understand the Red Army is crucial to our survival, but the people need their voices to be heard. The civilian populace needs more say in how things are run, our economy needs to less militarized, and the military needs checks and balances to keep it from devolving into an oppressive junta."\n\n"Comrade... The reforms you're proposing are... quite extensive. Are you sure this is 'purely administrative?' "\n\n"Grand Marshal, I assure you I hold no ill will towards the Revolution. I merely believe that the people need to play a bigger role in it."\n\n"Well, Comrade, I'll certainly consider it. However, I think we should wait until things are more stable around here before we rush into our reforms. Now, Comrade, I have lots of work to do at the moment," with that said, Zhukov returned to the reports stacked upon his desk.\n\n"...Understood, sir. Thank you for your time," Zhukov barely heard the door close a moment later."
 zhukov.32.a: "Under the conditions of dictatorship, the country will surely perish."

 #Tukhachevsky Regional Events
 tukharegional.1.t: "A Meeting with the Stavka"
 tukharegional.1.d: "The room the Grand Marshal waited in was austere. Outside of a long table adorned with maps and papers of all kinds, there were little comforts besides the wooden chairs. Silence reigned in the brightly lit room for a moment, as he stood.\n\nThen, they flocked to him, marching in as one. Generals, officers- all members of his general staff, saluting and taking seats before picking up dossiers with different titles. "WAR PLANS", one read. "ECONOMIC RENEWAL" read another. "SECURING CONTROL." "IDEOLOGICAL DOCTRINE."\n\nAll read what was inside the folders. Occasionally, a show of praise exited one member's mouth, or a brief question corrected within seconds. The Stavka were his men; and they would lead by example.\n\n"What do you think?" Tukhachevsky asked, though while his ears heard the assent, his eyes were looking out the single window. With the first of many productive meetings over the Stavka filed out, leaving the Grand Marshal looking out to the horizon."
 tukharegional.1.a: "Russia calls."

 tukharegional.2.t: "Rebuilding the West"
 tukharegional.2.d: "Despite the lack of civilians in any position of power within the new stratocracy, the Grand Marshal is aware of the current role that the people play - and more importantly, of the hardships they have suffered before and during now. Thus, one of the first things on his agenda is a set of massive sweeping construction and food allocation programs.\n\nFrom rubble, factories are built. From ashes, food lines are formed, with the army making sure the rations are equal. No one has too much or too little in the Grand Marshal's eyes. Any complaints are silenced, any unruliness is dealt with, and quotas are set.\n\nNo one needs to ask what happens to those who fail the quotas - but the harshness of rebuilding is for a good cause. Most are aware of what a rebuilt Russia means for their families, their friends, and themselves. So, a taxed construction worker ignores the lack of breaks, a mother waits her turn in the food line with an empty stomach, and a soldier keeps everything orderly, even as his thoughts linger less on the people he is supervising, and lean more towards hoping the food lines provide."
 tukharegional.2.a: "In the end, it will all be worth it."

 tukharegional.3.t: "Old Man Lobanov"
 tukharegional.3.d: "Andrei Lobanov was once a young Russian patriot devoted to the ideals of Bolshevism. When the Great Patriotic War broke out, Andrei was among the first in line to volunteer to join the Red Army. Even after he was hospitalized for an explosion, he insisted that he could continue to fight. When the war was over, he joined Yegorov's West Russian Revolutionary Front with his belief in communism driving him forward. He'd preach to his fellow soldiers with a copy of the communist Manifesto in hand, and he'd say that they only needed the words inside this book for guidance. With yet another defeat at the hands of the Germans however, his faith in Communism began to waver. Andrei realized he had no home to return to, and there was a chance he would never see it again. He had spent 20 years in the Red Army and had nothing to show for it.\n\nOld Man Lobanov walked through the streets of Arkhangelsk with nothing but a cane and a backpack. In reality, he was in his fifties, but he didn't look like it with the way he walked. As he walked, he considered that perhaps things would've turned differently if he had retired earlier instead. He might've been able to raise a good family and had a stable life far away from the cold and icy streets of Arkhangelsk. Lobanov placed his cane besides him and stopped to rest on a concrete staircase. Snowflakes began to drift down from the skies as he closed his eyes.\n\nWhen Lobanov opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a Red Army commissar with an envelope in his hand. The commissar simply said "This is for you." before handing him the letter. The commissar then walked down the sidewalk with 10 other envelopes just like it. Lobanov opened the envelope, and inside was the first pension he had ever received. While not much, this was the first time in 10 years that Lobanov felt hope, hope that he could forge a new life beyond Arkhangelsk. He picked up his cane and walked down the sidewalk with new determination."
 tukharegional.3.a: "A new beginning for an old soldier."

 tukharegional.5.t: "The Presidium Meets"
 tukharegional.5.d: "The Grand Marshal was seated in front of the members of the Presidium in the hall. A major new economic plan for the following year drafted by Tukhachevsky had just been announced in front of the Presidium, and now, the members were in deliberation. Finally, the Presidium reached a decision, and one of the senior members rose to speak. "The Presidium of the West Russian Revolutionary Front has come to the agreement to veto the proposed economic plan for critical reasons including a lack of protection for workers' safety and an insufficient supply of steel currently. For this reason, the Presidium recommends immediate amendments to the plan." He sat back down, and the hall was filled with silence as all the members watched Tukhachevsky as contemplated before he stood up. He silently nodded before signaling his guards. The members watched in shocked silence as the Grand Marshal walked past them."
 tukharegional.5.a: "No man rules alone."

 tukharegional.6.t: "The Presidium's Proposal"
 tukharegional.6.d: "The new economic proposal was to build a new railroad stretching from Arkhangelsk to Samara stretching 1,800 kilometers and using an estimated 10,000 workers. After enjoying overwhelming support in the Presidium, it soon reached the desk of the Grand Marshal. Tukhachevsky read the proposal 3 times before making a decision, but ultimately, the plan was stamped with a veto. At the next meeting of the Presidium, furious members presented a list of grievances against Tukhachevsky was presented, but it was simply dismissed by a "light" reminder that he was their superior."
 tukharegional.6.a: "All answer to the Grand Marshal."

 tukharegional.7.t: "Marx and Lenin"
 tukharegional.7.d: "The soldiers stood silently as their Commissar read a little red booklet. "Comrades, as soldiers in the Red Army, our one and only duty is to advance the interests of the proletariat across the globe. Even when we declare war, we attack to liberate the working class from capitalist oppression. All of you are revolutionaries in the great revolution against the capitalist ruling classes. We must never falter in our duty by retreating or suffering defeat. Every defeat for the Red Army is a victory for the bourgeoisie.""
 tukharegional.7.a: "Defeat is unacceptable."

 tukharegional.8.t: "On the Shoulders of Giants"
 tukharegional.8.d: "Leon Trotsky was greater than an ordinary revolutionary: he was the paramount leader of the Red Army. He was a hero that stood by Lenin during the October Revolution and defended the revolution during its early days by reforming the Red Army from a band of rag-tag militia to a regimented and disciplined army. His theories of permanent revolution aligned with Tukhachevsky's goal to spread the revolution through the Red Army, but while Trotsky's writings generally aligned with Tukhachevsky's own beliefs, the endless books of theory were lacking in areas of military and economic organization.\n\nThe Grand Marshal began to search through every word that Leon Trotsky had ever written, yet he could find nothing. After reading a sixth book with yet more useless theory, Tukhachevsky realized that he could not rely on the advice of the great men of the past. Revolutionaries write theory describing only their own observations, and Trotsky could not possibly have foreseen the Front's present situation. Tukhachevsky had to make decisions in the dark based only on his own experiences. Leon Trotsky set down the path before him, but only Tukhachevsky could continue walking."
 tukharegional.8.a: "Not even Trotsky can predict the future."

 tukharegional.9.t: "Protecting the Revolution"
 tukharegional.9.d: "This is the story of a man named Andrey. Andrey was an average to middling man who did very, very little in his life. He was not particularly brave, or particularly exemplary in any field, but he was smart. At least, smart enough to follow orders and keep his head down. Dimitry - one of his comrades was not particularly smart. A generous, popular man who occasionally sparred with the commissar and tended to win arguments, Dimitry led by example.\n\nThat is until one morning when Andrey awoke in his bunk to find four men in uniforms he did not recognize in the dimness of the early dawn moving around. "Get up." One spoke, as he moved without thinking. Out the door he walked with the rest of the squadron into the dim light mere minutes later, barely dressed. The uniformed men were joined by six more- all wearing SMERSH badges. Andrey had heard the stories of the secret police - counter intelligence squadrons. However, he did not expect them to be as equipped or as funded as the stories claimed.\n\nThe only other man besides the SMERSH operatives fully dressed and crisply awake was the commissar, and he was beaming as one spoke to him. "You have done well to inform us of treason within this unit." "We will make sure that no problems arise." "Your loyalty shall be rewarded." All stated, as Dimitry and his friends were dragged out of the line. What happened next clicked for Andrey in a single moment, as the operative next to the commissar turned.\n\n"Men. It has become apparent to us that there is treason within your unit. Thanks to the reports of a few dutiful soldiers, these traitors to the socalist revolution will be transferred to where they can cause no harm. In a few hours, you will be questioned." The operative spoke calmly, with a smile.\n\nDimitry and the soldiers closest to him were taken, and then came the questions. "What is your opinion of the Grand Marshal?" "Where were you or relatives located during the West Russian War?" "Do you know anyone who may have counter-revolutionary ties or sympathies?" Each and every minute, they had a new one. And Andrey?"
 tukharegional.9.a: "Andrey had no idea if he answered correctly."

 tukharegional.11.t: "The Soviet Constitution of [GetYear]"
 tukharegional.11.d: ""Article 4: Military service in the Red Army is an honorable duty of all Soviet citizens. The Soviet military is a force for revolutionary change around the world. As such, citizens must aid the Red Army in whichever way they are able," read the official speaking on top of the platform. A small crowd had gathered to watch the first reading of the new Soviet constitution which would be enacted soon after the Front was dissolved. He continued, "All Soviet citizens have the sacred duty to defend the motherland. Treason to the country - deserting the Red Army, impairing military power, and espionage is punishable with all the severity of the law.\n\nArticle 5: The Red Army's sole goal is to defend the revolution against reaction and spread socialism on Earth. The Grand Marshal may exercise his authority to overrule the civilian government if it is beneficial to this goal. The Grand Marshal can also take direct control of the country during times of revolutionary war against capitalist and fascist threats.\n\nArticle 6: All Soviet citizens have the right to participate in government. Red Army soldiers and veterans possess a higher right to serve as government officials and be elected as they have proven themselves as revolutionaries who are willing to fight to protect socialism. Soldiers who serve as government officials continue in the struggle to protect the revolution.""
 tukharegional.11.a: ""Article 7...""

 tukharegional.20.t: "Excerpts from an Essay"
 tukharegional.20.d: ""The Second International therefore, in its struggle with imperialism, understandably defended the militia system. This system became the tradition of the socialists. Gradually the real purpose of an army was forgotten; an active socialist war was not thought of, and the fundamental task of an army was considered to be what would disturb as little as possible the economic life of the country...\n\n...The guarantee of the existence of the soviet state is the main task; everything else - even economic requirements - must give way to it...\n\n...The quality of an army lies above all in its combat-readiness developed to the highest degree and in its precise and easy mobility. It is not easy to fulfill these requirements, and that is why they involve a long hard period of preparation. Only a regular army can receive such training. We thus observe that a Red Army can be only a regular army...\n\n...In view of this, every task of our republic must be most closely bound up with the tasks of the world revolution. This is, naturally, particularly valid for the question of the organization of our Red Army, the first cadre-troops of the World Red Army... Only such an army, composed of class-conscious revolutionaries, can be the instrument for the propagation of the world revolution and for the destruction of capitalism."\n\n- M. Tukhachevsky, "The Red Army and the Militia""
 tukharegional.20.a: "So opines the Grand Marshal."

 tukharegional.21.t: "Split Decisions"
 tukharegional.21.d: "Creaking door hinges interrupted the pen scrawls that filled Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky's office. He glanced up from his paperwork and glared at Comrade Ustinov approach, a folder nestled against his arm crook. "I haven't got all day, Ustinov," he said. "Speak up."\n\nUstinov cleared his throat as he read from the document. "Work on integrating the liberated zones continues apace, Comrade Grand Marshal," reported the general. "Food and materiel from the revolution's opponents are now being repurposed to the Red Army's needs at breakneck speed. My analysts estimate we will replenish our stockpiles within the month."\n\n"And?"\n\nOld paper flipped, its contents keenly scanned by bespectacled eyes. "The civilians. Rather, their economic activities - farming, industry, commerce - which the war has disrupted. Stavka awaits your advisement." Comrade Ustinov proffered the folder containing the rest of his report. "For your reading pleasure, Comrade Grand Marshal."\n\nInspection revealed that they also contained recommendations - two, in particular. The first suggested reintroducing old Bukharin's legacy to the Soviet proletariat, with the rationale of easing their burdens while the state rebuilds itself. The second contained less theory and more bluntness: collectivization of all war-critical resources at the Army's custody.\n\nIt took a minute for the Grand Marshal to skim through the detailed hundred-page document. He returned Ustinov's imperturbable gaze with the Red Army's inviolate orders."
 tukharegional.21.a: "We'll bring back the NEP. Dismissed."
 tukharegional.21.b: "Have the men pay visits, you have a list of them, don't you?"

 tukharegional.23.t: "Reappropriation"
 tukharegional.23.d: ""Oskar Pykhtinovich Pykhtin?"\n\nThe past five minutes' happenings had just caught up with Oskar and his sleep-addled thoughts. And now that he found himself face-to-face with the officer announcing his fate, what else could a simple farmer do but nod?\n\n"By order of the Grand Marshal," continued the military man, "your farm has been reappropriated for the revolutionary war effort." The words he read from the paper on his hands sounded distant, almost disinterested. "The Red Army will supervise its conversion into productive kolkhoze. You've been instructed to join your new brigade in the nearby village."\n\nHe motioned at the gunmen amassed by the lorry, who began advancing towards Oskar's house.\n\n"W-wait!"\n\nThe soldiers froze, giving Oskar tense stares as they leveled their guns at his outstretched arm. He gulped. "M-my belongings, at least," said the farmer pausingly.\n\nThe officer glanced to his fellows, then back to Oskar. Shrugging, he barked, "Ruslan. Grigory. Help our kulak friend here pack his bags."\n\nSeveral more minutes later, the new kolkhoznik was escorted from his late father's farm with nothing but the clothes on his knapsack, a rickety balalaika..."
 tukharegional.23.a: "...and Roza's faded smile."

 tukharegional.24.t: "Michal's First Day at Work"
 tukharegional.24.d: "It had taken some time to get the paperwork through - so difficult to get the Military Schools to agree to anything! - but Grigorovich had succeeded in getting Michal a day off. It was a special occasion, after all, and Michal was needed, as was everyone in the family.\n\nThey got up in the early morning, and Grigorovich's back ached like the devil as he packed the truck at the foot of his apartment. There was so much to handle - why had his grandfather chosen to go into the carpentry business in the first place? - and there was so little time to do it in. Michal groaned and dragged his feet, still bleary and grumpy from a sleepless night. Even with all the commotion, however, they managed to pull it off in under an hour. The wooden stools and turnstiles, the Venetian blinds, the cabinets - everything.\n\nAs they arrived at their new shop, a stonefaced bureaucrat walked up to them, handed them papers that seemed way lighter than was wise, and stalked off. Grigorovich shrugged and signed. As long as the shop was open, he'd always said, everything was negotiable.\n\nThe moving process was far swifter than the previous iteration. Most of the fragile wooden items had already been pre-packaged, and the only real difficulty was in moving the items that were ill-fitted to the narrow spaces of their new space. Some corridors had to be negotiated by tilting the chosen goods ever so slightly, so that they could inch into corners in the manner of a struggling grandmother.\n\nSlowly the new shop rose to completion as the sun pierced the horizon. Grigorovich took one last look at the paperwork - the New Economic Policy Committee had approved it, apparently - and beamed at his son, who was quietly shaving what appeared to be a decorative table-leg. He truly was, in the literal sense, a chip off the old block. And with the reopening of the ancestral shop, his children, too, would have a business to call home."
 tukharegional.24.a: "A heartwarming story."

 tukharegional.25.t: "A Step Forward"
 tukharegional.25.d: "Bukharin's economic legacy is...mixed to stay the least. His economic plans did little to prepare the Union for war against Germany. We were unable to provide the arms and ammunition necessary to fight back against the Nazis. This is the most shameful part of his economic legacy. But it wasn't exactly a failure.\n\nFor too long, this failure on the military and heavy industry front obscured the success in other areas. Under Bukharin, agricultural output increased, for example. And, more significantly, the Union made tremendous strides in terms of light, consumer industry. Not the industry that could kill Nazis, mind you, but the industries that provided the people of the Republics with wood, clothing, and canned foods. This turned the Soviet Union from an agrarian backwater to a nation that was industrialized, albeit at a lower level.\n\nEverything we do is for the defeat of Germany and the liberation of Russia. But we must recognize that an industrialized nation is not entirely devoted to the production of weapons of war. An industrialized nation also produces things that people can use in their daily lives. And one day, the revolution will be triumphant, and what would we do with a bunch of artillery plants then?\n\nLet us continue with these civilian industry programs. There's no reason that we cannot grow both our civilian and defense production at the same time. We will keep what worked before to make it work again. And one day, we will have a strong and vibrant socialist economy, just as Bukharin dreamed."
 tukharegional.25.a: "Efforts on all fronts will bring us on to Berlin!"

 tukharegional.26.d: "5 AM: Awake. Do morning calisthenics before eating a breakfast of fried egg sandwich. Say goodbye to my wife, before hopping on the bus to work.\n\n7 AM: Arrive at the Perm Motor Works. Clock in, and prepare for my shift at the factory. I am one of the technicians on the truck production lines, responsible for installing door panels.\n\n9:30 AM: My first break. Take five minutes to relieve myself, and grab a small glass of water. Then, back to work.\n\n12:00 PM: Lunch. Eat hot soup and tea from the factory canteen. Other coworkers have heard the rumor we will be switched onto aircraft, but have not seen any evidence of that. Have fifteen minutes to eat before going back to work.\n\n3:30 PM: Longer break than usual. Everyone is instructed to gather in the factory courtyard to hear a speech by a hero of the Red Army. Many have heard these exultations before, and it's doubtful they are having the effect they once did. Some fall asleep standing up. But everyone is thankful for the longer break.\n\n6:15 PM: Fire alarm. Everyone lines up to evacuate, but management stops us midway. They say it's in a different part of the factory. We sluggishly return to work. I see fire engines in the distance.\n\n7:00 PM: Quitting time. Clock out, and get on the bus to go home.\n\n8:00 PM: Dinner alone. Black bread, sausage, and vodka. My wife and kids have already eaten long ago. Children are already asleep.\n\n9:0 PM: In bed. Think to myself I really cannot live like this for much longer.\n\n9:45 PM: Asleep."

 tukharegional.30.d: "Overview: Project Indrik is proceeding as planned with only minor complications. We are already acquiring resources to begin weapon development, and we can expect the first prototypes in one year. Agents are still currently searching for experienced engineers and scientists that could assist with our endeavors while construction crews are beginning construction of laboratories and testing sites. Factories have been ordered to produce materials that are required for early testing. SMERSH is currently investigating a possible security breach. An engineer that was recruited and screened by our agents disappeared in the middle of the night. Breach is considered a low threat as he did not possess access to any highly classified documents. Family and friends are currently being held for questioning. Individual project overviews are listed below:\n\nProject Ferment: Team members have recommended that they develop adequate containment methods before beginning research. Request is currently being reviewed by administrators. Project can not proceed before this request is accepted or denied, but test subjects are currently being acquired.\n\nProject Leshiy: Team members are currently researching samples recovered from foreign sources. The utmost caution is being applied to handling of these samples. Many scientists are experienced in chemical weapon development, and preliminary results appear promising. Minor team is currently working on methods of defending hostile chemical attacks. Experimental gas mask is currently being developed.\n\nProject Shchuka: Construction has begun on a testing area in the White Sea. Environment is harsh and hindering progress. Engineers are currently beginning experimental design that allowed for higher resistance to atmospheric pressure and greater acceleration. Despite temporary setback, the construction team is expected to be finished by time that first prototype is built.\n\n"

 tukharegional.31.t: "The Extraordinary Training Protocol"
 tukharegional.31.d: "Drowning, he was drowning. His legs barely worked anymore, and the frigid cold seemed only to suck the life out of what was left of his torso. Oh, God, he had to get out of this goddamn river - with a gasp and a burst of savage energy he moved long-numbed arms and pulled himself another step towards the bank. Yes, the bank, and with it - oh, the relief was so painful Vladimir wanted to sob - dry land.\n\nDry land, dry land, dry land - his body drove itself like an engine running on the fumes of petrol after the last reserves. Only one thing mattered, survival, and there was exactly one path through to this goal. The rich, dry, healing touch of dry earth and snow. Vladimir heaved, heaved again and -\n\nHis hands touched, at last, the shore, and with one last twitch that took everything from him he heaved himself onto the dry land. Convulsing and vomiting, Vladimir spat and choked his air passages clean. Wiping away the last of the mucus, he looked around with the trained ease of a veteran. There, perhaps, he could build a shelter - not one that would protect from snow, but perhaps it would keep the predators away.\n\nIt was only Day Three, something in his adrenaline-soaked mind whispered. The exercise lasted five days, and he hadn't heard from anyone in his squad since the second. What the hell had happened to Military Command?\n\nHe soon got his answer: coming back from a firewood-gathering trip that evening, Vladimir noticed something bloated and swollen, in military fatigues, washing up on shore. What was left of his dinner was quickly expelled over the waterlogged remains of a man, the Soviet medal still visible on his left breast - and his dogtag strangling his fattened neck."
 tukharegional.31.a: "They don't care if we die."

 tukharegional.32.t: "Hard Times..."
 tukharegional.32.d: "Tukhachevsky stood in trance, his sharp posture contrasting the rest of the Stavka that lay seated beside him. Through his binoculars he spied the massed bodies below, scared boys drawn into a frenzy as they passed through tire swings, wooden stockades and dead sprints.\n\nIn particular, he came to focus on one subject, a shivering wreck from somewhere south.\n\nLeft and right, to and fro, the poor boy's legs became stiff trunks in the mud. With each beleaguered step, the subject of Tukhachevsky's intrigue came closer to his next tumble. His comrades passed by him often, trading glances as he fell. Finally, after many failed attempts, the boy simply collapsed. Defiant in the face of duty, he lay flat and unmoving. Tukhachevsky remained still for a moment, pondering the scene.\n\nFor every hundred men dedicated to the cause, there would those who found solace in the dirt. Men that cried out in woe, decrying the miserable conditions of combat and the herculean responsibility upon their shoulders. To carry the weight of a Russian rebirth alongside your rifle and pack was no easy task.\n\nYet, despite the undeniably human state the boy found himself in, Tukhachevsky felt nothing but cold disdain for him. The life of a soldier, dying with dignity for the liberation of his home, could never compare to the collective misery inflicted upon the proletariat of the world. From the countless cripples, made prisoners in their own bodies by Luftwaffe bombs, to the near starving slaves of Germania.\n\nTukhachevsky muttered something cruel to an aid, and watched as a Commissar descended upon the motionless body below. In his army, there would be no breaking points..."
 tukharegional.32.a: "...create strong men."

 tukharegional.33.t: "My Manya..."
 tukharegional.33.d: "I hold considerable doubt that my words might reach you, for the state of our nation necessitates it pass through countless hands on its way to your residence. However, as this letter is composed in the spirit of defiance, I shall gamble against the odds. It has been long since we last spoke. Too long I fear.\n\nYour Husband, the young idealist who set off from our little Orenburg farmstead, is no more. In his place stands an absence; a hollow shell where a man ought to be. I wish I could report a feeling of glory, or some sense that we were progressing towards fulfillment of the ultimate cause. Instead, all I have to offer is misery.\n\nI am surrounded by bitter, scornful men, who do their very best to make sure each day is less distinguishable from the last. Each morning, we are rudely awoken to the sound of a commissar banging a spoon upon a metal pot. From there comes our run, a grueling miles long journey from which the only respite is the beauty of sunrise.\n\nWith little time to think between drills, I have learned the true meaning of conservation. Everything can be reused or redirected to a more opportune time, be it scraps of food, padding for boots, or even willpower itself.\n\nMy body, gaunt and slender, would likely be unrecognizable, where you to lay eyes on it again. It is foreign to me, the few times I have spied myself in reflection. It seems to move autonomously, responding predictably to the same stimuli, and directing itself to areas my authority will never reach.\n\nI will not lie and claim that there is any dignity in my routine. Truthfully, it is an alienating and sorrowful process. However, if there is anything good I can report, it is this; I know I will never be the same. With each pointless harassment, and each grueling obstacle course, I become stronger. In both mind and body, I can feel my tolerance hardening. Nothing will phase me, as I suppose it should be if I am to face the fascist hordes. May peace be with you darling, and with any luck, I will emerge from this suffering the patron of a liberated motherland."
 tukharegional.33.a: "Yours truly, Dmitry."

 tukharegional.34.t: "A Day in the Life"
 tukharegional.34.d: ""DOWN!" yelled his commander, and without thinking Dmitry dove forwards. His face smashed into the mud, and for a moment the world was dark, cold, and earthy. Then he was moving forwards, crawling on his belly, his uniforms in need of a stern washing. He saw Vladimir to his left, face red with exertion, and smiled. The Moscow refugee's pudge hadn't melted off during the long trek from home, he supposed he shouldn't be surprised that it wouldn't under their hard training. Nonetheless, what his companion lacked in physique he more than made up for in muscle. When the time came for rubble drills, and they had to practice hurriedly clearing a bombed bunker, Vlad's strength would come in handy for the unit.\n\n"UP! RUN!" Yelled the commander, and the soldiers began to sprint to the next stage of the obstacle course. Dmitry scrambled to his feet, and rushed forwards. He remembered how he had grimaced and moaned during the early days of his service, and felt a renewed burst of speed. He found himself at the next stage, among the guns, and began to assemble his rifle. For once his fingers didn't fail him, when he looked up, he saw to his great surprise that he had finished first.\n\nLater, Dmitry and his unit would celebrate in true Russian style. There would be music, food, and a flood of vodka. More likely than not he would wake up with a nameless girl in his bed and a throbbing headache, but neither would last long through the hard soldier's life and cold northern sun. He was king for a day, but a fighter for life, and the true war had not even begun."
 tukharegional.34.a: "A good life, he supposed."

 tukharegional.35.t: "A Change of Guard"
 tukharegional.35.d: "The old captain drew deeply and breathed, cigarette smoke fuming from his nose like the breath of a dragon. The old high hit his brain, coloring his thoughts a faint shade of pink - although, truth be told, everything seemed a little less colorful with each passing year. Perhaps it was the inevitable result of lost youth, the passage of time, or perhaps the captain was simply getting older and crankier.\n\nHe chuckled to himself. He knew which option he'd bet money on, and it wasn't some airy-fairy nonsense about time.\n\nWell, it was lucky that he didn't need smell to help with shipbuilding. He returned his attention to the dense blueprint in front of him: the Ognevoy class was a son of a bitch to build, but no one could say it wasn't elegant. His eyes ran up and down the elegant curves of the deck, the spindly masts and the expanses of the engine and boiler rooms - yes, there was an almost sexual energy to its raw dynamism, something only he could appreciate. He'd often joked with his friends that he'd married a ship instead of a woman.\n\nIt was a shame about his own destroyer, really. It'd broken his heart far worse than the retreat to Arkhangelsk, the sinking in port. And she hadn't even fired her first volley! When the West Russian Government had contacted him with the promise of settling accounts, the captain had agreed without a second thought.\n\nNow, as he watched something larger and better than the Ognevoy class rise in the dockyard before him, the captain knew he'd made the right choice. This new beauty was not, would never be, Ozornoy. But it could be for someone else what Ozornoy had once been for him: the love of his life, and the light in his harbor."
 tukharegional.35.a: "A final job, and a parting glance."

 tukharegional.36.t: "Essay Writing"
 tukharegional.36.d: "In the rare occasions where Mikhail Tukhachevsky is beset by doubt, the Grand Marshal finds solace in pen and paper. Alone but for his thoughts, a flickering oil lamp and Shosta's Second Waltz, so far away from the sniveling idiots who call themselves Stavka - it is here where the general can ponder, reflect, and resolve his battles within and without. The written word has failed him less than his generals' own consensus on both accounts.\n\nAnd so he wrote. Past theories and present practice mingled with the ink on his fountain pen, leaving martial dialectic behind every stroke. The Red Army had fifty years of either to draw from; so it was that its battles formed the object of Tukhachevsky's reflections. The two Tsaritsyns. Moscow. Suvorov. Syktyvkar. Comparisons and contrasts between the Front and its enemy: troop deployments, tactics, supplies. Mistakes aplenty, from the first moreso. The oil lamp flickered and waned as afternoon heat gave way to evening's chill - and still Tukhachevsky wrote.\n\nOnly when he caught the Moon's pallor did the Grand Marshal stay his aching hand. Not enough, but it will have to do. Pouring himself another shot from a half-empty vodka bottle, Mikhail reclined against his seat as he read through his newest essay.\n\nAs sunlight peeked from over the Northern Dvina, Arkhangelsk greeted another day with shattering glass and discoherent screaming."
 tukharegional.36.a: ""The Red Army's gone to shit!" echoed the city's morning air."

 tukharegional.37.t: "Come to Your Senses!"
 tukharegional.37.d: ""Honored Comrades!" His voice rang clear in the briefing room, bouncing off its spartan spaces. "First, a humble thanks from this servant of the Revolution to the many in this room who have helped bring about its success." The room smiled and nodded, cheerful in its complacency. "But I also wish to address some addenda to that statement."\n\n"First!" He loved how crisp his voice sounded in the morning, like an old drillmaster. "We must acknowledge that our love of numbers made us blind to their quality. Yes, the Red Army is a Proletarian Force, and yes, we rely on our workers for all things. But we cannot expect that sending tons of differentiated men into the fray, bereft of a common drill standard, weapons handling pedigree or language, will make a difference in battle. That was what made victory so difficult, and defeat so imminent, in every battle we fought against overwhelming odds."\n\n"Second, we must no longer rely on the rhetoric of heroism! It will never be enough to cast our men into heroic defeats, unless all of you want to stand on heroic gallows and call the name of Lenin as you jump into martyrdom! We have hidden behind this cowardly rhetoric and made us all laughingstocks. No, from now on we must use men smartly and precisely, or soon not even madmen will think to follow us."\n\n"Finally! We must change the very nature of our soldiers themselves if we are to succeed. I spoke on quality - now I speak of organization. Gentlemen, it is time to wake your ideas up - I mean, come to your senses! We cannot claim to run a working army when we cannot even keep tabs on how many men we have employed at one time. If we can change these flaws, victory shall soon await the Stavka, and Russia. If we cannot - we should prepare to enter the martyrdom due to all failed and foolish martyrs, for that is where we are headed.""
 tukharegional.37.a: "Yes, Grand Marshal!"

 tukharegional.38.t: "Entry no. 374"
 tukharegional.38.d: ""Napoleon crossed the River Neman with 400,000 of the finest sons France has ever birthed. Veterans of Italy, Egypt, Spain and Germany, each man within his Grande Armée more than equaled ten from the Coalition in a hundred different qualities: skill, discipline, élan. With them the Emperor glided from triumph to triumph; by the Patriotic War, his Empire had held the continent by its talons. That the Tsar would offer resistance against an invincible force is laughable.\n\n"There was no such force six months later. Borodino happened, Moscow happened - but above all 'General Winter' happened, cutting away at the Armée's ranks like a swarm of flies descending upon a fat pig's carcass. Of the 400,000 that left Poland, less than a tenth returned to France. History tells us all too well what happened next."\n\n"I know what those fools call me behind my back. If only they knew how terribly right they are.""
 tukharegional.38.a: "From men of bronze to men of dirt."

 tukharegional.39.t: "At a Juncture"
 tukharegional.39.d: ""Ilya Starinov?"\n\n"Yes, Comrade Grand Marshal. One of our missing colonels according to Stavka's records, presumed dead in the aftermath of Operation Suvorov."\n\n"And so we now know where this... man of ours, is. Answer me this once, Ustinov: what does one deserter among thousands matter to the Front?"\n\n"The Ural Guard."\n\nGrand Marshal of the West Russian Revolutionary Front Mikhail Tukhachevsky was silent. Dmitry Ustinov let his superior stew for a half-minute more before elaborating.\n\n"You asked for advice on how to 'whip the Front's cowards into shape'. I feel the example Comrade Starinov has demonstrated with their Guardsmen shows merit: grueling training to forge elites out of our conscripts. As invincible and legendary as when Comrade Yegorov drew breath."\n\n"Or we can resort to Ieronim's own suggestion, though I harbor my own doubts over the fruits his... 'Spartan', discipline would bear. As always, Comrade Grand Marshal, the choice is yours.""
 tukharegional.39.a: "Interesting."

 tukharegional.40.t: "West Russia Requests Oil"
 tukharegional.40.d: "It seems that the Russians are always full of surprises. We had all but counted them out in the struggle against global fascism, but although little news escapes the blood and snow of the war-torn north we now have multiple reliable reports of a super-warlord that has defeated all opposition. This state, if it can be called that, shares the name and structure of the West Russian Revolutionary Front of old, but possesses a drastically more militaristic attitude towards its enemies, and a much harsher one to its own citizens.\n\nWhatever the peculiarities of this new Soviet Union, they are certainly an enemy of the Nazis, and thus share crucial interests with the government of the United States. It is for this purpose that the CIA has begun a program to send drilling equipment to this nation in order for it to reach resource self sufficiency and thus be better equipped to fight the Germans in their inevitable confrontation.\n\nThe now de-facto ruler of all of West Russia - Grand Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, appears to be a man of many talents. A brutal man, a brilliant commander, and a born soldier. Whether such things have the makings of a good ally remains to be seen, but he certainly is willing to help with our most important endeavor - the destruction of Nazi Germany and the un-making of all its vile works."
 tukharegional.40.a: "They could come in useful."
 tukharegional.40.b: "Our interests are better served elsewhere."

 tukharegional.41.t: "Letter from Arkhangelsk"
 tukharegional.41.d: "To the President of America:\n\nThe Red Army brings good tidings from Arkhangelsk. Since the restoration of order in West Russia, we have recovered much of our strength, both in men and in materiel, and with every day near the apex we had achieved under Grand Marshal Alexander Yegorov. For now our guns are pointed eastwards, at the petty warlords and revisionists who dare sully the Union's old lands - but soon the Motherland's bulwark shall return to its rightful places west.\n\nBe informed that the Red Army will gladly receive your country's military, economic, and diplomatic assistance once we resume the Great Patriotic War. You may receive further communiques from us once matters within Russia are duly resolved.\n\nSigned,\nMikhail Tukhachevsky\nGrand Marshal of the West Russian Revolutionary Front"
 tukharegional.41.a: "They could come in useful."
 tukharegional.41.b: "Our interests are better served elsewhere."

 tukharegional.42.t: "The US Agrees!"
 tukharegional.42.d: "Against the cruel, flagellating wind walked a tired crew. Fifteen weary travellers, adorned in thick fur hauled a long flat sled. As they approached the city center, sporadic cries escaped their lips; spiteful declarations against aching muscles, frozen eyelashes, and the cursed clouds above that had wrought such fortune. Slowly but surely, the men made their way towards a depot and with a lift of its large metal door, they found themselves greeted by a commissar.\n\nAlexei was not blind to the frostbitten faces before him, nor was he callous towards the wellbeing of those under his command. If today's haul was what he expected however, any amount of pain would be worthwhile. Three zip ties, a knife, and a heave would reveal what lie below the covered tarp. As the snow was brushed from the steel surface, a grin exploded Alexei's lips.\n\n"Comrades! The American shipment has arrived!""
 tukharegional.42.a: "Black gold for a red struggle."

 tukharegional.43.t: "The US Refuses!"
 tukharegional.43.d: "Bad news. It seems that the filthy capitalist Americans are more concerned with their petty political squabbles and oppressing the working class than actually confronting Fascism. The United States has refused to respond to our request for oil and drilling equipment, dooming the Red Army to subsistence technology, even as we struggle against the Nazi War Machine.\n\nWe will of course continue our march against chaos and Fascism alike, but without the Americans, this will be much harder. In time of course, the forces of Socialism will triumph against all of our enemies within the wasted, and then shortly afterwards in Europe. Perhaps then the Americans will finally respect the capabilities of the Red Army, and respect us as an equal, but by then it will be too late. With Socialism cemented in the old world, how long before the tides of change reach the new?"
 tukharegional.43.a: "We didn't need them anyway."

 tukharegional.44.t: "Americans Recognise Us"
 tukharegional.44.d: "Excellent news. The American Government has formally recognized us as the rightful ruler of all of Russia, a move that opens the door to greater amounts of material support and diplomatic aid in our confrontation with the Nazi war machine.\n\nAlthough some within our government had been skeptical of the willingness of the Bourgeois American republic to aid socialism, to the point of doubting the worth of asking at all, it seems that the more pragmatic direction of Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky prevailed after all, and paid off in spades.\n\nNow with the capabilities of the most powerful nation in the world behind us, is there any hope for the Nazi empire? Soon our soldiers will no longer go into battle clothed in rags and raiments, but in the finest American camouflage and flak jackets. They will no longer wield antique rifles from the last war, but M16s and high grade rocket launchers. As we have dreamed for years, the world will soon know the true power of a fully equipped and prepared Soviet Military, may the fascists and petty-despots trimble in fear."
 tukharegional.44.a: "Together, we are invincible!"

 tukharegional.45.t: "Americans Refuse Recognition"
 tukharegional.45.d: "During the last war, as the Nazi beast surged Eastwards into the heartland of the motherland, we told ourselves desperately that the Americans would not let us die. Rivals we were - on opposite sides of the line between Communism and Capitalism - but surely we thought, they would not let us fall to our mutual Fascist enemy? Surely they knew that once it had feasted on Europe, it would not be long before the Nazis turned their evil gae to the Americas?\n\nBut it seems that now, as then, we put too much faith in the United States. We had hoped that they would recognize the new Soviet Union as the rightful sovereign of all Russia, but it seems that they were blinded by their instinctual capitalist hatred of the proletariat. Had they given us the simple honor of treatment as an equal, we might have stood together, fighting as friends against the common foe.\n\nBut now, denied this most basic of requests, we are doomed once more to walk our road alone. Though our foes might proclaim this lack of recognition as indicative of weakness, we will defeat them, even if it is without allies. And then when the Fascists and madmen are defeated, we will not forget who aided us in our darkest hour, and who did not."
 tukharegional.45.a: "It was a mistake to trust these people in the first place."

 tukharegional.46.t: "Solemn Vow"
 tukharegional.46.d: "Ustinov squinted against the harsh sunlight reflecting off of the fresh snow, his eyes narrowed into slits. Samara had once again been brought into compliance with the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and the economic minister felt a strange creeping sense of nostalgia and childhood horror slip into his gut. Samara, the city of his hated youth, the city of crushing poverty that had ground every penny and ounce of joy that the young Ustinov and his mother had.\n\nHe remembered catching rats in the dark, blinding them with a flashlight and slamming their heads against the brick walls of their hovel. Meat was scarce in those days, and bones peeked out from thin shawls of skin. Ustinov knew that he had been lucky to have rats to eat, he and his mother had heard of what other villages had been forced to do to acquire precious protein.\n\nUstinov remembered hand feeding his sick and dying mother crusts of bread and a thin rat soup, comforting the woman who had been his only true friend in his young life.\n\nThe economic minister blinked sudden tears from his eyes and swallowed his pain. Samara would be rebuilt. Russia would be rebuilt. The times of starvation and scarcity would come to an end."
 tukharegional.46.a: "Never again, this we swear."

 #Zhukov Regional Events

 zhukovregional.1.t: "The Proud Red Army"
 zhukovregional.1.d: "The Internationale blared as Grand Marshal Zhukov overlooked the assembled soldiers, these proud sons of Socialism, faces beaming with triumph, as they presented the flags of the Front's defeated enemies, hanging low beneath the vibrant red banners of the victorious revolution. The soldiers tossed the captured standards of the enemies of Russian progress at the feet of their commanders. As each set of flags hit the cold hard stone of Lenin Square, The Marshal reflected on the reactionary regimes each of them represented. The Komi Republic, its divided, multi-colored flag, reflective of the deep divides that existed within that fractious bourgeois state. The black-gold-white tricolor of the Principality of Vyatka, representative of a decrepit collection of aristocrats so desperate to claw their way back to power they assisted the German dogs in despoiling the very land they claimed paternal affection for. The lying banner of the "Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia". Many Russians were seduced by Vlasov's promise of liberation, but behind that St. Andrew's Cross marched the jackboots of Fascist subjugation. On the other hand, the mad jackals of the Aryan Brotherhood, in their quest to "purify" the Russian nation, bore the swastika with insane, shameless pride. As the parade marched on, Marshal Zhukov noticed that the proudest faces were those of the grizzled veterans, those who remembered the West Russian War. They remembered the triumph at Volgograd. They remembered Moscow and Leningrad when final victory against the hated Germans seemed so close, only to be cruelly wretched away by vile reactionary traitors! Now, the banners of those same traitors lay at their feet, and the revitalized Red Army stood poised to cross the Urals and reunite Russia once and for all!\n\nZhukov knew that much work lay ahead of him, but today, he allowed himself to bask in the warm glow of victory."
 zhukovregional.1.a: "Krasnaya Armiya Vseh Silney!"

 zhukovregional.2.t: "High Moral Standards"
 zhukovregional.2.d: "Vasily whistled as he walked back to camp. It had been a short, victorious battle against some warlord who thought that ruling one village gave him the right to call himself a Tsar. One afternoon's work from Vasily and his comrades in the 34th People's Infantry forcefully dissuaded that would-be aristocrat from his quest for a crown.\n\n"Hey Vasily! You only whistle when you've found something good. What is it this time?"\n\n"Drinks are on me when we get back to civilization, Yuri!" Vasily said as he reached into his pocket to display his latest trophy, a small gold necklace picked up from a house he was holed up in during the battle.\n\n"Nice! That should fetch, what, 50 rubles, at least?"\n\n"Maybe a little more, maybe a little less, all I care about is that this is our ticket to a proper celebration tonight!"\n\n"Halt! What have you got there comrade?" The sten-faced commissar appeared from in front of the pair from seemingly nowhere. Striding up to Vasily, he snatched the golden vodka-ticket from the dismayed soldier's hand. "Did you take this to sell, or because it brings out your eyes? Come with me, Ivanovich."\n\nVasily ended up in a brig that night instead of a bar. The necklace was put into a bag with several other looted baubles to be returned to the village the next morning, for as the commissar chided before ushering Vasily to his cell, "The Red Army is meant to liberate the oppressed from their chains, not their valuables.""
 zhukovregional.2.a: "So much for that vodka."

 zhukovregional.3.t: "A Stain on the Uniform"
 zhukovregional.3.d: "The contents of the letter from Zhukov did not come as a surprise to Tukhachevsky. The only surprise was how long it had taken to receive it. After his failed effort to take control of the Front following Yegorov's death he' half expected to be executed for treason. Instead Zhukov had seen the bigger picture and let bygones be bygones, for the moment anyway. Even his greatest rival could not deny Tukhachevsky's talents as a commander, and so he had been allowed to help retake western Russia. Now that the front was secure it seemed his services were no longer needed.\n\nThe letter accused him of "unprofessional and reckless behavior in the field" that was "not suitable for an officer of the Red Army." Tukhachevsky knew that was horse shit and so did Zhukov. He had commanded his men the same way he always had, efficiently and mercilessly. He knew that the Union's enemies would offer no quarter in war. They hadn't the last time they invaded, and Tukhachevsky refused to weaken his forces just for the sake of appearances. Apparently appearances were important to Zhukov though, important enough to fire one of his best generals. It would not just be him either. Tukhachevsky expected many of his subordinates would receive similar letters soon, if they hadn't already. Back in the old days purges had been carried out with bullets. In Zhukov's Union it seemed they were now done with notarized letters.\n\nHe folded the letter and put it away. The end had finally come for him, but not in the way he had expected. Maybe Zhukov knew that he had expected death and decided to torment him instead. Rather than grant him a quick, clean ending, Tukhachevsky would be allowed to linger on, forced to find an answer to the question he had hoped he would never have to ask."
 zhukovregional.3.a: "What next?"

 zhukovregional.4.t: "March of the Red Army"
 zhukovregional.4.d: "Zhukov stood above the marching soldiers, watching them drill relentlessly as they had been doing so for the last hour. If they didn't have enough weapons or resources for war, every soldier would have to be well trained in elite fighting methods to overcome the enemy. One well-trained veteran was better than ten regulars in Zhukov's mind.\n\n"Your marching break is over, back to pushups!" Yelled the drill instructor, walking between each individual, intently making sure every man was putting in the effort. "Come on, you can do thirty Dominik! Or do you want to do laps again?"\n\nThere were weak links, of course, thought Zhukov. They were in every army. Some had more than others. However, the stronger each man was would help them in the field. Weakness could very well mean death. "Instructor, I want to see these men marching again. Make it double time."\n\n"You heard the Grand Marshal, march! I better not see any slow steps!"\n\nThe tired men began to march in place once again, making sure to impress the Grand Marshal. They did not want to see what would happen if they made a mistake. Being in the Red Army sure was hard work."
 zhukovregional.4.a: "Get those feet higher!"

 zhukovregional.5.t: "Hero of the Soviet Union"
 zhukovregional.5.d: "Yuliy waited for his turn on the stage, knowing he had finally achieved his careers' dream: Hero of the Soviet Union. Saviour of Communism. One of the bravest in the Red Army. Years of fighting Germans, collaborators, and capitalists had finally paid off. As he continued to wait, he watched the group of Red Army generals congratulating the man in front of Yuliy for facing down a Finnish tank and destroying it with the only grenade he had left. The man smiled and stepped off the stage, returning to his compatriots. "Yuliy Volkov, please come to the stage," said a voice from one of the generals.\n\nYuliy approached the platform, proudly walking up the stairs and grinning all the way. "Volkov, your heroic actions in Onega are those of legend. Your story is like many others, yet incredible nonetheless. You fought bravely leading your men into Anti-Communist Volunteer Guard fortifications and creating a breakthrough into Onega. Your rescue during the ambush on the Onega Bridge will be a story told far into the future. As a private, you bravely defended your motherland in the West Russian war and fought for the good of Russia in the assault of Moscow. If anyone deserves Hero of the Soviet Union, it is you."\n\nPride overcame Yuliy as the medal was pinned to his chest. He knew he would continue to serve in the Red Army as the union continued to reunify Russia. Maybe they would even create a medal just for him!"
 zhukovregional.5.a: "A great story!"

 zhukovregional.6.t: "Our Two Options"
 zhukovregional.6.d: "With our two options decided, it's time we choose. Our diplomatic choice could very well determine the future of Russia.\n\nOur first option is to align with the Organization of Free Nations and America. While befriending America could come in handy with the wars against Germany and the other Russian powers, it could very well show we are betraying our very ideology. America could aid us economically and militarily, but a more socialist option is also apparent.\n\nInstead of aligning with the OFN, we could choose our own alliance, the ComIntern. Befriending other socialist nations in the world would not betray our ideology. It could also be perfect for us on the world stage, displaying our strength and socialist solidarity. Unfortunately, no ComIntern could provide what the US could, and may very well weaken us in the long run.\n\nWe must choose an approach, as diplomacy is necessary if we want any support at all in reuniting Russia. Do we choose America, sacrificing ideology for aid? Or do we choose the ComIntern, and perhaps unite the socialist world but alienate the Americans?"
 zhukovregional.6.a: "We must decide."

 zhukovregional.7.t: "Arrival in D.C."
 zhukovregional.7.d: "The plane began its slow descent to the Dulles International Airport, circling once before completing its landing. Alexander Yakovlev was glad to finally be off the long flight. His trip to America was a rather bumpy one, and he didn't usually like flying.\n\nSent to America to negotiate a trade deal and request economic aid, Yakovlev was happy to meet with the Americans. Having visited multiple times before, he was all but used to the country and its people. This time would even be an official visit! If all went as planned, he would even get to meet the President.\n\nIt was also lucky that Yakovlev knew English. He was one of the only few of the higher echelon members of the front that knew it, actually. No one really studied it back in the warlord days, and most couldn't even travel to English speaking countries.\n\nBut that was the past, and if Yakovlev was successful in these few weeks he knew a partnership that could last decades could be built between Russia and the United States."
 zhukovregional.7.a: "Hopefully the Americans greet us with open arms."

 zhukovregional.8.t: "A Historic Handshake"
 zhukovregional.8.d: "This was it, the moment Yakovlev had been waiting for. He had finally gotten to meet with the President of the United States, and they had talked about so much more than just trade agreements. There was a lot more to know about America than Yakovlev realized. And of course, he mentioned how things were back home. They were much better since the last time Yakovlev visited America, that was for sure! While his charms may have been useful in the negotiations, now he would need some different charms. The big moment was upon them. The two would appear before the press and show the world the partnership between Russia and America.\n\nStepping outside the White House doors and speaking fluent English, Yakovlev turned and said, "President [USA.GetLeader], it's been an honor to meet you. I'm very happy about the partnership between our two nations. Open trade will surely benefit us both."\n\n"I feel the same, Mr. Yakovlev," said the President. "I do hope this partnership continues, and I promise I will try everything I can to persuade Congress the benefits of our alliance. I'm glad you chose to be with us to move onwards into the future."\n\nYakovlev held out his hand, smiling at the President and at the cameras. The President shook it as they were blinded by camera lights from the countless reporters and journalists."
 zhukovregional.8.a: "Smile for the camera!"

 zhukovregional.9.t: "Appeal for Recognition - USA"
 zhukovregional.9.d: "We have received a message from the Georgy Zhukov, Grand Marshal of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They wished to be recognized as a legitimate state, and the legitimate government of West Russia.\n\nShould we accept, it will show our close alignment with the front and may anger some of the other Russian governments and Germany. However, it will no doubt expand our partnership and may even bring the front closer to us, possibly even giving us a future ally.\n\nWest Russia is also producing a large number of goods, and recognizing their government will surely better our trade relations. However, we do not share a similar government with the front, us being a capitalist republic and them being more or less a communist dictatorship. It may go against our values of democracy, but hey, at least they hate fascists, right? Zhukov also seems inclined to reform, so it may very well be in our interests. Still..."
 zhukovregional.9.a: "Recognize them. We need as many friends as we can get."
 zhukovregional.9.b: "We should wait, Russia remains ever-changing."

 zhukovregional.10.t: "America Recognized Us!"
 zhukovregional.10.d: "It appears America has recognized our government, a major victory for us diplomatically. This means relations between us and the Americans will grow every stronger and opens up even more options for us in the future. Trade between our two nations can also increase which should hopefully help us economically. It appears sending Yakovlev has definitely increased our chances!"
 zhukovregional.10.a: "Our friends in America will surely help us achieve victory!"

 zhukovregional.11.t: "America Declined!"
 zhukovregional.11.d: "Unfortunately, we have news that America did not recognize us. While this is a blow for us on the world stage and at home, it is not a total loss. We can still get assistance out of them, such as trade deals and economic aid. This economic aid will be especially important in rebuilding West Russia. So while it may be a loss, perhaps things could change once Russia is fully reunited and America sees our true strength."
 zhukovregional.11.a: "A loss, but understandable."

 zhukovregional.12.t: "Yakovlev's Request"
 zhukovregional.12.d: ""I must say, Ambassador, this - ah - wonton soup, is that the name? It truly is a jewel in the rough." Yakovlev could barely keep his mouth empty enough to speak, and the Ambassador chuckled in what was only half-embarrassment. The diner was half-empty, anyway, and it'd only been through what was essentially a bribe that the owner had been convinced to keep the store open till now. Nothing but the slow whirl of the fan to interrupt their conversation.\n\n"It's an honor, on behalf of the staff of this restaurant, to receive you, Ambassador." The owner, 20-odd years of growth stacked in a stocky pile of flesh, nodded beside him with what he could only describe as a manure-eating grin. "We welcome you to come back, should you desire it." The man had some nerve calling this half-baked place a restaurant (and charging like one, too) but he certainly knew how to exploit a moment.\n\nThe Ambassador waved him off. "Mr. Yakovlev, it's a pleasure to see you immersed in our culture - but I'm sure you have bigger things you want to discuss." For a long while he was met with silence - only the slurping of noodles and soup echoed into the night, and the sound of the fan-blades cutting through air.\n\nYakovlev finished the dregs of his bowl, a self-satisfied smile painting his thin features, and spoke. "Right, right, to business. You and I both know, of course, that the Union stands unsteady. We do not have the privilege of a developed economy, and certainly we do not have the grain-fields or livestock capital to make wonton as massive as the ones I just ate. To say nothing of our military...it has been a while since Soviet engineering was keeping pace with Germania."\n\nHe nodded to the skyline before them, a dirty-neon scribble on the windows. "I know - and my Government is certain - that we will catch up. We must. But there is much work to be done. Can I have your assurance that the largest anti-fascist nation in the world will aid its sibling until that work ends?""
 zhukovregional.12.a: "We will hold back nothing for our friends."
 zhukovregional.12.b: "Perhaps another day, Mr. Yakovlev."

 zhukovregional.13.t: "A Night-Time Communique"
 zhukovregional.13.d: ""Wonton soup." The voice was so cold it could have flash-frozen the Volga. "You asked the ambassador of our benefactor, the United States of America, to be taken to eat - wonton soup. Wonton. Soup." Silence resumed.\n\n"I, ah, I can explain." Yakovlev took a deep breath. "We had to find a place where it would be conducive to raise the sensitive topics you have mentioned. Foreign aid and soldiers, in a pricey establishment? No, that would be passé." Yes, this defense was going well. He pressed on.\n\n"So I asked for something so extraordinary its location would bypass the ears of any potential surveillance. And who would think of eating wonton soup in an American city? A perfect plan, da?" The sibilant background swallowed his words.\n\n"We will mention this at a later stage, Alexander. For now, what news of our requests?"\n\nThe Russian leaned close with the unthinking nature of old routines. "I think we've got it in the bag. The Americans seem receptive, and we'll speak later in the week regarding possible air-routes for supply chains. I assume we'll clear the hurdles regarding the air-defense networks?"\n\n"Yes, Yakovlev. We will clear the air-routes. Assure our new partners that we will cause no trouble for them." Another interlude. "Oh, and Yakovlev?""
 zhukovregional.13.a: ""Good job. But no more wonton soup requests, please.""

 zhukovregional.14.t: "A Night-Time Embarrassment"
 zhukovregional.14.d: ""Wonton soup." The voice was so cold it could have flash-frozen the Volga. "You asked the ambassador of our benefactor, the United States of America, to be taken to eat - wonton soup. Wonton. Soup." Silence resumed.\n\n"I, ah, I can explain." Yakovlev took a deep breath. "We had to find a place where it would be conducive to raise the sensitive topics you have mentioned. Foreign aid and soldiers, in a pricey establishment? No, that would be passé." Yes, this defense was going well. He pressed on.\n\n"So I asked for something so extraordinary its location would bypass the ears of any potential surveillance. And who would think of eating wonton soup in an American city? A perfect plan, da?" The sibilant background swallowed his words.\n\n"We will - mention - this at a later stage, Alexander. For now, what news of our requests?"\n\nThe Russian slumped towards the wall, sighing. "The Americans have promised future discussion at a reasonable date. If I know the Ambassador like I think I do, that means we're on our own. I'm sorry, comrade."\n\nThe temperature between Yakovlev's ear and the phone dropped a thousand degrees. "Your apology is registered, Comrade Yakovlev." Another interlude. "It is not, however, accepted. See what else the Americans can help us with. And if you fail us - ""
 zhukovregional.14.a: ""Neither of us will be eating wonton for a while.""

 zhukovregional.15.t: "Ryzhkov's Tour"
 zhukovregional.15.d: ""At ease, soldier." The guard relaxed and returned to his position, and Nikolay turned aside to begin rummaging through his suitcase. God, why had the Supreme Soviet insisted on lumping him with armed men on an international tour? Did they have no regard for the unwritten laws of diplomatic protocol?\n\nWell, he supposed fifteen years of isolation was plenty of time to forget the nuances of relations. Not so for Ryzhkov, however: he'd nursed his old dreams too long to erase their outlines from his mind. And while he still drew breath, those dreams of universal brotherhood, of arms interlinked until they crossed the world, would never die.\n\nHe began to fiddle with a postcard, pulling its sides until a letter fell out. Ah, his correspondence with the Premier had arrived! The afternoon meeting with the Revolutionary Secretary of State had drained him a little, but not so much that he couldn't squeeze in a few words to a friend. Perhaps he'd ask about the latest collectivization program's progress - farmers always seemed to get the Foreign Ministers going, for some reason. Perhaps they were simply easier to show off?\n\nRyzhkov shrugged to himself. It wasn't for him to dictate the policies of others. All he knew was what was best for the Union had to be what was best for the world, and he was damned if some farmers and their fields were going to get in the way of that goal. Stooping a little to let the light in, he began to write."
 zhukovregional.15.a: "Dearest Premier, the Russian people send their regards."

 zhukovregional.16.t: "We are Not Afraid"
 zhukovregional.16.d: ""Comrades, we should be aware of our place in history. All of us recall the days of terror, when the haze from Moscow's burning and that of a half-dozen other cities was still pungent and fresh - all of us bear wounds that are unhealed. The Union broken upon a wheel of chaos, and its peoples scattered to the four winds - even now I have family that know not whether I am alive or dead. We all lost irreplaceable ideals, too - I will never take the triumph of Socialism for granted again."\n\n"But it is time, like a widow throwing off the cloak of self-shame, to cast away our fears. The Fascist Wolf hovers over our land still, slavering like a beast in heat, but his chops are no longer what we had feared - it is trapped in a nightmare of its own. We must not be afraid, friends, to call it what it is! It is simply another imperialist experiment like all the rest of the armies who once dared to march into the Rodina, and like all the rest it is doomed to perish."\n\n"Yes, we must not be afraid! Let us take strength, knowing that what we see before us is but the last guttering of an inferno - and in our hands are the buckets that shall extinguish it once and for all."\n\n"For those who would presume to speak for, or answer to, the Fascists, I speak only this. You believed that the world would crumble before you, and for a time you were right. But the Tsar thought he would never perish, either, and Napoleon believed Russia would burn, and the Mongols believed the Rus would never rise against them. They have been wrong every single time."\n\n"And you, too, will be wrong. The old dream of a Red Union, of what we once had, is waiting as the clouds gather - and we will be its harbingers.""
 zhukovregional.16.a: "We will restore all that is lost to us."

 zhukovregional.17.t: "A Message to America"
 zhukovregional.17.d: "- To The Department of State of the United States of America -\n\nDue to perceived diplomatic instability across the world and the decline of socialist unity, the West Russian Revolutionary Front is notifying the United States of its intent to create a ComIntern, or Communist International, to unite the socialist world economically, diplomatically, and politically. It would be in the best interest of the United States and the Organization of Free Nations to bond our two alliances together to stand against our common enemy, Germany. Despite our differences, we must remain united to stand against the fascist menace.\n\nNikolay Ryzhkov of the West Russian Revolutionary Front."
 zhukovregional.17.a: "Courteous."

 zhukovregional.18.t: "A Long-Unfinished Business"
 zhukovregional.18.d: "Zhukov rarely broke his brandy collection out - the bottles were incredibly expensive, and while alcoholism was not a taboo in West Russia, decadent excess very much was. Even so, as he stared at a map of the growing Union, he thought it an excellent time to start. His armies ranged through what had once been their lands, the Politburo reported cautious positivity regarding the integration of the old peoples into the administration, and the economy was booming, too.\n\nFuck it, he whispered to himself. If you couldn't treat yourself at times like these, what good was hidden brandy in the first place?\n\nAs he poured the sweet amber release into his cup, he buzzed the receptionist. "Tell Akhromeyev, Ryzhkov, and Yakovlev to come in. Drinks, as they say, are served." He hoped they'd bring their own damn glasses this time. This stuff was a pain to wash out of even one cup.\n\nAs the men saluted, Zhukov waved them down. Pouring the brandy into their proffered cups, Zhukov raised his cup in a toast. "Gentlemen, the situation has changed. Probably for the better, but with all these complaints about farmers fucking their own farming equipment on my desk, I don't have high hopes."\n\n"You know, Georgy, it might be best if you stuck to doing your actual job. They're hiring thinner comedians these days." The three shared a chuckle; they had always disagreed, but their shared sardonic misery kept them together.\n\n"Well, we can't afford much small talk, even now. I've been thinking about the question of succession, and grooming my future replacement. This liver's seen too much to last through another decade, I reckon." Zhukov looked at each of them in turn - Akhromeyev's earnestness, Yakovlev's charm, Ryzhkov's hidden depths. Each valuable in turn - but there could only be one choice, in the end."
 zhukovregional.18.a: "There is much work to be done."

 zhukovregional.19.t: "Back in Town"
 zhukovregional.19.d: "On the day of his return to his office, Moshin made sure to dress his finest. Memories of sneering mockery echoed through his head as the restored administrator walked into the building, flashing his entrance card like it was studded with Faberge eggs. As military officers shuffled by him, hiding their ranks and names, he could barely resist the slight smile on his face from blossoming into a full-fledged grin.\n\nYes, he whispered, Party Member Moshin was coming back in style.\n\nThere was a table, right next to his office, and on it lay several Party emblems and dossiers attached. Moshin grabbed at a random one - the office goodies were always the best on the first week - and he began to flick through the fresh pages of the dossier like he owned the place. He'd always fantasised about getting a nice, cushy desk job, but the jackasses who thought they ran West Russia with their guns and their stupid army kept getting in the way.\n\nNow, however, this was his town. And he'd gotten a nice promotion in the bargain, too - the Office was his domain, prime and unmolested, and the officers who'd once bullied him were well out of the way! He hoped they'd all have their fingers rot off in the snow.\n\nMoshin plopped himself in the office, engorged himself on the biscuit stash he'd found on the way in, and was half-supine when the security staff came to escort him out. Protesting, Moshin snapped that he was a bureaucrat now, damnit! [WRS.GetLeader] had kicked the army out and men like him in. Who were they to defy authority?\n\nRolling their eyes, the staff asked him to return on Monday. The offices were closed on Sunday, apparently. Murmuring, they retreated, leaving a humiliated Moshin to walk all the way back to his home."
 zhukovregional.19.a: "At least he kept the free pen."

 zhukovregional.20.t: "Akhromeyev's Consultation"
 zhukovregional.20.d: "There is a silence as Akhromeyev approaches the Grand Marshal's office. Staffers seem to flee past him, not looking back, as if some town were being turned to fire and brimstone behind them. Generals avoid his gaze, looking down and away. Akhromeyev sighs. Zhukov is having a bad day today, and when he's in a mood the whole office feels it.\n\nHe enters the room, knowing Zhukov to be brooding as usual, and takes a gander at the strategic map. As it turns out, today's shitshow is at least decipherable: the military are complaining about border guard concentrations again. There simply isn't enough time or energy to deal with every hostile nation that now borders the rebirthed Union, nor is the road system refined enough to deal with mass transports.\n\nZhukov is, for all intents and purposes, struggling with a problem with no solution.\n\nAkhromeyev closes his eyes for five minutes, spinning the numbers through his head. Then he rises. "I have a solution, Marshal Zhukov." Letting the lines spill into the air is easy: just have the garrison focus on chokepoints in so-and-so configuration, move logistics just far enough behind lines to keep them defensible, adjust troop concentrations across the direct front to favour a line-of-fire maximization -\n\nZhukov widens his eyes. The problem undoes itself like a schoolboy's shoelaces. It's brilliant, really. Rising, he bear-hugs the confused General, who pats Zhukov on the back in return. Zhukov chuckles, says, "I know I hired the right understudy," and leaves the office. Akhromeyev sighs again. Helping the Marshal is easy - but tidying up after him is not."
 zhukovregional.20.a: "Truly an effective mentee."

 zhukovregional.21.t: "A New Normal"
 zhukovregional.21.d: "Olga nodded impatiently at her parents. "Yes, yes, Mother, I understand. Now please, my friends are expecting me at 5." She couldn't really blame them - they were all such oldies they still feared for her safety, and the laws had only recently been changed - but she was impatient all the same, as all young people inevitably are.\n\nShe felt like something - new - was happening in her little village, all of them felt it. Like some irresistible tide flowing in from the deep north, there was no moment when she could have said the Revolution arrived, only a growing sense that it was, in some sense, already here. Restrictions were lifted on work, schooling, and now this. It was long overdue a celebration, and why not celebrate with the friends she'd made by hiding her secret life?\n\nFor all women had learned long years of secret life, in the spaces where they were barred. One could hide it well, or not at all, but one could never deny oneself.\n\nShe arrived, and found that Michal had already set up the booth: In a mockery of the higher education they were barred from, the girls had set up little badges, almost akin to the University of Syktyvkar. That was the only luxury afforded it - the rest of the table was crowded with one thing.\n\nBooks. Books on science, on literature, a couple of religious works they'd scrounged up when the local Church fell on hard times. There her friends were, in quiet celebration, focused in the quiet, revolutionary act of reading - Olga took a hardcover (a detective novel, boilerplate) and joined them."
 zhukovregional.21.a: "A different kind of party."

 zhukovregional.22.t: "A Rallying Cry for the Socialist Brother"
 zhukovregional.22.d: "We have marched ACROSS the breadth of Russia, from Arkhangelsk to Yaroslavl. We have broken the back of EVERY ARMY that ever dared to CHALLENGE us. The Revolution is our heartbeat, and with its every pulse we grow STRONGER. We shall stop at NOTHING to realize the Socialist Paradise!\n\nBut this alone is insufficient. For while the Banners of Red October fly above our HOMELAND, in the working-place and the family home it is as if the TSAR never left. Yes, Comrades - just as we were unrelenting towards the fascism that poisoned Russia's SOIL, so too must we be unrelentingly vigilant towards the HOMETOWN FASCISM of Gender Inequality!\n\nConsider, Comrades, a list of restrictions that we have removed in the LIBERATED AREAS under our control:\n\n1) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to PUBLIC OFFICE.\n2) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to vote in REVOLUTIONARY ELECTIONS.\n3) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to COMPULSORY PRIMARY EDUCATION.\n4) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to EQUAL WORKPLACE REPRESENTATION.\n5) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to JOIN UNION ACTIVITIES.\n6) The Socialist Woman now holds the right to DOMESTIC LITIGATION.\n\nComrades, it is clear that the LIBERATION of the Soviet Woman is at hand! The Capitalist Marauder limps to his cave, but he is not quite done OPPRESSING the women he FEARS - let us prepare to mount RESISTANCE to his evil acts wherever we can!"
 zhukovregional.22.a: "Signed, the Gender Revolutionary Working Group."

 zhukovregional.23.t: "Old Enemies, New Friends"
 zhukovregional.23.d: "The new arrival was shown to his desk by an assistant, who smiled and asked him if he needed anything else before leaving him at his new post. He was pleasantly surprised that his new office space was bigger than the one he had worked in before, when he was an archivist in the Tsarist administration at Vyatka. He had somehow always expected that the Front was stingy with that kind of thing, and that he would be somehow working in a barn with 10 other men.\n\nHe was surprised he had gotten the job at all. When the Red Army had taken the city, he had been sure that he and all the other bureaucrats would be executed along with the high up Tsarist officials, but it was not to be. Instead they had offered him a job, letting him work as an archivist for the Red Army Central Statistical Directorate. Either they desperately needed competent bureaucrats, or the Front really did rule with a very light hand. Either way, he was happy to have work. Better than being at the bottom of a ditch like the Tsar and his generals."
 zhukovregional.23.a: "All have a place in the new Russia!"

 zhukovregional.24.t: "The Trial"
 zhukovregional.24.d: "The man was dragged before the court, his hands chained behind his back. A military judge was presiding, a Major General in a fine Red Army officers uniform. There were very few people there to bear witness, only a few soldiers and a clerk. Only the warlords themselves were given an audience for their trials. The one's for their apparatchiks were considerably smaller affairs.\n\nThe judge read out the charges and then the sentence: The man was found guilty by the court of treason against the Soviet Union and her people, as well as complicitly in murder, banditry, theft, as well as a dozen other crimes, all perpetrated while in the service of the Tsarist reactionary Nazi-collaborator regime of the warlord state of Vyatka. Finding no mitigating circumstances for his actions, the judge sentenced the man to death, his execution to be carried out by firing squad at the soonest possible convenience. As he was dragged out to his death, his eyes wide with fear, the man began to shout:"
 zhukovregional.24.a: "Please, I was only an archivist!"

 zhukovregional.25.t: "Back on the Air"
 zhukovregional.25.d: ""Greetings, Comrades, and welcome back to Radio Free Syktyvkar! After a long hiatus indeed, we are back on the air and ready to bring you the quality reporting you have come to expect from this station. My name is Maxim, and I am joined by my good partner and comrade Anatoliy!"\n\n"Indeed, it is good to be here with you, Comrade Maxim. Now, for those of you at home, you may be wondering what happened to the old hosts. Unfortunately, this station could only continue to exist thanks to the wonderful sponsorship of the Communist Party, and thus there were some... disagreements with how the station should be run. Rest assured, however, we remain just as committed to bringing you all the latest news from around Russia!"\n\n"Yes, yes! A warm round of thanks to Communist Party for their patronage! It is contributions like that which enable independent media like this to thrive."\n\n"Now that we've settled that, let's move towards the topics of today. First, we shall discuss the most common ways that Reactionaries try to manipulate people and how to spot it for yourself. Then, we've got a tell-all interview with Comrade Zhukov himself that you won't want to miss! All of this and more after the break, so stay tuned!""
 zhukovregional.25.a: "Something seems off with this station..."

 zhukovregional.26.t: "The Revolution on the Radio"
 zhukovregional.26.d: ""Good evening, comrades of the Red Army, and welcome back to the Voice of the Revolution; the patriotic soldier's premier source for the happenings of the day on the radio waves! Without further ado, let us march into the news of the hour."\n\n"Our beloved Grand Marshal, Comrade Zhukov, was met by cheering crowds in Rykov today as he once again reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to the Socialist revolution in a speech. The People's Marshal went on to declare that 'all must do their part for the eventual reunification of the union'. Truly the greatest statesman of his time!"\n\n"Meanwhile, reports indicate that morale has never been higher in the Red Army, and the recruitment offices can barely contain the flood of brave young souls willing to give their lives for the revolution. Goodness, comrades! I know you are eager to get into the fight, but try to do so in an orderly fashion?"\n\n"Now, let us play some patriotic songs from the newly-reestablished Red Army Orchestra. This piece is one that should be rather familiar to most of you, or at least, I would hope it is! Here is the Partisan's Song, in all its glory!""
 zhukovregional.26.a: "Through valleys and over hills..."

 zhukovregional.27.t: "The New Soviet Constitution"
 zhukovregional.27.d: "Zhukov read the new constitution, being careful to make sure all was in order. Once it was signed, it could never be undone. The Front would be changed forever.\n\nOf course, the constitution would not go into effect until the Front was disbanded, and that wouldn't happen until Russia was united and Leningrad and Moscow were back in the Soviet Republic.\n\nStill, the constitution being signed off now would mean stability later. Liberalizing the union, it should make everyone happy. Limited privatization had even been argued into the constitution! Zhukov had no idea how that got past the old guard. Many were looking forward to seeing a democratic system in Russia, albeit limited, as it would only serve as controlled opposition.\n\nZhukov raised his pen and signed, hoping it wouldn't be for nothing."
 zhukovregional.27.a: "Can we even hope to see this constitution in effect?"

 zhukovregional.28.t: "A Constitution for the Future"
 zhukovregional.28.d: "The new constitution laid on Zhukov's desk as he made sure his pen had ink. This new constitution would cement democracy in Russia once the Front was disbanded, a worthy endeavor.\n\nUntil the Front was disbanded, however, current ways would be maintained. Democracy was too dangerous to be implemented until all of Russia was under the control of the Revolutionary Front. Once all of Russia was reunited, including Moscow and Leningrad, a future was set up of a socialist soviet democracy.\n\nA much less authoritarian union was sure to calm Russia once everything was dealt with. A military government was not necessary to rule eternally. Hopefully, until the constitution takes effect, people will remain satisfied with what has been done so far.\n\nZhukov laid his pen down on the paper and signed, hoping one day he would see it in action."
 zhukovregional.28.a: "A dream worth living for."

 zhukovregional.29.t: "Status-Quo Constitution"
 zhukovregional.29.d: "Zhukov held the constitution in his hands, reading the words carefully, making sure there were no mistakes. The constitution would cement communist rule in the Front and would ensure the Front would remain largely the same after Russia was reunified.\n\nIt would go into effect almost immediately, but that still meant little would change. It basically kept things as they were, and there was nothing wrong with that. What could you change with a system that needs no revision?\n\nStill, the new constitution would officialize everything, and did put many necessary rules in place for the government. Authoritarian powers would stay with Zhukov and the government, that's just how things had to be. It would keep things stable and politically powerful. People could not just govern themselves.\n\nWith one stroke of his pen, the constitution was signed off and ready to go into effect."
 zhukovregional.29.a: "Little change, but is there anything wrong with that?"

 zhukovregional.30.t: "Reinstating the NEP"
 zhukovregional.30.d: "It is time we go back into the old days of the Soviet Union and Bukharin and reimplement one of the oldest ideas in the book - The New Economic Policy. While maybe going against our roots of total socialism, the same problem was apparent thirty years ago and solved by the New Economic Policy, at least somewhat.\n\nImplementing a system of limited free markets still under state control will be necessary if we want to build up the economy of West Russia. Ending the nationalization of industry, while possibly hurting our productivity in the short term, will see us have long term positive impacts and possibly even larger growth.\n\nIt appears a mixed economy is the way forwards now, and while we will continue to control what is necessary, private control will get a few things off our hands that we have no need to control."
 zhukovregional.30.a: "A necessary sacrifice."

 zhukovregional.31.t: "A Small Shock"
 zhukovregional.31.d: "With the policy of war communism lifted, an economic shock has been felt across West Russia. The transition of a mobilized war economy to a civilian one has noticeably impacted our economy.\n\nWe may want to be more careful with our economic policy in the coming days, as anything could cause our economy to crash. Still, the economic shock currently felt has been small, but our economy remains unstable.\n\nMany are happy with the new change, however. The quick change means improvements for our civilians producing goods that could not have come faster any other way, and civilians can now keep more of what they produce. If our economy can stay stable within the next few days, it is expected that this will only show up as a small bump in our economy."
 zhukovregional.31.a: "A radical change, certainly."

 zhukovregional.32.t: "Little Things"
 zhukovregional.32.d: "Prav has been noticing things. Little things, but still major in his eyes. Food in the markets was less expensive. His taxes had decreased. Most important of all, however, was that he actually got to keep some of his produce. His beets, cabbages, and tomatoes used to all be bought by the government, leaving his family with little to eat for themselves. They had nearly starved the past few years if not for the few reforms the front had enacted.\n\nBut now, for the first time in years, Prav kept some of his food. While it wasn't much, and the government still bought much of what he produced, the little he got meant everything to Prav and would help him and his family get through the winter.\n\nThings seemed to get better by the day, and Prav hoped he would continue to keep more and more of his food. Maybe he would even be able to sell some of it himself! At least, Prav hoped, he would continue to be paid enough for the produce he gave to the government. He had a feeling he would, however."
 zhukovregional.32.a: "It's good to know we're doing something right."

 zhukovregional.33.t: "An Unfortunate Confiscation"
 zhukovregional.33.d: ""You can't do this to me, to my family!" Said Karei, pleading with the government official. "I have seven mouths to feed, and there's barely enough food to buy in the markets, can't I keep more?"\n\n"I'm sorry sir, but you're only limited to five bushels of wheat and ten stalks of corn," said the official, looking bored and absolutely hating his job.\n\n"Just that to feed my entire family for the winter! It's impossible! I thought Zhukov promised we would get to keep more of our food, but you're just taking it away again!" Karei was on the floor now, they had promised they wouldn't take as much this year! But now they were back, asking for it all once again.\n\nThe official cleared his throat, growing more and more impatient. "I'm sorry sir, but more food is needed for the front. The Red Army must be fed. You'll survive. Besides, this year requires an even less extreme amount than last time, so you should be happy."\n\n"Our family barely lived through last year, and this winter is supposed to be even worse! You can't agree with this, at least let us keep enough to get through the winter." Karei hoped the man would understand, he would have a family too, wouldn't he?\n\nThe Official got quiet for a moment, and then said, "again, I'm sorry, but this is necessary. It's not in my power to stop it. I have my own family to feed." And just like that, the official walked out the door and into his truck, carrying most of Karei's produce away."
 zhukovregional.33.a: "Be happy with what you can keep!"

 zhukovregional.34.t: "Things Are Looking Up"
 zhukovregional.34.d: "People have begun to notice things looking up in West Russia. Economically, we are better off than we have ever been before and poverty has been at its lowest since Russia was last united. No longer do people have to fear if they are going to survive each day. Now, more food is being produced and new factories are creating more jobs than ever before.\n\nNew industries are also producing more goods for people to buy, increasing the quality of life all around West Russia. An agrarian lifestyle is slowly becoming an industrial one, and our economy is seeing the benefits.\n\nIt is good the people are happy, and more are seeing the advantages of communism. It is apparent Zhukov has more popularity than ever! The Marshal's government seems to be stable, and that stability is bound to continue.\n\nYet still there is much to be done to improve the economy and prepare it for reunification. There are many options ahead of us, it is up to us to choose the best one and continue the growth."
 zhukovregional.34.a: "Good to hear!"


 #Tukhachevsky Superregional Events

 tukhasuperregional.1.t: "Changing of the Guard"
 tukhasuperregional.1.d: "Tukhachevsky was looking his best, his uniform crisp and clean, his medals polished and resplendent across his chest. The other generals of the Stavka flanked him to either side, dressed with similar pomp and grandeur. For a moment he felt transported to a time before the Great Patriotic War, to the bright vaults of Moscow where he spent many a night drinking and playing his violin with dear Shostakovich. A time of laughter, music, and light.\n\nBreaking out of his haze of memory, the Grand Marshal gave the signal to begin the ceremony. The band to the left began to blare the Song of the Soviet Army, while to the right two young officers began to lower the banner of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. The golden star under which he had fought for more than two decades, under which hundreds of thousands had fought and bled and died for a free Russia, fluttered in the wind and then dropped into the hands of the two men below. They folded it respectfully, and then unfurled the banner of the new Russia.\n\nThe ceremony was merely symbolic, a statement on how far Tukhachevsky's Red Army had come in its struggle to unite their broken country. The Grand Marshal would still be the commander-in-chief and de facto head of state, and the Stavka would continue to rule alongside him. Yet in that moment he knew there was still significance imbued in this event. It would signal to everyone at home and abroad that the time of petty squabbling, of warlordism, of Russian against Russian, had come to a close.\n\nThe flag of the restored Union of Soviet Socialist Republics raised triumphantly before the crowd. Between the hammer and the sickle, representing the unity of peasants and workers, rested the sword. The symbolism was lost on no one. The Red Army would be at the heart of the new Soviet Union, and it would be armed and ready for the sacred war to come. As it reached its apex, flying high above the heads of all assembled, Tukhachevsky knew that finally, the tide had turned."
 tukhasuperregional.1.a: "Onwards, to Moscow!"

 tukhasuperregional.2.t: "The New Recruits"
 tukhasuperregional.2.d: "Private Lyadov stood at attention as Colonel Savinkov paced before the men. Tall, burly, his weathered face covered in old scars, Savinkov was a dour, menacing figure. Lyadov, like all the other's, had spent the morning drilling. Drilling in the morning, drilling in the afternoon, drilling at night.\n\nLyadov had just about had enough, as had many of the other men. They were all seasoned soldiers who had seen their fair share of combat in West Siberia, yet Tukhachevsky's officers treated them as if they were fresh recruits, subjected to endless drilling and the droning of political commissars.\n\n"Not good enough," Savinkov began, as he always did, his voice calm and even. "You are lethargic, dull, undisciplined. You will run the drill again."\n\nLyadov grew angry. They had run the drill countless times already, each time the exact same as the last. Savnikov expected the impossible. Lyadov grit his teeth and stepped forward.\n\n"Comrade Colonel Savinkov," he said, facing forward. "Permission to speak?"\n\nSavnikov looked at him as one would look at a worm, paused, and waved for him to speak.\n\n"Respectfully Comrade Colonel Savinkov, why must we run this drill so many times? We are all veteran soldiers, and know the drill."\n\nA look of unbridled rage enveloped Savinkov's face as he began to speak, his words tumbling out in a rare display of emotion.\n\n"You have no idea what you are up against, do you? This is not a ragtag army of bandits fighting for this warlord or that warlord, killing each other over tiny scraps of useless Siberian dirt! This is the Red Army! The last true hope for mankind! And our enemy to the west is the German war machine. The most destructive army in human history, lying in wait to finish us off once and for all. If you are not prepared, and falter, even for a second, they will kill you, your families, your friends, and Russia herself, dooming mankind to an eternity of darkness! So private, when I tell you to fucking run the drill again,""
 tukhasuperregional.2.a: ""YOU WILL RUN THE DRILL AGAIN!""

 tukhasuperregional.3.t: "The Arsenal of Communism"
 tukhasuperregional.3.d: ""What is the meaning of this?" the foreman bellowed, rushing down the stairs from his office to the factory floor below. A man in a Red Army officer's uniform stood just at the landing, his way blocked by some of the plant workers. He was flanked to either side by soldiers, their rifles as yet undrawn. As Viktor approached, the man looked up to him, and smiled in greeting.\n\n"Finally," he exclaimed, raising his voice above the cacophony. "Are you the owner of this factory?"\n\n"No," Viktor responded apprehensively. "I am the foreman. The factory is owned by Mr. Alexander Vtorov. He is not here right now."\n\n"Oh well, it is no matter," the officer replied, frowning slightly. "I am here on behalf of Marshal Ustinov and the State Committee for Defence Technology. May we talk in your office?"\n\nThe foreman scanned the soldiers. They looked like they were ready to crack skulls if ordered. He waved for the workers to part. Ordering his men to stay below, the officer followed the foreman up. The two sat across from each other in the office above.\n\n"Ah, that is much better," the officer began, relieved to be off the noisy factory floor. He reached into his jacket and extracted a letter, passing it to the foreman.\n\n"In that envelope you will find orders for the nationalisation of this plant and its immediate conversion into an armaments factory under the direction of Marshal Ustinov, and the Minister for Defence Industry. Now usually the state would send a new foreman to oversee this transition, but due to a shortage of skilled managers, you will retain your position. I will remain here to make sure everything goes smoothly. As you can see the envelope also contains specifications for a modernised Kalashnikov Automatic Rifle variant with a 5.56x39 cartridge and -"\n\n"Guns?" the foreman asked, deeply confused.\n\n"Yes," the officer responded, smiling. "It's all in the envelope."\n\n"But, for god's sake, this is a shovel factory!""
 tukhasuperregional.3.a: ""Yes, and now it's a rifle factory.""

 tukhasuperregional.4.t: "The Bakaly Massacre"
 tukhasuperregional.4.d: "Captain Gusarov and his unit nestled themselves halfway up a mountain looking down at the town of Bakaly, the treeline obscuring them from the people below. The partisans had been sloppy, allowing him to track them through the forest back to here. Using binoculars, he saw dozens, maybe hundreds of them walk about, guns slung about their backs, talking and interacting with the townsfolk. They evidently felt safe here, safe enough to walk about the streets without fear of reprisal. The townsfolk were almost certainly supporting them.\n\nHe turned to his unit's radio operator, Private Meledin, a young man barely out of school, and ordered for him to report that the town of Bakaly was in the hands of the partisans and that his unit would be doubling back to base. Meledin followed his orders, quietly speaking into the radio. A voice from command radioed back softly into his earset. Just as Gusarov was about to order his men to prepare to leave, Meledin turned to him, a look of confusion across his face.\n\n"Captain," he said, placing his hand over his microphone so command could not hear. "They are asking me if we are downwind of Bakaly. Why would they be asking that?"\n\nSheer terror gripped Gusarov. What had he done? Without even waiting to give his men an explanation, he ordered them to pack up and move. He marched them hard and fast further up the mountain, as high as they could go. As he had expected, the plane arrived in less than an hour, flying fast over Bakaly. As Gusarov and his unit turned to watch it, it dropped a single payload directly on top of the town before turning up and away. It was only a few short moments before the deathly white smoke began to rise, along with the screams.\n\nThe next day, once the poison gas had cleared, Gusarov took the unit down to Bakaly. The bodies were everywhere, some caught trying to flee the town on foot, others waiting to die in their homes, all clawing for air as they died. As they reached the centre of the town, they came across the Bakaly schoolyard. Before anybody could stop him, Private Meledin took out his pistol, put it to his temple, and pulled the trigger."
 tukhasuperregional.4.a: "A shame, he was a fine radio operator."

 tukhasuperregional.5.t: "An Audience with the Grand Marshal"
 tukhasuperregional.5.d: "Marshal Dmitry Ustinov steeled himself as he entered the Grand Marshal's office. He and Tukhachevsky were on good terms, but the commander-in-chief was an abrasive, unforgiving man. He could very well have been summoned to be reprimanded for some mistake, or worse.\n\nYet when he entered he found Tukhachevsky sitting in a chair, out of uniform, stoking embers in his fireplace. The sweeping melodies of a symphony, unfamiliar to Ustinov's ears, reverberated throughout the room. Ustinov saluted, but the Grand Marshal merely turned, smiled, and gestured for him to sit.\n\n"Comrade Ustinov, thank you for coming," he said as the General sat across from him by the fireplace. "I have something of great importance to discuss. Tell me, Ustinov, what do you know of Alexander the Great?"\n\nUstinov was confused, but answered without hesitation.\n\n"I know that Alexander was a great general who forged an empire that spanned from Greece to India, Grand Marshal."\n\n"Do you know what happened to that Empire when he died?" Tukhachevsky responded, looking at the General intently. Ustinov shook his head. "It fell apart, torn to pieces by his generals as they squabled over his corpse. Within a few years of Alexander's death, everything he built had turned to dust. I do not intend to make the same mistake, dear Ustinov. That is why I plan to declare an heir well in advance of my death."\n\nThe realisation of what he was getting at hit Ustinov like a brick wall. He intended to name him heir! He continued to listen, too shocked to speak.\n\n"You will be that heir Ustinov. I know I have perhaps not communicated my respect for you as well as I could have, but I consider you an excellent general and a loyal comrade. You will make a fine Grand Marshal."\n\n"I do not know what to say, Grand Marshal," Ustinov responded, stumbling over his words as a thousand thoughts rushed through his head. "I am deeply honoured and moved."\n\nTukhachevsky laughed. "Do not worry dear Ustinov, I am not dead yet! There is still much to do.""
 tukhasuperregional.5.a: "Long May He Live!"

 tukhasuperregional.6.t: "A Sacred War"
 tukhasuperregional.6.d: "Dmitry Ustinov hastily approached the door to Grand Marshal Tukhachevsky's office, where two imposing guards silently kept watch as usual. The Grand Marshal had not been seen all day yesterday, and Ustinov grew rather concerned when he did not show up for the usual briefing this morning as well. One of the guards gave Ustinov a quick salute as he came closer. "Hail, Comrade Marshal Ustinov!"\n\nWith a slightly less enthusiastic gesture of his hand, Ustinov put the guard at ease. "Yes, hail. Where is Comrade Tukhachevsky? I haven't seen him for over twenty four hours and I'm starting to get worried!"\n\n"Do not fear, Comrade Ustinov, the Grand Marshal is currently in his office. He asked that nobody disturb him until he is finished with his work."\n\n"Is that you, Comrade Ustinov? Let him in!" A muffled, raspy voice could be heard from behind the door. The guards did as the voice commanded, and opened the door to reveal a disheveled and clearly sleep-deprived Tukhachevsky. His office looked as though a tornado had swept through it, with notes and colored maps strewn haphazardly about.\n\nUstinov cautiously stepped inside, examining the chaotic scene. "Mikhail Nikolayevich, what's the meaning of all this? You look half dead!"\n\n"This, Comrade Ustinov," Tukhachevsky began, rolling out one of the maps on his desk, "is Operation Homecoming: my magnum opus. With this strategy, we will brush the fascist hordes aside beneath an unassailable deluge of steel." Ustinov stepped forward and looked more closely at the map. It was a large, precise depiction of Eastern Europe, with all sorts of lines and arrows drawn across it. "Everything we have done has led up to this, Ustinov: our sacred war.""
 tukhasuperregional.6.a: "There will be a reckoning."
 WRS_tukhachevsky_epilogue_tt: "§RLong live the Grand Marshal!§!"

 tukhasuperregional.7.t: "Survivors"
 tukhasuperregional.7.d: "The clock ticked gently in the smoke-filled room as the two officers of the Red Army shared a bottle of vodka between them. It wasn't of any particular vintage, nor was it much good in the way of taste, but it was alcohol, and it served the two men fine. Yan spoke first, grimacing slightly as he swallowed the syrupy and oily booze.\n\n"Will we ever recover? From what the Germans did to us, I mean." There was silence once again as Iona considered this, a cigarette dangling from between his fingers.\n\n"You mean the Front? Of course we will, West Russia is already-"\n\n"No, not the Front," Yan cut his friend off quickly, "I mean as Russians. As Jews."\n\n"Ah," said Iona. "Perhaps not. Please, keep this between us, but sometimes I get to thinking." He took a long drag from his cigarette, "Kovner, the Black League, sometimes I think they might have the right of it."\n\nYan raised a curious eyebrow, "that sounds something like treason, Iona. I think the same, in my darkest nights, but it's best if we keep such thoughts in our own heads." They sat in silence, digesting the words. Yan knocked back another drink before fixing Iona with a dark look. "We are not Kovner, we are not Yazov. But Iona, we, the Russians, the Jews, will have our blood debt paid." The clock ticked on, and no one said another word."
 tukhasuperregional.7.a: "An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth."

 #Zhukovoid superregional events god fucking help me
 zhukovsuperregional.1.t: "Front No More"
 zhukovsuperregional.1.d: "As the Grand Marshal sat down at his desk, he pondered his thoughts. The Front had succeeded in their goal of reuniting the west. However much more work was to be done for the reconquering of the east, and soon after was the strike against the Germans. Before that much had to be done however, and currently the one thing that was on Georgy Zhukov's mind was to make this an official statement.\n\nAll the Grand Marshal needed to do was to garner approval from his cabinet and then, officially change the name from the West Russian Revolutionary Front to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Once he would finally do this, the time would be realized, the Front had officially became a country once again instead of a simple rump state that had been teetering on the edge of death. However, the Front was well and alive, focusing on its next prey for the time being until the Continuation of the Great Patriotic War. Until then, only time would tell until what the Union would do.\n\nZhukov smiled as he finished writing his plans for his meeting with the Presidium later. Hoping they would accept his proposal. However until then, he had much more to do. Due to the Union encompassing the western half of Russia, they had to deal with many more problems. Whether it's grain stocks rising or the issue of funding for each military branch, Zhukov was confident that these issues would sort themselves out after a bit of nudging from the government or even himself. The military, while important, seemed like it could be quite the large issue."
 zhukovsuperregional.1.a: "For the Union!"

 zhukovsuperregional.2.t: "The Speech of the Century"
 zhukovsuperregional.2.d: "Zhukov stood above the crowd, looking down. He was amazed at the amount of people that had shown up for a simple, patriotic speech that he was only planning to inspire a small population of the people of the Union. However, as he saw very clearly, more people than expected had shown up. Zhukov was pacing the room in his mind as he waved to the crowd. He then spoke to the thousands of people gathered there to listen to their leader. "Today, we stand on guard. Our enemies tremble in their steps as they have seen our rise to power. We have successfully unified the West, now however, we must look towards the east. Our power is increasing, we will unify Russia for our children. Most importantly however, will be our ongoing fight against the dogs in Moscow. Our home has been taken away from us for too long. We will return."\n\nAfter Zhukov finished, the crowd erupted in cheers. Soviet flags had been waved back and forth. He smiled and waved one last time before heading back inside. As he walked back into the Presidium building, he hoped that the Union would truly live up to the standards he had talked about in his speech. However, as he thought, it would take lots of time to see if these aspirations had become true."
 zhukovsuperregional.2.a: "Onwards, to Moscow!"

 zhukovsuperregional.3.t: "Reflections"
 zhukovsuperregional.3.d: "Grand Marshal Georgy Zhukov stood in his private study with a glass of vodka in his hands. In front of him was a large window that overviewed Arkhangelsk and the surrounding region. As he looked out, he noticed how much the city had grown since the days of the Great Patriotic War and the inevitable loss to the Germans. The USSR had broken down in the days following, with the anarchy spreading across the country. Warlords soon took the place of a government, many of them not harboring the ideals of the Union. However, in these chaotic days, Zhukov tried to stay positive, he and his armies had survived and fled to the safety of the northern regions. Hoping to one day reform and march into Moscow to free it from the dark hand of the Reich.\n\nZhukov looked through the many books he had, ones on warfare and literature. Both classic and contemporary. The study was decorated not as lavishly as some of the citizens of the Union would have thought. However it did have some of Zhukov's favorite hobbies. A fish tank was located in the room, inside was a few of the discus fish. As Zhukov flipped the cover of the last book he had, he walked back over to his desk, where he thought about the last conflict he fought against the Germans.\n\nLess than twenty years after they had been sent trudging back from Stalingrad and Moscow, the reformed Red Army had begun an attack on Moscow, hoping to free the people who had lived under the iron fist. They had made good progress at first. Zhukov had astonishingly come close to liberating the Reichskommissariat. However, the tide soon turned, and they had been pushed back. Since that day when they had been pushed back, Zhukov had still believed that they would finally win."
 zhukovsuperregional.3.a: "Our time has come."

 zhukovsuperregional.4.t: "Homecoming"
 zhukovsuperregional.4.d: "Jonathan Avery looked out his window of the dacha he had lived in for the past decade and a half or so. He rubbed his eyes, hoping that he wouldn't fall asleep. The CIA officer had been stuck in Russia after the West Russian War had come to a screeching halt. While he had some contact with Langley sometimes, these moments had been rare. Jonathan always had something to do however, whether it was training Russian soldiers or tending to his small garden outside.\n\nWhen the car pulled up to his house, he was surprised. Why would the government want to meet with him again. Out stepped members of the Union intelligence service. As they knocked on his door, Jonathan opened it. They said they wanted to talk, Jonathan's stomach dropped as they came in. While his Russian wasn't perfect, it was much better than some of the other agents he had been sent with. As the two men explained to Jonathan the current state of affairs in the Union, his eyes grew when he heard that the United States had recognized him. As they continued, they said to him that he would be brought to Arkhangelsk, where he would be loaded onto a plane and flown home to the states. He smiled and tears began to well up in his eyes, he would finally be going home. The two intelligence officers shook his hands and told him to back his bags, as they had come to pick him up. Jonathan rushed around the house, pulling everything he had in Russia into the duffel bag he had brought with him long ago.\n\nAs they had driven to the airport, he looked out the window. He had begun to see many exports of American culture enter the Union. From people carrying little bottles of Coca-Cola to even a few Fords on the road. As he got to the airport, he shook the hands of the intelligence officers one again. Jonathan boarded the plane, not before turning around and taking one good look at Russia before leaving for good."
 zhukovsuperregional.4.a: "So long, and thanks for all the help!"

 zhukovsuperregional.5.t: "New Masters"
 zhukovsuperregional.5.d: "Dmitri walked down the street, he had arrived back to Russia only a few months ago. He had been thousands of miles away, fighting as a soldier of fortune on the side of the Baathist forces in the Middle East. Being one of the only Russians who was in the Middle East fighting, he had to learn Arabian fast. He wondered when he first came back how easy it was to get a job, but soon after he had arrived, he had been contacted by the government to work as an instructor for the reformed Red Army to prepare them for the possible conquest of the East and the inevitable war against the Germans.\n\nAs he got down to the camp, he opened the door and entered the classroom. Many of the new enlisted recruits had been sitting in the room at the desks. As Dmitri walked in, the recruits shot up instantly and saluted him. While he had been teaching for a few weeks, he hadn't gotten used to the constant drilling of the recruits and their discipline. In Saudi Arabia, he had been used to soldiers that could be hardly even called soldiers, not the men who had assembled before him. He told them to sit back down, and then wrote on the blackboard behind him. Dmitri wrote three words on the board. Advanced Weapon Technique.\n\nLater on the range, they used some of the weapons that had been sent to them from the United States or even from the black markets that stretched across the world. They ranged from new rifles that had been bought, to scrappy-looking, but reliable machine guns that had been smuggled. Dmitri helped most of them learn how to fire and control the weapons. By the end of the day, each recruit had a basic understanding of advanced weapons. Dmitri smiled and began to walk home after finishing the class."
 zhukovsuperregional.5.a: "All in a day's work."

 zhukovsuperregional.6.t: "First Meeting"
 zhukovsuperregional.6.d: "Zhukov said at the long table in the Presidium meeting room. As he awaited his two other deputies to arrive, he looked through his notes. The contents of them had been normal procedures. Items like what to talk about during the meeting, ideas they could bring up and how the meetings would go. He looked down to his watch, waiting for the hand to strike eleven. At this time both Yakovlev and Ryzhkov should arrive for the meeting.\n\nAs he twisted the pen in his fingers, both Yakovlev and Ryzhkov entered the room. Both of the men had an aura of power around them to the aides that had also entered the room. Zhukov's secretary gave him a note saying that all expected members had arrived here. He looked around himself, noticing some of the men beginning to talk to each other and discuss the contents of the meeting. He then began to speak.\n\n"Gentlemen, Comrades, it is an honor to be speaking to all of you in good health. Today marks a great day for us and the Union. I have called you all here to discuss our next chapter in our government. As I'm sure many of you know, the Presidium is reformed." He motions to his left and right, with the members sitting on each side lining the table. "We are meeting to discuss our government and our next course of action. We are on the verge of being very close to fully restoring the glory of our former government. Until then however, we must plan for our glorious restoration and then the Continuation of the Great Patriotic War. Like I said though, we must get to work". Zhukov looked at Yakovlev and Ryzhkov before nodding."
 zhukovsuperregional.6.a: ""Gentlemen, shall we begin?""

 zhukovsuperregional.7.t: "Balance of Power"
 zhukovsuperregional.7.d: "Sergey Akhromeyev read the letter that had been sent to him for the third time. As he was reading it he couldn't believe his eyes. If he was reading the letter correctly, as he assured himself. The Red Army was beginning to be pushed out of the politics of the Union. He threw his hands up in the air in anger and confusion. Why on earth would Zhukov remove the military from politics? Was he a madman craving power? He was a general himself, a very successful one. All of these thoughts raced through Akhromeyev's head as he thought of a response to write to Zhukov and the Presidium.\n\nHe sat down at his desk in his office, one that was quite decorated compared to the likes of Zhukov himself. Akhromeyev grabbed some of the paper he had in his desk and began to write. While he may have not been the best man when it came to words or attempting to write convincing arguments, he was a great general he thought to himself. Before he even had written the second paragraph, he balled up the letter and threw it in the trash can next to his desk. Too bold he thought as he began again.\n\nAfter four different starts, he believed he found the letter he would send to the Presidium. However as he was finishing this letter, he realized that he should send a separate one to Zhukov himself, hopefully convincing him to let the military back into politics. The two men had been acquaintances in the years following the fall of the Union, but had grown apart. Maybe it is possible that he can persuade Zhukov by bringing up their old friendship, he thought. So he began to write another letter, again."
 zhukovsuperregional.7.a: "Now what is the address of the Presidium?"

 zhukovsuperregional.8.t: "Army at the Head"
 zhukovsuperregional.8.d: ""Who the hell is that?!" asked Yakovlev to Ryzhkov. While the two men could be rivals at times when it came to power, they had seemed to be allies today. Yakovlev opened the door to the Presidium meeting room just a smidge to see who was in there. Inside he saw Akhromeyev and some of the other generals in the Union. His eyes widened and he snuck back to Ryzhkov who was standing across the hall, confused.\n\n"Fucking Akhromeyev is here. Something happened to him and Zhukov. There's a few generals as well." He said to Ryzhkov. As he said this, Ryzhkov face palmed and walked to the door, preparing to go inside and have some words with the men. However, he was stopped by Yakovlev who grabbed his arm, pulling him back.\n\n"Nikolay, there is no need to barge into the room and begin to ask questions. If anything, my friend, we should go in with an open mind. Maybe it is possible for us to learn without angering the generals." He said to Ryzhkov, with his hand on his shoulder, hoping to disarm the conflict. However it was to no avail as Ryzhkov brushed Yakovlev's hand off and walked into the room anyways.\n\n"Ah Comrade Ryzhkov and Comrade Yakovlev, so good to see you two had finally made your way to our meeting, only a few minutes late," said Akhromeyev to the two men, as they found their seats.\n\nAs Akhromeyev began to speak, Ryzhkov was deep in thought. He tried to think of an objection but couldn't."
 zhukovsuperregional.8.a: "That fucking rat."

 zhukovsuperregional.9.t: "New Assignments"
 zhukovsuperregional.9.d: "Ryzhkov looked down at the letter he had been sent and slammed it down onto his desk. Water Transportation? For a man of his talents? He was furious. Ryzhkov could not believe his eyes as he read what was happening before him. "After considerable advice" from who, thought Yakovlev. What advice was given to the Presidium on him? Who could be being such a menace that they change committee assignments. Was it the army? Could it have been Zhukov himself. Whatever the answer was, he was furious that it had occurred. Ryzhkov read the letter one more time before balling it up and throwing it into the trash. Someone else's fucking job thought Ryzhkov as he tried to get his mind off of it.\n\nAcross the capital of the Union, Yakovlev had received a similar letter. Instead of Water Transportation it was to the Committee of Coal Transportation. Unlike Ryzhkov however, he was more confused than angered. No conspiracies against him. Did he do something wrong? Did he accidentally anger the wrong person? Whatever it was, it distressed him a bit. Yakovlev had never done anything wrong, all of his work he did was to benefit the Union in any way possible. The letter however, just made him feel disappointed in himself. Whatever could he have possibly done that made the Presidium mad? Whatever it was, he couldn't let his mind wander too much on it. He frowned, feeling upset to himself, he had gotten so far. So close to being an actual politician for something important, and not a rump state located in Russia. Yakovlev went to bed trying to think of something better, hoping that the next day would bring better news."

 zhukovsuperregional.10.t: "Polarizing Posters"
 zhukovsuperregional.10.d: ""So how do you like this one, Grand Marshal?" Asked the artist to Zhukov, showing him a mock-up that he had drawn. An order had come down the lines of the government, asking for a request for new posters that are "patriotic and invoke a sense of willingness". Alek was one of the artists who had answered this call to arms. In the weeks upcoming to the showing, he had created nearly twenty different posters, all with different themes. They ranged from simple images of a unified Russia imposed with the flag of the Union draped over it, to the much more complex art of a soldier blocking a large German soldier from a family.\n\n"I quite like the colors on the art, however, I feel that it is too brash if I am being honest with you, boy. Can I see the next one?" Replied Zhukov. The poster was one with the flag of Reichskommissariat Moscow being melted and then the flag of the Union being formed from the ashes of it. While Alek had liked it when he had been drawing it, he couldn't disagree with the Grand Marshal on this. The colors looked very dark and brooding, compared to some of the other posters he had seen. Alek then pulled out another poster.\n\n"I quite like this one, do you mind explaining it to me?" Said Zhukov to this poster, unlike the others, this one invoked a sense of pride. Zhukov's interest definitely increased. The poster was a vivid one, with a man standing on a hill. Behind him was a ship in the water with its guns raised, tanks on land following him, and planes flying above him. The colors had been ones of reds and blues. The text on the bottom read "Onwards! To the German's doorstep!" Zhukov then smiled."
 zhukovsuperregional.10.a: "We have a winner."

 zhukovsuperregional.11.t: "A Union Made United"
 zhukovsuperregional.11.d: "Zhukov stood upwards, surrounded by his three most important confidants, the original three that stood by him and his clique, all the way back in the early years of his Ukhta administration. Akhromeyev, Ryzhkov, Yakovlev, all stood side by side with each other inside of Zhukov's office, holding cups filled with the best alcohol the union had at its disposal. The occasion demanded something better than cheap, distilled crap.\n\n"Gentlemen," began Zhukov, a smile etched onto his face. "You all know why I brought you here."\n\n"To celebrate?" interjected Yakovlev, a bright smile on his face.\n\n"Correct! Gentlemen, we've done what many considered impossible. We had a mission that even Lenin would have considered too difficult, and we accomplished it. If I were more religious, I might say that it was the will of God!"\n\nThe men laughed at that, especially Akhromeyev.\n\n"We must celebrate our victories tonight, gentlemen. With our enemies defeated, we have begun the long journey towards a better Russia. Drink, friends, for tomorrow, we will have the difficult journey towards rebuilding Russia from the ashes of almost thirty years of war. But first, a toast!"\n\nZhukov lifted his drink upwards. "To Russia!""

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.1.t: "Hit the Ground Running"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.1.desc: "Many of Zhukov's loyal staff thought that the return to Arkhangelsk would be at least a smidge more triumphant. After all, their leader had just taken control of the Front after what was a protracted (and rather messy) struggle. Many of them hadn't had a chance to rest in months, so they'd thought that they would take a break, kick back and just relax.\n\nInstead, here they were, huddled closely together in a dimly lit room. On the table was a well-annotated map of the West Russian region and its various statelets. Zhukov himself was already there before the rest of the staff arrived, and he wasted no time in getting straight to the point.\n\n"Securing the Front took significantly longer than anticipated," he shook his head. "But never mind that: it is in the past. You know why you are here today. I will require all of you to be at your best, because the task ahead of us will be more difficult than just dealing with Tukhachevsky."\n\nThe Grand Marshal rested a finger on the map, circling the entire West Russian region.\n\n"Reclaiming West Russia - that is our first step to taking back our nation. We must prepare immediately. There is little time to waste, and much left to do. So much left to do..."\n\nThe Marshal released a sigh.\n\n"This is my first order. As Grand Marshal, I am authorizing the mobilization of all military-age men for our West Russian operation. There will be more in the future, but this will do. Dismissed! There is work to be done.""
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.1.a: ""Yes, sir, Marshal Zhukov!""

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.2.t: "An Old Soldier's Story"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.2.desc: ""Please welcome to the stage - Comrade Petrov!"\n\nThe old veteran standing uncomfortably hunched over a microphone wasn't exactly someone who could be called dignified, and had to be escorted up hand-in-hand by two much younger soldiers. He wore thick-rimmed sunglasses, and gripped the lectern as tightly as he could. He seemed like he'd be swallowed up by the sheer size by the massive tide of the crowd that filled the large square for the annual Veterans of the West Russian War Memorial Service.\n\n"Comrades. My friends. I am not much of a speechmaker, so I will keep this brief. I am nearly eighty years old, and so people ask me if I had any regrets about serving the nation. Many of my friends died in front of me - many in my arms. I could only sit and watch from my hospital bed as our nation's land was ripped away from us."\n\n"And yet I would change nothing! At the end of the day, win or lose, we can say that we fought until we couldn't fight any more. The tsarists and traitors can claim no such honor."\n\nThe crowd sat up now, listening to the man more closely. Yes, it was shaken, but there was a clear, bright, pride there that no one could take away from it. Like the nation itself, it was broken, but it wasn't defeated.\n\n"Russia lies shattered in a million pieces. I am too old now, and many others my age are already gone. It is up to you - the youth, the future of this beautiful nation - to reclaim Russia; reclaim this Union."\n\nComrade Petrov turned to Zhukov, who sat behind him on the stage. "And I can think of no better man than Grand Marshal Zhukov for the task. Friends. Take back your country!""

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.3.t: "Aid, Cans, and Shelters"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.3.desc: "Anna found it rather difficult to concentrate during the first aid class. To be fair to her, the instructor (an old man with patchy gray hair) spoke softly and mumbled all his words, so she couldn't pick out much of what he was saying. It also didn't help that this was the ninth straight hour of the mandatory civilian emergency training today, and they weren't even halfway done with this particular lesson yet.\n\nAs the instructor explained the fifteen-step process of administering a bandage, her eyes found themselves involuntarily glancing at the rest of the class. She could tell from the way the others moved that they were tired, too - primarily from the noticeable bags under their eyes, their lethargic movements, and the general exhaustion present on their faces.\n\nThe old man was now droning on about something unimportant, so Anna's mind drifted to other pressing matters. She hadn't really had time to think or take stock of everything that happened, and it was then that she realized just how much life had changed in these few short weeks.\n\nBefore she'd never have thought about hoarding, and now she'd gone hungry more than a few nights these past few weeks - just to have as many rations in the basement as she could. She thought about how she'd brought her children to the bomb shelter and prepared them as if an attack was imminent.\n\nAs the instructor lectured on, she just wished that his speech would end: that really, all this turmoil would end sooner rather than later so that a semblance of normality could return. But the storm clouds were present, and she knew - they all did - that it was better to be prepared than not."
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.3.a: ""As I was saying...""

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.4.t: "A Letter to the Russian People"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.4.desc: "Comrades!\n\nI write to you in what we all know are difficult times. We have suffered much since the West Russian War; some of us are even worse off than we were twenty years ago. Undoubtedly, it can be difficult to see hope in the present situation.\n\nYet be assured, my comrades, that hope most certainly endures. Most of you still remember the beautiful days of our proud nation, before it was crudely dismembered by the Fascists and the German tyrant. You remember the times when we still were one people, united - a powerful, strong, and stable Union, before the democrats, tsarists, and collaborators betrayed us, driving their sharp knives straight through our back.\n\nLet me tell you, my friends, that the Union endures. Indeed, it is reborn, risen from the ashes! The Fascists and traitors thought they had destroyed us, but we, the West Russian Revolutionary Front, survived. Their attempts to crush us have failed.\n\nAs such, we appeal to you - indeed, to all Russians, near or far - for your support in retaking the Motherland. We are stronger together, and in the Union there is hope. For it is only when all of us are once again under the Union banner that we can avenge the heinous crimes committed against the Russian people.\n\nWe know that a long struggle lies ahead, but allow me to make you just one promise. I am confident that the sacrifices we make will not be in vain.\n\nGlory to our great people! Glory to the Soviet Union!"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.4.a: "Signed, Grand Marshal Georgy Zhukov."

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.5.t: "Stumbling Towards Home"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.5.desc: "For the Lazarevs, the decision to leave their home was actually rather easy, and it was made easier by the fact that they didn't have to pack much to begin with.\n\nEvery night - over a cold sparse dinner, in their cold sparse room - their father would regale the family with tales of the old Soviet Union. The children and grandparents alike hung onto every word, hearing the stories of the brave soldiers and generals of the Motherland. Maybe some stories here and there were exaggerated (and they all knew that) - but did it matter?\n\nBetween the bombings and the bandits, they needed some hope; some pride to cling to in their poverty.\n\nSo when they heard that the Soviet Union - or at least a remnant of it - had somehow survived, the family was in unanimous agreement. It didn't matter that their neighbors could be lying about the West Russian Revolutionary Front, or that news wasn't always reliable where they lived. It was the USSR: there was no argument to be had! They resolved to leave immediately - no matter the risks.\n\nIt was better than their lives now.\n\nDinner on the night they left was different. Already grandpa was going on about life in the old Union - the freedom, the strength, the pride of it all. The family indulged in dreams - not dreams of wealth, bounty or power - but simple ones, like a safe place to rest their heads. Even father began to wonder what it'd be like there. Yes, he'd admit there wasn't much certainty in the future. For all he knew, life there could be worse."
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.5.a: "But for once in their life there was a ray of hope, and it had to be worth trying."

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.6.t: "The Memory Made Manifest"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.6.desc: "Out in an empty field between two nations there was no sound other than a whistling wind. Young Kliment was early to the meeting. That wasn't his real name, of course - he'd given a fake one to a WRRF agent he was supposed to meet fifteen minutes ago.\n\nThere was no knowing whether or not Agent Andrei was telling the truth, or even if he existed. In fact, many of his fellow comrades had warned him that it was a trap. But this was an opportunity unlike anything else. No longer would they just be sitting at their tables, discussing theory or sulking about the USSR's collapse. They'd actually be making a difference to Russia - making a different Russia, a better one.\n\nA large old truck rolled across the unmarked border, making a loud hissing sigh as it stopped. It certainly wasn't what he had expected. A masked man in a military uniform dropped from the truck, unsettling gravel as he walked towards Kliment. His suspicions were raised, but were abated when he saw the hammer and sickle on the masked man's shoulder.\n\n"Comrade! Good to see you."\n\nThe agent motioned for the young man to come over. With a heave, the back of the truck opened - revealing something that was more than worth the young man's hours-long journey here. It was a crate of weapons. Not exactly a large crate, but more than useful enough for their purposes.\n\n"This is for you and your friends," the man smiled knowingly. "The revolution is coming, Kliment. The Front is counting on you."\n\nThis would be just what they needed. Kliment closed the crate, knowing his time had finally come. The two men raised their fists in the night sky, speaking in one voice as they said:"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.6.a: ""For the revolution!""

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.7.t: "Kick Out the Ladder"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.7.desc: "There he was, the young mayor delivering yet another passionate speech to the baying crowd. Even from here he could hear them, and the noise of the crowd made it difficult for Agent Pyotr to understand anything the mayor was saying - that and the fact that he was hiding on the seventh floor of a derelict apartment block looking at the event through his sniper rifle's scope.\n\nWhat the speech was about didn't matter. The young mayor was clearly a talented orator, his ideas already a problem. Give him and his fledgling movement time and space and their little mustard seed would grow into a gigantic tree. Pyotr had lived long enough not to underestimate seemingly small threats, and he could see one right about one kilometer away from him.\n\nHe felt his hand press around the cold metal of the trigger. The politician was still talking, and Pyotr almost felt sad that this fire would have to be snuffed out. Before his sympathy could become problematic, he pulled the trigger.\n\nInstantly, screaming and yelling. There was no more joy or laughter in the crowd - only the disordered wailing of those who had just lost their greatest hope. Racing down the stairs, he began reciting the reasons that he'd been given by his superiors over in his head: that a leaderless organization was like a headless chicken, and that the chaos from the event would help the Front in their mission.\n\nSeeing the crowd in full tumult validated his decision. This was without question a victory. There was no possibility that they would be able to resist in such disarray. It was unfortunate, but these things needed to be done."
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.7.a: "Chaos can be a disaster - or an opportunity."

 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.8.t: "Turning the Next Page"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.8.desc: ""A successful operation."\n\n"All objectives achieved."\n\n"Total victory."\n\nThe generals just couldn't help themselves, Zhukov thought. He had just received the latest reports from the West Russian frontlines. There they were, the stacks of paper detailing triumph after triumph, stacked high on the table. These reports were brimming with such effusive, almost self-congratulatory language that he'd almost wondered whether the military men needed more discipline.\n\nMany had wondered whether the Front was on its last legs. But if anyone had doubted their military prowess, there was no questioning it now. Yes, the last stragglers were still to be mopped up, but they had done it: they had unified the region once again.\n\nZhukov intended to review these reports more closely later, since the celebrations were about to begin. As he cleared the sheafs of paper from his table, however, he realized what had been left underneath: a map of the old Soviet Union. The Marshal peered closer, looking at it. It was an old, faded, yellowing map, the paper almost falling apart as he reached but even then, he couldn't help but feel nostalgic for the old Union.\n\nIn all the busyness surrounding this recent operation, it was deceptively easy to forget how much there was left to be done; how much they still needed to do before the Union was whole again. For now, he could hear the celebrations outside, and he would join them soon. Zhukov wondered what he would say to them. After some thought, a single line found a refrain in his head:"
 RUS.smuta.WRS.zhukov.8.a: ""Friends, celebrate today! But remember that this is only the beginning.""
