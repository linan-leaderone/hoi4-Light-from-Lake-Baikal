UTL_Veli_Rides_Again: "Veli Kayum Rides Again!"
UTL_Veli_Rides_Again_desc: "Veli Kayum is a man who indulges in pleasure, seeking to enjoy the best life has to offer and happily accepting all the benefits of corruption—from endless money to countless favors, he wants it all. Now, it seems he has realized what he truly desires most in life. Corruption and a life of luxury were mistakes; what he truly wants is to achieve something great, to make them not even dare to think of freedom, even though no one dares oppose him anymore.\n\nFate has given Kayum a chance to experience what it means to live the life of a warrior, and he is very satisfied with what fate has bestowed upon him. Next, he must take on the mission of leading the legion and fulfilling his duties to Turkmenistan."
UTL_Black_Dogs: "Black Dogs"
UTL_Black_Dogs_desc: "The legion has become a pack of dogs, betrayed and stabbed in the back, left to fend for themselves. Their former allies have kicked them to the curb, leaving them with blood foaming at their mouths.\n\nNow, foreign forces are reaching out to the legion, seeking their help to fight for someone else's ideology. What other answer can the legion give besides 'No'? The legion now occupies what some see as a strategic point, the so-called gateway to Central Asia. But the legion doesn't care about that; today's legion wants to bite those who try to bring them under their influence. The legion has made up its mind—starting today, it vows to reject all foreign influences. The legion will never fight for anyone else."
UTL_Veli_Kayum_Khan: "Veli Kayum Khan"
POLITICS_VELI_KAYUM_KHAN_DESC: "As the Soviet Union, which he despised, rose to power, Veli Kayum Khan began to dabble in anti-communism and nationalist ideas. He moved to Germany to study and chose never to return to the Soviet Union. He rose to prominence in the Turkic exile movement due to his pan-Turanist and anti-Soviet rhetoric. When war broke out in Europe, he chose to assist the Nazis, whose ideology had much in common with his own. To achieve his goals, he became one of the founders of the Turkestan Legion—a force composed of Turkestan collaborators and prisoners of war. Although the Nazis considered them to be an 'inferior race,' this attitude quickly changed as the Nazis sought to exploit the anti-Soviet sentiment of Central Asian Turks during Operation Barbarossa. The legion played a secondary role in the rapid conquest of Bukharan Soviet territories.\n\nAs the war ended, the state that had long oppressed Kayum Khan's people collapsed, and Uzbekistan finally had a chance for freedom. The attempt to gain independence ultimately failed, but years later, he was given another chance. With favorable timing and Afghan support, the legion achieved significant results. Kayum advocates for pan-Turanism, with his ultimate goal being the unification of all Central Asian peoples. Of course, the first step in this process is to defeat all those who stand in his way, regardless of who the enemies are.\n\nKayum enforces an iron-fisted rule, but he still faces significant opposition. Many are not loyal to his fascist government, and some even sympathize with Fayzulla. If Kayum wants to become the leader of Turkestan, he must first consolidate his power in this unstable small state. Then, he needs to gain the respect of all Central Asia and earn their trust in his pan-Turkic ideology."
POLITICS_BAYMIRZA_HAYIT_DESC: "Twenty years ago, the most powerful Turkic fighting force in modern history assembled and attacked its enemies. For twenty years, its inept leadership has squandered the blood and lives of brave soldiers.\n\nBaymirza Hayit was born in 1917 in Yargorgan, a small village now located in Uzbekistan. From a young age, Baymirza showed great interest in literature and religious matters, but this was interrupted when war broke out in 1939 and he enlisted after graduating from Tashkent University. For two years, Baymirza Hayit served the Soviet Union, fighting against the Germans until he was captured in 1941. However, it was not the Red Army that would shape the rest of his life, but the Turkestan Legion—a force made up of Turkic POWs in Germany.\n\nAlthough World War II has ended, the Turkestan Legion's mission is not over. Under Veli Kayum's leadership, they returned to their homeland, but incompetence and greed have left the legion in control of only a small portion of the country. Despite the sacrifices made for the collective, the legion's destiny has not yet been fulfilled. Veli Kayum's grand plans have failed, just like his other half-baked schemes. Now it's up to Baymirza to pick up the pieces. The great and glorious Turkic destiny is about to unfold, and the project of unification is now in the hands of someone who is passionate, decisive, and most importantly, capable. The path forward is clear; all that's needed now is the strength to see it through."
POLITICS_SHER_MUHAMMAD_DESC: "Sher Muhammad-Bek Ghazi, with a stern face and sunglasses, exudes grandeur. Few would have imagined that a mercenary could seize control of the Turkestan Legion. However, ever since he escaped from a Russian prison as a child, he has surprised many who underestimated him.\n\nMuhammad-Bek played a key role in the Fergana uprising before joining the guerrilla war against the Soviets. He established an extensive network along the Afghan-Soviet border and sold information to Turkey, Japan, and Germany. This network was later used by the Germans to help restore the former Emir of Bukhara to his throne.\n\nAfter the Nazi victory, Muhammad-Bek embraced the life of a mercenary, earning the nickname 'Blind.' However, he realized that it was not wealth he truly sought, but power. This desire led him to join the Turkestan Legion, where he seized power when the time was right.\n\nNo one is certain whether it was luck, foreign influence, or his own machinations that led to his rise, but it doesn't matter. With the legion under his control, there is little that can stop him from determining Central Asia's fate in the final battle."
