 FUK_not_yet_perished:0 "Not Yet Perished"
 FUK_not_yet_perished_desc:0 "The history of the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army has been one of constant conflict, well-timed cooperation, and a healthy dose of plain luck. Since its inception within the Second Polish Republic as the UNDO, the Galician organization has gone from a political party advocating for greater Ukrainian rights, to an organization feigning collaboration with the long-defunct Galician Military District following the Russo-Ukrainian invasion of Poland, to where it stands today- a besieged partisan organization well entrenched in the western fields of Ukraine.\n\nAs a result of this tumultuous history of the UNRA, few can dispute the tenacity and determination of the democratic dream within Ukraine. May this dream stand forevermore."
 
 FUK_foreign_supply_bases:0 "Foreign Supply Bases"
 FUK_foreign_supply_bases_desc:0 "While the Ukrainian democratic dream is fought for within the fields and streets of west Ukraine, the unique foundations of the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army's organization can be traced back to the Generalgouvernement, where the Galician branch has had little trouble expanding and cementing its position within the populace. As a result, the UNRA has found great difficulty in operating with full clips throughout the Ukrainian Civil War, as its greater supply depots lay in traditionally unreachable land. While this unique set of circumstances does provide a more difficult setting in terms of resupplying our troops, it nonetheless allows our organization as a whole to operate with the advantages of a decentralized force."

 FUK_idea_scraps_of_the_pipeline:0 "Scraps of the Pipeline"
 FUK_idea_scraps_of_the_pipeline_desc:0 "A burst of gunfire. Then silence. In a derelict train station, a soldier sorts through equipment, likely looted from the army's disrupted supply lines.\n\nHis comrades line the civilians against the wall, while the remnants of the smugglers' last stand stain the floor. Someday, after the UNRA captures more land, more resources, they won't have to do this. But for now, this was all the army could get."

 FUK_ukrainian_war_machine:0 "A Ukrainian War Machine"
 FUK_ukrainian_war_machine_desc:0 "Children watch with wide-eyed wonder as dark smoke billows from the chimneys. Gray skies cover the earth but inside the factories, sparks fly like fireflies as workers smelt, hammer, and extract metal from the very chains that had bound them to their labor.\n\nSoon, trucks will arrive, carrying ore from the captured mines. But right now, the first weapons of liberation will wait for no one."

 FUK_collaborator_industrial_connections:0 "Collaborator Industrial Connections"
 FUK_collaborator_industrial_connections_desc:0 "For months, the trucks carried scarce helpings of iron and coal. Now, they come in droves, parading graphite, potash, textile machines, and centrifuges.\n\nSuspicious observers note that it's not easy to get these materials in western Ukraine, and the east's mines are still damaged or being fought over. That said, what does it matter where things come from if the factories can roar to life once more?"

 FUK_everything_for_victory:0 "Everything for Victory"
 FUK_everything_for_victory_desc:0 "Ammonia reactors supplant vodka stills in the distilleries. The metallic tang of gunpowder replaces the scent of bread and cake in the bakeries. And recycled scrap is sorted in the schools, smelted in the churches, and soldered in the libraries.\n\nEach city functions as one big arms factory. Day and night, the gears will never stop turning and the lights will never go out, not until this war is over."

Why, then, we fight as fiercely against the Ukrainian Insurgent Army as we do against the former colonial regime is a question which troubles many within our ranks. The trouble, of course, comes with the simple fact that our two resistance organizations have had more than enough disagreements to put ourselves at odds with one another, not only in terms of ethics but also in terms of policy for the Ukrainian people. While the UNRA would hope for a future without further violence, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army seems intent as ever to expand beyond the boundaries of land held by even the colonial regime, inflicting only more pain and suffering against the Ukrainian people.\n\nEven with these irreconcilable differences, the people still question our war against the UPA, unfortunately. All we can answer these concerns with for now is a quick end to this deeply unpopular war."

 # Starting Ministers

 FUK_Vasyl_Stus_for_desc: "§Y"Face of Freedom"\nHead of the Department of People's Education\nPopular Front§!\n--------------\n§LVasyl Stus cannot recall a life free from the jackboot. Born in 1938, his earliest memories were of the German invasion, and his life has been shadowed by its effects ever since. Headstrong and loathing his circumstances, his early rebellions were tempered by more careful voices, who inducted Stus into a safer form of resistance: underground literature, where his anger was honed and filed down into scathing poetry.\n\nFifteen years of pouring his anger out onto paper has prepared him for a new position in the UNRA: their chief PR man, who motivates soldiers and civilians alike to dream of and fight for a free Ukraine. He is the young face of militant anti-fascism within the UNRA, articulating a vision for victory and inspiring the will to fight for it.§!"

 FUK_Ivan_Dzubia_eco_desc: "§Y"Inexperienced Idealist"\nHead of the Department of Finance and Cooperation\nLeft-Wing Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LIvan Dziuba is a man of letters, a dedicated nationalist who believes in the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people. He is a staunch anti-chauvinist whose concerns for ethnic minorities has brought him into conflict with more conservative elements within the UNRA. He is a committed leftist who sees a bright future for all Ukrainians if she has the will to fight for that future.\n\nWhat he is not is an economist or a manager. Nevertheless, a man of letters is needed to look after the logistics needed to support this insurrection. Though lacking in economic expertise, Dziuba is committed to the cause and has a vision for the future. Perhaps that is all Ukraine needs for now.§!"
 
 FUK_Oleksander_Ohloblyn_hog_desc: "§Y"Our 'Friendly' Collaborator"\nProvisional Governor of the Brest Oblast\nNational Conservatism§!\n--------------\n§LThe mayor of occupied Brest, upon seeing the blue and yellow proudly hoisted above him, revealed himself to be an agent for a free Ukraine. Years of covert support bought him a position of power in the insurgency, despite the misgivings of some. They danced around the subject of his tenureship as mayor of Kyiv, when he allowed the slaughter of its Jewish population. They privately wondered about his commitment to the cause.\n\nSadly for them, Oleksander Ohloblyn's presence in the UNRA is too useful to deny. He brings with him experienced collaborators familiar with the RK's existing political and economic structures. They proclaim themselves patriots eager to fix the Nazi's horrors and their mistakes. Yet it remains to be seen whether Ohloblyn is committed to a Ukraine that can stand on its own and defeat Germany, or one that can merely co-exist with them.§!"
 
 FUK_Taras_Bulba_Borovets_sec_desc: "§Y"Founder of the UNRA"\nHead of the Department of Military Affairs\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LWhen the Germans invaded, there was a young anti-Soviet militia officer that helped support their efforts against the Russians. Why, then, did he leave their service with a hundred men into the forests and re-emerge as founder of the UNRA? Perhaps it is a way he thinks he can wipe the blood from his hands, shed at Olevsk and elsewhere. Perhaps he could simply never abide any future for Ukraine in which it was subordinate.\n\nBulba Borovets leads the UNRA's military against the RK's forces, planning for and preparing his men to fight the German occupiers. In contrast with the idealists around him, he does not engage in questions of what comes after. Borovets is not particularly sold on the futures others have in store for the UNRA, but he puts his concerns aside for now. If he fails, Ukraine will not have any future.§!"

 POLITICS_YURIY_HORLIS_DESC:0 "What is culture? What is it that mends and defines so many nations, and what is it that Germany has obsessed over since the beginning of the NSDAP's rule over Germany, then Europe?\n\nIf you were to ask Yuriy Yuryovych Horlis, the leader of the Ukrainian branch of the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army, however, he would tell you of what makes up the culture of Ukraine; the language, the freedom, and the determination for a Ukrainian state. Horlis has fought for these values since before the days of the Galicians' first forays into western Ukraine, spreading the ideals which Yuriy had always believed in, since his days as a liaison for the first Ukrainian People's Republic. With the help of his ethnic and ideological allies within Galicia, however, it will be far from the last. So long as the Ukrainian culture survives, then Ukraine will always survive.\n\nFor now, however, Horlis will fight tooth and nail for his people and will unite Ukraine, once and for all. From Galicia to the Sea of Azov, Ukraine will be made whole, and it will finally come to know the democracy it was robbed of so long ago, by the Russians and communists of years past.\n\nNow, however, is not the time to reflect on the past. Now is the time to look towards the future. A future of an eternal Ukrainian culture, a future of a legitimate democracy for Ukraine, and a future where Ukrainians can walk tall without a German or Russian pointing a gun at their back. With Galicia and Ukraine at his back, it is not a question of when Ukraine will become free, but how Yuriy Horlis will do it.\n\nOr so he prays."

 FUK_Vasyl_Stus:0 "Vasyl Stus"
 POLITICS_VASYL_STUS_DESC:0 "Poet, soldier, writer, and resistance member, Vasyl Stus is a great many things. More than most, however, he believes in a free Ukraine. A free Ukraine that does not come from betraying the core ideals of freedom, or the base aspects of common sense. A free Ukraine to be proud of, and that is capable of remaining free. With a broad anti-German coalition behind him, and the Reich in crisis, it seems that if Ukraine has even the slightest hope of achieving this, it is now.\n\nAs a young man, Stus caught wind of the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army in Galicia and has since fought for their cause, though he has since picked up a civilian position. With the war of liberation won, and the election firmly in hand, many are anxious about the future. Some fear Ukraine will run itself into the ground. Others believe it is throwing away its opportunity for freedom. Many within the ranks of Stus' own political alliance believe Ukraine cannot uphold the values of liberty at home and remain free from the Germans at the same time.\n\nStus fears they might be right."

 FUK_Ivan_Dzubia:0 "Ivan Dziuba"
 POLITICS_IVAN_DZUBIA_DESC:0 "To those in the nascent Republic of Ukraine, Ivan Dziuba appears to be the ultimate countryman, a writer and thinker who has done all he can for his country. His writings have spread far and wide, following the Republican army in each town they liberate. Rather than speaking to the hardened insiders, Dziuba spoke to everyone, to all those who sought a better future for Ukraine. Rather than following the road of hatred like many nationalists, he has struck out on a socialist and anti-chauvinist nationalist program. His words have captured a nation - and seemingly, they have also created a president.\n\nThe incoming president may be inexperienced - he is young, just barely thirty years of age, and has until now been more defined by his thoughts than his administration. Yet President Dziuba knows his words, his nation, have the power to create something greater. The Ukrainian people are free - now, they must learn to be themselves.\n\nNow, they must learn to survive."

 FUK_Oleksander_Ohloblyn:0 "Oleksander Ohloblyn"
 POLITICS_OLEKSANDER_OHLOBLYN_DESC:0 "During his time as the German-appointed mayor of Kyiv, Oleksander Ohloblyn imagined himself as inoffensive. Ohloblyn's slightest victories were proof of his even hand; his evils were forced upon him by Nazi bureaucrats. Even as his administration filled with Fascistic OUN allies, even as he sent the Jewish community to their deaths, he held to a core belief that all of this was an act of caring.\n\nSlowly isolated by the NSDAP, Ohloblyn found an opportunity to return to prominence when he began to work with a desperate UNRA. His successes exceeded his wildest dreams: the revolution he attached himself to defeated all opposition, his allies infiltrated its leadership, and assassinations, bribery, and intimidation ensured that his crypto-Bolshevik opponents would not be elected. Now, he can continue to protect his nation through the only means he has - submission. Safe in the belief that his old ways proved true, Ohloblyn is certain that through courtesy and obedience, he can protect his people from the worst of Germany's impulses.\n\nThe bodies buried beneath Babi Yar prove otherwise."

 FUK_the_new_hruchevsky_desc: "Once, for a pure, brief moment in time, Ukraine breathed free. There were no tyrants with a boot against our neck, there were no Bolsheviks or fascists bleeding us dry, and, for a very brief moment, there was peace. This peace, this eternal justification of our being, this monument to the Ukrainian dream, was started by the greatest hero the national revolution had ever seen since that day; Mykhailo Hruchevsky, one of the few historians of Ukrainian history at the time. Since his election to the head of the Central Rada in 1917, the dream has long suffered setback after setback. By the time of the 1930s, the last dedicated source of Ukrainian autonomy was in Polish Galicia, within nothing more than the niche political party of the UNDO.\n\nOnce the Bolsheviks invaded Poland, and all seemed lost, the Soviets found themselves employing local collaborative elements, the UNDO among them. As soon as the Germans crossed the border, and the UNDO took the opportunity to rise up. Since those days, we have fought against all occupiers of Ukraine, and we have not given up since. If the bloody Germans, mad Banderites, or damned Communists think we don't have it in us to keep going, they are wrong. Dead wrong."
 FUK_the_old_guard_of_the_republic_desc: "While many of our men continue to fight for Ukrainian democracy, there are very few which continue to shine as brightly as the old guard of the Republic.\n\nTaras Bulba-Borovets, a partisan at heart, Oleksandr Udovychenko, a general who bore the burden of exile, and Yuriy Tyutunnyk, a man who had once supported the Soviets. Their histories are filled with hardship and struggle, yet they were all in service to the Republic and our homeland. Each of these three men may be old, though they remain eager and willing to fight for the survival and liberation of our democracy and people. They will assist us to the best of their ability, and once the time comes, they will be instrumental in the destruction of the fascist tyrants."
 FUK_borovets_commissars_desc: "Since the UNDO effectively couped the U-SSR military government in Galicia, and even further beyond in the last days of the Bolshevik invasion, Taras Bulba-Borovets has fought for Democracy with his armies of supporters for decades on end. While constantly harassed by disorder within his ranks and arrests from German forces, Borovets has stood firmly for our cause. Currently occupied in maintaining the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army within the Generalgouvernement's borders, the living legend has found himself wanting for manpower.\n\nWith a recent wave of volunteers now waiting in the wings, we have the option to send them towards Borovets for training under his faithful "100 Man Army" of commissars, so named after those faithful few who have stuck with Borovets for so long. Given these reinforcements, it won't be long before these skilled men and women find themselves a part of those legendary 100."
 FUK_heirs_of_the_exiles_desc: "Exile is something many Ukrainians know of intimately. When the Bolsheviks came first, those who resisted were forced to leave their homes and become emigres, exiles in a foreign land, surviving until their time to return comes. And while they settled into their new homes, and went about their new lives, none have ever forgotten about their homeland. While most remain in their homes, watching from afar as our land is butchered, some return to their ancestral home, Side-by-side, they stand in solidarity with us, marching with us, fighting with us, bleeding with us. They give the Republic the legitimacy of the true government of Ukraine that it so desperately needs, and they give us something which the people need in these trying times - hope."
 FUK_the_culturalists_might_desc: "For all their heinous crimes, the greatest tragedy of Ukraine's occupation was the suppression and persecution of Ukrainian culture. Ivan Dziuba and the Culturalists treat this as the existential threat that it is, connecting root nationalism to that very shared culture, and advocating at every turn for resources to be spent on its spread.\n\nGrowing in influence, they have a simple yet very powerful message, and work to build grassroots support among the people. Though of course operating in a decentralized manner, they have proven extremely effective in organizing the militias that will be needed in the fights to come."
 FUK_the_slave_book_clubs_desc: "A nation's culture is its soul, the Nazis know this well. In their attempts to stomp out our nation under their iron heel, they have sought to deny their slaves access to their culture, their very souls, their identity as Ukrainians, and as human beings. We reject their tyranny.\n\nWe will infiltrate the slave camps and slums across Ukraine, spreading food, protection, compassion, and books. Books are the key to culture, to civilization itself. To deny a man literacy is to lock off a part of his mind and doom him to ignorance. So, we will help educate the slaves of the Reich, so that one day, when they are free, they can express themselves and take pride in who they are."
 FUK_galician_roots_of_the_ukrainian_tree_desc: "Our main base of support lies in Galicia. While the Ukrainians there receive better treatment than the Poles, they know that it is a farce to pit them against their brothers in bondage. Enslavement is still enslavement, and freedom is still freedom, no matter what the slavers say. We are glad our people see this.\n\nNot only that, but our roots also lie here - it was Galicia where the UNDO was born, proud defenders of Ukrainian rights under Polish rule and the Soviet occupation. When we proclaim Ukraine's liberation from fascist tyranny, a beautiful tree will sprout, and it's roots will be in Galicia, the birthplace of a new Ukrainian democracy, its fruits being granted to all under its shade."
 FUK_eternal_monuments_to_unity_desc: "The discord that should otherwise exist between the many men - now co-operating in pursuit of a shared goal - has astonishingly failed to manifest, and working together they have managed to make incredible progress in their goals. Though certainly amazing in its own right, this unexpected unity also offers tremendous opportunity to demonstrate national cohesion.\n\nThis opportunity cannot be missed, and so a campaign of 'information' will be launched. The bravery and camaraderie existing between these men will be showcased, and in so doing the same principles can be attributed to the state."
 FUK_our_men_on_the_inside_desc: "There are many brave souls in Ukraine who have accepted the ire of their countrymen in order to 'collaborate' with the occupation - and thereby infiltrate it. Among these stand Ohloblyn, formerly the mayor of Kiew and now serving as the mayor of Brest following a forced relocation by Koch. Though saddled with Bahaziy, the fascist, as his deputy both then and now, he has been able to keep the man in check and thereby maintain his position.\n\nA most useful position. Information, supply, and weaponry can be and is redirected to liberating forces, moving the state ever closer to freedom. A new shipment of both is immediately forthcoming."
 FUK_ohloblyns_place_in_brest_desc: "Ohloblyn may have been exiled, demeaned, and forgotten, but that doesn't mean he's powerless. Under his watch is a small collection of minor anti-partisan and police brigades, all of which are at least willing to work with us. Some of these men are strident democrats, simply trying to protect their people from any further damage. Others are Melnykite fascists simply tired of Reich mismanagement. Whatever their motives, we can use them. While not enough for a full division, their manpower will prove valuable in our fight against the Nazi menace."
 FUK_a_bureaucratic_reshuffle_desc: "Fortunately for us, there is a healthy variety of capable, suitably sympathetic bureaucrats who may be inclined to lend their talents to our cause. Less fortunately is the fact that most of them languish in useless positions in which their abilities are all but wasted on menial tasks that accomplish little. Meanwhile, Melnyk's collaborators have stacked the bench in Brest-Litovsk, and if we are to gain a foothold there, we will need to find a creative solution to this little roadblock.\n\nOleksandr Ohloblyn has presented such a solution. He shall begin the process of a "bureaucratic reshuffle" in Brest-Litovsk and ensure that bureaucrats loyal to us take all of the top spots, while making sure Melnyk's men find themselves in the useless offices that our allies once held. Bahaziy's lot won't be too pleased with this maneuver, but we have not come this far without already stepping on a few toes."
 FUK_promote_popular_participation_desc: "Participation in our struggle against tyranny is broad-reaching, yet some struggle to understand what it truly is.\n\nWhat is democracy, if not the participation of the common people in governance of the nation, in resistance to fascism, in solidarity with our country folk? To liberate ourselves, we, the common masses of free peoples must work together for something greater, an idea with merit, for ourselves and the Republic. Yet we also fight for the liberation of not just ourselves, but of our friends, family, even complete strangers. Should we shirk in our duties, should we miss even one Ukrainian, all this would not be worth it. The people must know that without their help, they and the ones next to them cannot, in any sense of the word, be free."
 FUK_prying_open_the_pipeline_desc: "For those in the Reichskommissariat Moskowien, buying guns is a surprisingly easy affair. A steady stream of illicit weapons pour out of Germany daily, to be siphoned by their various factions and used to conduct their endless war. Until now, the PG has supported itself through less reliable methods of raiding and desertion, but that can change. With our connections through Ohloblyn, we may be able to divert this pipeline for our own ends. Each German gun will leave us more prepared for this upcoming war - in time, perhaps more than the Germans themselves."
 FUK_recontest_galicia_desc: "At the westernmost extreme of Ukraine lies Galicia, a region stuck in a rather... complicated situation. Currently, it lies under the jurisdiction of the Generalgouvernement, separated from Germany's administration in Ukraine. Despite this, much of our popular support comes from this region regardless of the arbitrary lines the Germans have deigned to draw across Eastern Europe.\n\nUnfortunately, our mortal enemies, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, also have considerable sway over the people of Galicia. We cannot allow them to gain a monopoly over one of the few regions we can call our own. Coordinating efforts to combat their influence will be rather difficult in such a distant area, but the alternative may cost us our only reliable base of support."
 FUK_saturday_night_mass_desc: "Over the course of the administrative reorganization following the West Russian War, the effects of which landed our close allies Ohloblyn and Bahaziy into leadership of Brest, have also sent us a treasure trove of "untrustworthy" regional governors in the region surrounding us. Whether these are low-level bureaucrats, well-meaning collaborators, or just plain-old power-hungry pawns, we can begin taking action on those who we have found liable to be amenable to our cause.\n\nThrough singling out those who will likely work with us and persuading them to aid us -or more likely, only making them aware of our existence- we will find ourselves with a great many new recruits, and many more connections once the opportunity to rise presents itself. All we need to do is hold meetings with the likely supporters, and we hold ourselves access to a fantastic potential meeting place or two."
 FUK_the_banderite_files_desc: "Defeating the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in Galicia will be no small task. These vengeful Banderites are fanatics, and have been known to fight with an almost animalistic ferocity. That being said, radical ideals are no substitute for proper tactics, and with the help of a little creative thinking, supplanting them as the dominant partisan group in the region may indeed be possible.\n\nOur initial strategy shall be to remain a step ahead of the Banderites at all times. Partisan units shall observe their patrols, examine the effect of their ambushes, and study which avenues of attack they are most comfortable with. Once we have this knowledge in our arsenal, we shall use it against them and root out the UPA once and for all."
 FUK_rally_the_turncoat_coppers_desc: "The Germans have long understood that holding the lands of the East with the Wehrmacht alone is an impossible task. Here in Ukraine, many of the local policing duties have fallen into the hands of native police units who collaborate with the occupiers in order to free up their soldiers for more pressing fronts. The Germans may intend to turn us against one another, but this may prove to be their undoing.\n\nTo seize Brest-Litovsk, we need only reach out to the police departments there and sway them to see things from our point of view. As far as we know, the tendrils of the UPA have not managed to penetrate into the local law enforcement, and it would be unwise to sit around and wait for them to seize this chance before we do. Should all go to plan, we will gain a very useful ally indeed when the uprising begins in earnest."
 FUK_pull_some_strings_desc: "Ohloblyn has connections and influence within the Brest region, and some of our men do not realize that our goals reach farther than their imagination. Their suggestions involve Ohloblyn utilizing such influence to pull the policemen of the Brest region to our side here and now, yet we asked them one question. Why not equip them first?\n\nThe Reichskommissariat is desperate to stamp out resistance, blinded by their urge to crush us once and for all. So desperate, in fact, that Ohloblyn and his friends could send a request for additional equipment to be sent to the Brest region in order to bring about a more swift end to resistance there. Using such emotions to our advantage is what may yet give us the edge in the coming fight."
 FUK_build_up_the_polissian_sich_desc: "The Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army have been driven deep into the Galician mountains. Despite this, they are still a formidable force, possessing hardened fighters, deep ties into their region, and a willingness to fight and die surpassed perhaps only by our own.\n\nIt is therefore time to ensure that our alliance is formalized, politically if not quite yet militarily, and so cement future relations. The Polissian Sich is valuable indeed, and we will benefit from such cooperation in the future."
 FUK_organize_the_mobs_desc: "The inevitable grows closer and closer. The instability gripping the occupation state and its loathsome administrators grows stronger and stronger, and more and more people are emboldened to take a stand against it. Yet the puppets still have strength, and in time they will crush the bodies, if not the spirit, of these brave souls. Unless we take action.\n\nWe will. We will organize, arm, and task them with purpose, and in so doing turn them from a mob into an army. They stand a chance, if they stand with us. The invaders have none."
 FUK_call_the_collaborators_desc: "In an ideal world, we would renounce any man who worked to maintain the German hold on our land. However, we do not live in an ideal world.\n\nAdministrators, bureaucrats, soldiers, we need them all. Our manpower reserves can drastically be improved with the addition of these Ukrainian collaborators, and their knowledge would do wonders fueling our new beast. With every taker, we gain information, intelligence, and caches of precious weaponry. Past the moral conundrum, using this vast bank of resources is a no brainer.\n\nThe news shall be spread. Posters, pamphlets, word of mouth. Join the Republic, no matter your crimes Waffen-SS, the National Army, or the Auxiliary Police, the past makes no more difference. If you wish to fight for our Ukrainian Republic, we welcome you!"
 FUK_a_deal_with_the_reds_desc: "It is impossible to downplay the size of the upcoming struggle we must surmount for a free Ukraine; savage Banderites, the Reichs armies, and zealous Bolsheviks all stand in opposition to the establishment of democracy in our homeland. We cannot afford to face all three of our enemies at once, and we may not have to. As much as we may loathe the Reds for decades of socialist dictatorship, we share a mutual hatred of the fascists that far outweigh our animosity for each other.\n\nWe'll use our contacts to send a message to the communists asking for a ceasefire, maybe even an agreement of cooperation, to destroy the vile forces of the UPA and the Nazis. It won't last, of course, but one less enemy to deal with in the early phases will give us time to build up and annihilate them later."
 FUK_chase_the_communists_out_desc: "Many in our ranks were not even born when Ukraine was last under Soviet occupation. They never experienced the horrors and persecution that Communist rule entailed - while this was never as severe as it is now under a fascist government - the red's incompetence led directly to the nightmare we now live in.\n\nSome of the more naive among us want to cooperate with the communists as long as the Swastika flies over Ukraine. The communists who so gladly persecuted us when we weren't necessary to their survival? No! We will not work with the communists. Ukraine will be free of all dictators, whether red or brown.\n\nWe'll strike the red strongholds in the west, removing the tumor that would otherwise grow to cripple Ukraine. The fascists and bolsheviks are fundamentally the same at heart, and soon the west will be free of them - and then the rest of Ukraine will follow."
 FUK_prepare_a_provisional_government_desc: "The Nazi abomination is falling apart - their authority in the west of Ukraine has become little more than a formality, with the central occupation force unable to extend their control outside certain urban areas. It is finally time for our partisan movement to prepare to take up the reins of government. A provisional one will be formed to quickly take the place of the Reichskommissariat - a democratic, liberal republic, not communist and not fascistic. Horlis and his loyal men will take the helm and create a proper system that serves the people and will listen to their demands.\n\nThe transition will be difficult - our country has been stripped of much of its resources, and few have had the opportunity to govern themselves. But let this be a step towards prosperity for all Ukrainians - a dream much closer to being realized than it may ever have been."
 FUK_what_of_the_occupiers_desc: "Generalplan Ost, and its cruel implementation over the past two decades, meant that thousands of Germans moved east to settle in our lands, 'cleansing' it of Ukrainians and fertilizing our lands with our blood. Now there are hundreds of thousands of settlers across the country, many glad followers of the Nazi cause. The question of how to deal with them is debated within our movement. Some consider that trying to deport all Germans will create a fifth column against our cause - particularly among those that lived in Ukraine prior to the occupation. Others consider that there is no other adequate course of action. Questions regarding what happens to the children of these settlers who had no choice in the matter have also arisen.\n\nIt will be nearly impossible to make a decision that appeases everyone within the movement. The more collaborator-sympathizing part of our faction wishes to give concessions to the settlers, which will not go down well with our more nationalistic followers, yet a decision must still be made if we are to deal with the issue at hand decisively. Let us avoid falling over the first hurdle to creating a free Ukraine."
 FUK_a_promise_desc: "The leader of the supposedly superior Aryan race lies on his deathbed - as his health falters, his tendrils retreat from Ukraine. Those in the west are ready to fight for their freedom and make the most of the approaching opportunities.\n\nHorlis will prepare a speech to rally supporters of a free and democratic Ukraine. He will promise free and fair elections and that they will be held as soon as possible once Ukraine is liberated from fascist and communist rule. We won't use authoritarian tricks like a 'temporary dictatorship' or the elections being guided. Ukraine must be truly free once it is liberated. It will be!"
 FUK_the_anthem_of_the_liberated_desc: "The clock chimes, and Ukraine will rise. Germany ailes under its own weight, the Reichskommissariat crumbles, and Koch lays on his deathbed. Never since the days of 1917 have we found ourselves with such a firm chance for National Liberation. From what we can tell, with many garrisons currently either dissolving in light of Germany's effective collapse or struggling against many of the other partisan movements taking the initiative, it is clear that the time to rise is now or never.\n\nBulba-Borovets' Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army has already begun the preliminary actions of rising up once the Generalgouvernement falls, and Ohloblyn's government in Brest is mobilizing at this very moment. Before long, Ukraine will be free, and we will play our hand in bringing down the Reichskommissariat.\n\nWhether or not we live to see it."

 FUK_another_1917: "A Republic, From the Ashes" 
 FUK_another_1917_desc: "Friends and patriots, our time is now! Just as in 1917, our country is beset by German invaders, traitors, and Soviet oppressors. And once again, the time has come for a national struggle for freedom and justice! We cannot fail as we once did, for the stakes have never been higher! Because defeat here does not merely mean the yoke of foreign devils or the suppression of Ukrainian self-determination, it could spell the end of Ukraine and her people at the hands of slavers and butchers!\n\nWe will not go quietly into that good night; we will fight, persevere, and prevail! Long live Ukraine!"

 FUK_scramble_the_militias: "Scramble the Forces"
 FUK_scramble_the_militias_desc: "It has begun. Everything we have been waiting, fighting, preparing for, is now happening, and Ukraine is in flames. Not a moment must be lost. Orders will be sent along generated lines, and we will march to war.\n\nIt will not be easy - or fast. All the soldiers and volunteers will take time to organize into real fighting forces, and dispositions will need to be made to cover all the new, and fluid, fronts. But these challenges will be overcome. Ukraine will be free again."

 FUK_borovets_100_alone_no_more: "Borovets' Hundred, Alone No More"
 FUK_borovets_100_alone_no_more_desc: "The figure of Borovets is, undoubtedly, an inspiring one. For years he fought the occupiers, forming a large resistance group and then leaving it, with only one hundred faithful, after it fell increasingly into banditry. He never gave up - and neither will Ukraine. Neither will we.\n\nThere are countless recruits who have cited this story as reason for their joining, and their potential can be nurtured. Each of the one hundred are skilled, and can in turn train these new men. In this way the legacy of Borovets will endure, and the one hundred will grow into many more."

 FUK_masses_behind_us: "The Masses Behind Us"
 FUK_masses_behind_us_desc: "Though the Culturalists cannot be said to have the most powerful strike arm, it similarly cannot be denied that they are masters of spreading information and propaganda. The occupiers have never been able to stop them getting the message to the masses, and this is still the case.\n\nBy providing them additional funding and support, we can ensure that they aid the uprising in the still-occupied zones, spreading the message and reminding those who may be undecided of the Republic that is to come."

 FUK_scraps_of_the_pipeline: "The Scraps of the Pipeline"
 FUK_scraps_of_the_pipeline_desc: "Before the war, the smuggling routes between Ukraine and Moskowien were enormous. That has changed, dramatically, since the uprising and tight lockdown on the borders. Such pressure has shattered the network's centralization, and profiteers of all stripes are selling to both sides. This cannot continue.\n\nWe will crush these bandits, seize their ill-gotten gains, and put them out of business for good. Not only will this allow us to acquire much needed supply, but it will further prove the righteousness of our cause. The operation begins now."

 FUK_a_new_job_for_ohloblyns_men: "A New Job for Ohloblyn's Men"
 FUK_a_new_job_for_ohloblyns_men_desc: "The RK had many collaborators. These men discarded their honor for many reasons - career advancement, fear for their own safety and the safety of their families - but most never thought they'd be at open war with their fellow countrymen.\n\nIt would be a shame not to use some of these reluctant collaborators to our own advantage. Oleksander Ohloblyn can bring us many collaborator RK police units, and their intel will be invaluable to our cause.\n\nOf course, many in the UNRA may not be pleased with this. But so be it..."

 FUK_UNRA_united_and_strong: "UNRA, United and Strong"
 FUK_UNRA_united_and_strong_desc: "The Galician divisions of the UNRA have benefited immensely from the rugged land in which they operate, protected from the worst of the occupation's excesses. Borovets has, over many years, turned it into an elite force among the resistance, and its efficacy in ambush is near-legendary.\n\nNow, as we hope to liberate all of Ukraine, the time has come to fuse the UNRA together more actively, combining the our divisions in Galicia and Polissia to form a united force capable of overcoming our rivalry with the UPA and overthrowing the RK at its core. If we wish to unite Ukraine, first we must stand united."

 FUK_create_an_officer_corps: "Create an Officer Corps"
 FUK_create_an_officer_corps_desc: "A movement needs leadership. Leadership means officers, and we must ensure that we have the cadres needed. Much has been debated on whether to prioritize quality or quantity, and though this decision has not yet been made, we must nonetheless give additional focus to our officer corps.\n\nGiving them more time to train, and ensuring that such training is as proper and efficient as possible, will serve excellently in the short term. Better plans will be made, but for now effectiveness can be improved directly, and that will suffice."

 FUK_offer_the_alternative: "Offer the Alternative"
 FUK_offer_the_alternative_desc: "The communists offer the Ukrainian people a totalitarian dictatorship and the Banderites offer them cultish worship of a dead man, it should be abundantly clear that the Republic is the only real alternative to a nation under the boot of fascism. Therefore, we shall reaffirm our commitments to democracy to show those suffering that we are the only ones prepared to offer the Ukrainian people real change.\n\nFor freedom does not mean a hollow independence full of fallow fields, it means a chance for every man, woman, and child to breathe up, to live, and to grow old and die happy."

 FUK_drop_the_hammer_win_the_war: "Drop the Hammer, Win the War"
 FUK_drop_the_hammer_win_the_war_desc: "If we are to win this war - and quickly - we must make a more concerted effort. We must increase the pace of organization, of fitting out, and of deployment. Until now, our ability to do this has often been a question of supply. It is now a question of will.\n\nWe have the manpower. We have the weapons. We need only put the pieces together, outfit and dispatch more militia battalions, of ever increasing size. We will do this - and then we will win."

 FUK_make_volunteers: "Make Volunteers"
 FUK_make_volunteers_desc: "No longer can we hope to secure victory through volunteers and decentralized recruitment. They are dedicated, loyal, and effective beyond all measure, yes - but there are simply not enough of them. We must increase our efforts to further conscription. We must institute a draft.\n\nThis will take considerable work - after all, such a formalized draft and induction machine is not created overnight - but we must endure. This war will have an insatiable hunger for manpower, and we must not be found wanting."

 FUK_establish_the_war_machine: "Establish the War Machine"
 FUK_establish_the_war_machine_desc: "As with other areas, we must formalize the apparatus of state in order to win this war. Underground workshops can outfit an insurgency, but they cannot outfit an army, and we cannot for a moment entertain the possibility of losing access to adequate quantities of weaponry.\n\nWe must prepare the war economy, organizing and retooling the factories and supply chains needed to operate them. It will no doubt be an enormous effort, but there is quite possibly none more vital."

 FUK_quiet_grumbling_stomachs: "Quiet the Grumbling Stomachs"
 FUK_quiet_grumbling_stomachs_desc: "As our other preparations continue, we cannot - must not - forget the absolute primacy of ensuring adequate food supplies. A famine would be crushing not only to our military efforts, but also to our legitimacy in the eyes of the Ukrainian people. We will therefore take steps to protect and empower the farmers while expanding supply.\n\nProduction quotas will be raised, of course, but this will be accompanied by land grants in order to meet those quotas, along with other exemptions, equipment, and other support. We must have food, and they must grow it."

 FUK_deal_with_dissent: "Deal with Dissent"
 FUK_deal_with_dissent_desc: "Freedom is an inalienable human right.\n\nThat being said, should our enemies take advantage of our lax control to undermine the war effort, none of us will have any freedom at all. There are still many communists, Banderites, and unrepentant collaborators running around in our territory. These will need to be rounded up.\n\nFurthermore, we must restrict the activities of the press, and of private political associations. Treason-minded enemy agents can pose as 'journalists' or 'activists' to sow doubt and discontent behind the lines - we cannot allow this to happen.\n\nThese measures may not be palatable, but they are necessary if we are to be victorious."

 FUK_collaborator_connections: "Collaborator Connections"
 FUK_collaborator_connections_desc: "Although distasteful - to say the least - it cannot be denied that the connections to industry made by Ohloblyn through his earlier collaboration are useful to our cause. They can, will, and must be leveraged if we are to build a strong state, and so shall it be.\n\nIt will, however, be necessary to present them in a 'creative' fashion, and to minimize the involvement that Bahaziy had in this regard. A sacrifice made for the good of the country, and a figure deservedly minimized. Quite a small price to pay, indeed."

 FUK_restore_our_logistics: "Restore Our Logistics"
 FUK_restore_our_logistics_desc: "The trials of war have exacted an enormous toll on the railways crossing the Republic. Both our forces and those of our enemies targeted those held by the other side, and there now exist innumerable disruptions, damaged and destroyed lines, and many other inflicted problems. This must be addressed, and resources will be required to do so.\n\nIt will, however, be well worth it - assisting in troop transport, the delivery of supplies and, of course, support of the civilian sector as well. Work will begin immediately."

 FUK_the_cure_to_fascist_rot: "The Cure to Fascist Rot"
 FUK_the_cure_to_fascist_rot_desc: "We were fools to trust the collaborators. Any man who would throw away their country to work for the Nazis is not a man with any principles other than self-preservation. We have stocked our armies and our government with amoral shirkers, only trying to save their own skins. Former OUN members and RK sympathizers are running amok, taking advantage of our mercy to eat away at the war effort.\n\nVasyls Stus and Taras Bulba-Borovets have offered a solution. Our tolerance must end. Every man in the UNRA must be totally devoted to our struggle, and we cannot afford to let our ranks be infiltrated by fascists. A purge is in order."

To prevent "friendly" fire incidents, they will be integrated into the army but kept as separate units from the partisans.\n\nNevertheless, it should go without saying that this is an extremely unpopular move with every part of our leadership bar the collaborators themselves.

Increasing recycling programs for the civilian populace won't hurt, either. Doubling down on funding to our military industries won't hurt, either, and neither will increasing procurement to maintain our industries.\n\nNo matter the cost, we will need to divert resources to winning this war.

They long for bread to be put on their table, for their children to no longer starve, to not have to continue without end on an empty stomach.

That is why he offers his solution: collaboration.\n\nMany Ukrainians turn their nose at this idea, calling it an affront to everything they have fought for. Ohloblyn can only say that he is not naive.

There is a third way, a more humane option.\n\nIvan Dziuba and his Culturalist movement preach a leftist nationalism - a focus on what matters, what they fought their war for - Ukraine. Fascism must be defeated, but it can not be done in such a heavy-handed manner.

However, this idea struggles to find appeal among a people who have just come out of a war, and whose only concern is how to put food on the table.

He'd been born in a Soviet, grew up in a Reichskommissariat, and was now fighting in the anarchy of civil war.\n\nWas every Ukrainian doomed to watch Ukraine go from one form of suffering to another? He couldn't remember much of the Soviet, other than knowledge passed down in books and stories, and that it was a time to which he should not return. His memories from then instead were a blur of chaos and bloodshed that he scarcely understood, a child's perspective of war. He remembered the Reichskommissariat too well. Life had changed so quickly from war to choking oppression, where he nonetheless fell in love with Ukraine. All these changes brought him here, the ultimate battlefield of change: War, something he grew to know well from the banned books he'd scrounged up and the little wars of his youth.\n\nThis was the first time his words were not treason, so in the lamplight of his command post, he tried to write something for his father, a man who represented such change to Stus. He sent out words, his soldiers, to fight this battle. Yet he knew there was no way to put all this on paper.\n\nOutside, the dark hues of night where his father hid had seeped into Ukraine's blue skies and dyed them pitch black. Perhaps he shouldn't remain in his afflictions' mire lest he lose more of the night. Instead, he stood up and left his post. It was dark enough that he could see the colorful translucent ribbon of the Milky Way. Maybe tonight, he didn't need words."

 FUK_civ_war.2.t: "Which is More: More or Less?"
 FUK_civ_war.2.desc: "A loud debate went on in the nondescript peasant farmhouse that was the UNRA's temporary headquarters. There was always something to argue about, had been ever since the Polissian Guard was founded, but tonight it was especially... energetic. The question: whether the resistance should prioritise quality or quantity in the fight to liberate Ukraine.\n\nOn the one side was Dziuba and his allies. As befit their views on the subject, more of them were arguing for their point. The argument was straightforward: "The peasant masses hate our enemies as much as we do. Our front has more holes in it than any opinion Ohloblyn expresses, and a single well-placed strike could destroy the entire army. We need the lines filled, so we should call farmers and other civilians to the frontline and thereby bolster our ranks! Is it not common sense?"\n\n"No way in Hell it's common sense," Borovets—the lone advocate of quality over quantity in the room—riposted. "Fill the line with untrained peasants and the fields will lie fallow as those farmers die to any disease or accident you can name, and that's before we get to how they'll fare in battle. No, we need to create a professional force based on discipline and training. If the UNRA can move faster and with better effect, who cares how many holes there are in the frontline?"\n\nAs the arguments became less and less substantive with every retort, the opinion slowly but surely swung in a given direction, which was—"

UNRA soldiers were distributing flags to the people, but there was a significant contingent of homemade signs and nationalist paraphernalia. Slogans crudely painted on blankets and sheets, German military uniforms torn to ribbons - the outpouring of emotion was intense and universal.\n\nAs the day wore on, and the most accessible symbols of German occupation were torn down, a sort of game emerged around the ones that were harder to get to. People who found creative ways to rip swastikas down from tall buildings were rewarded with alcohol and cheers. A huge crowd soon formed under the facade of the town's biggest hotel, which sported a huge Reichsadler in stone.\n\nFor hours, nobody could figure out how they were going to get to it. The most they were able to do was pour buckets of feces over it from the floors above - although this was stopped after it started spattering the people assembled below. Then a group of young men wandered into the square, carrying a set of spokes from a disassembled plough.\n\nThe work was on. The crowd managed to locate some rope, and started making huge grappling hooks. The hooks were taken up to the higher floors, wedged into the little nooks between the Reichsadler and the wall, and then the ropes were tossed down into the square below. With a hundred people pulling, the great eagle came down in no time - taking a good portion of the hotel's front wall with it."

 FUK_civ_war.4.desc: "As occupied territories were liberated, the UNRA forces observed that collaborators were practically everywhere in the administrations of those regions.\n\nSo many of them were present, in such influential positions, where a strong argument could be made—at least according to Ohloblyn—that they would be indispensable to the continuity of government in the newly-liberated regions, and a fundamental part of the new government of the Republic of Ukraine.\n\nDziuba was dismissive of that idea. "Rubbish," he said. "These 'cornerstones of the new Ukraine' you praise so highly, Ohloblyn, are a lot of traitors and sell-outs and nothing more. We struggle to trust you as it stands—then what likelihood is there that these people, many of whom we saw bending over backwards to accommodate Koch and his Nazis, would be any less untrustworthy than you are?"\n\nWhile Ohloblyn's lot sputtered, others called for a more moderate position on the subject. "I grant that the majority of these people are untrustworthy. But surely there are different levels of untrustworthiness, just like there are different severities of evil. Obviously a large portion of them should be dealt with like we will deal with the RK-U, but surely we can trust the loyalty of a few of them here or there."\n\nIn the end, it was concluded that..."

Their ambush had worked perfectly - the Nazis had walked right into brutal enfilade fire that had destroyed the unit within minutes. All fun and games, until they had to spend hours preparing the bodies for burning.\n\nA soldier rushed up to him, gasping for breath. "General, we found a cache. Some valuables - furniture, crockery, shit like that. But guns, too, and lots of them."\n\nWhen the two arrived at the cache, they found some enterprising soldiers already helping themselves to their findings. One man had silver forks bristling in his pockets, while another had apparently decided to tote an entire dresser back to camp. Others were checking out the guns - a relatively old consignment of 50s-era German weapons, but still useful.\n\nBorovets' smile disappeared instantly. "Drop everything!" he barked, causing the soldiers to whip around in shock. "And I mean everything. Or I'll have you court-martialled for stealing from the Ukrainian people. Now!"\n\nWith much groaning and complaining, the soldiers reluctantly gave up their pickings. The SS's stolen goods went into one pile, which would be returned to their owners. The guns were given to those without working weapons or set aside for new recruits. Once the process was over, Borovets glared at the soldiers and began to speak.\n\n"We are not looters. We are not bandits. We are not thieves. We are soldiers, fighting for our country. If you think you're here to steal from our people, think again. Banditry is the German's work, not ours.""

A few of the generals cast him puzzled looks as they left the room, but they knew by now not to press too hard.\n\nAt some point, things had changed. When the war had first begun, these meetings were like a hydra talking to itself. Everybody was totally united in purpose and determination. Everybody knew what had to be done, and how it had to be done. But as the prospect of victory began to loom, the shift had subtly begun. People were now disagreeing. There were arguments between the civilians and the soldiers. There were even reports of a few fights - though nothing that couldn't be patched up over a few beers.\n\nAll the same, though, Horlis was worried. He doubted the UNRA would implode like the OUN had, but it was clear that reality would eventually assert itself. Though these were good men, united in determination to destroy the German oppressors, they were united in precious little else. Once the war ended, then the fights would really begin."

I've been talking to a friend in-" returned a more level headed voice, which was quickly cut off by a third.\n\n"Oh, Christ, not another one of your 'friends'." This is reckless," said the third, quiet yet cutting.\n\n"It's a practical choice. We need to make use of everything we-" replied the second voice, before once again being cut off by another.\n\n"You collaborators have been saying 'practical' for years to get Ukrainians killed! I'm sorry all of us 'idealists' didn't make the 'practical' choice of kissing Hitler's ass and shining his boots!" This voice was much louder. Stus and Dziuba couldn't make out the following conversation as it collapsed into indecipherable, angry noise. They should not have been late. They turned the corner to see a group of grown men in uniform arguing. Dziuba glanced at Stus, waiting for his rousing speech. Dziuba had plenty to say, but that was simply the dynamic.\n\nStus seemed to be thinking, and Dziuba began to reconsider his own action. It was about time he tried to lead, "Get a hold of yourselves!" he declared, immediately silencing a few of the men while others tried to continue their bickering in whispers. "This is not how an army, a nation, behaves. We are finally standing up for ourselves and taking what's ours, and you're arguing? Just because we disagree over how we got here doesn't exclude the fact that we are all Ukrainians, yearning for freedom, nor does it excuse handicapping ourselves with vitriol. There's still a war to be fought and every man here has a glorious role in it! We'll have plenty of time to argue after.""

Moreover, it also emerged from investigations by the Main Intelligence Directorate that there were a concerning number of fascist sympathisers, particularly of the several strains of Banderism currently espoused by the OUN. On being informed of this, the Provisional Government issued an order to remove these people from positions of power by any means necessary.\n\nWe are pleased to report that this has been done. Of a total of (REDACTED) people with suspect allegiances or alleged histories of crimes committed against the people of Ukraine while serving as collaborators, (REDACTED) were found guilty; of these\n\n- (REDACTED), some eighty-five percent, were executed\n- (REDACTED), approximately ten percent, were imprisoned\n- (REDACTED), approximately five percent, were permitted to remain free under strict conditions, and may be subject to further punishment if the Provisional Government deems appropriate.\n\nWe firmly believe that the removal of these traitors will ensure that Ukraine remains alive into the future.

I wonder if this new revolution will succeed and not perish in the womb. I wonder if all my arguments will be fulfilled, all in the worst manner imaginable.\n\nEach of us will be put to the firing line if we fail. The enemies in our midst have no sympathy.

Our men would be fixed up faster, rejuvenated to fight for the nation again." Dziubia had dropped the catalyst for the most recent argument. It was always like this. There was always some petty dispute over which region to prioritize or where to send resources.\n\n"Don't be so foolish. The quicker we win this war, the quicker we can start mending scrapes again." Ohloblyn's snap back to Dziubia was as toxic as ever, the inception of a full-blown row beginning to start.\n\nEach insult cut deep against one another as charges of "fascist" and "Bolshevik" were lobbed at one another. Horlis once thought they would have waited until the war was over to start - the decency to wait until election time.\n\nA hidden part of him twinged and pined, a sentiment that would never be revealed to the other men inside this room. A silent sympathy for the communists' decision to move east echoed within Horlis, a recognition for of hardship and the demise of their commands in Volyn and East Galicia.\n\nHe could only quell the fire in here and move on. How much more he could take of this, he did not know. Horlis could only pray that the war's end was in sight."

 FUK_election.0.desc: "For the first time in history, Ukrainians voted for more than a single party, and to choose a leader of their own choice.\n\nFrom Vinnytsia to Mariupol, ballot boxes left their stations chock-full of ballots, many of them unable to take even a single more. People willingly waited hours to cast their vote while others that had gotten out earlier prepared what food and drink they could find to make their neighbours' wait more tolerable.\n\nBut not all was sunshine and rainbows. Vigorous arguments were heard in houses, churches, and assembly halls; many were mere disagreements, but others divided families and ended friendships—an unfortunate concomitant of polarisation in a democracy on the edge of war.\n\nWorse yet, it was rumoured that in some districts, ballot-stuffing and vote-buying were practised. In others, closer to the Spivavtory, allegedly voters were being intimidated into supporting this or that candidate.\n\nDespite all this, the nation made its choice for the first time ever, and took pride in making history. It was precious to them, its flaws notwithstanding — for not even when Kyiv was the chief abode of the Rus' had the decision lay in anyone's hands but the monarch. In this heady atmosphere, a frontrunner emerged and was selected to steer free Ukraine into the future. That frontrunner was none other than..."

 FUK_election.1.desc: "Rodan was a militia soldier in the UNRA alongside his fellow guerilla fighters, skulking amidst the rain-swept ruins of the Kyiv battlefield. It was then that they came upon the ruins of an abandoned office complex, one that was used by the old regime where he and his comrades thought to wait out the storm. It was going to take a while before the civil government could rebuild the devastated urban centers, which was why this entire part of the city looked the way it did; The whole neighborhood was still smoldering from where fighting had knocked most of it down.\n\nInside of the place was about as dreary the skies outside, if not for the damp cold than from the refuse lining the hallways. Upturned desks, emptied filing cabinets, scattered papers covering the floor, and every so often, a faded Swastika banner left fluttering limply on a distant wall, still pinned to the crumbling plaster.\n\nRodan and his comrades made the best of their environment, there was little else to do until the weather got better anyhow. Some resorted to drinking alcohol, others to playing darts using their knives and the cracked portrait of Erich Koch on the wall. An interesting point was when the youngest of them tore one of the Nazi banners from the walls, laying it out on the floor to thrusting into it with his pelvis.\n\nAs Rodan sat back with his feet up on what he assumed to be the head honcho's desk, the smile that had been there for a moment then faded; it struck him the sheer apparatus it took for the Germans to rule in Ukraine, from Koch all the way down to this now derelict office building. He realized that this place was just one piece of all the Nazi had spent a generation building in Ukraine, as well as the gloomy implication that this is what the new republic would now have to build up entirely from scratch."

 FUK_election.2.desc: "Somewhere in a village near Cherkasy, two peasants were discussing politics over mugs of beer. One was completely indifferent to what was happening in the country - to him, the most important things were his family and his farm. His friend, however, was a staunch supporter of the Culturalist movement. He argued that only they could improve their lives and ease their burden. The former, as usual, didn't care much for his companion's speeches and scoffed at him. However, later that day, he wondered: maybe Culturalists weren't so bad, after all.\n\nSomewhere in Kyiv, a packed bar resonated with the public eagerly catching every word coming out of Vasyl Stus' mouth. He spoke emotionally of all the crimes committed by Germany against Ukraine, successfully appealing on behalf of everyone's friends and relatives lost due to the Reich's cruelty. He brilliantly ended his speech with a call for all of Europe to unite against Nazism, causing the audience to roar in approval.\n\nSomewhere in a country house in Bila Tserkva, Ohloblyn was hosting a dinner with high-ranking collaborationist officials. During the meeting, many concerns were expressed, mainly for their safety from the militias of the United Front and Culturalists, along with fears of the inevitable German reaction to the fall of their rule over its colony. Ohloblyn was so used to these complaints that he stayed quiet throughout the whole hour or two of discussions. Nevertheless, he understood that their concerns were valid, and his mind was already trying to find solutions to these problems. After the dinner was over and all the guests had left, Ohloblyn, still pondering a solution to the nation's troubles, made an inward resolve: he would keep Ukraine safe, no matter the cost."

Something drew his eyes from beyond the windows of his car, enough to bring the vehicle to an abrupt stop. Slobodan felt his jaw clench and his heart jump into his throat when he saw them. He should have just keep driving, but what he saw was...too much to ignore.\n\nSlobodan forced himself to swallow as he got out of the car, the door ajar as he stood there, reeling; the ropes still gripped around their necks, their pruned bodies drifting in the wind on a makeshift gallows. An execution and a very public one at that, even out here in what was as close to the middle of nowhere as one could get. The elements had long eaten away at the wooden planks slung over their shoulders, including the etchings detailing their crimes. Identity of both crime and criminal forever lost in the distant wilderness.\n\nSlobodan couldn't make out any insignias anywhere of any kind, not a swastika or a crossed hammer and sickle to be found anywhere. It could just as easily have been the Nazis lynching militiamen of the Red Army as it could have been the other way around, for all he knew it could have been a peasant dispute against their landlords gone horribly medieval. The sickening nature of what lay before him weighed on him; the pain of what the Germans had done to his country could not be as easily forgotten as these people clearly were, it would be a long road to travel before the horrors of what went on here could be laid to rest."

Always threatened, always subject to the whims of some other force. But, like the fire that warmed them both, it endured. It survived. And, most critically, it could always grow, if the proper conditions - money, industry, armed force, stability, and more - were provided.\n\nBoth had done their part, they knew, to try and provide those conditions, even if it had cost each a piece of themselves. Sacrifices of people and ideals. Collaboration. Double lives. 'Leaks' regarding people who knew too much about them, and threatened the positions that they held and exploited for eventual better use. Indeed, as the evening continued and stories were swapped, each better knew the compromises the other had made. Similarly, they saw the positive effects for shared eventual goals.\n\nThere was hope for Ukraine, they both knew. If they were willing to make the hard choices. If they were willing to work with those that few respected. If they were willing to do what needed to be done, whatever the cost to others - or to their own souls."

Ohloblyn had attended many such meetings in the past weeks and was growing tired of their repetitive nature, but he understood the importance of gaining more allies.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, though it had only been an hour, Ohloblyn was extremely exhausted. It was challenging to stay focused as the guests expressed their wariness of associating themselves with the Spivavtory, especially given the growing anger among the peasantry. He searched for a way to end the conference, but how? Then, an idea struck him.\n\n"...so, with all of that in mind, I don't think we can--"\n\n"Gentlemen," Ohloblyn suddenly interrupted the speaker. "Of course, all the concerns you've stated today are valid, but that shouldn't be the primary matter of our discussion, should it? I propose we talk about something else."\n\nEveryone looked at Ohloblyn, surprised and curious. "Now is my time to shine," he thought. Ohloblyn continued, "The sad truth is, despite United Struggle and Culturalists being patriots of Ukraine, they alone won't save our nation. The Germans will return, and it would be wise to negotiate with them, but neither Stus nor Dziuba will do that. Their actions may alienate the Reich, leaving us with no possibility for negotiations, and that means a war we can't win. Afterward, Ukraine would be devastated and completely destroyed. Do you want to see our nation in such a state again, gentlemen?"\n\nNo one spoke up."

An air of apprehension lingered between him and Bahaziy, evident in the desperate worry etched on Bahaziy's face. He handed over a list containing names—former collaborators and officials unlawfully detained by United Struggle's militias. His voice, filled with urgency as he pleaded, "These men need your help; only your voice can save them! Horlis, Stus, Borovets - every single one of these traitorous rats! You know what they'll do to our men!"\n\nOhloblyn studied each name carefully, his frown deepening at the notorious reputations that accompanied them. These were people renowned for their cruelty and corruption towards fellow Ukrainians. Fear flooded him at the request, sweat dripping down his forehead as he delved deeper into thought. For him, having to release these men would be an injustice to the people of Ukraine, and he found it difficult to decide. "I don't know; you know these people are-"\n\nShandruk leaned onto the table, his tone serious but measured, as he warned Ohoblyn before he could finish: "We can't afford to be blamed for any deaths, whether they be German or Ukrainian, at the hands of these militias. Germania will destroy us all." The air held an oppressive stillness as he spoke, as if it choked Ohloblyn himself. "You need to decide the course of action right now, because we're on our last damn legs here. It doesn't matter if one of them power sawed a kid's head in half, if they die to their hands, we'll be next on the list of casualties."\n\nAt that moment, he knew that no matter which choice he made, he couldn't just avoid any drastic consequence. Ohoblyn could only sigh, inhaling deeply as he silently cursed himself for doing so - before turning to Bahaziy's pleading eyes. "Right, I'll reach out to them.

The partisans smashed everything they could, screaming and laughing like jackals. The printing press had been smashed, pro-United Struggle fliers and posters had been slashed with a knife or torn to pieces, all while the brutes barked every kind of anti-sematic epithet at people just trying to earn a living.\n\nFyoder would never know why they let him walk away; The man with the rifle wordlessly followed Fyoder as he slowly made his way to the back of the store, staring silently from the back doorway as Fyoder broke into a sprint. It was the most frightening thing he'd experienced since the war, only to perhaps be eclipsed by what happened next.\n\nAfter running around the neighborhood for what felt like ages, Fyoder finally found a police officer that might have been able to help. Through panting and wheezing, he angrily explained what had happened; how he'd been attacked, how his workplace was vandalized, how the men were armed, how they were brazenly spouting Nazi rhetoric; his anger soon turned to horror as the cop seemed to scoff at him, that same stony look on his face as the thug from earlier as he walked passed Fyoder, seemingly without an ounce of pity in his eyes."

His calling also came with the perk of traveling to hidden corners of the country he'd never seen before, like the crowded streets he found himself in today. It was close to Brest and Spivator territory if the murmurs on the road were accurate, but the reception to his team's presence bore no hostility so far.\n\nHowever, the tremendous din of busy urban life began to pitter away, quieter and quieter into silence. The dense crowd's hectic movements slowed to a crawl, apprehensive eyes shifting toward the ground and away from the campaigners. Strong and burly men emerged from the masses, expressions stonefaced but for wrathful gazes that fixed upon Mykhailo and his party.\n\nMykhailo breathed deeply, trying to settle the fear in his stomach and think before stepping forward to meet the closest one. "Friends and countrymen, we've come here to-" a fist ended his sentence for him, breaking his jaw and sending his crumpled form to the ground.\n\nFor a moment, he could see the terrified faces of his friends and shapes moving toward them."

He was now overlooking the first draft of his next article for the university's academic journal when the office door quietly slid open. A quiet smile slipped onto his features as he greeted the Rector, which faded when he saw the man's grim expression.\n\n"Professor, I see you are working on your next article." The man's face contorted like he was unsure how to proceed. "How, er, fitting." he cleared his throat before continuing, "Have you heard of the discussion around your last article?"\n\n"I know it's turned some heads," Danylo replied neutrally. 'Collaboration and its Consequences: An Investigation.' The journal analyzed and explored the role of Ukrainian collaborators in the systemic murder of Ukrainian minorities, especially Jews. He knew it was controversial, but he was proud of his work.\n\nThe Rector tiredly heaved a sigh. "Some very senior figures in the government have criticized the article and have claimed it is 'dividing the Ukrainian people,' and have demanded an apology or even a retraction." at the wide-eyed stare of his colleague, he continued, "I'll be blunt, the university cannot afford a confrontation with these men, I need you to write an apology for the journal in your next article." Danylo was dumbstruck and outraged but then resigned. He weakly nodded, and the Rector left him to mourn his soon-to-be tarnished work."

For her brother, it was getting together with his friends and war buddies and hitting up the closest establishment that served a halfway decent beer. For Kalyna, it was indulging in a bit of vanity and self-care, which in today's case meant visiting the town barber and getting a new haircut.\n\nAs Kalyna entered the town, she couldn't help but feel as if something was off. At first glance, all seemed normal, but she sensed a tinge of warning, like the calm before the storm. The thin sense of normalcy was torn apart as she made a turn and saw the town's bookstore. It was like it had been turned into a battleground; its windows were shattered, holes and gashes tore into the walls, and the door was almost split in two.\n\nKalyna could not imagine what had spurned people to violence here and did not want to know. She uncomfortably turned around, planning to go home, when she saw the local grocery. She knew the owner, a proud man committed to supporting United Struggle and Anti-Nazism. His store window always had a flag of a burnt swastika hung up inside.\n\nIt was missing.\n\nKalyna hurried home, refusing to make eye contact with anyone until she knew she was safe."

A night like any other. But, for the three men clustered around a tiny table in the corner of a particularly dingy establishment, tonight marked the beginning of a waking nightmare.\n\nOleksander Ohloblyn's Spivavtory - collaborationists, fascists, cowards - were storming to victory. All polls showed them firmly in the lead. For the men sitting around the table, the losers of this game, it was all too much to stomach.\n\n"Bastard," muttered Taras Bulba-Borovets, glaring at his glass. "How the hell - we fought! We died for these people! And then...these German bootlicking scum..."\n\n"It's not safe in the streets for us anymore," said Dziuba, drumming his fingers on the table. "Fascist thugs attack our volunteers if we so much as put a banner up. We've even had assassinations, in broad daylight in the middle of the street. Ohloblyn doesn't care anymore. He knows we're done for. Vasyl, any ideas?"\n\nWithout speaking, Vasyl Stus shook his head. There was no way out of this. They'd failed, all three of them. The democracy for which so many good men had laid down their lives was to be snuffed out in the cradle, and the country handed back to the Germans without a fight.\n\nBorovets closed his eyes, to be met with a vision of a face he hadn't seen in many, many years. Stepan Bandera, howling with laughter, stabbing an accusing finger at him.\n\n"Taras Dmytrovych!" he cackled, tears streaming down his face. "You blind fool. I saw through it. I would have had Ohloblyn's head on a spike - but you? Oh, you!"\n\nBorovets covered his head with his hands and sank back into his chair."

There had been no masking the urgency behind her words, and the threat that was therefore implied. He had made all haste.\n\nEntering the room Dzuiba found, to his immense distaste, that Ohloblyn was already present, red-faced and clearly furious. As, of course, was often the case. The man jumped at Dzuiba's entry, shouting his usual venom, curses and all. Accusations of corruption, profiteering, and graft of all kinds. Most dangerously, though, was that of so-called 'blatant' misuse of government food stocks to aid his own election campaign.\n\nDzuiba's retort was simple - and direct. He was trying to assist his people, to provide for their most basic needs during a time of great need. Elections were ongoing, yes, but people still needed to feed their families. Besides, he said with great relish, if Ohloblyn cared to do the same, he would be more than welcome to.\n\nThe meeting ended soon after."

The crowd just outside, most from Kyiv but with some who had traveled very far indeed, filled the Babi Yar ravine. The location, and the horrors which had taken place there during the original invasion, were by now well known. Had scarred so many families in the country.\n\nEven now he found it difficult to read the words. How the action had even been accomplished. Thirty thousand people, Jews, killed in under forty-eight hours. Even beyond the human horror of the action, how had it even been logistically accomplished? Evil and barbarity found a way, he assumed, but as was being seen elsewhere, the suicidal nature of that evil always seemed to define its end-stage.\n\nListening to the near hundred-thousand people gathered, and preparing to emergy, Dziuba could feel, along with his apprehension, a sense of total conviction. Ukraine could not, would not, ever return to Nazi rule. The blood would be washed from its soil."

This week, all talk was on the new arrivals.\n\nThe 'Culturalists,' as they called themselves, had arrived in the small settlement. Pitching a grouping of tents just outside the collection of small houses that defined it, they had been speaking to each of them in turn over the last several days. Claiming to be agricultural 'experts,' they had been quick to demonstrate the equipment they had brought with them, with promises of more to come.\n\nSome of the villagers were greatly impressed. The village was and always had been quite poor, and the rare and expensive machinery, including tractors, threshers, and plowers of various types, promised massive increases in cultivation potential. The promise of more crops, a larger harvest - and thus more money - was intoxicating. But others dismissed the arrivals as city folk who did not, could not, understand their needs. Who were far removed from life on the soil.\n\nThe argument was, however, collegial in nature, and without resolution soon dissolved amidst the general cheer of the grouping. One day the result would become clear, and they would face it together, as they always had."

 FUK_election_cultur.4.desc: "It was no secret that, under the previous occupiers, Ukrainian education was not considered important. It was, in many cases, considered dangerous. Considered something to suppress. Even when it was not, the dire economic conditions forced many children to leave regardless.\n\nThe boy looking at the shelf was one of the victims of that thought. Forced to leave school before the age of ten in order to help his father and learn his trade - that of a cobbler - in order to support the family, he had not had a chance. In truth, he could barely read, and even then the words had to be simple. He had accepted this state, even though he knew there was something wrong, something unfair, about it.\n\nBut that day on the shelf he saw the pamphlet outside the town hall. The language within it knew its audience, and was direct and simple. Taking it home, after the long work day he began to read. The hours melted away. The tales of Cossacks, Poles, and communists all raced through him, and the spark that had been so long suppressed flared once more to life.\n\nHe knew he would not stop. That he would seek out knowledge. And with each tale, each story, each concept, he felt better about himself. About his place in the world. It was a very fulfilling feeling."

He had been so used, for so long, at seeing it occupied, chained, and otherwise abused, that to see it ascendant seemed almost surreal.\n\nIt looked nothing like the Kyiv of six months ago. Buildings had been constructed, rubble cleared away, trash swept up, and distribution systems organized. Everywhere there was construction, expansion, development, and progress. Even the sky seemed sharper. More blue. More full of promise for what was going on underneath it.\n\nBut what was far better to Dziuba than the improvement in the city's physical condition was the condition of its inhabitants. He remembered the sullen, gray, beaten, and scared people shuffling back and forth under oppressive stares and machine guns. No longer. The streets were full of Ukrainians on their way to work, to play, to talk, and to live. They seemed vibrant.\n\nDziuba knows that this Ukraine could have been had decades ago, and the thought enraged him. But they had it now, the second-best time, and the thought warmed his heart.

In front of him he held knowledge on both Ohloblyn and Bulba-Borovets, and he needed to decide which of them he despised more.\n\nOhloblyn's file detailed the man's collaboration with the Nazis, and his particular involvement with the massacre at Babi Yar. Bulba-Borovets' file detailed his past with Bandera, the OUN, and the many anti-semitic atrocities carried out in its name. He wasn't sure what he despised more - the open fascism of Ohloblyn, or the hollow anti-fascism and hatred of Bulba-Borovets.\n\nHe dearly wished to destroy both men. But that was not possible, and a choice had to be made. He could expose Ohloblyn and hold blackmail over Bulba-Borovets' head, or vice-versa. The decision kept him in the office late into the night."

Ohloblyn sighed, and slammed the receiver down. The telephone toppled off his desk from the force of the blow and fell to the floor, smashing open. With a grunt, Ohloblyn kicked away the detritus and slumped back into his chair.\n\nAnother donor gone. Badly needed money, going elsewhere. And the only beneficiaries were those idiots Stus and Dziuba. The worst part about all this was that none of these wealthy landowners gave a single shit about the Jews. Hell, if they'd been at Babi Yar, they'd probably have manned the guns themselves. But with Ohloblyn now under the spotlight for his own participation, the rats were smelling poison.\n\nHe hadn't even bothered to look at the latest batch of polling. His base was unaffected, of course - some were even congratulating Ohloblyn for his part in the killings. But a hard core of collaborators and out-and-out fascists were never going to win an election for the Spivavtory. The respectable, pragmatic Ukrainians that Ohloblyn needed for that were now deserting him en masse. He was no longer Ohloblyn, the realist. He was Ohloblyn, the murderer.\n\nOhloblyn reached into his suit and brought out a small gray flask - his sole comfort these days, with everything else tumbling down around him. Checking to see that nobody was around, he took off the cap and took a long, desperate swig."

"This situation has spiraled far out of our control. We're no Spivavtors, sure, but thanks to the countless rumors and exposees circulating around, our electoral prospects are looking grim. We're no better than the fascists in the OUN as far as the public is concerned, our poll numbers are plunging and our party activists are dropping like flies. But do not lose hope! We fought back from the brink against the Germans, and we can just as easily do so again against a few poll numbers and voting booths."\n\nThe second half of Stus's speech fell hollow against the chamber's stone-cold walls.

Ukraine was making its wishes heard, and its millions of voices cried out as one - Dziuba, and the Culturalists!\n\nYes, the citizens of Kyiv assembled before him in their thousands were part of this great chorus, but the truly gratifying response came from the quiet and battered countryside. The peasants had heard the call, and they were responding, producing an unstoppable wave of Culturalist votes that rendered the cities almost insignificant. More than their votes, Dziuba had their trust. And he intended to reward that trust a thousandfold.\n\nHis voice was electrifying even to himself - he could only imagine its impact on the people in the crowd. Words of hope, of persistence, of unity, promises of a Ukraine that could transcend the hellish decades behind them.\n\nBut even as he stood before the crowd, the very image of a triumphant orator, there still remained a small voice in the back of his head. The voice chanted names to him, ones that evoked very different images.\n\nGermany. Babi Yar.\n\nErich Koch. Otto Ohlendorf.\n\nAdolf Hitler.\n\nThey are not gone, the voice whispered to him.

Neither, though, were likely to get more than a quarter of the vote.\n\nDeciding this needed a celebratory drink or three, Stus left his office and headed down into the lobby of the United Struggle electoral headquarters. A relatively unimpressive office block that had once housed some RK agency or another, the place had been brought to life over the past few months. The lobby was always full of people, and there were banners and bunting everywhere.\n\nAs he looked around though, the grin curled up and died on his face. Yes, the lobby was full, but not with volunteers or party workers. The place was swarming with plainclothes men from the Polissian Guard - Borovets' men. He'd assured Stus that the security was necessary, this being one of the most important events in Ukrainian history, but the sight made Stus very uneasy.\n\nHe knew there were many in the Guard who would prefer to dispense with democracy. Borovets had restrained them for now, but how far would the Guard tolerate him? If parliamentary democracy proved to be too slow for the Guard's liking, would they stand by? Or was Borovets waiting in the wings even now, only needing Stus to slip up once..."

 ### UNRA EPILOGUE ###
 
 # Dziuba
 
 FUK_epilogue.1.t: "The Mandate"
 FUK_epilogue.1.desc: "Dziuba walked up to the head of the podium, a roaring crowd around him. He felt dizzy. Until now, he had been a writer, a speaker, a thinker. Now, he was a president. As he joined with old allies on the steps of the Kyiv Rada, he stood amongst elder titans of resistance, men who had lived twice as long as him or more. Now, he carried on their fight.\n\n"Good people of Ukraine!" The loudspeakers echoed his words, far louder than he had expected. "I come to you today with the mandate to give to you what you deserve - a proper nation. For too long, we have suffered under the chains of an inhuman oppression, one which sot not just to steal our livelihoods, but our very souls. Their mission was to destroy our culture - mine will be to empower it."\n\nThe thought of a German return sent murmurs through the crowd. Perhaps a bad note.\n\n"Beginning today, I promise that I will give the Ukrainian people their nation back. No longer will you starve. no longer will you stand in bondage. You will be safe in the bosom of the Ukrainian nation, a bond shared between all of us, brothers and sisters. I thank you all for your support over this election, and I hope that you will support me as I work to make this dream a reality!"\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers, and Dziuba exited, still reeling."
 FUK_epilogue.1.a: "A promise was made today."
 
 FUK_epilogue.2.t: "Feeding a Nation"
 FUK_epilogue.2.desc: "Mykola had come to enjoy this job. Since joining the UNRA, he had been assigned to help Petro with a relief program, directly aiding the communities most heavily hit by the war. The Culturalists had been a major help getting everything set up - Mykola had seen Petro campaigning for them on his days off. Their office in Kherson ended up filled with hungry refugees by the early morning each day, but the long hours were worth the cause. The Ukrainian people were finally free to live and express themselves, to be nourished in every manner.\n\nFirst in line was an older Ukrainian woman. She was a regular - Petro was fairly certain her family had died during the war. She always left with a compliment, and Mykola made certain to sneak an extra piece of bread for her when he could.\n\nThe second in line was someone Mykola had never seen. It was a nervous, quiet child. He was dressed unusually, with a vest.\n\nThe boy began to speak, his Ukrainian stilted and uneven. "My name is... Dzhevdet. I came here after Crimea was taken by Germany, and I-"\n\nPetro suddenly grew stern, surprising Mykola. "Please step aside, child. This food is for strengthening the Ukrainian nation."\n\nThe child did as he was told, and began to walk away. Mykola noticed with concern that he did not even seem surprised."
 FUK_epilogue.2.a: "Had this happened to him before?"
 
 FUK_epilogue.3.t: "Dreamless Night"
 FUK_epilogue.3.desc: "Columns of soldiers, miles wide.\n\nThe Capitol alight.\n\nIvan Dziuba couldn't stop thinking of it. What was to come. What had to come.\n\nThe Germans would return. There was not yet clear proof of that fact, but it was still obvious on its face. Their culture and civilization was based on an eternal and ever-lasting oppression, and that would not end with the victories his government had managed. The fire of hate that burned within them could never be cooled.\n\nAnd when that day came, what would Ukraine do? He wanted to believe in the mystic answer, that such a battle would be a clash of cultures, one in which the nourishment of the Ukrainian people could reverse the tide and at last secure the nation its freedom. Yet when he closed his eyes, he saw a battle of steel and flames, one which Ukraine seemed doomed to lose.\n\nThere may be an answer, but when Dziuba closed his eyes he could not see it. This great weight was on his shoulders, pressing harder and harder, and until an answer came to him he could not bear to sleep."
 FUK_epilogue.3.a: "No dreams, only visions."

 # Ohloblyn
 
 FUK_epilogue.4.t: "Leaders of Men"
 FUK_epilogue.4.desc: "If one were to look at Ohloblyn, one would not imagine him as a commanding figure. Yet during the aftermath of an undeserved victory, the people who voted for him would chant his name as they waited for him. It was not the joyous cries of a rapt audience but instead the martial stomp of men waiting for their leader, a man who would deliver their answers.\n\nOleksander Ohloblyn and his top co-conspirator, Volodymyr Bahaziy, walked to the stage, basking in the raw energy of his supporters. If he were to raise his fist in the air, they would all follow him, a thought that allowed a small smile to creep onto his face. He touched the microphone, ready to deliver his sermon to Ukraine.\n\n"Long ago, our Republic's predecessor perished and was torn apart by its most insidious enemies. It was not the Germans who did this - it was the Bolsheviks who trampled our flag into mud." Slowly, his voice rose to louder proportions. "Bolshevism killed our nation - men who called themselves Ukrainians turned into rats, parasites who hollowed out everything we loved.\n\n"Even today, my opponents in this election dare to call themselves nationalists or patriots when it is abundantly clear to all those who truly love Ukraine that they are crypto-Bolsheviks ready to restore a red flag." The crowd screamed insults toward Dziubia and Stus, laced with accusations of "Jewish tricks".\n\n"This is why I argue for German cooperation, for I am not ignorant nor in bed with communists - I am a realist. Germany has dealt with the Bolshevik issue before, they are perhaps the only superpower that has, making them the only country who can give us security and the only country that can let us maintain our freedom."\n\nAnd this message was only met with approval and clapping by the Ukrainian audience..."
 FUK_epilogue.4.a: "...like cows applauding an abattoir."
 
 FUK_epilogue.5.t: "New Dawn Fades"
 FUK_epilogue.5.desc: "In a forgotten office of the new Ukrainian Rada, three men snuck away to hide themselves inside. They found themselves castigated by the people they fought to protect, but they knew it was not the people's fault for this. That damn charlatan Ohloblyn had conned and bribed his way to power, but opposition remained.\n\n"Thank you Dziubia for meeting with us today. I'm glad that no matter our differences politically, we can still find common ground against fascists, these frauds who sabotaged our fair system." Dziubia nodded along, while Borovets seemed more occupied with making sure no one was watching them than to express concurrence.\n\n"We fought and broke the backs of fascists before - we can do so again." Dziubia's optimism seemed countered by Stus having buried his head into his hands, clutching his hair for relief. Borovet's blind state of panic did not help matters.\n\n"Those fools are going to sell us all out to the Germans, the same creatures who held their boots over our neck for over twenty years." Stus and Dziubia banged their fists on the table in agreement. "We must use any means necessary to rid these lap dogs from power, whatever it takes." Dziubia enthusiastically clapped for Borovets as they both left to rally their parties.\n\nStus trailed along behind them, unable to shake a sinking feeling residing within him that the two of them seemed to prioritize removing the fascists from power rather than continuing the democracy that they had fought for. He could only focus on the task at hand for now and deal with the consequences later."
 FUK_epilogue.5.a: "The Republican dream drifted into a distant memory."
 
 FUK_epilogue.6.t: "Colony"
 FUK_epilogue.6.desc: "Ohloblyn's office seemed conspicuously more luxurious since becoming President. Relics of an ancient Ukraine dotted the room, becoming the object of small talk as Volodmyr Bahaziy lounged in a leather chair that once belonged to a Reich bureaucrat. The new President hushed the chit-chat in favor of getting down to business.\n\n"Volodmyr, while I must thank you again for your range of indispensable friends that have landed us into the highest of stations, we still have a lot of work left to do." Ohloblyn began pouring out drinks for the both of them while continuing. "There are those opposed to our plans with a greater number of representatives in the Rada than I would care for."\n\nBahaziy was unable to stifle a laugh after the last sentence. "Oleksander, please, you get so caught up in these trivialities. Me and my men worked like clockwork in the election, the Rada should be a cakewalk." He took hold of his glass as he looked outside the office window. "Our people are scared, terrified of reprisals, frightened of their own freedom." He flicked his head over to Ohloblyn.\n\n"We can tell these idiots whatever we please if they think it will save them from another Reichskommissariat."\n\nOhloblyn gulped the liquor as he took out a draft. "In that case, take this bill regarding compensation for German settlers to your people, see what needs to be added and who needs to be persuaded to vote for it, do whatever you need to do."\n\nHis lieutenant snatched the paper as he walked out into the dying light of Kyiv. Bahaziy was met with no triumphant praise, just the cold quietness of a people cowed. It was a familiar feeling he had missed since he was mayor, but those days seemed to be slowly returning."
 FUK_epilogue.6.a: "It was as if nothing had changed."

 UKR_FUK_ohloblyn_epilogue_tt: "§MUkr§!§Yaine§! has achieved what was thought impossible mere months ago - freedom and democracy. Under Ohloblyn, it has surrendered both, hoping for security.

 # Stus 
 
 FUK_epilogue.7.t: "The Will to Change"
 FUK_epilogue.7.desc: "Stus silently listened to the cheering as he tried to contain himself before walking on stage. The roar of cheers seemed as if it could drown out the sun itself, unabated since the election results were announced. Each voice was a person who voted United Struggle, another defiant rejection of fascism, and another triumphant scream of joy for their freedom.\n\nHe could not resist much longer as he took to the stage with Borovets, smiling alongside him. The voices grew louder and louder as the crowd seemed ready to swallow them whole. Stus grasped the microphone as he attempted to speak the beliefs the people elected him for.\n\n"In less than a year, we have accomplished what four decades could not." The cheers only continued to deafening levels as he kept speaking. "But we can accomplish so much more as we stand as a bastion of freedom within Europe against the tide of fascism."\n\nUkrainian families eagerly held onto each syllable of Stus's speech as a promise that tomorrow would bring no more pain, no more suffering. "We must march together as one. No more will we fight one another under the eye of German masters, we stand united against them all. So I say, forward! Together as one for a free Ukraine!"\n\nThe crowd reached its zenith as clapping finally swallowed Stus's voice whole, leaving him to think on his words.\n\nWords and promises, that was all they were.\n\nHow was he going to fulfill these promises? He painted them a dream, one far different from reality. Stus soon finished the speech and talked to the dreamers. Afterward, he could only stare at his notes for the speech, and clutch them tightly to his chest."
 FUK_epilogue.7.a: ""My people's will must be done.""
 
 FUK_epilogue.8.t: "Civic Action"
 FUK_epilogue.8.desc: "The dead of the night let Kyiv sleep happy for the first time in a long time, but was this in spite or because of the men and woman who patrolled its corners at night? Women like Oksana, who had fought for freedom and survived to create a new Ukraine, unlike her husband, who had faltered in the second half.\n\nThey were the force behind Stus's words, the one that reminded the dogs who once had knelt to the Reich that their life was measured by an hourglass.\n\nGlass shards danced across the kitchen floor as patriots forced their way into the home of a one-time Ukrainian National Council stooge. Oksana filled a kettle of water and left it boiling - a security measure should the worm try to reveal himself.\n\nThe house itself was coated in opulence - one that made it clear which party he supported. Chairs and tables were brutalized into a pile as photographs and medals were torched. Painted tridents would daub the walls, while shattered glass stained the floorboards. Rising smoke plumes signaled the need for a hasty exit as the proud band moved onto another collaborator's home.\n\nThe hidden man and his family ran downstairs to extinguish the fire in vain attempts to save the ashes of what was left to them. When the UNRA told him that defection would make his life easier, he believed them."
 FUK_epilogue.8.a: "He was naive then."
 
 FUK_epilogue.9.t: "The Price of Freedom"
 FUK_epilogue.9.desc: "The clock in President Vasyl Stus's office ticked away far quicker than he would have cared for. Each hour pre-occupied was another hour the fascists would grow in strength. He knew too well the consequences of that, the return of the German strain to their soil brought on by his own people - ready to tear down every brick of the democracy the UNRA had built.\n\nBorovets knew these dangers as well, giving this appointment to discuss it with Stus the utmost importance. Unfortunately, their views appeared to be on either side of a slowly widening ravine.\n\n"Why are we allowing these traitors a voice?" Stus's teeth were grinding themselves away to nubs as he listened to Borovets speak. "I condone the acts of those patriots against the sniveling cowards who try to hide from justice, waving around pamphlets that look like Leibbrandt could have written them."\n\n"They torched the homes of our allies. How are we meant to present a united front when this is how our 'patriots' act?" Borovets fought through the thick of it with him. Stus thought he would see things this way. "All we need is popular support to keep our democracy alive. What you propose and praise is what kills it." By now, Stus and Borovets were mere inches away from each other.\n\n"You saw Ohloblyn at the elections-" Borovets restrained himself from the edge. "So be it. If you want to let this fifth column sabotage our independence, have your charade. I'll do what it takes to rid our nation of fascism." His point was only accentuated by a door slam, and Stus was left alone.\n\nThis democracy they had fought for was just prevented from suicide with Ohloblyn, and now he had Borovets watching over it..."
